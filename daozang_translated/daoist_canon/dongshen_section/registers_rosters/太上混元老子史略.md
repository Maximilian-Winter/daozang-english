### *The Supreme Venerable Lord Laozi: A Historical Outline* (Fascicle One)
Compiled by Daoist Xie Shoubin of Qingxu Hermitage, Mount Lu

Since the eras of *Longhan* and *Yankang*, amid the epochs of *Pangu* and the *Taiji*, the Supreme Lord Lao descended into the world repeatedly. In the primordial age, records are too obscure to detail; those that survive are set aside here, and we begin instead with the *Tianhuang* clan.

The descendants of the *Tianhuang* clan ruled the world for 10,800 years.
The descendants of the *Dihuang* clan ruled the world for 10,800 years.
The descendants of the *Renhuang* clan ruled the world for 10,800 years.
The *Five Dragons* era, ruled by five clans, governed the world for 73,000 years.
The *Shetij* era, ruled by seventy-two clans, governed the world for a total of 691,500 years.
The *Hexiong* era, ruled by seventy-two clans, governed the world for a total of 3,020 years.
The *Lianyao* era, ruled by six clans, governed the world for a total of 6,435 years.
The *Sixing* era, ruled by four clans, governed the world for a total of 14,000 years.

During these times, the Supreme Lord descended, bearing titles such as *Master of the Mysterious Center*, *Elder of Ancient Greatness*, and *Master Pangu*, adapting his teachings to the age.

*Fuxi*, of the Wooden Virtue, first created the calendar, beginning the first year with *jiayin*. His descendants ruled for 45,600 years. The Supreme Lord descended at this time, bearing the title *Yu Huazi*.

*Zhurong*, of the Fiery Virtue, began his reign in *bingchen*. His descendants ruled for a total of 530 years. The Supreme Lord descended, bearing the title *Guangshouzi*.

*Shennong*, a descendant of *Zhurong*, first taught the people to cultivate the hundred grains, hence his title *Shennong* (Divine Farmer). The Supreme Lord bore the title *Dachengzi*.

*The Yellow Emperor*, of the Earthen Virtue, began his reign in *yiyou*. His descendants ruled for a total of 1,520 years. The Supreme Lord descended, bearing the title *Guangchengzi*, dwelling on Mount Kongtong. The Emperor relinquished the world, crawling on his knees to seek the Dao. Mounting a dragon, he ascended, and was bestowed the *Classic of the Hidden Talisman*.

*Shaohao*, of the Metallic Virtue, had descendants who ruled for a total of 400 years. The Supreme Lord descended, bearing the title *Suiyingzi*, and bestowed the *Classic of Solemn Reverence*.

*Zhuanxu*, of the Watery Virtue, reigned for 78 years. The Supreme Lord bore the title *Chijingzi*.

*Gaoxin*, of the Wooden Virtue, reigned for 70 years. The Supreme Lord bore the title *Lutuzi* and bestowed the *Classic of the Yellow Court*.

*Tang Yao*, of the Fiery Virtue, reigned for 70 years. The Supreme Lord bore the title *Wuchengzi* and bestowed the *Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*.

*Yu Shun*, of the Earthen Virtue, acted as regent for 30 years and reigned for 50 years. The Supreme Lord bore the title *Yinshouzi*.

*Xia Yu*, of the Metallic Virtue, established *yin* as the first month. His descendants ruled for a total of 463 years. The Supreme Lord bore the title *Zhenxingzi* and bestowed the *Five True Writs of the Numinous Treasure* for governing floods.

*Tang of Shang*, of the Watery Virtue, began his reign in *gengxu*, establishing *chou* as the first month. The Supreme Lord bore the title *Xizezi* and bestowed the *Classic of Longevity*.

The above is drawn from the *Imperial Genealogy*, *Charts of Successive Eras*, *Great Possession Scripture of the Cavernous Divine*, *Jade Calendar Scripture*, *Records of the Expedition Beyond the Frontier*, *Yin’s Records of the Mysterious Center*, and Cui Shan’s *Treatise on Geography*.

As the Supreme Lord divided his body to descend and establish teachings in each age, concealing himself once his work was done, there is no record of his birth. From *Yang Jia* of the Shang to this point, eighteen generations passed, with a reign of thirty years. In the first year, *jiachen* (10th year), and the 17th year, *gengshen*, the Supreme Lord, from the *Taiqing* realm, divided his spirit to transform into a dark radiance, entrusting conception to the *Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden*.

Citations from the *Sacred Records* and *Biographies of Immortals*:
*Pan Geng* reigned for 29 years, *Xiao Xin* for 18 years, and *Xiao Yi* for 11 years.
*Wu Ding*, styled *Gaozong*, reigned for 59 years. The first year was *renshen*, the ninth year *gengchen*, with the second month established as *yin*. The Shang followed the earthly norm.

The *Records of the Green Ram Palace* state: During the reign of *Gaozong* of Shang, when *King Wen of Zhou* first expounded the *Yi*, divine radiance flowed into the jade embryo, and auspicious splendor congealed into golden bones. *Le Penggui*, Grand Academician of the Tang Hanlin Academy, composed this by imperial decree, and it was engraved on stone in the prefecture of Chengdu.

In the *Analects*, Confucius said: "I privately compare myself to *Lao Peng*."
Ancient commentary states: *Lao Peng* was a worthy minister of Shang.
The subcommentary explains: *Lao* refers to *Lao Dan*, and *Peng* to *Peng Zu*.
The *Generational Records* state: In Shang, he was the *Keeper of Archives*; in Zhou, he was the *Scribe Beneath the Pillar*. This was before *King Wen* had been enfeoffed as a lord to serve Shang, so he could not yet be called *Zhou*.

*Zu Jia* reigned for 10 years.
*Zu Geng* reigned for 6 years.
*Zu Jia* (second) reigned for 3 years.
*Geng Ding* reigned for 1 year.
*Wu Yi* reigned for 2 years.
*Tai Ding* reigned for 2 years.
*Di Yi* reigned for 8 years.
*Zhou* (King Zhou of Shang) reigned for 27 years.

In the 6th year, *yiwei*, and the 21st year, *dingmao*, the Supreme Lord descended again on the southern slope of Mount Qi, bearing the title *Xieyizi*. The present *Qisheng Palace* in Fengxiang Prefecture marks the site. At that time, *King Wen of Zhou* served as the *Western Earl* and summoned him as *Keeper of Archives*. When *Zhou* (King Zhou of Shang) acted without the Dao, *King Wu* destroyed him in the ninth year.

The Shang ruled the world for a total of 620 years.

*King Wu of Zhou*, of the Wooden Virtue, established *zi* as the first month. On the 15th day, *guiyou*, he executed *Zhou* and overthrew the Shang, ascending as Son of Heaven. He transferred the Supreme Lord to the post of *Scribe Beneath the Pillar*.

Xue Daoheng, *Neishi* of the Sui, composed the *Eulogy of the Temple Court* by imperial decree. Its preface states: From *Fuxi* to the house of Zhou, records span successive eras, with names changing as forms altered. During the times of *King Wen* and *King Wu*, he held the office of *Keeper of Archives* and *Scribe Beneath the Pillar*. Though courts and markets shifted, his countenance remained unchanged.

King Cheng reigned for forty-seven years, his first year being *wuyin*. The Venerable Lord served as *Scribe Beneath the Pillar*. King Kang reigned for twenty-six years, his first year being *yichou*. The Venerable Lord continued as *Scribe Beneath the Pillar*. King Zhao reigned for forty-nine years, his first year being *yimao*. In that year, the Venerable Lord resigned his post and returned to Bo. In the twenty-third year, *guichou*, he passed westward through Hangu Pass, where he instructed the Pass Prefect Yin Xi.

The *Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states: The Venerable Lord’s charioteer, Xu Jia, had agreed to receive a hundred coins daily, which by that time amounted to seven million three hundred thousand. When Xu Jia saw the Venerable Lord was about to journey far, he urgently demanded his wages. The Venerable Lord said: “I wish to send you as my escort to the Western Sea, to the lands of Da Qin, Jibin, Anxi, and other states. Upon our return, I shall repay you in gold.” Xu Jia desisted. But upon reaching the Pass, he sought to remain and sued the Venerable Lord for his wages. The Venerable Lord said to him: “You have followed me for over two hundred years. Long ago, you should have died, but I gave you the *Tai Xuan* Life Talisman, by which you have lived to this day. How can you forget this and sue me?” As he spoke, the talisman flew from Xu Jia’s mouth, and he died instantly. At Yin Xi’s entreaty, the Venerable Lord cast the talisman again, and Xu Jia revived.

From the ninth year of King Gaozong of Shang to the twenty-third year of King Zhao of Zhou, nine hundred and twenty years had passed. In the twenty-fourth year, *jiayin*, the Venerable Lord transmitted the Dao to Yin Xi and then ascended to heaven. In the twenty-fifth year, *yimao*, he divided his form and descended into the household of Li Taiguan in Shu. In the twenty-seventh year, *dingsi*, he met Yin Xi at the market of the Green Ram. Thus, the Tang records state: The Green Ram Market was the place where the Supreme Venerable One, the Heavenly Emperor of Primordial Chaos, made his second descent.

From the decline of the Dao in Shang and the waning of virtue in Zhou, he passed through the office of *Keeper of Archives*, dwelling among the dust of the world, then abandoned the post of *Scribe Beneath the Pillar* to withdraw to the frontier. Leaving behind the court of Wei, he crossed westward through Hangu Pass. Yin Xi, divining that the Dao Lord would surely arrive, secretly transmitted the wondrous instructions and subtly imparted the profound words. They renewed their thousand-day covenant and arranged a second meeting for that hour.

As he prepared to depart the lands of Shu, wishing to transform the customs of the Hu barbarians, he journeyed far to the shifting sands, enduring the wild ways of distant lands, reaching the kingdoms of Shendu and Chubin. He instructed King Fan Tuo’ezhu, and the eighty tribes of the Xiongnu all submitted to his pure transformation; the fierce savagery of two thousand nations was forever purged of their benighted ways.

The *Eulogy of Lord Lao* composed by Emperor Ming of Wei states: Deeply pitying later generations, he descended in the Chen lineage, serving as *Scribe Beneath the Pillar* of Zhou for nine hundred years. At the boundless end of that era, he returned to Kunlun, then transformed the Hu realms, proceeding next to Chubin, and thereafter to Tianzhu. Thus he departed, leaving writings to endure for posterity, never to fade in the *Yongping* era.

The *History of the Northern Dynasties: Western Regions* further records: The kingdom of Yutian lies over two hundred *li* north of the Congling Mountains, nine thousand eight hundred *li* from Daijun. Its lands span a thousand *li* in circumference, with mountains linking its cities. Within its nine hundred *li* of territory stand five great cities and dozens of smaller ones, where Buddhist law flourishes with temples, pagodas, monks, and nuns. Five hundred *li* to its southwest lies the Kunmo Monastery, said to be the place where Lord Lao transformed the Hu. The people there lack propriety, with many thieves and licentiousness; their customs otherwise resemble those of Qiuci. These accounts are also found in the *Wei Lue: Western Rong* and *Han Shu*.

King Mu reigned fifty-five years. In the first year, *xinsi*, after transforming the Hu, Lord Lao returned to the Central Lands, journeying east to Fusang, where he met the Great Emperor and reviewed the assembled immortals of the grasses. When the king heard that Perfected Master Yin had attained the Dao and ascended, he ordered the construction of the Louguan retreat, appointing seven Daoists to maintain its sacrifices. This is recorded in the *Inner Annals of King Mu* and the *Records of Louguan*.

King Gong reigned twelve years, beginning in the first year, *bingzi*.
King Xiao reigned fifteen years, beginning in the first year, *guichou*.
King Yi reigned twenty-five years, beginning in the first year, *wuzǐ*.
King Li reigned sixteen years, beginning in the first year, *wuchen*.
King Li reigned thirty-seven years, beginning in the first year, *jiashen*.
The Duke of Zhou and Duke of Shao ruled jointly for fourteen years.
King Xuan reigned forty-six years, beginning in the first year, *jiaxu*. At that time, a firewood-gatherer sang as he walked, his words unknown to all. When asked, Lord Lao said: This is a man of the living nation who cultivates the supreme, perfectly true Dao.

King You reigned eleven years, beginning in the first year, *gengshen*.
In the second year, *xinyou*, the earth quaked, and the Jing, Wei, and Luo rivers all trembled. Lord Lao said: Zhou is about to fall. Indeed, it was destroyed by the Quanrong. This is recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian*.

King Ping moved east to Luoyi and reigned fifty-two years, beginning in the first year, *xinwei*.

In the thirty-third year, *guimao*, in the twelfth month, Lord Lao again emerged at the Hangu Pass, enlightening the state of Su, then journeyed to the Liu and Lin isles of the Western Sea. There, he examined and assessed the merits of the herb-gathering immortals, appointing and promoting officials. Once the matters were concluded, he returned to the Central Kingdom. Recorded in the *Record of Western Ascension*.

In the twenty-fifth year, *yisi*, Lord Lao descended into the chamber of the Daoist Zhu Lun, where he revealed the *Scripture of the Six Jia of Numinous Flight*, the *White Memorial of Cinnabar Talismans*, and the *Central Scripture of Communion with Perfected Realms*.

King Wei reigned twenty-three years, beginning in the first year, *rentu*.
King Zhuang reigned fifteen years, beginning in the first year, *yiyou*.

In the third year, *dinghai*, in the fourth month, Duke Wei of Lu passed away in Qi, and Duke Zhuang ascended the throne. The following year marked the first year of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.

The seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu corresponded to the tenth year of King Zhuang of Zhou.

In the tenth year, *jiawu*, on the seventh day of the fourth month (the beginning of the *mao* month), during the night, the Buddha Śākyamuni was born. The *Sutra of Auspicious Responses* states: born on the eighth day of the fourth month at midnight. This follows the Zhou calendar. The *Sutra of Past and Present* states: born on the eighth day of the second month, following the Xia calendar. The *History of the Northern Dynasties: Western Regions* records: the state of Yānqí and the Brahmin customs venerated the Buddha, especially observing the eighth day of the second month with fasting and the practice of the Way. The *Zuozhuan* states: "At night, the constant stars were not seen; the night was bright, and stars fell like rain upon the two palace stairways." Thus, Wang Zhong, Recorder of Documents under the Xiao Qi, inscribed in the *Stele of the Toutuo Temple*: "The two Zhuangs of Zhou and Lu personally witnessed the night’s radiant mirror; the two Mings of Han and Jin together adorned the cinnabar and azure embellishments." This stele stands in Ezhou. The *Wen Xuan* commentary notes: the Buddha was born in the time of King Zhuang of Zhou; the Buddha’s teachings came in the time of Emperor Ming of Han and flourished in the time of Emperor Ming of Jin.

King Xi reigned five years.
King Hui reigned twenty-five years, beginning in the first year, *yisi*.
King Xiang reigned thirty-three years, beginning in the first year, *gengxu*.
King Qing reigned six years, beginning in the first year, *guimao*.
King Kuang reigned six years, beginning in the first year, *jiyou*.

In the fourth year, *renzi*, the Buddha entered *nirvāṇa* at the age of seventy-nine. The *Golden Light Sutra* of the Śākya tradition states: "The lifespan is brief, barely eighty years." This is a rounded figure.

King Ding reigned twenty-one years, beginning in the first year, *yimao*.

The king inquired of Laozi regarding immortals in the world, and Laozi replied that on Mount Song there was a Great Ancient Master—namely, himself. As recorded in Zhang Sengjian’s *Xunyang Record*.

King Jian reigned fourteen years, beginning in the first year, *bingzi*.
King Ling reigned twenty-seven years, beginning in the first year, *gengyin*. In the twenty-first year, *gengxu*, on the twenty-first day of the tenth month, Confucius was born.
King Jing reigned twenty-five years, beginning in the first year, *dingsi*.
King Dao reigned five months.
King Jing reigned forty-three years, beginning in the first year, *renwu*. In the seventeenth year, *wuxu*, Confucius met Laozi to inquire about the Dao, as recorded in the *Book of Rites* and the *Zhuangzi*. Some suspect this event occurred earlier, but while it is mentioned in the *Book of Rites*, neither the *Confucian Family Sayings* nor the *Records of the Grand Historian* specify the year, so its sequence remains uncertain. In the forty-first year, *rentu*, Confucius passed away at the age of seventy-three.
King Yuan reigned eight years, beginning in the first year, *yichou*.
King Zhengding reigned twenty-eight years, beginning in the first year, *guichou*.
King Ai reigned three months.
King Si reigned five months.
King Kao reigned fifteen years, beginning in the first year, *xinchou*.
King Weilie reigned twenty-four years, beginning in the first year, *bingchen*.
King An reigned twenty-six years, beginning in the first year, *gengchen*. In the eighteenth year, *dingyou*, Duke Xian of Qin ascended the throne.
King Yilie reigned seven years, beginning in the first year, *bingwu*. In the second year, *dingwei*, Lord Lao encountered Duke Xian of Qin, who received him with lodging and rites, inquiring about the reckoning of time. Laozi then departed through the Hangu Pass. As recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian*.
King Xian reigned forty-eight years, beginning in the first year, *guichou*. In the eighth year, *gengshen*, Duke Xiao of Qin ascended the throne. Lord Lao traveled eastward, returning to Red City and Mount Meng, then revisited Fusang, gathered with immortals among the grasses, and later concealed himself, wandering from Mount Jingtai to Mount Shaoshi. As noted in the *Shiyi Ji*.
King Shenshuo reigned six years, beginning in the first year, *xinchou*.
King Nan moved the capital to Western Zhou and reigned fifty-nine years, beginning in the first year, *dingwei*. In the ninth year, *yimao*, King Zhao of Qin ascended the throne. Lord Lao, accompanied by various immortals, journeyed west to Mount Nüji, Mount Jitou, and Mount Tianzhu, then exited through the Hangu Pass, crossed the Flowing Sands, ascended Kunlun, and returned to the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace. Upon hearing of this, King Zhao established cities and towns along Lord Lao’s route to mark the sacred boundary, founding the Lao Stop Post and Yin Xi City.

In the fifty-ninth year, Western Zhou fell. From the ninth year of King Wuding of Shang, *gengchen*, when Lord Lao descended to be born, until the ninth year of King Nan of Zhou, *yimao*, when he returned to the heavenly gates, his appearances and withdrawals spanned nine hundred thirty-six years. Thus, Emperor Ming of Wei praised him: "As Zhou’s Archivist, he endured nine hundred years." Wu Yanghao, Academician of the Tang Imperial Academy, also remarked: "Lord Lao’s transformations are profound and his responses unfathomable; born in the Shang era, he served in the Zhou dynasty, spanning a thousand years from beginning to end." This refers to the completion of his sojourn.

The first year of the First Emperor of Qin was *yimao*. In the twenty-sixth year, *gengchen*, he divided the land into thirty-six commanderies. In the twenty-eighth year, *renwu*, he performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices, established a shrine to Laozi south of the Louguan Terrace, and personally conducted the rites. Lord Lao descended and bestowed upon the emperor the *Guilin Jing*, a talisman for commanding ghosts and spirits.

In the first year of Emperor Wen of Former Han, *renshu*, and the seventh year, *wuchen*, Lord Lao descended by the banks of the Yellow River in Shan, where people called him the River Earl. The emperor personally visited him, and Lord Lao transmitted the *Daode Jing*. To this day, north of Shan Prefecture stands the River Earl Temple and Emperor Wen’s Terrace for Gazing at Immortals, the very site.

In the first year of the *Heping* era of Emperor Cheng, *guisi*, and the second year, *jiawu*, Lord Lao descended at Quyang Abyss in Langye Commandery, transmitting to Gan Ji the *Tai Ping Jing* in one hundred seventy scrolls.

During the reign of Emperor Ming of Later Han, the Buddha’s teachings first entered China.

In the first year of the *Yuanjia* era of Emperor Zhang, *jiashen*, and the second year, *yiyou*, Lord Lao descended and again transmitted to Gan Ji one hundred eighty precepts.

In the first year of the *Yongchu* era of Emperor An, *dingwei*, and the third year, *jiyou*, Lord Lao descended and bestowed upon Liu Tu of Jiangxia the *Zuifu Xinke*, detailing karmic retribution.

In the first year of the *Yongjian* era of Emperor Shun, *bingyin*, and after four subsequent reign titles, in the first year of the *Han’an* era, *renwu*, Lord Lao descended on Mount Heming in Shu, transmitting to Celestial Master Zhang Daoling the *Zhengyi Mengwei Milu*. In the fifth month, he descended again, bestowing the *Taiqing Zhongjing* in nine hundred thirty scrolls and seventy-two scrolls of talismanic texts.

In the first year of the *Jiankang* era, he descended again on Mount Yuntai in Guizhou, transmitting the Three Caverns’ scriptures and the methods for transcending the Nine Mysteries.

In the first year of the *Jianhe* era of Emperor Huan, *dinghai*, and after one subsequent reign title, in the first year of the *Yongshou* era, *yiwei*, Lord Lao descended in Chengdu, bestowing upon the Celestial Master the texts for absolving death, the site of which is now the Jade Bureau’s transformation. He also descended on Mount Lutang, transmitting the texts for restraining the Six Heavens’ demonic ghosts.

In the first year of the *Jianning* era of Emperor Ling, *wushen*, and after three subsequent reign titles, in the second year of the *Guanghe* era, *jiwei*, Lord Lao descended on Mount Tiantai, transmitting to the immortal Ge Xuan the *Shangqing*, *Lingbao*, and *Dadong* scriptures, the Three Registers’ Nine Grades of Purification Rites, and the *Quanjie*, *Fashen*, and *Ruding* scriptures.

In the first year of the *Long’an* era of Emperor An of Jin, *dingyou*, and after one subsequent reign title, in the first year of the *Yuanxing* era, *renyin*, the fifth year of Yao Hong’s reign in Later Qin, Lord Lao descended, inspecting the sacred mountains. He urged the immortal Cheng Gongxing to relocate to Mount Song and bestowed upon him elixirs of immortality. The above accounts are cross-referenced in historical records, the *Record of Grotto Heavens and Blessed Lands*, and various commandery gazetteers.

In the first year of Emperor Ming of Later Wei’s *Yongxing* era, five years after his accession—with three subsequent reign titles—in the second year of the *Shenrui* era, *yimao*.

In the eleventh year of Emperor An of Jin’s *Yixi* era, Lord Lao descended upon Mount Song and bestowed upon the Daoist Kou Qianzhi the *Yunzhong Yinsong Xinke Zhijie* (Cloud-Chanting New Precepts of the Registers). In the second year of Emperor Mingyuan of Later Wei’s *Taichang* era, *dingsi*, he descended again, granting seventy scrolls of talismanic registers.

In the first year of Emperor Yang of Sui’s *Daye* era, *yichou*, and again in the thirteenth year, *dingchou*, Lord Lao descended upon Mount Zhongnan and spoke to Li Chunfeng of the celestial mandate bestowed upon the Duke of Tang. This account appears in the *Golden Lock and Flowing Pearl*.

In the first year of Emperor Gaozu of Tang’s *Wude* era, *wuyin*, and again in the second year, *jimao*, Lord Lao descended upon Yangjiao Mountain and instructed Ji Shanxing to report: “I am the imperial ancestor. Now that sagely governance is established, the altars of soil and grain shall endure.” In the fifth year, *renwu*, he descended once more to reveal the date for vanquishing the rebels. This appears in the *Tang History*.

In the first year of Emperor Gaozong’s *Yonghui* era, *gengxu*, and again in the second year of *Longxiang*, *renxu*, the emperor visited the Luoyang Palace and established a sacred temple at the northern Yu Zhi shrine. During the grand jiao rites of celebration, Lord Lao descended upon the palace hall, flanked by two perfected ones, their radiance illuminating the altar steps, witnessed by all. Palace Attendant Quan Dali and others submitted a memorial, prompting an imperial edict to commission a portrait of the auspicious vision. This is recorded in the *Luozhou Records* and the memorial of Master Yang Hu.

In the second year of the *Qianfeng* era, *bingyin*, the emperor performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai and journeyed to Bo to pay homage to Laozi, presenting an imperial inscription. He bestowed upon Laozi the honorific *Xuanyuan Emperor* and upon his sacred mother the title *Xiantian Dasheng Empress*. In the fourth year of the *Yifeng* era, he urged the establishment of a purification rite at the Luoyang sacred temple. Laozi descended upon the altar, his auspicious light shimmering, riding a white horse with crimson mane, his footprints imprinted upon the altar stones. Witnessed by all, the event was promptly memorialized, inspiring the celebratory memorial: *“Golden countenance and jade rays outshine the glow of night; the white steed’s vermilion mane leaves traces in the courtyard of heaven’s steeds.”* This appears in the memorial of Gentleman for Court Audience Sun Rui.

In the first year of Empress Wu’s *Wenming* era, *jiashen*, Lord Lao descended upon Huangtian Plain in Haozhou and commanded Hao Yuanzong to convey that Empress Wu must not usurp the mandate. This is recorded in the *Tang Sacred Records*.

In the first year of Emperor Xuanzong’s *Kaiyuan* era, *guichou*, and again in the seventeenth year, Lord Lao descended upon Xinxing Temple in Shuzhou. Entering the Buddhist hall, he concealed himself within a pillar, his form emerging as if carved, becoming clearer with each washing. Local civil and military officials, along with Daoists, Buddhists, monks, and nuns, jointly memorialized the event, stating: *“Manifested within the temple pillar, its age as elusive as history’s annals; its brilliance dazzles the Buddhist hall, akin to the days of the Huahu transformation.”* This is recorded in the memorial of Zhang Jingzhong, Chief Administrator of Yizhou.

In the twenty-ninth year of the *Kaiyuan* era, Lord Lao descended outside Danfeng Gate and spoke to Tian Tongxiu: “Long ago, as I journeyed into the Flowing Sands, I concealed a golden casket of sacred talismans in Yin Xi’s former residence. Report this to the emperor so he may retrieve it.” The emperor dispatched envoys, who recovered it from the ruins of the Hangu Pass. This appears in the *Tang History*.

In the eighth year of the *Tianbao* era, the honorific *Taishang Xuanyuan Emperor* was bestowed upon the sacred ancestor Lord Lao. In the ninth year, *gengyin*, Lord Lao descended upon Mount Taibai and spoke to the mountain recluse Wang Xuanyi: “The Precious Immortal Grotto holds a wondrous treasure talisman. Report this to the emperor so he may retrieve it.” The emperor commanded Minister of Justice Zhang Jun and others to retrieve it, and they indeed obtained it. This appears in the *Tang History*.

In the thirteenth year, *jiawu*, the emperor paid homage at the Supreme Clarity Palace and further bestowed upon Lord Lao the honorific *Great Sacred Ancestor, Supreme Highest Dao, Golden Gate of Mystery, Primordial Heavenly Sovereign, August Emperor*. This is recorded in the historical annals.

In the second year of Emperor Suzong’s *Zhide* era, *dingyou*, Lord Lao descended upon Yunlong Crag in Tonghua Commandery, his form bridging earth and heaven, his majestic presence resplendent. An imperial edict ordered the event depicted, and Emperor Xuanzong composed a eulogy: *“By day he manifests his wondrous form, auspicious hues floating in the void; Daoists, Buddhists, humans, and devas bow in reverence. By imperial command, his image is rendered in brilliant colors and displayed throughout the commanderies.”* This appears in Emperor Xuanzong’s *Preface to the Auspicious Image Eulogy*.

In the tenth year of Emperor Yizong’s *Xiantong* era, *jichou*, Pang Xun led over three thousand men in an attempt to seize the Supreme Clarity Palace. At the time, over a thousand officials and commoners had taken refuge in the palace. All witnessed Lord Lao soaring through the sky, whereupon a black mist descended, causing the rebels to lose their way and trample one another. Pang Xun drowned in the chaos. This is recorded in the memorial of Li Wei, Military Commissioner of Bianzhou.

In the seventh year of Emperor Zhenzong of Song’s *Dazhong Xiangfu* era, *jiayin*, the emperor visited Bozhou and paid homage at the Supreme Clarity Palace. Personally presenting the imperial inscription and treasure, he bestowed upon Laozi the honorific *Taishang Laojun, Hunyuan Shangde Emperor*. This appears in the *Veritable Records of the Song Dynasty*.

In the second year of Emperor Huizong’s *Zhenghe* era, *renchen*, Lord Lao, riding a white steed and borne upon auspicious clouds, descended upon the Jade Dawn Abbey and bestowed upon Master Liang the *Jiaju Tian Tong Huming Miaojing* (Augmented Scripture of the Heavenly Youth’s Wondrous Protection of Life). This event was recorded separately.

Other apparitions and manifestations, where records do not specify the era, as well as instances of radiant emanations, auspicious omens, dream revelations, prophetic utterances, and miraculous validations—excluding those involving the descent of his transformed body—are not recounted here.

The *Upper Scroll of A Brief History of the Supreme Primordial Laozi* concludes.
**Middle Scroll of A Brief History of the Supreme Primordial Laozi**
Compiled by the Daoist of Mount Lu’s Qingxu Hermitage, your servant Xie Shoubin

The Supreme Lord Lao is the ancestor of primordial *qi*, the origin of the myriad Dao, the root of Heaven and Earth, and the essence-source of the cosmos. Within the boundless chaos of the Great Void, he coalesced the true nature of spontaneity as his body—vast and without limit, responsive and unfathomable in transformation. Neither *yin* nor *yang*, he is both subtle and manifest; neither ancient nor modern, neither abiding nor perishing. At the inception of countless *kalpas*, before the *Tai Chu* (Great Beginning) and *Tai Yi* (Great Simplicity), he first spread the Primordial Mystery and gave rise to the *Tai Ji* (Supreme Ultimate). From the *Tai Ji* he divided the Three Powers; at the end of the *kalpa*, he reabsorbed the Six Directions into primordial chaos as one.

Once more, he divided and condensed the light and pure to form Heaven, accumulated the heavy and turbid to form Earth. The essence of *yang* became the sun; the essence of *yin* became the moon. The essences of the sun and moon became the stars. They revolve through the four seasons and eight solar terms, securing and stabilizing the famous mountains and great rivers. When the Two *qi* interact, the myriad beings of movement and stillness mutually generate and transform.

Initially, from the One *qi* arose the Three *qi*, which combined to produce the Nine *qi*, forming the Nine Heavens.
**Annotation:** The *qi* of spontaneity generates the *Yu Shan* Heaven, *Chan Shan* Heaven, and *Xu Yan* Heaven—these are born of the *qi* of pure harmony. The *qi* of the *Yu Yu* Heaven generates the *Dou Shu* Heaven, *Bu Jiao Le* Heaven, and *Dong Yuan* Heaven. The *qi* of the *Tai Chi* generates the *Fan Fu* Heaven, *Qing Ming* Heaven, and *Wu Xiang* Heaven. Thus, the Three *qi* of the Primordial Mystery each give rise to three heavens below, totaling Nine Heavens. Each of these Nine Heavens further generates three heavens below, forming the Thirty-Six Heavens. Beyond these lie the various Brahma Heavens, all subordinate to the lords of the Nine Heavens.

Next arise the Four Kindred Heavens, also called the Seed Heavens, referring to those who descended as the seed of humanity at the beginning of the *kalpa*. The Buddhists call these the Four Dhyāna Heavens. Above, this heaven draws from the Three Pure Realms, three hundred million *hei* below; below, it generates the Eight Brahma Heavens, fifty-five million five hundred fifty-five thousand *hei*—each *hei* spanning three thousand *li*. This heaven exists beyond the Three Realms, transcending the reckoning of *yin* and *yang*; thus, it has no limit of years or lifespan, and the Three Disasters of water, fire, and wind cannot harm it.

Next, the Three Realms are divided: the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. Then follow the Eight Brahma Heavens: *Shi Qing* Heaven, *Qing Yuan* Heaven, *Shi Dan* Heaven, *Da Dan* Heaven, *Niang Su* Heaven, *Da Su* Heaven, *Shi Xuan* Heaven, and *Da Xuan* Heaven.

Next is the human world, comprising: the Pure and Tranquil World of the North, the Everlasting Peace World of the Northeast, the Receptive Virtue World of the East, the Employing Worthies World of the Southeast, the Renouncing Worthies World of the South, the Benevolent and Tranquil World of the Southwest, the Pure Conduct World of the West, and the Extending Worthies World of the Northwest.

Below are the Nine Earths:
1. The *Lei Se Run* Earth,
2. The *Lei Gang Se* Earth,
3. The *Zhi Se* Earth,
4. The *Run Ze* Earth,
5. The *Jin Su* Earth,
6. The *Jin Gang Ze* Earth,
7. The *Shui Zhi* Earth,
8. The *Feng Ze* Earth,
9. The *Lei Dong Yuan Wu Se Gang Wei* Earth.

Each layer emerges above the last, with one layer of water and one layer of wind, descending from above. At the end of the great *kalpa*, above the Nine Earths to the Formless Realm, the Three Disasters arise, and the myriad forms dissolve. Above the Seed People, the disasters do not reach. The primordial *hei* reunites, and the *kalpa* returns to chaos. When the *kalpa* unfolds anew, the people of this heaven are once more commanded to descend as the seed of humanity, entering the world to enact transformation—as rulers and ministers, establishing laws and institutions, mutually instructing and guiding, just as at the beginning of this *kalpa*. Through countless vast *kalpas*, all proceeds thus.

Beyond Heaven and Earth, the likeness resembles a chicken’s egg, with the primordial *hei* surrounding it like the halo of the sun. For details, see the *Hun Yuan Tu of the Unified Realm*, the *Scripture of Heaven’s Opening*, and the *Hun Tian Yi* and other texts. Thus, each Heaven and Earth possesses five hundred five million five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred layers, and within each, Heavenly patterns and Earthly principles are established, *yin-yang* and the Five Phases are set in motion, spirits and deities are arrayed, and the myriad beings are produced—grasping the handle of generation and completion, securing the source of creation and transformation.

Therefore, in Heaven, he is the most revered among all sages; in the world, he is the master of all teachings. Before the revolutions of *kalpas*, he enacts transformation; after the end of all things, he eternally abides. The Dao governs the world, opening the mysterious and penetrating the profound—thus, he is titled the *Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Mystery’s Three Black Supreme Lord Lao*.

Laozi is but one of his manifested forms. Since his manifestations are not singular, his titles are boundless: sometimes thirty-six titles, sometimes seventy-two names; or the *Nine Heavens’ August Emperor*, the *Lord of the Cavern-Realm’s Imperial Unity*, the *Supreme Jade Emperor*, the *Grand Monad of Great Peace and True Primordiality, Wondrous Black August Lord*, the *Nine Mysteries’ Emperor*, the *Dharma King of the Great Thousand*, the *Nine Numinous Laozi*, the *Nine Mysteries’ Emperor*, the *Supreme Left Mysterious Perfected*, the *Great Master of the Wondrous Scripture of the Golden Portal of Highest Purity*, the *Great Dharma King of the Supreme*, the *Primordial Unity’s True Stabilizing Light*, the *Golden Portal’s Later Sage Lord*, the *Supreme Peace’s Upper Radiance Lord*, the *Father of Non-Action*, the *Mother of the Myriad Things*.

At the time of his descent into the world, the gods of the ten directions praised him in midair, bestowing ten honorifics: *Supreme Lord Lao*, *Highest Laozi*, *Heavenly August Emperor*, *Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center*, *Ancient Great Master*, *Golden Portal’s Emperor*, *Supreme High Emperor*, *Great Perfected of the Void*. Additionally, there are titles such as *Utmost Perfected*, *Limitless*, *Great Dao*, *Spontaneity*, *Primordial Beginning*, *Supreme*, *Heavenly Worthy*, *Dao Lord*, *Unsurpassed*, *Heavenly Perfected*, *Primordial Elder*, *Heavenly Master*, *Yellow Emperor and Laozi*, *Master of the Age*, *Mysterious Ancestor*, *Divine Person*, *Perfected*, *Immortal*, *Utmost Person*, *Great Person*, *Dao Sage*—and above these, two-character titles.

When descending into the mortal world, he bore nine names and courtesy names: his name was *Er* with the courtesy name *Boyang*; his name was *Ya* with the courtesy name *Bozong*; his name was *Zhi* with the courtesy name *Boguang*; his name was *Shi* with the courtesy name *Menggong*; his name was *Zhong* with the courtesy name *Zifu*; his name was *Ding* with the courtesy name *Yuanyang*; his name was *Yuan* with the courtesy name *Boshi*; his name was *Xian* with the courtesy name *Yuansheng*; and his name was *De* with the courtesy name *Bowen*. Some call him *Boyangfu*—*Lao* being a term of veneration for the aged.

In the first year of *Shanghe*, on the *gengyin* day of the ninth month, the fifth day, at the *mao* hour, the Lord Lao descended into the world between the Li Valley and the Gangling Mirror Mountain in the northern *Yudan* Heaven. Born in the chamber of the Nine Mysteries of the Supreme Mystery Spirit-Mother, he took the valley as his surname, bestowing upon himself the illustrious name *Hongjiu*, also called *Xuanshui*. He once said: "My names and courtesy names stretch boundlessly across kalpas, beyond full reckoning."

It is said: *Shanghe* is an era name of the heavens, akin to *Chiming*, *Zhuling*, *Qinghan*, *Tianhan*, *Kaihuang*, and *Shanghuang*. Yet worldly scholars, knowing only that the *jiazi* cycle was devised by *Danao* and that era names began with Emperor Wu of Han, dismiss *Shanghe* and the like as fabrications. They do not realize that the heavens have recorded eras since countless kalpas past, unknown to mortals. Only figures like *Guiguzi*, *Beiguozi*, the Han Celestial Master, and *Ge Xianweng* later aligned celestial era names with human history. Otherwise, how could the immortals—versed in ancient and modern lore, probing the profound and subtle—be unaware that era names did not exist before Qin and Han?

Moreover, from the dawn of creation, the establishment of laws and the evolution of dynasties were all predestined by heaven, which periodically sent perfected beings to transmit teachings to the world. Mortals cannot precede heaven in initiating transformation. Scholars should ponder this deeply.

The Lord Lao, the Cavernous Sage of the Utmost Perfection, oversees the myriad transformations. Thus, he alters his names and titles, humbles his virtue, and descends in transformed bodies, traversing all directions. He upholds the world and establishes teachings, sometimes as a sovereign, sometimes as a mentor or friend, engaging in dialogue and mutual enlightenment. He reveals the numinous texts of spontaneity, expounds the essentials of non-action, and enacts scriptures, charts, precepts, and disciplines in accordance with the times. From the hidden to the void, he experiences all, preaching and transforming nations, subduing drought demons. At times, he ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Beginning, or visits the Jade Dawn. He reviews the Nine Palaces, presiding over gods, perfected beings, immortals, and sages, and governs all divine officials, ghostly functionaries, and the bureaus of immortal grottoes and blessed sustenance in the Three Realms. Nothing is too obscure for his illumination, and none fail to look up to his authority.

At times, he descends to govern the Ten Heavens and care for the multitudes, then he is the Heavenly August Emperor of *Taiwei*, *Gouchen*, and the Purple Chamber—specifically, the imperial seat among the six stars of *Gouchen*. In spring, he transforms into the *Shangjing* Lord, towering nine thousand *zhang*, wearing a crown adorned with the Seven Treasures of Essence. Clad in a black and yellow robe, a flying skirt of azure brocade, he holds a tiger tally and sits upon a seven-colored cloud. In summer, he appears as an old man, donning a crown of flying dragons, a robe of dark patterns, a yellow-feathered skirt, holding a golden branch, standing upon a purple cloud. In autumn, he becomes a youth in five-colored garments, sometimes riding a lion, sometimes seated on a green cloud. In winter, he manifests within a radiance of azure, black, and green, a luminous chaos intertwining—this is the refinement of the essence of the Dark Pass of the Golden Portal, further tempered by the essence of the Mysterious Dawn.

With boundless spiritual freedom, he can be white or black, square or round, bent or straight, strong or weak, light or heavy, short or tall, old or young, high or deep. He is limitless in transformation, reversing and overturning all things. Sometimes he appears as the One Thousand Two Hundred *Laozi* across the heavens, or as the One Hundred Eighty *Dao* Lords to guide the mortal realm, scattering his spirit and dispersing his light, swiftly pervading all. Yet his true unified body remains serene and eternally quiescent, ever abiding in the Great Clarity Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.

During the era of the first Three Sovereigns, he was known as the *Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center*, descending to teach. After nine thousand one hundred million years, the kalpa turned, and the Primordial Beginning was reestablished—this marked the end of the *Longhan* and *Yankang* kalpas. Before *Yankang*, records are beyond retrieval; only with the *Chiming* era and the unfolding of charts do scriptures become traceable.

In the middle era of the Three Sovereigns, during the *Chiming* years, he was called the *Ancient Great Master*, bestowing the *Inner Text of the Three Sovereigns* to teach. After nine thousand nine hundred million years, the kalpa turned again. In the later era of the Three Sovereigns—during the reigns of the Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, and Human Sovereign—it was the *Quehuang* year of the *Sheti* cycle. He established positions, aligning the Four Seas with the Four Spirits and the Five Phases with the Five Emperors, and bestowed the *Five Numinous, Five Elder, and Five-Chapter True Writ of the Numinous Treasure* to teach, spanning ten thousand eight hundred years.

When the Great Simplicity of *Fuxi* gradually dissipated and laws were yet unestablished, he descended to the fields, known as *Yuhua Zi*, bestowing the *Inner Text of the Heavenly Sovereign* and revealing the *River Chart* of the divine turtle and the Eight Trigrams. During the time of *Zhurong*, he descended upon Mount Heng, known as *Guangshou Zi*, bestowing the *Inner Text of the Human Sovereign* and teaching the Way of pacifying spirits, instructing the crafting of vessels to transform raw food. In the era of *Shennong*, he descended to Jiyin, known as *Dacheng Zi*, bestowing the *Inner Text of the Earthly Sovereign* and teaching the Way of cherishing life, instructing the cultivation of grains and fruits to replace cooking and killing, and the blending of medicines to cure illnesses and nurture nature.

The *Records of Rites* and *Yihao Ji* do not list *Zhurong* after *Shennong*; their commentaries place *Zhurong* before *Shennong* as the ancestor of the Flame Emperor, who ruled by the virtue of fire. There is no need to transpose him after *Shennong*. Here, we follow the records as correct, though later he was also moved to serve as the Fire Minister, known as *Zhurong*.

In the era of the Yellow Emperor, he descended upon Mount Kongtong, known as *Guangcheng Zi*. In the twenty-ninth year of the Emperor’s reign, troubled by the disorder of the world, he went to see *Guangcheng Zi* and inquired: “I have heard that you have attained the supreme Dao. I wish to gather the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people, and to observe the workings of yin and yang to ensure timely growth. How may this be done?”

*Guangcheng Zi* replied: “What you ask concerns the substance of things, and what you wish to observe is their decay. Since you began ruling the world, clouds no longer gather before rain falls, grasses and trees wither before they yellow, and the light of the sun and moon has dimmed. How can one such as you, with the glib tongue of a flatterer, speak of the supreme Dao?”

The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished his rule over the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and approached with the wind at his back, crawling on his knees. He bowed twice, prostrating himself, and asked: “I have heard that you have attained the supreme Dao. I venture to ask: how may one cultivate the body to attain longevity?”

*Guangcheng Zi* rose with a frown and said: “Excellent is your question! Come, I shall tell you. The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its utmost limit is dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will naturally align itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not disturb your essence. Reduce thought, curb desire, and you may attain long life. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing, and your spirit will guard your form—thus shall you live long. Guard your inner self, restrain your outer conduct; excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I shall guide you to the source of great brightness, the origin of utmost yang, and lead you through the gate of profound obscurity, the origin of utmost yin. Heaven and earth have their manifestations, yin and yang have their repositories. Guard your body well, and all things will flourish of themselves. I preserve the One and dwell in harmony; thus have I cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, and my form has never declined.”

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and prostrated himself, saying: “You are as the heavens themselves.”

*Guangcheng Zi* said to the Emperor: “Come, I shall tell you more. The nature of things is boundless, yet people deem them finite; their depths are unfathomable, yet people consider them limited. Those who attain my Dao may ascend as sovereigns or descend as kings; those who lose it may glimpse light above but become dust below. Now, all living things arise from the earth and return to it. Therefore, I shall leave you and enter the gate of the boundless, to wander the fields of the infinite. I shall share the radiance of the sun and moon, and stand eternal with heaven and earth.”

Thereupon, he bestowed upon the Emperor the *Classic of Yin and Yang*.

Later, during the era of the Three Sovereigns, *Lao Jun* expounded scriptures, which the world called the *Three Tombs*—though their complete texts have long been lost. Across generations, the scriptures expounded have often been concealed in jade towers and jasper caskets, or hidden in the Dragon Palace and the Sea Treasury, guarded by divine immortals, so that the world has seldom heard of them. What remains in transmission today is but a fragment from Mount Tai, a mere trifle.

He also commanded the Queen Mother of the West to bestow upon the Emperor the jade image of the *Original Celestial Worthy*. The Emperor placed it in a lofty *guan*. The ancients called high terraces *guan*, from which one could survey the four directions. The term *Daoist abbey* (*guan*) originated here.

*Lao Jun* instructed the Emperor to go to Mount Wangwu, open a stone casket, and retrieve a jade tablet, whereupon he obtained the Way of the Nine Cauldrons, the divine elixir, and the furnace fire of flying snow. Thereupon, he cast the cauldrons at Mount Jing, refined the elixir, and consumed it. Clouds and dragons came to welcome him, and the Emperor ascended on a dragon. At that time, seventy-two of his ministers and attendants also ascended to heaven. Those who could not follow grasped at the dragon’s whiskers, and as they fell, they seized the Emperor’s bow and cauldron, clinging to them and weeping. The world later called this the *Wailing Crow Bow*. The people, having no one to venerate, took his relics and buried them at Mount Ba, calling it *Baling*. They also built a mausoleum at Mount Qiao, burying his robes and cap there. The place where the cauldron fell was called *Dinghu*.

According to the *Jade Weft Classic*: some refer to the Three Sovereigns, while others speak of the Nine Sovereigns. The *Great Possession Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit* states that each of the Three Sovereigns ruled for three thousand six hundred years. The *Lesser Possession Scripture* states that each of the Three Sovereigns ruled for eighteen thousand eight hundred years. Examining these two accounts: the *Great Possession Scripture* refers only to one generation of Three Sovereigns, each ruling for three thousand six hundred years. The *Lesser Possession Scripture* speaks of three generations of Three Sovereigns, each ruling for eighteen thousand eight hundred years. If we consider three generations of Nine Sovereigns in total, the sum would be thirty-two thousand four hundred years. Some texts say eighteen thousand years, likely due to a scribal error where *bai* (hundred) was mistaken for *qian* (thousand). Now, according to the *Inner Tradition of Laozi*, the figures align with those in the *Great Possession* and *Lesser Possession* scriptures. As for the earlier Three Sovereigns and the middle Three Sovereigns, each ruling for ninety-nine billion myriad years, this refers to the vast measure of a kalpa, not merely the lifespans of the Three Sovereigns themselves.

Later accounts of the Three Sovereigns vary widely. The *Cavernous Spirit Scripture* and the *Jade Weft Classic*, along with *Xiang Jun*, identify the Three Sovereigns as the Heavenly Sovereign, the Earthly Sovereign, and the Human Sovereign. *Huangfu Mi*’s commentary on the *Spring and Autumn Annals: Turning of the Dipper*, as well as *Zheng Xuan* and *Gao You*’s annotations on the *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, identify them as *Fuxi*, *Nüwa*, and *Shennong*. The *Records of Rites* and the *Yihao Ji* consider them *Xuanyou*, *Zhurong*, and *Shennong*. The *White Tiger Discourses* identify them as *Fuxi*, *Shennong*, and *Suiren*. *Liao Shi* identifies them as *Youchao*, *Suiren*, and *Yiqi*. The *Imperial Genealogy*, the *Central Classic*, the *Records of the Northern Frontier*, and the *Records of Laixiang* identify them as *Fuxi*, *Shennong*, and *Zhurong*.

During the era of *Shaohao*, he was known as *Suiying Zi* and expounded the *Classic of Reverent Serenity*, teaching the Way of following the seasons and enacting decrees. During the era of *Zhuanxu*, he descended upon Mount Heng, known as *Chijing Zi*, and expounded the *Classic of Subtle Words*, teaching the Way of great compliance.

In the era of *Diyu*, he was known as *Lutu Zi* and transmitted the *Classic of the Yellow Court*, teaching the Way of purity and harmony. During the time of Emperor Shun, he descended upon Heyang, known as *Yin Shou Zi*, and transmitted the *Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, teaching the Way of non-action. In the age of Xia Yu, he descended upon Mount Shang, known as *Zhenxing Zi*, teaching the Way of diligence and frugality, and bestowing the *Nine Categories of the Numinous Writ*, the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Numinous Treasure*, the true writs for flood control, and the methods of pacing the stars and summoning ghosts and spirits. To this day, remnants of these teachings remain in the grotto-heavens of this mountain.

In the era of Shang Tang, he descended upon Mount Qian, known as *Xi Ze Zi*, and expounded the *Classic of Longevity*. The site of the Dragon Hall before the Heaven-Blessed Temple is where he once dwelled, teaching the Way of reverence and compassion.

*Baopuzi* composed the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*, placing it first among the teachings of the world, yet he later doubted whether the same figure had served as teacher to successive emperors, claiming that such accounts appeared only in fragmentary texts and not in the orthodox scriptures of transcendence. He further argued that it was inconceivable for one to abandon exalted status for humility, to turn from clarity to impurity, or to forsake celestial office for mortal rank. He also remarked: "Where there is heaven and earth, there are those who practice the Daoist arts—such figures appear in every age. Why must it always be the same Laozi?" These are merely the views of latecomers to learning, shallow-minded scholars who delight in the strange and extraordinary.

Master Yin Wencao of the Tang-era Haotian Abbey countered: *Baopu* compiled his biographies with the intent to illuminate and instruct. The *Record of Lord Lao* was composed to guide and inspire later generations, urging them to strive diligently. The accounts of his serving as teacher to emperors through the ages are drawn from the *Classic of the Great Mystery*, the *Orthodox Unity Scripture*, the *Great Clarity Scripture*, the *Jade Calendar Scripture*, the *Primal Darkness Scripture*, the *Records of the Northern Frontier*, the *Yin Clan’s Records of the Mysterious Center*, and the *Geographical Records of Mount Cui*—all authentic scriptures and reliable histories. How can they all be dismissed as fragmentary texts?

*Baopuzi* further claimed: "If Laozi were a man who attained the Dao, others could strive to do the same. But if he were a divine being, such attainment would be impossible." This is merely *Baopuzi*’s private opinion, for he fails to recognize that from the very beginning of creation, those who attained the Dao through study must first have had a natural sage descend to serve as their teacher, transmitting the teachings in accordance with their capacity. The *Scripture of Fixed Resolve* states: "In ancient times, the Heavenly Worthy created and transformed, acting in accord with spontaneity, obscurely aligning with principle, and spontaneously achieving profound enlightenment. From the original black script, he compiled and composed the scriptures." Thus, in later ages, Lord Lao naturally embodied the Dao and served as teacher in every era—what doubt could there be?

As the father of great compassion and non-action, why would he refuse to set aside exalted status for humility or to harmonize with the impure? Lord Lao said to Yin Xi: "From the earliest ages, the changes I have undergone are like grains of sand. Each movement spans kalpas, and I have endured great toil." The *Classic of the Great Mystery* also states: "Laozi accumulated learning through countless transformations, ascending to the rank of supreme sage. His responses were boundless, beyond all description." In more recent ages, he manifested and transformed, being born at the end of the Yin dynasty. Thus, *Wenshi*, *Guigu*, *Zhang Zhen*, and *Ge Xian* all declared: "Lord Lao existed before the Great Void, traversing heaven and earth in ways beyond reckoning." These are the teachings of true transcendents who attained the Dao in former lives, expounded in accordance with the scriptures—how could they be the hasty opinions of latecomers to learning?

*Baopu* sought to force his private views into acceptance, unaware that he was slandering the ancestral founder and the true teachings. This is but one blind spot in an otherwise learned man—his words cannot be relied upon.

Though Lord Lao appeared in response to each era, there was no record of his birth. Wishing to harmonize with the world and establish its teachings, he first commanded the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden to descend and become the daughter of the Yin clan of Tianshui—a manifestation of the Supreme Primordial Sovereign, later honored by the Tang dynasty as the Primordial Sovereign of Former Heaven. Her name was Yishou, and she married the transcendent Li Lingfei. Lingfei was a descendant of Li Jutao. By the time of the Shang dynasty, father and son had inherited the practice of the true Dao. His father, Qingbin, lived over a hundred years yet retained a youthful appearance, wandering among the Five Marchmounts. One day, clouds and dragons descended to welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Inspired by his father’s ascension, Lingfei withdrew from worldly office and devoted himself to cultivating the great Dao. He, too, lived over a hundred years, and before Lord Lao’s birth, he ascended to heaven. In the seventeenth year of King Yangjia’s reign during the eighteenth generation of the Shang dynasty—the gengshen year—Lord Lao divided his body from the Great Clarity realm, riding the essence of the sun and driving a nine-dragon chariot. He transformed into a five-colored flowing pearl, descending into the mouth of the Mysterious Wondrous Maiden to be conceived. At that time, the Yin maiden was napping and dreamed that the sky opened for several *zhang*, and a host of transcendents bore the sun forth. After a long while, the sun gradually shrank and fell from the sky as a five-colored pearl, round as a pellet. She cupped it in her hands and swallowed it, awakening to find herself with child. To this day, the site of the falling star remains at the Tianjing Abbey in Bozhou.

Her complexion grew ever more youthful, and her spirit was serene. In the chamber where she dwelled, the four seasons were harmonious, the six *qi* balanced. Winter brought no biting cold, summer no oppressive heat. Auspicious light filled the room, numinous energy suffused the courtyard, no evil could intrude, and a myriad spirits stood guard.

For eighty-one years, the passage of time felt unnoticed. In the ninth year of King Wuding of the Shang, the gengchen year, on the fifteenth day of the second month—reckoned by the Zhou calendar as the first month, though by the Xia calendar this was the true first month—the sagely mother grasped a plum tree and suddenly gave birth from beneath her left armpit. At that moment, the sun’s radiance doubled in brilliance, auspicious clouds filled the courtyard, ten thousand cranes soared in the sky, and the Four Numinous Beasts stood in resplendent guard. Jade maidens knelt to receive him, while nine dragons spat water to bathe his sacred form. Where the dragons emerged, nine wells formed. These remain at the Taiqing Abbey in Bozhou; when one well is drawn from, all nine stir in response.

After his birth, he took nine steps, and with each step a lotus blossomed beneath his feet. Pointing to the plum tree, he declared it his surname. It is said: In kalpas past, the Venerable Lord was often born in the Li Valley of the Northern Mystery Jade Realm, taking Li as his surname. Now, once more descending into a Li family, beneath a plum tree, he knew his surname at birth and thus pointed to declare it—not that he had only now adopted the surname Li.

Old records state: At his birth, the Venerable Lord took nine steps, turned his gaze to the four directions, pointed to heaven with his left hand and to earth with his right, and proclaimed, “Between heaven and earth, I alone am supreme.” This humble one respectfully disagrees. Though the Venerable Lord is the supreme one of the Three Realms, his teachings are founded upon humility, kindness, and yielding weakness. He would never arrogantly rely on qi to boast of his greatness.

Moreover, Śākyamuni was born in the violent and unruly lands of the Western Regions. Though the Buddhist teachings existed at that time, patricide and matricide were regarded as commonplace. Had a newborn prince uttered such insolent words, the barbarian king would surely have said, “This child, born so soon, knows no lord or father—what will he become when grown? Can such a one be tolerated and raised?” He would have been killed and cast aside without doubt. Thus, it is clear that such words should never have been attributed to him. For this reason, they have now been expunged.

His given name was *Yǒng*, meaning "keen of hearing." The Venerable Lord’s ears were level, his crown broad and thick, his face firm, with a pendant pearl below and three apertures within—a countenance of celestial divinity, utterly unlike that of ordinary men. Hence, he was styled *Yǒng*. Some write it as *Yán*, but this is a graphic error; others as *Dān*, but this is a phonetic corruption. Some claim he stuck out his tongue and spoke inarticulately, calling it *chǐ* ("shame"), but this is yet another error of hearsay.

He dwelt in Qūrén Village of Lài Township, Kǔ County, Chén State, on the northern bank of the Guō River. Some say he was born in Chǔ State, but the land borders Chǔ, for it was the first fief of Xióng Yì. Others call it Xiāngrén or Qiáorén, likely because Bó lay north of Tóngchéng, and forty *lǐ* east of the Lài River stood the old city of Qiáo. The township’s name, *Lài*, also derives from the river. Chén was the site of the great howl, beside the mound of Wǎnqiū, where the *Yù Gòng* divides the waters of Yuè and Yù. King Wu enfeoffed Hú Gōng Mǎn, a descendant of Shùn, there, and thus it was called Chén State. In the time of Emperor Zhāng of the Later Hàn, it was renamed Chén Commandery, and today it is Bó Prefecture, the former capital of Tāng the Completer.

Kǔ County was renamed Zhēnyuán County in the first year of the *Táng Fēng* era, and today it is Wèizhēn County.

Nine days after his birth, his body underwent nine transformations. In the first, he grew to six *chǐ* and six *cùn* in height, wore a crown adorned with fish and magpies, and was clad in a robe of eight colors—yellow and purple—embroidered with phoenixes and beast patterns, all emerging naturally from the primordial chaos.

In the second transformation, he grew to seven *chǐ* and seven *cùn* in height, wore a layered crown, and was clad in plain robes with red collars and cuffs. In the third, he reached eight *chǐ* and eight *cùn*, wore a *Tongtian* crown, and was dressed in five-colored robes. In the fourth, he stood nine *chǐ* and nine *cùn*, wore a *Pixie* crown, and was robed in gauze woven with cassia. In the fifth, he grew to one *zhàng* and three *cùn*, wore a dragon-and-serpent crown, and was clad in crimson robes. In the sixth, he reached one *zhàng* and five *cùn*, wore the *Wuji* crown, and was dressed in robes of vermilion jade. In the seventh, he stood one *zhàng* and seven *cùn*, wore the *Xuwu* crown, and was clad in black, multicolored, and diaphanous robes. In the eighth, he grew to one *zhàng* and one *chǐ*, wore the great *Pixie* crown, and was robed in dragon-and-serpent patterns. In the ninth, he reached one *zhàng* and two *chǐ*, wore the *Ziran* crown—ever-changing in an instant—and was clad in natural feathered robes. All were celestial crowns and celestial robes, naturally adorning his form.

He bore the seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. The seventy-two marks were these: his crown was round as heaven, his face radiant as the sun, his coiled hair rising like the dawn, his jade-like nape arched and lofty, his hoary hair white as a crane’s, over seven *chǐ* in length. His brows resembled the Northern Dipper, their hue emerald-green. His beard was tiger-like, his whiskers dragon-like, pure as untangled silk. His ears bore hanging pearls, with three openings within, high and level as his crown, thick and firm. His eyes shone like sunlight, with square pupils and green veins. His nose had twin pillars, its bridge prominent. His mouth was square as the sea, his lips red as cinnabar. His breath was purple-hued, fragrant as orchids. His teeth were like strung cowries, firm as silver, thirty-two in number, even and aligned. His tongue was long and broad, patterned like brocade. His voice was like jade, its resonance like gold. His forehead rose high, his jaw square as a carpenter’s square, his temples like the sun and moon, his visage golden, his bearing jade-like. His dragon-like countenance was solemn, his phoenix-like gaze serene. His forehead bore the trigram *duì*, ascending to *cān* and *wǔ*. His celestial court was level and vast, his golden coffer full. His cheeks bore white moles, his jaw a jade pellet, his neck three folds, his crane-like neck pure and upright. His arms hung past his knees, his hands bore ten lines, his fingers long and slender, each with talon-like nails and cloud-patterned nails. His body was covered in green down, his chest bore the *yǎn* bone, his back the *Hékuí* star. His navel was over an inch deep, his belly soft as silk. His heart bore brocade patterns, his abdomen a dark mole. His eyes had wheel-like veins, his feet trod the *èr tián*, his toes bore the signs of *qián* and *kūn*. His body stood one *zhàng* and two *chǐ* tall, his frame fragrant, his face square and lustrous. His three divisions—upper, middle, and lower—were like *vajra*. His appearance was like glass, his walk like a tiger’s stride, his movements like a dragon’s pursuit.

Such were his marks. To his left stood the Azure Dragon, to his right the White Tiger; before him the Vermilion Bird led the way, behind him the Dark Warrior followed. His head was crowned with purple clouds, his feet trod lotus blossoms. Atop his head rested the Two Effulgences, the Five Luminaries shone like the sun, his body bore the circular sign, illuminating the Nine Heavens. Combined with his earlier transcendent marks, their radiance and hues were wondrously fine—eighty-one in total, called the excellences.

He gestated in the womb for eighty-one years, fulfilling the number of the Great Yang. Born with a hoary head, he was thus called *Lǎo* ("Old"); the ancients addressed him as *Zǐ* ("Master"). Moreover, *zǐ* is the general term for men, hence he was called *Lǎozǐ*. Another account says: *lǎo* denotes longevity, *zǐ* the title of a youth; wishing to call him "old" yet seeing him newly born, wishing to call him "youth" yet beholding his white hair, thus he was named by both meanings.

Yǐn Wéncāo of the Táng wrote: *Lǎozǐ* is the very embodiment of the Dao. Though near, his aspects differ within and without, for he responds as the occasion demands, and thus his forms may vary. His inner titles are these: *Zhìyī* ("Perfect One"), *Zhēnyī* ("True One"), *Xuányī* ("Mysterious One"), *Huángyī* ("August One"), *Yuányī* ("Primal One"), *Dìyī* ("Imperial One"), *Tàiyī* ("Supreme One"), *Tiānyī* ("Celestial One"), and *Zhèngyī* ("Orthodox One"). *Zhìyī* is subtlety without substance; *Zhēnyī* is purity and clarity; *Xuányī* is spiritual penetration without hindrance; *Huángyī* is radiance without peer; *Yuányī* is the chief of the myriad Dao; *Dìyī* is the sacred and honored of the hundred spirits; *Tàishàng* is the great lord of longevity; *Tiānyī* is the true sovereign of yin; *Zhèngyī* is the dharma-king of *Méngwēi*. These nine meanings, though differently named, all emerge from the same source. Since they are utterly profound, they are all called *One*.

His outer titles are these: *Yùhuá*, *Dàchéng*, *Guǎngshòu*, *Suíyìng*, *Chìjīng*, *Lùtú*, *Wùchéng*, *Yǐnshòu*, *Zhēnxíng*, *Xīzé*, *Xièyì*, *Yùchéng*, *Jīngchéng*, and *Guōshū* *Zǐ*. *Yùhuá* denotes the Dao’s flourishing transformation; *Dàchéng* its universal virtue; *Guǎngshòu* its abundant arts of spirit; *Guǎngchéng* its vast cultivation of life; *Suíyìng* its unimpeded responsiveness; *Chìjīng* its revered numinous cinnabar; *Lùtú* its secret accord with mandates; *Wùchéng* its fulfillment of all undertakings; *Yǐnshòu* its impartiality and robust health; *Zhēnxíng* its pure and unadulterated spirit; *Xīzé* its benevolent and methodical kindness; *Xièyì* its transformation of customs through teaching; *Yùchéng* its harmonious nurturing; *Jīngchéng* its preservation of constant instruction; *Guōshū* its purification of generations. These titles all arose from his teachings, and since he descended as the state’s teacher, the state addressed him as *Zǐ*.

After the Holy Mother gave birth to the embodiment of the Dao, she was to return to the heavenly palace to resume her position as the Primordial Sovereign. Yet wishing to show the world the way of master and disciple in transmission, she addressed the Venerable Lord, saying: "All who receive life between heaven and earth are either pure or turbid. Those of pure *qi* are wise, compassionate, and kind; those of turbid *qi* are foolish, deluded, and cruel. The enlightened cultivate to perfect their nature; the benighted indulge their desires to harm their lives. Nature is the source of the body; life is the root of nature. Thus, those who cultivate practice refining the body with the Nine Elixirs, untying the knots of the Five Spirits, guiding the black *qi* back to its origin, and severing the root at the Three Passes."

The Nine Refinements and Ten Transformations open the clarity of the hundred joints, severing the knots of the womb to extinguish them—only then does one know the original truth and ascend as an immortal of the highest rank. Without cultivation and study, demonic forces enter the body, a hundred ailments arise therefrom, premature death follows thereby, and one dies without fulfilling one’s allotted span—how grievous and unspeakable!

Immortality is born of the heart’s learning; when the heart is sincere, immortality is achieved. The Dao values inner seeking; when the inner is profound, the Dao draws near. To attain stillness and unite with the true, to accumulate emptiness and commune with the divine—then the day of attaining immortality draws near. But if the heart is restless and the spirit weary, the body troubled and the mind scattered, if movement and stillness dissipate essence, and the ears and eyes are distracted by externals, then though one may accumulate years in vain pursuit of the Dao, the Dao grows ever more distant.

Our sojourn in heaven and earth is but a fleeting moment. Yet if one can gather the black *qi* and labor the spirit, enduring hardship to infuse the true, then in time the Dao will become luminous, and one’s lodging in the vastness of heaven and earth shall be eternal. To penetrate emptiness and embody nothingness is to be unseen when looked upon, unheard when listened to—thus does one unite with the true Dao.

Laozi said: "Now, amidst the dust and chaos of the world, is it possible to attain long life and immortality, and to deliver others across the ages?"
The Primordial Sovereign replied: "I possess a secret treasure, transmitted only to the worthy. Those who cultivate it may attain everlasting life."
Laozi said: "I wish to hear of its attainment."
The Primordial Sovereign said: "The supreme Dao is abstruse and profound, beyond comprehension—neither being nor non-being, neither sound nor form. It cannot be seen, nor grasped; it encompasses heaven and earth, boundless and infinite. Though near to all existence, none can fathom it. To know its principles is to be called one of mysterious virtue."

Laozi said: "Does the Dao also have methods to attain it?"
The Primordial Sovereign said: "The Dao is the ultimate truth of emptiness and penetration; *wei* (guardian techniques) are the wondrous arts of transformation. Through methods one aids others; through cultivation one meets the Dao—then transformations become boundless. The essence of the Dao lies in non-action and spontaneity; the secrecy of its methods lies in talismans and the black elixir alone. Talismans are the numinous script of the Three Luminaries, the true pledge of heaven. The elixir is the flowering essence of the Five Phases, the refined sap of earth. The black *qi* is the harmony of yin and yang, the numinous spirit of medicinal substances. Though one may obtain a single element, the work is not complete—only with talismans and elixirs is the Dao perfected. This is my secret treasure. If you can master both, you may attain everlasting life and deliver countless beings."

Laozi said: "The body is the vessel for attaining the Dao; *qi* is the root of life. When the root is severed, life ends; when the vessel decays, the Dao departs. Now, wishing to cultivate it so that life is secured and the Dao flourishes—may I hear how this is achieved?"
The Primordial Sovereign said: "Endowed with the substance of bone and flesh, one is like the unfired clay of a potter—left unrefined, it quickly decays. If the body remains unrefined, life is brief. This is the natural principle. Even if one’s virtue surpasses all beings and one’s spirit communes with the great mystery, the body may still not escape old age and death. Why is this? It is the way of transformation, and one cannot but follow it. Only the elixir can refine the form; only talismans can summon the spirit. When the spirit returns, the heart is enlightened and nature is at ease; when the form is secure, *qi* is stabilized and life is preserved. Then, transforming *qi* into essence, one penetrates formlessness, soars through the void, and exists or perishes naturally—thus attaining everlasting life. Those who attain the Dao, though they encounter the turning of kalpas and the collapse of heaven and earth, remain untouched. This is why talismans and elixirs are prized—herein lies the reason."

Laozi said: "Those who ingest the divine elixir and attain long life—is it through the protection of the divine, or the power of the elixir?"
The Primordial Sovereign said: "The merit of long life arises from the elixir; the elixir’s completion arises from the divine. Thus, when preparing the elixir, one must rectify body and mind, avoid transgressions, and the divine will protect it—then the elixir will surely be accomplished. Once the elixir enters the mouth, life knows no end. Heaven and earth observe clearly: the Dao returns to the benevolent. The teeming masses, like moving corpses, do not believe long life can be learned, dismissing it as empty fabrication. From dawn to dusk, they pursue only the deeds of death—how can they attain long life? Indulging the heart and exhausting desires, they perish in an instant. Though a thousand gold pieces are spent on their funerals, what benefit is there? When the divine elixir and the Dao are perfected, it is not merely long life that is attained—it becomes a treasure for the world. Those who know this Dao—what need have they for the world? If one offered a kingdom in exchange for my methods, I would not transmit them to the unworthy."

Laozi bowed deeply and said: "I wish to hear its essentials."
The Primordial Sovereign then raised her gaze to heaven and let out a long whistle. Suddenly, a purple cloud descended from the sky, covering her, and within it five-colored radiance shone in all directions. The immortal Juanzi attended her. The Primordial Sovereign then produced the divine diagrams, sacred texts, and methods of transformation—formulas for the returning elixir, the sublimation of mercury, and the golden elixir of cinnabar—altogether seventy-two scrolls, which she bestowed upon Laozi.

Some say these scriptures are no longer transmitted, and those recorded in the world today lack proper lineage, half true and half false. The immortal scriptures state: "To steal the Dao without a master is like having wings but being unable to fly." The text reads:

*"For the Mysterious White, the Metal Lord is born,
The sun’s flowing pearl enters the Flowery Pond.
Within the pound, five taels of patterned fern,
Red salt and white snow form the male and female.
Five Talismans and Nine Elixirs—attain these and ascend as an immortal.
The Dao is here, yet people do not know."*

The Five Talismans are:
1. The Mysterious White,
2. The Essence of Metal,
3. The Flying Talisman,
4. The Golden Flower,
5. The Essence of the Three-Five Azure Dragon.

The Nine Elixirs are:
1. The Nine-Turned Returning Elixir of White Snow,
2. The Nine-Turned Returning Elixir of Male and Female,
3. The Nine-Turned Returning Elixir of Yellow Flower,
4. The Nine-Turned Returning Elixir of White Flower,
5. The Nine-Turned Returning Elixir of Cinnabar Flower,
6. The Nine-Turned Returning Elixir of Five Colors,
7. The Nine-Turned Returning Elixir of Clay Mercury,
8. The Nine-Turned Returning Elixir of Metal Essence,
9. The Nine-Turned Supreme Radiance Returning Elixir of the Nine Cauldrons.

Of these Nine Elixirs, obtaining even one can confer long life—there is no need for partial practice. The way of the divine elixir involves three transformations and five turns, culminating in nine.

He who obtains and ingests it becomes equal to me. Now, the herbs and plants of the earth—when buried, they rot; when boiled, they dissolve; when burned, they char. Unable to sustain their own life, how can they sustain man’s? But the substance of the Golden Elixir: when buried, it does not rot; when boiled, it does not dissolve; when burned, it does not char. The more it is refined, the more wondrous it becomes—thus it grants long life.

Know then that the Way of Divine Transcendence lies not in sacrifices and prayers to ghosts and spirits, not in guiding and stretching the limbs, not in incantations and verbose supplications, not in intense meditation or self-imposed austerities. The essential Way to long life resides in the Divine Elixir. To know it is easy; to achieve it in truth is difficult. If you can practice it, you may attain long life. This Way, once established, leads to transcendence. Even I did not master it by nature but through study.

It is further said: The superior adept who ingests it ascends to become a Transcendent Official; the middling adept who ingests it dwells upon Kunlun; the lesser adept who ingests it enjoys prolonged years in the world. You have but to devote yourself to it—my words are not empty.

Laozi bowed again, kowtowed, and prostrated himself, saying: "Having received your gracious instruction on the Way of the Nine Elixirs, I have heard that one who seeks transcendence without obtaining the Golden Liquid labors in vain. I humbly beg you to reveal its essentials."

The Primordial Sovereign replied: "A profound question indeed! The Nine Elixirs and the Golden Liquid are both Ways to ascend to heaven, yet among the Nine Elixirs, the Golden Liquid is supreme. The reason is this: those who ingest the Nine Elixirs may ascend after three years, two years, one year, half a year, a hundred days, or even sixty days—there is no fixed limit. Upon ingestion, Transcendent Officials and cloud-borne dragons may come to welcome them. But only those who ingest the Golden Elixir must possess Transcendent Bones within their bodies and Transcendent Names recorded in heaven. When the Golden Liquid enters the mouth, the body takes on the hue of purple gold, and wings instantly sprout, allowing one to ascend to heaven as a Transcendent Official.

To ingest it, one must first observe a prolonged fast and abstain from grains for a full year before ascending to heaven. Unless one’s name is inscribed in the Registers of the Mysterious and one bears the title of Deathlessness, one will never hear of the Way of the Nine Elixirs and the Golden Liquid. Its method follows the previous alchemical process: once the golden elixir is formed, it is liquified—thus the Way is complete. This is my secret treasure, comprising one thousand two hundred precepts.

In the distant kalpas before the dust of countless heavens and earths arose, I received this from the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning. Having memorialized and practiced it, I attained the rank of Supreme Primordial Sovereign. In the past, I transmitted it to the Perfected, the Great Sage, the Celestial Emperor, the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity, and the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One. Now, I bestow it upon you—strive diligently."

Laozi received the transmission and again inquired: "The teeming multitudes, by the millions, are driven to the realm of death. If this Way were widely bestowed to deliver them, how would it be?"

The Primordial Sovereign replied: "The careless masses, ensnared by glory and desire, die and are cast into stone or hurled into rivers, gone never to return—how grievous and lamentable! Yet the Dao does not act in vain; it must be received by a true person. This Way is lofty and wondrous, concealed within the Nine Mysteries. From the jeweled terraces and cloud-wreathed peaks, it is transmitted but once in ten thousand years, recorded only in the jade registers of the Mysterious. Unless one is destined by fate, possesses the bone-structure of a transcendent, and bears a name in the celestial records, one cannot hear of it. Foolish people err frequently—how could I defy heavenly decree and recklessly divulge it?"

Having spoken thus, the Primordial Sovereign declared: "My teaching is complete. I shall depart now, but I will send the Primordial Sovereign of Supreme Harmony to speak with you." With these words, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, the Five Emperors and the Supreme Perfected, arrived to escort him in an eight-scene jade carriage, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

The *Scripture of the Divine Elixirs of the Great Clarity* originates from the Supreme Primordial Sovereign. Its divine power harmonizes yin and yang, commands wind and rain, advances and retreats the Five Paths, regulates cold and heat, harnesses the nine dragons and twelve white tigers. All the transcendent beings of the world submit to its authority. The life and death of humanity are entirely subject to it—such is the effect of ingesting the elixir.

Laozi then wandered through mountains and marshes in search of divine transcendence through refinement. Passing through Mount Lao, he encountered the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One, riding a five-colored mottled unicorn, attended by dozens of officials. Laozi followed and inquired of the Way. The Primordial Sovereign replied: "The essentials of the Way lie solely in the Returning Elixir and the Golden Liquid." Thereupon, she fully transmitted the secret precepts.

In later years, on Mount Li, Laozi again met the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One and expressed gratitude for the divine elixir formula. The Primordial Sovereign said: "You are the honored overseer of transcendents, the master of the myriad Ways, the guardian of the mysterious and numinous—this is your inherent destiny. What need is there for thanks? After a hundred more years of cyclic transformation, you may proceed to the Golden Gates to receive your duties."

Laozi said: "The common people, ignorant and dying in great numbers, move my heart to tears of blood. Seeing this, I grieve deeply. Could I not bestow the divine medicine upon them all, granting them long life?"

The Primordial Sovereign replied: "The Way of life is of utmost importance. It must be bestowed only upon the greatly virtuous, the filial, the sincere, and the faithful. Heaven generates the myriad things—some good, some evil. The good are fit to live; the evil are fit to be eradicated. It is not fitting to distribute the medicine so that all may live. You already know this—do not lightly divulge it."

Laozi, recognizing that the Way of divine transcendence requires cultivation and refinement, wished to leave behind methods to encourage future generations. Thus, he practiced the wearing of talismans, the compounding of divine elixirs, and to this day, the Elixir-Refining Well remains at the Great Void Palace in Bozhou. He studied the Perfected Black, and now the palace contains the Hall of Emptiness and Non-Being, where he ingested the Black. He also practiced the methods of pacing the stars and the celestial net. Thereafter, he could ride the void, soar through the heavens, and naturally command the attendance of celestial soldiers and divine kings. With a whistle, he could summon and command, dispatching the myriad spirits, subduing demons and ghosts, severing the bonds of life and death. His body transcended water and fire, transforming in myriad ways. He could divide his form, merge with the world, emerge from being and enter non-being, attaining spiritual freedom and self-mastery.

One day, he mounted a white deer, ascended the tips of the cypress trees in the courtyard, and rose to heaven. To this day, the cypress beside the Ascension Deer remains at the Great Clarity Palace in Bozhou.

The *Sacred Record* eulogizes:
Laozi embodies quiescence, vast and boundless,
His virtue and power rooted in wondrous being.
He perfected the Dao through kalpas uncounted,
Creating and transforming the myriad heavens.
Naturally so, not through accumulated study.
Descending during the Nine Sovereigns to establish teachings,
He served as master through successive emperors.
Alone in the Purple Clarity—who preceded him?
Yet now, he humbly sought the Divine Mother to lodge as a student,
Followed the Primordial Sovereign to inquire of the Way.
He wished to reveal the mystery of the true Dao—
Without study, it cannot be achieved.
The Way of divine transcendence is lofty and rare,
Yet through cultivation, it may be attained.

Thus, he enjoined reverence for the master and esteem for virtue, preserving the feminine and embracing softness—displaying the numinous model of the supreme sages and bequeathing a wondrous paradigm to future generations. Thereby, he adapted his teachings to the moment, rewarding the good and chastising the deluded.

*Wenshi* and *Baopu* have already expounded these truths before; now, they are further eulogized hereafter.

*The Historical Account of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign Lord Lao* concludes its middle scroll.

*The Historical Account of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign Lord Lao*, final scroll.
Compiled by Daoist Xie Shoubin of Qingxu Hermitage on Mount Lu.

Initially, Lord Lao wished to establish teachings for the world, and so he demonstrated the secrets of cultivation and realization, as well as the standards for master-disciple transmission. In the first year of the Shanghuang era, on the second day of the first month, he journeyed to the Western River and surveyed the eight directions.

At that time, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning arrived in an eight-scene jade chariot, drawn by nine-colored dark dragons and three-pure flying clouds, accompanied by a procession of transcendents bearing floral banners. Lions and white cranes chanted and sang in unison as they floated through the air, gathering together above the Western River.

Lord Lao bowed deeply and entreated: "Formerly, I received the celestial script of twenty-four jade graphs, and though I grasped their text, I have not yet beheld their forms, nor fathomed their wondrous principles. Now, encountering the Merciful Venerable, I humbly pray for their completion."

Thereupon, the Celestial Venerable exhaled the *Jade Talisman of Internal Vision from the Cavernous Mystery* and bestowed it upon Lord Lao. Lord Lao bowed deeply, received the teaching, and in accordance with celestial rites, observed a prolonged fast and ingested the talisman. Within his body of the Three Divisions and Eight Scenes, the divine presence manifested, and the twenty-four graphs of golden script and jade characters illuminated the void, boundless and penetrating, naturally interwoven.

He then commanded the transcendent overseer of the graphs to depict them accordingly. Inscribed in golden script and purple characters upon cinnabar tablets and jade steles, they were thus established. From the Great Perfected Lady Wang of the Nine Radiant Lights of the Upper Prime at the Southern Culmen, the Eastern and Western Flowers, the Northern and Southern Perfected Lords, the transcendents of the Five Marchmounts, and the Perfected of Pure Emptiness—all received the true scriptures from Lord Lao.

The graphs were divided into three ranks: upper, middle, and lower.

**Upper Rank:**
1. *The Transcendents’ Bathing in the Eastern Well*
2. *The True Forms of the Five Marchmounts*
3. *The Eight Histories of the Essence of the Communicating Numinous*
4. *The Six Jia Communicating Numinous and the Nine Palaces of the Purple Chamber*
5. *The Primordial Beginning and Great Clarity*
6. *The True Way of Primal Completion*
7. *The Precious Record of the Western Ascension*

**Middle Rank:**
1. *The Transcendents’ Subtle Transformations*
2. *The Nine Numinous of Gathering Emptiness*
3. *The Nine Transformations of Heaven*
4. *The Constant Preservation and Five Guardians of Unity for Nurturing the Body*
5. *The Guarding the Spirit and Merging with the Scenery*
6. *The Quiescent Cultivation of the True and Guarding the Will*
7. *The Jade Maidens of the Lingzhi*

**Lower Rank:**
1. *The Six Yin Jade Maidens*
2. *The Nine-Nine Way of Transcendence*
3. *The Guiding and Pulling*
4. *The Cavernous Perfection and Vast Preservation*
5. *The Transformations and Concealments*
6. *The Gathering of Lingzhi and Opening of Mountains*
7. *The Bright Mirror*
8. *The Supreme Unity of the Boundless*

All emerged from the dark transformations of the Mysterious and Primordial.

Lord Lao once served as the Great Dao Lord of Jade Dawn, overseeing *The Tiger Talisman of Transcendents* and *The Pure Scripture of Wisdom*. All the divine talismans and precious chapters of *The Great Cavern Scripture of Supreme Clarity* for summoning spirits and vanquishing demons were under his charge.

These scriptures were formed from the naturally dark and flying mystery, their Way lofty and wondrous, the most venerable of all scriptures. They govern the myriad transcendents, guide and protect the host of immortals, and are concealed within the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens. Engraved upon golden tablets and inscribed in cinnabar and jade, their sacred texts are luminous.

Some are hidden within the Jade Chamber of the Numinous Capital in the Grand Tenuity, guarded by mighty beasts, drawn by white dragons, and protected by seven thousand divine tigers stationed at the jade gates. Three thousand Golden Dawn Jade Lads and three thousand Pure Numinous Jade Maidens attend the sacred texts, while hosts of transcendents offer obeisance and myriad sages pay homage.

The Supreme Dao Lord addressed Lord Lao: "At the turning of the great kalpa, the transmission of the scriptures to the highest transcendents is chosen. If none are found worthy, they remain unpassed for countless kalpas. Later seekers of transcendence, ignorant of the source of the Way, vainly exhaust their thoughts, wasting body and spirit. To seek the origin, one must return to the root; without the root, life cannot be preserved. The texts of the Shanghuang era are transmitted only to the chosen, their methods guarded in secrecy, inexpressible in words. One must follow the luminous statutes and receive them accordingly."

Lord Lao then examined the primordial origin, compiled the numinous chapters, and composed *The Three Hundred Scrolls of Precious Scriptures*, *The Seventy Chapters of Talismans and Graphs*, and *The Nine Thousand Jade Instructions*.

The Great Lord of the Eastern Sea, the Azure Lad of Fangzhu in the Azure Palace, bowed repeatedly and entreated earnestly. Moved by his sincerity, Lord Lao commanded the sealing of the fast and the swearing of the covenant, entrusting the transmission to later learners and those who would summon and unite with the true.

After receiving the precious scriptures, the Great Lord ascended to the rank of Supreme Minister. Three thousand Golden Flower Jade Maidens and three thousand Purple Dawn Jade Lads attended him. Holding the talismanic staff and wielding the banner of the numinous and demonic, he roamed the Purple Emptiness Palace and wandered the Azure Flower Chamber. He extinguished the Six Heavens in the coming kalpa, severed the myriad spirits on the grassy mountains, received later learners in the Golden Gate, reviewed the records of transcendents in Fangzhu, extended the myriad emperors in the curved hall, praised the precious instructions in the wondrous chapters, compiled the independent fasts for the true, and strictly regulated the four poles to propel the turning. He universally governed the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, the Five Marchmounts and famous mountains, and the countless myriad transcendents—none were not subject to him. The registers of life and death, even in their minutest details, were all under his purview.

Later learners seeking to receive the scriptures and cultivate the Way must first offer homage at the Golden Gate in the Azure Palace, present jade petitions to the Supreme Clarity, and have their essence and vigor examined by the Record-Keeping Jade Bureau. Only those who are diligent and sincere may receive the mysterious transmission.

Lord Lao further transmitted the teachings to the Great Void Perfected, the Red Lord of the Southern Marchmount, entrusting them to those who, having cultivated the Way in former lives, bore golden names and jade characters in the transcendent archives and were destined to become Perfected Ones.

He further transmitted the teachings to the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign and the Grand Perfected King, among others. Some were sealed within the Western Mystery Mountain and the King’s Chamber Mountain, while others were inscribed upon the golden pillars and jade walls of the Northern Chamber of the Penglai Palace. He also fashioned tablets of five-colored jade, each sealed within the stone spires of the Five Marchmounts. When the cyclical sign *renchen* arrives to announce the assembly, the Later Sage Lord shall descend, and these texts shall be brought forth to be transmitted in four cycles, teaching those of superior Perfected talent.

All who seek transcendence must seek out these writings, grasp their fundamental origin, and the Dao shall be accomplished without fail. Should one remain ignorant of the Dao’s source and the genesis of its precious instructions, it is as though one wanders in darkness—such learning lacks ancestry, fails to receive the descending Dao, and shall not prosper.

Lord Lao said: The Three Caverns’ precious scriptures are all the supreme Dao of the Three Clarities. I received them from the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, and to this day, seven hundred million kalpas have passed. Though heaven and earth rise and fall, and the ten thousand kinds are born and perish, I alone remain exalted. Even now, I cultivate them above the Auspicious Clouds. I once brought forth the Mysterious Tablets of Jade Clarity and transmitted them to the Perfected Duke in the Heaven of Immeasurable Longevity, and further to the Azure Lad of the Square Cauldron. According to the ranks of the Nine Heavens, they emerge but once in ten thousand kalpas. Since the era of the Opening of the August, they have been transmitted to later learners destined to become Perfected Ones—once every nine thousand years, three may receive them. If forty meet within nine years and the right person appears, they may be transmitted all at once.

Those who wish to receive my scriptures must, in accordance with the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, fast in sincerity and approach their master. They shall be entrusted with the texts to wear upon their person, cultivate with a tranquil mind, and guard against careless transmission.

Moreover... Those who wish to cultivate the supreme methods should first perform the Highest Cavern Perfection’s Three Primes Fast, aligning the Three Primes with the Perfected to correspond with the Nine Mysteries. All who seek the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, the *Five Thearchs’ Precious Scripture of the Feminine Unity Jade Tallies*, the *Twelve Supreme Vows of the Mysterious Mother’s Eight Inquiries*, the Tiger Talismans of the Divine and Golden Tigers, the *Seven Primes of the Vast and Falling Flowing Gold Bells*, the *Concealing Incantations for Dispelling Demons*, the *Mighty Rites for Subduing the Myriad Spirits*, the *Flight of the Five Stars*, the *Contemplation of the Seven Primes*, and the *Perfected Practices of the Dao*—to ascend as Heavenly Transcendents and harmonize with the divine elixirs of flying cinnabar and numinous pills—must perform the Upper Prime’s nine-day, nine-night fast, purifying their fast with devotion and invoking the spirits. One day prior, they shall bathe in five fragrances, cleanse their bodies, and bind their minds in fasting resolve. From nine participants down to three, host and guests alike shall gather, each task performed with utmost diligence.

To perform the Middle Prime Fast for six days and six nights is to redeem the accumulated transgressions of one’s body, dissolve faults before the Heavenly Perfected, and atone for sins before the Three Primes. Once past transgressions are dispersed, the Highest Perfected shall descend, one’s name shall be inscribed in the Mysterious Archives, and one shall attain the rank of Supreme Transcendent. To study without method is to labor in vain, wasting effort and failing to resonate with the natural order.

To perform the Lower Prime’s three-day, three-night fast is to deliver the seven ancestors, reviving their deceased souls, liberating them from the Three Wretched Realms, ascending to the Southern Palace, untying knots and dissolving stagnations, severing evil roots. Once the seven ancestors are delivered, one’s own body shall attain transcendence. This method is lofty and wondrous—it must not be transmitted to the unworthy.

Upon completing the fast, one shall then cultivate and uphold the supreme Dao. Always bathe and fast in purity, don immaculate ritual vestments, rinse the mouth and purify the abdomen, ensuring inner and outer clarity—no lingering flavors in the mouth, no residual warmth in the belly, no filth in the eyes, no dust upon the body. Serene and still, one’s being shall be the Dao alone, and only then may cultivation proceed.

Those who study the supreme Dao yet fail to uphold the Three Hundred Great Precepts, yet seek scriptures, perform incantations, wear talismans, contemplate spirits, compound elixirs, ingest medicines, or retreat into mountains and forests in pursuit of transcendence—such aspirations may yet prove vain. If one can perfect the precepts within and harmonize one’s light without, then one may approach the precipice where names are inscribed.

It is not the cultivation of the Dao that is difficult, but the upholding of the Dao. Should you preserve it wholly, I and the ten directions shall ensure your ascent as a transcendent. Those who perfect the precepts and seek the precious scriptures, who wear the great talismans and perform the rites—if they attain even lesser transcendence, then there shall be no path to deathlessness under heaven.

I often lament that true Perfected Ones are rare in this world. To possess scriptures without precepts is like crossing the sea without boat or oar, like having a mouth without a tongue—how can one hope to ferry the multitudes? The essence of the Dao lies in the luminous statutes; only when goodness is amassed within may one enter the realm of the Great Dao. Those who cannot do so labor in vain amidst the dust, gaining nothing for the span of their lives.

Lord Lao further transmitted to the Azure Lad Dao Lord the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text*, comprising twenty-four practices, of which the outline is as follows:

**Method for Gathering and Ingesting Flying Roots and Swallowing Solar Essence:**
Wear the *Luminous Talisman of Non-Being*, and at dawn, contemplate the rising sun. Strike the teeth and intone the solar incantation, reciting the names of the Solar Spirit and the characters of the Five Thearchs within the sun. Visualize five-colored radiant clouds flowing forth to envelop the body. Intoning and swallowing as prescribed, one shall feel the body suffused with jade-like luster, the face aglow with streaming light.

**Method for Gathering and Ingesting Lunar Essence:**
First ingest the *Great Mystery Yin-Generating Talisman*, and at moonrise, contemplate the emerging moon. Strike the teeth and intone the lunar incantation, reciting the names of the Lunar Spirit and the characters of the Five Ladies within the moon. Visualize five-colored luminous essences from the moon flowing forth to envelop the body. Intoning and swallowing as prescribed, one shall feel the body suffused with the Three Lights, the eyes alight with flying essence.

**Method for Restraining the Three Hun:**
When the three *hun* souls abandon the body to wander, reciting the *Recitation of Departure* in the original chamber—or when they are detained by other spirits or seized by spectral entities—they must be restrained and retained to prevent their escape. The method: constantly visualize a red *qi* within the heart, expanding to envelop the body and transforming into fire, penetrating within and without. Strike the teeth as prescribed, and the three *hun* shall be restrained.

**Method for Controlling the Seven Po:**
The seven *po* souls, prone to wandering and defilement, may consort with blood-eating spirits, mingle with ghosts and demons, contend with corpses, speak of others’ sins, or desire their ruin—all maladies of the *po*. The method: on the last day of the lunar month, the first, the quarter-moons, the full moon, and the *gengshen* days, visualize a white and black *qi* at the tip of the nose, expanding to crown the body in nine layers, then transforming into the Four Numinous Beasts encircling the body. Visualize and intone as prescribed, and the seven *po* shall be refined and controlled.

Moreover, within the human body lie the Three Yuan Palaces. The Upper Yuan is the Cinnabar Field of the Mud-Pill Palace, its spirit named *Chizi* with the style *Yuanxian*, also called *Diqing*. The Middle Yuan is the Cinnabar Field of the Crimson Palace, its spirit named *Zhenren* with the style *Zidan*, also called *Guangjian*. The Lower Yuan is the Cinnabar Field of the Life Gate Palace, its spirit named *Ying’er* with the style *Yuanyang*, also called *Xuangu*. These Three Ones’ spirits—clad in purple robes in the Upper Palace, red robes in the Middle Palace, and yellow robes in the Lower Palace—all appear in the form of infants. To restrain the *hun* and *po* souls, first call their names while visualizing their robes and colors in clear sequence.

Within the Life Gate Palace resides the Great Lord, named *Taokang* with the style *Heyan*, who wears vermilion robes and a hibiscus crown. The three *hun* souls attend him at his side. When retiring at night, regularly visualize the Great Lord and sigh while guarding him as prescribed for eighteen years. The Great Lord can then stir the Three Fields to the left, govern the Three Blacks to the right, summon the Six Yang *Jia* and the Six Yin *Ding*, who will come to attend the practitioner.

Further, practice the Way of *Yuyi* and *Jielin* racing toward dawn, ingest the *Lingfei* Six *Jia* Yin-Yang Talismans, wear the talismans of the Divine Tiger, Metal Tiger, Demon-Quelling, Falling Metal, and Flowing Gold, and invoke the *Three Sections and Eight Sceneries of the Twenty-Four Spirits of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*. Consume the Jade-Enamel Flower Elixir, embrace the Yellow Water and Moon Essence, and circulate the *Huishui* Jade Essence and *Huangang* Fruit. Then, seven-colored radiance shall emerge from the crown of the head, allowing myriad transformations, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, and ascension to heaven in broad daylight.

These are essential texts for cultivating the Dao and attaining immortality, transmitted as the true oral instructions of the Jade Clarity Lord, the Supreme Perfected of the Purple Tenuity Heaven and the Celestial Thearch of the Great Mystery. Inscribed on purple jade slips with azure-gold characters, the script was written by the Mother of Tortoises holding the brush, the Perfected Youth sweeping the mat, and the Heavenly Consort attending with incense. The Jade Youth recorded the names in *The Purple Texts of the Numinous Writ*, which was bestowed upon the Grand Minister, the Azure Youth Great Lord, to transmit to those in the Mysterious Palace whose jade names marked them as Perfected Ones.

Thereupon, the Azure Youth Great Lord purified himself for a thousand days, prostrated himself on his knees, and, bowing his head to the north, received the teachings in accordance with the rites and returned them to the Azure Palace in Fangzhu. Later, he transmitted them to the Lord of Western City, who in turn taught them to those of destined bone and countenance.

When the tyranny of King Zhou of Shang plunged the people into suffering, Lord Lao took pity on them and resolved to descend to save them. In the twenty-first year of Zhou’s reign, the *dingmao* year of the first month, he ascended to pay homage to the Supreme Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord, saying: “King Xin of Shang is licentious and disorderly; the Water Mandate nears its end. The Earl of the West shall rise in response. You may go to assist him.” Having received his charge, on the twelfth day of that month, the *bingwu* day, Lord Lao divided his form into a dark transformation, mounted a flying maple chariot, with the Wind Earl clearing the way and Peng Zu riding alongside. He descended to the southern slope of Mount Qi, where he was known as *Xieyizi*. The Earl of the West, King Wen of Zhou, appointed him as the Archivist of the Treasury, and he composed the *Scripture of Red Essence*, teaching the Way of benevolence and trust.

By the time of King Wu, he was known as *Yuchengzi* and was promoted to the position of Historian Beneath the Pillars, where he composed the *Scripture of the Wandering Orb*. During the reign of King Cheng, he was called *Jingchengzi* and expounded the *Scripture of Vast Transformation* before retiring. In the time of King Kang, he was known as *Guoshuzi* and again served as Historian Beneath the Pillars, concealing his dragon-like power in a humble rank to pacify the Zhou dynasty.

When King Zhao ascended the throne, Lord Lao, foreseeing the decline of the Zhou house, bestowed upon him the Hidden Texts of the Eight Heavens to safeguard the nation’s mandate. King Zhao, believing himself to dwell in the natural course of destiny, gradually relaxed his vigilance in governance, indulging his heart in tours and neglecting celestial patterns. Lord Lao, knowing the king would not meet a favorable end, withdrew the celestial texts and resigned from office, returning to his native land.

Though Lord Lao dwelled in Zhou for a long time, he always made concealment and anonymity his duty. Outwardly, he harmonized with the world, while inwardly he remained pure and empty, never allowing his name or position to become prominent. The Later Han scholar Bian Shao composed an inscription that reads:

*In profound virtue, he embraced emptiness and guarded purity,
Delighting in a lowly station, he sought neither power nor rank.
As a plumb line, he straightened what was crooked;
Bent, he could be coiled, yet never lost the One.
A true man under heaven, he dwelt in depth without shallowness,
Residing in a humble abode, he renounced glory.
Revering the model, he held it weighty,
While gold and jade he deemed light.
Cutting off cravings and forsaking desires,
He returned to the state of infancy.
Vast and boundless through the years,
None knew his true nature.
Essential was his non-doing,
Yet the great transformation was perfected in Zhou.
Advancing and retreating without constancy,
He synthesized constancy within.
Knowing, he feigned ignorance,
Empty yet never full.
Such was the measure of the great man,
Beyond what others could fathom.
In the nine ranks of hierarchy,
How could a name burden him?*

It is said: Examining the classics and histories, discrepancies arise regarding Lord Lao’s birth and his years of service in Zhou. This stems from the First Emperor’s destruction of ancient records, and the Han dynasty’s reconstruction of the fragmented order. Some accounts were gathered from elders’ recollections, while others filled gaps in the annals, preserving the broad strokes while omitting details, or recording the latter while losing the foundation. Later, as historical records flourished and Daoist scriptures emerged, those who obtained them often concealed them without transmission, causing later scholars to lose sight of their original intent.

Now, according to the *Annals of Lord Lao* and the *Records of Louguan*, it is stated: He was born on the fifteenth day of the second month in the *gengchen* year of King Wuding of Yin. In the *dingmao* year of King Xin’s reign, on the twelfth day of the first month, he descended from the Golden Watchtower to the southern slope of Mount Qi, where he became the teacher of the Five Masters. It is further said: During the time of the Earl of the West, he served as Archivist of the Treasury, and during the reigns of Kings Wu, Cheng, and Kang, as Historian Beneath the Pillars. These accounts are trustworthy.

Some accounts claim that during the Zhou dynasty he once entrusted his spirit to the womb of Lady Li—this refers to the time when he was born into the household of Li Daguan of the Green Ram Market in Shu. If he were born only in the Zhou, how could he have served as Archivist of the Treasury under King Wen? Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* states: “He was born in the Shang dynasty.” Yet Liu Xiang errs in claiming that he first served as Historian Beneath the Pillars and later as Archivist of the Treasury. The Historian Beneath the Pillars was responsible for receiving memorials from the Four Quarters and recording accounts beneath the pillars. During King Wen’s time, when the Zhou still paid vassalage to the Shang, how could there have been officials to receive accounts from the Four Quarters? Only when ritual, music, and classical texts were established was the position of Archivist of the Treasury instituted. Huangfu [Mi] and Ji Kang, among others, followed Liu Xiang’s account, thus placing the Historian Beneath the Pillars first. Only in the *Stele of the Courtyard of Lord Lao’s Shrine*, composed by Xue Daoheng of the Sui, is it written: “During the reigns of King Wen and King Wu, he held the offices of Archivist of the Treasury and Historian Beneath the Pillars.” This statement may be deemed correct.

In the first year of the Wuji era, the Supreme Dao Lord once again commanded Lord Lao to enlighten the Western Regions—this was the twenty-third year of King Zhao’s reign, the *guichou* year. On the last day of the fifth month, the *renwu* day, Lord Lao rode in a carriage drawn by a blue ox, its canopy fashioned from thin planks, with Xu Jia as his charioteer. The Master of Wuji, Master Guigu, and Master Beiguo accompanied him. As he was about to cross the Hangu Pass to the west, Yin Xi, who longed for the Daoist arts, styled himself Gongwen. During the reign of King Kang, he served as a grandee, later summoned to court as a guest-friend of the Eastern Palace. From youth, he cherished the *Three Tombs* and *Eight Cords* of ancient texts and excelled in celestial divination and astrological observation. He built a thatched tower to gaze upon the heavens, concentrating his spirit in pursuit of the Dao, and was thus called the Tower Observer. In the present-day Wenshui County of Zhongnan Mountain, within the Immortal-Seeking Hamlet of Shenlong Township, stands a thatched tower with an altar and shrine—this was his former abode. King Mu of Zhou later expanded and adorned it, summoning reclusive worthies to serve as Daoist masters. From that time onward, the tradition has continued unbroken to this day.

At that time, Yin Xi observed a purple-black aura advancing westward from the east, with celestial omens manifesting auspiciously. Knowing that a sage was about to cross the pass to the west, he requested to be appointed as the magistrate of Hangu Pass. The pass lay 11 li within Taolin County of Shanzhou, and its former site remains to this day. The king granted his request.

According to the *Biographies of the Former Masters of Louguan* and the *Records of Louguan*, King Kang of Zhou, having heard of Xi’s aspiration for the Dao and immortality, appointed him as a grandee. By the reign of King Zhao, Xi encountered the Old Master (Laozi) and attained the Way, thereafter accompanying him in a cloud-borne chariot as they journeyed west. Later, King Mu, revering the traces of their passage, had a shrine and temple hall constructed. Thus, an inscription on its stele reads: *"Louguan was established by Yin Xi, Grandee and Magistrate of Hangu Pass during the reign of King Kang of Zhou. As it was built in the form of a tower, it was named accordingly."* It also states: *"When King Mu of Zhou made his western inspection tour, and when the First Emperor of Qin hunted in the east, both diverted their carriages to pay homage, personally venerating the teachings of the Dao. The First Emperor built a temple south of the tower, Emperor Wu of Han erected a palace north of the hall. The inscribed tablets of the Jin and Song dynasties remain to this day. The temple households of the Qin and Han have continued in unbroken succession. In the second year of the Zhenguan era, it was renamed Zongsheng Abbey."* From this, it is evident that the Old Master crossed the pass during the reign of King Zhao. Some claim it occurred during the Eastern Zhou, but this is merely because later generations saw that Laozi was still alive in Confucius’ time and thus assumed as much, unaware that after transforming the Hu barbarians, Laozi returned to seclusion in the Central Lands, where Confucius was then able to become his disciple.

On the day Xi arrived at the pass, he declared: *"When the yang number reaches its utmost at nine, and the stellar lodges align with Metal, with the year and month both in ascendance, the law dictates that ninety days hence, a great sage will pass through the capital."* At the time, the Zhou capital of Haojing lay west of Hangu Pass. He first instructed the pass officer Sun Jing: *"If anyone of extraordinary appearance or unusual carriage and attire arrives, do not permit them to pass."* Xi then prepared in advance, observing purification rites, ordering the roads swept for forty li, and having incense burned along both sides to await the arrival of the celestial being. On the twelfth day of the seventh month, the jiazi day, an old man with white hair and long ears indeed arrived, riding in a white carriage drawn by a black ox.

The pass officer said: *"The magistrate has given orders. We humbly request that you tarry a while."* He then went inside to report. Xi exclaimed: *"The Way has come at last! I shall see the sage!"* Immediately donning his court robes, he went out to welcome him, prostrating himself and kowtowing. He entreated: *"May the Venerable One deign to pause his divine carriage for a moment."* The Old Master declined: *"I am but a poor, aged rustic dwelling east of the pass, with my fields to the west. I am merely going to gather firewood—why detain me? Pray, allow me to pass."* This was the first trial.

Xi again kowtowed and said: *"How could the Venerable One be gathering firewood? I have long heard that a great sage would come traveling west. Though you endure hardship and exposure, I beseech you to rest your sacred carriage awhile."* The Old Master replied: *"I have heard that in Da Qin there is an Ancient Master whose Way is non-action. I wish to go and observe him, and so I mount my carriage and set forth, passing through your pass. Why do you persist in detaining me?"* This was the second trial.

Xi continued: *"Today I behold the celestial countenance of a sage, transcendent and peerless, the supreme being of the heavens. How could the borderlands be worthy of your observation? I beg you not to dissemble but to show a little compassion."* The Old Master asked: *"By what do you recognize me?"* This was the third trial.

Xi replied: *"Last winter, in the tenth month, the four stars of Heavenly Principle moved westward past Xu. Since the first day of this month, the harmonizing winds have blown thrice, and a true radiance from the east, shaped like a dragon or serpent, has crossed westward. These are the portents of a great sage. From youth, I have studied the *Three Tombs*, the *Book of Changes*, and the secret celestial weft-texts. In all my observations, whether looking up or down, I have never been mistaken. Thus, I knew a sage would cross the pass. Day and night, I have pondered this without cease. Now, as if by predestined affinity, I have indeed encountered your immortal carriage. I implore your compassion to deliver those lost in darkness."*

Having passed all three trials, the Old Master smiled serenely and said: *"Excellent! You have known me. I, too, have seen that you possess a vision that penetrates the divine and are destined to attain liberation from the world."* The Four White-Haired Masters and Master Jiaoli remarked: *"Were not Laozi and Xi already alert to the subtle signs of the times? Yet they still maintained such humble demeanor—this was to instruct the world."*

Thereupon, Xi led the Old Master to the official residence, prepared a seat for his veneration, offered water for washing and a comb, and performed the rites of a disciple. The Old Master’s charioteer, Xu Jia, had long been in his service, agreeing to a daily wage of one hundred coins. By the time they reached the pass, the total owed amounted to seven million three hundred thousand coins. Seeing the Old Master departing for distant lands, Xu Jia hastened to demand payment. The Old Master said: *"I intend to travel to the Western Sea, Da Qin, Jibin, Tianzhu, and Anxi. Now that you drive my carriage, I shall repay you in gold."* Xu Jia agreed to the terms.

Upon reaching the pass, Xi had the black ox adorned and released into the wild. The Old Master, wishing to test Xu Jia, transformed auspicious grass into a beautiful woman, who walked to where the ox was grazing and began to jest with him. Xu Jia, enchanted, wished to stay, thus breaking their prior agreement. He then went to the pass magistrate to sue the Old Master for his wages. The Old Master said to him: *"You have followed me for over two hundred years. You should have died long ago. As my office was lowly and my household poor, I had no use for you, so I gave you the Talisman of Great Mystery to sustain your life until today. How can you forget this and sue me?"* As he spoke, the talisman flew from Xu Jia’s mouth, its cinnabar script as fresh as new. Xu Jia instantly crumbled into a pile of white bones.

Moved by Xu Jia’s death due to his breach of faith, Xi kowtowed and pleaded for his life, begging that his offense be pardoned, that he be granted rebirth, and offering to pay the debt on his behalf. The Old Master, admiring Xi’s compassion, said: *"Very well."* He then cast the Talisman of Great Mystery upon the bones, and Xu Jia immediately revived. The Old Master said: *"I did not betray you; you betrayed our original agreement. The Way departed from you, and so you died. Now I shall repay your wages."* Xi then gave the money to Xu Jia and sent him off with courtesy. Xu Jia begged to stay, but was not permitted. He prostrated himself, striking his cheeks, and said: *"Having bathed in the sagely grace of your lenient pardon, allowing these dry bones to see the light again, I shall carve this into my heart and bones. I wish to follow your cloud-borne carriage."*

The Old Lord ultimately refused. The Old Lord kept Xi at the pass for over a hundred days. Xi fasted, kowtowed, bowed twice, and knelt to entreat, saying: *"This humble one from the dusty world has been fortunate to encounter a sage. I offer my body and life, wishing to hear the Great Dao."*

The Old Lord said: *"How subtle is your question! The Great Dao preserves authenticity. The Three Grades serve as its rule, unity as its measure, and uprightness as its virtue."*

Xi said: *"There are three grades of the Dao. To ascend as an immortal—is this possible?"*

The Old Lord said: *"If you can know the One, all things are complete. Seal off passions and desires, enter the inner chamber, refine metal and ingest qi—this is the foremost path. If you can know this, guard it and never lose it."*

Xi leapt with joy, prostrated himself, and said: *"How does one refine metal?"*

The Old Lord replied: *"It is a divine method. Even the Most True Supreme Lord attained the Dao through the Golden Elixir, treading the Nine Darks to enter the profound void, ascending and descending through emptiness, and rising together with the divine luminants."*

Xi prostrated himself again and said: *"I wish to hear its essentials."*

The Old Lord said:
*"Red lead and black mercury are the head of the Great Elixir.
From red to black is true cultivation.
Extract essence from black, marrow from red.
Resolve the red and black—this medicine is peerless.
Use red to enter black to preserve longevity.
Use black to enter red to become a celestial immortal."*

Xi said: *"The Dao is lofty and wondrous, yet I have not fully grasped it. I beg for further instruction."*

The Old Lord said:
*"First is lead—lead is the lord.
Second is mercury—mercury is the minister.
If lead is not true, mercury will not draw near.
If lead is true, the household minister will not be lost.
The Green-Waisted Messenger, the Red-Black General,
harmonize the two clans, unite the disparate lineages.
White mercury forms the chest, yellow sprouts the root.
Transform lead into powder, refine mercury into dust.
Yin resides in the yang position, yang’s number balances yin.
The moon waxes as the sun wanes, cold and heat divide their realms.
Establish the method’s image—brilliant patterns appear.
Only this Dao endures with heaven and earth."*

Xi bowed and said: *"I reverently receive your instruction on the essence of the medicines. But what of the furnace and crucible, the timing of water and fire?"*

The Old Lord chanted:
*"Round as three-five, a tenth of an inch,
mouth four-eight, lips two-ten,
two feet long, thickness even.
Belly three navels, seated warmth descends,
yin above, yang rushes below,
head and tail martial, center civil.
Begin at seventy, end at thirty days,
two hundred within, well-tempered and balanced.
Yin fire white, yellow sprouts silver,
come and go wandering, never leaving the gate.
Gradually grow great, nature refined and pure,
return to unity, restore the original source.
When one cycle is complete, be diligent,
guard it closely, do not grow confused.
The path is distant, profoundly mysterious.
If you attain this, you will comprehend heaven and earth.
At the zi and wu hours, purify the po and hun,
gain long life, enter the immortal village.
Those who delight in the Dao, seek its patterns,
ponder them carefully, do not speak idly."*

He chanted again:
*"Sun and moon are the essence of heaven and earth,
the hexagrams’ revolutions are most clear.
Three-five before, three-five after,
five-six thirty, returning to life.
Returning to life, completing twelve,
twelve divided into twenty-four.
Twenty-four qi mutually shift,
all phenomena and grains reside herein.
Quicksilver, one flavor, divides into two,
transforming yin and yang into *ji* and *wei*.
*Ji* and *wei* then pair as husband and wife,
and one perceives a heaven and earth within the crucible."*

He chanted once more:
*"The Golden Liquid Returned Elixir flows like immortal blossoms,
soaring high on clouds to ascend the celestial mounds.
Red and yellow substances form in an instant,
then male and female pearls scatter in profusion.
You may transform and reach the traveling kitchen,
with spirit youths and jade maidens accompanying you.
Entering and exiting without hindrance, bearing the talisman of heaven and earth,
its essence congeals like frost, neither sinking nor floating.
If you reverently await, they will surely come to roam."*

*"The secrets of the Golden Liquid are all contained herein. When the elixir is complete, fashion vessels from the gold to use as utensils—this too grants longevity. First test the gold to ensure it is complete, then you may ingest it. Thus it is said: ‘Gold can be made, and the world can be delivered.’"*

Thereupon, he bestowed upon Xi *The Eight Talismans Scripture of Great Clarity*, *The Scripture of Great Clarity on Observing Heaven*, *The Nine Capitals Scripture*, *The Scripture of Divine Elixirs*, *The Scripture of the Golden Liquid*, and the *Eight Refining and Nine Poems of the Returned Elixir’s Stages of Subduing*.

The Old Lord further said: *"If you truly seek immortality, you must first ingest the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir. If you do not take the elixir, you will only bring suffering upon yourself—subjected to the vexations of warmth, cold, wind, dampness, and ghostly qi, even the Controller of Destinies cannot save you. Can you not strive? Diligently refine the elixir, defend yourself early, and do not show it to fools, lest they slander and defame the divine Dao, increasing your transgressions. Alas! The walking corpse, though rich with all things and more noble than kings and marquises, in less than a hundred years becomes a clod of earth—how lamentable! To compound the divine elixir requires but a moment of toil. Once complete, you become an immortal, equal with heaven, freely following your desires—what boundless joy!"*

Xi said: *"Refining metal and ingesting the black—are these two different paths?"*

The Old Lord said: *"The essence of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang—these are called the Two Blacks. The yang dragon and yin tiger, the original liquid and golden essence—when the Two Blacks conjoin and are refined, this is called the Outer Elixir. Harmonizing and refining the hidden, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, ascending to the Muddy Pellet, descending to the Cinnabar Field, circulating without cease, ascending to the Crimson Palace, gathering from the Five Stones to nourish the hundred spirits—this is the Inner Elixir. Those who cultivate the Dao may extend their years with the Inner Elixir and ascend to heaven with the Outer Elixir. The Three Ones and Nine Contemplations are the essence of inner cultivation. The Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquid are the pinnacle of outer refinement. To practice both together is the completion of the Dao. Ingesting the black to secure essence, receiving the *Mysterious Bright Scripture*, the essential wonders of the life-generating Dao—emerging from darkness and entering obscurity, above securing the Cloud Gate, below securing the Spirit Root—knowing this is easy, practicing it is difficult. When the body moves, virtue scatters; qi strays and the Dao rebels. Essence dissipates, the hun-soul is harmed, the po-soul stirs in chaos. Thus the sage stills the body and secures qi, accumulates essence and restrains the gaze. Then virtue and Dao congeal in emptiness, hun and po are firmly guarded, the body unifies and the spirit flourishes ten thousandfold—only then is the Dao accomplished."*

Regularly after midnight, recline with fists clenched, inhale pure qi through the nose, and slowly exhale through the mouth. Again guard the Three Ones, enter the chamber and contemplate the Nine Thoughts—when spirit settles and qi stabilizes, the Dao of immortality draws near.

Thereupon, he bestowed upon Xi the thirty-five chapters of the *Jade Calendar Central Scripture*. Xi said: "I beg for instruction on the meaning of the Three Ones." Lord Lao said: "The Way of the Three Ones is what divine immortals esteem; the world has never heard of it—you must keep it secret. Between the brows, one inch inward is the Hall of Light; two inches inward is the Grotto Chamber; three inches inward is the Muddy Pellet—this is the Upper Cinnabar Field Palace. Within it dwells the Red Child, named Yuanxian, styled Imperial Minister. The heart is the Crimson Palace, the Middle Cinnabar Field. Within it dwells the Perfected One, named Zidan, styled Radiant Firmness. Three inches inward from the navel is the Gate of Destiny, the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace. Within it dwells the Infant, named Yuanyang, styled Mystic Valley. All are three inches in height, clad alike in red silk, red robes, and red shoes—these are the Three Ones. Another tradition says the upper is purple, the middle red, and the lower yellow, all in the form of infants. Below stands a golden bed and jade table, where a golden censer and jade spoon stir the Flower Pool to nourish the Upper One and Middle One. This should be visualized day and night. If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be made clear. If you can guard the One, the One will guard you. Qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, spirit into the infant, the infant ascends to become the Perfected One, and the Perfected One then becomes the Red Child—this is the True One."

He further said: "False ways cultivate the form; the true Way cultivates the spirit. When spirit is true, the Dao is open—it can vanish and it can endure. Spirit can make the form fly and can move mountains. When the form becomes ash and dust, what awareness remains? Ears and eyes, sounds and sights—these are your lingering faults. Nose and mouth, fragrances and flavors—these are your foes. The body is the root of vexation—pain, itching, cold, and heat. The mind is the burden of the form—sorrow, poison, worry, and distress. If you do not swiftly cast these aside, your will and qi will daily diminish, and your lifespan will not reach its end. This has been so for a long time. You must first reduce all desires, lest the mind wander. Dwell in seclusion, in quietude, and meditate in a purified chamber. Even if ten thousand people study the cinnabar scriptures, it is not equal to guarding the One. Always take emptiness as your body and nothingness as your mind. The body of no-body, the mind of no-mind—this is called guarding the spirit. When spirit and spirit profoundly connect, this is called unity with the Dao. It is like lofty mountains and vast marshes, which do not desire insects, fish, birds, or beasts, yet these creatures naturally gather there. If one can be empty and do nothing, not desiring the Dao, the Dao will naturally come to them. I have seen this in the *Scripture of Western Ascension*."

Thereupon, he bestowed upon Xi the *Scripture of Spontaneity*, the *Yellow Court Scripture*, and the essentials of entering the chamber and contemplative visualization. Xi bowed deeply twice, reverently embracing the profound teachings.

The treatise says: The sagely words are most concise; the profound principle is not complex. As described above, these were the answers Lord Lao gave in response to Xi’s repeated and earnest inquiries over many days. Their essentials are compiled here to instruct future generations—this was not a conversation of a single morning or evening. Xi then resigned from office on grounds of illness. On the fifteenth day of the twelfth month, he respectfully invited Lord Lao to return to his home. The present Louguan Monastery is his former residence. The *Cloud-Gazing Black Grass Tower* and the carriage Lord Lao rode are treasured through the ages and remain to this day.

As Lord Lao was about to journey west, Xi prostrated himself and begged to accompany him. Lord Lao said to Xi: "I wander beyond heaven and earth, play within the dark and obscure, across the four directions and eight limits, above and below without bounds. If you wish to follow me, it cannot be done." Xi said: "Entering fire or abyss, descending into earth or ascending to heaven, reducing the body to ashes and returning to fate—I wish to follow the Great Sage." Lord Lao said: "Those who attain the Dao have eyes that see deeply and ears that hear clearly; their transformations are unfathomable. Whether sitting or standing, they are beyond ordinary measure. Even they cannot follow me on distant journeys. Though your bone structure aligns with the Dao and you are destined to achieve perfection, your days of study are still few, and you have not yet mastered spirit-transformation. How could you follow me?"

Xi bowed again and said: "May I hear of spirit-transformation?" Lord Lao said: "The qi of life, the forms of existence—all are illusions. What creation begins, what yin and yang transform—this is called life, this is called death. Exhausting numbers and grasping change, altering form through movement—this is called transformation, this is called illusion. Creation is subtle and wondrous, its workings profound—thus it is difficult to exhaust or complete. Altering form is manifest in its subtlety, its workings shallow—thus it arises and vanishes in an instant. Only when you know that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can you begin to speak of the Way of transformation. If you can diligently cultivate this Way and embody spontaneity, then I may journey with you through the kingdoms."

Twenty-eight days later, Xi again burned incense, bowed twice, and said: "I am fortunate to have heard the supreme Dao; my joy is beyond words. I beg you to compose a book, to expound the Dao’s principles and bequeath them to later generations." Lord Lao said: "Very well. You shall be the leader of all Perfected Ones and should spread the great Dao in this *Wanli* world of abandoned worthies." Thereupon, he bestowed upon him the *Five Thousand Words of the Eightfold Virtue*, saying: "I have never lightly bestowed this text upon others. Only once in twelve hundred years is it transmitted—you must strive diligently." Xi received it with reverence and joy, reciting and practicing it faithfully. After achieving the Dao, he transmitted it to later disciples.

Lu Xisheng of the Tang in his *Commentary on the Scripture of the Way and Virtue* said: "When the great Dao is hidden and worldly teachings decline, the world falls into great chaos. At such times, Heaven must produce a sage. The sage worries that the people will not attain order, and so arises the art of supporting decline and rescuing chaos. The end of the Zhou dynasty was such a time. Thus, Confucius elucidated the culture of the Three Dynasties to support its decline, while Laozi relied on the simplicity of the Three Sovereigns to rescue its chaos—their purpose was the same. Confucius’s safeguarding flourished through culture, and culture governs the emotions."

Laozi’s art is rooted in simplicity, and simplicity restores one’s nature. The ultimate of nature and emotion is no different for the sage. The alternation of culture and simplicity is unchanging across ten thousand generations. The *Book of Changes* says, "Manifesting it through benevolence"—this refers to teaching through culture. Teaching through culture makes its affairs evident, thus plain and clear, and refined speech becomes detailed. The *Book of Changes* says, "Concealing it in application"—this refers to teaching through simplicity. Teaching through simplicity makes its principles subtle, thus profoundly unrecognizable, and false practitioners abound.

Only Laozi’s safeguarding takes the Dao as its essence and names as its function, practicing non-action yet accomplishing all things, thus aligning with the imperial standard. Yang Zhu followed Laozi’s essence but fell short, valuing the self and belittling things. Zhuang Zhou expounded Laozi’s function but overreached, striving to abolish sageliness and discard wisdom. Shen Buhai and Han Fei lost Laozi’s names and fell into harshness and urgency. Wang Bi and He Yan lost Laozi’s Dao and drifted into emptiness and recklessness. These six were all traitors to Laozi. Yet the world firmly claims that Laozi’s principles do not align with Confucius, thus slandering his name by saying he "strikes down benevolence and righteousness, abolishes ritual and learning," and criticizing his virtue by saying he "relies solely on purity and emptiness, unfit for governance." Alas, the world’s delusion has persisted for so long—this is why Laozi has been wronged for a thousand years, and the Dao and virtue have not prevailed in his time. There is indeed reason for this.

Moreover, Laozi traces back to the origins of Heaven and Earth, recounts the changes of past and present, first clarifies the Dao and virtue, then discusses benevolence and righteousness, and below that, points out the failures of ritual and learning, the excesses of punishments and governance, explaining how they gradually led to such a state. His grasp of the essential and holding to the root lie in the ultimate of nature and emotion. Thus, his Dao begins with the self and mind, extends to family and state, and culminates in the world—so complete is it. Yet those who remain confused are many. Is this not a grave injustice?

In ancient times, Fuxi drew the Eight Trigrams, symbolizing the myriad things, exhausting the principles of nature and destiny, and harmonizing with the Dao and virtue. Laozi preceded Heaven and Earth, grounded himself in yin and yang, deduced the ultimate of nature and destiny, and explored the mysteries of the Dao and virtue—this shares the same origin as Fuxi. King Wen observed the movements of the nine and six in the *Great Change*, valuing firmness and esteeming change, yet centering on the mean. Laozi examined the correctness of the seven and eight in the *Great Change*, embracing softness and guarding stillness, yet unifying them in the great—this shares the same lineage as King Wen. Confucius inherited the legacy of Yao and Shun, modeled himself on Wen and Wu, and guided the people with the teaching of benevolence and righteousness. Laozi emulated Fuxi, encompassed the Yellow Emperor, and covered the world with the transformation of the Dao and virtue—this shares the same authority as the Son of Heaven. These three were the ultimate of sages. Laozi transformed and connected with them, returning to align with them, investigating the mechanism of ultimate change and exploring the essence of ultimate subtlety. This may truly be called the most divine.

Yet Wang Bi claimed that the sage and the Dao are one in essence, while Laozi could not embody the Dao. Thus, Ruan Ji called him a "superior worthy, sub-sage, and heavenly person," following Wang Bi’s lead. Could it be that Laozi’s art of governing the world was insufficient to justify such words? This is not so.

Alas, the sage’s presence in the world has boundaries and boundlessness. Thus, when the Dao does not prevail, some risk their lives and travel far, taking the world’s troubles as their own, while others hide their names and live in seclusion, showing the world that it cannot entangle them. Boundaries and boundlessness, different paths to the same end—this is truly the gateway of the Dao and righteousness, not merely opposition. Therefore, Confucius’s emergence, Laozi’s dwelling, Laozi’s silence, and Confucius’s speech—these are the extremes of yielding and extending, concealing and revealing. How could the two masters comprehend this?

Sima Qian compiled the lineages of the various schools, placing the Dao and virtue first—this may be called understanding the root and branches. Ban Gu wrote the *Table of Ancient and Modern People*, yet disparaged Laozi by ranking him in the third grade. Though his name may be disparaged, can his Dao be denigrated? Moreover, Confucius personally met Laozi and marveled at his Dao, saying, "Like a dragon!" He followed him to inquire about ritual, truly without doubt, as recorded in the annals. Later generations could not cultivate this Dao or embody naturalness—how could they accompany him in transforming the states?

After twenty-eight days, Xi again burned incense and bowed, saying: "Xi is fortunate to have heard the ultimate Dao, his joy indescribable. I humbly request that you bestow a written work to expound the Dao’s principles and bequeath them to later generations." Lord Lao said: "Good. You shall be the leader of all perfected beings and should thereby transform the world in this declining age. Transmit and propagate the great Dao." He then bestowed the *Eighty-One Chapters of the Dao and Virtue*, saying: "I have never lightly transmitted this text. It has taken twelve hundred years to pass it on once. You must strive diligently." Xi bowed in receipt, overjoyed, and recited and practiced it faithfully. After achieving the Dao, he transmitted it to later disciples.

Lu Xisheng of the Tang in his *Commentary on the Scripture of the Way and Virtue* said: "When the great Dao is hidden and worldly teachings decline, the world falls into great chaos. At such times, Heaven must produce a sage. The sage worries that the people will not attain order, and so arises the art of supporting decline and rescuing chaos. The end of the Zhou dynasty was such a time. Thus, Confucius elucidated the culture of the Three Dynasties to support its decline, while Laozi relied on the simplicity of the Three Sovereigns to rescue its chaos—their purpose was the same. Confucius’s safeguarding flourished through culture, and culture governs the emotions. Laozi’s art is rooted in simplicity, and simplicity restores one’s nature. The ultimate of nature and emotion is no different for the sage. The alternation of culture and simplicity is unchanging across ten thousand generations. The *Book of Changes* says, 'Manifesting it through benevolence'—this refers to teaching through culture."

The teaching of culture is manifest in its affairs, thus open and clear—hence those who speak with refinement elaborate upon it. The *Book of Changes* says, "Concealing it in its application"—this refers to teaching through simplicity.

The teaching of simplicity is subtle in its principles, thus profound and unrecognizable—hence those who fabricate falsely are many. Only the safeguarding of Laozi takes the Dao as its essence and names as its function, practicing non-action yet accomplishing all, aligning with the imperial standard. Yang Zhu adhered to Laozi’s essence but fell short, valuing the self and belittling things. Zhuang Zhou expounded Laozi’s function but overreached, striving to abolish sageliness and discard wisdom. Shen Buhai and Han Fei lost Laozi’s names, degenerating into harshness and rigid severity. Wang Bi and He Yan lost Laozi’s Dao, drifting into emptiness and reckless abandon. These six masters were all transgressors against Laozi. Yet the world firmly claims that Laozi’s purport does not align with Confucius, thus slandering his name by saying he "strikes down benevolence and righteousness, severs ritual and learning," and criticizing his virtue by saying he "relies solely on purity and emptiness, which cannot govern." Alas, the world’s delusion has persisted for so long—this is why Laozi has been wronged for a thousand years, and the Dao and virtue have not prevailed in his time. There is indeed reason for this.

Moreover, Laozi traces back to the origins of Heaven and Earth, recounts the changes of past and present, first clarifies the Dao and virtue, then expounds on benevolence and righteousness, and below that, points out the failures of ritual and learning, the excesses of penal governance—his words show how these arose gradually. His grasp of the essential and adherence to the root lie in the ultimate of human nature and emotion. Thus, his Dao begins with the self and mind, extends to the family and state, and culminates in the world—so comprehensive is it. Yet those who remain confused are many. Is this not a grave injustice?

In ancient times, Fuxi drew the Eight Trigrams, symbolizing the myriad things, exhausting the principles of nature and destiny, and harmonizing with the Dao and virtue. Laozi preceded Heaven and Earth, grounded himself in yin and yang, deduced the ultimate of nature and destiny, and traced the profundities of the Dao and virtue—this shares the same origin as Fuxi. King Wen observed the movements of the nine and six in the *Great Change*, valuing firmness and esteeming transformation, yet centering on the mean. Laozi examined the correctness of the seven and eight in the *Great Change*, embraced softness and upheld stillness, yet unified them in the great—this shares the same lineage as King Wen. Confucius transmitted the legacy of Yao and Shun, modeled himself on Wen and Wu, and guided the people with the teaching of benevolence and righteousness. Laozi emulated Fuxi, encompassed the Yellow Emperor, and enveloped the world with the transformation of the Dao and virtue—this aligns with the authority of the Son of Heaven. These three masters represent the pinnacle of sageliness. Laozi transformed and connected with them, returning to harmonize with them, investigating the mechanism of ultimate change and exploring the essence of ultimate refinement—this may truly be called the most divine.

Yet Wang Bi claimed that the sage is one with the Dao in body, while Laozi could not embody the Dao. Thus, Ruan Ji called him a "superior worthy, sub-sage, and celestial being," following Wang Bi’s lead. Could it be that Laozi’s art of governing the world was insufficient to justify such claims? This is not so.

Alas, the sage’s presence in the world has boundaries and boundlessness. Thus, when the Dao does not prevail, some risk their lives in service, taking the world’s worries as their own, while others conceal their names and live in seclusion, showing that worldly affairs cannot entangle them. Boundaries and boundlessness take different paths but reach the same end—this is truly the gateway of the Dao and righteousness, not merely opposition. Therefore, Confucius’s emergence and Laozi’s seclusion, Laozi’s silence and Confucius’s speech—these are the extremes of yielding and extending, concealing and revealing. How could the two masters have understood this?

Sima Qian compiled the lineages of the various schools, placing the Dao and virtue first—this may be called understanding the root and branches. Ban Gu, in his *Table of Ancient and Modern Personages*, disparaged Laozi by ranking him in the third grade. Though his name may be disparaged, can his Dao be denigrated? Moreover, Confucius personally met Laozi and marveled at his Dao, saying, "Like a dragon!" He followed him to inquire about ritual, truly without doubt—this is recorded in the annals. Later generations could not fathom his meaning, hence heterodox theories proliferated. Those who were deluded did not exhaust its source, and thus those who expounded it did not fulfill its intent.

Alas, if such a transmission had not been made, Laozi’s purport might have nearly vanished. Now, therefore, I have exhausted its intent and revealed its subtleties, making it clear and harmonious with the intentions of the ancient sages. One who can embody his Dao, employ his names, grasp the ancient to govern the present—achieving order will be as easy as turning one’s palm.

Of those who have spoken of Laozi’s art since ancient times, only the Grand Historian came close. In governance, only Emperor Wen of Han attained a fraction of his Dao. All other perverse and misleading theories are not worth adopting.

Yin Wen’s discussion states: Ban Gu said that the Dao of purity and emptiness nurtures nature and prolongs life but does not extend to things. He did not realize that purity and emptiness are the foundation of laws and institutions, and non-action is the root of all affairs. The Dao covers the world yet does not act as its master; virtue bestows upon the myriad things yet does not claim generosity. This is what sages and worthies esteem, what families and states desire—how could it be merely about nurturing nature and prolonging life? Thus it is said: Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes true; cultivate the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring; cultivate the world with integrity, and one’s virtue becomes universal—this is the unchanging Dao for all ages.

Another day, Xi said: "I am foolish and do not know what to ask. I humbly seek further instruction." Laozi replied: "If you wish to cultivate the self and nurture nature, practice the Dao and follow its standards, refine essence to become spirit, and achieve endless continuity, nothing precedes stillness. Thus, Heaven is still to be upright, Earth is still to be settled, spirit is still to transform, and humans are still to live. When aligning with uprightness, turn inward in reflection, let the mind not harbor reckless thoughts, the mouth not utter reckless words, and the body not make reckless movements. The color of no-color becomes visible, the sound of no-sound becomes audible, the flavor of no-flavor becomes sweet, the teaching of no-words becomes instruction. The numinous radiance descends, fortune and virtue arrive, and harmony and essence respond."

To still the spirit, first bathe and observe purification rites for twenty-five days, then refine the self with precision. When the hun and po are harmonized, one may enter the chamber. Thereafter, a cinnabar serpent may alight upon your heart, or the Queen Mother of the West may descend, or a Dao-body may manifest—these are but the spirits within your body testing you. Do not be startled or afraid. If questioned, do not respond. Even if harmed or offended, do not fear. Simply calm the mind and settle the intent, and the apparition will depart of its own accord.

After twenty-five, forty-five, sixty, eighty, one hundred and five, one hundred and twenty-five, or one hundred and fifty days, spirits will continue to appear, all to test you. Maintain a steadfast mind and do not engage them, for they cannot cause harm. If fear arises and the trial is failed, the Dao will be lost—beware and take heed.

After one hundred and eighty days, the chamber will brighten of itself, and matters of safety, peril, life, and death will be foreknown without exception. The palaces within the body will each become clearly visible. After two hundred and eighty days, all illnesses will vanish. After one year, scars will disappear. After a thousand days, form and spirit will both attain perfection, and one will become a Perfected Person.

Thereupon, Laozi bestowed upon Xi the *Mysterious Cavern*, *Inner Explication*, and other esoteric instructions, along with the Supreme Methods of the Great Clarity, the True Writings of the Three Caverns, the Talismans and Charts of the Numinous Treasure, and the Great Mystery teachings, charging him to instruct the most refined and benevolent so that they might ascend as feathered transcendents, ensuring the transmission would never be severed.

Xi bowed repeatedly, prostrating himself in gratitude, and withdrew.

In the following year, the jiayin year, on the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month, Laozi ascended to Heaven from the southern hill near Xi’s residence. Xi, overcome with sorrow and longing, pleaded for him to stay. Laozi, who had not yet journeyed west but was returning to Heaven, replied that he would wait for Yin Xi to complete his cultivation before they departed together to transform the Hu.

Laozi further instructed Xi: "I shall await you in Shu. If you can purge impurities, still your thoughts, guard the One for a thousand days, purify yourself in fasting, study my scriptures, and ingest the divine elixir to refine your form and enter the subtle, then you may seek me at the Green Ram’s market stall."

Having spoken, he suddenly rose into the air, seated upon a cloud of radiant hues. His face emitted five colors, his body shone with golden light, illuminating the ten directions. Divine kings, warriors, Azure Dragons, White Tigers, qilin, and lions arrayed themselves before and behind him. The lofty immortals of the Nine Heavens, the attendants of the Five Emperors, and the envoys of the Orthodox Unity bearing tablets came to welcome him. Slowly, he ascended to the Celestial Pole Star Palace in the Great Tenuity, which is the Radiant-Soul Treasure of the Heavenly Thearch.

For a long while, he remained visible before vanishing. Xi, his gaze fixed upon the clouds, wept in longing and admiration.

On that day, the rivers swelled, the mountains and streams trembled, and a five-colored light pierced the Great Tenuity, extending to the ten directions.

It is said: Yin Xi’s dwelling stood upon a hill, where he had first built a terrace to observe the stars and await the qi. After Laozi ascended from its midst, people began to call it Laozi’s Mound. The *Exposition of Propriety* states that a great hill is called a *ling*, not a tomb. Yet it was later mistakenly referred to as a burial mound—how lamentable!

Xi then undertook a thousand-day purification fast at the Tower Abbey, cutting himself off from worldly affairs. He studied the true scriptures, ingested the elixir, and practiced qi-absorption. After three years of concentrated effort, his mind congealed and his form dissolved. Hunger and thirst vanished, and he feared neither cold nor heat. He mastered the subtleties of calculation and transformation, the principle of one form and myriad spirits, attaining their utmost mystery.

In the jiayin year, Laozi ascended to Heaven. By the yimao year, he descended again from the Great Tenuity Palace, dividing his body to be reborn in the household of Li, a high official of Shu. Earlier, a stalwart youth had transformed into a green ram, its fur lustrous and pure, its color like blue-green metal. It remained by the infant’s side, eating and drinking without instruction. One day, the ram suddenly vanished, and the child wept without cease. The official ordered the shepherd boy to search everywhere, and it was found in the marketplace.

When Xi arrived in Shu, he inquired among the people but found no one who knew of a Green Ram’s market stall. Suddenly, he saw a boy leading a ram and thought to himself: *Since there is a green ram, and it is in the marketplace, could this be the place my sagely teacher spoke of?* He asked the boy whose ram it was and where he was taking it. The boy replied: "My lady gave birth to a brother, and she cherishes this ram. It went missing for two days, and the child would not stop crying. Now that I’ve found it, I’m taking it home."

Xi then instructed him: "Please tell the lady’s son that Yin Xi has arrived."

The boy did as he was told and went inside to announce it. The child immediately straightened his clothes and rose, saying: "Summon Xi to come forward."

When Xi entered, the household’s halls and courtyards naturally expanded and leveled. A thousand-petaled lotus seat emerged, and Laozi suddenly transformed into a body of white gold, towering and radiant as the sun. A halo encircled his neck, he wore a crown adorned with the seven luminaries, a robe of morning essence, and a cloak of nine-colored parted silk. He sat upon the lotus seat.

The entire household, witnessing this, was astonished. Laozi said: "My true dwelling is the Great Tenuity, my true body is the Primal One. The Great Harmony descends its essence, and the Radiant-Soul becomes human. Host and guest are mutually dependent—why be astonished?"

Yin Xi prostrated himself in joy, weeping and leaping with boundless delight. He bowed and said: "I never dared hope to again behold your celestial countenance. May I ask where the Compassionate Venerable has come from, and how your arising from non-being and entering into being fares?"

Laozi replied calmly: "Since we parted, what have you gained or lost? You have preserved the Dao and guarded the One—has this not benefited you?"

Xi bowed and said: "Since receiving your secret mysteries, I have roughly grasped their wonder. My ancestors have been graced with boundless blessings."

Laozi said: "Xi, the reason I left you behind is that you had not lived long in the world and were deeply entangled in attachments of love. Though I first transmitted the scriptural instructions, you had not yet achieved success. That is why I awaited you here. Now, you have preserved your form and refined your qi for three years, completing the work and attaining its mystery. Your heart is bound with purple cords, your face bears a halo, your golden name is inscribed in the Dark Chart, and your jade tablet is tied to the Purple Chamber. Your qi merges with the Great Tenuity, and you have dissolved your form to unite with the True."

Xi bowed twice and prostrated himself, offering thanks: "The sagely master’s virtue weighs heavier than heaven and earth, his grace surpasses that of father and mother. Heaven and earth can cover and bear me, yet cannot grant me the Dao; father and mother can give me life and raise me, yet cannot make me endure forever."

Laozi said: "This is also your own mysterious allotment—it is not my achievement."

Thereupon, he raised his hand and snapped his fingers. Immediately, the Four Heavenly Kings and the multitudes of immortals from the Three Realms arrived, floating in the void, each holding incense and flowers, bowing their heads to receive his command. Laozi summoned the Five Elder Thearchs and the Four Poles’ Supervisors of Perfected Ones to confer upon Xi the title of *Wenshi Xiansheng* ("Master of the Primordial Beginning"), appointing him as the Supreme Perfected One. He bestowed upon him a purple hibiscus crown, a turquoise-feathered skirt, a cinnabar sash with green sleeves, a rainbow-hued robe with crossed sashes, a net-patterned yellow cord, a nine-colored staff, and five thousand jade lads and jade maidens. Xi was to dwell above the Four Heavens, commanding the immortals of the eight directions.

Xi descended in prostration, face to the ground, and said: "This dust-born child, having encountered the Great Sage, has been granted flesh upon withered bones—a thousand lifetimes’ fortune. To serve as a sweeper when stationed, or as a charioteer when traveling, would be my wish and my honor. Such exalted rank and lavish rites—how could I presume to receive them? I dare not refuse."

Laozi said: "You have long cherished the Dao, your hidden virtue has ascended to be heard, your cultivation has been diligent and laborious, and your mysterious merit is now complete. This allotment is fitting—it is not that I show partiality to you. Strive onward."

Xi, unable to decline, bowed twice more and accepted.

From then on, he was able to ride clouds and mount dragons, soaring through the void, attending the Dragon Chariot and roaming the eight directions.

Laozi then expounded the *Yuanyang Jing* ("Scripture of Primordial Yang") to the Sagely Mother of the Grand Office. Her household—over two hundred, young and old—immediately ascended with their dwelling to the heavens. Laozi, considering the accumulated merit of the Grand Office’s family through generations, had been heard by the Highest Heaven, and thus it was fitting for them to ascend. For this reason, he had been born into their household. Today, in Chengdu, the Green Goat Palace remains, along with the sites of the Birth-Descending Terrace and the Primordial Yang Terrace.

The Tang dynasty Hanlin Academician and Drafter of Edicts, Yue Penggui, was entrusted with composing the palace’s record. Its summary states: "The Dao is distant and boundless, difficult to fathom; its essence is subtle and formless, impossible to probe. It dwells within the imageless and shapeless, abiding before the Great Beginning and the Great Simplicity. The Two Spirits emerged together at the dawn of creation, cleaving open the workings of transformation. The Three Qi intermingled and advanced in misty profusion, scattering the uncarved block to reveal its radiance."

The primordial chaos flowed yet uncoalesced, the clear and turbid divided yet unformed. The Dao is the ancestor of the ten thousand qi, virtue the root of the hundred things. It takes the Two Modes and the Two Luminaries as its descendants, the Four Images and Five Phases as its branches and leaves.

It is further said: shifting worlds to nestle within a gourd, swallowing Vimalakīrti’s square zhang of chamber; shrinking earth’s forms to conceal within the arts, suddenly stilling Rājagṛha’s city. Peach Blossom Spring and Penglai Isle have existed since antiquity and endure to this day. The Scholarly Market and the Secluded Altar appear flourishing at dawn yet wither by dusk. The body rides the virtue-chariot, its wheels turning within the vast and indistinct. The hand grasps the handle of longevity, directing all before the dawn of creation. Serene and non-active, it rests in tranquil self-possession. Transforming the untransformed, all ten thousand transformations abide. Generating the ungenerated, every blade of grass attains its fulfillment.

The hidden depths now opened, the nine qi steam unceasingly. The mysterious transformation widely revealed, the six voids circulate without rest. Establishing the gate of non-dual teaching, it examines the fundamental origin of the Orthodox Unity. First it roamed the Azure Eon—once the Azure Eon had arrived, later it emerged and vanished in the Crimson Clarity—when the Crimson Clarity was complete. Ninety-nine myriad billion years stored within a pellet, five thousand and five hundred layered heavens concealed in an eggshell.

At the height of Shang Gaozong’s reign, when King Wen of Zhou first expounded the *Yi*, divine radiance flowed into the jade embryo, auspicious splendor congealed into golden bones. Seven-hued golden lotuses followed each step, a thousand-year white deer presented omens. Seven hundred disciples pointed toward Fusang in the ancient grove, the Nine-Five Emperor-Lord opened the Sun Palace in the former hall.

Tracing its primordial beginning, examining that distant origin, gazing down upon the dark ford of the past, looking below at the time after the primordial unity—responding to conditions, it established teachings as the model for ten thousand ages; adapting to change without fixed method, it became the standard for a hundred kings. Thus the Great Dao is the crown of the Three Realms, the supreme virtue the ancestral origin of a hundred kings.

The Green Goat Market was the site of the second descent of our sagely ancestor, the Most High Mysterious Origin Heavenly Emperor. Since the Shang Dao had fallen into disorder and the Zhou virtue declined, he passed through the dust of the treasury chambers, abandoned the post of archivist to withdraw into seclusion. Binding his robes, he departed the Wei Gate, crossing west through the Han Pass. Xu Jia held the reins, escorting the former emperor to arrive; Yin Xi divined the winds, knowing the Dao-Lord would surely come. Though briefly parted for three thousand celestial cycles, he once appeared as the Crimson Youth. Reuniting after eight hundred years of age, they forever followed the Yellow and the Old.

Having secretly transmitted the wondrous instructions and discreetly entrusted the subtle words, they renewed the hundred-day covenant and reconvened the assembly of that hour. Briefly they paid homage to the Primordial Beginning, then ascended to the Heaven within Heaven. Forever they served the ancestral master, returning once more to the image beyond images.

Thereupon, the teachings spread far to the lands of Jambudvīpa, Khotan, and Sindhu, converting the kings of Brahman and Aśoka, while the eighty tribes of barbarians all embraced the pure transformation. The savagery of two thousand nations was forever purged of its benighted ways.

Inscribed thus:
At the vast source’s first unfolding, kalpas stretched boundless,
The great Dao in evanescence, the Supreme in mystery.
After the Grand Inception withdrew, the Grand Commencement succeeded,
Within the dark and yellow shell, clear and turbid yet unseparated—
Before heaven and earth, myriad eons passed.
Teachings adapted to conditions, responses flowed without hindrance,
The Three Sovereigns refined their names, the Five Emperors deepened their wisdom,
All under heaven prospered, grasses and grains flourished in abundance.

The Louguan temple set forth, the Han Pass hung its linchpin,
Khotan spread the transformation, Sindhu bestowed its grace,
The formless form, the soundless sound,
No farewell could send it off, no welcome could receive it,
Forced to call it a name, forced to style it a word,
It blazes through the six directions, encompasses the eight cords,
All nations share its covenant, all grains bow in reverence,
None can exhaust it, none can fill it.
Those who practice shallowly dwell long in profit and integrity,
Those who practice deeply attain eternal Great Peace.

It is also said:
He split open creation’s womb, carved out the embryo’s radiance,
Seized sun and moon, wrapped up heaven and earth,
All phenomena exhausted—only the Dao endured alone.
The Three Teachings vied for supremacy, yet the Dao stood highest and most revered.

In the ninth month of the fourth year of Zhonghe during the Tang, the Jiedushi of Xichuan erected a stele at Qingyang Palace, which remains extant today.

Lord Lao spoke to Yin Xi: “You once wished to follow me on a distant journey. Now that the Dao is perfected, we may traverse beyond the eight cords.”
Thereupon, he exhaled the hidden script of the eight directions and bestowed it upon him.

Yin Xi received it in full, then summoned the Eight Radiance Cloud Chariot, harnessed five-colored divine dragons, raised the Vermilion Nodes of the Flowing Empyrean, unfurled the Nine-Light Crane Canopy, with twelve guardian officials leading the way, spirit soldiers bearing banners, and ninety thousand flying immortals following in phalanxes of chanting wheels. Lions cleared the path, phoenixes flanked the carriage, and they soared through the void in boundless flight. The Perfected One was accompanied by the Four Heavenly Kings.

Celestial music resounded, mournful reed pipes shook the heavens. They arrived at the Sun’s Cavern and the Mountain of Eternal Dawn, where they beheld the Cinnabar Shelves of the Supporting Branches and scattered the crimson blossoms of the Ruo Tree. They gazed upon the Azure Sea, embraced the Eastern Well, and passed the Jade Pool Palace.

The Divine King of Dawn Valley and the Azure Lads of the Eastern Sea, along with hosts of immortals, presented cinnabar fruits and golden nectars of jade-green wine. Next, they ascended Ancestor Mountain, viewed the Mushroom Fields, gathered spirit-nourishing herbs, and rested at Penglai Palace.

They then journeyed south to Phoenix Mountain, ascended Green Mound, crossed Purple Mansion, where the Supreme Prime Perfected and the Master of Purple Mansion offered Nine-Light Sweet Dew, White Jade Essence of the Script, and Azure Grove’s White Seeds. This mountain, also called Xiao Mound, yields the Essence of Nine Lights and Fire-Washed Cloth.

Next, they ascended Long Departure Mountain, crossed the Vermilion Essence Ford, and entered the Great Cinnabar Palace, where the Lady of the Southern Culmen and attendant immortal maidens served Jade-Flower Wine and Fiery Red Date Elixir. Arriving at Crimson Mountain, they beheld the Land of Flowing Fire, rested at the Scarlet Mound’s Gate, and the Jade Perfected of Great Harmony, the Elder of the Vermilion Ridge, presented Flaming Bone Marrow, Flying Cinnabar Peaches, and the Nectar of Thunder’s Ripple.

Then they traveled west to Tortoise Terrace, entered the Seven Treasures Garden, and beheld the Flying Purple Script. Passing the Flowing Essence Gate, the Nine Numinous Metal Mother and the Primordial Sovereign of Grand Simplicity offered Jade-Script Dates—each as large as a jar—while attendant maidens presented Returning-Soul Incense, Dark-Light Peaches, and Golden-Purple Intertwined Pears.

They wandered through the Forest of Ascension, where the Seven Numinous Elders and hosts of immortals served Cloud Brew and Jade Essence, along with Quaking Gold and Mystic Paste. Crossing the Weak Waters, ascending Phoenix Mountain, entering the Dragon’s Cavern, embracing the Jade Pool, they rested at Kunwu Mountain, where the White Emperor Celestial Lord and the Five Penetrations Immortals gathered Seven Luminous Stone Mushrooms, Flowing Essence Jade Paste, Purple Joy Vermilion Essence, and Golden Light Cinnabar Elixir to offer them.

Later, they journeyed north to Kongtong Mountain, passed the Cavern of Shade Palace, where the Northern Culmen Perfected Lord and the Four Blossoms Immortals presented Ten-Knotted Spirit Herbs, Dark Cloud Plums, and Void Melons—melons that ripen once in an eon. Ascending the Dark Mound, they viewed the Eight Silk Pools of Northern Darkness and rested at the Vast Cold Ruins, where the Grand Simplicity Immortal Elder served Crimson Tree Cinnabar Treasures and Three Mysteries Purple Crabapples.

Arriving at Bell Mountain, passing the Cloud-Gathering Palace, the Northern Culmen Supreme Prime Perfected and the Five Penetrations Perfected Immortals offered Dark Jade Mushrooms, Night-Glowing Cavern Herbs, and Cloud Paste Jade Liquor. They then ascended the Central Marchmount, Kunlun Mountain, wandered the Jade Terrace of the Mystic Garden, entered the Gate of Wind—this was no mortal realm, nor the Kunlun of Western Shu, but the divine isles of the Three Mountains and Sea Islands.

They beheld the Seven Treasures’ Jade Grove, listened to the nine-plumed phoenix’s song, and gazed upon the sun, moon, and stars shining below, revealing the Four Heavens as if on the palm of a hand. Above stood golden terraces and jade towers, seven-treasured palaces, radiant day and night—the abode of celestial gods and immortals. On one side were two hundred forty gates, where Jade Grove Purple Crabapples and Ten-Thousand-Year Spirit Peaches grew, their azure leaves rustling in harmony like zither and lute, attuned to the pitch pipes. Here dwelt the immortals of the Grand Simplicity’s Nine Palaces.

All was a natural celestial kitchen, where sustenance appeared at will. The heavenly retinue was exquisite beyond compare, the music beyond description—truly the Pure Capital of the cosmos, the grandest spectacle of divine perfected beings.

When Perfected Yin first received the office of Divine Youth, he accompanied Lord Lao on a tour of this wondrous realm, visiting the Five Marchmounts, famous mountains, grotto-heavens, palaces, and the abodes of the Four Seas’ rivers, springs, and water palaces—places where high immortals and lower administrators governed. At every site they passed, immortal officials emerged to escort and attend Lord Lao. Upon arrival, they entered grand halls and central chambers, where the host—whether styled Sacred Emperor, Perfected King, Lord, Marquis, Duke, or Minister—prostrated in reverence, ears inclined to receive his command.

Immortal maidens, earthly administrators, and the spirits of mountains and waters gathered like rain. The assembled perfected sovereigns and sacred emperors consulted on matters of the Two Modes and Three Radiance, the fluctuations of yin and yang, the cycles of kalpas long and short, the longevity or brevity of the Three Sovereigns’ Mandates, the rise and fall of safety and peril, the fortunes and misfortunes of the myriad people, the ranks of Daoist cultivation and immortal progression, the methods of harmonizing the cosmic order, and the suppression of the Nine-Nine Disasters of Yang.

Some sought the origins of virtue and the Dao, the subtleties of the formless and soundless. Lord Lao responded to each inquiry, answering in kind, adapting to the languages of the various heavens. His words were profound and recondite, beyond mortal transmission or comprehension.

It was at this time that he expounded the *Scripture of Petitioning Judgment* to the Queen Mother.

Lord Lao said to Yin Xi: “I shall now ascend with you to pay court to the Supreme Highest and traverse the imperial realms.”
Thereupon, the Eight Assemblies of Numinous Sounds arose, cloud-borne steeds converged from all directions, and they gently ascended into the sky. They toured the Nine Heavens, where the emperors of each heaven, riding in chariots with banners, accompanied by tens of thousands of jade lads and maidens, came forth to welcome them.

Lord Lao entered their palaces, where they served Jade Essence Royal Fruits, Moon Nectar Cloud Brew, Azure Elixir Flowing Perfume, Eightfold Orchid Delicacies, and Spirit Mushroom Immortal Fruits. Radiance illuminated the feast, celestial music filled the air, and the divine songs were wondrous beyond compare.

The Perfected Divine Immortals of the Celestial Heavens all bore radiant halos above their crowns, each bowing in reverence to inquire of the spontaneous, supreme, most subtle, and perfectly true Dao of the Primordial Unity of the Imperial One.

Thereupon, the Great Perfected Lord of the Upper Prime, the Grand Immortal Elder of the Middle Prime, and the Immortal Earl, Ministers, and Officers of the Lower Prime of Great Clarity ascended in jade-green and yellow cloud chariots, drawn by azure rainbows, qilin, lions, and phoenixes, their canopies adorned with intertwining luminous rosy clouds and soaring cranes. They bore the Sun Essence Banners of the Perfected and the Standards of the Immortal Command, attended by divine immortals and numinous officials numbering one hundred and fifty thousand—seventy thousand from the Upper Prime, fifty thousand from the Middle Prime, and thirty thousand from the Lower Prime—each with their mounts, canopies, and regalia of office.

The Emperors and Immortals of the Celestial Heavens all prostrated themselves in welcome as Lord Lao ascended to the Vermilion City of the Sun’s Gate and the Jade Pearl Palace of Upper Clarity. There, Lord Lao commanded Xi to pay homage to the Most High Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao. Thus, he bestowed upon Xi twelve treasures: the Ring-Stalwart Elixir Fruit, the Hidden Dragon Mushroom, the Pearl Radiance Jade Nectar, and nine other sacred items.

Then, following Lord Lao, they descended to the numinous mountains of Tianshui and proceeded to the Western Regions.
