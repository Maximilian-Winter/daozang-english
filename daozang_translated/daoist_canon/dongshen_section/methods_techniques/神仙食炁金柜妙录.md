**The Wondrous Record of the Golden Casket on Immortal Qi Consumption**
*By Master Jing He*

**Method for Ingesting Yin-Yang Talismans and Summoning the Jade Maidens of the Six Jia**

Those who seek to cultivate longevity and study immortality must first consume *qi* and cease grain, preserving essence to nurture the spirit. This method follows gradual stages; one must not deviate from the proper sequence or rashly ascend, for haste leads to failure, and recklessness to ruin. Adhere strictly to these steps to avoid error.

When ceasing grain, the Five Spirits may scatter and be assailed by wayward thoughts. One should ingest the *Talisman for Immortals to Cease Grain*. The method of ingestion: at dawn, face east, hold the talisman in the left hand and water in the right. Take one step forward and intone:

*"So-and-so delights in the true Dao, consuming the harmonious *qi* of the center. On this Jiazi day, the Jade Maiden of Great Mystery, styled ‘Bearing Wings,’ attends and serves. May So-and-so’s mobile kitchen be established wherever he goes, his desires fulfilled, and hunger and thirst averted. Whether in great armies or small, whether among many or few, all shall be sated."*

After the incantation, swallow the talisman with the water. From Jiazi to the end of the sixty-day cycle, recite this invocation daily. For other *jia* days, change only the name of the Jade Maiden in each ten-day period; the rest of the invocation remains unchanged.

There are two talismans—one yin, one yang—inscribed according to the yin-yang days of the moon. For the yang talisman, from the character *jiazi* to *bingyin* (the *yin* character), cover thirty yang days without error. For the yin talisman, from *yichou* to *dingmao*, change to *dingmao* and cover thirty yin days without error.

The yang talisman governs the days *jia, bing, wu, geng, ren, zi, yin, chen, wu, shen, xu*, inscribed in cinnabar. The yin talisman governs the days *yi, ding, ji, xin, gui, chou, mao, si, wei, you, hai*, inscribed in ink.

The Jade Maiden of Jiazi is named *Great Mystery*, styled *Bearing Wings*. For the entire ten-day period, invoke: *"On this Jiazi day, the Jade Maiden of Great Mystery, styled ‘Bearing Wings,’ attends and serves So-and-so..."* (and so forth).

The Jade Maiden of Jiaxu is named *Yellow Simplicity*, styled *Unblemished*.
The Jade Maiden of Jiashen is named *Great Simplicity*, styled *Jasper Stone*.
The Jade Maiden of Jiawu is named *Crimson Palace*, styled *Cloud Years*.
The Jade Maiden of Jiachen is named *Saluting Essence*, styled *Numinous Simplicity*.
The Jade Maiden of Jiayin is named *Azure Waist*, styled *Wise Essence*.

Each Jade Maiden serves for one ten-day period. At dawn, hold the talisman and water, recite the invocation, and ingest it. The Jade Maiden will respond to the heart’s intent and protect the practitioner.

This method is not only for personal cultivation but can also enable others to cease grain—whether ten, five, or any number—all may achieve their desires with ease. The key is sincere devotion, purity of mind, and uniform alignment toward the sun. Venerate the Dao of the master you follow, bow twice while reciting the names, and ingest the talisman according to the method; all will then be able to abstain from food.

The *Explication of Nodal Passages* states: *"Abundant virtue is profound. Daily, the six *jia* and six *gui* intermingle and are swallowed to generate spirit-essence."*

The *Scripture* also says: *"Who can have surplus to offer the world? Only those who possess the Dao."* The commentary notes: *"Only those who can gather it to replenish the cinnabar field, guide *qi* to congeal essence, and comprehend this are those who possess the Dao."*

**Method of Qi Ingestion at the Eleven Hours of the Day**
*By the Frugal Eater of Mount Song*

- Midnight: 7×7 = 49 swallows
- Dawn: 6×6 = 36 swallows
- Mealtime: 5×5 = 25 swallows
- Mid-morning: 4×4 = 16 swallows
- Noon: 9×9 = 81 swallows
- Afternoon: 8×8 = 64 swallows
- Dusk: 7×7 = 49 swallows
- Sunset: 6×6 = 36 swallows
- Nightfall: 5×5 = 25 swallows
- Late evening: 4×4 = 16 swallows
- Midnight: 9×9 = 81 swallows
- Cockcrow: 8×8 = 64 swallows

The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *"The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root; cultivate this, and you may endure forever."* This is called *natural consumption*. *Natural* refers to the *Flowery Pool*; the *Flowery Pool* is the saliva in the mouth. Inhale and exhale according to the method, swallow it, and hunger will cease.

Upon ceasing grain for three days, by the seventh day, slight dizziness may occur—do not be alarmed. After twenty-one days, the method is perfected. *Qi* strength increases daily; if you wish to eat, you may; if not, rest. Abstain from sexual activity to avoid losing essence and *qi*. Eating grain disrupts the flow; consuming *qi* dispels grain.

**Method for Ingesting Qi to Dispel Grain**

The method: First close the mouth, draw in *qi*, and swallow it. Complete at least 360 swallows; do not exceed this. The more swallows, the better—daily swallows of a thousand enhance clarity. After swallowing, eat one meal a day. After ten days, you will no longer need food. Thereafter, *qi* constantly enters without exiting, and the mind remains sated with *qi*. After three days without food, the abdomen may feel empty as if hungry, or urine may turn reddish-yellow. Take nine fine jujubes or nine pieces of dried meat the size of jujubes. Mentally consume one, or two, up to three, over a day and night—no more than nine jujubes. If the mind does not crave food, there is no need to consume them. Regularly hold a jujube pit to receive *qi*, allowing saliva to flow in the mouth at night—this is excellent.

**Method of the Yellow Qi**
*By the Perfected One*

The method of consuming the yellow *qi*: Constantly envision the spleen as full, the stomach suffused with yellow *qi* and moisture. A spirit three *cun* tall, clad in yellow, stands as an image, each hand holding a person also dressed in yellow.

**Method of the Yellow Qi**
*By the Perfected One*

When you see them, secretly call out: "Yellow Ever-Child, Yellow Ever-Child, the Perfected One of the Yellow Court now lives within me as my own ears." Offer sweet wine, dried meat, divine elixirs, and magic mushrooms—all that may be consumed—summoning them to stand before you, then swallow them. At dawn, if hungry, face the sun and perform the method as above until sated.

**Method of Circulating Qi**
At first, circulating *qi* may feel unregulated, but with prolonged practice, it becomes effortless. Lie flat on your back, hands clenched in a firm grip, feet spaced four or five *cun* apart, arms likewise. Remove the pillow and breathe gently for four sets of nine—three hundred and sixty breaths. Your body will feel as if unclothed, bones and joints all loosened.

At first, maintain the posture for thirty breaths, then naturally shift. You will feel *qi* like clouds moving through your body, circulating throughout, moistening your form, irrigating your skin. The five viscera and six bowels will all be filled, and old illnesses dispersed. Persist without ceasing, and you will attain robust health.

The firm grip resembles an infant’s curled hands. When first circulating *qi*, stabilize your body and harmonize your breath. Do not force it—if disharmony arises, pause, and resume only when balanced. Maintain this practice without weariness. Brief practice yields modest results; prolonged practice yields profound ones.

When *qi* arrives, the body settles; when the body settles, the breath through the nose harmonizes; when the breath harmonizes, pure *qi* arrives; when pure *qi* arrives, the body grows warm; when warmth arises, slight sweat appears. Do not rise while sweating, and the spirit will calm; when the spirit calms, the Dao reveals itself.

To cultivate *qi*, strive for endurance. Abandon anger, sorrow, and worry—then *qi* will not scatter. When *qi* is undisturbed, true *qi* arrives; when true *qi* arrives, the mouth becomes sweet; when the mouth is sweet, saliva increases; when saliva increases, the breath through the nose lengthens subtly; when the breath lengthens, the five viscera stabilize; when the viscera stabilize, *qi* flows in proper order, all illnesses retreat, food tastes delicious, and the three *qi* harmonize. Then the body grows light and strong, life extends, and you attain longevity, ultimately achieving immortality.

In circulating *qi*, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, drawing it gently—this is called "long breath." There is one way to inhale and six ways to exhale. The one inhalation is *absorption*; the six exhalations are *blowing*, *breathing*, *sighing*, *exhaling*, *hissing*, and *swallowing*—all methods of expelling *qi*.

Ordinary breathing consists of one exhalation and one inhalation, without such distinctions. For the method of long breath and exhaling *qi*, when cold, *blow*; when warm, *breathe*; adapt to cure illnesses. *Blowing* dispels cold; *breathing* dispels heat; *sighing* dispels wind; *exhaling* dispels pain; *hissing* dispels vexation and lowers *qi*; *hissing* also disperses stagnation; *swallowing* relieves exhaustion.

When people are exhausted, they often *hiss* and *swallow*. Daoists circulating *qi* generally avoid *hissing* and *swallowing*, for they disrupt long breath. This method applies to both men and women, originating from the immortal classics.

The Dao treasures essence: bestowed upon others, it gives life; retained within, it nurtures the self. Nurturing the self leads to eternal transcendence, and one’s name endures among the immortals. Bestowing life upon others fulfills merit, and with merit complete, one withdraws. Withdrawal risks entanglement in the mundane—how much worse to squander essence recklessly? Such waste accumulates unnoticed, leading to decline and ruin.

Heaven and Earth possess yin and yang; yin and yang are what humans prize. When prized in accord with the Dao, one must only guard against waste. Lord Lao said: "Essence is the river-source of blood and vessels, the numinous spirit guarding the bones. When essence departs, bones wither; when bones wither, death follows. Thus, it is treasured."

The body is a kingdom; the heart, its ruler; essence, its minister; *qi*, its people. *Qi* transforms into essence; essence into spirit; spirit into the infant. The infant ascends to become the Perfected One, then the Celestial Child—this is the True Unity.

Heaven has three luminaries: sun, moon, and stars. Humans have three treasures: spirit, *qi*, and essence. The three cinnabar fields are: between the brows, the Mud Pill Palace—upper cinnabar field; the heart, the Crimson Palace—middle cinnabar field; three *cun* below the navel, the lower cinnabar field. Constantly visualize the Celestial Child, Perfected One, and Infant within these three cinnabar fields—this is the essential Dao.

Lord Lao said: "From dawn to dusk, practice unceasingly, and you will attain long life." One *cun* inward from between the brows is the Hall of Light; two *cun* inward, the Cavern Chamber; three *cun* inward, the upper cinnabar field. Here dwells the Upper Primordial True Unity, the Celestial Child, named Yuanxian, also called Imperial Minister.

The heart is the Crimson Palace, the middle cinnabar field, home to the Middle Primordial True Unity, the Perfected One, named Zidan, also called Radiant Firmness. Three *cun* below the navel is the lower cinnabar field, dwelling of the Lower Primordial True Unity, the Infant, named Yuanyang, also called Valley Mystery. These two luminaries govern circulating and holding *qi*—always maintain awareness of them.

**Secret of Circulating Qi**
To seek immortality, three great methods exist: first, preserve essence; second, circulate *qi*; third, ingest elixirs. Each of these has depths and shallows; without encountering a perfected master or enduring hardship, they cannot be swiftly grasped.

Yet the methods for preserving essence number in the hundreds, and elixir formulas in the thousands—all demand diligence and perseverance. Thus, circulating *qi* can cure all illnesses, ward off plagues, repel snakes and beasts, stanch wounds and bleeding, allow dwelling in water, stave off hunger and thirst, and extend lifespan. Its essence lies in embryonic breathing.

Embryonic breathing no longer relies on mouth or nose—like being within the womb, one attains the Dao. For circulating *qi*, the method requires a secluded chamber, closed doors, a warm, thick mat, and a pillow two and a half *cun* high, level with the body. Lie flat on your back, close your eyes, and hold your breath, stopping at the chest. Place a goose feather on your nose—if it remains still for three hundred breaths, you will hear nothing, see nothing, think nothing. Gradually, these will fade away.

If consuming raw or cold foods, the five pungent vegetables, fish, or meat, or if drawing *qi* while harboring joy, anger, sorrow, or anxiety, not only will it be of no benefit—it will further aggravate *qi*-related illnesses, causing ascending *qi* to rebel upward. If unable to hold the breath, then practice gradually.

Begin with three breaths, five breaths, seven breaths, or nine breaths before releasing, then swallow the *qi*. If one can sustain twelve breaths, this is called "minor passage"; if one can hold it for one hundred twenty breaths without release, this is called "major passage." This is the essential method for cultivating the body.

Always practice during the time after midnight when *qi* is born, holding the breath while silently counting in the mind until the ears hear nothing. For circulating and ingesting *qi*, the period from noon to midnight is called "dead *qi*"—it must not be used. Only the *qi* at *you*-hour (5–7 p.m.) may be ingested, for it is near dawn and thus not "dead *qi*"; even so, its use is permissible.

The proper times for ingesting *qi* are *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* hours. However, in the three winter months, *zi*-hour *qi* must not be ingested due to cold; in the three summer months, *wu*-hour *qi* must not be ingested due to heat. One must adjust according to the body’s condition: if the abdomen is too cold, take *qi* near sunrise or at noon; if the abdomen is too hot, take *qi* at midnight or during the *ping*-hour (3–5 a.m.).

When ingesting *qi* in the three cold months of winter, do so in a small room with a charcoal fire to warm it—this ensures harmony in the abdomen. During extreme summer heat, take *qi* at midnight to greatly cool the body.

Before ingesting *qi*, always assess the body’s comfort and adjust naturally. If at ease, continue without interruption; if discomfort arises, add guiding and pulling movements—this is especially effective.

When first ingesting *qi*, use the breath skillfully, taking it to the point of fullness. After fullness, perform guiding movements to achieve natural peace. Once peace is attained, illness and suffering will vanish forever, and the Dao will be realized.

Those skilled in using *qi* can exhale upon water to make it flow backward, exhale upon fire to extinguish its flames, exhale upon tigers and leopards to make them cower and hide, and exhale upon wounds and bleeding to stanch them.

**Methods for Treating All Illnesses**
For ailments in the throat or chest, raise the pillow to seven *cun*; for ailments below the heart, raise it to four *cun*; for ailments below the navel, remove the pillow.

Exhaling through the mouth and inhaling through the nose is called "draining"; closing the mouth, warming the *qi*, and swallowing it is called "supplementing."

To guide *qi* for head ailments, tilt the head back; for waist and leg ailments, press down the toes; for chest ailments, curl the toes; to dispel cold, heat, or discomfort in the abdomen, hold the breath until the abdomen swells, then exhale through the nose—repeat until cured.

1. Sit upright, stretch the waist, legs, and arms, place hands on the ground, and slowly exhale through the mouth while inhaling through the nose to relieve pain in the chest and lungs. Swallow the *qi* warmly, close the eyes, and proceed.

2. Sit upright, stretch the waist, inhale through the nose, hold the breath, and shake the head forward and backward thirty times each to dispel dizziness, blurred vision, and vertigo. Close the eyes while shaking.

3. Lie on the left side, exhale through the mouth, and inhale through the nose to relieve accumulations and discomfort below the heart.

4. Sit upright, stretch the waist, inhale slowly through the nose, and hold the nose with the right hand to treat dim vision. If there is nasal discharge, expel the breath through the nose—this also treats deafness and cold-induced headaches, continuing until sweat appears.

5. Lie flat on the back, slowly exhale through the mouth, and inhale through the nose to relieve tension in the abdomen.

After eating, swallow *qi* in small amounts up to ten times, ensuring it is warm. If the *qi* is cold, it may cause dry heaving and abdominal pain—counter this by inhaling through the nose and swallowing seven to ten times, or up to a hundred, to fill the abdomen, dispel pathogenic *qi*, and supplement the upright *qi*.

6. Lie on the right side, inhale through the nose, exhale slightly through the mouth up to ten times, rub the hands together until warm, and massage the abdomen to guide the *qi* downward, relieving pain and oppression in the flanks. Stop when cured.

7. Sit upright, stretch the waist, raise both arms, and extend the palms upward. Inhale through the nose, hold the breath to the limit for seven breaths—this is called "King of Shu’s Terrace," which dispels accumulations below the flanks.

8. Lie face down without a pillow, raise both feet, inhale through the nose four times, then exhale through the nose four times. When exhaling fully, let a slight breath re-enter the nose without the nose sensing it, to dispel body heat and back pain.

9. Sit upright, stretch the waist, raise the left hand with palm facing up, and withdraw the right hand to relieve pain in both arms and the back, as well as *qi* stagnation and accumulations.

10. Sit upright, clasp the hands around the knees, hold the breath, and distend the abdomen for two or three sets of seven. When full, exhale—continue until the *qi* flows smoothly. Practicing this for ten years, the old will regain a youthful appearance.

11. Sit upright, stretch the waist, and tilt the body left and right while closing the eyes and inhaling through the nose to dispel head wind. Hold to the limit for seven breaths, then stop.

12. Sit upright, stretch the waist, and inhale through the nose up to ten times to relieve abdominal fullness from food. Stop when comfortable; if not, repeat. This also treats cold *qi* in the abdomen.

13. Sit upright, stretch the waist, and assume the posture of drawing a bow to full draw. This treats restlessness in the limbs, back tension, and may be practiced daily or frequently for benefit.

14. Sit upright, stretch the waist, raise the right hand with palm facing up, support the left flank with the left hand, and inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths.

This relieves stomach cold and indigestion, curing the condition.

Sit upright, stretch the waist, raise the left hand with palm facing up, support the right flank with the right hand, and inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This removes stagnant blood and treats all conditions related to *qi* absorption.

Place both hands behind to prop up the body, tilt the head back, inhale through the nose, and swallow the *qi* dozens of times. This dispels heat and treats dead flesh or injuries in the body, curing them.

Lie flat on the back, fully extend the limbs, inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths, and shake the feet thirty times before stopping. This relieves cold in the chest and feet, as well as generalized numbness, cold reversal, and cough.

Lie on the back, bend the knees outward so the inner sides of the knees face each other, grasp the feet with the hands, stretch the waist, and inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This removes numbness, heat, pain, and paralysis of the legs.

Sit upright, clasp the head with both hands, and bend forward and backward—this is called "opening the flanks." It relieves bodily heaviness and obstruction, curing all such conditions.

Crouch and extend the right leg, clasp the left knee with both hands, stretch the waist, and inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This treats difficulty in bending and stretching, pain when bowing or rising, muscle pain, stagnant blood, and numbness.

Crouch and extend the left leg, clasp the right knee with both hands, stretch the waist, and inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths, then extend the left leg outward. This relieves difficulty in bending and stretching, pain when bowing or rising, and leg pain.
*(Alternate version: This also dispels wind, dim vision, and deafness.)*

Lie flat on the back, extend both hands, grasp the perineum, and press as if an oil sac encloses cinnabar. For dampness below the genitals, difficulty urinating, sagging scrotum, heaviness in the lower abdomen, or discomfort—if there is heat in the abdomen, exhale through the mouth and inhale through the nose dozens of times, without swallowing. If there is no heat in the abdomen, perform seven breaths to warm the *qi*, then swallow it ten times.

Lie prone, look toward the heels, stretch the waist, and inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This relieves cramping pain, spasms, and soreness in the feet.

Crouch, clasp both knees with both hands, stretch the waist, and inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This removes lumbar numbness and back pain.

Lie on the back, extend the legs and arms, turn the heels inward to face each other, and inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This treats dead flesh and cold pain in the feet and legs.

Lie on the back, extend the hands and legs, place the left heel on the right foot, inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This relieves undigested food in the stomach and bitter vomiting.

Crouch, stretch the waist, grasp both heels with both hands, inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths, directing the *qi* toward the knees. This removes bodily numbness and counterflow vomiting.

Lie on the back, extend both hands, point the toes upward, inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This relieves cramping pain in the abdomen.

Lie on the back, place the right heel on the left big toe, inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This removes cold reversal. If the feet are misaligned, adjust the heel position as needed.

Lie on the back, place the left heel on the right big toe, inhale through the nose to the limit for seven breaths. This removes generalized numbness.

If the illness is on the left, sit upright, stretch the waist, look to the right, inhale through the nose to the limit, then exhale, repeating dozens of times. Perform this with eyes closed.

If the illness involves accumulations below the heart, sit upright, stretch the waist, face the sun, tilt the head back, slowly inhale through the nose, and swallow the *qi*, repeating thirty times. Perform this with eyes open.

If the illness is on the right, sit upright, stretch the waist, look to the left, slowly inhale through the nose and swallow the *qi*, repeating dozens of times.

The *Yuanyang Jing* states: Regularly inhale *qi* through the nose, hold it in the mouth, swish it with the tongue, moisten the lips and teeth, then swallow it. If one can do this a thousand times day and night, it is greatly beneficial. However, one should eat sparingly—excess food causes *qi* counterflow, blocking the hundred vessels. When the vessels are blocked, *qi* does not flow, and illness arises.

Xuanhe says: Will is the spirit of *qi*; *qi* is the essence that fills the body. Those who cultivate it well preserve their life; those who neglect it lose their form. Thus, the method of circulating *qi* requires moderation in eating, calmness of mind, firmness of will, and focus of intent. Each of these leads to attaining the Dao and becoming an immortal. Those who practice *qi* absorption must carefully follow these instructions to succeed.

The Perfected One says: The Way of Heaven waxes and wanes; human affairs often face adversity. In perilous circumstances, those who cannot exercise caution cannot overcome hardship—this is universal. Thus, those who cultivate their nature but do not know the method of self-caution are unworthy to discuss the Dao of nourishing life and absorbing *qi*. Therefore, self-caution is the foundation.

The sage remains vigilant even in safety, always taking reverence and fear as the root. Without awe and restraint, all affairs will fail. The *Classic* states: "If one does not fear authority, great authority will come." Thus, those who govern the body without reverence will be abandoned by friends; those who govern a household without reverence will be disrespected by servants; those who govern a state without reverence will be invaded by neighbors; those who govern the world without reverence will lose the Dao. Therefore, reverence is the gateway to life and death, the foundation of ritual and teaching, the cause of survival and ruin, the root of fortune and misfortune, and the origin of good and ill. Without reverence, the scholar cannot establish reputation; the farmer cannot cultivate crops; the artisan cannot set standards; the merchant cannot expand wealth; the child cannot be truly filial; the father cannot show true kindness.

Ministers without reverence will fail to establish merit; rulers without reverence will leave the altars of state unsettled. Those who don garments to nurture life, refine embryonic breathing, study the supreme Dao, and aspire to the esoteric arts of immortals—if they lose their reverence, their minds will fall into chaos and remain untamed, their forms will grow restless and never still, their spirits will scatter and dissipate, their wills will drift and their intentions dim. What should live will die; what should die will perish swiftly. What should succeed will fail; what should prosper will turn to misfortune. Reverence is like water and fire—it must never be forgotten, even for a moment.

Without reverence, a man’s sons and younger brothers become adversaries, his wives and concubines turn to foes. Thus, the highest revere the Dao; the next revere things; the next revere others; the lowest revere only themselves. Therefore, those who are vigilant over themselves are not constrained by others; those who fear for themselves are not controlled by external forces. Heed the small, and you will not dread the great; guard against the near, and you will not regret the distant. Those who grasp this truth will find that dragons in water cannot harm them, tigers and rhinoceroses on land cannot wound them, and slander in the world cannot touch them. Those who master this principle will have perfected all things.

Most illnesses arise abruptly, and lives are cut short prematurely—largely due to the perils of diet. The dangers of diet exceed even those of sensual indulgence. Sensual pleasures may be forsaken for years, but food cannot be abandoned for a single day. Its benefits are vast, yet its harms run deep. Among the hundred flavors, some clash in nature, violating prohibitions and turning into slow poisons. Some accumulate over years to form illness; others bring sudden calamity and swift ruin.

From the summer solstice to the autumn equinox, avoid rich, greasy, and hard baked goods, for these conflict with wine, juices, fruits, and melons. Though no harm may be felt at first, illness will take root and manifest in autumn, often as violent fluxes—all because one endured excessive cold in summer or indulged in immoderate eating. Yet some assume the day their illness appears marks its onset, unaware that its causes have long been accumulating. To practice true self-vigilance, one must be cautious in the slightest matters.

Those who cultivate their nature, practice qi-nourishing embryonic breathing, and pursue the supreme Dao should reduce thought, reduce reflection, reduce desires, reduce affairs, reduce speech, reduce laughter, reduce sorrow, reduce joy, reduce delight, reduce anger, reduce preferences, and reduce aversions. Practicing these twelve reductions is the essential agreement for learning the Dao and nurturing life. Excessive thought wearies the spirit; excessive reflection scatters the will; excessive desire harms the resolve; excessive affairs exhaust the body; excessive speech provokes qi contention; excessive laughter injures the viscera; excessive sorrow constricts the heart; excessive joy overflows the intent; excessive delight confounds and disorders the will; excessive anger unsettles the hundred vessels; excessive preference leads to obsession and confusion; excessive aversion brings emaciation and joylessness. Failing to eliminate these twelve excesses is the root of life’s ruin and qi’s depletion. Only by avoiding excess and deficiency does one approach the Dao.

Thus, recluses suffer few illnesses, while wanderers endure many afflictions—the difference lies in simplicity and complexity. For this reason, farmers live long, while nobles die young, a testament to the effects of desires’ abundance or scarcity. The common people vie for profit, while Daoists seldom scheme. Ordinary people cannot be without desires or affairs, but by restraining selfish impulses, curbing reckless thoughts, calming the body, and reducing reflection, these gradually subside of their own accord.

Feng Junda said: The body should always be active, but not to excess; food should always be moderate, but not so little as to induce deficiency. Constantly avoid rich and greasy foods, limit salty and sour flavors, quiet contemplation, temper joy and anger, abandon frivolous pursuits, and be cautious in the bedchamber. In spring and summer, discharge and disperse; in autumn and winter, store and conserve. Furthermore, raw fish, uncooked meat, and all cold-natured foods often harm people—swiftly severing these is greatly beneficial. The mind should dwell on goodness, avoiding schemes, deceit, or wicked deeds. Such things deeply shame the spirit and shorten life. Beware! Be vigilant! Do not transgress.

Peng Zu said: Heavy clothing and thick bedding prevent the body from enduring hardship, leading to illnesses from wind and cold. Rich meats, fatty sweets, drunkenness, and overindulgence give rise to hernias and accumulations. Exquisite beauties and a house full of pampered concubines invite the calamity of depletion and damage. Seductive sounds and mournful melodies delight the heart and please the ear, yet breed infatuation and obsession. Galloping excursions and hunting on the plains may induce madness and delusion. Scheming for victory, seizing chaos, and annexing the weak ultimately lead to ruin through arrogance and excess.

These are the warnings of the sages against losing proper measure—ought one not reflect and take heed? The Dao of nurturing life and ingesting qi requires avoiding prolonged walking, sitting, listening, or gazing. One must not force eating or drinking, nor indulge in sorrow, anxiety, or grief. Eat when hungry, drink when thirsty; after eating, walk several hundred paces—greatly beneficial to one’s health. Do not eat at night; if you must, walk about five *li* afterward to avoid harm. Engage in some activity at dawn and dusk, but do not remain idle—moderation is best. Do not exhaust yourself, yet neither should you rest without purpose. Thus it is said: flowing water does not stagnate, a door hinge does not rot, for they move and do not cease.

It is further said: Those who ingest qi must know how to regulate and protect without imbalance. Hence it is said: prolonged gazing harms the blood, prolonged exposure harms the qi, prolonged standing harms the bones, prolonged walking harms the sinews, prolonged sitting harms the flesh. Excessive contemplation and forced vigor harm one, as do sorrow, grief, joy, anger, unfulfilled desires, constant worries, improper cold and warmth, and the failure to harmonize yin and yang. All intercourse must follow the methods of *daoyin* and protective arts. If one can avoid these myriad harms and further understand the safeguards of yin and yang, this is the Dao of immortality.

Ordinary people know only to crave the five flavors, unaware that primordial qi can be drunk. The sage knows the toxicity of the five flavors and thus does not crave them, knowing primordial qi can be ingested and so remains silent, aligning breath with essence. Those who ingest qi should thoroughly examine this text in its entirety, carefully practicing its teachings—then the great Dao is complete.
