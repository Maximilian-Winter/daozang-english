*The Supreme Jade Formula from Behind the Elbow of the Most High*
Compiled by Xiaobingzi Lu Daoyuan

Long ago, Chaojuzi served the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea, enduring hardship with a steadfast heart and reverent devotion. Through scorching summers and bitter winters, he never faltered nor rested. After twenty years, the Azure Lad orally transmitted the mysterious methods and personally inscribed the sacred formulas.

He said: "If you seek to ride a crane and ascend the Nine Heavens, it is not easily attained. Yet if you roam leisurely within Heaven and Earth, preserving the untainted qi, your complexion will remain unchanged, your mind and eyes clear, and you may live for hundreds of years—never to perish.

However, the secret arts of immortals must not be passed to the unworthy. During the Chang’an era, Chaojuzi deemed Hanqizi a man of virtue and had him bathe, fast, and purify himself before transmitting the teachings. In the eighth year of Zhenyuan, Hanqizi, seeing that I was unassuming and free from worldly attachments, that my associations were not of the common sort, and that my nature seemed divinely ordained, deemed me worthy of the transmission and bade me pass it on.

I, in turn, found Yinqizi to be a man of literary refinement. Though he once ranked among the highest scholars, he suddenly abandoned worldly pursuits and turned his heart to the Daoist gate. For six or seven years, he mastered every mysterious method and secret art, yet the essence of the supreme principle still eluded him. Considering the legacy of trust left to me, and knowing him to be a man of true resolve—one who had forsaken rank and wealth, wandering in leisure, composing verses of elegance, possessing yet appearing as if he had nothing, substantial yet seeming empty—I knew he was destined for transcendence, not merely to share the longevity of tortoises and cranes.

Thus, in the year *Baoli* *yimao*, Xiaobingzi Lu Daoyuan presented the *Scroll of the Eight Directions’ Binding and Sealing of the Mysterious Treasure of the Most High* to the recluse Shi Jun. Hold it in reverence, guard it with caution, and diligently cultivate yourself to attain its numinous efficacy.

*Formula of the Seven Essences of Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother*

**Formula of the Three Heavens’ Bamboo Essence and Two Suns’ Qi**
Three *liang* of bamboo fruit—essence of the Three Heavens and Two Suns—steamed nine times and sun-dried nine times, governs water-qi.

**Formula of the Four Great Earth-Skin Seeds**
Two *liang* of earth-skin seeds—essence of the Great Yin—governs the liver and brightens the eyes.

**Formula of the Four Great Yellow Essences**
Two *liang* of yellow essence—essence of *wu* and *ji*—governs the spleen and viscera.

**Formula of the Three Great Creeping-Essence Seeds**

The above formula was transmitted of old to the Yellow Emperor, who consumed it and ascended on high. Should you wish to transmit it, erect an altar, burn incense, and invoke the Supreme Emperor; only then may it be conferred. Swear an oath not to leak it, and transmit it but once every forty years. Fail this, and the Most High will revoke your allotted years, and seven generations of your ancestors will be examined by the Water Bureau. Take heed.

**Grind each ingredient into powder, then combine and pound thirty thousand times; honeyed pills may also be made.**

**Gen Wangjun’s Placental Elixir**
One human placenta.
*Song of the Queen Mother* says:
One placenta, dragon’s latent transformation.
Reverses aging to youth, withered willow revives.

The commentary below states: The "purple placenta" refers to the firstborn daughter. Wash it one hundred times in east-flowing water to remove blood, then fifty times in wine; dry in the shade and sun alternately before combining.

Grind the twenty-two ingredients into powder, form honeyed pills. Take three doses, and the complexion will resemble a young girl’s.

Formerly transmitted by Su Linzi; to transmit, swear a blood oath—otherwise, the Most High will impose penalties.

**Xun Guitai Wangmu’s Four Youths Powder**
Seven *liang* of cinnabar.
Three *liang* of cinnabar (as above).
Four *liang* of sesame.
Four *liang* of asparagus root.
Five *liang* of poria.
Three *liang* of atractylodes.

**Li Pengjun’s Deer Antler Powder**
Three or two sets of deer antlers, quantity not strictly limited.
Split open, cut into pieces three *fen* thick and five *cun* long; remove the core and impurities, then soak in rice-water vinegar.
Change the solution every three days in summer, every ten days in winter; after a month, when the antlers soften, steam them in rice, cover with mulberry bark, and wait until they become as soft as taro. Dry in the sun, then grind into powder. For each *jin*, add one *liang* of sublimed sulfur.

Deer feed on sweetflag, and its essence enters the antlers.

Pengjun took this formula and lived 779 years before ascending to Mount Difu, disappearing without a trace. Today’s claim that Peng passed away is false—there is a separate account of this.

Someone obtained this formula from a stone cave on Mount Heming and swore never to divulge it.

**Dui Xiaji’s Apricot Gold Elixir**
Six *dou* of apricot kernels, ground in water to yield one *shi* and eight *dou* of liquid. Place in an iron cauldron, first coating it with three *jin* of sheep fat until fully absorbed. Then add the apricot liquid and simmer over a straw fire for forty-nine days. Remove and refine with *buzi*, forming pills the size of soybeans. Take one pill daily; three *liang* make one dose.

Xiaji took three doses, becoming a young maiden with hair as white as frost, ascending in broad daylight. The formula comes from the *Upper Canon of Xianmenzi*. Swear an oath before transmitting it—violation will bring calamity to seven generations. Be cautious, be cautious!

**Kan Nanyue Zhenren Chisongzi’s Lycium Decoction**
Thirty *jin* of lycium roots; remove the bark and set aside. Steam and sun-dry it nine times, then grind into powder. Boil the root cores, adding up to three *shi* of water. Later, combine and decoct until the consistency of thin congee, then mix with the earlier powder to form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take one dose to live as long as a hundred years.

This formula was transmitted by Li Babai; swear an oath before passing it on—heavenly calamity will punish violators.

One *shi* of white millet, soaked in *nan zhu* juice. Steam and sun-dry it nine times until reduced to over three *dou*. Cook one spoonful daily; after a month, reduce to half a spoonful; after two months, to one-third. The intestines will transform into sinews, and wind-cold cannot harm you. Beard and temples will turn black as silk, the complexion like ice and jade.

This formula was transmitted to a palace maiden who took it, commanding the Six Ding spirits and celestial soldiers as attendants. Keep it secret—attain transcendence. Be most cautious, be most cautious!
