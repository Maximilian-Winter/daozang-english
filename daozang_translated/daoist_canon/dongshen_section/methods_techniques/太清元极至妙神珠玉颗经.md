# 太清元极至妙神珠玉颗经

*The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Peerless and Most Wondrous Divine Pearl and Jade Kernel*

The Dao speaks: The Eight Radiant Flights soar, the Mysterious Void pierces with light, the Divine Pearl and Jade Kernel embody the Great Yin and Great Yang.

*The Record of Heaven’s Opening* states: The Divine Pearl is the essence of the Great Yang; the Jade Kernel is the flower of the moon’s splendor. The morning *hun* governs descent; the evening *po* governs ascent. The morning *hun* is the Yang soul of Heaven; the evening *po* is the Yin spirit of Earth. When the Yin *po* ascends, the Yang *hun* descends, responding to the flying light of the Eight Realms, giving rise to the Four Symbols. All things sprout in bud, aligning with the seasons and harmonizing with time. Their movements accord with transformation, all following the celestial patterns—from Nonbeing to Being, and within Being back to Nonbeing.

The Flowing Pearl of the Great Yang governs human Yang; the Mysterious Pearl of the Great Yin governs human Yin. When Yin and Yang symbols unite, Earth’s harmony responds, then white metal is bestowed, red snow paired, essence and blood stabilized, and the true embryo formed—only then are male and female conceived. The male corresponds to Heaven’s revered darkness; the female corresponds to Earth’s Supreme Clarity and Peerless Wondrous Darkness. When son and daughter unite in birth, Yin and Yang bow and rise in descent. First, they transform from a single darkness, then function through the Five Phases, only then do the Three Fields align, the Five Qi unfold their pattern, the Four Limbs grow in accord with the Four Seasons, and the Eight Directions settle in step with the Eight Trigrams. The Yin and Yang organs and viscera all mirror Heaven and Earth—how could they not arise from the qi’s seasons? How could they not stand through the workings of creation?

As for human cultivation, it likewise follows the same path as Heaven and Earth. To refine the Great Elixir and Golden Cinnabar, one must not depart from the creative transformations of Yin and Yang. One must rely on the cyclical applications of the celestial sphere, the revolutions of the *jiazi* cycle, the waxing and waning of the line symbols, the advance and retreat of the fire tally. Yang is born within *fu*, Yin emerges in the midst of *gou*. The *pi* and *tai* are determined at *yin* and *shen*; Qian and Kun advance at *si* and *hai*. Fire increases as water decreases, Yin coils while Yang unfurls. The Nine Returns complete the line symbols of Metal and Wood; the Seven Reversions turn within the images of Water and Fire. The true darkness of sixteen ounces is distributed among the three hundred eighty-four lines. The fire-timing of the Great Elixir, weighing one *jin*, is divided within the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*. One must secure the positions of ruler and minister, the harmony of husband and wife, the hierarchy of host and guest—all following the fire-timing. Inches and ounces, scales and measures, all correspond to the line statements without discrepancy. The fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth are arrayed within the furnace; the one hundred divisions of day and night are entirely contained within the crucible.

Within the water, the White Tiger takes form by responding to the lunar essence; within the fire, the Green Dragon embodies the solar radiance to manifest its image. Refining the elixir requires distinguishing the four seasons; advancing the fire depends entirely on the eight gates. When the qi of the Three Luminaries converges, it simmers into a hundred streams of crimson nectar; before the Twelve-Storied Tower, it forges a pool of white snow. Turning the eight jades along the path of the spinal palace, circulating the single qi upward to the Mud Pill Palace—where the Dark Pearl descends, a purple-golden lotus blooms within the pool; where the Sacred Stone flies forth, ten thousand strands of white jade laughter arise within the crucible. Beneath the Seven-Starred Tower, wind and clouds surge forth, swirling in five colors at the altar’s heart. As water and fire intermingle above and below, revolving with the waxing and waning of the moon, advancing and retreating through *Zhun* and *Meng*—whether at dawn or dusk, the Yang odd-numbered positions of the Qian hexagram advance their lines within the thirty-six; the Yin even-numbered positions of the Kun palace establish their images within the twenty-four. Only then does fire emerge within wood, metal arise within earth, the Black Tortoise exhale the raging winds of the earth, and the Red Phoenix spew the fierce flames of heaven. The Metal Lord embraces the Infant Brother to enter the chamber; the Yellow Dame guides the Maiden Sister to the gate. The celestial revolution is distributed within the four seasons; the fire-timing returns to its origin in the twelve months—place the altar at the rear.

For yearly practice, circulate the celestial revolution four times a year:
- On the Spring Equinox, use the *Zhen* hexagram, eighty-one repetitions. In mid-spring, at the hour of *mao*, advance the fire to arouse the Green Yang. The Yang number ends at nine nines; three returns make it efficacious.
- On the Summer Solstice, use the *Li* hexagram, seventy-two repetitions. At the Summer Solstice, facing south at noon, observe the four-six achievement. The number divides into seventy-two; the joints naturally open.
- On the Autumn Equinox, use the *Dui* hexagram, ninety-nine repetitions. At the Autumn Equinox, stationed in the *you* position, face west to emit divine radiance. Ninety plus nine makes the number; three returns make the qi flourish.
- On the Winter Solstice, use the *Kan* hexagram, one hundred eight repetitions. At the Winter Solstice, as Yang is born at *zi*, practice facing north. The number completes one hundred eight; four nines may be contemplated in detail.

The method for practice:
Choose a prosperous and flourishing place, and sit according to the time.
- On the Spring Equinox at the hour of *mao*, face east and sit gazing at the sun.
- On the Summer Solstice at the hour of *wu*, face south and sit gazing at the sun.
- On the Autumn Equinox at the hour of *you*, face west and sit gazing at the moon. If it is not visible, visualize it as if seeing its true form.
- On the Winter Solstice, use the *Kan* hexagram at the hour of *zi*, face north, and sit gazing at the moon.

Following the above method, clench the fists and concentrate the spirit. Still the thoughts, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and beat the Heavenly Drum twenty-four times. By day, gaze at the sun; by night, gaze at the moon and recite the incantation.
- **Incantation for the Sun:**
  *"The sun’s flowing essence comes to protect my body. My embryo is already numinous, uniting with its true nature. Hasten, as the law commands!"*
- **Incantation for the Moon:**
  *"The moon’s aiding essence makes my embryo numinous. It settles my *po* and *hun*, forever gathering the supreme spirit. Hasten, as the law commands!"*

With each recitation, draw in one breath, then inhale and hold it, counting the breath’s duration. When the breath is full, swallow three times. Recite the incantation three times, taking three breaths, each following the above method. Then, rub the hands together and warm the cinnabar field before stopping. This completes one session.

For monthly practice, circulate the celestial revolution once a month.

The moon is the earth’s *po*, the essence of the Supreme Yin’s water. Below, it occupies a humble position, belonging to *Kun* and *Xun*. It reigns in winter and wanes in summer, its days short and nights long. Within it lies concealed the yang essence, and inside resides the Jade Hare. The hare corresponds to *mao* (卯), aligning with the east, where grasses and trees sprout—its fire holds hidden yang within yin.

The inner realm is called the lower *jiao*, the earthly domain. The five viscera include the kidneys, and between them lies the cinnabar field. Before it lies *Xun* Sea, the water府 of man. Though its position is yin, it contains yang within. The *Eight Trigrams* call this *Kan*, meaning "pit" or "receptacle of water," where rivers and lakes converge. Common folk, unaware of the true positions of yin and yang, mistakenly take the north as *Kan* and the south as *Li*—this is incorrect. *Kan* is the position of *Kun* and *Xun* in the south, and the odd yang within *Kan* is the fire of *wu* (午) in the south. *Li* is the position of *Qian* and *Gen* in the north, and the even yin within *Li* is the water of *hai* (亥) and *zi* (子).

The moon is outwardly yin yet inwardly yang, outwardly a petty person yet inwardly a noble one—like lead or tin yielding silver within, or cinnabar stone concealing red gold. Both gold and silver arise from yang within yin, called the "infant." Above, it unites with the Supreme Yin’s *Lao Nü* within cinnabar, forming a couple bound by mutual affinity, congealing into cinnabar. *Kan* is the watery sea, the hidden palace of the dragon, also likened to the emperor’s supreme dignity, enthroned in the northern palace yet facing south in sovereignty.

The moon is earth, and earth, devoid of yang’s light, cannot nurture the myriad things. Yet when heaven and earth bestow life, all things grow toward the sun—this is the eternal Dao of heaven and earth. Thus, in navigating the world as a person, one must first adhere to the supreme Dao, then align with the celestial Dao. To follow the celestial Dao is to perpetually preserve within oneself the primordial yang, the True One, the harmonious and pure natural qi, thereby attaining longevity and enduring vision.

Therefore, the practice of the celestial revolution is arranged within thirty days, corresponding to the twelve monthly hexagrams. Counting the yin and yang lines yields seventy-two, and with the five phases applied, this completes the number three hundred and sixty. Yang advances while yin retreats, cycling endlessly in perpetual return.

  *Jade bones emerge from the mortal sphere.*

**Method for Practicing the Hexagrams:**
- **For Metal:** Cross the kidneys by first pressing the left foot over the right, then the right over the left. Clasp the hands tightly, gripping the palms to prevent movement. Rotate counterclockwise twelve times, then clockwise thirteen times, with a net gain of three rotations to circulate qi into the brain.
- **For Water:** Press the tongue firmly against the outer sides of the teeth, first turning left twelve times, then right thirteen times. Swish until the saliva turns sweet, then swallow.
- **For Wood:** Seal the mouth, inflate the cheeks, and swish twelve times. When the mouth is full of water, swallow.
- **For Fire:** Hold the breath and count the inhalations. When the breath grows urgent, perform three consecutive swallows. With prolonged practice, gradually increase the count, aiming for a hundred breaths before stopping.
- **For Earth:** First practice Fire, then Water, then Wood, then Metal. Circulate and guide the qi to the middle *jiao*, then stabilize it. Press with the left hand and rotate nine times.

At the end of each month, during the third watch of the night, first complete the hexagram for that month, then proceed with the water and fire counts for each preceding month. Strike the teeth and the Heavenly Drum, clasp the hands firmly, and concentrate the spirit—just as in the yearly practice.

For daily *Zhoutian* practice, perform one hexagram before noon. The hexagrams correspond to Heaven and Earth: *Qian* and *Kun* establish the lines, the line images align, and water and fire advance and retreat. Water increases while fire decreases; yang coils and yin unfolds—all within the sixty-four hexagrams. Regard *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible, *Kan* and *Li* as the furnace. *Zhun* and *Meng* mark the beginning, *Jiji* and *Weiji* the end. The dark and new moons serve as the guiding principle; fetal breathing forms the fire tally. The count of *Zhoutian* completes in one month, like an ant circling endlessly, returning to the start.

As the *Cantong Qi* states:
*"The Fire Record spans six hundred chapters, yet its aim remains unchanged.
The text emerges with solemn care—common folk fail to ponder deeply."*

Those cultivating inner alchemy must first rectify their furnace, for the furnace is the outer wall of the crucible—namely, the human body. Within it lies the elixir of immortality: the spirit, essence, and fluids. The furnace has eight gates—eyes, ears, mouth, and nose—serving as the portals for seeing, hearing, exhaling, and inhaling, the locks and doors of the body. Each movement must be appropriate, and these gates must be firmly guarded, preventing the eight evils and six thieves—form, color, and flavor—from harming the inner truth. Only then can one begin the practice.

The transformations occur within the earthen furnace, hence the alchemical furnace is listed below:

*Qian* is the Metal Elder; *Kun* is the Yellow Dame. The upper crucible and lower furnace employ the central numbers; *Kan* and *Li* are the elixir. *Li* is the maiden, *Kan* the infant.

**Method for Practice:**
Follow the five phases within the hexagrams, circulating *Zhoutian* according to the month. If the month has only twenty-nine days, complete the twenty-ninth hexagram and include the thirtieth; likewise, for the nighttime practice, include the thirtieth hexagram if the month has twenty-nine days.

**Timed *Zhoutian* Practice:**
The four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* serve as the key. The twenty-four lines govern the twenty-four qi, corresponding to the seasonal nodes.

The preceding sixty hexagrams govern three hundred sixty lines, thus yielding one hundred eighty yang lines and one hundred eighty yin lines, which accord with the number of the *Zhoutian*. Together, they form three hundred eighty-four lines. Each line represents one *zhu*; twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang*. Three hundred eighty-four *zhu* complete the *Zhoutian* measure of one *jin* of fire timing.

Thus, in internal practice, one day corresponds to the celestial movement of one year—its ascent and descent, the circulation of yin and yang, within the four seasons and twelve hours. Day follows spring and summer; night follows autumn and winter. From beginning to end, day and night mirror the harmonious exchange of Heaven and Earth.

Moreover, the hours of *Hai*, *Zi*, and *Chou* correspond to winter in Heaven: yin ascends to the heart of Heaven, yang descends to the Water Palace, warming and nurturing the Kidney, transforming and refining the bones. This is akin to how mountains and stones silently receive the ascending and descending qi of Heaven and Earth, transmuting into gold, silver, precious gems, cinnabar, and copper-iron. Thus, the true person’s body becomes golden sinews and jade marrow.

The hours of *Yin*, *Mao*, and *Chen* correspond to spring in Heaven: yin ascends to Heaven, yang descends to the Flowery Canopy. Grasses and trees each receive the harmonious qi of yang, blossoming into flowers, vegetables, sprouts, and vines.

The hours of *Si*, *Wu*, and *Wei* correspond to summer in Heaven: yin descends to the Water Palace, yang reaches its peak and fire is born. It warms and nurtures the Heart, refining the blood, which is transformed by true yang into white milk.

The hours of *Shen*, *You*, and *Xu* correspond to autumn in Heaven: yang reaches its peak and descends to Heaven, yin returns and ascends from Earth. It warms and nurtures the Lung, transforming the skin. Day and night correspond to the four seasons, refining yin and yang into one body. From this, one transcends the mundane and enters sagehood, transforming the common into the immortal—all through the great medicine of the Golden Elixir, the one *jin* of water and fire, the dual function of yin and yang.

Within the thirty-day great practice, employ the sixteen measures of water and fire. With firmness and softness, civil and martial, advance and retreat, regulate yin and yang. When applied without error, success is complete.

**Establishing the Altar (to follow):**
- On the first day, advance fire by one, use water fifteen.
- On the second day, advance fire by two, use water fourteen.
- On the third day, advance fire by three, use water thirteen.
- On the fourth day, advance fire by four, use water twelve.
- On the fifth day, advance fire by five, use water eleven.
- On the sixth day, advance fire by six, use water ten.
- On the seventh day, advance fire by seven, use water nine.

- On the twenty-eighth day, advance water by thirteen, use fire three.
- On the twenty-ninth day, advance water by fourteen, use fire two.
- On the thirtieth day, advance water by fifteen, use fire one.

The above constitutes the three years of water and fire practice. In the fourth year, the middle three years of fire timing are exchanged. Thus, the *Hunyuan Jing* states: "If one cultivates the practice, one must perform the thirty-day great practice." The *Riyue Xuanzhu Lun* also says: "Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger; the Dao of the sun and moon is the ancestral origin." Furthermore, Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* states: "The lunar nodes have five and six; the warp and weft serve the sun’s envoy." The *Jinlong Baihu Jing* says: "One yin and one yang form the guiding principle; advance and retreat are all within the celestial tally." The *Guwen Longhu Shangjing* states: "*Kan* is the essence of the moon, *Li* is the radiance of the sun." The ancient sages all aligned with the celestial tally in advancing and retreating, increasing and decreasing fire timing.

The method of practice states: "For the preceding water and fire method, proceed exactly as described."

**Middle Three Years of Water and Fire Timing:**
The first altar configuration is employed in the fourth year, called the *Four Orthodox and Eight Applications of the Zhoutian*.

Now, *Gen* as Metal is like mountains and stones, thus water is born within mountains and stones—this is yin within yang. The *Inner Landscape* says: "The upper burner is Heaven; the Heart is the numinous palace. The head is the *Gen* mountain; the mouth is the valley cave, the source of water." Water is *Kan*, the accumulation of dark yin. Externally, it rises to Heaven, hovering beneath the Flowery Canopy, descending as rain and dew to moisten the Heart Palace—thus it is yin within yang.

The eight trigrams: *Li* is yang externally and yin internally, like an outer gentleman and an inner petty person. This is akin to cinnabar, which belongs to fire yet conceals mercury, the soul of the Grand Yin Crone, its body clad in five-colored garments. *Li* means "attached"; its essence is the sun and moon, possessing the five-colored brilliance of radiant splendor, the luminous hues of rosy clouds. Within it lies the Crimson Palace, which connects upward to the eyes—the eyes are the gates of the Mud Pill Palace. Within the palace resides the spirit, formless and master of Heaven and Earth, the numen of the ten thousand things, called the Primordial Beginning, its virtue harmonizing with non-action.

If one wishes to cultivate destiny, first clarify the spirit. When the spirit is pure and upright, the myriad evils cannot invade, and all malevolence submits. This is because the Heart is the root of the ten thousand methods, the great medicine of longevity. If the Heart cannot subdue itself, internal treacherous fire arises—just as cinnabar, if not dead, will fly away when exposed to fire.

Thus, governing the Heart is the master of life. Therefore, Heaven has eight poles, Earth has eight directions, the *Yi* has eight trigrams, man possesses eight vessels, fire moves through eight gates, and water refines eight essences. These may correspond to the four seasons and align with the eight trigrams in a single diagram, uniting at the center with the work of Earth to enable advance and retreat.

The oral formula for practice states: The work of Earth at the Central Palace circulates throughout the body, employing fifteen as its measure. The functions of water and fire follow prior methods. Only when primordial darkness exists do the ten thousand images arise; the eight trigrams and the sixty cyclical signs conceal divine mechanisms and spectral mysteries. The art of yin and yang overcoming one another is manifestly revealed in the images!

This is the true principle.

The second stage of Central Work, practiced in the fifth year, is called the "Circulation of Sun and Moon" or the "Return to the Origin Circulation."

When chaos first parted, the pure rose above and the turbid sank below. Yang darkness descended and revolved leftward, while yin darkness ascended and turned rightward. Thus, yang essence congealed to form the sun, and yin essence congealed to form the moon. The sun governs waxing and waning, the moon governs crescent and full phases—all within the bounds of waxing, waning, increase, and decrease.

The fire-timing of the Celestial Circulation inherits both great and small cycles. The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang, arising in accord with the seasons, perishing in accord with the seasons, and achieving completion through darkness.

Moreover, man is the chief of the ten thousand things, born to employ the functions of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth first generate the Two Modes, taking water as the True One; man likewise first generates the Two Modes, with the left and right kidneys as the pivot, also called the True One. The mysterious is the source of water. The sage says: one water, two fires—this is the yang within yin, hence named the Origin.

Fire is born of wood and governs the liver—this is the Green Dragon, the yang soul. Water is born of metal and governs the lungs—this is the White Tiger, the yin spirit. With the Four Images complete, Earth has no fixed form and rules the four seasons in turn.

The classic states: one water, two fires, three wood, four metal, five earth.

In cultivation, one must ignite fire within water. The left kidney pertains to yang and is the sun; the right kidney pertains to yin and is the moon. Thus, sun and moon revolve day and night without cease, giving rise to the ten thousand things. If one cultivates, day and night within the twelve hours, practicing the Dao of sun and moon, beginning with the movement of the hours, completing three thousand works, and circulating darkness through the eight vessels—this is where the immortal begins.

External movement corresponds to internal turning; external qi converges as internal qi intermingles. The left kidney is the Green Dragon, the true internal fire; the right kidney is the White Tiger, the true internal water. After a hundred days of practice, accumulating essence and perfecting spirit, one must perform the work of water and fire. Both left and right complete a Celestial Circulation. The two darknesses of Dragon and Tiger ascend to the Golden Gate and Jade Portal, which then close—this is the third ring of the Tower of Numinous Loft, called the "Man’s Welcome Point." Using both hands to seal it, the darkness descends, joining the two darknesses of Dragon and Tiger. The Central Palace naturally unites, emotions harmonize, and one does not awaken.

Heaven and Earth: this is the intermingling of qi, not the union of spirit. If spirit is complete and darkness robust, yet union is not enacted, this is the union of form, not the intermingling of qi.

After a hundred days of practice, testing will reveal no leakage or dissipation, no nightmares, and no invasion by yin ghosts. Further practicing the great fire work of the Celestial Circulation, applying the numbers of nine nines and their increases and decreases, steaming the sinews and exposing the bones, refining darkness to generate spirit—one who can practice this will be unassailed by the ten thousand illnesses, untouched by the thousand evils, and may prolong life, extend years, and ascend as a feathered immortal.

**Verse:**
Within water, primordial fire is born;
Within yang, a single yin grows long.
The two passes connect inner and outer,
The two substances revolve, floating and sinking.
Nine returns: Dragon unites with Tiger;
Seven reversals: wood joins with metal.
The pivot is the Dao of sun and moon—
This principle is most profound.

**Another Verse:**
Sun and moon wax and wane, turning two wheels;
When the two passes’ darkness is sufficient, spirit may be born.
Together they are a pair of mysterious frost children—
Yet they have misled thousands upon thousands of people.

The classic states: The sun and moon have their numbers, the great and small have their measures. From this, sagely work arises! From this, spirit and illumination emerge!

Heaven is the crucible, its canopy covering the four directions. Heaven is Qian, it is metal. The *Inner Landscape* says: Above the Lung Palace is the canopy, covering the various organs below and connecting upward to the nose. The nose is the Gate of Heaven, externally governing inhalation and exhalation, moving the constructive and defensive qi, circulating through the five viscera, flowing throughout the body, dynamically changing in ascent and descent. Great and small have their measures, just as Heaven moves the stars and constellations, Earth turns the rivers and streams. Inner and outer are the same; man and Heaven are in accord. Thus, the Gate of Heaven connects to the lungs, issuing and entering pure darkness—this is the lid of the crucible.

Earth is the belly of the crucible, transforming the ten thousand things. Earth is Kun. The *Inner Landscape* says: The spleen and stomach encompass water and grain, connecting upward to the mouth. The mouth is the Gate of Earth, also called the Throat Gate. It receives water and grain, which descend to the stomach chamber. There, it receives the darkness descending from the Gate of Heaven, moving and digesting, transforming water and grain, separating the clear and turbid. The clear part of grain ascends to the upper burner, the Palace of Heart and Lungs, the boundary of clarity and purity, where it transforms into spirit-darkness, essence, and fluids, nourishing life. The turbid part of grain descends to the large and small intestines.

Thus, the stomach is the crucible of transformation. The mouth is the Gate of Earth, the nose is the Gate of Heaven. At the center is the Mysterious Female, called the "Human Center"—this is the Three Powers: Heaven, Earth, and Man.

The qi of the Gate of Heaven’s breathing accords with the movements of stars and constellations; the water flowing through the Gate of Earth corresponds internally to the blood vessels, governing the constructive and defensive qi. The practice of fetal breathing, the Dao of ascent and descent, is the root and source of the stem.

Thus, the inner kidneys are the ultimate void; the outer kidneys are like the sun and moon. Inner and outer correspond, and yin and yang naturally unite. The work of Heaven’s ninefold use, the principle of advance and retreat in circulation—this is the gateway to cultivation and nourishment.

The classic states: "Deep roots and firm stems are the Dao of long life and enduring vision."

On the first day, advance the one-by-nine work; on the second day, advance the two-by-nine work; on the third day, advance the three-by-nine work; on the fourth day, advance the four-by-nine work; on the fifth day, advance the five-by-nine work; on the sixth day, advance the six-by-nine work; on the seventh day, advance the seven-by-nine work; on the eighth day, advance the eight-by-nine work; on the ninth day, advance the nine-by-nine work. For each of the above, employ the number forty.

On the tenth day, visualize the upper work forty times, the middle work forty times, and the lower work forty times. On the eleventh day, advance the nine-by-nine work; on the twelfth day, advance the eight-by-nine work; on the thirteenth day, advance the seven-by-nine work; on the fourteenth day, advance the six-by-nine work; on the fifteenth day, advance the five-by-nine work; on the sixteenth day, advance the four-by-nine work; on the seventeenth day, advance the three-by-nine work; on the eighteenth day, advance the two-by-nine work; on the nineteenth day, advance the one-by-nine work. For each of the above, employ the number forty.

On the twentieth day, visualize the upper palace eighty times, the middle palace eighty times, and the lower palace eighty times. On the twenty-first day, advance the one-by-nine work; on the twenty-second day, advance the two-by-nine work; on the twenty-third day, advance the three-by-nine work; on the twenty-fourth day, advance the four-by-nine work; on the twenty-fifth day, advance the five-by-nine work; on the twenty-sixth day, advance the six-by-nine work; on the twenty-seventh day, advance the seven-by-nine work; on the twenty-eighth day, advance the eight-by-nine work; on the twenty-ninth day, advance the nine-by-nine work. For each of the above, employ the number forty.

On the thirtieth day, visualize the upper field one hundred twenty times, the middle field one hundred twenty times, and the lower field one hundred twenty times. The method of practice states: ...follow the monthly metal method in conducting the work, with the initial work numbers as previously described. For the upper work, visualize the upper brain; for the upper palace, visualize the central courtyard; for the upper field, visualize the lower cinnabar field.

The third application of the middle palace and the sixth year of practice are called the "Primordial Circulation of the Zhou Heaven." In refining the great elixir, one must engage in the movement of the Zhou Heaven, aligning the celestial stems and earthly branches, interweaving the five and six, with the qi phases responding to the seasons. A year’s count cycles through the four seasons, shifting through the twenty-four qi, and alternating through the seventy-two hou. The work of jia and geng resides in wu and gui; metal and wood are fixed in yin and shen positions. Only then can the furnace refine the white snow, the tripod nurture the yellow sprout. When the elixir gold undergoes its first transformation, black and white correspond; the upper and lower gates open, Kan and Li unite. The dragon ascends to extinguish the fire, timely passing through the Gate of the Spinal Victory; the tiger draws forth a thousand waves, each time traversing the Dao of the Mud Pill. Once the three fields are filled with medicine, the six palaces indeed give birth to spirit.

To enable the union of spirit and qi, one must employ the Hunyuan method, circulating through the twenty-four qi and seventy-two hou. Before spring, one segment comprises three qi and nine hou: at the Beginning of Spring (first month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Rain Water (mid-first month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at the Waking of Insects (second month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements. After spring, one segment comprises three qi and nine hou: at the Spring Equinox (mid-second month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Pure Brightness (third month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Grain Rain (mid-third month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements.

Before summer, one segment comprises three qi and nine hou: at the Beginning of Summer (fourth month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Grain Full (mid-fourth month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Grain in Ear (fifth month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements. After summer, one segment comprises three qi and nine hou: at the Summer Solstice (mid-fifth month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Slight Heat (sixth month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Great Heat (mid-sixth month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements.

Before autumn, one segment comprises three qi and nine hou: at the Beginning of Autumn (seventh month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at the Limit of Heat (mid-seventh month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at White Dew (eighth month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements. After autumn, one segment comprises three qi and nine hou: at the Autumn Equinox (mid-eighth month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Cold Dew (ninth month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Frost Descent (mid-ninth month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements.

Before winter, one segment comprises three qi and nine hou: at the Beginning of Winter (tenth month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Slight Snow (mid-tenth month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Great Snow (eleventh month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements. After winter, one segment comprises three qi and nine hou: at the Winter Solstice (mid-eleventh month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Slight Cold (twelfth month’s node), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements; at Great Cold (mid-twelfth month), one qi with three applications, each application with three achievements.

The method of practice states: "One qi with three applications" means that within each qi of fifteen days, for every five days among the sixty hours, select the jiazi, gengshen, and one’s own life hour to perform one achievement each. The method of execution follows the monthly practice: when refining the metal method, nine revolutions constitute one achievement.

The first application of practice, in the seventh year, is called the Wondrous Water Circulation of the Zhou Heaven. That heaven endures long and perpetually is because it attains the Dao of the Orthodox Unity and True Origin. Within the furnace and tripod of heaven and earth, yin and yang unite internally, not losing the original qi, thereby attaining the Dao of natural longevity. Endowed by heaven and earth, it generates the essence of heaven and earth, becoming the child of heaven and earth. Nurtured by the covering and nourishing of heaven and earth, it transforms into a human, whose inner realm also possesses the Dao of heaven and earth’s longevity.

Now, the Orthodox Unity is the venerable title of water. The origin of heaven and earth is the True Unity; the mechanism of the Five Phases is the True Water; the mother of the myriad things is the Great Mystery. If one cultivates and refines, simply employing the wondrous use of True Water to circulate through the Zhou Heaven, when practice reaches this stage, externally it can generate the myriad things, and internally it can generate the myriad spirits. Thus, it is said that the wondrous use of small achievements is grandly named Wondrous Water.

Heaven One (jia) begins on the first day of the tenth month and lasts until the sixth day of the eleventh month, with water flowing for six days. Earth Two (yi) begins on the seventh day of the eleventh month and lasts until the twelfth day of the twelfth month, with water flowing for five days. Heaven Three (bing) begins on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month and lasts until the eighteenth day of the first month, with water flowing for four days. Earth Four (ding) begins on the nineteenth day of the first month and lasts until the twenty-fourth day of the second month, with water flowing for three days. Heaven Five (wu) begins on the twenty-fifth day of the second month and lasts until the thirtieth day of the third month, with water flowing for two days. Earth Six (ji) begins on the first day of the fourth month and lasts until the sixth day of the fifth month, with water flowing for one day. Heaven Seven (geng) begins on the seventh day of the fifth month and lasts until the twelfth day of the sixth month, with water flowing for two days. Earth Eight (xin) begins on the thirteenth day of the sixth month and lasts until the eighteenth day of the seventh month, with water flowing for three days. Heaven Nine (ren) begins on the nineteenth day of the seventh month and lasts until the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, with water flowing for four days. Earth Ten (gui) begins on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month and lasts until the thirtieth day of the ninth month, with water flowing for five days.

The second application of practice, in the eighth year, is called the Wondrous Fire Circulation of the Zhou Heaven. The sun is the celestial soul, the essence of the Great Yang fire, occupying the honored position above, residing in Qian and Gen. It flourishes in summer and declines in winter, with short nights and long days, internally concealing yin qi and harboring the golden phoenix within. The phoenix corresponds to you (the tenth Earthly Branch), externally aligning with the west. Metal and stone can generate its water. The small achievement of the Qian number is grandly named Wondrous Fire.

On the first day, fire flows eight times; on the second day, fire flows nine times...

On the third day, fire flows ten times; on the fourth day, fire flows eleven times; on the fifth day, fire flows twelve times; on the sixth day, fire flows thirteen times; on the seventh day, fire flows fourteen times; on the eighth day, fire flows fifteen times; on the ninth day, fire flows sixteen times; on the tenth day, fire flows seventeen times; on the eleventh day, fire flows eighteen times; on the twelfth day, fire flows nineteen times; on the thirteenth day, fire flows twenty times; on the fourteenth day, fire flows twenty-one times; on the fifteenth day, fire flows twenty-one times; on the sixteenth day, fire flows twenty times; on the seventeenth day, fire flows nineteen times; on the eighteenth day, fire flows eighteen times; on the nineteenth day, fire flows seventeen times; on the twentieth day, fire flows sixteen times; on the twenty-first day, fire flows fifteen times; on the twenty-second day, fire flows fourteen times; on the twenty-third day, fire flows thirteen times; on the twenty-fourth day, fire flows twelve times; on the twenty-fifth day, fire flows eleven times; on the twenty-sixth day, fire flows ten times; on the twenty-seventh day, fire flows nine times; on the twenty-eighth day, fire flows eight times; on the twenty-ninth day, fire flows seven times; on the thirtieth day, fire flows six times.

The *Method of Practice* states: ...Follow the internal practice according to the lunar cycle. In the third phase of cultivation, the ninth year is called "Returning to the Cycle of Harvest." Heaven and earth ascend and descend, yin and yang converge, the eight trigrams move, and the fire timing advances and retreats. The single qi encompasses the Three Powers, employing the nine returns and seven reversals, with success rooted in the primordial method of the undifferentiated.

Refining qi to generate spirit relies on the numbers of the celestial cycle, combining grains and ounces into sixty-four parts to correspond with the sixty-four hexagrams. Six grains represent the six lines. On the first day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the second day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the third day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the fourth day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the fifth day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the sixth day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the seventh day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the eighth day, nine yang grains and nine yin grains. On the ninth day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the tenth day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the eleventh day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the twelfth day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the thirteenth day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the fourteenth day, six yang grains and six yin grains. On the fifteenth day, nine yang grains and nine yin grains. On the sixteenth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the seventeenth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the eighteenth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the nineteenth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twentieth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twenty-first day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twenty-second day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twenty-third day, nine yin grains and nine yang grains. On the twenty-fourth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twenty-fifth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twenty-sixth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twenty-seventh day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twenty-eighth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the twenty-ninth day, six yin grains and six yang grains. On the thirtieth day, nine yin grains and nine yang grains.

The *Method of Practice* states: For yang grains, hold the breath for nine cycles and swallow three times; for yin grains, hold the breath for six cycles and swallow three times.

**Entering the Chamber for the Celestial Cycle**
The *Book of Changes* says: "As the sun departs, the moon arrives; as the moon departs, the sun arrives—sun and moon alternate to generate light. As cold departs, heat arrives; as heat departs, cold arrives—cold and heat alternate to complete the year." Thus, yang lines are assigned to *Qian*, and yin lines to *Kun*. The number of old yang is thirty-six, corresponding to the four nines; the number of old yin is twenty-four, corresponding to the four sixes. Each hour, one line is practiced, and two hexagrams are employed.

The *Method of Practice* states: For a yang line, hold the breath for thirty-six cycles and swallow three times; for a yin line, hold the breath for twenty-four cycles and swallow three times. Upon completion, exert force to guide the qi into the cinnabar field, reciting: "Splitting above and below, opening the Two Modes, circulating the Five Movements, harmonizing the Six Qi—heaven’s wheel turns west, earth’s water flows east. The ascent and descent of heaven and earth can only be matched by humans. Reverently emulate the union of yin and yang hexagrams: the *Li* and *Kan* lines, the left dragon and right tiger, aligned with the pivot of sun and moon; *Kan* in the north and *Li* in the south, following the creation of *Qian* and *Kun*."

The *Book of Changes* establishes firmness and softness, with lines corresponding to the six spirits and time divided into the four images. Each day, two hexagrams are used, applied at dawn and dusk. Each hour, one line is established, intersecting at *zi* and *wu*. One month comprises sixty hexagrams, aligning with the seasonal markers; ten months comprise six hundred hexagrams, distributed in the fire timing. Thus, Wei Boyang said: "The *Fire Record* has six hundred chapters, yet their purpose is not different." This is the meaning. *On the Seven Reversals and Return to the Origin*

Water of *zi* reaching Metal of *shen* constitutes the Nine Returns—this is the child returning to the mother. The first sequence in order is called "return," while the reverse is called "reversal." The Seven Reversals begin at *shen* and count to *yin*, where Fire resides within Wood. The second reversal then proceeds backward from *yin* through the Nine Returns, reaching *wu* to reveal Fire, which is the position of *Li*. Another Seven Reversals follow, retracing from *wu* back to *zi*, the position of *Kan*. The third sequence counts the Nine Returns from *zi* to *chen*, revealing Earth, then reverses the Seven Returns from *chen* to *xu*. Here, the Three Agents interact in reversal, and the Five Phases manifest Earth, completing the transformation into the *daogui*.

The *dao* is Metal, and *dao* means "to arrive"—to sever and reach its destination. The *gui* is the two Earths; thus, Earth is born of Metal, becoming the Yellow Sprout.

**Eulogy:**
The Three Powers connect,
Earth’s depth and Heaven’s height,
With harmony at the center,
Preceding all things.
Some are mortal, some sage,
Some foolish, some wise—
Cultivating yin makes ghosts,
Cultivating yang makes immortals.
Clarity brings stillness,
Turbidity brings struggle.
To achieve the Great Dao,
One must encounter the true key.
To know refinement:
Essence, mercury, spirit complete,
True Water, True Fire,
True Mercury, True Lead.
Whether in sequence or reversal,
Seven Reversals and Nine Returns—
Those who attain it now
Do so by prior cause.
From ancient sages,
Mouth-to-mouth transmission:
If one practices this method,
They ascend to sagehood and Heaven.

**Elixir Refinement Incantation:**
Steadfast the spirit abides,
Endless the cavernous void.
After winter’s first node,
Temper and nurture my pearl.
Nine worms expelled,
Three corpses swiftly removed.
The primordial spirit petitions me—
Grant the celestial talisman.
The embryo’s spirit transforms,
Subtly attaining the void’s origin.
By the Supreme’s mighty command,
Hasten as the law decrees!

*The Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Primordial Ultimate and Most Wondrous Divine Pearl and Jade Grain concludes.*
