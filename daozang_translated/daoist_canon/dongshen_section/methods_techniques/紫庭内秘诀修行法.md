**The Purple Court Esoteric Methods of Cultivation**

For those who cultivate the Dao and seek longevity and immortality, visualize the Three Primordial Spirits and the locations of the Three Primordial Palaces.

The Upper Primordial resides in the Mud-Pill Palace, situated three *cun* inward from the space between the eyebrows. Within the second *cun*, open a square space of one *cun*—this is the Cinnabar Field Palace. Visualize its spirit, named the Crimson Child, styled Radiant Primordial First, also called Imperial Minister, clad in vermilion robes. Envision it within the palace and call its name thrice.

The Middle Primordial dwells in the Crimson Chamber, which is the heart. Within the heart, a square space of one *cun* is the Crimson Palace. Visualize its spirit within the palace, also clad in crimson robes, named Perfected One, styled Child Cinnabar Radiance Firm, and call its name thrice.

The Lower Primordial resides in the Cinnabar Field Palace, three *cun* below the navel, precisely three *cun* inward from the navel. Visualize its spirit within the palace, clad in yellow robes, its face white like a newborn infant, named Primordial Yang, styled Valley Mystery, and call its name thrice.

Afterward, swallow qi twenty-four times and invoke the Great Lord of the Palace of Life.

The Gate of Destiny is the navel, and the Mysterious Portal is the passage through which the umbilical cord and placenta were first connected. Within it lies the Palace of Life, one *cun* inward from the navel. Inside the palace resides the Great Lord, named Peach Prosperity, styled Uniting Essence and Prolonging, clad in vermilion robes, wearing a purple hibiscus crown, seated at the Gate of Destiny, with the Three Hun Spirits attending at his side, standing to the left. The Great Lord holds the Heavenly Emperor’s Symbolic Talisman. Grasp it with both hands according to its characters to harmonize and infuse primordial qi, replenishing the embryo and reversing the placenta.

At night before sleep, first visualize the Three Palaces, then sit, clench the fists, close the eyes, and inwardly gaze. First, hold the breath for twenty-four cycles, then visualize the Great Lord seated facing outward, his appearance like that of an infant, wearing his crown and robes, holding the talisman—ensure the vision is clear. Then, silently call the Great Lord’s name thrice: *Mysterious Portal, Great Lord of the Palace of Life, named Peach Prosperity, styled Uniting Essence and Prolonging.* Swallow saliva fifty times, click the teeth thrice, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Embryonic Spirit, Great Divinity,
Celestial Lord of the Imperial Net,
Holding the Placental Talisman,
Head crowned with purple,
Yellow revolves, red transforms,
Ascending to refine the Gate of Destiny,
Transforming spirit and reversing life,
Six Harmonies interdependent,
Form and body radiant,
Jade Maidens dwell within."*

After reciting this incantation to completion, proceed with the binding and restraining method. If one can persist in this practice for eighteen years, they shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight, accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders.

The Heavenly Emperor’s Symbolic Talisman of the Great Tenuous Celestial Court is as follows:

*[Here follows the Heavenly Emperor’s Symbolic Talisman, to be bestowed upon the Great Spirit of the Palace of Life, Peach Prosperity, styled Uniting Essence and Prolonging, to harmonize the primordial upper qi and govern the placenta, directing essence.]*

Write in vermilion on blue paper, finely inscribed. On the first day of the lunar month and the night of the full moon, at midnight, face north and ingest it. Hold the talisman in the right hand, hold the breath, face north, burn incense, and complete the inscription. Cut the talisman in sequence, layering and holding it, then close the eyes, hold the breath, and visualize the Great Lord as before. Silently recite the incantation:

*"Celestial Emperor’s Mysterious Scripture,
Imperial Symbolic Numinous Talisman,
Harmonizing primordial qi,
Directing essence and reversing the placenta,
Eternal Infant of Ten Thousand Years,
Flying Immortal of the Celestial Pivot,
Great Spirit of the Palace of Life,
Unfurling the vermilion script,
Head crowned with purple,
Conspiring with me in unity."*

Upon completion, rise and bow twice. Roll the talisman in sequence, form it into a pellet, and ingest it. Visualize the Great Lord holding the talisman in his left hand as you ingest it, then face north and bow to the Celestial Lord of the Great Tenuous Court.

The scripture states: Visualizing the Great Lord’s talisman and ingesting it for eighteen years, the Great Lord shall be able to stir the Three Fields on the left and govern the Three Qi on the right. The Fields shall transform into flying chariots, and the Qi shall transform into mysterious dragons. Above, he commands the Twenty-Four Spirits; below, he employs the Hun and Ling. He summons the Six Jia of the Yang Bureau and the Six Ding of the Yin Bureau. With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, he ascends to heaven in broad daylight—all through the resonance of Lord Peach. Though the method is minor, it is worthy of observation.

The Great Spirit of the Palace of Life must be cautious of menstrual impurity and the burning of animal fur, *hu-ying*, and similar substances.

These practices all disrupt the harmonious qi of the womb and, in turn, harm the spirit of the infant. The Three Hun depart the human body three times each month—on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days—when the spirit-souls wander and dreams become unreal, leaving one vulnerable to invading pernicious qi. At such times, one must restrain them. The method is as follows: at the moment of retiring, lie supine with legs fully extended, place both hands one over the other upon the heart (left hand above), click the teeth three times, swallow qi three times, and close the eyes in visualization. Envision a single thread of crimson qi, radiant and the size of a chicken’s egg, rising from the heart. It divides and emerges through both eyes, gradually expanding to envelop the entire body, descending to the feet and ascending to the crown, transforming into a great fire that refines the body like burning charcoal. Upon sensing a slight warmth throughout the limbs, click the teeth three more times and summon the Three Hun by name: Shuangling, Taiguang, and Youjing. Command the spirits to return swiftly—Shuangling to the Dark Gate, standing at the Great Lord’s left to guard the Po; Taiguang to the Grotto Chamber Palace, facing the Yellow Elder Lord’s Red Child to guard the Mud-Pill; and Youjing to the heart, subject to its command. Each must remain in its proper place. Then recite the incantation:

*"Great Tenuity’s Dark Palace,
Central Yellow’s Primordial Azure,
Within refine the Three Hun—
Taiguang, be at peace.
Spirit-treasure, Jade Chamber,
Born with me, never stray.
Mirrored by the Great Numinous,
Should you wish to soar,
Only to the Supreme Clarity’s Upper Purity.
Should you hunger or thirst,
Only the Jade Essence of Returning Water."*

When finished, forget the self for a long while. Perform all prior sleeping visualizations first, then proceed with this practice, and afterward, calm the breath to sleep.

The Seven Po depart the human body three times each month—on the seventh, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh nights. Whenever the Po depart, they cause disordered sleep and dreams. Those who study the Dao must restrain them and prevent their wandering. At such times, lie down at night with the fingers of both hands interlocked and placed behind the head on the pillow, legs fully extended. Visualize two strands of white qi emerging from the lungs and exiting the nostrils, each the size of a small bean. They gradually expand, encircling the body ninefold from head to feet. Suddenly, the white qi transforms into Celestial Beasts: first, two Azure Dragons in the pupils of the eyes; then, two White Tigers in the nostrils, both facing outward; a Vermilion Bird above the heart, bowing its head toward the mouth to draw near; a Green Dragon and Tortoise beneath the left foot; and a Numinous Serpent beneath the right—together forming the Dark Warrior, which is trampled underfoot. Further visualize two Jade Maidens in the ears, clad in dark brocade, standing at the Gate of Life. Each holds a torch with blazing light: the left named Jiao Nü, the right named Ling Yi. All ninefold qi undergo transformation. After a long while, swallow saliva seven times, click the teeth seven times, and summon the Seven Po by name: Shigou, Fushi, Queyin, Tunzei, Feidu, Chuhui, and Choufei. First visualize the Seven Po within the Gate of Life, standing in procession at the Great Lord’s right, guarded by the first Hun, Shuangling, to prevent their movement. Then call their names and softly recite:

*"Ninefold Pristine Qi,
Subdue the Po’s malevolence.
Celestial Beasts guard the gate,
Jiao Nü holds the pass.
Hun and Po, gentle and harmonious,
Dwell in peace with me.
Never stray—
Survey the origin of form.
Should you hunger or thirst,
Drink only the Moon’s Essence and the Sun’s Elixir."*

When finished, forget the self for a long while, then settle into sleep. Those who study the Dao should revere the heart, visualize the true, and bow in gratitude.

On the Autumn Equinox, engage in visualization, maintain purity, and refrain from evil thoughts. Aspire to become a flying immortal. Those who observe prolonged fasting should, on the Autumn Equinox, first offer gratitude to their seven generations of ancestors, then reflect upon their own transgressions and vow to amend them. Those not fully detached from worldly dust should not perform this repentance on the Autumn Equinox. On this day, such repentance is invariably effective, and one must not repeat the offenses. If there are unavoidable matters yet unresolved, do not forcefully declare repentance. The scripture states: *"If you wish to study the Dao, be cautious on the Autumn Equinox; all matters, great and small, are heard above."*

At midday on that day, enter the chamber, face north, burn incense, bow twice, and kneel. Remove your headscarf and place it on the ground, then softly recite: *"The humble Perfected One [Your Name], of [Your Prefecture, County, and Abbey], respectfully addresses the Highest Sage, the Jade Dawn, the Mysterious August, the Supreme Dao Lord; the Golden Portals, the Great Peace, the Jade Dawn, the Mysterious Primordial, the Supreme Dao Lord; the Golden Portals’ Four Assistants and the Twenty-Four Perfected; and the Divine Officials of the Bureau of Life. First, I offer gratitude to my seven generations of ancestors, then to myself. Let my words be sincere and earnest."* Prostrate yourself, knock your forehead upon the ground, and bow twice more. First replace your headscarf, then rise and bow again.

If you receive auspicious dreams upon waking, rub your eyes fourteen times: close them tightly, and with both palms, rub from the inner to the outer corners. Click the teeth fourteen times and softly recite: *"Supreme High Essence,
Three Emperors’ Cinnabar Spirit,
Crimson Palace, bright and clear,
Auspicious omens reveal their truth.
Three Origins’ Gentle Hun,
Heavenly Sovereign bestows the scripture.
All endeavors harmonize,
Flying immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity,
Ever with the Jade Perfected,
Together in the Purple Court."*

If you encounter inauspicious dreams, close your eyes and hold your breath. Pinch the philtrum fourteen times with your left hand, then use the second and third fingers to press the "Mountain Source" (the space between the eyebrows) dozens of times, pressing firmly. Click the teeth fourteen times, hold your breath as before, and softly recite: *"Great Cavern’s True Mystery,
Zhang refines the Three Hun—
The first Hun swiftly guards the Seven Po,
The second Hun swiftly guards the Mud-Pill,
The third Hun obeys the heart’s command."*

Invoking the Most High Lords of the Three Origins, this humble one, [Name], having encountered an inauspicious dream, declares: the Seven Po’s wandering corpse has come to join with the source of evil. Urgently summon Tao Kang to guard my life, and report above to the Imperial Lords. The Five Elders and Nine Perfected shall each defend the gates of the body. The Yellow Gate Divine Masters and the Purple Portal Generals, wielding axes and grasping bells, shall dispel and destroy malignant spirits, transforming misfortune into fortune, severing all ties with death and decay. Should one lie down again, auspicious signs will surely manifest. After three years, only divine responses shall appear in dreams.

Whenever one awakens from sleep at night, one must swiftly close the eyes and click the teeth nine times, swallowing nine times. Then, with the hands, press the left and right sides of the nose, moving up and down dozens of times, and softly recite:

*"Most High Fourfold Luminance,
Nine Gates radiate essence.
Ears and eyes profoundly clear,
Communing with the true, reaching the numinous.
The Terrace within Heaven,
Flowing qi harmonizes and levels.
Delicate Maiden of Cloudlike Bearing,
Eye Youth of Radiant Clarity—
Flourishing acuity, penetrating brightness,
A hundred affairs distant and clear.
Preserving harmony in the Upper Origin,
Wandering the Nine Citadels.
The Five Viscera plant their roots,
Ears and eyes arise of themselves.
The Heavenly Terrace’s lush purity,
Pillars and beams stand firm.
The Seven Po bathed and refined,
The Three Hun at peace.
The Red Child carries the light,
Ever at my side.
Shielding my ears and eyes,
The Most High stands before me.
Brandishing the flowing bells,
Ten thousand evils vanish.
All wishes shall be fulfilled,
Sun and moon guard the gates.
The heart stores the Five Stars,
The True Sovereign’s invocation—
All echoes heed with reverence.
Auspiciousness responds in mystery,
Propitious omens shine forth."*

After the recitation, swallow the saliva nine times and rub the face until slightly warm. Perform this pressing and invocation upon every awakening from sleep, without fail. It will render ears and eyes keen and bright, memory strong and lucid, the nose harmoniously balanced, saliva unsputtered, the face youthful in complexion, the Hun governed and the Po refined, repelling a thousand evils and dispelling ten thousand demons.

When combing the hair, face the direction of the king’s abode; avoid combing while facing north. In the eleventh month, one should face the directions of *chen* and *hai*. At the moment of first combing, recite:

The Supreme Thearch disperses numinous power,
The Five Elders return to truth,
The Mystic Flower of the Mud-Pill Palace preserves essence to endure forever.
On the left, the sun’s concealment;
On the right, the moon’s root.
The Six Harmonies refine and purify,
A hundred spirits receive grace.

Conclude by swallowing saliva three times. Frequently change the comb to take more strokes, yet avoid causing pain, so that blood and qi flow unimpeded and hair roots remain firm. When ingesting immortal medicines, always do so on one’s natal day, and never in the presence of death, mourning, or inauspicious omens, lest one offend the womb spirits and render the medicine futile. When about to eat, do not speak of matters concerning death, nor leave food exposed, lest it attract a host of malevolent qi. While bathing, constantly visualize the Six Dings, and whatever one desires shall come to pass. In ordinary times, on the Ding days within the sixty-day cycle, bathe as usual. Bathe frequently, and on every Jiazi day, one should bathe; otherwise, bathe on the first day of each month to attain spiritual communion. The term *ji* refers to the extraordinary—namely, the first and fifth months. It is best to use east-flowing water to prepare fragrant bathwater, and there is no harm in bathing often. If one cannot do so, at least cleanse the corpse’s stench so that true qi may arrive. Be careful never to bathe while seated, exposing one’s form, nor to sit in the water. If one treads upon filth or unclean places, one should bathe to purify the body and dispel impurities. The method involves using ten taels of light bamboo leaves and four taels of peach bark, boiling them in one *hu* of clear water until bubbling, then allowing it to cool to a suitable temperature before bathing. This will dissolve all impurities.

The Northern Thearch’s method for slaying ghosts: Press the fists to the eyes, hold the breath, and visualize the true spirits of the viscera—namely, the spirits of the five viscera. Merely seeing the five viscera will naturally evoke numinous resonance; one may also visualize the Four Numinous Ones and the Yellow Dragon. First, knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then recite: *"Tianpeng, Tianpeng..."* In the world, there are base and malevolent ghosts, often appearing as women to delude and test people, though they may also transform into male forms—it is not only women. Upon encountering such beings, hold the breath and visualize the Hengfu Star within the Celestial Pass, envisioning the Dipper’s stars. The image of its auxiliary stars should guard the inch within, with the Dipper’s handle pointing forward to command the body’s spirits. Visualize the Three Palaces of the Bright Hall, the five viscera, and the twenty-four spirits. Compose one’s countenance, steady one’s will, and gaze intently at the pupil’s reflection. If it appears turbid and unclear, it is a ghost testing you. One may also secretly observe with a mirror; if it is a ghost’s test, visualize the Seven Stars before one’s face or above the head to repel it—envision the Dipper’s bowl covering the head, with the handle pointing forward. Recite the Tianpeng incantation again, and visualize being struck down by the Celestial Net. One may also recite the slaying-ghost incantation. If the reflection appears square and bright, it is an immortal or perfected person; if not perfectly square but bright and cool, it is an extraordinary person. If illuminated by firelight and casting no shadow, this is further confirmation. The enlightened will bow to them; the unenlightened will fail the test. If one mistakes an evil ghost for a perfected person, it is also a failure—beware.

The *Baopuzi* states: To enter famous mountains in search of *zhi* herbs, choose the third and ninth months, when the mountains open and yield spirit medicines. Avoid the days of mountain closure; instead, select the Tianfu day, especially when the Three Auspicious meet, as recorded in the *Three Auspicious Announcement*. Upon reaching the mountain, choose a Yin day in the Hall of Light hour, carry a spirit talisman, lead a white dog, hold a white chicken, place a *sheng* of salt and the mountain-opening talisman and proclamation on a large stone—then one will surely obtain *zhi* herbs. When gathering and ingesting *zhi* herbs, select days when the celestial stems and earthly branches are harmoniously aligned and mutually generating. These *zhi* herbs abound in famous mountains, but ordinary people lack refined Daoist resolve, their conduct is impure, their virtue shallow, and they do not understand the art of entering mountains. Even if they obtain the illustrations, they will not recognize the herbs’ forms and thus never succeed. Mountains, great or small, all have spirits; if they do not grant *zhi* herbs to a person, the herbs will remain invisible even if exposed.

The *Baopuzi* states: According to the *Nine Heavens’ Secret Record*, one must carefully select auspicious days for entering mountains. Generally, avoid the following days for mountain entry: in a long month, the 3rd, 11th, 15th, 18th, 24th, and 30th; in a short month, the 1st, 5th, 13th, 16th, 26th, and 28th. Entering on these days invites testing by mountain spirits, and one’s endeavors will fail. This applies not only to Daoists but to all who enter mountains on these days—they will encounter tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures. Entering mountains on inauspicious days will surely bring consequences; one must not enter lightly.

The *Jade Bell Classic* states: To enter famous mountains, one must know the secret techniques of *Dunjia*; otherwise, the details will not be explained. The *Lingbao Scriptures* also say: When entering mountains, choose a *Bao* day, or a *Yi* day for great auspiciousness. Using *Zhi* or *Fa* days will bring death—there are many such prohibitions. In my youth, when entering mountains, I studied *Dunjia* texts, which numbered over sixty scrolls. The techniques cannot be mastered quickly, so I compiled their essentials into a ready-reference manual, though I did not commit them to writing. Here, I outline their general principles. Those who wish to enter mountains should seek out knowledgeable individuals; such people are not rare in the world.

The *Seven Origins Central Classic* states: To seek the Dao, use the Tiannei day and Tiannei hour. To exorcise ghosts and demons and deploy talismans, use the Tianqin day and Tianqin hour. To enter mountains and ensure that no evil spirits, wolves, tigers, bandits, or thieves dare approach, exiting through Tianzang and entering through Dihu is best. Generally, the six Gui days are Tianzang, and the six Si days are Dihu. It also states: In times of chaos or remote borderlands, to enter mountains without worry, use the Shangyuan Dingmao day and the hour of Yinde to conceal oneself.

Here the methods for vanishing in broad daylight—when sun and moon lose their light and neither humans nor spirits can perceive one—are described. It further states: To seek immortality and study the Dao in renowned mountains, use the six Gui days and six Gui hours, also called the "Day of Heaven’s Heart," and one will surely transcend the world.

It also instructs: When entering mountain forests, take an object from the Green Dragon’s domain with the left hand, break it in half, and place it beneath the Star of Peng. Pass through the Hall of Brightness, enter the Yin Center, and proceed with Yu’s Pace while reciting: *"Nuobi, General of the Great Yin, open only for your descendant [Name], not for outsiders. Let those who see me take me for bundled firewood; let those who do not see me take me for a non-human."* Then break the held plant or wood, place it at the Earth Gate, take soil with the left hand and apply it to the philtrum, hold grass in the right hand to shield oneself, step forward with the left foot, and proceed with Yu’s Pace until reaching the six Gui. Hold the breath and stop—neither humans nor spirits will see you.

Generally, the six Jia days are the Green Dragon and Star of Peng; the six Bing days are the Hall of Brightness; the six Ding days are the Yin Center.

The method of Yu’s Pace: Stand upright, right foot forward, left foot behind. Advance again, bringing the left foot parallel to the right—this is one step. Next, advance the left foot, then the right, bringing the right foot parallel to the left—this is two steps. Then advance the left foot again, bringing the right foot parallel to it—this is three steps. Such is the method of Yu’s Pace. All who perform the world’s myriad wonders know this step; it is not unique to this practice. This completes the hexagram *Jiji* (Already Fording). The first and second traces are not counted among the nine traces, yet they remain part of the sequence: one step spans seven feet, totaling twenty-one feet, which aligns with the nine-trace Yu’s Pace of old.

*Baopuzi* states: The so-called "Preserving Day" in the *Lingbao* texts refers to days when the heavenly stem generates the earthly branch, such as Jiawu or Yisi days. Jia is Wood, Wu is Fire; Yi is also Wood, Si is also Fire—Fire is born of Wood. The "Righteous Day" refers to days when the earthly branch generates the heavenly stem, such as Renshen or Guiyou days. Ren is Water, Shen is Metal; Gui is also Water, You is also Metal—Water is born of Metal. The "Controlling Day" refers to days when the heavenly stem restrains the earthly branch, such as Wuzi or Jihai days. Wu is Earth, Zi is Water; Ji is also Earth, Hai is also Water—Earth restrains Water. The "Conquering Day" refers to days when the earthly branch restrains the heavenly stem, such as Jiashen or Yiyou days. Jia is Wood, Shen is Metal; Yi is also Wood, You is also Metal—Metal restrains Wood. Extending this principle, all can be understood.

*Baopuzi* states: To enter renowned mountains, use the Jiazi day of the Opening or Removing phase, and hang five-inch squares of five-colored silk on a large stone—what you seek will surely be obtained.

*Baopuzi* states: When entering mountains, one should know the Six Jia Secret Incantation. Recite: *"Lin bing dou zhe jie zhen lie qian xing."* These nine characters, when silently invoked, repel all dangers. This is the essence of the essential Dao.

The above method is broadly similar with minor variations. Here follows the Forty-Nine True Talismans of the Yellow Court’s Womb from Lord Lao:

To enter mountain forests, on a Jiazi or Yinchou day, write in cinnabar on white silk, place it on a table at night, face the Northern Dipper, and offer wine and dried meat. State your name, bow twice, and tuck the talisman into your collar. It will repel the mountain’s myriad ghosts, spirits, tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures. Daoists entering seclusion in mountain forests may also use this method.

First Talisman
Second Talisman

Third Talisman
These three talismans are all the Mountain-Residing Talismans of Lord Lao. Write in cinnabar on peach wood boards, enlarging the script to fill the entire surface, and affix them to the four sides and four corners of doorways, as well as along paths and strategic locations. Within fifty paces of one’s dwelling, they repel mountain spirits and the hundred ghostly beings—proven effective.

These two talismans are the Mountain-Entering Talismans of Lord Lao. They may also be placed upon the beams and pillars within doorways. For households dwelling in mountain forests or those entering briefly, these talismans may be used, with the script written identically on both sides.

These two talismans are to be inscribed on both sides in the same manner. This is the talisman for entering mountains to repel tigers and wolves, transmitted by the immortal Chen Anshi. Write in cinnabar on silk, each of the two talismans distinct, and carry them behind the elbow—left for men, right for women. They may also be worn as pendants or placed in the four directions of one’s dwelling, each written on a board. When relocating, the talismans must be removed and taken away.

These two talismans are the seals of Lord Lao for repelling the hundred serpents, tigers, and wolves. Carve them into the heartwood of jujube wood, two inches in length, bow twice, and wear them—divinely efficacious. Even laypeople who believe may carry them for great fortune.

These three talismans may also be placed on the left and right, front and back of cattle, horses, and houses, as well as pigpens, to repel tigers and wolves.

The secret essentials of the Purple Court are the cultivation arts of the Yellow Lord Lao. Their origin must not be recklessly transmitted to unworthy recipients, lest calamity befall one’s ancestors—this must be strictly heeded.

The methods of cultivation for the Purple Court’s secret essentials conclude.
