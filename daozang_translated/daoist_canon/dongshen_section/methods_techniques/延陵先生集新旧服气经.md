**Collected New and Old Qi-Absorption Classics by Master Yanling**

*With Commentary by Sangyuzi*

**General Principles of Cultivation**

The *Scripture of Immortal Perfected Ones* states: When a person nears death, they begin to cherish their body; when guilt is already determined, they think of reforming; when illness has taken hold, they turn to medicine. Yet the net of Heaven has already been cast—how can one escape? Thus, the wise and superior persons cherish life before it is imperiled, fear calamity before it sprouts, and remedy illness before it arises.

There are three grades in the cultivation of the Dao: the upper years, the middle years, and the lower years.
- The *upper years* refer to ages twenty and thirty. Those in their upper years awaken early to the Great Dao, discern its profound mysteries, and possess robust marrow, sturdy bones, full sinews, and plump flesh. Proceeding with ease along the Way, they achieve success without fail.
- The *middle years* refer to ages forty and fifty. Those in their middle years awaken to the Dao belatedly, with sinews, flesh, bones, and marrow each diminished by half. Their progress is uncertain, like laboring at midday.
- The *lower years* refer to ages sixty and seventy. Those in their lower years retain but two or three parts of their bones, marrow, sinews, and vessels. Yet they may still be restored through cultivation, like working at dusk.

Those above eighty have already settled their karmic fate, and no method can save them. Their brains are exhausted, their marrow spent, their myriad gates desiccated, their spirit departed, and their qi extinguished—they walk like corpses and move like ghosts.

Sangyuzi remarks: A corpse is likened to one without awareness; a ghost, to one with awareness yet devoid of human sentiment. To walk like a corpse, to move like a ghost—who, then, animates them? One knows that the primordial qi still lingers, though diminished and nearing its end. If such a one encounters a perfected being and obtains the Great Elixir, it is like holding a cartload of withered reeds to the last flicker of a dying flame—yet it may still blaze forth in brilliance. Thus, when it is said that none can be saved, it refers only to those for whom qi cultivation has come too late; their own affairs are beyond remedy. But if a transcendent sage intervenes to preserve their life, even the dead may rise, their flesh and bones reviving from withered husks—what is there that cannot be done? Even in death, they remain part of the realm of things.

The ancient worthies and superior persons, knowing the fleeting nature of life like a candle in the wind, restrained their wills and mastered their emotions. Forsaking glory and abandoning worldly attachments, they dedicated their bodies to the Dao, refusing to let external things cause harm.

The Dao is qi. Qi is the root of the body. As fish die when parted from water, how can humans endure when severed from the Dao? Therefore, those who preserve life must devote themselves to cultivating qi; those who cherish qi must devote themselves to preserving essence. When both essence and qi are preserved, this is called safeguarding the True.

Humans possess three cinnabar fields: the Upper, Middle, and Lower Elixir Fields.
- The *Upper Elixir Field* is the brain, also called the Muddy Pellet.
- The *Middle Elixir Field* is the heart, also called the Crimson Palace.
- The *Lower Elixir Field* is the Sea of Qi, also called the Gate of Essence.

Within each of the Three Origins resides a spirit.

Sangyuzi remarks: Essence transforms into qi, and when qi takes form, spirit gathers therein. What is spirit? It is the name for numinous illumination. When one fully comprehends the transformation of qi, and qi is whole, then spirit is whole. If primordial qi fills the body, the hundred bones and myriad apertures will naturally be replete with spirit. This repletion is nothing other than qi arriving and spirit following. When people today face worries and hardships, their awareness momentarily falters when distress strikes—this is because qi is obstructed and fails to arrive. If the mind is serene and qi harmonious, how could spirit be confined to the Three Origins alone?

Essence is the root of the body; the root is the abode of qi. When essence is whole, qi is whole; when essence is depleted, qi is depleted. When qi is depleted, spirit departs, riding upon it. Thus, essence and qi must both be preserved.

The *Yellow Court Scripture* states:
*For long life, be most cautious in the chamber’s haste,*
*Why cause death and make the spirits weep?*
*Instead, absorb qi and gather the essence of the child,*
*An inch of field, a foot of dwelling—thus govern life.*
*If you drain the sea and empty the hundred streams,*
*The leaves fall, the tree withers, and verdure is lost.*

Thus, the ancient worthies who attained the Dao all succeeded by cherishing qi and preserving essence.

Qi absorption is fundamentally called *embryonic breathing*. Embryonic breathing resembles an infant in the womb: for ten months, it does not eat yet grows and matures, receiving the upright qi. Without thought or念, utterly still and serene, it takes in primordial qi, transforming its joints and viscera, all naturally accomplished. How could it require the protection of a nurse or preparations for hunger and thirst? Upon emerging from the womb, it immediately inhales external qi, and with its cries, experiences dryness and dampness, hunger and satiety—seeming to harbor thoughts—and thus loses its primordial qi.

If one can emulate an infant in the womb, absorbing internal qi, grasping firmness and guarding unity, this is called *embryonic breathing*.

Sangyuzi remarks: To say that inhaling external qi results in the loss of primordial qi is incorrect. If this were so, no living persons would remain in the world.

The *Lotus Sutra* states: *Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, let body and mind be undisturbed.* It also speaks of qi as the master of the mind: when the mind is perverse, qi is perverse; when the mind is upright, qi is upright. All human actions—raising a hand, moving a foot, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—arise from the mind. The mind’s movements and stillness are all responses of qi to intention. Intention follows the mind; when the mind is harmonious, qi is whole, and when qi is whole, spirit is whole. When qi is cut off, spirit perishes; when spirit perishes, one becomes mere dust.

Thus, physicians first examine the pulse to assess the qi of the five viscera and four seasons, investigate the sources of illness, and only then prescribe remedies. If one can discern the signs of qi, regulating inhalation and exhalation through the mouth and nose without momentary lapse, the five viscera will naturally harmonize, the pulse will regulate, and qi will flow smoothly.

The human body aligns with heaven and earth, blending yin and yang in its qi. From skin and bone marrow to the viscera and the constructive and defensive systems, from the rhythms of breath to the shifts of cold and heat, all correspond to the Two Modes and resonate with the Five Phases.

Thus, when heaven and earth are in disharmony, the qi of yin and yang becomes disordered, the viscera fall out of balance, and the signs in the meridians manifest as illness. External afflictions arise from wind, while internal disorders stem from qi. As it is said: "In serenity and emptiness, true qi follows; with spirit guarded within, whence can illness come?" Truly so!

Therefore, one must understand the principles of form and spirit, nurturing and preserving them, discerning internal and external ailments, and cultivating them with care. Qi Bo the Eminent said: "Those who consume qi become numinous and long-lived; those who consume grain gain wisdom but shorten their lives."

What, then, do practitioners of qi cultivation seek? Through their efforts, qi transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into marrow. In one year, qi is renewed; in two, blood; in three, the meridians; in four, the flesh; in five, the marrow; in six, the sinews; in seven, the bones; in eight, the hair; in nine, the form. Then, the thirty-six thousand spirits within the body transmute into a true immortal, known as a *zhenren*.

Thus, the subtleties of intention lie in the profound and unfathomable. Those who cultivate the true are of three ranks, each differing in their approach and disposition.

The highest rank consists of those whose nature is empty and at ease, whose will is pure and refined, whose words align with the Dao, and whose conduct is flawless. Such individuals possess the innate capacity of past ages—like a stone cast into water, they are beyond comparison.

The middle rank includes those who may hold high office or live in remote places, who enjoy wealth or prestige, or who waver between advancement and retreat. When they hear the Dao, they are restless even in sleep; when they pursue fame, their thoughts race all day. As their two minds contend, the victor prevails, but in hesitation, six or seven out of ten are lost.

Below the middle rank are those whose time has passed, whose twilight years bring frailty, whose sinews weaken, and whose spirit fades. Though they may still enjoy wealth, the sun nears its setting, and in hindsight, they gnaw their navels in regret, only then seeking the right path. Even at this stage, if they rouse their will with precision, they may yet salvage one or two parts of themselves. These are the sorrows the sages of old bequeathed to later generations—may you examine their roots and cultivate true faith.

**Master Zhang Guo’s Qi-Absorption Method**
Lie supine daily, calm the mind, and banish thoughts. Hold the breath, clench the fists, inhale through the nose, and exhale through the mouth, ensuring no sound reaches the ears. The breath should be fine and subtle; when full, close it off until sweat appears on the soles of the feet. Begin with one or two breaths, then increase to a hundred or more. When stifled, draw in a slight breath and resume closure. Use hot exhalations (*he*) and cold exhalations (*ling* or *chui*) to regulate. With one or two thousand breaths, one may cease taking grain and dispense with medicine. Occasionally drink a cup or two of good wine or fresh water to clear the intestines. At five thousand breaths, one gains efficacy in all endeavors and will know it intuitively—then one may sleep in water!

In the practice of qi-absorption for longevity, consistency is paramount. Only when true qi descends can resonance occur. How can one indulge in desires and yet hope for transcendence as a feathered immortal? Such a thing does not exist. Even immortals whose merit and conduct are incomplete cannot achieve this—how much less can ordinary mortals? Yet if you trust in the old master and practice diligently, you will come to know it for yourself.

When qi does not flow smoothly, it may be too cold, too hot, too slow, or too rapid—adjust it until harmony is achieved.

**Master Luan’s Qi-Absorption Method**
First, sit on a broad seat, place both hands on the knees, loosen clothing and belt, and relax the limbs. Contemplate the equal nature of dharmata and the non-duality of life and death. After half a meal’s duration, close the eyes, raise the tongue to the palate, and slowly exhale long breaths—one, then two. Initially, others may hear the sound of the breath entering and leaving, but gradually it becomes finer. After ten or more breaths, one may hear it oneself.

Whenever pain or itching arises, visualize it exiting from that spot. If any abnormality is sensed, gradually lengthen the exhalation, refining it from coarse to fine. After ten breaths, return to the initial state.

Someone asked: "Why begin with coarse breaths that gradually refine, and at the end, return from fine to coarse?"

Master Luan replied: "All movement, sight, food, and speech are coarse. As Sangyuzi said: 'For those learning qi cultivation, whether before practice or after, eating, drinking, and speaking are ordinary matters.' I wish to ensure continuity, preventing abrupt disjunction between beginning and end."

After waking from sleep, resume the practice as before, like a tiger carrying its cub—neither too urgent nor too slow. Regardless of cold or heat, first purify the room to prevent distractions and quiet the mind.

He also said: "How to discern disharmony in the Four Great Elements? Observe the lips and mouth: cold indicates excess wind; heat, excess fire; roughness, excess earth; slipperiness, excess water. If neither cold nor hot, neither rough nor slippery, they are in harmony.

Or listen to the voice: sound indicates excess wind; movement, excess panting; itching, excess heat; drool, excess water. If there is no sound, no movement, no itching, no drool, they are in harmony.

Or observe the mind: vexation indicates heat binding; confusion, wind binding; anxiety and palpitations, panting binding; restlessness, water binding. If there is no vexation, no confusion, no palpitations, no restlessness, they are in harmony.

Disharmony in the Four Great Elements arises from two sources: external or internal. Cold, heat, hunger, satiety, fatigue, and exhaustion are external causes; fame, profit, joy, anger, sound, color, flavor, and contemplation are internal causes.

In regulating qi, follow nature, maintaining it as if it were continuous yet not forced. Simply not taking life as life is wiser than nurturing life."

Sangyuzi said: "All scriptures advise that in exhalation and inhalation, one should not hear one’s own breath. Yet Master Luan speaks of exhaling coarsely and gradually refining, then refining and gradually coarsening—I was deeply puzzled. Upon reading further, where it says 'follow nature,' I realized that the gradual progression from coarse to fine is the lowest level of practice, designed to avoid forcing it to compete with nature."

Yet the highest attainment lies in subtlety so refined that one no longer hears one’s own breath—proceeding from the finest subtlety to the point of no-breath, this is the full realization of fetal respiration. I fear that even after learners reach this stage, they may remain bound by the written word, fixating on the sequence of coarse and fine, and thus turn against the natural Way—how lamentable! In this matter, how could one fail to discern clearly?

**Li Fengshi’s Mountain Recluse Qi-Swallowing Method**
Whenever you wish to swallow qi, do so as an infant suckling milk: when the breath feels stifled, swallow it; then continue suckling and swallowing. If the stifling becomes severe, release it through the mouth, but always keep it exceedingly subtle. With each swallow, use the mind to guide it down to the navel; if there is illness, direct it to the afflicted area.

When practicing, first close the eyes and focus the mind, clench the fists to stabilize spirit and qi, then begin. First perform *daoyin* to relax the four limbs, and only then proceed. For external qi-swallowing, do not use a pillow; stretch out the hands and feet, and remain composed. If the illness is severe and the qi feels extremely stifled, repeatedly raise it to the utmost, then clench the fists again, swallow the qi, and take one more breath. When the qi flows smoothly and sound emerges from the ears, success is achieved. Guard this! Guard this well!

This is internal qi—practice it regardless of early or late, clear or overcast weather. Generally, clear days yield the greatest essence; if swallowing external qi, one encounters both life-giving and death-dealing qi. Know this: if you practice for ten years but skip five days, it will be of no benefit.

Each day at dawn and noon, take the first dose, then refine and compress it, pressing with the hands to prevent hardness below the heart and abdomen.

**The Sage of Mount Meng’s Qi-Swallowing Method**
Lie on your right side, with the right flank resting on the mat, slightly drawing in the feet and aligning the head to face south. Clench both fists and place them beside the cheeks. Close your eyes, inhale internal qi, forcefully open the throat, and swallow—seven swallows, then exhale once. When ill, swallow once or twice, then exhale once. Once adept, you may swallow seven or fourteen times before exhaling.

Next, regulate the breath to ensure even inhalation and exhalation, then swallow again as before, for a total of forty-nine swallows. Then rise and sit upright. Sit with knees bent, clasp the hands together and hold the knees, hold the breath, and distend the abdomen—fourteen or twenty-one times. When the qi is full, exhale, then regulate the breath again, taking care not to become breathless or weak. Once regulated, hold the breath again—fourteen or twenty-one times—before exhaling, until the abdomen feels harmonious and comfortable. Rest when done.

If sweat emerges and both head and feet grow warm, the qi has circulated throughout. Then you will always feel sated and full, the Three Passes and hundred joints will flow freely and comfortably. Practice this for ten years, and you will ascend as an immortal, growing old yet retaining a youthful countenance.

The ancient scriptures all employ visualization, but this may prove laborious and hinder the mind’s progress. Qi-swallowing originates in fetal respiration—simply free yourself from thoughts, and you will naturally align with the transformative power of the primordial. Practice long enough, and you will come to know its wonders for yourself.

While traveling on Mount Meng, I encountered this sage, who appeared to be under fifty, yet his spirit was clear and luminous, quite unlike ordinary folk. When I asked, he said he had roamed this mountain before the *Zhenguan* era, refusing to give his name and calling himself simply "Old Man." I bowed earnestly and entreated him, and he graciously imparted this secret. Practicing it has brought me great benefit. Wondrous indeed!

Ah! For those who wish to attain deathlessness, let the intestines be free of waste, and in an instant, impurities will vanish. To achieve long life, let the five viscera be radiant with essence. Thus, the *Huangting* states: "Why not consume the qi of Great Harmony and its essence? Then you may enter the Yellow Tranquility and never die." The *Yin Fu* says: "Accumulated fire can burn away the Five Poisons." The Five Poisons are the five flavors, and mastering the five flavors can lead to long life. The Queen Mother of the West told Emperor Wu: "Those who can augment and transform are recorded in the registers of the highest immortals. Those who neither augment nor transform cannot escape the calamity of death." This augmentation and transformation mean the ability to replenish essence and renew the form. By constantly cherishing essence, grasping firmness, closing the breath, and swallowing fluids, qi transforms into blood, blood into essence, essence into fluid, and fluid into bone. Practicing this without weariness, the spirit becomes full and abundant. In the first year, the qi is renewed; in the second, the bones; one text says the blood. In the third year, the blood is renewed; one text says the vessels. In the fourth, the flesh; in the fifth, the sinews; one text says the marrow. In the sixth, the marrow; in the seventh, the bones; in the eighth, the hair; in the ninth, the form. After ten years, the Dao is accomplished, and one attains the rank of Perfected. With free transformation, spirit officials and jade maidens will attend you.

Wang’s *New Methods of Qi-Swallowing for Mountain Recluses*:
Zixia said: "Those who consume qi become spiritually luminous and long-lived." The *Huangting* states: "The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root; if you can cultivate this, you may endure forever." In Buddhist *śamatha-vipaśyanā*, there is a method using qi to heal illness, showing that qi and fluids mutually nourish one another. Ancient scriptures prescribed specific times for practice, but now, in discussing qi consumption, we no longer adhere to fixed times. Fluids should constantly assist qi to keep it smooth and harmonious. What is called "consuming qi" refers to internal qi, swallowing it in place of food. Fluids are swallowed in place of drink. Above, one consumes fresh qi; below, one expels old qi, pushing out the stale and taking in the new. Swallowing qi need not be to fullness, nor must the expulsion be constant—simply ensure it is odorless, and equilibrium will naturally be achieved. Swallowing qi need not be frequent; when the qi is clear, the abdomen will naturally settle. Thus, there is no need for fullness. When beginning, eat when hungry, and stop when not. While eating, always follow with one or two swallows of qi to aid digestion. As food gradually diminishes, increase the number of swallows until the food is gone and the qi naturally descends. If you feel the qi slightly obstructed in the abdomen, either walk or stand, turning to the west, and use intention to drive it downward. If it does not descend, do not rush or force it; simply use intention to dissolve it, and soon it will naturally be expelled. When consuming qi, if you need to belch, let it come freely—do not suppress it. Sangyuzi said: "Those with shallow practice belch often, for they have just begun and obtained little true qi, so the new qi is abundant but unrefined. The life-officials cannot receive it, so it should be gradually refined." Moreover, when first practicing, the swallowed qi often fails to reach the *qi* sea, leaving it nowhere to settle, so it rises back up as belching. If the internal qi enters the *qi* sea, belching naturally ceases. If, after practicing for a long time, belching suddenly recurs, it is either due to overeating or the accidental intake of external qi. If you need to expel it downward, let it go—do not hold it back. Proceed with careful attention, adjusting for fullness and emptiness, and in time, you will grasp its wonders.

It is advisable to walk and perform gentle *daoyin* exercises, but do not do so too frequently. In all worldly matters, proceed with thoughtful deliberation. For illnesses, fast for three to several days; for mild cases, one or two days suffice, or even just a short while. If the illness is in the upper body, use intention to drive it upward; if below, drive it downward. For ailments in the limbs or on the left or right sides, use intention to expel them, and you will recover. Above all, do not hold the breath, for doing so will generate illness. The foods consumed should be moist and smooth, suitable for all seasons. During miasmic fevers, simply fast for several days and rest quietly to recover.

*Methods of Qi Utilization by the Great Dignitary Master Xuan Su, the Perfected*:
In all methods of using qi, first perform *daoyin* exercises to the left and right, loosening the joints, softening the sinews, and relaxing the body. Then sit upright, exhale and inhale three times to eliminate blockages, calm the mind, and forget the body, allowing the breath to settle. After a long while, slowly exhale turbid qi through the mouth and draw in clear qi through the nose, repeating this six or seven times—this is called "regulating the qi." Once regulated, close both mouth and nose, hold the breath lightly, and fill the mouth with qi. Swish it in the mouth fifteen times or more for better results. Swallow it as if taking a large gulp of water, directing it with the mind to the *qi* sea. After a long while, swallow again in the same manner, continuing until the abdomen is full, without limiting the number of swallows. Then empty the mind and fill the abdomen, close the mouth, and massage the abdomen with both hands to circulate the qi. Gently release the breath through the nose, ensuring it does not become labored, lest harmony be lost. Then lie flat on your back, keeping the body level, with the pillow at the same height as the body. Clench the fists, extend the arms four or five inches from the body, and space the feet four or five inches apart. Then inhale through the nose, close both mouth and nose, and focus the mind on the qi circulating throughout the body—this is called "circulating the qi." If there is illness, direct the qi to the affected area. If the qi becomes urgent, gently release the breath through the nose without opening the mouth. Once the breath is calm, close it again as before. Shake the toes and fingers, along with the joints, until sweat appears—this is called "qi passage." Then slowly roll onto your side, draw up the legs, first lying on the left side for ten breaths, then turning to the right side for another ten breaths—this is called "repairing deficiencies."

After practicing this method for a month, whether standing or sitting at any time, whenever the abdomen feels empty, perform the swallowing technique without regard to time or season. After eating, take one or two mouthfuls of plain rice, mix it with water, and swallow—this is called "washing the five viscera." Then rinse the mouth thoroughly with clean water, keeping the mind empty and the abdomen full, allowing the visceral leaves to unfold. Swallowing in this way prevents the five viscera from retaining the qi of the five flavors. Once done, first exhale turbid qi through the mouth, then draw in clear qi through the nose, without limit to the amount, until fully released. If a turbid qi is expelled downward, immediately replenish it by swallowing a mouthful of harmonized qi. When eating cakes or drinking tea, external qi enters; as soon as it does, close the mouth. Once closed, the external qi that entered the mouth should be expelled through the nose. The qi drawn in through the nose is then clear qi. Always keep the mouth closed while eating to prevent external qi—dead qi—from entering. Whenever speaking, qi exits through the mouth, so it must be drawn back in through the nose—this is the constant practice of exhalation and inhalation.

In all postures—walking, standing, or sitting—constantly wiggle the toes, for this is called "allowing the qi to flow downward." Persist in this practice, whether in motion or stillness. If, due to imprecise timing, external qi enters the abdomen and causes slight pain, close the breath and rub the abdomen one hundred times to guide the qi downward. If the qi rises and must not be expelled, press it downward—this is called "regulating and harmonizing."

Avoid foods that disrupt qi, as well as raw, cold, dry, or greasy items. If this method is practiced without interruption, after nine years of cultivation, one will walk on emptiness as if on solid ground and tread upon water as if on land.

**Preface and Secret Instructions on Embryonic Breathing**

**Preface:**
While in the womb, one is an infant; at birth, a child. The infant in the womb, its mouth filled with earth, breathes not through the nose or mouth but draws qi through the navel to nourish its form, thus achieving completion. Therefore, the navel is the Gate of Life. If a newborn appears alive but then suddenly fails, simply soak the umbilical cord in warm water and apply it to the abdomen three to five times to revive it. This confirms that the navel is indeed the Gate of Life, a truth beyond doubt.

Those who seek embryonic breathing must first understand its root. By following this principle, one’s breathing becomes like that of an infant in the womb—hence the name "embryonic breathing." Thus, returning to the origin and reverting to infancy has its reason. With unbroken practice, the Dao of the embryonic immortal is achieved. Therefore, the preface clarifies both the essence and application.

**Instructions:**
To practice embryonic breathing, first enter a quiet chamber where no one may disturb you. Sit upright, place the left foot over the right, loosen the clothing and belt, and gently press and stretch the joints. Clench the fists and rest them on the thighs. Perform three to five cycles of exhalation and inhalation to eliminate stagnation. Calm the mind, empty the heart, and fill the abdomen. Slowly sway the body left and right to unfold the visceral leaves. Once done, return to a steady posture. Then strike the "Heavenly Drum" thirty-six times, rinse the mouth with the "Flower Pool," and begin visualization.

Imagine the Vermilion Bird above the head, the Dark Warrior beneath the feet, the Azure Dragon on the left shoulder, and the White Tiger on the right. Next, visualize a point one inch behind the space between the eyebrows as the "Hall of Light," two inches inward as the "Cavern Chamber," and three inches inward as the "Palace of the Cinnabar Field," also called the "Mud Pill Palace." Within this palace resides a spirit two inches tall, wearing a green crown, clad in red-brown robes, and holding a crimson tablet.

Next, visualize the Middle Cinnabar Field—the heart, also called the "Crimson Palace." Within it dwells a spirit similarly robed in red-brown. Then visualize the Lower Cinnabar Field, located two and a half inches below the navel in the "Purple Tenuity Palace," also known as the "Sea of Qi." Within it resides another spirit, also clad in red-brown.

Next, visualize the five viscera, beginning with the heart, and extend the visualization to the five viscera and six bowels. From each viscus, emit its corresponding directional qi, merging with the white clouds from the three cinnabar fields into a single qi that rises from the crown, radiating nine-colored light to a height of three *zhang*. Envision the body within this luminous sphere.

At this point, close both mouth and nose, focusing the mind on the Sea of Qi. Let the embryonic qi enter and exit, with breathing confined to the navel. If the qi becomes urgent, gently release the breath through the nose, and once the qi is calm, resume the practice as before. Sweating marks the completion of one cycle, though the number of cycles is not fixed. If the body feels hot or stifled, direct the qi to flow throughout the body like steam rising from rice—this is called "full breathing."

With prolonged practice, one enters profound stillness and emerges into wondrous silence, clearly perceiving the five viscera and six bowels within the body, as well as the upper and lower abdomen. The stomach, filled with dispersed fat, appears yellow like earth. The spleen, one foot two inches long, lies above the stomach, constantly grinding back and forth; if it stops, harmony is lost, and food is not digested—this indicates it is not grinding. In such cases, close the breath and rub the abdomen one hundred times to restore its natural movement.

Next, visualize the heart: it resembles an unopened red lotus, three inches long, hanging downward, with nine orifices—two at the back—and seven black hairs, two and a half inches long, on its front. Then visualize the lungs: they resemble an open white lotus with five hanging petals, covered by white veins and membranes, resting above the heart. Next, visualize the liver: located behind the heart, it has seven purple-green leaves with yellow veins and membranes, with the third leaf on the left side being its position. The gallbladder is green-yellow and two and a half inches long. Then visualize the kidneys: shaped like an inverted cup, black in color, attached to the spine three inches from the navel, smaller above and larger below, with the left kidney above and the right below.

Survey the entire body—thirty-six positions and three hundred sixty joints—all bound by sinews. The bones are jade-like in their blue-white hue, the sinews yellow-white, and the marrow like ice and snow. There are three hundred sixty acupoints, each filled with fresh blood like rivers, lakes, and ponds.

Observe further that the second joint of the middle toe on the left foot is the source of the bloodstream. From there, it surges forth, flowing through the body in a single day and night, circling thirty-six thousand times before reaching the second joint of the middle toe on the right foot, where it is fully transformed. Thus, when one sleeps, one must lie on the side with limbs curled—this preserves the yin *po*. Upon awakening, one should stretch the feet and hands, allowing the *qi* to permeate the entire body, thereby spreading the yang *qi*.

By practicing thus, one aligns with the meaning of "acting in accord with the good times" as spoken in the classics. With prolonged practice, both mouth and nose cease their breathing, as if one were an infant in the womb, drawing *qi* through the navel—this is called "embryonic breathing." Uninterrupted, after thirty years, one may bind a cord around the neck without obstructing breath, nor will there be any panting. The breath remains in the navel, and one may sit underwater for ten days—or five days—with equal ease. Having mastered this, the effects are as described above. Once the truth of this is realized, one must further cultivate the Dao; this practice is but one gateway and cannot be neglected.

*The Subtleties of Embryonic Breathing*
The Old Lord said: "One who knows the Dao is not slain by Heaven; one who embodies virtue is not harmed by Earth. Embracing both Dao and virtue, the body does not decay. Internally nourishing the Great Harmony, with primordial *qi* as the foundation, refining oneself in stillness, relinquishing the body and releasing the form, the mind free of thoughts and cares, the viscera settled and stable—thus one penetrates the Great Harmony. Long life and enduring vision arise when the *qi* lies hidden and unmoving, the mind like flowing water, where the preceding wave departs and the succeeding wave follows without return. Practicing without cease, one attains the true Dao."

Each day, enter a quiet chamber to guard the Mysterious Origin. The Mysterious Origin refers to preserving the Mysterious Gate. Within the Mysterious lies the yet more Mysterious—this is my life. Within life lies life—this is my form. Within form lies form—this is my essence. Within essence lies essence—this is my *qi*. Within *qi* lies *qi*—this is my spirit. Within spirit lies spirit—this is my spontaneity.

Virtue rides the chariot of form; the Dao rides the steed of *qi*. The *hun* is rooted in essence; the *po* dwells in the eyes. When the form is wearied, virtue scatters; when *qi* strays, the Dao rebels. When essence wanes, the *hun* is harmed; when the eyes stir, the *po* weakens. Thus, one guards stillness and cherishes *qi*, preserves essence and treasures spirit, so that Dao and virtue congeal and coalesce, while *hun* and *po* remain steadfast.

Therefore, one who embodies the Dao speaks not, yet grasps the truth of *qi*; the skin becomes lustrous, the root of attaining the Dao. Hands and feet perspire, essence and *qi* overflow, hunger and thirst vanish—like the tortoise and dragon, one achieves embryonic breathing, ceaseless and enduring, effortlessly sustained. One drinks from the Mysterious Spring and ascends to the Great Clarity, returning to youth and reverting to infancy—such is the spontaneity of the Dao.

The Supreme Dao is not distant; it lies within one’s own body. With a mind refined and subtle, life is eternally preserved. As for the Dao, some transmit the practice of ingesting the Five Sprouts—the Five Sprouts being the generative *qi* of the Five Phases. *The Yellow Court Inner Scene* states: "Preserve and rinse with the Five Sprouts to banish hunger and thirst." Absorb the *qi* of the eight directions, four seasons, sun, moon, and stars, envisioning it entering through the crown and exiting through the nose. Though ancient classics record this, few who practice it achieve success, nor is it attainable for those who consume grains.

Thus, many who practice *qi*-ingestion fail to grasp its secrets, laboring in vain. Once the gateway is found and the secrets comprehended, success lies in diligent and unrelenting practice. Sang Yuzi said: "To crane like a crow or seagull, aspiring to Heaven and Earth, is to overreach—those teachings on the Five Sprouts, eight directions, four seasons, sun, moon, and stars are not meant for beginners. Without attainment, they are futile; one must wait until one has drawn somewhat nearer."

For embryonic breathing and *qi*-ingestion, begin after midnight, swallowing the internal *qi* seven times. With each swallow, regulate the breath for six or seven cycles before swallowing again. Each swallow should sound like water flowing over rapids—this indicates the *qi* is unobstructed. Direct it straight down to the *qi* Sea, where it congeals in the abdomen, filling it like a womb with child. The breath then arises from within this "embryo," and only when the *qi* Sea is replete does the Way of embryonic breathing take form. When the *qi* is perfected, the pure *qi* congeals into an embryo, while the turbid *qi* disperses outward—through the hands, feet, and hair.

Once the embryo is formed, all illnesses naturally depart, and one gradually communes with the immortals. Those who study *qi*-ingestion today may obtain ancient methods or receive instruction from unorthodox sources, merely closing the mouth and constricting the nose, prizing long breaths while remaining ignorant of the blockages in the five viscera, which damage the upright *qi*. Such practices are far from natural breathing, only wearying body and spirit without benefit.

When ingesting *qi*, the joints must be open, the Stomach Sea receptive to primordial *qi*. Once the *qi* is firmly gathered, the joints close again, and one slowly exhales and inhales external *qi* through the nose, ensuring no mingling of internal and external *qi*, nor any leakage of the embryonic *qi*. Silently count the breaths by curling the fingers, from ten to a hundred, then from a hundred to two hundred, three hundred—this is the "lesser circulation." The ears and eyes become keen, and all illnesses are cured. To forcibly block the mouth and nose in an attempt to practice embryonic breathing is entirely misguided. If the mouth and nose are obstructed, the viscera are harmed—what benefit could there be?

For those who ingest internal *qi*, little effort yields great results. The key lies in calming the spirit and quieting the mind, free from disturbance—then the *qi* pathways become unobstructed, the joints open, and primordial harmony is contained within, never dissipating. The body becomes moist and lustrous, hands and feet perspire—the secret of the Way to longevity lies herein.

After midnight, swallow seven times and hold the breath, keeping the internal *qi* within while slowly exhaling and inhaling external *qi* through the nose and mouth, ensuring no mingling of internal and external. At the fifth watch, swallow seven more times, and again at dawn, totaling twenty-one swallows. Those who have severed their roots are not bound by this number; when the stomach is empty, they swallow internal *qi*, keeping it constantly full, naturally free from hunger and thirst. Initially, this may seem difficult, but with long practice, the internal and external *qi* naturally cease to mingle.

Gradually, the joints open fully, the hair and pores become unobstructed, and *qi* moves freely of its own accord—no longer requiring the slow passage of external *qi* through the nose. The subtlety of fetal breathing culminates here.

A classic on fetal breathing states: "Simply draw *qi* in and out gently, and primordial *qi* will not escape. Naturally, internal and external *qi* do not mingle—this is called fetal breathing." Yet for beginners, after sealing the internal *qi*, one must still allow a faint exchange of *qi* through the nose, ensuring it does not reach the throat. If the breath reverses and surges upward, unable to be restrained, release it slowly until it flows smoothly, then resume closure once the *qi* is regulated. The key lies in the gentle passage of *qi* through the nose, never allowing it to reach the throat, and restraining it with utmost effort. After a brief practice, harmony suddenly arises, and internal and external *qi* become serene. This occurs because the joints open and the pores unblock. At this stage, even a thousand breaths bring no fatigue.

The subtlety of fetal breathing lies in thoughtlessness and carefreeness, the body merging with nature, the mind like dead ashes, the form like withered wood—then the hundred vessels flow freely, and the joints open. If worries and distractions arise ceaselessly, seeking the ultimate Dao will be in vain, despite arduous effort. Master Sangyuzi said: "There is the *qi* of suffering and vexation, the *qi* of greed and malice—all such perverse *qi* obstructs the primordial *qi*, just as petty men block the path, leaving gentlemen no room to display their talents." This Dao is most subtle and wondrous; only those who have transcended the mundane may practice it. Those still entangled in fame and profit labor in vain. Master Sangyuzi said: "Even if one has not transcended the mundane, as long as the mind remains undisturbed and free from desire, it suffices."

A classic states: "After swallowing *qi* to fullness, close the breath and visualize the mind like flowing water—where the preceding wave departs, the succeeding wave follows." Once fetal breathing is mastered and the joints open while the pores become unobstructed, proceed thus: gently draw *qi* through the nose, imagining it exiting through the four limbs and the pores of the body, flowing outward without return. When the next breath arrives, draw it in without exhaling. The practice lies in gradualness; though it is said to draw without exhaling, the *qi* drawn does not enter the throat but disperses faintly. In this way, internal *qi* does not dissipate.

**Secret Oral Instructions:**
The mouth is the Celestial Pass for internal *qi*, the gateway of the divine mechanism;
The hands are the Human Pass, grasping prosperity and decline;
The feet are the Earthly Pass, the threshold of life.
As the *Huangting Neijing* states.

The nose is the abode of external *qi*.
The nose is the "divine hut," which must be cultivated.
As the *Huangting Neijing* states.

For all *qi*-swallowing practices, choose yang hours—from midnight to dawn—face southeast, sit upright in stillness, knock the teeth three times, rinse the mouth with saliva three times, and swallow. Rub the hands together until the palms grow warm, then wipe the face and eyes. Use the thumbs to rub the kidney meridian seven times, clench the fists, and fill the Celestial Pass with *qi* to a harmonious degree, then close the mouth and swallow. Expand the abdomen, then slowly exhale through the nose, ensuring the "divine hut" is well-regulated. Each expansion and swallow should correspond—one expansion, one swallow, one expansion of the abdomen. While expanding and swallowing, do not open the Celestial Pass, lest external *qi* enter the abdomen and cause illness.

When swallowing *qi*, calm the spirit and steady the mind, swallowing gently. If done hastily, the *qi* in the chest will not disperse, causing pain and congestion. Begin with fifty swallows, gradually increasing to a hundred, two hundred, or three hundred. If other matters arise, reduce to twenty or thirty swallows, practicing while walking or standing as needed, adjusting as circumstances allow. Consistency is paramount; do not skip days. If belching occurs at the outset, expand the abdomen and swallow again, preventing the *qi* from escaping. Master Sangyuzi said: "When primordial *qi* is harmonious, it does not cause harm. If belching arises, how can it be the *qi* of primordial harmony?" Initially, the *qi* pathway may not be fully unobstructed, requiring restraint and accommodation, but one must rely on primordial *qi*. If after two or three attempts the *qi* sea cannot receive it, it may stir the turbid *qi* lingering in the five viscera. In such cases, do not cling to it; if lower abdominal *qi* arises, release it without hesitation.

When expanding and swallowing *qi*, regulate it gently and slowly, ensuring no sound emerges from the Celestial Pass. If swallowing is too rapid, the lower *qi* may become blocked, causing rectal prolapse—beware. With prolonged practice, internal *qi* will flow freely, and one may swallow at any time. Swallow when hungry, cease when full. During each expansion and swallow, visualize the *qi* entering the five viscera and circulating, then exiting through the palms, soles, the three passes of the crown, the nine orifices, and the joints. If illness arises, direct the *qi* to attack the afflicted area—what ailment will not be cured?

To practice *qi*-swallowing for fasting, do not fixate on the number of expansions, swallows, or abdominal exertions; simply keep the abdomen full without overburdening the intestines. When hungry, swallow three to five times, adjusting naturally without seeking external *qi*, which may hinder descent and harm the chest. When *qi* harmonizes, the abdomen may rumble—some mistakenly call this "intestinal emptiness" and believe it harms the body, but this is far from true. It is like thunder and lightning refining yin *qi*, nourishing the hundred vessels in a single flow—truly the profound gate of the Dao.

Though there are many methods of *qi*-swallowing, none surpass the technique of expansion and swallowing for true subtlety. Some, failing to grasp the single breath or unobstructed *qi* flow, empty their minds and forget their bodies, claiming the efficacy of seated forgetfulness. Yet this yields no achievement and often leads to exhaustion.

The *one-expansion swallowing* method fundamentally draws upon the natural primordial *qi*, circulating it through the viscera—once this is achieved, one attains enduring existence and does not die. Why then would one waste time on external thoughts or the absorption of external *qi*? When a person’s *qi* is exhausted, the spirit perishes; when the spirit departs, the body decays. Thus, preserving the primordial *qi* without loss and forming the spiritual embryo are secrets transmitted through esoteric teachings—scholars must not doubt this.

When practicing *qi*-circulation, choose a leisurely moment: expand and swallow ten times, twenty times, or more, filling the intestines, then direct the *qi* through visualization, guiding it into the four limbs. During activity, swallow once and circulate *qi* once, ensuring the hands and feet remain in contact with something. When *qi* flows unimpeded, empty the mind and forget the body, allowing the turbid, steaming *qi* to disperse through the limbs while the essence of *qi* condenses and returns to the *qi* sea. With prolonged practice, the embryo naturally forms, sealing and fortifying the joints, resonating like thunder. When expanding and turning the abdomen, ensure the *qi* flows smoothly and harmoniously.

For *qi*-swallowing and Dao-yin (guiding and pulling), first stretch the hands and feet, bending and extending the body left and right, then focus the mind to guide *qi* into the bones and joints, ensuring continuous, unbroken circulation—this is called *qi*-circulation and Dao-yin. Alternatively, coil and revolve the body, visualizing *qi* dispersing from the joints of the hands and feet. As the ancient scriptures say: "There are methods of *qi*-circulation and Dao-yin, but unless transmitted orally by a master of the supreme Dao, few know them."

When practicing *qi*-circulation, if hungry, swallow *qi* until the abdomen is full before proceeding; if practicing after a meal, do so immediately. Sang Yuzi remarked: "The character for 'full' (*bao*) is likely a miswriting of 'drink' (*yin*)." For cultivators, daily life should not be one of satiety—how could one practice *qi*-circulation only in autumn? If unable to practice *qi*-swallowing and Dao-yin regularly, train during leisure moments, for this is no ordinary endeavor.

When practicing *qi*-swallowing and Dao-yin, retreat to a quiet, secluded chamber, avoiding high rooms exposed to wind. If encountering violent winds, heavy rain, dampness, cold, or heat, or if returning from afar, rest until the body is dry and *qi* harmonized before resuming. If the limbs are often weak, practice Dao-yin frequently; if the skin is plump and radiant, practice it more. By practicing *qi*-swallowing and Dao-yin without missing the proper times, the spirit and *qi* remain clear, the complexion does not age prematurely, flabby flesh does not form, and all illnesses are averted.

Some mistakenly claim that *qi*-swallowing and embryonic breathing are entirely distinct—this is a grave error. The embryo forms within *qi*-swallowing, and breathing arises from the embryo. With prolonged practice, pure *qi* condenses into the embryo while turbid *qi* disperses from it, enabling one to walk through water and fire. Some follow inferior methods, forcibly holding their breath, prizing prolonged respiration—is this not misguided? They fail to realize that the five viscera cannot sustain a single *qi* indefinitely; forcibly closing the gates of the body is hardly the natural intent of the embryonic state. Such efforts only exhaust the body and spirit, yielding no benefit.

Many practitioners of *qi*-swallowing constrict their mouths and noses, forcibly restraining their breath in pursuit of prolonged respiration, unaware that this causes harm. Someone asked: "Both internal and external *qi* emerge from the five viscera—why are inhalation and exhalation treated differently?" Sang Yuzi replied: "To say both *qi* emerge from the five viscera is a gross error. The *qi* of panting and breathing is not the *qi* of the viscera; it merely enters the constructive and protective *qi*, not originating from within. How can it be said to emerge from the five viscera?"

When swallowing internal *qi* and expanding, the stomach sea opens to receive true *qi*, then seals after absorption. Exhaling external *qi* proceeds slowly and naturally, each with its distinct purpose. Forcibly blocking the mouth and nose obstructs *qi* flow, causing stagnation and harm to the five viscera—this is seeking benefit but inviting harm. When healthy, holding the breath is easy, but during illness or weakness, it becomes difficult to control—is this not an extreme mistake? Practicing internal *qi* requires minimal effort yet yields great results; one should diligently cultivate it.

Someone asked: "Why do superior practitioners first perform Dao-yin before exhaling and inhaling, while inferior practitioners do so afterward?" The answer: "Superior practitioners first perform Dao-yin, expelling impure *qi* through movement; inferior practitioners perform Dao-yin afterward, fearing impure *qi* may enter the limbs and fail to disperse. This distinguishes those who succeed in *qi*-circulation and Dao-yin from those who do not." Sang Yuzi remarked: "Superior and inferior refer to the order of practice, reflecting the depth of attainment, not a hierarchy of worth. Could this Dao be practiced by the foolish? Only the wise may fail to achieve it."

The Heavenly Master said: "Inhalation has one method, exhalation has six. Only when the *qi* pathway is mastered can one practice them." The six exhalations are: *chui* (blowing), *hu* (breathing), *xi* (sighing), *xu* (warming), *xu* (dispersing), and *si* (hissing). Sang Yuzi noted: "In some texts, *xu* (warming) is written as *he* (exhaling). The application of the six *qi* differs from other methods." When cold, use *chui* to dispel it; when warm, use *hu* to cool; *xi* dispels wind, *xu* (or *he*) dispels vexation and lower *qi*; *xu* (dispersing) scatters stagnation; *si* resolves heat. Ordinary people often use *hu* and *si*, but Daoist *qi*-circulation avoids *xu* and *si*, as they disrupt prolonged respiration.

Those who attain mastery of the six *qi* ascend as celestial immortals. Sang Yuzi said: "Ordinary people are constantly afflicted by the *qi* of joy, anger, sorrow, and desire, and their mouths never depart from the flavors of spicy, salty, sweet, and sour. If they forcibly restrain prolonged respiration, turbid *qi* will never be fully expelled. Those who attain the Dao are free from thoughts, worries, pursuits, and desires; they embody the vast primordial *qi*—why would they need *xu* or *si*? To them, *xu* and *si* are as insignificant as a broken dike."

After completing *qi*-absorption, immediately visualize the Fire Star of the southern quadrant as a crimson *qi*, vast as a pearl, entering the Celestial Pass and flowing into the viscera, until the entire body is transformed into *qi*. Perform this once daily—this is refining yin with yang, dispelling the Three Worms’ affliction.

Ancient Master Juezi left an oral formula instructing one to imagine fire refining the body into charcoal. Daoist practitioners have debated this, for fire-*qi* is not innate yang essence, and they fear it may harm the spirit—thus it cannot be adopted. The refined method, transmitted in secret by perfected beings, demands focused practice without doubt.

Sang Yuzi said: "This debate reflects the view of Lord Yanling. In the midst of visualization, must one distinguish between the natural and the unnatural? If so, are visualization and contemplation themselves natural? Moreover, in alchemical refinement, fire is also used—then are fire and the Fire Star not both a single entity within heaven and earth? What need is there for discrimination?"

During *qi*-guiding and absorption, clothing and sashes should always be loose; if tight, they obstruct *qi* and cause stagnation in the *qi*-sea. Sang Yuzi said: "Obstruction means constraint, not destruction."

In summer and winter, sleeping quarters and diet should remain warm; avoid sour, salty, oily, or greasy foods, for they harm the five viscera. When the five viscera are harmed, the spirit becomes unsettled. Dog meat and raw fruits are especially forbidden.

**Essential Formula for Gathering *Qi* and Spirit**
The spirit gathers in emptiness.
Sang Yuzi said: "Emptiness is but an image of the formless."

Yet to settle in fullness—fullness meaning essence. The spirit is the knowing within the heart. When settled and desireless, the spirit flourishes and *qi* knows rectitude. At such times, let it be as it will; the longer, the better. Persist without cease, and the body’s *qi* attains tranquility—this is called "rejoicing in Heaven." Heaven is emptiness and spontaneity. Rejoicing in Heaven brings longevity.

The emptiness beyond the body is also Heaven; the emptiness within the body is also Heaven. With long practice, clarity arises therein. Within emptiness, whiteness is born. Through inner awareness, with prolonged practice, essence ascends to merge with luminosity, and luminosity inwardly radiates from essence. Thus one attains the Dao, the Dao responds to virtue, and virtue is perfected. Applied, it becomes benevolence; distributed, it becomes righteousness.

Essence-*qi* emerges from the head by day and rests in the abdomen by night. One should honor the head and value the abdomen, maintain dignity in appearance and reverence within, respond to circumstances without thought, and align only with goodness. This is the substance of spirit and *qi*, uniting as one with the self—called "great compliance." Heaven protects such a one; fortune is boundless, no misfortune befalls.

In essence, the wondrous origin resides in the emptiness within the heart, where the spirit connects upward through its thread; *qi* accumulates in the fullness of the intestines—fullness meaning essence—stored above the anterior water bladder. It must always be warmed and nurtured. Sang Yuzi said: "Warmth is life’s companion, but one must not overheat and lose balance."

In daily life, one should often close the eyes and inwardly gaze upon the *qi*-source, the lower *dantian*. With every act that benefits living beings, joyfully close the eyes, inwardly behold the heart, and give thanks, as if saying: "The spirit and *qi* of my body shine forth from my form, enabling me to attain the Dao." Thus Heaven bestows good fortune.

For Heaven is the numinous spirit of emptiness and *qi*; if one can employ it, the Dao reaches its ultimate. Sang Yuzi said: "What is called Heaven is spontaneity itself, not merely the azure vault!"

**Method for Refining *Qi***
For every session of swallowing *qi*, find a quiet, secluded room in spare moments. Loosen the hair, remove clothing, cover the body, lie supine with limbs outstretched, and do not clench the fists. Use a clean mat, its edges touching the ground. Comb the hair to smooth it, letting it spread upon the mat, then regulate the breath. When the breath is properly attuned, swallow it and hold it until discomfort arises.

Still the mind and banish thoughts, allowing *qi* to move as it will. When discomfort from holding *qi* arises, open the mouth to release it. If the breath is newly expelled and panting is rapid, regulate it seven or eight times until settled. Once settled, refine it again. When time permits, refine it ten times to begin the practice. Fear not that *qi* may fail to circulate and become lodged in the skin, causing illness instead.

With further leisure, refine it again, adding five or six repetitions, increasing to twenty, thirty, or even forty or fifty—there is no fixed limit. What is the standard? As the practice of swallowing *qi* gradually succeeds, the joints open, the pores unblock, and upon refining twenty or thirty times, one feels the body suffused with moisture, or sweat emerges. This is the sign of new efficacy. Cease refining once *qi* flows smoothly; gradual sweating is beneficial. Rest the mind and body calmly, avoiding early rising or exposure to drafts. Like a patient who has just perspired, rest a long while before dressing, then walk slowly, speak little, conserve *qi*, reduce activity, and calm the thoughts. Thus the body becomes light, the eyes bright, the hundred vessels flow, and the four limbs move freely.

As the *Huangting Jing* says:
*A thousand ills dispelled, a hundred maladies healed,*
*Fearless of tigers’ ferocity or sharks’ jaws.*
*Thus aging is averted, and years prolonged.*

In refining *qi*, one may practice at midnight or noon, whenever convenient, when the spirit is clear and refreshed. Sit upright and swallow *qi* in the prescribed sequence, applying oneself diligently without laziness. If drowsiness arises, sleep when inclined; do not force practice while dull or sleepy, lest the mind be disturbed by perverse thoughts. A disturbed mind and chaotic *qi* lose the true Dao.

If newly practicing and lacking proper *qi*, one may feel drowsy, but after drowsiness passes, no torpor remains. Sang Yuzi said: "One must be diligent—never lazy or careless."

It further states that one should follow convenience and not force practice; the subtlety of harmonizing lies precisely here. Thus, diligence does not lie in forcing, but in refining breath and riding its natural flow, as if borne by a chariot—then *qi* circulates.

In refining *qi*, one need not practice daily; if after ten or five days one has leisure and senses obstruction or discomfort in the four limbs, then practice. On ordinary days when no benefit is felt, frequent practice is unnecessary.

Sang Yuzi said: "When yin and yang align with the seasons, no disasters arise." Yet here it speaks of "ordinary days without benefit"—if practiced as described, what harm could there be? But if one does not cease even when no benefit is gained, it may lead to fault. How so? Consider the example of the Flame Emperor: excessive diligence in plowing and weeding may yield double the harvest, yet it may also bring great drought. The same applies to massage.

**The Method of Entrusting *Qi***

For those who cultivate *qi*: when the four limbs are harmonious and the mind free of thoughts, whether sitting or otherwise, let *qi* follow its natural pathways. Regulate the breath until still, entrusting the body as one would a discarded garment—smoothly settled, without sinew or bone, without spirit or consciousness. Let the heart and body be unrestrained, profoundly tranquil.

When entrusting, do not seek to control. Sang Yuzi said: "Without the marks of self or others—how could this apply merely to self and others? All myriad things dissolve."

Then, with spirit settled and *qi* refined, the hundred joints open, sinews and vessels flow freely, and fluids circulate. At this point, one may swallow and hold ten or twenty breaths. With each swallow, remain steadfast and let *qi* move without contention from the mind. After a long while, *qi* will exit through the pores of the skin, no longer expelled through the mouth. Of what remains, scarcely one or two parts in ten linger.

Adjust and regulate, counting to ten, a hundred, or more breaths. If panting arises, gently draw in breath and swallow, then regulate the breath again. After prolonged regulation, the skin, flesh, and joints of the four limbs will feel as if bathed.

At leisure, whether lying supine, on one’s side, standing, or sitting, entrust *qi* and the body to the practice. Progress will come daily: essence fills, *qi* is complete, spirit is at peace, the *po* is settled, the mind is closed to distant thoughts, the Dao is flourishing, and virtue is serene. The Three Worms perish, and the Six Dusts vanish.

The *Huangting Jing* says:
*At ease, with nothing to do, the body is at peace,*
*Dwelling in emptiness within the curtains.*

Simply nurture life through non-action, entrusting body and heart, releasing form and thought, merging with the Dao—then one will recognize extraordinary signs.

The *Huangting Jing* further says:
*Sitting upright in non-action, the hun and po are at peace,*
*In purity, the spirit appears and speaks to me.*

This is the meaning.

**The Method of Holding the Breath**

**The Method of Holding the Breath**

When *qi* is obstructed and the body’s rhythms are disordered, proceed as follows. Those of superior wisdom, with steadfast resolve and far-reaching thought, if they cultivate without the slightest lapse, will settle the spirit and harmonize *qi*, cutting off external illness. Those of middling wisdom, however, may be hindered by public or private affairs, their minds wavering between advance and retreat, or their practice may stray from what is fitting, causing *qi* to stagnate and lose harmony, thereby inviting affliction.

If discomfort arises, enter a quiet chamber, lie supine, and carefully regulate the breath. Extend the hands and feet, each separated by four or five inches. Ensure the bedding is thick and soft; in winter, keep warm with covers. Calm the heart and relax the body, then swallow *qi*. Once swallowed, hold the breath, keeping the mouth and nose still. Focus the mind on the afflicted area, directing intention and visualization to attack it. When *qi* reaches its limit, exhale, then swallow again, holding the breath anew. If panting or urgency arises, regulate the breath with six or seven measured breaths until *qi* is smooth and even, then resume holding the breath, concentrating the mind to attack the affliction. This may be done ten, twenty, thirty, or fifty times, until the troubled area sweats and feels unblocked—then cease. If relief is not yet complete, repeat the practice at dawn or midnight, directing intention to attack the affliction until it is cured.

If the ailment is in the left hand, direct *qi* straight into the left hand; if in the right, into the right; if in the head, into the head. Only when clear results are seen will one know that the heart commands *qi*, and *qi* follows the heart—its response is as swift as the divine.
