**The Supreme Perpetual Secret of the Five Planets and Seven Primes**

**Diagram of the Seven Primes**
The Dao of traversing the Five Planets involves pacing to summon the descent of the Five Planets—Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal—thereby invoking divine clouds and feathered canopies to ascend the steps of the Great Mystery. The method of Master Guxi requires holding the breath to mount the *gang*, traversing back and forth fifteen times. Upon reaching each planet’s position, press the left hand to the heart and silently recite: *"The Five Planets array their radiance..."* Before ascending the *gang*, first visualize the essence of the Five Planets within the Five Viscera. After each pacing of the *gang*, perform the prescribed gestures. Practicing this for fourteen years, one may ascend in broad daylight upon a dragon’s flight. The essential Dao lies upon this silk scroll—such is its diagram.

The Perfected of the Supreme Dao paces the path of the Five Planets to induce their descent into the chamber. Holding the breath to mount the *gang*, one must first invoke the names of the Five Planetary Sovereign Ladies. Only after this may one cross the *gang* and tread upon the stars. This means that upon first mounting the *gang*, one pauses to call their names; once the invocation is complete, one then crosses the *gang* and treads upon the stars. If, upon reaching each planet, one repeats the invocation of the name and style of the planet’s sovereign, it is all the more excellent. If the practice becomes too arduous, one may simply follow the old method. In ancient times, Master Yusha, Beilizi, and the Elder of Changling all ascended to heaven by this method, never shirking its difficulties.

This is what is meant by "cultivating life." Merchants toil ceaselessly—how could they fear hardship? Their sole aim is profit. If seekers of the Dao were as single-minded as merchants, how could they fail to attain immortality? Yet most beginners claim devotion and diligence, only to grow lax afterward, like a cart on the verge of collapse whose every joint loosens, or an ox burdened with a heavy load struggling on a long journey. Such are the afflictions of the unaccomplished, and the amusement of the attained. All such matters are of this kind. If one’s heart is refined as an inner mirror, it will resonate with the divine, and spiritual beings may awaken one’s ignorance, bearing the chariot of the stars and light.

**Arrangement of the Five Planets Diagram**
It should always face south, with Venus positioned in the west and Jupiter in the east, following the prescribed order. The reason is that the Five Planets conceal and reveal themselves unpredictably, unlike the Northern Dipper, whose fixed form eternally determines its position in the five directions. Thus, one cannot follow the planets’ shifting locations.

The Perfected of Primordial Simplicity said: When stepping the Five Planets, before first mounting the stellar *gang* and after descending from it, one must first visualize the essence of the Five Planets within the Five Viscera. Upon completing the visualization, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly recite the incantation:
*"The Five Celestial Bodies array in splendor, illuminating the five directions.
The Water Star averts calamity; the Wood Star brings prosperity.
The Radiant Deluder dispels misfortune; Venus repels warfare.
Saturn guards the four quarters; I attain favorable augury.
My name is inscribed on jade tablets, recorded in the Emperor’s chamber.
Riding the whirlwind and fanning the light, I soar through the Great Void,
Emerging and entering the unseen, roaming and feasting in the ten directions.
Five-colored clouds cover me; I summon spirits and command the winds,
Enlisting the myriad numina, ascending as an Immortal Duke."*
This is recited while facing the *gang* with a focused mind, during the moments of ascent and descent.

**The Five Planetary Sovereigns and Their Consorts**
- **Eastern Jupiter, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Chenglan, style: Qingning. His Lady: Baorong, style: Feiyun.
- **Southern Mars, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Weiting, style: Sanrong. His Lady: Huaping, style: Xuanluo.
- **Central Saturn, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Zanglu, style: Danyan. His Lady: Kongyao, style: Feixian.
- **Western Venus, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Liaoling, style: Zhenxun. His Lady: Souying, style: Lingen.
- **Northern Mercury, True Sovereign Lord:** Name: Xianxuan, style: Jingyuan. His Lady: Xuanhua, style: Long’e.

Holding the breath to mount the *gang*, first invoke the names of the Five Planets and their Ladies. Only then cross the *gang* and tread upon the stars. Begin by lifting both feet onto Venus, then ascend from Venus to Saturn, from Saturn to Mars, from Mars to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Mercury, and from Mercury return to tread upon Venus. After three complete cycles, hold the breath again to mount the *gang*, following the old method of traversing back and forth fifteen times. Upon reaching each planet’s position, invoke the names of the Sovereign Lord and his Lady, press the left hand to the heart, and recite the incantation.

The text states: When performing the ritual, one should face north while holding the concealed script, for beginners of the true and wondrous Dao, unfamiliar with the subtleties of stellar positions and the Dipper’s directional shifts, must face north while holding the text to gradually grasp its meaning. Once the script’s intent is understood and the stars’ movements with the seasons are recognized, one should naturally follow the Dipper’s orientation, pacing and visualizing accordingly. Thus, there is no fixed direction, and one need not always face north. Facing north is solely for beginners. This principle may be extended by analogy—no further questions are needed.

The Three Eights and the Twenty-Four Spirits may be recited in sequence, or all three Eights may be visualized at once. Alternatively, one may visualize the Upper Radiance at dawn, the Middle Radiance at noon, and the Lower Radiance at midnight—this depends on the practitioner’s intention. If one retreats to a secluded cliff, free from worldly affairs, and inwardly focuses on the Spirit Gate while absorbing the morning qi of the true, one may visualize the Three Eights at dawn, then reinforce each of the three periods with an additional visualization—this is even more excellent. However, worldly affairs often hinder consistent practice, and irregularity diminishes its benefits. In ancient times, the Perfected Lord of Xicheng and the Supreme Immortal of Tongwu both followed this Dao.

From the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing* it is said: Those who do not visualize the Twenty-Four Spirits or know the names of the Three Eights Radiance cannot be counted among the people of Great Peace, nor can they become ministers to the Later Sage.

The Primordial Perfected One of Great Simplicity said: If one wishes to transform and divide the body, conceal oneself in the eight directions, hide the form and conceal the radiance, enter emptiness and create darkness, summon the myriad things, and pursue and capture all evils, one must constantly cultivate the refined contemplation of the *Kongchang* (Space-Constant). This practice should also be performed on the Eight Seasonal Nodes and the Six Ding Days. If these coincide with double days, the practice may be repeated. Alternatively, one may perform it after pacing the *gang* (cosmic steps)—this is also excellent. Such is the Dao of concealment and disappearance.

Above the *Kongchang* *gang*, there are twenty-five black dots:

1. The first dot is named *Jiuchang* (Nine-Constant), where one may reside to escape form.
2. The second dot is named *Yuchang* (Nurturing-Constant), where one may transform the body into the myriad grasses and trees.
3. The third dot is named *Maochang* (Mao-Constant), where one may transform the body into the myriad mountains and hills.
4. The fourth dot is named *Liuchang* (Flowing-Constant), where one may escape *qi* and transform *qi*.
5. The fifth dot is named *Xingchang* (Moving-Constant), where one may escape fire.
6. The sixth dot is named *Shangchang* (Upper-Constant), where one appears to others as if between heaven and earth.
7. The seventh dot is named *Tianchang* (Heaven-Constant), where one may escape fire.
8. The eighth dot is named *Xuanchang* (Mystery-Constant), where one may escape water.
9. The ninth dot is named *Sanchang* (Three-Constant), where one may escape weapons.
10. The tenth dot is named *Chenchang* (Chen-Constant), where one may escape death.
11. The eleventh dot is the central *Zhuchu* (Prayer-Point) of *Kongchang*, representing the heart.
12. The twelfth dot is named *Hechang* (River-Constant), where one may transform into water and fire.
13. The thirteenth dot is named *Yuanchang* (Origin-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into grasses and trees.
14. The fourteenth dot is named *Guchang* (Ancient-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into birds at will.
15. The fifteenth dot is named *Sichang* (Si-Constant), where one may transform the body into birds and beasts.
16. The sixteenth dot is named *Jiuchang* (Nine-Constant), where one may escape misfortune.
17. The seventeenth dot is named *Shichang* (World-Constant), where one may escape spirits.
18. The eighteenth dot is named *Mingchang* (Bright-Constant), where one may escape water and become earth.
19. The nineteenth dot is named *Yuchang* (Jade-Constant), where one may dwell and become a tiger.
20. The twentieth dot is named *Fachang* (Dharma-Constant), where one may transform the body into a thousand forms.
21. The twenty-first dot is named *Yinchang* (Yin-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into a dragon.
22. The twenty-second dot is named *Huangchang* (Yellow-Constant), where one may transform into a woman and divide the body into a hundred forms.
23. The twenty-third dot is named *Dingchang* (Stable-Constant), where one may dwell and transform into the myriad things at will.
24. The twenty-fourth dot is named *Feichang* (Flying-Constant), where one may escape the body as the six domestic animals, unseen by others.
25. The twenty-fifth dot is named *Liuchang* (Six-Constant), where one may escape ghosts that kill people.

The method of pacing the *Kongchang* *gang* begins at *Jiuchang*. Each time one reaches the eleventh central star, one should softly recite the prayer:
*"The Four Brightnesses of the Upper Origin, the radiance of sun and moon, flowing light resplendent, the twenty-five stars, pour liquid to congeal the hun-soul, spirit-water disperses form, washes away filth and purifies, penetrating the dark and obscure. Jade tablets and blue registers, tall and inscribed with names, stone mirrors and jade horses, revealing the forms of ghosts. Conceal the body in the numinous weft, ascend to pay homage to the Upper Clarity."*

Within the first star of the Dipper lies the Inner Consort of the *Taiqing* (Great Clarity) Center, the Transformer, Concealer, and Escapist, named *Kongchang Fayuan*, with the style *Xin Zhengpi*. She wears a yellow brocade cloak and a cinnabar-green flying skirt.

The second star is the Inner Concubine of Embryo Transformation and Form Protection, named *Kongchang Sanci*, with the style *Luo Zhuying*. She wears a blue brocade cloak and a green-feathered flying skirt.

The third true star is the Upper Origin Primordial Mother of the Six Escapes and Seven Concealments, named *Kongchang Lingyi*, with the style *Chong Shuangzhao*. She wears a blue brocade cloak and an embroidered feathered skirt.

The fourth star of the *Niu* (Handle) is the Inner Consort of Concealed Radiance and Hidden Light, named *Kongchang Qilie*, with the style *Heng Danpan*. She is draped in a purple brocade robe and wears a yellow-feathered skirt.

The fifth star of the *Gang* (Net) is the Great Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Body and Changer of Radiance, named *Kongchang Yushu*, with the style *Chou Qiulan*. She wears a vermilion brocade cloak and a purple-green flying skirt.

The sixth star of the *Ji* (Record) is the Middle Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Concealer of Traces and Disperser of Images, named *Kongchang Qijing*, with the style *Bao Dingling*. She wears a vermilion brocade cloak and a blue-embroidered flying skirt.

The seventh star of the *Guan* (Pass) is the Young Maiden of the Dipper’s Center, the Divider of Radiance into Myriad Forms, named *Kongchang Yumo*, with the style *Tian Fanshu*. She wears a cinnabar brocade cloak and a blue-feathered skirt.

The eighth star of the *Di* (Emperor) is the Left Consort of the High Sovereign of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Sun, Moon, Water, and Fire, named *Kongchang Shi Qizhu*, with the style *Luo Maohua*. She wears a purple brocade cloak and an embroidered feathered skirt.

The ninth star of the *Zun* (Honored) is the Right Consort of the High Sovereign of the Dipper’s Center, the Transformer of Metal, Stone, Mountains, and Rivers, named *Kongchang Ai Shangtiao*, with the style *Ling Yu Xuan*. She wears a green brocade cloak and a kingfisher-feathered skirt.

All nine wear their hair in cloud-like topknots.

To ascend the *gang* while holding the breath, one must first call the names of the nine stellar Inner Consorts, then step upon the stars.

The *Tai Bai* (Venus) star lies horizontally, its rays scattering like the edges of a blade. One then exhales the *Three Separates* and *Two Golden Flowers*, causing the *Tu Fei* (Chart Boiling) to fill the *Zeng Yu* (Augmented Realm) and the *Liu Chang* (Flowing Field). The *Xuan Shi* (Mysterious Chamber) is the bright and dense *Tai Bai* star. It moves horizontally, its rays scattering like the edges of a blade, spreading across the nine heavens.

The Perfected One, visualizing this star with its seven rays, constantly exhales the three western rays and draws in the two southern rays. Thus, the golden radiance pierces the eyes, the chart becomes luminous and seething, penetrating the entire body. Once penetrated, one may enter the stellar deities’ *Zeng Yu* and *Liu Yang* palaces. Within these palaces lies the *Xuan Shi*, where one may wander in tranquility and be revered as a Perfected One. These are the names of the chambers within the *Tai Bai* star.

Regarding the practice of the *Tai Shang Yin Shu* (Supreme Perfected’s Concealment Writ), the scripture states: When performing the practice, one should face north while holding the *Yin Shu* (Concealment Writ). This is because beginners in the true and wondrous have not yet ventured into the subtle and distant, do not understand the orientation of stellar positions, nor recognize the Dipper’s directional alignment. Thus, they should face north while holding the writ, gradually seeking understanding. Once the meaning of the writ is grasped and the turning of the stars is recognized with the seasons, one may naturally follow the Dipper’s alignment and pace accordingly. In this way, there is no fixed direction, and one need not always face north. Facing north is merely for beginners.

Perhaps this can be understood by analogy, and no further questions are needed.

The Perfected One of the Supreme practices the pacing of the Five Stars’ Dao to summon the descent of the Five Stars into their chambers. While holding the breath to ascend the *gang*, one must first call the names of the Five Stellar Lords and Royal Consorts, then step over the *gang* and tread upon the stars.

To ascend the *gang*, one should pause immediately upon reaching it and call the names, then step over the *gang* and tread upon the stars. If, upon arriving at each star, one again focuses the mind and calls the name of that star’s position, it is even better. Should this prove too cumbersome for regular practice, one may proceed as before.

In ancient times, Master Yushai, Beili Zisheng, and the Elder of Changling all followed this method to ascend to heaven, undeterred by its complexity. This is akin to the way of managing life. Do merchants, in their eagerness for profit, shrink from peril or hardship? Their sole aim is wealth. If seekers of the Dao were as single-minded as merchants, what could prevent them from attaining immortality?

Yet beginners often claim devotion and diligence, only to grow lax and negligent thereafter—like a cart on the verge of collapse, its joints scattering, or an ox burdened with weight, its hooves faltering on a long journey. Such are the failings of late learners, the very ones whom the accomplished mock.

If one can inwardly refine the mind as a mirror, this will stir the numinous. Then, divine beings may awaken one’s obscurity and bear one aloft in the chariot of celestial radiance.

When arranging the diagram of the Five Stars, one should face south, with Venus positioned in the west and Jupiter in the east, proceeding accordingly. The reason for this is that the Five Stars conceal and reveal themselves unpredictably, shifting without constancy. Unlike the Northern Dipper, which maintains its fixed form and determines the positions of the five directions, one cannot follow the stars’ transient locations.

The Three Eights, combined with the Twenty-Four Spirits, may be recited in sequence. Alternatively, one may invoke all Three Eights at once, or store the Upper Radiance at dawn, the Middle Radiance at noon, and the Lower Radiance at midnight—this is left to the practitioner’s intention.

If one retreats to a secluded cliff, cutting off worldly affairs, and inwardly focuses on the Spirit Gate while gathering the morning’s true qi, then at dawn one may invoke all Three Eights at once, and in each of the three periods, further store one radiance—this would be even better. However, worldly matters often make such consistent practice difficult. Infrequent practice yields only meager benefits.

In ancient times, the Perfected Lord of Xicheng and the Supreme One of Tongwu both followed this Dao.

As the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing* states: "Those who do not store the Twenty-Four Spirits or know the names of the Three Eights cannot be counted among the people of Great Peace, nor can they serve as ministers to the Later Sage. When receiving the *Dadong Zhenjing*, one should also receive the methods of the Supreme Dao. One’s robes and headscarves must not be lent to others, nor should one share vessels, carriages, clothing, beds, or sleeping quarters. This is to block the paths of filth and impurity and guard against the intrusion of perverse winds."

This is easily practiced, yet deemed difficult—such is the way of those whose faith in the Dao is not sincere, who aspire to fly yet sink instead.

For those cultivating the Grotto Chamber and pacing the Seven Origins, upon first rising from sleep, when first venturing out, and after meals, one should softly recite the incantation:

*"Five August Ones, Five Penetrations,
Jade Script of the Grotto Chamber,
Return to the Hidden Dao,
Expand the Seven Dawns.
The Mysterious Father gives birth to the hun-soul,
Transforming the One into spirit.
The Mysterious Mother gives birth to the po-soul,
Transforming the Two into body.
The Duke’s Son gathers my sinews and bones,
White Prime governs my essence and qi.
Long life and enduring vision,
Ascend as an immortal to the Ten Heavens."*

This must be recited without letting the ears hear the sound. This is the Supreme One’s hidden incantation, used to dispel perverse qi and summon spirit, enabling transformation, division of form, concealment in the eight directions, vanishing of the body, hiding of radiance, entering emptiness, and traversing darkness. It allows one to summon the myriad things, hunt down all treacheries, and cultivate the refined contemplation of the Void and Constancy.

One should pace the Void and Constancy *gang* once every seven days, as one would pace the Seven Origins. This may be done at midnight, noon, or dawn, within a quiet chamber. It should also be practiced on the eight solar terms and the six Ding days. If these coincide with doubled days, one may perform it twice, or pace it again after completing the steps—this is also good. This is the essential Dao of concealment and vanishing.

Upon the Void and Constancy *gang* are twenty-five black dots:

1. The first dot is the earthly name *Nine Constancies*, where one may escape form. Its taboo name is *Yingyu*, and its style is *Tongjiao*.

10. The tenth dot is named *Chenchang*, where one may escape death. Its name is *Neiyi*, and its style is *Yiwei*.
11. The eleventh dot is the central incantation point of the Void and Constancy, the heart. Its name is *Dangyang*, and its style is *Yuanyuan*.
12. The twelfth dot is named *Hechang*, where one may transform into water and fire. Its name is *Liujing*, and its style is *Qizhuan*.
13. The thirteenth dot is named *Yuanchang*, where one may dwell and transform into grasses and trees. Its name is *Nanzhi*, and its style is *Jingji*.
14. The fourteenth dot is named *Guchang*, where one may dwell and transform into birds at will. Its name is *Dongsheng*, and its style is *Weitong*.
15. The fifteenth dot is named *Jichang*, where one may transform the form into birds and beasts. Its name is *Lixing*, and its style is *Houhua*.
16. The sixteenth dot is named *Jiuchang*, where one may escape misfortune. Its name is *Qingbao*, and its style is *Shangyang*.
17. The seventeenth dot is named *Shichang*, where one may escape spirits. Its name is *Cangyuan*, and its style is *Changming*.
18. The eighteenth dot is named *Mingchang*, where one may escape water and become earth. Its name is *Biyuan*, and its style is *Dongsheng*.
19. The nineteenth dot is named *Yuchang*, where one may dwell and become a tiger. Its name is *Guiqing*, and its style is *Yuyang*.
20. The twentieth dot is named *Fachang*, where one may transform into a thousand bodies.

21. The twenty-first dot is named *Lǜhuà*, where one may transform into a dragon. Its name is *Míng’ài*, and its style is *Xuántōng*, with the courtesy name *Zǐyuán*.
22. The twenty-second dot is named *Huángcháng*, where one may transform into a woman and divide the form into a hundred. Its name is *Rìkōng*, and its style is *Dōngyí*.
23. The twenty-third dot is named *Dìngcháng*, where one may dwell and transform into all things at will. Its name is *Yǐnyáng*, and its style is *Fūguāng*.
24. The twenty-fourth dot is named *Fēicháng*, where one may escape the body as the six livestock while remaining unseen by others. Its name is *Shàngyuán*, and its style is *Cángguāng*.
25. The twenty-fifth dot is named *Liùcháng*, where one may escape from ghosts and those who would kill. Its name is *Zhōngbiàn*, and its style is *Fēntú*.

When pacing the Five Stars, before ascending the stellar *gāng* and after descending from it, first visualize the essence of the Five Stars within one’s five viscera. Upon completion, click the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and softly recite the invocation:
*"The Five Celestial Bodies array in splendor, illuminating the five directions.
The Water Star averts calamity; the Wood Star brings prosperity.
The Radiant Star dispels misfortune; the Great White repels weapons.
The Quelling Star guards the four quarters; I attain favorable divination.
My name is inscribed on the Jade Tablet, recorded in the Celestial Chamber.
Riding the whirlwind and fanning the light, I soar through the Great Void,
Emerging and entering the unseen, roaming and feasting in the ten directions.
Five clouds cover me; I summon spirits and command the winds,
Enlisting the myriad numina, ascending as an immortal lord."*

Conclude by focusing the mind toward the *gāng* and reciting the invocation at the moment of ascent and descent. When holding the breath to ascend the *gāng*, first call the names of the Five Stars and their consorts, then step over the *gāng* and tread upon the stars. Begin by raising both feet onto the Great White Star, then proceed from the White to the Quelling Star, from the Quelling to the Fire Star, from the Fire to the Wood Star, from the Wood to the Water Star, and from the Water back to the Great White. Repeat this thrice, then hold the breath again to ascend the *gāng*, following the established path fifteen times. At each star, call the names of the August Lords and their consorts, press the left hand to the heart, and recite the invocation.

**First, the Great White Star:**
Yellow brocade mantle, vermilion and azure flying skirts.

**Second, the Origin Star:**
Azure brocade mantle, green feathered flying skirts.

**Third, the True Star:**
Azure brocade mantle, embroidered feathered ceremonial skirts.

For the method of pacing the *Kōngcháng* Dao, begin at the ninth dot, *Jiǔcháng*. Each time you reach the eleventh dot, the Central Star, softly recite the invocation:
*"The Four Luminaries of the Upper Origin, the radiance of sun and moon,
Streaming light resplendent, the Twenty-Five Stars,
Infuse the elixir and congeal the soul, divine water disperses form.
Washing away defilement and refining purity, penetrating the dark and unseen,
Names inscribed on Jade Tablets and Azure Records, carved in the High Pavilion.

**The Flying Pacing of the *Kōngcháng* Chart**
**Essential Instructions for Cultivating the *Kōngcháng* Method**

Whenever one wishes to pace the *Kōngcháng*, fly the *gāng*, escape form, transform appearance, and ascend to the Jade Clarity, perform the practice seven times in a month. On the eight solar nodes and the six *Dīng* days, follow this method. On the appointed day, enter the chamber, burn incense on both sides, spread out the chart and mat, face south, click the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize the Five Stars shining brilliantly in the five directions. After a long while, see them descend and enter the five viscera: the Metal Star into the Lung Palace, the Earth Star into the Spleen Palace, the Fire Star into the Heart Palace, the Wood Star into the Liver Palace, and the Water Star into the Kidney Palace. The Five Stars radiate light, illuminating the five viscera, and the body feels warm. Then visualize the August Consorts of the Five Stars and the names and attire of the Twenty-Five *Kōngcháng* August Lords and Morning Lords, each in their respective directions. When all is complete, softly recite the invocation:
*"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, the primal qi of the Four Origins,
Mysterious essence flowing and shining, illuminating the Five Luminaries.
Within are the Five Stars, the numinous lords and consorts,
The Twenty-Five Dots, the *Kōngcháng* Celestial Worthies,
Transforming and dividing forms a thousandfold and myriadfold,
Descending into the five viscera, coalescing into Jade Immortals.
Refining my seven *pò*, nurturing my three *hún*,
I raise my form to ascend, flying into the Dipper’s Gate,
Roaming and playing in the Upper Capital, the Five Stars gathering in throngs.
Today, in this mysterious celebration, I request that all be as recited."*

Draw in the starlight and qi, swallowing twenty-five times, then rise to pace the *gāng*. Stand with feet together on the Great White Star, hold the breath for seven cycles, face west, and softly recite:
*"The Western Seven Gates, white qi flying in radiance,
Above is the Luminous Emperor, the August Lord of Lesser Yang,
Whose name is Liáolíng, clad in cloud-garments,
Resplendent essence flowing, shining in the Metal Palace,
Called the Fifth Dot, the ancestral *Kōngcháng*,
Seated on talismans and bearing standards, summoning yin and seizing yang,
Transforming water and fire, seventy-four directions,
Enabling my flying pace, concealing my form and entering the void,
Driving the white chariot, soaring through cloud-chambers,
Enduring through heaven and earth, eternally enjoying boundless years."*

Look up and swallow seven breaths. Stand with feet together on the Quelling Star, hold the breath for twelve cycles, face southwest, look up to the heavens, and softly recite:
*"The Central August Four Qi, overseeing the Eight Numinous Ones,
Jade Terrace and Purple Chamber, where divine dots give birth to transformations.
Within is the Origin Star, the Five Emperors’ hidden names,
Called Cángduì, pacifying the Yellow Court,
Clad in flying cloud sashes, crowned with flowered essence,
Holding talismans and wielding battle-axes, resplendent with falling fire bells,
Enabling my flying pace, revealing to me the divine names,
Descending into the Spleen Palace, pacifying spirit and settling essence,
Ascending to heaven and entering the clouds, concealing form and escaping shape,
Transforming the myriad things, roaming the Jade Clarity,
Attaining union with the August Lord, together preserving the Great Luminosity."*

Draw in the starlight and swallow twelve times to conclude. Stand with feet together upon the Sparkling Deluder Star, hold the breath for three cycles, and softly recite toward the south:

*"Three Gates radiate brilliance, cinnabar light flows with essence,
Mysterious qi surges and billows, shining resplendent in the southern darkness.
Above dwells the Crimson August One, luminous spirit of the Five Constants,
Whose hidden name is Wéinìng, clad in brocade of refined essence,
Head crowned with a treasure diadem, waist hung with jade and tinkling bells,
Moving in and out of the Vermilion Palace, guarding the Crimson-Walled Forbidden Chambers.
Preserve and record my life, inscribe my birth in the Southern Palace,
Enable my flying pace, transform my qi and conceal my form.
When the day is auspicious and the Dao is practiced, all under heaven grows solemn and clear.
My heart-spirit binds to the real, my Five Hun souls shine with luminous clarity,
Aligning with the Three Qi, merging with the radiance of the Fire Star."*

Draw in the starlight and swallow three times to conclude. Stand with feet together upon the Jupiter Star, hold the breath for nine cycles, and softly recite toward the east:

*"Eastern Nine Qi, Azure Heaven’s Jade Gate,
Within dwells the Azure Dawn, Lord of the Mystic Heights,
Flowing azure surges and billows—this is the Celestial Hun-soul,
Whose hidden name is Chénglán, exalted by heaven and earth,
Body robed in phoenix garments, striped with tiger-skirt patterns,
Transforming to five luminous points, shifting into nine dawns of radiance.
Head crowned with azure essence, a jade diadem spanning the heavens,
