**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Golden Writ and Jade Characters**
*Transmitted by the Azure Lad of the Square Cauldron Palace*

Visualize the true stars above your head while contemplating the deities of the Grotto Chamber. Let your right toe point to the Emperor Star and your left toe to the Venerable Star. When settling into visualization, slightly bend your left foot to align with the star. Grasp the Northern Terrace with your left hand and hold the Pivot Root with your right. Silently recite the incantation, then lie within the Northern Dipper. Practicing this for nine years eliminates death and ascends to life, and your name is inscribed in the Square Cauldron Prefecture. Practicing for eighteen years, the Nine Essences descend, and cloud chariots appear to welcome you.

The Pivot Root is the essence-name of the Pivot Star. The Northern Terrace is the essence-name of the Origin Star. Resting within the Nine Stars of the Dipper, with the heart’s aspiration to become a flying immortal and ascend to the Realized, you are sheltered beneath the Florid Canopy, ascending by cloud at dawn.

The following twenty-four characters were inscribed by the Most High on the eastern wall of the Jade Chamber of Mount Emei. The script is ancient and indecipherable; it is now revealed here.

The Azure Lad said: When constructing the Grotto Chamber, the face should have three yang aspects, with the two *si* (巳) positions intersecting. The nose is the Celestial Mountain; gaze upward toward the Bright Hall. The Spirit Pass is the Purple Gate, through which the Grotto Chamber is seen—square and circular, walls standing upright, one *cun* in perfect measure. Quietly visualize the essence of the Dipper, allowing it to settle within. It illuminates and shelters the Red Child and the Three Kings of No-Flower, thereby achieving flight as an immortal. Mounting the dark dragon-drawn carriage, you ascend to the Florid Dawn, commanding jade maidens and jade lads. The essential Dao is complete—practice it in secrecy.

The Azure Canopy Purple Lad of the Square Cauldron Palace, having first practiced the Grotto Chamber method, reposed in the Florid Dawn, rising and resting within the Nine Essences, binding the hun and po souls to the Northern Dipper. Thus, he is titled the True Person Within the Dipper.

Former masters received *The Grotto Chamber Scripture* from the Supreme Clarity Purple Essence Lord and the August Primordial Purple Void Lord. The Azure Spirit Yang Peace Lord transmitted it to the Central Yellow Venerable Lord, and the Three Heavens Supreme Unity Origin Lord, who then established the Supreme Mystery Master’s Immortal Prefecture. They ordained the Golden Writ and inscribed the Jade Characters, naming it *The Grotto Chamber Scripture*. The Jade Sovereign entrusted it to the later sages, Lords Li and Peng, to bestow upon those whose bone destiny aligned with immortality. Practicing it, their names were listed in the Origin Register, death was eradicated, and life was transcended. They flew as divine immortals, appointed as ministers to the later sages, Lords Li and Peng.

Thereupon, the two lords presented one copy of the *Golden Writ Grotto Chamber Scripture* to the perfected immortals of the Western Mystery Palace and the Terrace of the Square Cauldron, to transmit to those destined to achieve immortality in the future. They also presented one copy of the *Jade Characters Grotto Chamber Scripture* to the Square Cauldron Palace and the Immortal Capital Prefecture of the Dark Continent, to instruct those whose predestined bone names aligned with the Dao.

The two later sage lords rode the chariot of the Great Void, drifting through the gates of the Ten Heavens and Nine Grottoes. When the appointed time arrives, they will govern as emperors, administering the true offices of the Spirit Terrace and teaching the multitudes in the era of Great Peace.

The two lords, perceiving the past and examining the paths of the myriad destinies, soar through the empty mystery, discerning who among the Dao-seeking scholars may succeed or fail. If one’s heart is sincere and will resolute, steadfastly yearning for the divine and true, unwavering throughout the year, with a spirit unshaken, and if the numinous mirror reveals a bone form already inscribed in the Jade Record of Immortal Names, then the two lords will concur, and only then may one obtain this scripture.

Those who receive and practice this scripture have a predestined bone destiny, and their names have already been recorded in the Register of the Mysterious Pavilion, ensuring life and eradicating death. The two later sage lords often conceal their traces and hide their true form, never transmitting it themselves. They allow karmic conditions to guide the way, enabling those who encounter it to obtain this divine scripture.

Some copies may emerge among the common or the impure, but though such people may possess this scripture, they do not practice it. Thus, they are merely used as agents of the hidden teachings. Therefore, those whose bone destiny aligns with immortality and who obtain this scripture often do so through past causes, leading them to acquire it. Some may encounter true immortals who, having fulfilled their allotted time and reached the year of transmission, carefully examine their bone form before bestowing it upon them.

You must diligently aspire to flight as an immortal, reciting the incantation in your heart whether sitting or rising. Practicing over time, you will naturally obtain this scripture. Do not dismiss it because it emerged from humble origins, nor scorn its text or belittle its transmission. All of this is the mysterious mandate of the later sages, secretly arranged and precisely aligned with those destined for the Dao—hence its bestowal upon you.

What we now revere and uphold is in accordance with the intent of the two lords, thus we respect even the humble. Just as in the world, those who honor their teachers and ancestors do so with reverence, though their teachers may not all be lofty sages. It is the distant veneration of their root and heart.

Seclude yourself for seven days before receiving this scripture. Practice with strict discipline, upholding and following it. Do not mingle with the impure or the defiled. Practice in secrecy, ensuring no one perceives it. Outwardly, conform to the world; inwardly, be radiant and discerning. Only then may you be spoken to of the affairs of the Grotto Chamber.

This is the essential secret of the True Mother of Tortoise Mountain, commanded by the Lord of the Western City.

The twenty-eight constellations are suspended above the Florid Dawn, governing the deities of the four directions. According to the statutes of the Four Poles and Four Perfected, and the covenant of the *Supreme Clarity Golden Writ and Jade Characters of the Grotto Chamber*, one must swear an oath upon torn silk, pledging not to recklessly divulge it.

Upon receiving this scripture, present thirty-two feet of azure silk to the one who bestows it. The number eight corresponds to each of the four directions, totaling thirty-two feet. The recipient of the scripture shall then divide the silk to offer to their master, as per the oral instructions.

If one first receives this from a true immortal whose traces are utterly untraceable, then the portion of silk to be divided cannot be delivered, and what one receives becomes an offering dispersed to meet the needs of the Dao. It must not be used for miscellaneous external offerings.

The August Sovereign’s covenant employs gold and azure tablets—what is called the "alliance azure silk." The *Nine White Scriptures* state: "When you receive the gold and azure, your name has already been inscribed above. Guard it carefully and do not scatter it elsewhere in pursuit of wealth or glory. This is its meaning."

Procure this gold silk with only the finest quality; do not carelessly combine it merely to fulfill an obligation. The Mysterious Center will also examine your sincerity.

All these are the scriptures of the Most High, each with fixed statutes. Initially, one may transmit it once every hundred years; within seven hundred years, it may be transmitted three times. Beyond this, it may not be further disseminated. If transmitted to an unworthy recipient or recklessly bestowed beyond the limit, it constitutes a breach of secrecy. For such a breach, one’s grandparents and parents will be examined by the Three Officials, and upon death, the offender will suffer celestial punishment and become a lowly ghost.

The Lord of the Western City states: "If within a hundred years there are two worthy recipients, transmission may be permitted, but the oath must still adhere to the three transmissions within seven hundred years."

The Dipper stars are the purple canopy of the Great Ultimate, the numinous grove of the Mysterious Perfected, the divine seat of the Nine August Ones, and the banquet chamber of the Heavenly Worthy. By practicing this Dao, one’s position becomes that of an immortal patriarch, riding the eight-scened dragon to ascend to the Grand Tenuity, entering and exiting the Purple Court, resting in the Northern Dipper, soaring through the Grotto Passes, gazing upon the Mysterious Canopy, inhaling the Florid Dawn, and mounting the flowing radiance to reach the Three Mysteries, entering and exiting the Purple Chamber, roaming the Great Primordium. One’s name is inscribed in the Golden Pavilion, and one is ranked among the Perfected.

At night before sleeping, first visualize the Dipper stars above your bed, drawing their image and contemplating them as described above. Let your head align with the Nine Ultimates, allowing true qi to enter the Mud Pill, and your feet tread upon the two stars of the August Emperor. Constantly focus your mind on ascending as an immortal, so that the Lofty One restrains your seven po, and the Grand Tenuity governs your three hun. Grasp the Northern Terrace with your left hand and hold the Pivot Root with your right.

After practicing this for eighteen years, your complexion will revert to that of an infant. One day, the essence of the nine stars will suddenly transform into the Nine Elder Lords of the Supreme Emperor, all descending together to welcome you with dark radiance and flying dragons. They will present you with the true bell, riding the eight-chariot jade carriage adorned with purple feathers and a florid canopy, led by immortal officials. Before you, phoenixes will cry; behind you, celestial hooks will sound. Clad in emerald robes and azure sashes, you will ascend at dawn, attended by jade lads and jade maidens bearing your towels.

Before sleeping each night, secretly knock your teeth thirty-seven times and swallow saliva thirty-seven times, then silently pray: "Nine stars of great essence, True Lord of the Northern Culmen, augment my vital embryo, strengthen my three hun. Draw the sun’s splendor from the left, restrain the moon’s essence from the right. The Yellow Radiance of the central dawn, the Yellow Perfected of the Primordial Void—enable me to ascend as an immortal, to mount the purple mist. May the divine tiger and jade talisman ever guard my Gate of Life. May the myriad evils submit to the law, and may I receive refinement from the Lord of the Dipper."

At dawn upon rising, secretly knock your teeth twenty-seven times and swallow saliva twenty-seven times, then silently pray: "Primordial One of Heaven, seven youths within the Dipper, purple essence of the Upper Clarity, dwelling within my body. Florid Dawn and purple canopy, Mysterious Palace of the Great Simplicity. The numinous qi of the Later Sage descends into the Grotto Chamber—enable me to ascend as an immortal, to traverse the Golden Hall of the Great Ultimate."

When first visualizing the stars at night, always silently recite their names before contemplating them. The prayer is as follows:

"First, the essence of the Great Star, named Mysterious Pivot: May I ascend as an immortal, riding the void and steering the floating.
Second, the essence of the Origin Star, named Northern Terrace: May I ascend as an immortal, roaming the Terrace of the Grotto.
Third, the essence of the True Star, named Nine Ultimates of the Upper Perfected: May I ascend as an immortal, governing the Three Mysteries.
Fourth, the essence of the Pivot Star, named Pivot Root: May my jade name be ranked among the flying immortals.
Fifth, the essence of the Network Star, named Celestial Balance: May I ascend as an immortal, ascending to the Upper Clarity.
Sixth, the essence of the Chronicle Star, named Life Mechanism: May I ascend as an immortal, my name inscribed in the Grand Tenuity.
Seventh, the essence of the Pass Star, named Mysterious Yang: May I ascend as an immortal, commanding jade lads.
Eighth, the essence of the Emperor Star, named Lofty Jade Sovereign: May I ascend as an immortal, entering the hall of the Later Sage.
Ninth, the essence of the August Star, named Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity: May I ascend as an immortal, entering the cinnabar-jade chamber."

After reciting these nine invocations in order, then visualize the stars and rest within the Dipper. Then again silently knock your teeth, swallow saliva, and pray to the nine stars of great essence and the True Lord of the Northern Culmen as described above.

Once all visualizations and prayers are complete, after a long while, visualize the essence of the Dipper stars suddenly entering the Grotto Chamber, illuminating your entire body, penetrating the five viscera. The three barriers and hundred joints all glow with crimson radiance. Pray: "Primordial essence of the Grotto Chamber, Great Worthy of the Red Child, Florid Canopy of the Dipper’s light, come illuminate the Mud Pill. Refine my bones and blood, restrain my po and govern my hun. Enable me to ascend as an immortal, riding the clouds to the dawn, ascending to pay court to the Jade Emperor and the Primordial Lord of the Great One."

When this is complete, the external image of the Dipper stars merely divides its essence to enter the Mud Pill—it does not mean moving from one place to another. Thus, both the bed and the head contain them.

The Azure Lad states: "Sleeping with the yin essence of the Northern Dipper brings the immortal’s numen; the Grotto Chamber’s reception of the Northern Dipper’s yang essence causes the five viscera to generate spontaneously, enabling one to ride the radiance and roam the Upper Clarity." According to the Azure Lad’s words, the Northern Dipper possesses both yin and yang spirits—perhaps also an analogy for the two essences of human hun and po.

The stars of the Northern Dipper cover the Florid Dawn, their essence radiating nine paths, their light shading the ten heavens. The yang revolves nine nines, hence its lofty reverence. Mortals see only seven stars and not the other two. The eighth and ninth are the spirits of the August Emperor and the Great August One, hidden within the Mysterious Mirror, preserving and governing the celestial hun. Their numinous light blazes brilliantly, serving as the anchor for these seven stars, yet they do not shine upon those of the worldly realm who pursue glory and fame.

The perfected Daoist immortals, exalted transcendents, and the officials of the Upper Clarity and Great Clarity may behold them, yet even upon seeing, they must not speak of it recklessly. After witnessing them, the Most High Jade Emperor and the Imperial Lord of the Grand Tenuity shall come to you and confer upon you a true office. Among worldly folk who carelessly glimpse them, there are those who mistakenly see these two stars—those who see must take care never to speak of it.

The *Divine Records of the Most High* states: Whoever sees one of the high stars of the Northern Dipper in the Grand Tenuity gains three hundred years added to their lifespan; seeing both grants six hundred years. Yet common people, steeped in impurity, seldom merit the descent of these two august ones. These stars surpass the seven in size, their radiance suffused with purple splendor, unlike ordinary stars—resplendent and awe-inspiring. Those who see them must bow in reverence, kowtow, and make their entreaties. Always on the third and twenty-seventh nights of the lunar month, secretly await them, letting no one know. With sincere devotion over time, none shall fail to see them. The stars possess three essences, hence the use of the twenty-seventh day.

By the Most High’s law, those who recklessly reveal the names of the numinous essences or disclose what they have seen shall suffer bodily harm by blade and fire, meet sudden torment in the earth-prison hells, and implicate their parents in life and death, incurring the wrath of the Three Officials. In the Qin era, Xu Fu was but a common man when he first glimpsed the two stars; he dared not speak of it and thus gained extended years. Only then did he come to believe in the existence of immortals and turn to the study of the Dao. Han Zhong, Sima Jizhu, the Perfected Mencius Zhuo of Mount Song, Zhang Jujun, and Yin Gui—all these, too, were among those who beheld them.

During the Han dynasty, Huo Guang, the Chancellor, had a slave in charge of his wardrobe named Huanche, who was somewhat literate. Once, he saw among Huo Guang’s solemn preparations a short scroll that read: *"Always on the third and twenty-seventh nights of the lunar month, secretly await the Northern Dipper. Do this repeatedly, and you shall see something. Upon seeing, bow; after bowing and making your entreaties, do not speak of it—all shall gain three hundred years."* Huanche committed this to memory and tested it not once but many times. One night, he suddenly saw the two stars above the Dipper, their light extraordinary. He bowed and departed, and thus gained six hundred years. Yet this slave, though possessing some intent, lacked great aspiration; he did not study the Dao but merely prolonged his years until death.

This account comes from Lord Wang, who transmitted it to the Great Lord Mao. Here ends the *Upper Scripture of the Golden Book and Jade Characters of the Upper Clarity*.
