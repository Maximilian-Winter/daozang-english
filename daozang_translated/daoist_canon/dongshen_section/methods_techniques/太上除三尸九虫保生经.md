- **Terrace Light (Taiguang)**
- **Mysterious Essence (Youjing)**

#### **Method for Summoning the Three Hun**
The Three Hun reside beneath the liver, shaped like human figures, clad in azure robes with inner yellow garments. On the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third nights of each month, they leave the body to wander abroad. At such times, one must lie supine, remove the pillow, stretch the feet, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, and hold the breath. Strike the teeth thrice, concentrate the mind thrice. A crimson qi, large as a chicken’s egg, will emerge from within and rise to the throat, dispersing true light that envelops the body in flame, bathing it in a mist-like radiance. When the body feels a gentle warmth, call the names of the Three Hun and softly intone the incantation:

> *"Palace of Purple Tenuity, Primordial Yellow and Azure,
> Refine the Three Hun within, Embryonic Light finds peace.
> Divine Treasure in the Jade Chamber, born with me as one.
> Do not stir recklessly—Great Spirit oversees.
> If you would take flight, ascend only to the Upper Clarity.
> Should hunger or thirst arise, drink the essence of jade.
> Scintillating Spirit guards me, Three Terraces nourish me,
> Mysterious Essence preserves my life.
> Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!"*

Thus, the hun-souls will be calmed, misfortunes averted, malevolent spirits subdued, the body at peace, and the Dao attained—forever free from sorrow and suffering.

#### **The Seven Po**
The Seven Po are yin and malevolent qi that become ghosts. They cause the body to wander as a corpse, fostering anxiety, greed, jealousy, and obstruction. They induce nightmares and teeth-grinding, making one speak falsely and act contrary to the heart. They provoke seminal loss, lust, infatuation, extravagance, and debauchery, eroding all purity and reducing one to ghostly conduct. The heart’s harm to things becomes their root; in the netherworld, they bury poison, taking harming others as their essence. They constantly mislead people from the path of integrity and brightness, steering them toward darkness. They favor evil and despise good, cultivate death and neglect life. They seek to overpower others and strengthen the self, indulging in gluttony and murky desires. They multiply corpse-worms and filth, hasten leakage, and urge death, scheming for human sacrifices.

If one can circulate and refine primordial qi, attain the elixir, and secure true essence, allowing yang to prevail and yin to dissipate, no harm will arise. Each night at the hour of *xu* (7–9 p.m.), recite the incantation:

> *"I receive the scripture of the Three Sovereigns,
> The numinous chapter of the Supreme Ultimate.
> Ingesting the elixir, absorbing qi,
> Dispelling all misfortune.
> Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!"*

By doing so, one will sleep soundly, the body will be robust and healthy, and evil disasters will never dare approach.

#### **On Cultivation to Eliminate the Three Worms**
Those who cultivate to sever the Three Worms must first single-mindedly uphold the Dao, distinguishing themselves from worldly people, before ingesting medicinal substances. Otherwise, their efforts will be in vain.

#### **Diagram of the Seven Po**

The Seven *Po* are: *Shigou* (Corpse Hound), *Fushi* (Crouching Arrow), *Queyin* (Sparrow Yin), *Tunzei* (Swallowing Thief), *Feidu* (Flying Poison), *Chuhui* (Expelling Filth), and *Choufei* (Fetid Lung). These Seven *Po* accumulate the qi of yin, their forms resembling ghosts. They cause people to indulge in excessive desires and toil, leading to blockages, tension, and constraint, favoring filth and shunning conflict. They compel one to act as a walking corpse, turning away from life and toward death, fostering flattery, deceit, and cunning, and craving sensual pleasures. Day and night, they incite evil, hastening early death, and consign one to the ghostly realm. They obscure the gateway of human life, and are thus named *Shigou*, *Fushi*, *Queyin*, *Tunzei*, *Feidu*, *Chuhui*, and *Choufei*. Whenever desires arise or the heart is depleted, one must strictly refrain and not follow them, thereby attaining peace.

Worldly people exhaust themselves in pursuit of material principles, yet naturally attain the Dao. If one is bewitched by the yin *po*, seduced and confused, the mind loses its rightful faith, resembling a corpse in filth, and the nature becomes naturally deluded. Even with a strong will, one cannot turn back. Seeking a master and inquiring into the Dao, one must not engage in ghostly, perverse, flattering, or deceitful conduct. If one attains the Dao in this manner, demonic obstacles will descend upon the body, and cultivation will ultimately fail. For the fruit of one’s actions arises from the natural course of things, and one will remain mired in the walking corpse, entangled in the world’s net, sinking into the yin underworld to become a ghost, or straying into crookedness to become a demon. Alike in kind, how lamentable—yet the world is all thus.

Therefore, this essential method is set forth to reveal the truth to the deluded, enabling them first to subdue the Six Thieves and the *po* of the corpse, and gradually ascend to the realm of the perfected. Even if one does not yet reach the ranks of immortals, one will at least avoid falling into evil destinies.

Moreover, on the new moon, full moon, and the last day of each month, when the Seven *Po* are not restrained, one must particularly focus on internally controlling them. Strike the teeth seven times, then call out the names of the Seven *Po* once. For women cultivating the Dao, strike the teeth twice, seven times in total, and call their names twice. Sit upright, clench the fists, and calm the mind, then recite the incantation:

> *"The Jade Emperor, most exalted,
> The Supreme Sovereign, most true.
> May the myriad spirits be pacified and settled,
> The Seven *Po* bound to the body.
> Let them not transgress or err,
> Nor consort with evil.
> Ever dwell within the chamber,
> Together transformed into immortals.
> Forever guard the spirit and form,
> Preserve my attainment of the true.
> Roam the celestial palaces,
> As jade guests in company.
> Within, the numinous inner court,
> The body suffused with jade essence.
> Protect me, shield me,
> Let no perverse or lewd acts arise.
> Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!"*

Lord Lao said: The yin *po*, the turbid qi of the corpse, reside within the corporeal soul, and the spirit must constantly guard them. Thus, those who study the Dao follow the luminous soul to restrain the *po*, which is the art of refining the form. If one follows the yin *po* of the corpse, depleting the essence of the yang spirit and dissipating the upright qi, death will come swiftly.

The scripture states: *"The hun longs to ascend to heaven, the po descends to the Yellow Springs; to return the hun and restore the po is the natural Dao."* It also says: *"Refine the yang hun to control the yin po."* For in life, one follows the hun, and in death, one follows the po. The hun favors ascent, the po favors descent. The sage, in his subtlety, reveals the path of cultivation, teaching people to empty the heart and preserve essence, to circulate qi and harmonize the Five Spirits. When the Five Spirits are not enslaved, the true spirit naturally responds, and immortality draws near.

Those who study the Dao must restrain the hun and control the po, using yang to dissolve yin, allowing the hun to refine the po. As yin filth gradually diminishes, the Dao of longevity is achieved. The scripture states: *"Of those who follow life, there are thirteen,"* referring to the Three Hun and Seven Po. *The Yellow Court Scripture* says: *"Gather the hun and return the po, never to falter or lose."* The hun and po are the essence of yin and yang. If one can align with and focus on them, restrain and control them, ensuring the hun never departs, then the Dao of enduring vision becomes clear.

Yang and yin unite, and thus humans are born. The formation of the embryo, the circulation of qi, and the union of form all arise from this. Therefore, this diagram is made clear to transmit to later generations, that they may ponder and practice it carefully.

### **Diagram of the Corpse-Guarding Ghost**
The corpse-guarding ghost is also called *Poshe* (Breaking Arrow). Its form resembles a small child, sometimes like a dog or horse. On its back grows black hair two inches long. While in the human body, after death, it is called a ghost. It appears the same height as the deceased in life, haunting people in dreams to seek food. It can afflict people with headaches, chills, fever, and nausea, claiming to be the deceased. These corpse ghosts, with their deceptive and varied forms, disturb the hun and po, causing nightmares, confusion, and premature death. If one obtains and ingests the elixir, they cannot cause harm.

After prolonged sitting, the radiance of the spirit becomes bright and clear. A brother said: *"Yesterday, I drank the infused medicinal water, and vomited and purged foul and strange substances—these must have been the Three Worms and Nine Parasites!"* Alas, even the water infused with medicine possesses such great efficacy—how much more so the divine medicine from the crucible, which must surely be numinous!

Thereupon, he took the medicine crucible from the chamber, broke the seal, and opened it. Inside, the medicine was a pool of congealed liquid, shimmering with purple light, its fragrance invigorating the spirit and soul. Not a speck was lost. The brothers, with utmost sincerity, offered it to heaven. They took the medicine, ground it finely, and formed pills the size of rice grains. After purifying themselves, they divided it into three portions: one portion was buried beneath a mountain to nourish the earth, one was scattered into rivers and lakes to nourish the fish, and one was kept to save the world and aid people. The brothers, with reverence, gazed toward heaven, bowed twice, and ingested the pills.

After one pill, three pills, seven pills, their eyebrows and beards swiftly regrew, sores and wounds dried and fell away, their temples became lustrous, decayed teeth regenerated, their skin grew radiant and smooth, and all illnesses were dispelled. Within ten days, clouds arose at the valley’s mouth, white cranes circled, and fragrant winds filled the stream. Suddenly, a youthful immortal arrived, bearing a pair of crimson tally-staffs, with two dragon-phoenix mounts. The immortal youths bowed to the two brothers and invited them to ascend the cloud chariot. They paid homage at the Golden Gates, then gently rose upon the clouds and ascended as immortals.

On the twenty-first day of the ninth lunar month in the autumn of the third year of Guanghua during the Tang dynasty, Yang Yuanyi, the abbot of Qingcheng Mountain, submitted a report to the county, stating: On the twenty-first day of this month at the hour of *yin*, two individuals ascended as immortals from a thatched hut in the grassy hills north and south of the creek, their destination unknown. The remains of their alchemical fires and the traces of their deeds remain inscribed upon the stele, though the full account eludes comprehension.

**Chart of the Three Corpses**

**Upper Corpse: Pengju**
The Upper Corpse, Pengju—also called "Ah He"—dwells in the head, assaulting the *niwan* and *dantian*. It causes heaviness in the head, dimmed vision, cold tears, clear nasal discharge, deafness, tooth loss, and facial wrinkles. It deludes one into craving carriages and horses, indulging in sensual pleasures, and perceiving filth as akin to green worms. It bores into and depletes one’s true *qi*, withering the form, whitening the hair, and shortening life. It induces drowsy confusion, records one’s transgressions, and reports them to the Celestial Officials of the Upper Prime. If one refines and ingests the essence, consolidating *qi* and taking potent elixirs, the Great Dao lies near, and the Nine Heavens are not distant. If not, on the night of *gengshen*, one may stay awake to slay it, or consume scallions, cinnabar, and *zhi* herbs to dissolve the Yin Corpse naturally.

**Middle Corpse: Pengxu**
The Middle Corpse, Pengxu—also called "Zuozi"—delights in bewitching the five flavors and coveting the five colors. It resides in the heart and abdomen, attacking the *jiangong* and middle *jiao*. It confounds the heart, induces forgetfulness, depletes fluids and *qi*, inverts perceptions, and breeds restlessness, vexation, dry mouth, and pale eyes. It gnaws at the teeth, relentlessly harming the five viscera and six bowels, giving rise to manifold illnesses. It causes excessive sleep, nightmares, ghostly unions, seminal loss, red or white urine, slippery diarrhea, retching, copious phlegm, tinnitus, spontaneous sweating, and absent-mindedness. By day, one grows lethargic; by night, terrified. It hastens death to secure sacrificial offerings. If one cultivates tranquility in the five emotions and ingests cinnabar and elixirs, it can do no harm, and the body will escape decay.

**Lower Corpse: Pengjiao**
The Lower Corpse, Pengjiao—also called "Jixi"—dwells in the stomach and feet, assaulting the lower pass and injuring the *qi* sea, giving rise to a hundred ailments. It entices the mind toward lust, fosters infatuation with women, and spurs reckless desires, depleting vitality in all matters. Unable to restrain itself, it shortens life. It causes nocturnal congress with ghosts, turning one’s back on life and toward death, draining essence and *qi*. It desiccates the marrow, stiffens the sinews, emaciates the flesh, wearies the mind, hollows the body, weighs down the waist, and weakens the knees and feet. Frequent urination, mingling with pathogenic *qi*, gradually breeds grave afflictions. The five taxations and seven injuries sow confusion, clinging to the corpse’s influence without cease, compelling one toward the ghostly path in hopes of sacrificial feasts. If one ingests mercury, decoctions, cinnabar, or true lead, the Yin Corpse’s *po* will dissolve, and the body will remain whole and at peace.

**The Nine Worms**

1. **Hidden Worm**: Four inches long.
2. **Twisting Worm**: One inch long.
3. **White Worm**: One inch long.
4. **Flesh Worm**: Resembling a rotten plum.
5. **Lung Worm**: Like silkworm ants.
6. **Stomach Worm**: Resembling shrimp.
7. **Diaphragm Worm**: Like a wild rice stem.
8. **Red Worm**: Like a raw worm.
9. **Dung Worm**: Black in color.

Beyond these, myriad tiny worms, as fine as mustard seeds, swarm the body—these govern the host. They cause skin pain and itching, giving rise to severe wind sores, malignant ulcers, ringworm, hemorrhoids, anal leakage, genital maggots, damp itching, and tooth decay, leading to inexplicable bleeding and foul odors—all their doing.

**Worm Descriptions**
The **Hidden Worm** is four inches long, with bristles and fangs, and feeds on essence and blood. It leaves one weak and breathless, prone to nausea, visceral pain, and stabbing discomfort in the chest and face.

Those fond of raw, cold, or meaty flavors scatter and deplete one’s primordial essence. They induce profuse night sweats, dribbling urine, back pain, and lumbar strain, leaving one weak and enervated, with seminal efflux and depletion—ultimately leading to illness and death. It is imperative to take alum infusions, *Aspidium* cinnabar pills early on to consolidate and expel them, preventing these worms from internally disrupting the life-sustaining essence.

**Roundworm** (also called *hui* worm): One male and one female reside above and below the heart, feeding on human blood. They cause heart pain, breathlessness, heaviness in the limbs, difficulty urinating with turbid or bloody discharge, pallid complexion, lethargy, and drooling. These worms, a foot in length, drink heart blood and gain numinous awareness. One should regularly inscribe the *Zhenyi* talisman with cinnabar and swallow *erqi* mercury to kill them. Otherwise, they pierce the heart and spleen, inducing unbearable pain and death, or exhaust one’s vital qi, leading to sudden demise.

**Tapeworm**: An inch long, with offspring multiplying endlessly, some reaching four or five inches. They compel cravings for raw rice, tea, flour, fruit, and raw meat, depleting the viscera and emaciating the body. Symptoms include copious phlegm, nasal discharge, sallow complexion, weakness, abdominal gnawing, sudden lumps, excruciating pain, and dysentery, progressing to rectal prolapse. Consuming chicken meat exacerbates their growth, allowing them to burrow into the viscera, forming unseen cavities until breath fails and death ensues. Ingesting mercury and cinnabar gradually restores tranquility.

**Flesh Worm**: Resembling a rotten plum, it feeds on human blood. It drains vital qi, causing dribbling urine, frailty, lumbar weakness, skin pain and itching, and gradual darkening and desiccation of the flesh. Dwelling in the upper membranes, it stokes lust, depleting one’s vigor and essence until illness and death follow. One must swiftly take *erqi* cinnabar pills to eradicate them and prevent bodily emaciation.

**Lung Worm**: Shaped like a silkworm, older ones turn gray or resemble red ants, consuming human essence and qi. Lodged at the lung’s entrance, they induce copious phlegm, coughing that evolves into consumptive illness, facial swelling, breathlessness, restless sleep, and feline-like wheezing. They obstruct the five vocal tones, dull the complexion, wither the skin and hair, and cause beard and hair loss, leading to progressive breathlessness. In severe cases, hemoptysis occurs, with ears splayed, shoulders raised, chest bones protruding, and the body emaciated and repulsive, inducing constant drowsiness. Linked to the six bowels, they trigger frequent bloody dysentery, evolving into five types of hemorrhoids and consumptive illnesses, with flushed cheeks, bone steaming, night sweats, and salty, fishy sputum—ultimately claiming one’s life in an instant. One should take *Haiyu* cinnabar pills, *Jinhua* powder, and *Zisu* decoctions to harmonize the lungs and eradicate the root. Otherwise, lung distension and chaotic qi invasion will silently deplete one’s breath, leading to premature death.

**Stomach Worm**: Like a toad or tiger in form, it intercepts food, inducing constant hunger and cravings for meaty, bloody flavors, as well as raw, cold, sweet, or fragrant foods. It weakens the viscera, emaciating the body, causing chapped lips, mouth sores, nasal congestion, skin pain, limb spasms, back fatigue, nausea, copious phlegm, alcohol-induced vomiting, loss of appetite, qi stagnation in the chest, surging into the flanks, and sudden attacks on the external kidneys, exhausting qi and dimming vitality. First, fortify the heart and spleen’s daily essence, then dissolve the yin spirit—the worms will dissolve, and cinnabar will restore a rosy complexion.

**Diaphragm Worm**: Causes the six senses to grow dim, inducing taciturnity and excessive sleep. After sleep, one dreams of wandering to distant lands, climbing towering mountains, or falling from cliffs, crossing waters by boat only to drown. One converses with willows and peach spirits, laughs amidst flowers, or engages in licentious acts—commonly dismissed as nightmares. This stems from yin qi stirring while yang qi is entirely depleted, seductive allure severing the spiritual root, and essence loss deforming the body. The once-lovely visage ages prematurely. Taking divine cinnabar restores vitality like parched seedlings revived by a single irrigation, yielding tenfold harvests.

**Red Worm**: Leaves one breathless and enervated, with heavy waist, dim eyes, ringing ears, and deafness. It causes genital itching, night sweats, seminal efflux, cold depletion, lumbar pain, spinal discomfort, and aching bones. Food loses flavor, the intestines and stomach grow weak and noisy, essence flows with water into urine, turbid qi and stagnant blood form sores, abscesses, and carbuncles, leading to premature death. One should first take heart-settling cinnabar to calm the soul, then use tonic pills to secure the two gates, ensuring harmonious circulation—worms will dissolve, sparing the body from desiccation.

**Dung Worm**: Black in color, with myriad tiny external worms swarming like mustard seeds—these govern the host. They cause skin sores, malignant ringworm, scalp scabs, lice, yin abscesses, damp itching, hemorrhoids, anal leakage, rodent ulcers, genital itching, and other afflictions. They erode teeth, causing inexplicable bleeding, foul odors, foot rot, stubborn numbness, leprosy, suppurating sores, bloody corpse-like lesions, eyebrow loss, and gradual darkening of the flesh. The contagion severs familial bonds and marital ties. Thus, sages left behind potent remedies and secret techniques, instructing later generations to first bathe and fast, then take cinnabar, mercury, alum infusions, and calomel to kill the Three Corpses worms, sparing descendants from harm and preserving health.

The worms are deep black in color. Formerly, Master Zhang studied the Dao under Teacher Wang, and later became a disciple of Master Sun the Perfected. He was first taught the method for expelling worms. These corpse-worms take shape through ingested substances, and when potent medicines penetrate and expel them, he showed them to his disciple, Master Zhou. Master Zhou illustrated them to transmit to later generations.

Later, in West Shu’s Mount Qingcheng, the Daoist Zhao Xiyi, whose Daoist practice was profound and subtle, ascended mountains and traversed perilous paths. At the time, the Prefect of Pengzhou, Attendant Gentleman Yu He, welcomed him to the prefectural seat and became his disciple. After several years, whenever the Gengshen day arrived, Zhao followed the scriptures in vigilant observance, ingesting talismanic medicines from noon to midnight without cease. He too felt the descent of three-foot-nine worms, and so commanded artisans to depict their forms and qualities, transmitting them to those who sought to preserve life.

My friend Chen Lingzhang, originally from Dongping, arrived in West Shu during the Yuanhe era to cultivate the Dao. In the second summer month of the early Changqing era, while staying at the home of his Daoist companion Li Xuanhui in Xinqiao, he fasted for over a hundred days, practicing qi techniques and ingesting yang essence, mercury, and numinous medicines, drinking three cups of water daily. By the ninety-seventh day, he reduced his intake to one cup per day when he felt a slight pain in his abdomen. Soon after, the pain intensified, as if something were moving and retreating. Li remarked, “After over ninety days without food, there can be no waste or filth—something extraordinary must be occurring,” and instructed him to expel it into a basin. After some time, a mass of fatty membrane emerged, writhing ceaselessly. When washed with water, the membrane became translucent, revealing two worms within, complete with whiskers and claws, their bodies black. Each had six legs, whiskers five fen in length, crimson eyes, and feet and heads like vermilion dots, resembling the worms found on willow trees in summer, commonly called "yi-yang." He took them in his hands, and when clenched, they bit into his palm like stone mice. The crowd marveled and sighed in astonishment: “If the five viscera harbor such worms, how can one attain longevity?”

After expelling these worms, Master Chen’s complexion became like that of a child, his ears and eyes sharp and clear. Later, he entered Mount Qingcheng and never emerged. He compiled this into a record, illustrating the worms’ forms to warn future generations.

**Illustrated Chart of the Worms That Transmit Fetal Knowledge of Fate**
These worms, which transmit fetal knowledge of fate, are of the same kind as flying corpse-worms. They embrace the qi of grains and the flow of essence, born together with humans. They cause people to lack steadfast faith, to envy the virtuous Dao, to befriend evil, and to fear yang spirits. Whenever they incite wrath, they compel others to share their ghostly fate. Day and night, they sow misfortune and delusion, strange cravings, hatred, and desire. They entangle the six emotions—self and others, kindness and love, beauty and lust—binding and staining the impure, draining the original essence. They are the root of human illness, depleting the body and spirit, exhausting the true nature. They drive people to relentless pursuit, reckless haste, and frantic striving, ceasing only when life is spent.

These worms favor the consumption of meat, tea, and roasted or fried foods, causing the viscera and bowels to become loose and leaky, the ears and eyes dull and heavy, the mouth and nose foul with odorous breath, and the body afflicted with dripping discharges, white flakes covering the head, itching skin, and generalized tension. Internally, they gradually inflict damage, leading one toward the path of death. The worms possess ghostly generals that stir them, and only when they block the human life-gate do they finally disperse.

If one seals the essence, circulates qi, and ingests elixirs, they cannot cause harm, and the body remains secure in the world, forever free from worry and suffering.

**Lord Lao’s Formula for Expelling Corpse-Worms**
- *Guan zhong* (Dryopteris): five fen, to subdue and kill worms.
- *Bai que lu* (white sparrow’s reed): twelve fen, to kill the most pernicious worms.
- *Shu qi* (Sichuan lacquer): three fen, to kill white worms.
- *Wu yi* (elm seeds): five fen, to kill flesh worms.
- *Lei wan* (omphalia): five fen, to kill red worms.
- *Jiang can* (silkworm): four fen, to suppress pain-causing worms.
- *Hou po* (magnolia bark): five fen, to kill lung worms.
- *Lang ya zi* (wolf’s tooth): four fen, to kill green worms.
- *Shi can* (stone silkworm): five fen, to kill molting worms.

Grind these nine ingredients finely, roast until fragrant, and pulverize into powder. Mix with honey to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take five pills with light mercury slurry, three times daily. Gradually increase to ten pills; effects appear after thirty days. After sixty days, all ailments are cured, and the worms are eradicated.

When taking this elixir, one must first purify through fasting and abstinence, then ingest it with utmost sincerity—there is no case where it fails to work. This scriptural formula has been verified by the senses. On the *jiazi* day, guard it as a secret, a secret indeed.

**Supreme Lord’s Secret Formula for Refining Cinnabar from Mercury to Expel the Three Corpses**
- Cinnabar mercury: one *jin*; solar essence: one *liang*.
- Realgar: three *liang*.

Gently stir-fry the ingredients over a slow fire for one full day and night until they turn purple. Then refine them seven times in a water-and-fire crucible, followed by intense firing. Once the fire-toxin is expelled, mix with barley flour to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. For each *liang* of the mixture, add six *zhu* of light mercury, and take seven pills on an empty stomach. Avoid mutton blood and mallow.

The Perfected One states: This elixir stabilizes the hun and po souls, secures primordial essence, replenishes blood and fluids, preserves complexion, dispels all illnesses, strengthens sinews and bones—all with proven efficacy. The Supreme Lord’s Six Decades and Six Jia Talismans: take ten pills every ten days to expel the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, preserve yang essence, and yield profound results. Combine this with the previous method—grind cinnabar mercury, inscribe talismans, and ingest regularly.

**Six Talismans**
Knock the teeth three times, bow deeply, and invoke the names of the Six Jia deities, saying: *"I, [your name], reverently receive this sacred talisman."* Respectfully summon:
- **Jiazi** Deity-King Wenqing, with eighteen attending officials, descend to bind my brush.
- **Jiaxu** Deity Zhan Zigong, with fourteen attending officials, descend to bind my brush.
- **Jiashen** Deity Hu Wenqing, with sixteen attending officials, descend to bind my brush.
- **Jiawu** Deity Wei Shangqing, with eighteen attending officials, descend to bind my brush.
- **Jiachen** Deity Meng Feiqing, with fourteen attending officials, descend to bind my brush.
- **Jiayin** Deity Ming Wenzhang, with sixteen attending officials, descend to bind my brush.

Inscribe the above talismans in a purified chamber after burning incense. Write them in cinnabar on a *churu* day and swallow to subdue the Three Corpses. Prepare three talismans, and on each *gengshen* night, inscribe them on paper with cinnabar and ingest—none shall fail. On *gengshen* nights, ward off corpse-demons and ghosts: apply cinnabar beneath both eyes and realgar slightly into the left nostril after touching the right. Upon completion, knock the teeth three times and recite the incantation:
*"Supreme radiance coils, cinnabar and yellow scatter mist.
Qi gathers, expelling turbid evil; corpse-filth sinks into slumber.
As the hun refines and po forges, form unites with immortality.
Grant me undying life, eternal fortune and longevity.
Sharp hearing, penetrating sight—long enjoy the primal profit."*

After reciting, knock the teeth three more times and swallow saliva thrice. Press the right index finger beneath the right nostril and the left middle finger beneath the left nostril, each seven times, then hold firmly without lifting—these are the portals of the Seven Po and wandering corpses, the bridges of essence-thieves. Thus, with the essence of cinnabar and realgar, block the paths of corpse-demons and seal the qi of licentiousness.

**Secret Method to Subdue the Three Corpses on Jiazi Days**
At dawn, collect one *sheng* of water from the east; at noon, collect another; at dusk, collect a third. At midnight, expose the water to starlight and moonlight, then face east and recite the incantation before drinking:
*"Heaven is clear, earth is tranquil; sun, moon, and five stars.
Six Jia divine water, extinguish the corpse-thief armies.
Turn misfortune to fortune, primal harmony prevails.
Hasten as the law commands!"*

The initial elixir is also called the Worm-Restraining Pill:
- Large aconite (five *liang*; select eight-angled specimens, roast until cracked).
- Frankincense (five *liang*).
- Costus root (five *liang*).
- Hemp seeds (seven *sheng*).
- Dried rehmannia (six *liang*).
- Rhubarb (five *liang*).
- Myrrh (five *liang*).
- Atractylodes (seven *liang*).
- Root bark of southern evodia (harvested at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month, facing the king; five *liang*).
- Cinnamon bark (five *liang*).
- *Yunzhi* blossoms (five *liang*).
- Cinnabar (five *liang*).
- Stone calamus (dried until brittle; weigh ten *liang* and steep in one *dou* of clear wine).

Grind the thirteen ingredients separately, each for three thousand strokes. Combine and mix with white honey, then grind for eight thousand strokes—ideally, fifty thousand strokes to complete the elixir. Store in a sealed vessel, guarding against leakage and contamination. At dawn, face east and take seven pills the size of small beans, gradually increasing by one pill, taken with wine. This elixir nourishes and strengthens, dispels myriad afflictions, stabilizes the hun and po, and replenishes fluids and blood. Upon finishing one dose, the grain-worms die, and with their death, the Three Corpses wither. It may be taken regularly; once the grain-worms are eradicated, one may eat grains without illness or harm from overeating. These are the words of the utmost truth—worthy of diligent practice.

**Method for Crafting *Yunzhi* Blossoms**
- Mica powder (five *liang*).
- Realgar (sifted to extreme fineness; four *liang*).

Combine the two in a bronze vessel and heat gently until the color slightly changes. Transfer to a bamboo tube, seal tightly with pine resin to prevent qi leakage, and suspend beneath a steamer. Steam until one *shi* of rice is cooked, then inspect—when the three substances meld like congealed fat, mix again with pine resin (ten *liang* total). Hang in a room for twenty-four days, then grind for ten thousand strokes to complete the *Yunzhi* blossoms.

Fast for three days before crafting the *Yunzhi* blossoms, then fast for seven more days before preparing the Worm-Restraining Pill. During these nine fasts, avoid the five pungent vegetables, five meats, and the sight of women, hawks, or dogs. Work in a separate chamber. If the fasts are impure or taboos violated, the elixir will be ineffective and may cause fiery sores to erupt across the body—proof of impurity or transgression during the fast. Use only the finest ingredients, meticulously prepared. Prepare the elixir on the first, third, seventh, or eleventh day of the lunar month. Burn incense, arrange a divine seat facing east, and on that day, the Controller of Destiny and Great Unity Lord will oversee the process.

To compound the elixir, arrange the seating to face east. In crafting this great medicine, avoid overcast skies and windy or rainy days—guard this secret closely. In ancient times, Master Yang, Nongqiuzi, Dongfang Shuo, Que Wenzi, and Shangqiuzi all consumed this elixir to practice *bigu* and attained immortality.

**Method for Expelling the Three Worms**
*(From the Inner Transmission of Su the Immortal)*
- *Wuyi* (elm seeds), five *liang*
- *Gouqigen* (lycium root), two *liang*
- Dried lacquer, four *liang* (stir-fried until smoke rises; this ingredient alone requires separate frying)

Grind the three ingredients together and sift into a fine powder. At dawn, first eat a meal, then take a three-finger pinch of the powder, mixing it with well-flower water to consume. After five days, the three worms will descend on their own. Initially, one may feel melancholy and sorrowful—this is the sign of the worms’ departure.

**Method for Guarding the Gengshen Day**
Visualize within the head: the Most High Lord Lao and the Mud-Pill Realized One, two figures seated together, wearing *yuanyou* caps and dark robes, enthroned within a canopy of dim light. They gaze downward to purify the breath of the mouth, eyes, ears, and nose—this is called "embracing the Hun of the Upper One."

Visualize within the heart: the Supreme Thearch and the Crimson Palace Realized One, two figures seated together, wearing nine-sun crowns and robes of cinnabar and southern radiance, enthroned within a vermilion canopy. They gaze downward to observe the condition of the four limbs, ensuring the liver, spleen, gallbladder, and kidneys are all as clear and pure as five-colored jade—this is called "restraining the four limbs’ wayward essences of the Middle One."

Visualize within the navel: the Great Yellow Lord Lao and the Yellow Realized One, two figures wearing ten-spirit crowns and yellow silk robes, enthroned within a golden brocade canopy. They gaze downward to inspect the orifices of the spleen and intestines, making them distinct as unbleached silk—this is called "restraining the intestines and stomach to govern the corporeal soul of the Lower One."

Thus, the Three Worms will have no opportunity to stir.

**Oral Instructions of the Most High Perfected One**
On the *yimao* day of spring, *bingwu* day of summer, *gengshen* day of autumn, and *renzhi* day of winter, at the hour of lying down with eyes closed, grind equal parts cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment into a fine powder, wrap it in silk like a jujube pit, and insert it into the nostrils. This is the secret method for dissolving the Three Worms and refining the Seven Po—let none but the initiate know of it.

At noon the following day, bathe in east-flowing water, then arrange the bedding anew. Don fresh clothing for the Three Worms, cleanse the nostrils, and sweep the sleeping quarters and beneath the bed, ensuring the entire chamber is immaculate.

Then lie down, pillow the head, hold the breath, and clench the fists for a long while. Softly recite the incantation:
*"The Dao of Heaven has constancy, transforming the old to renew.
On this auspicious day of the Thearch, bathing makes one true.
The Three Qi dissolve the worms; cinnabar and yellow unite the Hun.
Precious refinement of the Seven Po—primal, they draw near to me."*

When the incantation is complete, this method is the supreme technique for dissolving and refining the impurities of the corpse, the essential secret for transforming the true and renewing the form. In each of the four seasons, take only one day as auspicious.

**Master Zhao says:**
To expel the Three Worms and Nine Insects, always choose the day of the lunar station at midnight, secretly go to the courtyard, face due east, align the body and rectify the qi, and click the teeth thirty times. Then raise the head slightly, then lower it, and swallow saliva fourteen times. Next, alternately extend and retract the hands fourteen times each, moving them forward and backward as if in concealment.

Recite the incantation:
*"Five Lords of Nanchang, one hundred twenty generals in attendance,
For me expel the Three Worms and Hidden Corpses,
Escort me to roam the world, passing through calamities and misfortunes."*

When the recitation is finished, slowly turn left and return to bed to practice. The Three Worms will be dissolved and destroyed. If the month has a repeated station, perform the method with fasting and seclusion, avoiding disturbances from others. Seek stillness, and let no one know of it—even the sounds of livestock, birds, and beasts should be absent for the best effect. This method is easy to practice and free from the peril of distraction.

**He also says:**
To expel the corpse-worms, in spring choose an *jia* or *yi* day, observe the location of Jupiter at night, and bow toward it at dawn. With a sincere heart, recite the incantation:
*"May the Bright Star of the East support my Hun,
Receive my Po, grant me a lifespan like the pine,
A thousand autumns, ten thousand years, eternal and unfallen.
Expel the Three Worms and Nine Insects from my body, utterly dissolving and destroying them."*

Always choose a pure and clean place to practice this as a virtue.

This is the Lord of Benevolence and Joy in Life: Wood restrains Earth, thus expelling the Earth-Worm.

**Another method for expelling the Three Worms and Nine Insects:**
Always on the last day of the lunar month at moonrise, face east and perform the *Yubu* step three times, reciting the incantation:
*"Nuogao, Nuogao—calling as if in a loud cry.
In the moon are the hare, shrimp, and toad;
In the sun are the worm and three-legged crow;
In the water are the serpent and fish;
In the earth are the worm, ant, and mole cricket;
In the abdomen are the *you* and *baitu* worms."*

Recite this incantation three times, keeping it strictly secret.

The *Yubu* method: hold the breath, first step forward with the left foot, then the right, then bring the left foot alongside the right—three steps in total.

**Another method:**
Always on the *yin* day, trim the fingernails; on the *wu* day, trim the toenails. On the sixteenth day of the eleventh month, burn them to ash and consume it.

**Master Jiang says:**
Use the Five Phases Purple Script. Always at noon on the new and full moons, face west with eyes closed. "Facing" means keeping the eyes closed without opening. Visualize green qi emanating from the eyes, red qi from the heart, and yellow qi from below the navel. Thus, the Three Qi intermingle to irrigate the entire body. In a moment, the interior and exterior will become thoroughly permeated, feeling as if enveloped in firelight.

After a long while, knock the teeth fourteen times and swallow saliva fourteen times. This is called the Dao of refining the form and the method for eliminating the Three Corpses. With prolonged practice, the body will emit the fragrance of the Five Aromas.

Always at the hour of the cock’s crow, rinse the mouth, draw forth the Sweet Spring, and swallow it—three rinses in total. At the *wu*-hour, rise slowly and stabilize the *qi*; do not speak with others.
