**Ghost Valley Master’s Celestial Essence and Sacred Texts – Upper Scroll**

The watery abyss master, Ghost Valley Child, secretly transmits the grand Dao of celestial patterns, measuring the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth, comprehending the origins of transformation. Heaven bestows true nature, yet it is obscured by cravings and desires. Unaware of life and death, one struggles to grasp the subtle truths. The *Dao* and *De* of *Yinfu* [1] encompass the fundamental principles of the Way. The night-photographing inner elixir is the path of the Sage.

Ordinary mortals, bewildered by true nature, failing to grasp ultimate truth, thus name it *Yiwei* [2]—a hidden secret. Initially, it was passed to Sunzi and Pang Gong [3]. Later disciples, practicing my true methods, all achieved escape from peril, survival, and evasion of death. It liberates one from worldly afflictions—
from the calamities of mountains, rivers, and floods,
from the threats of blades, bandits, and raids,
from the gatherings of vengeful spirits,
from the curses of mad ghosts,
from the perils of a million-man battle,
from the ravages of fire, water, thieves, and robbers.

My secret celestial arts are named:
*The Six Heavenly Orthodoxy Formulas*,
*The Six Divine Scriptures*,
*The Art of Concealing Form and Hiding Body*,
*The Technique of Summoning Spirits into the Chamber*,
*The Scripture of the Soul Wandering the Three Realms*,
*The Doctrine of the Watery Abyss’s Subtleties*,
*The Treatise on Transcending Life and Death*.

Within my teachings lie true formulas and divine talismans:
1. *The Concealing Form and Hiding Body Talisman*,
2. *The Summoning Spirits into the Chamber Talisman*,
3. *The Wandering Soul Through the Three Realms Talisman*,
4. *The Transcending Life and Death Talisman*,
5. *The Four Great Fire Substitution Talisman*,
6. *The Circumpolar Concealment and Sealing of the Boundaries Talisman*.

For those in the world who practice, receive my orthodox true scriptures, and study my genuine teachings—reaching even the dregs of my doctrine—one must purify the heart, refine the nature, and strictly uphold incense and offerings. At a propitious year, month, day, and auspicious hour, with sincere intent, one must prepare incense and lamps, observe strict fasting, inscribe the divine talismans in cinnabar, silently recite the divine incantations. After forty-nine days, the talismans will manifest their efficacy.

For men and women in the world who receive my grand formulas and celestial texts, they must hold them with devout sincerity. If one seeks transmission, a ritual platform must be established in three grades.

**Upper-grade platform for transmission:**
Use five-directional brocade, five segments each forty-nine *zhang* [4] long, forty-nine pairs of jade rings, forty-nine mirrors, forty-nine sets of concentric vermilion and green talismans, forty-nine lamps, and forty-nine sets of money, horses, and provisions.

**Middle-grade platform for transmission:**
Use five-directional brocade, five segments each thirty-six *zhang* long, thirty-six pairs of gold rings, thirty-six mirrors, thirty-six sets of concentric vermilion and black talismans, thirty-six lamps, and thirty-six sets of money, horses, and provisions.

**Lower-grade platform for transmission:**
Use five-directional brocade, five segments each twenty-four *zhang* long, twenty-four pairs of silver rings, twenty-four mirrors, twenty-four sets of concentric purple and black talismans, twenty-four lamps, and twenty-four sets of money, horses, and provisions.

These three grades of transmission conceal the golden casket’s secrets. When practicing, one must select a year of favorable cosmic alignment, a good day, and an auspicious hour—only then may the platform be erected, and the transmission will not be in vain.

---
**The Concealing Form and Hiding Body Talisman**
This talisman is inscribed with cinnabar. With resolute intent, bow twenty-four times toward the Northern Dipper, then grasp the brush, facing the North Pole, drawing breath to blow upon the brush before inscribing the talisman.

After forty-nine days of ingestion, one’s form may move unseen. Even amid a million-man battle, inscribe this talisman with cinnabar on the heart (center of the chest), one line on each forearm—it will cause no hindrance, provided one remembers it with sincerity.

---
**The Summoning Spirits into the Chamber Talisman**
This talisman, when practiced and ingested for a hundred days, and the incantation secretly held for a hundred days, will cause the Six Ding Gods [5] to appear before you, to be used at will.

When inscribing, use cinnabar, with sincere intent and hidden heart, bow twenty-four times toward the North, then grasp the brush, drawing in the northern *qi* to blow upon the brush’s tip before inscribing.

---
**The Wandering Soul Through the Three Realms Talisman**
This talisman, when ingested for a hundred days, allows the soul and spirit to be directed at will.

When inscribing, use cinnabar, bow twenty-four times toward the North Pole, facing north, drawing breath to inscribe the talisman—this is sacred.

---
**The Transcending Life and Death Talisman**
This talisman, when ingested for a hundred days, allows one to depart from life and death, or to assume a corpse’s form.

Inscribe as before: bow twenty-four times toward the North Pole, then cease contemplating one’s own body, constantly imagining another’s corpse—whether that of a youth or a refined person—borrowing their form as well.

---
**The Four Great Fire Substitution Talisman**
This talisman is also inscribed in cinnabar. With hidden heart, bow twenty-four times toward the North Pole, drawing in the northern *qi* to blow upon the brush before inscribing.

After a hundred days of ingestion, one will perceive fire-like *qi* in the mouth, and the body will appear as if burned by flames—yet fear not, follow the fire at will, while holding the talisman and reciting the incantation.

---
**My talismans and methods must not be treated lightly.**
Adhere strictly to purity, hold them with a clear heart, and do not reveal them lightly—be warned.

---
**Incantation for the Brush**
*The Heaven is round, the Earth is square; the Six Pitches and Nine Numbers are complete.*
*A single stroke of the divine brush—ten thousand ghosts perish.*
*Urgent, as the decree commands.*

*The Primordial Qi is benevolent, prosperous, and perfect; the sun and moon align with my truth.*
*The divine water enters and is ingested—it does not pass through the body.*
*Urgent, as the decree commands.*

*Daily, hold the incantation.*

**Invocations and Methods of the Highest Dao**

**Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, Supreme Dao Lord, Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Beginning, Lord of Eternal Life and Preservation of Life, Lord of the Eight Trigrams Protecting the Body, Lord of Extended Longevity and Equal Venerables, Lord of the Hidden Form and Transformation, Primordial Lord of the Brain Spirit and Essence Root, Lord of the Eye Spirit and Upper Correspondence, Lord of the Nose Spirit and Dragon Qi, Lord of the Tooth Spirit and the Pure Roar, Lord of the Ear Spirit and the Closed Palace of Heaven, Lord of the Tongue Spirit and Rectitude, Twelve Great True Lords of the Heavy Tower, Lord of the Spleen Spirit and Near-Life, Lord of the Gallbladder Spirit and Empty Space, Lord of the Kidney Spirit and Reverent Dark Warrior, Lord of the Intestinal Spirit and Tree-Soul, Left Azure Dragon Spirit, Right White Tiger Spirit, Front Vermilion Bird Spirit, Rear Dark Warrior Spirit, Six Ding and Six Jia Spirits, Lord of the Essence-Housed Lower Primordial Spirit, Lord of the Fetal Light and Refined Essence, Spirit of the Three Corpses—Pengzhi, Pengju, and Pengyao—each dwelling in their place, thus attaining eternal life.**

I, in reverence to the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, **urgent, as the decree commands.**

**Incantation for the Mind**
Each day, focus the mind. At dawn, facing the sacred altar, secretly recite **one hundred and eight times**.

When forty-nine days have passed, you will sense your body floating in the air like clouds—do not be alarmed, for the method is taking effect.

Afterward, continue daily recitation with great efficacy and secrecy.

Focus the mind with the **Heavenly Key**, practice the **Blood-Qi Method**.

Now, the **blood-qi** pierces the Nine Palaces, traverses the Eight Trigrams.
Circulate the **True Qi fifteen degrees**, first pressing the tongue against the upper palate, steadying the breath fifteen degrees, where saliva gathers below.
Knock the teeth fifteen times, rinse the saliva, and swallow it five times when full.

This is the **Blood-Qi Method**. Upon completion, you will feel sweat emerge from every orifice—this is the verification.
Subtly perceive the sound of *xiao* and *shao* within the crown.
Practice the **Nine Returns and Seven Circulations** to attain completion.

The **Seven Circulations** are the resonance of the heart’s question and the shock of response.
Send the **Fire Wheel to the crown**, left and right for five days, advancing the fire by three parts daily until completion, then return to the source and record it.

Practice the **Hidden and Nearby Body-Closing Method**:
When Heaven is clear and Earth tranquil, the Six Dusts do not arise.
When the heart-qi scatters, send the thought-fire into the palace, turning **one hundred and eight times**, the light turning **fifty-four times**.

If the breath originates from the chest, you will feel a breeze-like sensation in the heart—briefly stifling.

**The Hidden and Nearby Method of the Great Sun Golden Elixir** extends lifespan to **one hundred and twenty years of physical life**—this is the utmost secret.

**From the *Water Lian Cave Ghost Valley Master’s Secret Key, Celestial Text of the Three Caverns, Heart of the Jade Void Emperor, Three Teachings True Lord’s Marvelous Treasure, and the True Scripture of the Responsive Dharma-Mind***

Because the teacher knows the **Key to Eternal Life**, one must know the timing of the fire.
First, recognize the **infant girl with the crimson bloom**, then refine the **yellow bud and white snow**.
Capture and seize her, place her in the furnace, then scoop her out into nine cups of water, illuminating the Buddha’s light.
If not diminished, refine into **qi**—human perception cannot distinguish it.
Know that it has **no cold, no heat, no sun, no moon, no time**.

Further, nurture a **divine embryo** within the furnace—it is neither father’s essence nor mother’s blood.
When the **Three Corpses and Six Bandits are severed**, the Golden Elixir is attained.
**Do not speak of this to outsiders.**

---
**From the *Water Lian Cave Master’s Secret Key, Celestial Text of the Three Caverns, Heart of the Jade Void Emperor, Three Teachings True Lord’s Marvelous Treasure, and the True Scripture of the Responsive Dharma-Mind***

Mankind is born of Heaven and Earth, yet unaware of the **Five Phases and Transformations of Dao**.
Those lost in desire perish from lust, suffer for wealth and beauty.
Some who do good deeds do not receive blessings; some who commit evil do not face retribution.
Those who fast and observe precepts may glimpse a realm beyond form.
Or those who practice **nourishment and cultivation**—how could they not hear of the **Hidden and Nearby Method of Clear Distinction and Dispersed Shadows**?

Now, I compile the **Responsive Method**, refining the **Seven Celestial Symbols into Nine Chapters**, to transmit to the world and liberate all beings.

If men and women in the world practice this method, they must possess a **pure divine nature**, observe the prohibitions, and only then may they fast and cultivate. On the sacred day, the response will manifest before your eyes.

All men and women in the world who receive this method must **fast and recite the incantation**—it will never fail.

This text is a **second-level secret from the Three Pure Ones’ Palace**, its talismans recorded to benefit the world and liberate all beings, verifying its marvelous key.

I universally urge all to receive and protect this text.
**This is a secret book—do not lightly reveal it to others.**

Beware of the **talisman’s authenticity**, the **fasting and prohibitions**, and the **science of avoidance**—all recorded in this volume.
**Hidden and Nearby Methods of Body Concealment and Dispersed Shadows** are transmitted to the world—**do not lightly disclose the secret.**

**Prohibitions for Practitioners:**
- **Avoid meat and strong-smelling foods** during the **Three Elements, Five Sacrificial Periods, Four Seasons, Eight Nodes, Three Sevens, Three Eights, the Fifteenth Day, Birthdays, Natal Days, Jiazi, Gengshen, and Renxu**.
  If violated, the method loses efficacy.

- **Avoid sexual desire** during the **Three Elements, Five Sacrificial Periods, Four Seasons, Eight Nodes, Three Sevens, Three Eights, the Fifteenth Day, Birthdays, Natal Days, Gengshen, Jiazi, Renxu, days of great wind, great rain, great snow, great cold, great darkness, falling stars, great joy, great anger, hunger, or satiety**.
  **Practitioners must remember this.**
  If violated, the method loses efficacy.

**Prohibitions on Flavorful Foods**
Avoid the following: beef, dog meat, black fish meat, turtle meat, the **Five Pungents**—*xiè* (scallions), garlic, onions, coriander, and chives—as well as pungent, sour, bitter, and salty tastes.
If a practitioner consumes these, they will **injure the spirit and exhaust vitality**, risking failure of the method. **Take extreme caution.**

---

**Water False-Symbol (Jiafu)**
Write this symbol in cinnabar ink and swallow it with flowing water.
On the **Day of Full Moon**, face **Beidou (the Big Dipper)** and absorb its *qi* while reciting the incantation and inscribing the symbol.
After **forty-nine days** of ingestion, crossing water requires no boat.
At **one hundred days**, if water enters and fills the space like a house without wetting clothes.
At **one thousand days**, one may traverse water and transform.
**Do not reveal this lightly.**

---

**Metal False-Symbol (Jin Jiafu)**
Write this symbol in cinnabar ink and mix it with powdered mercury.
Form it into pills or pellets, then swallow with cinnabar water.
After **forty-nine days** of ingestion, one dreams of walking among swords and spears—this is the **soul’s departure**.
At **one hundred days**, one sees sword-blades; the practitioner must hold the incantation and symbol to transform.
If encountering any iron object, one’s true form appears within it, assuming its guise.
When inscribing this symbol, face **Beidou**, absorb its *qi*, and blow the incantation onto the brush before writing. **Keep it secret.**

---

**Fire False-Symbol (Huǒ Jiafu)**
Write this symbol in cinnabar ink on mercury-leaf paper, forming **nine #1** (likely *wǔ* 吴, "five" or *yī* 乙, "second heavenly stem") and swallow with **south-flowing water**.
At **one hundred days**, it appears as if borrowing fire for punishment, yet one’s own **true solar fire** responds.
The **self-born fire** is generated by rubbing both hands together for **one hundred days**, transforming ordinary fire into this method’s fire.
In ancient times, **Yellow Emperor** used this method to ride the **Fire Dragon** and pay homage to the **Three Realms**.
This draws **Taiyang’s (Sun’s) *qi***, blown onto the brush before inscribing the seal.

---

**Wood False-Symbol (Mù Jiafu)**
Use **sandalwood heartwood**, decocted into a drink and swallowed, while holding the symbol to one’s body.
Craft a **divine pillow** by startling a jujube tree with thunder, measuring **seven inches two fen** in width and height, **two inches five fen** in thickness.
At dawn, visualize one’s form as if within the pillow before ingesting the symbol.
After **forty-nine days** of reciting the incantation, the divine pillow becomes one’s body, identical in form and substance.
At **one hundred days**, the method is unbreakable; resolve must not falter.
At **one thousand days**, the divine pillow departs on a grand journey, leaving only the pillow in the room as one’s body.
If buried while away, others will exclaim, *"How can the dead return?"*
At such times, it appears as if the tomb was broken open, revealing only the divine pillow inside.
This method allows one to **die temporarily**—another pillow must be crafted for **twelve more months**.
Inscribe this symbol facing **east before sunrise**, blowing *qi* twelve times onto the brush before writing.

---

**Earth False-Symbol (Tǔ Jiafu)**
Write this symbol in cinnabar ink, mixing it with **divine soil (shéntǔ)** and **half a *qián* of reishi powder**, forming pills resembling pellets.
After **one hundred days** of ingestion, one’s body moves like wind and clouds, ascending slopes and descending ravines.
If practicing the **divine symbol’s left and right techniques**, one may discuss life and death in this world.
When preparing to depart and transform others, avoid staying in **fire temples (huǒ’ān)**; always observe one’s reflection in a mirror, imagining the form and shadow absorbed, then inscribe it on the temple wall with ink.
For practitioners at **one hundred days**, ensure no one enters the room—**no women, chickens, or dogs may see this symbol**.
Face the **four directions**, absorb their *qi*, and blow onto the brush before inscribing.
Recite the **Pointing-Light Incantation** while holding the symbol:
*"Above, the East-flowing Pointing-Light;
Aromatic water enters, concealing ten thousand evils.
Three-two but—
Left, the Green Dragon; right, the White Tiger guard."*
**Brush Incantation**:
*"The brush as a sharp blade,
Cinnabar as a hundred medicines—
Where the divine symbol arrives, ten thousand evils vanish.
Urgent! As the Law commands—**expedite and subdue!**"*

**Secrets of the Three Caverns: Jade Spirit Great Emperor of the Celestial Heart**
**Graduated True Person’s Secret Precepts**

Heavenly marrow is the foundation of **Yin-Yang’s innate nature**—some are virtuous, some evil; some wise, some foolish.
Those who cultivate virtue are protected by heavenly spirits, while those who cultivate evil meet retribution, suffering misfortune.
As in ancient times, **Yellow Emperor** and all celestial beings below practiced this method to **save and transform living beings**, bestowing blessings from all the immortals.

The **hidden arts of concealing one’s form** have several methods, all paths to transcendence and gates to the **Great Dao**.
These texts were once transmitted orally by ancient **Dao/Way-masters**, never recorded.
This book was kept by the **Purple Micro Cavern Master**, later passed to **Wei FuRen**, then to **Xie ZiRan**, and finally to **Zhang Shi**.
Zhang Shi collected the texts, filling his home with symbols for three years.
One day, a messenger arrived midday with music—heavenly spirits had come to announce the decree, and the entire household ascended in broad daylight.
On that day, Zhang Shi hid the texts in **Zhongnan Mountain**, concealing them in **Yiwen**.
Only those with **host-fated Dao-heart** in this lifetime may encounter these precepts.
If worldly beings obtain this secret, they must **diligently practice for one hundred days**, safeguarding the fruit—**it will surely manifest divine efficacy**.

At that time, **Graduated True Person Bi Shangqing** transmitted this scripture to **liberate beings from suffering**, acting as the **bridge to supreme immortality**.
All who **resolutely practice for one hundred days** will see **unfailing results and responses**.

The name of my Dao is called the *Nine Luminaries Radiant Capital Secret Scripture*, concealing nine divine symbols that must not be lightly shown to others.

This scripture may be transmitted to only one or two persons after thirty years—do not lightly pass it to unworthy disciples. Those who study it will not easily grasp its essence. If one betrays and transmits it, they will forever fall into hell, unable to escape the Nine Realms, descending into the Avīci Hell to suffer endlessly, never again encountering the true scripture in ten thousand kalpas.

If worldly beings receive and uphold this text with resolve, they must do so in secrecy. If one who possesses the scripture does not share it, they will likewise fall for concealing it. Remember, remember.

If worldly beings practice this scripture and fulfill its precepts, their names will be recorded in the *Zifu* [Purple Bureaucracy], and they will rank among the True Immortals. If practiced at home, they must not let women or animals witness it, lest they fall and fail. Only those who conceal their practice, hide their form, or face persecution—whether by bandits, weapons, or malevolent spirits—those who aid the distressed or perform acts of mercy in myriad ways may achieve fulfillment.

Awaiting earnest devotion, they shall enter the ranks of the Celestial Officials, their merit beyond measure—words cannot fully describe it. To scorn this is to invite boundless sin.

This text is kept in strict secrecy.

**The inscribed talisman reads:**
*"Heaven round, Earth square—Nine-Two Celestial Chapter.*
*The divine pen descends; clouds billow, spirits obey.*
*I, in service to the Sovereign of the Northern Pole, Purple Microstar Emperor, decree with urgency as the law commands."*

**The daily invocation of the Six Wu Divine Spell:**
*"As the sun rises in the east, blazing with fire’s might,*
*The Six Wu talisman ascends on clouded script.*
*Riding the clouds, descending to strike down evil,*
*To banish calamity and dispel malevolence.*
*The Heavenly Gods aid me—ten thousand demons vanish.*
*I, in service to the Sovereign of the Northern Pole, Purple Microstar Emperor, decree with urgency as the law commands."*

**Talisman to Summon the Six Jia Gods Riding the Vermilion Steed:**
*Write this talisman in cinnabar ink, using water drawn from a well at dawn on a *Gengshen* day, before the sun rises. Hold the spell and chant as before.*

This method was once practiced by a True Person, who after three hundred days mounted the Vermilion Steed, invoking the Six Jia Heavenly Gods, and arrived at the Golden Staircase Hall. At that time, Emperor Wu of Han also witnessed it, astonished, and invited the master to drink. The master drank deeply, and suddenly, a fire erupted in the northwest. The master spat out wine to extinguish it. The Emperor then begged the master to stay, but the master refused, mounted the Vermilion Steed, and vanished.

If one in the world seeks to uphold this method, they must do so with resolve. If the precepts are fulfilled within three years, the method will respond.

**Talisman for Clear Departure and Dispersal of Shadows:**
*Follow the previous method of chanting and inscribing the talisman. After a hundred days of service, gaze at oneself in a mirror daily, driving away the form with incantations. Then, merge the body into the mirror’s reflection—no one will see you, or you may ascend to the rooftop of your home. Keep this secret.*

**Talisman to Scrutinize Life, Death, and Destiny:**
*Inscribe this talisman as before, invoking the Celestial Master to dispatch a celestial youth in dreams, who will urgently report its effects.*

This method was once practiced by Wang Qiao. Though many did not follow him in life, after his death, those who turned to true practice spread it across the city, and its divine efficacy became renowned.

**Talisman to Summon the Spirit and Leave the Shell:**
*After forty-nine days or a hundred days of inscribing and serving this talisman, hang one’s form and shell in various places, moving through objects to manifest the body’s shadow. This method is wondrous—fulfillment comes at a hundred days.*

**Talisman for Rebirth and Exchange of Dwellings:**
*Inscribe as before. After a hundred or three hundred days of service, if one despises their own aging or ugly form, they may take the corpse of a recently deceased person—sixty years old—whom they have personally seen. After the corpse is buried, provide small offerings to the deceased’s kin, ensuring the body is interred. Then, return to the home, perform the ritual, and strike yourself once. Embrace the newly deceased corpse. Shortly after, the spirit in the new body will awaken. Feed it a small portion of glutinous rice porridge, and it will recognize you. Return to the corpse’s burial site to tend to it secretly, ensuring no one knows. Then, bury it as before. If one wishes to reuse this method, it will surely respond.*

**Caution:** During practice, one must absolutely avoid women witnessing it. Keep this utterly secret.

**Driving the Three Corpses Away from the Body Talisman**
This talisman follows the previous method. After taking it for a hundred days, the Three Corpses will depart the body on their own, preventing confusion and disorder of the human mind. Once the Three Corpses are expelled, one attains the Dao of immortality and the rank of the Transcendent.

**Talisman of the Divine Sword to Seize Retribution**
This talisman follows the previous method. When inscribing it, one must recite a single incantation over the censer, then burn it to ash and swallow it with pure water over forty-nine days. This method relies on the practitioner’s accumulated virtue. When encountering vengeful spirits, malevolent ghosts, or any wrongdoers, use this talisman. Recite it over the censer once, then visualize the wrongdoer as before—when the intention is clear, retribution will be achieved.

Let those who first learn this method practice secretly, never allowing others to witness it. Keep this utterly concealed.

**Talisman to Drive the Six Wu Spirits and Divine Generals to Spray Clouds**
Before inscribing this talisman, there are additional incantations and methods for recitation. The talisman must be drawn on a day and hour corresponding to one’s birth year.

Seal off your bedroom with curtains, ensuring no wife, female relatives, or close kin witness it—lest the ritual be broken. Those practicing the preceding methods must also seal a pure chamber, using sixty lamps, six paper horses, and six portions of food.

After such preparations, select a *Gengshen* or *Jiazi* day to perform and recite the ritual. Invoke the Highest Jade Emptiness Emperor and the True Person of Supreme Worthiness, then keep this secret.

**Ghost Mirror**
For anyone wishing to swallow a talisman and drink water, seven days prior, use seven yellow paper-money and seven white paper horses to make offerings in a secluded chamber. On the seventh day, choose a *Gengshen* or full-moon day, before sunrise, facing east and bowing in worship. Burn the paper offerings, then let the talisman and water float before swallowing it.

**Method of the Adjusting-Spirit Talisman**
This method encompasses the Dao of the Three Realms and the Six *Jia* Flying Spirits, enabling one to foresee auspiciousness and calamity, avert aging and death, and know the origins of fortune and misfortune beforehand.

**Method to Invoke the Auspicious Spirit for Sacrifice and Response**

**Deranged Incantation**
May the stars fall,
May the sun sink,
May the mountains crumble,
May the earth split,
May the waters dry up,
May the fires extinguish,
May diseases vanish,
May all be at peace,
May the dead revive,
May iron harden.

**Heavenly *Jia* Talisman**
The Heavenly *Jia* Talisman—its master must know of celestial stars falling, solar and lunar eclipses, and the shifting of droughts and floods in the year. It ensures the five grains grow well and the four seasons are properly sacrificed to the tortoise.

The talisman transforms into the voice of a child, and beside it, the heart whispers the name of the calamity. The incantation is spoken, then the talisman is inscribed.

**Earthly *Jia* Talisman**
The Earthly *Jia* Talisman—its master must know of buried corpses, coiled springs, subterranean treasures, divine artifacts, and hidden caches that are difficult to locate. When this talisman is sacrificed, one will know the depths below.

The talisman transforms into a small boy. If there is treasure, he will appear. After finding it, the boy will not reveal his form.

When beneath the Big Dipper constellation, fully recite the incantation and sacrifice—he will then appear.

**Human *Jia* Talisman**
The Human *Jia* Talisman—if a household’s slaves or servants flee or disappear without trace, or if they return but their whereabouts are unknown, the master must know their location by sacrificing this talisman. It transforms into a boy who appears before them, and in their heart, they declare, *“I know their names and whereabouts—far or near, in every direction.”*

**Ghost *Jia* Talisman**

**Ghost *Jia* Talisman**
The Ghost *Jia* Talisman—when a household’s men, women, or children suffer from *xīnfēng* (heart-wind) demonic afflictions, ghostly harassment, phantom pains, tiger bites, chronic malaria, or ominous nightmares, the master must know their cause. By sacrificing this talisman, it transforms into a boy who stands before them and, in their heart, reveals the names and hidden whereabouts of the tormentors. Once dispatched to their proper homes, the afflicted will find peace.

**Divine Vision Talisman**
The Divine Vision Talisman—when encountering the *Xīn-Yǒu* days (sinister-hen days) at midnight, write this talisman in cinnabar ink on a five-*cùn* silk square beneath a lamp. Construct a three-tiered ash altar, place three lamps, two cups of water, a sword, and a censer of ash in a single layer. Place the Divine Vision Talisman within the censer, stand barefoot, and recite the incantation three times in sacrifice. Burn the talisman with the lamps, mix its ashes into water, and at dawn’s *yín* hour (3–5 AM), offer it as an oblation. With this, one will see all ghosts and spirits gathering their resources and departing.

**Buried Treasure Talisman**
The Buried Treasure Talisman—when a household is robbed by night thieves who scatter and flee, stealing all valuables, and the master seeks to track them down. Construct a three-tiered ash altar, place three swords, a mirror, a cup of tea, and a cup of pure water. Recite the incantation once in sacrifice.

**Incantation:**
*"With water toward the east—wood collapses.
Toward the south—fire is extinguished.
Toward the west—metal shatters.
Toward the north—water dries up.
Above—heaven’s pillar snaps.
Below—hell’s flames rage.
At the thief—swiftly crushed!"*

After the sacrifice, the thief’s spirit will arrive within three days, and the stolen goods will return to the doorstep.

**Tombstone Spirit Talisman**
The Tombstone Spirit Talisman—when a household’s river-drifted bones or tomb relics are lost and unlocated. Write the tomb talisman on a one-*cùn* silk square. At night, when the stars are fully aligned, set up the altar and perform the sacrifice. At dawn, when the sun rises, observe the flying talisman descending upon the grave—vanishing into the valley, transforming into a boy in the underworld, and arriving at the living’s dwelling. If the deceased was male, he appears as a male; if female, as a female. By examining the talisman, one will know the truth of the matter.

*Chaotic Heaven, Shifting Earth Method*

「All who possess this text and wish to practice it must first accumulate merit through good deeds for three years. Then, in strict observance of purity, bathe in fragrant water. Use a bolt of lightning to shock a piece of *zǎo* (枣) wood, carving it into twelve *Shén Yìn* (信印—"Divine Seals"). Conceal them on the first day of the first month, at the *zi* (子) hour, beneath the altar. Spread *bái máo* (白茅—"white millet grass") upon the ground, and arrange twelve portions each of *lù fǔ* (鹿脯—"dried deer meat"), fragrant tea, wine and fruits, lamps and candles, *tiān huā* (天花—"celestial flowers"), and *chāng pú* (菖蒲—"sweet flag"). Use *diàn jiǔ* (地酒—"earth wine," i.e., spring water) as well.

Set up the altar beside the victim, speaking not a word, and face the *Tiān mén* (天门—"Celestial Gate"). Do not allow others to witness. In a secluded, silent place, arrange the sacrificial offerings, then bare your head and grasp your sword, invoking the holy presence. In silence, recite the incantation seven times:

*"Tí hù gōu nà, yá chá zhēn wǔ,
xián má sā bó, tuó yǎn duō xiǎn,
yí chì yí chì, wū jīn xī xī duō duō!"*

Barefoot, with tongue bitten and blood spat, face the *Tiān mén* and press one seal upon it, declaring, *"Swiftly descend!"*

Black winds shall rise from the *Tiān mén*, accompanied by clanging arms. Suddenly, a *Dìng Tiān Shàng Dì* (顶天上地神人—"Earth-piercing, Heaven-toppling divine being") appears, brandishing a sharp spear, striking the victim’s very body. A dragon and tiger manifest, claws unsheathed and fangs bared, charging toward the victim. Fear not—bow your head and guard yourself with the *Hùshēn Zhēn yán* (护身真言—"True Words for Self-Protection"). They shall depart naturally.

The *Hùshēn Zhēn yán* are as follows:

*"Swiftly descend, auspicious fortune!
I now dare to bear it.
Those who assail me shall perish,
those who harm me shall die.
I descend with righteous law—
all saints shall descend with me.
As swift as the command, thus it is done!"*

With reverence, recite the incantation, remain still and unafraid. In time, the transformation shall occur: purple clouds gather at the altar’s edge. Kneel and offer wine and incense, and the *Ràng zhě* (王者—"Sovereigns") and *Shèng shèng* (上圣—"Supreme Saints") shall descend naturally, bestowing their blessings. With a pure heart and faithful devotion, complete the rites.

At dawn, consume the sacrificial offerings yourself. Those who drink shall follow the east-flowing water away—do not let others see. The seals measure two *cùn* (寸) and four *fēn* (分) in width, six *fēn* thick, stored in a brocade pouch. Never part from them, nor touch impurity. Violate the *Tiān xīn Shén yìn* (天信—"Celestial Faith Seal") and the twelve *Shén yìn* (信印—"Divine Seals"):

**The Twelve Divine Seals:**
*Tiān xìn yìn* (天信印—"Celestial Faith Seal"),
*Dì xìn yìn* (地信印—"Earth Faith Seal"),
*Rén xìn yìn* (人信印—"Human Faith Seal"),
*Lóng xìn yìn* (龙信印—"Dragon Faith Seal"),
*Hǔ xìn yìn* (虎信印—"Tiger Faith Seal"),
*Yún xìn yìn* (云信印—"Cloud Faith Seal"),
*Fēng xìn yìn* (风信印—"Wind Faith Seal"),
*Jīn xìn yìn* (金信印—"Metal Faith Seal"),
*Mù xìn yìn* (木信印—"Wood Faith Seal"),
*Shuǐ xìn yìn* (水信印—"Water Faith Seal"),
*Huǒ xìn yìn* (火信印—"Fire Faith Seal"),
*Tǔ xìn yìn* (土信印—"Earth Faith Seal").

Use these twelve seals in order, ensuring none are mixed—then their divine efficacy shall manifest. Those who know this text shall not abandon their mortal form, escape the *Liù dào* (六道—"Six Realms"), and awaken to the Daoist realm of immortals.

For any sudden calamity or perilous affliction, when one faces grave illness, use fragrant incense to pass over the seals, reciting one cycle. The disaster shall disperse instantly, turning ill fortune to good, removing calamity and averting misfortune.

**Celestial Faith Seal (天信印):**
This seal can open the heavens. When used to reverse the *Tiān* (天—"Heaven"), it can halt the sun, retain the moon, transform day into night, summon snow in summer or thunder in winter, and traverse the sun while observing the moon—all at will. Hold your left hand to *qián hài* (乾亥—"the *Qián* [乾] and *Hài* [亥] positions," i.e., the northwest), and with your right hand grasp the seal. Press it upon the *Tiān mén* (天门—"Celestial Gate"), facing the *Zhèn Tiān mén* (震天门—"Gate of Thunder"). Then, a Daoist maiden shall descend, fulfilling any request made.

If you wish to tour the *Rìyuè Gōng* (日月宫—"Palaces of the Sun and Moon"), first use the *Yún xìn yìn* (云信印—"Cloud Faith Seal"). After bathing in purity, lay out a clean mat, and press the *Yún xìn yìn* to summon clouds. Ascend the void to the Moon Palace. Then, use the *Tiān xìn yìn* to open the Moon Palace, where Daoist immortals and celestial boys shall bear you. When ready, seal it to return.

If you wish to turn day into night, press the seal into a water basin with the sun’s reflection—then the day shall sink into night. To retain the sun, use a bamboo rod to prop and illuminate it; the sun shall not dare move. To extinguish it, press the seal at the *Tiān nán jiǎo* (天南角—"southern corner of the heavens"), and in summer, snow shall fall. To stop, withdraw the seal. If you wish to summon thunder in winter, press the seal at the *Tiān xīn* (天心—"center of the heavens"), and the earth shall be shaken by thunder.

**Earth Faith Seal (地信印):**
This seal can move the earth, topple mountains, drain seas, subdue ghosts, and summon spirits. It can open mountains and construct rivers, carve trenches and sever ravines—all at will. To cause an earthquake, press the seal upon the *Dì hù* (地户—"Earth Portal," i.e., the southeast). To halt it, press the seal upon the *Tiān gāng* (天罡—"Celestial Lock," i.e., the northeast). Press the seal upon a mountain, and it shall collapse. Press it upon the sea, and it shall be drained. Press it upon ghosts or spirits, and they shall submit, the dragon and tiger shall be tamed.

If you wish to open a mountain, press the seal upon its peak, and a path shall appear. The mountain spirit shall guide the way. For calamity or danger, press the seal upon a great road, inscribing the *shuǐ* (水—"water") character at its center—then it shall become a river, impassable to ten thousand souls. If you wish to create a trench or ravine, press the seal upon a crossroad, and a ten-thousand-*zhàng* (丈) deep gorge shall form.

**Human Faith Seal (人信印):**
*Líng wàn shèng bǎo* (灵万胜宝—"Spiritual Victorious Treasure")
This seal can deploy armies and command men, ensuring endless triumph. It can transform a myriad variations—grasses, woods, metals, and stones—into human forms, concealing strange bodies, and entering at will. If you must confront an enemy and need men, encountering a forest, press the seal upon the first tree and spit water into it. The entire forest shall transform into soldiers, each bearing arms.

If you wish to vanish, hold seven stalks of pure grass before the door, facing it. First, take the *Qīxīng Yǔ bù* (七星禹步—"Seven-Star Yu Step"), and ten thousand souls shall be unable to perceive your form.

In urgent need, press the seal upon your head to become an old man, upon your feet to become a boy, upon your waist to become a woman, upon your face to become a running beast, or upon your arms to become a flying crow—all transformations shall manifest.

Press the seal upon your back to become a forest, upon your chest to become a great stone—all must be done with water. To enter stone, wood, or earth, press the seal accordingly, and you shall enter as desired. Press any object with the seal and water, and it shall vanish.

Keep purity, avoid carrion, and carry water with you. **Seven-Star Yu Step:**
*Hòu Tiān Bā guà* (后天八卦—"Post-Heaven Eight Trigrams")
*Xùn* (巽) for *Dì hù* (地户—"Earth Portal"),
*Kūn* (坤) for *Rén mén* (人门—"Human Gate"),
*Qián* (乾) for *Tiān mén* (天门—"Celestial Gate"),
*Gèn* (艮) for *Guǐ lù* (鬼路—"Ghostly Path").」

Treading the **Seven-Star Yu Step** (七星禹步), ten thousand men shall vanish, their forms unseen. When military needs arise, apply the seal thus:

**The Seal of the Returning Soul** (返魂卫药) — **Celestial Defense Seal**
This seal can subdue the **Dragon Treasure** (龙宝). To summon a dragon, press the seal upon an object of strange form, and it shall transform into a dragon, soaring through clouds and mist, its essence shifting between serpent and vermin. With but one seal, it shall swallow clouds and spew mist.

To become a dragon, take a white silk banner three *chi* in length. Seal its head and tail, inscribing *Dragon* (龙) at its center. Spray water three times and chant *"Hua!"* (变) three times—thus you shall transform into a dragon, riding as you will. To halt, press the seal upon the ground. To chase sea beasts, press the seal upon the water’s surface; the dragon or beast shall rise, to be driven at will.

To become a dragon yourself, press the seal upon your heart, swallow water three times, and speak *"Hua!"* (变) three times. Instantly you shall turn into a dragon, ascending upon clouds and mist, even to a thousand *li* away. Spray any object’s color with water and seal it—if you wish a great serpent, inscribe *Serpent* (蛇); if a dragon, inscribe *Dragon* (龙). All shall manifest as desired.

**The Tiger-Faith Seal** (虎信印) — **Subduing Tiger Treasure** (伏虎宝)
This seal can subdue and slay tigers, taming all ferocious beasts—mountain tigers, leopards, wolves, and strange creatures alike. It bears the **Tiger-Slaying Talisman** (杀虎符) and the **Mountain-Forbidding Technique** (禁山术), contained within a single scroll.

If a savage tiger in the mountains devours men and you call for woodcutters, take a red seal on silk and affix it to a tree. The tiger shall crouch beneath it, daring not to move. To kill, press the seal upon an iron plate and bury it beneath a dead tree. To compel the tiger, press the seal upon a peachwood board, wrap it in a green cloth, and wear it. The tiger shall follow, approaching like a lamb. If traveling far through mountain paths, press the seal upon a great stone. The mountains shall vanish near and far, the beasts gone a thousand *li* away.

To become a tiger yourself, press the seal upon your back, spray water, and chant *"Hua!"* (变)—thus you shall stand transformed into a tiger, the wind itself becoming its breath.

**The Cloud-Faith Seal** (云信灵印) — **Rising Cloud Treasure** (起云宝)
This seal can summon clouds and ascend to the heavens, conjuring five-colored auspicious clouds (五色祥云), riding them to the sky, and wandering among sun and moon, coming and going at will. With this seal, you may traverse the four great divine continents (四大神洲).

If one gains this seal’s method, pressing it beneath their feet shall generate clouds across the land. To ride the clouds, press the seal upward upon them—one seal raises one *zhang*, two seals raise two *zhang*. To descend, press the seal downward from above.

To ascend to the moon, observe strict fasting and purification (精诚斋戒), bathe in fragrant waters, press the seal upon the earth, and summon clouds to reach the moon. First use the **Opening Celestial Gate Seal** (开天门印). If the heavens rain unceasingly and you wish five-colored auspicious clouds, take green cloth, inscribe upon it the Five Directions’ metals—*Wood* (金), *Water* (木), *Fire* (水), *Earth* (火), *Metal* (土)—and press the seal’s characters above it. Thus shall the five-colored auspicious clouds arise.

**The Wind-Faith Seal** (风信灵印) — **Generating Wind Treasure** (生风宝)
This seal can summon mighty winds a thousand *li* away, aiding armies in crossing rivers or raising encampments against foes. It can stir sands and hurl stones, responding to any need.

In darkness and gloom, when forging the seal, employ the **Reverting Wind Seal** (回风印). Thus, if encountering enemies, take a jar or bowl, inscribe upon it in cinnabar *"Swiftly Generate Wind"* (速生风), and hurl it toward the sky. Pressing the seal upon it shall summon the wind swiftly, toppling mountains and snapping trees.

To cross water by ship, use the wind’s force as above. To summon darkness and gloom, direct the previous method toward the **Ghostly Gate** (鬼门) and press the seal upon it. A black wind shall rise instantly, obscuring day and night.

If caught in contrary winds, press the seal against the wind, inscribing *"Return"* (回) upon a bowl and hurling it skyward. The wind shall reverse.

**The Gold-Faith Seal** (金信灵印) — **Shattering Sword Treasure** (碎剑宝)
This seal can ascend metal and command iron, rendering white blades powerless. It can sever swords, bend spears, and nullify all knives and axes. Even crimson bows and arrows shall recoil upon approach, harming not a hair.

In battle, if you wish to hold the enemy at bay, press the seal in cinnabar upon a white silk banner seven times, burn it before the ranks, and stir the ashes into a bowl of pure water. Spray this upon the enemy.

When facing foes, press one seal upon each left forearm. They shall approach as if against cotton, blades unable to reach. All arrows shall be deflected, turning back upon their own bodies. To test its power, take five roosters, wrap them in a cage, and attach to one the seal’s *"Return"* (回) talisman at its wing. Shoot the roosters—only the one bearing the seal shall suffer no harm, proving its efficacy.

**The Wood-Faith Seal** (木信印) — **Reverting Wood Treasure** (返木宝)
This seal can summon all grasses and woods, even riding them through the air. It can employ wooden birds and beasts to carry grain and haul grass.

To ride a wooden beam, press the seal upon both ends, spray water, and recite *"Ji!"* (疾). The beam shall rise into the sky; to halt, chant *"Zhu!"* (住). If besieging an enemy camp and soldiers lack provisions, craft a wooden likeness of a flying crow (飞乌), affix the seal to its belly. The wooden bird shall depart for the camp, bearing grain back and forth, using water as before.

To build a lofty hall or grand residence, apply the seal as above. Travel by night as if by day, but reveal not its secret.

**The Water-Faith Seal** (水信灵印) — **Floating Wave Treasure** (泛波宝)
This seal excels in transforming water, overflowing rivers, summoning clouds and rain, redirecting wells and streams, or crossing seas by riding waves—all as desired.

To summon waves, sacrifice to water with a white horse and its foal, facing north. Press the seal upon an iron tablet and cast it into a river or stream. The waves shall not fail to rise, the thunder shaking them into great billows.

If crossing a vast river or stream, press the seal upon your shoes. To redirect water or reverse a river’s flow, press the seal upon the ground. The water shall come naturally.

**The Fire-Faith Seal** (火信灵印) — **Arrayed Yang Treasure** (列旸宝)
This seal can ignite flames a thousand *li* away, reducing forests to ash and mountains to embers. It can burn camps, scorch fortresses, and kindle fires that rise like marriage flames (姻). Even the sea shall boil beneath its fury.

**On the Use of Fire and Earth Seals**

For all uses of the Fire Seal, perform the rites at night.
To ignite flames a thousand *li* distant, press the seal upon the **Southern Homogeneous Direction** (丙), draw in the *qi*, and blow upon the seal while gazing toward the target. Fire shall erupt from the seal, scorching without bound. To extinguish it, use the Water Seal to quell the flames.

To burn dwellings, grass, or trees, press the seal upon **blue paper**, wrap it around a round stone effigy, and hurl it upon the structure—fire shall rise with no remedy.
To escape peril and alter one’s form, press the seal upon a great mountain stone, and it shall become a fiery mountain.

---
**The Earth-Faith Seal** (土信印) — **Arrayed Spring Treasure** (长春宝)
This seal can cultivate all grasses, grains, vegetables, melons, and fruits. It can transmute soil into gold and stone into jade.
When pressing upon the earth, sow seeds and spit once—roots shall form. Spit twice—stems shall grow. Spit thrice—the plant shall take shape. Spit four times—fruit shall set. Spit five times—the harvest shall ripen.
To cultivate all manner of trees and plants, likewise spit water: one spit per impression yields seven *chi* of growth; seven spits yield full maturity.
As before, press upon stone to make jade, upon earth to make gold, upon withered wood to sprout leaves, upon trees to bloom in winter, or to conceal oneself within jade—all shall manifest.

This text is **Heaven’s Secret Scripture**, a wondrous method beyond the mundane. Those who practice Dao and seek immortality, knowing this text, shall gain a decade’s worth of merit. Refining gold, concocting elixirs—all shall succeed.

All who practice the *Heaven’s Marrow Sacred Scripture* must observe strict purity: abstain from the **Five Pungent** (辛), avoid the **Six Calamities**, accumulate merit free of dust, and cultivate the virtue of the True Ones. Do not trifle with these sacred texts—defilement brings ruin. To pass this to unworthy disciples is a crime without end; this is a treasure worth ten thousand gold.

---
**The Heaven’s Marrow Chapter on Governing the Realm**
This text can govern nations, spread renown across the world, and grant boundless freedom—transforming with myriad changes, appearing and vanishing at will. Scatter beans to raise armies, scatter grass to summon steeds; one man shall repel a hundred foes. Command winds and clouds, rectify *qi* and complexion, turn day into night, reverse winds and halt rains, mend broken bones and severed sinews, and subdue all ghosts and spirits.

Hold the **Heavenly Circulation** (乾坤) beneath your gaze. To transcend the mundane and attain sainthood, this is the ladder to Heaven.
When practicing the method, accumulate merit by saving sentient beings, abstain from the Five Pungent, recite the Great Spell, revere the deities, conceal yourself from the world, and never reveal Heaven’s secrets. Understand its profound meaning, steadfast in heart and resolve—this method shall endure in the world.

**Ghost Valley Master** says: *The unworthy shall wield power over nations and armies.*
Do not divulge Heaven’s secrets—this is the name of the **Supreme Clarity True Person**.

When employing this method, first observe purity through fasting and bathing, maintaining strict cleanliness and sincerity. On **solitary, auspicious days**—the **5th of the 5th month, 7th of the 7th month, or 3rd of the 3rd month**—set up the **Ash Altar** in a secluded place beneath the **Northern Dipper**.

---
**The Ash Altar**
Three-tiered, the outer square measures **24 *chi*** in length, the innermost **12 *chi***. Place it beneath the Northern Dipper.
Set up the **Five Direction Flags** according to their respective cardinal points. Upon the altar arrange:
- Seven portions of **deer jerky**,
- Seven cups of wine,
- Seven portions of food,
- Seven portions of fruit,
- Seven lamps,
- Seven cups of pure water,
- Incense and flowers for offerings,
- **Wild mugwort** spread upon the ground.

Place the following **four hearts** at the altar’s edge:
- One **wild fox heart**,
- One **aged monkey heart**,
- One **wild magpie heart**,
- One **owl hawk heart** (蛩鷮).

Pour wine and burn incense, facing the Northern Dipper, dishevel your hair, grasp your sword, and recite the spell:

*"I humbly summon the Great Emperor True Martial General of the North Pole, swiftly descending to aid my divine power. Urgently bestow upon this altar, fragrant incense and precious offerings. I act under Imperial command, practicing law in the world. As the decree commands, swiftly and without delay."*

With devout heart, offer wine and burn incense. Soon, a **purple cloud** shall shroud the altar, and within its richness, a **green-clad foot** shall appear—do not be alarmed. Upon completing the rites, take the four hearts in a tray and, before the altar, intone:

*"Fox heart, resplendent and wise,
Monkey intent, pure and clear.
Knowledge of spirits, obey my command.
True soul shall not scatter,
Spirit essence shall live together.
Now committed to the mortar and pestle,
Your essence shall be ground to dust.
I now employ you—each shall fulfill its purpose.
As the decree commands, swiftly and without delay."*

After the rites, let the offerings be consumed by the cloud and carried away by the east-flowing waters.

With the mortar and pestle, grind the four hearts while reciting:

*"Herb of power, herb of might,
I invoke the Supreme Clarity.
Encounter man—let him die,
Encounter ghost—let it tremble.
A thousand grindings bring sanctity,
Ten thousand grindings bring spirit.
Descend true *qi*, let me ascend.
As the decree commands, swiftly and without delay."*

Pound a thousand times, then add the following ingredients and grind together:
- **Ghost Mortar** (鬼臼) – half *liang* of the deep-rooted kind,
- **Ghost Arrow** (鬼箭) – half *liang* of the aged kind,
- **Ghost Fan** (鬼扇) – half *liang* of the broken kind,
- **Ghost Supervisor** (鬼督邮) – half *liang* of the fluffy kind,
- **Realgar** (雄黄) – half *liang* of the finest,
- **Ginseng** (人参) – half *liang* of the shaped kind,
- **Fritillary Bulb** (茯神) – half *liang*,
- **Poria** (茯苓) – half *liang*,
- **Elephant Brain** (龙脑) – half *liang*,
- **Musk** (麝香) – half *liang*.

Grind into a fine powder, refine **thousand-year-old pine resin** into nine portions, and coat with **cinnabar** into pills the size of small bullets.

When preparing this elixir, **no chickens, dogs, women, or filial children** may witness or defile it. Store the pills in a **silk pouch** for flight and transformation.

On a **Jiazi day** at dawn, hold one pill in your left hand, recite the spell once, and swallow it with water adjusted by the **Open Heart Talisman**. Then recite:

*"Talisman water, pure and clear,
Form the body of transformation.
Enter my five viscera,
Aid my spirit essence.
Thousand years unaging,
Ten thousand years unshaken.
I now invoke this spell,
To exchange my mortal shell.
One gold pill—ascend to Heaven’s court.
As the decree commands, swiftly and without delay."*

---
**Burning the Open Heart Talisman into Ash for Ingestion**
This elixir is named **Shell-Swapping Pill** (换壳丹), also called **Ghost-Viewing Pill** (视鬼丹).

**Initial Dosage and Transformative Effects**
Upon taking the first pill, one may walk upon clouds in four strides. The five viscera and six fu-organs are penetrated and cleansed, inducing perspiration. Bathe in hot water afterward.

On the second day, take two doses. The body’s pores will feel as if pricked by needles, with heat and pain.

By the third day, expect to expel three to five *sheng* of blood—do not be alarmed, for this is the old blood and viscera being replaced.

By the seventh day, the elixir reaches the *diniwan* (lower dantian), replacing the marrow. The head will ache as if split—endure it without complaint.

**Pain-Relieving and Conception-Inducing Decoction**
Ingredients:
- Ginseng (*rénshēn*)
- Alisma (*zéxī*)
- Gypsum (*shígāo*)
- Red arrowroot (*chìjiān*)
- Licorice (*gāncǎo*)
- Aconite (*fùzǐ*)
- Aucklandia (*mùxiāng*)

Grind each into powder. Mix with two *qián* of frankincense water and take three doses daily until the pain subsides. **Never drink river water.**

By the hundredth day, you may take the elixir at will.

After twenty-seven days, your body will fully transform—light as air, vigorous in movement, eyes like jade peaches, face like red lotuses, swift as galloping horses.

By the thirty-seventh day, your mind will open: no knowledge remains unknown, no scripture unsolved. Your heart will be clear, your thoughts luminous, and your eyes will emit a yard of nocturnal light, visible for ten *li*. You will perceive ghosts and spirits, the sun and moon’s celestial rabbits, and foresee future calamities. Even deities will reveal themselves to you.

Upon completing the hundred-day regimen, you will achieve boundless transformations—sitting may lead to death, standing to immortality—all at your command.

---

**Transformation Talismans**
**Ghostly Form Talisman (Mengshou Fu)**
To assume a towering ghostly form a hundred *zhang* tall, swallow the talisman with water and declare, *"Grow to a hundred zhang, green-skinned!"*—all will tremble in fear.

**Ancient Sage Talisman (Laoteng Fu)**
To become an elderly sage, swallow the talisman with fragrant water and instantly become a silver-haired elder.

**Heavenly Concealment Talisman (Tianyin Fu)**
To vanish, swallow this talisman in daylight—you will become invisible to all. Repeat monthly.

**Battle-Victory Talisman (Zhansheng Fu)**
In combat, to render weapons ineffective, burn forty-nine copies of this talisman into ash, mix with thirty-five bowls of water, and administer to soldiers. Their bodies will become unharmed by blades, as hard as iron.

**Divine Army Talisman (Shenbing Fu)**
Before battle, use a censer, a bowl of pure water, seven black flags, and a drum. Soldiers must wear black robes over their heads, recite the spell, and inscribe the talisman while visualizing their true *Zhenwu* forms. Burn the talisman, chew the tongue, and mix the blood with the ash and water. Shake the flags, beat the drum, and command the troops to shout *"Shèng!"* A north wind will rise, and the soldiers will transform into towering, green-faced, black-armored generals—invincible against a million men.

**Caution:** Do not cross rivers. To do so invites disaster.

**Spell:**
*"Bingji Generals, aid my might!
Thousand soldiers bathe—transform divine!
Mountains crumble, seas dry up!
I bear the True Command—delay not!*
*As the decree demands, swiftly obey!"*

---
**Grass-and-Beans Military Method (Caodou Fa)**
To summon grass soldiers and bean horses for boundless warfare, free from worry:

On the **seventh day of the seventh month** or **fifth day of the fifth month**, draw an ash altar, prepare a fragrant tray with pure water, one *dou* and two *sheng* of large beans, and a bundle of clean grass. Place them at the altar’s center. With disheveled hair, recite the spell from midnight until the fifth watch, then seal the altar.

Daily, purify the room, burn incense, and recite the spell **four hundred ninety times**. Before deploying, silently chant it once. The method will take effect immediately.

From the altar’s center, sprinkle the grass and beans with fragrant water while reciting:
*"Heaven’s True Edict commands—
Grass and beans, obey my will!
Transform into divine soldiers,
March for my campaign!
Swiftly come, delay not!
Hear my sacred spell—
Assume your true forms!
A spray of divine water—
Grass becomes men, beans become horses!
As the decree demands, swiftly obey!"*

First, sprinkle the grass and beans with fragrant water while reciting the spell **seven times**, then spit. Declare over the grass:
*"Shelve! Shelve! Shelve! Shelve!"*
Then seal the altar.

Carry the *Tianluo Spell* for forty-nine days, reciting it a thousand times daily. Before each recitation, swallow one *Qilingshu* talisman (written in cinnabar at dawn, burned to ash, and taken with water). Then chant the spell.

**Tianluo Spell:**
*"Om! Qie Sa Fo, Om! Xi Sa Fo,
Yixia fenfen zhu zhu,
Chike □ nie ya tuo,
Zhituoluo tuoluo om,
Wanglu wanglu yan,
Wuyi yadu, bodu bolu,
Luniemancha luo,
Hun gouna xie."*

When reciting, observe strict fasting, bathe, and burn incense. Complete a thousand recitations over forty-nine days.

Take one hundred twenty stalks of grass and one *sheng* and two *ge* of large beans. In a secluded place, scatter the grass widely where no one treads.

Test the method by silently reciting the spell once, wearing the talisman on your head, and spraying water. With a knife, draw seven *zhang*-tall figures and five *zhang*-tall horses in the grass. Adjust numbers as needed.

If the spell is complete after forty-nine days, you will hear the voices of the grass soldiers—this is verification.

**Deployment Rules:**
When using transformed soldiers in battle, avoid:
- **East** (forests),
- **West** (metal),
- **North** (mountains).

Adhere strictly to these precautions—this is the true **Five Transformations Reversal Method**.

When practicing this method, ordinary mortals must remember to reverse calamities—call swiftly and respond swiftly.

If encountering the *jiǎzǐ* decadal period, invoke the **Six Jia Gods**, using silver coins and a fine horse to sacrifice on your natal day, following the military commandments with utmost precision and solemnity.

If you obtain the upper scroll, all offenses against prohibitions or the blood of childbirth will be harmless.

Those who have studied the **Six Ren and Escape of Jia** will know their own fortunes’ reversals and sequences.

To restore original form, recite the spell backward once, then chant the return incantation once: *"Grass and bean, spirit and vital—return to your true shapes."* By this, they will dissolve into grass and beans. The return incantation reads:

*"Grass and bean, responsive and bright,
Swiftly dissolve to your original forms.
I now decree with this spell,
Each returns to the **Tàiqīng** realm.
Call swiftly, arrive swiftly—
All wishes fulfilled.
As the **Lǜyìng** commands."*

After completing the incantation, spray water and scatter the talismans—then they will vanish.

If soldiers require horses, they may silently implore the **Língshén** temple, burning incense and borrowing a paper horse. With a crimson thread, bind it to the paper horse’s hoof, and when truly needed, it will respond as if ridden. After the night, feed it with grass as before. Avoid impure water or filth nearby—this would ruin the method.

**Borrowing Horse Incantation:**
*"Swiftly implore the responsive spirit to borrow the dragon-horse,
Its hooves tread the azure clouds,
A thousand leagues cross the dusty river.
As the **Lǜyìng** commands."*

In the temple, burn incense and bind the paper horse with crimson thread upon completion.
A thousand leagues in a day, tireless—
When crossing water, unbind it,
Then rebind once passed.
If encountering foes without weapons,
Each may seize small sandstones or clay bricks,
And hurl them toward the enemy ranks—
They will self-destruct,
Their strength multiplied a hundredfold.

If supplies run low, write the **Open Intestines Talisman**, burn it to ash, and drink it in water—
Then hunger and thirst will vanish,
Strength increased tenfold,
And no hunger for a hundred days.
Once the horse has been used,
Apply the **Open Intestines Talisman** again—
As before, no harm will follow.

But those who practice this must have the **Pure and Tranquil Eye** elixir,
Their minds open to understanding each principle,
And verify its use with precision—
No error, no failure.

**Open Intestines Talisman**
**Pure and Tranquil Eye Talisman**

For those who seek transcendence beyond the mortal world,
This is the **Book of Dao/Way** for immortals,
The path to eternal life—
Do not pass it to descendants,
Nor reveal it for a thousand gold.

**Tàixuān**’s profound art,
**Yùdì**’s sacred script.
Burn incense, chant the spell—
Demons flee, spirits tremble.
If given to a worthy soul,
Boundless blessings follow.
Piercing the mysteries of **Qiánkūn**,
Mastering the **Wǔxíng**’s reach,
Discerning the **Yīnyáng**’s reversals.
If passed through ages,
It will safeguard the realm,
Assist the sovereign,
Preserve the world—
Eternal life granted,
None shall know its common ways.
Able to grasp the **Tian**’s intent,
Skilled in deciphering the spirits’ designs.

Those who obtain this book must store it in a brocade pouch,
Ever keep it revered,
Hidden in sacred peaks,
Caverns, or cliffside shrines.
After three to five years,
Fragrant vapors will rise from this place,
Numinous flowers and herbs grow naturally,
And gold and jade take form.

For all who suffer from malevolent spirits,
Or are ensnared by **xiémièi wāngliàng**,
**húliè shānmèi**—
Burn this book with incense and illuminate it,
And all calamities will flee to distant lands,
Their bones crushed, forms shattered—
No spell fails.

If a sincere disciple seeks to pass this on,
They must first observe strict **zhāijiè**,
Maintain purity without licentiousness,
Devote their heart in faith and ritual,
Swear before the **Tiānzūn**,
And accumulate virtuous deeds to aid others—
Then they may teach.

If passed to the vulgar and unworthy,
Disaster will strike nine generations.

Among all things in the world,
Humans are the most numinous and precious,
Mirroring **Tiān** and **Dì**,
Born of **Wǔxíng**’s transformation,
Shaped by **Yīnyáng**’s interplay,
Their vitality and essence perfected.

Thus, though they borrow forms and complete their cycles,
With life and death,
Even the **Shàngshèng Dìjūn** cannot alter this—
Their spirits return to the cosmos.

Yet many fools persist,
Ignorant of the **Zàohuà**’s workings,
Some ingesting **jīnshí**,
Hoping to shed their shells and ascend.
Some cultivate **qi** and vitality,
Seeking longevity in this world.
Some follow heretical teachings,
Dwelling in mountains and fasting.

Yet even among immortals’ methods,
There are those who ascend and those who remain.
Those who gain this book are born of luminous wisdom in past lives,
Their **shèngtǐ** nurtured beyond mortal dust,
Sensing the **Miaojué** of humanity,
**Tian** bestows eternal guardianship,
Unveiling the **Yuan**’s mysteries,
Clarifying the **Shèng**’s intent.

Such is the truth—
In ten thousand, not one errs.

Fools who do not grasp the **Shènglǐ**,
Blindly imitating the enlightened,
Madly forcing the **Shèng**’s will,
Their bones turn white through endless kalpas,
Exceeding the **Xūmí** peaks,
Their spirits wander lifeless through ages,
Hungry ghosts of the **Běimáng** slopes.

Again, they do not know death’s limits loom near,
Chasing longevity in vain,
For even worldly immortals
Have bounds to their practice,
Years to await.

Ancient and modern mortals
Know life but not death,
Clinging to dust like the blind ascending mountains,
Dwelling in the world like night travelers crossing waters.

Some regret their folly too late,
Drowning in suffering’s sea.
I would not leave this art in the world.

**Method of Verification:**
For those who seek eternal life and worldly dwelling,
They must first know their fate’s distance—
Only then may they cultivate the **True Dao** and nourish their lives,
Erase their death records,
Leave no trace in the **Yīnbù**,
Add their names to the **Yùcè**,
And enter the **Xianxiang** without end.

**Right: Verification of the Guardians.**
First, observe **zhāijiè** and bathe for seven days.
On the third day of the third month, before sunrise,
Take an axe and blade to the mountains,
And gather **jīngzhàng** branches—one hundred twenty stalks,
Each twelve inches long.
Bind them with five-colored threads,
Wrap and suspend them in the southeast corner—
Do not let them touch impurity.

Again, on the fifth day of the fifth month, before sunrise,
Gather twelve stalks of **dùjīng**,
Each twelve inches long,
Bind them with five-colored threads,
Wrap and suspend them in the northwest—
Do not let them be defiled.

On the seventh day of the seventh month, before sunrise,
As before, gather thirty stalks of **jīngzhàng**,
Each seven inches long,
Bind them with five-colored threads,
And suspend them in the northeast—
Do not let them be violated.

On the ninth day of the ninth month, before sunrise,
Again gather twelve stalks of **dùjīng**,
Bind them with five-colored threads,
Wrap and suspend them in the southwest—
Do not let them be sullied.

The fourfold ritual—suspended **jīngzhàng** and **dùjīng** in their respective cardinal directions—must remain untainted, unseen by others.

On the first day of the twelfth month, at night, retrieve the four directional **jīngzhàng** from the purified chamber. Offer them with incantations, keeping the lamps burning through the night.

Use seven red-flower oil lamps, twenty-one **jiāngxīn** (wax wicks) subjected to nine steams and nine sun-bakes, lighting seven lamps. Offer seven portions each of incense, flowers, fruit, tea, and pure water.

From the first night of the month, offer the **pànzhàng** (judgment rods), burning incense continuously and reciting the spell seven times, fumigating the **jīngzhàng** with it. The incantation reads:

*"Spiritual **jīngzhàng**, mighty **jīngzhàng**,
Earth and wood flourish in growth.
The Five Powers now summon you—
I command you to know this:
The fate of the year [so-and-so],
Now bound in spiritual **jīngzhàng**.
Manifest in the tenth month,
Vanish when the limit is reached.
I now invoke this spell—
Obey my command as law.
Swiftly, as the precepts decree."*

From the first night of the twelfth month onward, maintain the ritual offerings and recite the spell seven times without interruption.

By the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month, on the eve of the New Year’s dawn (fifth watch), light seven lamps, combining them into eleven. In seclusion, unseen by others, kneel facing northwest and recite the spell once. Sit upright, holding the lamps, and illuminate a pair of white jade discs placed to the south.

Alternatively, veil your face and take the first batch of **120 jīngzhàng** (excluding the current year’s count). Hold one stalk toward the lamp—when its shadow appears on the wall, pass it over. Repeat with another stalk in the same manner. When the year of one’s death arrives, if the **jīngzhàng**’s shadow does not appear, record it.

Next, take the second batch of twelve **xíngzhàng** (punishment rods), fumigate them with incense, and intone:
*"I solemnly declare to the **dùjīng**—
Grant my plea in this lunar month.
As before, illuminate them—
When the limit is reached and no shadow appears, record it."*

Proceed likewise with the third batch of thirty stalks, reciting the invocation until no shadow manifests—record it.

Then take the fourth batch of twelve stalks, reciting the invocation as before. When no shadow appears at the limit, meticulously record it in writing.

Burn the **jīngzhàng** in a cauldron, offering the ashes in sacrifice and scattering them into flowing water.

Through accumulated merit and practice, when the allotted year, month, and day arrive, employ the *Ghost Valley Master’s Revival Technique* to avert death. Erase your name from the death registry, achieve immortality, and dwell in the world. If the year is forgotten, enter the Dao of the Immortals, aligning with Heaven and Earth, equal in years to mountains and rivers.

Since ancient times, accomplished sages have practiced this method, attaining longevity and fulfillment.

**The Revival Technique to Avert Death:**
Before the allotted year, month, and day, observe strict fasting and purification. In a clean chamber, lay out a mat two inches thick and a pillow seven inches high. Face south, abstain from food and speech, and lie down for seven days while ingesting the *Locking the Intestines Talisman*.

On the day before the limit, at the burial site, dig a pit two *zhang* (twelve feet) deep. Place a coffin before the grave, filling it with one *sheng* (eight ounces) each of the five grains and two *ge* (two ounces) of rice. On the appointed day, lie within the coffin, facing south, feet extended.

At the critical hour, don the *False Death Talisman*, place the five grains inside the coffin, and at the *chen* hour (7–9 AM), scatter your hair. With your right hand, grasp a handful of yellow earth, and hold a mouthful of water and rice in your mouth. Your left hand should form the *Gān-Hài* (乾亥) earth trigram.

Exit the grave toward the Ghost Gate, stepping on the *Seven-Star Yu Step* as you depart—never look back. Your name will be erased from the underworld registry, and your name inscribed on the Jade Roll, though mortals will see you as dead.

This is the *False Death Revival Technique*—do not divulge this celestial secret.

During the Tang dynasty, a military officer named *Dú Wēng* practiced this technique and lived for 927 years before ascending in broad daylight on a red crane.

Later scriptures of the immortals make no mention of this art.

The *Seven-Star Yu Step* and *Locking the Intestines Talisman* are recorded at the beginning of this scroll and are not repeated here.

The *False Death Talisman* is enclosed in the preceding section. Use the earth in your palm and the rice in your mouth, discarding them at a distance of 120 steps—no fear shall come.

**False Death Talisman:**
The preceding talisman must be used in the twelfth month while abstaining from nourishment. Write it in vermilion and place it in the coffin, aligning it with your form—thus, you will not see your own death.

**Divine Elixir of Transformation:**
This is a divine and wondrous formula, containing miraculous techniques that communicate with spirits and verify the sacred. It astonishes the ears and startles the eyes—summoning summer snow and winter thunder, conjuring clouds and rain, concealing form and altering appearance, extending life in white vitality. Some say it is the essence of alchemical refinement, the profundity of celestial scriptures. The unenlightened, obtaining it, rejoice exceedingly.

As with the magnet drawing needles, amber attracting dust, the *River Chariot* subduing mercury, the *Rú-ěr* (褕耳) extracting gold, the *yang yu* (阳燧) capturing fire, the otter’s bile dividing wine, crab yellow gathering rats—are these not marvels beyond mortal skill? It is because medicinal natures support one another, and *qi* affinities resonate in harmony, making such feats possible.

This formula was recorded by Ghost Valley Master and combines earlier techniques. Those who have verified its efficacy often omit it, deeming it the supreme secret of alchemical arts.

Extracting the *Tàiqīng* (太清) Mysterious Chapter, it employs the *Mòzǐ* (墨子) essence of the heart, searching the world for the subtlest medicinal arts. Thus, the *Heavenly Marrow Divine Elixir* was refined, restoring essence and vitality.

If one exists who has died but not yet decayed within seven days, administering a single pill will revive them without fail. If a dying person is given one pill, they will surely recover. With three pills placed in the mouth, they will revive in moments. Even if administered through the teeth, life will return.

Against malevolent spirits, carrying a single grain will drive them away.

Before preparation, strict fasting and purification are required.

If taken by a healthy person, it grants longevity and immortality—named the *Tàiyī Returning-Soul Pill*.

**Ingredients:**
- *雄黄* (Realgar): 12 *fèn* (分)
- *雌黄* (Orpiment): 12 *fèn*
- *丹砂* (Cinnabar): 12 *fèn*

Place the ingredients in a living bamboo tube and bury it underground.

For **Cinnabar** (*Dan sha*), use a bamboo tube buried on the **south side**; for **Orpiment** (*Ci huang*), place it nearby; and for **Realgar** (*Xiong huang*), position it at the center, each in its own bamboo tube. Seal the openings with **mica powder** (*Yun mo fen*), cover the top with three inches of soil, and burn with **ash-fire** (*Hui huo*) for seven days and seven nights until it transforms into **liquid essence** (*shui hua*). If it has not yet transformed, exhale **fire-qi** (*huo qi*) upon it again, and take it when the desired effect is achieved.

Next, gather the three **liquid essences** (*san shui*) and place them in a **copper vessel** (*tong qi*), leaving it in the **dew** (*lu*) overnight and retrieving it at dawn.

Then, take **well water** (*jing shui*) from three feet deep and mix it with **five *sheng*** of **powdered *Tian xiong*** (male Realgar or *Strobilanthes cusia* powder), refining the **elixir** (*xiu yang yao*). When it turns **red**, shape it into **twelve *sheng*** of **koi fish scales** (*li yu mu*), storing it in a **large golden vessel** (*da jin qi*). Nurture it with **aged pine roots** (*bu lao song gen*) for three years before using it in ritual.

Collect and store it according to the previous **secret method** (*mian fa*) to command **spirits** (*ling hun*).

**Summoning and Subduing Spirits** (*Qu yu ling hun*)
For all methods using **paper effigies** (*zhi ren*), one must first understand the **mechanisms of ghosts and gods** (*gui shen zhi ji*).

When summoned, they will appear at will, entering and exiting the kitchen, moving freely east and west, and taking whatever is desired. First, identify the **transgressor** (*fan fa zhi ren*) who is about to die. If they have previously consumed alcohol or food, note their **name, surname, age, month, day, and hour** (*ming xing, nian yue ri shi*). If you wish to meet them before their execution, offer **money and paper** (*qian zhi*) to persuade them with wine. The transgressor must then express gratitude, and you will secretly instruct the condemned person in their mind. The condemned will say: *"No debt—it is your luminous spirit (*ling ming*) that compels me to visit you."*

Once the condemned understands, give them a **Gather-Spirit Talisman** (*ju hun fu*) along with the pill, and secretly toss the pill into the wine. After drinking, say: *"You wish your fate to be sealed—your voice has summoned me here."* The condemned will then appear at the **execution grounds** (*fa chang*), fifty steps away, where you hold a **large mirror** (*da jing*) one foot wide, its face inscribed with the **Summon-Spirit Talisman** (*zhao hun fu*). If they are about to be beheaded, recite the **incantation** (*zhou*) upon seeing them.

**Incantation** (*Zhou*):
*"I humbly invoke the transgressor from the North—one *qi* (*zhi yi*)."*
Recite this three times, then blow their **spirit-qi** (*hun po*) into the mirror. Wrap the mirror with **white silk** (*bai lian*) and take it to a **pure chamber** (*jing shi*).

This night, offer **three cups** (*san zhan*) of **fragrant wine** (*xiang wei jiu*) and **delicious food** (*mei shi*) in sacrifice. Place the mirror beside a lamp and recite:
*"True spirit (*zhen hun*), luminous and clear, quickly manifest your original form (*ben xing*).*
*I now sacrifice to you—use the voice that summoned me.*
*Do not scatter your spirit (*hun po*), but save yourself and return to life (*huan sheng*)."*

After reciting, hold the mirror before the lamp, calling out their **name and surname** (*ming xing*), and present the **sacrificial wine and food** (*jiu ji shi*), along with a **colorfully painted likeness** (*cai hua qi xiang*). In darkness, continue to sacrifice them with **incense and flowers** (*xiang hua gong yang*).

If you wish to employ them, cut a **paper effigy** (*zhi ren*) seven inches long, summon their name, and have it stand before them. If they respond without hesitation, prepare seven such effigies to animate and command them.

The **Summon-Spirit Talisman** (*Zhao hun fu*) and **Return-Spirit Talisman** (*Gui hun fu*) will prevent their spirit from scattering, allowing them to be **nine libations** (*jiu yin*)—a ritual offering of nine cups.

「On the first day of the sixth month, collect seven maggots from the mouths of young cranes (*luán cháo*) in their nests, and seven glowworms (*yíng huǒ chóng*). On the third day of the third month, gather fourteen *kēdǒu* (a type of beetle), and dry them in the shade.

Crack open crow eggs (*wū luǎn*), discard the yolks, and retain the clear parts. Seal them before they are fully immersed, and place them under a hen for incubation. The hen will crow when the process is complete.

Store the collected materials in a concealed vessel. When using, take one large soybean and apply saliva (*jīn tuò*) to the top of it. At night, it emits a radiance a hundred feet long, and by day, a purple cloud appears.

If placed in the fingernails, the nails will glow like arrows when pointed at objects.

For shooting purposes, mix the medicine with toad blood (*chán xuè*) and apply it to the body. At night, it forms a glowing mass; when placed in the mouth, saliva will also ignite.

Prepare the medicine on *liù jiǎ rì* (the sixth day of the sixth lunar month). If you wish to burn all dwellings and structures, or any specific objects, write the formula with a single *rìyuè* (a unit of weight, roughly 3.75 grams) of the medicine and apply it. By night, it will ignite, leaving no means of salvation.

If you place a small stone with a bit of the medicine inside a well, fire will arise, yet the well water will remain unharmed.

To summon the *máo xiàng* (hairy apparition, or spirit form), and manifest white *qì* (vapor/essence):
Whenever one desires to display a hairy apparition between the eyebrows or generate white vapor from the crown, this is the work of the ancient sages (*xiān shèng*), not something common folk can undertake.

The medicine used here is also derived from the essence of the sun and moon (*shòu rìyuè zhī jīnghuá*), the refined *qi* (vital energy) of heaven and earth (*tiān dì zhī xiùqì*), and the bait of things (*chéng wù zhī ěr*), capable of transforming and creating.

Thus, Master Ghost Valley (*Guǐgǔ xiānshēng*) kept this technique secret, never revealing it.

*Zhēnyáng* (true yang stone): ten *zhǔ* (a unit of weight, roughly 3.75 grams).
*Yúnmǔ* (cloud mother stone): seven *zhǔ*.
*Bái yīng* (white eagle stone): four *zhǔ*.
*Qiān bái shuāng* (lead white frost): one *fēn* (a tenth of a *liǎng*, roughly 0.375 grams).
*Hǎi fú* (sea float stone): one *qiǎn* (a unit of weight, roughly 3 grams).

All the above ingredients should be washed with warm wine (*wēn jiǔ*) on a *gēngshēn rì* (a day in the sexagenary cycle bearing the characters 庚 and 申), then ground into powder. On the *xīn rì* (the next day in the cycle), use the white toad (*bái chán é chī*) with eight characters inscribed on its throat, and place its intestines in the center.

Additionally, take two large *hǎi lí gé* (sea snails, similar to clams), grind them into a paste the size of one *hé* (a unit of volume, roughly 1/10 of a *shāng*, about 10 ml). Seal the paste with honey and place it in spring water, nurturing it for seventy-seven days until the medicine is complete, marked by the white vapor gathering from the spring.

If the days are insufficient, and there is still water in the seal, take it out, wipe it dry, and use wax to secure and reseal the container. Leave it, and it will naturally complete.

Remove the sea snail and toad, and use only the medicine, storing it in a silver dish without letting any air in.

If you wish to manifest the hairy apparition, place a grain of the medicine the size of a hemp seed (*má zǐ*), apply saliva to it, and place it between the eyebrows. A white light will appear, and the apparition will shine radiantly.

If you place a grain the size of a rice kernel in tea or wine, a light will rise from the cup several feet high.

Placed on the finger and exposed to sunlight, a white glow will emanate from the fingertip.

Placed on various objects, it will also manifest light.

This is the *Dēngbō Wèi* (Illuminating Barrier Technique).」

The following methods are recorded:

For the **Illuminating Barrier Technique (登波卫)**:
Take ten black spiders on the fifth day of the fifth month. If the day arrives and they are difficult to obtain, distribute people beforehand to capture them. At dusk on that day, place them in a dry container with two *hè* of pig fat inside; the spiders will consume the fat completely.

On the seventh day of the seventh month, take seven *shuǐmǎ* (water horses)—those with long legs growing on water—and mix them with the aforementioned insects in a bottle. Bury the mixture in the north, letting it dry in the shade for a hundred days. When the medicine is ready, place it in a bamboo tube. In cases of urgent river crossings, apply a knife-shaped piece of the medicine to the soles of the feet; walking on water will then be as easy as stepping on large stones.

For **Opening the Gate Technique (启扉卫)**:
At midnight on the *jiǎnrì* (established day, i.e., the first day of the month), take wood from a younger brother’s grave, cutting it with the *Yǔbù* (Turtle Step) ritual stance. Facing north, carve it to a length of seven *cùn* and three *fēn*, then conceal it in a five-colored garment. Use it to part one’s hair, then rub the door or lock with it—they will open automatically, including all keys.

Additionally, on the fifth day of the fifth month, collect the tongue and teeth of a black dog, drying them in the shade. Rub a person’s hands with tiger fat, and at the appointed hour, they may enter a household unseen. Grasping a dog’s tail, the dog will neither bark nor bite; outsiders will be unable to rise, and sleeping people will remain unaware. Do not reveal this to others—this method is to be kept secret.

**Shell-Shedding, Manifesting True Form Technique (脱壳现形术):**

For those practicing this technique, first arrange a seat in a quiet chamber with a large mirror hung before it. Beginning from the *jiǎzǐ* day (first day of the sexagenary cycle), each day face the mirror with a pure mind, maintaining awareness of one’s form in reflection—whether standing, sitting, or lying down—imagining the true self within. In the morning, first take the *Fēnshén Sǎn* (Dividing Spirit Powder), then refine the spirit. For forty-nine days, consistently visualize leaving one’s spirit in the mirror. Inscribe a *Xiànxíng Fú* (Manifesting Form Talisman) on the mirror’s surface, burying it at the main gate seven *chǐ* and seven *cùn* deep in a jar, sealed with a lid.

When ready to manifest the form, take a small mirror, inscribe the talisman on its surface, blow onto it once, and suspend it in the room. Moving freely east or west, one’s body will remain in the chamber—sitting, lying, or standing as desired. Retrieving the mirror will cause the reflection to vanish, while others will see only a single body.

**Dividing Spirit Powder (炼壳分神散):**
- One whole *shétuìpí* (snake shed skin), collected on the fifth day of the fifth month.
- Seven whole *chánké* (cicada shells), collected on the sixth day of the sixth month.
- One *liǎng* of *lónggǔ* (dragon bone), collected on the seventh day of the seventh month.
- One *liǎng* of *báifúpíng* (white poria).
- One *liǎng* of *fúpíng* (poria).
- One *liǎng* of *yuǎnzhì* (polygala).
- One *liǎng* of *rénshēn* (ginseng).
- One *qiān* of *xūnlùhuā* (aloe).
- One set of *fúyìxīn* (bat wings), washed with wine and dried.

Grind these into a fine powder. Each dose: one *qiān*. When taking the medicine, do not blow or stir it. After ten days, drowsiness will appear—this is the sign of efficacy. Complete the regimen in forty-nine days without repetition; any remaining powder should be buried with the mirror.

**Manifesting Form Talisman (现形符):**
Inscribe this talisman with cinnabar on the mirror, visualizing oneself within it. Blow *qi* onto the talisman—your image will naturally appear there. When writing this talisman, avoid touching it.

With unwavering sincerity, refine the form within the mirror. Forty-nine days are required for completion. If not practiced with reverence, success will be difficult.

To divide the body as described earlier, sit leaning against a wall with the mirror hung low, lie with the talisman horizontally, or stand with it suspended high—always visualizing the self as instructed.

**Changing Appearance (异容):**
If one faces sudden, unforeseen disaster and cannot yet complete the techniques, this method allows for rapid transformation to evade a single calamity. Take:
- One *lìzǐ* (straw hat).
- One *fēn* of *shāohàodān* (burning number elixir).

**Changing Appearance (异容) – Continued:**

- White horse hoof nails, one, burned to ash.
- *Sàzi* flower, dried in shade.
- Old *zhānglù* deer root, two *liǎng*.
- Bat wings, one pair, burned to ash.

Combine these six ingredients into fine powders. Place half within a green gallbladder, suspending it at the eastern gate for seventy days.

If urgent, take a kernel-sized portion of the powder, mix with saliva, and apply to the face. The next day, even wife and son will fail to recognize you. Stir the remaining powder with the face toward the east, never sleeping, never stirring it while eating, never blowing on it—your household will not recognize you.

---

**Knowing the Hour of Death (知命丹):**
If one cultivates the Dao and practices the Way, one must know when death approaches. This elixir proves its efficacy.

Perhaps seven days before death, the medicine will emerge from the nostrils, revealing divine and sacred essence.

- Cinnabar, one *qián*.
- Realgar, one *qián*.
- Frankincense, one *qián*.
- Green wood fragrance, one *qián*.
- Styrax, one *qián*.
- *Fúshén* (possibly *Fúshén* root or *Fúshén* herb), one and a half *qián*.
- *Yuánzhì* (polygala), one *qián*.
- *Shíwéi* (possibly *Shíwéi* stone or *Shíwéi* herb), one *qián*.
- *Bìchéngjié* (possibly *Bìchéngjié* herb), one *qián*.
- Ginseng, one and a half *qián*.
- Lotus seeds, seven.
- *Tàiyī Yǔyúliáng* (possibly *Yǔyúliáng* stone or mineral), one.

Gather these twelve ingredients according to local soil conditions, purifying them thoroughly.

On a *jiǎzǐ* day at the *chén* hour, ensure no chickens, dogs, women, or others witness the process. Face south, remain silent, grind and sift into a powder, and knead with rock honey into a block. Recite the edict of the Three Pure Ones (Sanqing) thirty thousand times, grinding it thirty thousand times, then place it in a southeast well, one *chǐ* above the water.

By the *wùzǐ* day, form into pills the size of a rooster’s head. On the next *jiǎzǐ* day at the *chén* hour, face east, burn incense, and recite your natal star’s official name three hundred times before swallowing one pill with water. Abstain from the five pungent spices, alcohol, meat, and sexual activity.

Seven days before death, the medicine will emerge from the nostrils, or a person will reveal it in a dream. From the time of ingestion until death, no illness will afflict you—you will ascend seated or standing. Keep this secret.

This text is the marrow of the world’s profound writings, transcending the mundane from ancient times to now. Those who govern nations and are high sages all find it supremely wondrous, understanding celestial patterns and attaining the ultimate Dao. To obtain this is not mere chance—it is predestined fate. None may casually view it; its blessings are boundless. Those who safeguard it will prosper. Though gold and jade exist, they are not true treasures. True treasures are divine kings, flourishing for ten thousand generations. Keep this secret.
