**Preface to *The Divine Immortals’ Method for Refining the Elixir and Forging the Three Primordial Treasure Mirrors***

Guigengzi was the sobriquet of a scholar who met with no success in his time.

In my youth, I studied both literary and martial arts and was drawn to extraordinary techniques. Upon reaching the age of maturity, I passed through Liang and arrived in Zheng, wandering among the peaks of Song and Sha. Resting beneath a great tree, I encountered an old man of perhaps eighty years, his brows and eyes clear, his spirit serene and unhurried. I bowed and sat with him upon a stone, and after some time in conversation, he spoke much of emptiness and transcendence.

He said to me, “My dwelling is not far. You may come and visit.” I assented and followed him. There, I saw only ancient trees and towering bamboo, the gate and path quiet and secluded, the chamber empty of others.

I then inquired about the Yellow Emperor’s ascension to heaven, his battle with Chiyou, his employment of Feng Hou, and the method of forging the *Iron Mirror*.

The old man replied, “Have you heard of the Divine Immortals’ method for refining the elixir and forging the *Three Primordial Treasure Mirrors*—those of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity?”

I answered, “I have not.”

Thereupon, I knelt and bowed twice, entreating him to reveal these hidden arts and dispel my worldly delusions.

He said, “Observing your bones and qi, you are no ordinary man. You are fit to be taught.” Then, from his satchel, he produced a text written entirely in ancient seal script.

He said, “This is not a matter for your person alone, but for the Sage Emperor of Great Peace. If you encounter an age where virtue and simplicity are pure, aligned with the heart of Heaven and Earth, where the Four Seas are at peace and the people sing in harmony, then you may forge the mirrors according to this method.”

I received his words with sincerity and bowed twice in gratitude.

The next morning, the old man said, “This is no place for you to linger. You should depart.” Three cycles of twelve years later, we met again.

When I took my leave, I bowed twice by the Luo River, concealing the method close to my person, never daring to transmit it lightly to the unworthy.

Recorded in the second month of spring, the second year of *Tianfu* in the Tang dynasty, by Guigengzi.

**Preface to *The Divine Immortals’ Method for Refining the Elixir and Forging the Three Primordial Treasure Mirrors***

Guigengzi was the sobriquet of a scholar who met with no success in his time.

In my youth, I studied both literary and martial arts and was drawn to extraordinary techniques.

Upon reaching the age of adulthood, I passed through Liang and arrived in Zheng, wandering among the peaks of Song and Shaoshi. Resting beneath a great tree, I encountered an old man of about eighty, his brows and eyes clear and uncluttered, his spirit serene and composed. We exchanged bows and sat upon a stone, and as we spoke for some time, much of his discourse concerned the emptiness of the world and the path beyond it.

He said to me, “My dwelling is not far from here. You may come and visit.” I assented and followed him. His home was surrounded by ancient trees and towering bamboo, its gate and path quiet and secluded, the chamber empty of others. There, I inquired about the Yellow Emperor’s ascent to heaven, his battle with Chiyou, his employment of the Wind Master, and the method of forging the Iron Mirror.

The old man said, “Have you heard of the Divine Immortals’ method for refining the elixir and forging the Three Primordial Treasure Mirrors of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity?”

I replied, “I have not.”

Thereupon, I bowed deeply twice and entreated him, “I wish for you, Master, to reveal these hidden arts and dispel my worldly delusions.”

He said, “Observing your bone and qi, you are no ordinary man. You are worthy of instruction.” He then drew from his bag a text written in ancient seal script.

“This,” he said, “is not a matter for your person alone, but for the Sage Emperor of a Great Peace. Only when virtue is pure and simple, aligning with the heart of Heaven and Earth, when the Four Seas are at peace and the people sing praises of the pivot of governance, may this method be forged.”

I received his words with sincerity and bowed twice in gratitude.

The next morning, the old man said, “This is no place for you to linger. You should depart.” Three cycles of twelve years later, we met again.

When I took my leave, I bowed twice by the Luo River, concealing the method close to my person, never daring to transmit it lightly to the unworthy.

**The Divine Immortals’ Method for Refining the Elixir and Forging the Three Primordial Treasure Mirrors**

**Method for Forging the Heaven Mirror**
The *Divine Immortals’ Text* states: At the beginning of the Heavenly Cycle of *jiazi*, the first of the six sixes, when the yang fire is at its zenith, gather its true essence. Refine the qi of the Five Metals’ numinous elixir and forge the Heaven Mirror. It will command the awe of spirits and demons, severing the roots of malevolence. Place the furnace in the position of the *Xuanjian* (Mysterious Mirror). On the six *wu* days of the year’s旬, invoke the yang earth of *Juchen* (the Celestial Enclosure), fell the yang wood of the Six *Jia* Green Dragon, and ignite the yang fire of the Six *Bing* Vermilion Bird, burning it to smokeless embers. Employ the yang metal of the Six *Geng* White Tiger and the yang water of the Six *Ren* Dark Warrior.

Afterward, construct a yang earth altar, three feet high, with three tiers—round above and square below—with steps extending from all four sides. On the altar, mold a furnace eight feet and one inch high, with eight doors at its base, each six inches and four *fen* wide. Atop the furnace, fashion an iron Heavenly Wheel, positioning the deities of the Six *Jia* and Six *Ding*, the Sun Lord and Moon Queen, and the Nine Luminaries’ True Lords. Ignite the fire, refining at its center, using the Fire Dragon’s elixir.

The Heaven Mirror should be three inches thick, weighing seventy-two pounds, with a face thirty-six inches wide. On its reverse, the inner design depicts the Purple Tenuity Star Lord’s abode, while the outer lists the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Once forged, if the Five Planets deviate from their courses, comets appear in the sky, or disasters of frost, hail, floods, or drought strike, open this mirror with reverent purity. Assist in manifesting power and virtue, and the calamities will naturally cease.

**Method for Forging the Earth Mirror**
The Earth Mirror is also three inches thick, weighing seventy-two pounds, with a face thirty-six inches wide. On its reverse, cast the mountains, rivers, Five Peaks, Four Seas, Eight Trigrams, Nine Provinces, and Sixteen Spirits. When forging, do so at the full moon of the Great Yin. If earthquakes, landslides, or the collapse of mountains and rivers occur, if locusts devastate the harvest, or if waterways and bridges are blocked, open the Earth Mirror with solemn purity. Cultivate virtue and assist in manifesting power, and the disasters will naturally vanish.

**Method for Forging the Human Mirror**
The Human Mirror is likewise three inches thick, weighing seventy-two pounds, with a face thirty-six inches wide. On its reverse, cast the revolving mechanism of the stars, the names of the sixty *jiazi* spirits, the Son of Heaven’s imperial title, the Lord of One’s Life Destiny, the Green Dragon to the left and White Tiger to the right, the state’s name, the celestial divisions of the stars, and the subordinate commanderies and counties. Forge it on a *bingwu* day at the hour of the sun’s zenith.

Once forged, if warfare does not cease or the people suffer from epidemics, open this mirror with purity and sincerity, offering prayers and sacrifices, and the disasters and pestilence will naturally subside. On the days of the two qi’s ascent and descent, gather the elderly of all ranks in the main hall. Open the Human Mirror before the hall’s eaves, displaying its awe-inspiring radiance, and treacherous ministers and rebellious villains will all harbor fear. If the Human Mirror emits sudden, dazzling light from its case at an inopportune time, the direction it points will surely harbor the calamity of rebellion. Suppress it, and none will dare act. The Four Barbarians will come as guests, and the realm will be purified.

**Method for Refining the Elixir and Infusing the Five Metals**
The *Divine Immortals’ Text* states: The Five Metals are of natural substance but cannot transform into treasures without being infused by the Fire Dragon Elixir, through which they attain communion with the numinous essence of Heaven and Earth. The Fire Dragon Elixir originates in the south, the Vermilion Bird’s position of fire, and is refined within the north’s *ren* and *gui* waters. Traversing the Five Phases, it encompasses the Five Colors and rivals Heaven and Earth in efficacy. Its qi ascends to become Heaven, and its substance descends to become Earth. Thus, it is the root of the supreme medicine, for it takes flight at the sight of fire—hence the name Fire Dragon.

It possesses the number of the Three Ones, where male and female are undivided, and purity and turbidity, ascent and descent, remain unsettled. Therefore, the noble man endures hardship and awaits the proper time, knowing the white yet guarding the black, and the numinous will come of its own accord. Sages keep it secret, transmitting it orally rather than inscribing it in writing.

**Method for Nurturing the Elixir in the Golden Crucible**
The *Divine Immortals’ Text* states: The Golden Crucible corresponds above to Heaven, below to Earth, and in the center to humanity. When the people prosper and the state is at peace, when Heaven is clear and Earth is tranquil, the myriad things are born. Thus, it is said: “Preceding Heaven, Heaven does not oppose it; following Heaven, it complies with Heaven’s timing.” This is now made clear.

The crucible’s height, weight, thickness, and proportions must precisely follow the method. It should be one foot and two inches tall, weighing seventy-two pounds, its number being nine. Its inner circumference is one foot and five inches, its base one and a half inches thick, its legs raised two and a half inches from the ground, and its body one and a half inches thick.

The crucible’s interior holds three and a half *sheng* of material, with a depth of six inches. Its lid is one inch thick, and its handles rise one and a half inches.

There are ten defects that disqualify its use:
1. The metal is impure.
2. The casting is untimely.
3. The thickness is uneven.
4. The mold is not fully dried.
5. The core is suspended during casting.
6. There are sand holes.
7. There are internal partitions.
8. There are inclusions or seams.
9. The metal is wrinkled.
10. The height, size, and thickness do not conform to the measurements.

If any of these ten defects are present, the crucible is unfit for refining the supreme elixir.

**Method of Nurturing the Elixir in the Furnace**
The *Divine Immortals’ Text* states: The furnace is the crucible’s transformative vessel, encompassing *wu* and *ji*, shielding against external pathogens. Its height resembles a lotus dais, its breadth the Five Peaks.

The altar has three tiers, round above and square below. The furnace has eight gates. Above, an iron celestial wheel is erected, bearing the Nine Stars and Twenty-Eight Constellations. It moves with the Six *Jia*, revolving in accordance with the Orthodox Unity, aligned with the lunar lodges. Their forms are cast in metal.

Then, refine with fire:
- One *jin* of sulfur,
- One *jin* of realgar,
- One *jin* of orpiment,
- One *jin* of arsenic.

These Four Yellows serve as the city walls of the supreme elixir. The Four Yellows and the cinnabar elixir are governed by oral instructions.

Refine one *jin* of cinnabar elixir, which contains sixteen *liang*. Each *liang* has twenty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the 365¼ degrees of the celestial circuit. The celestial *jiazi* cycle is 720, the great number of *bing* and *ding*. There is an envoy that moves one degree per day—this is the great number of pure Yang. There is an envoy that moves thirteen degrees per day and night, completing 365¼ degrees in a month—this is the great number of pure Yin. Yang is concealed by the external, while Yang coalesces from within.

A song says:
*Within sixty hours, move bing and ding,*
*Discern the Five Phases with each moment’s shift.*
*When Yang’s qi advances, follow Heaven’s turn;*
*When Yin’s qi wanes, pursue the stars’ decree.*
*Always align with the zenith at noon,*
*As the lunar lodges cycle—then the elixir is complete.*

**Method of Fire Timing**
The *Divine Immortals’ Text* states: The fire timing begins on the day Yang is born, cycling through the seventy-two seasonal markers, alternating in ascent and descent. Each day corresponds to one *liang* and one and a half *zhu*.

**Sacrificial Method**
The *Divine Immortals’ Writ* states: "After achieving merit before Heaven, then the springs and caves are divided into four parts, three of them. One part is used to illuminate Heaven, one part to illuminate Earth, one part to illuminate Man, and the remaining one part of the three is used to report and give thanks to the springs and caves for the divine immortal traces bestowed. Cast gold into a case, inscribe the imperial records, and cast it in. The remaining one part may be consumed to make the spirit and *qi* serene and pure, prolonging life."

The method for refining the elixir and casting the Three Primordials’ precious illuminations is complete.
