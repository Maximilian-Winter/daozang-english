When the Primordial Unity divided, Heaven and Earth took their places, and humans and the myriad things each took shape from a single *qi*. The active draws from Heaven, the still follows Earth. Among all things between Heaven and Earth, none is more numinous than humanity. That which nurtures the human form is none other than *qi* and spirit.

Spirit is that which subtly pervades the myriad things; *qi* borrows emptiness and tranquility for its function. The words of the perfected being begin with *qi*; the actions of the perfected being are most wondrous in spirit.

My master attained the Way of the perfected being, perceiving the mechanism of life and death. He constantly savored the primordial flavor, employed the primordial function, acted through primordial action, and engaged in primordial affairs. Knowing that spirit and *qi* could preserve the form, he guarded the primordial void to nurture spirit and *qi*. Knowing that profound obscurity could bring forth trust, he entered the profound obscurity to observe the utmost essence. Thus, between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows? The immortality of the perfected being—is it not like the spirit of the valley?

The master said: Within the primordial void, there is something called spirit; within the profound obscurity, there is something called *qi*. *Qi* binds the primordial void to achieve the wondrous.

Thus, the Great Cavern Perfected One said: "For three months, inwardly gaze and fix the mind. When the spirit is singular, the radiance of spirit transforms and arises, entwining the five viscera." The principle is clear.

Moreover, *qi* is the mother of spirit, and spirit is the child of *qi*. To attain the child, first cultivate the mother. If spirit does not receive nourishment from *qi*, then *qi* cannot communicate its numinosity. If the child does not seek sustenance from the mother, then the mother cannot achieve harmony.

The *Daoist Scripture* states: "Having attained the mother, guard the child; having attained the child, again guard the mother." The *Jade Book of the Eastern Flower* says: "Strike the child, and the heart abides in long-lasting peace." These are all essential words for cultivating the truth.

Furthermore, the ears and eyes are the doors and windows of spirit; yin and yang are the weapons of *qi*. To close the doors and windows and still the weapons—all depends on the silent workings of spirit and *qi*. If *qi* has its practice and spirit has its return, then the primordial gate is barred and cannot be opened, the primordial cord is bound and cannot be untied. The myriad things, luminous and upright, all follow the teaching of wordless instruction, submitting to the transformation of non-action.

The *Daoist Scripture* says: "Looked at but not seen, listened to but not heard, grasped but not obtained—I will inwardly still the ruler of the primordial void and profound obscurity. One should see the form that cannot be seen, hear the sound that cannot be heard, grasp the thing that cannot be grasped. When all three are attained, then my life is in my own hands, not in Heaven’s."

Master Yin said: "Inwardly observe the radiance of spirit—do not call it non-luminous. Reverse-hear the voice of spirit—do not call it soundless. Clench fast the essence and spirit—do not call it formless." Thus, the cultivator of the Dao sees for the seer, hears for the hearer, and grasps for the grasper.

There were perfected beings of old who, in sleep, did not dream, and in waking, knew no sorrow.

The master said: "I, too, do not dream—this is called spirit-wandering. My spirit constantly wanders, unbound by day or night, dwelling alone in the realm of carefree ease, the garden of non-bestowal. This is the joy of gathering the true."

If I wish to divide and become a newborn, the newborn takes form from the *qi*-mother. If I wish to divide and become an infant, the infant takes substance from the *qi*-mother. If I wish to divide and become a perfected being, the perfected being attains numinosity from the *qi*-mother. These three cannot be divided, thus they merge into one—one is my spirit, and spirit is within my body.

Alas! Those who recklessly act—some preserve, some guard—why do you seek cinnabar? Why do you seek the elixir? Your heart is deluded by the true, your eyes are confused by your form.

He who does not know the body cannot be spoken to of *qi*; he who does not know *qi* cannot be spoken to of spirit. Only he who knows both body and spirit may draw upon the Dao.

When *qi* fails to circulate, pure essence does not respond; when spirit is not employed, true vision remains obscure. Thus, when spirit is luminous, it can command *qi*; when *qi* is concentrated, it can respond to spirit. This is why one knows that without cultivation, clarity does not arise of itself, and without concentration, *qi* does not soften of itself.

The *Daoist Scripture* says: *"Concentrate *qi* to attain softness—can you be like an infant?"*
The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: *"Immortals and Daoist adepts are not inherently divine; only by accumulating essence and amassing *qi* do they attain perfection."* This is precisely what it means.

Later learners, however, either exhale or inhale the *qi* of the four seasons and five sprouts, or ingest and guide the essence of the seven constellations and two luminaries. They clench their fists to mimic the fetal form and hold their breath to simulate fetal breathing—all far removed from the sublime subtleties of the perfected. Such practices are but trivial pursuits of antiquity. Those who engage in them disturb the primordial *qi* and harm both body and spirit.

The consummate person roams the heart in tranquility, merges *qi* with the vast, drinks from the dark spring, and breathes as a fetus in the primal savor. Then the radiance of spirit shines within, the five viscera generate numinosity, and naturally, purple mists ascend while jade hues intermingle.

Respectfully transmitting the master’s teaching: transforming the white into crimson, accumulating essence to form substance, the mouth holding divine fungus, descending into the body—this is the protection of the true immortal. Guard the center, embrace the One, and never lose it; thus shall you share the same span as heaven and earth.
