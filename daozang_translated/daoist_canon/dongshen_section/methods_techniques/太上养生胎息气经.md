*The Supreme Scripture on Nurturing Life Through Embryonic Breathing*
The *Shangqing* texts—*The Dao and Its Virtue*, *The Yellow Court Scripture*, and *Essential Collection on Nurturing Life*—enable one who follows them to dispel the myriad illnesses and ascend as an immortal of the *Shangqing* realm.

In all methods of qi-absorption, the mind must abide as an infant in the womb, achieving completion in ten months, with sinews and bones harmonized and supple. By stilling the mind and quieting thoughts, harmonious qi arrives of itself. With regulated breathing and proper swallowing, hunger ceases, the hundred pores open, and the in-breath flows without obstruction. Constantly drawing in the vital qi of the six yang hours, one’s strength increases daily.

**Method of the Six Yang Hours**
- **Midnight (Zi hour):** Inhale nine times nine, eighty-one breaths.
- **Dawn (Yin hour):** Inhale eight times eight, sixty-four breaths.
- **Breakfast (Chen hour):** Inhale seven times seven, forty-nine breaths.
- **Noon (Wu hour):** Inhale six times six, thirty-six breaths.
- **Afternoon (Shen hour):** Inhale five times five, twenty-five breaths.
- **Dusk (Xu hour):** Inhale four times four, sixteen breaths.

In qi-absorption, the tongue must be dark; the dark must follow the gates of entry and exit.
- The nose is the **Heavenly Gate**; when absorbing qi, the hun and po souls return to the Heavenly Gate.
- The mouth is the **Earthly Door**; when absorbing qi, the hun and po souls return to the Earthly Door.

*The Yellow Court Scripture* states:
*"The essence of the hundred grains is the earth’s spirit,
The five flavors’ external allure is foul with demonic stench.
Wash the numinous root with jade pool’s clear water—
If you cultivate this, you will replenish the Gate of Life."*

To attain longevity, draw qi in through the nose and release it through the mouth—this is the proper flow of qi. By cultivating thus with an unwavering true heart, expelling the Three Corpses, forsaking glory and desire, success accrues daily, and one gradually approaches the Dao.

The true person’s nature is serene and tranquil, their mind pure and refined, their words aligned with the Dao, their heart’s conduct flawless. Rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid, the hundred flavors within the abdomen are self-sufficient. The Triple Burner is unblocked, the upright qi regulated, and qi circulates throughout, penetrating the five viscera and fortifying the marrow.

The Dao is the master of the myriad qi. The Dao is qi. Qi is the gate of essence. If one guards essence, it is like a house with an occupant—its measure endures for a hundred generations. If one lacks essence, it is like a house without an occupant—calamity befalls its generation.

Qi is preserved through essence. Essence is qi. When essence and qi are both complete, this is called a **true person**.

Humans possess three cinnabar fields:
- **Upper Cinnabar Field:** The mud-pill palace of the brain, where the Red Emperor’s son, Qing, resides, styled Yuanxian.
- **Middle Cinnabar Field:** The heart, where the true person Guangjian dwells, styled Zidan.
- **Lower Cinnabar Field:** The infant’s valley of mystery, styled Yuanyangzi, the gate of qi and essence.

Each of the three palaces has its three spirits. If the spirits relax and qi leaks, qi leaks and essence dissipates; when essence dissipates, the spirits perish. Essence is a wondrous substance, the root of the true person’s longevity. The root of longevity is the seat of qi. When essence is complete, qi is complete; when essence leaks, qi leaks. Only essence and qi must be preserved in their entirety.

The ancient sages’ supreme Dao was to cherish qi and guard essence, thereby attaining longevity. When desire stirs the passions, restraint is not freely wielded—how can stability be maintained? This single lapse is perilous, like a mountain’s collapse or the sea’s exhaustion. The mountain is the treasure of qi; the treasure is the kidneys. The kidneys are the root of life. If the root lacks essence, the leaves wither; if the leaves wither, the branches decay; if the branches decay, the body withers. To seek rebirth then—how can it be saved?

Inhaled qi is yin; exhaled qi is yang. These two absorb the essence of the sun and moon. Qi is emptiness; emptiness is natural non-action; non-action is the heart’s stillness. With no external seeking and inner tranquility, tranquility stabilizes the spirit, the spirit stabilizes and qi harmonizes, harmonized qi invites the primordial qi, primordial qi arrives and the five viscera are nourished, the five viscera nourished and the hundred vessels flow freely, the hundred vessels flowing freely and the fluids ascend in response. Then the five flavors are unmissed, hunger and thirst vanish, and one extends years and reverses aging.

Qi transforms into blood, blood into marrow. In one year, qi is renewed; in two years, blood; in three years, the vessels; in four years, the flesh; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the sinews; in seven years, the bones; in eight years, the hair; in nine years, the form is transformed into a true person. After refining the nine returns and achieving mastery, the profound mysteries of immortality are beyond full description.

**Shangqing Secret Methods of Qi**
- **East:** Green sprout—this is the liver. Consume the green sprout, drinking the morning blossom. The morning blossom is the root of the upper teeth. With the tongue’s surface, lick the lips, rinse, and swallow.
- **South:** Vermilion cinnabar—this is the heart. Consume the vermilion cinnabar, drinking from the cinnabar pool. The cinnabar pool is the root of the lower teeth. With the tongue’s surface, stir the tooth roots, rinse, and swallow.
- **West:** Bright stone—this is the lungs. Consume the bright stone, drinking the numinous fluid. The numinous fluid is the saliva within the lips. With the tongue, circle the teeth seven times, rinse, and swallow.
- **North:** Mysterious nourishment—this is the kidneys. Consume the mysterious nourishment, drinking the jade syrup. The jade syrup is the tongue. Guide the primordial qi with the nose, draw it into the mouth, breathe, and swallow.
- **Center:** Wu and Ji—lofty Mount Tai. Mount Tai is the guardian of essence. Consume the essence-qi, drinking the sweet spring. The sweet spring lies before the dark prominence at the tooth roots; the flowery pool is beneath the tongue’s root, also called Jade Bloom or Golden Beam. Rinse and swallow each three times.

**Method of Qi-Absorption:**
Regularly rise at midnight (Zi hour) or dawn (Yin hour), adjust your attire, and with the Golden Beam, tap the Jade Bloom. Harmonize the flowery pool, rinse the sweet spring and numinous fluid, retract the nose’s breath, guide it upward to the head, then downward into the mouth, transforming it into jade spring. Draw the qi to the tongue’s root, swallow and send it forth, causing the throat to hum, the abdomen to hum, and guide the qi into the cinnabar field—like a newborn’s cry, this is called the **root of longevity**.

Hunger is sated with the natural qi; thirst is quenched with the nectar of the flowery pool, ensuring lasting satiety.

**Upper Clarity Method:**
Essence is my spirit; qi is my Dao. Cultivate essence to nourish the spirit, drink qi to imbibe its fragrance—like an infant in the womb. In seclusion, grasp the yang form to solidify it; yin completes its shape—this is refining essence to replenish the brain, also called "refining and rinsing to fill the mouth with fluid," where all five flavors arise.

Eat at dawn and dusk to nourish yin; the five viscera generate lingzhi and jade bloom, allowing one to perceive a person’s inner nature from their outward appearance, with spirit and bearing clear and bright. One must tilt the head back to expel water from the viscera, then lean forward to expel food from the viscera. Next, lean against a wall, raise one foot, clench the fists, and stir the mouth with the tongue until the fluid fills it. Then visualize the qi being swallowed into the navel, descending to the feet as the measure, and clearly observe the intestines and stomach. If a finger can extinguish a lamp’s flame, this is the completion of eighty-one cycles, the end and beginning of heaven and earth. Refining the nine returns transforms blood into essence, essence into sinew, sinew into jade, and jade into immortal bones. This grants the natural ability to see a thousand li, becoming the body’s secret treasure, extending years and reversing aging, so that riding clouds and mounting cranes to ascend as an immortal may be awaited with ease. Those whose qi and form do not align with the Dao must not be taught, for leaking sacred texts to the unworthy brings calamity upon nine generations.

When swallowing qi, exert force, keep the mouth closed, and raise the tongue to hollow the space beneath—this is called "swallowing primordial qi." Daily, reduce food intake; each morning, absorb qi. Drink a cup of fine wine at all times—this is for beginners. Within the realm of heaven and earth, the sage dwells therein, attaining the Dao. Those lacking wisdom, the Dao, or benevolence dwell therein as well, but reap misfortune. The Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of earth as softness and hardness; the Dao of humanity as benevolence and righteousness. Heaven and earth contain essence, and the myriad things transform and arise. The Dao cannot be sought through emotion nor explained through language; the myriad things follow heaven and return to spontaneity.

**Timed Visualization for Supplementation and Drainage:**
The sage seeking longevity knows that bedroom affairs can kill. My life is in my hands—all illnesses stem from indulgence and failure to preserve essence. Today, people only know to take medicine but not to cherish and protect their essence and marrow. Preserving essence and marrow extends life. Drinking jade spring is the mysterious fluid. Endowed with an eight-chi frame and a heart containing the myriad existences, the vessel of life holds the secret art of long life. Guard it as a treasure: calm the spirit, refine the form, walk on water without sinking, enter fire without burning. This is qi circulating within and spirit responding without, purifying the five viscera, exhaling and inhaling to supplement and drain the true origin.

**Lung Visceral Diagram:**
Use swallowing to drain, exhaling to supplement.
The lung is the qi of *dui*, the essence of metal, its color white. It governs the *po*, transforming into a jade youth, seven inches tall, a white beast. When its spirit is preserved, its form is whole. The lung connects to the large intestine and governs the nose above. Excessive fear scatters the *po* from the lung; intolerance of cold indicates a thin lung. A fresh, pale complexion shows the lung is free of other ailments. Rumbling in the large intestine signals qi congestion; frequent sighing is inauspicious. The lung governs the seven palaces of Jingmen. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, at dawn, sit facing due west, strike the heavenly drum seven times, drink the jade spring nectar three times, close the eyes and concentrate, visualizing the white qi of *dui* palace entering the mouth and swallowing it thrice. Then the youthful spirit is at peace, no evil can harm, no blade can injure, and years are extended with longevity—this is supplementing and draining spirit and qi to calm and settle the numinous *po*.

**Heart Visceral Diagram:**
Use exhaling to drain, hissing to supplement.
The heart is the qi of *li*, the essence of fire, its color red. Its spirit is the Vermilion Bird, transforming into a jade maiden, eight inches tall. To pacify its spirit and preserve its form, harmonize it with the center. The heart connects to the small intestine, governs blood and vessels, and rules the tongue above. Blood congestion startles the tongue, causing loss of taste; heart disorder leads to frequent sighing. The heart governs the nine palaces of Jingmen, harmonious and whole in form. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, at dawn, sit facing due south, tap the Golden Beam nine times, rinse with the mysterious spring, swallow thrice, focus the mind and visualize, drawing the red qi of *li* palace into the mouth and swallowing it thrice to supplement the numinous palace. The jade maiden of *li* is at peace, the body secure, no misfortune can harm, and the spirit attains numinosity.

**Liver Visceral Diagram:**
Use hissing to drain, blowing to supplement.
The liver is the qi of *zhen*, the essence of wood, its color green. It governs the *hun*, its spirit like a dragon, transforming into two jade youths, one green and one yellow, each seven inches tall, one bearing a dragon, the other holding jade nectar. To secure its longevity, harmonize it with the Great Clarity. The liver connects to the sinews and governs the eyes above; heat in the eyes injures the liver. The liver governs the affairs of spring, containing the essence-qi of spring, when the myriad things flourish, following the way of yang. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at dawn, sit facing east, strike the teeth three times, hold the breath for seven cycles, draw the green qi of *zhen* palace into the mouth, and swallow it thrice to reach the two youths of the liver—this is the subtlety of nourishing essence.

**Spleen Visceral Diagram:**
Use exhaling to drain, exhaling to supplement.
The spleen is the qi of *kun*, the essence of earth, its color yellow, resembling an overturned basin. Its spirit is like a phoenix, transforming into a jade maiden, six inches tall. It harmonizes with the Great Yin and governs the mouth above; a moist, lustrous complexion indicates no other ailments. The spleen has no fixed position, lodging in each of the four seasons for eighteen days each. At dawn, sit upright in the central palace, hold the breath for five cycles, strike the heavenly drum seven times, draw the yellow qi of the central palace into the mouth and swallow it, drinking jade nectar to attain its subtlety.

Humans receive the Dao of heaven, managing the upright qi, guarding the essence of the bedroom, and preserving life to attain longevity. Visualize the flowery pool, drink jade fluid, harmonize the qi to prevail, regulate the hundred vessels, close the breath at the essence’s source, contain the true to reverse aging—this is the secret of guarding the true for long life.

The kidneys’ chart employs *chui* for draining and *yan* for replenishing the kidneys, which govern essence and the qi of Kan. Their color is black. Their form is round, also called "curved." Their spirit resembles a white deer, transforming into a jade youth, one foot in length. All things refine their essence, align with their will, and preserve their truth, uniting with the Great Clarity. The kidneys correspond to the bones and govern the ears above. If the waist cannot straighten, the kidneys are cold.

On the day of the Beginning of Winter, face north, sit at dawn, strike the golden beam five times, drink jade spring thrice, draw the black qi of the Dark Palace into the mouth and swallow it to attain the jade youth’s composition. When spirit and body harmonize, one may attain long life.

The gallbladder’s chart employs *xi* for draining and *xu* for replenishing the gallbladder, the essence of metal and the qi of water. Its color is green. Its spirit resembles a tortoise, transforming into a jade maiden, one foot in length, its spirit courageous. The gallbladder corresponds to the bladder; a greenish complexion indicates no other ailments. Regularly at the start of the month, sit upright, focus the mind on the northern darkness, draw black qi into the mouth, swallow nine times, and drink the nectar of jade spring to achieve the qi’s subtlety.

Joy and anger harm one’s nature; excessive pleasure injures the spirit. When the spirit is harmed, life is encroached upon; when nature is damaged, life is harmed. Cultivate nature to vitalize qi, preserve the spirit to calm the heart. When qi is balanced, the body harmonizes; when essence is whole, the heart is at ease. These are the secret words of refining truth, the immortal arts of long life.

Qi is the master of the body; to master it is to guard essence. Essence is the body’s utmost; the Dao connects to immortality. Essence is the root of life; preserving essence and valuing qi enable long life—this is the Dao’s foundation. Humans lose the Dao; the Dao does not lose humans.

For qi-ingestion, sit calmly in a quiet chamber, close the eyes in stillness, distend the abdomen and puff the cheeks to fill the mouth with qi, then open the qi passage, click the teeth, and swallow, nine times constituting one breath. In spring and summer, ingest cool qi; in autumn and winter, ingest warm qi. Each night at the fifth watch, cover the mouth with both palms, press firmly into the palms, gather saliva to rub the face until the skin glows. Frequently sip jujube-honey decoction to aid this, eat sparingly daily, and ingest qi each morning—qi will readily take form.

In all cultivation, never let others know. If others know, my life arises; if my life arises, fame arrives; if fame arrives, misfortune comes; if misfortune comes, there is no peace. The utmost Dao’s nature is most still and thus incorruptible. Knowing this and refining it is called true correctness.

Jade uncarved becomes no vessel; humans unlearned know not the Dao. Water’s nature, unadulterated, is clear; undisturbed, it is level—this is the true nature embracing unity, serene and vast, outwardly empty and inwardly void. The utmost Dao is non-action, yet nothing is left undone. Emptiness and nothingness unite with the body, naturally merging with truth, abiding in stillness for long duration.

The Great Dao models heaven and emulates earth. The ancients recounted antiquity, ascending from the mundane to sagehood and transforming into immortal bones. They inhaled and exhaled yin and yang, breathed as an embryo breathes the sun and moon, closed the mouth to contain emptiness, and the upper and lower numinous fluids arrived of themselves, slowly swallowing them.

Those who study the Dao ingest qi as the worldly crave food—thus the Dao is accomplished. The Dao’s method lies in inner cultivation, preserving the whole form. Preserving the Dao calms the spirit; immortal arts differ, but the perfected one’s utmost Dao depends on the person. Humans can magnify the Dao; the Dao does not magnify humans. The qi-Dao is lofty and wondrous, attaining long life.

All qi-swallowing connects three swallows: two dry, one moist. Dry refers to clouds moving; moist refers to rain descending. Following heaven’s Dao, the nose draws in qi, the hun-soul returns to the heavenly gate, the mouth savors the five flavors, and the hun and po souls return to the earthly portal.

It is also said: the nose connects to the Jade Pool of Upper Clarity; the mouth connects to the Human Gate of Great Harmony. Rinsing to fill with numinous fluid, the five viscera become clear and refreshed. The mysterious and wondrous Dao does not abandon the myriad things; the myriad things arise of themselves. Qi is the hundred practices; the Dao of qi forms itself.

The Dao—its arising is like toil; its ceasing is like rest. Not resting is called exhaustion; using essence without cease is called labor. Labor leads to depletion; depletion leads to death. That which is pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging—this is the utmost of cultivating Dao-qi.

The pure and plain Dao unites with the spirit as one. "One" is what the perfected call "natural." Qi can harmonize the six viscera, pacify the heart-spirit, and enable long life. This is the undying Dao. You possess the immortal’s countenance and have obtained my *Qi Classic*. Within it are the Yellow Court Perfected One, the Central Jade Maiden, and the Great Emperor of Fusang. You have received this, inscribed in gold, the secret words of refining truth.

Thus concludes the *Supreme Scripture on Nurturing Life and Embryonic Breathing*.
