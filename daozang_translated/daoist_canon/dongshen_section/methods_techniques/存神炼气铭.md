**Inscription on Preserving Spirit and Refining Qi**

*Inscription on Preserving Spirit and Refining Qi*
*Composed by Sun Simiao of the Tang Dynasty*

The body is the dwelling of spirit and qi. When spirit and qi abide, the body thrives with vigor; when they scatter, the body perishes. To preserve the body, first stabilize spirit and qi. Qi is the mother of spirit, and spirit the child of qi. When spirit and qi unite, one attains longevity without death.

To stabilize the spirit, refine the primordial qi. When qi resides within, the spirit settles in the Sea of Qi. As the Sea of Qi fills, the heart is at peace and the spirit steadfast. When steadfastness remains unbroken, body and mind congeal in stillness. When stillness reaches its utmost, the body endures for eternal years. Abiding in the source of the Dao, one naturally becomes a sage.

Qi communicates with the realm of spirit; spirit connects to the life of wisdom. When life abides and the body endures, it unites with true nature. Equal in age to the sun and moon, the Dao is perfected in its ultimate state.

To practice this refinement of qi according to the inscription, those who wish to learn this art must first abstain from grains. Settle the heart in the Sea of Qi, preserve the spirit in the Cinnabar Field, gather the mind, and still all thoughts. When the Sea of Qi is replete, one is naturally sated.

Those who devote themselves wholeheartedly will achieve minor success in a hundred days and major success in three years. First, one enters the Five Phases; later, one attains the Seven Stages. The spirit transforms wondrously, moving freely and without hindrance—traversing sheer cliffs for a thousand miles, coming and going without obstruction. If qi does not scatter, the Sea of Qi remains full; the spirit is tranquil in the Cinnabar Field, and body and mind endure forever. Naturally, one’s complexion is restored, the body transforms into that of an immortal, and one moves between concealment and revelation with freedom, attaining a hundred spiritual transformations. This is called "transcending the world," and one is titled a Perfected Person—equal in years to heaven and earth, sharing the lifespan of the sun and moon.

This method does not require swallowing qi, nor does it demand the consumption of saliva. It is not arduous: eat when hungry, rest when weary, moving freely without obstruction or hindrance. Through the Five Phases and Seven Stages, one enters the womb and attains the meditative vision of stability.

For those who study the Dao, there are Five Phases of entry:

**First Phase:** The heart is often restless and seldom still, thoughts wandering through myriad realms, attachments and aversions shifting without constancy, anxieties and calculations like wild horses—this is the heart of ordinary people.

**Second Phase:** The heart is still but often restless. Though one gathers the restless into stillness, the mind frequently scatters. It is difficult to subdue, requiring diligent effort to rein it in—this is the beginning of pursuing the Dao.

**Third Phase:** The heart is half restless and half still. Though the heart seems gathered in stillness, it remains equally prone to scattering. With diligent effort, one gradually achieves harmony.

**Fourth Phase:** The heart is still more often than restless. As the mind becomes increasingly adept at gathering, when restlessness arises, it is swiftly subdued. One focuses on a single realm, regaining what was lost.

**Fifth Phase:** The heart is purely and wholly still. Whether engaged in activity or not, it remains unmoved by external stimuli. The mind is firmly gathered, and scattering is no longer possible. From this point onward, one dwells in the manifest and enters the Seven Stages, attaining effortless mastery without deliberate action.

**First Stage:** Chronic illnesses vanish, the body feels light, and the heart is at ease. The mind turns inward, the spirit is tranquil, and qi is settled. The Four Elements are harmonious, the Six Passions subdued. The heart rests in profound stillness, embracing the One and guarding the center. Joy renews daily—this is called "attaining the Dao."

**Second Stage:** One surpasses ordinary limits, the complexion reverts to youth, the form is joyful, and the heart is at peace. One gains spiritual clarity and penetrating vision, relocates to a distant land, and chooses a dwelling place with care. Neighbors recognize one as a stranger, and old acquaintances must not be informed.

**Third Stage:** One extends life for a thousand years and is called an Immortal. One roams famous mountains, flying freely. Azure youths serve as attendants, jade maidens sing praises, and one treads upon mist and clouds, with verdant mists supporting one’s feet.

**Fourth Stage:** One refines the body into qi, and qi encircles the body with light. This is called a Perfected Person. One gains mastery over life and death, radiates light that illuminates day and night, and roams through the grotto heavens, where all immortals stand in attendance.

**Fifth Stage:** One refines qi into spirit and is called a Spirit Person. One attains boundless transformation and limitless efficacy, moving mountains and draining seas with one’s power.

**Sixth Stage:** One refines spirit to unite with form and is called a Supreme Person. The spirit, now spiritually attuned, assumes no fixed form. One responds to circumstances with transformations, manifesting in accordance with the needs of beings.

**Seventh Stage:** The body transcends the material world, surpassing ordinary categories. One dwells in the numinous realm with the Jade Emperor of the Great Dao, where sages and worthies gather to expound the ultimate truth. Creation and transformation become spiritually attuned, and nothing is beyond comprehension. Only upon reaching this point in cultivation does one arrive at the source of the Dao. When all practices cease, this is called "ultimate perfection."

People of the present day study the Dao for but a short time, yet not even one stage is attained—how can they gain spiritual communion? Clinging to foolish sentiments and preserving impure forms, they succumb to the passage of the four seasons, their bodies decaying and complexions withering. When their forms dissolve and return to emptiness, they mistakenly call this "attaining the Dao." How erroneous!

This womb-breathing and stabilizing vision is the art of retaining spirit and preserving form. Its oral instructions are not recorded in writing; only those of virtuous attainment may encounter this method. Examine it carefully, and success will be certain without doubt.

May the wise and discerning encounter this sacred teaching!
