**Sun Zhenren’s Treatise on Nurturing Life**

**First Month:** The kidney *qi* is afflicted, and the lung’s *qi* is weak. One should reduce salty and sour flavors while increasing pungent tastes to assist the kidneys and supplement the lungs, thereby harmonizing and nourishing the stomach *qi*. Avoid exposure to freezing cold or extreme warmth; rise early and retire late to relax body and spirit. Do not eat raw scallions, as they harm the body’s fluids and blood. Do not eat raw knotweed, as it inevitably causes *zheng* and *feng* disorders, with wandering wind rising on the face. Do not consume spoiled or stored foods, as they diminish one’s lifespan.

**Second Month:** The kidney *qi* is weak, and the liver is in its proper ascendance. One should reduce sour flavors and increase pungent tastes to assist the kidneys and supplement the liver.
