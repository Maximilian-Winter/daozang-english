The Essential and Wondrous Supreme Formula of Qi Regulation—those who practice the true Dao employ it, and their longevity becomes equal to that of Heaven and Earth.

Humans naturally possess six forms of *daoyin*, yet they remain unaware of the methods of *chui* (blowing), *he* (exhaling), *xu* (hissing), *yan* (swallowing), *hu* (breathing), and *xi* (sighing):
- *Chui* dispels cold *qi*,
- *He* dispels vexing *qi*,
- *Xu* dispels phlegm accumulation,
- *Yan* dispels fatigue and weariness,
- *Hu* dispels warmth and heat,
- *Xi* dispels wind *qi*.

This is what it means for humans to naturally understand their own vitality.

### **Qi Regulation Method**
Prepare a chamber of ten square feet, with a small window. At noon, consume a full meal of plain white rice, and moderate rich or pungent flavors to allow *qi* to flow smoothly. By midnight, knock the teeth together thirty-four times.

Next, practice the *warm qi* method:
Rub the hands together, then massage the face, body, hands, and feet—this is called *Dry Bathing*.

Gather the hair with both hands, then sit upright. Close the breath and swallow it down to the *qi* sea. One may inhale once and swallow once, or inhale twice and swallow once, or inhale thrice and swallow once. After five swallows, exhale a small breath—this is called *one cycle*.

Though one may feel empty, it should not be exhausting. Initially, it is quite difficult, and the intent may not be grasped. With prolonged practice, the rhythm becomes self-evident, and one naturally understands what is appropriate—words cannot fully convey it, nor can brush and ink capture it.

If the body seems afflicted with illness, close the eyes and hold the breath until extreme discomfort arises, causing the body and abdomen to expand and contract, sweat to emerge, and slight panting to occur. Once the panting ceases and the sweat dissipates, the cycle is complete. After ten such cycles, the illness will be cured.

From midnight to noon pertains to *yang qi*—this may be absorbed.
From noon to midnight pertains to *yin qi*—this must not be absorbed.

*Qi* drawn through the nose is *orthodox qi*—this may be absorbed.
*Qi* drawn through the mouth is *perverse qi*—this must not be absorbed.

The nose is the gate of the *hun* (ethereal soul), and the mouth is the door of the *po* (corporeal soul). The *hun* is pure, while the *po* is turbid—hence this distinction.

Additionally, minor *daoyin* exercises may be performed as needed when discomfort arises; one need not complete all of them. The twelve *supplementation methods* follow the same principle.

By dawn, after completing one cycle, consume a meal—it will be swiftly digested. Then relax and return to the method of absorbing *qi* as practiced at midnight.

The *Thirteen Stills of Lord Lao*: At noon, take honey broth, sesame drink, jujube decoction, turnip seed soup, or yellow essence soup—any one of these will suffice. A small cup or two of wine may also be taken, which is most efficacious. One should always hold a jujube pit in the mouth to stimulate saliva and moisten the inner organs; otherwise, the mouth will grow dry.

Day and night, maintain focus, and the seasonal rhythms will naturally align. No strenuous effort is required, nor should one become fatigued—merely sustain it gently, as if preserving the body. On the first day, the *qi* settles into the body; on the second, it feels like a dream; on the third, the lower abdomen becomes aware; on the fourth, the abdomen rumbles; on the fifth, the eyes grow warm; on the sixth, the feet grow warm; on the seventh, the spirit appears; on the eighth, the *qi* moves like drifting clouds; on the ninth, upper and lower unite; on the tenth, the radiance of the spirit courses through the form.

In the first three days, slight dizziness may occur; by the twenty-eighth day, minor apparitions may arise; by the fortieth day, *qi* increases; by the sixtieth day, one returns to normal. If the urine is dark yellow, take jujube soup; if the stool is hard and difficult to pass, take mallow seed soup.

After ten days, the complexion may appear sallow; after twenty days, the intestines and stomach become active; after thirty days, fatigue dissipates; after forty days, the countenance brightens; after fifty days, the six viscera harmonize; after sixty days, one returns to normal; after seventy days, aspirations grow lofty and distant. At this time, one should seclude the essence and guard the mysterious, taking cinnabar, realgar, or orpiment—then one will no longer fear cold or heat. Wine, though beneficial to *qi*, can disorder the spirit and should not be consumed in excess.

After a hundred days, one attains spiritual communion. If one also takes herbal medicines, one will no longer be weak or emaciated. Be cautious never to leak *qi*. When *qi* is about to generate, the abdomen may feel full and vaporous—absorb it, then harmonize the *qi* to balance it. Visualize it exiting through the pores, not descending downward; this is called *refining qi*. Refining *qi* within a hundred days is most difficult—even if one fails once or twice, persist until success is achieved. Saliva should be swallowed, not spat out; this is called *refining saliva*. Even if urine appears like water, its purity is such that it may be consumed; this is called *refining urine*.

As *Huainanzi* states: "To live long, keep the abdomen clear; to avoid death, keep the abdomen free of dregs." In winter, one will not feel cold; in summer, one will not feel heat—this is the method of *qi*-circulation practiced by tortoises, snakes, and swallows, where breath neither enters nor exits through nose or mouth.

After a hundred days, light illuminates the body; after two hundred days, inner and outer become bright; after three hundred days, one communes with spirits; after four hundred days, one perceives the external from within; after five hundred days, one endures cold and heat; after six hundred days, one can conceal or reveal oneself; after seven hundred days, one moves without hindrance; after eight hundred days, if a woman practices, jade maidens attend her, and if a man practices, jade lads attend him; after nine hundred days, one sees ten thousand miles and knows all things. After nine years, one ascends as an immortal; after twelve years, one becomes a *zhenren*.

In another year, the *qi* is renewed; in two years, the blood; in three years, the vessels; in four years, the flesh; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the sinews and bones; in seven years, the skin; in eight years, the hair; in nine years, the form transforms into an immortal, with thirty-six thousand spirits dwelling within. One may ride clouds and mount dragons, command wind and rain, and summon ghosts and spirits. After a hundred and twenty years, the spirit is refined and unites with the Dao, merging with the void in truth.

**Method for Regulating Qi**
After midnight, lie supine with a level pillow, arms and legs extended, feet spaced a foot apart. Then stretch the hands, each five inches from the body, make fists, and hold the breath. Focus the mind on the afflicted area and attack it with *qi*. After a long while, gradually open the mouth and slowly exhale the turbid *qi*. Perform this six or seven breaths as one cycle. When refining *qi*, ensure it gathers at the afflicted area and disperses it. When exhaling, do so quietly so that even the ears do not hear—this ensures longevity.

The spleen resides in the central palace as the sovereign’s seat. The four *qi* arise from the primordial *qi* and thus dwell outside the spleen as ministers. If one can secure the primordial *qi* and keep it long within the spleen’s palace, then the nine orifices will forever cease their in-and-out breathing. The spleen has nine orifices—five horizontal and four vertical—serving as portals for storing the spirit. Nine times nine is eighty-one, which is also the number of the Dao. The spleen is the chamber of the spirit and thus ensures longevity.

The spleen, seated in the central palace as the sovereign’s seat, has orifices. If one can secure the primordial *qi* and keep it long within the spleen’s palace, then the nine external orifices will forever cease their in-and-out breathing. The three cinnabar fields all rely on the spleen to store *qi*; if the spleen’s *qi* is preserved, the body remains eternally firm. The spirit is established through *qi*, and *qi* is preserved through the spirit. Spirit and *qi* generate each other, hence longevity.

If one does not practice *daoyin*, the Dao is difficult to achieve. The *Yellow Court* of the immortals is the true stepping-stone of the Dao. Even if worldly attachments remain and bedroom affairs are not abandoned, one may still cultivate in a quiet studio, a secluded garden, or a place of fine scenery.

To learn *daoyin*, one must first abstain from meat and pungent foods, and reduce bedroom activities. Moderating desires clarifies the spirit; avoiding meat and pungent foods preserves the spirit’s *qi*. In the method of *daoyin*, first pluck the hairs from the nostrils, cleanse the mouth and teeth, wear fresh, clean clothes, a light hat, and a soft cap, and use a low pillow to keep the head level—otherwise, the *qi* will not harmonize.

The primordial *qi* resides in the spleen but cannot emerge on its own; it requires external *qi* to enter through the nose, draw the primordial *qi* from the spleen, and exit again through the nose. Thus, the nature of *qi* is natural—reversing the flow from external to internal is also natural.

**Method for Moderating Qi**
First close the mouth and silently observe the external breath entering through the nose. Estimate the inhalation as two parts, and when the inhalation reaches its limit, draw the primordial *qi* from the spleen and exhale it through the nose. Estimate the exhalation as two parts, then moderate and retain one part. Precisely moderate the head of the primordial *qi*; if the primordial *qi* is not moderated, it returns to the spleen and waits for the next external breath to enter before exiting. Estimate the inhalation, moderate the exhalation—thus, the breath is never interrupted. This moderation is guided by the mind, and the *qi* naturally halts.

Thus, *qi* is such that if one does not moderate it, it will naturally exit. If one restrains and moderates it, *qi* is then governed by the person, not by *qi* itself.

*Qi* is mastered by spirit, for spirit can command *qi*, and *qi* can move the body—thus, it is known that intention is spirit. When moderating *qi*, one must keep the mouth closed so that *qi* does not escape through the Celestial Gate. If the Earth Gate is open, the thief will exit through the Earth Gate, hence the mouth must always remain closed. If one feels slight oppression, open the Earth Gate and release a little, then close it again after exhalation. This is called "releasing a little when unharmonized"; once skill is attained, never release it again.

At the beginning of *qi* practice, the inhalation should be slow, and the exhalation swift—after three moderations, exhale once, then swiftly moderate and slow it. One may fear that moderating the primordial *qi* lacks precision, for this is the refinement of seven or eight parts. If moderating *qi* achieves seven or eight parts, and without moderation, exhalation is estimated as three parts with half released, then the mind’s moderation is without error. Once *qi* is harmonized, return to the sage’s constant method. With diligent practice, exhalation becomes increasingly slow, and when slow, the primordial *qi* is subdued and reluctant to exit.

**Method for Assisting Dao Yin with Swallowing Qi**
Master Wang said: Those who study *Dao Yin* and practice *qi* to abstain from grain, teaching others to fast, may become somewhat weak and emaciated, hence they use swallowing *qi* to assist *Dao Yin*. Swallowing *qi* refers to swallowing coarse *qi*. When swallowing *qi*, quickly close the mouth and swallow the *qi* within the throat—thirty or twenty swallows will fill the abdomen, causing it to gurgle and churn until it feels full. Though this is a separate method, it belongs to the same family. If one moderates the primordial *qi* to achieve satiety, this is the subtlety within subtlety.

**Essential Secrets of Dao Yin’s New Signs**
Those who study *Dao Yin* and practice diligently for one or two months will achieve harmony, depending on the effort expended. *Qi* will gradually descend, feeling like the movement of a mosquito. When *qi* fills the area below the heart, press downward with the fingers to guide it—this is *qi* arriving from below the heart and gradually entering the abdomen. Frequently press the abdomen with the fingertips; if it feels like a drum’s resonance, *qi* has returned. It then gradually descends to the navel, circulating around the abdomen. Observe carefully to know the length, breadth, and size of the abdomen. When foul substances are expelled, *qi* reaches the Bubbling Spring, descending slowly until it gradually reaches the soles of the feet, then extends to the hands and head. The head is the most difficult to unblock; only when *qi* circulates throughout the entire body is it fully open. When *qi* permeates the four limbs and irrigates the hundred vessels, the entire body becomes unobstructed—this is called a "minor attainment."

Divided into yin and yang, the right side feels cool, the left side warm—this is a "minor attainment." During yang hours, use yang *qi*, and the left side remains still; during yin hours, use yin *qi*, and the right side remains still—this is also a "minor attainment." From midnight to noon is yang time; from noon to midnight is yin time. Day and night follow this pattern: during yang hours, use yang *qi* and the left side remains still; when intending to guide *qi* to the right, the mind should not dwell on the left, and *qi* will not move there. During yin hours, use yin *qi* with the intention directed to the left, following the same method as for yang.

When moderating *qi* for an extended period, as in seated meditation, one should consistently moderate *qi* with intention during spare moments, without reckless use. This prolonged moderation of *qi* is called a "minor attainment." If the right side becomes hot from excessive yin *qi*, imagine the yang side as cool as the yin side; if the left side becomes hot from excessive yang *qi*, imagine the yin side as cool as the yang side—this is called "directing *qi*," also a "minor attainment." Directing *qi* occurs when moderating the primordial *qi*. When primordial *qi* is about to descend, guide it with intention, directing it from right to left. If it cannot be directed, first guide it to the left, then to the right.

During yang hours, use yang *qi* and direct it to the left; during yin hours, use yin *qi* and direct it to the right, following the same method as for yang. If the body has ailments, direct *qi* to the affected area without regard to yin or yang hours—simply swallow the primordial *qi* and guide it downward immediately, ensuring it is not disordered. This prolonged moderation of *qi* is also called a "minor attainment."

Some, upon first hearing of directing *qi*, may laugh, asking, "*Qi*—what is it that you command?" *Qi* is the function of spirit, intention is the numen of spirit, and spirit commands *qi*, while *qi* moves the body—this is the activity of spirit. What is strange about it? Thus, when spirit desires movement, *qi* pulls the body to move; when spirit desires to run, *qi* pulls the body to run; when spirit desires to go outward, *qi* pulls the body outward; when spirit desires to rise, *qi* pulls the body to rise. This is the spirit’s employment of abundant *qi*. Just as eating enables one to walk and move upon the earth, when *qi* is mastered subtly, spirit can make the body move in emptiness—this is the numen of intention as spirit.

Using yang *qi* with a firm resolve, the jade stalk only releases yang *qi*, not bone essence, and its use makes it increasingly firm—this is a "minor attainment." In winter, imagine being in a chamber with yang *qi* entering from others, and one feels warm—this is also a "minor attainment." In hot weather, sitting indoors and imagining yin *qi* entering makes one feel cool—this too is a "minor attainment." Those who attain this after practice are also said to have a "minor attainment."

When *qi* is harmonized, the abdomen’s skin gradually thickens—this is a "minor attainment." Thus, the body frequently sheds skin—this is also a "minor attainment." Using yin *qi* makes one as cool as iron and as hard as stone—this is a "minor attainment." Using yang *qi*, one can ascend steep mountains and cliffs—this is a "minor attainment." Using yang *qi* makes the body light and agile—this is a "minor attainment." In summer, standing among trees and using yin *qi* makes the leaves of grasses and trees moist—this is a "minor attainment." For those suffering from cold or heat illnesses, rubbing with yin or yang hands cures the ailment instantly—this is also a "minor attainment." By listening to strings and pipes in imagination, one can foresee good or ill fortune—this too is a "minor attainment."

Seeing with inner vision, the secrets of ghosts and spirits cannot be concealed—this too is a "minor attainment." The mind discerns subtle intentions, possessing wisdom beyond the ordinary—this too is a "minor attainment." For extraordinary formulas, esoteric methods, ancient artifacts, and rare treasures unknown to others, the mind intuits their nature—this too is a "minor attainment." Myriad spirits come to attend and serve—this too is a "minor attainment." Using the *qi* within one’s body to generate the *qi* of another’s five viscera—this is a wondrous attainment.

When primordial *qi* is stored within, with no ingress or egress, and the regulated breath reaches the place of no orifices, even the act of breathing becomes imperceptible—this is what the noble lords call "one who has slipped the register, a fugitive no longer governed by the Great Yin," a wondrous state. Refining flesh and refining bones, becoming light and pure, ascending to float among the spirits of Heaven and Earth, transforming at will—this is the pinnacle of *daoyin*.

Yet this has not yet merged with the inner true spirit in its wanderings; such a one has not entered the rank of the Perfected. This is called the "Perfected." This wondrous *qi*-guard method was transmitted by Master Zhang Guo of Dragon Ridge, most wondrous indeed.

Master Qin Xin said: The Perfected, surnamed Zhang and named Guo, was styled by Emperor Xuanzong as Master Tongxuan. He appeared suddenly, with no known lineage, yet his divine transformations were as free as those of the ancient highest Perfected. Someone asked: Did he ever serve in the world?

Here the *bingzi* year is said to have been his appointment as a scribe. Yet no such record appears in the histories, and the transmitted *qi*-methods, absent from the immortal classics, are thus the secret treasures of the Daoist tradition. Practiced in stillness for twenty-one days, they allow one to see clearly through the intestines and stomach, to restore youth and reverse aging, to ride the clouds and traverse the void, ascending into the morning mist—this may be awaited with toes raised in anticipation. Only those whose *qi*-signs harmonize with the Dao may receive this transmission. Take heed!

Master Qishi said: Within the human abdomen, there are three barriers, including one at the heart. When first practicing *qi*-ingestion, one invariably feels fullness below the heart and in the stomach; simply eat less, and with prolonged practice, the passage will naturally open downward. When the barrier below the viscera is reached, fullness is felt in the abdomen; with persistent practice, one senses the *qi* arriving at the cinnabar field below the navel, where it begins to circulate throughout the body. Only when the *qi* has not yet entered the *jiuzhong* does one feel the *qi* emerge there—then one gains the ability to heal others.

Beginners must practice in a quiet place, proceeding with meticulous care. The *qi* will naturally enter the abdomen, and this may be done whether walking, standing, sitting, or in any other circumstance. If the *qi* in the stomach has not descended into the navel and abdomen, it will not enter the other regions, making success difficult.

When first learning *qi*-ingestion, one must, upon inhaling, pause the breath briefly, as if holding it until fullness is felt. Upon exhaling, reduce the breath by two-thirds, then pause again briefly before swallowing. After swallowing, repeat the process until the abdomen is full, then rest. This must be practiced day and night, in all four seasons.

When first drawing *qi* inward, intending it to enter the cinnabar field, it easily scatters if the mind is distracted; one must ensure the *qi* connects seamlessly. Once the *qi* has entered the cinnabar field, even if one ceases *qi*-ingestion, the *qi* will not disperse.

The four seasons refer to dawn, dusk, midnight, and noon. If the heart feels full, do not ingest *qi*; instead, take a small amount of licorice or cassia heart to disperse the fullness. If the cinnabar field is not yet full, it has not reached fullness.

When the original *qi* descends, one naturally feels a slight oppression. When first practicing *qi*-ingestion, one must use the prone and supine postures at dawn and dusk, while at midnight and noon, only the supine posture is used.

For the supine posture, use a low pillow, lie on the back, draw in the shoulders, raise the knees, and extend the hands to the sides of the ribs. Then swallow the *qi* ten times, and the cinnabar field will be full. After an hour of swallowing, guide the *qi* at will into the *jiuzhong*.

For the prone posture, lie with the abdomen flat on the bed, support the chest with a quilt to raise it, and extend the hands and feet. Then swallow the *qi* ten times, each time guiding it with the mind to descend along the spine and exit through the "ripe viscera."

At dawn and dusk, when practicing *qi*-ingestion, first adopt the prone posture, then the supine. With each swallow, make a sound as you guide the *qi* downward into the cinnabar field, and also make a sound as it descends along the spine. Ten swallows per posture are sufficient. If one does not know how to make the sound, even three or five swallows will not suffice; one must learn to make the sound to succeed. Without this intention, the effort is in vain.

When swallowing *qi*, always swallow deeply and slowly in the throat; do not do so forcefully, as this may provoke coughing. With each swallow, pause for ten breaths in between, and take breaks as needed, proceeding with ease and guiding the *qi* with the mind.

Beyond the four regular *qi*-ingestion sessions, if at any time the abdomen feels deficient in *qi* or the strength wanes, swallow as much as desired. When first practicing *qi*-ingestion, the *qi* often descends from the "ripe viscera"; gradually stabilize it by guiding it with the mind to disperse.

When first practicing *qi*-ingestion, the mind must be open and free of doubt, without fear. If fear is present, the *qi* will be difficult to circulate. When the body’s strength is harmonized, the mind must be joyful and content, free from desire for fame or achievement—then progress will be made day by day, with boundless delight.

One must not think of food, remaining open and free of distractions—only then will success come. If thoughts of food arise, they must be suppressed; if one does not take them seriously, the mind will still dwell on them. Those who can suppress such thoughts will remain undistracted even when facing sumptuous feasts all day.

As long as one does not miss the proper times for *qi*-ingestion, the cinnabar field will remain full. Even if one engages in worldly affairs during the day, cultivation is not abandoned. Missing an hour or two occasionally is of no consequence. For those who have succeeded in *qi*-ingestion, even if they do not practice it all day, their *qi* will remain sufficient—its wonders are inexhaustible.

Once the cinnabar field below the navel is full, one may call out, read, or converse with others all day without losing strength. One should still engage in light movement to guide the *qi* downward. After mastering *qi*-ingestion, eating is not harmful to the *qi*; even after a full meal, swallowing *qi* will cause it to resonate until it reaches the area below the navel. After success, one may eat while practicing *qi*-ingestion, and the descending *qi* will not interfere with the practice.

To expel all waste from the abdomen, simply refrain from eating for twenty days—this is even better. If one eats immediately after *qi*-ingestion, the results will not be refined. Each day, drinking a little medicinal wine is beneficial. If one craves food, a small amount of ginger-honey broth will settle the stomach, but one must not eat much. Abstaining from all foods is best.

One must be utterly sincere and free of fear. Even if the body or chest feels oppressed or unwell, it is of no concern—with time, it will improve. Do not eat fruits, as they may unsettle the abdomen or leave residue, hindering the flow of *qi*. Keep the abdomen empty to allow the *qi* to circulate.

With persistent practice, one will naturally sense a change in spirit and vitality, with the body growing stronger day by day, its clarity unmatched. After prolonged *qi*-ingestion, will one’s eyes naturally discern good and evil? One will perceive others’ inner nature from their outward appearance. With a sincere heart, after twenty-one days, one will internally visualize the intestines and stomach. Without such sincerity, prolonged practice will eventually open the passage, allowing one to internally visualize the five viscera in vivid detail—its wonders are beyond words.

One’s skin and flesh will become resilient, neither gaining nor losing weight, and one will not fall ill. If the practice is improper or the resolve is not firm, one may grow weak.

In the human body, the original *qi* constantly enters and exits through the mouth and nose. By restraining its outflow and keeping the cinnabar field full, one will not feel hunger, the spirit will be clear and bright, and even death will be unattainable.

When the cinnabar field is full of ingested *qi* and one feels stifled, allow it to exit through the four limbs and the crown of the head. Above all, prevent it from dispersing through the mouth and nose. Though one may consume all manner of rich foods, the body will only grow hollowly plump, inviting a hundred ailments and gradually leading to death’s door. For those who indulge in wine and meat, though they may feel vigorous and strong for a time, all manner of illnesses easily arise, and miasmas, pestilence, and poisons will harm them upon encounter. By ingesting the original *qi* and practicing this over time, no toxin can cause injury, and every illness may be cured—with prolonged practice, one will come to know this naturally.

When first completing the ingestion of *qi*, if it surges upward and exits through the mouth or nose, one must swallow saliva but not inhale, lest external *qi* enter. Beginners who draw in too much *qi* may experience bloating, discomfort, or rumbling sounds; in such cases, repeatedly guide the *qi* with intention to expel stagnant waste from the intestines. Once the bowels are empty, all will be well, and the *qi* will settle calmly in the abdomen. If the waste is not fully expelled and the intestines remain unsettled, one may allow a brief release of one or two bouts of flatulence to ease the discomfort. Though some *qi* may be lost in the process, simply ingest more to replenish it, ensuring the cinnabar field remains full at all times—this may be maintained for a full day and night.

In total, there are six periods for ingesting *qi*: *zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu*—these six intervals of day and night are when the cinnabar field opens to receive it. The essential subtleties of the *qi* method conclude here.
