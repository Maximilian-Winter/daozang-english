### **Instructions for Superior Practitioners on Refining Qi**

When refining qi, lie supine with the body relaxed. Slowly rinse the mouth with sweet spring water and swallow it. Do not hold the breath in the mouth; simply exhale through the mouth and inhale through the nose, ensuring no foul qi enters. Gently contract the nostrils—do not overfill, for extreme fullness makes recovery difficult.

After five breaths, exhale once; do not overdo it. Count each breath to ten, then bend the fingers to tally ninety breaths. If fatigued, rest briefly. Four sets of ninety (360 breaths) complete one cycle of focused intent.

Visualize the yellow qi within the spleen, as large as a goose egg, and maintain this awareness. When the mind grows weary, first refine qi for three sets of seven (210 breaths). Refine qi until the abdomen feels evenly full; when full, store the qi without letting it escape. Hold the breath for seventy breaths, avoiding frequent interruptions. The qi should rise naturally, flowing through the four limbs until warmth descends to the feet.

Gradually regulate the qi, guiding it back to the stomach, throat, and esophagus, circling the navel once, twice, thrice, four times, then returning to the esophagus. Perform this refinement while lying supine, beginning at sunrise.

Refining qi for seventy breaths, repeated four or five times, will reverse white hair. To refine qi effectively, swiftly perform one set of nine or three sets of nine—four sets of nine complete the practice.

After one cycle of refinement, the body will feel no pain. Swiftly refine qi in urgent situations. When first storing qi, hold half a goose egg’s worth in the mouth while sleeping. Swallow a thousand times, constantly producing saliva, and use the mouth’s fluids until they deplete after two days. Then, for ten breaths, relax the body.

When relaxing the body, as if shedding clothes, perform three sets of seven (210 breaths) to complete one cycle. Practicing with unbound hair is optimal.

**Another Method:** Begin at the feet, tracing upward along the yin meridians. Follow the path of the urethra into the kidneys, then upward to the throat. Reverse the flow, guiding the qi like the threads of a loom, directing it straight into the throat, then downward into the lower abdomen, nourishing and infusing the feet.

Regularly absorb the five-colored qi, clearly visualizing them in the throat before guiding them downward along the throat meridian. Constantly preserve the Three Origins and Three Circles, embedding them in the kidneys. The kidney circle is encased in blue, which transitions to red, then yellow, and finally white—do not let the eyes wander.

The Three Circles are the Three Origins: the Mud Pill Palace (brain), the Crimson Palace (heart), and the Cinnabar Field (lower abdomen). The first circle is refining qi without ceasing.

Lie flat, close the eyes, shut the mouth, and let the hair loose. Extend both hands, slightly contract the abdomen, and gently contract the nostrils. Before fully exhaling, inhale again, ensuring the abdomen does not follow the breath.

Count ten breaths per finger bend, up to seventy breaths, then swallow. Once more, fill with qi, storing it in the throat meridian, allowing it to flow smoothly. After another seventy breaths, swallow again, guiding the qi from the flanks and lower abdomen upward into the brain.

The true external flanks are mottled, supporting the hair above. After three sets of seven (210 breaths), ensure the qi does not cross paths. Harmonize and guard the spirit and qi, renewing the body’s vitality and maintaining constant peace.

If the five viscera lack governance, the body grows emaciated, sinews slacken, bones weaken, and walking becomes laborious. Vitality withers, skin peels, fingers lose color, essence and qi deplete, and vitality wanes—these are the signs.

### **The Celestial Elder’s Qi Method for the Ten Heavenly Stems and Twelve Months**

**Jia Day:** When essence reaches the first ten-day period, purge the five viscera. Thirst drives one to drink water and broth; the complexion fades. Urine turns reddish-yellow, and bowel movements become slightly difficult, the stool firm and qi robust. The intestines rumble as if injured. Expel perverse qi without fear. The practice is arduous, the eyes dim. The seasons of spring and autumn, the length of days and months, the waxing and waning of yin and yang—all follow the scriptural patterns.

**Yi Day:** When essence reaches the second ten-day period, grain qi begins to wane, and perverse qi flees. True qi weakens, taking water as its root. Suddenly, one feels disoriented, the will unsettled. Guard it without loss. The Jade Flower of the Flowery Pond serves as the method. Externally, one appears haggard, the body frail, movement difficult.

**Bing Day:** When essence reaches the third ten-day period, essence and qi return to their original state, grain qi untainted. The two qi intermingle, neither settling nor stabilizing. The mind remains tranquil, uninterested in grain. Essence and qi reside within, flourishing and active. The effect of utmost sincerity is evident—strive to fulfill it. Hold firm without loss; one achievement completes the task. The Jade Flower of the Flowery Pond becomes pure and radiant.

**Ding Day:** When the Dao reaches the fourth ten-day period, grain qi departs the body, and essence qi governs alone. Meridian qi weakens, coming and going intermittently. The complexion grows lustrous, daily receiving its former vitality. The heart and will rejoice, fear vanishing. Flesh regenerates daily, blood and qi overflow. Radiance and smoothness align with proper measure. Yin and yang are managed, harmonized, supplemented, and drained. The body becomes moist and glossy.

**Wu Day:** When the Dao reaches the fifth ten-day period, essence qi rests securely, external affairs set aside. The five viscera harmonize, the spirit nurtured within. Lying down brings comfort; the skin renews. Movement and walking proceed smoothly, essence unharmed. Spirit and qi drift, dreams and waking visions appear. External events startle, as if responding to sounds. Calls and shadows manifest; the hair stands firm, the will resolute. The arrival of high essence is confirmed as effective.

**Ji Day:** When the Dao reaches the sixth ten-day period, essence qi flows smoothly, upper and lower harmonized. Hair and skin become lustrous, limbs agile. Walking resumes its former ease; ears and eyes grow sharp. The will is serene, fear gone. Bending the body is effortless; joints move freely. Grain is no longer craved; swallowing qi nourishes the embryo. Wine may be drunk, food eaten, in whatever measure desired, without restriction.

**Geng Day:** When the Dao reaches the seventh ten-day period, essence qi flows unimpeded, serene and settled. The orifices harmonize; the five viscera grow pure and still. Breathing in refined qi, one washes away evil and draws in the upright. Shedding the old and embracing the new, one rests in clarity and purity. Within, the will and qi are ordered; without, one’s appearance daily flourishes. Movement becomes lively, the feet light as if treading upon air. Fond of quietude, one avoids contention with others. The efficacy of supreme essence is recorded in the Daoist canon.

**Xin Day:** When the Dao reaches the eighth ten-day period, qi roams to the eight poles, nourishing and defending the body in fullness. Qi flows smoothly, traversing the branching meridians. Above and below, within and without, all is moistened and harmonious. The five viscera stabilize, ascending to the immortal’s court. Free from craving, one rests in tranquility. The heart and will are at peace, untroubled by alarm. Within, no fear arises; joy fills one’s days. Holding fast without loss, the Dao manifests and spirit is perfected. With such proven efficacy, one transcends the world and attains long life.

**Ren Day:** When the Dao reaches the ninth ten-day period, essence qi fills to abundance, the numinous spirit expands. The timid grow resolute, the weak grow strong. What was diminished is restored; what was impaired is harmonized. Without seeking, it comes of itself; without effort, it finds ease. Radiance and moisture flourish; the voice grows resonant. Sweetness fills the mouth, fragrance the nose. The Jade Pool and Flowery Pond ever abide, unceasing. Such is the work of supreme essence—one may follow the Dao in practice.

**Gui Day:** When the Dao reaches the tenth ten-day period, essence qi arrives in full, the spirit’s path unobstructed. The body grows light and sturdy, flesh and spirit suffused with vitality. The eyes open to all sights, the will and qi soar. Free from desire, the belly and bowels are cleansed. Essence preserved and spirit abiding, virtue and Dao converge in splendor. From the first ingestion of food and drink, one gains enduring longevity. In vigor, one knows not age, dwelling among true immortals. Rising and sinking with the Dao, one attains the numinous.

**The Method of Ingesting Qi:**
Begin on the day heaven bestows upon humanity—*jiachen* or *geng* days—or on the days when the four seasons are in their prime. Then commence taking the elixir.

At first, ingest nine full breaths as the measure. Each subsequent day, reduce one meal. By the tenth day, grain is wholly abandoned. All other foods may be set aside at once, for one may live on qi alone.

In the method of ingesting qi, swallow ten jujubes with ten breaths, using the jujubes as counters to track the amount of qi consumed. When the mouth fills with the Jade Pool’s Flowery Pond, the Sweet Dew and Nectar Spring, saliva flows of itself.

In the Dao of ingesting qi, qi is the treasure. After one year, the skin and flesh grow full and radiant. After two years, the joints harmonize. After three years, the sinews and bones grow firm and strong. After four years, the marrow fills the bones.

Heaven has four seasons; thus, the ingestion of qi accords with them. After four years, spirit and form commune. When this communion spans years, one becomes as the numinous: unseen in form, unheard in sound, arriving without movement, unknown yet present. This is the unity of form and spirit—such a one is called a *zhenren*. On the same day, one attains long life, sharing the heavens’ numinous power.

**Monthly Ingestion of Qi:**
- **First month:** Inhale 160 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 200 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Second month:** Inhale 180 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 180 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Third month:** Inhale 200 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 160 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Fourth month:** Inhale 220 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 140 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Fifth month:** Inhale 240 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 120 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Sixth month:** Inhale 220 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 140 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Seventh month:** Inhale 200 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 160 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Eighth month:** Inhale 180 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 180 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Ninth month:** Inhale 160 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 200 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Tenth month:** Inhale 140 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 220 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Eleventh month:** Inhale 120 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 240 breaths of yin qi at dusk.
- **Twelfth month:** Inhale 140 breaths of yang qi at dawn; 220 breaths of yin qi at dusk.

Yang qi is drawn in through the nose; yin qi is drawn in through the mouth. In these two qi, if one can persist day and night through the twelve months—completing one cycle of heaven and then another—one’s years will match heaven’s. Thus ends the *Instructions for Cultivation to Dispel Delusion* by Lord Mao of the Upper Clarity, Controller of Destinies.
