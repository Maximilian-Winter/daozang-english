For those who cultivate the body and nurture life, who study the Dao and seek immortality—if their practice has not yet borne merit, yet they hold but a single thought, they shall surely attain accomplishment. Should their merit remain incomplete, and they dwell in the fleeting world, they may encounter demonic specters, malevolent spirits, ghosts, and spectral beings. These entities, perceiving the simulacrum, will flee in terror, daring not approach to bring harm.

Simply follow my incantations: burn incense, observe abstinence, calm the mind, and silently recite. For each simulacrum, chant the incantation for forty-nine days. Should calamity, peril, or misfortune draw near, swiftly recite it once in silence, grasp an object, and cast it aside to evade. One may roam as a spirit, divide the form, or transform the body, concealing oneself within wood or fire, burrowing into metal to dissolve, or submerging in water to feign drowning. Thus, when disaster or danger approaches, one may instantly cast it aside and escape.

This is a celestial mechanism, meant to be transmitted only by word of mouth. Yet I fear that earnest seekers in this world may forget, so I have recorded it to leave for posterity. Do not recklessly disclose it to the unworthy, those who debase the Dao. Should you withhold it from those who ought to receive it, misfortune will first befall your nine generations of ancestors. If you transmit it indiscriminately, revealing this celestial secret, your nine clans will be buried in ruin, and you shall forever remain a lowly ghost, unable to receive rebirth.

**First Simulacrum: Metal**
The west, *geng* and *xin*, domain of the White Tiger’s spirit.
The exalted Venus of the Nine Luminaries, guardian of the Purple Tenuity’s numinous star.
Lord of life, it fortifies the marrow and solidifies the body. The seven *po* souls do not stray; with three calls, it arrives, and with seven summons, it returns to the body.
It severs the self with blades, mends bones, and reconnects sinews.
Later, it transforms the body, dispelling suffering and peril.
Heed my incantation, and it shall act as commanded.

**Incantation:**
The west, *geng* and *xin*, the Mysterious Perfected of the Grand Tenuity.
Within, it corresponds to the six viscera, transmuting into the Lung Spirit.
Manifesting in the supreme, roaming the Cinnabar Field.
It steadfastly guards my life, serving the immortal’s use.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

For the incantation, on *geng* and *xin* days at the hour of *you*, burn incense and begin the recitation—do not open the mouth, but press the tongue against the upper palate and contemplate it thus. Maintain this for forty-nine days. Should misfortune or peril arise, regardless of time or place, whether moving or still, silently recite it once. Grasping a blade, freely divide the body; though no red blood flows, only a white essence emerges, congealing without spilling. Afterward, it naturally returns, reconnecting and restoring as before.

**Second Wooden Talisman**
The Azure Dragon of the east, belonging to *jia* and *yi*.
Responding to spring’s command, the celestial host of Jupiter.
It generates its *qi*, radiant as fragrant herbs.
Within, it corresponds to the Liver Spirit, occupying the office of the Chancellor.
Should I face peril, with three calls it manifests.
It divides and transforms the body, roaming afar.
To return to its original place, it appears upon beholding an object.

**Incantation:**
The east, *jia* and *yi*, chamber of the Azure Dragon.
Metal and wood take form, reverting to flesh and bone.
True metal steadfastly guards, never straying from left or right.
Divide the body and conceal it; through thought, it returns.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

The incantation is to be recited on a *geng* or *xin* day at the *mao* hour, with incense burned and the words silently murmured, inaudible to others. Thought alone is paramount, and it may be maintained for forty-nine days. Should misfortune arise, regardless of time or season, swiftly recite it in silence—whether walking, standing, or sitting—just once. Upon encountering wood, conceal the body within it to evade disaster, then divide and depart. To return, focus upon the original wood, and it will restore you to your former place.

**Third Water Talisman**
The north, *ren* and *gui*, the position of *hai* and *zi*.
The Dark Warrior presides, generating myriad moistures.
Its luster overflows with glory, corresponding within to the Kidney Spirit.
Adorned as the Lady of the Register, root of life and destiny.
Blood is called the "water number," transmuting and refining essence-*qi*.
Originally of the Yang, it harbors fire within Yin, aiding the floating world.
Should I face peril, three calls summon its presence.
Seven invocations follow the body, entering water without drowning.
Earth and wood sustain it; soul and spirit each reside apart.
The Three Peng submit, entering the Nine Realms.

**Incantation:**
The Perfected of stars and constellations, the Dark Warrior attends the body.
The Curved Array lends left support; the Azure Dragon assists.
The White Tiger upholds; the Soaring Serpent mounts beneath.
Following my form, through thought it returns.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

To invoke the incantation, choose a *geng* or *xin* day at the *zi* hour. Light incense and begin the recitation, refraining from speaking aloud—only silently intone it once. This may be maintained for forty-nine days. Should misfortune arise, regardless of whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, silently recite it once, then enter water, and the calamity shall be averted. There is no limit to the days one may remain submerged in safety. When ready to return, visualize the *qi* of the Kidney, and naturally emerge from the water, free from disaster.

**Fire Proxy, Fourth**
The Vermilion Bird of the South governs *bing* and *ding*. Mars blazes fiercely, the Fire Spirit in its full might. It burns away the Three Peng, and the Six Spirits stand eternal guard. The hun and po become pure and clear, the Six Roots firm and unshaken, inwardly aligned with the Heart Lord. Should I face peril, three calls summon its presence, never departing from my side. *Bing* and *ding* are fire; *ren* and *gui* are destruction. I enter the proxy, and my spirit-soul remains undying. My body is water; my life is earth. Earth and water contend, yet fire does not consume me.

**Incantation:**
The *bing* and *ding* of the South, the Crimson Dragon attends.
Yin spirits withdraw; Yang officials do not receive.
Through thought it returns; through use it fulfills the day.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

Invoke the incantation on a *geng* or *xin* day at the *wu* hour. Light incense and begin the recitation, ensuring no one hears. Silent contemplation is paramount. This may be maintained for forty-nine days. Should misfortune strike, regardless of the hour, swiftly enter a quiet chamber and settle your surroundings. Silently recite the incantation once, grasping bamboo or wood. All demons and malevolent spirits will flee. Then hold your breath and cease all movement, feigning death. Unaware, your family will believe you have passed. Let your body lie as if lifeless, covered in cloth. As your spirit wanders freely, allow them to proceed with burial. Your hun, po, and spirit remain still and unmoved. Your form follows the flame and returns; though the blaze may rage, it cannot burn you. When the fire subsides and the smoke clears, no trace of you shall be found.

**Earth Proxy, Fifth**
The Center governs *wu* and *ji*, the seat of all spirits. The Three Hun nurture earth, and earth gives birth to all things. Things transform and become *qi*; the Three Hun follow form. The Seven Po accompany the body, preserving my life and destiny. Cultivate earth, and nurturing earth brings forth life. Things transform and take shape; the Four Symbols return to earth. Through earth, life is sustained. Three calls summon its presence; seven invocations return it to the body, dispelling calamity. Heed my incantation, and your form shall shift with your will.

**Incantation:**
The *wu* and *ji* of the Center, primordial *qi* concealed within.
Yellow stands firm; through its movement, order is restored.
Cinnabar Yang does not refuse; Vermilion Yin shares its purpose.
Through my birth, I attain fulfillment; my four limbs are enriched by earth, lest excess arise.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

Invoke the incantation on a *geng* or *xin* day at the *chen* hour. Light incense and begin the recitation, ensuring no one hears. This may be maintained for forty-nine days. Should misfortune arise, regardless of the hour or whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, silently recite it once. Grasp an object, conceal yourself within the earth or a wall, and remain unseen. The object you hold shall serve as your likeness, rising and departing in your stead to evade the cycle of suffering. Once the peril has passed, return to your true form.

The Five Proxies comprise the method by which immortals conceal themselves in the world. Transmitted through the ages, they must not be divulged—this is the secret truth of cultivation. Should later scholars of resolve undertake this practice, they must recite with unwavering focus, avoiding any transgression. Those who hear of this method yet fail to master it must carefully maintain their recitation, lest they recklessly reveal heavenly secrets.

The *Concealment Method of the Perfected of Changbai Mountain, Yuan Yangzi*, is imparted to those of the Daoist heart. Follow it faithfully, and its efficacy shall be undeniable.

Thus concludes the *Five Proxies Discourse of Yuan Yangzi*.
