*The Supreme Treatise on Preserving Authenticity and Nurturing Life*

The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang;
The Dao of Earth, as softness and hardness;
The Dao of Man, as benevolence and righteousness.
Thus, within the vastness of Heaven and Earth, man is the most numinous of beings, modeling yin and receiving yang, subtly weighing the essence of nature and life.

The two forces are set in parallel, the four seasons advance in succession, and man dwells amid them—fleeting as lightning. With every thought that arises, vitality dims and fades. Life does not come again; what has passed cannot be retrieved. One must awaken the ears and eyes, refine the heart and spirit, cleanse away vexation and evil, and circulate the constructive and defensive qi. Never has there been one who, without study, could perfect his instrument, or without practice, could benefit his body!

Thus the Perfected One often says: “I do not preserve my nature by mere inaction; it is through study that I attain it.” Therefore, in my quest for the Dao, I receive and uphold the thousand scriptures and ten thousand precepts—all depends on the sincerity of the will.

Lord Laozi said: Heaven and Earth bestow essence, yin and yang distribute transformation, and the myriad things are born. Riding upon their karmic conditions, they divide the singular numinous Dao, uniting all mechanisms. Now, when man receives life:
In the first month, it is the *bao* (embryonic sac), where essence and blood congeal.
In the second month, it is the *tai* (embryo), where form begins to take shape.
In the third month, it is the *ti shen* (fearful spirit), where the three *hun* souls stir into life.
In the fourth month, it is the *yin ling* (yin spirit), where the seven *po* souls settle the form in stillness.
In the fifth month, the five phases distribute among the organs to pacify the spirit.
In the sixth month, the six pitch-standards regulate the six bowels to nourish the numinous.
In the seventh month, the seven essences open the orifices to transmit light.
In the eighth month, the eight luminous spirits are complete, and the true numinous descends.
In the ninth month, the palaces are arrayed to determine life.
In the tenth month, qi is full, and the myriad forms are complete.

The Supreme Unity and Mysterious Authenticity reside in the head as the Mud-Pill Sovereign, governing all spirits and marshaling the hundred numina to repel evil qi, refining the myriad kinds to stabilize the true origin. Thus, in cultivating authenticity, stillness and tranquil harmony can preserve long life.

The Perfected One said: Those whose spirit is strong attain long life; those whose qi is strong die young. Gentleness, reverence, and awe strengthen the spirit; rage and willful exertion strengthen the qi.

Whenever one pushes thought to extremes beyond one’s capacity, the will is harmed. When one lifts beyond one’s strength, the body is harmed. When one schemes beyond one’s ability, wisdom is harmed. When one vents fury beyond one’s station, qi is harmed. Accumulated sorrow unceasingly weakens the *hun* spirit; accumulated evil unceasingly scatters the *po* spirit. Excessive joy and anger prevent the spirit from returning to its chamber; inconstancy in love and hate prevents the spirit from guarding the form. Indulging desires wearies the spirit; obsessive thoughts corrupt it. Prolonged speech and laughter injure the heart and qi; prolonged sitting and standing damage the sinews and bones. Improper sleep harms the liver and gallbladder; leaping, running, and violent panting injure the stomach and bowels. Shouting, cursing, and rage harm the gallbladder’s qi.

Thus, when yin and yang fail to interact, sores and tumors arise; when the bedchamber is unrestrained, exhaustion and emaciation follow. Now, man’s lifespan in the world does not exceed thirty thousand days—how can there be no single day of cultivation and repair? How can there be no single day of harm? To merely blame the spirit for not guarding or the body for not being sound is like retreating while hoping to swiftly catch up—how can this be achieved?

Therefore, the essentials of nurturing life are: do not spit far, do not walk hastily, do not listen for long, do not gaze for long, do not sit to the point of fatigue, do not lie to the point of exhaustion. Put on clothes before the cold arrives; remove them before the heat arrives. Do not eat only when ravenous, lest you overeat; do not drink only when parched, lest you overindulge. Overeating breeds lumps and masses; excessive drinking gathers phlegm and stagnation. Avoid extreme idleness, extreme labor, profuse sweating, and exposure to wind while breathing. Do not race a carriage while drunk or ride a horse when full. Avoid eating much raw or cold food, or overindulging in rich and fatty fare. Do not drink wine and face the wind, or expose the head after washing the hair. In winter, avoid extreme warmth; in summer, extreme cold. Extreme winter warmth breeds spring epidemics; extreme summer cold brings autumn malaria and dysentery. Do not sleep beneath the stars and moon, or approach corpses while hungry. Do not fan yourself while sleeping, or eat with your head exposed. Do not drink cold water in intense heat, or approach a blazing stove in bitter cold. After washing your hair, avoid fierce winds; when famished, do not brave thick fog.

Moreover, the five flavors entering the mouth must not be imbalanced. Excessive sourness harms the spleen; excessive sweetness harms the kidneys; excessive acridity harms the liver; excessive saltiness harms the heart; excessive bitterness harms the lungs. All these cloud the spirit and *hun*, disorder the five viscera, and though they may not immediately harm a person, over time they accumulate decline and decay. They sever life more swiftly than an axe, erode nature more fiercely than wolves and tigers.

Now, the subtle signs correspond to the five phases, subtly connecting the four movements. Tracing their patterns is not mistaken; investigating their principles is ever more excellent. One should deeply guard them to preserve one’s authenticity. To eat when not hungry or drink when not thirsty both invite harm. Eating when not hungry wearies the spleen; drinking when not thirsty distends the stomach.

The body should be regularly active, and food regularly moderate. Do not labor to extremes, nor reduce food to emptiness. In winter, do not leave the stomach empty at dawn; in summer, do not eat to fullness at night. In spring and summer, rise early; in autumn and winter, retire late. Rise not before the cock’s crow, nor after sunrise.

When the source of the heart is clear, the true numinous guards its place; when the sea of qi is still, evil things depart the body.

Deceit and pretense bring sorrow to the spirit; flattery and sycophancy cause the spirit to wither. Envy and resentment toward others invite misfortune in one’s calculations, while harming living things must shorten one’s years. Performing a single good deed delights the hun-spirit; committing a single evil act pleases the po-spirit. The hun desires life for others, the po desires death.

Thus, the heart is the ruler of the five viscera, and qi is the messenger of the hundred bones. The ruler should remain tranquil and non-acting, while the messenger should flow freely without stagnation. Therefore, rising and resting follow the four seasons, carefully observing the signs of dawn and dusk; food and drink regulate the six bowels, adjusting to what is suitable for cold and heat. Movement rides the steed of Great Harmony, while circulation travels the chariot of Profound Stillness. When the four limbs are weary, lie down and guide them; when the heart and chest are congested, practice exhalation and inhalation to disperse it. Block the source of illness, regularly applying techniques of supplementation and drainage; expel pathogenic qi, ever abiding in the subtle mechanism of silence.

Thus, endure anger to overcome yin, restrain joy to assist yang. The Niwan sovereign desires frequent combing, the Celestial Drum desires constant sounding. The eyes never tire of gazing, the saliva never tires of swallowing, the heart never tires of harmony, and qi never tires of peace. If one can persist in such practices without neglect, one may then consume herbal medicines to first remedy one’s deficiencies. With unrelenting diligence, one may later refine minerals and metals to secure one’s authenticity.

This is the ordered method of nurturing life, the guiding principle of preserving longevity—truly the wondrous gateway of supplementation and the profound teaching of prolonging life. Yet if one indulges in reckless pleasure through galloping pursuits, exhausts the spirit and taxes the mind with cunning deceit, values wealth and treasures, and wallows in favor and delight, neglecting the arts of preservation and failing to observe the rules of careful guarding—then in an instant, qi will be depleted in the heat of contention, and the body withered amid sensual indulgence.

Viewed thus, one should deeply awaken. For when the heart’s source is still, the spirit and hun are at peace; when desires arise, the true numinous dissolves. A mind consumed by anxiety and a body wearied by toil—like extinguishing fire with kindling—is truly lamentable.

Therefore, the Perfected One composed this verse:
*Indifference and detachment keep their distance,
While recklessness and excess draw near.
Though one may not perish outright,
The spirit will surely be harmed.
To harm the spirit is to lose one’s authenticity—
The cause of injury and decay.
The cause of injury and decay—
How can these be empty words!*
