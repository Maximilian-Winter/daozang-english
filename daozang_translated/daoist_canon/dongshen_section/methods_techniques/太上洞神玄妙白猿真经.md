### **Six Jia Divine Archery Method**
Shoot to command the buddhas; shoot without missing; shoot to subdue malevolent spirits.
Shoot upward to benefit the lower; shoot southward to penetrate the north.
Six Jia and Six Ding, Celestial Bow Star Lords, Heavenly Arrow Venerables—hear my invocation and descend.
Assist my divine arrows to follow intent as if by spirit.
Shoot eastward to strike the west; shoot southward to penetrate the north.
Shoot upward to elicit response below; shoot downward to invade and harm.
Shoot without fail; at the moment of shooting, command the collapse of fate.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

This method is performed on a *jiǎzǐ* day. Prepare offerings of dried venison, salt, tea, wine, fruits, pure water, and six portions of fine incense, along with paper money, cloud horses, and a small measure each of ox blood, sheep blood, and pig blood. Also offer an ox heart, black pig liver, white sheep head, and fresh carp, following the *Hunyuan* ritual protocol.

At the third watch of midnight (*zǐ* hour), hold a colored silk pouch in the left hand and a vermilion brush in the right. Face the appropriate direction, recite the incantation forty-nine times, and draw in *qi* forty-nine times, blowing it onto the silk and brush. Inscribe the talisman and place it on the altar for offerings. At the fifth watch, disperse the ritual. Store the talisman in a pouch of its original color and hang it in the spirit chamber, aligning it with the corresponding direction.

When using the talisman, follow the ten-day cycle: face the appropriate direction, hold the arrow in the left hand and the talisman in the right, recite the incantation seven times, draw in *qi* seven times, and blow it onto the arrow shaft and talisman. Wipe them clean before shooting.

### **Arrow Crafting**
On a *gēngshēn* day at dawn, enlist six artisans to craft arrows in silence, each positioned according to one of the Six Jia directions. Within three days, they must complete one hundred twenty arrows, only attaching the arrowheads later.

Wait until a *dīngmǎo* day, then have the six artisans attach the arrowheads according to their respective positions, inserting the talismans into the arrow shafts. The arrows crafted on the *gēngshēn* day are offered on the altar on a *jiǎzǐ* night.

Hang them in the spirit chamber, arranging them on a table for presentation.

### **Forging the Azure Dragon Sword and Commanding Spirits to Gather the Five Metals and Eight Minerals for Great Elixir Refinement**
To perceive all spirits in heaven, earth, and the human realm, and to seize them for command—dispatching them into famous mountains and grottoes to gather the eight minerals for great elixir refinement and the five metals to select adamantine gold, then forging the Six Jia Eight Spirit Azure Dragon Sword—proceed as follows:

On a *là* day, obtain a pair of owl eyes, six *qián* of translucent realgar, one *qián* of cinnabar from a wall, and grind them in the spirit chamber without allowing anyone to witness. Grind continuously while reciting the incantation. On a day when the cyclical signs align with the southwest, grind silently from the *mǎo* hour to the *wǔ* hour, then form the powder into pellets.

On the same day, bow before the spirits, light incense, and present pure water. Face the northwest, recite the incantation, hold the elixir in the left hand and pure water in the right, pass them over the incense, and recite the incantation seven times. Draw in the northwest *qi* seven times, blow it into the elixir and water, then swallow the water while facing northwest. Consume the Nine Radiance Elixir over nine days.

On the ninth night, at the third watch, burn a censer of incense. Hold a piece of white paper, two *cùn* and four *fēn* in length and one *cùn* and two *fēn* in width, in the left hand, and a brush in the right. Face the northwest, recite the incantation seven times, draw in *qi* seven times, and blow it onto the paper and brush. Inscribe the **Pure Eye Talisman** in vermilion, place it in pure water, and expose it under the stars and moon until dawn the next day, before sunrise. Wash both eyes seven times with the water, facing the Gate of Heaven, then wash the feet and eyes. This enables vision of all spirits in heaven, earth, and the human realm.

Select one to three capable and spiritually perceptive individuals to dispatch into famous mountains and grottoes to gather the eight minerals for great elixir refinement and the five metals. Choose the adamantine gold and have artisans forge the sword and elixir.

Consuming one pellet grants eternal longevity and the ability to wander distant mountains in search of immortals.

When one person dons armor, holds the elixir in the left hand and pure water in the right, and prepares to consume the elixir on a *là* day, recite the incantation:
*Divine owl spirits, the Emperor bestows upon me your eyes.*
*Cinnabar and realgar harmonize, refining the divine elixir.*
*After consuming nine pellets, my wisdom eyes become luminous.*
*In heaven, earth, and the human realm, all spirits appear before me.*
*Clasping fists and joining palms, they heed my commands.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

After consuming all the elixir pellets, recite the **Pure Eye Talisman** incantation:
*Venerable Heavenly Eye Spirits, hear my descent.*
*Divine radiance penetrates, activating the talisman’s power.*

In heaven, on earth, and among human spirits—when I cast but a single glance, all reveal their true forms. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!

For refining the great elixir, gather the following ingredients: six taels each of cinnabar, realgar, sulfur, orpiment, and actinolite; eight taels each of sal ammoniac, borax, and mercury. Use half a catty of silver to fashion a container to hold these eight substances. Then take one tael of fine gold, hammer it into two sheets the size of the container, and place four taels of refined saltpeter beneath the mouth of the container. Lay one gold sheet over the saltpeter, add the eight minerals, then cover with the second gold sheet and another four taels of saltpeter. Seal the container with one tael of silver wire, binding it crosswise.

Next, take one tael each of gold-star stone and silver-star stone, four taels of white clay, two taels each of white and red halloysite, one catty of yellow earth, four taels of *ling* (spirit herb), and four taels of motherwort. Mix these into a paste to firmly seal the container, then dry it thoroughly.

Dig a pit three feet and six inches deep and place the medicine inside. Begin the process on the Winter Solstice. Nurture the elixir daily with thirty-six taels of charcoal fire. Each morning, approach the furnace, form the Jade Mudra with your left hand, grasp a sword in your right, and recite the incantation forty-nine times. Recite it once every fifteen days. Pour one sheng and two ge of ash-free wine through the furnace. On the day before the Beginning of Spring, burn sixty-four taels of charcoal. On the morning of the spring day, open the furnace, retrieve the elixir, and bury it three feet and six inches underground to dispel the fire toxin. After three days, unearth it, grind it into powder, and form pellets.

On the same day, use pure water, recite the incantation, and consume the elixir. One pellet must be taken over three hundred and sixty days to achieve the Dao of eternal life and immortality, rendering all things incapable of harm.

**Sealing Elixir Incantation**
Hold the medicine with both hands, pass it over incense, form the Jade Mudra, recite the incantation seven times, and pour wine:
*Eight minerals, great elixir—I refine with eight spirits.*
*Guard the elixir furnace, let no evil intrude.*
*By imperial decree, I command: do not transgress.*
*Should any violate, behead them without delay.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

**Approaching the Furnace Incantation**
*I refine the elixir, I patrol this furnace.*
*Eight spirits follow me, let no evil intrude.*
*Should any spirit steal the elixir, behead and annihilate them.*
*Protect my elixir furnace, by imperial decree refine it to perfection.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

**Opening the Furnace Incantation**
*I have refined the elixir, I summon the eight spirits.*
*Together we open the furnace, let no evil intrude.*
*Spirits, demons, and malevolent beings—those who violate shall be annihilated.*
*Whoever approaches my furnace shall be slain; whoever steals my elixir shall meet misfortune.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

**Opening the Furnace and Retrieving the Elixir Incantation**
*By imperial decree, grant me wine to pour upon the furnace.*
*Eight spirits, partake of the offering and ever guard my furnace.*
*All malevolent spirits—those who violate shall be annihilated.*
*All baneful influences—be utterly repelled.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

**Dispelling Fire Toxin Method**
Form the Seven Jade Mudras of Heavenly Qi:
*Eight spirits, watch over the elixir as fire toxin disperses.*
*The elixir is perfected, ascending amidst auspicious clouds.*
*Let no thief intrude upon the fire-toxin-burning elixir.*
*Whoever harms my elixir shall die; whoever violates it shall perish.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

**Elixir Water Incantation**
*Pure and numinous, in harmony with the Dao and the True.*
*Heavenly One’s true qi ascends and descends without cease.*
*The elixir is wrought by transformation; the great elixir is its essence.*
*Preserve my longevity—today I consume it, ascending to the Jade Capital.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

Once the elixir is complete, combine all into one container, remove the earth, grind it into powder, and form three hundred and sixty-nine pellets with glutinous rice. Begin consuming the elixir without missing a single day. If even one day is missed, the merit will not be achieved. Hold the pellet in your left hand, water in your right, recite the incantation seven times, and blow into the elixir water before consuming it.

**Forging the Sword**
On a *wu-wu* day, have a craftsman prepare a mold. When pouring molten gold, do not let it touch the mold or the refining area. Patrol the site, form the Jade Mudra with both hands, recite the incantation, and cease only when the gold is fully refined. Do not recite or patrol otherwise.

**Incantation:**
*Refining the five metals, with the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits.*
*Eight spirits assist—may the Azure Dragon Sword be forged.*
*Across a thousand, ten thousand miles, arrive in an instant.*
*Even from ten thousand miles away, seize the head of the target and present it.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

Once the molten gold is ready, cease patrolling and recite the incantation. Take a sheet of blue paper, eight inches long and three inches wide. Hold the paper in your left hand, the brush in your right, draw seven breaths of Heaven’s Gate qi, and blow onto the paper and brush. After inscribing the design, hold it in your left hand, form the Sword Mudra with your right, step the Dipper, and cast it into the molten gold to forge the sword.

**Incantation:**
*Azure Dragon, Azure Dragon, descend in true darkness.*
*By imperial decree, the dragon sword is instantly forged.*
*The Azure Dragon enters, its mighty power unleashed.*
*Across ten thousand miles of mountains, arrive swift as the wind.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

**Forging the Sword**
Select sixty-four taels of diamond-grade gold. Forge the blade to a length of three feet, the hilt six inches, totaling three feet and six inches. The blade near the hilt should be three inches and four fen wide, tapering to one inch and two fen at the tip. Once forged, retrieve it, hang it in the spirit chamber, and store it in a blue bag.

On a *jia-zi* day, construct a furnace three feet and six inches high, bury it at the center, and insert the sword mold into the sword case. The furnace’s interior should be three inches and six fen from the sword case on all sides. Begin refining the sword on the *jia-zi* day. Arrange eight portions of vegetarian offerings, tea, wine, and seasonal vegetables before the furnace. Burn incense daily and refine the sword with twenty-four taels of charcoal. Do not replenish the offerings. Use eight taels of charcoal to kindle the fire, then add sixteen taels to the furnace. Arrange them evenly, burn incense, and patrol the furnace. Form the Jade Mudra with your left hand, the *zi* character with your right, and recite the incantation forty-nine times. Draw forty-nine breaths of Heaven’s Gate qi and blow them into the furnace.

Each day, perform the furnace patrol once in this manner. Every fifteen days, pour the furnace once, completing one cycle in sixty *jia-zi* days. On the *jia-zi* day, open the furnace to retrieve the sword; on the *ding-mao* day, craft the case. Proceed as follows.

**Distant Furnace Incantation**
Swiftly descend, Azure Dragon,
Divine path draws the numinous.
Pierce into the spirit sword,
Eight gods illuminate with clarity.
By imperial command I invoke,
Guard and shield this body of mine.
Wielding the spirit sword,
Together we ascend to Jade Capital.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees.*

**Pouring Furnace Incantation**
Eight gods stand guard,
Six *jia* and six *ding*.
Together they defend my sword,
Lest evil intrude.
Azure Dragon enters the spirit,
Into my sword’s core.
Annihilate all specters,
Instantly slay all foes.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees.*

When pouring the furnace, form the Jade Mudra with your left hand, hold ashless [charcoal dust] in your right, and pour one *sheng* and two *ge* of wine. Walk the distant furnace circuit, recite the incantation seven times, draw seven breaths of qi, and blow them into the wine in the furnace. After pouring the furnace, open it on the *jia-zi* day.

**Opening Furnace Incantation**
Now I open the furnace,
Eight gods descend and attend.
Expel all specters,
Let none dare intrude.
Azure Dragon ever guards,
Firm and true, we walk as one.
Never part from me,
I discern all karmic fates.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees.*

When opening the furnace, form the Jade Mudra with your left hand, hold the *zi* talisman in your right, recite the incantation forty-nine times, draw forty-nine breaths of qi from the Heavenly Gate, and blow them into the furnace before opening it.

When crafting the sword sheath, do so at dawn on a *ding-mao* day, instructing the artisan to make it. First burn incense and pass it over the wood, recite the incantation seven times, draw seven breaths of qi, and blow them onto the wood before the artisan begins.

**Incantation:**
Azure Dragon divine sword,
Eight gods guard and protect.
Azure Dragon brims with spirit,
Slaying and beheading evil ghosts.
Behead the wicked wherever they flee,
A thousand *li*, ten thousand *li* away.
In the blink of my eye—
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees.*

When traveling to famous mountains and grottoes or entering the midst of ten thousand soldiers, hold the sword and recite the incantation seven times with your eyes closed; you will hear only the sound of wind and rain. When the sound ceases, open your eyes, and you will have arrived.

**Incantation:**
I wish to set forth,
Azure Dragon attends my journey.
Eight gods aid and protect,
In an instant I arrive.
A thousand *li*, ten thousand *li*,
As swiftly as a snapped finger.
Where my intent goes, I am there at once,
Let the dragon gods not tarry.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees.*

When the sword is not in use, store it in a blue-green bag and hang it in the spirit chamber. If there is a joyous court occasion, or immortals pass by, or someone comes to visit, the sword will resonate. One chime: a close relative approaches. Two chimes: an acquaintance comes. Three chimes: minor misfortune or legal trouble. Four chimes: evil spirits or specters. Five, six, or seven chimes: great disaster or violent death—flee at once. Hold the sword in your left hand, prepared to escape calamity and avoid misfortune.

The borrowed form will then manifest. If the matter is urgent and there is no time to pace the Dipper, take an object to borrow the form.
