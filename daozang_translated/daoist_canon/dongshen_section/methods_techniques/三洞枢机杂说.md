### **Daily Daoist Exercises: The Immortal’s First Stage**

At dawn each morning—or at the first watch of the fifth night watch—calm the mind and settle the thoughts. Clench the fists to retain spirit, sit with solemn dignity, and sever all worldly concerns. In stillness, free of thought, visualize the body within the formless and the mind within the realm of non-action. Thus, harmonious *qi* will naturally arise. Then, knock the teeth seven times and swallow saliva seven times, each time directing the saliva down to the lower *dantian*. With time, it will become a treasure.

Next, relax the body and limbs to perform the twelve forms of *daoyin*:

1. **Opening the Hundred Passes**
   Grasp both feet with both hands, three times. With each repetition, swallow and retain the breath without exhaling.

2. **Left and Right Pressing**
   Thread one hand past the shin to grasp the top of the foot, while the other hand presses the calf. Alternate sides, performing three repetitions each. With each, swallow and retain.

3. **Single Leg Extension**
   Extend one foot while one hand supports the bed and the other grasps the foot. Alternate sides, three times each. With each, swallow and retain.

4. **Double Foot Grasping**
   Grasp one foot with both hands, alternating sides three times. With each, swallow and retain.

5. **Left and Right Pressing the Void**
   Interlock the backs of the hands, extend the elbows, and slowly release. Grasp the breast with one hand while the other presses into the empty space, as if pushing a heavy object. Alternate sides, three times each. With each, swallow and retain.

6. **Supporting the Sky and Pressing the Earth**
   Interlock the hands, raise them overhead, and slowly lean the head forward until it is one or two *cun* from the ground. Perform three times. With each, swallow and retain.

7. **Dragon Coiling and Phoenix Beak**
   Thread the left hand through the right, interlocking the wrists, and press the fingertips together. Alternate sides, three times each. With each, swallow and retain.

8. **Phoenix Spreading Its Wings**
   First swing the hands back, then extend them forward like a phoenix spreading its wings. Alternate three times. With each, swallow and retain.

9. **Left and Right Swinging**
   Interlock the hands, cradle the head, and swing left and right. Perform three times. With each, swallow and retain.

10. **Pushing East and West**
    Interlock the hands, extend them forward, and swing east and west. Perform three times. With each, swallow and retain.

11. **Striking the Gate of Heaven**
    Interlock the hands and rub the nose. Every seven rubs count as one repetition, followed by one swallow. Perform three sets of seven (twenty-one swallows in total).

12. **The Immortal’s Dry Bath**
    Rub the hands together until warm, then massage the eyes, face, ears, neck, and shoulders as if washing them. The more repetitions, the better.

The above daily *daoyin* exercises, though ideally performed at dawn, are not restricted to morning or evening. Practice them regularly when unoccupied, and naturally, the hands will grow skillful, the sinews supple, the bones strong, and the *qi* harmonious. Illnesses will be dispelled, vitality will flourish, excess food will be digested, hunger will subside, and all endeavors will proceed without obstruction. Though one may not yet attain longevity, prolonged practice will eliminate superficial ailments of the body.

As the saying goes:
*Even if no great power is gained,*
*It still surpasses needless toil of the mind.*
This is the truth of it.

**The Method of Pecking, Swallowing, and Massage**

*The Zhen’gao* states: When traveling at night, one should frequently clack the teeth. There is no fixed number for clacking the teeth, for it slays demonic and malevolent spirits, who ever dread the sound of teeth. If one combines this with rinsing the mouth and reciting incantations, it is also excellent.

The immortal Liu Jing said to Huangfu Long: Upon rising in the morning before washing, sit calmly and rinse the saliva in the mouth—called "jade spring"—until it fills the mouth, then swallow it. Immediately clack the teeth fourteen times, then rinse and swallow the saliva again as before, and clack the teeth once more, following the same method. Clacking the teeth summons the spirits within the body and settles them, and it also prevents the teeth from decaying. Swallowing the saliva makes the body radiant and strong, bestows a lustrous complexion, expels the Three Corpses worms, and is called "refining the essence," enabling one to attain longevity. If practiced throughout life, one may achieve immortality.

*The Zhen’gao Taisu Danjing Jing* states: On the face, one should frequently rub the hands until warm, then massage the face in all directions, following its contours, pressing deeply as if in a heavy rain. This gives the face a luminous glow and prevents wrinkles and blemishes. After five years of practice, the complexion will resemble that of a young maiden. First, vigorously rub the palms until hot, then wipe the face and eyes. Stroke the hair with the hands as if combing it, and alternately massage the arms with the hands to prevent graying hair and floating pulse.

*The Wai Dadong Zhenjing Jingjing Anmo Pian* states: Upon rising from bed, sit upright and regulate the breath. First, clasp the hands and place them behind the neck, then look upward, causing the neck to strain against the hands. Do this three or four times to harmonize the essence and circulate the blood, preventing wind and qi from entering. With prolonged practice, one will neither die nor fall ill. Additionally, bend and stretch the body, extend the limbs to their utmost, and arch the back while loosening the hundred joints, each performed three times.

It also cites *The Scripture on Dispelling Demons and Ascending Spirits*: If the body feels unwell, press the tongue against the throat, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it repeatedly. Soon, the discomfort will dissipate, and the body will feel relaxed and supple. It further states: Pressing the sides of the nose without limit regulates the breath, irrigates the Central Peak, and is recorded in the Emperor’s register. When sitting, one should often close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, they will become distinctly clear.

One should frequently cover the mouth and nose with the hands, breathe gently through the eyes for a long while until fluid forms in the palms, then use it to massage the face and eyes. Regular practice will make the body fragrant.

*The Zhen’gao* states: Combing the hair should be done frequently to circulate the blood and qi and dispel wind and dampness. Alternate combs should be used, and the hair need not be unbound. *The Taiji Jing* states: When combing the hair, face the direction of the king. At the start of combing, silently recite: *"Mud-pellet’s dark flower, preserve essence and long endure; left as the hidden moon, right as the sun’s root; six harmonies refine the essence, a hundred spirits receive grace."* After reciting, swallow the saliva three times. With regular practice, the hair will not fall out but will grow anew. Combs should be changed often, and the combing should be thorough but not painful. One may also have an attendant comb the hair to ensure thoroughness, preventing stagnation of blood and qi and strengthening the hair roots.

*The Lower Scroll of the Red Writ and Jade Formulae* states: On the day of *gengshen*, the Supreme Lord of the Northern Palace of the Great Mystery records the transgressions of the Three Corpses and the spirits of the people, submitting them to the Emperor. On this day, if one observes purification rites, upholds the precepts, and contemplates the spirits day and night, the Three Corpses will be unable to ascend to heaven and report one’s sins. The Earthly Offices will instead record one’s good deeds. The Emperor and the Great Unity will rejo

When spectral apparitions and tomb phantoms dare to offend my spirit,
May the Northern Emperor strike them down and cast their qi into the abyss;
Recorded in the registers of the Supreme August, reverently presented to the Jade Dawn.
Recite this invocation twice, then knock the teeth thrice—
Thus shall one no longer dream of tombs or the ghosts of deceased kin.
For those who frequently suffer inauspicious dreams, this method may be applied.
Thereby, ghostly qi vanishes and malevolent specters disperse.

It is further said: If the arms remain unguarded, sinking wind-toxins and stagnant qi congeal in the meridians, causing numbness in the bones and rendering one inert. Acupuncture and moxibustion may cure this, as may the invocation of the Northern Emperor’s *Qu Zhe* (Twisting and Turning). Should one practice this a hundred times, the ailment will also dissipate.

First, gently massage the afflicted arm with one hand. After a long while, close the eyes and turn the gaze inward, swallow saliva thrice, and knock the teeth three times. Compose the mind and softly invoke:
*"Supreme Four Mysteries, Five Florets, Six Courts.
Three Hun and Seven Po, Heaven’s Opening and Earth’s Essence.
Divine Palace, Guardians of the Body, Celestial Embryo, Radiant Above.
Four Limbs and Hundred Spirits, Nine Joints and Myriad Numinous Ones.
Enrolled in the Jade Dawn, inscribed in the Jade City.
Jade Lads attend my body, Jade Lads guard my life.
Ever aligned with the One Light, ascending as an immortal to the Upper Clarity.
Long as the sun and moon, years enduring beyond measure.
Transcending to ascend as an immortal, attaining the Great Peace.
Swirling winds and congealed ailments, demonic qi and flying ghosts,
Tomb specters and yin vapors, lingering malign forces—
Assailing my four limbs, disrupting my household’s prosperity.
Great Unity’s Celestial Soldiers, Dragon and Tiger manifesting might,
Sever the inauspicious ghosts, shatter the wind-demons.
Examine and expel hidden grievances, conceal all poisons and wrongs.
Restore me to normality, that I may shine with the sun and moon.
If examined and found transgressing the Northern Asterism, let them be as those who offend the radiant majesty above."*

In ancient times, Tang Lan dwelled in the mountains and was struck by a ghost, leaving his body limp as a silk sack. A Daoist taught him this method, and he was immediately cured. This is the *Qu Zhe* method of the Northern Emperor—effective for all ailments involving twisting or obstruction, not merely wind-induced numbness. Tang Lan now resides on Mount Hua, refining the elixir and attaining immortality.

A Perfected One asked: *"Why do people frequently fall ill?"*
A Divine Person replied: *"When the liver spirit departs and does not return in due time, the eyes lose their brightness. When the heart spirit is absent, the lips turn pale. When the lung spirit is absent, the nose becomes blocked. When the kidney spirit is absent, the ears grow deaf. When the spleen spirit is absent, the mouth cannot taste sweetness. When the head spirit is absent, one becomes dizzy and disoriented. When the abdominal spirit is absent, the center becomes disordered, and nothing can be transformed. When the spirits of the four limbs depart, one cannot move. The nature of spirit and essence is to dwell in emptiness and stillness, not in turbidity and chaos. To summon the spirits, one must fast and observe precepts, suspending their images in the chamber—thus, all illnesses vanish. Without fasting and precepts, the spirits will not return to the person but will instead ascend to heaven to lodge complaints. Hence, people’s illnesses accumulate, and the dead are unending."*

It is further said: Rub the face and eyes with both hands until slightly warm, making this a regular practice. Wrinkles in the aging face first appear beneath the eyes, while the decline of the body and depletion of qi begin between the kidneys. These two places are the gates and windows of wrinkles and decay, the passes and fords of vitality. Therefore, practicing this method in daily life wards off wrinkles and decline, preserving health and harmony.

*The Scripture of the Celestial Treasure’s Natural Cyclical Movements* states: The Celestial Treasure’s natural cycles include the Greater Yang Nine and Greater Hundred Six, as well as the Lesser Yang Nine and Lesser Hundred Six. Three thousand six hundred and sixty years constitute the Lesser Yang Nine and Lesser Hundred Six. Nine thousand nine hundred years constitute the Greater Yang Nine and Greater Hundred Six. The heavens’ exhaustion is called Yang Nine, and the earth’s depletion is called Hundred Six. In the *jiashen* year following the Jin clan’s era, the cycles of heaven and earth’s fortune and misfortune reach their conclusion. When the Yang Nine assembly arrives, the Dao and virtue become manifest, calamities and ugliness instantly dissolve, and the sagely ruler assumes his mandate in the *renchen* year.

*The Yellow Writs of the Forty-Four Methods* states: When retiring at night and about to close the eyes, press the hand over the heart thrice, shut the eyes, and softly invoke:
*"Supreme Numinous Nine Palaces, Great Unity guards the chamber.
Hundred spirits assume their positions, hun and po harmonize.
Long life without death, sealing away inauspiciousness and misfortune."*
After the invocation, sleep—this is called the *Nine Palaces Hidden Invocation for Sleeping Spirits*. Practicing this regularly brings peace to the hun and po, ensuring constant good fortune.

If the ears ring, it is due to external influences intruding. The ear spirit, Jiao Nü, says: One should immediately sound the bell to alert the Nine Palaces, informing them of the outsider’s intrusion so they may prepare. The "bell sound" refers to the ringing in the ears. Upon hearing it, cross the hands to cover the ears and invoke:
*"The Red Child dwells in the palace, the Nine Perfected in the chamber.
Attend to the divine command, discerning the inauspicious.
Great Unity’s flowing fire extinguishes the myriad misfortunes."*

The ranks of the Perfected and Immortals:
Perfected and Immortals are each divided into three grades, forming nine ranks. Each of these nine ranks is further divided into three, totaling twenty-seven ranks. In the Jade Clarity, the Perfected hold the primary position; in the Upper Clarity, the True Ones hold it; and in the Great Clarity, the Immortals hold it. Yet the Perfected may also be called True, the True may be called Perfected, the Immortals may be called True, the True may be called Immortals, the Immortals may be called Perfected, and the Perfected may be called Immortals. A Perfected appears every thousand years, a True One every five hundred, an Immortal every hundred and fifty, and a Worthy every hundred.

*The Inner Transmission of the Supreme Perfected and Primordial Master* states: The divine kings of the heavens scatter flowers and burn incense to honor those who attain the Dao. It is further said: The Supreme Lord dispatches envoys in embroidered robes to convey felicitations.

*Zhuangzi, "Autumn Floods" (Chapter Seventeen)* states: Zhuangzi and Huizi strolled above the Hao Bridge.

Zhuangzi said: "See how the minnows swim so leisurely—this is the joy of fish!"
Huizi replied: "You are not a fish—how can you know the joy of fish?"
Zhuangzi said: "You are not me—how can you know that I do not know the joy of fish?"
Huizi said: "I am not you, so I do not know you. But you are certainly not a fish—is it not complete that you do not know the joy of fish?"
Zhuangzi said: "Let us return to the beginning. When you asked, *'How do you know the fish are joyful?'*—you already knew that I knew, yet you asked me. I knew it here above the Hao."

Fang Qian, styled Daochong, was a native of Baixiang County in Zhaobang, Jizhou. He cared for others while neglecting himself. The mountain folk often suffered from miasmic malaria, but those who took refuge in his name were cured. When people begged for his method, Qian replied: "A rectified heart can dispel evil. I dwell in poverty and have no wealth to give, but I constantly recite the *Dharma-Wheel Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, rejoice in all good deeds, and show compassion toward all wrongs. This can heal oneself—and others as well."

In *The Traditions of Divine Transcendents*, when Magu scattered rice upon the ground, the grains that fell became cinnabar. Wang Fangping laughed and said: "You are still young, girl—this is why you delight in such clever transformations. I am old now and no longer care for such tricks."

Sun Bo of Hedong was a man of refined talent, skilled in composition. He studied the Dao and practiced the arts of Mozi. He could make plants, trees, metal, and stone all burst into flame, their light illuminating for miles. He could also turn his own body into a blazing fire, breathe flames from his mouth, and point at great trees or growing grass to wither them instantly—then point again to restore them as before. He could even cause an entire army to divide into separate columns of fire. When he set fire to others, water poured upon the flames would not extinguish them for days—only when Bo pointed at them would they cease. When crossing great waters, not only did his own body remain dry, but he could keep hundreds of followers from getting wet. He could also spread mats upon the water, sit and feast, make merry, and have people dance upon the surface without sinking, all rejoicing without restraint. Those who were ill would seek his aid, and he would heal them without a word—merely pointing at them and declaring their recovery, and they would be cured. He could also swallow swords, pass through walls, and bend mirrors into blades or blades into mirrors, maintaining the transformation indefinitely until he pointed at them to restore their original form. Later, he entered the forest, fearing that the mountain spirits might have taken his elixir, and ascended as a transcendent.

The wood blocks evil paths and seals demonic routes, obstructing the way of spirits. Consuming its pills and elixirs, one’s spirit flourishes in all directions, while the *qi* of nourishment and defense becomes light and agile. Ingesting its decoctions and powders dispels all ailments, enabling longevity and enduring vision. The formula for compounding this wood is not recorded here.

During famine years when grain is scarce, or when the destitute cannot obtain it, they may rely solely on *nan zhu* (southern candlewood), or mix it with *fu ling* (poria), or blend it with honey, or combine it with pine and cypress leaves. Pound the *nan zhu* plant, extract its juice, and soak the green-dragon rice in it to prepare the medicinal concoction. This tree is woody yet resembles grass, hence it is called *nan zhu cao mu* (southern candlewood plant). It is also named *hou yao* (monkey medicine), *nan du*, *hou zhuo*, *wei na mu*, or the "King of Plants." It grows in all famous mountains, with the greatest abundance in Wu and Yue.

The middle scroll of *The Canon of the Supreme Perfected* states: "Within the thousand *li* of the Son of Heaven’s domain, fields supply the ancestral temples and sustain the distant and near. Like the sun and moon in their vastness, this expanse spans a thousand *li*, hence it is called the *jing shi* (capital). *Jing* means great, and *shi* means multitude—the Son of Heaven’s abode, where the great multitude gathers."

*The Scripture of Opening and Closing in the Pillow of Lord Lao* says: "This vital *qi* should always remain calmly within the body; do not let it recklessly depart. The mouth is the gateway of the five disasters, and the heart is the door of the eight poisons. [...] When writing talismans, first recite the incantation three times. [...] Bite the brush’s tip. Write the talisman on a sesame cake, secretly chanting the spell seven times."

**Authentic Talisman Script**
Each morning at dawn, knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite this incantation thrice. Then, facing east, take three talisman pills with tea made from *mao xiang* (cogon grass). The incantation reads:
*"Treasure of the August Spirit, imperishable through kalpas untold.
Mind and spirit ever harmonized, lifespan naturally prolonged.
Firm and unyielding, never waning, dispelling all misfortunes and woes.
This script is concealed by the Perfected; guard it well to the end as at the start.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the command of the Most High Lord Lao!"*

**Method for Communicating with True Incense**
Incense serves to summon spirits, convey messages, guide comings and goings, and signal distances. Thus, those who tend incense, attend to incense, or serve as jade lads, jade maidens, or incense officials must fulfill their duties with reverence, never treating it lightly. As recorded in *The Comprehensive Refinement Canon of the Three Caverns*.

*The Scripture of the Flowing Pearl* states: "Burning foreign, foul, toxic, or pungent incense—such as frankincense or conch-shell incense—violates Daoist prohibitions and is not the incense used by true practitioners. True practitioners favor the subtle fragrance of *zi wei* (purple-tinted) and secluded woods, which delights all who encounter it. This refers to *chen xiang* (aloeswood) and *jian xiang* (eaglewood). Foreign incense, with its pungent toxicity, is detested by true practitioners—this refers to frankincense."

Wang Zijin, the Upright Man of Tongbai, said to Qingxu Zhenren Wang Zideng: "In the past, Su Shangqing loved burning pungent incense, its *qi* surging before the image of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. The Earthly Bureau reported this to the Most High, who disapproved and subsequently demoted his immortal rank."

*The Fragrant Register of Divine Immortals* states: "Many in the world offer frankincense to Heaven. Frankincense, also called foreign incense, is detested by the Supreme Emperor and the Five Planets, for its *qi* is pungent and foul. Conch-shell incense and musk are especially forbidden. *Chen xiang* (aloeswood), *jian xiang* (eaglewood), *jiang zhen xiang* (resinous eaglewood), *bai tan xiang* (sandalwood), *su he xiang* (storax), and *qing mu xiang* (aristolochia) carry their fragrance forty *li* upward. *Ding xiang* (clove) and *an xi xiang* (benzoin) repel evil and dispel impurity. Only raw *long nao* (borneol) may be used; cooked borneol risks contamination by the *qi* of its wood."

**Method for Making Descending-Truth Fragrant Beads**
Take three *jin* of *chen shui xiang* (aloeswood), two *jin* of *xun mu xiang* (costusroot), nine *liang* of *qing mu xiang* (aristolochia), five *liang* of *ji she xiang* (clove), three *liang* of *wu shen* (black ginseng), six *liang* of *que tou xiang* (sparrow-head incense), two *liang* of *xiang bai zhi* (angelica), two *liang* of *zhan fu xiang* (benzoin), two *liang* of *bai tan* (sandalwood), three *liang* of *ai xiang* (mugwort), four *liang* of *an xi xiang* (benzoin), and three *liang* of *mu lan* (magnolia). Grind each separately, then mix with ten *liang* of dried jujube pulp. Pound thirty thousand times, steam in a white porcelain vessel for a day, blend with three *jin* of white honey, and pound until well combined. Form into pills the size of *ji tou* seeds (gorgon fruit), string them with green thread, and dry in the sun. These are called the *Three Perfections and Nine Harmonies Fragrant Bead Pills*. When burned on the altar, their fragrance ascends to the Nine Heavens, where the Heavenly Perfected and Jade Maidens, perceiving it, descend to witness the ceremony in the void. Recorded in *The Rites of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Nourishing Fast*.

**Method for Divine Candle Oil**
From *The Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit*, the method for fragrant oil: Take nine *jin* of *chen shui xiang* (aloeswood), three *jin* of *qing gui pi* (green cinnamon bark), ten *liang* of *qing mu xiang* (aristolochia), ten *liang* of *zhen tan* (true sandalwood), eight *liang* of *ji she xiang* (clove), eight *liang* of *su he xiang* (storax), ten *liang* of *que tou xiang* (sparrow-head incense), eighteen *liang* of *ling ling xiang* (highland basil), twenty *liang* of dried jujube fat, ten *liang* of *huo xiang* (patchouli), six *liang* of *xuan su* (perilla), and eight *liang* of *bai zhi* (angelica). After purifying through fasting, select an auspicious day—*ping*, *jian*, *kai*, or *cheng*—face east or south, and chop the ingredients. Place them in a silk bag and steep in oil for seven days without opening. If pounded and mixed with honey, then ignited with a solar-concentrating mirror, it will attract and summon true spirits. Recorded in *The Refinement Canon for Daoist Practitioners of the Three Caverns*.

**Method for Divine Candle Oil**
Take five *liang* of *zhan fu* (benzoin), three *liang* of *xun lu* (frankincense), six *liang* of *ling ling xiang* (highland basil), six *liang* of *gan song* (spikenard), three *liang* of *bai mao xiang* (cogon grass), three *liang* of *wu shen* (black ginseng), and three *liang* of *bai zhi* (angelica). Chop finely, place in a silk bag, and steep in oil for three, five, or seven days. Then use it to light lamps, and the fragrance will be rich and lingering, capable of summoning and descending heavenly perfected beings. The key to refining incense and lamps lies in using colored lantern covers to shield from insects and wind, thereby prolonging the light. Beyond the lamps and candles of the fasting altar, wax torches should be abundant and never lacking. Recorded in *The Rites of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Nourishing Fast*.

**Incense Formula**
Take twenty *liang* of fresh *mao xiang* (cogon grass), clean and remove the outer skin, retaining twelve *liang* of the pure material. Chop finely, stir-fry with two *liang* of honey until yellow.

Pound two *liang* of *xiang fu zi* (nutgrass) until finely chopped. Take one and a half *liang* of *ding xiang pi* (clove bark) and seven *liang* of *huang tan* (sandalwood), finely chopped. Add one *liang* of *jiang zhen xiang* (lignum dalbergiae odoriferae). Grind all ingredients evenly into small pieces, then blend with twenty-four *liang* of refined honey. Knead thoroughly, place in a ceramic vessel, and bury it in a shady spot two to three *chi* deep. After ten days, it may be retrieved for use. For each batch, after mixing with honey, add three *liang* of coarse *jian xiang* (agarwood) powder.

**Qingyuan Incense Formula**
Take ten *liang* of *gan song* (spikenard), thirty *liang* of *xiang bai zhi* (angelica), five *liang* of *xuan shen* (figwort root), six *liang* of *ling ling xiang* (lysimachia), seven *liang* of *mao xiang* (cogon grass), five *liang* of *ding xiang pi* (clove bark), three *liang* of *huo xiang* (patchouli), three *liang* of *xiang fu zi* (nutgrass), half a *jin* of *mu she* (musk), and five *liang* of *jiang zhen xiang* (lignum dalbergiae odoriferae). Clean and wash all ingredients, then chop and grind into coarse powder. Blend with refined honey, store in a sealed vessel, and allow to mature over time.
