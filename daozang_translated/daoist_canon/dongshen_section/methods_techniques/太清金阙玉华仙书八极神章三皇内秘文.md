**Preface to *The Supreme Clarity Golden Palace Jade Flower Immortal Writ of the Eight Poles Divine Chapters and Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Text***

At the inception of the Nine Mysteries, when the Two Images had yet to take form, the Void congealed in radiant splendor, and the numinous wind gathered in purity. The divine chapters coalesced within primordial chaos, and the jade script emerged from solitary transformation, standing at the threshold of being and non-being, gleaming before the Dark and Yellow. Sun and moon drew from it to illuminate, Heaven and Earth relied upon it to cover and bear. Thereupon, the Supreme Void Emperor commanded the Primordial Beginning Great Sage to compile it within the Golden Palace, inscribe it upon the Jade Chapters, and conceal it within the Upper Mystery. Before it descended to the lower realms, it was bestowed upon those of the Dao, who received this text. Thus, the Yellow Emperor received the talismans, Fuxi received the diagrams, Gaoxin obtained the celestial scriptures, and Great Yu acquired the *Luo River Writ*—the divine way of descent and revelation began here.

Moreover, the Mysterious Origin pitied the world’s degeneracy and, through successive ages, served as the Emperor’s Teacher. When human ethics grew shallow and false, he bestowed the *Dao* and *Virtue* to restore simplicity; when ghosts and spirits caused chaos, he revealed this text to dispel demons and evil. Thus, the Western Terrace concealed its numinous script, and the Eastern Flower sealed its true secrets. Its dragon-script cloud-seal is not transmitted to the unworthy; those who receive it must not retreat, and those who employ it must guard it with devotion. Though one may not yet attain the Dao of immortality, one may wander the world in this life, having already realized the fruit of earthly immortality. It should be stored in a jade or stone casket, wrapped in a five-colored pouch, and hidden within the cinnabar chamber—never treated with negligence or disrespect.

**Scroll One of *The Supreme Clarity Golden Palace Jade Flower Immortal Writ of the Eight Poles Divine Chapters and Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Text***

**Chapter One: The Subtle Rectification**

The Heavenly Sovereign Lord said: Before the Great Void, there was silence and formlessness. How did the utmost essence stir and resonate, so that the True One abided therein? The True One moved, and the primordial *qi* transformed of itself. The primordial *qi* held the void within the center and the center within the void—vast beyond measure, subtle beyond perception. Gradually, it thickened in misty fusion, unchanging in primordial unity, the origin of the ten thousand forms, their first signs appearing here.

That which was clear, bright, and luminous floated to become Heaven; that which was turbid, stagnant, and murky accumulated to become Earth. That which was harmonious, gentle, and compliant congealed to become humans; that which was supremely numinous, firm, and refined transformed into spirits; that which was perverse, dark, and contrary dispersed into other kinds. All were born of the single *qi*, divided into myriad distinctions yet each in its place. Though the myriad movements were tangled and chaotic, all could attain sageliness.

Extinguished, they revived; cycling, they renewed—such is the essence of the Dao and virtue, the heart of humans and spirits. Their resonance is inexhaustible, never departing from the realm of activity. Thus, the Dao is the image of emptiness and nothingness, the root of creation and transformation, the origin of spirit and illumination, the source of Heaven and Earth. Boundless without exterior, infinitesimal without interior, vast and unbounded without end, obscure and fathomless without limit—profound beyond measure, yet its great luminosity sheds light; utterly still and without intent, yet the myriad things take form. In primordial unity, there is no thing; in utter silence, there is no sound. The ten thousand forms arise from it, and the Five Phases are completed through it. That which is born has its limit, that which is completed has its decline. Generation upon generation, completion upon completion—through past and present, it remains serene and unchanging. This is the Dao.

Virtue is what Heaven and Earth receive, what yin and yang rely upon, woven with the Five Phases as warp and the Four Seasons as weft. The ruler governs it, the teacher instructs it. In the unseen and the manifest, in movement and stillness, all flourish as they should. Its grace flows ceaselessly, yet the multitude of beings do not know this as virtue. Thus, the Dao and virtue are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are the parents of the ten thousand things. The revered one who encompasses the heavens is the guiding principle of emptiness and nothingness; the spirits of the Eight Poles are the handles of Heaven and Earth. The clarity of the sun and moon are the measures of Heaven and Earth; the myriad stars and celestial forms are the changing ways of Heaven and Earth. The Five Phases and Six *Qi* are the pivot and mechanism of Heaven and Earth; emperors, kings, and lords are the masters who govern the Three Powers. The multitude of beings are the shifting *qi* of yin and yang; spirits, demons, ghosts, and monsters are the echoes of Heaven and Earth. Divine mushrooms and immortal herbs are transformations of pure essence and luminosity.

Thus, the source of the ten thousand things lies in the Dao and virtue as their root, with the True One as their origin, prior even to the Emperor of Forms.

**Chapter Two: The Divine Ancestry**

The Heavenly Sovereign Lord said: Heaven and Earth cannot generate themselves. That which generates Heaven and Earth is the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate cannot move itself. That which moves the Supreme Ultimate is the true essence. The true essence moves and transforms naturally. That which is spirit and illumination is called the Void Emperor, who dwells in the Ninefold Clarity and oversees the mysterious transformations. The one who governs the myriad spirits is called the Primordial Beginning Lord. The Primordial Beginning Lord is also known as: (1) the True Person of Pangu, (2) the Lord of the Nine Sovereigns, (3) the Divine King of the Eight Poles, and (4) the Great Perfected Holder of the Celestial Net.

The form of Heaven was like a vast canopy. The sun and moon had not yet shone, the stars had not yet gleamed. The Mysterious Origin was empty and boundless, vast and obscure, silent and still—chaotic and nameless. Above, there was nothing to which it was tethered; below, nothing to which it was rooted. Above, there were no Eight Poles; below, no Five Peaks. Above, there was no change or communication; below, no pivot or mechanism. Then the Primordial Beginning Lord emerged within this primordial unity. Constantly inhaling and exhaling the primordial *qi*, he later generated change and communication. Stirred by the true essence, he reached the Supreme Ultimate’s single *qi*, which divided to form the Two Modes. Above, the Three Clarities were arrayed; below, the Four Great Kalpas unfolded. After another forty thousand kalpas, the Earth gave birth to Gangxu, Gangxu gave birth to Binqian, Binqian gave birth to the dragon, the dragon gave birth to water, and the blood of the shore stones and mountains transformed into the Great Primordial Lesser Mother.

The Great Primordial Lesser Mother gave birth to one capable of human speech, whose form and countenance were surpassingly wondrous. She roamed between the earth and the hidden realms, inhaling and exhaling primordial *qi*. The Primordial Beginning Lord perceived this and communed with her in *qi*, whereupon the sun and moon gained their radiance, the stars their brilliance. The Five Movements self-differentiated, and the Six *Qi* self-rectified.

After another forty thousand kalpas, the Primordial Beginning transformed into the True Person Pan Gu, who opened her left heart and small intestine, enabling her to bear offspring. After yet another forty thousand kalpas, the Heavenly August Sovereign was born, possessing thirteen heads. The Heavenly August Sovereign begot the Earthly August Sovereign, and the Earthly August Sovereign begot the Human August Sovereign—these are the esoteric methods of the Three Sovereigns, the very essence of this tradition.

Thereafter, the Five Directions were arrayed, forming the spirits of the Five Peaks, who became the lords of the Five Phases. In heaven, they are the Five Stars and Five *Qi*; on earth, the Five Phases and Five Peaks. In the east is the spirit of the Eastern Peak, lord of yang wood. In the south is the spirit of the Southern Peak, lord of radiant fire. In the west is the spirit of the Western Peak, lord of great brilliance. In the north is the spirit of the Northern Peak, lord of numinous governance. At the center is the spirit of the Central Peak, the Yellow Emperor of the Gongsun clan. He serves as the pivot of the myriad images and holds the register of harmonious exchange.

Within the Great Canopy of Heaven, the Eight Heavens of the Thirty-Two Emperors, and the Eight Poles with their seven hundred twenty lords, there are thirty-six Cavern-Heavens of emptiness and void, along with the gods of the Eight Directions who subdue demons.

The Upper Three Heavens of Radiance:
The Azure Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Solar Essence Treasure Register, wherein the lord of solar light presides as sovereign, the Son of the Great Yang as patriarch, followed by divine kings and immortals. All within govern the illumination of the world.
The Cavern-Heaven of the Lunar Splendor Luminous Response, wherein the yang spirit of the Great Yin Star presides as sovereign, the Maiden of Lunar Splendor as matriarch, followed by divine kings and immortals. All within govern the interchanges of stars and constellations, the alternations of yin and yang, the fortunes and misfortunes of the myriad things.
The Cavern-Heaven of the Southern Dipper’s Life-Registering, wherein the Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Dipper presides as sovereign, the Star Lord of Longevity as matriarch, followed by divine kings and immortals. All within govern the records of sentient beings in water and on land, their nobility and baseness, and hold the registers of life and death for all living things.
The Cavern-Heaven of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Talismanic Registers, wherein the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the Northern Pole presides as sovereign, followed by divine kings and immortals. All within govern the bestowal of blessings and retribution in rituals, the severance of demonic influences, and the eradication of malevolent spirits.

The Wind Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Treasure Flower Divine Light, the Cavern-Heaven of the Supreme Simplicity Pure Yang, the Cavern-Heaven of the Golden Flower Western Jade, and the Cavern-Heaven of the Accumulated Essence Absolute Purity. The gods and immortals of these four cavern-heavens all govern the office of civil brilliance and hold authority over the affairs of the netherworld.

The Cloud Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Great Void Divine Response, the Cavern-Heaven of the Seven Luminances Flaming Demon, the Cavern-Heaven of the Void Boundary Blade Profit, and the Cavern-Heaven of the Eight Poles Tranquil Crossing. The gods and immortals of these four cavern-heavens all govern the severance of the Ten Good Deeds and oversee the office of immortal ascension.

Beyond these Three Heavens of Radiance, from below to above, the center serves as the measure—this is the realm above the Celestial Pass.

The Middle Three Heavens of Radiance:
The Mist Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Purple Ultimate Tranquil Brahma, the Cavern-Heaven of the Divine Radiance Jade Clarity, the Cavern-Heaven of the Yang Brightness Vermilion Phoenix, and the Cavern-Heaven of the Eastern Florescence Azure Youth. The gods and immortals of these four cavern-heavens all govern the affairs of the water palaces, earthly deities, sea mountains, and blessed lands, as well as the offices of the island immortals of the Three Isles and Ten Continents, earthbound immortals, sword immortals, and those who cultivate virtue and practice the Dao.

The Rosy Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Feathered Wind Void Whiteness, the Cavern-Heaven of the Supreme Simplicity Harmonious Yang, the Cavern-Heaven of the Jade Clouds Upper Perfected, and the Cavern-Heaven of the Primordial Beginning Assembly of Immortals. The gods and immortals of these four cavern-heavens all attain the merit of the six transformations of yang brightness and the great changes of yin essence, governing the ascension of immortals and holding the offices of the Southern Palace.

The *Qi* Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Supreme Beginning Jade Clarity, the Cavern-Heaven of the Supreme Harmony Four Sages, the Cavern-Heaven of the Divine Radiance Demon-Subduing, and the Cavern-Heaven of the Heavenly Flower Upper Minister. The gods and immortals of these four cavern-heavens all govern the passage of *qi* through kalpas, the ethereal and corporeal souls of the sun and moon, the conjunctions and deviations of stars, the rise and fall of rulers, the majestic *qi* of heaven and earth, and the gathering of wind and rain.

Above this center, the Three Heavens of Radiance condense the essence of yang’s origin, connecting with the cosmos, congealing true *qi*, forming palaces and courts, and belonging to the realm of the Three Bounds.

The Lower Three Heavens of Radiance:
The Scenic Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Great Clarity Golden Portal, the Cavern-Heaven of the Divine Perfected Mysterious Transformation, the Cavern-Heaven of the Lord of Wood and Queen Mother of Metal, and the Cavern-Heaven of the Three Primordials Ultimate Change. These four cavern-heavens are presided over by the Great Emperor of Jade, with divine kings and immortals within. All govern the affairs of heaven above, earth below, and the netherworld, the Three Systems and Seven Governances, and hold authority over the myriad matters.

The Azure Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Azure Void Supreme Unity, the Cavern-Heaven of the Purple Essence Night Light, the Cavern-Heaven of the Essence Flower Great Void, and the Cavern-Heaven of the Jade Yang Ultimate Non-Being. The gods and immortals of these four cavern-heavens are presided over by the Great Emperor of Jade and govern all affairs of the heavenly immortals, heavenly officials, and the gains and losses of heavenly beings.

The Cinnabar Radiance’s Four Cavern-Heavens:
The Cavern-Heaven of the Brocade Forest, the Cavern-Heaven of the Cloud Forest, the Cavern-Heaven of the Divine Essence, and the Cavern-Heaven of the Great Canopy. These four cavern-heavens are jointly presided over by the Earthly August Sovereign and the Heavenly August Emperor, with divine kings and heavenly officials within. All govern the sacred teachings of the Three Clarities, the numinous texts of the Eight Poles, and the examination of immortal scriptures and divine talismans.

Above the Nine Heavens of Radiance and beyond the Eight Poles lies the Heaven of the Great Canopy. Within it is the Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity, the Supreme Sacred Ancestor, the Supreme Immortal Lord, the Mother of the Great Dao, and the Lord of the Single *Qi*, known as the Primordial Beginning.

Within it lies the True Realm of Supreme Clarity, the abode of the Primordial August Lord of the Great Dao. Therein lies the Immortal Realm of Grand Clarity, the abode of the Most High Lord Lao. Upon the Mountain of Jade Capital grow forests of pearls and purple fruits, with jade blossoms and phoenix marrow flourishing above. Within are eighty-one paths, connecting to the eighty-one cavern-heavens of the mortal world.

The ancestral sages of Heaven, the ancestral lords of Heaven, the divine kings of Heaven, the imperial lords of Heaven, the heavenly officials of Heaven, the heavenly immortals of Heaven, the heavenly beings of Heaven, the great sages of Heaven, the spirits of the Nine Heavens of Radiance, and the lords of the Five Marchmounts—all gather at the Mountain of Jade Capital once every five days. Within the Three Realms, before the Primordial Beginning, though the distance spans the Eight Heavens and Nine Earths, myriad leagues in all directions, all assemble in but a moment.

Beneath the Five Marchmounts, the earthly immortals preside as follows: the True Martial True Lord of the North. Born into the mortal world, he accumulated hidden merits from his ancestors, from youth admired the true wind, and from early years cultivated the Daoist arts. He mastered the origins and currents of creation and deeply probed the wondrous principles of divine transformation. The Lord of Jade Clarity bestowed upon him ten celestial scriptures of the *Slaying Ghosts Jade Texts*, iron mirrors and bronze talismans to dispel yin spirits and demonic illusions. With unbound hair, he wields the jade celestial blade of Jade Clarity, dons the feathered robes of the Eight Trigrams, and treads upon the celestial tortoise and serpent.

The Director of Fates of the Southern Marchmount is Lady Wei of Sui. The Director of Fates of the Eastern Marchmount is Lady Wang of Purple Tenuity. The Director of Fates of the Western Marchmount is the thirteenth beloved daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. The Director of Fates of the Northern Marchmount is Lord Cui, a Tang minister. The Director of Fates of the Central Marchmount is Lord Li Jing, a Tang minister. The Officers of Sin and Fortune of the Three Primes are the Three Mao True Lords.

The wife of the Grand Beginning became the Lady of Emei Mountain; Zhang Liang of Han became the Lord of Wangwu Mountain, overseeing the affairs of those drowned in the five lakes, four seas, three ravines, and nine rivers. Master Wang Xi became the Immortal Lord of the Upper Island of Penglai; Master Juanzi of Great Radiance became the Immortal Lord of the Middle Island of Penglai. The True Lord Xu presides over the Palace of Cinnabar Terrace, managing the merits and conduct of immortals throughout the world. Lord Yang became the Lord of Tiantai Mountain and later the Jade Emperor’s celestial scribe. Shao Jian became the master of the Lesser Grotto of Mount Lu; Master Chen Tuan oversees the Immortal Lord of the Lower Island of Penglai. Zhongli Jia presides over the Immortal Lord of the Jasper Terrace Palace and concurrently serves as the Great Preceptor of the Southern Continent, expounding the Dharma.

Thus, the seventy-two blessed lands, eighty-one cavern-heavens, minor immortals of the ten continents and three islands, hidden scholars of the nine earths, ghostly officials of the netherworld, divine lords of Fengdu, minor spirits of mountains and waters, and riverine and maritime deities—all Daoist adepts who have not yet ascended to Heaven—are not recorded in the Jade Register, nor are their names inscribed upon the Golden Tablet.

**Chapter Three: The Ghostly Lineage**

Ghosts are the utmost numinous beings without form, empty and spiritually quiescent, their wondrousness like an echo in a valley that does not flow.

**The Eight Ghosts of the East:**
1. The Yin-Corpse Ghost, dwelling in the East, appearing as a young child, often transforming into a woman’s form to follow celestial spirits.
2. The Luo-Da Ghost.
3. The Yang-Ming Ghost.
4. The Crimson Phoenix Ghost.
5. The Lone Blossom Ghost.
6. The Great Spring Ghost.
7. The Wen-Ming Ghost.
8. The Divine Demon Ghost.

These eight ghosts are upright spirits employed by celestial deities, without selfish intent to harm mortal lives. They all reside in the position of the Year-Star’s virtue in the East.

**The Eight Ghosts of the South:**
1. The Wu-Luo-Na Ghost.
2. The Celestial Great Matron Ghost.
3. The Earth-Thunder Ghost.
4. The Spirit-Numinous Ghost.
5. The Nine-Corpse Ghost.
6. The Wooden Well Ghost.
7. The Sun Dao Celestial Spirit Ghost.
8. The Oxherd and Weaver Girl Ghost.

These eight ghosts each have the head of a rooster and the body of a human, clad in yellow gauze robes with vermilion flames. They follow celestial spirits as officers of wind and hail, residing in the position of the Fire Star’s virtue in the South.

**The Eight Ghosts of the West:**
1. The Pure-Living Ghost.
2. The Wu-Na-Po-Corpse Ghost.
3. The Bewitching Ghost.
4. The Hoary Camel Ghost.
5. The Barbarian-Changing Ghost.
6. The Celestial Star Ghost.
7. The Imperial Roaring Ghost.
8. The Yin-Demon Ghost.

These eight ghosts are upright and without private malice, following celestial spirits to judge and execute the wicked and unjust. They reside in the position of the Grand White Star.

**The Eight Ghosts of the North:**
1. The Yaksha Ghost.
2. The Fu-Luo Ghost.
3. The Human Emperor Ghost.
4. The Auspicious Transformation Ghost.
5. The Bo-Li Ghost.
6. The Demon-Mouth Ghost.
7. The Executioner Ghost.
8. The Golden Phoenix Maiden Ghost.

These eight ghosts serve as the martial forces of the Northern Emperor, upright and without deceit, ever following the Northern Emperor to sweep away all harmful spirits. Their forms resemble celestial spirits, and they reside in the position of the Danger Star and Chronographic Star in the North.

**The Eight Ghosts of the Center:**
1. The Monk-Roaring Ghost.
2. The Crying-Roaring Ghost.
3. The Tail-Star Ghost.
4. The Sea-Slaying Ghost.
5. The Six-Ding Ghost.
6. The Six-Jia Ghost.
7. The Jade Maiden Ghost.
8. The Five Paths Ghost.

These eight ghosts also follow celestial spirits, accompanying the Five Marchmounts to pursue the dead and deliver karmic retribution. Their forms resemble divine beings, and they reside in the position of the Quelling Star in the Center.

The Heavenly August Lord said: These forty celestial ghosts of the five directions are the upright officers of the Five Marchmounts, the righteous soldiers of the five directions, and the celestial spirits’ employment of the upright *qi* of emptiness and non-being. They assist the virtue of Heaven and Earth, wielding wind and thunder, following the aides of the Five Marchmounts to sweep away deceit and treachery. Each of the five-directional ghosts commands a host of three hundred thousand spirit-soldiers, aiding the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth.

To employ and command the ghosts of the five directions, there is also a method.

On Metal Days, command the eight ghosts of the West; on Wood Days, the eight ghosts of the East; on Fire Days, the eight ghosts of the South; on Water Days, the eight ghosts of the North; and on Earth Days, the eight ghosts of the Center.

To employ them, first inscribe the True Form Talisman of the Heavenly August Lord upon yellow silk, five *cun* in length and width. Write it in cinnabar, burn it to ash, and swallow it with fragrant water while facing the Gate of Heaven. Once the talisman enters the abdomen, one’s spirit transforms instantly—all ghosts bow in submission upon seeing it, and all spirits submit and return, serving as guardians to shield against external harm.

Then, on the corresponding day, write the name of one ghost upon white paper, hold it directly before the Gate of Heaven, recite the Heavenly August Lord’s incantation three times, draw *qi* three times, and blow it onto the seal. Coat the seal with cinnabar, face the direction, call the ghost’s name loudly once, and press the seal onto the paper. With each impression of the ghost’s name, the ghost manifests—sometimes as a Jade Maiden of the Six Dings or Six Jias. Question the ghosts in detail, and all their revelations will conform to your wishes. They may appear as a gentle breeze, a wisp of mist, clouds and rosy dawn, or transform into dragons and tigers, myriad forms of things, the bodies of mountains, forests, and cliffs, sheep or horses, flying or running creatures. They may ride clouds and cranes to roam beyond the world or swiftly traverse the Four Great Continents, observing all matters. To resolve injustices, take a sword one *chi* and two *cun* long, with a sharp, protruding blade. Hold the sword in the left hand toward the Gate of Heaven, grasp the Heavenly August Lord’s seal in the right, recite the Heavenly August Lord’s incantation three times, draw *qi* three times, blow it onto the seal, coat the seal with cinnabar, and press the tip of the sword with the seal before casting it into the air. The ghost will instantly comprehend your intent—even if separated by thousands of miles or vast rivers and seas, the target’s head will fall in an instant.

The Heavenly August Lord said: Long ago, there was a divine sage named Master Zhi Xu, who, before mastering inner mysteries, first grasped the principles of transformation. As he began his journey, he roamed beyond the Four Seas at will. Thus, in commanding the myriad spirits and attaining the multitude of wonders, none transcended this text. For those who encounter it, focus on emptiness and purity; do not let passions and desires violate these precepts. Align the heart with uprightness, guard the mind with Great Harmony, forget worldly concerns and embrace simplicity, gradually entering the lineage of immortals. If the Six Dusts remain unceasing, worldly attachments linger, desires persist, and mundane habits endure, one diverges from my teachings.

**Section on the Lineage of Spirits**
The Heavenly August Lord said: Beyond the celestial ghosts of the five directions, all lesser spirits belong to the lineage of *jing* and *mei*. Though their anomalies differ, they cannot aid the virtue of the upright *qi* and all belong to the category of private gods and demonic spirits. With my imperial seal and my imperial incantation, they manifest immediately and can be commanded like household servants. My method employs spirits as fiercely as wildfire burning autumn down, and commands ghosts as swiftly as ocean waves sweeping away withered leaves.

Beyond the upright spirits and upright ghosts, there are seventy-two *jing* spirits, which will be described in detail later. These ghosts are unclaimed by Heaven, ungoverned by Earth, unruled by the Five Marchmounts, unbound by mountains and seas. They do not follow great virtue nor aid the true wind, delighting in killing and chaos, lewdness and bloodshed. Such unrighteous ghosts are called private gods.

One is named the *Mo Hun Tun Shi Jing* (Demon-Soul Corpse-Devouring Spirit), appearing as a sixteen-year-old girl with a cinnabar face, vermilion lips, green eyebrows, and rosy cheeks. Her eyes are as clear as autumn waters, her body as smooth as congealed fat. She favors emerald robes and wears a moth-winged crown atop her head. Most who see her mistake her for an immortal maiden. She transforms into towers and palaces, using demonic *qi* to alter halls and chambers, causing illnesses and disrupting the mysterious wind, hindering the well-being of cultivators. This ghost spirit is surnamed Ren, with a single purple hair between her left eyebrow, about an inch long. Originally a ten-thousand-year-old fox, she has lived through countless ages, transforming into a seductive form to bewitch many. When Daoist cultivators encounter her in the mountains, they need only call her by her lesser name, *Mo Hun Tun Shi Gui*, and upon hearing it, her form vanishes instantly. Thus, knowing the root dispels the unholy.

Another is named the *Wu Tong Si Shen Zhi Gui Jing* (Five-Unions Private God Ghost Spirit), appearing as a handsome man with a single foot. He wanders the world, causing lewdness and disorder in people’s homes, sometimes lingering for years without departing. He originated from a household servant who, after death, gained the power of the Five Unions. In modern times, when women claim to share a bed with their husbands yet experience strange laughter, weeping, sudden deaths and revivals, or hear voices laughing in the air, speaking without cause, or when possessions vanish inexplicably, it is often this spirit afflicting them. To expel him, use a five-*cun* piece of yellow paper, inscribe the True Form Talisman of the Heavenly August Lord in cinnabar, burn it to ash, and have the afflicted woman swallow it with fragrant water while facing the Gate of Heaven. Hold the Heavenly August Lord’s seal toward the Gate of Heaven, recite the incantation three times, draw *qi* three times and chant it into the seal, then write the name of the Five Unions on white paper. Coat the seal with cinnabar, press it onto the paper, and have the woman carry it in a red silk pouch on her head. The spirit will vanish immediately.

One is named the *Mao Mao Shen* (Cat-Fur Spirit), appearing as a man over thirty, dressed in black with bare feet and chicken-like claws. He often possesses women, falsely claiming the title of a celestial spirit and foretelling the future. Modern *shi po* (spirit mediums) are often possessed by this spirit, which originated from the restless soul of a wrongfully deceased person.

Another is named the *Xue Shi Shen* (Blood Corpse Spirit), appearing as a monkey covered in bird-like fur, with red eyes and white eyebrows. It may transform into a snake, spider, or shrimp-like form. It often possesses women, consuming their visceral essence and drinking their blood, causing emaciation, illness, and death. After killing, it assumes its original form and enters another person’s body. Modern cases of consumptive diseases passed between men and women are examples of this.

The essence of this spirit originates from the old dog spirit of the *Tun Mao* (Feather-Swallowing) nation. Another name is the *Zhu Jiao Bai Fu Gui* (Pig-Horned White-Bellied Ghost). Its essence appears as a child of seven or eight, clad in purple with black feet, often transforming into the likeness of grain or water. If one mistakenly consumes it, it causes illness—silent, speechless, and leading to death—known as the "speechless disease." Daoist practitioners who desire only to drink water, their faces lacking luster, or those who lose their appetite at the sight of food, are afflicted by this entity within. Beware of consuming it.

This ghost arises from the restless soul of a woman who died in childbirth. Another name is the *Nü Cha Jing* (Female Fork Spirit), resembling a coarse, ill-favored woman in blue robes. It often possesses the bodies of children at night, stealing their souls and causing them to cry incessantly. Another is the *Tiao Liao Jing Gui* (Whipped Sprite Ghost), commanding three or four child-like attendants of varying forms—some with donkey heads and human bodies, yellow robes and red faces, carrying a sack filled with malevolent qi. It roams the eight directions, spreading pestilence among people. Modern references to epidemic diseases (*tian xing bing*) are manifestations of this ghost, which transforms into miasmic vapors.

This ghost emerges from unbalanced *qi* of the Five Phases, formed from the restless souls of the wrongfully deceased. Another name is the *Yao Chai Qu Shi Shen* (Biting-Breaking Crooked Stone Spirit), appearing as a young maiden with delicate beauty. It may transform into a human figure, fond of nocturnal slumber, and in dreams, it engages in yin-yang unions to steal a person’s true qi. This ghost originates from those who practiced *cai yin* (yin absorption) meditation but failed, also called the *Qing Ling Shan Shuang* (Clear Spirit and Bright Soul) ghost. Modern accounts of nocturnal ghostly unions refer to this. Unclaimed by celestial bureaus or earthly deities, it is a private spirit of heaven and earth, the essence of the eight mountains.

Another is named *Lei Sheng Ji* (Thunderous Roar), resembling a crouching tiger with a flowered, green neck. It roams high peaks at night but poses no harm to humans—it is the essence of a millennium-old copper vein. Another is *Chun Qiong Quan* (Spring Jade Spring), appearing as a sixteen-year-old girl with three buns, yellow robes, a long skirt, and bare feet, often holding fire and walking at night, extinguishing after a few steps. It is the essence of a millennium-old gold ore.

Another is *Shu Shao Nian* (Bound Youth), resembling a small boy with a hat and loose shoes, dressed in white with a refined appearance. It often appears at sunrise, holding a bird or fish, playing on human paths—it is the essence of a millennium-old silver vein. Another is the *Shuang Shi Shi Jing* (Double Stone Corpse Essence), with crimson, disheveled hair, tattered green robes, and green eyes, towering over ten feet tall. It lurks in mountains, responding to people, calling their names, and often causes rockslides or rolling stones in treacherous terrain, harming many. It arises from the unclaimed, solitary souls of those crushed to death by stones in the mountains. Unclaimed by heaven or earth, unrestrained by rivers, it harms living beings and takes lives.

Another is the *Yu Bai Shui Hao Jing* (Fish-White Water-Wasting Spirit), fiercely lurking in ponds. It transforms into the likeness of a drowned woman floating by the water’s edge. Those who see it and attempt to rescue her often drown—this entity is the essence of a restless soul who drowned. Another is the *Zhu She Bai Mian Jing* (Crimson Snake White-Faced Spirit), a ghostly form often seen by water, calling out to demand a replacement. If one encounters it and walks ten steps, the ghost exhales its qi, overpowering the person’s will and causing them to drown. This, too, is the essence of a drowned soul.

Another is *Wang Yu Zhen*, appearing as a small girl in an ornate crown and splendid robes, with delicate bones and a lovely face, dressed in blue with crimson shoes. She is often accompanied by two or three maidservants. This ghost frequents empty houses, rocky cliffs, walled altars, and secluded mountain depths, bewitching young men, nine out of ten of whom die. Those who see her have a single blue hair between their right eyebrows, about two inches long. She loves songs and poetry, and as dusk falls, she enchants the hearts of men. Many such cases exist in mountain valleys. Her essence originates from a three-thousand-year-old white snake spirit.

Another is the *Qiu Cao Ye Jing* (Autumn Grass Leaf Spirit), appearing as a young maiden with a moist complexion and a restrained demeanor, her hair wrapped in red silk. If encountered, she is often followed by five to seven companions. She can transform water into wine and is skilled in recitation.

Fashion a paper wick, anoint it with oil, and light it where the presence is suspected. Use another lamp to illuminate the area; where the flame dips, dig at dawn, and you will surely retrieve the object.

Another is the *Da Luo Sha Gui Essence*, its form ever-changing. It knows good and ill fortune, riding birds into homes at night or stirring sounds in chambers. It may weep before people.

It often manifests at dusk in ancient altars, tombs, roads, and wild fields. Its transformations vary in size, appearing and vanishing unpredictably—what people call *ghost fire*. This arises from blood—of the living, the dead, or beasts—spilled in desolate places, streets, cliffs, or mountains, lingering unabsorbed for three days before stealing a wisp of yin or yang qi to take form. The blood of the living burns red; the blood of the dead burns green with smoke. To observe it, hold the *Heavenly Sovereign’s Divine Seal* at the *Gate of Heaven*, recite the *Heavenly Sovereign’s Incantation* thrice, and blow three breaths upon the seal. Direct the seal toward the fire, and the ghost fire will draw near. Seal it again, and the ghost fire will vanish. Upon inspection, its form will be broken, revealing a vessel filled with bloody water, or remnants of skin, fur, or tattered cloth stained with fresh blood.

**Heavenly Statutes, Chapter Five**

The Heavenly Sovereign said: The *Heavenly Statutes* are the laws of the Eight Poles and the jade texts of the Nine Heavens.

The Heavenly Statutes serve to capture celestial soldiers, behead mighty spirits, sever demonic essences, eradicate malevolent wastage, slay ghostly apparitions, and sweep away misfortune—all of which are but the righteous qi of the Heavenly Statutes at their grandest. The Heavenly Statutes are for the beheading and sweeping away of demonic spirits, like a raging fire incinerating a single autumn hair; they eradicate ghostly apparitions as the vast sea washes away a rotten leaf, leaving nothing unscoured.

The method states: To sever demonic essences and ghostly apparitions, merely observe their forms and speak of the roots of their transformations. Declare their names, and they shall not dare depart. Then, follow the seal method, commanding the five directions’ righteous ghosts by name to drive the demonic essence to the beheading altar. Alternatively, consign the demonic essence to the Four Great Hells, each according to one’s intent.

To behead them, take the beheading sword, grasp it in the left hand at the *Gate of Heaven*, recite the *Heavenly Sovereign’s Incantation* thrice, draw a single breath, and blow upon the seal. Apply cinnabar to the seal, then stamp the sword’s tip once. Cast the sword into the air, and the summoned ghost shall discern the practitioner’s intent. After a moment, the beheading shall be complete, and the true form of the demonic essence shall be revealed.

The Heavenly Sovereign said: The altar must be bounded with cinnabar in three layers, whether upon stone or earth, five *chi* in length and five *chi* in width. Upon encountering any demonic essence, the Heavenly Statutes must be employed to sever its root, thereby preventing future hauntings. Should one see a demon and fail to behead it, witness a monster and fail to eradicate it, or see a suffering patient and fail to save them, this too is a sin of uncompassionate heart.

Thus, demonic essences are eradicated in distant lands, ghostly apparitions are beheaded at the Yellow Springs, and malevolent wastage is driven from the ritual altar to aid the rectification of the true wind, preventing demonic spirits from harming our people.

The Heavenly Sovereign said: Upon encountering a demonic ghost, swiftly burn half a bundle of white paper money for the beheaded essence.

**The Four Hells of the Heavenly Statutes for Beheading Demonic Essences**
**Diagram of the Heavenly Sovereign’s Altar for Rectifying the Dao**
To behead them, take the seal, summon the ghost by name, and drive the demonic essence to be beheaded. If not yet beheaded, consign it to hell to prevent its escape.

**Seal of the Heavenly Sovereign’s Altar**
This seal is placed in the northwest at *Qian*.
*(Original diagram missing)*
This seal is placed in the northeast at *Gen*.
*(Original diagram missing)*
This seal is placed in the southeast at *Xun*.
This seal is placed in the southwest at *Kun*.

**Chapter Six: The Heavenly Sovereign’s Divine Seals**
The Heavenly Sovereign said: Those who receive the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* thereby receive the Three Sovereigns’ inner seals. The Heavenly Sovereign’s upper seal is four *cun* in length and three *cun* in width; the Earthly Sovereign’s middle seal is three *cun* and five *fen* in length and width; the Human Sovereign’s lower seal is three *cun* in length and width.

Take a segment of the heartwood of a thunder-struck jujube tree—or, failing that, a cart axle—and prepare the seal material accordingly. At the time of the investiture ritual, place it in the direction of *Heavenly Medicine* and arrange it alongside the altar, serving the four directions. First, select a pure chamber, barring chickens, dogs, women, and wives from the exterior. Within, rectify the spirit, bathe in purity, and face the eight directions in reverence before opening the seal.

On the day the seal is carved, if winds stir sand and stones, clouds and mists gather, thunder roars from the four directions, and rain clamors, these are the ominous signs of the seal’s opening power. Once the seal is carved, it must be encased in a crimson silk pouch, stored in a stone box, and secreted within a cavern or stone chamber to accord with the Dao of Heaven.

When employing the seal in ritual, first burn incense and silently invoke the Three Sovereigns, the lofty perfected, and the Five Marchmounts to request the seal. Then, command the ghostly soldiers of the world to sever and behead the demonic spirits and malevolent gods within the realm. The Heavenly Sovereign said: The might of this seal’s method governs the myriad spirits, and none shall fail to submit.

Recite the divine incantation and blow upon the seal. With the Heavenly Sovereign’s seal, stamp the stars and they shall fall; stamp the moon and it shall wane; stamp the sun and it shall eclipse; stamp clouds and mist and they shall disperse; stamp wind and rain and they shall cease. Use the seal to summon the ghosts of the five directions, and there shall be no wind unobtained, no rain unsummoned—such is the power of the Heavenly Sovereign’s upper seal.

With the Earthly Sovereign’s middle seal, stamp the earth and it shall split; stamp grass and trees and they shall turn to ash; stamp flying birds and they shall plummet; stamp tigers and insects and they shall die—such is the power of the Earthly Sovereign’s middle seal.

With the Human Sovereign’s lower seal, stamp all ailments and none shall not be cured. Should one suffer misfortune, swallow the seal with fragrant water, and none shall not be blessed with good fortune, vigor, and prosperity. Stamp a person’s back heart, and they shall instantly die; stamp their front heart, and they shall instantly revive—such is the power of the Human Sovereign’s lower seal.

Thus, the Three Sovereigns’ divine seals govern the Dao of the Three Primes with unparalleled greatness. To verify their efficacy, take a seven-year-old child, apply cinnabar to the seal, recite the incantation, and stamp their front heart—the mark shall appear on their back. Such is the proven method of the Three Sovereigns’ inner secret writ. Without these divine seals, demons shall not fear; with them, the hundred evils shall flee in terror.

**Chapter Seven: The Heavenly Sovereign’s Divine Incantation**
The incantation states:

By the decree of the Most High Perfected, the Celestial August Emperor of the Great Canopy.

**Chapter Eight: The Celestial August Emperor’s True Form Talisman**

The Celestial August Lord declares: The traces of the true form are none other than Our true form, the jade register’s talismanic script. Inscribe the talisman upon silk with cinnabar and a new brush, then wear or affix it—one’s spirit transforms instantly, myriad ghosts self-annihilate, hundred demons bind their forms, and all malevolent spirits vanish without trace, while the divine and sagely draw near.

In the method of absorption, swallow the talisman into the belly, and the ghosts and spirits shall reveal their true visages—truly the form of the Celestial August Emperor. For this reason, the celestial spirits submit to it.

The Celestial August Lord declares: Within the world’s seas, for all who suffer unhealed ailments, disasters befalling the self, chronic and severe illness, years of peril, or sudden afflictions unable to be relieved—inscribe this talisman in vermilion, burn it to ash, and swallow it with fragrant water. None shall fail to swiftly recover.

**Chapter Nine: The Altar Rites for the Transmission of the Three August Ones’ Method**

The altar measures eight feet square, with a stone mound as the highest tier and an earthen mound as the next. The petition to the Three August Ones and Five Marchmounts follows this form:

*[State your] prefecture, county, village, and dharma rank. Your servant, [Name], respectfully declares: From youth, your servant has pondered the Dao of immortality, ascending the divine wind, yearning for the true and mysterious, desiring to seek great fortune. Now, on [date], by karmic affinity, I have encountered the golden script, its wondrous transformations held within, and dare to employ it privately.*

*With reverence, I present this memorial, humbly invoking the Three August Emperors and the Five Directional August Immortal Lords. May the merciful radiance of the great and compassionate Perfected Ones, the lofty immortals, shine forth—what place shall remain unillumined? As the compassionate breeze scatters, how can any land be left untouched?*

*Your servant, [Name], a mere ant in feeling, a life adrift in the bitter sea, endowed with the nature of the numinous yet a body scorched by flames—now that the sacred mound is prepared and the jade blossoms fresh, I pray the Celestial Lords’ cinnabar light descend swiftly, the sacred mound arrayed in ranks, to grant your servant, [Name], the covenant of confirmation and dare to receive the mysterious scriptural Dao.*

*[Date], [Rank and Name], respectfully submits this memorial.*

When the sacred mound is ready for the rite, begin at the *hai* hour, proceeding until the *zi* hour. Face the Celestial Gate, adjust your robes and cap, bow, then burn the memorial of invocation. After a moment, an uncommon fragrance enters the nose, radiant light dazzles the eyes, and ethereal luminosity flows—suddenly, simurghs and cranes soar through the void, the body chills with trembling, and the spirit is awestruck. This is the sign of the Immortal Lords and host of sages descending upon the mound.

As the Immortal Lords alight, the tea and wine may change color. At this moment, adjust your robes, bow to the mound in the eight directions, and do not succumb to fear. Compose your spirit within, calm your heart and mind, and pray to the August Ones: *"Your servant, [Name], now receives the celestial scriptures’ secret writings and humbly begs the covenant of confirmation."*

From the *zi* to the *mao* hour, the mound may be dismantled. Face the Celestial Gate and burn five portions of spirit money. All paper horses and money are offered at the Ghost Gate. Burn a small memorial with three bundles of white paper money, commanding the Forty Great Ghosts of the Five Directions to gather them. Then employ the seal to enact the method, subdue ghosts, expel evil, seal mountains and dwellings—all shall respond naturally to its resonance.

**Chapter Ten: The Three August Ones’ Sword Method**

The Celestial August Lord declares: On a *jiazi* day, take three catties and six taels of bright steel and forge a sword two feet and four inches long. Engrave upon it the true form talismans of the Celestial August, Terrestrial August, and Human August Ones, then wrap it in plain silk. Weight it with a cord and lower it into a well untouched by humans for many years. After forty-nine days, retrieve the sword and talisman—it shall have absorbed the earth’s numinous spirits, its iron turning white, its blade blood-red. No ghost or demon beholding it shall fail to be subdued and destroyed. This is called the *Hongquan Iron*, a sword transformed by the divine and numinous.

Store it in a precious casket. When wielded, speak the method’s incantations, and its divine might shall respond without fail.

**The Upper Scroll of the Three August Ones’ Esoteric Writings of the Eight Poles’ Divine Chapters from the Jade Flower Immortal Writings of the Golden Gate of Great Clarity concludes.**

**The Middle Scroll of the Three August Ones’ Esoteric Writings of the Eight Poles’ Divine Chapters from the Jade Flower Immortal Writings of the Golden Gate of Great Clarity begins.**

This text, the *Mysterious Gate of the Boundless Cavern Chapter*, is the origin of the cinnabar terrace and jasper grove, the beginning of cloud blossoms and rosy dawns—a natural treasure script of the Great Canopy in Heaven. Its purple writings on jade slips were formed from the red qi exhaled by the August Ones of Highest Heaven, their cinnabar splendor congealing into talismanic script. It was concealed in the Purple Tenuity and inscribed upon jade, gold, and blossoming jasper tablets.

Within it are methods for dwelling in mountains, the Eight Luminous Divine Lads of the Great Cavern, enabling one to remain unharmed by wolves and tigers, immune to venomous creatures, to behold numinous mushrooms, discern immortal medicines, distinguish the true from the false, recognize immortal guests, and master the arts of transformation, subjugation, and divine strategy—all contained herein. Those who encounter it must hold it in deepest secrecy.

**Chapter One: The Terrestrial August One’s Divine Seal**

The Terrestrial August One’s divine seal governs the vast earth at the center of the mundane world, over which all matters are sovereign. Thus, the seal’s great purport precedes all methods.

For those who cannot rely on external breath—such as immortal medicines transforming form, borrowing objects to assume shapes, or adopting names to manifest images—many take the forms of birds and beasts or male and female figures. When illuminated by this seal, all are utterly undone.

Auspicious mushrooms and wondrous herbs, when transformed or altered, shall all be made manifest by this seal’s light.

**Eulogy of the Terrestrial August One’s Divine Seal’s Numinous Extremity:**

The *Kuai* wind and Eight Slayers subdue celestial spirits,
The Nine Mysteries and Four-Eyed Old Man submit.
The Great Beginning’s feathered transformations wield the great handle,
Earth’s malevolent essences behold its awe-inspiring might.
Profound, profound—the celestial writings are the divine ancestors,
Beyond the mysterious, mysterious—nothing more remains.
One may await the jade blossom’s numinous light talismans,
Eradicating traces of divine winds and sweeping away harm.

The precious seal, the jade dragon’s prime ministerial pivot,
Its divine mechanism governs and drives most fittingly.
Heaven’s secrets and demonic spirits lie beyond all bounds,
The seal’s blade and immortal spirits pierce the azure void.

**The Dragon-Florescence Radiant Gold Script Seal**

The Dragon-Florescence’s resplendent gold-script seal—
At a single glimpse, all demonic hordes bind their forms.
The Purple Star of the Great Ultimate subdues thirty thousand,
Sweeping away evil and dispelling ranks of malevolent spirits.
The Mysterious Numinous lends me the seal’s power,
Aiding the true heavens to sweep away all monstrous traces.
The earth purified, the void ascended—ghosts and spirits quail,
Facing the mountain, harnessing qi is the supreme pivot.
Lingzhi transforms into a hundred thousand forms,
Immortal herbs become birds and beasts.
When the seal illumines the void, nothing escapes its grasp,
For the great transformation of nature brooks no sentiment.

**Incantation of the Terrestrial August One:**
*"Southern Seven Stars, Earth’s Gate of Six Dings,
Six Jia Jade Maidens, heed my seal’s command—
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law decrees!"*

**Second Chapter: True Form Talismanic Seal of the Terrestrial August One**
**Talismanic Diagram of the Terrestrial August One’s True Form Jade Seal**
*Four inches in length, four inches in width—*
*Inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper.*

The Terrestrial August Lord declares: For those dwelling in mountain caves or hermitages, or secluded in forests and valleys, at dawn each day, inscribe this true-form divine talisman, burn it to ash, mix with fragrant water, and—facing the Gate of Heaven—consume it. This will prolong life and extend years, while evil qi cannot assail you. For those living in the mountains, gathering all immortal lingzhi and numinous herbs, swallow the talisman and enter the abdomen, then illumine with the seal—such herbs will come of their own accord.

**Third Chapter: Proper Practices for Mountain-Dwelling Adepts**
The Terrestrial August Lord declares: Among all beings, humans are the most noble. Thus, all living things must have their root, and all affairs must have their proper course. If a superficial learner suddenly conceives a virtuous thought yet fails to grasp the true principle or fathom the mysterious and profound, and rashly enters the famous mountains, they will encounter the five pitfalls and eight slayers’ misfortunes, or unforeseen mountain disasters—injuries from insects, maulings by tigers—leading many to their deaths, unaware that dwelling in mountains has its own method.

The formula states:
- Those born in the *yin* or *chen* hours should dwell in the *qian* or *kan* mountains as their land of blessing.
- Those born in the *mao*, *si*, or *wu* hours should dwell in the *kun* mountain as their land of blessing.
- Those born in the *shen* or *wei* hours should dwell in the *gen* mountain as their land of blessing.
- Those born in the *you* hour should dwell in the *zhen* mountain as their land of blessing.
- Those born in the *xu* hour should dwell in the *xun* mountain as their land of blessing.
- Those born in the *hai*, *zi*, or *chou* hours should dwell in the *li* or *dui* mountains as their land of blessing.

Though one may have a blessed land to dwell in, if the due east, due south, or southeast faces a valley, and in spring or summer the trees appear withered, the grasses parched, and the stones and woods lack moisture, this is called a "Scorching Slayer Mountain." Those who dwell here will often suffer mountain fires—seek another mountain more suitable.

**Fourth Chapter: Offering Rites to the Mountain Lord**
The Terrestrial August Lord declares: Great mountains have great mountain lords, and small mountains have small mountain lords. For those entering the mountains to cultivate the Dao who do not perform offerings to invite their lord, it is as if one enters another’s home without cause—the spirits and humans will grow distant in sentiment. When entering a mountain to select a cave or hermitage, spread a clean cloth upon the ground or a stone at the mountain’s gate, place a dish of plain food, a portion of tea and wine, and make offerings for a short while. Burn a bundle of white spirit-money, and cast a small petition into the fire for the attendant to burn. The petition should state: *"On such-and-such a year, month, and day, I enter this mountain to seek the Dao of long life. Not daring to dwell here privately, I now perform offerings to invite the mountain lord’s divine spirit, beseeching your protection and aid."* Only then may one enter and dwell in the mountain, as if relying on a patron.

**Fifth Chapter: Selecting Caves by the High Mystery’s Vital Qi**
The Terrestrial August Lord declares: Though one may dwell in a blessed land, one must still select a cave abode. For a blessed land, if within the mountain’s due east there is a cave chamber with a door five *chi* or more in height—no less than three *zhang*—this is a divine immortal’s grotto. If the door is less than five *chi* in height, it is but a "Yang Mist Hermitage," unsuitable for dwelling. If the cave is over three *zhang* in height, it is a "Cloud Embryo Isle"—though one may dwell there, it harbors strong yin and harsh yang that injure the human spirit and soul.

If there is a stone chamber in the due south with a door five *chi* or more in height—no less than three *zhang*—this is called a "Grotto Abode." A stone chamber in the southeast is the "Luminous Radiance Grotto"; in the due west, it is called the "Soul Cavern"; in the due north, the "Corpse Hollow"; and in the northeast, the "Stone Poison." Dwelling in a "Stone City Grotto" will naturally evoke auspicious responses, and lingzhi and elixir herbs will manifest. But those who dwell in hollows and caverns will not only suffer from spectral perils but also sever the vital qi of heaven and earth and the bloodline of immortals. Without divine scriptures, the calamity will be great.

When entering a suitable mountain without a grotto, if one sees in the southeast flourishing trees, moist stones, and lush grasses, with water flowing in three bends resembling the character *shang*, one may cut thatch to build a hermitage and cultivate the root of life—this too is a blessed land of immortals, and one is certain to become a celestial official.

**Sixth Chapter: Sealing the Mountain and Purifying the Earth by the Primordial Heaven**
The Terrestrial August Lord declares: Having settled in an immortal’s abode, one must seal the mountain and purify the earth to prevent malevolent spirits from trespassing upon one’s domain. Take six peachwood boards, each seven inches long, three inches wide, and one inch thick, leaving the bark on one side and smoothing the other. With a new brush and fragrant ink, inscribe a Six Ding spirit talisman on each board. Coat the seal with cinnabar, hold it in the left hand, face the Gate of Heaven, recite the Terrestrial August Incantation three times, draw three breaths of qi, and blow upon the seal. Recoat the seal with cinnabar and impress it once upon each Six Ding talisman. Then place the boards to guard the six directions—naturally, malevolent spirits will vanish without trace, tigers and leopards will conceal their forms, birds will cease their cries, and all creatures will disappear. Dwelling here for long, one will ascend to the celestial realms by the Dao.

**Seventh Chapter: Discerning Immortal Guests and Malevolent Spirits**
The Terrestrial August Lord declares: Those who dwell long in famous grottoes and immortal abodes, as days and years deepen and their resolve for the Dao grows pure, will naturally have immortal guests and divine officials descend.

To discern these, if at dawn or dusk one suddenly sees rainbow-hued clouds drifting through the void, true incense wafting into the valley, or auspicious colors and propitious qi lingering, these are signs of exalted perfected beings on their passage. With sincere devotion, one should reverently announce to the Heavenly August Lord and seek the Way of liberation—then the exalted perfected, moved by compassion, will naturally descend to instruct.

If wandering among cliffs, valleys, streams, or forested peaks, one suddenly sees clouds and radiance enveloping the scene, with rare beasts and auspicious birds gathering all around, or if there appears one clad in red robes with a vermilion dragon, or another in yellow robes with jade pendants, or six maidens in purple attire, or those bearing staffs, banners, and canopies—these are divine immortals descending.

If in the emptiness of forests, valleys, or mountain peaks, one suddenly sees black qi or dark clouds swirling, with indistinct figures in caps and robes, whether few or many, drifting in confusion—these are malevolent spirits assembling. Thus, when immortals are about to descend, a fragrant breeze first permeates the valley, entering the nose and mind. If no such fragrant wind appears, it is not the advent of immortals. Exercise caution and do not gaze upon them.

**Eighth Chapter: Discerning the Thirty-Six Transformed Forms of Zhi-Grasses**

1. Immortal-Foot Zhi: purple star.
2. Cinnabar Zhi: vermilion star.
3. Purple Zhi: yellow star.
4. Radiant Zhi: azure star.
5. Cloud Zhi: primal star.
6. Heavenly Zhi: black star.
7. Earthly Zhi: green star.
8. Mist Zhi: brown star.
9. Divine Zhi: marked with red veins like tangled threads.

These nine zhi are of a single nature. Born in renowned mountains, they are congealed from the spiritual qi of numinous stones over myriad ages, varying in size and white as cold jade. At night in the valleys, their light pierces the heavens; though they appear as stone, their hues are lustrous and fresh, distinguished by their star-like specks.

1. Azure Zhi: blue blossoms.
2. Numinous Zhi: black blossoms.
3. Flame Zhi: purple blossoms.
4. Water Zhi: white blossoms.
5. Qi Zhi: yellow blossoms.
6. Jade Zhi: vermilion blossoms.
7. Treasure Zhi: pink blossoms.
8. Dragon Zhi: azure blossoms.
9. Tiger Zhi: green blossoms.

These nine zhi are of a single nature, their roots growing by rivers, seas, mountains, and streams, or along great and small waterways. Born from the accumulated essence of mountain and water, they resemble fine hemp leaves, standing three to five feet tall, evergreen through winter and summer. Their crowns are often veiled in faint, cloud-like qi, distinguished by their colors and blossoms.

1. Jade Zhi: flower-shaped.
2. Pillar Zhi: wood-shaped.
3. Floral Zhi: bird-shaped.
4. Golden Zhi: human-shaped.
5. Mystic Zhi: cloud-cluster-shaped.
6. Brocade Zhi: beast-shaped.
7. Azure Zhi: formless.
8. Moist Zhi: water-shaped.
9. Wind Zhi: tower-and-pagoda-shaped.

These nine zhi share a single root-nature. They grow in stone chambers of grotto-heavens and mountain caves, transformed from the condensation of cloud-roots and mist-tips. Their size is unfathomable, resembling stalactites with forms of dragons, tigers, flying birds, and human figures clinging to stone walls. Their color is like burning cinnabar, glowing day and night, exuding fragrant qi in visible shapes.

These twenty-seven varieties are the jade-blossomed, gold-stemmed, feather-transformed immortal zhi. Those who encounter and ingest them will ascend to the celestial rivers, transmuting mortal bones into immortal ones, transforming into perfected beings, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness, and soaring through the nine heavens. Thus the ancients said: "When numinous zhi enters the belly, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight."

1. Cloud-Essence Zhi: cloud-cluster-shaped.
2. Yellow Zhi: dog-shaped.
3. Heroic Zhi: tower-and-pavilion-shaped.
4. Auspicious Zhi: mandarin-duck-shaped.
5. Elegant Zhi: crane-shaped.
6. Florid Zhi: flower-and-fruit-shaped.
7. Wood Zhi: moth-shaped.
8. Grass Zhi: tiger-shaped.
9. Supreme Zhi: human-shaped.

These nine zhi are transformations of a single root. Their forms are unpredictable, often growing on withered trees, rotting stumps, palace courtyards, or the beams of water pavilions. Ingesting them can prolong life and extend years, offering modest benefit.

**Ninth Chapter: Discerning the Thirty-Six Forms of Immortal Medicines**

1. Cinnabar Essence: red in form.
2. Malachite Essence: blue in form.
3. Gypsum Essence: white in form.
4. Realgar Essence: red in form.
5. Sulphur Essence: yellow in form.
6. Hollow Malachite Essence: pale red in form.
7. Alum Essence: green in form.
8. Mica Essence: black in form.
9. Cinnabar Sand Essence: purple in form.

These nine immortal medicine essences are transformations of metals and stones, each resembling a great demon with crimson hair and red brows, manifesting in various forms. Their distinct body colors serve as markers.

1. Black Stone Essence: sixteen legs.
2. Yu’s Remnant Essence: twenty-four legs.
3. Well-Spring Stone Essence: twelve legs.
4. Basin Earth Essence: ten legs.
5. Orpiment Essence: legless, with fleshy wings, adept at flying.
6. Talc Essence: eight legs.
7. Actinolite Essence: six legs.
8. Stone Fat Essence: four legs.
9. Mercury Essence: two legs.

These nine stone essences are also transformations of metals and stones. They resemble scorpions of indeterminate size, white as silk, distinguished by the presence or absence of legs.

1. Ginseng Essence: like a small child in plain robes, holding flowers.
2. Poria Essence: like a small child holding pine or cypress.

A **Lycium Berry Essence**, resembling a small dog, howling in mountain valleys at night.
A **Rhubarb Essence**, appearing as a woman, bare-bodied yet clutching garments.
An **Amber Essence**, like a tiger, capable of soaring through the air.
A **Millennial Kudzu Essence**, resembling a scaleless dragon, often concealed in stone caves.
An **Aged Vine Essence**, shaped like a lump of flesh, which when broken reveals a paste-like substance.
A **Solomon’s Seal Essence**, like a child holding a sprig of Solomon’s seal.
A **Atractylodes Essence**, like a child holding a sprig of atractylodes, often roaming high peaks and ridges, appearing at night.

These nine essences of immortal herbs are all transformations of plants. They are commonly found in famous mountains, distinguished by their forms, colors, and bodily features.

A **Gastrodia Essence**, crimson as blood.
A **Polygala Essence**, white in color.
A **Rehmannia Essence**, yellow in hue.
An **Achyranthes Essence**, earth-toned.
An **Aconite Essence**, black in color.
A **White Wood Essence**, purple in hue.
A **Cistanche Essence**, green in color.
A **Usnea Essence**, azure.
A **Licorice Essence**, brown.

These nine essences of immortal herbs are transformations of *zhi* mushrooms. They are often found in famous mountains, resembling large spiders with vermilion eyes, no mouth, and four legs. The *zhi* mushrooms from which they arise are distinguished by their colors.

To discern these thirty-six immortal herbs and their transformations: take a sheet of white paper and inscribe the name of the desired essence or herb upon it. Hold the **Earth Sovereign Seal** toward the Gate of Heaven, grasp the seal, and recite the **Earth Sovereign Incantation** three times. Draw in three breaths of *qi* and exhale them onto the seal, then coat the seal with cinnabar. Imprint the seal upon the inscribed name, and the transformed *zhi* mushroom will manifest from afar. Press the seal again, and the herb in its true form will appear. Consuming it will refine the mortal body, summoning wind and clouds beneath one’s feet, granting immortality and everlasting vision.

**Chapter Ten: The Earth Sovereign’s Ingestion of Immortal Herbs for Ascension and Dao-Attainment**

Take sixteen *jin* of **Southern-Facing Artemisia**, wash and soak it clean. Peel three *jin* of **White Poria** and three *jin* of **Asparagus Root** (with hearts removed). Place all three ingredients into a mortar and pound them three thousand five hundred times until they resemble a smooth paste. Transfer the mixture into an earthenware pot, add one *dan* of water, and simmer over a slow fire until reduced to three *dou*. Discard the dregs, then continue simmering the liquid until it thickens to the consistency of honey. Seal it in a jar.

Each day, dissolve half a *liang* in fine wine and consume it on an empty stomach. Avoid meat, mallow, sour or salty foods, and sexual activity. After one hundred days, long-standing ailments will vanish, and all diseases will be eradicated. After one year, the five viscera will be harmonized, the body will glow with luminosity, and one will naturally abstain from grains. The mind will be clear, the spirit refreshed, and one will be untouched by cold or heat, the complexion radiant and moist. After three years, the body will generate jade-like luster, a halo will encircle the neck, and with prolonged ingestion, one will transcend life and death, roaming beyond the mundane, known as a **Refined Practitioner Immortal**—one who has attained the Dao through *zhi* mushrooms.

**The Supreme Clarity Golden Palace Jade Flower Immortal Scripture: Eight Poles Divine Chapters, Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Writings, Scroll Two**

**The Supreme Clarity Golden Palace Jade Flower Immortal Scripture: Eight Poles Divine Chapters, Three Sovereigns’ Esoteric Writings, Scroll Three**

The Dao, reaching nothingness, gives birth to Heaven and Earth.
Heaven, in its ceaseless motion, leaves the North Star unmoved, embracing emptiness without depletion...

The Earth, in its utmost stillness, never ceases its eastward flow, nor exhausts its clouds; thus Heaven endures and Earth abides—why then should man alone face death? This is because man fails to comprehend the inclinations of Heaven and Earth, neglects the spirits that govern the cosmic order, mistakes fleeting attachments for love, and worldly desires for kinship. Before reaching middle age, many invite calamity upon their fate.

Now, therefore, the origins of the Great Void are revealed, the primal essence of Heaven and Earth is clarified, and the methods of refining the spirit are disclosed—to deliver all beings and prevent the loss of the human Dao. Those who encounter this teaching and cultivate with devotion may ascend to Heaven in broad daylight; those who refine *qi* through the Dao may abide in the world without dying.

This text is the profound esoterica of the Supreme Mystery, a deep revelation of celestial mechanics. It is sealed within a jade casket—should it be recklessly disseminated, nine generations of ancestors will suffer misfortune. Guard it well, guard it well.

**Chapter One: Restraining Evil and Cultivating Goodness**
The essence of Yang is the *hun* and the spirit; the essence of Yin is the *po* and the *shi*. When the spirit prevails, goodness arises; when the *po* grows strong, evil emerges. Restraining evil and cultivating goodness brings order; forgetting goodness and following evil brings chaos. With prolonged order, the *shi* perishes and the *po* vanishes; with prolonged chaos, the spirit departs and the *hun* scatters. Thus, when the *shi* perishes and the *po* vanishes, spirit and form unite, ascending with the Great Yang to become an immortal. When the spirit departs and the *hun* scatters, the *shi* and *po* sink, descending with the Great Yin to become a ghost. Such is the natural principle.

**Chapter Two: Establishing the Upright and Forgetting the Deviant**
In cultivating the Dao, one must establish the upright and forget the deviant. If the upright is not established, disorder arises, harming the spirit; if the deviant is not forgotten, myriad evils are attracted, bringing harm to the body. Thus, establishing the upright brings one daily closer to the Dao of immortality, while following the deviant draws one daily nearer to the path of ghosts. Clinging to emotions, failing to sever thoughts, ceasing not from desires, and allowing the heart to remain turbid—indulging in greed, gluttony, and cravings, refusing to relinquish attachments, and following the heart’s every whim—these are the ways of the deviant.

**Chapter Three: Clarity and Confusion**
Failing to recognize the worthy, failing to choose friends wisely, failing to discern the Dharma—how can one avoid delusion? Failing to recognize the two truths’ reversals, failing to examine the intermingling of Yin and Yang, practicing without restraint, suppressing one’s nature and exhausting the spirit—how can one avoid harm? Failing to grasp the profound mystery and clinging to minor techniques—how can one avoid illness? Expending effort in vain and inviting death—how can one avoid error?

**Chapter Four: Fortifying the Body**
Fortifying the body is the first task of nurturing life and the root of the Great Dao. Dwelling in seclusion, one forgets sound and color, abiding in purity and harmony with Heaven’s accord. Yet one must discern what harms and benefits, recognize prohibitions and taboos, understand the internal and external, and know the cycles of generation and destruction. Still the floral fluids in the Jade Pool, preserve the flowing *ghee* in the Purple Palace. When essence accumulates, primordial *qi* arises spontaneously; when *qi* flourishes, the spirit gathers of its own accord; when the spirit flourishes and gathers, the Five *Qi* circulate naturally. Once the Five *Qi* circulate, one gradually approaches the state of the profound and ultimate truth.

**Chapter Five: Refining Spirit and Qi**
The *Divine Water* and *River Chariot* gleam ever anew,
Repeatedly refining the *Knife and Square* without end.
The *Li* trigram’s image drips with jade-like drops,
Scattering emerald mists in ever-deepening depths.
Employ the union of *Kan* and *Li*, the Dragon and Tiger,
Once at midnight, once at noon—each ascent and descent.
Up and down they soar in ceaseless motion.
Seek further the primordial origin, advancing step by step,
At each step, the hours of *Mao* and *You*.
Passing through Kunlun, the jade-like *ghee* flows,
Entering the Flower Pool, divided into three mouths.
Flowing upward, exchanging and merging with pure Yang,
Filling the entire realm, coursing through all the organs.
With the Eight Uprights and Three Lines, the fire’s number is complete,
Spirit and *qi* unite, the body becomes indestructible.

**Formula:**
Drip by drip, the jade-like nectar glistens like water,
Refining and returning to the origin, replenishing the marrow’s void.
When the Eight Trigrams’ upright *qi* arise as one,
They surge through the double passes, transforming the body’s countenance.

**Chapter Six: Emergence of the Sacred Embryo**
Azure, so clear; emerald, so rich—
A single luminous pearl, untouched by dust.
When dust is utterly gone, the original truth appears.
Once the original truth appears, there is no great or small,
Transforming and penetrating the spirit, becoming the *Chenying*.
Essence embraces blood, blood embraces essence,
Essence and blood unite, flesh and bone are born.
When flesh and bone are born, Heaven and Earth divide;
Heaven and Earth divide, the spleen resides in *zhi*,
*Zhi* resides in the spleen, the *hun* enters the liver,
Heart and kidneys harmonize, the *po* enters the lungs,
The five organs are at peace, the spirit is wholly complete.
Then the Three Powers divide into six positions,
Within them, the Essence Palace receives the Gate of Abundance.
The Six Pitches divide the lines, determining the Five Tones;
When the Five Tones are complete, the Yang number is fulfilled.
Half a celestial cycle burns and bends,
Spirit divides, form stabilizes, *zhi* and essence refine,
Continuously tempering and refining the upright *qi*.
When upright *qi* arises, the spirit naturally communicates,
And after ten months of work, the sacred embryo is formed.
Once the sacred embryo is complete, it moves freely without obstruction,
Roaming the Four Great Continents and ascending to Penglai Palace,
Abiding for a million years without decay.

**Formula:**
When the Yang number is fulfilled, nurture the sacred embryo,
Essence enfolds the initial spirit, hands and feet awaken.
From nine to nine, refine and witness nine,
A single body divides into multiple forms.

**Chapter Seven: Transcending to Immortality**
The Dao’s origin is One, yet its applications are three. Above, there is the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang, the ceaseless intertwining of the Two *Qi*, cycling endlessly without losing their order—this is the Dao. Mastering it, one soars amidst the clouds of the empyrean, where the sun and moon traverse, the Two Eights and Nine Sixes, essence and brilliance mutually consuming, *hun* and *po* uniting without losing their measure—this is the Dao. Ascending further, one reaches the Southern Palace, where below the Five Phases transmit and convey, receiving *qi* and forming combinations, generating lines and producing images without losing their principle—this is the Dao. Mastering it, one ascends to the Three Isles, where there is no beginning and no end.

The Human Sovereign Lord said: All cultivators who refine the spirit, strengthen the bones, and fortify life do not transcend these divine chapters. Following the currents of the Dao, some dwell in mountain caves, some in forest hermitages, others choose a quiet chamber. Burning incense and flowers, the pure *qi* flourishes. Then, on an auspicious day, one faces the eight directions—east, west, south, north, and the four intermediates. After paying homage, the furnace is set, *qi* is refined, *qi* stabilizes essence, essence stabilizes the spirit, and the spirit engenders life.

With prolonged refinement, wondrous transformation perfects the true. Through nine revolutions and five returns, three reversions and eight changes, one’s celestial bearing aligns, youthful purity returns, the frail grow strong, the aged regain vigor, the robust become youthful, and the young revert to infancy. Thus, from the mortal one attains sagehood; refining the sage leads to immortality, refining the immortal leads to perfection, refining the perfected leads to subtlety, refining subtlety merges with the spirit, and refining the spirit unites with emptiness—where *qi* and the primordial Dao begin.

Know then that the Dao resides within me: I soar beyond the four seas, or enter the imperial realm, ascend to the Golden Gates to pay homage to the exalted perfected, my name inscribed among the Nine Origins, my rank aligned with the stars. Some abide above the Nine Heavens, some lodge in the halls of the Eight Poles, some join the host of immortals at the Dark Capital’s court, or accompany the exalted perfected in the Great Veil Heaven. Some wander famous mountains and sea peaks, or attend the assemblies of the Southern Palace; some ascend to heaven to review the names of humans and ghosts, or descend to the world to record merits and transgressions from rites and fasts. Some govern the great mountains and rivers, or oversee the registers of life and death. Some ride phoenix chariots with the immortals, journeying north to the Purple Garden; or pass south through Golden Springs, gathering wise companions to pluck herbs and flowers. Some travel west to Tortoise Mountain to pay court to the Queen Mother in her golden palace; or cross the Fusang Tree to drink crimson wine in the Jade Orchard. Free from the highest, free from action, the immortal perfected abide in spontaneity—empty perfection transforms into the immortal adept.

How does one become an immortal adept? First, sever the six roots and cut off the six dusts: sight perceives no objects, hearing detects no sounds. Serene and tranquil, clear and subtle, empty and luminous, embracing the primordial, the celestial truth undergoes six transformations—through the utmost spirit refining *qi*, one achieves this. It is not attained through worldly passions, greed, or attachments of love.

**Chapter Eight: The Talismans and Seals of the Human Sovereign**
The talisman is the true form of dragon script; the seal is the upright *qi* of the Great Void. It embodies the profound intent of the Celestial Origin, the union of celestial mechanisms, the wondrous operation of the utmost truth’s great pivot—the ancestral method for commanding spirits and ghosts, the key to subduing demons and heresies. Struck by this seal’s power, one can conceal form and disperse shadow, hide *qi* and gather spirit, causing yin and yang to transform the body sixfold, rendering it invisible to humans and ghosts alike.

**Illustration of the Human Sovereign’s Seal**
Three *cun* in length, three *cun* in width.

**The True Form Talisman of the Human Sovereign**
Three *cun* in length, three *cun* in width.

**Chapter Nine: The Divine Incantation of the Human Sovereign**
The nine *qi* intermingle in misty fusion; the jade incantation follows. Lofty and wondrous, the celestial prison—supreme among the ten poles, divine sovereign of the Great Void, great lords of the eight heavens, Wood Father and Metal Mother, the supreme and mysterious perfected—each descends true *qi* to expel and annihilate the traces of evil.

The Vermilion Emperor of the South rides clouds upon a fire dragon.
The White Emperor of the West swiftly severs demonic miasma.
The Black Emperor of the North shines with rosy dawn’s divine radiance.
The Azure Emperor of the East commands the phoenix’s mighty cry.

The nine heavens’ nine spirits, the celestial soldiers of the Ghost Gate, the jade maidens of the direct talismans, the unbridled might of Tai Sui, the officers and soldiers of the Five Peaks, the celestial scholars of the capital bureau, the eight-eyed divine youths, the Northern Dipper’s stalwart pivot, the four-eyed elder *Xi*, the great slayer who devours demons, the forty stalwart warriors, the Six Ding and Six Jia—enter within my seal.

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances, obey and seize!*

**Chapter Ten: The Method of Knowing Life and Death and the Five Illusory Petitions**
**The Method of Knowing Death:**
Join palms but extend the fourth finger; when it opens, King Yama will surely know.

The formula states: On the seventh, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh days of each month—three times monthly—one may know the omens of life and death for ten days. Face east at sunrise, recite the Human Sovereign’s incantation once, and draw in three mouthfuls of the sun’s crystalline *qi*, swallowing them into the abdomen. Then sit upright facing east, aligning the celestial origin with the earthly essentials, and extend the fourth finger. If it does not open, this is an omen that the myriad spirits are intact and death has not come. If it suddenly opens, this signifies that heaven and humanity cannot save, the spirit and *qi* have departed the body—an omen of death. To determine the day of death, fix it according to the Five Phases’ day. If the day is Metal, death will come on the third day after the omen. For Wood, the fourth day; for Water, the fifth; for Earth, the seventh; for Fire, the ninth. Once the ghostly emissaries come to pursue, and the day of death is known, employ the Five Illusory Arts to feign life.

The Five Illusory Methods avert calamities from heavenly tribulations above and the exhaustion of great destiny below. If faced with the tribulation of heavenly waters—where the heavens tilt and the depths overflow, rivers and seas swell to emptiness, floods surge and spread, mountains and peaks vanish, the watery wheel revolves in all four directions, and yin essence emerges—leaving the world with no place to stand and the heavens with no void, vast and desolate, devoid of all people—one may use this method to feign and enter water without perceiving it. If one knows the tribulation of heaven and earth’s wind and fire—where flames congeal the void, raging flames race through the vast expanse, the empty and dark sea burns, mountains are blown away, the dark heavens above and the dark earth below vanish, and all the myriad existences turn to ash—one may use this method to feign and enter as if in tranquil meditation. If all is war, with battles raging on all sides, lands annexed, corpses piled like mountains, and blood flowing like seas, one may use this method to feign so that ordinary people cannot see one’s form, and one may wander the clouds unobstructed. If faced with the peril of the three limits, the calamity of emptiness and doom, the convergence of great and minor destinies, the mutual devouring of fetal fortune and official salary, or a fate that meets death, one may use this method to feign so that creation cannot alter it, yin and yang cannot shift it, ghosts and spirits cannot know it—and one may live to one hundred twenty years, becoming a person of long life.

**Wei Furén of the Southern Peak** continued: The vulgar of the dusty world, the unlearned, though they revere the Dao with sincere hearts and enter the famous mountains, do not recognize the numinous fungus when they encounter it and have no method when facing tigers and leopards. How is this different from throwing oneself into a place of death? Many who initially sought long life have instead met untimely demise. I pity these people and once petitioned the Celestial Emperor, who bestowed this scripture upon me. With the Five Talismans and True Registers, one may execute evil and behead monsters, restrain tigers and wolves, cause the myriad demons to hide their traces, and the hundred ghosts to flee their forms—enabling all who cultivate the true to attain the Dao of non-action. Naturally, the mountain forests are pure and still, the numinous fungus blooms with dew, gold and jade emerge, and refined *qi* suffuses the air. Some may consume the fungus and wear coarse cloth, dwell in truth and savor the Dao, refining the spirit to irrigate the human and divine—how could this not be peace?

**The Five Talismans’ True Texts:**
Choose the terrain when dwelling in the mountains. Mountains have nobility and baseness; *qi* has life and death. When desiring to reside, one must select the terrain. Where great mountains form, small mountains are noble; where small mountains form, great mountains are noble. Where rocky mountains form, earthen mountains are noble; where earthen mountains form, rocky mountains are noble. Among such mountains—great or small, earthen or rocky—those with many mountains paying homage are noble. Selecting such noble mountains, where the five fortunes of vital *qi* converge, one may dwell in secluded grottoes and abodes, nestle in cliffs and peaks, or thatch a hut and befriend cranes and deer. Those who reside here long may practice the arts of harmonious nurturing and attain long life. Why? Because their yang essence is robust and refined *qi* suffuses them.

**Discerning Grotto Abodes:**
What are called *grottoes*, *abodes*, *caverns*, *caves*, and *hollows*? Mountains facing east are called *grottoes*; those facing south, *abodes*; those facing southeast, *cliffs*; those facing southwest, *caverns*; those facing north, *hollows*; and those facing northeast, *pitfalls*. Those who dwell in grottoes, abodes, cliffs, and caverns naturally receive the descent and protection of lofty perfected immortals, transcendent scholars, and reclusive gentlemen, thereby attaining the mysterious and wondrous. Those who dwell in hollows and pitfalls will be pressed and violated by poisonous insects, fierce beasts, old demons, and mountain spirits—because these places all reverse the proper *qi* of heaven and earth.

**Verifying and Recognizing the Numinous Fungus:**
There are the cinnabar fungus, azure fungus, flesh fungus, purple fungus, golden fungus, immortal fungus, herbaceous fungus, orchid fungus, jade fungus, fruit fungus, crimson fungus, the fungus that sways without wind, the fungus that shines with divine light at night, the pristine and fragrant fungus, the fungus where grotto heavens and cranes cry, the numinous fungus, the jade-grain fungus, the cloud-dew pure fungus, the azure-jade white-stemmed fungus, the five-brightness nine-radiance fungus, the yang essence pristine medicine fungus, the Great One’s eight-wind fungus, the brocade-patterned purple-stemmed fungus, the light-containing jade-green fungus, and the azure cinnabar pristine blossom fungus.

The above twenty-four varieties of *lingzhi* fungi—each time one obtains a single specimen and consumes it, the partaker may attain a lifespan of a thousand years.

**Discerning the Upright and the Perverse**
Whenever dwelling in a hut, a mountain, or a grotto, one must discern the upright from the perverse. The method is already prepared within the hut—some may thereby ascend and be uplifted.

**Gathering the Fungus**
When gathering *lingzhi*, one should do so during the third month, the time when mountains open and the numinous fungus appears. Deploy the Five Talismans to unveil it, and it may naturally be obtained. Seek it on the proper day, with phoenix scripts and dragon seal-characters, and it may be found.

**Auspicious Omens of the Fungus**
Wherever the fungus resides, there are sure to be extraordinary signs: by day, five-colored clouds densely cover the area; by night, rosy light suffuses and coils around it. Or one may see qi phenomena rising and falling hundreds or thousands of feet high, resembling serpents.

**Wood-Dissolving Talisman**
On a *jiǎ* or *yǐ* day (first or second of the ten Heavenly Stems), inscribe this talisman in cinnabar on paper and burn it to ingest. Face east, and if the affliction is as severe as death, it will depart after one day. Take the patient’s headscarf or turban and place it outside, substituting a bamboo effigy in their stead. The person will have already fled far away to another land—do not turn back or harbor concerns.
