**On Dietary Suitability**

**Question from the Aspiring Immortal:** For those who cultivate and nourish themselves, what foods may they consume to sate hunger without causing harm?

**Response from the Perfected One:** Sour, salty, sweet, and bitter foods—each belongs to its proper season. Follow the sequence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; do not act contrary to the organs. Excess in consumption leads to illness, just as moderation in restraint yields boundless benefit. The harms of improper diet have already been expounded; the benefits of suitable nourishment shall now be explained to you. Do not neglect these teachings—take them to heart.

The *Eight Essentials* states:
- In spring, consume pungent foods, for pungency disperses.
- In summer, consume salty foods, for saltiness moistens.
- In late summer, consume sour foods, for sourness astringes.
- In autumn, consume bitter foods, for bitterness firms.
- In winter, consume sweet and rich foods, for sweetness harmonizes the center and promotes flesh, while richness seals the interstices and supplements the center.

All these benefit the five viscera and dispel pathogenic qi. These flavors of the four seasons, applied according to their suitability, nourish the organs, expel pathogens, and embody the Dao of nurturing life—unalterable in principle.

The *Rites*’ *Nei Ze* states: "In harmonizing flavors, spring favors sourness, summer favors bitterness, autumn favors pungency, and winter favors saltiness, tempered with smooth and sweet." The commentary explains: "Emphasize the flavors of the season to nourish their corresponding qi."

The classics say: "In spring, avoid sour foods; in summer, avoid bitter foods." For each of the four seasons, store the season’s flavors—this refers to the vigor of qi. Reduce the season’s flavors to subdue excess qi. The *Nei Ze*’s emphasis on seasonal flavors addresses the fear of qi deficiency and emaciation, thus augmenting the season’s flavors to nourish qi.

The *Nei Ze* further states:
- In spring, consume lamb, suckling pig, and the fat of *you* (ox fat). Spring corresponds to the flourishing of Wood. *Gao shi* (ox fat) pertains to the Earth phase of the central Ox. Wood restrains Earth; when Wood is abundant, Earth becomes dormant. Thus, the dormant fat is used to moderate qi, hence the use of ox fat.
- In summer, consume *ju* (dried pheasant), *xiu* (dried fish), and *zao* (dog fat). *Ju* is dried pheasant; *xiu* is dried fish; *zao* is dog fat. The Dog belongs to the Metal phase of the West. Summer belongs to the Fire phase of the South. Fire restrains Metal; when Fire is abundant, Metal becomes dormant. Thus, dog fat is used to moderate qi.
- In autumn, consume calf, *chen* (dust), and the fat of *xing* (goose fat). *Xing* is goose, which belongs to the Wood phase of the East. Autumn belongs to the Metal phase of the West. Metal restrains Wood; when Metal is abundant, Wood becomes dormant. Thus, goose fat is used.
- In winter, consume *xian yu* (fresh game) and the fat of *shan* (mutton). *Gao shan* (mutton fat) pertains to the Sheep, which belongs to the Fire phase of the South. Winter belongs to the Water phase of the North. Water restrains Fire; when Water is abundant, Fire becomes dormant. Thus, dormant mutton fat is used.

Zheng (Xuan) comments: "Lamb and suckling pig are plump at birth. Calf and *chen* are robust and full. *Ju* and *xiu* are dried by heat. Fish and wild geese settle when waters recede. These eight foods embody the qi of the four seasons and are especially suitable for human consumption. Thus, the dormant fats are used to harmonize and refine them."

Generally:
- Ox pairs well with millet,
- Sheep with glutinous millet,
- Pig with broomcorn millet,
- Dog with sorghum,
- Fish with melon—

for their qi and flavors complement one another.

The *Rites of Zhou*’s *Offices of Heaven* states:
- For grain-based meals (*shi qi*), observe spring’s warmth—rice should be warm.
- For broths (*geng qi*), observe summer’s heat—broths should be hot.
- For sauces (*jiang qi*), observe autumn’s coolness—sauces should be chilled.
- For beverages (*yin qi*), observe winter’s cold—drinks should be cold.

The *Great Essentials* states:
- The Liver is green; it benefits from sweetness. Polished rice, beef, and jujubes are sweet.
- The Heart is red; it benefits from sourness. Sesame, dog meat, and plums are sour.
- The Spleen is yellow; it benefits from saltiness. Soybeans, pork, and chestnuts are salty.
- The Lungs are white; they benefit from bitterness. Wheat, mutton, and apricots are bitter.
- The Kidneys are black; they benefit from pungency. Yellow millet, goose meat, and peaches are pungent.

For ailments of the:
- Liver, consume sesame, wheat, dog meat, plums, and leeks.
- Heart, consume wheat, mutton, apricots, and *qiu* (a type of vegetable).
- Spleen, consume polished rice, beef, jujubes, and mallow.
- Lungs, consume yellow millet, goose meat, peaches, and scallions.
- Kidneys, consume soybeans, yellow millet, pork, chestnuts, and *lei* (a type of vegetable).
