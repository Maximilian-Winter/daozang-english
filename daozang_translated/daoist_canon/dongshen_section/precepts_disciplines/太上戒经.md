**The Supreme Scripture of Precepts**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Scripture of Precepts*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. A compilation of six precept texts from the Shangqing, Lingbao, and Celestial Master traditions. One fascicle. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongshen Section, Precepts Category. Collated with *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel*, fascicle 38.

### **The Ten Precepts**

The *Origin Chapter of the Jade Purity Scripture* states: The Dao spoke, saying that in ancient times, the Primordial Celestial Worthy, together with countless sages and holy ones, traversed myriad realms. Finally, descending to observe the world of Abandoned Worthies, there was a king named Upright Virtue, sharp of root and discerning of wisdom, who served as a guide for all beings. He proclaimed throughout his kingdom to all ministers, subjects, men, and women: "Now we have attained great peace, the realm is at rest, fires and disasters have ceased, weapons are stilled, and the hundred grains ripen—all by the grace of the Dao, not by nature alone. How shall we repay this boundless kindness? Only by wholeheartedly revering and serving, erecting palaces and oratories, offering incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, performing morning and evening rites, observing fasts, and repenting transgressions to seek blessings and protection."

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy commanded the Immortal of Vast Spirit to address the king: "You are the ruler of a nation, esteemed by all under heaven, the noblest in the mortal realm. Yet if you govern with upright Dharma and do not oppress the people, this alone suffices to move heaven with merit—why seek esoteric mysteries? The Way of esoteric mysteries is difficult to attain at once, but its threshold lies in nothing other than compassion. The method of compassion does not transgress the precepts and prohibitions. Precepts vary in kind, as do people in their capacities.

The highest grade of persons commit no transgressions in body and thus have no need to uphold precepts. The middle grade of persons waver in mind, shifting with circumstances; they restrain themselves with precepts to prevent dissipation. Such persons may receive the Ten Precepts or the Five Precepts for self-protection. The lowest grade of persons harbor myriad evil intentions, difficult to restrain. Among them, there are two further grades: the higher of these, though desiring to uphold precepts, may receive the One Hundred Ninety-Nine Precepts, the Three Hundred Great Precepts of Observing the Body, or the One Thousand Two Hundred Precepts of Dignified Conduct to guard themselves and prevent transgressions. The lowest of these are like beasts in body, possessing human form but lacking human hearts. Even if they receive precepts, it will be of no benefit.

Now, receive the second, middle-grade precepts: ten prohibitions. At the gateway to the Dao, all who heard this teaching rejoiced, clapping and prostrating themselves to receive the precepts.

The Celestial Worthy declared:

1. **First Precept:** Do not defy or disobey parents or teachers; do not commit rebellion or filial impiety.
2. **Second Precept:** Do not kill or slaughter beings, nor sever the lives of creatures.
3. **Third Precept:** Do not betray the sovereign or plot harm against family and state.
4. **Fourth Precept:** Do not commit incest with kin, aunts, sisters, or other women.
5. **Fifth Precept:** Do not slander the Dao and its teachings or recklessly divulge scriptures.
6. **Sixth Precept:** Do not defile pure altars or expose the body while wearing single garments.
7. **Seventh Precept:** Do not bully the orphaned and poor or seize others’ property.
8. **Eighth Precept:** Do not expose the Three Luminaries (sun, moon, stars) or despise the aged and infirm.
9. **Ninth Precept:** Do not indulge in wine or follow reckless impulses, nor engage in double-tongued or malicious speech.
10. **Tenth Precept:** Do not act with violence or arrogance, nor presume authority and power for oneself.

These Ten Precepts are to be upheld throughout one’s life.

### **The Great Precepts of the Highest Grade, with Preface**

The *Scripture of the Highest Grade* states: The Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate, while in secluded cultivation on Mount Tiantai, bowed his head in reverence and inquired of the Great Ultimate Dharma Master Xu Laile: "Your disciple is fortunate to attend the Celestial Worthy and, since hearing these subtle words, has encompassed kalpas without end, penetrating the source of the Dao. The joy of surpassing abundance cannot be expressed. I have long cherished the divine immortals and the Way of ascending in broad daylight, ever yearning for the highest sages. Yet the great scriptures are profound and distant, their mysteries difficult to fathom. I wish to receive oral instructions to dispel my dark ignorance, thoroughly illuminating the empty and vast, where being and non-being are entirely exhausted.

Recently, I have not yet fully understood the karmic causes of past lives or the origins of one’s original conduct. Now, I beseech the Celestial Worthy to enlighten what I have not yet awakened to."

At that time, the Supreme Mysterious and Lofty Perfected, chanting the *Void-Penetrating Hymn* and pacing the void, joyfully radiant, spoke with a countenance like golden splendor: "You, through kalpas of devotion to the Dao, have attained the jade name of the Great Ultimate, dwelling among the wise. You shall ascend alone to the Jade Capital, transcending the Three Realms—how majestic is the task of the Supreme Perfected! Thus, you extend compassion to heaven and humanity, mindful of guiding later learners. Constantly using your own body to aid others, you possess virtue yet do not claim it. What is expounded in the Mysterious Metropolis is surely not in vain."

Then he addressed the Great Ultimate Perfected: "You have received the teachings of the Supreme Void Sovereign Dao Lord and serve as his preceptor. You must fully impart the profound and abstruse mysteries of the Highest Great Cavern—why wait for further elaboration? I, unworthy, have been entrusted as the Dharma Master of the Teaching Assembly, and the handling of the scriptures now rests with you."

The Great Ultimate Perfected replied: "This youthful perfected one, whose name is inscribed on the golden tablets, possesses a nature pure and distant, his spirit luminous and refined. The Supreme Mysterious and Subtle Void-Penetrating [Dao] has destined him for the role of Supreme Perfected, a great propagator of the Dao. Though I, unworthy, have received the mandate to teach, I am ashamed to be his master. Yet since the Supreme One has commanded, how dare I not fully respond?"

The governance of all mysteries now depends upon you, Dharma Master.

The Great Ultimate Perfected further said: "The Dao is Non-Being. It pervades the boundless, yet should you seek it, it lies near within your own body—thus it is also Being. Through Being one enters Non-Being; through accumulated thought one attains the wondrous. The myriad things, teeming like illusions, must all return to emptiness, and the human body is no exception. When the body dies, the spirit departs—compare it to a house: when the house collapses, the person cannot stand; when the body decays, the spirit cannot dwell. One must restrain thoughts to stabilize the will, calm the body to settle the spirit, treasure qi to preserve essence, and forget both deliberation and care. Through inner vision in profound meditation, body and spirit become one. When body and spirit become one, one approaches the true body. This truly arises from the fundamental conduct of past lives, from accumulated thought and repeated resonance, from merit that aids all beings, and from virtue that responds to the myriad things.

Yet through the turning of karmic conditions, sin and blessing stand in opposition, life and death alternate, noble and base employ one another, worthy and foolish vie, poor and rich deceive, good and evil manifest—suffering is measureless. All these are the results of one’s own actions and vows, not of the Dao, nor of heaven, nor of earth, nor of other people, but of the myriad things themselves. It is precisely the heart that brings them forth. Once such karmic oppositions are forged, they are difficult to escape. Among the weak and lost, few believe in the Dao; most are bound by past karma. Without accumulating goodness and stabilizing thought, without cultivating virtue and ordering the body, one who would rashly abandon virtue and forget the body, forcibly seeking external things—how could such a one succeed? Having already failed, none escape harm to the body.

Thus the man of the Dao draws from his own being and seeks nothing from others. The Dao speaks of cultivating the body so that one’s virtue becomes true—this is what it means. One who studies the Dao yet does not receive the Great Wisdom, the Primordial Vow, and the Upper Grade Precepts of the Dao Conduct will have no cause to ascend as an Upper Immortal. You possess past-life karmic affinity, which is why you behold this scripture. Its words are recondite and esoteric; first establish faith and verify the heart, then transmit it. Do not recklessly display it. Those who disbelieve will generate aberrant thoughts, and once such thoughts arise, both parties incur transgression. Therefore, conceal it in the realm of the Unconditioned. Only when one is destined to become a Perfected King of Immortals should it be revealed."

At that moment, clouds and dragons leapt and danced, the heavens scattered blossoms, flying incense and curling smoke filled the air, mountains and seas stilled their waves, all creatures fell silent, ghosts and demons vanished, spirits and demons submitted, the Five Sufferings were all dissolved, and those long bound in hell were forever freed. The wicked turned to goodness, and the faithful and obedient received blessings. Then the Great Ultimate commanded the Scripture-Attending Immortal Liu Wenzheng to unroll the cloud-scroll and bestow the scripture.

The Great Ultimate Perfected said: "In past lives, one reverently served scripture masters, recited with the mouth and practiced with the body, gave alms to those in distress, took joy in the Three Treasures, was loyal to ruler and filial to parents, retreated to mountains and rivers, lodged with the worthy and learned, maintained an empty heart and followed the Dao, burned incense and scattered blossoms, protected and delivered all beings, cultivated the Dao and amended faults, believed in and submitted to past karma, and calmly contemplated while restraining the passions. Such conduct, in its highest expression, can ascend as an immortal and deliver the world; in its lowest, it can bring about wealth and nobility, birth as a person of honor, a majestic and refined appearance, and a nature of clear and distant wisdom. In the Way of being human, nothing will be lacking.

Those who in the world enjoyed wealth and nobility while mocking the poor and lowly are now repaid with poverty and lowliness. Those who in the world delighted in killing are now repaid with injury and death. Those who in the world treated others with contempt and mocked the ugly are now repaid with ugliness. Those who in the world were clever yet did not teach others are now repaid with dullness and obstruction. Those who in the world were always healthy and mocked the sick and afflicted are now repaid with chronic illness. Those who in the world did not believe in spiritual communication and mocked the scriptures and teachings are now repaid with utter stupidity, forever cut off from the Dao.

Women who in the world stole others’ husbands are now repaid with early widowhood. Men who in the world seduced others’ wives are now repaid with lifelong solitude. Those who in the world pledged their hearts to become husband and wife yet in later lives do not both attain human birth, dying as ghosts and demons, are now repaid according to their original intentions, falling into perverse illnesses. Without the Great Dharma, none can untangle their karmic bonds and dispel these perverse illnesses.

For parents, siblings, sisters, husbands and wives, rulers and ministers, teachers and guardians, friends—all are bound by the vows and thoughts of past lives, arising through karmic conditions in endless cycles. Is there none who does not have such karmic oppositions? Thus it is said: 'Dependence and latency are inexhaustible.' Only the student of the Dao of Immortality should utterly forget karmic conditions, extinguish life and death, and together return to the Mysterious, entering the wondrous gate. One who knows this may begin to speak of the foundation of studying the Dao.

When you see the noble, wish that all may receive their teachings and decrees, all becoming models of instruction. When you see the lowly, wish that all may diligently cultivate without negligence, each attaining their aspirations. When you see the emperor, wish that all may revere and look up to the kingly Way, being as filial as to parents. When you see ministers and chancellors, wish that all may receive their teachings and governance, so that the four directions return to benevolence.

When you see city walls, wish that all may be strictly ordered and adorned, with the Dao/Way as their foundation. When you see great states, wish that all may return to the ancestral and admire virtue, like waters flowing to the sea. When you see small states, wish that all may know restraint and emptiness, content in their abodes. When you see markets and courts, wish that all the multitudes of worthies may gather like clouds, all propagating the true Dao/Way. When you see quiet contemplation, wish that all may accumulate towering merit and virtue, celestial and human attaining the Dao/Way. When you see fasting, precepts, and incense offerings, wish that all may daily renew their virtue and power, with schools and academies refined and upright.

When you see sutra recitation, wish that all may ascend to the high seat, universally hearing the sagely voice. When you see scriptural teachings, wish that all may each receive, read, venerate, and practice them, universally propagating transformation. When you see towers and observatories, wish that all may penetrate and observe the ten directions, with nothing concealed. When you see lofty mountains, wish that all may possess boundless wisdom and thought, aiding in the completion of families and states.

When you see divine winds, wish that all may unfold their hidden treasures, virtue flowing far and near. When you see contending for water, wish that all may wash away filth and attain clarity, equalizing their hearts.

When you see fine incense, wish that all may receive its compassionate fragrance, all impurities solemnly stilled. When you see beautiful flowers, wish that all may delight in scattering them before the sages, their marks of excellence complete. When you see carriages and horses, wish that all may attain the Dao/Way in non-action, riding phoenixes and driving dragons.

In the sitting and reclining of Daoists, may we always wish that our four great elements harmonize with virtue, our bodies united with the true Dao/Way, eternally abiding in the Mysterious Capital, with masters and friends naturally present, delivering the ten directions, the world receiving grace, carefree in non-action, penetrating the wondrous gates.

**Three Invocations for Venerating the Scriptures**

The oral instructions of perfected persons say: When the jade maidens and immortal youths who attend the scriptures hear these invocations, they rejoice and protect the practitioner’s body. All great scriptures employ these invocations in worship. Those who venerate the scriptures in profound contemplation should also silently recite these words—this is the secret invocation of the highest immortals.

**First Invocation**
Delighting in the Dharma as one’s wife,
Cherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.
Upholding precepts to restrain the six emotions,
Contemplating the Dao/Way to dispel desires.
Serene and unadorned, the upright qi abides,
Detached, the spirit still and silent.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
Lifetimes of great blessings received.

**Second Invocation**
Flourishing are families and states,
Prosperous are the scriptures and Dao/Way.
Celestials and humans share this aspiration,
Subtly entering the Great Vehicle.
Establishing fields of blessing through the mind,
Gradually ascending through the Dharma.
Seven generations of ancestors born in heaven,
My body ascending in broad daylight.

**Third Invocation**
The Great Dao/Way pervades the mysterious void,
With mindfulness, nothing fails to accord.
Refining the body to enter the immortal true,
Thus attaining a vajra body.
Transcending the Three Realms’ difficulties,
The five hells’ sufferings dissolved.
All return to the Supreme Scriptures,
In tranquil contemplation, bowing in reverence.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: To study the Dao/Way of ascending as immortals, one must establish one thousand two hundred acts of goodness, never receiving retribution. Establishing three thousand acts of merit results in ascending to heaven in broad daylight—all involve delivering people from mortal perils. Bestowing kindness upon others is especially virtuous! In studying the Dao/Way, one should align all actions with the Dharma, broadly establishing fields of blessing, arousing a heart of great compassion, and constantly awakening the intention of the Dao/Way in movement and stillness.

If one can thus practice—refining breath through ingestion and exhalation, consuming elixirs, wearing talismans, reciting scriptures with diligence, and never growing weary throughout life—how could one fail to attain immortality? Those devoid of such virtue, though they consume elixirs, wear talismans, recite scriptures, and observe fasts, will ultimately meet their destined end without verification.

Scholars, ponder these essential words.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: Establishing three hundred acts of goodness grants one the attainment of earthbound immortality. Should even one act remain incomplete, one must begin anew, and all prior merit is forfeit. Only when such resolve is steadfast in mind and marrow does it hold true. Guiding others to perform good deeds likewise constitutes virtuous merit.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: Constantly chanting the *Dongjing* in recitation, cultivating great compassion, placing others before oneself, extolling goodness and transforming evil, severing all karmic entanglements, extinguishing thoughts and guarding emptiness—when the heart mirrors the Supreme Mystery and the Dao/Way is sought therein, only then may one be called capable of discoursing on the path of divine transcendence.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: I received from the Highest Great Dao of the Primordial Void the *Ten Virtues of Exhortation and Merit* of the Supreme Wisdom of the Great Ultimate, a teaching revered and practiced across lifetimes. Delivering others is effortless—this is the natural blessing of the Dao/Way. The Supreme Venerable One universally instructs heaven and humanity, allowing each to fulfill their original vow, first entering the Dharma gate to abide in non-action, free from the ten sufferings, eight adversities, and karmic retribution. Hell is dissolved, the Three Bureaus pacified, daily tranquility secured, and lifetimes of glory and joy attained. All escape the snares of fate, future rebirths are serene, and the celestial nature remains undisturbed. Desires follow their course, and those who uphold these precepts as above may transmit them to the worthy and faithful.

The *Ten Exhortations of Virtue* state:
1. Exhort and assist in revering the Three Treasures, making offerings to Dharma masters, so that in this life one becomes a noble person—virtuous, filial, and of lofty talent, honored and esteemed, respected by all, with a flourishing lineage.
   The Three Treasures are the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters. Those who nurture life, teach goodness, and serve as models for others are called Dharma masters.

2. Exhort and assist in transcribing scriptures, so that in future lives one becomes wise and learned, with profound insight, ever encountering sagely eras, witnessing all scriptural teachings, and reciting their verses.

3. Exhort and assist in establishing fasts and rituals, so that in future lives one’s family attains high nobility, the body ascends to heaven, sustenance is natural, and one dwells perpetually in non-action.

4. Exhort and assist in offering incense, oil, and various supplies, so that in future lives one’s fragrance endures, purity and radiance abound, and one’s countenance is peerless, with celestial grace and lofty refinement.

5. Exhort and assist in providing Dharma masters with robes, so that in future lives one becomes refined and at ease, dwelling in the Central Kingdom, never falling to borderlands or barbaric realms, with sons and daughters of upright bearing, adorned in crowns, jade pendants, and fitting attire.

6. Exhort and assist kings, parents, and the people in loyalty and filial piety, so that in future lives one has many descendants, sons and daughters of wisdom and virtue, free from all suffering.

7. Exhort and assist in fasting, purification, and scripture recitation, so that in future lives one avoids hell and ascends to heaven, paying homage to all sages, swiftly regaining a transformed body and rebirth in a royal household, with every desire fulfilled, pleasures in abundance, and seven generations of ancestors rejoicing together. All karmic conditions are perfected, and from beginning to end, glory and joy in the Dao/Way persist, ultimately leading to the attainment of immortality.

8. Exhort and assist others in studying scriptures, so that in future lives one’s wisdom and intelligence are penetrating, conduct and demeanor dignified, and one constantly serves as a teacher to others.

9. Exhort and assist in all acts of generosity, admonishing and encouraging good deeds, so that in future lives one enjoys longevity, wealth, and happiness, free from resentment and vexation.

10. Exhort and assist all people in relinquishing jealousy and desire, practicing myriad virtues, so that in future lives one abides in peace and joy, free from calamity and disorder. The sick recover, officials rise in rank, and all look up to one with reverence. Every endeavor is auspicious, the household pure and noble, cherished by heaven and humanity, protected by spirits and demons, and one is forever born in blessed realms.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: Of all human evils, none surpass jealousy, killing, greed, extravagance, arrogance, and licentiousness. If even one of these resides in the heart, it severs one’s lifespan. To cling to such while seeking divine transcendence—is this not lamentable?

From the *Tai Xiao Lang Shu*: When the ten virtues are practiced, the ten evils naturally cease. Ceasing evil and practicing goodness perfects the virtue of great compassion. Thus, the highest precepts state: Relieve the dead and deliver the living, heal the sick and cure diseases, bestow kindness upon the destitute, sacrifice oneself to aid others, serve one’s masters with devotion, construct tranquil abodes, transcribe and collate scriptures, cultivate fasts and recite the Dao/Way, yield to others and relinquish righteousness, avoid contending for merit and fame, enlighten the ignorant, admonish and dissolve evil, dig wells along roadsides, plant orchards and groves, educate the young, exhort others to perform good deeds, ensure one’s conduct is exemplary, movements and stillness are admirable, teachings and systems are sound, and actions are consistently thus. Practicing the ten virtues universally is called a Daoist. Without cultivating virtuous merit, one labors in vain in the mountains and forests. Those who trust these principles should diligently seek all precepts. The precept sections are vast, and one should follow what is accessible. Countless precepts and boundless regulations all assist the singular spirit, governing the three karmas.

The three karmas are body, mouth, and mind. All actions and creations—good and evil—are measureless. Of the measureless good and evil, ten are the roots of evil:
1. False speech.
2. Frivolous speech.
3. Divisive speech.
4. Abusive speech.
   These four are evils of the mouth; reversing them yields goodness.
5. Covetousness.
6. Theft.
7. Licentiousness.
   These three pertain to the body.
8. Jealousy.
9. Resentment.
10. Delusion.
   These three pertain to the mind. The karma of the mind is the heaviest, serving as the root of the ten evils. Sever the ten evils and cultivate the roots of the ten virtues: speak truthfully and directly, communicate harmoniously, recite with clarity, yield and relinquish wealth, maintain inner and outer chastity, rejoice in praise, fear and delight in reverence, and honor the Three Honored Ones. With these ten virtues complete, the ten evils are forever eradicated.

From the *Sutra on Stabilizing the Mind and Resolving Will*, the Ten Precepts:
1. Do not kill; contemplate the lives of all beings.
2. Do not commit adultery or violate the wives of others.

3. Do not steal; take no wealth that is not rightfully yours.
4. Do not deceive; do not reverse discussions of good and evil.
5. Do not become intoxicated; constantly contemplate pure conduct.
6. Maintain harmony among clan and kin, with no distinction between close and distant.
7. Upon seeing others do good deeds, rejoice in your heart and assist them.
8. Upon seeing others in distress, aid them in performing meritorious acts.
9. When others harm you, resolve not to seek repayment.
10. For all who have not yet attained the Dao, do not hold expectations toward them.

The sutra states: There were once twelve youths in the world who delighted in pleasure. Daily, they gathered together to prepare fine food, drinking to intoxication and playing games, or else discussing the difficulty of upholding the precepts. The Heavenly Worthy, with the Dao-eye, saw from afar that in their past lives they had been teachers who, though hoarding scriptures and instructing disciples, remained hesitant in their commitment to the Dao. For this slight reason, they were still salvageable. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy transformed into an ordinary person and passed through their gathering, pretending to beg for food. Engaging them in conversation, he resumed the earlier discussion.

One of them said: “I have often followed my elder brother to Mount Anle, where I saw many Daoists strictly observing the Ten Precepts. Their demeanor was most solemn and admirable. Even at death, their souls and spirits would not be in vain. Yet, though the Ten Precepts exist, it is difficult for people to fully uphold them.”

The transformed one replied: “Upholding them is quite easy; violating them is exceedingly difficult.”

The youths asked: “How is upholding the precepts easy, while not upholding them is difficult?”

The transformed one said: “To establish oneself in accordance with the precepts is to fear neither the Son of Heaven nor ghosts and spirits—how can this be called difficult? Those who violate the precepts fear all things—this is truly difficult.”

One of them said: “I could uphold the other precepts, but abstaining from alcohol is hard. Why? I previously took elixir powders, and on the day their effects manifest, only wine can relieve them. That is why it is difficult.”

The transformed one said: “The effects of elixir powders require this—it is medicine. To nurture the four great elements, medicine may be taken, but do not exceed the proper measure.”

Another said: “I could manage other matters, but false speech is difficult. Why? If there is a private matter before one’s elders, it should be concealed out of respect. Yet if questioned, one cannot lie, for lying violates the precepts. This is why it is difficult.”

The transformed one said: “There are matters that should be concealed, and principles that allow for flexibility. This too can be managed, but do not reverse discussions of good and evil or speak of others’ faults.”

Another said: “I could uphold the other precepts, but the prohibition against theft is difficult. Even in minor matters, one may inadvertently transgress.”

The transformed one said: “Great theft is indeed difficult, but even in minor matters, one must be cautious.” Then he spoke a verse:

*Why not receive the precept against theft?*
*Not receiving it is also difficult.*
*Who says in darkness there is no record?*
*There stands the official who records theft.*
*Take one, and it doubles year by year,*
*Each doubling brings no leniency.*
*With hands you hold molten bronze,*
*Burning your mouth, scorching heart and liver.*
*Once you speak of this suffering,*
*For years your heart will still ache.*
*Why not receive this precept,*
*And preserve it whole and complete?*
*I trust, and so do they,*
*Everywhere, all is secure.*
*Sit in peace and summon the immortal,*
*Forever enjoying boundless joy.*

Another said: “I could uphold the other precepts, but abstaining from licentiousness is most difficult. Why? I have experienced this myself. Often, when dining with my elder brother, he would say during the meal that he was practicing strict asceticism, never transgressing reason, and that after death, he would gain the blessings of these precepts and fasts. Yet that very night, the object of my desire would come, cunning and enticing. Though I struggled to restrain myself, I would unknowingly succumb. This happened repeatedly—thus I know it is most difficult.”

The transformed one said: “Desire is but a delusion; all delusions are empty. Where is there true desire? First observe your own body and know that it has no abiding place. Then you will understand there is no desire—how can you not endure? Moreover, indulgence in lust is like drinking saltwater: the more you drink, the thirstier you become, until only death remains. Where is there satisfaction?” Then he spoke a verse:

*Desire is more severe than thirst.*
*With a little restraint, how can you not cross over?*
*Why drink saltwater,*
*Which only increases thirst?*
*If you can truly quench thirst,*
*Drink the sweet dew of heaven.*
*Sweet dew is fragrant and rich,*
*Flowing through your entire body.*
*Heavenly beings follow the scent and descend,*
*And you will naturally awaken to the profound.*
*Joyful and free, forever without striving,*
*You will long preserve the blessings of the Nine Heavens.*

Another said: “I could uphold the rest, but abstaining from killing is difficult. Why? I enjoy eating chicken. A meal without chicken is utterly tasteless, and after several days, I grow thin.”

The transformed one said: “Wise one, fatness is a burden to the body, while thinness lightens it. What use is fatness?” Then he spoke a verse:

*Wise one, abstain from killing,*
*And harbor no thought of killing.*
*Though beings are small,*
*All delight in living and growing.*
*How can you harm their lives*
*To nourish yourself?*
*This nourishment lasts but a moment,*
*Yet it burdens you with natural clarity.*
*You will long sink in the Three Realms,*
*Enduring suffering again and again.*
*Good and evil each have their causes,*
*Like an echo following a call.*
*Why not change this conduct*
*And reward yourself with a compassionate heart?*
*True persons will take your hand*
*And wander carefree above the clouds.*

After speaking this verse, the transformed one revealed his majestic form, assuming the full appearance of the Dao. His attendants and retinue, the grand music of the heavens—indescribable to the eye—returned to the upper realms. The youths all witnessed this, their joy and awe mingling. Having heard the essential teachings, their minds opened in awakening, and together they ascended to the fruition of the Dao.

From the *Sutra of the Wondrous Grove*, the Twenty-Seven Precepts:
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies: “All sentient beings cling to conditioned existence, rejoicing in life and fearing death. Though they seek life, they create the karma of death. Not upholding the precepts, even if they live long, they are like old trees—what difference is there? If they uphold the precepts, at death they will fill the heavenly offices and ascend as immortals, free and at ease.”

Though one may hold the rank of duke or minister, or even ascend to the throne as emperor, at death all bear grave transgressions. This brings no benefit to the soul, and the suffering endured is unbearable. Good sons, reflect deeply: uphold the precepts with clarity and walk the Dao with a straight heart. I shall tell you—among all things under heaven, none endure forever. There is death and life, success and failure; the sun rises and sets, the moon waxes and wanes. From ancient times to the present, who can defy this turning? Only those who embody the Dao are beyond birth and extinction.

Those who cultivate goodness are good this month, good this day, good this very moment. As goodness and virtue accumulate, all practices reach fulfillment, and wholesome thoughts are upheld, guiding one into the treasury of the Dharma.
