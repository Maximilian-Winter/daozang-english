**The Scripture of the Venerable Lord’s Chanted Admonitions**

**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of the Venerable Lord’s Chanted Admonitions*. Also known as *The Admonitions of the New Scale Chanted in the Clouds*.

In the second year of Shenduan during the Northern Wei dynasty, the Daoist Kou Qianzhi of Mount Song falsely claimed to have received this scripture through a revelation from the Most High Venerable Lord. According to the *Wei Shu: Treatise on Buddhism and Daoism*, the original text comprised twenty scrolls, of which only one remains. The present edition is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the category of Precepts and Disciplines in the *Dongshen* section.

The Venerable Lord spoke:
The Way that is vexed does not arrive; the Way that arrives is not vexed. Follow this in cultivation, and all Daoist officials, male and female disciples, upon hearing my chanted precepts and statutes, shall awaken in their hearts. Gather the people and fellow practitioners, inscribe my admonitions and statutes into a single document, and present it in memorial to receive the precepts. Be diligent and cautious in upholding them as decreed.

The Venerable Lord spoke:
When Daoist officials and registered disciples first receive the precepts and statutes, they shall bow eight times toward the scripture of admonitions, stand upright before it, and—whether master or companion—hold the scripture to perform the Eightfold Offering of Music. Those who chant and receive the precepts shall prostrate themselves, recite the scripture’s meaning to its conclusion, and then bow eight times to conclude. If one does not understand the chanted recitation, a straightforward reading shall suffice. The precepts and statutes are to be mutually affirmed by two parties. Always maintain reverence and care. When transmitting them to fellow practitioners or disciples, follow the proper method and uphold them diligently as decreed.

The Venerable Lord spoke:
Daoist officials and registered disciples must not copy scriptures or precepts carelessly. To add or omit even a single character is forbidden; such errors may not be excerpted. If one transcribes the precepts onto two or three sheets without including the opening section, rendering the statutes incomplete, calamity shall befall the transgressor. These statutes and admonitions shall be overseen by officials of canonical affairs, who shall supervise their observance in accordance with the scripture’s precepts. Be diligent and cautious in upholding them as decreed.

The Venerable Lord spoke:
In the first year of Han’an, I transmitted the Dao to Zhang Ling, establishing him as the Celestial Master to assist the state and sustain the mandate. Ling, seeing the hardships of the world, deemed it unfit for a thousand-year lord and begged to ascend to heaven. I then urged Ling to refine his resolve, bestowed upon him the elixir of ascension, and the hundred-times-distilled wine. Thus, Ling ascended upon clouds, entering the celestial palace. Since Ling’s ascension, the office of the Celestial Master has been vacant for too long. I commanded the true officials of all prefectures, commanderies, and counties to govern ghostly affairs with their infused *qi*, register the households of the living, and cease employing living persons as Libationers to govern the people—a method that has led to corruption and disorder.

Yet later Daoist officials and Libationers, ignorant and blindly transmitting the teachings, have falsely assumed the authority to administer registers and talismans, distorting scriptural methods and polluting the pure and true. They claim there are three hundred and sixty talismanic decrees enabling immortality, conjuring myriad spirits to confuse the people. They confer ranks and registers upon others in exchange for gold, silver, and wealth, and govern households with threats and coercion, compelling offerings of silk, cattle, slaves, clothing, or annual tributes of a bolt of silk or an ounce of silk floss. The abuses are too numerous to recount.

They falsely propagate the Yellow and Red Chamber arts transmitted by Zhang Ling, teaching them to husbands and wives, spreading licentious practices that disgrace the Daoist teachings. Some Libationer officials claim that upon a father’s death, the son inherits his position, further corrupting the Dao. Yet the truth is: the Dao is revered and virtue is noble; only the worthy are to be entrusted. If a son is unworthy, how can he inherit his father’s legacy? Some Libationer officials, their sons unworthy, act perversely, defying principles and disordering the Dao—how can they rightfully inherit the lineage? The opening of the iron charter states, “Upon the father’s death, the son succeeds”—this is merely the law of secular rulers. I have not yet established a Celestial Master on earth, yet Daoist officials, blindly transmitting the teachings, have presumptuously assumed the authority to administer registers. All Daoist officials and Libationers must select the worthy and enlightened for transmission. Cease the practice of sons inheriting their fathers’ positions, lest the Daoist teachings remain obscure. I declare: even if I were to die, my descendants would not inherit the position of Celestial Master after me. The Way of Heaven is impartial; only the worthy are entrusted. Be diligent and cautious in upholding this as decreed.

The Venerable Lord spoke:
I received a memorial from the assembled immortals and officials presiding over the sacred land of Mount Song, stating: “The people of the world have long been without proper governance. Those who cultivate goodness and seek blessings through precepts follow fraudulent and deceptive scriptures, their practices yielding no results. They long for the teachings of a true and worthy orthodox method. It is fitting to establish the position of Celestial Master on earth as a model.”

Now there is Kou Qianzhi of Shanggu, who has secluded himself to study on Mount Song’s Shaoshi Peak. He has refined the teachings, grasped the nature of humans and spirits, embodied the principles in his conduct, and aligned his actions with spontaneity—though not yet worthy of the Celestial Master’s position. Thus, I journeyed east to observe him in person. Do you know this? My destined time has not yet come; I should not have appeared in the world. Qianzhi, you shall assume the position of Celestial Master, teach the people, assist the state, sustain the mandate, and diligently govern the Daoist methods. Sever all ties to the Yellow and Red practices. As for the various officials and Libationers who examine registers and talismans, extort gold, silver, and wealth, and demand miscellaneous offerings and vows—all such abuses shall be prohibited. Follow only my new method of chanting and reciting the precepts. The fraudulent scriptures and statutes shall no longer be observed.

Qianzhi received the precepts and, after two nights and three days, delved into the hidden depths of the matter. The Venerable Lord summoned him, and Qianzhi addressed him: “I am benighted and unworthy, lacking the wisdom to advance. Without the elixir of long life or the power to command spirits, how can I transform evil into good, dispel disasters, and subdue anomalies to serve as a model? I humbly beseech your compassion, grant me life, and await the time of your manifestation in the world. Only when the divine elixir responds and the *qi* of the Dao enters my body shall I dare to assume the position of Celestial Master. I record my earnest plea.”

The Venerable Lord spoke:
“I appoint you to govern the inner and outer offices of the celestial bureaucracy, presiding over the true duties, equal in rank to the Celestial Master.”

I permit you to voice your modest refusal once more.

This teaching of mine through joyous sound is true and sincere. Since the single correct transformation of Heaven and Earth, it has not been revealed to the world. Now, as the cyclical destiny demands its emergence, you must diligently instruct and establish the precepts and statutes, guiding both the ordained and the laity, and the *jijiu* shall implement them accordingly. After they uphold and submit to these sincere covenants, I shall command the true officials of the lands within the Nine Provinces and the Four Seas to ascend the registers and report the households.

Those *jijiu* and Daoist followers who uphold the law with merit shall then be selected among the seed people of the Central Realm, their names recorded in the Hall of Literary Prosperity. If any Daoist officials or *jijiu* are remiss in teaching and transformation, neglecting the arts of nurturing life, and encounter uncertainties they cannot resolve, you shall decide for them, clarifying the proper observance to be followed as decreed.

The Most High Lord Lao’s Decree of Joyous Sound and Sincere Instruction states:

In this present age, evildoers abound: fathers lack compassion, children lack filial piety, ministers lack loyalty. The cyclical destiny ordains that pestilence and poison shall descend upon them, and the wicked shall perish utterly. Thus, I withdrew far away to the Kunlun Mountains. In the world below, the wicked prey upon one another, and the dead are countless. Among them, the innocent and virtuous suffer unjustly, and I pity their hardship. From time to time, I cross eastward to shelter the good.

The true spirits of the lands within the Nine Provinces and the Four Seas, along with the officials of the Five Peaks, have all assembled to report on the virtues and deviations of their domains, recounting the facts. They declare that in this age, people commit deeds that lead to death, while those who cultivate goodness are few. Deceit and falsehood pervade the world, distorting the classics and the Dao, deluding the foolish masses. They claim that Lord Lao shall govern, that Li Hong shall appear, and that the realm shall be thrown into chaos, with rebels abounding. Every year, some claim the name Li Hong, and among them, spirits and ghosts manifest in broad daylight, deceiving the people with their spectral words. The foolish believe them, spreading countless lies, assuming titles and ranks, gathering crowds like ants, and disrupting the lands. Those who call themselves Liu Ju are many, and those who claim to be Li Hong are no fewer. I am enraged! How can there be so many who invoke my name for such evil? How can the people of this world be so foolish and deluded?

My abode is on Kunlun Mountain, where terraces, pavilions, towers, halls, and palaces stand in succession. Treasures of gold and silver, myriad fragrant woods, and intricate adornments fill the place. Orchids and cassia trees grow there, and rare beasts roam freely. Phoenixes and flocks of birds nest in the trees, while divine dragons and qilin serve as my livestock. Immortals and jade maidens gather there in abundance. When I wish to travel, I ride clouds and mount dragons, traversing ten thousand *li* in a breath. The people of Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits, are all subject to my command. Why would I desire to be the ruler of a single city on earth? I have no such wish!

When the time comes for my manifestation, I shall transform Heaven and Earth, abolishing the old classics and ancient laws, and establish a new order. Those destined for long life shall be granted the divine elixir, ascending as immortals to transcend the world and remain by my side. The wicked who turn to goodness and encounter me shall all have their years extended. If kings and emperors govern the people with merit, they shall continue to rule as before. If they govern unlawfully, the enlightened shall replace them. After the people are pacified and order is restored, they shall ascend to dwell on Kunlun.

When I emerge, I shall ride a chariot drawn by nine dragons, each adorned with multicolored, coin-spotted patterns. The chariot shall bear a feathered canopy with twelve projections, crafted from sandalwood and catalpa, embellished with gold, silver, pearls, and jade, along with rare and wondrous ornaments too numerous to name. I shall summon the true officials of the world, the wind and rain masters of the seas and mountains, and command the myriad ghosts. I shall overturn the celestial net, contract the earth’s veins, and turn Heaven and Earth as easily as I turn my own body. I shall grasp the sun and moon, causing the world to darken by day. Immortals and jade maidens shall ride in carriages beside me, while bells, drums, and music fill the void. The true disciples and beasts, phoenixes and flocks of birds, shall soar above. Heaven and Earth shall move, and the hosts of people and ghostly soldiers shall stretch boundlessly. All who behold my majestic radiance shall prostrate themselves before me!

Yet the foolish deceive without end, each desiring to rebel, gathering fugitives, criminals, slaves, and servants, falsely claiming to be Li Hong. How could I, in my true form, descend into this foul, carnal realm of slaves, dogs, and malevolent spirits to associate with such wicked rebels? The people of this world are treacherous and deceitful, reciting false scriptures and corrupting the classics. How much have they wronged me? How grievously they harm one another! Is this not agonizing?

I issue this decree of sincere instruction so that all people may know and hear it. Let them reflect deeply and strive to cultivate goodness. When their merit in cultivating goodness is complete, they may encounter the true and have their years extended. Be prudent and observe this as decreed.

Lord Lao said:
When I first established the Celestial Master, I bestowed the registers, talismans, and contracts to govern the Daoist teachings. Did I ever institute a law to take even a single coin from the people? It is like appointing an official to a post—how much wealth might they possess? Now, I issue this new law to be followed and obeyed.

From this day forward, there shall be no division of transmission, no vows of offering, no imitation of the registers of governance. Without wealth or silk, the households shall make their annual pledges, ensuring the sustenance of their kitchens and the prosperity of their families. For the myriad afflictions of men and women, illnesses and disasters, all offerings and vows made in kitchens shall cease. Only the storage of provisions shall be permitted, with one-third collected. The people may trade and calculate in the markets, and the gatherings at homes shall be dissolved, allowing them to seek the masters for governance instead.

When the people suffer illness or their lives are imperiled, they need only maintain the incense and flame, and present their sincerity in written petitions. Thus, they may attain resonance. The households shall be permitted to offer thirty sheets of paper, one brush, and one stick of ink each year to support the work of drafting petitions and delivering salvation.

If any Daoist officials harbor impure intentions and do not follow the true teachings, the people may instead seek out masters who uphold the new statutes and the pure teachings.

Observe and act with caution, as decreed by the statutes.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: After the merit of Libationer officials is transferred, their descendants, if pure, clear-minded, and adept in matters of spirits, may approach enlightened masters to receive appointment, register talismanic pledges, and inherit their fathers’ legacy.

Should their descendants conduct themselves perversely, indistinguishable from the common folk, and disobey the statutes and covenants, all officials shall deliberate and jointly submit a memorial to the Heavenly Bureau, permitting the people to seek new masters.

Observe and act with caution, as decreed by the statutes.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: If Daoist households possess altars, make vows, or prepare ritual utensils without consulting their masters, the masters shall immediately order their return, require the people to procure them from the market, and dissolve such gatherings.

The Most High Lord Lao’s recitation of the pledge states: Daoist households that do not practice the statutes and methods, fail to diligently maintain the incense and flame, dispel disasters, avert misfortunes, or address illnesses—yet still come and go with anxieties about officials, strange omens, or various phenomena—shall not be permitted to make protective vows.

Why is this so? If a household embraces the Dao seeking blessings, it is a misguided endeavor. Only after first submitting a petition may they proceed.

From this day forward, if Daoist households seek to make vows, they must first prepare the utensils for the ritual feast and submit a petition. When gathering to establish and fulfill a vow, they shall seek but one matter above all, and the blessings received shall be without distraction. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: Daoist officials, upon receiving their appointments and administering talismans and registers, shall do so in accordance with each household’s means. If they wish to hold a ritual feast, the number of participants may be determined at will—three or more may gather, and those capable may do so repeatedly. The dishes and harmonious gatherings may be shared in common; if unable, there shall be no hardship. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: For ritual feasts, the highest observance requires seven days of fasting, the middle three days, and the lowest a single day of prior abstention. The fasting method: consume plain rice and vegetables for one day, consuming three *sheng* of rice. Abstain from the bedchamber, the five pungent vegetables, raw greens, and all meats. Cultivate diligent good conduct, remain within, and do not traverse where one ought not. When those in mourning, impurity, or recent childbirth wish to attend, they shall bow eight times before the incense and flame, and a person of great virtue and progress shall preside, preparing a fine rice platter at the head of the gathering, with each person having their own platter. Those who do not follow the Dao may be invited to the feast without hardship. Yet worldly fools, deeming their practices different, harbor contrary intentions, neglecting the fast and disdaining the statutes and methods. The host must seek reverence and solemnity, for within the gathering, anger and resentment shall have no place. From this day forward, officials shall adjudicate with discernment, contemplating the subtle essence. If there are those who, with unified hearts, seek blessings and vows, they may attend the feast without hardship. Upon returning home as the host, burn incense and pass the night in vigil, tending the incense flame thrice, and recite: *"For the ritual feast held by the household of so-and-so, we dissolve and seek such-and-such a matter of grace and blessing, may we be enveloped in the protective qi of the Dao."* Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: The method for ritual feasts prescribes three courses: first a light repast, then wine, and finally rice. In this age, many cannot prepare three courses, so wine may come first, with a limit of five *sheng*. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: When men and women receive registers and are appointed as officials, they present memorials to the celestial bureaucracy. Those who align with sincerity shall not be deluded by the myriad evils. They should understand themselves as living officials and servants—how could Daoist households deceive or transgress against those with such duties? Daoist officials perform sacrifices and aid, yet the ignorant and benighted transmit false traditions, self-appointing and administering registers, invoking and wearing the generals of the Thousand Divisions, along with their attendant soldiers, causing confusion. Such false invocations of soldiers for protection are entirely baseless. They may only perpetually wear the insignia of their appointed office. Those who commune with spirits and attain the Dao may encounter immortal officials. Those who receive registers and appointments shall not have five or three attendants or soldiers assigned to them. Yet worldly fools, imitating one another in self-appointment—how could there possibly be hundreds of thousands of layers of generals, soldiers, and guardians? From this day forward, all past practices in this regard shall cease and no longer be followed. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Lord Lao said: When inviting guests to assemble, people should attire themselves with solemn dignity, as if attending an audience in the celestial palace of the Son of Heaven, all reverent and respectful together. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Lord Lao said: Daoist followers serving their household masters shall do so as commoners serve officials, addressing themselves as "Daoist followers." Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Lord Lao said: Those who receive registers of governance—sincere disciples—shall, in their morning and bowing audiences, conduct themselves with the same ritual propriety as officials and clerks in ceremonial attire, adhering equally to ritual and law. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Lord Lao said: Daoist officials and libationers who confer registers of governance and office upon others shall impart only the Dao. After receiving and wearing these registers, if one fails to advance with diligence, violates precepts, breaches covenants, acts perversely, harbors malice, or engages in unlawful conduct, wandering among the people and reciting false precepts to deceive in myriad ways, such a one shall not be upheld in the world.

Among the households and followers of the Dao, when afflicted by illness, peril, or distress, those who rashly alter my Dao shall be corrected and healed. Foolish and witless, they recklessly shift and change, offering bundles of grain and firewood to household masters to treat illness, claiming recovery is certain—only to meet death instead. After death, their prior merits are transformed, and they revert to their original status as commoners.

Yet when the sick recover, they claim it as the grace and blessing of the Dao, proclaiming the Dao’s divine power and broadcasting it to the world. Upon hearing this, those who suffer misfortune or calamity turn to local officials for aid, while others change their affiliation and submit to conversion. Households gradually multiply, but the household libationers, in their perversity and inconsistency, act contrary to proper conduct—indulging in debauchery, theft, and killing, their nature deficient and their actions coercive and intimidating, peddling the divine and trafficking the Dao.

Some falsely claim to have seen the Lord Lao, or feign inspiration, speaking as if by divine instruction, thereby sowing sighs and resentments among the people. Others, though they too serve household masters, ask, "Why do we not compare to other masters?" They demand reverence and worship, offering fleeting rectitude, then seek out the wise and enlightened, claiming the precepts and laws are too strict to transgress.

Such deceivers must be examined and restrained. The decline of fortune, the turn of misfortune, and the length of life are all predetermined—none can be prolonged by the machinations of foolish Daoist officials. Those who deceive and disrupt the Dao’s laws—if any such exist—shall be scrutinized by all officials.

When gathering converted households for communal feasts, take their sworn statements, and let Daoist officials jointly submit memorials to permit households to change affiliation. Followers shall not rashly transfer or rebel on their own. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

The Lord Lao said: I observe that among the world’s common and foolish, libationers who convert households and lead followers in submitting memorials present documents of refinement—some ten or five sheets, others three or two. Yet whether many or few, all lack coherence. Of the myriad memorials submitted, not one reaches its destination. How can this be?

The earthly true officials, those who oversee affairs, fear the chain of guilt and thus suppress, delay, or disobey. I now command that proclamations of sincerity be chanted and sung, and all officials be admonished. The method of memorials and documents should resemble those of living officials—only then can they reach their proper destination and be governed by reason.

Foolish Daoist officials do not refine their memorials and petitions, nor do they seek out the bright and capable to study and practice the refined methods. Among the world’s Daoist officials, some compose twenty or thirty sheets for the deliverance of the deceased, weaving countless fine words about the matter. Yet this is not as good as cultivating reverent good conduct, fasting and refining the body, kindling incense and binding oneself in devotion, and establishing a hundred days of merit—all for the sake of the departed parents, to deliver and ascend their souls.

Monthly single-sheet memorials reporting fasting merits surpass a thousand petitions for deliverance through starry rites. If fasting merits do not reach their mark, there can be no principle of resonance or penetration. First establish merit through fasting, then submit petitions for deliverance—without any extraneous items like rice, silk, paper, or brushes. The most ancient assemblies of the worthy were simply for burning incense and redeeming the dead; the highest way does not require deliverance through stars.

What is troublesome does not reach the Dao; what reaches the Dao is not troublesome. From now on, reflect upon and recite these admonitions. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

Lord Lao said: For Daoist officials, register initiates, and lay men and women, the method of burning incense to make vows is as follows: Enter the oratory, face east with sincerity, offer incense three times, then perform eight bows. Remove your headscarf and hat, kowtow nine times, and strike your cheeks thrice. After completing these three sets, declare: "Officer so-and-so, on this day and hour, burns incense and wishes to make a solemn petition." Then take the incense in hand, place it in the censer, and say aloud: "May so-and-so’s transgressions from the age of seven onward be absolved, and may they attain longevity and extended years." Offer incense again and vow: "May so-and-so’s three clans, five ancestors, seven generations of parents—those who have passed before and those who have died after—be delivered from suffering and dwell in peace and bliss." Offer incense once more and say: "May all members of this household, great and small, remain free from harm, and may their income and expenditures flow smoothly." Offer incense again and vow for official promotion. Offer incense once more and pray for the resolution of disputes, illnesses, and ailments among local officials. Each vow is made with a separate offering of incense. If making vows on behalf of others, there is no fixed limit—ten, twenty, or thirty offerings may be made as the vow requires. On fasting days, incense is burned at the six hours: *yin*, *wu*, *xu*, *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*. On non-fasting days, incense is offered at dawn and dusk. On *chen* and *si* days, when the heavens are clear, repent at midnight facing north, kowtow one hundred times in sets of thirty-six, strike the cheeks three times, and perform three hundred kowtows as a regular practice. Those whose accumulated merit runs deep will draw near to communion with the divine; those whose merit is shallow will attain immortality in eight years. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

Lord Lao said: On the three assembly days, Daoist adherents shall present themselves to their masters for instruction. When first submitting petitions and registers, stand in the oratory facing south with the master to the north, each in their proper position. Perform eight bows, nine kowtows, and strike the cheeks nine times. Bow again, prostrate, and request the petitions and registers. Then pay respects to the master. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

Lord Lao said: For Daoist officials and libationers, the method of cultivation while traveling among the people in the four directions is as follows: Walk with an upright posture, face forward, and proceed directly without glancing left or right. Upon entering a household, do not give way to anger or reproach. Do not criticize their food, drink, beds, or dwellings, nor engage in idle chatter or debate right and wrong. Do not first visit the homes of the wealthy and powerful out of partiality, nor neglect the proper order of visits. Instead, go first to the homes of the poor and humble, instruct them in seeking blessings, and ensure all rituals and precepts are fully observed. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

Lord Lao said: Daoist register initiates and lay adherents who have servants must not address them as "servant" but by their given names. If they commit an offense, do not beat them arbitrarily; instead, summon them and explain: "You have committed this transgression and deserve punishment. Accept it." If the reprimand is just, the servant will acknowledge their fault without resentment. Daoist officials and lay adherents must not speak of death in their words or breath, for this is a grave taboo for Daoist adherents. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

Lord Lao said: In the world, there are those who inherit their fathers’ or ancestors’ practice of the Dao, creating their own methods and household rituals. Others inherit the office of libationer from their ancestors. The common people, being ignorant, claim that when a father dies, the son succeeds him, without proper affiliation. Household masters and common folk alike indulge in licentious and heterodox worship, introducing various corruptions and falsely claiming to uphold the Dao. When they see a properly ordained libationer, they bow and say: "I am a Daoist adherent and wish to submit to your guidance, but I fear offending the spirits and bringing calamity upon myself." Such people may request to hold a Daoist assembly. After three gatherings to establish sincerity, if they still refuse to comply, do not invite them again. These deceitful individuals persist in their ways; they are not true followers of the Dao. It would be better to invite those who do not claim to uphold the Dao at all. Why is this? All are subjects of Heaven, governed by a single Dao. Yet if they are of a different affiliation, it is better to include them in assemblies than to tolerate those who claim to uphold the Dao without a master and harbor heterodox intentions. Daoist officials and libationers should include them in assemblies and treat them as guests. However, such arrangements often lead to many errors and require careful consideration. If they are treated as guests, they shall be judged according to the law. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

Lord Lao said: When Daoist adherents seek blessings through offering feasts, they must first purify themselves through fasting. The fast may be of high, middle, or low grade, as they choose, and the assembly shall be held the following day. On the day of the feast, invite guests to stay overnight in the host’s home. After all vows have been fulfilled, the officials and assembly shall collectively ensure the proceedings, and no one shall depart for other engagements. From cockcrow until sunrise, all shall take their places in the kitchen to welcome the immortal officials. Only for the feast of the departed ancestors is the time extended from dawn to noon. If a person of rank or office makes a vow and seeks official recognition, or if it involves commanderies, counties, dukes, ministers, or nobles of any rank, the feast may be held as they wish, including animal sacrifices. The people shall enjoy peace, the land shall be secure, wind and rain shall come in due season, and feasts may be held as desired without prior restrictions. There is no limit to the number of attendees, nor is it required to hold a feast at all. Simply maintain diligent incense offerings. Let this be diligently observed as decreed.

Lord Lao said: The qi of the Dao is layered in countless folds. Since the beginning of creation and the reign of the Yellow Thearch, gates have had immortals and sages. From this time onward, human deceit has flourished, and the Dao has declined; scriptures and texts have become corrupted. Later generations, in their fraudulence, have fabricated immortal scriptures and diagrams. Countless methods and prescriptions fill the world—ten thousand herbs, a hundred thousand remedies. Yet why do those who delight in the Dao and seek longevity fail to achieve it? The foolish, with their limited understanding, cannot grasp the subtleties of the supreme Dao of immortality. The transmission of the Way from immortal to sage is passed down through oral instructions and essential secrets, not recorded in written texts. Without the merit of fasting, focused meditation, and communion with the divine, how can one summon the winds and ride the dragons, have immortal officials descend to visit, be received and ascend on high? Those who consume herbal and mineral medicines and gain efficacy from them—these are the ones whose petitions are heard above, and who are sent immortal youths and jade maidens to attend them.

The celestial officials’ divine medicines, when their proportions are precisely measured—one herb for one person—yield the efficacy of a hundredweight. When one person gains efficacy, the methods of ingesting qi are likewise equivalent. How can people of this world comprehend such principles? Without the descent of immortals, how can one ascend the steps of the Great Clarity? Yet by preparing and consuming these medicines, one may indeed dispel illness, prolong life to its natural end, ward off noxious qi, and render oneself invulnerable to pestilence. One may complete the span of a lifetime, supplementing it with grain to nourish one’s nature, establishing merit through fasting and purification, and dissolving transgressions to erase sins.

Those who wish to cultivate and study the Way of longevity should diligently seek out the recited precepts and establish merit, engaging in incense offerings, fasting, and refinement. Only after their merit is complete and their sincerity moves the heavens can they attain longevity. The *Baopuzi*, without seeking to benefit the world, has gathered and synthesized the medical formulas of former sages from various schools to compose this scripture and exhort the pursuit of immortality. Its inner and outer chapters begin by affirming that immortality is attainable, thereby awakening the hearts of people. It inherits many lost scriptures yet does not recklessly fabricate or alter their teachings, thus avoiding the transgression of falsifying scriptures. In composing this scripture to exhort the pursuit of immortality, its merit or fault will be self-evident, and in future lives, one may ascend the ranks of immortals.

Those who cultivate the Dao must no longer rely on the spurious scriptures and precepts of earlier generations. The texts people study today, though deemed fine classics, may benefit the body and bring morning wealth and honor, serving as a legacy for descendants—but they contain no steps to attain longevity or ascend as immortals. Those who seek the Way of life must first read the *Five Thousand Character Classic*, for it is the most essential. Be clear and cautious in upholding it as you would a sacred decree.

Lord Lao said: Outside the purification chamber, according to the available space, construct an additional layer of fencing or walls with a gate facing east. The master of the purification and their disciples must remain outside the chamber. During the time of incense offerings, the master must not eat, drink, or wear shoes within the chamber. When entering to sit or speak, this is the greatest prohibition for seeking blessings. Lest ordinary people enter and take things, all objects must be secured. Be clear and cautious in upholding it as you would a sacred decree.

Lord Lao said: Daoist officials and Daoist followers, upon the death of a family member, shall perform purification rites seven days later. The family of the deceased shall distribute living-world goods and hold a ritual feast according to the number of attendees, inviting laypeople to participate without hardship in order to assist the deceased in crossing over. After three such rituals are completed, if they wish to hold another, they may do so at their discretion. If they are able to prepare adequately, they should; if not, they need not trouble themselves with incense offerings.

Be clear and cautious in upholding it as you would a sacred decree.

Lord Lao said: When holding a ritual feast for the deceased and offering incense, one Daoist official shall stand in the center of the purification altar, facing east. The register-holder and the host shall also face east, each performing eight bows, nine prostrations, nine breast-strikings, and repeating this three times. Each shall then bow again earnestly. If there are many attendees, they may perform seated bows and prostrations. The host shall state their official title, surname, and given name, and address the Boundless Great Dao, the myriad myriad Perfected of the Boundless Great Dao. Taking incense in hand, they shall offer it three times into the censer, reciting: "For the deceased, so-and-so, I dissolve their transgressions and offer this incense with my vows." The others shall then approach the altar in turn, earnestly offering incense according to the proper method until all have finished. The master of the purification shall present the memorial, while the others shall bow to the host from their seats, facing east, and prostrate themselves after the memorial is presented. The ritual feast shall then commence. After the feast concludes, the master of the purification shall enter the chamber to report the proceedings, seeking blessings for the host. At that moment, the host shall bow and prostrate themselves. When the gathering disperses, the guests shall bow eight times toward the purification chamber before returning home. The host shall burn incense three times throughout the night.

Be clear and cautious in upholding it as you would a sacred decree.

Lord Lao said: If a Daoist follower’s household has a sick member, upon returning home, the master shall first instruct the follower to offer incense in the purification chamber. The follower shall stand outside the chamber, facing west, with hair unbound, prostrating themselves to confess and repent all transgressions and offenses, ensuring nothing is concealed or withheld, and seeking forgiveness. If even one matter is left unconfessed, or if their intent is insincere and their faith in the method lacking, how can the memorial dissolve their transgressions? The master shall also separately report: "Follower so-and-so seeks such-and-such." The sick person shall also confess their transgressions. If all transgressions are confessed, the master shall receive favorable responses; if not, the master shall receive no favorable response. During the confession, talismans may be employed concurrently. The follower shall present the memorial three times a day. If after three days the sick person shows no improvement, a memorial may be presented to dissolve the retribution of deceased ancestors. The sick person’s family shall prostrate themselves toward the purification chamber by day and face north toward heaven and earth by night, confessing their transgressions without fail at any hour. If the family, in their distress, wishes to make vows involving money, food, or offerings, they shall not be heeded. If they are able to prepare a feast, they may invite three, five, ten, or more guests, according to their means, and hold a ritual feast in accordance with the regulations. During the feast, the guests and host shall bow, prostrate themselves, and offer incense, seeking deliverance for the sick person. After the feast concludes, the guests shall return home and burn incense, prostrating themselves three times throughout the night, performing the same rites of deliverance for the sick person.

Be clear and cautious in upholding it as you would a sacred decree.

Lord Lao said: If Daoist followers transgress the regulations through licentiousness or killing, they shall calculate the value of the illicit goods and return them to the lay household, purchasing ritual feast supplies themselves. The master shall then present a memorial to dissolve their transgressions. During the ritual feast, the host and guests shall face the incense, perform eight bows and prostrations, thirty-six breast-strikings, and repeat this three times before bowing again. Taking incense in hand, they shall place it in the censer and declare: "So-and-so addresses the Most High Great Dao: I, so-and-so, being but a mortal of limited understanding, have followed the regulations in offering sacrifices to such-and-such an official for such-and-such a matter, yet I have also made improper requests to fulfill my desires. Now, in accordance with the regulations, I return the illicit goods to provide for the ritual feast and invite guests as witnesses. From this day forward, I entrust my life and death to the Dao and dare not repeat my former actions. I humbly seek to be included in the amnesty and receive the grace of life, that the Dao’s qi may take pity on me."

Be clear and cautious in upholding it as you would a sacred decree.

Uphold it with clarity and caution as you would a sacred decree.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: Male and female Dao officials, "having long been mired in defilement, have assumed the office of Libationer. Through accumulated diligence over generations, they have grown avaricious and impure. If, after their bodies have transformed and they have sought renewal over many years, they still engage in bribery and self-serving explanations, greedily hoarding filth for themselves, this is to fabricate falsehoods in the name of the scriptures and precepts. Such persons shall all descend into hell. Those whose sins are grave shall be reborn as insects or beasts, their debts of retribution never to be repaid. Thus, I now issue this renewed ordinance of music and rectification, aligning it with the heads of the teachings, so that those who believe in the Dao may harmonize with human sentiment, purify their bodies, and align their conduct with the Dao’s merit. The Most High’s pure qi shall henceforth shelter and protect them, allowing the people to begin anew, rectify past wrongs, and cultivate future virtue, all in accordance with the new ordinances as the standard."

Uphold it with clarity and caution as you would a sacred decree.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: The Dao’s qi is layered in hundreds, thousands, and myriad folds. The sages of old and the worthies to come, who cultivated and studied for immortality, all encountered immortal officials. Each person received a single layer of qi, and upon ascending and transcending, their names were never recorded in the registers. The teachings of the bedchamber, which encompass the *Huang-Chi* scriptures and covenants, comprise one hundred and twenty methods. The teachings of pacing the courtyard and thresholds likewise contain not a single word of deviation. Since the time when the Celestial Master Zhang Daoling wearied of his ascent, only those scriptures with extant explanations have remained in the world—yet who among them has attained longevity and ascension as a flying immortal? The most essential techniques of the body, the oral instructions of *daoyin*, all reside in the master’s words. The written teachings, however, are used to test the hearts of officials. If those who open and believe in them hold fast to the scriptures with single-minded devotion, their incense and flames will naturally flourish. Through refining their practice to completion, they shall awaken to the perception of true spirits, commune with immortals, and obtain the ultimate instructions.

Henceforth, those who falsely deceive and mock the Dao, adorning themselves with divine favor and embellishing the scriptures, altering texts and fabricating precepts without cause, have established these counterfeit practices as custom, misleading the world. Men and women who receive and wear the covenants and ordinances, blindly transmitting them to one another, are unable to transcend themselves yet still lead disciples, confusing and deluding the common people. The number of offenders is great, inviting calamity and tribulation, polluting the Daoist teachings and damaging the Dharma-body. I now earnestly command that the *Huang-Chi* be abolished and reformed, and that pure and distinct methods be cultivated to align with the Dao’s merit. From this day of admonition forward, those male and female officials and registered disciples who wear the *Huang-Chi* covenants shall find no auspiciousness in doing so. If there are those who remain heedless, the true officials of the land where they reside shall record their qi and govern their misdeeds. The attending envoys shall examine and record their actions, and I shall visit calamity and tribulation upon them, consigning them to hell in death. If their refined spirits are reborn, they shall enter the bodies of insects or beasts—even swine or sheep—and their debts of retribution shall never be repaid.

I observe that among the world’s people, husbands and wives who practice the *Huang-Chi* do not follow a single method according to the essential principles of the celestial officials. Instead, they engage in defilement and impurity, violating the prohibitions of the *Jinglu* governing officials with their hands. Yet even the celestial officials, immortals, and jade maidens do not transgress the laws of the governing chambers. Now, due to the greed and defilement associated with the *Huang-Chi*, the Daoist teachings have long been without true transmission. The blind have led the blind, and none have attained the correct middle path. There are, however, those who are pure, refined, and unsullied, who do not err in their adherence to the scriptures and precepts. I intend to eliminate such persons from calamity, sparing them from the violence of condemnation and reproach. Thus, I first issue this solemn covenant to reform and redirect the teachings. Nevertheless, the foundational scriptures and covenants of the bedchamber, which seek life’s essence, comprise over a hundred methods that are not subject to prohibition. If husband and wife delight in these methods, they need only inquire of a pure and upright master, follow the prescribed methods, and practice according to their preferences—even a single method will suffice.

In this defiled and evil age, embodied beings dissipate their spirits, and the threads of their sins are difficult to unravel. Thus, I issue this covenant. It is essential to undertake fasting and merit-making, returning to the beginning, wiping away sins and transgressions, so as to awaken to the perception of true immortals. Male and female officials, exert yourselves in cultivating fasts, seek out these solemn admonitions, establish merit through incense and flame, and the Dao of immortality shall not be far.

Uphold it with clarity and caution as you would a sacred decree.

The Most High Lord Lao declares: Since the time when the Celestial Master ascended as an immortal, the true offices of the Dao have been neglected, and the Way has withered while people have grown defiled. Later officials, blindly transmitting the teachings to one another, have self-appointed themselves to govern registers, talismans, and covenants, their qi and seasonal correspondences inverted and disordered, rendering them unfit for emulation. I originally conferred the Twenty-Four Treaties, which correspond above to the Twenty-Eight Constellations and below to the twenty-four qi of yin and yang, bestowing them upon the diligent Libationers to transform and lead the households of the people. Zhang Daoling expounded the methods of the Dao, initially establishing the teachings in the single province of Shu. He appointed male and female Dao officials, aligning them with the mountains, rivers, lands, commanderies, and counties, and in accordance with my governing officials, *jinglu* pavilions, and residences, he shared with me the task of leading and transforming the people, exhorting them to turn from evil and cultivate goodness. Mount Yangping’s name corresponds above to the Horn Constellation, and the other mountains follow likewise.

Yet later Dao officials, failing to comprehend the conditions of the unseen world, have employed the alliance methods of Shu, appointing themselves to governing offices. The edict’s text states: "Now, so-and-so is provisionally appointed to the He-Ming and Yun-Tai Treaties, temporarily registering and governing the office of qi, leading and transforming the households of the people. Upon presenting documents to the governing officials, they shall await the era of Great Peace before returning to their original treaties." However, the spirits of the lands of the Nine Provinces, along with their memorials and documents, all ascend through the true spirits of the local governing officials. Yet now, when Dao officials present memorials, they summon the governing officials and clerks of the Shu treaties and residences, while the spirits of other lands remain distant and estranged. My original decrees for the hostel-treaties were intended to lead and transform the households of the people. Zhang Daoling merely established the names of the mountain, river, land, and residential treaties—how could there be a requirement to await Great Peace before returning to the original treaties?

Henceforth, in all commanderies and counties, male and female officials who wear the registers of office shall each report to their masters to reform their residential treaties and qi. In accordance with the new ordinances, they shall return to their original hostel-officials, designating the treaties as their official titles and receiving the Twenty-Four Treaties. Those who transmit the covenants and ordinances shall issue proclamations, stating: "So-and-so is appointed as the Correct Central Official of the True Qi of the Horn Constellation Treaty."

When submitting memorials during the proper times for the constellations Kang, Di, Fang, and the Twenty-Eight Mansions, one may only address oneself as "your servant" and may not be styled as a "Perfected Person." If one holds an external register as an official, one may not use the title of a *treaty*. The titles of the residential treaties of Shu lands shall no longer be employed. If descendants of the Celestial Master’s lineage remain in the world, diligently upholding the teachings of the treaties and guiding the people, they may not rely upon or employ various officials or Libationers. When submitting memorials in accordance with the law, they may not solely claim the title of the Celestial Master’s position but must use their official titles, equal in rank to other officials.

Proceed with caution and act in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

Lord Lao said: Those who serve as Dao officials, Correct Treaties, or Libationers must promote the worthy and recommend the capable. When receiving disciples, conferring official treaties, registers of sincerity, and talismanic contracts, for every worthy and good person advanced, ten years of transgressions are erased, and the path to immortality is swiftly attained. For every sycophant or evil person advanced, ten years of retribution are incurred, and neither immortality nor blessings may be sought. Those among the people who seek entry into the Dao gate and wish to become disciples must first observe their temperament and disposition. Only after three years of mutual agreement in sincerity, when they have demonstrated the ability to cultivate the teachings with care, advance in virtuous conduct, maintain an unwavering heart, and hold no deviant intentions, may registers of sincerity be conferred and they be accepted as disciples.

Proceed with caution and act in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

Lord Lao said: Central officials, Correct Qi Constellation Treaty Libationers, may confer official registers and contracts upon others. However, those who have received registers may not recklessly confer contracts upon others. If one does not govern households but receives the register of a Central Treaty, one shall receive the position of a Libationer of Scattered Qi of the Central Treaty. If one holds the position of a High Spirit Official but does not govern households, one shall receive the position of a Libationer of Scattered Qi of an External Office. External officials and Libationers who govern the people shall sit with one hundred and fifty registers during assemblies, occupying the lower seats. If a Central Official governs the people, the descendants of the Correct Qi Libationer shall receive the office of a Central Official. For Central Constellation Treaties, Scattered Qi Libationers shall, when submitting memorials on behalf of the people under their father’s governance, address them as "civil treaty qi memorials." If other officials or Libationers govern the people, the people shall submit memorials under their own treaty qi. If one seeks personal salvation, self-cultivation, and does not transform the ignorant masses or govern households, one may directly receive the register of the Seventy-Five Generals of the Red Heaven of the Upper Immortals of the Central Office. In life, such a one shall rank above External Treaty Libationers.

Proceed with caution and act in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

Lord Lao said: Among Dao officials and Dao followers, if the spirits of their deceased ancestors, grandparents, or parents remain bound in the underworld and afflict their descendants, when purification rituals fail to reach them and memorials contain errors or excessive claims—such as boasting of ten or a hundred successful petitions—these efforts will be of no benefit. First, one must ensure the purification ritual is thorough and effective; only then may memorials be submitted for verification and deliverance. The methods of purification rituals and memorials need not be overly elaborate. Excessive and burdensome petitions defile the celestial bureaus and are better left unsent. Conduct one purification ritual every hundred days. On the day memorials are submitted for deliverance, one may also invite the worthy, holding an assembly commensurate with the number of attendees to rescue the suffering and accumulate blessings and benevolence. If one cannot prepare adequately, one may simply submit memorials through one’s master to deliver the deceased. Libationers may do so daily. After completing a hundred days of purification rituals, submit memorials through one’s master.

Proceed with caution and act in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.
