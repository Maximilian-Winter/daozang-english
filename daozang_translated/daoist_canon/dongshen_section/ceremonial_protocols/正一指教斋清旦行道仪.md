**Rite of the Zhengyi Zhi Teaching Fast: Morning Dao Procession**

**First, the Incense Burner is Opened**
The Most High Mysterious Origin, the Five Numinous Venerable Lords, are summoned. The Divine Envoys of Merit and Service, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Envoys, and the Three Qi Orthodox Spirits are urgently commanded to ascend and report to the Three Heavens’ Most High Mysterious Origin, the Great Dao Lord: "Your servants now kindle incense and perform the morning fast. May the Orthodox Qi of the Eight Directions enter our bodies, that our petition swiftly reach the presence of the Perfected and Boundless Dao."

**Next, the Incense is Circled, and One Turns East to Bow Twice Again**
Then, kneeling lengthily, one knocks the teeth twenty-four times to dispatch the officials.

**Respectfully Dispatched from Our Bodies:**
The True Officials of the Five Agents within our bodies, the Merit and Service Envoys; the Governing Lords and Scribes within our bodies; the Great Generals of the Banner-Monitoring Merit; the Vanguard of Merit-Validation, the Rear Guard of Execution; the Post Station Commandant, the Post Station Deputy; the Four Division Merit-Inspecting Heralds; and the Divine Immortal Direct Envoys of the Two Offices, the Orthodox Unity Merit and Service Envoys, whom we bear—
The Healing Merit and Service Envoys, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Judgment Scribes, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Scribes, the Gale-Riding Post Horse Memorial Scribes—each dispatched in pairs.
Those dispatched don their solemn attire, caps, and pendent tassels, array their majestic bearing, and stand before, behind, to the left, and right of us, all receiving the words from our mouths to separately report to the monitoring fast lords and scribes of the Grand Clarity’s court, the various lords, generals, and scribes of the Twenty-Four Dioceses established by the Heavenly Master, the lords of the Dao’s Two Mysteries, Three Origins, Four Beginnings, and Jia-Zi, the lords of the Seventy-Two Offices and the Three Officials’ Summons, the Day and Talisman Attendants, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the gods of mounds, marshes, and temples, the elders of mountains and forests, the spirits of mountains, rivers, streams, and valleys, the true officials of this region’s prefectures, counties, townships, and villages, the Qi-Recording Inspectors, the summoned landlords, the village and hamlet lords—all at once donning solemn attire, accompanying the Merit and Service Envoys within our bodies and the Flying Dragon Post Scribes to ascend and report to the Most High Great Dao, the Most High Venerable Lord, the Most High Elder, the Perfected of the Four Directions, the Honorable Lords of Virtue and the Dao, the Heavenly Master, the Lineage Masters, the Female Masters, the Three Masters’ Court Scribes, the Grand Clarity’s Numinous Spirits, and the various lords of Orthodox Unity: "Your servants, though unworthy, partake in the Dharma teachings, charged with expounding and transmitting. Now, at this time of return and report, we humbly proclaim and elevate [the petition] as follows."

**Next, the Petition is Read**
The words are earnest and reverent. Respectfully presented is the request, in accordance with the ancient statutes of Hanzhong, to establish the fast of the Zhi Teaching, performing the Dao procession thrice daily, day and night, with utmost sincerity. May profound grace be specially bestowed, and may [the deities] deign to descend and illuminate. We beseech the monitoring fast immortals, divine officials, and heavenly troops of the Three Heavens to descend in accordance with the rites, arraying their spirits and deploying their qi to assist and guard the Dao altar, purifying body and mind. May our prayers be felt and answered, bringing blessings and dispelling calamities. May our requests be granted as stated. The Merit and Service Envoys shall separately hear and report, transmitting them in due time. Once the matters are presented, each shall return to our bodies and their palaces, ready to arrive again when summoned, as before."

Thereupon, prostrating, one knocks the head thrice and swallows thrice, then rises to bow twice again.

**Next, the Four Directions are Saluted**

If the hour falls at midnight, first open the incense burner here, then proceed to salute the Four Directions.

The Most High Mysterious Origin Five Numinous Elder Lord shall summon the Merit and Service Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Envoys, and the Three Qi Correct Spirits, urgently to report to the Three Heavens’ Most High Mysterious Origin Great Dao Lord: “We now burn incense at this dawn purification rite, praying that the Eight Directions’ true qi enter our bodies, and that our petitions swiftly ascend, directly reaching the presence of the Perfected and Boundless Dao.”

Next, the Dharma Master returns to face east, then turns west to kneel in reverence, offering incense in a full circuit before resuming position.

Then, facing west, each declares their office and title, bows twice, and sits upright to read:

“Respectfully we report to the Heavenly Master, the Lineage Masters, the Female Master, and the Three Masters’ Ladies and Attending Officials.

Next, facing north:
Respectfully we report to the Supreme August Most High Northern Great Dao Lord.

Next, facing east:
Respectfully we report to the Great Clarity Mysterious Origin Most High Three Heavens Boundless Great Dao Most High Elder Lord, the Most High Venerable One, the Heavenly Thearch, the Heavenly Thearch Venerable One, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis, the Nine Qi Venerable One, and the myriad layers of Dao qi—one thousand two hundred officials of the Great Clarity Jade Palace.

Next, facing south:
Respectfully we report to the Southern Great Dao Lord, the Controller of Destinies, the Host of Officials, and the Three Heavens’ Lord of Myriad Blessings: ‘By past-life karmic causes, we have received the true teaching, fortunately encountered this opportunity, and been undeservedly elevated across the dark ford. Ashamed of our impure emptiness, remorseful for our lack of forbearance, we constantly aspire to establish merit to redress faults, prolong blessings, and dispel transgressions. We wish to accumulate superior conditions, rescue the distressed, and relieve suffering and hardship. Today, with sincere devotion, we present this purification rite and declare our prayers.’

Reading the Petition:
As fully set forth in the written text, may it be fittingly conveyed. Together we undertake this for the sponsor, so-and-so, to establish the Heavenly Master’s Instruction Purification Rite, lasting one day and night, with Dao practices performed at three intervals. May this merit be dedicated to the seven generations of the sponsor’s family—parents, ancestors, the departed, and all spirits—dissolving karmic retribution, reconciling ancestral punishments, delivering souls from eternal night, redeeming sins of endless kalpas, severing hell’s bonds, and establishing heavenly karma. Thus we return body to the Great Dao, return spirit to the Great Dao, return life to the Great Dao.

First Incense Offering:
May this merit extend upward to the seven generations of past parents and ancestors, freeing them from calamity, suffering, and hardship, wholly releasing them from afflictions and evil roots. May they undergo refinement in Vermilion Mound, transform in the Southern Culmen, forever escape the Three Wretched Paths, no longer cycle through the Five Realms, nor traverse the Six Destinies. May the Eight Gates’ blessings overflow, and future descendants receive flowing fortune. Now, burning incense, we personally take refuge in the Master Lords, ascending into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

Second Incense Offering:
May this merit be dedicated to the Emperor, the King, the lords, ministers, officials, and people, safeguarding the imperial foundation, flourishing the state, securing the altars of soil and grain, and prolonging blessings and prosperity. Thus we return body to the Great Dao, return spirit to the Great Dao, return life to the Great Dao. May this merit extend upward to the Emperor, the King, the lords, ministers, officials, and people, freeing them from calamity, suffering, and hardship, wholly releasing them from afflictions and evil roots. May their lives endure as heaven and earth, their years surpass the mountains, the nation be governed and the people at peace, achievements accomplished and the Dao at peace. May superiors be compassionate and inferiors filial, lords courteous and ministers loyal. May the Six Harmonies be tranquil and the Nine Provinces at peace. Now, burning incense, we personally take refuge in the Master Lords, ascending into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

Third Incense Offering:
May this merit be dedicated to the sponsor’s own self, household, and kin—high and low—rescuing from disaster, delivering from hardship, preserving life, prolonging years, extinguishing misfortune, dispelling calamity, averting harm, and eliminating suffering. May blessings be sought and granted, sins redeemed, and transgressions absolved. May it extend to all officials of shared qi, those governed, and the people of the world, universally sharing in fortune and blessings, broadly receiving vast grace. Thus we return body to the Great Dao, return spirit to the Great Dao, return life to the Great Dao. May this merit return to ourselves, our households, kin—high and low, young and old—shared qi officials, those governed, and the people of the world, freeing them from calamity, suffering, and hardship, wholly releasing them from afflictions, evil roots, the Five Punishments, and Six Harms. May all be dissolved, a thousand calamities and ten thousand sufferings turned and subdued. May the Four Passes and Nine Orifices exhale the old and inhale the new. May the Three Ones and Five Spirits guard the palaces and bureaus, the heart open and the mind bright, ears and eyes keen. May all aspirations and desires attain fruition, all undertakings and endeavors succeed. May seeking the Dao summon the Perfected, seeking wealth obtain treasure. May the Southern Prosperity Register record names under the Controller of Destinies, ensuring long life and enduring vision. May virtue align with heaven and earth. May livestock and creatures—winged, crawling, born, and unborn—all receive fulfillment. Now, burning incense, we personally take refuge in the Master Lords, ascending into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.”

Bow twice again.

Next, recite three hymns:

Striving intent binds the five viscera,
Restraining passions to uphold the purification rite.
Ancestors receive its blessings,
Descendants gain its fortune.
The body stands firm as adamantine,
Lifespan knows no end.
The heart shines like lapis lazuli,
Radiance illuminating beyond the self.
This is called the Supreme Dao,
Foremost among all paths.
All arise from the purification rite,
Attained through offering incense.
This is the seat of the Great Dao—
Let the wise each strive.

Offering incense ascends to emptiness,
Sincerity moving all things.
Single-minded, without dual intent,
Wishes follow the smoke’s ascent.
Incense smoke rises to Great Clarity,
Wishes follow the smoke’s path.
Smoke reaches the Great Dao’s presence—
The Most High deems it swift.
Circling thrice each,
Merit surpasses kin.
The Three Officials dissolve transgressions,
The Left Spirit inscribes life’s record.
The Immortal Metropolis fixes the jade register,
Names inscribed on the left contract.
The Heavenly Elder carves the jade record,
Hidden virtue stored in the golden coffer.

Purification restrains passions,
Burning incense toward emptiness.
Circling, presenting utmost sincerity,
Seeking knowledge from the Dao.
May sins of a hundred million kalpas be absolved,
Pardoning the bodies of past generations.
Ancestors’ transgressions all dissolved,
Fortune and virtue shall return.
Within, receive auspicious blessings,
Future generations all shall know.
All attained through burning incense—
Know this by the Heavenly Master.
Overwhelmed with joy,
We bow to the Heavenly Master Lord.

Upon the completion of the Zhengyi Finger-Pointing Teachings’ dawn purification and Dao-procession rites.
