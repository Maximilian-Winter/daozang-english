# 北极真武佑圣真君礼文

**Liturgical Text for the Northern Culmen Perfected Warrior, Protector of the Sacred, and True Lord**

The ritual proceedings commence in due form.

We humbly acknowledge that the celestial gates lie in distant obscurity, beyond the reach of mere words; yet the luminous symbol of Heaven may be approached through utmost sincerity. The divine power of the death-dealing spirit has long been renowned for its vastness, while its auspicious radiance universally bestows illumination. All who dwell beneath its shelter dare not forget their devotion.

With reverence, we invoke the Celestial Pacifier, True Warrior—Governor of the World and Fortune Spirit, Preceptor of the Jade Void, August Emperor of the Dark Heaven—whose numinous might blazes resplendent, whose majestic virtue towers sublime. As Great General of the Upper Firmament and Fortune Spirit of the Lower Realm, his sixfold penetration and fourfold opening leave no prayer unanswered. For all nations and multitudes, every supplication finds response.

Today, the officiant [Name], having purified the sacred precinct and earnestly cultivated sincere devotion, gazes toward the Dark Culmen in reverent submission and lifts his gaze to the awe-inspiring countenance in worship. The incense smoke wafts ethereally, seeking silent communion through unwavering faith; the resonant chime of the qing bell soars aloft, evoking the lofty and far-reaching tones of the divine.

We humbly pray that the divine presence may manifest as if truly present, casting its gaze upon us in benevolent visitation. May it behold the depth of our devotion at this moment and erase the transgressions of many lifetimes. The ritual space stands solemn and immaculate; reverence and awe are duly observed. Facing the exalted Perfected Ones, we offer our wholehearted worship.

**Invocation of the Heavenly Worthy of the Transformed Body from the Golden Portal**

With devoted heart, we prostrate and take refuge.

Most Venerable and Most Sacred, without beginning or end, you govern the fifty billion Heavenly Lords and accumulate the qi of a hundred thousand myriad Brahma-realms. You establish the primordial teaching as its foundation and serve as the supreme master of the Dao’s ultimate lineage. Your dignified dharmic form radiates compassion; your resplendent aureole outshines sun and moon. In stillness, you expound the Dharma within the Palace of Five Luminaries, where the Perfected Immortals gather. In emptiness, you discourse on the sutras, wherein a single pearl contains worlds.

*Response:*
The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Commencement, Self-So and Spontaneous, of the Golden Portal within the Great Brahma Heaven.

With devoted heart, we prostrate and take refuge.

Forced to be named the Dao, you are honored as Sovereign, dwelling in the Seven Jeweled Terrace of the Upper Clarity and presiding as Lord of the Three Caverns and Nine Perfected. You broadly expound the Three Vehicles’ teachings and grandly open the gates of manifold mysteries. Your floral crown transmits myriad transformations; your cloud-like raiment glows with the hues of fivefold radiance. Ascending the Perfected and delivering the Sages, you serve as the hierarchical standard for all ranks. Protecting nations and pacifying households, you transcend the kalpas of beginning and end.

*Response:*
The Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the Jade Clarity Dao Lord of the Golden Portal within the Great Brahma Heaven.

With devoted heart, we prostrate and take refuge.

Vacuous and transformative, profoundly still and mysteriously penetrating, you serve as the Father of Teachings in the Grand Clarity and the King of Physicians in the Three Realms. You give life to the ten thousand kinds and govern the hosts of Perfected. You restore the dead to life, causing withered bones to receive grace; you dispatch talismans and fly charms, banishing demonic forces to their furthest bounds. Manifesting at Green Goat Mountain in Shu, you transmitted the Purple Qi at the Pass of Han. Restoring simplicity and returning to the uncarved block, you discoursed on the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue*. Weighing transgressions and assessing merits, you preside over the Twelve Divisions of the Cavernous Spirit.

*Response:*
The Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue, the Most High Lord Lao of the Golden Portal within the Great Brahma Heaven.

The Dao originates from the Mysterious Origin, its name residing before the Great Ultimate. You served the Heavenly Worthies at the dawn of the Crimson Clarity Kalpa and rectified the royal throne in the Kingdom of Serene Joy. Responding to the auspicious sign of sunlight, you revealed the source from which all existence flows. Your sacred descendants emerged, their numinous manifestations most revered and exalted.

*Response:*
The August Heavenly Worthy of the Lofty Jade Emperor, the Sacred Father, True Lord of the Great Beginning, and the Sacred Mother, Primordial Lady of the Great Ultimate.

With devoted heart, we prostrate and take refuge.

Responding to the transformations of the Mysterious Origin, the numinous brilliance of the Martial Star shines forth. You manifested eighty-one transformed bodies and traversed six million years. Auspicious signs unfolded like the bright sun; your spirit was nurtured in Serene Joy. Within that realm, you received the Threefold Qi and reposed in the Palace of Vast Cold. Your Dao matches the creative potency of Qian’s firmness; your virtue equals Kun’s nurturing capacity. The Dao and virtue originate from spontaneity; your awe-inspiring might subdues the myriad existents. You traverse the Six Directions and examine the Three Primes. Your vows are boundless; your divine works are supreme.

*Response:*
The Celestial Pacifier, True Warrior—Governor of the World and Fortune Spirit, Preceptor of the Jade Void, August Emperor of the Dark Heaven.

Within the Palace of Vast Cold, you received the Three Qi; in the Heaven of Serene Joy, you were endowed with sunlight. Vacuous and transformative, you unite with spontaneity; your Dao and virtue are exalted beyond compare. Above, you match Qian’s firmness in generating the ten thousand things; below, you equal Kun’s nurturing capacity in sustaining the multitudes. Your majestic countenance blazes with ineffable wonder; you vow to sever demonic forces and deliver all beings.

In the realm of the Great Brahma Heaven, within the Palace of Desirelessness, you assume provisional names to deliver beings and succor the world. Through six or seven cycles of spring and autumn, you perfected three thousand meritorious deeds. Your name ascended to the Jade Emperor; your rank was uniquely elevated as the Dark Warrior.

*Response:*
The Celestial Pacifier, True Warrior—Governor of the World and Fortune Spirit, Preceptor of the Jade Void, August Emperor of the Dark Heaven.

Upon the Five Clouds’ Throne, within the Palace of Eight Luminaries, I hearken to the resounding voice of the Golden Mouth and gaze upon the radiant countenance of the Jade Brow.

Within seven days, you sweep away demonic forces; beneath the Nine Springs, you liberate the stagnant souls.

Your divine might vast, your fame resounds in the Golden Towers; your talismanic commands, resplendent, descend from the Jade Firmament. Though your sacred presence briefly descends through the Three Heavens, you purge all demonic miasma in but seven days. Once more, you mount the Azure Dragon to ascend the sacred realm, bearing the imperial decree to guard the Mysterious Heaven. Exalted as the Supreme Great General, you forever extinguish evil and usher in the Dao’s qi.

We now recite the Third Precept of Cultivating the Perfected: *"One must not indulge in licentiousness and defile the true, polluting the sacred qi."* Reflecting upon my many lifetimes, I confess to having violated this precept. Today, I worship the exalted Perfected Ones with utmost sincerity, earnestly repenting. By the grace of the Dao, may universal pardon be bestowed.

*"Defilement and licentiousness harm the true qi—*
*Boundless transgressions truly cannot escape."*

Now, prostrating and taking refuge in the exalted Perfected Ones, I repent and vow to eradicate all karmic offenses.

With utmost sincerity, I take refuge and prostrate in reverence.

The Four Saintly Marshals stand in rank, foremost among the Immortals of old. They execute the divine talismans of the Great Emperor and bear the sacred seals of the Mysterious Origin. Where evil arises, they annihilate it; no harm remains unremoved. Thunder roars, winds rush, clouds soar, and lightning sweeps.

*Refrain:*
The True Martial of Heaven’s Pillar, Blessed Deity of the Age, Preceptor of Jade Void, August Minister of the Dark Warrior, Supreme Emperor of the Mysterious Heaven.
The Four Saintly Marshals, valiant and fierce, rank foremost among the Immortals, most noble and revered. Their crowns bear indigo locks, displaying majestic might; in hand, they wield divine blades to proclaim incantations.

His form towers a thousand *zhang*, his crown bears the Three Terraces. He responds to the constellations of Xu and Wei, embodying the qi of Water and Fire.

His divine power is boundless, his transformations measureless. With unbound hair and bare feet, he displays his majestic countenance; he arrays the Dipper and aligns the Qian trigram, proclaiming incantations.

His divine freedom is vast, his myriad transformations beyond naming. Robed in armor, he displays his majestic might; barefoot, he treads the Celestial Stem, his jade steps soaring.

He presides over the *ren* and *gui* directions, commands the *jia* and *geng* generals. Thunder Lords and Lightning Mothers lead the vanguard; Wind Masters and Rain Lords attend as his escort. The Eight Slayers guard before and behind; the Six Dings follow left and right. Where his divine blade points, snow and frost turn cold; when his black banner unfurls, clouds and mist coil.

Scrutinizing the heavens to punish the rebellious, patrolling the Ten Caves to assess the immortals.

Sweet springs well forth as auspicious omens; divine dreams reveal your numinous presence. Your retinue boasts the might of dragons and beasts; your manifestations bear the forms of tortoise and serpent. Throughout the realm, from the Central Plains to the barbarian lands, prayers and offerings abound. From ancient times to the present, your miraculous responses are recounted by the multitudes.

*Refrain:*
The True Martial of Heaven’s Pillar, Blessed Deity of the Age, Preceptor of Jade Void, August Minister of the Dark Warrior, Supreme Emperor of the Mysterious Heaven.

Sweet springs gush forth as treasured omens, dispelling the people’s afflictions with boundless celestial grace. Magnificent temples are erected in gratitude for your vast blessings; illustrious titles are repeatedly bestowed, illuminating your sagely virtue. Secretly aiding the highest to propagate the true teaching, your wondrous efficacy directly manifests to succor all beings.

The Eastern Flower, Southern Dipper, Northern Culmen, Western Numinous, the Six Luminaries, Five Stars, and the thousand Perfected, myriad Sages. Their radiance illuminates the realm; their majestic power blazes across the high heavens. Some wield the authority over good and evil; others hold the reins of life and death. The true lords of the myriad heavens, the dragon palaces of the netherworld, blessed lands and famed mountains—innumerable hosts of sages.

Invoking the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge and prostrate in reverence.
The constellations of Xu and Wei, the essences of Water and Fire, the Divine Lords of the Celestial Gate and Earthly Axis, the immortals of Jade Maidens and Golden Lads. Wielding the black banners of authority, the stars of Kui and Gang mark the paths of retribution. The Six Ding and Six Jia, the hosts of Perfected and Eight Fiends, the ranked sages of the Five Thunders, the immortal officials and divine warriors, the valiant generals and spirit soldiers—all the majestic and numinous, the boundless hosts of sages. At a single chant, they follow the exalted sages, all guarding and aiding the divine work. Each awakens a heart of joy, bestowing the power of protection. Universally enhancing virtue and power, all attain the mystery of the formless. Ferrying sentient beings, they accomplish the supreme Dao.

Invoking the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation through Thunder,
The rites completed, to the Three Pure Ones and the Northern Culmen’s Protector, the Sage Lord, we earnestly repent:
We reverently invoke the Primordial Heaven’s Great Sage, the Most Numinous Lord of the Northern Wall’s Ren and Gui. May your boundless compassion unfold, sheltering all beings in the dharma realm. May your majestic power descend without limit, vanquishing all demons below. May your benevolent grace flow endlessly, liberating the sunken souls of evil destinies.

Since time immemorial, we have transmigrated through birth and death until now. Lost in sound and form, sometimes existing, sometimes not, we have feigned truth and abandoned authenticity through cunning deceit. The seven emotions surge unceasingly; the ten karmic deeds deepen endlessly. Our faith falters, yielding to foolishness; our sincerity wavers, fostering laziness and neglect. We consume meat and wine, forgetting the precepts; we indulge in fame and profit, accumulating transgressions. Concealing schemes and manipulating numbers, we parade our abilities; covering faults and embellishing wrongs, we betray trust and conduct. Cursing wind and rain, we harbor resentment; slandering scriptures and defaming the Dao, we prolong ignorance. Cheating with scales and measures, we deceive; exposing ourselves to sun and stars, we forget defilement. The sea of desire and river of love are hard to escape; the bridge of the Dao and shore of the Way remain unattained. Having strayed into heterodox sects in this life, we fear sinking into bitter destinies in the next. Some are bound by celestial officials, stripped of lifespan and fortune; others are burdened by hell’s grudges. Our lives are as fleeting as morning dew, cause for alarm; our sins are as countless as the sands of a river, impossible to redeem.

Relying on the exalted Perfected Ones’ compassion, we pray for mercy upon this deluded mortal world. Open wide the gate of great compassion, look down upon our repentant prostrations. May the power of the One Vehicle dissolve the obstacles of the six senses and ten evils. May the enmities of a hundred lives and three existences, the hatreds of both parties, be entirely repented.

Having repented, we take refuge in the supreme, true, and correct Three Treasures.

With utmost sincerity, we make our vows:
First, may heaven and earth remain ever pure;
Second, may the sovereign’s reign endure ten thousand years;
Third, may the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven;
Fourth, may the trials of Fengdu be forever concluded.

Fifth, may the two qi remain without flaw or rebellion;
Sixth, may the five grains all ripen in abundance.
Seventh, may warfare cease for eternal kalpas;
Eighth, may the four seasons be free of plague and pestilence.
Ninth, may all beings escape the net of karma;
Tenth, may all who study the Dao attain immortality.

Holding fast to these ten vows, we weave good affinity,
repenting all karmic obstacles for sentient beings.
Aspiring to accomplish the supreme Dao,
we pray the celestial mirror reflect mortal sentiments.
With boundless compassion as our boat and oar,
may all beings universally cross to the Dao’s shore.

We now come to praise all meritorious virtues,
repenting measureless transgressions and faults.
Within the celestial heart, beyond the heavens, and throughout the four directions,
may all universally attain the wondrous Dao.

Having made these vows, we take refuge and prostrate to the supreme, most true Three Treasures.

**Chanting the Sutra – Dedication of Merit**

We humbly submit: a single sacred name
can dissolve kalpas of calamity.
The chanting of true names by the multitude
can prolong life after life of blessings.
Words cannot exhaust their profundity,
nor praise encompass their virtue.
Reverently following the subtle teachings,
we gaze upon the wondrous form.
With solemnity, we set forth the principle of praise and chant,
fully expressing the sincerity of repentance.
Though heaven’s hearing is not distant,
we hope human hearts may be moved.
We humbly pray: may your vast compassion be boundless,
mindful of the pitiable condition of all beings.
May past wrongs be thoroughly cleansed,
and all karmic debts from former lives be absolved.
Let deeds of goodness be inscribed in cinnabar,
and longevity extended upon jade tablets.
May kinfolk dwell in peace,
forever abiding in the land of blessed years.
May the nine lineages be delivered,
utterly departing the realm of darkness.
In attaining all blessings, what blessing would not be attained?
In extinguishing all disasters, what disaster would not be extinguished?
May a thousand spirits guard and protect,
and ten thousand affairs proceed smoothly.
Should these prayers accord with our foolish sincerity,
how dare we forget to offer gratitude?
We bow our heads in reverence, taking refuge,
and with wholehearted devotion recite:
*"Boundless Blessings, Heavenly Worthy,
Inconceivable Meritorious Virtues!"*

**The Rite of Veneration for the Northern Culmen’s True Martial, Protector Sage Perfected Lord concludes.**
