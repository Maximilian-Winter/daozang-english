**The Supreme Rite for Dispelling Disasters and Praying for Blessings**

First, submit the memorial and close the ritual space; the invocations follow the standard form.

Next, intone the *Hall Hymn*.

Then, each pays homage to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

Next, recite the *Incantations of the Five Directions’ Guardian Spirits of the Luminous Numinosity*:

**East:**
Ninefold *qi* of the Azure Heavens,
Great Spirit of the Bright Star,
Radiant upon the eastern quarter,
Illumining the Nine Gates.
Revolving the candle of yang light,
Sweeping away defilement and miasma.
The Luminous Youth,
Guards my chamber in readiness.
Subduing demons and binding specters,
He reports above to the Imperial Lord.
Upholding the true Dao,
With vermilion script on jade tablets.
The talismanic commands of the Nine Heavens,
Transmitted by dragon couriers.
All under heaven is pacified and secured;
I attain the flight of immortality.

**South:**
Cinnabar Heavens of the South,
Threefold *qi* flowing in light.
The Fire Star revolves its candle,
Illumining the Great Sun.
Above dwells the Vermilion Essence,
The Luminous Numinous Youth.
Commanding the hosts of fire,
Guarding the Three Palaces in readiness.
Beheading evil and binding specters,
Severing and suppressing demonic malevolence.
As decreed by the Northern Emperor,
Through the eight thrusts of wind and fire.
Interlocking bells blaze in splendor—
Dare any disobey?
The true Dao flows forth;
I partake of the supreme merit.
Preserving heaven’s enduring existence,
For kalpas without end.

**West:**
Heavens of the Sevenfold *qi*,
Great White streaming in essence.
Light gleams at the Golden Gate,
Illumining the Great Darkness.
Within abides the White Sovereign,
Named the Imperial Numinosity.
Protecting the spirit and securing peace,
Guarding my bodily form.
Severing the roots of evil,
The true Dao shines forth.
Palaces and halls are arrayed in solemnity,
The Three Luminaries fast in unison.
The Dao harmonizes with spontaneity;
I ascend in flight to the Purple Court.
The talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure
Bestow universal grace upon the ten thousand beings.
Merit extends to all;
Heaven and earth are at peace.

**North:**
Mystic Heavens of the North,
Fivefold *qi* lingering in circuit.
The Chronogram Star blazes resplendent,
Light gleaming in the Great Subtlety.
The Black Numinous Honored Spirit,
Clad in the raiment of flying immortals.
Guarding the Five Gates in readiness,
Inspecting essences and seizing the false.
Dare any test their power—
The *huoluo* blades sever and shatter.
As proclaimed by the jade talismans,
The spirits manifest their eightfold might.
The gates of evil are sealed;
The true Dao shines forth in clarity.
Illumining my body,
The Three Luminaries shine in unison.
I spur the void and ride the floating,
My form ascending in immortal flight.

**Center:**
The Yellow Center governs *qi*,
Overseeing the Mysterious True.
The Star of Stability emits its radiance,
Flowing and blazing through the Nine Heavens.
The Luminous Youths,
Twelve in number.
Primal *qi* and yang essence,
Flaming upward in crimson smoke.
Illumining all under heaven,
And the bodies of your servants.
A hundred evils are shattered,
Ten thousand ghosts slain.
The divine incantation of the Central Mountain
Is universally enacted by heaven’s agents.
The Five Numinosities secure peace;
My body ascends as an immortal.

Next, the *doujiang* chants; the ritual drum is sounded twenty-four times.

Next, the incense burner is kindled.

The Most High, True and Mysterious, Five Numinous Venerable Lord, summon the Attendant Officers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Attendants, and the Three *qi* True Spirits. Hasten to report to the Three Heavens’ True Primordial Lord of the Dao.

Your servant now burns incense, conducts the fast, and establishes the ritual, reverently offering it for the ritual’s sponsor, disciple [Name], with the intent of the fast. All other sincere supplications are recorded in the *qingci*. May the life-*qi* of the Supreme Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones descend and flow into the bodies of your servants, so that what your servant petitions may swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao’s Three Clarities and Supreme Saints, before the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heavens.

Next, the assembled officials each kneel and emerge from their stations.

Reverently, the Five Body True Officials and Attendant Officers within your servant’s body emerge to ascend the Three Heavens, executing the law and unfolding transformation. The Yin-Yang Attendant Officers, who deliver the Dao and dispel disasters, disperse misfortune and resolve calamities—twelve each—emerge. From the registers of the methods your servant has received, the Generals of the Central Establishment, the Front Division’s Merit-Reporting Generals, the Rear Division’s Merit-Executing Generals, the Courier Station and Relay Station Officers, the Four Division Inspectors, the Exhausted Merit Officers, the Upper Immortals, the Upper Numinosities, the Direct Attendant Officers of the Left and Right, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Decision Officers—two each—emerge.

As they emerge, they don their solemn attire, caps and pendants, and array their majestic presence. The Attendant Officers wear vermilion yang caps, celestial crowns, black silk unlined robes, and gird themselves with dragon-headed swords. The Petition-Bearing Attendants wear dark yin caps, Nine Virtues crowns, crimson ceremonial unlined robes, and gird themselves with tiger tallies, each holding jade tablets. The Direct Service Attendant Officers stand at the four directions. The Orthodox Unity Attendant Officers stand at the center. The Healing Attendant Officers safeguard your servant’s body. The Left Attendant Officers bear the standard at the front; the Right Attendant Officers hold the banners at the rear. The Yang Spirit-Decision Officers stand to the left; the Yin Spirit-Decision Officers stand to the right. The Upper Division Attendant Officers stand above; the Middle Division Attendant Officers stand within the body; the *Qi*-Hastening Attendant Officers urge the ten directions. The Upper Division Attendants gaze afar to the heavens above; the Middle Division Attendants survey the eight directions; the General Attendant Officers encircle your servant’s body.

The Tiger-Swift Officers of the Gentlemen-Attendants detect treachery; the Hook-Riding Officers patrol the ranks. The General Attendant Officers stand as archers; the Heavenly Ding Warriors enforce rectitude. The Rectifying Attendants gather the spirits; the Spirit-Feeding Attendants gather the ghosts; the Ghost-Feeding Attendants gather the *qi*; the *Qi*-Feeding Attendants gather the poisons; the Poison-Feeding Attendants gather the essences; the Essence-Feeding Attendants gather the perverse; the Perverse-Feeding Attendants execute the talismans. The Temple-Destroying Attendants command the fierce winds; the Relay Officers ride the post-horses; the Memorial-Presenting Attendants mount the flying dragons. All these mounted and stationed officers stand to your servant’s left and right, before and behind, receiving your servant’s words to report and relay to the local earth gods and altar deities, overseeing and summoning the *jiazi* officials, lords, generals, and attendants. With reverent sincerity, they jointly address the petition:

To the Supreme and Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Venerable, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis, the Nine *Qi* Venerable, the myriad layers of Dao-*qi*, and the one thousand two hundred lords and officials beneath the Jade Steps of the Great Clarity—
In this moment of celestial and human resonance, we beseech your protection through the talismans. Ascending and descending in hidden depths, nothing but utmost sincerity can reach you.

Within the depths of pure devotion, we restrain ourselves and gaze upward, where the Primal Mirror’s gate stands open. How much more so the true canon of the sacred scriptures, which expands the numinous ordinances to reveal the teachings. The celestial vault’s great image, the divine radiance of the ethereal light—there are celestial stations from which to look down, and auspicious omens that externally bind.

Now, the master of this rite, [Name], for the matter of [specific purpose], solemnly prepares the altar’s offerings, reverently awaiting the deities’ descent in spirit. We humbly extend our sincerity like floating duckweed, hoping for the slightest response to our vigilant gaze. May the words of our petition reach and move you, not betraying the earnestness of our intent.

We implore the *gongcao* messengers, the divine generals, and the spirit officials to swiftly ascend and present our plea, that the response may descend in timely accord. May what we pray for be fulfilled, and what we wish for be granted. Your servants and the master of this rite, with utmost reverence and awe, bow twice in prostration to make this known.

Next, each declares their name and rank:

Your humble servants, the ritual officiants [Names and titles], with unified sincerity, reverently address:

We have heard that the Jade Heaven is stern and distant, its threshold too vast for the dwellings of the kalpas; the Golden Grotto is remote and pure, its halls too lofty to gaze upon in vain.

The August Emperor reigns on high, grasping the threads of transformation at the center. He opens the ten directions without obstruction, his heart responding to things as they move; he is hailed as the Great Compassion of the Three Realms, regarding all people as his children, even the young and frail. Beholding the Terrace of Yuluo, he rolls and unfurls the kalpas as if casting away a mustard seed. Gazing back upon the myriad multitudes, he grieves for the ephemeral mayfly beneath the sun; looking down upon the nine dusts, he sighs for the Han Palace as if it were but an anthill. Ever mindful of the vulgar below, whose true path is long severed, he relies upon the statutes of deliverance, permitting the utmost sincerity of their pleas to be fully expressed.

Now, the master of this offering, the disciple [Name], for [specific matter], solemnly presents the tokens of sincerity and secretly petitions the immortal court, hoping for the heavenly grace to descend and observe, that his heart’s devotion may be singularly conveyed. We humbly beseech the Three Clarities to align their paths, departing the resplendent chambers of Li Qu; the Ten Poles to stream forth their chariots, following the flying void of the Dharma procession. The hundred million Heavenly Emperors shall trail their reins in the cinnabar whirlwind; the twelve hundred Lords and Sovereigns shall welcome them with jade-green standards. Casting fire for ten thousand leagues, they summon yang from below and call forth yin; revolving the three wheels of incense, they ascend beyond the sun and enter the moon. To the farthest east, they float upon the blazing waters; to the utmost west, they reach the twilight of Yu and Yi. Southward they journey to the Crimson Mound Palace, at the center they coil within the Yellow Qi’s abode. The northern halls of darkness extend to the City of Night; the frigid springs of Qiuhan descend to the Spirit Valley below.

As for the Master of Lu, hailed as the Teaching Father, he follows the retinue of the Great Ultimate. In the west, the Buddha is revered, ever attending in secret from the Realm of Extended Truth. The Mandate of the Primordial Beginning—who would dare not revere it? Thus, we humbly present these modest words, lifting our gaze to the clouded heavens. Knocking upon the azure sky, we perform the rites and invoke the sacred names to summon the deities.

We humbly pray that you, in your boundless grace, deign to look upon the sentiments of mortals and graciously descend in your swift chariot. We, the master of this offering and his attendants, bow our heads and prostrate ourselves to beseech:

Next, we invoke the sacred ranks, offer incense, present tea, and pour libations of wine.
Next, we perform the initial offering rites.
Next, we solemnly recite the Dharma names.

We, your humble servants [Names], with utmost sincerity, jointly address the Three Clarities, the Most High Saints, the numinous immortals of the altar, and the sovereigns of the Three Realms:

We have heard that the One True scatters its radiance, originally without distinction of high or low; the myriad beings take form, all nurtured by the pure and harmonious qi. Yet as life and death grow distant, likes and dislikes multiply in profusion. Though the defiled body may sink into deep delusion, the Great Dao still extends its saving grace. When the roots of transgression grow severe, unseen retribution is silently imposed; but if one awakens to a hundred wrongs, ten thousand calamities are instantly dissolved.

Now, the master of this offering, the disciple [Name], finds his spirit ensnared in darkness, his ethereal soul trembling in alarm. Through the vast kalpas, he has sunk into mutual ruin, causing his primordial spirit to flee in agitation. He does not tread the path of awakening, delighting instead in scaling the heights of delusion; he does not rest in the true court, willingly rushing into the snares of the world. Reflecting upon his past, he has endured toil and hardship beyond measure. Now, in this present life, his fate hangs as precariously as the lightning of day; reconsidering his accumulated deeds, his merits fall short by half a hair’s weight.

He may have turned against the Dao and deceived Heaven, or defiled the sacred and offended his superiors. He may have carelessly neglected scriptures and rituals, or slighted his parents and teachers. He may have failed in filial piety and brotherly love while managing his household, or transgressed the bounds of public and private conduct in his affairs. He may have defiled the true sanctuaries or violated the dignity of the celestial spirits. He may have trespassed against the great prohibitions of the Three Luminaries or disrupted the solemn sacrifices of seven generations. He may have harmed living creatures, engaged in licentious worship of spirits, or drowned himself in wine and reckless speech. He may have been ensnared by sensual pleasures, amassed wealth through injustice, or wielded cunning in devious ways. He may have been stubborn and self-righteous, or gluttonous and insatiable. He may have upheld the Dao yet failed in meritorious conduct, or managed his household yet neglected the rites of instruction. He may have disregarded human ethics or oppressed the weak. Together, these transgressions have plunged him into the five desires, exceeding the sins of a thousand lifetimes.

Yet, mindful of the boundless compassion of the Most High Saints, who shelter all beings and open the path to deliverance, the master of this offering, [Name], approaches the Dao in repentance, praying for Heaven’s vast forbearance. We humbly implore the Jade Void Great Emperor of the Celestial Pole, the august True Ones, to bestow mercy upon the dry bones, to grant life to the walking corpse, to dissolve the hidden transgressions of this single body, and to erase the unseen torments of a hundred generations. May past sins melt away like ice before their time, and may the blessings of rectification swiftly arrive like clouds. Prostrate and trembling, we await your response, longing to present our words and offer our cinnabar caskets.

Though we have carefully examined our plea, we still fear it may be flawed. Daring to transgress the heavenly prohibitions, we tremble as we make this declaration:

Next, we proclaim the Blue Petition,
as its words fully express our utmost sincerity.
May our reverent devotion be acknowledged,
and the gifts of life and growth be repaid.

The master of this offering, the disciple [Name], prays that the merits of this fast be recorded in the registers, that the fruits of the Dao sustain his being, that his lifespan and blessings be augmented in the days to come, and that his years be preserved henceforth. Reverently bearing the virtue of the true spirits, he seeks only the grace of their blessings.

We, the master of this offering and his attendants, overwhelmed with emotion, bow our heads and prostrate ourselves again.

Next, we offer incense and pour libations of wine once more.
Next, we perform the secondary offering rites.

We humbly renew our sincerity and address the Three Clarities, the Most High Saints, and the majestic spirits of the Ten Poles:

We have heard that the Jade Emperor observes all, and the Golden Perfected scrutinize everything. Moved by the pleas of all beings, they bestow their grace upon every creature. The lofty scholar aspires to immortality, and the ten thousand immortals gather like dew; the virtuous person accumulates blessings, and a hundred blessings adorn them with wondrous splendor. The principle values subtlety, and the response aligns with reverence.

Now, the master of this offering, the disciple [Name], for [specific matter], raises his words in the clear night and directs his thoughts to the purple gates of Heaven. From the earliest dawn, he has sought the orchid’s path, reverently awaiting the divine favor.

We humbly pray that the master of this offering, the disciple [Name], may cast off the snares of the world and ascend the ranks of immortality. May his entire household be permitted to enter the Grotto of Huayang; may the Liu and Gang families, with all their kin, rise together in the cinnabar and emerald chariots. May the reckonings of yin and yang be escaped, and the roots of life and death forever severed. If he seeks office and emolument, may he ascend to lofty heights; if he calculates wealth and stores, may his goods and assets flourish. May the blessings of high and low be shared, and all within and without rejoice in prosperity. May the unseen realms know no strife between humans and ghosts, and may all undertakings be met with felicity. May joy be equal among descendants, and protection extend to kin and stranger alike. May disasters of water, fire, weapons, and bandits never invade his home; may the adversities of sun, moon, stars, and constellations never afflict his body.

May he long encounter the flourishing of all things and forever escape the nine calamities.

Your servant and the sponsor of this rite, unable to contain the depth of our prayers and supplications, now present the full ceremonial offering of paper money and horses, reverently facing the altar to humbly submit our petition.

First, we present the paper money and horses, offer incense thrice, and pour the libation.
Next, we conclude the final offering of the ritual proceedings.

With utmost sincerity, your servant now respectfully invokes:
The Three Clarities and Supreme Emperors,
The Ten Loftiest Perfected,
The officials of the Three Realms,
And the divine spirits of this altar.

We have heard that to be irreverent is to forgo supplication—thus the sages left us texts of simplicity.
Heaven itself does not oppose the Dao, and the Great Way accords with the plainness of its unfolding.
The sponsor of this rite, concealing nothing in his earnest devotion, lifts his gaze to implore your sacred grace.
How could we not offer our most reverent hearts, ever mindful of the overseers of retribution,
Adhering to the luminous statutes and observing conduct,
Binding ourselves to the precepts of the immortals and fulfilling our vows?
A single day’s covenant is honored with a hundred lives unwearied.

Moreover, as the ritual draws to its close, we exhaust our treasures in grand ceremony.
How fares the night? The Silver River descends from the clear Han.
The flames of the phoenix-crowned lamps dim among the ninefold radiance;
The incense of the magpie-tailed censers fades amid the hundred harmonies.
Eight stanzas of cavernous scriptures are chanted, three libations of jade wine are poured.
The vermilion flames of the celestial paper money rise into the void;
The jade bells of the immortal melodies hasten their return to the heavens.
Crimson standards wind in procession, purple banners advance in measured grace.
Those who return to the Jade Capital are the boundless Lord Emperors;
Those who ascend to the Golden Portals are the Most High True Sovereigns.
All spirits follow the cinnabar chariots, the host of sages mount the purple reins.
Flanking them, moon-phoenixes take flight, dividing their course toward the cavernous chambers;
Below, cloud-dragons are reined in, gazing upon the vast seas as they descend.
The divine officials resume their stations, the celestial officers return to heaven,
Bestowing blessings to fill the hall, fleeting divine light lingering before our eyes.

As for the myriad forms of life, may all share in the nurturing benevolence;
The silent depths of the nine nether realms, may all receive the grace of transcendence.

Your servant and the sponsor, gazing in awe at the divine procession, fix our thoughts upon the vast emptiness,
Weeping at the dusty crossroads, unable to detain the sacred footsteps.
Overcome with longing and devotion, we prostrate ourselves again and again in farewell.

Next, the hymn of sending forth the deities.
Next, the dispatching of the officials to resume their stations.

The rite now concluded, the attending messengers and functionaries who emerged earlier
Shall re-enter through the Gates of Myriad Mysteries—those on the left returning to the left, those on the right to the right.
The chief functionary shall lead and oversee them, restoring them to the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber,
Ready to be summoned at need, as in former times.

Next, the restoration of the incense burner.
May the incense officials, the Dragon and Tiger Lords of Left and Right, and all attending spirit-officers,
At this place of ritual offering, naturally generate golden nectar, cinnabar and azure mushrooms,
While the hundred spirits and host of perfected gather before this incense burner.
May the sponsor receive blessings, his household be enveloped in grace,
And the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, bearing the incense smoke as their missive,
Swiftly convey the words herein uttered
To the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao,
The Three Clarities and Supreme Saints,
And the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.

The rite of the *Taishang* Supplication for Blessings and Averting Disasters is now complete.
