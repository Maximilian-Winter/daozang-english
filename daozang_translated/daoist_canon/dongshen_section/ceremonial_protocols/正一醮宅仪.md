**Zhengyi Ritual for Offerings to the Household Spirits**

When a household suffers from depletion and loss, when cattle and horses perish or go missing, when fields and silkworms fail to yield, when family members fall ill, or when the Five Pestilences and seasonal epidemics strike yearly, or when dogs, rats, insects, or ants cause disturbances—if this is due to offenses against the earthly deities of the five directions and twelve temporal spirits, leading to the dispersal of wealth and fortune, such that one’s aspirations remain unfulfilled—then it is auspicious to perform the offering ritual on a day when the Four Seasons are in their waxing phase.

**Ritual Implements:**
- Six clean mats,
- Twelve reed arrows,
- Twenty-four *zhang* of hempen cords: six *zhang* each of blue, red, white, and black.
- Nine lamps, with nine bamboo lampstands, each two *chi* and five *cun* in length (lamps not used during daylight).
- One large table, five small tables (or five incense burners if tables are unavailable),
- One *liang* of incense.
- Five bolts of colored silk: eight *chi* of blue, seven *chi* of red, nine *chi* of white, six *chi* of black, and five *chi* of yellow.
- Three hundred and fifty *wen* of coins,
- A five-*chi* hand towel,
- Thirty-five lacquered trays.
- Seventy dried jujubes,
- One *sheng* of chestnuts,
- Seventy walnuts,
- Three *dou* of glutinous millet rice,
- Three *dou* of mixed grains,
- Seventy twisted pastries,
- Thirty-five thin pancakes,
- One *dou* of wheat rice,
- One *dou* of fermented soybeans,
- One *dou* of millet rice,
- One *dou* of polished rice,
- Five *dou* of rice.
- Four mirrors, with four bamboo stands, each three *chi* in length.
- One large platter,
- Thirty-two sheets of paper,
- One *jin* each of five-colored mineral pigments.

The above items may be adjusted according to abundance or scarcity. Food offerings are arranged on the trays.

**Ritual Method:**
In the courtyard of the house, mark out a square altar two *zhang* and four *chi* on each side. Open the Heavenly Gate, Earthly Door, Human Gate, and Ghost Gate at the four cardinal directions, each marked with arrows. Enclose the altar with three layers of cords corresponding to the colors of the directions. Place two lamps at each gate, one lamp before the officiant’s table, and arrange seats for the deities of the five directions at the center of the altar. Place colored silk and coins on the blue seat (east). The following seats are arranged:
- North: Stove Lord’s seat (black),
- South: Southern Deity’s seat (red),
- East: Eastern Deity’s seat (blue),
- West: Western Earth Deity’s seat (white),
- South: Merit Officer and Registrar’s seat (red),
- North: Direct Attendant’s seat (black),
- West: Elder of Auspicious Stability’s seat (white),
- East: Attending Official’s seat (blue).

Each of the twelve earthly branches in the four corners has its own seat with a fine mat. The five directional deity seats and the Direct Attendant’s seat each have a food tray, while the remaining seats have one tray each. Arrange five incense burners, five-colored silk, and coins according to the generative numbers of the Five Phases:
- East: eight items of blue,
- South: seven items of red,
- West: nine items of white,
- North: six items of black,
- Center: five items of yellow.

For nobles of marquis rank and above, use five-colored precious jades; for ministers and officials, use stones (measured in *jin* or *liang*). For nobles, silk is measured in bolts; for high officials, in *zhang*; for scholars and commoners, in *chi*. Coins: nobles use a thousand, high officials a hundred, scholars and commoners ten. Alternatively, place five metal dragons in the five directions: wheat in the east, millet in the south, rice in the west, beans in the north, and millet in the center.

Five *chi* south of the altar, set one mat and one table for the officiant, with a towel covering the table. Enter and exit through the Earthly Door in the southeast.

First present the ritual silk, then the food offerings. Burn incense, bow twice, and sit briefly.

**Invocation (the ordained ritual master sits without bowing):**
"On this day, month, and year, in the such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, [Name and Title] respectfully selects this auspicious day, observes purification and reverence, cleanses the inner and outer spaces, purifies the altar, and prepares the offerings. With fragrant incense, ritual silk, and fresh offerings now complete,

We reverently invite the Eastern Household Deity, the Blue Earth General, and all attendants of the east—*jia-yi* and *yin-mao*—clad in blue, to descend upon this eastern seat.

We reverently invite the Southern Household Deity, the Red Earth General, and all attendants of the south—*bing-ding* and *si-wu*—clad in red, to descend upon this southern seat.

We reverently invite the Western Household Deity, the White Earth General, and all attendants of the west—*geng-xin* and *shen-you*—clad in white, to descend upon this western seat.

We reverently invite the Northern Household Deity, the Black Earth General, and all attendants of the north—*ren-gui* and *hai-zi*—clad in black, to descend upon this northern seat.

We reverently invite the Central Household Deity, the Yellow Earth General, and all attendants of the center—*wu-ji*, *chen-xu*, *chou-wei*—clad in yellow, to descend upon this central seat.

We reverently invite the deities of *Qian* and *Kun*, *Zhen* and *Xun*, *Kan* and *Li*, *Gen* and *Dui*; the Four Cardinal, Four Intermediate, and Four Seasonal Months; the spirits of the year, month, day, and hour; the Punitive and Virtuous Stars; the Conjoined and Opposed Forces; the Grand Year, Grand Yin, and Great Generals; the Gate Guardians and Door Wardens; the Well and Stove Spirits; the Hidden Dragons; the Courtyard and Hall Officers; the Seven Household Deities; and all yin-yang officials and attendants—to take their places, receive our sincere devotion, and partake in joy and celebration. Your disciple bows twice and respectfully petitions."

Next, present the incense, tea, and wine.

"Respectfully addressing the Five Directional Household Deities, the Five Earth Generals, and all officials within the household: Your disciple, [Name], has long dwelled in this residence, sheltered by the blessings of Heaven and Earth, existing as an ordinary mortal. We rely on water and fire for sustenance and depend on grains for life. Since residing here, time has passed, and years have accumulated. We have enjoyed peace and prosperity, ever grateful for your protection. Yet in recent years, misfortune and depletion have struck. Young and old among us have fallen ill, men and women have suffered inexplicable afflictions, and the Five Pestilences and Six Deathly Spirits have gathered within this house, refusing to depart.

Today, in accordance with the sacred methods of the ancient sages, on this auspicious and propitious day, with a pure heart and mind, we have swept the courtyard, burned incense, and prepared the ritual space. We humbly invite the divine spirits, confess our transgressions, and seek your forgiveness. We pray for your blessings and protection. We now present these cakes and fruits, all fragrant and pure, as offerings to the Five Directional Household Deities, the Five Earth Generals, and all officials within this household. May you all deign to descend and partake in these offerings. Your disciple bows twice and respectfully petitions."

Next, we offer incense and present wine. We humbly address all the divine spirits:

This disciple’s household may have, from its very foundation—when first the pillars were raised and beams set in place—through renovations and alterations over time, or through relocation and reorientation, offended the royal deities. Or perhaps through marriages, burials, or other rites, we have acted against the household’s proper alignment or convenience. Within these walls, there may have been killings that defiled the dwelling’s form, or curses and imprecations that incurred transgressions. All these have led to offenses against the prohibitions of the four directions, eight quarters, heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the myriad officials; against the qi of the Five Earths and the spirits of punishment and depletion. They may have violated the lives of men and women, young and old, or the lives of cattle, horses, and the six livestock. Wherever we have dwelt, we have borne worry and fear.

Today, we present these modest offerings to confess our transgressions and present these various items to pacify all the spirits. We pray that you bestow upon us your finest blessings and grant us your boundless grace. May all offenses be absolved and dispersed, our household’s people enjoy health, and pestilential toxins be kept at bay. May we receive harmony from heaven above and favor from the earth below. May the Azure Dragon guard the left, the White Tiger reside on the right, the Vermilion Bird shield the front, and the Dark Warrior defend the rear. May the Five Phases find their proper places, the Four Kings secure their directions, and the dragon spirits stand guard. May malevolent qi vanish, thieves and bandits be repelled, and disasters and calamities be averted. After this rite of absolution, may ten thousand blessings descend in auspicious abundance.

This disciple bows twice and respectfully petitions.

We offer incense and present wine once more. We earnestly address the divine lords:

Today, this disciple offers these rites with a sincere heart. We pray that the divine officials universally bestow their grace and protection. We humbly request the Five Directional Attendants to drive away from this household the Five Depletions, Six Exhaustions, flying corpses, malevolent spirits, seasonal pestilential qi, internal and external afflictions, wandering ghosts of travelers, and all forms of hostile or fatal influences—banishing them a thousand li away. If the earth’s royal harms or black-haired spirits within this dwelling have stirred, may they be subdued and extinguished.

We invite the Azure Dragon to descend and guard the east of this dwelling, dispelling all green-colored disasters of the east.
We open the Wood Gate to summon the five grains, gold, silver, and treasures to enter.

We invite the Crimson Dragon to descend and guard the south of this dwelling, dispelling all red-colored disasters of the south.
We open the Fire Gate to summon silks, brocades, and treasures to enter.

We invite the White Dragon to descend and guard the west of this dwelling, dispelling all white-colored disasters of the west.
We open the Metal Gate to summon gold, jade, rare treasures, and wealth to enter.

We invite the Black Dragon to descend and guard the north of this dwelling, dispelling all black-colored disasters of the north.
We open the Water Gate to summon fish, salt, cattle, horses, and treasures to enter.

We invite the Yellow Dragon to descend and guard the center of this dwelling, dispelling all yellow-colored disasters of the central palace.
We open the Earth Gate to summon money, fabrics, and treasures from the four quarters to enter.

May the Five-Colored Divine Dragons suppress the Five Directions. After this rite of offering and absolution, may the household deities be pacified, the Gate Marshal and Door Warden safeguard the household’s entrance, and all malevolent spirits be restrained, prevented from approaching. May misfortunes be dispersed, blessings and prosperity be summoned, and this disciple’s dwelling be secured for a hundred years. May men and women be wise and virtuous, the old and young fundamentally auspicious. May slanderous and malicious speech sink into the Nine Yin. May all members of this household, high and low, constantly partake in the Five Fortunes. May we be safeguarded by heaven’s emoluments and enjoy long life. May the six livestock flourish, the five grains ripen abundantly, wealth and resources converge, granaries and storehouses overflow. May official ranks ascend, silkworms and mulberries thrive, descendants prosper, and the household flourish. May the entire family receive your protective grace, and for generations to come, bear the virtue of the divine spirits. May our wishes be fulfilled and your vast grace be bestowed upon us.

This disciple bows twice and respectfully petitions.

Next, we scatter food offerings outside the altar to the four directions.

We earnestly address and express gratitude thrice, and the feast is abundant. O luminous deities, may you each return to your original abodes. May the household deities each settle in their proper places. We pray that you leave your grace and bestow blessings, just as we have petitioned.

We bow twice.

The rites concluded, we gather the offerings from the Five Directions and bury them at the five quarters of the dwelling. The food from the gate and door positions is buried beside the main gate’s pivot. The remaining dishes are scattered as food offerings.

The Orthodox Unity Rite for the Household Pacification is now complete.
