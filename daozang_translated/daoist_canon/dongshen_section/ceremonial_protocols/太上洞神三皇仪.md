### **The Supreme Cavern-Spirit Three Sovereigns Ritual: The Rite for Conferring the Three Sovereigns’ Covenant and Registers**

When ascending the altar to recite and chant, circling the three altars three times, each circuit completed, the master faces east to activate the incense burner.

Next, the master again pinches incense and summons the officials according to protocol. Then the memorial is read:

At the time of ascending the altar, all documents, tablets, and slips to be conferred are arranged in order upon the altar table.

[The supplicant states:] From [such-and-such] prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, a Daoist of the Celestial Master’s [such-and-such] *qi*-Orthodoxy, whether male or female, holding the office of *Shengguan*, *Zhenren*, *Xiansheng*, or *Furen*, named [so-and-so], aged [such-and-such] years.

Kneeling in reverence, I humbly beg for grace and present this plea: born of flesh and womb, of the lowly insect and ant kind, yet blessed by accumulated fortune, my form was raised beneath the Great Yang. By fortunate encounter with this enlightened age, I was instructed by venerable masters, steeped in the Mysterious Wind, bathed in numinous grace, and entrusted with the registers of the *qi*-Orthodoxy. Further, I was granted the *Zhenfu* (True Talismans), bearing this profound favor with utmost gratitude. Though unworthy and dull of wit, I aspire to advance rather than retreat.

I have learned that in high antiquity, the celestial charts, talismans, and covenants of the Three Sovereigns were transmitted, embodying the Way of deathlessness. Those who study them ascend as immortals and attain the rank of *Zhenren*. Now, having prepared the requisite offerings for the fast and sacrifice, I respectfully present these tokens of faith and humbly submit this memorial for your august consideration.

May the illustrious and compassionate Dharma Master deign to pity all who earnestly seek the Way and bestow your vast grace upon me. Should you condescend to grant this boon, my withered bones shall be revived.

Respectfully submitted on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month in the year of [such-and-such] *Tai Sui*.

**Offerings:**
- White silk: forty feet
- Gold: three taels
- Silver: three taels
- Cinnabar: two taels
- Rice: five *dou*
- Firewood: two bundles
- Hand towels: nine
- Knives: nine
- Washing basin and tray: one each
- Yellow plain silk: forty feet
- Gold rings: six pairs
- Crimson damask: thirty feet
- Silver rings: one pair
- Vermilion: five *jin*
- Purple silk: forty feet
- Green silk: five taels
- Yellow cloth: eighty feet
- Yellow paper: one hundred sheets
- Yellow brushes: one pair
- Gold knife: one
- Five Directions’ colored silks: thirty-nine feet (east: green, nine feet; south: crimson, three feet; west: white, seven feet; north: black, five feet; center: yellow, twelve feet; all patterned)

**The above twenty-one items** are the ritual tokens for receiving the *Three Sovereigns’ Dharma Register*. If any are lacking, note the deficiency; if all are present, proceed with the decree. Should additional partial transmissions be sought afterward, they may be granted according to the supplicant’s wishes.

From [such-and-such] prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, a disciple of the Celestial Master’s [such-and-such] *qi*-Orthodoxy, named [so-and-so], aged [such-and-such] years, styled [so-and-so], of the household of [male or female] official [so-and-so], and under the tutelage of [male or female] Daoist official [so-and-so].

**Five guarantors, jointly signing:**

The first, a student of the Dao pursuing longevity, yearns for immortality, cultivates stillness in seclusion, and rejects worldly glory. Now presenting the ritual tokens, he seeks to receive the inner texts of the *Three Sovereigns* and requests transmission according to the Dharma.

### **Memorial Text:**

To the *Tai Xuan Du* (Supreme Mystery Capital), the *Zhengyi Pingqi* (Orthodox Unity, Balanced *Qi*) lineage of the Celestial Master, and the Daoist of the [such-and-such] *qi*-Orthodoxy, who administers the affairs of the *Cavern-Spirit Three Sovereigns Scripture*:

Your servant, the *Zhenren* of [such-and-such] Sacred Peak, [so-and-so], bows twice and respectfully submits:

According to the documents, your servant, a petty and benighted one of the six defilements, has by fortunate encounter with this enlightened age been permitted to dwell at the lowest rank among the Daoist community. Charged with proclaiming the truth and selecting the seed-people, yet dull of wit and inept in propagation, I have achieved no virtuous results and bear shame before the August Unity. Reflecting upon myself, I confess:

Though but an insect or ant, from youth I scorned worldly pursuits, my aspiration fixed on cultivating the body and dwelling in mountain caves. My nature is sincere, and I dare not feign adornment. Having received the hidden and secret Dharma of the immortals—scriptures, talismans, and charts—I have accumulated years of practice. Though I have not yet retired to the mountains in silent seclusion, since receiving the Dao, I have averted calamities, dispelled misfortunes, and attracted blessings. A hundred wishes have been fulfilled, and the efficacy has been proven. It is fitting to propagate the great transformation and align with the August Ultimate.

Now there is [male or female] official [so-and-so] from [such-and-such] prefecture, county, and village, who delights in the Dao and cherishes life, admires purity and emptiness, meditates on the inner teachings, and rejects vulgar customs. He has entrusted himself to the mountains and rivers, savoring the Dao and imbibing the Dharma, gathering and ingesting divine medicines, abstaining from grains to cultivate life. His sincerity is truly commendable. Now he presents this memorial to my *qi*-Orthodoxy, seeking to receive the inner texts of the *Three Sovereigns* that I have been granted.

I dare not conceal the lofty and wondrous teachings to preserve my own purity and truth. Thus, I hereby transmit them to [so-and-so].

After receiving these texts, he shall examine his body and mind, uphold the secrecy of the Dharma, and dare not lightly disclose it. Whether ascending peaks, entering abysses, crossing seas, or fording rivers, the thousand spirits and hundred demons, dragons and monsters, shall all be subdued and obey his commands. He shall summon them to appear instantly, command the myriad spirits, refine the golden elixir and divine mushrooms, and generate true *qi* spontaneously. Whatever he wishes in his heart shall be fulfilled without seeking, and he shall attain long life and enduring vision, becoming a *Zhenren*.

When this memorial reaches the celestial bureaus, may it be proclaimed to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; the Five Peaks and Four Waterways; the Three Rivers and Four Seas; the Eight Poles; the sacred mountains and famous waters; the deities of the ten directions and eight quarters; the myriad spirits of the world; and the true officials of the altars and states. May they all infuse their *qi* and take note: wherever [so-and-so] travels, all shall honor and obey him as a great token of faith. For all the thousand sins and myriad transgressions he committed before receiving the Sovereigns’ texts, may he be granted absolution.

Imploring the Supreme One to discern and pity this humble servant’s folly, I respectfully entrust this red memorial, bearing the name of [male or female] official [so-and-so] and the inner texts, talismans, charts, and covenants of the *Three Sovereigns*, to the following officials—each twelve in number—to be conveyed to the Three Celestial Bureaus, awaiting their proclamation:

- The Direct Envoys of the Two Officials
- The *Zhengyi* Merit Officers
- The Left and Right Palace Envoys
- The *Yin-Yang* Divine Decision Clerks
- The *Gangfeng* Courier Clerks
- The Memorial-Conveying Steed Clerks
- The Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks

Your servant [so-and-so], trembling with awe, bows twice and respectfully submits this memorial.

Your servant, of the [such-and-such] surname, affiliated with the [such-and-such] Prefecture-County Abbey for the burning of incense and cultivation, respectfully addresses the August Jade Terrace of the Seven Treasures of the Grand Clarity.

In the year of the Great Year [such-and-such], on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, having received the covenants, talismans, charts, seals, transmissions, and oral instructions, and having completed the presentation of the memorial, the texts of the covenants and contracts are read aloud.

One is called the Jade Contract, the other the Gold Covenant—so named for their engraving, so distinguished by their division.

**The Three Sovereigns’ Covenant Text**

In the year of the Great Year [such-and-such], on the first day of the [such-and-such] month, the cyclical day *jiazi*, in the village of [such-and-such] Prefecture-County, [male or female] disciple of the [such-and-such] surname, aged [such-and-such] years, who delights in the Dao and cherishes life, whose essence aligns with the Six Spirits and whose destiny accords with the arcane and essential, now with sincere devotion presents [himself/herself] before the [male or female] Perfected of the [such-and-such] Sacred Peak, [such-and-such] by name, to seek the transmission of the Three Sovereigns’ inner texts, celestial writings in great script, charts, transmissions, covenants, and bamboo talismans.

Respectfully following the divine charts and texts of the *Great Possession* and *Lesser Possession*, the celestial registers of the Heavenly Sovereign and the terrestrial records, which govern all spirits, summon the hundred ghosts, command dragons and dispatch Perfected Ones, seal and oversee the Five Peaks, and supervise the sources of rivers—these are reported above to the great deities of the Celestial Capital of the Supreme One, the Supreme Elder, and the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate, who bestow the scriptures and administer the oaths, all in accordance with the original texts.

The upper aspiration is for soaring transcendence; the middle, for prolonged years; the lower, for emolument, rank, and wealth. Naturally, one offers plain silk and casts gold, pledging with cinnabar in eternal covenant.

On the [such-and-such] month, after purification and announcement, on an auspicious day and propitious hour, with no wind, no rain, no clouds, no dust, the Five Peaks array their positions, the Twenty-Five Spirits and the Seven Ancestors attend the alliance. Swearing before the Nine Heavens, whatever is summoned arrives at once; before the Sovereigns’ presence, metal and stone open, and misfortune and rebellion dissolve.

Should one violate the alliance or betray the covenant, the transmission shall not endure a full year. Should the worthy or foolish be misaligned in their reception, transgressing the celestial texts, the body shall enter the Wind Blade, the corpse be severed in the Dark Springs, and the Seven Generations of parents be examined by the Water Officials.

Your servant [such-and-such] now respectfully transmits the original texts of [such-and-such] former master.

**The Catalogue of the *Great Possession* Charts and Scriptures is as follows:**

- *Cavernous Spirit Scripture*, Scroll the First: *Great Possession Registers and Charts, Inner Texts of the Heavenly Sovereign*
- *Cavernous Spirit Scripture*, Scroll the Second: *Great Possession Registers and Charts, Inner Texts of the Earthly Sovereign*
- *Cavernous Spirit Scripture*, Scroll the Third: *Great Possession Registers and Charts, Inner Texts of the Human Sovereign*

- *Cavernous Spirit Scripture*, Scroll the Eighth: *Scripture of the Mysterious Transformations of the Eight Emperors*, Part Two
- *Cavernous Spirit Scripture*, Scroll the Ninth: *Scripture of the Mysterious Transformations of the Eight Emperors*, Part Three

- *Cavernous Spirit Scripture*, Scroll the Thirteenth: *Rituals of the Three Sovereigns’ Court Audience*
- *Cavernous Spirit Scripture*, Scroll the Fourteenth: *Rituals of the Three Sovereigns’ Transmission*

The above fourteen scrolls are now transmitted to [such-and-such]. Solemnly swearing before the celestial and terrestrial deities, the sun, moon, and stars, the arcane charts and registers of the *Great Possession* and the august texts, the great deities of the Nine Heavens’ True Immortals’ Celestial Capital, the myriad spirits of the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, all mountains, rivers, and sources, and the Twenty-Five Spirits—all attend the alliance to assist and protect [such-and-such]’s person. By the divine talismans and registers of the *Lesser Possession* and the true texts, may [such-and-such] ascend in flight.

The Lords of the Five Peaks, having received the talismans to perform their duties, must not transmit them recklessly. Having drawn one mark in cinnabar, the oath is reported to the Three Officials, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Celestial Capital.

[Male or female] disciple of the [such-and-such] surname, from the village of [such-and-such] Prefecture-County, presents [himself/herself] before the [male or female] Dharma Master of the [such-and-such] surname, in [such-and-such] place, to receive the Three Sovereigns’ celestial texts. Offering the pledge of sincerity and observing the purification, they swear the cinnabar alliance.

[Such-and-such], having received the Dao, must harbor no duplicity or doubt, and shall uphold the master’s oath. Should one be unfilial, unkind, disloyal, or untrustworthy, recklessly transmit to the unworthy, speak with forked tongue, achieve the Dao and then betray the master, reveal the true teachings, or spread falsehoods in the name of the Dao—such acts, commonly witnessed, are abhorrent. The body shall suffer calamity, and the misfortune shall extend to descendants.

Each shall inscribe by hand, dividing the talismans and covenants for transmission, ensuring they are passed only to the proper recipient. Thus, they jointly draw one mark as a pledge.

[Male or female] Dharma Master of the [such-and-such] surname, in [such-and-such] place, receives [the transmission] from the village of [such-and-such] Prefecture-County.

**The Three Sovereigns’ Scripture Covenant**

In the year of the Great Year [such-and-such], on the first day of the [such-and-such] month, the cyclical day *jiazi*, [male or female] Daoist of the [such-and-such] surname, aged [such-and-such] years, from the village of [such-and-such] Prefecture-County, presents [himself/herself] before the [male or female] Dharma Master of the [such-and-such] surname, in [such-and-such] place, to receive the Three Sovereigns’ scripture covenant.

Upon concluding the reading of the covenant, it is spread upon the board. The master holds the vermilion brush above, while the disciple grasps it below, and together they draw one mark. Having drawn the mark, the brush is set aside.

The master commands the disciple to grasp the knife handle, placing the blade directly upon the matching character. Drawing the knife, the master splits the covenant in two, then each half is bound with silk threads and set upon the table. The disciple holds a pair of rings, while the master wields the small knife to carve them. First, the left is carved as the master calls the taboo name of the Heavenly Sovereign, and the disciple repeats the name after the master. Next, the right is carved as the Heavenly Sovereign of Earth’s taboo name is called. Then, the center is carved as the Human Sovereign’s taboo name is called. After the three carvings are complete, each ring is threaded through the covenant, secured with a small silk cord, and both are placed upon the table. If this initial table lacks space, another cloth may be used to place them to the left or right of the first table.

Once the rings are threaded, the disciple unfolds the Three Sovereigns’ scripture and prostrates to examine it, while the master recites it aloud to transmit it to the disciple. The disciple repeats after the master. The pronunciation is found in the fourth scroll; when the ritual is performed, it is taken out and read, then placed upon the table. The large characters are opened according to the method of the Sovereigns’ scripture, and once complete, each scroll is placed into its pouch and set upon the table.

Next, the Three Generals of the Yellow Woman are transmitted. The disciple prostrates as the master recites the Yellow Woman’s divine talisman, concluding with the reign title and the decree. Then, the Three Sovereigns’ Generals are transmitted. Following the text to the end, the disciple repeats after the master, then places the scroll into its pouch and sets it upon the table.

Next, the Nine Sovereigns’ Diagram is transmitted. The master reads aloud the characters within the diagram from beginning to end. The disciple repeats after the master, consulting the scripture as needed, and once complete, places it upon the table.

Next, the taboo names are transmitted. The disciple repeats after the master as the characters within the Taboo Gate are read. Then, the Inner Essence Talisman is invoked:

*"The Heavenly Sovereign governs qi,
The Earthly Sovereign governs spirit,
The Human Sovereign governs life.
The ten thousand spirits guard my body,
Enabling me to ascend as a flying immortal,
To behold the Sovereign Lords,
And ascend to the Immortal Capital,
The Gate of the Nine."*

The disciple likewise repeats after the master to its conclusion. The covenant, one *cun* square, is then placed into its pouch.

The mouth of the pouch is sewn and sealed on the right.

Next, the *Nine Heavens Mobilizing Troops Flying Ascension Talisman* is transmitted. Without incantation, one holds the breath facing the talisman, silently reciting the Three Sovereigns’ taboo names, then exhales. The covenant and talisman are placed into the pouch.

Next, the *Ascension to Heaven Covenant* is transmitted. The *Ascension to Heaven Covenant* has two texts: the abridged version omits dragons and the like, but the four-part division and the principle of wearing it remain unchanged. When first transmitting the Three Sovereigns, the earlier version is divided. This text is intricate, its characters separated and recombined to form passages. Through meditative visualization and spiritual resonance, the divine perfected beings descend to bestow it, commanding the disciple to follow the master in reciting the oral instructions as follows:

*"To enter the mountains and live in seclusion, one may also receive the latter version, which does not conflict with the former. Wear each according to its instructions.
Ascending to heaven, registering on earth—why delay immortality?
The Numinous Sovereign delights in my Eightfold Might of Heaven.
Speak not, consult not—prepare your body.
Silently receive at the Gate of Yin Wind.
Thunder roars, lightning howls, waters surge forth.
Sitting or rising, look around and return to the root of life.
Dragon and tiger exhale and inhale, refining essence and primordial qi.
The Celestial Well opens and closes; the Jade Pavilion hears.
Small stars enter and exit like sword shapes.
Firmly distinguish and seek immortality."*

First, the eastern blue-green text is transmitted:
*"Exalted Sovereign, Flying Sovereign, Numinous Sovereign, Ancestral Sovereign,
May you protect and prolong the spirit and form of so-and-so."*

Next, the vermilion text:
*"If you wish to transcend calamity,
Jade mushrooms grow upon the earth.
With accumulated merit above,
You shall surely surpass mortal form,
Separately inheriting the virtue of Wood,
First ascending to the Sovereign’s court."*

Next, the black text:
*"The Great Dao, the Supreme Perfected,
Diligently study and practice.
The Heavenly Master divides the covenant with you,
The Three Ones bring tranquility.
At the Gate of the Great One,
May you transcend warfare.
Pray for longevity,
Cultivate the Dao and attain immortality."*

Next, the oral instructions for receiving the covenant:
The master commands the disciple to rise and bow to each gate, one bow and one salute. Then, outside the *Great Radiance Luminous Gate*, four bows are made to the *Great One*, *Three Origins*, and *Four Perfected*.

Next, prostrating on the ground, the master ascends the altar, faces north, and bows before the scripture at the center of the *Great Staircase*. Paying homage to the *Supreme Thearch*, facing north, the master presents the blue-green silk memorial, then prostrates again to await a response. For partial transmission, this blue-green memorial is required. Its text resembles the yellow memorial; if a comprehensive transmission is given on the first day with a yellow memorial, the blue-green one is no longer needed. Thereafter, rising slowly without presenting a memorial, the master bows twice and stands.

The master summons the disciple and leads them into the *Great Radiance Gate* (also called the *Blazing Southern Gate*). Circling the *Great Staircase* once, facing north, the disciple bows twice to the *Supreme Lord of the Great One*. Next, facing north, six bows are made to the *Three Sovereign Lords*. Turning east, the disciple pays homage to the *Thearch Lord* with two bows. Then, turning east again, the disciple bows nine times with nine salutes to the *Jade Thearch of Supreme Clarity* and the *Nine Sovereign Lords*. Turning south, the disciple pays homage to the *Southern Culmen, Supreme Origin, Supreme Flourishing Lord* with two bows. Turning west, the disciple bows once each to the *Thearch Lord’s Consort* and the *Three Masters’ Consorts*. In total, eight bows and eight salutes are performed.

Next, turning west, circling back east to face south, then turning north, the disciple bows twice, prostrates, and listens for the response. For partial transmission, a *Great Thanksgiving Petition* is used; for comprehensive transmission, the *Great Thanksgiving Petition* follows later. The master returns to the altar, divides the covenant, and performs the rites. Next, four bows are made to the *Four Perfected*. Then, exiting through the *Moon Gate*, the disciple circumambulates the altar three times. This is the ritual of pacing the void and chanting hymns of praise.

If the comprehensive transmission is not yet complete, the thanksgiving to the *Four Perfected*, exiting through the *Moon Gate*, and pacing the void are omitted. The master holds the covenant, and the disciple holds the knife and saw, breaking it as the master commands. First, the *Sun-Moon Union* is broken, then the *Celestial Gate Union*. The eastern inscription is first worn on the body, followed by a golden dragon. A blue-green cord binds the dragon, attached to the back of the covenant, which is then placed in a purple-lined pouch and set upon the table.

Next, the southern inscription is placed in the residence, followed by a jade tiger. The western inscription is placed in the mountains, followed by a golden button. The northern inscription is placed by the river, carried by a stone horse. The inscriptions for the three directions are also placed upon the table. Once all matters are concluded, they are disposed of according to the later text: buried in the residence, mountains, or sunk in flowing water.

Next, the inner text of the *Numinous Writ* is transmitted, with the hymn:
*"The upper grotto’s one hundred eight characters
Reveal the root of the Primordial Beginning.
The Three Sovereigns’ era was vast and wild,
Thus they lived among beasts in herds.
Transforming at the dawn of the Yellow Thearch,
They selected the worthy of the Three Powers.
Elevating the Eight Mysteries as aids,
Cang Jie, most sagely and divine,
With four eyes, keen and wise,
Skilled in writing and drawing.
Once written contracts were established,
Eons were counted in kalpas.
Used to teach and transform,
Each kalpa had its covenants.
Gradually, wisdom increased,
Each diligently recording names.
Proclaimed and expanded,
The reckoning became a dharmic wheel.
Without benevolence, sagacity, and wisdom,
How could the origins of the Three Powers be distinguished?
Thus, the worthy transmitted records,
Scattered across mountains, seas, and fords.
Wondrous! Most wondrous!
Who knows the immortal among immortals?"*

This concluded, it is placed into the pouch and set upon the table.

Next, the inner text of the *Cinnabar Writ* is transmitted:
*"Three Sovereigns, Eight Thearchs,
Treasure this inner text.
Cultivate without laziness,
Ever remain among the seed people.
When fate departs, conceal yourself,
Transform from white to black, ascend to mystery.
Immortals do not die;
Respond to resonance and they arrive.
Coming and going are constant;
Those who know are enlightened.
Recognize the True One,
Remember taboos and record names."*

This concluded, separate oral instructions are transmitted, then placed into the pouch and set upon the table.

Next, the *Thirteen Talismans of Eight Might and Five Victories* are transmitted:
*"One who knows the Eight Might
Shall never decline among the ten thousand.
The talismans of the Five Thearchs
Summon traveling kitchens at will.
All spirits follow in attendance,
Hastening before and behind.
The Way of talismans is natural;
Their efficacy is immediate.
I instruct the ten thousand:
Embody and practice this.
Born to honor the Dao,
Ascension may be anticipated.
Ten thousand, doubt not;
Diligence shall attain it.
Five and eight unfold in use—
Thirteen talismans in all.
I earnestly instruct you:
Secretly and diligently cultivate.
The Dao is transmitted to its proper recipient;
I too shall not be remiss.
The chapters and gates are profound;
Roam with me."*

This concluded, they are placed into the pouch and set upon the table.

Next, the *Three Sovereigns’ Inner Taboo Boards and Hymns* are transmitted. First, the upper board is read, with the characters for "ghost" to "statutes" pronounced differently. Then, the middle board text is read, followed by the lower board text. This concluded, they are placed into the pouch and set upon the table.

Next, the *Three-One Inner Taboo Boards* are transmitted—upper One, middle One, lower One. This concluded, they are placed into the pouch and set upon the table.

Next, the *Register of the Divine Youth* is conferred. For those receiving the full transmission, no separate petition is required; the ordination proceeds as usual. The register’s talismanic decree is read:

*"The myriad beings of Heaven and Earth,
Governed by the imperial will of Dao,
Receive the scripture of the Supreme Perfected.
None may depart from it;
The divine talismans shall take effect.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes of the Most High Lord Lao!"*

Next, the *Precepts for Ordination and Ordinance* are administered—these are drawn from the scriptures at the time of use, and their length precludes repetition here. For those receiving the full transmission, no separate declaration of merit is required; after giving thanks, they recite the precepts and review the register themselves.

Next, the *Nine Heavens’ Talismanic Contracts* are conferred, with the talismanic decree pronounced as before.

Next, the *Nine Heavens’ Seal* is transmitted. The disciple bathes in a decoction of five fragrant herbs, then dusts the seal with cinnabar powder, brushing it smooth and clean before placing it upon the table. No separate declaration of merit or offering rite is required.

Next, the *Bamboo Messenger Talisman* is conferred, with the words:

*"Officers of the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus of Yin and Yang,
Subdue the hundred evils!
Behold my form,
Behold my ten thousand spirits,
Within and without—hear my command!"*

This concluded, the talisman is rolled and placed into a bamboo tube, its mouth sealed with cinnabar wax and stamped with the seal. It is set upon the table, and no separate petition is made.

Next, the text on the *Transmission Board* is recited as follows:

*"How thickly the purple clouds gather,
Scattering numinous radiance across the Nine Heavens.
East and west align with south and north,
Through refined cultivation, the old form is transformed.
Outwardly, one may appear withered,
Yet within, pure truth is contained.
[Name], let the golden effulgence guide you—
Within Heaven, there is yet another Heaven.
The numinous Dao alone is wondrous,
Silently entering the profound.
The Way of cherishing life harmonizes with essence;
Condense the spirit, disperse the qi, and the nine apertures shine.
Do not indulge the self and lose the subtle mystery."*

This concluded, the lower board’s text is conferred. Upon completion, the boards are handed to the disciple, who places them within their robe, aligning the upper board properly. They are bound together with blue silk, and both ends are sealed with cinnabar wax. The master takes the seal and stamps the boards, with the seal’s characters facing outward. The disciple then holds them reverently.

Next, the master administers the transmission decree. Facing the altar, the disciple knocks their teeth together twelve times and recites the invocation:

*"The Heavenly August Thearch governs life,
The Earthly August Thearch erases the ledger of death,
The Human August Thearch dispels calamity and misfortune.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes!"*

This concluded, the transmission robe is folded and placed upon the table. If a devout household later seeks aid for illness, the decree is administered as above, and the boards are hung upon their door. Once the misfortune is averted, they are returned. If the affliction does not recede within three or nine days, the boards are sent back, and a separate purification rite is performed to seek efficacy.

Next, the *Three Sovereigns’ Titles* are expounded:

**First: The Heavenly August Thearch’s Inner Learning of Characters.**
*Characters* signify *intent*. They enable one to gaze upward at the celestial script, awakening the heart to discernment—abandoning evil, embracing good, cultivating diligence within, and refraining from ostentation without. The enlightened guide those who follow, and later generations emulate their predecessors. In this mutual succession, affairs enter the numinous Dao, and spirit and body become one—attaining undying longevity.

**Second: The Earthly August Thearch’s Inner Record of Scriptural Texts.**
*Texts* are *gateways*. With inner learning clarified and intent upright, free from delusion, one extends aid broadly, ascending through the gateway to the ultimate.

**Third: The Human August Thearch’s Inner Texts.**
They elucidate how humans observe the patterns of Earth, emulate Earth to accord with Heaven, stabilize the inner and pacify the outer—universally delivering the boundless, converging at the Mysterious Gate, all through the fruits of learning.

This concluded, the essential precepts are conferred. Thus ends the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Numinous Three Sovereigns’ Rites*.
