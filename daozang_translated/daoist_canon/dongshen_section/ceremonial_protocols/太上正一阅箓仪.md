### **The Supreme Orthodox Unity Register-Inspection Rite**
Compiled by Du Guangting, the Master of Broad Accomplishment

For all who receive the Orthodox Unity registers, the rites shall be performed on days of *jiazi*, *gengshen*, one’s life-destiny day, the Three Origins, the Three Assemblies, the Five La Festivals, the Eight Nodal Days, and the last and first days of the lunar month. On these days, the celestial *qi* announces renewal, the radiance of Yang dispels darkness, all virtues are made new, the heavenly spirits descend in full, the earthly spirits emerge in full, the water spirits arrive in full, the Great Unity takes its seat, and the seed-people are selected. Their merits and transgressions are examined, life and death are determined, and names are inscribed in the Golden Towers.

On such days, Daoists and seed-people must purify themselves, enter the oratory in fasting, and at the hours of *mao* and *you*, burn incense and prepare twenty-four portions of wine and fruit—or sixteen, twelve, or eight portions—ensuring all is solemn and immaculate. First, the register is unfurled upon the table. Donning fresh, cool garments and having bathed and rinsed, they then enter the chamber to offer incense and focus their intent, following each step precisely without omission.

The order of rites is as follows:
First, recite the **Entrance Incantation**;
Next, offer incense at the **Cave Table**;
Then, offer incense at the **Primary Table**;
Next, recite the **Incense Incantation**;
Then, bow to the master and meditate as prescribed;
Next, strike the **Ritual Drum** twenty-four times;
Then, recite the **Furnace-Opening Incantation**:

*"Supreme Mystery-Origin, Five Numinous Venerable Lord, summon now the Merit-Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Messengers of the Three Qi Orthodox Spirits—hasten to report and transmit! To the Three Heavens’ Supreme Mystery-Origin Dao Lord, your servant now enters the oratory to burn incense. On this assembly day—the Upper Assembly on the seventh day of the first month, the Middle Assembly on the seventh day of the seventh month, the Lower Assembly on the fifth day of the tenth month—faithfully following the Celestial Master’s canonical rites, I inspect the Orthodox Unity Alliance-Awe Precious Register bestowed upon my person. May the life-*qi* of the Eight Directions’ Orthodox Perfected descend and flow into my body. May this petition swiftly ascend before the Supreme Perfected, Boundless Great Dao, the Jade Emperor, and the August Emperor of the Most High."*

Bow thrice after each recitation.

Next, declare the ritual rank:
*"From the Great Mystery Capital, Orthodox Unity, Level-*Qi* System, Celestial Master of [X] Treatment, [X]-Qi Red Heaven’s Three-Five Step-Net Destiny Perfected, your servant [Name], humbly petitions the Most High Pure Mystery-Origin, Boundless Three Heavens’ Supreme Great Dao: the Supreme Dao Lord, the Supreme Venerable Lord, the Supreme Elder, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, the Heavenly Emperor Elder, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine-*Qi* Elder, the myriad layers of Dao-*qi*, the Twelve Hundred Official Lords, and the August Presence beneath the Jade Terrace of the Great Clarity.*

*Though unworthy and foolish, I have received the profound transformation of the Great Dao. As the Dao bestowed its methods and the Orthodox Unity flourished, I was graced by my revered master with the transmission of the secret registers—*Extending Life, Transcendent Flight, Three-Five Grade Scriptures*—to inwardly rectify body and mind, harmonize and pacify spirit and *qi*, and outwardly ward off calamities, suppress misfortunes, and repel pernicious influences. May the superior immortals and numinous marshals, the generals, officials, and merit-officers within the precious registers, each according to their office, protect my body and life, regulate the Six Palaces, calm the Hundred Passes, ensuring that malevolence and misfortune do not intrude, the Three Corpses fall away, the Nine Worms perish, the Nine Ancestors and Seven Generations ascend to heaven and attain the Dao, deliver all beings, broadly aid heaven and humanity, assist the state in its time, establish merit for all things. On each assembly day, may my merits be reported and my rank advanced. I vow to uphold these practices eternally, never betraying my oath of devotion. Humbly beseeching the Great Saints of the Three Heavens and the Venerable Hosts to regard my sincerity and ever grant me grace and forgiveness."*

Your servant, a humble reed of lowly quality, has fortunately encountered this millennial opportunity, prostrating to receive the precious register bestowed by the revered master, restraining the heart and cultivating the body to guard against excess—such grace is boundless.

Your servant, having received the registers of the Upper Immortals and Supreme Spirits, along with their subordinate generals, merit-recorders, envoys, true officials, lords, generals, jade lads, jade maidens, soldiers, clerks, and troops, beseeches them to act according to their respective duties, transmit commands and convey truth, propagate the essentials of the Dao, establish merit to aid the state, practice transformation to save people, instruct the deluded and ignorant, and encourage the good and virtuous. Should any subordinate officials harbor malevolent qi or rebellious intent, or if there be ominous officials, slanderous tongues, or evil persons plotting to harm your servant, may the left and right officials and envoys immediately report to the Heavenly Offices without concealment. From year’s end to year’s end, from month’s end to month’s end, from day’s end to day’s end, from hour’s end to hour’s end, cycling without cease, may they act in accordance with the method, defending and protecting your servant’s body, delivering from calamities and hardships, ensuring longevity and enduring vision, with the heart-spirit settled and stable. Wherever your servant goes, may truth be embraced, and in all travels and destinations, may metal and stone open, water and fire assist. Beneath the covering of august heaven, upon the bearing of august earth, within the illumination of sun and moon, through the passage of mountains and rivers, may the hundred evils be subdued, the myriad spirits obey, the hundred passages flow with moisture, the five viscera generate fluids, true qi descend upon the body, refining form and transforming substance. When merit is accomplished and virtue complete, may your servant ascend to heaven in broad daylight, timely reporting merits without betraying trust.

Your servant, a late and shallow learner, further burdened by foolishness and dimness, having perused the generals, clerks, soldiers, officials, generals, and troops, fears they may not conform to ritual propriety or align in proper order, accumulating a thousand transgressions and ten thousand errors. Humbly beseeches pardon and forgiveness, extending to those yet to awaken, that no punishment be meted. Your servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows twice in prostration.

Upon completion, swallow qi three times.

Next, knock the teeth three times in succession, then kneel lengthily and pray:
Your servant has concluded the register’s perusal. May the transcendent immortals, celestial spirits, functionaries, envoys, generals, clerks, and soldiers just summoned all return into your servant’s body, entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, resuming their respective positions—those on the left returning to the left, those on the right to the right—resting securely in the golden hall and jade chamber. Let the functionaries and envoys take charge of their oversight, ensuring no disorder in the protective encirclement, that it may enfold and envelop without breach, boundless as heaven and earth. When summoned again, may they arrive as before, in accordance with precedent.

Next, address the incense burner:
Incense officials and envoys, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, attendant spirit-officials of incense, may this place where your servant peruses the register in quietude naturally generate golden fluid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and the assembled host of a hundred numinous perfected, all converging here before the incense burner. May what is here proclaimed ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Jade Emperor, the August Thearch.

Bow three times.

Next, chant the *Hymn to the Study of Immortality*.

Next, exit the chamber and recite the spell:
The rite of the Orthodox Unity register-perusal is now complete.
