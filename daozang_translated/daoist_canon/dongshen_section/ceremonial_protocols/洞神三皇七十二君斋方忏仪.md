**The Nine Celestial Lords of the Eastern Heavens**
We have heard that when primordial *qi* congealed in the void, the Nine Heavens suspended their signs. They inaugurated the four seasons, and the eastern wind issued from *Zhen*; they disseminated the Five Constants, and the transformative power of *ren* advanced with spring. They initiated the triad of luminaries and presided over the inception of the myriad beings.

Now, the Emperor, in accordance with Heaven’s transformative power and employing the Dao to rectify the times, aligns his virtue with the warmth of *yang* and his brilliance with the radiance of the sun and moon. In strict observance of the ritual codes, he presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, reverently invoking the Nine Celestial Lords of the Eastern Heavens, the Year Star of Wooden Virtue, the Azure Dragon of the Seven Mansions, and all stellar officials within and beyond.

May these meritorious deeds descend from the Nine Heavens of the Eastern Prime, the Jasper City of the Dawn *qi*, and the Nine Radiant Mists, to come and assist the Emperor’s person. During the three months of spring, in the positions of *jia*, *yi*, *yin*, *mao*, and *chen*, should there be dimmed red stars, earthly nets and celestial snares, clashes with the native year or the primal *chen*, or any misfortunes and calamities, may all be swept away.

May names be inscribed on the jade tablets of the Azure Palace, and years be added to the Emperor’s span. May the Two Modes harmonize, the Seven Luminaries shine with constancy, winds and rains arrive in season, warmth and coolness follow their proper order. May the house flourish and the state prosper, distant regions be pacified and near ones secure. May all officials and commoners, within and without, together partake in felicitous blessings. After attaining the Dao, may he unite with the Celestial Lords in perfection.

**The Nine Celestial Lords of the Southern Heavens**
We have heard that the Cavernous Void congealed its efflorescence, and the Cinnabar Heavens unfolded their transformations. They activated the Fire Virtue, and the radiance of *yang* suffused all; they disseminated civil brilliance, and the teachings of ritual spread afar. Lofty, they arrayed the Nine Layers; below, they oversaw the Southern Culmen.

Now, the Emperor, endowed with felicity from Heaven, rectifies the times and descends into the world. His virtue encompasses divine martiality, and the hearts of the Eight Directions turn toward his transformative power. His Dao accords with pure harmony, and the myriad states rely on his revivifying grace.

In strict observance of the ritual codes, he presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, reverently invoking the Nine Celestial Lords of the Southern Heavens, the Sparkling Deluder of Fiery Virtue, the Vermilion Bird of the Seven Mansions, and all stellar officials within and beyond.

Through these meritorious deeds, may they descend from the Nine Heavens of the Southern Prime, the Vermilion Radiance of the Cinnabar Terrace, and the Three Suspended Lights, to come and assist the Emperor’s person. During the three months of summer, in the positions of *bing*, *ding*, *si*, *wu*, and *wei*, should there be earthly nets and celestial snares, dimmed red stars, inauspicious mansions clashing, the native year, or any misfortunes and declines, may all be released and dispersed.

May longevity be inscribed in the Southern Palace, names be recorded on the cinnabar tablets. May the merit of enriching the state endure forever, and the registers of long life shine anew. May the palace chambers flourish, distant and near regions feast in peace. May felicity inherit the mountains and rivers, and blessings suffuse the armies and the people. After attaining the Dao, may he unite with the Celestial Lords in perfection.

**The Nine Celestial Lords of the Western Heavens**
We have heard that when the pure and turbid separated their forms, *yin* and *yang* established their positions. When autumn arrived, the *qi* of the Nine Heavens grew solemn; when the Metal Phase advanced, the winds of the Four Seas turned clear. They settled the Five Constants in righteousness and perfected the myriad beings in their functions.

Now, the Emperor, responding to the mandate and emerging in his time, rectifies the era and disseminates his virtue. His transformative power harmonizes, and the seas and lands turn toward his influence; his achievements are lofty, and Heaven and Earth share in his merit. Ever revering the mysterious codes, he secures the state and the realm.

In strict observance of the ritual codes, he presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, reverently invoking the Nine Celestial Lords of the Western Heavens, the Grand White of Metallic Essence, the White Tiger of the Seven Mansions, and all stellar officials within and beyond.

Through these meritorious deeds, may they descend from the Nine Heavens of the Western Prime, the Luminous Pavilion of Pristine Efflorescence, and the Seven Flowing Lights, to come and assist the Emperor’s person. During the three months of autumn, in the positions of *geng*, *xin*, *shen*, *you*, and *xu*, should there be earthly nets and celestial snares, dimmed red stars, inauspicious mansions clashing, the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, or any misfortunes and declines, may all be released and dispersed.

May the Sages of the West inscribe his name upon the Seven-Treasure Golden Gate, and the Lofty Perfected of the Highest extend his years in the Jade Registers of the Three Clarities. May the Eight Winds harmonize, the Five Grains ripen in abundance. May blessings cover the state and felicity suffuse the armies and the people. After attaining the Dao, may he unite with the Celestial Lords in perfection.

**The Nine Celestial Lords of the Northern Heavens**
We have heard that the Cavernous *yin* congealed its transformations, and the Northern Culmen assumed its honored place. Vast and boundless, the Great Loftiness governs the myriad heavens in their vastness; limpid and wondrous, the numinous nature disseminates the manifold kinds in their generation and completion. The Dao crowns the Three Clarities, and wisdom pervades the myriad beings.

Now, the Emperor’s name towers above the ages, his virtue extends to the Four Barbarians. He perpetually upholds the merit of rectification and salvation, harmonizing with the fortune of ascending peace.

In strict observance of the ritual codes, he presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, reverently invoking the Nine Celestial Lords of the Northern Heavens, the Chronographic Star of Watery Virtue, the Dark Warrior of the Seven Mansions, and all stellar officials within and beyond.

Through these meritorious deeds, may they descend from the Nine Heavens of the Northern Prime, the Dark Palace of the Mysterious *yin*, and the Five Flying Mists, to come and assist the Emperor’s person. During the three months of winter, in the positions of *ren*, *gui*, *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*, should there be clashes with the native year or the primal *chen*, dimmed red stars, earthly nets and celestial snares, or any misfortunes and declines, may all be released and dispersed.

May he beseech the Jade Capital to turn its gaze and the Golden Portal to bestow its grace. In the Forest of Seven Treasures, may the tally of pine and cypress-like longevity increase; within the Palace of Five Brilliances, may the auspicious omens of simurghs and phoenixes descend. May the myriad transformations be pacified, and the palace chambers rejoice together. After attaining the Dao, may he unite with the Celestial Lords in perfection.

**The Nine Earthly Lords of the East**
We have heard that when the Great Clod divided its forms, the earthly realm established its ultimate bounds. The waves of the Four Seas surge boundlessly, their depths unfathomable; the boundaries of the Eight Extremities stretch endlessly, their vastness unsearchable.

Now, the Emperor, in strict observance of the ritual codes, presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, reverently invoking the Nine Earthly Lords of the Eastern Lands, the Sovereigns of the Eastern Marchmount, mountains and rivers, hills and mounds, plains and marshes, streams and valleys, and all numinous beings. He repents and offers thanks for all transgressions from the founding of the state to the present day—whether in dwelling or movement, untimely digging or excavation, the opening of mountains and rivers, the expansion of foundations—disturbing the profound earth and offending the August Lords. He deeply fears that offenses have accumulated in the *kun* quarter, calamities have arisen in the celestial divisions, portents have not ceased, and illnesses have multiplied.

Now, with wholehearted devotion, he turns toward the Great Dao, takes refuge in the Supreme Emperor, and entrusts his fate to the True Sovereign. He establishes the Three August Ones’ Precious Retreat, enacts the rites of the Cavernous Spirit, and prays for wind in harmony and rain in season, seas calm and rivers clear, yin and yang balanced that all transformations may be at peace, the Dao and virtue flourishing that the Great Stair may be serene. May the emperor’s essence be pure and his harmony complete, his years as enduring as metal and stone, his six viscera ever regulated, his hundred passages all unobstructed. May his entire court and kin constantly preserve good fortune and integrity, and all officials and people within and without long abide in felicity and blessing. After attaining the Dao, may he unite in truth with the August Lords.

**Southern Quarter, Nine Lands**
He has heard that the resplendent sun establishes its image, the Nine Lands dwell in the south, the courtyard of flowing fire runs deep, and the celestial pool’s waves stretch wide. On the purple precincts of Xiaoqiu, the register of long life may be sought; in the crimson towers of Zhuling, the names of accumulated goodness are recorded. Now the emperor, in strict observance of the ritual codes, presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, reverently invoking the Nine Earthly Lords of the Southern Lands, the Sovereigns of the Southern Marchmount, mountains and rivers, hills and mounds, plains and marshes, streams and valleys, and all numinous beings. He repents and offers thanks for all transgressions from the founding of the state to the present day—whether in dwelling or movement, untimely digging or excavation, the opening of mountains and rivers, the expansion of foundations—disturbing the profound earth and offending the August Lords. He deeply fears that offenses have accumulated in the *kun* quarter, calamities have arisen in the celestial divisions, portents have not ceased, and illnesses have multiplied. Now, with wholehearted devotion, he turns toward the Great Dao, takes refuge in the Supreme Emperor, and entrusts his fate to the True Sovereign. He establishes the Precious Retreat, observing all ritual forms, and prays that yin and yang be harmonized, borders be tranquil and secure, unicorns and phoenixes manifest auspicious signs, and tortoises and dragons bring forth felicitous omens. May the emperor’s virtue match the mountains and peaks, his auspicious clouds broadly cover the Nine Dusts, his transformative influence pervade the realm, and his harmonious qi universally nourish the myriad things. May his entire court and kin constantly preserve good fortune and integrity, and all soldiers and people within and without together partake in felicity and blessing. After attaining the Dao, may he unite in truth with the August Lords.

**Western Quarter, Nine Lands**
He has heard that the *kun* element initiates beginnings, the profound earth bears all things, high and low take form, east and west assume their positions, the autumn wind stirs and all things are made solemn, and yin virtue accomplishes its work. Auspicious omens flow from Phoenix Ridge, and transformations unfold from Tortoise Mountain. Now the emperor, in strict observance of the ritual codes, presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, reverently invoking the Nine Earthly Lords of the Western Lands, the Sovereigns of the Western Marchmount, mountains and rivers, hills and mounds, plains and marshes, streams and valleys, and all numinous beings. He repents and offers thanks for all transgressions from the founding of the state to the present day—whether in dwelling or movement, untimely digging or excavation, the opening of mountains and rivers, the expansion of foundations—disturbing the profound earth and offending the August Lords. He deeply fears that offenses have accumulated in the *kun* quarter, calamities have arisen in the celestial divisions, portents have not ceased, and illnesses have multiplied. Now, with wholehearted devotion, he turns toward the Great Dao, takes refuge in the Supreme Emperor, and entrusts his fate to the True Sovereign. He establishes the Precious Retreat, observing all ritual forms. He prostrates himself and prays that boundless compassion bring vast salvation, that radiant blessings descend from afar, that auspicious mists spread across ten thousand *li*, and that propitious qi emanate from the nine heavens. May wind be harmonious and rain timely, the year abundant and the seasons mild. May the emperor’s blessed destiny be prolonged, his spirit protected, his emoluments as boundless as the azure sea, and his years as enduring as Mount Song and Mount Hua. May his imperial sons and grandsons enjoy heaven’s eternity and earth’s permanence. After attaining the Dao, may he unite in truth with the August Lords.

**Northern Quarter, Nine Lands**
He has heard that the north extends to the watery marshes, the depths of wind and earth, the first yang stirs and all things know spring, the four seasons complete their cycle and the yin grasses return to their places. Earth’s numbers end at thirty-six, and the realm’s boundaries extend three thousand *li*. Mountains rise to embrace Fengdu, and lands open to Kunlun’s expanse. Now the emperor, in strict observance of the ritual codes, presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, reverently invoking the Nine Earthly Lords of the Northern Lands, the Sovereigns of the Northern Marchmount, mountains and rivers, hills and mounds, plains and marshes, streams and valleys, and all numinous beings. He repents and offers thanks for all transgressions from the founding of the state to the present day—whether in dwelling or movement, untimely digging or excavation, the opening of mountains and rivers, the expansion of foundations—disturbing the profound earth and offending the August Lords. He deeply fears that offenses have accumulated in the *kun* quarter, calamities have arisen in the celestial divisions, portents have not ceased, and illnesses have multiplied. Now, with wholehearted devotion, he turns toward the Great Dao, takes refuge in the Supreme Emperor, and entrusts his fate to the True Sovereign. He initiates the establishment of the Precious Retreat, observing all ritual forms. He prays that the four seasons follow their proper order, all things be born whole, wind and clouds long accord with auspicious signs, and drought and flood never become disasters. May the emperor’s virtue match heaven and earth, his Dao unite with Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor. May his blessed court extend to the Eight Extremities, his realm of longevity ascend to the Seven Governors. May his house and state flourish, far and near be tranquil and secure. May all officials and people within and without together partake in felicity and blessing. After attaining the Dao, may he unite in truth with the August Lords.

**Repentance to the Great Unity**
He has heard that the primordial qi of the Three Origins and the Great Unity, the August Spirit, divided the clear and turbid to establish the Two Modes, and moved yin and yang to generate the myriad things. His numinous perception universally turns, and his mysterious merit broadly spreads. Now the emperor, in strict observance of the ritual codes, presents incense, flowers, lamps, candles, and all requisite offerings, establishes the Precious Retreat of the Cavernous Spirit and the Three August Ones’ Seventy-Two Lords, and reverently invokes the Great Unity, August Lord, the Nine August Jade Emperors, the Perfected Saints of the Boundless Realm, and all numinous beings. He universally repents all transgressions of past and present lives, the faults of the six senses and three karmas, and prays that all be cleansed and eradicated. May the Eastern Florescence augment his endless years, and the Southern Culmen inscribe his name in the register of long life. May his merit tower over ten thousand ages, and his rank be listed among the heavens. May true qi descend upon his bodily palace, preserving grand harmony in the repository of his nature. May mountains and rivers be equally steadfast, metal and stone equally enduring, his realm tranquil and secure, his house and state blessed and prosperous. After attaining the Dao, may he long enjoy the natural.

The rites of repentance for the Cavernous Spirit and the Three August Ones’ Seventy-Two Lords’ Retreat are now complete.
