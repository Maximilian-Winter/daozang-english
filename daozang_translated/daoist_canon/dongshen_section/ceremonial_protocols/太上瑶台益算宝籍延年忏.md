---

With reverence, we invoke the august names of the Jade Capital and the sacred texts of the Golden Towers. To uphold them is to eternally preserve distant longevity; to venerate them is to perpetually draw upon supreme longevity.

Here, the incense burners condense emerald mists, and candles illuminate crimson lotuses. We recite the wondrous sounds of the *Lingbao* scriptures, gazing upon the Most Holy of the Void and Nonexistence.

Thus, the Three Primes gather blessings, and the Eight Festivals beseech grace. At the appointed hour of the Moon Palace, the jade bells of Heavenly Treasures resonate in stillness; at the dawn of the Star Altar, the jade chimes of the Jasper Pool sound softly.

We raise the Dharma’s voice, chanting the drifting celestial hymns. With one hundred and fifty prostrations, we invoke the sagely titles of the Heavenly Worthies; in response to a hundred thousand myriad layers, the imperial wisdom of the Milky Way descends.

By the potent power subtly bestowed, the ninefold-refined Golden Elixir augments one’s lifespan; through the vast workings of mysterious compassion, the Jade Registers of the Three Clarities elevate one’s destiny.

We humbly entreat the High Emperor of the Purple Palace and the Most Holy of the Clear Capital, that their flourishing may endure like the pine and cypress, their fragrance rivaling the orchid and cassia. They grasp the Crimson Axe in their palms, casting a white radiance upon their crowns.

True immortals assemble in celebration, as the secret talismans of extended years shield the body; dragons and tigers bestow blessings, as the numinous talismans of life preservation ward off calamity. Longevity swells like the Five Peaks, and fortune arises from the Ten Directions.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge and pay homage.

**Devoutly, we take refuge and submit our lives.** For each honored one, first recite: *"Devoutly, we take refuge and submit our lives,"* then intone the sacred title of the Heavenly Worthy.

The rites of offering and cultivation are now complete; we reverently pray to the deities and express our gratitude.

In seeking to widely explore and profoundly revere, we have specially exhausted our utmost sincerity. Desiring to pursue the extraordinary cause of longevity’s continuation, we humbly rely upon the Dao’s transformations of the Mysterious Origin. Thus, we gaze upward at the sagely images and personally face the numinous compassion. We know that lifespan can be augmented and immortality can be learned. Earnestly hoping for sagely grace, may the divine luminaries descend upon auspicious omens; reverently entrusting ourselves to the vast primordial qi, may creation subtly bestow its protection and guardianship. The incense smoke rises in verdant mists; the lamps burn with the brilliance of red lotuses. Through this, we initiate our reverent practice and extend our morning obeisance. A single strike of the Penglai bell resounds, and the melodious tones of the immortal grottoes’ terraces are heard everywhere.

We prostrate ourselves and pray: may you descend upon the ritual arena riding the rainbow banner and arrive at the jeweled realm following the iridescent pennants. May the human world’s calendrical years be ever renewed like the phoenix’s chronicle; may the time within the alchemical crucible be eternally secure like the tortoise’s longevity. Grant us the essentials of the Nine Palaces and transmit the texts of the Six Jia. May all within the four seas and eight directions universally attain long life and enduring vision.

We bow our heads to the Supreme Void’s Most High, Correct, and True Three Treasures.

The *Jade Terrace Longevity Register’s Ritual of Extended Years* is now complete.
