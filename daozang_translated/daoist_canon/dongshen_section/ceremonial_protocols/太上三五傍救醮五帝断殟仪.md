When a household suddenly encounters celestial disasters or dire calamities, and its members suffer from swellings and sores lasting one to five days, this arises because the Five Thearchs’ divine attendants fail to protect the residents, or because neighbors from the four directions have been afflicted by contagion. All such cases stem from the epidemic demons of the heavens—Li Ziao of the Clouds, Zhang Yuanbo, Liu Yuanda, the Wuhuan ghosts, and the like—who bring sickness to the household. If a family is stricken by celestial seasonal epidemics, the affliction will recur once within three years.

On the appointed day of the offering, select an auspicious date and invite a Daoist priest to perform the rites at the residence. If possible, conduct a divine incantation retreat for one day and two nights, or three days and three nights. If this cannot be arranged, simply invite one priest to perform the Five Thearchs’ Offering. The required items, listed in detail below, are as follows:

- Genuine frankincense (with "nipples"): one tael and a half, for six censers.
- Six-sided altar table, five brushes, five ink sticks, five segments of five-directional silk (each in its corresponding color).
- Five hand towels, each four feet and two inches long.
- Five trays of life-and-fortune rice, each holding one *dou* and two *sheng*.
- One *dou* of wine, forty cups.
- Five portions of offering money, each portion one hundred and twenty *wen*.
- One bundle of paper: five sheets for spirit money, five sheets for stabilizing the altar.
- Forty portions of offering cakes, walnuts, dried jujubes, dried fish, venison jerky, and seasonal fresh fruits.
- One bowl of *maoxiang* infusion.
- Twelve lamps.
- Six peachwood tablets, each one foot one inch long and two inches wide.

The master’s position is in the north. After knocking the teeth thirty-six times, enter the altar and perform the purification rite.
Next, seal the demon gate.
Next, recite the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*.

Next, the *Incense Burner Activation Rite*—the disciples, properly adorned in ritual vestments and sashes, stand before the purification altar with reverent devotion. They make obeisance, offer incense, and await communion.

On this day, the [X]th year of the [Era], the [X]th month, the [X]th day of the lunar cycle, we, your humble disciples of the *Dongyuan* tradition, [Name] and others, respectfully address the following on behalf of disciple [Name]:

We invoke and beseech:

The Lords who sweep away misfortune and pacify the six viscera,

all your exalted seats, accept this humble offering and heed the talismanic decree above and below.

We summon and address:
The great deities of Heaven and Earth,
The immortal officials of the Five Emperors,
The local earth deities and true officials of this place,
The water emperors of the Nine Rivers,
The twelve stream maidens,
The river lords and water officials,
The seven deities of the underworld,
The lords of the earth and the Five Marchmounts,
The Four Watercourses,
The protective officers of humanity,
The masters of added years,
The left and right transmitting officials,
The Lords of absolved transgressions,
and all spirits—
each holding jade tablets, attend to the words from our mouths.

For years, your disciple [Name]’s household has suffered misfortune in dwelling, with family members afflicted by sores and swellings, deaths uncounted, enterprises thwarted, official rank stagnant, desires unfulfilled, and calamities arising without cause. Divination reveals omens of ill fortune, all due to malevolent *qi* from the eight directions and four quarters, along with epidemic ghosts, demonic soldiers, and the eight classes of demonic forces violently harming the good. At every door, only the wails of the dead are heard, never the strains of refined music. Grief and lamentation abound, with many wrongfully stricken. What we see and hear is far from auspicious. Day and night, we are filled with dread, with nowhere to turn.

We have heard that the Most High Lord Lao established the teachings, bestowing them upon the immortals, who in turn transmitted to the mortal realm the great and wondrous Dharma for slaying demons and reviving the living. Today, we have erected an altar here, presenting offerings of wine and dried meats, the full array for the Five Emperors, and cast the Nine Divinations. This day is most auspicious, the celestial granary is full. Bright as the sun and moon, equal to the Three Luminaries. A hundred delicacies are arrayed, yet we dare not taste them first. The clear wine and pure meats are sweet and fragrant beyond measure. May the imperial lords accept these offerings and bestow boundless blessings. May our seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, their misfortunes dissolved, enjoying refined music and ranks equal to the immortals. May the living prosper in wealth and nobility, their halls filled with descendants for thirty-six generations. May the departed and the long-deceased ascend to the Southern Palace, abiding in the land of eternal joy and fortune, escaping the Three Wretched Paths and avoiding the cauldrons of boiling liquid. May they forever leave behind the sword trees, frozen beds, and iron couches, never to see the copper pillars, ox-headed or horse-faced guardians. May epidemics and illnesses vanish for ten thousand generations. May the hundred ghosts be gathered and cast into the sun. May disasters disperse and eternal prosperity be secured.

O rulers of the Five Emperors, kings of the myriad spirits, eradicate evil karma and discern the yielding and the firm. Let radiance revive the withered, let words manifest as frost and snow. You can dissolve official misfortunes and banish illness from the sickbed; you can govern the seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer, the celestial round and the earthly square; you can harmonize the *qi* of the four seasons, the five colors and the mysterious yellow, the Three Clarities and the Six Pitches, the seven yielding and eight firm. You shape human form, illuminating all that is dark, shining upon all that is dim.

The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper arrange the constellations:
*Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, Ji*—aligned with the East;
*Jing, Gui, Liu, Xing, Zhang, Yi, Zhen*—aligned with the South;
*Kui, Lou, Wei, Mao, Bi, Zi, Shen*—aligned with the West;
*Dou, Niu, Nü, Xu, Wei, Shi, Bi*—aligned with the North;
[...] aligned with the Center and the Five Phases.

You regulate the cycles of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness, causing:
Metal to overcome Wood, and Wood to break;
Wood to overcome Earth, and Earth to conceal;
Earth to overcome Water, and Water to cease flowing;
Water to overcome Fire, and Fire to lose its light;
Fire to overcome Metal, and Metal to melt away.
You strike and punish ghosts, driving them far away. You heal illnesses, restoring health at once. You seek official rank, aligning with the just and the royal. You pacify the household spirits, making the home steadfast as metal; you direct talismans at ghosts, and they perish; you command spirits to slay demons, and they shatter; you order spirits to cure illness, and the sick rise from their beds; you charge spirits to guard travelers, ensuring their safe passage; you command spirits to protect graves, filling halls with descendants; you instruct spirits to tend fields, filling granaries with the five grains; you dispatch spirits to sever illness, preventing its return.

Let the Nine Heavens be your witness: humanity bears evil karma. Cast it to the eight wastelands, sweeping it from streets, villages, and crossroads, and from within the home of your disciple [Name], where epidemics and jaundice rage. All but our own kin, depart swiftly to distant lands! Command the generals of the hundred ghostly battalions to seize and cast them into the cauldrons. Devour their essence and specters, dissolving their five bodies. By the decree of Lord Lao’s mouth, execute and slay all misfortune—what spirit could remain, what ghost dare resist?

May the imperial lords descend, and ten thousand years of prosperity ensue. In all our comings and goings, may the five spirits lend their aid.

May official calamities disperse and ghostly bandits retreat into hiding—your disciple bows twice in reverence.

Next, offer incense, tea, and wine.
With utmost devotion, we invoke the Five Thearchs: if any perverse spirits, the Five Pestilences, or ghostly *qi* linger—whether concealing their forms, lurking in shadows, transforming endlessly, or refusing to depart—we humbly beseech the Five Devouring Generals to descend. Unleash your mighty power, exhale divine fire to shatter ghostly heads and burn their bodies, extinguishing their very roots. Swiftly, as decreed by the *Nüqing* Ordinance!

For the transgressions of your disciple [Name]—from seven generations past to the present life—innumerable grave offenses have been committed. We implore forgiveness for the sins of your disciple’s ancestors and living kin: the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes of the East, which remain unresolved.
We invoke the Lords of Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, and the Celestial Stems *jiǎ-yǐ*, *yín-mǎo*, *chén*—masters of the East—to absolve and pardon these offenses.

For the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes of the South, unresolved in this life, we invoke the Lords of Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wing, Chariot, and the Celestial Stems *sì-wǔ*, *wèi*, *bǐng-dīng*—masters of the South—to absolve and pardon these offenses.

For the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes of the West, unresolved in this life, we invoke the Lords of Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Turtle Beak, Orion, and the Celestial Stems *shēn-yǒu*, *xū*, *gēng-xīn*—masters of the West—to absolve and pardon these offenses.

For the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes of the North, unresolved in this life, we invoke the Lords of Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, House, Wall, and the Celestial Stems *hài-zǐ*, *chǒu*, *rén-guǐ*—masters of the North—to absolve and pardon these offenses.

For the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes of the Center, unresolved in this life, we invoke the Lords of the Central Dipper’s Seven Stars [text corrupt]—masters of the Center—to absolve and pardon these offenses.

In the third month of spring, when the Green Pestilence and Green Epidemic spirits emerge—seizing upon the ascendant Wood to spread their poisons and harm the innocent—we invoke the White Thearch of the West to strike them down, preventing their wanton destruction.

In the third month of summer, when the Red Pestilence and Red Epidemic spirits emerge—seizing upon the ascendant Fire to spread their poisons and harm the innocent—we invoke the Black Thearch of the North to strike them down, preventing their wanton destruction.

In the third month of autumn, when the White Pestilence and White Epidemic spirits emerge—seizing upon the ascendant Metal to spread their poisons and harm the innocent—we invoke the Red Thearch of the South to strike them down, preventing their wanton destruction.

In the third month of winter, when the Black Pestilence and Black Epidemic spirits emerge—seizing upon the ascendant Water to spread their poisons and harm the innocent—we invoke the Yellow Thearch of the Center to strike them down, preventing their wanton destruction.

In the intercalary months, when the Yellow Pestilence and Yellow Epidemic spirits emerge—seizing upon the ascendant Earth to spread their poisons and harm the innocent—we invoke the Green Thearch of the East to strike them down, preventing their defiance.

May all manner of perverse spirits be subdued and concealed. Thus shall the world know great peace: ghosts and spirits shall not rise, winds shall be harmonious, rains timely, and the myriad people at ease. Overwhelmed by such boundless grace, your disciple bows twice in reverence.

Next, offer incense and wine.
We humbly invoke the Five Thearchs once more: your disciple prostrates himself, kowtowing in supplication. Grant us life upon life, deliverance upon deliverance—lifting the weight of profound calamities. For the sake of your disciple [Name], we beseech you to dispel disasters, pacify wandering souls, secure life and destiny, and heal all afflictions.

May your disciple’s household—young and old alike—be spared from the misfortune of exhausted lifespans or untimely fates. Should their allotted years be cut short by karmic reckoning, we implore you to dissolve these bonds, restore their years, and extend their lives.

If the snares of Heaven’s Net and Earth’s Web entangle their bodies, yet remain unresolved, we beseech the Thearchs to swiftly sever them. May all perverse spirits be annihilated.

Should a hundred ghosts arise wantonly, seizing and tormenting the souls of your disciple’s household—men and women, young and old—causing their spirits to wander restless, we earnestly invoke the Lords of Extended Life, Peaceful Birth, Averting Death, and Future Rebirth from the Five Directions’ Dipper Stars. Gather their wandering souls, restore their *po* spirits, and reunite them with their bodies. Harmonize the Six Palaces.

From the Eastern Dipper, we request extended years.
From the Western Dipper, we request recorded names.
From the Northern Dipper, we request the removal of death.
From the Southern Dipper, we request rebirth.
May the Lord of Souls and the Controller of Destiny pacify their spirits and grant them increased longevity. We invoke the Star Official of Extended Life to erase their names from the ledger of death and inscribe them in the register of life.

Should any inauspicious or rebellious ghosts—whether from Heaven above or Earth below—lurk in your disciple’s home, village lanes, doorways, or thresholds, seeking blood offerings to perpetrate harm, we invoke the Three-Five Generals and their ten thousand officers to descend, subdue demons, and devour ghosts.

We invoke the Three-Five Generals of Pestilence-Devouring, their ten thousand officers descending.
We invoke the Three-Five Generals of Epidemic-Devouring, their ten thousand officers descending.
We invoke the Three-Five Generals of Affliction-Devouring, their ten thousand officers descending.
We invoke the Three-Five Generals of Essence-Devouring, their ten thousand officers descending.
We invoke the Three-Five Generals of Perverse-Devouring, their ten thousand officers descending.
We invoke the Three-Five Generals of Poison-Devouring, their ten thousand officers descending.
We invoke the Three-Five Generals of Bewitchment-Devouring, their ten thousand officers descending.
We invoke the Three-Five Generals of Malevolence-Devouring, their ten thousand officers descending.
We invoke the Five Directions’ Five Thearchs’ Ghost-Slaying Generals, their ten thousand officers descending.

For your disciple’s household, may they unite in purpose and strength to seize and capture:

May all these be seized and bound. May the world know great peace, ghosts and spirits cease their rise, winds and rains harmonize, and the myriad people live in joy. Overwhelmed by such boundless grace, your disciple bows once more.

These ghosts, refusing the commands of the Great Dao’s covenant and the prohibitions of its majestic laws, dwell solely in the human realm, perpetrating their malevolence—causing people to face official calamities, encounter misfortune, fall ill, or meet death, all against reason and principle.

Not being the Celestial Officers of the Five Thearchs, they are each to be seized and bound by their authority. The rebellious and traitorous ghosts shall be delivered to the execution grounds of the cities, their roots and lineages extinguished.

May the world attain purity and tranquility, all people live in peace and joy, the five grains flourish abundantly, and every household—young and old—find their hun and po souls no longer imprisoned in the prisons of the Three Officials (Heaven, Earth, and Water) or the hundred ghosts’ dungeons, nor bound by the fetters of the hundred ghosts. We invoke the Lords of the Five Directions and Five Thearchs, the Lords of the Seven Stars, the Lord of Lifespan, the Lord of Longevity, the Lord of Deliverance from Misfortune and Healing, the Lord of Reversing Death and Restoring Life, and the Lord of Protection and Guardianship. May they secure and stabilize the hun and po of so-and-so, extend their life mandate, augment their years under the Seven Stars, and erase their names from the registers of death.

For the eastern direction’s green afflictions: from this day forth, may the green pestilence be eradicated, and the ghostly qi severed at once.
For the southern direction’s red afflictions: from this day forth, may the red pestilence be eradicated, and the ghostly qi severed at once.
For the western direction’s white afflictions: from this day forth, may the white pestilence be eradicated, and the ghostly qi severed at once.
For the northern direction’s black afflictions: from this day forth, may the black pestilence be eradicated, and the ghostly qi severed at once.
For the central direction’s yellow afflictions: from this day forth, may the yellow pestilence be eradicated, and the ghostly qi severed at once.

Today, as the cyclical sign aligns with our prayers, may blessings tower like mountains, leaving no regrets.
Today, as misfortunes are dispelled and blessings invoked, may disasters vanish, ghostly bandits be annihilated, and felicity overflow.
Today, as the fullness of merit befriends the Thearchs, may all move freely, all affairs bring joy.
Today, as peace and surplus blessings arrive, may the gods descend in majesty, and all wishes be fulfilled.
Today, as heaven and earth join in celebration, may the spirits be sated, and every household free of illness.
Today, as a hundred blessings converge, may wealth and nobility bring delight, with no taboos or hindrances.
Today, as transgressions are shattered and absolved, may the gods descend with fortune, dispelling calamity and misfortune, while the numinous ones arrive in splendor, multiplying blessings and prosperity.
Today, as peril is forever averted, may all prayers after this entreaty be granted.
Today, as sons and daughters attain longevity, may wealth gather, and the five grains flourish.
Today, as every household is freed from sorrow, may gold enter the home, enduring through generations.
Today, as the immortal officials descend together, may true qi overshadow, shielding from disaster.
Today, as the hundred ghosts are sealed and destroyed, may the dwelling be pure and tranquil, ghosts and spirits subdued and stilled.

Next, offer wine and burn incense.
We again invoke the Lords of the Five Thearchs and Seven Stars, along with the immortal officials and their attendants who are to be seated. May all universally partake in the feast.
May blessings descend heavier than Mount Tai, and disasters vanish swifter than lightning.
As fortune follows the gods’ arrival, may the celestial spirits descend in majesty.
Having felt this response in an instant, and completed our reverent thanks, the libations now concluded, we shall not repeat our words nor belabor our speech.

The dragon chariots prepare their reins, the divine steeds hasten to readiness—arriving like clouds in flight, departing like wind and rain.
We welcome the gods from a thousand leagues, yet do not rise to send them off.
From east or west, may each return to their palaces.
Should there be future prayers, may they deign to descend again.

Your disciple, in awe and reverence, bows twice in farewell.
Next, the Hymn of Sending Off the Gods.
Next, the Twelve Vows.

Next, the Hymn of Studying Immortality, dispersed according to the usual rites.
The Most High’s Three-and-Five [Perfected] assist in the salvation rite, the Five Emperors conclude the rite of severing misfortune.
