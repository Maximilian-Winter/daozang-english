*The Ritual of the Manifestation of the Dao and Virtue of the Great Clarity*

**Scripture Title:** *The Ritual of the Manifestation of the Dao and Virtue of the Great Clarity*. One fascicle. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, "Worship and Ritual" category of the *Dongshen* section.

**The Ritual of the Manifestation of the Dao and Virtue of the Great Clarity**
**Offering Longevity and Sacrifices**

Recite the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*, invoke the register of ranks, and declare the officiant’s title:

*"Your servant, [Name], humbly addresses the Most High, the Primordial and Boundless Three Heavens, the Peerless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue; the Holy Mother, the Great Sage of the Prior Heaven; the Primordial Sovereign of the Great Monad; the Lords, Masters, and Elders of the Great Clarity and the Cavernous Spirit; the Ministers, Chancellors, and Governors of the Three Heavens and Four Quarters; the Officials and Clerks of the Celestial Bureaus; and the Perfected and Spirits of the Three Realms.*

*May your vast compassion turn and cast its gaze upon us.*

Your servant has heard: The Great Void is vast and boundless, and above lies the Celestial Realm. The primordial qi is subtle and faint, yet within it abides the essence of the Dao. Gazing upon the realm of the Great Clarity, it is the home of the infinite kalpas. The qi of the Dao spans myriad eons, layered across the vastness of primordial chaos. Here, the lords of this domain number one thousand two hundred, who serve as ministers of creation. From wondrous being to wondrous non-being, it is ever elusive and indistinct. Though the Dao does not govern, its power is manifest through the nurturing of the people; though its traces are unfathomable, its teachings are made evident for the sake of the world.

Your servant, in humble study of the records, presumes to glimpse the sacred and divine. In the ninth year of King Wuding’s reverent reign, on the full moon when the Dipper’s handle pointed to *yin*, it was said that the birth of the Primordial One occurred on this very day. Thus, the celebration of this rite has flourished in the world. Yet this merely expresses the longing of human hearts—how could it truly enhance the radiance of the sagely virtue?

Today, your disciples, [Names], rejoice and revere with deepest devotion, singing praises without end. We open the pure altar and prepare the offering, hastening to the cinnabar steps to raise our cups. We humbly pray that you will not disdain our lowliness but deign to turn your gaze upon us. May the Azure Ox and the Purple Qi appear as they did when crossing the Han Valley; may the White Horse with Crimson Mane descend as on the day of Mount Mao. May the host of perfected ones gather, and a single thought reach you in secret.

Your servants gaze upon the celestial steps, overwhelmed with reverent anticipation. With utmost sincerity, we bow twice and prostrate ourselves, offering this invocation. We beseech the presence of the sages."*

With utmost sincerity and reverence, we humbly invoke:

Descend, O Sages!

With awe and trepidation, we bow our heads and prostrate ourselves, humbly invoking the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Venerable of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue and Power, of the Boundless Great Dao of the Three Heavens of Great Clarity and Primordial Origin.

We reverently await your boundless compassion, that your radiant presence may grace the jeweled throne.

The Celestial Procession

Undaunted by our mortal folly, we presumptuously summon the heavenly retinue. We envision the divine dragons harnessed to your chariot, the celestial steeds clearing the path, the twelve guardian officials leading the way with their cries, and the ninety thousand flying immortals following behind. Banners of tenfold splendor float upon the clouds and mist; the great carriage rings with jade bells, while fans of fivefold brilliance gleam with the light of sun and moon. We draw upon the auspicious omens of antiquity and rely upon the faintest glimmer of your presence in the midst of heaven. Selecting but one marvel from the myriad wonders, we strive to adorn our offering with the utmost magnificence. May the seven treasures of our devotion serve as tokens of our celebratory rites.

We bow our heads and prostrate ourselves, overwhelmed with reverence and awe.

The Hymn of Pacing the Void

The jeweled throne descends upon the golden hall,
Its radiance illumines the jade portico.
Ten thousand Perfected gather at the Emperor’s abode,
Their flying sandals treading the roots of clouds.

We have heard: of old, your immortal form was first bathed in the divine waters. Drawing from the Yellow Flower Pool of the Eastern Well, your hair emanated golden light; pouring from the Flowing Gush Pool of the Western Hua, your body was suffused with jade-like luster. Since the nine dragons first offered their auspicious tribute, this has brought glory through the ages. Now we take up this name and extol its excellence. Extending the lineage of the Spirit Stream, its beneficence knows no end; dividing the afterwaves of the Eastern Well, flying immortals may find refuge therein.

Before the Dao, we humbly present our offering.

The Flowing Grace of the Dharma Source, the Heavenly Worthy

The Offering of Incense

We have heard: within the Dao, incense alone is esteemed. That which issues from the Pure Subtlety is called Liberation—it possesses the power to deliver the hidden and manifest. That which grows in the Grotto of Assembly is named Return to Life—it holds the marvel of reviving the dead and restoring the bones. Yet its efficacy lies not in the substance itself, but in its virtue. We also know that it is not perceived by the nose, but by the heart.

If the fragrance of mortal flowers and trees could suffice, how could the divine immortals of heaven lack such? Yet in ritual, rarity is prized—when the offering is extraordinary, its sincerity cannot be concealed, and thus heaven may receive it. We, your servants, humbly present our offering before the Dao.

**Cloud-Script Celestial Worthy of Fragrant Offerings**

**The Offering of Flowers**

We have heard: in the immortal gardens, myriad blossoms flourish in countless varieties. From the sunlit caverns of Everlasting Day, one plucks the blooms of the Ruo Tree; from the soaring forests of the Dark Garden, one gathers the azure stamens of the Void-Blue. Their lush petals unfurl, and the spirit-winds lengthen the day; their crimson and violet hues glow, and the Dao’s sun melts into spring. These are no common colors or scents of the mortal world—they are fitting for the highest veneration. Placing these jadelike blossoms upon the mat, we pray to bring joy to heaven; transforming them into jeweled canopies in the void, we seek shelter beneath the Dao’s shade. We, your servants, humbly present our offering before the Dao.

**Radiant Jade-Bloom Celestial Worthy**

**The Offering of Candles**

We have heard: though lamps and candles may seem small, they remedy what yin and yang cannot reach. Orchid-oil wicks extend the daylight, exhaling flickering crimson flames; the sun-mirror gathers essence, casting forth radiant vermilion glow. Yet in the immortal realms of the Great Clarity, how could such feeble light be needed? Still, the meaning may lie in repaying the sun’s grace, and thus ritual demands the offering of rows of torches. Our hearts are thus—we seek the enduring brightness of a single flame; the Dao’s power manifests it, illuminating the ten directions with boundless light. We, your servants, humbly present our offering before the Dao.

**Unobstructed Wisdom-Light Celestial Worthy**

**The Offering of Tea**

We have heard: among the wondrous plants of the world, all are the nourishment of the perfected immortals. The Seven-Luminous Stone Fungus, tribute from the Kunwu of the West; the Ten-Knotted Divine Herb, borne from the depths of the Northern Void. How much more do the many medicines of the Dao surpass them—how could mortal tea alone be worthy of admiration? Yet in offering it to the Most High, we duly perform the revered rites. The Penglai Mountains number three—dare we boast of its transcendent wonders? In the Upper Clarity, it ranks first—yet still there are those who seek the elixir to transform their bones. We, your servants, humbly present our offering before the Dao.

**Spirit-Pervading Measure Celestial Worthy**

**The Offering of Wine**

We have heard: when the Great Chariot once journeyed to the Four Limits, the immortals vied to present their longevity cups. The Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea offered the feast of Jade Nectar and Golden Springs; the Nine Heavens’ Lord opened the banquet of Cloud Brew and Moon Essence. Jade blossoms were tribute from Vermilion Mound; sweet dew flowed from the Purple Palace. Recalling the splendor of those bygone days, we renew the rites today. Raising the Northern Dipper, we pour the celestial draught, offering the spring’s joy to the ninefold heavens; brewing the Western River, we craft the wine of longevity, praying all under heaven may share in the intoxication of bliss. We, your servants, humbly present our offering before the Dao.

**Jade-Light Floating Luminance Celestial Worthy**

**The Offering of Fruit**

We, your servants, recall: when the imperial chariot once made its sacred progress, immortal fruits were presented as tribute from the provincial domains. The Queen Mother of the West, sovereign of the Nine Numinous Ones, offered the golden-purple *jiaoli*; the Lady of the Southern Culmen proffered the vermilion-spirit *huozao*. From the east were plucked the mulberries of Fusang; from the north were gathered the gourds of the Hollow Cavern. As we cherish the lingering beauty of those bygone days, we emulate the mortal rites with our humble offering. Though the fruit that takes three thousand years to ripen is not deemed abundant, and the branch that bears for seven hundred years without flaw is scarce, we pray these may be graciously bestowed. We, your servants, humbly present our offering before the Dao.

**Celestial Worthy of Rare and Subtle Savors**

**The Presentation of Vegetable Offerings**
We, your servants, recall: the virtue of heaven and earth requires no form or likeness; the radiance of sun and moon needs no embellishment of painting. How much more does the Great Dao reside beyond names and words, and the Profound Mystery transcend the bounds of thought? Though one may compare it to the sands of ten thousand kalpas, its measure remains unfathomable; how could a single phrase upon these tablets ever suffice to praise it in full? Yet the clouds of dew’s revelation are indeed majestic, and the wind’s blade truly awe-inspiring. Just as rivers and seas do not scorn the smallest streams, trusting in this boundless assurance, so too does the great virtue of heaven and earth daily bestow its blessings without fail. With these sincere words of red devotion, we humbly make them known.

Proclaim the petition, open the passage, return to the origin, and dedicate the merit.
**Manifestation of Ritual Texts**
**Pacing the Void**

Minister humbly observes: To depict the form of the Great Void, even the perfected ones cannot fathom its bounds; to capture the radiance of the sun and moon, even the most skilled artisans cannot render their brilliance. Reverently we consider the Supreme Clarity’s immortal realm, the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue, the Jade Sovereign of the Dao and Virtue. Born before the limitless, emerged above the Great Void, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither sound nor form, uniquely the source of the supreme Dao; able to be long or short, square or round, the unnamed mother of the myriad things. Vastly encompassing the cosmos, subtly entering the finest hairtip. Towering and boundless, beyond all naming; dim and silent, beyond all knowing.

From the primal origin’s first stirring, the mysterious transformation flowed in secret. High and low established the forms of purity and turbidity; movement and stillness governed the bodies of hardness and softness. Wind and thunder, mountains and marshes linked the eight trigrams in mutual generation; spring and summer, autumn and winter turned the four seasons without error. Sun, moon, and stars adorned the heavens above; people and all beings thrived between. Multitudinous and teeming, endlessly transforming—this is how the primordial qi was set in motion to open heaven and earth.

When the Nine August Ones had arisen and dynasties succeeded one another, he descended into the world as teacher, adapting his teachings to the times. He established the great principles and set the records, scriptures becoming the world’s grand canon; he benefited use and enriched life, accomplishing the multitudes’ affairs. This is how he established the human Dao through the ages.

Thereafter he founded the guiding principles of Dao and virtue, creating the methods of purity and emptiness. The sevenfold wondrous scriptures guided beings through the three vehicles; the nine-return elixir formulas were entrusted to advanced practitioners for cultivation. At times he expounded the origins of ritual and music, at others he expounded the teachings of the floating [Buddhist] doctrine. From root to branch, from essence to coarse manifestation, all was complete. A thousand methods, ten thousand gates, yet all converged in a hundred considerations—this is how he established teachings and transformations in accord with the customs of the times.

Extending his form through the three realms, manifesting traces in the ten directions: sometimes illuminating the Pole Star to govern celestial patterns, sometimes concealing his radiance as a pillar of history to assist the state. He pointed to white bones and made them human, saved beings from flood and delivered them from kalpas. Aiding the imperiled, rescuing the distressed, no response failed to reach; delivering the dead, saving the living. Those with karmic affinity who encountered this were delivered across ancient and modern times in measureless numbers.

Thus his numinous power blazes resplendent, his merit and virtue tower sublime. In heaven he is the honored one among the myriad sages; in the world he is the leader of the three teachings. The thirty-six heavens and thirty-six earths all lie within his grasp; eighty-one years and eighty-one bodies first revealed his transformative traces. Neither divine intelligence nor sagely wisdom can exhaust his wonders or plumb his source. Though ten thousand voices and tongues extol him, even through kalpas unending they cannot complete the task; if but a single word or phrase were uttered in description, what benefit would it bring to the Dao?

Now this minister and disciples such as so-and-so, gazing toward the azure sea with spirit flowing, beholding Mount Tai with eyes straining, recklessly and deludedly attempt to offer praise. Taking the sacred titles as their framework, they distilled nine rites; selecting from the immortal scriptures to sing praises, preserving not even one in ten. Only in the depth of their utmost reverence did they fail to notice the crudeness of their words.

We humbly pray that the Dao-heart silently respond, that heavenly insight secretly perceive. Though these trivial and fragmentary words are surely unworthy of notice, yet the vast and boundless measure of the rivers and seas accepts all without exception. Each of us moves with sincere heart, together proclaiming the wondrous model.

Raise, and let each person reverently
With devoted heart bow in homage:
Vast and dim, obscure and silent, darkly merging with the mysterious.
From the beginning, empty and without root, the Great Void as the body of the Dao;
First issuing forth, the primordial qi congealed, the ancestral qi established the root of heaven.
Creating the three powers, unfolding the ten thousand patterns,
Dwelling within the imageless and formless, abiding before the Grand Beginning and Grand Simplicity.
Divine Treasure Venerable, together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.
In the midst of the indistinct and obscure, a form appeared;
Above, no further ancestral Dao to surpass him as honored one.
Embracing and containing creation, moving yin and yang,
Carving and chiseling the formless to establish heaven and earth.
Above assisting the Great Luo’s Primordial Beginning’s transformation,
In the middle propagating the Numinous Treasure Dao Lord’s wind.
Revered dwelling in the Supreme Clarity’s Grand Ultimate Palace,
He is called the Lord of the Great Dao of Non-Doing.
With devoted heart bow in homage:
Breaking open the primordial chaos, splitting the mysterious and the yellow.
The Dao-qi congealed and mixed, from the Great Luo generating the three realms;
The primordial net unfolded, from the ancestral kalpa transforming and giving birth to the myriad heavens.
Above arrayed the nine skies, below divided the three realms,
Establishing the realms of cultivation, founding the sacred immortals’ mysterious regions.
Pervading the great chiliocosm, completing the lineage of the August One.
Lord of the Ten Thousand Heavens, together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.
Ever since the primordial qi flowed in the vast expanse,
From the ancestral kalpa the root of heaven was established.
Five thousand five hundred billion layers of heavens,
Three Caverns and thirty-six divisions of teachings.
Each according to their realm clarifying the stages of cultivation,
All becoming the ranks and grades of perfected immortals.
Heavenly beings, perfected sages, all took him as teacher;
His merit and virtue towering, surpassing ten thousand kalpas.
With devoted heart bow in homage:
Descending in the age of the Nine August Ones to establish teachings,
Entrusting successive generations as teacher.
From Fuxi to King Kang of Zhou,
Spanning more than ten thousand years of the world,
Beginning with Yuhua and ending with Guoshu,
Those called “Master” numbered fifteen.
Embodying the primordial and extending benevolence,
Opening things and accomplishing affairs,
Demonstrating the model for a hundred kings,
Becoming the standard for ten thousand ages.
Teacher of emperors and kings through the ages,
Together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.
The imperial kingly wind established according to the age,
Tongxuan, Pangu, the ancient firstborn.
Yuhua, Guangshou, the great accomplishment named,
Guangcheng, responding to circumstances, the Red Essence titled.
Lu Tu, Wucheng, Yin Shou listed,
Zhenxing, Xize, Xieyi named.
Yu Cheng, Jing Cheng, Guoshu the last—
Through the ages as teacher, this can be recounted.
With devoted heart bow in homage:
Responding to conditions to establish transformations,
Delivering beings according to the kalpa.
The *Dao and Virtue* of five thousand words,
Opening the ancestor of the golden elixir;
The talismanic scriptures of fifteen hundred scrolls,
Transmitting the lineage of the Orthodox Unity.

The teachings emerge from one source yet bear different names,
The Dao flows in parallel without contradiction.
Heaven and humanity look up in reliance,
Immortals and sages find their refuge—
The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious,
Together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.

In his transformed body, the Serene Elder first spread the teaching,
In the Eastern Land, many rulers and ministers found deliverance.
The Dao returned to Wen and Yin to reveal the golden elixir,
The Dharma was entrusted to the Heavenly Master to clarify the Orthodox Unity.
Zhen Duo and Song Lun transmitted the arts of refinement,
Qian Zhi and Gan Ji received the scriptural disciplines.
How many immortals were forged from the dross of the world—
The mysterious wind of ten thousand ages shall never fade.

With devoted heart bow in homage:
Expounding the true essence of the One,
Opening the gate of Non-Duality.
Illuminating the origin of ritual and music,
Clarifying the return of virtue and the Dao.

In the East, the sigh of the ascending dragon arose in Lu,
Where the fruit of Nirvana was established,
And the teachings of the floating *bhikṣu* were expounded.
From the Western Hu came the welcome of the elephant-borne,
Who styled himself the Ancient Firstborn,
And was called the Reclusive Noble One.
Though their names stood like tripods,
Their virtue flowed as rivers.
The patriarchs of the Three Teachings,
Together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.

From the Yin and Zhou dynasties, his traces first appeared,
Through the Xia era, he established his rules and patterns.
Transforming the customs of eighty-one lands,
For nine hundred years, he made the Dao’s transformation manifest.
Confucius heard the wind and became a teacher of ritual and music,
Śākyamuni bowed his head to receive the floating *bhikṣu*.
Thus we know the Three Teachings share a common return—
Later scholars, in their confusion, only bring suffering upon themselves.

With devoted heart bow in homage:
The Dao reaches back to the ancient beginning,
Virtue wondrously merges in the mysterious.
Above, he is the August One; below, the King.
Attaining it, one may govern the self within
And rule the state without—
Nothing is beyond its fitting use.
Embracing the strengths of Yin-Yang, Ming-Jia, Ru, and Mo,
Exhausting the discourse on order and chaos, heaven and humanity through the ages.
Profound and distant, it attains the utmost compliance;
Vast and fleeting, it returns to the Nameless.

The Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue,
Together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.

When the two chapters of *Dao and Virtue* first descended to the world,
The hundred schools’ myriad doctrines all presented their words.
Empty the heart, fill the belly, blend with the subtle and formless,
Return to life’s mandate, guard the mysterious female.
Without action, without desire, return to purity and stillness,
Abide in constant virtue, cherish spontaneity.
Cultivation, ordering, governance, and peace are but its remnants—
From ancient times to the present, immortals have attained it thus.

With devoted heart bow in homage:
Entering the realm of being from non-being,
Entrusting *qi* to form the body.

From the six *qi* of Yudan,
The auspicious lightning—
Its kalpas are beyond reckoning.
Until the five colors of Heavenly Water,
The dream of the pearl—
Only then did his body appear.
First ascending to heaven on the white deer,
Then manifesting in Shu on the green sheep.
Traces beyond traces,
Spontaneous and natural.

The Heavenly Worthy Descending to Birth,
Together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.

A host of immortals bore the sun as they descended from heaven,
Five-colored flowing pearls wove the sacred embryo.
Through eighty-one years, corresponding to the *Qian* trigram,
Born on the fifth day of the third month, matching the Luo numbers.
His surname derived from grasping the plum tree,
Emerging from the dust, he stepped upon the lotus.
Unique in honor above and below heaven,
His countenance and dignity were peerless.

With devoted heart bow in homage:
Transformations without limit,
Miracles beyond measure.

Sometimes as one thousand two hundred,
Lord Lao manifests in the heavens.
Sometimes as one hundred eighty,
The Dao Lord guides the mortal realm.
His titles are not confined to thirty-six,
His names not limited to seventy-two.
Though his Dharma-body fills all,
Like empty space, his wondrous essence—
Originally ever serene and still—
Blends with the ten thousand transformations.

Together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.

His wondrous essence originally returns to the Ultimate One,
A thousand or ten thousand transformed bodies are not many.
In spring, the Supreme Radiance; in summer, the Aged One;
In autumn, the Spirit Light; in winter, the Youth.
In the world, he is called the Fortune Spirit, manifesting as the Dark Warrior,
In heaven, the Star Lord, governing the *Gouchen*.
Like the precious moon in the void,
Wherever there are clear waves, it is seen.

With devoted heart bow in homage:
His merits surpass the ranks of sages,
His virtue crowns the Two Modes.

Spreading kindness, his benevolence is like spring’s growth;
Toward the ten thousand things, he responds to conditions and answers calls.
Like the moon appearing in a thousand rivers,
He rescues suffering from the tiniest speck of dust,
Delivers the multitudes from the vast kalpa.
Father of compassion to the four kinds of birth,
Teacher of benevolence to the three realms.
Limitless in delivering beings,
Together with the Most High Lord Lao, the Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue.

The true parents of all beings in the three realms,
At the end and beginning of kalpas, he delivers heaven and humanity.
Severing evil, revealing signs to destroy Pang Xun,
Relieving illness, extending compassion to revive Guang Ying.
The Hua and Xia, the Man and Rong, all receive his transformation,
Even insects and plants receive his grace.
His divided bodies respond like motes of dust,
His merits and virtues are beyond all praise.

The preceding litany of merits and virtues has now reached completion.
Yet seeking the Great Void in words and images,
How can one perceive its truth?
Exhausting the descriptions of the most exalted virtue,
Its beauty cannot be surpassed.
How can the brush’s limited glimpse capture the wondrousness of the Great Purity?
Fleeting as the leopard’s glance through a tube,
Grievous is the profanation of the dragon’s court.

Having completed this litany of praise,
We trust it will be received with gracious regard.
We, your humble servants, drill and gaze upon the mysterious wind,
Gradually polishing ourselves in its wondrous transformation.
Not that we do not delight in embracing the One and guarding the feminine,
But how can we resist the dust and the rush of the world?
The Dao grows ever more distant,
Our spirits ever more base—
How can we reach the state of inner contemplation?
Our hearts not yet clear,
Desires not yet dispelled—
No way to attain the heaven of constant stillness.
Pity these humble lives,
We stand lost and forlorn.

We only pray that the Compassionate Venerable,
Moved by pity, will specially bestow his Dharma-power,
Lifting us with his strength.
May we repent and sever karmic ties,
Soon escape the net of deep delusion,
Wash away accumulated habits,
And all return to the wind of purity.

The assembly, with utmost sincerity,
Together offers repentance.
Bowing our heads, we take refuge in the Three Pure Ones above,
The Non-Action Teaching Master, the Primordial Venerable.
The Perfected Immortals of the Great Purity of Dao and Virtue,
The Divine Ministers of the Supreme Ultimate Cavern.

We, your servants, since the beginningless kalpa,
Have been obscured by ignorance, greed, and love,
Veiling our true hearts.
Sometimes violating the one thousand two hundred new precepts,
Sometimes transgressing the one hundred eighty great precepts.
Right and wrong, self and others—
False views arise.
Emptiness and form, being and non-being—
We fall into the dust of Dharma.
In the boundless sea of desire, no discipline,
In the surging river of love, no shore.
We regret this body’s lack of constancy,
How often have we paused in the cycle of birth and death?

Bowing before the Great Compassionate Venerable One,
we repent and vow to attain the supreme Dao.
Again we address the assembly of shared karma in this Dao-field:
compose your minds, gather your thoughts, and reveal your true sincerity.
Upholding the Ten Vows, we forge karmic bonds,
dissolving the dust-like myriad sins.

The first vow: may the Sage live ten thousand years;
the second: may the world enjoy universal peace;
the third: may the Dao and virtue ever unfold;
the fourth: may wind and rain come in due season;
the fifth: may the old and young practice kindness and filial piety;
the sixth: may those fated to die young be spared;
the seventh: may the Three Wretched Realms know no suffering;
the eighth: may warfare cease throughout the land;
the ninth: may water and fire bring no harm;
the tenth: may plagues and pestilence not spread.

Sins arise from the mind—repent with the mind;
when the mind is extinguished, sins too vanish.
Mind and sin both empty—
this is called true repentance.

**Dedication**
All that has been offered—homage to the Perfected, confession of faults,
praise of merits—is now complete.
We humbly pray that your compassion not be withheld,
and that blessings be universally bestowed.
May transgressions be erased from the Black Register, sins cleansed like wind-blown dust;
may blessings and longevity be inscribed in the Vermilion Record, the sprouts of goodness growing daily.
For these supreme causes,
with sincere hearts we invoke the Most Manifest Transformative Heavenly Worthy,
whose inconceivable merits are beyond thought.

**Manifest Transformation Ritual of Offering**
Proclamation of the *Guardian Spirit Mantra*, invocation of the ranks of the Dharma.

By the authority vested in this rite,
the Most Manifest Transformation Offering of the Great Purity is performed.

The Libationer, your minister [Name], respectfully addresses:
the Most High Lord Lao, Primordial Emperor of Supreme Virtue,
the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue of the Great Purity,
the Primordial Celestial Empress,
the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One,
the Lords and Elders of the Great Purity,
the Four Assistants and the Elder of the River,
Master Wen Shi,
the Four Phases of the Three Heavens,
the Divine Ministers and Assistants of the Cavernous Mystery,
all the immortal bureaus,
the twelve hundred officials of the Great Purity,
the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens to left and right,
the Dragon-Tiger Lords,
the officials of the Three Realms,
and all majestic spirits.
May your vast compassion deign to look down and perceive clearly.

Your minister has heard:
There is a thing, chaotically formed,
forced to be called the Dao.

Beyond the realm of silence and invisibility, it exists without form or name. Yet within the boundless and indistinct, it bears image and essence, giving rise to all things. From it emerge the myriad transformations of heaven and earth; through it, the cycles of yin and yang and the four seasons attain completion. The ebb and flow of form, color, wisdom, and strength are inexhaustible; the interplay of advance and retreat, existence and extinction, deviance and rectitude knows no end. Without a sovereign governing between them, how could they endure so ceaselessly and eternally?

Only our Primordial One is the Ancestor of the Dao. Mindful that all existence is but an extension of the self, how could it not be upheld? And since all beings arise from the self, how could they be forsaken? Thus, the spirit is dispersed across kalpas, manifesting even in the tiniest speck of dust. As the Teacher of Emperors, the Teacher of Kings, and the Teacher of Lords, it endures through ten thousand generations without weariness. Establishing the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, and the Dao of Humanity, it brings harmony to the Three Powers. Its transformative influence extends to the vast and the minute, its virtue flowing unseen and revealed alike. Though all things return to it, it does not claim mastery—such is the constancy of its power. Though the people benefit from it, none can comprehend it—thus is it called great.

Your minister, a humble scholar of the thatched hut, a mere straw dog among men, has long been graced by the boundless favor of creation, dwelling in the lowest ranks yet sheltered in its shadow. Though I am but a fragment of the Dao, a single manifestation of the One, and though I embody the completeness of yielding submission, knowing the masculine yet guarding the feminine, I have yet to fathom the subtlety of the Valley Spirit. Now, on this sacred occasion of the Primordial Qi’s descent, I recall that these eighty-one bodies are but the full embodiment of the Great Void, and that across seventy billion kalpas, they remain unchanged from the primordial years of the Origin. Though small and lowly, I cannot but reflect on the fleeting nature of this floating life. Moved by the compassion of the Venerable One, who bestows grace upon all sentient beings, may all return to their roots and attain the Dao of longevity. Through cultivation and the verification of practice, may we encounter the era of Great Prosperity.

Your ministers now reverently offer incense and present the first libation.
*First Libation, Proclamation of Words*
In accordance with the ritual text, may these words ascend to the heavens, reaching the ears of the Dao. We humbly beseech your divine compassion to deign to look upon them.

We have heard: That which is natural arises from the Dao, which does not itself generate, yet through which generation occurs—such is the wondrous function of its activity. Though it does not possess, it enables possession; though it does not have, it gives rise to the primal image. Concealed within the empty and vast, it is the perfection of truth, rooted in the Great Nothingness. Beginning without beginning, ending without end, it defies all attempts to describe the affairs of its creation. Neither bound by the present nor the past, how could it be confined to the ages of the world?

Yet in its role as teacher, it takes transformation as its heart, and though it does not shun the mingling of its light with the dust, it reveals its form. In the ninth year of the *chen* cycle during the reign of High Ancestor, when the Shang calendar marked the first month and the Dipper’s handle pointed to *yin*, the sun’s brilliance suddenly doubled in splendor—a sign that a perfected one would appear in the world. Eighty-one years, the ultimate number of the Great Yang; seventy-two marks, the first manifestation of the Primordial Qi. In the northern valley of Li, a radiance shone forth; in the western palace of Shu, its glory flourished. From this, its name became known, and its transformative influence spread. Seeking the Dao from the Primordial Lady, it illuminated the principle that scholars must have a teacher. Concealing its virtue as the Pillar Historian, it revealed the sage’s resolve not to abandon the world. It propagated the profound teachings in the Central Lands and expounded the floating doctrines in the Western Regions. Though the true immortals’ appearances and withdrawals were beyond the ken of the vulgar, their records and transmissions shone clearly, confirmed by the celestial scriptures without doubt.

Your ministers, having heard of these signs in Qiao Prefecture and traced the ancient sites of Lai, now touch the remnants that still endure, lamenting that we were not born in that earlier age. Clutching the cypress of the courtyard, we find the chariot of the wind already distant; bathing in the sacred pool, we strain to glimpse the immortal form. Bowing before the painted image of the Perfected One, it is no different from gazing at the blue sky through clouds; examining the records of its great deeds, we grasp but the faintest trace, like the tip of a hair on Mount Tai. Our hearts are filled with longing, yet our resolve to return remains unfulfilled.

Now, on the anniversary of its descent into the world, we respectfully perform the rites of celebration. Ninefold radiant nectar, white jade and patterned blossoms—we envision the immortals toasting to their eternal longevity. The Three Mysteries’ purple fruits, the crimson trees’ vermilion fruits—we recall the myriad emperors raising their cups in homage. As the banquet in the forest of rarity reaches its height, how could the impure world’s joys compare? Yet the Dao, in its compassion, engages with all things.

Your ministers, moved by reverence and devotion in serving the Dao, offer our sincere intentions, not for the sake of the ritual itself, but for the sincerity it embodies. May the lofty spirits, in their luminous response, accept not the form of our offerings, but the purity of our hearts. Though our gratitude exceeds all bounds, we know not the measure of our presumption.

Your ministers bow twice in reverence and offer the second libation of incense.
*Second Libation, Presentation of the Memorial*
We have heard: In the Great Beginning and the Great Simplicity, there were no images, no forms—the great Dao’s origin cannot be fathomed. It gives birth to heaven and earth, empowers gods and emperors—its mysterious workings defy all description.

Throughout the ages, the arts of the Dao have emerged from a hundred schools, yet Confucianism, Buddhism, and the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi stand as the Three Teachings. Though rites and music cannot be compared to the schools of names, laws, military strategy, or power, none surpass the loftiness of effortless transformation. Though the emptiness of meditation differs from the debates over hardness, whiteness, similarity, and difference, how could it compare to the responsiveness of non-action? The principles of the Numinous Treasure and the True One, the methods of the Golden Elixir and the cultivation of nature and life—these are profound indeed. In their greatest form, they can lead to transcendence; in their lesser form, they still protect families and states. The Dao is revered, its virtue esteemed; thus, it surpasses all antiquity and endures alone. Its subtlety and depth are such that mediocre minds cannot comprehend them.

The narrow-minded scholars of the world often speak recklessly, some dismissing it as heterodoxy, others condemning it as an external path. Yet what can be added to the perfection of the natural and ultimate principle? Those of limited wisdom and selfishness simply reveal their own lack of understanding.

Your ministers, though unworthy and of humble station, have often recited the profound scriptures. Inspired by the teachings of the divine luminaries, we aspire to the winds of purity and seek to cleanse ourselves. We lament that the sages have departed ever further, and pity the world’s descent into baseness. Is our Dao not true? Have we not seen the customs of the ancient eras of Fuxi and Shennong? The subtle words have faded—who can now illuminate the texts of the *Yinfu* and the *Daode*?

By the blessed dawn of our Master’s sacred birth, we are entrusted with the flourishing of the Dao. We humbly pray that the world’s teachings be magnified and the ancestral winds of the lineage be reinvigorated. May the celestial scriptures of the Three Caverns be restored in full; may the supreme Dao of non-action endure through the vast kalpas. As for harmonizing with creation to achieve merit, or equaling the boundless void in longevity—these are virtues the True Venerable has long possessed, far beyond the words of this humble servant.

We bow in reverence, offering incense and completing the final libation.

*After the final libation, the petition is read:*
We have heard: when heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends; when Kan and Li achieve balance, the yellow sprout is born. The essence of the elixir crucible stands apart from the vulgar world—how then could the smoke and dust of the red realm befit the exalted immortals? Thus, in this rite of water offering, we emulate the ancient ritual of presenting broth. A single spoonful at dusk, drawn from the pouch to test the immortal formula; nine cycles of white snow, transmuting the bones with the remnant elixir.

With utmost devotion, we raise and present the offering.

*The broth is offered, the scriptures are presented, and the deities are sent forth.*

We have heard: the numinous dwells in the indistinct, present wherever one turns; the Dao abides in emptiness, responding to every entreaty. It matches the boundless vastness of the Great Luo realm, yet stands as the august sovereign of the ten thousand existents. To seek it in form is already mistaken—how much more so to conceive of it in terms of coming and going? Yet since we, as mortals, emulate this rite, if we do not follow its traces, how can we convey our sincerity? Thus do we offer incense, flowers, lamps, and candles to express what is fitting; petitions and memorials to convey our intent. We bear the weight of your exalted scrutiny, trembling lest we incur reproach for irreverence. Now, as this rite of celebration reaches its completion, not even the swiftest pennants could hold it back. We envision the nine-rayed crane canopy descending from the azure vault; the eight-scene dragon chariot ascending through the blue firmament and returning on high. Our gaze strains toward the clouds, tears and sobs streaming down our faces. Words may end, but the heart’s intent knows no bounds; though our forms stand apart, our devotion draws near. In days of old, the white deer could still be sought at Qiao City—how might the blue ram come to Shu Prefecture in days to come? Our humble hearts overflow with longing beyond measure. With reverence, we bow our heads and send forth the deities. The palanquin turns—we chant the hymn of praise.

The Grand Clarity Rite of Dao and Virtue’s Manifest Transformation now concludes.
