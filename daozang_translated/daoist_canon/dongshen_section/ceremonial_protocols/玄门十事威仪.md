# 玄门十事威仪

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao, having expounded the precepts of ritual vestments to the Perfected of No-Thought and the assembled disciples, further declared the ten matters of decorum, which had not yet been revealed to you. Now I transmit these words, for they are most essential.

Just as one who wishes to walk cannot do so without feet, so one who seeks to enter the wondrous Dao cannot do so without a gate. These ten precepts of decorum are the gate of the Dao. Those who enter my gate aspire to equal the immortals, separating themselves from the profane world.

Ordinary beings who uphold these ten matters are called no longer common. The causes of birth and death, the wheel of transgressions, the defilement of the Dharma-body, the disdain for ritual vestments, the disorderly pursuit of the Dao, the failure to cultivate wholesome karma, the indulgence in self and ego, the absence of shame and remorse—these grave offenses in the Nine Dark Realms grow day and night. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, whether entering or exiting, there is a proper way.

Such ordinary beings differ not from the masses of sentient life. True immortals and great sages take no joy in seeing or hearing of them. Heavenly demons, spirits, and ghosts all despise and envy them. Kings and rulers feel no reverence for them. Men and women in the ten directions hold them in contempt. Lacking merit and virtue themselves, they nurture the roots of others’ evil. They cultivate transgressions at both ends—how boundless their suffering retribution!

I behold such beings and grieve with a chill in my heart. Therefore, I earnestly repeat this teaching to you. You should uphold and practice it, clearly instructing those who come to learn. Guide them with care, ensuring they master these matters. When the ten matters are perfected, the gods of the heavens will observe and approve. The people and gods of the ten directions, the heavenly demons, spirits, and ghosts—all will stand in awe and reverence, harboring only goodwill, none daring to transgress. Merit fields will flourish, wholesome fruits will arise universally, and boundless virtue will accrue.

Those who can do thus are my true disciples, worthy to transmit the wondrous Dharma, swiftly drawing near to the Dao. Those who cannot are kin to demons and ghosts, ever drawing closer to them day and night, never to escape.

Upon hearing these profound teachings, the Perfected of No-Thought and the assembly bowed their heads in reverence, their hearts filled with awe and shame. Joy and sorrow mingled as tears streamed down. They vowed to uphold the ten matters of decorum for kalpas without end.

The Most High said:
First, maintaining the altar;
Second, paying respects and making obeisance;

Third, movement in and out;
Fourth, sitting and rising;
Fifth, holding the flask;
Sixth, washing and rinsing;
Seventh, cloths and vessels;
Eighth, fasting and eating;
Ninth, requesting the Dharma;
Tenth, protection and upholding.

These ten matters are the affairs within my teaching gate. They shall be entrusted to you all—study and practice them, exhorting both men and women to ascend into the ranks of immortals.

The Perfected of No-Thought bowed his head to the ground, prostrating himself in long reverence, and knelt in earnest acceptance.

**Chapter One: Holding and Seating the Altar**

Now, as for seating the altar: it separates the mundane and removes defilement, safeguarding purity and self-discipline. One must not treat the Dao’s virtue with negligence, but rather emulate the lofty traces of celestial perfected beings.

First, when rising, sitting, going out, or entering, it should never leave one’s person. If, for some matter, it must temporarily be set aside, it must not be placed in any impure or杂乱之处. First, sweep or wipe the area, or place it within a clean vessel.

Second, whenever carrying it for use, either hang it upon the arm or drape it over the left hand, with the cord’s opening facing outward.

Third, whenever performing obeisance, first lift the corner with the right hand and suspend it, then use the left hand’s three fingers to grasp the edge, laying it flat with both ends even before placing it upon the ground.

Fourth, first raise the left sole and place it upon the second ridge to stand, then lift the right foot, half-kneeling to spread it evenly, ensuring it lies level and straight.

Fifth, clasp the hands and rise, stepping back so the right foot returns to the second ridge. Stand steadily before performing the three bows.

Sixth, then raise the right hand to grasp the corner with two fingers and retrieve it, taking care not to let it touch anything else. Grasping the middle ridge is also permissible.

Seventh, after putting on shoes or sandals, transfer it to the left hand, turning the body to fold it, keeping it away from others’ faces.

Eighth, once folded, hang it upon the left hand, covering it with the Daoist robe or cloud-patterned sash before proceeding with greetings.

**Chapter Two: Paying Respects and Making Obeisance**

Now, as for paying respects and making obeisance: it is called humbling oneself, revering oneself, and revering others. While inner reverence is difficult to perceive, outward humility is visible. Thus, one must perform formal rites with diligence to express the heart’s profound esteem.

Humbling oneself to show respect serves twelve purposes: first, shame and remorse; second, repentance and gratitude; third, seeking the Dharma; fourth, eliminating arrogance; fifth, honoring virtue; sixth, consolation and congratulation; seventh, eradicating transgressions; eighth, discipline and admonition; ninth, repaying kindness; tenth, offering objects; eleventh, bringing joy to people in this life; twelfth, earning reverence from all under heaven in the future.

First, when paying respects and making obeisance, one must be composed and proper, with a demeanor worthy of admiration.

Second, hold the tablet centered before the heart, standing upright with a straight body.

Third, prostrate with the five limbs touching the ground, front and back aligned evenly.

Fourth, upon seeing revered images, scriptures, or Dharma, or when encountering repentance rituals, one must perform obeisance.

Fifth, upon seeing a revered master of noble virtue, one must perform obeisance.

Sixth, upon seeing one’s preceptor, one must perform obeisance.

Seventh, upon seeing a virtuous friend superior to oneself, one must perform obeisance.

Eighth, upon seeing fellow students from all directions, one must perform obeisance.

Ninth, when taking leave of one’s master or returning to one’s chamber for the night, one must first perform obeisance, state the time of return on the following day, and depart with respect. Upon arriving home, one must also perform obeisance before engaging in conversation or inquiring after well-being.

Tenth, when departing for distant places or returning after a month or a year, one must first perform three bows, then kneel and prostrate fully to the ground, expressing deep gratitude before rising to exchange greetings. This is the proper etiquette for serving one’s master.

Eleventh, if the master resides in a distant province or county, with rare opportunities for meeting over long years, one must still perform obeisance, kneel, and express one’s feelings, prostrating with sorrow and emotion before rising to exchange greetings. If they meet and discuss matters of joy or sorrow, one must offer congratulations or condolences with repeated bows.

Twelfth, in occasions of celebration or mourning, one must first express sorrow or joy through ritual, then deepen the sentiment afterward. One must wait until the elder has finished speaking before performing obeisance again. The same applies when receiving congratulations or condolences.

Thirteenth, upon receiving kind instruction or admonishment—even if it involves reproach or punishment—one must perform obeisance, express gratitude in a low voice, and repay the virtue of the teaching.

Fourteenth, when receiving obeisance, one must raise one’s fists in a respectful gesture, decline with clasped hands, and defer to the other’s honor.

Fifteenth, when performing obeisance to one’s master, one must wait for them to be seated. If a mutual bow is required, one must sit to receive it. If the master returns from afar, one should escort them to their chamber, wait until they are seated, and only then perform obeisance—not hastily at the doorway or corridor.

Sixteenth, in halls or temples, before sacred images or in the presence of masters and elders, one must not accept another’s obeisance. If someone unknowingly performs obeisance, one must explain the matter to stop them. If one encounters an elder of noble virtue in a hall, one must also explain that one dares not perform obeisance casually.

**Chapter on Conduct When Coming and Going**

First, when walking or standing in difficult or uncertain places, one must always have a companion and not proceed alone, so as to avoid appearing self-assured.

Second, when coming or going near or far, one must inform one’s disciples or fellow residents. If no one is present, one must tell the young attendants where one is going and when one will return.

Third, when visiting places with men and women of different stations or attending occasions of celebration or mourning, one must temporarily cease personal freedoms, avoid seclusion in hidden or private places, and always come and go with companions, following the group.

Fourth, unless for urgent matters, one must not frequently come and go in a manner that draws attention, lest one invite disrespect.

Fifth, when coming or going and encountering officials, one must avoid being seen. If no place of concealment is available, one should stand in a secluded spot, in the shadow of a person or tree, maintaining a composed and reverent demeanor.

Sixth, when coming or going and suddenly encountering the carriages or palanquins of the noble, one must step aside and lower one’s body in deference.

Seventh, unless for urgent matters, one must not venture out in wind, rain, mud, extreme cold, or heat, lest one’s appearance become disheveled and offensive to others.

Eighth, when coming or going through cities, villages, or populated areas, one must maintain a composed and dignified bearing, refraining from loud laughter. If questioned, one must respond with courtesy; unless the matter is urgent, silence is preferable.

Ninth, when coming or going and encountering wicked, foolish, or childish people who speak coarsely or mockingly, one must act as if one has not heard, without changing one’s expression.

Tenth, when coming or going, regardless of distance, one must carry a sitting cloth and other items such as a handkerchief or flask, as one would when staying in place, adjusting as appropriate.

Eleventh, if one encounters disorderly circumstances or must stay overnight at a patron’s home, one should sprinkle water on the bed and wipe it with a cloth—this is called “purifying the bed”—to avoid contamination.

Twelfth, when coming or going through cities or villages and witnessing improper or disorderly conduct or hearing vulgar or mocking words, one must lower one’s head and pass by directly, taking care not to look.

Thirteenth, when female Daoists come or go, regardless of distance or suspicion, they must always be accompanied to avoid impropriety.

Fourteenth, when coming or going through the gates of sacred images or the residences of elders, one must not pass through the central gate but enter and exit through a side door, turning sideways.

**Chapter on Rising and Sitting**

First, the manner of rising and sitting must observe distinctions of rank. Without proper hierarchy, one differs little from those of other stations.

Second, in Dharma assemblies, a male official should step forward, perform three bows, kneel, and with hands clasped say: “The humble disciple so-and-so requests the assembly to be seated.” The same applies to female Daoists.

Third, in the presence of sacred images, the master should recite the ritual scripture, and the young attendants should do likewise, while laymen should be seated appropriately.

Fourth, when in the presence of scriptures, images, or elders, one must compose one’s demeanor, refraining from arrogance, laxity, or improper speech.

Fifth, in the presence of scriptures, images, or elders, one must not turn one’s back to the sacred texts, images, or honored masters.

Sixth, when attending to one’s revered master or elders, one must stand upright, without leaning against beds, walls, or other objects.

Seventh, when attending to one’s master or elders, one must maintain solemnity and speak only when questioned.

Eighth, when attending to one’s master or elders, one must stand upon the ground. Only after being granted permission to sit and receiving repeated instructions may one bow in gratitude and then be seated.

Ninth, when attending to one’s master or elders, if another person present is more venerable than one’s own master or elder, one must follow the instructions of the former, first expressing gratitude before sitting.

Tenth, in refectories, lecture halls, or places where scriptures are studied or repentance rituals conducted, one must sit and rise according to the proper ranks, without overstepping one’s position, strictly adhering to the prescribed order of precepts and regulations.

Eleventh, after scriptures have been expounded in the Dharma hall, should one arrive late, one must discreetly take a seat in an appropriate place. Even if one possesses lofty virtue or status, one must still follow convenience and not proceed forward, causing disturbance or noise.

Twelfth, once seated, unless for urgent matters, one must not frequently rise or move about, disrupting others by entering or exiting.

Thirteenth, in all places, whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, one must not mingle with those of improper character.

Fourteenth, when one’s master, elders, superiors, or others are reading documents or petitions in detail, if the matter does not concern oneself, one must not approach to peer or join in ignorance.

**Chapter Five: On Vessels**

First, men must not use pomegranate-shaped vessels.

Second, women must not use areca nut-shaped vessels.

Third, vessels must be frequently scoured and washed to keep them bright and clean, free from dust, grime, or filth.

Fourth, vessels must not retain water overnight.

Fifth, in summer, water must be changed daily; failure to do so renders it impure.

Sixth, in winter, water may be changed every two days.

Seventh, clay vessels may be changed every three days, but they must not be placed in unclean areas; this is strictly prohibited.

Eighth, vessels used for urination or defecation must be kept separate. One must first cleanse the front and rear, then scrub one’s hands with brick or stone, and further purify them with ash or soapberry. Violations bar one from attending morning audiences with the immortals, ascending the hall to pay respects to one’s master, receiving others’ bows, or joining the assembly.

Ninth, after use, vessels must be placed in stable locations to prevent tipping; this is greatly prohibited.

Tenth, if others wish to examine a vessel, including children carrying it, one must ensure no unclean hands touch its handle, keeping it immaculate.

Eleventh, vessels must be safeguarded and kept clean, both inside and out, with the same care as scriptures and sacred images.

**Chapter Six: On Washing and Rinsing**

First, there are four occasions for washing and rinsing: morning rinsing, rinsing after reading, rinsing after meals, and rinsing upon rising from bed.

Second, one must rinse the mouth three times on each occasion.

Third, after meals, one should use a solution of willow twigs, which both cleanses impurities and prevents tooth decay. If willow twigs are unavailable, use fine ash.

Fourth, when first using willow twigs, recite the incantation:
*"The harmonious qi of the sun,
Unfurls the spring willow.
Break off a twig,
To purify body and mouth.
Cultivating the Dao, refining the true,
May all three realms be delivered.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands."*

Fifth, when using ash, recite the incantation:
*"Washing ash removes filth,
Ash is foremost for cleansing.
Impurity departs, the true arrives,
Purifying heart and mouth.
Attaining the Dao, delivering others,
As enduring as heaven and earth.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands."*

Sixth, when rinsing or washing, one must turn to the side and face away from others, never performing these acts directly before them.

Seventh, when using water, one must not touch the water in the basin with one’s hands; instead, use a wooden ladle to draw water from the basin, and do not let the ladle touch the basin.

Eighth, if one inadvertently touches the water, one must confess and repent, then personally replenish the basin with fresh water to avoid incurring transgression.

Ninth, when rinsing the mouth or washing the face, one must not make gurgling sounds or expel bubbles from the nose or mouth, nor strike or tap water vessels to disturb others.

Tenth, when using water, one must not waste or trample it carelessly.

Eleventh, one must not spit or spray impure water before others or onto clean ground.

Twelfth, when using any item, including water and other objects, one must practice frugality and avoid wasteful or frivolous use.

**Chapter Seven: On Towels and Utensils**

First, towels and utensils are used for receiving and partaking in vegetarian meals.

Second, vegetarian meals, offered to both sacred and ordinary beings, are of the utmost importance.

Third, one’s robes should be clean, and one’s seat immaculate; thus, one must first spread the sitting mat before taking one’s place.

Fourth, towels and utensils should be pure; thus, one must first wash one’s hands before handling them.

Fifth, one must first present clean water before opening the utensils to receive food. The wise regard food as heaven, while ordinary people regard it as life; thus, it is of the greatest importance.

Sixth, towels and utensils serve the same purpose. When not in use, they must be kept together in one place.

Seventh, towels and utensils must be protected and kept clean as one; they are to be used solely for vegetarian meals and nothing else.

Eighth, utensils for vegetarian meals must be stored on separate shelves or stands, not mixed with other vessels. The ancients called these "vegetarian utensils."

Ninth, vegetarian utensils embody the five phases and serve the fivefold functions, receiving the five flavors of food. They may be made of lacquered wood or bronze, procured according to one’s means.

Tenth, vegetarian towels should be made of thick, dense cloth, four feet in length, hemmed and stitched, and kept spotlessly white.

**Chapter Eight: On Vegetarian Meals**

First, during meals, one person must be appointed as the hall monitor, also called the meal supervisor. "Vegetarian" means "regulated"; this person oversees the rhythm of bells and chimes, corrects errors, and is thus called the supervisor of the Dharma master’s meal.

Second, when ascending to the hall to partake in the meal, one must wear clean and proper attire.

Third, one must first wash one’s hands and handle the utensils, then place them to the left upon entering the hall, covering them with a towel.

Fourth, when performing repentance rituals, all should sit evenly according to the number of participants, removing their shoes and placing them beneath their seats, ensuring they do not obstruct those making offerings.

Fifth, one must first carry the purifying water, taking care that the vessels do not collide with others.

Sixth, after receiving the water, first take the towel, holding its center with the corner facing forward, letting seven inches hang down to spread it. Then, place the vegetarian utensils, and spread a second towel over the knees, ensuring both are laid with palms facing upward.

Seventh, when setting out the meal utensils, arrange them in order from one to five, without skipping or disorder.

Eighth, the hall monitor shall stand upright beside the chime in the hall and strike it once to offer prayers for the longevity of the reigning emperor, or to invoke blessings, expiation, or merit-transfer for the ten-directional benefactors, adapting the invocation to the occasion and expressing gratitude for their protection.

Next, a master shall be appointed to lead the prayers, the text of which is recorded in the *Seven Perfected Regulations*.

Ninth, when serving congee, recite the incantation:
*"This morning’s fragrant congee is offered to the Three Honored Ones.
May it benefit the nation and enrich the benefactors.
May all sentient beings in the six realms be fully sated."*

Tenth, when serving the meal, recite the incantation:
*"Among all fields of merit,
offering food is foremost.
Those present receive joy,
the departed are reborn in heaven.
In the future, they shall dwell in the Pure Land,
where clothing and sustenance arise naturally.
Thus, we now make this offering,
universally presented to all deities."*

Eleventh, after the incantations, proceed to serve the meal. The meal supervisor must first instruct the servers to clearly and loudly announce each dish’s name, portioning the food equitably.

Twelfth, when the meal is served, the meal supervisor shall strike the chime once and say: *"All benefactors of this vegetarian offering shall bow together in reverence, exchanging respectful glances before beginning to eat."*

Thirteenth, when receiving food, take only three portions, serving oneself sufficiently without leaving excess or disorder, lest it offend others and diminish reverence and faith.

Fourteenth, upon hearing the dish’s name announced, one must hold the utensil and receive the food with hands.

Fifteenth, if declining, gesture to decline; if the portion is too large, withdraw the hand; if too small, extend it—no verbal complaints are permitted.

Sixteenth, during the meal, those seated above and below should observe one another. Those eating slowly should hasten slightly, while those eating quickly should slow down, ensuring uniformity.

Seventeenth, the meal supervisor must oversee the entire meal. If more than half have finished, a second serving may be offered.

Eighteenth, one must not indulge their nature to the point of causing resentment among those who eat slowly.

Nineteenth, one must eat finely, chewing quickly but swallowing slowly, avoiding slurping or clinking utensils, lest it incur the sin of lacking compassion.

Twentieth, after the meal, unless in cases of military urgency, sudden crises, fire, theft, or death, no speech is permitted to disturb the solemnity of the vegetarian hall.

Twenty-first, any instructions during the meal must be given by hand gestures, speaking only in a low voice.

Twenty-second, after the meal, any remaining fruit or food shall be collected and distributed to those of lower status or the sick and beggars; none may be taken away with the utensils.

Twenty-third, after eating, first fold the towels from the knees, then gather the utensils in order from the fifth to the first, placing them on the towel.

Twenty-fourth, after the meal, purifying water shall be used to wash the utensils. Once the water is collected, the chime shall be struck, and the blessing of the offering shall be recited, followed by the blessing of the remaining merit-transfer, the texts of which are recorded in the *Seven Perfected Precepts*.

Twenty-fifth, if there is no special occasion, the prayer texts may be omitted.

Twenty-sixth, the prayer shall say:
*"Though the vegetarian ritual is complete,
we fear its merit may yet be imperfect.
Thus, we further offer pure wealth to the Three Treasures,
that the benefactors may gain blessings and the merit be perfected."*

Twenty-seventh, for the offering of food, the prayer shall say:
*"The Dharma meal for the Three Treasures is now fully offered.
We transfer it to the attendants,
praying that the young and lowly alike share in the merit of this meal,
free from all obstacles."*

Twenty-eighth, after striking the chime and announcing the meal’s conclusion, all shall recite the Dharma meal’s dedication:
*"May all fields of merit be universally blessed,
may the ten directions be liberated,
and may the three realms be at peace."*

Twenty-ninth, if anyone violates the precepts during the meal, the meal supervisor must announce it and instruct the offender to bow in repentance.

Thirtieth, the chime shall be struck again, and the verse of exhortation shall be recited:
*"Having heard this Dharma,
may our bodies and minds be as pure as lapis lazuli vessels.
With joy and reverence, we bow in homage to the Supreme Three Honored Ones."*

Thirty-first, the *Three Bows* shall be recited. If there is a special occasion, the *Three Vows* may be recited instead; further details are not recorded here.

Thirty-second, when the meal is entirely concluded, the chime shall be struck, and the *Random Vows* shall be recited. All shall bow reverently, hold their utensils, and depart.

Thirty-third, those leaving shall rise in order, proceed in formation, and return to their quarters without gathering or engaging in loud conversation to disturb the assembly.

**Chapter Nine: On Requesting the Dharma**

The Dharma is called a treasure; for those who respectfully receive it, it is truly wondrous.
First, it benefits oneself by transmitting the Dharma to others;
second, it benefits others by guiding them to the wondrous fruit.
The merit of transmitting the Dharma advances one to the ranks of immortals.
Thus, requesting the Dharma must be done with reverence and sincerity.

First, there are two types of Dharma masters to be invited:
1. Those who expound the Dharma, lecture on sutras, transmit regulations, and confer precepts;
2. Those temporarily invited to resolve doubts.
In both cases, one must bow in reverence, treat them with care and respect, and prostrate with sincerity.

Second, when lecturing on sutras or expounding the Dharma, one must assess the scale and distance beforehand, submitting a written request in advance. The paper must be of good quality, the script written in standard, neat calligraphy, and the text composed with proper purity and solemnity. Hasty, careless, or disrespectful language is not permitted.

Third, when presenting a written request for minor matters, one must first perform the rites of reverence, completing three bows. Then, holding the document, kneel upright to state its purpose, and with hands clasped, present it to the recipient. Upon receiving the document, perform three bows again, express gratitude, and withdraw.

Fourth, for matters of great importance, when presenting a written request, perform the rites while holding the document—either seven or up to nine bows—then kneel upright to state the matter. Afterward, perform three more bows. Upon completing the presentation, kneel upright again and express gratitude, saying: *"This humble one has been graciously bestowed with compassion, and I am overwhelmed with fortune."*

Fifth, if the recipient has not yet accepted the document, continue bowing without limit until permission is granted. If permission is still not given, withdraw temporarily and wait for another opportunity, presenting it again with repeated bows. As the *Dingzhi Sutra* states: *"Even if blood flows in torrents, the heart must not waver. Without wholehearted devotion, one cannot knock upon the gates of the hidden realm, prostrate at the master’s threshold, or bow before the sanctuary of virtue—ultimately, no transmission will be received."*

Sixth, when temporarily inviting a master to resolve doubts, first perform three bows, then kneel upright with hands clasped to present the matter in question. After the explanation, perform three more bows, rise, and with hands clasped, express gratitude, saying: *"This foolish disciple, though unworthy, has been graciously favored by the Dharma master, who has deigned to clarify the truth. I am filled with boundless joy."* Then perform three bows and withdraw.

Seventh, if a venerable elder of high virtue arrives to present a written request, invite an almsgiving, or expound upon the meaning of sutras, their titles, or discuss their principles, one should receive them at dawn while seated. After bowing to the document, announce with gratitude: *"This ignorant disciple, untutored in such explanations, is deeply honored by your command and filled with reverence."* Then perform three bows in return, honoring their virtue.

Eighth, if the recipient is a master or teacher who has previously transmitted the Dharma, and they present a written command, wait until three bows are completed, then prostrate to receive it. Kneel upright and hold the document aloft with both hands over the crown of the head for a long moment before placing it on the table. Perform three bows, kneel upright, and express gratitude, saying: *"This unworthy disciple, suddenly entrusted with such a solemn command, is filled with awe and trepidation."* Alternatively, one may say: *"I dare not perform three bows before withdrawing."*

Ninth, the phrase *"I dare not"* carries two meanings: when receiving, one dares not refuse; when refusing, one dares not receive.

**Chapter Ten: On Upholding and Safeguarding**

Upholding and safeguarding comprises seven aspects: 1) safeguarding the Dharma robes, 2) safeguarding the Dharma, 3) safeguarding the sutras, 4) safeguarding the master, 5) safeguarding one’s own body, 6) safeguarding donors from the ten directions, and 7) safeguarding all sentient beings.

First, sutras and images are of one essence and must be treated without distinction. As the regulations state: *"Wherever sutras and images reside, they must be kept pure and protected, enclosed by bamboo frames. When temporarily leaving, cover them with a clean cloth. When reading, do not unfold more than three lines at once, and if interrupted, roll them up immediately. Do not pause mid-scroll; if urgent matters arise before completion, begin anew from the start when resuming recitations or repentance rituals."*

Second, do not allow impure persons, nor those with impure bodies, speech, or foul breath, to touch them.

Third, when handling sutras or images, purify both hands and mind, and do not hold other objects. If placing them above other items, or moving objects aside, seek assistance. If no one is available, shift items slightly, then wash hands before touching the sutra stand—this applies to both upper and lower surfaces. If other objects are touched, wash hands again.

Fourth, sutras and images must not share a room. If they are stored in black-lacquered cases alongside other items, or within a cabinet, temporary residence may be permitted. However, if stored in plain cases or bundles, even within a cabinet, this is not permissible.

Fifth, when in a grand hall or assembly space, whether by day or night, if fatigue from Dharma affairs arises, one may rest briefly but must do so with the body curled to the side, never sprawling carelessly with limbs outstretched or snoring through the nose and mouth. If others are present, remind them; if they remain silent upon hearing, their negligence is as grave as disrespecting the Dharma.

Sixth, among the four assemblies, when sitting, standing, or walking, do not engage in idle chatter or laughter with outsiders.

Seventh, diligent study is not as crucial as choosing a master wisely. If a master’s virtue is lacking, do not seek their instruction. Once a true master is found, serve them as one would a treasure, exerting every effort in devotion until the Dao is attained, never parting from their guidance.

Eighth, if a master errs or makes a mistake, do not slander them. Instead, discreetly and respectfully kneel to inquire repeatedly, adhering to the Dharma regulations. If others speak of the master’s virtues or faults, clarify the matter. If unable to do so, leave immediately—this is the mark of one who safeguards their master.

Ninth, the master’s bed, desk, walking staff, clothing, ink, and all other belongings must be upheld and protected, never defiled or mishandled.

Tenth, if in an assembly one violates the sutra regulations and is admonished by the community, accepting the due penalty with eagerness, joy, humility, and gratitude—this is the sign of a true practitioner. Such a person swiftly eradicates immeasurable transgressions, swiftly attains the supreme fruit of the Way, and embodies the great upholding of the Dharma.

Eleventh, in safeguarding donors from the ten directions—whether known or unknown, high or low, male or female, noble or humble, near or far—all must be treated with reverence. Their lodging, comings and goings, seating, tasks, comforts, hunger and satiety, likes and dislikes, adversities and fortunes, health and illness must all be managed with fairness and balance, offering respectful consolation, appropriate rewards, and measured reproach.

Twelfth, all sentient beings, even the smallest creatures, if found in peril—fallen into water or fire, or any life-threatening situation—must be rescued within one’s capacity, ensuring their safety and peace.

Thirteenth, in all movements—whether walking, standing, entering, or exiting—resting or passing by, in matters of regional governance, fame, or profit, in dealings with relatives or strangers, men or women, one must refrain from frivolous or deceitful speech that might arouse doubt among sentient beings. This is called safeguarding the virtuous fruit of all beings.

Fourteenth, if any repeatedly violate the precepts, disturb the pure assembly, resist admonishment, or conceal their faults, they must be reported to the assembly and removed from the fasting ranks, as detailed in the *Treatise on the Dignified Observances of Fasting Precepts*.

Fifteenth, for Daoist robes and ritual garments, when removing or donning them, one must carefully fold and arrange them, either placing them in a cloth wrapper or in a quiet place. Only after completing the bow of reverence may one remove or put them on.

Sixteenth, if any, when handling Dharma matters, display arrogance, belligerence, or a propensity for conflict, one must report their conduct—whether auspicious or inauspicious—to superiors and avoid association with them. This is called "concealed expulsion," ensuring they do not follow the assembly.

Seventeenth, when receiving food or alms, one should defer to others and take modestly, practicing frugality and restraint, so as not to arouse suspicion, disdain, or contempt among sentient beings, thereby harming life and virtue. This is the profound safeguarding of the Way.

The Most High said: The dignified observances comprise ten major principles, along with various precepts, totaling over one hundred and forty items. If one can study and recite them diligently, and practice them earnestly, they will have already embodied the previous ten principles and all related regulations—this is called "safeguarding the body," ensuring one does not transgress. Furthermore, teaching others these virtuous fruits is boundless; all sages rejoice, and the gods feel shame.

Such a person, in this very life, will attain ten kinds of blessings and reverence. As the *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states, and as the regulations on ritual attire affirm, one of this kind is called a "Greatly Compliant Perfected Person," who, without leaving this lifetime, enters the ranks of the sages.

If, however, there are those who, without sincere devotion to the Dao, cling to the periphery of the Dharma gate, seeking profit, defiling the Daoist robes, disgracing the flow of the Dharma, associating with evil companions, envying others’ virtuous conduct, violating the precepts themselves, and discouraging others from cultivation—who disregard their teachers’ instructions, grow more defiant upon hearing the teachings, feel no shame, and bear no gratitude—such people are called "transgressors, rebels, and ferocious beasts." Though they have barely entered the human realm, they have not yet attained a human heart; though they have momentarily joined human society, they defile the sacred Dharma. Their aspirations and conduct resemble those of prisoners in the dark or beasts in bondage. Even when separated from other beings, they remain unawakened, clinging to their habitual tendencies, longing to return to their original nature—how deeply painful! How pitiful!

In this life, such a person loses ten kinds of merit, ten kinds of reverence, incurs ten kinds of contempt, and distances themselves from ten kinds of sages. The five sufferings and eight adversities manifest in their body. Upon the end of this life, they will enter the long night of the Nine Dark Hells, enduring every form of agony, ceaselessly revolving through the three evil destinies, with no hope of liberation.

Upon hearing these essential words from the Most High, the Perfected of No-Thought and others wept tears of joy, leaping with exultation. They bowed in reverence, expressed their gratitude, and vowed to receive and uphold the teachings.

Here ends the *Ten Dignified Observances of the Mystery Gate*.
