**Zhengyi Official Departure Rites: Petition for the Return of Goodness**

With reverence, I dispatch the Five Body True Officials and Merit Officers from within my person, ascending through the Three-Five Pure Subtlety Heaven, Yu Yu Heaven, and Great Red Heaven. I summon the Five Qi Merit Officers, the Supreme August Perfected, the Twelve True Officials, the Divine Origin Red Qi Red Chariot Envoys, the Yin-Yang True Qi Yellow Script Contract Spirit-Eye Lords and Officers, the Yin-Yang Generative Qi Dao-Transmitting Transformation Lords and Officers, the Nine Qi Elders and Summoning Officers, the Disaster-Dispelling Calamity-Resolving Deliverance Lords and Officers, the Spirit-Returning Lords and Officers, and the Twelve Officers each of the Crimson and White Surge Pool Generals.

I dispatch the Two Upper Immortals and Two Upper Spirits from within my person, along with their Direct Merit Officers; the Two Direct Merit Officers each from the Three-Five Heavens; the Two Zhengyi Merit Officers to collect inauspicious records; the Two Upper Section Merit Officers to collect malevolent officers; the Two Middle Section Merit Officers to record rebellious officers; the Two Lower Section Merit Officers to collect harmful officers; the Two Urgent Qi Merit Officers to gather Yin-Yang officers; the Two Upper Section Envoys to collect and record souls; the Two Middle Section Envoys to collect and record po; the Two Lower Section Envoys to bind and reverse-restrain; the Two Urgent Qi Envoys to monitor time and strike; the Two Left Official Envoys to strike, verify, lock, and imprison; the Two Right Official Envoys to open shackles and seal prisons; the Two High Chariot Envoys to sharpen heads and sever ears; the Twelve Crimson Chariot Envoys to monitor roads and headscarf officers; the Twelve High-Handed Officers to sever necks; the Twelve Direct Execution Officers; the Twelve Adjutant Execution Officers; the Twelve Merit Officer Execution Officers; the Twelve True Talisman Execution Officers; the Twelve Urgent Battle Execution Officers; the Twelve Banner Execution Officers; the Twelve Drawn-Sword Execution Officers; the Twelve Drum-Beating Execution Officers; the Twelve Long Saber Beheading Officers; and the Twelve Officers of the Rushing Wind Cavalry, stationed at post-horses to seize and suppress rebellious battles.

All dispatched officers shall be clad in solemn attire, adorned with caps and hanging tassels, standing before and behind me, bearing their full titles. I, having received [the mandate], now present a certain oral petition and written memorial, beseeching the return of transformative grace to suppress and invert [evil], to capture and expel malevolent schemers.

I humbly invoke the statutes of Heaven and Earth, which cherish life and abhor killing, rewarding good and punishing evil. Charged with the duty of talismanic registers, I, bound by my office, am sworn to propagate the true transformation and eradicate the wicked. Today, in a certain prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, on a certain day and month, [a victim] suffered a certain affliction. Kneeling in supplication, I confess my ignorance of the matter, for the distress is grave.

In accordance with the Heavenly Master’s statutes, I reverently present a Crimson Petition. I invoke the local Earth God and the True Qi-Residing Lords, Officers, and Soldiers of this domain to investigate, summon, and gather the malevolent one, [named] so-and-so, to be seized by the punitive officers and brought forth.

My swift envoys to the left and right shall apprehend and bind the malefactor, so-and-so, wherever he may be, his head suspended and sharpened, allowing no respite. Once the matter is concluded, the execution shall be swift. The Heavenly Officers, Generals, Soldiers, and Officers I have invoked shall stand before and behind me, listening to the reading of this petition, each proceeding in order to suppress the malefactor, so-and-so, further restraining his three hun and seven po, sealing them in the Heavenly Courts.

I interrogate the malefactor for his transgressions, compelling his submission and punishment. Within three or four days, he shall be forced to death. *Hastily, as per the Statutes and Ordinances of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign!*

Today, I invoke the Crimson Heaven General to seize the malefactor, with ten thousand officers and soldiers arrayed to bind and destroy him at his home. I invoke ten thousand Generals, Officers, and Soldiers to behead the malefactor, so-and-so, for his deceitful and bewildering words. I invoke three hundred thousand Generals, Officers, and Soldiers to descend and interrogate the malefactor, so-and-so, for his delusions and wanderings. I invoke Generals and Soldiers to apprehend him, to weigh his conduct against the Dao and its virtue. Three hundred thousand soldiers shall descend to bind the malefactor, so-and-so, his head reversed and restrained, his community punished and censured, his mouth silenced.

For slandering his master as unvirtuous and disrespectful, three hundred thousand soldiers shall descend to seize and reverse-bind him, to be annihilated without limit—boiled in cauldrons, burned by fire, his sinews and bones scorched, his body consigned to the Eighteen Hells. I beseech the Heavenly Officers, Generals, Soldiers, and Officers to promptly proceed to the malefactor’s home, collect his hun and po, and deliver them to the Earth God for suspension, interrogation, and punishment. *Hastily, as per the Golden Mouth Statutes and Ordinances of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign!*

I request to open and recite the petition before the altar. With solemnity, I further charge the Five Body Direct Officials, Merit Officers, Envoys, Scribes, and Lesser Officers of the Vermilion Yang within my person.

Upon completing the petition, tread thirteen steps to suppress [the malefactor]. Inscribe the malefactor’s name upon the talisman, grasp the knife in the left hand to sever qi within the pit, and press with the left big toe, repeating thrice. Then recite the incantation:

*"Hark! How the Heavenly Net interlaces! How the Earthly Principles perish! Seize the malefactor, so-and-so’s hun and po, and consign them to the cauldron’s boiling waters. Enter swiftly beneath the Heavenly Net’s dense suppression, deeply concealed. Should you escape, your body shall be harmed; should you enter above, you shall lose your homeland. As I decree the execution of Zhang, hasten! Hastily, as per the Statutes and Ordinances of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign!"*

Circling leftward, restore the qi of life and place the virtuous person by the northern wall, elevated three feet. Reverently invoke the Twelve Hundred Generals of the Inverted Net and Overturned Earth, the One Hundred Twenty Lords of Wide-Eyed Vision, and the Twelve Hundred Great Forehead Spirit Lords of the Five Directions to seize and record the three hun and seven po of the malefactor, to examine and punish their crimes, and to drag forth all who unjustly strike or entangle this person. Reverently invoke the Lord of Venus to transform the malefactor’s heart, earnestly beseeching their concealment, annihilation, and subjugation. Hasten! As per the Statutes and Ordinances.

Another method: at a designated place, construct an altar and inscribe the malefactor’s name. Place it within a bamboo tube along the five directions, and strike it upon the monthly suppression. Tread the Seven Star Steps, advancing from the monthly establishment to the suppression’s position, aligning suppression with establishment, and suppression with the flourishing of life. Recite the incantation:

*"Departing at dawn from the Great Numinous Terrace,
Returning to the talismanic officials and spirits,
The Heavenly Bureaus execute and slay the malefactor.
Hasten! As per the Statutes and Ordinances of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign."*

Recite the incantation:

*"Talismans traverse Heaven and Earth,
Seizing and recording ghosts and spirits.
Talismans traverse the Great Dao,
Seizing and recording the true spirits.
The Three Masters’ talismans—
The Heavenly Dao is spontaneous.
Should you know yourself not true,
Do not oppose our spirits.
Those we treat are healed,
Those we save are freed,
Those we suppress are subdued,
Those we protect live.
To protect the divine spirits,
Hasten! As per the Statutes and Ordinances of the Supreme Mystic Capital Venerable Sovereign."*

Use one *dou* and two *sheng* of salt, one *dan* and two *dou* of clear water, one large blade, three *jin* of charcoal, and one *dou* and two *sheng* of oil. Recite the incantation:

*"The Five Phases propel one another,
The Net upholds its might.
The Six Disciplines assist me,
The Three Honored Ones dispel transgression.
Heaven revolves, Earth turns,
The Three and Five pivot as jade orbs.
Long life and enduring vision,
Sun and Moon shine together.
Those who oppose me perish,
Those who turn from the Dao decline.
The Three Bonds and Six Disciplines
Sink before the Net.
All mouths are silenced,
Punishments and prisons dissolve.
Hasten! As per the Statutes and Ordinances."*

Present the auspicious petition to the officials.
Reverently dispatch the true officials and functionaries of the Five Bodily Viscera within my person: two functionaries each from the Great Sage True Spirit Register and the Numinous Official Envoys, two functionaries each from the Direct Envoys of the Two Offices of Supreme Mystery, two functionaries each from the Capital Bureau, the Upper Bureau, the Middle Bureau, the Lower Bureau, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Crimson Chariot Envoys, the Yin-Yang Divine Decision Clerks, the Scarlet Talismanic Chariot Clerks, eighteen each of the Just Wind Couriers and Post-Horse Petition Clerks, eighteen each of the Flying Dragon Cavalry Clerks, and eighteen each of the Functionary Soldiers. All who emerge shall be clad in solemn attire, caps, and sashes, standing in formation before and behind me, all receiving my commands. The words from my mouth shall be distinctly transmitted and reported. Here, the true officials of the prefectures, counties, townships, and villages, the qi-monitoring overseers, and the local summoning lords and generals—now, I reverently present on behalf of so-and-so a petition of threefold auspicious return, placed upon the plain table before me.

**Petition Text**

To the Supreme Mystery Capital, the Orthodox Unity, the Balanced Qi, the Celestial Master of the Crane’s Call Retreat, the Supreme Middle Qi, the Primordial Destiny True Person, overseer of the fifteen ranks—your servant so-and-so bows his head and prostrates himself twice to memorialize:

Reverently following the records of my native prefecture, county, township, and village, your servant so-and-so humbly addresses the Supreme Boundless Dao, the Supreme Venerable Sovereign, the Celestial Master, the Female Master, the Lineage Master, the System Master, the Lady of the Gate, and the Lords of the Five Qi. At this time, in such-and-such prefecture, county, township, and village, a household of a thousand years and a thousand mouths, now residing in such-and-such village, today kowtows as a plain, flesh-born mortal, a descendant of the myriad officials, fortunate for a thousand ages, governed by the Dao-qi of the Supreme Lords, the Elders, and the Three Masters, preserving purity of heart. From the beginning, I have received grace, truly rejoicing and consoled. Yet I, a dull and coarse being, have encountered the turning of fate, not daring to squander my humble body in attachment to numinous blessings, washing away dust and filth, bathing in the pure wind, and embodying transformation. Having received the registers of the Dao and the arts of long life, I bear great favor and am constantly protected. Moreover, my ignorance is profound; I cannot retreat to the cliffs and valleys. In upholding the Dao, I violate its regulations; in every action, I provoke conflict. Suddenly, on such-and-such year, month, and day, I was unjustly afflicted by such-and-such matter, or by the poisonous intent of a malefactor seeking to harm me. Due to such-and-such circumstances, the bureaucratic offices may perceive my transgressions and seek to secretly harm me, or I may be envied. Though I have unworthily received the grace of the Great Dao, the secret talismans, and the Dao’s teachings, from the day I accepted the Dao, I was bound to dispel calamities. Yet this malefactor, harboring rebellious intent, schemes to injure me, secretly striking me beyond endurance. Beset by this malefactor so-and-so on all sides with false accusations, ever more oppressive, their schemes relentless, my liver and gall spill upon the earth. Now, entrusting myself to the darkness, I rely upon the utmost truth, hoping for the Dao’s qi to protect and assist me in dispelling the malefactor’s slander, transforming their rebellious heart. May they regard me with joy; may I prevail, and may so-and-so be punished. If they persist in malice and scheming to harm me, I beseech that the malefactor and their rebellious kin be shattered and destroyed, their clans annihilated, and their misfortunes returned upon them, unable to act. Should any harbor ill intent and falsely accuse or strike me, may they be broken, destroyed, and perish prostrate, unable to move or act.

I invoke the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Black Emperor of the North, and the Yellow Emperor of the Center, each with eight thousand soldiers, to suppress the malefactor’s officials, people, and slander on all sides. May the malefactor so-and-so be utterly subdued, and those who would cause calamity be annihilated. I invoke the Bright Star Lords of the Five Directions and the Lords of the Eight Extremities of the Celestial Sphere, one hundred twenty officials and generals, to transform the Heavenly Net and turn the Earthly Principles, silencing all slander and causing it to vanish. I invoke the Lord of the Northern Dipper’s Net to transform the malefactors on all sides, compelling them to surrender and be destroyed at the mere sight of me. Should the malefactor’s malice persist, may the Net cover their mouths, rendering them speechless. I invoke one hundred thousand soldiers of Consuming Qi to dispel all calamities and harmful qi from the four directions that would assail me, crushing and annihilating them. I invoke the Lord of Official Statutes with one thousand two hundred generals, and reverently invoke one hundred thousand Mystic Soldiers and one hundred thousand Star Lords with one hundred twenty generals to govern the Earthly Officials, suppress primordial qi, and seize and strike the malefactors, causing them to vanish. I invoke the Lords of the Oath’s Might with one hundred twenty generals, the Lords of the High Granary with one hundred twenty generals, and the Heavenly Official Protector General, the Lord of Ten Thousand Blessings, with one hundred twenty generals, all to descend and dispel the malefactors’ gatherings and slanderous strikes against me, confounding their hearts and causing their self-destruction. I invoke the Harmonizing Generals with one hundred twenty men to consign the malefactor so-and-so to the Great Yin. I invoke the Lords of the Four Seasons and Five Punishments’ Circulating Qi with one hundred twenty generals to subdue the malefactor so-and-so, compelling their surrender. I invoke the Great Forehead Lords of the East, South, West, North, and Center, each with one thousand two hundred generals, to dispel the slander of the yang officials and all who seek to harm or falsely accuse me, causing their annihilation, hearts confounded and minds bewildered, returning their misfortunes upon them. I invoke the Supreme Mystic Lords with one hundred twenty soldiers, the Southern Guardian Five Star Generals and clerks with one hundred twenty each, and thirty myriad billion soldiers of the Yue Maiden, all to descend at once and capture the malefactor so-and-so, suppressing their slanderous and secret strikes on all sides beneath the Net, unable to act or speak, hearts confounded and minds bewildered, causing their self-subjugation and annihilation. May I, abiding within the qi of life, traverse calamities and hardships. Now, I purify my heart and liberate myself, offering water, incense, and flame to dispel the malefactor’s unjust misfortunes, official and private slander, bureaucrats, people, thieves, and bandits, causing them to collapse like sand, unraveling and dispersing at once. Though I, unworthy and stained, unworthily bear the talismans and registers, my form is humble and my endowment slight. I cannot endure the malefactor so-and-so’s false accusations and slander, their extreme rebelliousness. May they be released and pacified, free from harm. On the day my wishes are fulfilled, I shall offer repayment and return all to their proper places. Thus, the officials I have invoked shall all report their merits, be promoted, and enter the Central Palace to receive honors, placed in hidden offices with increased ranks. The one thousand two hundred generals and five hundred thousand soldiers shall, according to the Heavenly Bureaus’ regulations, not be neglected. I humbly implore...

The Most High distinguishes the handles of governance; I, your servant, reverently submit this petition on behalf of so-and-so for such-and-such matter. Prostrate upon the earth, I present this memorial of restored harmony and this single vermilion memorial of condemnation, to be delivered upward to the Three Heavenly Bureaus of the Most High, awaiting your report. I, so-and-so, with trembling awe and utmost reverence, bow my head twice in obeisance to make this known.

I, your servant, of the such-and-such clan, affiliated with the such-and-such prefecture, county, abbey, or temple, diligently cultivate the flames of devotion to the Great Clarity, Primordial Origin, Most High, Three Heavens, Boundless, Supreme Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Heavenly Thearch, the Nine Elder Perfected Lords of the Grotto-Heaven, the Venerable Lords of the Nine Qi, the myriad layers of the Dao and qi, and the One Thousand Two Hundred Official Lords under the Jade Throne of the Great Clarity.

Memorial for Opening Prisons and the Chapter of the Supreme Mystery of the Orthodox Unity, Balanced Qi, of the Celestial Master of the Yangping Abbey, Left Balanced Qi.

I, your servant so-and-so, bow my head twice in obeisance and declare: According to the documents of such-and-such prefecture and county, in such-and-such village, there resides a person of such-and-such age, who today kowtows and takes leave. Born of flesh and blood, descendant of the hundred officials, I have been fortunate for a thousand generations to serve...

By the boundless grace of the Great Dao, I have long received favor, yet suddenly afflicted by misfortune and illness, beset by confused dreams and unreal visions, demonic disturbances arise in succession, while public and private disputes erupt without cause. Moreover, in my former life, I incurred the entanglements of prison, punishment, and grievous karmic retribution; in this life, on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, I was implicated in such-and-such a case. Now, upon investigation, I am to be seized, shackled, and imprisoned, subject to the legal proceedings of the earthly prison. The charges are manifold, the penalties severe, and as a mortal, I am filled with dread. Turning to your servant, I plead for redress, as is duly recorded.

In the administration of justice, humans and ghosts each have their proper jurisdiction: ghostly punishments proceed to the right, entering the prison; human punishments proceed to the left, entering the prison. Yet the distinctions are obscured, and the penalties for both are conflated. I beseech you to examine my case under the dual laws of yin and yang, lest I, in former or present life, have transgressed against either, thereby falling under the jurisdiction of the Left Bureau, or having died in violation of the law, now proceed to prison. Presently, I am secretly detained in the dungeon, my body subjected to the lash, the rod, and torture, confined and interrogated, my pleas suppressed. The severity of my plight remains uncertain.

In this age of the Yang-Nine, humans and ghosts alike are perverse and rebellious. Some suffer at the hands of corrupt officials, while others are ensnared by old enmities, scheming to inflict harm and exact vengeance, unjustly imprisoning and tormenting their victims, stopping at nothing to extort confessions. Moved by principle, I seek to deliver those in peril from the calamity of punishment, for this is the weighty concern of Heaven’s compassion.

Now, as the storm of prison and punishment presses urgently upon me, and matters may yet take a turn for the worse, delay is inadvisable. Thus, I dare to brave scalding waters and flames, emerging beneath the open sky of the central courtyard, prostrating myself to present this urgent memorial for the swift opening of my case. I humbly pray that Heaven’s compassion will surely grant deliverance.

I respectfully petition the flying celestial officials of the ten directions, mounted and ready, to open the Southern Gate thrice, that the yin offenses and yang transgressions of my former life’s karmic retribution may be swiftly dissolved. I further petition the Lords of Transgression, dispatching one hundred and twenty attendants into the Yang Talismans of the Left Bureau, to follow the penalties now imposed upon me. Should corrupt officials or old grudges pursue and entangle me, I pray to the Lords of Reversal and Transformation to dispatch one hundred and twenty attendants, compelling the obstinate clerks and oppressive officials to relent, their enmity dissolved.

If I persist in following the wicked, my soul obstinate and unrepentant, I pray that the Lords of Reversal and Transformation will compel the obstinate clerks and oppressive officials to submit, their malice turned to compliance. Should I continue to pursue the perverse, I beseech the Great Banner Lords of the Five Directions, with their legions of ten thousand soldiers, and their talismans, to seize the gods of the prison bars and the examiners of the rebellious officials. Let all who would act with violence be struck with terror, their souls subdued, their six senses confounded, their reckonings disrupted, their tongues tied, their hearts aligned with mine. Thus may the prison be dissolved, the calamities of punishment eradicated, and my body freed from pain and suffering, as a sign of your merciful efficacy.

In gratitude, I shall report the merits of the celestial officials who heed my plea, ensuring their labors are duly rewarded, and my vow of faithfulness upheld. I implore the Most High to discern my plea and grant mercy. With reverence, your servant petitions the primordial officials, clerks, and soldiers to disperse these afflictions. I humbly inquire after the dead and beseech your grace, presenting this vermilion memorial to the Three Heavenly Bureaus of the Most High. Awaiting your decree, I, your servant, bow my head twice in awe and trepidation, prostrating myself to make this known.

Your servant [Name],
Before the Jade Throne of the Great Clarity, the Celestial Elder of the Boundless Dao of the Three Heavens, the Heavenly Thearch, the Nine Elder Perfected Lords of the Grotto-Heaven, the Venerable Lords of the Nine Qi, the myriad layers of the Dao and qi, and the One Thousand Two Hundred Official Lords.

In the Year of [Tai Sui],

Another method: Upon leaving the patient’s home, step over the threshold while imprinting the seal of the Prison Overseer, and recite the incantation:

Hark! I possess the power to seize ghosts and subdue demons. I declare: the ghost that harms and afflicts so-and-so—tear out your belly, extract your liver! My master returns the illness to so-and-so, subduing the cold. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command—do not look back! Strike the teeth and depart, O officials.

I reverently dispatch from within my body the Two Officers of the Supreme Immortals and Supreme Spirits, the Direct Envoys of the Orthodox Unity and Merit Officers, two each; the Envoys of the Central Department, two each; the Envoys of the Five Thearchs, two each; the Seasonal Merit Officers, two each; the Seasonal Envoys, two each; the Yin-Yang Spirit Officials of the Granary, two each; the Scarlet Talisman Officers of the Chariot of Punishments, two each; the Couriers of the Rushing Wind and Relay Horses bearing memorials, two each. They stand before me, holding white tablets, all receiving my words. Let the words from my mouth be distinctly heard and swiftly conveyed on high. Reverently executed.

The servant [Name], of the Orthodox Unity and Balanced Qi of the Great Mysterious Capital, of the Yangping Abbey, bows twice. I humbly look up to the Most August Father and Holy Mother of the Primordial Radiance, beseeching your grace to examine and discern truth from falsehood, that the hearts of all may be instructed. In such-and-such a prefecture, county, township, and village, wicked men give free rein to their stubborn deceit—not merely one or two. I have privately learned that the descendant of the Master of the Most High has repeatedly suffered harm, enduring added abuse, insults, and disrespect, with countless unjust beatings, slanders, and false accusations. Though the Dao of Heaven is profound and distant, I dare not keep this hidden. Such persons deserve to be seized and interrogated. I reverently petition the Three Heavenly Bureaus of the Most High to issue a special decree to the Three Officials, to apprehend and record the nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of parents of so-and-so’s family, and consign them to the Northern Prison and Earthly Dungeon, to the darkest recesses. In proportion to their indulgence and the contempt shown for the Dao of Heaven, I command the local earth gods, the true officials of the neighborhood altars, and the deities of the community temples to seize the three hun and seven po of so-and-so, in accordance with the statutes on disrespect for the master and the Dao, and to examine and question them without delay. I reverently summon the Generals of the Celestial Net, three thousand six hundred in number, to follow the words of my petition, proceed to so-and-so’s home, and seize and sever his three hun and seven po, delivering them to the Celestial Prison to be beaten to death with iron rods. I further summon the twelve hundred Examiners each from the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, the Heaven of Great Surplus, and the Heaven of Great Red, to descend as one and point into so-and-so’s body, interrogating and punishing him for his contempt of the Dao and its laws. The descendant of the Master—his name is invoked—bears no light guilt; the scriptures and laws do not permit it. He ought to be thoroughly investigated and punished.

I further petition the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water to interrogate and punish so-and-so for his cruel enmity toward the Dao of Heaven, his disdain for the master, his contempt for the law, his failure to follow the teachings of the Dao, and his reckless indulgence of his own will—cursing, abusing, or beating and striking, or using official power to oppress and coerce the person of the Master’s descendant. In accordance with the statutes of the Three Officials, I pray that the celestial generals and officers apply their minds and intent to this matter, that the efficacy may be swiftly verified. On the day results are achieved, merits shall be reported and promotions sought, without betraying the trust in this petition. I humbly beseech the Most High to discern and heed my plea. I, your servant, present this memorial to seize, interrogate, and sever the wicked man who has given free rein to his heart in cursing and abuse. Ashamed and mortified, I submit this memorial to the Three Heavenly Bureaus of the Most High, awaiting your decree. I, your servant, bow my head twice in awe and trepidation, prostrating myself to make this known.

Your servant [Name],
Before the Jade Throne of the Great Clarity, the Celestial Elder of the Boundless Dao of the Three Heavens, the Heavenly Thearch, the Nine Elder Perfected Lords of the Grotto-Heaven, the Venerable Lords of the Nine Qi, the myriad layers of the Dao and qi, and the One Thousand Two Hundred Official Lords.

In the Year of [Tai Sui],

Memorial of Transformation and Return.

To the Orthodox Unity of the Great Mystery Capital, the Left Rectifying Qi of the Celestial Master’s Yangping Administration:

Your servant bows his head twice and respectfully addresses this memorial. In accordance with the documents, the male disciple of [State], [County], [Township], and [Village], aged [X] years, now presents this oral petition. Born of flesh as a mortal, descendant of the hundred officials, I have been blessed across a thousand generations to serve the Great Dao. Yet, being but a dull and foolish mortal, unworthy and insignificant, I dare to submit this plea to the Heavenly Bureaus.

Recently, my household slave, named [Name], aged [X] years, suddenly absconded. On the [X] day of the [X] month, he stole my property—clothing, bedding, and miscellaneous goods—and fled, hiding in the east, west, south, or north to evade his master. He repays my nurture with betrayal. On the [X] day of the [X] month, I recaptured this slave and brought him back to my residence, binding him to prevent further escape. Yet, at [X] hour on [X] night, he broke his bonds, his wicked heart unrelenting, and fled once more, rebelling against his master. This has occurred repeatedly over the years, his escapes and betrayals too numerous to count. He steals my resources, harbors malice, and his evil intent grows ever more severe.

Day after day, my entire household—men and women, bond and free, young and old—has searched for him in vain. We have scoured the nearby and distant mountains and wilds in all directions, yet his whereabouts remain unknown. He hides his tracks, evades his master, and refuses to be seen. Now, my fortune wanes while misfortune grows; my household suffers loss, and the slave’s stolen wealth scatters, no longer mine. With wholehearted devotion, I rely upon the Great Dao to protect me.

Today, I present [X] feet of white silk, [X] measures of rice, and offerings from bond and free, bringing them before the Three Treasures in [Name] Abbey. I beseech you to perform the Rite of Transformation and Subjugation, that this slave, [Name], may be confounded and bewildered, his heart filled with turmoil, unable to flee. Let him return to my home, raving and mad, crying out in the streets until he is seen by me. Let him no longer evade or flee, but be compelled to return at once. I await the swift manifestation of your grace, that your merit may be proclaimed and your oath fulfilled.

As a humble servant charged with this duty, how could I fail to submit this memorial? I respectfully invoke the mighty soldiers of the Five Emperors, the Qin-Hu Generals, the Five Roads, the Crossroads, and all the prison wardens and stalwart warriors. I implore you to strictly capture and transform this slave, [Name], preventing his further escape or evasion from his master’s household. Seize his three *hun* and seven *po* and deliver them to the local earth god, commanding the spirits of my household’s deceased ancestors, the Stove God, the Three Generals guarding my home, and the twenty-four divine officers to join in capturing this slave. Let him no longer rebel, but return to his master at once.

Let the talismanic writ be posted at the gates of the local earth god, the Stove God, and the suspended corpse, to be examined thrice daily. Compel him to transform his rebellious heart and confused mind, forcing him to return to my home without further escape. Pursue him relentlessly. When this matter is graciously resolved, I shall duly report your merit and reward your labor in accordance with the law.

Your servant, [Name], prostrates himself and submits this memorial at the risk of death.

Respectfully submitted.

I humbly invoke the Twenty-Four Stellar Generals to transform and subdue this rebel, compelling him to return to my home. Let him not hide in the east, west, south, or north, nor in the nearby or distant wilds. Seize him swiftly, that he may appear before his master at once. When this matter is resolved, I shall promptly report your efficacy and repay your grace.

Let him turn his heart and return of his own accord, unwavering in any direction, as previously agreed!

Upon this talisman’s arrival, let the Celestial Bureau seize the three *hun* and seven *po* souls of the slave [Name] and deliver them to the City God’s Grand Temple for arrest. Let him be swiftly transformed and awakened from delusion, that he may not rebel or flee, nor evade his master. Should he attempt to hide in any direction—near or far—let his *hun* and *po* be seized again and delivered to the County Magistrate, the Merit Officer, and the Registrar. Let a direct talisman summon the ghosts to hang his corpse at the community gate, where he shall be examined thrice daily and nightly, swiftly compelled to abandon his delusion, and prevented from fleeing afar. Let him return to his dwelling and submit to his master’s care. Should he rebel and flee again, let him be struck with madness, heart-suspension, cholera, and qi-dysentery, unable to rise. On the day of verification, let swift messengers report the merit and reward the labor, that trust may not be betrayed.

From [Name], a male disciple of [State], [County], [Village], [Age] years, this petition is made to transform the household slave [Name], that he may swiftly return home and submit to his master, without rebellion or deviation, as previously agreed.

Respectfully submitted as above, with wholehearted devotion.

To the Great Dao, this humble servant petitions for the return and transformation of the slave [Name], all as previously stated. On this day, I reverently present a token of sincerity: a silk kerchief, one *shi* and two *dou* of rice, one hundred sheets of white paper, a brush, and an inkstick, to establish my earnest plea. I beseech you to compel the return and subjugation of the slave [Name], who has fled from his master [Name B], and whose whereabouts remain unknown. Let him be swiftly led astray, his desires thwarted, and let him be sternly seized and made to return to [Name B].

This humble servant, dull and unworthy, has failed to atone for his faults through merit. I, [Name], prostrate in awe and dread, kowtow and submit this vermilion petition, a solemn memorial, to the Celestial Bureaus. I implore the Heavenly Officials, the Generals, the Most High Lords and Venerable Ones, the Lady of the Heavenly Master’s Gate, and the Lords of the Five Qi: may you deign to examine my plea with compassion. Let the matter be conveyed to the Lords of the Constellations and the Lords of the Hosts of Qi, and to the millions of soldiers and all beings, that they may capture and return the fugitive slave [Name]. Let him be swiftly disabused of his delusion and made to return to his master, prevented from fleeing afar or losing his way. Should he persist in rebellion, return home, or betray his master with unrepentant malice, I invoke the Lord of the Net of Heaven with his million soldiers to block and encircle all roads, bind and restrain him, and allow no escape, that he may be compelled to return to his master.

I further invoke the City God Zhang Yuanfan of the local shrine to hang his corpse at the community gate, as previously described.

I reverently summon:
- The Azure Emperor of the East, with his 810,000 soldiers;
- The Vermilion Emperor of the South, with his 640,000 soldiers;
- The White Emperor of the West, with his 360,000 soldiers;
- The Black Emperor of the North, with his 250,000 soldiers;
- The Yellow Emperor of the Center, with his 12,000 soldiers.

Let them unite in purpose and strength to compel the return of the household slave [Name], who has fled his master with unrelenting malice. Let him lose his way, be unable to flee, and be swiftly seized and returned to his master, without loss or escape, as previously agreed. Upon the fulfillment of this vow and the safe return of the slave, let merit be reported and labor rewarded, and let the celestial soldiers and prison wardens be duly honored, that trust may not be betrayed.

Relying upon the Two Officials, the Direct Envoys, the Merit Officers of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Attendants, the Spirits of the Dark Intestines, the Judgment Chariot Officers of the Vermilion Talismans, and the Courier Officials of the Rushing Winds—each dispatched in pairs—I humbly petition the Heavenly Officials on behalf of [Name] for the return of the household slave [Name], who has fled his master. Let him not be lost or allowed to wander east, west, south, or north, but let him lose his way and emerge of his own accord to return home. I submit this vermilion petition and linked memorial to you, my lord.

This humble servant, [Name], unworthy and insignificant, dares not refuse or delay. I kowtow in dread and prostrate myself in submission, beseeching the Heavenly Officials to deign to examine my plea. Let it ascend to the Three Celestial Bureaus, and may I await your decree.

I, your servant [Surname], invoke the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Venerable of the Three Heavens and the Boundless Great Dao; the Heavenly Emperor and Venerable Lord; the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital; the Venerable Lords of the Nine Qi and the myriad hosts of the Dao; the Twelve Hundred Officials of the Great Clarity; and the Jade Court of the Great Clarity.

The ritual of the Orthodox Unity’s petition is now complete for the year [Year].
