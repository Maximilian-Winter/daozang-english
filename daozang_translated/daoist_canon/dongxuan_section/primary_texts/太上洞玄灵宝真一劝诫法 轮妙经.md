**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Perfected-One Exhortation and Admonition Dharma-Wheel Wondrous Sutra**

**Sutra Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Perfected-One Exhortation and Admonition Dharma-Wheel Wondrous Sutra*

Spoken by the Supreme High Mystery Grand Ultimate Three Officials Preceptor, the Perfected-One of the Mysterious Unity.

The *Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Perfected-One Exhortation and Admonition Dharma-Wheel Wondrous Sutra* was anciently concealed within the Supreme Six Harmonies Mysterious Terrace. The scripture was attended by Dragon-Flower Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Jade Lads, who scattered blossoms and burned incense to guard the sacred text. According to the statutes, it was transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas. By the command of the Supreme, it was entrusted to the Left Immortal Duke of the Grand Ultimate.

The Left Immortal Duke of the Grand Ultimate, while dwelling in seclusion on Mount Tiantai to repent sins, burned incense and offered repentance, contemplating the Real and pondering the Dao. For a hundred days, numinous spirits manifested in wondrous forms—now appearing, now vanishing—amidst radiant clouds above the void, their light subtly illuminating the hall of purification. The Immortal Duke, sensing his suffering had deeply moved the celestial perfected, devoted himself to profound study with extraordinary diligence. Before a year of purification had passed, he succeeded in invoking the descent of the exalted sages.

On the night of the gēngyín day of the first month of the Yuan-Zheng era, suddenly a flying cloud from the cinnabar empyrean bore the Eight Radiant Jade Chariot, its jeweled canopy ablaze with luminous splendor, wafting incense and scattering blossoms as it floated through the void. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, celestial perfected resplendent beyond description, descended in procession. Dragons soared and simurghs sang, phoenixes danced in flight, lions and white cranes roared and chanted in harmony. Countless jade lads and maidens, each bearing the staffs of life and demon-subduing banners, rode in ornate carriages drawn by scaled steeds, their divine conveyances dense with numinous mist. In an instant, the celestial perfected alighted together.

The first announced himself as the Supreme Perfected-One of the Mysterious Unity, Yu Luoqiao; the second as the Supreme Perfected-One of the Mysterious Unity, Guang Miaoyin; the third as the Supreme Perfected-One of the Mysterious Unity, Zhen Dingguang. All three bore circular aureoles that illumined the ten directions, seated upon golden lotus thrones with brocade cushions. Their attending officials, bearing flowered banners, burned rare incenses and held aloft tables of azure void-stone, draped with eight-hued silken cloths.

The *Perfected-One Exhortation and Admonition Dharma-Wheel Wondrous Sutra* was suspended in a canopy of flying script and seven-jeweled tassels, its divine characters blazing in the boundless void. Thereupon, the Immortal Duke prostrated himself in reverence, too awed to speak, his heart filled with joy and his spirit at ease, as he knelt to receive the admonitions.

The Supreme Perfected-One of the Mysterious Unity, Yu Luoqiao, addressed the Left Immortal Duke of the Grand Ultimate, saying: "Through kalpas of accumulated practice, you have worn your body thin to save beings, delivering the living and bestowing kindness even upon grasses and trees. Dwelling in forests and hills, you have guarded your essence and endured hardship, reverently serving your masters without weariness. Your苦志 has been steadfast and resolute, and thus you have attained supreme virtue. In the Purple Orchid Terrace of the Golden Gates of the Upper Clarity Palace, there is a jade script with purple characters recording your towering merit, your conduct aligning with that of the highest immortals. The Supreme has commanded the Perfected-One of the Grand Ultimate, Xu Laile, to safeguard you as the Great Preceptor of the Three Caverns. Now, I am further commanded to serve as your first preceptor of deliverance. Sit once more, and I shall impart to you the essential instructions of the Dharma-Wheel of exhortation and admonition, that you may know your past lives, the sins and blessings of former existences, and the karmic retribution of this present life. Do you wish to hear these teachings? If you can uphold them, then listen in stillness."

The Perfected-One of Supreme Mystery and Primordial Unity, Radiant Wondrous Sound, the Second Realized One, addressed the Venerable Left Immortal Duke, saying: "You have revolved through the wheel of birth and death, forging karmic bonds with goodness across kalpas, accumulating ripened merit life after life without cease. Forsaking glory and relinquishing rank, you entrusted your body to secluded groves, enduring hunger and cold upon desolate ruins. Yet you never spoke of the Dao, revering the Precious One of your master as though facing the divine. Your heart, gentle and yielding, rejoiced whether sitting or rising. Through unbroken fasting and arduous contemplation, your refined essence reached afar with clarity, and thus your name was inscribed in the Upper Clarity.

The Supreme has commanded me to serve as your second preceptor of deliverance. I shall fully impart to you the essential instructions of exhortation and admonition concerning the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the roots of birth and death, that you may know the anguish and torment of your hun-soul and spirit, and whence they arise. Do you wish to hear these teachings? I shall expound them to you; you must uphold them."

The Perfected-One of Supreme Mystery and Primordial Unity, True Stability and Radiance, the Third Realized One, addressed the Venerable Left Immortal Duke, saying: "Across seven generations, you have shown compassion, cutting from your own mouth to save the destitute, extending benevolence even to birds and beasts, so that blessings flowed to your descendants and grace bathed your person. Moreover, you accumulated diligence, personally serving the Precious One of your master—never longing for furs in the cold, nor deviating from fasting when hungry. Amidst hardship in mountain forests, your focused devotion never wavered. The Purple Treasury embraced your true nature, and a wondrous light arose from your nape. Thus, the Most High descended in hidden response, bestowing the rank of Immortal Minister to requite your past virtue—how towering indeed!

The Supreme now commands me to serve as your third preceptor of deliverance. I shall now impart to you the essential instructions of exhortation and admonition on the boundless wondrous penetration, the transformation of spirit, and the entry into samādhi. Do you wish to follow these teachings? I shall expound them; you must cultivate them in silence."

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One declared:

When Heaven and Earth were established, the Primordial Beginning divided and distinguished them; yin and yang unfolded and transformed, and the Five Agents took their positions. Without above or below, without Heaven or Earth, without great or small, within the colorless and beyond the formless—all received the empty cavern, taking qi as their origin. The origin arose from the beginning, the beginning from the origin, the origin from the mysterious, and the Three gave birth to the myriad things. None failed to inherit this succession, their warp and weft spanning the Eight Extremes, ensuring the enduring existence of Heaven and Earth.

All Perfected Ones and lofty immortals, the Realized Ones who have attained the Dao from the ten directions and the boundless worlds as numerous as motes of dust—none, even after countless kalpas, have lacked a master. All received the precious scriptures of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity from their masters, thereby becoming lofty immortals, supreme sages, and guides of the ten directions. The master is a treasure. Without a master, the Dao cannot be accomplished; without a master, there is no progress; without a master, there is no birth; without a master, there is no deliverance; without a master, there is no immortality. Thus, the master is my father. If you do not revere your master, the Dao will not descend; demons will corrupt your body, and how then shall you ride the Eight Radiance Dragon Chariot or ascend the Jade Terrace of the Great Ultimate?

Confucian teachings possess the Three Tombs and Five Classics, the Eight Cords and Nine Mounds—all instructing scholars through the master’s guidance, who in turn rely on their masters to attain understanding. How much more so for you, who now study the Dao of Highest Clarity, aspiring to ascend and soar, to eternally enjoy boundless fortune? To slight your master while practicing the Dao, seeking the flight of flesh, is like casting a night-shining pearl away, losing your one true path.

Yet you have diligently cultivated through countless kalpas, tirelessly turning without weariness. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, your name in vermilion script and purple characters shall be inscribed upon the Mysterious Terrace, and you shall ascend to the rank of Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate. But if your three masters are not complete and your exhortations and admonitions remain unfulfilled, you shall not yet ascend to the palace of the Great Ultimate. The Most High, considering your past merits weighty and profound, has commanded us to serve as your three masters, transmitting to you the essential instructions to perfect your Dao. Thus, you shall swiftly ascend beyond the Three Realms, roam the Highest Clarity, arrive in person at the Golden Portal, and receive the title of Immortal Duke.

The Immortal Duke bowed in reverence, prostrating himself to receive the teachings, saying: "I only wish the Heavenly Worthy will take pity and compassion upon me. Now, expound these teachings, and I shall immediately receive and practice them."

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One declared:

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Wheel of Exhortation and Admonition of the Most High Perfected Unity* is commanded by the Nine Heavens to appear but once every forty thousand kalpas. The Most High Void Sovereign formerly transmitted it to the Most High Great Dao Lord; the Great Dao Lord transmitted it to the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity; the Heavenly Emperor transmitted it to the Later Sage Lord Emperor of the Golden Portal. Now, it is bestowed upon Immortal Dukes, Immortal Lords, and Immortal Kings who have already become Perfected Ones. It is not transmitted to middle immortals or the various immortals of the Five Marchmounts.

Since the *Chart of the Nameless Mysterious Emperor* and the *Records of the Three Purities and the Jade Writ of the Great Ultimate*, none but those of Immortal Duke caliber may partake in its teachings. This scripture is lofty and wondrous, cherished by the Most High, concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies. Immortal youths and maidens constantly treasure and secretly attend its truth. Merely glimpsing its titles brings blessings to seven generations of ancestors, causing the souls of the deceased to ascend to Heaven, bestowing fortune upon the entire clan, and ensuring the prosperity and flourishing of the household, with generations producing the worthy and enlightened. Cultivating it leads to riding cloud chariots and dragon carriages, ascending in broad daylight. To lightly reveal or slight it, to slander or defame its sacred writ, invites punishment upon your body. The retribution of sin and fortune is clear—be cautious and vigilant.

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One addressed the Immortal Duke, saying:

Formerly, I received from the Most High Limitless Great Dao Lord the *Wondrous Scripture of the Wheel of Exhortation and Admonition of the Perfected Unity*. In practicing and serving my master, I burned incense six times daily, prostrating and circumambulating. I always first paid homage to my master, visualizing him with my heart and eyes, seeing my master as the scripture. Without my master, I could not see the scripture. Once I beheld the scripture, my master stood before me. I endured hunger and thirst, following my master east and west. I received my master’s instructions, diligently and thoroughly studying the scripture, suffering as if cut by a knife or pierced by a poisoned awl. I served with utmost reverence, never daring to falter, enduring pain without complaint, bearing poison without utterance. Thus, after four hundred million years, the true Dao was accomplished, and I ascended to the rank of Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One. Now, I have again received my master’s command to serve as your third preceptor of deliverance. Can you emulate me? If you can, I shall expound the scripture to you.

The Immortal Duke bowed his head in homage and gratitude, addressing the Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One, the third preceptor of deliverance, saying:

"Your disciple is fortunate to gaze upon the Heavenly countenance, to receive your instructions, and further to be taught essential words—an immeasurable distinction, beyond what mere words can express. Reflecting upon my karmic endowments, I was born into the Dharma gate, from youth cherishing the supreme Dao, aspiring to transcendence. I maintained long fasts in secluded peaks, my thoughts fixed upon the lofty sages. Unaware, the Heavenly Worthy glanced into the hidden valley, bestowing the true Dao. I, dark and ignorant, am ashamed beyond measure. Yet, looking forward, I pledge my heart to the Three Luminaries, personally upholding my master’s instructions, never daring to falter. Through ten thousand kalpas, my resolve shall not waver. I revere and follow the Dharma teachings, obeying only my master. I eternally wish for your compassion, to enlighten what I have not yet understood, to reveal profound teachings, to expound the Dharma and admonish, that I may be uplifted and redeemed. I prostrate myself to receive your command, vowing to uphold it."
