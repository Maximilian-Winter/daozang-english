*The Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Gods from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*

The Golden Writ of the Three Treasures’ Great Possession:

The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Great Cavern, and the Heavenly Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral *qi* of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the *qi* of the Primal Chaos of the Utmost Void, the Jade Clarity of the Loftiest Mystery—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine hundred million *qi*. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han era, it transformed and gave birth to the Heavenly Treasure Lord. When the scripture emerged, it was titled the Highest Great Possession, Jade Clarity Palace.

The Numinous Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Cavernous Mystery, and the Numinous Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral *qi* of the Numinous Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the *qi* of the Crimson Chaos of the Utmost Void, the Purple Clarity of the Loftiest Mystery—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine myriad *qi*. Later, at the opening of the Dragon Han era’s chart, it transformed and gave birth to the Numinous Treasure Lord. After one kalpa, in the first year of the Crimson Clarity era, when the scripture emerged to deliver humanity, it was titled the Upper Clarity, Jade Capital of the Mystic Metropolis, Seven Treasures, Purple Tenuity Palace.

The Divine Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Cavernous Divinity, and the Divine Treasure Venerable One is the ancestral *qi* of the Divine Treasure Lord. The Venerable One is the *qi* of the Profound Stillness and Mystic Pervasion, the Utmost Clarity of the Primordial Void—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety myriad *qi*. Later, in the first year of the Crimson Clarity era, it transformed and gave birth to the Divine Treasure Lord. After two kalpas, in the first year of the Highest Sovereign era, when the scripture emerged, it was titled the Three Sovereigns’ Cavernous Divinity, Supreme Clarity, Great Ultimate Palace.

Though these three titles differ in era and name, their essence is one, divided into the three *qi* of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin to govern. The Three Treasures are the august deities of the three *qi*, titled the Generators of the Three *Qi*. The three titles unite to generate the nine *qi*.

The nine *qi* emerged before the Great Void, concealed within the empty cavern, without light or image, without form or name, without color or thread, without sound or voice. They guided and steered the world, opening the mysterious pervasion. The three hues intermingled in chaos, now existing, now vanishing. As the revolutions reached their numerical extremity, the three *qi* radiated light. The *qi* clarified and ascended, accumulating yang to form heaven; the *qi* congealed and coagulated, accumulating stagnation to form earth. The nine *qi* arrayed in order, and the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, yin and yang, the Five Agents, the people, and all beings received generation and completion. The myriad transformations of heaven and earth—without the nurturing of the Three Origins or the guidance of the nine *qi*—could not come into being.

The three *qi* are the lords of heaven and earth; the nine *qi* are the roots of the myriad things. Thus, their triune union perfects virtue, reaching the ultimate of heaven and earth.

When a person receives life within the womb, the Three Origins nurture and nourish, and the nine *qi* knit the form. After nine months, the spirits are arrayed, the *qi* fills and enables sound, the sound is yet incomplete, and the spirits are fully present—thus the Nine Heavens proclaim jubilation. The Great One holds the tally, the Thearchs confer ranks, the Directors record and inscribe the register, the Lords of Fate determine the allotment, the Five Thearchs oversee birth, the Holy Mother guards the chamber, and the celestial and terrestrial spirits of the Three Realms stand in full attendance. The Marshal of the Nine Heavens stands in the courtyard, facing east, and recites the *Nine Heavens’ Precious Chapters on the Generation of Gods* nine times. If the child is male, the myriad spirits chant "reverence"; if female, they chant "obedience." If male, the Lord of Fate respectfully assents; if female, the Lord of Fate respectfully complies—only then is the child born. If the Marshal of the Nine Heavens does not issue the command, and the myriad spirits do not chant "reverence" or "assent," the child will never be born.

When a person is reborn into the human realm, their form is bathed in the Great Yang, startling heaven and earth—such honor is difficult to surpass. The celestial perfected and terrestrial spirits, the Three Realms all attend—this is not a trifling matter. At the moment of birth, it is not to be deemed base.

Thus, one who can cherish their form, preserve their spirit, honor their *qi*, and secure their root will never suffer death or decay, attaining immortality. Flesh and bones will ascend together, mounting the Three Clarities, uniting in virtue with the three *qi* and aligning with the nine *qi*.

Yet, though people receive life, they often fail to revere their *qi*, honor their form, treasure their life, or cherish their spirit, bringing about their own death and decay, severing themselves from their original truth.

The *Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Gods* are the flying, mysterious *qi* of the Three Caverns, harmonizing into sound and coalescing into numinous script. They blend the hundred spirits, conceal their inner names in hidden rhymes, and knit the generative *qi* into form—these are the natural chapters.

When the Heavenly Treasure recites them, they open the light of heaven and earth.
When the Numinous Treasure recites them, they open the souls of the Nine Dark Regions’ eternal night.
When the Divine Treasure recites them, they command the myriad spirits.
When the Great One recites them, they complete the body’s spirits.
When the Thearchs recite them, they knit the form.
When the Nine Heavens recite them, they generate humanity.
When scholars recite them, they ascend to heaven.
When ghosts and spirits hear them, they ascend and transmigrate.
When ordinary people hear them, they endure long.
When dark souls hear them, they are delivered and opened.
When withered and decayed things hear them, they emit smoke.
When infants hear them, they can speak.
When dead remains hear them, they return to life.

The Three Treasures’ divine mysteries are the roots of the myriad beings. Thus, they are not known to ghosts and spirits, nor heard by ordinary people.

Those who study the supreme Dao, yearning for immortality, and attain liberation through the corpse—extinguishing and transcending the wheel of rebirth—will ultimately return to the immortal Dao. Form and spirit unite, never parting, both entering the true Dao.

Without this text, the womb would stagnate, the dead *qi* would solidify the root, the true radiance would not be preserved, the generative *qi* would lack its conduit, the nine apertures would be obstructed, the body would not generate spirits, and one would merely receive a single form, as if borrowing *qi* to move.

Those who master this method may attain the natural effortlessly.

The Three Treasures are august and revered; the Nine Heavens’ perfected are of the utmost truth. They are concealed within the Great Possession, the nine-tiered golden lattice of the Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Unless heaven and earth open anew, this text will not emerge. It is a scripture forbidden by the Primordial Beginning—if ghosts or spirits were to hear it, those who steal it would suffer ten thousand kalpas under the wind’s blade, their souls dying without rebirth.

Those who follow the precepts and revere them shall unite form and spirit in transcendence. Within the Three Primordials’ palace, if one’s name is inscribed in gold, with purple characters recorded in the celestial registers, then in the life to come, one is destined to become a divine immortal of the Three Clarities—such a person is fit to receive this text. When the karmic conditions align, one should present gold and treasures, serve the master with devotion, and receive the scripture in accordance with the rites of the covenant. Seal the heart and practice diligently; beware of careless disclosure, lest the wind’s blade test the body.

The method of cultivation: observe a thousand-day fast, disengage from worldly affairs, exhaust all sensory leaks, pacify the mind and recite in silence. Burn pure incense, uphold the precepts, enter the chamber facing east, knock the teeth nine times, regulate the voice and rectify the *qi*, then chant the sacred verses.

After one recitation, the sound ascends to the Nine Heavens.
After two recitations, heaven and earth pay reverence.
After three recitations, the Three Realms bow in homage.
After four recitations, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals.
After five recitations, the Five Emperors attend the perfected.
After six recitations, the demon kings submit.
After seven recitations, the stellar lodges halt their gates.
After eight recitations, the darkest night is illuminated.
After nine recitations, all heavens descend, and every spirit, without exception, guards the carriage.

One recitation pierces the heavens, unblocking the womb’s origin.
Two recitations resound through the earth, dissolving the knots of the fetal root.
Three recitations invoke divine homage, refining the soul’s gate into transcendence.
Four recitations summon the Heavenly Kings’ descent, sealing the gate of the *po*.
Five recitations bring the Five Emperors’ attendance, cooling the viscera.
Six recitations subdue the demon kings, generating fluids in the stomach conduit.
Seven recitations brighten the stellar lodges, opening the apertures to hearing.
Eight recitations illuminate the darkest night, aligning the three divisions and eight luminaries, perfecting form and spirit.
Nine recitations bring the descent of all heavens, and the three barriers, five viscera, six palaces, nine palaces, golden towers, jade chambers, twelve layered gates, purple portals, jade seals—along with the thirty-six thousand joints—all at once generate spirits from their primordial root.

Nine recitations complete one cycle. When one cycle is fulfilled, the Three Realms record one’s name, the Five Emperors acknowledge kinship, and one is titled a Perfected.
Ten cycles harmonize the *qi*, enabling mastery over the myriad spirits; the demon kings act as guarantors, and one is ranked among the heavens.
A hundred cycles harmonize the spirit, allowing effortless attainment of the natural; the Taiyi talisman is bestowed, and the Primordial Lords grant rebirth.
A thousand cycles harmonize the numinous, enabling one to sit in death or stand in disappearance; jade boys and maidens are commanded to serve east and west.
Ten thousand cycles complete the Dao, allowing one to ride the dragon chariot and ascend at dawn.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, dwelling in tranquil seclusion, reposed within the cloud palace’s Yellow Chamber, amidst the seven-jeweled curtains. Cultivating simplicity, refining the true in empty azure, savoring profound wisdom, he contemplated the generation of spirits, fathoming the subtleties of the Great Primal, and his whistling echoed through the Nine Heavens. At that time, the Flying Heavenly Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit King, the Jade Assistant Prime Minister, and the Four Coordinating Attendants of the Dawn—having observed the pure fast and raised their standards—stood in attendance beside him. Leaning upon the jade countenance in wondrous resonance, gazing upward with divine eyes to open their robes, they secretly rejoiced in the sacred verses, feasting upon the celestial sounds to receive life. Seizing the moment to awaken, they exposed their hearts to the numinous gaze.

Thereupon, the Flying Heavenly Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit King, stepped forward, bowed deeply, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “This humble servant, by fortunate encounter, has been permitted to attend your divine carriage. Though unworthy, I have been cleansed by the hidden law, deeply awakened to the congealed mystery, and elevated to the rank of Spirit King. I govern life and death, encompass the heavens’ weariness, oversee the seven awakenings, gaze afar into distant lands, observe the Prime Minister, and face the Attendants of the Dawn. Now is the time to seize the moment, respond to the encounter, tread the Nine Great Yangs, penetrate the principles of the Yin talisman, and extend my hand to the myriad people.”

The great cycle nears its term, the reckoning ends in the jia-shen year. The vast currents sweep away filth, calamities fill the heavens, and the Three Officials brandish their brushes to assess and separate the destinies of beings. They tally merits and transgressions, where good and evil must be distinguished.

From the Crimson Clarity era to the first year of the Supreme August, according to the Primordial Yang Jade Treasury, those who received deliverance numbered two hundred forty thousand. From the Kaihuang era onward, as the count reaches jia-shen, the ranks of the heavens are in disarray, the offices of immortals lie vacant, the bureaucracy is unfilled, and all wandering functionaries await selection. According to the Primordial Yang Jade Calendar, across three generations, those who have cultivated goodness, accumulated merit, been commended by the Three Realms, and protected by the Five Emperors—whose names are recorded in the heavens—shall be chosen: one hundred thousand to fill these posts. An additional one hundred twenty thousand shall be selected to serve as reserve officials.

Such examples include those whose names are preordained in the Mysterious Register, whose bone forms align with immortality, or who have passed away and turned the wheel of karmic conditions; those whose devotion to the Three Treasures is profound, whose good works reach the heavens; those who have made offerings to the Three Treasures and been praised by the Three Officials; those who have observed fasts and upheld precepts, accumulating merit through their deeds; those who have dispersed wealth and treasures to establish halls of the Dao; those who have rescued the destitute and delivered gods and humans; or those who have rendered full service to the Three Masters, whose names are recorded in the celestial offices. When the ledgers are tallied, the Three Officials concur, and their destinies are inscribed in reverse order, with distinctions made above and below, not a hair’s breadth overlooked.

Moreover, the Nine Dark Prisons, by the mandate of the Nine Dragon Talisman from the Eastern Florescence Azure Palace, shall release the male and female souls of the dead recorded in the Nine Dark Jade Treasury—those whose names bear goodness and whose merits are complete, who are due to receive deliverance—numbering three hundred twenty thousand. These shall replenish the people after the jia-shen purgation, ushering in an era of great abundance.

At this time, life and death converge, good and evil are judged, and those who pass through shall truly rejoice. Yet the Three Officials press urgently, their documents teeming; the Dragon Gate receives the assembly, the Bird Mother oversees the immortals, the ten thousand sages manifest their presence day and night without rest. Merits and transgressions are weighed equally, ensuring no bias in life or death. This tumultuous chaos is also my concern.

The great term is imminent, and in every matter, neglect looms. I constantly fear being ensnared by the public tribunal. I have heard that the Heavenly Worthy enacts the transformation of great compassion, bestowing mercy upon the multitudes, and opens the mysteries of the Nine Heavens to deliver the countless people. The luminous statutes contain prohibitions beyond the reach of this humble servant’s understanding. Yet the great reckoning draws near, the jia-shen year approaches its end, the cycle of deliverance presses urgently, and the great Dharma must be enacted. May those of sincere heart be heard amid the tallying, may the Dharma’s sound reach their ears, may their eyes and ears be opened, and may the yet unawakened be exhorted and transformed.

For this reason, I dare to present this, though I fear offending the celestial countenance. I pray for your compassion and the gift of what I have not yet heard.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy stroked the table, raised his voice in lofty resolve, composed his spirit in distant contemplation, and intoned the cavernous chapters, chanting the resonant jade-like verses. After a long while, he suddenly sighed and said: “The supreme model abides in emptiness, its principles subtle and profoundly obscure. The Dao reaches the double mystery, its qi crowns the Divine Empyrean. Its ultimate is hard to express, its wonder hard to surpass.

You, who hold the imperial seat, bear the office of Spirit King, whose flying celestial wings grace the jade towers, whose Four Ministers assist the bright wheel—your distant gaze surveys all, your oversight encompasses the boundless. You harmonize the myriad transformations and govern the multitudes. Now the great cycle begins its term, the Three and Five announce the time, the Hundred and Six respond to the moment, the Yang Nine surges forth, the vast springs stir their waves, ten thousand disasters assail the heavens, and the Four Palaces make their selections to replenish the seed people. The three generations are in turmoil, and good and evil must be distinguished.

You must labor for the multitudes, weary yourself for the Three Officials. At this juncture of rise and decline, action is required. I now entrust this to you; strive diligently.”

The precious scriptures are wondrous and weighty, the numinous sounds of the Nine Heavens are bestowed upon the exalted sages, not for ghosts or spirits to hear. The statutes of the Perfected are clear: once every forty thousand kalpas they are enacted. Now, in transgression of the prohibitions, I entrust them to you. Keep them secret; do not transmit them lightly.

He commanded the Marshal of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Gentleman Attendant of the Immortals to open the Purple Yang Jade Casket and the cloud-brocade satchel, and bring forth the *Nine Heavens’ Jade Chapters of Generating Spirits*. The Four Assistants took their places, the Five Elders oversaw the Perfected, the Great One commanded the hours, and the Jade Emperor intoned the covenant. Following the protocols of the *Illustrious Perfected Compendium*, they faced south, knelt in reverence, and presented the text to the Flying Heavenly Boundless Spirit King.

When the ritual was complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their positions. The Heavenly Worthy further instructed the Flying Heavenly Spirit King: “These chapters of the Nine Heavens are the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, the sound formed by the Three Assemblies, the true script condensed into being, uniting the hundred spirits and concealing their inner names in hidden rhymes. Thus, the Great One tests and observes, grasping the lives of the ten directions, gathering the Cavernous Void, and initiating the covenant in cinnabar and azure.

From innumerable kalpas past, those whose names are preordained in the imperial register of destiny have been unable to behold it. Those who glimpse its passages shall ascend with their nine generations of ancestors. When selecting those destined to become immortals, for seven hundred years they must maintain a thousand days of pure fasting, present gold and silk to pledge their hearts, and transmit it in accordance with the covenant. Guard it well, and you shall enjoy blessings; leak it, and calamity shall befall. Enjoy blessings, and your fortune shall extend to nine generations, your virtue weigh like mountains and seas. Incur calamity, and you shall be condemned for billions of kalpas, suffering as if boiled in poison or flayed by wind and blades. Can you not be vigilant?”

Above the layered heavens of clarity,
At the appointed time, they meet amidst auspicious clouds.
Jade scriptures scatter into the serene heart,
Solitary radiance seeks the numinous assembly.
Resplendent, rosy clouds spread,
No spirit’s lapel fails to transcend.
Jade branches flow with ethereal echoes,
Leisurely they speak of the void’s subtleties.
Numinous sounds vibrate through the hollow vastness,
The Nine Mysteries’ distant descendants are hard to fathom.
Responsive souls know no stagnation,
Coming and going like loosened sashes.
Illuminating the *Sheng Shen* chapter,
They wander on high without end or defeat.

All sages together proclaim their joy.

**Ninth Chapter of the Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knots, No-Attachment**
The Imperial Perfected’s Spirit Life, the Qi of Spontaneous Mystic Illumination

No knots, thus no attachments,
Profoundly clear in the void’s stillness.
The wheel of transformation knows no sequence,
Yet reckoning arrives—how could it be grasped?
Who says the formless realm is level?
Towering, it brims with hills and mounds.
The dark heart roams freely,
Aspiring to the pure spirit’s journey.
A fortunate encounter transcends years,
How can kalpas be named?
Floating souls follow old branches,
Returning to the womb by their own constancy.
Numinous resonance pervades the Great Void,
Treading upon the heavens’ icy heights.
Ferrying across, they stir ten thousand currents,
Silently coagulating, true spirits ascend.
No attachment, thus no sorrow,
In lofty contemplation, they bow and rise.

**Two Eulogies by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate**

The Great Dao, though without intent,
May be sought with devotion.
I await its chariot in the hollow vastness,
Gazing back at the veiled azure flow.
Beyond the Three Realms’ purity and radiance,
I wander the desolate Jade Capital.
Without the mysterious impetus of fate,
Who could fathom the dark’s allure?
Vast and clear, the Celestial River gleams,
Looking up and down, I embrace emptiness and softness.
The Seven Mysteries scatter their distant descendants,
Returning to the womb, they follow sinking and floating.
If the dark appointment silently coagulates,
The Yang’s ninth tribulation holds no fear.
Witnessing these meetings of departure and return,
Occasionally I linger in delay.
Externally, the body exists while the self endures,
True immortals gather with worthy companions.
Diligent in the dark’s allure,
Profound as the clear Celestial River’s waves.
Change and decay turn like a wheel,
Yet the camphor tree’s branches never alter.
With tranquil heart, I contemplate the Supreme Perfected,
Following fate, I comply with separation and union.
Resonance and response ever flow,
Spirit and awareness reach their own departure.
Wandering in simplicity, initially boundless,
Abundant thoughts pervade the Nine Clouds.
Flying roots scatter dark leaves,
Principle returns—not by any other means.
Ever able to recite the jade scriptures,
Mystic sounds pierce the distant heavens.

In the jia-shen year, great calamity arrives,
I rein in my wings at the Queen Mother’s abode.
Eternally I enjoy boundless ages,
How could I know the kalpas’ multitude?

The Efficacy of Scripture Recitation

Mount Qingcheng in Shu is the divine assembly hall of immortals. Formerly, Meng Chang, the lord of Shu, went there to pray and encountered the female immortal Magu, who attended beside the altar. The magistrate of Qingcheng presented a beautiful woman surnamed Zhang, whom Meng Chang took in and named Lihua. Together they dwelled in the Abbey of the Venerable Elder. One night, sudden thunder crashed, lightning flashed, violent rain poured, and fierce winds tore at the buildings, lifting them into the air and scattering them. Zhang Lihua perished and was buried at the foot of the mountain.

Decades later, on the Lantern Festival, the abbey’s Daoist Li Ruochong was returning at night and rested before the mountain. Suddenly, from the bamboo grove emerged a weeping woman who approached Ruochong and recited a poem:

*Alone beyond autumn, hairpins of cicadas fall,*
*White poplars stir the wind, sleep will not come.*
*In clarity I recall the favor of the pepper-scented chamber,*
*Tears soak my robes, jade ornaments ruined.*

Having spoken, she wept again and withdrew. Ruochong returned to the abbey and saw in the Hall of the Venerable Elder a gathering of officials in red shoes and court dress, all standing facing north as if in audience. Below the hall, in the corridors, were rows of sinners, and he saw a jailer lead a woman bound to an iron pillar, flogging her as she cried out in agony. Upon closer look, she was the woman he had met before the mountain.

Presently, a divine guardian pointed his sword at Ruochong and said: “Tonight is the Lantern Festival, when the Celestial Officials and the Venerable Elders of the Five Peaks review the records of life and death. You should not linger here.” Ruochong then hid until dawn and reported all to his master, Tang Dongqing.

Tang said: “Do you know who she is? She is Zhang Lihua. Once favored here, she profaned the Supreme Perfected and thus incurred this punishment. Since she revealed herself to you in verse, you must save her.”

Ruochong asked: “What method can save her?”

Tang replied: “Simply recite the *Nine Heavens’ Divine Birth Chapters* nine times and present a golden register with a white petition. This will spare her suffering and allow her to be reborn.” Coincidentally, the prefect of Linqiong, Tian Luchou, was holding a Yellow Register Retreat. Ruochong thereupon prepared the petition and memorial, recited the scripture ten times, and cast the staff into the ritual site, thereby delivering her. When he completed the ninth recitation, it was time to burn the petition, and Ruochong directed his merit toward her and burned it.

The next day, at the site of Zhang’s burial, four lines of sand appeared:

*Summoned in haste, the talisman-officer knocks at the night gate,*
*Following the golden petition, she emerges from darkness.*
*By the master’s deliverance, grace runs deep—*
*She receives the* Nine Recitations of the Divine Birth Scripture.

Ruochong reflected: The Most High, in compassion for all beings, established the gate of deliverance to aid the path of life and death. Alas! Those who wish to deliver their departed ancestors should truly revere this sacred text as the swiftest path to transcendence. This account is inscribed at the scripture’s end as an exhortation to devotion.
