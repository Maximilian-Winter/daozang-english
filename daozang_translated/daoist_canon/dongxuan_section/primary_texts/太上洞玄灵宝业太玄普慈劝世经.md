# 太上洞玄灵宝业太玄普慈劝世经

*The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Great Mystery Universal Compassion Exhortation Sutra*

Thus have I heard. At that time, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response and Salvation from Suffering, for the sake of sentient beings, provisionally manifested a body in the realm of mixed karmic retribution, the Heaven of Desire and Love. Accompanied by all the perfected immortals and their retinues, he arrived at the True Multitude Abode, seated upon a golden dais. Yet we, though granted the fortune of nearness, failed to encircle him with reverent mindfulness.

At that moment, among the assembly there was a perfected one named Universal Compassion, who prostrated himself upon the ground, knelt, and bowed his head to the feet of the Heavenly Worthy, addressing him thus: "Of all meritorious deeds, which is the foremost? To escape all suffering, which should be prioritized?"

Then the Heavenly Worthy replied to Universal Compassion, saying: "Good sons, you may listen carefully. It is like a person adorning a precious form, inseparable from manifold colors; just as a worldly person adorns the body, inseparable from clothing, headdresses, boots, and belts, embellishing what lies before the eyes, delighting all who behold. What you now ask is likewise: inseparable from the karma of the Five Precepts and Ten Good Deeds, adorning the causes of goodness as conditions for future lives.

You should reflect: sentient beings in the world know only how to adorn the dharmas of this world, unaware of how to adorn the dharmas of the future. Why is this? Because they cling to the world and cannot relinquish it. I observe that sentient beings, attached to worldly dharmas, are like maggots in filth, surrounded by excrement and foulness, yet deeming this bliss, unwilling to be born among humans to enjoy human pleasures. Sentient beings are thus: indulging in the five desires, they take this as joy, unwilling to be born in heaven to enjoy heavenly bliss.

Good sons, the heavens abide in bliss; when they regard the human realm, it is as worldly people view maggots in filth, dwelling together in impurity. Why is this? Because the body is impure—filled with pus, mucus, saliva, urine, and excrement. What does it mean to say the body is impure? Consider worldly people: they consume wine and meat, taking what enters from outside the body as pure, yet once inside, urine and excrement are deemed impure. Worldly people know only wine and meat as pure, but the heavens regard them as impure. Therefore, sentient beings indulge in wine, meat, and the pleasures of the five desires, though they clearly know these are impure—hence my comparison to maggots in filth.

Good sons, I observe that worldly people have many sins and little merit, much poverty and little wealth. Such conditions arise entirely from their failure to adorn meritorious karma. Now, you have earnestly sought to exhort the world.

Then Universal Compassion rejoiced in his heart, forgetting hunger and thirst, desiring only to hear this teaching and disseminate it throughout the world.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One Universal Compassion, saying: "You should now understand: if there is a person who stabilizes the mind without movement, enters the gate of samādhi, sits in the chamber of refined contemplation, and does not crave fragrances, flavors, forms, or sounds, through such causes and conditions, they attain the fruit of immovability and are born in the Immovable Realm. In the future, men and women who seek the karmic reward of immovability should enter samādhi, sit upright, and contemplate the mind. Among all dharma gates, this is foremost.

Good sons, if a person is indolent, hearing of a place of the Dao where the Dharma is expounded and precepts are bestowed, yet idly rests on a high pillow, unwilling to receive and uphold them—seeking coolness in summer and warmth in winter, singing, chanting, and delighting in this life, indulging in rich foods and following wayward desires, blocking the path of goodness and opening the gate of evil—such a person will reap no good fruit.

Good sons, if a person in the world has no other affairs or private sorrows, is unattached to forms, sounds, fragrances, flavors, tactile sensations, or dharmas, constantly directs the mind to contemplate and listen to the Great Vehicle, receives the precepts, and repents, such a person surpasses the former by a hundred thousand myriad times in merit, virtue, and karmic reward.

Good sons, if a person, upon receiving the Dharma, sets aside other affairs, temporarily ceases miscellaneous pursuits, and in the midst of coercion, joy and sorrow, wealth and honor, or poverty and hardship, is able to relinquish all and contemplate the wondrous sutras, receive the precepts, and repent, their merit, virtue, and karmic reward surpass the former by a hundred thousand myriad times.

Good sons, if there is a person who is deaf, blind, or disabled in hands or feet, afflicted in every part, yet draws near to a place of the Dao, seeking wondrous goodness, such a person, through the power of merit and virtue, will in a future life restore their bodily form, free from all illness and distress. If one, with a compassionate heart, constantly offers clothing and food to such a person, in future lives their karmic reward will surpass this life by a hundred thousand myriad times. How much more so for those who make offerings to the Three Treasures, the revered sutras, expound the Dharma in places of the Dao, copy sutras, or create images—their merit, virtue, and karmic reward are immeasurable.

Furthermore, Universal Compassion, you should reflect thus: if there is a person who has never once set foot on pure ground, such a common mortal is called 'footless'; one who has never once held a sutra scroll is called 'handless'; one who enters a place of the Dao, sees the Heavenly Worthy and all the scriptures, yet does not take refuge in the heart is called 'eyeless'; one who hears the verses and gāthās of the sutras yet does not commit them to memory is called 'earless.' Why is this? Feet, hands, eyes, and ears that do not generate merit and virtue will not receive karmic reward in future lives. Though born in the central lands, they may fall among border barbarians, and it is certain their feet, hands, eyes, and ears will not be whole.

Good sons, sentient beings in the world have many sins and little merit—how could they not pass through the eighteen hells?"

At that moment, the Perfected One of Universal Compassion, having heard these words, could not help but weep. Bowing his head to the Heavenly Worthy, he addressed him in verse:

In the Nine Dark Hells, there is no day of respite,
Day and night, the cries of suffering are heard without cease.
All stems from past lives where good was not cultivated;
After death, they are dragged one by one into the Iron City.
Ox-head jailers are by nature without compassion—
How could hell’s wardens possess mercy or kindness?
Fiery iron pellets fill their starving bellies,
Iron birds swoop down to peck out their eyes.
Creditors and foes are beyond counting,
Each debt repaid in full by the clarity of karmic retribution.
I pray this verse spreads throughout the world,
That gods and humans who hear this discourse
May cultivate the field of merit.

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Universal Compassion once more:
Sentient beings are benighted and ignorant, like one who walks at night upon the road ahead, recklessly exerting their strength, trampling upon a great poisonous serpent. Their body is wounded and harmed, the pain as if bones and flesh were ground together. Before ten days have passed, they meet an untimely death.
So too are humans: their natures stubborn and unyielding, they indulge their passions and commit sins. Before a hundred years have passed, they fall into hell, hands clutching sword-trees, feet treading upon blade-mountains, pounded by pestles, ground by millstones into fine powder. Gazing upon them from afar, my heart is pierced with sorrow.
Now I aid you with this verse:

If in life you refused to draw near the Three Treasures,
How in death can you escape the Nine Dark Hells?
Once fallen into the long-night prison of ignorance,
For a thousand years you will not awaken to the cause of life and death.
Iron beds burn like fire day and night,
The branches of sword-trees know not the autumn’s fall.
Weeping sentient beings and hungry ghosts,
Resentful jailers and ox-head demons—
Blade-mountains jagged, wounding hands and feet,
Furnace coals blazing, tormenting the wretched.
For eighteen thousand kalpas, no day of return;
Even if released, they are reborn as swine or dogs.
If in life you refused to practice kindness,
How as a ghost could you possess good causes?
This is the realm of the Three Wretched Paths and Eight Difficulties—
To whom can one voice such sorrow, suffering, and anguish?

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking this lament, he addressed the Perfected One of Universal Compassion again:
All sentient beings who dwell in this world create their own hells. Their original minds are constantly oppressed, entangled by afflictions, their bodies assailed by illness, cold and heat, pain and itching, hunger and poverty, freezing and starvation—all manner of discontent. Even if one were to speak of them for kalpas, they could not be exhausted.
Therefore, know this: ordinary beings in the world do not attain freedom.
Even if one has ample clothing and food, abundant cattle and horses, great wealth, slaves, servants, and attendants, such an ordinary being still does not attain freedom.
Because they lack freedom, they give rise to much anger, many deluded thoughts, much killing and harm, much greed and contention. Due to these causes and conditions, they must fall into hell, with no hope of escape.

The Heavenly Worthy then asked the Perfected One of Universal Compassion:
Is there any ordinary being who is without anger?
The Perfected One replied: No. Without a body, there is no anger; with a body, there is anger.

The Heavenly Worthy said to the Perfected One of Universal Compassion:
As the Dharma teaches, if there were no anger, nor killing, nor such things, then they would not be ordinary beings. It is because of anger that there are ordinary beings.
Ordinary beings arise from this cause; anger arises from ordinary beings.
Why is this?
If anger were exhausted, ordinary beings would be exhausted; if anger is not exhausted, ordinary beings are not exhausted. Thus, anger arises from ordinary beings, and hells arise from anger. Due to these causes and conditions, there are ordinary beings in hell and hells for ordinary beings.
Why is this?
If ordinary beings were exhausted, hells would be exhausted; if ordinary beings are not exhausted, hells are not exhausted. Cease anger, and there are no ordinary beings; without ordinary beings, there are no hells.

Furthermore, for the sake of exhorting the world, the Perfected One of Universal Compassion should tell sentient beings that worldly causes are impermanent—all must seize the moment.
When the time comes, things are new; when the time passes, things decline. This is called impermanence.
Why are impermanent beings called impermanent?
Consider a person at birth, called infancy; soon they crawl, then gradually pass through childhood, youth, adulthood, middle age, and old age. Such stages of life are impermanent in their decline.
Or consider times of illness, affliction, sorrow, suffering, pain, and death—such times are impermanent and uncertain.
If one dwells in the world from birth to death, committing all manner of evil beyond measure, upon death they enter the Three Wretched Paths. Tormented by poisonous pain and sorrow, with ox-head demons glaring in anger, their hearts and gall shattered, they bow their heads to heaven—no savior, no protector. Then they climb sword-trees, enter cauldrons of boiling water, endure the courts of freezing ice, iron pillars, and copper statues, suffering every torment until they lose all human form. At such times, their suffering is impermanent.
Therefore, I say: all must seize the moment to plant the field of merit.
What is meant by seizing the moment?
As with vegetables, one must eat them while young; when old age comes, the time has passed, and eating becomes difficult.
Maintaining long fasts, reciting scriptures, burning incense, bowing in worship, constantly drawing near to places of the Dao, listening to the Dharma, repenting, offering food and wealth—such practices must be done in a timely manner. Once the time has passed, they are as useless as mulberry leaves in winter.
Good sons should reflect thus: if worldly people cannot eat vegetables, how can they maintain long fasts? If they cannot maintain long fasts, how can they abstain from grains? If they cannot abstain from grains, how can they learn immortality? If they cannot learn immortality, how can they learn the Dao? If they cannot learn the Dao, how can they attain the Dao? If they cannot attain the Dao, how can they escape suffering?
For these reasons, those who maintain fasts, abstain from grains, seek immortality, and learn the Dao should be supported.
Why? Such learners of the Dao are called "seizing the moment," and those who support them are also called "seizing the moment."
Like one who plants grain in spring and looks forward to harvest in autumn—this is called seizing the moment. Not planting means no harvest—this is called missing the moment.
All evil should be severed with wisdom; all good should be cultivated with wisdom. Planting seeds for future lives is called seizing the moment; having no connection to future lives is called missing the moment.

Moreover, in this present world, wealth, joy, and long life are called "seizing the moment," while poverty, hardship, and early death are all called "missing the moment." I observe that among worldly people, those who seize the moment are few, while those who miss it are many.

Furthermore, the Universal Compassion says: If one, with a heart of kindness, gives away family wealth, even the clothes on one’s body, to Daoist practitioners, copies scriptures, commissions images, and together establishes good roots, the merit of such people cannot be measured. In the future, they will surely sit upon lotus thrones, with abundant clothing and food, and draw near to my person. Why? Giving wealth to copy scriptures opens the ears and eyes of all beings; it builds great Dharma bridges for all beings. Know that such a person will reap great karmic reward.

Therefore, men and women who seek long life and future blessings should give their wealth to pure Daoist practitioners to copy the treasury of scriptures—this is also called "seizing the moment." Without this intention, it is called "missing the moment."

Good man, if one, with a heart of kindness, can offer the clothes from one’s body for the sake of both parents while they are alive, and for their memory after they have passed, in places where the Dharma is taught, such a person, in this present life, will inspire filial piety in all men and women. Why? If a father is unfilial, his children will surely be unfeeling. Like a forest of thorns, filled with many harmful trees, for this reason, know that one who offers the clothes from one’s body for the sake of parents will bear children like a grove of sandalwood, filled with fragrant trees, and will not resemble a poisonous thicket of thorns. Such a person is also called "seizing the moment."

Good man, if there are those who commit the five grave offenses, are unfilial, provide for their wives and children but disrespect their parents, indulge in wine and recklessness, and beat, scold, or curse others, the sins of such people exceed those of all beings suffering in the eighteen hells. Only when the eighteen hells are emptied will their sins be exhausted; as long as the eighteen hells remain, their suffering will continue. Such beings are called "missing the moment."

Good man, if one, with compassion, sees others making offerings and feels joy, vigor, and diligence, seeking the causes and fruits of goodness, and offers the clothes from one’s body for the sake of parents, the merit gained will be twice that of the former person’s goodness. Such a person is called "seizing the moment." But if one lacks compassion, sees others making offerings, and feels envy or scorn, without joy, such a person will gain no karmic reward and instead incur great sin, falling into the three evil destinies after death, becoming a hungry ghost to repay the karma of past-life jealousy toward others’ good deeds. This is also called "missing the moment."

Good man, those who seek earthly immortals cultivate the causes of earthly immortals; those who seek flying immortals cultivate the causes of flying immortals; those who seek freedom cultivate the causes of freedom; those who seek the untainted cultivate the causes of the untainted; those who seek the unconditioned cultivate the causes of the unconditioned. Formerly, in the Treasure Assembly Kingdom, I expounded these causes to Haikong Zhizang. Upon hearing this, Haikong swiftly attained the unconditioned—this was called "seizing the moment." Without this intention, it is called "missing the moment."

Suppose there is one who, in a place where the Dharma is taught, falls into much drowsiness and thinks to themselves, "I always reproach myself: why, when sitting in the Dao’s seat, do I fall into so much drowsiness? Sitting here now brings no benefit or merit." In such a person, laziness arises. I observe that in all mundane realms, whether human or non-human, within the five viscera and every limb, there are true spirits, all capable of upholding the wondrous Dharma for beings. In future lives, they will surely become wise. You men and women should know this: it is better to sit drowsily in the Dao’s seat than to return home and idle about. This is called "seizing the moment," while the lazy one is called "missing the moment."

Good men, if you think thus: If there are worldly people who, for the sake of the deceased, carry wealth, coins, and various precious items to a place where the Dharma is taught, announce it to the assembly, and offer it to the Three Treasures, wishing to repent the sins of the deceased, then the intentions of such people—whether for father, mother, or departed relatives—will surely bring liberation. Why? Repentance and almsgiving are called "ransoming sins." The more wealth given, the greater the merit; the less given, the lighter the merit, following the deceased’s former wealth or poverty. To generate this intention is called "seizing the moment"; without it, it is not called "seizing the moment."

If there is one who deeply understands the wondrous Dharma and expounds it to others, enabling them to receive and uphold it, the merit of such a person fills the expanse of empty space and cannot be measured. If there is one who listens to the wondrous Dharma and can also praise it, remembering even a line or verse from the scriptures and transmitting it to others, this is called "seeing the Dharma" and "practicing the Dharma." The merit of such a person is equal to that of the Dharma teacher, with no difference.

If there is one who listens to the wondrous Dharma, remembers three, four, or five sentences, and later joins others in coming to the Dao’s seat to repent sins and cultivate the field of blessings, such a person is a good spiritual friend, a bridge of the Dharma. At the end of their life, they will not fall into hell. I command the Realized Ones who save beings from suffering in this world to welcome such a person and directly ascend to the Pure Land. Such examples are called "seizing the moment"; without this intention, it is not called "seizing the moment."

If there is one who carries pearls, jade, gold, silver, and other treasures, fine silks, brocades, coins, cloth, incense, and oil to the Dao’s seat, the place where the Dharma is taught, and before thousands of beings, bears witness to their merit, seeking repentance and confessing their sins, the full karmic reward of such a person surpasses that of leaving wealth to others after death.

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke this verse:

With a single thought, observe the body—all is emptiness and falsehood;
The four elements and five aggregates are fundamentally not real.
Three hundred sixty shattered joints and bones,
Skin and flesh conjoin to form a body of pus and blood.
Thought after thought, impermanence never abides;
Morning and evening, afflictions disturb the heart and spirit.
Parents, wife, and children are but temporary lodgers;
Brothers and sisters are bonds of a fleeting time.
Once the breath ceases, one departs in emptiness,
A hundred bones decay and all turn to dust.
Though sons and daughters weep at the head of the bed,
None can save or deliver from sinking into perdition.
Each must diligently cultivate goodness today—
Beware of leaving wealth to those who come after.

Having spoken this verse, the great assembly,
Awakened to the suffering of impermanence, found no refuge,
And wept bitterly for all beings. Again they asked the Heavenly Worthy:
"Within the Three Realms, is there anything that endures?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "There is not. O Universal Compassion,
Whence have you come that you do not understand this truth?
Long ago, in the Hall of Concordant Dawn, I entrusted these words:
The Three Clarities and all sages are thought after thought impermanent.
Thus, in this world, nothing can be preserved.
Good son, the Five Turbidities surge with restless strife—
The world is impermanent. Now, clinging so deeply,
I speak for the sake of awakening the world,
That all beings may escape the bounds of suffering."

At that moment, the Perfected One of Mystic Unity within the assembly
Exclaimed in response: "Excellent, Heavenly Worthy,
That you have spoken this verse! In the ages to come,
All shall bathe in this grace. We, here and now,
Shall transcribe and uphold it, never daring to treat it lightly."

The Heavenly Worthy further declared: "Perfected One of Mystic Unity,
You and the great assembly—long ago, in past kalpas,
I appeared in the world for the sake of beings,
Expounding the Dharma in manifold forms.
As the teaching neared its end, I returned to wondrous bliss.
Countless devas and humans came to hear the final discourse;
Countless beings came to cultivate the final goodness;
Countless rākṣasas came to plant the final cause;
Countless ghosts and spirits came to partake of the final blessing;
Countless men and women came to make the final offering;
Countless men and women came to practice the final generosity.
At that time, I bestowed predictions upon them—why?
Those who make the final offering are called the final field of merit.
Thus, men and women who seek cause and effect
Should cultivate the final goodness within the Dao’s seat,
To form the final bond—let there be no doubt."

Then, the Hall of True Multitudes, the entire great assembly—
Both humans and non-humans—hearing this wondrous teaching,
Purified their minds in unison and realized the fruit of non-action.

*Thus concludes the* **Highest Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Great Mystery Universal Compassion Exhortation to the World Sutra.**
