**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Perfected-One’s Admonitory Dharma-Wheel Wondrous Sutra**

The Supreme High Mystery Great Ultimate Three Officials Dharma Master, Perfected-One of Mysterious Oneness, expounds *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Perfected-One’s Admonitory Dharma-Wheel Wondrous Sutra*. The ancient text was concealed within the Supreme Six Harmonies Mysterious Terrace. The scripture’s custodians were the Dragon-Flower Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Jade Lads, who scattered flowers and burned incense, guarding the numinous writ. According to the statutes, it was transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. By the Supreme’s decree, it was entrusted to the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate.

The Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate, in seclusion on Mount Tiantai, purified his sins, burned incense, and repented, yearning for the Real and contemplating the Dao. For a hundred days, spirits manifested in wondrous forms—now appearing, now vanishing in the void above, their radiance shimmering like clouds, sometimes dispersing, sometimes gathering, casting shifting reflections upon the hall of purification. The Immortal Duke, sensing his suffering had deeply moved the celestial perfected, devoted himself to profound study, his resolve unwavering. Before a year of purification had passed, he succeeded in invoking the descent of the exalted sages. Gazing into the secluded chamber, on the night of the *gengyin* day of the first month of the Yuan Zheng era, suddenly a flying cloud from the cinnabar empyrean arrived—a jade chariot of the Eight Luminaries, its jeweled canopy ablaze, its splendor suffusing the Great Void. Incense burned, flowers scattered, drifting through the air. A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders—celestial perfected blazed with brilliance beyond description. Dragons soared, simurghs sang; phoenixes danced in flight; lions and white cranes roared and chanted in harmony. Jade lads and maidens, numbering in the tens of millions, each bore the staffs of life and demon-subduing, ten-stranded flower banners, and carriages yoked with scaled steeds. Their numinous chariots, lush and resplendent, descended all at once.

The first announced himself as the Supreme Perfected-One of Mysterious Oneness, First Perfected Yu Luoqiao; the second as the Supreme Perfected-One of Mysterious Oneness, Second Perfected Guang Miaoyin; the third as the Supreme Perfected-One of Mysterious Oneness, Third Perfected Zhen Dingguang. The Three Perfected gathered, each crowned with a halo illuminating the ten directions. All sat upon golden lotus brocade seats, attended by officials bearing flower banners, burning rare incense, and holding aloft tables of azure-green jade draped with eight-colored silks. They summoned *The Perfected-One’s Admonitory Dharma-Wheel Wondrous Sutra*, its flying script enshrined in a brocade canopy, adorned with seven-jeweled tassels, the numinous writ resplendent in the boundless void.

Thereupon, the Immortal Duke prostrated himself in reverence. Overwhelmed by the sublime majesty of the Celestial Worthy, he dared not speak, his heart filled with joy, his spirit elated. He bowed to receive the admonitions.

The Supreme Perfected-One of Mysterious Oneness, Yu Luoqiao, addressed the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate, saying: "Through kalpas of cultivation, you have worn down your body to save beings, delivering the living and bestowing blessings even upon grasses and trees. Dwelling in forests and hills, you have guarded your essence and endured hardship, revered your teachers and upheld the Dao without weariness. Your苦志 was steadfast and resolute, and thus you attained utmost virtue. Your merit shines upon the Purple Orchid Terrace and the Golden Gates of the Upper Clarity Palace, where jade texts inscribed in purple characters record your towering deeds, aligning you with the ranks of the highest immortals. The Supreme has commanded the Perfected-One of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, to safeguard you as a Great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns. Now, I am further commanded to serve as your first master of deliverance. Sit once more, and I shall impart to you the essential secrets of the Dharma-Wheel’s admonitions, revealing your past lives, the sins and blessings of your former selves, and the karmic retribution you now endure. Thus shall I expound. Do you wish to hear these teachings? If you can uphold them, then listen in stillness."

The Perfected-One of Supreme Mystery and Primordial Unity, Radiant Wondrous Sound, Second Immortal, addressed the Venerable Lord of the Left: "Through the turning wheel of birth and death, you have forged karmic bonds with goodness, accumulating merit across kalpas, life after life without cease. Forsaking glory and renouncing rank, you entrusted your body to secluded groves, enduring hunger and cold, your face gaunt with privation. Yet you never spoke of the Dao, revering the treasure of your masters as though standing before the gods. Your heart was gentle and yielding, your bearing joyful whether seated or rising. You maintained unbroken fasts and ceaseless contemplation, your refined essence piercing the distant heavens—thus your name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity.

The Supreme has commanded me to serve as your second master of deliverance. I shall fully reveal to you the essential admonitions of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the roots of birth and death, that you may know the agony of your hun-soul and spirit, and whence it arises. Do you wish to hear these teachings? I shall expound them to you; you must uphold them."

The Perfected-One of Supreme Mystery and Primordial Unity, True Radiance of Authentic Stability, Third Immortal, addressed the Venerable Lord of the Left: "Across seven lifetimes, you have shown compassion, cutting flesh from your own mouth to save the destitute, extending benevolence even to birds and beasts, so that blessings flowed to your descendants and grace bathed your person. Moreover, you accumulated diligence, personally serving the treasure of your masters. In cold, you did not long for furs; in hunger, you did not indulge your palate. Amidst hardship in mountain forests, your devoted heart never wavered. The Purple Treasury embraced your true nature, and a wondrous light arose from your nape. Thus the Most High descended in hidden response, bestowing upon you the rank of Immortal Minister to requite your past virtue—how towering indeed!

The Supreme now commands me to serve as your third master of deliverance. I shall impart to you the essential admonitions of boundless wondrous penetration, the turning of the spirit, and entry into samādhi. Do you wish to follow these teachings? I shall expound them; you must cultivate them in silence."

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One said: When Heaven and Earth were established, the Primordial Beginning divided and distinguished them; yin and yang unfolded and transformed, and the Five Phases took their places. Without above or below, without Heaven or Earth, without great or small, within the colorless and beyond the formless—all receive the empty and cavernous, taking qi as their origin. The origin arises from the beginning, the beginning from the primordial, the primordial from the mysterious; from these three, the myriad things are born. None fails to inherit this sequence, the warp and weft extending to the eight directions, ensuring the enduring existence of Heaven and Earth.

All Perfected Ones and lofty immortals, the Realized Ones who have attained the Dao from the ten directions and the boundless worlds as numerous as motes of dust—none, even from kalpas beyond count, has lacked a master. All have received the precious scriptures of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity from their masters, thereby becoming lofty immortals, supreme sages, and guides of the ten directions. The master is a treasure. Without a master, the Dao cannot be accomplished; without a master, it cannot proceed; without a master, one cannot be born anew; without a master, one cannot be delivered; without a master, one cannot become an immortal. Thus, the master is my father. If you do not cherish your master, the Dao will not descend; demons will corrupt your person, and how then may you ride the eight-scene dragon chariot or ascend the Jade Palace of the Great Ultimate?

Even in the teachings of the Ru, there are the Three Tombs and Five Classics, the Eight Cords and Nine Mounds—all instructing scholars through the guidance of masters, who in turn rely on their teachers to attain understanding. How much more so for you, who now study the Dao of Highest Clarity, aspiring to ascend and soar, to eternally enjoy boundless blessings? To slight your master while practicing the Dao is to seek the flight of the flesh—like casting a night-shining pearl away, losing all you once possessed.

Yet you have accumulated diligence across kalpas, tirelessly turning and striving. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, your name in vermilion script and purple characters will be inscribed upon the Mysterious Terrace, and you will ascend to the office of Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate. But with your three masters not yet complete and your admonitions not yet fulfilled, you cannot yet ascend to the palace of the Great Ultimate. The Most High, considering your past merits weighty and profound, has commanded us to serve as your three masters of deliverance, to transmit to you the essential admonitions and perfect your Dao. Thus may you swiftly ascend beyond the Three Realms, roam in Highest Clarity, arrive at the Golden Palace, and receive the title of Immortal Duke.

The Immortal Duke bowed repeatedly, prostrating himself to receive the teachings, saying: "I only wish the Heavenly Worthy will take pity and compassion upon me. Now, pray expound these teachings, that I may immediately receive and practice them."

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One said: *The Wondrous Scripture of the Wheel of Admonitions of the Most High True Unity*, a decree of the Nine Heavens, emerges but once every forty thousand kalpas. The Most High Void Sovereign formerly transmitted it to the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Lord of the Great Dao transmitted it to the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity; the Heavenly Emperor transmitted it to the Later Sage Lord Emperor of the Golden Palace. Now it is bestowed upon Immortal Dukes, Immortal Lords, and Immortal Kings who have already attained perfection—it is not transmitted to middling immortals or the various immortals of the Five Peaks.

Since the Nameless and Mysterious Imperial Chart records the characters of the Three Clarities and the Jade Script of the Great Ultimate, only those of the quality of Immortal Duke may partake in its hearing. This scripture is lofty and wondrous, held in the highest esteem by the Most High. It is concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Six Directions, where immortal youths and maidens eternally treasure and secretly attend its truth. Merely glimpsing its chapters and verses brings blessings to seven generations of ancestors, causing the souls of the deceased to ascend to Heaven, bestowing fortune upon the entire clan, and ensuring the prosperity and flourishing of the household, with generations producing the worthy and enlightened. Cultivating it leads to cloud chariots and dragon carriages, enabling flight in broad daylight. To lightly divulge or slight it, to slander or defame its sacred text, invites punishment upon your person. The retribution of sin and blessing is clear—guard against this with utmost care.

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One addressed the Immortal Duke, saying: "Formerly, I received *The Wondrous Scripture of the Wheel of Admonitions of the True Unity of the Most High Limitless Great Dao* from the Lord of the Great Dao. In my practice and service to my master, I burned incense six times daily, performed morning and circumambulatory rites, always first paying homage to my master, visualizing him with mind and gaze, seeing my master as I saw the scripture. Without my master, I could not see the scripture. Once I beheld the scripture, my master stood before me. I endured hunger and thirst, following my master east and west. I received my master’s instructions, diligently and thoroughly studying the scripture, suffering as if cut by knives or pierced by poisoned awls. I served with reverence, never daring to falter, enduring pain without complaint, bearing poison without utterance. Thus, over four hundred million years, the true Dao was accomplished, and I ascended to the rank of Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One. Now, by my master’s command, I serve as your third master of deliverance. Can you be as I was? If you can be as I was, I shall expound the scripture to you."

The Immortal Duke bowed his head in reverence and gratitude, addressing the Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One, his third master of deliverance: "This disciple is fortunate to gaze upon the celestial countenance, to receive your teachings and further be instructed in essential words—how could my boundless gratitude be expressed in mere words? Reflecting upon my karmic endowments, I was born into the Dharma gate, from youth cherishing the supreme Dao, aspiring to transcendence. I maintained long fasts in secluded peaks, my thoughts fixed upon the lofty sages. Unaware that the Heavenly Worthy had already glanced into the hidden valleys, bestowing the true Dao, I consider myself dim and unworthy. Yet, looking forward, I pledge my heart to the Three Luminaries, personally upholding my master’s instructions without fail. Across ten thousand kalpas, my resolve shall not waver. I revere and follow the Dharma teachings, obeying only my master. I forever wish for your compassion, to awaken what I have not yet understood, to reveal profound teachings, to expound the Dharma and admonitions, that I may be uplifted and redeemed. I prostrate myself to receive your command, vowing to uphold it."
