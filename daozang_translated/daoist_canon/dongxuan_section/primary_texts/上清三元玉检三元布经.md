**The Supreme Clarity Three Primordials Jade-Inscribed Three Primordials Scripture**

The *Highest Three Primordials Scripture* is a celestial writ of the Supreme Clarity Three Heavens, a jade-inscribed flying epistle of the Highest Perfected Ones, comprising the *Upper Primordial Jade-Inscribed Celestial Great Register*, the *Lower Primordial Jade-Inscribed Earthly Jade Texts*, and the *Middle Primordial Jade-Inscribed Perfected Immortals’ Writ*. These treasured scrolls, all inscribed with the writings of the Golden Elixir, are encased in a natural cloud-brocade pouch, sealed with the seals of the Three Primordials’ sacred spirits, and concealed within the Palace of Great Abundance in the Nine Heavens, the Nine-Bend Elixir Chamber of the Golden Terrace and Jade Hall. The Upper Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen presides over them, attended by seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Primordial Vermilion Palace, while three hundred Jade Lads of Numinous Emptiness hold towels and scatter incense under the guardianship of the Perfected Ones of the Heart of the Most High.

In the first year of the Qingxu era, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning descended to the Hall of Bright Mist and the Cloud Chamber of the Great Empyrean to teach, transmitting it to the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens, commanding them to govern the Three Ways and oversee all immortals. According to the statutes of the Highest Perfected Ones, only after seven thousand years of transmission may one who has attained Perfected Immortal status receive it. Without the engraving of the mysterious charts and records from before birth, none may rashly unfold these numinous writings. The Highest Ones employ the divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs to assist the Highest Perfected Ones in inspecting negligence, enforcing prohibitions with utmost severity.

The Most High Great Dao Lord received it from the Master of Primordial Antiquity, who transmitted it to the Perfected King of the Dark Capital. The Queen Mother of the West received it from the King of the Nine Heavens and transmitted it to the Great Thearch of Fusang. The Great Thearch transmitted it to the Later Sage Emperor of the Golden Gates, who in turn transmitted it to the Azure Lad of the Highest Minister. Today, one copy is preserved in the Eastern Florescence Palace, to be transmitted every seven thousand years in accordance with the statutes to those who attain Perfected Immortal status.

The Most High Dao Lord commanded the Five Elders and the Talismans of the Four Poles and Five Thearchs of the Perfected Capital to guard and protect the numinous writings, inspecting against leaks. Those who recklessly disclose its contents shall be punished with the Wind Blade; those who transmit it carelessly or neglect its teachings shall incur the burden of seven generations of ancestors and suffer personal retribution, enduring eternal servitude under the ghostly officials.

**The Three Primordials’ Writ states:**
The jade-inscribed texts emerged before the Nine Mysteries of the Empty Grotto, formed from the coagulation of natural qi into jade writings. The Nine Heavens divided and manifested them, the Three Ways unfolded their clarity, and the Three Primordials distributed their qi to inspect and govern the Three Perfected Ones. Without these texts, the Three Luminaries would dim, the Five Thearchs would misalign, the Nine Revolutions would overturn, and the Seven Celestial Bodies would scatter their essence. Without them, the earth would see the Nine Lands sink into abysses, the Five Peaks collapse, and mountains and rivers overturn. Without them, the learner would find no descent of immortal officials, no administration of earthly bureaus, no inscription of mysterious names in the Nine Heavens above—vain would be their studies, and the Dao would remain unattainable. Its methods are lofty and wondrous; the Three Primordials’ secret scrolls bestow upon those who obtain them the rank of Immortal Ministers.

The *Upper Primordial Jade-Inscribed Celestial Great Register* inspects the celestial great records, comprising the true writings of the Nine Heavens’ distributed qi and mysterious charts, as well as the titles and governance of the celestial perfected ones. Those who possess its texts may roam the Nine Heavens above, their lifespan equaling the kalpas. Those who behold its scrolls shall have their names inscribed in the Nine Heavens, their lives revolving through the palaces of rebirth, transforming into immortals. By diligently cultivating its practices for nine years, one may welcome the Sage Lord in the Palace of Supreme Clarity.

The *Lower Primordial Jade-Inscribed Earthly Jade Texts* inspect the numinous writings of the Nine Heavens’ distributed qi, governing the spirits of the Nine Earths. Those who obtain its texts may soar through the Great Void, where the Nine Yin shall not seize their souls; they may traverse the Five Peaks, tread the sources of rivers, and all spirits shall bow in reverence, myriad deities shall welcome them. Those who behold its scrolls shall ascend to the Nine Heavens, their lives revolving through transformations to become immortals. By cultivating its Dao for nine years, one may enter water without sinking, enter fire without burning, and with the descent of the Three Primordials, ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The *Middle Primordial Jade-Inscribed Perfected Immortals’ Writ* comprises the hidden writings of the Nine Heavens and the decrees of immortal command. Those who possess its texts shall have immortal officials attend their courts and receive the descent of divine mushrooms and natural numinous medicines. By cultivating its Dao for nine years, celestial immortals shall descend in truth, earthly immortals shall manifest their numinosity, and flying immortals shall descend in their chariots, soaring through the void to ascend to the Jade Clarity. Those who behold its scrolls shall have their names inscribed in the Nine Heavens, their lives revolving through the palaces of rebirth, transforming into immortals.

**The Three Primordials’ Writ states:**
Without the jade-inscribed texts, the numinous officials of the Nine Lands shall not come to pay respects, the spirits governing mountains and seas shall not protect one’s form, and the celestial, earthly, and flying immortals of the Five Peaks shall not descend in cloud chariots, nor shall one’s mysterious name be recorded in the Nine Heavens above. Without reciting the jade chapters, heaven shall not descend its perfected ones, myriad demons shall invade one’s radiance, and those who seek flight shall instead sink. Those who wear the jade-inscribed texts shall see the Three Primordials revolve in unison, moving through emptiness and entering the void without hindrance, treading water and stepping through fire, soaring through the Nine Mysteries. Their bodies shall penetrate the Purple Void, their spirits shall reflect golden countenances, the seventy-two marks shall gleam brilliantly in the Great Void, and they shall govern the Three Heavens, presiding over all immortals. Thus, unless one has already attained Perfected Immortal status, none may transmit it lightly.

**The Upper Primordial Jade-Inscribed Celestial Great Register**

The *Supreme Clarity Jade Radiance Elixir Numinous Grotto-Heaven Upper Primordial Three Primordials Jade-Inscribed Text* is transmitted to the Perfected Ones of Supreme Clarity, who wear it to roam the myriad heavens, inspect and govern the Great Void, and command all perfected ones. Those who wear this text shall hold rank equal to the Numinous Immortals, receiving the reverence and protection of all heavens, the welcoming administration of the Five Thearchs. After nine years, they shall behold the Three Primordial Lords and be escorted to the Palace of Supreme Clarity.

To receive this text, one must fast for nine days, inscribe it with a green brush upon nine feet of yellow silk, and offer it in sacrifice at the mountain of one’s life destiny before wearing it. If after nine years one has not ascended, one must sacrifice again, casting the text into the azure mist of the empyrean, whereupon one shall receive a five-colored cloud chariot from the Jade Radiance Palace of Supreme Clarity to welcome the recipient’s body.

In the first year of the Qingxu era, the year *gengyin*, on the ninth day of the ninth month, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, in the cyclical sign of *shangjia zhichen*, fasted in the Palace of Supreme Clarity and swore a covenant before the Unsurpassed, Unbounded, Colorless, Shadowless, Formless, Nameless, Ancestorless, Clanless, Limitless, Empty Clarity, and the Nine Mysteries of the Natural Kalpas Beyond Count. The Dao transmitted the *Three Primordials Jade-Inscribed Text* to the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens, commanding them to bestow it upon later learners whose mysterious names destined them to become Perfected Ones of Supreme Clarity. Their names were fixed upon the cinnabar terrace, in the golden repository of jade tablets, upon purple writings of jade slips. They were to welcome the Sage Lord, soaring to the Palace of Supreme Clarity, gazing upon the celestial titles of the natural bureaus of Supreme Clarity’s Empty Clarity, attending the Highest Perfected Ones, inspecting the heavens to summon immortals, restraining demons and commanding spirits, descending cloud chariots to welcome the body of so-and-so, all in accordance with the covenant writings of the Highest Perfected Ones of the Nine Heavens.

The *Upper Prime Heaven-Inspecting Great Register* is inscribed in blue-green ink upon nine-foot yellow silk and worn upon the body. The inscription must be taken to one’s life-destined Marchmount, where the Celestial Perfected are sacrificed to, the Nine Mysteries are invoked, and the Five Spirits are sworn to, before it is worn. If after nine years the Dao has not descended, two copies should be transcribed, and following the proper rites, one ascends the Marchmount to sacrifice anew to Heaven. Upon completion, one copy is burned, its ashes scattered into the azure mist of the skies, while the other is buried nine feet deep in one’s life-destined Marchmount. This is called: "Above, reporting to the Nine Heavens; below, reporting to the Five Marchmounts and numinous mountains; in the midst, reporting to the myriad spirits," thereby securing eternal life.

The *Lower Prime Earth-Inspecting Jade Register*
The *Three Primes Mysterious Terrace Jade Registers in Purple Script* are also called the *Nine Heavens Perfected Writ: Primordial Earth-Inspecting Register*, the *Three Primes Tiger Script*, and the *Flying Heavenly Perfected*. They are used to report to the essence of the Six Heavens and the myriad spirits, to regulate mountains and rivers, and to inspect the numina of the Nine Lands. Wearing this text commands the service of nine thousand Jade Maidens, and in the era of Great Peace, one may welcome the Sagely Lord at the Upper Clarity Palace. The recipient inscribes it in yellow ink upon blue-green silk and, after sacrificing at their life-destined Marchmount, wears it upon the body. If after nine years one has not ascended to Heaven, another copy should be transcribed and burned, its ashes scattered into the azure mist of the skies; yet another copy should be buried three feet deep in one’s life-destined Marchmount. Wearing this text, one may wander the Eight Directions, traverse the Five Marchmounts, and tread the sources of rivers; regulate the spirits of the earth, command the myriad spirits, and after nine years, ride the carriage of the Three Primes to ascend to the palace of the Three Primes. One must not rashly enter defiled or polluted places, nor offend the Celestial Perfected, nor lightly proclaim or reveal its secrets, lest one’s seven ancestors be held accountable, and one’s own body perish, losing the way to immortality.

The *Middle Prime Register of the Perfected Immortals*
The *Register of the Perfected Immortals* is also called the *Three Primes Chapter of the Great Perfected Yin-Yang Numinous Record*, a hidden script of the Three Heavens and Nine Spirits of the Upper Mystery. When Heaven and Earth reach the great reckoning of their kalpas—after eight thousand kalpas—this text appears once upon the Three Primes Mysterious Terrace, its true tally bestowed upon three hundred persons, with ninety-one Jade Maidens. Those who wear it find all the spirits of their form naturally ennobled as Jade Immortals. Without this text, the form and spirit cannot transform, and the sullied soul wanders aimlessly; aimless wandering leads the spirit to consort with evil, and consorting with evil brings the time of dissolution. Without the transformation of form and spirit, one cannot summon the immortal officials, command the Upper Perfected, or recite the Jade Chapters ten thousand times. The ten thousand recitations of the Jade Chapters contain the hidden names of the myriad spirits of the Nine Heavens’ Great Perfected; reciting them startles the Nine Heavens into heeding, and the myriad immortals into girding their sashes. Without the *Register of the Perfected Immortals*, to lightly command immortal officials and shake the Nine Heavens is to invite no descent of immortals, no celestial acceptance of one’s voice, the scattering of one’s hun-soul and po-soul, the flight of one’s spirit and the dispersal of one’s qi, the collapse of one’s palaces and the disturbance of one’s offspring, the birth of heavenly demons and calamities, and the dissolution of one’s body. Those who study this text find themselves spontaneously immortalized; when the era of Great Peace arrives, they may welcome the Sagely Lord at the Upper Clarity Palace. Without the *Mysterious Chart of the Imperial Writs* or the *Red Script of Inscribed Talismans*, one must not rashly proclaim the treasured texts, lest one’s seven ancestors be held accountable, one’s self be eternally confined to the offices of the dead, and one’s own life be forfeit, never again attaining immortality.

The *Profound and Supreme Perfected Three Primes Register of the Immortal Qi and Nine Spirits’ Hidden Script* is the text of the Western Sand Square Terrace. Bestowed by the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen, it is the *Yellow Upper Perfected Assistant to the Heavenly Primordial Register of the Immortal Soul*. Those who wear this text ascend to fill the offices of immortals, and after a hundred days of meditating upon the spirits within their chambers, may behold the Lord of the Upper Prime, who will bestow upon them the true writ, enabling them to naturally fly to the Upper Clarity Palace. Without this text, one cannot practice the immortal way or summon the Perfected, and one’s body will suffer calamity.

The *Primordial Upper Birth of the Perfected Register of the Immortal Qi Three Primes Great Proclamation in Purple Script* is the hidden text of the Three Primes Terrace. Wearing it and entering one’s chamber to contemplate the Perfected for ninety days, one’s defiled qi will naturally dissipate, and one may behold the Great Lord of the Three Primes, who will bestow the true writ, enabling one to fly through the void after nine years. Without this text, one cannot practice the immortal way or summon the immortal officials, and one’s body will suffer calamity.

The *Highest Supreme Birth of the Perfected Writ: Register of the Immortal Qi and Purple Tenuity Mysterious Palace Flying Heavenly Perfected Script* appears in the chambers of the Five Marchmounts when the great kalpa of Heaven and Earth comes full cycle. Those who wear it and enter their chambers to contemplate the Three Primes for a hundred days, their essence and thought unwavering, may behold the true spirits descending to their form, enabling them to command immortal officials and obtain natural things. Beware the mire of life and death. Without this text, one cannot practice the immortal way, and to lightly summon the Celestial Perfected is to lose one’s body and fail to attain immortality.

The Perfected of the Various Heavens are forbidden to recite the *Nine Heavens’ Upper Writ*; those who do not bear this text shall be punished by the *Nine Heavens’ Piercing the Wicked*. Those who bear this text may have the *Nine Heavens’ Chancellor* summon and inspect the *Celestial Prime* to command the immortal officials. After a year of concentrated contemplation, they may behold the *Nine Heavens’ Perfected King*, who may appear as a single being with nine heads, riding a nine-colored phoenix and descending to their form. Upon seeing him, do not fear, for this *Nine Heavens’ Perfected King* presides over the registration of the highest Perfected. Simply prostrate facing south and petition for immortality, and you shall naturally receive the *Nine Heavens’ Writ*. This text must not be lightly recited alongside the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*; those who violate this shall have their nine generations consigned to torment, and their body shall be punished by the *Nine Heavens’ Piercing the Wicked*, their life extinguished within a hundred days.

The *Highest Mysterious Jade Register of the Three Primes* is inscribed within the Northern Chamber of the Numinous Capital, its celestial writ in jade characters, each a pace in length, accompanied by seven hundred *straight talismans* and eighty-two jade maidens. Those who bear this text and contemplate with focused essence for a hundred days shall have the Three Primes descend to their chamber, naturally attaining knowledge of the sounds of Heaven. Without this text, one must not recklessly practice the *Way of Flying Immortality*, lest their body suffer calamity, their seven generations be held accountable, and their immortal rank be lost.

The *Purple Tenuity Mysterious Palace Flying Heavenly Register* is inscribed upon the *Platform of Dawn’s Ascent*, illuminating the *Highest Clarity Upper Palace* above the Nine Heavens. The *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning* transmitted it to the *Queen Mother of the West* to summon the immortal officials of the Five Marchmounts and the numinous immortals of mountains and seas. With a focused and tranquil mind, after a hundred days of contemplation, the spirits shall appear, and one shall naturally know their hidden name within the Nine Heavens. Those who bear it may summon immortal officials. Without this text, one must not recite the *Upper Scripture of Dispelling Demons*, lest their body suffer great calamity—beware, beware.

The *Mysterious Upper Flying Heavenly Middle Writ Register of Immortals* is inscribed upon the *Platform of the Three Primes*, issued by the *Venerable Lord of Myriad Beginnings* to transmit to the highest adepts for summoning immortals and attaining the Perfected. The recipient must sacrifice to the Five Marchmounts and contemplate with focused essence for a hundred days, whereupon a three-headed deity shall descend to their chamber. Without this text, one must not recklessly seek immortality on the eight seasonal days, lest their body suffer calamity. Those who bear it shall attain communion with the divine Perfected, granted twelve jade lads to transmit their recitations, which shall ascend to the Nine Heavens. Those who lightly divulge it shall have their seven generations consigned to servitude, and the *Five Marchmounts’ Talismanic Demon-Spirits* shall be commanded to torment their guilty souls.

The *Nine Heavens’ Dragon Writ of the Three Primes’ Empty Cavern Jade Register Flying Mysterious Text* is inscribed upon the gates of the *Three Passes of the Nine Heavens*, governing the prohibition of the Perfected of the Various Heavens. Those who recite the *Nine Heavens’ Upper Writ* without possessing this text shall be punished by the *Nine Heavens’ Piercing the Wicked*. Those who bear this text may have the *Nine Heavens’ Chancellor* summon and inspect the *Celestial Prime* to command the immortal officials. After a year of concentrated contemplation, they may behold the *Nine Heavens’ Perfected King*, who may appear as a single being with nine heads, riding a nine-colored phoenix and descending to their form. Upon seeing him, do not fear, for this *Nine Heavens’ Perfected King* presides over the registration of the highest Perfected. Simply prostrate facing south and petition for immortality, and you shall naturally receive the *Nine Heavens’ Writ*. Without this text, one must not lightly recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*; those who violate this shall have their nine generations consigned to torment, and their body shall be punished by the *Nine Heavens’ Piercing the Wicked*, their life extinguished within a hundred days.

The *Primordial Beginning Mysterious Empty Flying Heavenly Middle Writ Three Primes Jade Register* was inscribed by the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning* upon the *Golden Ramparts Platform*, transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas. Those who behold this text shall have their name inscribed in the *Eastern Florescence*. Those who bear it and contemplate with focused essence for three hundred days, their gaze unturned and their mind free of stray thoughts, shall behold the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*. Upon seeing the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*, they shall attain a lifespan of ten thousand years. Without this text, one must not enter the named mountains, traverse the Five Marchmounts, or practice the *Way of Flying Immortality*. If the Five Marchmounts do not accept them, the demonic forces of humans and heavens shall assail their body, and they shall surely suffer great calamity.

The *Grand Perfected Golden Writ of the Nine Heavens’ Upper Empty Cavern Hidden Text* was inscribed by the *Nine Heavens’ Father and Mother* upon the *Phoenix-Born Platform*, accompanied by eight hundred *straight talismans*. Once every nine thousand years, the Nine Heavens open, and when they do, nine suns shine together in the east, and this text naturally illuminates those who have attained the Dao, upon the southern terrace. If one’s name is recorded in the *Mysterious Register of the Celestial Emperor*, the Four Perfected shall also descend to bestow it upon their form. Those who possess this text and contemplate with focused essence for nine hundred days, stabilizing their spirit, shall behold the *Nine Heavens’ Father and Mother*. Upon seeing the *Nine Heavens’ Father and Mother*, they shall no longer face the fate of death and dissolution. Without this text, those who recklessly practice the *Way of Ten Thousand Cycles* and summon the immortal Perfected shall surely suffer calamity, their seven generations consigned to servitude, and they shall never again attain immortality.

On this day, month, and year, the Perfected of [a certain] Marchmount, [so-and-so], having received the text from Master [so-and-so] and pledged the covenant, now ascends the *Mysterious Altar* to petition Heaven and receive the transmission. The Master of [a certain] Marchmount, [so-and-so], invokes the Five Thearchs, the Five Marchmounts, the Three Officials, the Nine Bureaus, the Upper Perfected, and the Four Offices, adhering to the prohibitions of the text as sworn in the *Covenant of the Grand Perfected* against divulgence. Those who bear it may traverse the various heavens, lands, waters, and named mountains, where countless natural celestial officials shall all respectfully welcome them, dispel demons, summon immortals, and soar through the Great Void, ascending to the *Upper Clarity Palace* to receive the *Sage Lord*. The Nine Heavens shall submit the text to the [designated] Perfected of the Nine Heavens. Those who treat the celestial writ with disdain, recklessly divulging it to others, shall have their seven generations eternally tormented by the demonic officials, their body subjected to the *Wind Blade’s Torment*, dying to bear the servitude of the *Nine Springs*, and never dare to aspire to immortality.

The texts are all inscribed upon yellow silk as the ground, written in blue ink, with red ink outlining the four sides to seal the treasure and conceal the celestial Perfected. The recipient must fast for seventy days, or twenty-seven days, or seven days. The disciple shall present five taels of gold, ninety feet of *phoenix-patterned silk*, and thirty-two feet of *green-patterned silk*, and together with the master ascend their life-destined Marchmount to receive the *Three Primes’ Text*. They shall face north and take their seat, arranging incense, vegetables, cakes, fruits, and offerings upon a platter, with nine measures of pure oil and nine lamps arrayed in a single setting. Five feet of crimson silk shall be laid out to hold the text, placed separately upon a stand in the center, with another stand to the east to receive the token of faith.

The disciple prostrates facing west, while the master faces north and strikes his teeth thirty-six times, then intones the prayer:

"Today, I humbly announce to the celestial Perfected, the scattered numina of the Dao, the Eight Luminaries who wander in cycles, the Nine Thearchs who descend to this court. The Three Primes loosen their sashes, ascending to commune with the Three Clarities. May this day be ever prosperous, and ten thousand vows bring forth upright fortune. Solemnly I ascend the numinous Marchmount to pledge alliance with the Five Spirits. With offerings of fruits and vegetables, I summon the Perfected to witness my utmost sincerity. May the Four Controllers and Five Thearchs, the numinous overseers of my form, cause the celestial Perfected to descend, that my Dao may become resplendently clear. Together we shall forge a covenant, soaring to ascend the Supreme Clarity."

This done, he swallows thirty-six breaths with head raised, prostrates to the five directions, then returns to face north. Kneeling upright, he makes his declaration:

"To the Nine Heavens’ Great Void, the Mysterious Numen of the Lofty Supreme, the Primordial Dao Lord of the Highest Clarity, the Jade Thearch of the Supreme Clarity, the host of sagely immortals, the numinous officials who oversee the Perfected, the Perfected Immortals, and the Four Controllers and Thearchs: Your servant once followed his former master, Master Zhang of the Central Marchmount, in receiving the Jade Tallies of the Three Primes and the secret, sealed scriptures of the numinous chapters. I dared not lightly disclose them. Now, as the Nine and Five hasten the deliverance of beings, and the numinous destiny shifts with the times, the Sagely Lord assumes his rightful place, selecting from among the imperial ministers to replenish the ranks of the Supreme Perfected.

Today, this Marchmount Master, so-and-so, has cultivated a heart of equanimity and stillness, seeking the Dao and pursuing the Perfected. Though his accumulated practice has not yet borne fruit, his aspirations now soar to the highest realms. He pledges his oath and invokes the numina, humbly receiving this precious scripture. May the divine immortals, on this very day, initiate his deliverance, as in the covenant of the Supreme Perfected. May the celestial immortals descend to oversee and illuminate his person, that his cultivation may ascend to the heights, enabling him to attain the Perfected Dao, soar through the Mysterious Void, and ascend into the Three Clarities.

Should he lightly divulge these teachings to others or reveal the celestial patterns, then by his parents who gave him life and the roots of his seven generations of ancestors, may he be eternally confined to the earthly prisons, never to be pardoned through ten thousand kalpas. May his body perish among the ghostly officials, and may he never again become an immortal."

This concluded, the master finishes reading the text, rises to stand upright, and holds the scripture in his left hand. The disciple kneels upright, receiving the text with his right hand. Together, with their remaining hands, they point to the northwest corner of the sky. The disciple raises his head and intones:

"I solemnly announce to the Nine Voids above and pledge my oath to the Five Spirits below. Having received the celestial scripture, should I dare to violate this covenantal vow, lightly divulging or carelessly revealing it, or harboring doubts toward the celestial Perfected, then by my parents who gave me life, the roots of my nine generations of ancestors, and my own person, may we all perish together, bearing the weight of the River’s source. May we endure the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, and through ten thousand kalpas, dare not complain."

This done, they depart.

The Jade Tallies of the Three Primes embody the Dao of the Eight Assemblies, the hidden scriptures of the Great Void, the secret mysteries of the Nine Heavens, and the wondrous chapters of the Supreme Clarity. They vanquish celestial demons through visualization and invocation, summoning jade immortals by their very nature. One who masters their methods will find every movement in harmony with the Perfected. His body shall generate water and fire, transforming in myriad ways. Through concentrated visualization, he ascends to the heights, and the Three Primes descend to take form.

To study without the Jade Scriptures is like a tree without roots—vainly exhausting one’s essence and sincerity, wearily depleting body and spirit. The celestial Perfected will not descend, and the body will not coalesce into immortality. To recite the precious scriptures lightly is to agitate the Nine Heavens, inviting the scrutiny of the inspectors of treachery, bringing calamity and annihilation upon oneself.

Thus, Heaven has its protocols of reverence, and the scriptures possess their hierarchical ranks. They mutually regulate one another, with higher and lower in harmonious accord. Only when the qi is fully replete does one accord with spontaneity. The Three Primes serve as the sovereigns who govern all others, while the Five Thearchs act as the officials who enforce punishments. Those who lightly undertake study without possessing the complete celestial scriptures shall be restrained. Those who leak and divulge them shall be punished by the Wind Blade, facing the consequences of life and death.

Cultivate with utmost care, following the path of the highest realms, and immortality will come easily. Yet one must guard against carelessly transgressing the celestial scriptures, violating prohibitions, and incurring punishments. Such consequences arise from shallow understanding and narrow learning, failing to fathom the origins of the Dao. To vainly invoke the Perfected with an empty body—how could the Perfected descend? With the Dao failing to descend, celestial demons seize the opportunity.

Thus, the student should widely seek instruction, exploring the famous mountains. Tread through ten thousand trials without retreat, endure nine hardships with exceptional diligence, and only then may one gain access to the celestial scriptures and be deemed worthy to receive the precious texts as a True Person of the Four Poles. Only then shall one’s qi be complete, and immortality achieved.

Yet to encounter a single scroll and sit passively, hoping for the celestial Perfected to descend with a single word, is like a fish in the abyss longing to soar to the edge of the Nine Heavens. Such study—is it not futile?

The precious, secret Jade Tallies of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen may not be seen in their entirety by those lacking golden bones, jade marrow, or whose names are not inscribed in the imperial registers of the Thearchs. Even if they are carelessly divulged and obtained by the vulgar and unworthy, within a hundred days, they will inevitably be punished by celestial calamities, and the scriptures will vanish of their own accord.

If one encounters a numinous master, ascends the sacred peaks to pledge alliance and receive transmission, yet fails to adhere to the prescribed time limits and recklessly shows the texts to others, the punishment shall extend to the roots of his nine generations of ancestors, and his own person shall bear the Wind Blade’s retribution.

If, within a hundred years, a true student of the highest learning who wears and cultivates the supreme scriptures has not yet seen these texts, he may transmit them to two others. First, he must ascend the numinous Marchmount to pledge alliance with the Nine Heavens, and only then may he be permitted to show them the Jade Scriptures. He must not lightly divulge the supreme Perfected texts without first making his oath. Should he do so, he shall be struck down by the divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs, his nine generations of ancestors seized and cast into hell, his own body annihilated by the Three Offices, his three disciples condemned to bear the weight of stones, and the Five Sufferings inflicted upon him atop the Mountain of Knives.

If one disregards the consequences of fortune and misfortune, there is no need to trouble oneself with the pursuit of immortality.

The Green Lad Lord said: "All the celestial writings of the Nine Heavens and the disciplinary texts of the Supreme Perfected share the same prohibitions and punishments, especially the Jade Tallies of the Three Primes, which are particularly precious.

Yet the Jade Tallies contain the titles of the Nine Heavenly Offices, regulating the qi of immortals and serving as the origin of ten thousand roots. How could they not be kept secret?

Later students, all of whom aspire to emulate the highest immortals, should treasure these texts, heeding the earnest words left by the pure and true. To fail in this is to forsake one’s own destiny.

When wearing the Jade Tallies and entering the chamber to visualize the Lords of the Three Primes, one may not immediately perceive them at the outset. Perhaps a strange light or other divine forms may appear before one’s eyes—this is no cause for alarm, for it is merely the celestial Perfected testing the student.

If, with eyes closed, one sees lights of blue and purple gently descending, these are the subtle emanations of the Azure Perfected of the Jade Void and the celestial titles of the Void-Reflecting Palace of the Primordial Lady of the Grand Simplicity."

The adept should draw in qi with eighty-one swallows and intone the prayer:

*"Celestial Perfected descend,
Dao’s qi shines bright.
I pay homage to the Three Primes,
attend the Jade Clarity,
ascend the Mystic Terrace,
behold the divine forms,
receive the secret names,
and sprout feathered robes.
The ten thousand immortals come to welcome me,
soaring to the imperial court."*

Upon completion, after three hundred days of such practice, one will succeed in beholding the true form of the Primordial Lady of the Grand Simplicity.

If one sees crimson and dark lights surging forth and descending, these are the subtle emanations of the Lesser Yang Supreme Perfected of the Pure Void and the celestial titles of the Void-Reflecting Palace of the Purple Simplicity Primordial Lady. The adept should draw in qi with sixty-four swallows and intone the prayer:

*"Flying immortals descend,
revolving Jade Perfected,
enter the Purple Clarity,
attend the Supreme Immortals,
serve the Three Primes,
summon the ten thousand spirits,
gaze upon their forms,
receive the precious words.
My Dao is complete—
I ascend the Nine Heavens."*

Upon completion, after three hundred days of such practice, one will behold the true form of the Purple Simplicity Primordial Lady.

If one sees lights of yellow and white hues, rich and descending, these are the subtle emanations of the Central Yellow Mysterious Perfected of the Grand Void and the celestial titles of the Void-Reflecting Palace of the Yellow Simplicity Primordial Lady. The adept should draw in qi with thirty-six swallows and intone the prayer:

*"Wandering the Central Heavens,
the Three Qi follow in train.
The Mystic Mother blends all,
dispersing numinous radiance in the Purple Tenuity.
Yellow and white divide and judge,
my Dao returns to me.
Cinnabar jade and green chariots
convey me in ascent,
upward to the Vermilion Chamber,
where the Three Primes shine as one."*

Upon completion, after three hundred days of such practice, one will succeed in beholding the true form of the Yellow Simplicity Primordial Lady.

If one sees lights of shifting colors, their hues unfixed, surging forth and descending, these are the subtle emanations of the Mysterious Yin Cavernous Void and the celestial titles of the Void-Reflecting Palace of the White Simplicity Primordial Lady. The adept should draw in qi with twenty-four swallows and intone the prayer:

*"The Three Qi transform,
the Five Colors flow as yellow.
Pristine radiance scatters the true,
blending in the Central Prime.
Descend into my chamber,
my Dao is made manifest.
I gaze upward at the divine countenance,
like orchids, like clouds.
My Dao is complete—
I ascend the Jade Gate,
pay homage to the true forms,
the Lords of the Three Primes."*

Upon completion, after three hundred days of such practice, one will succeed in beholding the true form of the White Simplicity Primordial Lady.

If one sees a nine-colored phoenix, or a single phoenix with nine heads, this is the celestial title of the Void-Reflecting Palace of the Mystic Mother of the Nine Heavens, descending upon the adept’s body—one’s Dao is nearing completion. Take care not to speak. Knock the teeth nine times, swallow qi nine times, and intone the prayer:

*"Heaven bears, Earth sustains,
the Two Qi merge in truth.
The Three and Five blend as one,
together forming my body.
The Six Qi rejoice in unison,
the ten thousand wishes unfold.
I offer to the Boundless,
the Supreme Dao draws near.
I ride the dragon and phoenix,
mount the purple mist,
soaring to the Upper Clarity,
dwelling beside the Jade Void."*

Upon completion, bow nine times in the heart and cease. After nine hundred days of such practice, with unwavering focus, one will succeed in beholding the true form of the Mystic Mother and witnessing the Perfected Ones, attaining limitless years of life.

If one sees lights as bright as the sun and moon, this is the celestial title of the Void-Reflecting Palace of the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens, descending upon the adept’s body—one’s Dao is nearing completion. Take care not to speak. Knock the teeth twelve times, swallow qi twelve times, and intone the prayer:

*"Mysterious qi scatters the true,
transforming without bound.
Heaven joins with Earth,
the Void reflects the Great Emptiness.
The numinous descends from afar,
merging with the Primordial.
The Eight Effulgences unite in harmony,
the Nine Emperors form fellowship.
I behold the Supreme Perfected,
pay homage in the Vermilion Chamber,
eternally preserving Heaven and Earth,
enduring through kalpas without end."*

Upon completion, bow nine times in the heart and cease. After nine hundred days of such practice, with unrelenting focus, one will succeed in beholding the Primordial Father in one’s chamber.

If one sees a being with one body and nine heads, or clad in nine-colored patterned robes, this is the celestial title of the Void-Reflecting Palace of the Nine Heavens True King, Keeper of the Registers of the Supreme Perfected, descending upon the adept’s body—one’s Dao is nearing completion. Take care not to speak. Knock the teeth nine times and swallow qi three times, then intone the prayer:

*"Spirit of the Nine Heavens,
essence of the Primordial Sovereign,
threefold union, ninefold transformation,
refining and transmuting the embryo.
Returning to the true, merging with the primordial,
the Void descends into my form.
Pluck out the roots of death,
prolong my life without end.
I become one with Heaven and Earth,
eternally enjoying boundless years."*

Upon completion, bow nine times in the heart and cease. Within seven hundred days of such practice, one will succeed in beholding the Nine Heavens True King face-to-face and converse with him, able to soar above the Nine Heavens.

If one sees a being with the head of a dragon and the body of a phoenix, or a single crow with nine heads, this is the celestial title of the Void-Reflecting Palace of the Left Administrator of the Primordial Heavenly King, descending upon the adept’s body—one’s Dao is nearing completion. Take care not to speak. Knock the teeth nine times, swallow qi thirty-two times, and secretly intone the prayer:

*"The Three Ways proceed in order,
the Primordial lingers in contemplation.
The Mysterious Perfected shines forth,
the Nine Numinous scatter and unfold.
Gaze flows without end,
descending radiance upon me.
Above, I don the Vermilion Effulgence,
dissolving obstructions, opening the heart.
I ride the flying clouds,
ascending to the Purple Tenuity."*

Upon completion, bow three times in the heart and cease. After three hundred days of such practice, one will succeed in beholding the true form of the Primordial Heavenly King, who will bestow upon the adept the *Nine Heavens’ Upper Scriptures*, enabling flight to the Jade Clarity.

If one sees a spirit with one body and three heads, or a being holding a five-colored banner, this is the celestial official of the Five Marchmounts’ Immortal Lords, Keeper of the Registers of the Perfected, come to examine the adept’s cultivation. Upon seeing them, maintain a sincere and focused mind, without deviation. Knock the teeth three times and secretly intone the prayer:

*"Profound, profound—dark, dark,
spirits of the Five Emperors.
The upright qi descends,
bestowing immortality upon me.
My immortality arises from truth—
without truth, none may advance.
I cultivate the Jade Texts,
governing the myriad heavens.
I report above to the Primordial,
universally to the named mountains,
commanding the ten thousand spirits
to guard my chariot,
enabling me to soar
and ascend to the Imperial Dawn."*

Upon completion, draw in qi five times and cease. After one hundred days of such practice, the Immortal Lords will descend in form and arrive at the adept’s chamber. On the eight seasonal nodes, when ascending the mountains, the Five Marchmounts will memorialize the adept’s name in the Eastern Florescence Palace, and after nine years, one will naturally attain immortality.

If one sees an old man wearing a yellow turban, clad in yellow robes, with a sash or girdle at the waist, holding a blade or a nine-jointed staff, this is the Great Demon of the Central Heaven, or the King of the Numinous Mountains, come to test the adept.

Do not fear. Calm your heart and face north. Knock your left teeth thirty-six times in succession and secretly intone:

*"Heavenly cautery, heavenly cautery,
abode of the Celestial Court,
unbound by Northern Feng,
toying with my celestial writ—
three paths let loose, six evils seize the void.
I have reported to the Northern Emperor,
to gather and suppress ghostly schemes.
Radiant fall the streaming bells,
jade-sealed celestial talismans.
Divine perfected ones exact their judgment,
eradicating all without remainder.
Swift as my fate commands,
no delay, no lingering."*

Cease, then with both hands pinch the gates behind your ears, drawing in qi thirty-six times to conclude.

When thus entering mountains or engaging in cultivation, all heavenly demons and mountain spirits shall be annihilated beneath the might of this oral incantation, never again to test or disturb you. The perfected immortal officials will naturally descend, and within no more than a year, you shall attain immortality.

If you see an old woman wearing a white turban, draped in a yellow mantle and purple skirt, this is the Yin Official of Northern Feng, the marshal of the Great Demon. If you see a maiden of twenty or so, her hair bound in a three-cornered topknot, clad in five-colored robes, holding a golden halberd, this is the daughter of the Lord of Northern Feng’s capital—both come to test your authenticity.

Knock your teeth thirty-two times in succession and secretly intone:

*"Flying Sovereign, Yin’s encircling,
born of the Six Heavens,
transforming qi to bear numinous power,
your lifespan governed by a century’s reckoning.
Three generations shift in turn,
all pure and bright ascend—
why alone do you linger,
mired in the mortal world?
Yesterday, by imperial command,
you were sent to inspect and delay.
Depart swiftly without lingering,
that you may briefly extend your stay.
Report separately to Northern Feng,
to restrain and dispatch your demonic form."*

Cease, then with both hands swiftly pinch the gates behind your ears, drawing in qi thirty-six times to conclude.

Practicing the Dao thus in pursuit of immortality, the myriad demons shall be vanquished in trial, celestial essences shattered and dispersed, and the Dao shall naturally come to fruition. Within a hundred days, heavenly perfected ones will descend, conversing with your spirit. Such visions may come while meditating with eyes closed, or after a hundred days of facing them as before, or even in dreams during sleep. Without steadfast resolve, one will not perceive the true and be moved to see them.

Once the great method is faintly grasped, within nine years, none shall fail to behold the perfected divine spirits. Upon seeing the true and perfected, one shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

Disciples who meditate with eyes closed, knock their teeth, and visualize spirit and qi, yet remain unaware of the luminous forms and appearances—both true and false—labor in vain, their toil unanswered, never moved to perceive the true. Seeing the true yet failing to summon the spirits, or seeing the false yet failing to vanquish the demons—how then shall the true descend, or the demons perish?

As the Queen Mother possesses the *Western Tortoise Record*, which depicts the forms of the ten thousand spirits and the radiance of the ten thousand perfected, those who study yet fail to see this—how can they hope to succeed? For those who practice visualization to summon spirits without the method of penetrating insight, even the highest perfected ones cannot be readily attained. Only those whose sincerity moves the depths shall be met by the officials of illusory reflection, who open the fordways of their passage—this is the means to perfect attainment.

If the body bears defilement or impurities, or if one’s cultivation of qi remains incomplete, heavenly demons and mountain spirits will invariably test and thwart them first. Facing such trials yet unaware of the incantations to vanquish them, immortality shall never be achieved. With these incantations, practiced within a hundred days, no demon shall remain, and no true spirit shall fail to descend.

This is the subtle and wondrous Dao, not to be expounded in written discourse. To recklessly divulge these words invites judgment upon one’s parents, ancestors, and the very roots of their lineage. Guard this secret with utmost care, and the Dao shall perfect your body.

**Three Primordials Jade-Tablet Memorial and Petition Rite**
If, after nine years of receiving the method, the heavenly perfected have yet to descend, follow the original text to inscribe two pieces of yellow silk as per the talisman-wearing method, and offer them at the marchmount of your natal destiny. Arrange a platter of incense, vegetables, cakes, and fruit, along with nine measures of pure oil set in nine lamps. Prepare a seat facing north, place the text at its center upon a crimson silk cloth, and write three bamboo slips to be laid beneath the incense and offerings.

The recipient shall face north, knock their teeth thirty-six times in succession, and softly intone:

*"Supreme numen of the August Heaven,
formless in primordial chaos,
thirty-nine emperors,
Five Elders of Highest Clarity—
on this auspicious dawn,
celestial immortals scatter their essence.
Eight luminaries wander,
Three Primordials hasten with jade.
Flowing perfection descends,
gazing upon the empty courtyard.
Your servant, so-and-so,
dares to address the Great Numen:
once, by imperial command,
I received the precious scripture,
jade tablets of hidden writ,
the Three Primordials’ inner names.
Meditating in seclusion, yearning for the divine,
I have yet to behold their true forms.
I now ascend the lofty marchmount,
arraying my memorial in cinnabar and azure.
I cast my petition into the hidden mountains,
burning incense in the eight darknesses.
The Four Controllers and Five Emperors,
witness my utmost sincerity.
Present my bamboo slips,
that they ascend to Highest Clarity.
May the perfected spirits descend,
flying into the imperial court."*

Conclude by burning one silk text and one bamboo slip at the altar until consumed. Mix nine kinds of incense with the oil and pour it over the flames.

The remaining ashes shall be scattered to the azure heavens upon the wind.

At the moment of offering, strike the teeth nine times and invoke:
"May the spirits return to the Nine Heavens,
may the writ descend to the Nine Springs,
ascend to be heard by the Nine Offices,
and below be announced at the River’s Source.
I bear the Three Primordials,
jade tablets of hidden writ.
Let the numinous perfected descend,
clear and undivided.
I swear again to the Highest Void,
burning incense to be heard above.
May the Five Numinous shine upon me,
may the Eight Emperors command the immortals,
send down to me a flying chariot,
hasten to me the purple mist,
that I may ascend to the Great Void,
and rise to the Imperial Dawn."

This done, take another writ and bury it beneath the fire’s former site, nine feet deep. Set a vessel atop it filled with incense and fruit, then tamp the earth level. Strike the teeth nine times again and invoke:
"Above, I announce to the Nine Heavens;
below, to the Nine Numinous.
To the Three Offices and Nine Offices,
to the Twelve Immortal Courts,
I reverently bury this jade writ,
casting my petition into the Great Darkness.
Let me ascend and fly,
restore my form,
awaiting the dragon-drawn carriage
to assemble together in the Purple Court."

This done, bury one slip on the southern slope of the mountain and another on the northern slope, each nine feet deep. When burying them, face the southern slip to the south and the northern slip to the north. Strike the teeth twenty-four times and softly invoke:
"O Three Clarities of the Mysterious Void,
Nine Numinous of the Hidden Subtle,
as the Great Revolution completes its cycle
and the Five Phases shift in succession,
the Supreme Emperor has decreed,
heaven’s passage and earth’s gate open.
He has bestowed upon me the jade writ,
entrusting me with the myriad mechanisms,
commanding the void and summoning emptiness,
that all perfected spirits may return.
Yet the true immortals have not descended,
and the Three Primordials linger in hesitation.
As days pass and seasons turn,
the Dao responds in due time.
I cast my petition upon the Dark Marchmount,
proclaiming the decree to the Four Negations.
Let me ascend early,
let the celestial perfected descend in radiance,
that I may ride the Eight Effulgences
and ascend to the Purple Tenuity."

This done, proceed with the burial. The same invocation applies to both sites.

The Twofold Petition to the Three Primordials: An Upper Method

This method is for beginners who have not yet received the descent of the celestial perfected. Perform it once yearly, and the celestial perfected shall unfailingly descend to your chamber. If you perceive even faint traces or glimpse the divine presence, you shall ascend within the year, and need not petition again or sacrifice to the celestial spirits.

Without this method, the Dao cannot be accomplished, nor can the spirits descend. This is the foundation of all practice. Its marvel lies in secrecy—only through reverence does the Dao respond; only through caution do the perfected descend. To carelessly reveal this supreme method invites immediate celestial censure.

**To the Purple Void, Jade Clarity, Mysterious Nonbeing, Lofty Emperor, Purple Simplicity, Upper Primordial Great Perfected:**

[Your name], Master of [Your Sacred Peak], styled [Your courtesy name], aged [Your age] years, born in the [Your birth month], respectfully receives the celestial writ of the Upper Primordial. I humbly beseech the descent of the celestial perfected, that I may soar through the Upper Clarity, attend the Upper Primordial, and swiftly attain divine transcendence.

Petitioned on the [Day] of the [Month] in the [Year], at the hour of [Time].

Inscribe this in purple ink upon a silver tablet, one foot and two inches in length. Fold the text and burn it.

**To the Purple Void, Jade Clarity, Mysterious Primordial, Lofty Emperor, Yellow Simplicity, Middle Primordial Great Perfected:**

[Your name], Master of [Your Sacred Peak], styled [Your courtesy name], aged [Your age] years, born in the [Your birth month], respectfully receives the immortal writ of the Middle Primordial. I humbly beseech the descent of the celestial perfected, that I may soar through the Upper Clarity, attend the Middle Primordial, and swiftly attain divine transcendence.

Petitioned on the [Day] of the [Month] in the [Year], at the hour of [Time].

Inscribe this in yellow ink upon a silver tablet, one foot and two inches in length. Bury it on the southern slope of a mountain, three feet deep.

**To the Purple Void, Jade Clarity, Mysterious Primordial, Lofty Emperor, White Simplicity, Lower Primordial Great Perfected:**

[Your name], Master of [Your Sacred Peak], styled [Your courtesy name], aged [Your age] years, born in the [Your birth month], respectfully receives the terrestrial writ of the Lower Primordial. I humbly beseech the descent of the celestial perfected, that I may soar through the Upper Clarity, attend the Lower Primordial, and swiftly attain divine transcendence.

Petitioned on the [Day] of the [Month] in the [Year], at the hour of [Time].

Inscribe this in white ink upon a silver tablet, one foot and two inches in length. Bury it on the northern slope of a mountain, three feet deep.

The Three Primordial Jade Tablets are the most sacred writ of the celestial perfected. They form the foundation of transcendence practice. Perform this rite for a hundred days, and the divine forms shall manifest. No prayer shall go unanswered, no thought unfulfilled, no aspiration unaccomplished. Those who obtain this method shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

If silver is unavailable, use jade; if jade is unavailable, silverwood may suffice. Ensure the tablet is wrapped in pure white cloth, free of any impurity, before use.

Long ago, Ning Xuanfu received this method from the August Supreme Perfected. Nine years after his ascension failed, he buried the tablets on White Hollow Mountain, nine feet deep. Later, the disciple Li Zhongjun passed by the chamber of White Hollow Mountain. After a hundred days of fasting and devotion, he suddenly beheld a silver tablet inscribed with jade script within the cavern. Zhongjun offered a pledge of gold and azure, vowing sincerity before the spirits. After three years of kneeling devotion, the Three Primordials descended, extending his lifespan by seven hundred years. He then journeyed to Lao Valley Master, received the true writ, and ascended to heaven.

A copy of this writ remains sealed on White Hollow Mountain.

The Primordial Sovereign, in the celestial wilds of Golden Mound, bestowed this upon the Azure Void Perfected, Master Wang, to teach those whose bone destiny aligns with transcendence. Those who obtain this method shall attain transcendence without study.

**The Upper Method for Internal Cultivation of the Three Primordials: Summoning the Perfected and Inviting the Divine**

The Three Primordial Sovereigns of Grand Simplicity dwell in the Highest Upper Clarity Palace, within the Hall of Vast Spirit. The morning lamps illuminate the Jade Perfected; radiant light shines within the Cinnabar Chamber. The Three Flowers exhale their brilliance in spontaneity; divine splendor illumines the Nine Mysteries. Auspicious spirits gather upon the Jade Terrace; flying mists thicken at the Purple Pavilion. The Mysterious Chart is revealed in the Upper Gallery; the Five Talismans are ordered within the Embryonic Venerable. The Three Primordials are arrayed in Grand Simplicity; the Register of Life is governed at the Jade Gate. In lofty solitude, they contemplate the wondrous abyss. When they emerge to wander the Empyrean Observatory, the sun and moon incline their radiance; the ranked candles uproot their foundations. The Eight Winds reverse their waves; the tempest stirs the hidden source. Jade brilliance gleams in clarity; the high heavens dance at dawn. Crimson clouds unfold in layers; yellow mists coil sevenfold. The Five Elders open the path; the Supreme Emperor supports the wheel. The Western Sovereign bears the staff; the Eastern Flower raises the banner. The Nine Heavens waver in reverence; the Grand Primordial stirs the mist. Hidden qi gathers in obscurity; the Eight Effulgences brush away dust. Gazing upward, they survey the boundless; looking down, they encompass the hundred spheres. Truly, they are the most exalted of the perfected, their wondrous transformations beyond measure.

The Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity are the maiden of singular perfection, mothers of the Three Primordial Ladies of Simplicity. The Primordial Lady of Grand Simplicity coalesced in an empty womb, born of blossoming radiance, delivered in the Highest Upper Clarity’s Jeweled Simplicity of the Nine Mysteries Jade Sovereign Heaven. Her taboo-name is Zheng Hui Tiao, her style Yun Chun Ying. Upon her head she wears the Jeweled Langfu Dawn Feather Crown; her robe is a floating-cloud brocade of purple qi, her skirt a nine-hued dragon-silk feathered garment. At her waist hangs a belt of flowing gold, fire bells, tiger talismans, and dragon-script. She sits amid the Great Void, beneath her knees ever the cinnabar, green, and azure clouds of the Three Simplicities, their qi crowning and veiling her form.

For those who would practice the Dao of flying transcendents and bear the script of the Three Primordials’ Jade Tallies, at midnight within a secluded chamber, face north, close the eyes, and knock the teeth thrice. Visualize the Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity in their raiment, taboo-names, and styles, riding the cinnabar, green, and azure Simplicity whirlwind-chariot, descending from the Jade Sovereign Heaven into the chamber. Then, with the heart, bow to the Primordial Lady and softly invoke:

Triune qi, primordial essence,
Nine Heavens’ supreme numen,
dawn’s radiance gleams in clarity,
jade blossoms illumine the cave.
Three Simplicities’ flying whirlwind,
cinnabar shafts and green chariots,
Eight Winds raise the wheels,
flowing reflections brighten the Empyrean court.
Summon the perfected, induce transcendence,
descend into my form.
May all aspirations prosper,
every intent achieve fulfillment.
Golden countenance, blossoming visage,
inner treasury resplendent.
Eight Effulgences bear the palanquin,
bones take flight, flesh grows light.
Ascend the cinnabar terrace,
pay homage in Jade Clarity.

Conclude, then swallow qi twenty-four times and cease. Open the eyes and recite the Jade Clarity Upper Palace’s *Lonesome Chant of Jeweled Jade*, harmonizing with the qi of form and soul, rejoicing in the Grand Simplicity’s exalted perfected. The chant:

Grand Primordial links Jade Clarity,
Three Luminaries illumine the heights.
Eight Effulgences turn the dawn wind,
scattering clouds, misty flying numina.
Round wheels cast into the empty vast,
golden reflections crown Heaven’s essence.
Jade blossoms bind the Five Elders,
purple mists wheel the Empyrean chariot.
Riding qi, sway the mysterious chamber,
yield and follow, transcend the traversed.
Golden visage gleams with ninefold auroras,
jade form radiates the frigid court.
Secluded youths turn childlike glances,
aged elders revert to infancy.
The Celestial One solidifies the mud-pill,
Nine Perfected guard Yellow Tranquility.
Gaze beyond ten thousand kalpas,
equal this Nine Heavens’ inclination.

Conclude, then with the heart bow, swallow saliva thrice, and cease entirely.

The eldest daughter of the Primordial Lady of Grand Simplicity is the Primordial Lady of Purple Simplicity, mother of the Lord of Non-Flourishing. The Primordial Lady of Purple Simplicity reposed in a jade womb within a purple embryo, nurturing emptiness’s elegance in the Jade Portal, coalescing numinous progeny to embody perfection, congealing spirit to emerge in spontaneity. Her taboo-name is Yi Yu Qi Ren, her style An Lai Shang. Upon her head she wears the Supreme Perfection Dawn Infant Crown, a three-cornered topknot, the rest of her hair unbound and trailing to her waist. Above, she dons a purple brocade robe; below, a frost-flying gauze skirt. She also wears the sash of numinous flight, seated upon the Great Void, ever veiled by purple-qi clouds crowning her form.

For those who would practice the second Dao of flying transcendents and bear the script of the Three Primordials’ Jade Tallies, at midnight within a secluded chamber, face north, close the eyes, and knock the teeth thrice. Visualize the Primordial Lady of Purple Simplicity in her raiment, taboo-name, and style, riding the purple-cloud Three Simplicities’ flying chariot, descending from Upper Clarity into the left chamber of your numinous dwelling. Then, with the heart, bow to the Primordial Lady of Purple Simplicity and softly invoke:

Triune Primordials’ exalted numina,
Purple Simplicity’s cloud chariot,
strategize the void, tread emptiness,
wander the Empyrean court.
Flowing perfected descend in gaze,
gallop the canopy’s blossoming essence.
Three Passes securely settled,
cave chamber illumined in clarity.
Bones transform, flesh ascends,
inner and outer take flight in lightness.
Eastern Blossom inscribes the tally,
August Elders record the name.
Three Perfected descend and bestow,
my Dao attains long life.
Ascend to enjoy primordial felicity,
nothing fails to achieve fruition.
Attain to ride the flying effulgence,
ascend to Jade Clarity.

Conclude, then swallow qi twenty-four times, open the eyes, and recite the Jade Clarity Upper Palace’s *Lonesome Chant of Jeweled Jade*. Its words:

Mysterious emptiness penetrates primordial simplicity,
Three Cinnabars govern the luminous mechanism.
Flying Empyrean luxuriates in Purple Clarity,
brilliant cascades open the Nine Heavens’ gates.
I ride the numinous movement,
suddenly revering the Three Gates’ opening.
Hands grasp the Heaven-Earth portal,
feet tread the Five Peaks’ ladder.
Gazing within the myriad regions,
occasionally answering my heart’s intent.
Awakening to see the origin beyond movement,
thus the exalted perfected return.
Together incline the Heaven-Earth kalpa,
soaring the void in flight.

Conclude, then with the heart bow, swallow saliva thrice, and cease entirely.

The Primordial Lady of Yellow Simplicity is the middle daughter of Grand Simplicity, mother of the Central Yellow Elder Lord. The Primordial Lady of Yellow Simplicity’s taboo-name is Que Hui Yuan Hua Huang Ren, her style Tai Zhang Shang. Upon her head she wears the Supreme Perfection Dawn Infant Crown, a three-cornered topknot, the rest of her hair unbound and trailing to her waist. Above, she dons a yellow brocade robe; below, a five-hued flying azure brocade skirt. She wears the sash of phoenix-script numinous blossoms, at her waist a belt with a flowing-yellow radiance-dispelling sword, seated upon the Mysterious Void, ever veiled by yellow-cloud qi crowning her form.

For those who would practice the Dao of flying transcendents and bear the script of the Three Primordials’ Jade Tallies, at midnight within a secluded chamber, face north, close the eyes, and knock the teeth thrice. Visualize the Primordial Lady of Yellow Simplicity in her raiment, taboo-name, and style, riding the Three Simplicities’ flying chariot, descending from Upper Clarity into the central chamber of your numinous dwelling. Then, with the heart, bow to the Primordial Lady of Yellow Simplicity and softly invoke:

Triune qi’s exalted perfected,
supreme numinous primordial spirit,
flowing effulgences in the Empyrean chamber,
entering and exiting the blossoming dawn.
Returning perfected descend,
illuminating my spirit in clarity.
Penetrate the mysterious, pierce the subtle,
summon the numinous, induce transcendence.
Inspect and govern the four movements,
reverse the kalpa, halt the years.
Revert the aged to blossoming visage,
golden countenance within as transcendent.
Serve the Three Primordials,
ascend the purple chariot.

Conclude, then swallow qi twenty-four times, open the eyes, and recite the Jade Clarity Upper Palace’s *Lonesome Chant of Jeweled Jade*. Its words:

Flying Empyrean mists the mysterious peak,
cloud nets weave the Heavenly web.

The pure Han’s numinous resonance flows,
exquisite chant harmonizes with the rhythm.
Since I have wearied of mundane utility,
what pursuit could be deemed excessive?
Only then do I awaken to the Three Mysteries’ revelation,
the Nine Cycles suddenly slipping past.
Gazing within the great image,
unaware of what may come.
Lacking the art of the fasting youths,
misty qi descends as jade radiance.
Without harnessing spring’s power,
how can one preserve the yang branch?

Conclude, then bow in the heart, swallow saliva thrice, and cease.

The Primordial Lady of White Simplicity is the youngest daughter of the Primordial Lady of Supreme Simplicity and the mother of the White Primordial Lord. Her taboo name is *Qiming Xiaoren*, her style *Jinmen Shang*, her head crowned with the *Grand Perfected Dawn Infant’s* coronet, her triple-coiled chignon unbound, the rest of her hair cascading to her waist. She wears an upper garment of luminous white brocade and a lower skirt of flying-frost green brocade, girded with a pendant of *Six-Mountain Fire Jade* and a sash of *Phoenix-Writ Phoenix-Floret*, her waist bearing the *Sun-Extending Radiance* sword. She sits upon the *Mystic Void*, ever enveloped in a mist of white cloud that veils her form.

To practice the Dao of flying transcendence and bear the script of the *Three Primordials’ Jade Tallies*, one must at midnight within a secluded chamber face north, close the eyes, and knock the teeth thrice. Visualize the Primordial Lady of White Simplicity—her raiment, taboo name, and style—riding a white, simple flying wheel, descending from the Highest Clarity into the right chamber of one’s *Cavern Palace*. Then bow in the heart to the Primordial Lady of White Simplicity and softly invoke:

Primal numinous void,
mysterious image reveals the true.
Three unite as one,
ascending to transform spontaneously.
Heavenly blossoms stream their gaze,
descending spirits mold the elixir.
Curved reflections return the numinous,
illuminating my body in radiance.
Penetrate the Three Passes,
qi spreads through the cinnabar field.
Transform yin and yang,
unite with the imperial spirit’s honor.
Soul settled, spirit tranquil,
eternally preserve the jade transcendent.
Ascend the golden terrace’s effulgence,
pay homage to the Three Primordials.
Uttermost numinous heaven and earth,
rejoice in exultant bliss.

Conclude, then swallow qi twenty-four times and cease. Open the eyes and recite once more the Jade Clarity Upper Palace’s *Lonesome Chant of Jeweled Jade*. Its words:

Whirlwind wheels dance the hollow void,
chanting songs at the cloud’s edge.
Lonesome, bright, lofty resonance,
scattering winds harmonize with jade pipes.
A hundred strains arise in the remote realm,
flying mists gallop the six reins.
Vast and unbound, shedding myriad burdens,
pure lapels free of the slightest hindrance.
Unfettered, roam the nine wilds,
transcend the eight spheres’ bounds.
Carefree between heaven and earth,
how could one reckon years or age?

Conclude, then bow in the heart and swallow saliva thrice to cease.

The Jade Clarity Upper Palace’s *Lonesome Chant of Jeweled Jade* comprises ninety chapters. The Three Primordial Lords preside over it, and the Primordial Lords ever chant its verses to harmonize the qi of form and soul, to rejoice the perfected of the Nine Palaces. Practicing the Dao of the Three Primordials, one should recite this chant to seek resonance with the utmost numinous and summon the path of the descending mystic elixir. Cultivating this Dao for no more than three years, visualizing the Three Primordials, one will perceive their semblance, and they shall descend in your form. Upon beholding the Three Primordials, one attains longevity of ten thousand years.

The Highest regards the Three Primordials as the root of the cavern, the Great Elixir as the Three Primordials’ utmost essence. The Three Primordials, containing the true and flourishing effulgence, arise from the void, dwelling in the Highest Highest Clarity’s *Jeweled Simplicity Nine Mysteries Jade Emperor Heaven*, congealing spirit in the Great Vastness, tranquil in the numinous pass. Above, they govern ten thousand offices, universally leading the host of transcendents; they inspect and hold the precious scriptures, overseeing the cavern texts. At the center, they govern the registers, the names of those who attain the Dao, the ledgers of life and death, all subject to their charge. Below, they regulate the Five Peaks, the mountains and seas, the rivers and springs; above, they govern the Highest, below, the Cavern Palace.

For the practitioner, one should chant the exquisite verses in a silent chamber, scatter jade tones through the nine voids. Then the seven ancestors receive grace from the Highest, dark souls are reborn as womb transcendents, the primordial father transforms in the numinous capital, the mystic mother rejoices in the jade chamber. Accumulated resonance stirs in the essence of feeling, secret contemplation pierces the Great Void, the divine countenance is unveiled in wondrous vision, the numinous descends spontaneously. Within three years, one may attain audience with the Primordial of Supreme Simplicity and behold the true forms of the Three Primordials.

The Primordial Lords of Supreme Simplicity and the Three Primordials of Simplicity conceal their names and styles, all appellations of the empty void’s spontaneity, forming tones from the purple void’s resonance. Knowing the name of the Primordial Lady of White Simplicity and visualizing her for three years, one may behold her true form; seeing her true form, one attains longevity of three thousand years. Knowing the name of the Primordial Lady of Yellow Simplicity and visualizing her for three years, one may behold her true form; seeing her true form, one attains longevity of ten thousand years. Knowing the name of the Primordial Lady of Purple Simplicity and visualizing her for three years, one may behold her true form; upon beholding her, one attains wealth and longevity of thirty thousand years. Knowing the Primordial Lords of Supreme Simplicity, one’s longevity endures as long as heaven and earth; visualizing them, one beholds their true forms. Upon beholding the Primordial Lords of Supreme Unity, one’s longevity rivals heaven and earth.

The precious names and utmost taboos are secrets of the Highest. Those who know them inscribe their names in the mystic records, and twelve jade maidens of the Upper Palace of the Three Primordials attend and guard their persons. To lightly disclose or disseminate them invites the seven ancestors to bear the blame, one’s own life forfeit, subject to the three calamities, five sufferings, and ten thousand kalpas of irredeemable torment.

**The Hidden Audience of the Three Primordials: Inner Dao of the Upper Transcendents**

All who receive the *Three Primordials’ Jade Tallies* and cultivate the Dao of the Three Primordials must at dawn within a secluded chamber pay homage to the Primordial Lords of Supreme Simplicity. Regularly on the tenth day of the first month, the ninth day of the second month, the eighth day of the third month, the seventh day of the fourth month, the sixth day of the fifth month, the fifth day of the sixth month, the fourth day of the seventh month, the third day of the eighth month, the second day of the ninth month, the eleventh day of the tenth month, the twelfth day of the eleventh month, and the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, at midnight in a tranquil chamber, burn incense, face north, and bow in the heart thrice. Then, seated or reclining as one wishes, kowtow and invoke in the heart:

With reverence, I invoke the Supreme Great Dao, the High Void Jade Dawn, the Three Primordial Lords of the Supreme Simplicity Purple Palace, the Central Yellow Elder, the Peerless, the White Primordial, the Jade Emperor, the Five Elders of the Highest Perfected, the Jade Lord of the Mysterious Imperial Ultimate. I, so-and-so, am a disciple of the Three Effulgences of the Great Cavern. On this auspicious night, when the celestial passes open ninefold, I humbly announce before the Supreme Primordial Lords of Supreme Simplicity, the Three Primordial Ladies of Simplicity, and the True Lord Jade Emperor, beseeching longevity in the world, an age of a hundred million years, to ride the yellow dawn’s green-canopied dragon carriage, ascend to the Purple Court, command the myriad spirits, and attend the Four Luminants and the Primordial Lord of Supreme Simplicity.

Having completed this, bow thrice in reverence and swallow nine times while gazing upward. This practice should be performed regularly, without others knowing. Such is the Way of the Hidden Audience with the Three Primordials by the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate—offering nocturnal rites and vows.

The *Three Primordials’ Jade Tallies of the Supreme Clarity* and the *Three Primordials’ Dispersed Scriptures* conclude here. #1 *Ascended Immortal*: likely a scribal error for *Celestial Immortal*.
