**The Supreme Seven-Star Divine Incantation Sutra**

The Yellow-Old Primordial Emperor, upon the Golden Terrace of the Purple Chamber in the Jade Grotto of Supreme Clarity, asked the Heavenly Elder:

"From whence do the calamities and misfortunes of the people below arise?"

The Heavenly Elder replied: "In the time before the separation of primordial chaos, when the original transformation was undivided, Heaven and Earth took their places. Then the Five Phases began their cycles throughout the world, inspecting the lawless states and observing the inauspicious people. All beings within the empty realm, all creatures that stir and live, have their fates bound to Heaven. When stars trespass and comets collide, war arises, floods and droughts displace the people. Those who recognize these signs and flee may preserve themselves, but those who defy them meet harm, and misfortune follows. The common folk perish, sinking into the sea of suffering."

The Primordial Emperor said: "How can I bear the people’s suffering? By what means may they be delivered and spared from rising hardships?"

The Heavenly Elder Emperor Lord instructed the recitation of the Seven-Star Divine Incantation and the measured steps of Yu. Each day, facing east and reciting it seven times, one may dispel celestial disasters above and disperse terrestrial misfortunes below. Demonic spirits, sorcery, specters, and poisonous essences will naturally dissolve and submit. They will flee from one’s path and dare not cause harm. The Daoist adept can eradicate misaligned qi, restore exhausted years, and all manner of calamities will vanish upon recitation of the incantation.

"You must conceal this within a golden casket and guard it well. Do not transmit it carelessly, for if bestowed upon the unworthy, Heaven will send down penal writs."

Then the incantation was spoken:

*"The sun rises in the east, radiant with mighty light.
Divine spirits guard me, the Gate of Blessings stands firm.
Lu Cun bestows grace, unyielding as blazing steel.
Grasping completion, upholding the great realm.
Before crossing the threshold of doom, depart to the realm of water ghosts.
The Three Origins fill the body, the Eight Spirits establish boundaries.
Those who defy me shall perish; none dare oppose.
By the statutes of the Yellow-Old, swiftly depart afar.
The Northern Spirit governs the record, forever severing inauspiciousness.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute!"*
