### *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of the Wisdom and Original Vows of the Precepts, Upper Grade*

**1.**
The Celestial Pole Immortal Duke respectfully inquired of the Celestial Pole Dharma Master.

While the Immortal Duke was in quiet retreat on Mount Tiantai, reverently cultivating the Dao, he bowed in worship and addressed the Numinous Treasure Mystic Master, the Celestial Pole Supreme Void Perfected One:

**2.**
"As your disciple, I am fortunate to attend in the presence of the Heavenly Worthy. My humble words, though slight, encompass the myriad kalpas; gazing deeply into the source of the Dao, my joy surpasses all measure. Yet, from my youth, I have been fond of the Way of divine transcendents and the path of ascending in broad daylight. My thoughts ever aspire to the sagely realms, though I have only glimpsed them faintly. The great scriptures are profound and distant, their subtleties difficult to fathom. I now seek oral instructions to dispel the darkness of my ignorance, to thoroughly illuminate the void and the obscure, where being and non-being are wholly exhausted.

Recently, I have yet to fully comprehend the causes and conditions of past lives and the origins of human existence. Today, I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to enlighten what I have not yet awakened to."

At that moment, the Supreme Cavern Perfected One chanted and intoned the *Cavern Hymns of the Void*, his countenance radiant with joy.

**3.**
With a golden glow upon his face and a smile, he spoke: "This one has cultivated the Dao across countless kalpas, attaining the jade name of the Celestial Pole. Dwelling among the wise, he shall stride alone through the Jade Capital, transcending the Three Realms—how majestic is the task of the Supreme Immortal Duke! Thus, his compassion extends to gods and humans, and his thoughts turn to guiding later learners. He constantly saves beings by relinquishing his own form, possessing virtue yet remaining unnamed. The assessments of the Mystic Metropolis are surely not in vain.

He then addressed the Celestial Pole Perfected One: 'You have received the command of the Supreme Void Sovereign Dao Lord to serve as his master and protector. You must fully instruct him in the profound mysteries of the Supreme Great Cavern—why wait for him to ask repeatedly? I, unworthy, am merely the Dharma Master of the Teaching Assembly. As for holding the scroll, that is your duty.'"

**4.**
The Celestial Pole Perfected One replied: "This youth of pure integrity has a name inscribed on the golden tablets. His nature is pure and transcendent, his brilliance surpassing the Supreme. Profound and subtle, he penetrates the void—thus, he is destined for the role of Immortal Duke, a great vessel for propagating the Dao. Though I, unworthy, have received the charge of instruction, I am ashamed to be inadequate as his master. Yet, the Supreme One has issued a command—how dare I not pour forth all that I contain?"

The governance of all mysteries depends upon you, Dharma Master."

The Celestial Pole Perfected One said: "The Dao is Non-Being. Pervading the boundless, if you seek it, it lies near within yourself—yet it is also Being. Through Being one enters Non-Being; through accumulated contemplation one attains the wondrous. The myriad things teem like illusions, all destined to return to emptiness. The human body is no different: when the body dies, the spirit departs. It may be likened to a house—when the house collapses, the person cannot stand; when the body decays, the spirit cannot dwell. Thus, one must restrain thoughts to stabilize the will, quiet the body to settle the spirit, treasure qi to preserve essence, and forget both reflection and care. Inwardly meditate and visualize, and body and spirit will unite as one. When body and spirit unite, one approaches the true body. This truly arises from the fundamental conduct of past lives, from accumulated contemplation and repeated resonance, from merit that aids all beings and virtue that shades the myriad things. Through the turning of karmic conditions, sin and blessing stand in opposition, life and death alternate, noble and base employ one another, worthy and foolish vie, poor and rich deceive, good and evil manifest—their suffering is measureless, all earned by the vows and deeds of human beings. It is neither the Dao nor Heaven, neither Earth nor man, nor the work of the myriad things, but precisely the heart. Once this duality is fixed, it is difficult to escape. Among the weak and lost, few believe in the Dao, many cling to past lives. Without accumulating goodness and stabilizing contemplation, without cultivating virtue in one’s person, yet desiring to neglect virtue and forget the self, forcibly seeking external things—how can this be attained? Having already failed, none avoid harm to the body. Therefore, the man of Dao draws from his own person and seeks nothing from others. As the scripture says: 'Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true.' This is what it means.

To study the Dao without receiving the Great Wisdom, the Fundamental Vows, and the Upper Grade Precepts of the Dao Conduct, one has no means to ascend as an immortal. You possess past-life karmic affinity, which is why you behold this scripture. Its text is recondite; first establish faith and verify the heart, then transmit it. It must not be rashly shown to the faithless. If they do not believe, they will surely entertain heterodox thoughts. Once heterodox thoughts arise, both parties incur transgression. Therefore, conceal it in the realm of Non-Being and await one destined to become an Immortal King before revealing it."

At that moment, clouds and dragons leapt and danced, the various heavens scattered blossoms, flying incense and curling smoke arose, mountains and seas stilled their waves, all things fell silent, ghosts and demons vanished, divine and demonic forces submitted, the Five Sufferings were wholly resolved, those long bound in hell were released, the wicked turned to goodness, and the faithful and obedient received blessings. Then the Celestial Pole Perfected One commanded the scripture-attendant, the immortal Liu Wenjing, to part the clouds and report before bestowing the scripture.

**The Upper Grade Precepts of the Fundamental Vows of Great Wisdom**
The Celestial Pole Perfected One said: "In past lives, one reverently served scripture masters, recited with the mouth and practiced with the body, gave alms to those in distress, took joy in the Three Treasures, was loyal to lord and filial to parents, longed for mountains and rivers, dwelt among worthy scholars, maintained an empty mind and embraced the Dao, burned incense and scattered blossoms, protected and delivered all beings, cultivated virtue and amended faults, believed in and submitted to past-life karma, stilled thoughts and restrained emotions. In such conduct, above one may ascend as an immortal and deliver the world; below one may revolve through cycles of wealth and nobility, be born as a person of honor, with a majestic and handsome appearance, pure and transcendent talent and wisdom. In the Way of being human, nothing is lacking.

Those who, dwelling in wealth and nobility, scorn the poor and lowly will in this life be repaid with poverty and lowliness. Those who delight in killing in this life will be repaid with early death and injury..."

Those who, dwelling in the world, mock the plain and homely will in this life be repaid with plainness and homeliness. Those who, dwelling in the world with keen intelligence, do not teach others will in this life be repaid with dullness and obstruction. Those who, dwelling in the world in constant health, mock the afflicted and sick will in this life be repaid with chronic illness. Those who, dwelling in the world, do not believe in the Dao and mock the scriptures and teachings will in this life be repaid with utter foolishness, forever cut off from the Dao.

Those who, dwelling in the world, steal another’s husband will in this life be repaid with early widowhood. Those who, dwelling in the world, seduce another’s wife will in this life be repaid with lifelong solitude. Those who, dwelling in the world, pledge to be husband and wife but later fail to be reborn together in the human realm, dying as lowly ghosts, will in this life be repaid according to their original vow, suffering from perverse illnesses. Without the great Dharma, none can untangle their karmic bonds or dispel these perverse illnesses.

As for fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, rulers and ministers, teachers and guardians, friends—all are bound by past-life vows, wishing to become karmic conditions, revolving through cycles of rebirth. None are without their counterparts, hence it is said that fortune and misfortune are unfathomable.

Only the scholar of the immortal Dao should forget karmic conditions, sever the bonds of life and death, and merge into the mysterious, entering the wondrous gate. Those who can do this are fit to be called students of the Dao.

When seeing a small nation, one should wish for all to know restraint, embrace emptiness, and be content in their place.

When seeing the marketplace, one should wish for all to gather like clouds around the worthy, widely propagating the right Dao. When seeing a quiet abode, one should wish for all to accumulate towering merit, with heaven and humans attaining their aspirations. When seeing fasting, precepts, and incense offerings, one should wish for all to daily renew their virtue and morality, with schools and teachings refined and proper.

When seeing scripture recitation, one should wish for all to fully enter the Dharma gate, hearing the wondrous teachings. When seeing scriptural teachings, one should wish for all to individually receive, read, and practice them, universally spreading transformation. When seeing towers and observatories, one should wish for all to penetrate and observe the ten directions, with nothing hidden or concealed. When seeing high mountains, one should wish for all to establish virtue like them, never regressing.

When seeing the great sea, one should wish for all to possess boundless wisdom and thought, aiding in the completion of family and state. When seeing a flourishing forest for dwelling, one should wish for all to reside in peace and ease, sheltering all beings.

When seeing the young, one should wish for all to study in a timely manner, achieving scholarly renown.

When seeing clouds and rain, one should wish for all to overflow with beneficent moisture, suiting every need. When seeing pristine snow, one should wish for all to dwell perpetually in purity, carefree and at ease. When seeing the numinous wind, one should wish for all to unfold their hidden virtues and scatter them afar, their power flowing near and far. When seeing pure water, one should wish for all to wash away filth and attain clarity, their minds made equal. When seeing fine incense, one should wish for all to receive this fragrance and purity, all defilements vanishing. When seeing lovely flowers, one should wish for all to delight in revering the sages, their marks of excellence complete. When seeing carriages and horses, one should wish for all to attain the Dao and abide in non-action, riding phoenixes and driving dragons.

When seeing alms given freely, one should wish for all to have their misfortunes extinguished in the Nine Yin, their blessings arising in the Ten Directions, their virtue vast as mountains and seas, all flourishing without fail, their seven ancestors reborn in heaven, their descendants wise and loyal, their wealth and nobility towering, all desires fulfilled, studying the Dao to become flying immortals, riding clouds and driving dragons.

Daoists, whether sitting or lying down, should constantly wish for us all: that the Four Great Elements unite in virtue, our bodies in harmony with the true Dao, eternally dwelling in the Mysterious Capital, our masters and companions natural, delivering the Ten Directions, the world receiving grace, carefree in non-action, penetrating the wondrous gate.

**Three Invocations for Scriptural Homage**

The True One’s oral instructions state: When jade lads and maidens attendant upon the scriptures hear this invocation, they rejoice and protect the practitioner’s body. All great scriptures employ this invocation in their rites of homage.

Those who reverently perform scriptural homage in meditative stillness should silently recite its words—this is the secret invocation of the highest immortals:

*"Delight in the Dharma as one’s spouse,
Cherish the scriptures as pearls and jade.
Uphold the precepts to restrain the six senses,
Contemplate the Dao to dispel desires.
Serene and unperturbed, the upright qi abides,
Detached and tranquil, the spirit still and silent.
Heavenly demons all revere and guard,
Lifetimes of great blessings received.
Flourishing are family and state,
Thriving the scriptures and the Dao.
Heaven and humanity share this vow,
Ethereally entering the Great Vehicle.
Establishing fields of blessing in the heart,
The Dharma wheel ascends in boundless ascent.
Seven ancestors reborn in celestial halls,
My body ascends at midday.
The Great Dao pervades the Mysterious Void,
With mindfulness, all is perfectly aligned.
Refining the body to join the immortals,
Attaining the vajra body.
Transcending the Three Realms’ trials,
The Five Sufferings of hell dissolved.
All return to the Most High’s scriptures,
In still contemplation, bowing in homage."*

This invocation is titled *"The Hidden Scripture of Wisdom and Daoist Conduct: The Original Vow of the Precious Precepts of the Uppermost Precepts"*—transmitted by the Most High August Sovereign of the Void to the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Lord of the Great Dao to the Lord of the Grand Tenuity, the Lord of the Grand Tenuity to the Ninefold Radiance of the Grand Realized Ones, the Grand Realized Ones to the Great Dharma Master of the Grand Ultimate, and thence to the High Immortal Duke Wang of the Grand Ultimate, never disclosed to the median immortals. After a thousand years and three transmissions, even those without their names inscribed on the Most High’s golden tablets shall never encounter these scriptural precepts. Daoists, should the time come when they receive them, must guard and uphold them in secrecy.

Ten jade lads attend the Most High, overseeing and protecting the disciples’ bodies. At times, worthy scholars and faithful men and women may not be entirely cut off from the sacred texts. On their natal days, the first day of the sexagenary cycle, the *gengshen* days, and the eight seasonal nodes, they should fast and recite the scripture once through.

The Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate said: *"To study the Dao of ascending as an immortal, one must establish one thousand two hundred acts of goodness, never receiving retribution. To establish three thousand acts of merit is to ascend to heaven in broad daylight—all such acts rescue people from mortal peril, and bestowing kindness upon them is especially virtuous. In studying the Dao, one should ensure that all conduct accords with the Dharma, broadly establishing fields of blessing, arousing the mind of great compassion, and constantly awakening the intention of the Dao in movement and stillness. Those who can do this—practicing breath refinement, consuming elixirs, wearing talismans, reciting scriptures, and cultivating focused contemplation without weariness—how could they fail to attain immortality? Those lacking such virtue, though they consume elixirs, wear talismans, recite scriptures, and observe fasts, will still meet their end without verification. Disciples, ponder these essential words."*

The Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate said: *"Establishing three hundred acts of goodness can secure long life as an earthbound immortal. If even one act is incomplete, one must begin anew, and all prior merits are lost. Only those whose thoughts constantly dwell in the heart-mind achieve this. Guiding others to do good is itself an act of goodness."*

The Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate said: *"Constantly chanting and reciting, walking while practicing great compassion, putting others before oneself, extolling goodness and transforming evil, severing all karmic ties, extinguishing thoughts and guarding emptiness, the heart like the Grand Mystery, seeking only the Dao—only then can one be said to speak of the divine immortals’ path."*

The Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate said: *"I formerly received the Ten Wholesome Exhortations and Merit-Assisting Precepts of the Grand Ultimate’s Wisdom from the Highest August Sovereign of the Void. In every lifetime, I have revered and practiced the great Dharma, making the deliverance of beings effortless—this is the natural field of blessing. The Most High, in universally teaching heaven and humanity, now grants each their original vow, enabling entry into the Dharma gate, eternal abiding in non-action, no longer subject to the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, the dissolution of karmic retribution, the cessation of hells, the Three Officials at peace, lifetimes of honor and joy, all freed from the net of entanglements, future lives secure and tranquil, the heavenly nature serene, and all wishes fulfilled. The precepts are as above, transmitted to the worthy and faithful."*

**The Ten Wholesome Exhortations state:**
1. Exhort and assist in revering the Three Treasures, supporting Dharma masters, so that in the world one becomes a noble person, virtuous, filial, and highly talented, honored and towering, respected by all, with flourishing family and clan.
   - The Three Treasures are the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters. Those who nurture life, teach goodness, and serve as models for others are called Dharma masters.
2. Exhort and assist in copying scriptures, so that in the world one becomes wise, widely learned in wondrous traces, constantly encountering sagely eras, seeing all scriptural teachings, and able to recite their passages.

**The Ten Wholesome Exhortations state further:**

3. Exhort and assist in establishing fasting retreats for quiet cultivation, so that in the world one’s family and household become exalted and noble, the body ascends to the heavens, food and sustenance arise naturally, and one constantly abides in non-action.

4. Exhort and assist in offering incense and oil to relieve the needy, so that in the world one becomes fragrant and flourishing, pure and radiant, with a majestic appearance and towering, refined bearing.

5. Exhort and assist in providing Dharma masters with ritual robes, so that in the world one becomes eternally refined, roaming freely within the Central Kingdom, never falling among borderland barbarians, with sons and daughters upright and dignified, adorned in caps and jade pendants.

6. Exhort and assist the king, parents, and the people in loyalty and filial piety, so that in the world one has many descendants, with sons and daughters wise and learned, spared from all suffering.

7. Exhort and assist in fasting, quietude, and scripture recitation, so that in the world one never falls into hell but ascends directly to the heavens, pays homage to the host of sages, swiftly regains one’s true form, and is reborn into a royal household, where all desires are fulfilled, cherished possessions are abundant, the seven generations of ancestors rejoice together, all good affinities are complete, and from beginning to end one enjoys glory and bliss. The Dharma Wheel turns in accord, and one will attain the immortal Dao.

8. Exhort and assist others in studying the scriptures, so that in the world one’s wisdom and insight become penetrating and clear, with dignified bearing in movement and stillness, and one constantly serves as a teacher to others.

9. Exhort and assist in all acts of almsgiving and admonition, so that in the world one enjoys longevity, wealth, and happiness, free from resentment and affliction.

10. Exhort and assist all people in eliminating jealousy and desire, practicing all virtues, so that in the world one lives in peace and joy, free from calamity and disorder. The sick recover on their own, officials are promoted to high rank, and one is revered by all. None fail to receive blessings, the household remains pure and noble, heavenly beings cherish and nurture them, spirits and demons respect and protect them, and they are always born in lands of fortune.

These are called the *Highest Exhortations of the Dao of Supreme Wisdom*, all drawn from the first scroll of the *Scripture of Great Wisdom*. The method was transmitted by the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, who practiced and propagated the Dao.

Those with accumulated blessings may encounter this text; they should treasure and uphold it. To recklessly show it to the unfaithful brings misfortune in this very life. After death, one becomes a lowly ghost, confined in hell, enduring the Five Sufferings, and in future lives loses the human path. Those who deface the scriptures or violate the precepts suffer the same fate.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: Among human evils, none are greater than jealousy, killing, greed, extravagance, arrogance, and lust. If even one of these dwells in the heart, it will surely cut short one’s years and lifespan. To cling to such faults while seeking to learn the immortal Dao—is this not lamentable?

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: The *Five Thousand Character Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* is the greatest of all scriptures. This Dao, therefore, pervades heaven, earth, and humanity, and all things follow it from beginning to end. The superior person who receives and recites it becomes a Celestial King of the Highest; the middling person becomes a Flying Immortal; the lesser person is reborn into the household of a Wheel-Turning Sage King, never entering hell, and always dwelling in blessed lands. When their lifespan ends, the Heavenly Emperor sends a cloud chariot to welcome their soul, which is then settled in the Hall of Fortune. The number of beings thus delivered is immeasurable—it cannot be fully described.

Once there was a woman who received and recited this scripture. Her husband constantly resented and berated her, yet she never wavered. One day, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Her husband, after death, entered hell and endured years of torment. The woman, now a flying immortal, descended to observe him and instructed him to recite the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, saying he would then be saved. At that moment, a heavenly being descended, and the Lord of Mount Tai summoned the man and questioned him. He answered in full: "I was constantly taught by my wife to revere this scripture. Now that she has ascended as an immortal, I seek deliverance out of past gratitude." The Lord said: "Though you did not originally study, you have consistently revered the Great Dao and honored the scriptures. You may now be sent to the Hall of Fortune, where your meals will be provided. After a thousand years, you will be reborn among humans and may receive and recite this scripture." The man replied: "If I am reborn into the human path, I will surely devote myself to this scripture to seek deliverance from the world." After a thousand years, he was reborn among humans. At thirteen, he began to love the *Five Thousand Character Scripture*, studied under a master, received its oral instructions, and became exceptionally wise and intelligent. Though the king invited him with honors, he declined and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. His earlier reverence for the scripture and the deliverance by his virtuous wife were due to this accumulated blessing from past lives.

Once there was a wise and enlightened Daoist who fasted in a quiet chamber but could not obtain his midday meal. A layman and laywoman, deeply devoted to the Great Dharma, were moved by the Daoist’s endurance of hunger while reciting the scriptures. Day after day, they provided his midday meal and attended his lectures. The Daoist, pitying their devotion, transmitted the scripture to the man and woman, teaching them its oral instructions. Each recited it ten thousand times. The Celestial Emperor’s dragon carriage descended to welcome them, and they ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Such examples are too numerous to record in full.

Even if one cannot study the immortal Dao, all may receive and revere the *Five Thousand Character Scripture*, thereby attaining the Dao of non-action. In this life, one preserves and extends life, the household enjoys peace, and after death, one proceeds directly to the heavens, never again imprisoned in the Three Bureaus’ hells. The key lies in sincere devotion—through this, such great blessings may be effortlessly attained.

The *Scripture of the Perfect Writs of the Great Cavern* and the *Precious Scripture of the Hidden Mysteries of the Highest Cavern* must not be transmitted to ordinary people. They are meant only for those who can study the immortal Dao and should be cultivated and recited accordingly. If lightly transmitted to the unworthy, one will be imprisoned in hell alongside seven generations of ancestors, enduring the Five Poisonous Torments. Beware, beware!

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: The delusion of worldly people is that they distance themselves from their ancestors, instead competing to serve ghosts and spirits, slaughtering living beings to seek life—how far have they strayed from true life! While alive, they do not cultivate goodness or refine the self, enduring the severing of desires. Only after death do they lavishly bury their bones, unaware that their souls have already endured the Five Poisons, imprisoned in hell, suffering the agonies of the Three Wretched Paths, and cycling through the Five Destinies.

Life in this world is brief, yet they amass wealth and treasures without end, burdening themselves with heavy loads. When blessings are exhausted and sins arrive, the body dies, the name perishes, and wealth scatters like dust before the wind.

The Daoist who observes fasts, burns incense, purifies himself, and recites scriptures performs the most noble of worldly deeds. Yet if he does not wish to witness such things, he should regard them as though unseen. When he hears the incantations of shamans and ghost-speakers, he exhausts his wealth and offers lavish gifts to them. Observing fasts in stillness and detachment brings blessings, while shamans’ songs and dances summon misfortune. When misfortune strikes, both their souls and ours endure trials and punishments, with calamities unending, shuttling through the Three Wretched Paths—suffering from which escape is nearly impossible. Once the retribution is complete, they may be reborn as one of the Six Livestock, deprived of the human Way. Even if they return to the human realm, they will be born into lowly stations, some with incomplete faculties, others with hideous forms, their bodies foul and rank, whether male or female—stubborn, foolish, and despised, cast aside by all, drifting through the world in destitution until death from hunger and cold. Such people all bear the karmic consequences of past lives, having come from the Six Livestock before barely regaining the human Way.

Yet if in this life they endure hardship and willingly embrace poverty, repenting past wrongs and striving to cultivate the future, seeking to uphold the Dharma to liberate themselves, they will gradually witness retribution in this world, and in the next life receive great blessings. They will be born into the families of the wealthy, noble, or royal, their features perfect, their appearance dignified and majestic, radiant and resplendent, delighting all who behold them. They will be kind, benevolent, trustworthy, and virtuous, endowed with great talent and grand vision. Whether they desire sons or daughters, it shall be as their original vow dictates. They will encounter good companions, forming karmic connections and affinities, naturally meeting in the unseen realm, becoming brothers and descendants to one another. Thus, generation after generation, they will be wise and filial, perpetually reborn in succession, never to be cut off.

Thus it is said: "Interdependence of fortune and misfortune—who can fathom its limits?" This is what is meant by "descendants maintaining unbroken ancestral sacrifices." The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate said: The Dao of the Mysterious and the White—ancients who cultivated it prolonged their years and extended their lives, attaining longevity. Yet those who practice it today diminish their years and shorten their lives, hastening their deaths. Can one blame the arts? The fault lies with oneself—is this not lamentable?

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate said: For one who studies the Dao, first be filial to parents, loyal to one’s lord, compassionate to subordinates, and trustworthy to friends. Let your words be irreproachable, admonish evil and praise good, free from partiality or self-interest, and without violating external teachings—thus fulfilling the human Dao. Next, abstain from wine, sensual pleasures, jealousy, killing, extravagance, greed, arrogance, and indolence. Then, sever the Five Pungents, fatty meats, and rich flavors. Next, let thoughts and contemplation merge, and the mind become pure and empty. Then, consume restorative roots, uphold the great precepts, cultivate steadfast resolve, practice embryonic breathing and guiding-and-pulling, harmonize inhalation and saliva, accumulate merit, endure what others cannot endure, relinquish what others cannot relinquish, do what others cannot do, dwell where others cannot dwell, wear what others cannot wear, eat what others cannot eat, uphold what others cannot uphold, and study what others cannot study. Only when the Dao is practiced thus may one be stabilized with numinous medicines, partake of cloud sprouts, cause corpse worms to sink and decay, dissolve impurities, and purify the Three Palaces, so the Five Viscera may rest in tranquility. Then, with prolonged fasting and deep contemplation, silently recite the cavernous scriptures, savor their wondrous flavors, and refine the elixir. Can one who does so fail to attain the Dao of ascending as an immortal?

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate: If one does not cultivate the human Dao, is disloyal to lord and kin, indulges in wine and sensuality, kills and plunders, is arrogant and self-indulgent, deceives and misleads the worthy, borrows without repayment—if in youth one acts thus, and in maturity cannot reform, allowing the heart to remain untroubled, yet desires to embrace fasting and study the Dao, hoping for the ascent of a flying immortal—is this not pitiable? Is this not pitiable? Such a person will long dwell in hell, tread the Five Poisons, climb mountains of knives and forests of swords, endure boiling cauldrons and scorching flames, be steeped in searing torment, unable even to die. Hungry, they will eat iron; thirsty, they will drink fire. Emerging, they will face freezing ice, their flesh cut to the bone. Only then will they be handed over to the Three Officials, exiled to labor in mountains and seas, bearing loads of earth and stone, whipped and interrogated, enduring the Three Paths and Five Ways, traversing the Ten Sufferings and Eight Hardships—agonies beyond measure, inexpressible in full.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate said: Such a person is not even equal to an ordinary scholar who practices benevolence and righteousness, reveres and trusts the Dao and virtue, and follows only what is good. Though subject to the transformations of time and change, they wander freely within the world, pure and at ease. When their lives end, they enter the abodes of blessings, avoiding imprisonment, and may become spirits. Reborn in the human realm, they do not lose their original vow, gradually deepen their roots of faith, form affinities with the worthy and sagely, and day by day shed their impurities, ultimately entering the immortal Dao.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate said: The peril is that one attains the human Dao yet does not cultivate virtue and nurture nature to preserve life. The peril is hearing the scriptures yet not believing them. The peril is believing the scriptures yet coveting wealth and refusing them. The peril is receiving the scriptures yet not reciting and expounding them. The peril is reciting and expounding them yet not practicing their teachings. The peril is practicing their teachings yet not persevering in the Dao. The peril is serving a master yet not remaining devoted for life. The peril is taking medicines yet not attaining the proper cessation of breath. The peril is the Dao not being fully realized yet boasting of ascending and soaring. The peril is practicing silent fasting and reading scriptures yet dwelling in secluded mountains and being unable to endure the hardship. These ten perils reside within a person—if not guarded against, the body will find no remedy. Thus it is said: "The great peril is that I have a body." This is what is meant—can one not reflect upon it? Can one not reflect upon it?

When the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate had finished transmitting the scriptures, expounding the Dharma, and teaching the precepts, he sang of the sufferings of the Three Paths and Five Ways, sighing these words:

The Three Powers and the myriad things,
Each depend on their allotted span.
Beginning and end await the kalpa’s reckoning,
When blessings are exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.
Traversing the Five Ways,
How bitter to die and be reborn again.
Revolving through the Three Paths,
Coming and going with calamity.
Great worthies, heed these precepts,
Endure your nature, relinquish your passions.
Foolish men do not believe the Dharma,
Their sins and pains ever cling to them.
I grieve that the world has no end,
And so now I declare it anew:
If you wish to escape these perils,
Take refuge in the scriptures of the Most High.
Sin and blessing do not come from another—
Truly, they arise from your own body.
Thus the great worthy seals his lips,
Seeking to sever all evil affinities.
Extinguish thoughts, return to dual forgetting,
Await the long dissolution of interdependence.
Propagate the Dao to pacify the world,
And in the end, you will behold the True One.
Lust and jealousy are the roots of misfortune,
The greatest perils to life.
To harbor and nurture such types—
I fear they will surely meet early ruin.
Knowing evil yet not reforming—
How can this be the Dao’s peace?
Holding poison while fasting upright,
It makes me sigh deeply.
Karma from past lives is indeed real,
Yet the weak and short-lived call it nonexistent.
All desire to see it before their eyes,
But once it passes, they call it remote.
Great worthies, illumine the Dao’s teachings,
Grieving for the stubborn and foolish.
Tenderly, I think of their suffering,
Diligently, I cause myself sorrow.
A person’s life is already spent,
Like a flame in oil.
The Four Great are but a temporary meeting,
The Five Agents a provisional borrowing.
In the prime of life, study diligently,
Seek to preserve what is yours.
When blessings are exhausted, body and spirit scatter,
And in darkness, descend to hell.

The highest sages, in awe of this, sought the Dao to transcend such calamity. The urgent path is to practice immortality and uphold the precepts to restrain the heart’s passions. In emptiness and purity, the upright qi resides, and immortals and sages naturally seek one another. If you do not believe these teachings, why dwell in the mountains and forests?

Great worthies delight in the scriptures and precepts, receiving them as treasures for the body. To pursue study is ever lamented as too late; to cultivate the self is ever regretted as too slow. By the time one unravels the profound and obscure, in a flash, the years have grown old. Clutching the scrolls to the end, one will only meet death with bitter sorrow.

Thus, in my youthful years, I abandoned the world to study the Dao. The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One said: "When I once studied the Dao, I received it from the Supreme Lord of the Void and Sovereign. Practicing it with devotion, I became a Perfected One. If a Daoist wishes to receive my Great Precepts, the master should first read them once to reveal their essence. Only those who are truly students of immortality should come bearing sincerity to the master’s gate. After fasting and purifying for three days, contemplating the Dao and reflecting on the precepts, they may then be transmitted. These precepts are of utmost gravity—each is guarded by mighty spirit-deities. Be cautious, be cautious!

The Immortal Lord said: "These Great Precepts are bestowed upon Daoist students of immortality. Diligently seek what is extraordinary in the world, for all things shall return to emptiness. All is Dharma, through which one may ascend beyond the sufferings of the Three Paths and attain the Dao. Those who encounter this are fulfilling their past vows. Receive it and follow it; do not fail to cultivate it diligently."

On the first day of the new year, the Immortal Lord received the precepts and composed this hymn:

In the secluded mountains, still and desolate,
I gaze upon towering cliffs, steep and sheer.
Pristine snow veils the front courtyard,
While fierce winds howl through the eastern grove.
Before the Heavenly Worthy, I linger in reverence,
Immersed in the profound, my cares dissolve.
Pitying those who fall into sin,
My heart cannot shake this sorrow.
Turning from scriptures and precepts to trust in demonic illusions,
Abandoning fasting and stillness for the allure of wine and song—
They cycle through the Five Paths and Three Realms,
Passing through the dark depths of hell.
Such suffering is beyond words,
Yet they endure death and rebirth, unable to bear it.
Only the Dao and virtue can save beings—
Why wait until distressed before seeking them?

The Immortal Lord addressed his disciple Zheng Siyuan: "In my youth, I wandered through famous mountains, traversing perilous paths, living among birds and beasts. I endured every hardship, suppressed my desires, cast aside worldly thoughts, and practiced generosity with restraint. Later, I was reborn as a human, embraced the Dao, and brought peace to the world. I constantly cultivated compassion, cherished the Dao, and preserved truth, never daring to neglect it. After fasting and purifying for a year without completion, on the winter solstice, the Heavenly Perfected descended and bestowed upon me the Great Scripture and the Way of the Upper Immortals. The Heavenly Perfected commanded me to undertake a great fast in profound stillness, reciting and studying the scriptures in sequence. Thus, I became a Perfected One.

The scriptures and Dao I once received are treasured by the Supreme Lord, not the teachings of middling immortals. Through countless kalpas, they have been transmitted to Upper Immortals—Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, and Immortal Ministers—not only to me. My past lives and yours shared this vow. By performing good deeds and accumulating merit without ceasing, we attained immortal names in the Dark Capital. Now, as teacher and friend, I transmit this to you.

After I depart this world, there will be those who delight in the Dao, whose hearts are kind and compassionate, and who are born into my lineage. You must pass on all the teachings and practices I have imparted to them, for it is destined that these be recorded and transmitted through the ages. This is due to the karmic bonds and affinities we shared in past lives. Transmit one copy in accordance with the regulations to a worthy disciple. If no such person exists, seal one copy and entrust it to the Five Sacred Mountains.

These are the oral instructions of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One. Keep them secret, be cautious, be ever cautious, and reflect on them always."

Here ends the *Supreme Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue: The Great Precepts of Original Vows and Wisdom, Upper Grade*.

The master of the Dao (Dunhuang manuscript: "nun"; likely altered by Buddhist followers) attains the Way of non-action (Dunhuang manuscript: "attains the Way like the Buddha"). Through tranquil observation (Dunhuang manuscript: "tranquil temple"), all enter the gateway of the Dao (Dunhuang manuscript: "all ascend the high seat"). Universally practicing (Dunhuang manuscript: "universally seeing"; closer to the original), they follow the lineage of their masters (Dunhuang manuscript: "Confucian lineage"). Not committing transgressions from beginning to end, they ultimately attain freedom from error (Dunhuang manuscript: "not initiating transgressions, ultimately entering non-action"). As for hunting and fishing (Dunhuang manuscript: "fishing and hunting"), those who attain birth (Dunhuang manuscript: "guest kings"; closer to the original) in border regions (Dunhuang manuscript: "borderlands") study fame (Dunhuang manuscript: "flourishing command"). Receiving this fragrant admonition (Dunhuang manuscript: "receiving this fragrant and flourishing form"), they praise the Dao (Dunhuang manuscript: "revere and speak of it"). Their (Dunhuang manuscript: "their time"; closer to the original) connection (Dunhuang manuscript: "opening"; closer to the original) to the teachings is such that they follow and attend (Dunhuang manuscript: "follow and transmit") with constant mindfulness and recitation (Dunhuang manuscript: "constant mindfulness, fasting, laughter, and recitation").

When first entering the gateway of the Dao (Dunhuang manuscript: "wondrously entering the gateway of the Way"), they cultivate tranquility (Dunhuang manuscript: "tranquil temple"). Forsaking worldly attachments (Dunhuang manuscript: "worldly adornments"), they turn the Wheel of the Dao (Dunhuang manuscript: "turning wheel"). With it (Dunhuang manuscript: "and"; emended from "and" to "with" per the Dunhuang manuscript), they harmonize (Dunhuang manuscript: "cooperate") the turning wheel (Dunhuang manuscript omits the interpolated "birth" character). Thus, they attain boundless (Dunhuang manuscript: "boundless"; emended from "innumerable" to "boundless") blessings. Always (Dunhuang manuscript: "once") responding fully (Dunhuang manuscript: "speaking fully"), they address the customs of their time, whether male or female (Dunhuang manuscript: "the men of their clans"; "clan" is likely the correct reading over "customs"). They uphold the scriptures (the character "scripture" is supplied from the Dunhuang manuscript) and avoid lavish burials (Dunhuang manuscript: "lavish burials"; emended from "funeral burials"). They recognize the difficulty of liberation (Dunhuang manuscript: "difficulty of explanation") and do not refuse (Dunhuang manuscript: "do not yield").

The text omits the characters "Supreme Ultimate" (per the Dunhuang manuscript). With it (the character "with" is supplied from the Dunhuang manuscript), one may sever yet cannot be severed, study yet cannot be studied. The Three Palaces are purified (Dunhuang manuscript: "The Three Offices are harmonized"; closer to the original). The Heavenly Worthy addresses (the Dunhuang manuscript omits "the Heavenly Worthy addresses the Supreme Ultimate"). Ordinary people (Dunhuang manuscript: "ordinary worthies") practice benevolence and righteousness (Dunhuang manuscript: "the human Way"). The Dao and its virtue (Dunhuang manuscript: "the Dao and the scriptures"; closer to the original) are thus (the character "thus" is supplied from the Dunhuang manuscript). For I possess a body (Dunhuang manuscript: "and my body"), they harm (Dunhuang manuscript: "harm") me. Then (emended from "and" to "then" per the Dunhuang manuscript), demonic forces (emended from "demonic forces" per the Dunhuang manuscript) arise. How (the interpolated character "more" is deleted per the Dunhuang manuscript) could this not be so?
