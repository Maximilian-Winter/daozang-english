The Primordial Great Sage, illuminating the profound and subtle, sun and moon equally bright, the Three Treasures shining together, once cultivated pure conduct, ceaselessly liberating beings, eternally separating from the Three Wretched Realms, and fully dissolving the Five Sufferings—this is called the Dharma Wheel of Flying Heaven.

With sincerity move the Supreme Darkness.

The self attains the Upper Clarity.

Surplus food bestowed upon all beings.

What day is today?
A day of fasting, facing the Most High.
Partaking of the celestial kitchen’s fare,
Commanding this month’s celestial generals.
May you ascend to the Southern Immortals,
The host’s blessings immeasurable.
Burning incense, offering utmost sincerity,
Merit and virtue universally perfected.

The great ritual of vows to the four directions, as I have now expounded—if practiced with utmost sincerity, its blessings shall be boundless. Guard these precepts well.
