The Supreme Great Dao Lord, together with the Five Elder Thearchs, the Limitless Flying Heavenly Great Saints, the Supreme Lofty Perfected, the Ten Poles’ Perfected Ones, the Left Mystery Perfected One, the Right Mystery Perfected One, the Wondrous Conduct Perfected One, the Universal Salvation Perfected One, the Life-Granting Perfected One, the Distress-Relieving Perfected One, the Suffering-Saving Perfected One, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected One, the Great Compassionate and Great Wise Perfected One, the Orthodox Unity Emperor Lord, the various Great Celestial Masters, the Vajra Divine Kings, the Valiant Ones, the Heavenly Dragons, and the ghosts and spirits—all these, in the World of Abandoned Worthies, by means of their divine penetrations, suddenly transformed countless crimson jade thrones, radiant and resplendent. The host of perfected and sagely beings arrayed themselves upon them.

At that time, the Dao Lord ascended a seven-jeweled lion throne, adorned with miscellaneous treasures: lapis lazuli, true pearls, fire pearls, bright moon pearls, agate, coral, amber, red jade, white jade, azure jade, green jade, yellow jade, glass, yellow gold, purple gold, azure-fire gold, and fragrant sandalwood. Upon this throne, a hundred-jeweled lotus spontaneously bloomed, its thousand-petaled layers each revealing the pure lands of the ten directions, all perfectly complete.

Within the assembly stood a great seven-jeweled kalpa-vṛkṣa grove, its delicate leaves intertwined, its fragrance thick and boundless, its height and breadth unfathomable. A gentle breeze stirred, producing subtle and wondrous sounds. Amidst this, celestial music of every kind flew and transformed, playing without being struck.

Then the Dao Lord, seated upon the lotus dais, assumed the full-lotus posture, emitting from his body five-colored radiance that illuminated the boundless celestial realms. The sagely host in the void circled in celestial steps, singing hymns of praise. Instantly, the heavens rained fragrant blossoms: great and small wondrous true flowers, red-gold flame flowers, purple-gold flame flowers, phoenix-crest fire flowers, and dense-fragrance fire flowers. Wondrous garments and precious fruits, white cranes, phoenixes, auspicious parrots, green luan birds, peacocks, great benevolent golden birds, luminous golden birds, mindful-of-the-Dao golden birds, human-speech golden birds, and joyous-sound golden birds—all carried rare blossoms, soaring above the assembly.

Then the divine immortals of the ten directions—flying immortals, celestial immortals, terrestrial immortals, aquatic immortals, fire immortals, the immortals of the Five Marchmounts, and all the great and small immortals of the various grotto-heavens—each held talismans and staffs, banners and canopies, jeweled pennants, singing hymns of praise, chanting numinous verses, and offering grand wondrous music in homage to the Dao Lord. At that moment, the great earth trembled, and all in the assembly gazed upon one another in awe, their wonder beyond measure.

A perfected one named Universal Salvation arose from the crowd, adjusted his robes and headscarf, and with dignified and graceful steps, approached the Dao Lord. Bowing deeply, he prostrated himself and addressed the Dao Lord: "This humble servant, dull and ignorant, cannot fathom by what fruition of the Dao the Dao Lord has attained such divine penetrations and sovereign ease, equal to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. I humbly beseech you to take pity on this humble servant, the sentient beings of future kalpas, and the later generations of Daoist disciples. Expound this principle, that we may awaken to the profound essentials of the Dharma, ascend to the supreme Dao, and attain inconceivable fruition. This would be this servant’s great fortune."

The Dao Lord, hearing Universal Salvation’s words, sighed and said: "Excellent, excellent! You possess the great wisdom of past karmic roots, able to proclaim this wondrous Dharma for the sentient beings of future defiled kalpas. You may retain this in your thoughts, for I shall explain these causes and conditions to you. For countless kalpas, I have contemplated the ten titles’ meritorious virtues of my original teacher, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, chanting and praising them, inscribing and adorning them with images, and meditating upon the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. I have paid homage, made offerings, and revered him, bestowing countless pearls and gold without stinginess, never once growing weary or negligent, and thus have accomplished this merit today."

Universal Salvation again addressed the Dao Lord: "I humbly inquire: what are the ten titles of the Primordial Great Sage Heavenly Worthy? May this humble servant and the assembly hear them? I and the host of perfected immortals wish to chant and praise them." Having spoken, he bowed his head, prostrated himself, and wept, gazing up at the Dao Lord. The entire assembly fell silent, their thoughts turned inward, reverently awaiting the revelation.

The Dao Lord’s countenance brightened with a gentle smile as he told Universal Salvation: "You must listen with single-minded focus, that you may attain the supreme Dao’s fruition."

The Dao Lord then said to Universal Salvation: "My original teacher, the Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Worthy, is the embodiment of the wondrous Dao, spontaneously arisen from emptiness and non-being. Since time immemorial, beyond measure like the sands of the Ganges, he has delivered all sentient beings into the supreme Dao, possessing seventy-two marks, eighty-one excellences, and ten titles fully perfected. At times, he manifests a thousand rays of light; at others, a boundless form; now a vast body, now a minute one; or transforms his body to enter a grain of millet. He may open his pores to contain boundless worlds, or hold the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds in his palm. He rains sweet dew to cool the afflictions of suffering beings, or appears as a sovereign to quell violence and disorder. As a wise minister, he assists the virtuous; as a sagely ruler, he descends to become a teacher. Such are his meritorious virtues, divine penetrations, and wondrous marks—inexhaustible in praise. Thus, he bears ten titles, which summarize his names of glory. These ten titles are: *Supreme Dao*, *Primordial Beginning*, *Great Ultimate*, *Lofty August*, *Luminous*, *Jade Emperor*, *King of Orthodox Dharma*, *Great Compassionate Father*, *Teacher of Immortals and Perfected*, and *Heavenly Worthy*."

Universal Salvation again addressed the Dao Lord: "Though this humble servant has heard the ten titles’ meritorious virtues, I do not yet understand their explanations. May you expound them, that I, the great assembly, and even the sentient beings of future defiled kalpas may fully awaken to the essentials of the supreme truth?"

May this humble servant beseech your compassion and grace to expound, one by one, the subtle and wondrous virtues, practices, and manifestations of the ten titles. Such would be this servant’s great fortune.

The Dao Lord again addressed Universal Salvation, saying: "The ten titles were spoken when the host of perfected sages and heavenly beings, together with the Heavenly Perfected Sovereigns, opened the hundred-jeweled casket within the White Jade Palace of the Crimson Bright Harmony Yang Heaven. There, upon the wind-suspended brocade pedestal, the hidden speech of Great Brahmā was translated into the orthodox tongue.

The title *Supreme Dao* refers to the moment when the Primordial Heavenly Worthy attained the fruit of the Dao. Among all dharmas, it has no ancestor, no lineage, no root, no attachment—yet in an instant, it stands alone as the one form. It is the refuge of the ten thousand dharmas, the king of the ten thousand dharmas, the ancestor of the ten thousand forms, the inception of the one qi. Profound and unfathomable, how could the primordial darkness comprehend it? It abides before all multitudes, and thus is called *Supreme Dao*.

*Primordial Beginning* signifies dwelling at the source of the supreme Dao, serving as the origin of the profound and obscure. Hence, it is called *Primordial Beginning*.

*Great Ultimate* refers to the moment when, after countless kalpas, at the division of the primordial simplicity, the reward-body manifested. It was then that the transformation-body appeared in the Azure Heaven of the Beginning, and thus it is named *Great Ultimate*.

The title *Lofty August* denotes its exalted abode in the Heaven Without Summit, roaming above the Great Net of Heaven. It is named *the Supreme of the Supreme*, surpassing all forms, and thus is called *Lofty August*.

*Luminous* signifies that the true essence of the Dharma-nature shines like lapis lazuli. Its virtue-light is effortless, illuminating the darkest places, dissolving the obstructions of sentient beings, and shattering the mountain of afflictions. Hence, it is called *Luminous*.

*Jade Emperor* indicates its station within the Jade Palace, the supreme sovereign of the ten thousand heavens. Its true nature is serene, its wondrous marks complete. Majestic and boundless, it emerges from among the host of perfected beings, like stars encircling the moon. Thus, it is called *Jade Emperor*.

*King of Orthodox Dharma* refers to one who expounds the orthodox Dharma, refutes heterodox sects, reveals the Dao of non-action, extinguishes all suffering, and clarifies the boundless Dharma-gates. It seals the scriptures and registers of the Three Heavens, subdues demons and evil, eradicates petty views, and guides beings into the Great Vehicle. Like the great physician-king, it dispenses the medicine of Dharma to cure suffering. Like the thunder of spring, it awakens and activates the sprouts, nourishing all living things. Like the sweet dew-rain, it moistens and nurtures the roots and natures of beings. Thus, it is called *King of Orthodox Dharma*.

*Great Compassionate Father* signifies that, for measureless and boundless kalpas—kalpas as numerous as the dust-motes of the cosmos—the great sagely body has manifested to deliver sentient beings, liberating them from the net of birth and death and leading them into the true and real Dao. Even in the evil destinies, it rescues suffering beings with a love surpassing that for an only child. Thus, it is called *Great Compassionate Father*.

*Teacher of Immortals and Perfected*:
The Dao Lord addressed Universal Salvation, saying: 'From time without beginning, I, together with you and the boundless multitudes of kalpas, the Heavenly Worthies, great sages, and perfected immortals, have ascended to the fruit of the Supreme Dao. All Heavenly Worthies, the host of perfected sages, heavenly kings, heavenly emperors, the Jade Emperor, the Great Emperor, the Three Flower Emperors, the Five Emperors, the Great Demons, the grotto-heavens of the sacred mountains, the empty space between heaven and earth, the water and land realms—all living beings, whether they have already attained the fruit, are attaining it now, or have yet to attain it—are all my original teacher, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Manifesting the empty and originless Dharma-body, the spontaneous reward-body, and the Primordial transformation-body, I employ the truth-realm Dharma in myriad forms of guidance, expounding the thirty-six sacred scriptures.

At times in the forests and springs of the sacred mountains and peaks, or in the great and lesser grotto-heavens; at times within the thirty-six heavens, or in the palaces of the thirty-two emperors; at times in the Great Net of the Three Purities or in boundless realms; or in foreign lands and all places where living beings gather—wherever there is form and appearance, I observe their faculties, adapt my speech, and manifest transformations to guide them. Those not yet delivered, I vow to deliver. Those not yet attaining the Dao, I vow to enable them to attain it. Those not yet at peace, I vow to bring them peace. Those not yet liberated, I vow to liberate them. Those not yet ascending to the Mystery, I vow to lead them to ascend. With this vast vow, I open and guide all, expounding the essential arts of the Three Caverns, the wondrous texts of the Great Treasury, the celestial books of jade characters, and the golden treasures of secret scriptures—all are fully possessed.

Though the transmitted Dharma is boundless, I summarize and circulate it into twelve categories, distinguishing them according to the differing faculties of beings, so that all sentient beings may each return to their proper path and awaken to the orthodox Dharma.

The first is *Original Texts*; the second, *Divine Talismans*; the third, *Precious Oral Instructions*; the fourth, *Sacred Diagrams*; the fifth, *Registers and Genealogies*; the sixth, *Precepts and Vinaya*; the seventh, *Ritual Observances*; the eighth, *Methods and Techniques*; the ninth, *Numerology and Calculations*; the tenth, *Records and Biographies*; the eleventh, *Hymns and Chants*; and the twelfth, *Petitions and Memorials*.

Possessing such wisdom, I open such Dharma-gates to guide and lead the sentient beings of the defiled kalpas, regarding them as my own children. Yet if these children themselves remain unenlightened, though I spread such great compassion and cast the net of loving-kindness, beings remain entangled in the snares of sound and form, bound by manifold attachments. They wander through the Three Realms, never returning to the true path, clinging only to perverse views. Yet when they encounter the transformative and guiding Dharma of the Heavenly Worthy, all are awakened. From kalpas past, I have tirelessly saved beings from suffering. Thus, I am called *Teacher of Immortals and Perfected*.'

Universal Salvation addressed the Dao Lord, saying: 'This humble servant does not yet understand how the twelve categories of Dharma, with their wondrous principles and essential teachings, transform beings. Like the great Dharma-rain, they fill each vessel according to its capacity, altering the faculties of sentient beings. I do not yet comprehend these subtle and wondrous principles. I beseech you to expound them that I may awaken to their meaning. Such would be this servant’s great fortune.'

The Dao Lord addressed Universal Salvation, saying: 'The first, *Original Texts*, refers to the celestial writings of the Eight Assemblies—phoenix-script and dragon-chapters—which are the root of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things. They open and transform humans and spirits, establish all dharmas, summon the divine immortals and emperors of the Nine Heavens, verify and determine the registers and charts, regulate the celestial mechanisms, command the Fengdu underworld, subdue demons and ghosts, issue decrees to the Water Emperor, summon dragons to halt the clouds, determine the kalpas of heaven and earth, record the names of the sagely and perfected, designate the terraces and cities they govern, and delineate the realms of the host of sages. They broadly proclaim and distinguish all matters, each according to its kind. They expound the wondrous methods of refining the original essence to transform the body, all made clear and complete.'"

The second, **Divine Talismans**, are the scripts of cloud-seals, the pledges of the divine perfected. They summon and command the host of demons, awe and govern spirits and ghosts, master qi to direct the workings of destiny, and preserve life to extend the years.

The third, **Precious Oral Instructions**, are the explanations of the Heavenly Writ of Eightfold Assemblies by the celestial perfected and supreme sages, establishing the correct pronunciation to reveal and behold the Great Dao.

The fourth, **Numinous Charts**, depict the transformative traces of the host of sages, manifesting without fixed form. They illustrate and adapt these transformations to awaken understanding in all beings.

The fifth, **Registers and Genealogies**, record the names and titles of the immortal perfected, their ancestral origins and lineages, and the ranks and successions of the divine officials.

The sixth, **Precepts and Disciplines**, set forth regulations and decrees, prevent wrongdoing and examine transgressions, weigh sins and blessings, and distinguish their gravity.

The seventh, **Ritual Demeanor**, provides models for the proper conduct of fasts and retreats, the measured movements of bowing and rising, and the standards for posture and bearing.

The eighth, **Methods and Techniques**, comprise the writings of the sages on the secrets of elixirs and medicines, divine herbs and numinous fungi, malleable gold, flowing water, and jade—the Dao of cultivation and refinement.

The ninth, **Protective Practices**, clarify the contemplation of spirits, the preservation of the true and the recollection of the Dao, the fasting of the heart and the forgetting of the void, the wandering of empty space and the flying steps, the ingestion of the six qi and the guiding of the three luminaries, the refinement of the body to transform the form—the methods of immortal transcendence.

The tenth, **Transmitted Records**, are the accounts of the sages documenting their studies, the attainment of the Dao and perfection of the true, the penetration of the mysterious and entry into the wondrous, the places of cultivation and the causes of practice, and the times of verification and fruition.

The eleventh, **Hymns and Eulogies**, are the artfully adorned words of the divine perfected and great sages, extolling the true Dao, inspiring faith and joy in all beings, arousing dedication and reverence, and generating a mind of veneration.

The twelfth, **Chapters and Memorials**, are the transmissions between master and disciple of wondrous treasures and rare texts, the oaths and pledges made at the altars during the Three Primes and Eight Nodes, the vows of transmission and initiation, the repentances and petitions for blessings, and the petitions and announcements.

These twelve divisions fully manifest the true Dao, and every aspect of their meaning is complete and without omission. They transform and guide the Three Vehicles to verify the supreme Dao.

Our Great Sage and Original Teacher, titled the **Celestial Worthy**, constantly abides above the Three Clarities, transcending the realms of the host of sages. Manifesting in the humble world, he alone dwells in heaven as the most exalted, hence the title Celestial Worthy. These are the ten titles and virtues of the **Original Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning**, the wondrous purport of the Dharma gate.

The Dao Lord further addressed Universal Salvation, saying: "If, in the future, beings of the impure kalpa hear of the causal virtues of the ten titles of our Original Teacher, the Great Sage, the Original Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, and are further able to depict and cast his image, chant hymns and eulogies, bow in reverence, and expound this Dharma, then their nine generations of ancestors will ascend to heaven, their karmic obstructions will be extinguished, and they themselves will attain the Dao of long life and immortality. Their households will be peaceful, their descendants flourishing, and generation after generation, they will encounter the Dao and avoid misfortune and calamity. If one copies and cultivates this scripture, the merit will be immeasurable."

After expounding the virtues of these ten titles, all the great assembly present advanced in their immortal ranks, transcended to sagehood, and fully awakened to the fruit of the supreme, true, and perfect Dao.

The Perfected of Universal Salvation verified the exalted title of **Celestial Worthy Who Saves from Suffering at the Sound [of Prayer]**. He possessed the eighty-one excellences and seventy-two marks, his ten titles complete, his radiance luminous and translucent. From the void came the praise: "Universal Salvation, through such petitioning and meritorious deeds, is inconceivable, his wisdom unfathomable. In future ages, he shall be the king among Dao teachers for all beings, the great eye of the Dharma, differing not in spiritual penetration from the Dao Lord."

Thereupon, all the assembled beings who heard this essential Dharma escaped the suffering of birth and death and awakened to the true and perfect Dao.

Then, by the divine power of the Dao Lord, Universal Salvation, desiring to ascend to the Three Heavens, intoned this eulogy:

"The Dao Lord, greatly compassionate,
From his golden mouth expounds the true treasury.
The ten titles now heard
Enable me to verify the true Dao.
I bow to the teacher of non-action,
A thousand lights, a form complete in marks."

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture on the Causal Virtues of the Ten Titles of the Supreme Perfection of the Numinous Treasure of the Highest Cavern*.
