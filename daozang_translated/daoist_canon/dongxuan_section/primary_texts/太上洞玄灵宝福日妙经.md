The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "Good men and good women, if you wish to avoid falling into manifold calamities across the three times—past, present, and future—devoutly receive and uphold this sutra, and on all auspicious days perform good deeds and establish merit. You shall enjoy peace in this life and, upon the end of your years, ascend to the heavens as an immortal."

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months are the months of the Great Fast. Those who complete the fast in these months shall attain transcendence in this very body, their households shall flourish in well-being, and their seven generations of ancestors shall dwell in non-action."

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "The seventh day of the first month is the Celestial Bureau’s Reward Assembly. The seventh day of the seventh month is the Earth Prison’s Liberation Assembly. The fifth day of the tenth month is the Water Palace’s Life-Granting Assembly. These three assemblies are most auspicious. Those who observe the Great Fast on these days shall ensure their household remains untouched by pestilential qi for ten thousand kalpas."

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "The fifteenth day of the first month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month are the Three Yuan Fast Days. Those who observe the Great Fast on these days shall prolong their lifespan, increase their years, and be spared from all suffering."

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "The first day of the first month is the Heavenly La. The fifth day of the fifth month is the Earthly La. The seventh day of the seventh month is the Dao and Virtue La. The first day of the tenth month is the People’s Year La. When the twelfth month coincides with La, it is the Kings and Lords’ La. On the first and fifteenth days of every month, the days of *jiazi*, one’s own life-day, and *gengshen* days, those who observe the Great Fast, recite, and chant the scriptures shall have all their wishes fulfilled."

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of every month are the Ten Upright Days. Those who observe the Great Fast on these days shall receive blessings in life and death and enjoy peace for ten thousand kalpas."

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "The Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, and Winter Solstice are the Eight Seasonal Fast Days. Practicing the Dao, upholding the precepts, observing the Great Fast, and reciting the scriptures shall bring joy to your household and delight to your seven generations of ancestors."

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "Those who observe the Great Fast on auspicious days shall be free from misfortune for ten thousand kalpas and enjoy peace in this life. Furthermore, if one copies this sutra ten times, ten thousand kalpas of transgressions shall be eradicated. One hundred copies shall invoke the protection of demon kings. One thousand copies shall enable flight, and all malevolent spirits, specters, and the five kinds of pestilence shall not cross your threshold. Benevolent spirits of the locale shall constantly bring benefit, and sins from past and present kalpas shall all be extinguished. Those who copy and uphold this sutra for the sake of good people shall receive boundless blessings in return."

"If one faces peril in battle, encounters tigers, wolves, venomous creatures, or grudges, confronts hostile armies, endures childbirth, or suffers from wind, waves, bandits, or any illness, or is nearing the end of life—reciting this sutra shall summon flying immortals and transcendent sages to swiftly come to their aid, instantly liberating them and fulfilling all wishes."

"This sutra is the fundamental text upheld by the most exalted perfected beings, the root of attaining the Dao. If one encounters this sutra, receives, upholds, recites, and chants it, none shall fail to transcend the world. Without encountering this sutra, there is no means to attain the Dao."

Upon hearing these words, the assembly bowed their heads, paid homage, and expressed gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy, faithfully receiving and putting them into practice.
