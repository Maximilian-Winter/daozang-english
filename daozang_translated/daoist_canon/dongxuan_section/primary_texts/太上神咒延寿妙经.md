**The Supreme Divine Incantation Sutra for Prolonging Life**

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning bestowed salvation, prolonged lifespan, and delivered beings from the afflictions of bodily illness and suffering. Then, the Dao Lord knelt in reverence, bowed his head, and with single-minded devotion dispelled chaos, causing all evils to vanish.

*"General Jiazi, grant me the tally of extended years.
May the Celestial Worthy’s vow be fulfilled—
Swiftly answering cries for aid, prolonging life’s allotted span.
Unceasing through the ages, circulating without hindrance."*

The talisman shatters the Five Depletions and Six Exhaustions, dispels malevolent dreams and harm, and severs curses. Should one receive and uphold this sutra, no harm shall befall them, and the talisman shall safeguard them for a hundred years. For those beset by yearly, monthly, daily, or hourly calamities, upon wearing the talisman, all misfortunes and taboos shall cease.

Should one receive this sutra, it shall extend their years, prolong their lifespan, transcend disasters, and redeem their allotted time from the ledgers of death. Their name shall be inscribed in the Hall of Literary Florescence among the registers of the living. On the Six Fasts and Ten Days of Abstinence, the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, their life’s eight nodal points, reciting this sutra shall purify their ethereal and corporeal souls, restore white hair to black, and stabilize body and mind, fulfilling all wishes.

Across the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Nine Jiang and Eight Poles, all perfected beings, jade lads and maidens, deities of the Three Realms, officials of the Three Bureaus and Nine Offices, and all divine spirits—upon hearing and upholding this sutra—shall have all suffering and afflictions dispelled, along with boundless grave transgressions: disrespect toward masters, defilement of the Dao, profanation of celestial scriptures, deceit, theft, and avarice—all shall be absolved and dissolved.

Reciting this sutra day and night in the six periods shall forever banish the Five Pestilences and plagues from one’s household. Malevolent demons of the world shall flee ten thousand leagues.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!*

**Thus concludes** *The Supreme Divine Incantation Sutra for Prolonging Life.*
