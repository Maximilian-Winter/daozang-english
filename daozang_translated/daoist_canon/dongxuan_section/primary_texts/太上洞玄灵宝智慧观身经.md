The Perfected One of Serene Contemplation, within the subtleties of thought, observes the true mark of the body, penetrating wisdom to clearly perceive the four great elements, the six sense roots and consciousnesses, the five aggregates, and the five mundane dharmas of the world—all as utterly empty and quiescent, entering the gate of formlessness.

That which is called external perception, internal perception, the perception of arising, or the perception of ceasing—all are luminously illuminated and exhausted. There is no dharma of purity or defilement, no dharma of arising or ceasing. In this exhaustion, there is also nothing exhausted; all is ultimately empty, and emptiness ascends into the mysterious.

Why is this so? Internal perception is named the contemplation of the emptiness of objects. This emptiness is also empty; the emptiness of emptiness is also empty, for emptiness is without distinction. This emptiness without distinction is likewise empty, and emptiness is non-dual—thus it is said to be exhausted.

If good men and women illumine the empty nature of dharmas, without the mind of arising or ceasing, without the mind of arrogance or pride, without the mind of fear or dread, without the mind of hatred or attachment, they can be freed from all suffering in the world: the suffering of separation in birth and death, the suffering of harm by ghosts and spirits, the suffering of disputes in public and private affairs, the suffering of water, fire, blades, weapons, hunger, and cold—all are avoided and departed from.

Such exhaustive benefits are not for one or two persons, but for immeasurable, boundless, innumerable beings; not for one or two days, but for immeasurable, boundless, innumerable kalpas. Their merit and power are inconceivable.

Therefore, this teaching is called liberation, the meaning of benefit, the meaning of boundlessness, the supreme meaning. All such meanings, whether inscribed, copied, read, recited, or expounded, constitute entering the gate of wisdom, wandering the chamber of wisdom, sitting upon the seat of wisdom, partaking of the food of wisdom, and attaining the essence of the true mark of wisdom.

At that time, the verse of wisdom was proclaimed:

Wisdom arises from the originless,
Luminously illuminating the ten directions.
Knotting emptiness to tower in the mysterious heavens,
The gods draw from its flowing fragrance.
Its wonder is unfathomable,
Vacuity and resonance truly interpenetrate.
Being is non-being, being is not being;
Non-being is non-being, non-being is not non-being.
Wisdom constantly contemplates the body—
The first task of those who cultivate the Dao.
Vastly entering the mysterious ford,
Naturally recording my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy ever protects,
While demon kings guard the precious words.
Resplendent is the vajra body,
Transcending the Supreme Immortals.

Wisdom engenders the root of precepts;
In the true Dao, precepts are the master.
From this arise the Three Treasures,
Revered and received by lofty immortals.
Riding this deathless boat,
Swiftly crossing the great expanse.
When these precepts are proclaimed,
The gods come to bow in reverence.
