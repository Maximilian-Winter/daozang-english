At that time, the Supreme Dao Lord was in the Jeweled Grove with the assembled immortals, convening a grand Dharma assembly. Among the assembly, a perfected one named Universal Goodness rose with a tablet in hand and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "I observe that the floating lives of mortals, in their schemes for livelihood, raise the six domestic animals—oxen, horses, foals, and calves—yet these frequently suffer from epidemics and pestilence, refusing water and fodder. How grievous! How grievous! I only pray that your great compassion may broadly extend salvation and deliverance."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The people of the mundane world, failing to comprehend prohibitions and taboos, neglect the proper orientations of ox-pens and horse-stalls, thus violating the divine slayings and inviting seasonal qi, which in turn breeds pestilential epidemics. If one wishes to halt and avert these, one must resort to the profound and mysterious. Simply choose an auspicious day to sweep and purify the household, spread out the sacred seat, light lamps and burn incense, and recite the numinous scripture. By thus expiating the divine slayings, one can dispel calamities, cleanse away seasonal pestilence, and ensure they never cause harm again."

The perfected one Universal Goodness bowed in reverent gratitude for the profound grace and offered this hymn of praise:

*"The Heavenly Worthy’s grace is vast as the sea,
Universally saving the people of the world.
Should one seek to dispel poison and harm,
None surpasses the Great Vehicle Scripture.
All beings who turn their hearts to it
Will see the realm prosper and creatures flourish.
If one protects oxen and horses,
Not only calves, pigs, and sheep shall thrive.
Sincerely returning to the Great Dao,
The sagely Dao shall surely shine forth.
Diligently revering the Primordial Beginning,
Blessings and longevity shall be preserved and prolonged.
Stalls and pens shall all be secure,
Blood-livestock shall naturally thrive in ranks.
Relying solely on the power of this true scripture,
One must depend on the radiance of sagely might.
Dragon spirits shall ever guard and protect,
Hooves and horns shall forever flourish."*

When the perfected one Universal Goodness finished reciting this hymn, all the assembled immortals bowed in reverence and withdrew.
