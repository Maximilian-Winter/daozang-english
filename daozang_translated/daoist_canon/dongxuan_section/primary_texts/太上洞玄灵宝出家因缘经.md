# 太上洞玄灵宝出家因缘经

*The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra on the Causes and Conditions of Renouncing the Household Life*

Thus spake the Dao:

In the first year of the Kaihuang era, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month at the hour of noon, at the Three Clarities Precious Altar of the Vermilion Sun Upper Abbey in the Crimson Radiance Kingdom, the Most High Heavenly Worthy received the thirteen thousand five hundred chapters of the supreme Three Caverns Mahāyāna wondrous scriptures, along with seven thousand sections of talismans and diagrams.

As the Heavenly Worthy prepared to return to the formless realm of the Great Void, two hundred kings, together with their queens and consorts, all the great ministers, and the men and women of their kingdoms, as one awakened the Dao-mind. Bowing their heads to the Heavenly Worthy, they renounced their kingdoms, cities, wives, and children, seeking to leave the household life. They vowed to receive and uphold the Three Caverns scriptures, making lifelong offerings to cultivate blessings for the three times of past, present, and future.

The Heavenly Worthy smiled, emanating a nine-colored precious radiance that illuminated the great assembly, as well as the kings and all the men and women of their kingdoms. Within and without, all became luminous and transparent, like lapis lazuli beads—even their viscera, hair, and skin were all clearly visible.

Within this radiance, the kings and others saw their own bodies, inside and out, perfectly lucid. They fully knew their past lives, and the good and evil of their three times—past, present, and future—stood vividly before them.

All the kings and their subjects, men and women alike, were struck with awe. Arousing the supreme and most excellent mind, they prostrated themselves in worship, addressing the Heavenly Worthy:

“By the convergence of past causes and present conditions, your disciples have encountered the compassionate assembly of the Most High, and now again meet the Heavenly Worthy, receiving the great Dharma of the Three Caverns. Further, we have been granted the scriptures, which reveal our former connections. This is no ordinary fortune for mortals—it is the rare blessing of a thousand kalpas, bestowed solely by the Heavenly Worthy’s vast compassion, desiring to deliver us with boundless grace, all converging on this very day.

Though we are as lowly as insects and ants, how could we perceive such profound benevolence? Yet with earnest sincerity, we truly wish to abandon this defiled realm, along with our wives and children, aspiring to leave the household life. We vow to uphold the scriptures and precepts, becoming fields of blessed merit beyond the world. We implore the Heavenly Worthy to grant us this permission.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Before you had even aroused this aspiration, I already knew it.”

Thus does this radiance appear—to reveal to you your past lives and make known the causes and conditions of good and evil.

The cause and condition of leaving the household life are most weighty. That you have aroused this aspiration is beyond all reckoning. Yet I fear that you, long steeped in worldly attachments and given to dissipation, may not endure hardship or sustain this labor, beginning with zeal but ending in slackness, failing to guard the Dao with single-minded devotion. In the end, you may fall into evil paths, slight your teachers, and scorn the Dharma, thereby bringing upon yourselves the fate of sinking into the depths.

At this, all the kings prostrated themselves at once, pressing their foreheads to the ground, their voices and tears mingling as they made this vow: “Should we, after leaving the household life, begin with zeal but end in slackness, forsake our original vow, or retreat midway in indolence, then may we, together with our nine generations of ancestors, sink into hell, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. May we, in future rebirths, take form as non-human beings, and may we never again speak of this.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Listen well, each of you. I shall now expound the causes and conditions of leaving the household life.

Those who leave the household life may have, in past lives, established numinous temples and mysterious altars, along with various pure abodes, and widely constructed halls and sanctuaries. They may have fashioned images of the true and responsive manifestations of the Dao, adorned and made offerings to them, copied scriptures, expounded teachings, recited and circulated them, and awakened humans and devas.

Or they may have, in past lives, offered in alms their kingdoms, cities, wives, and children, their heads, eyes, marrow, and brains, gold, silver, pearls, and jade, silks and brocades, carriages, horses, servants, and slaves, bedding and garments, and all manner of precious objects, dedicating them to the Three Treasures to cultivate fields of blessed merit.

Or they may have, in past lives, observed fasts and upheld precepts, made prostrations and burned incense, practiced the Dao and chanted praises, repented of transgressions and eradicated faults, ever performing good vows without a moment’s lapse.

Or they may have, in past lives, released and ransomed lives, aided the poor, the imprisoned, the elderly, the sick, and all manner of birds and beasts, the blind, the deaf, and those afflicted with the six infirmities, and every kind of sentient being.

Or they may have, in past lives, healed illnesses and cured diseases, reviving those in mortal peril or even those already dead.

Or they may have, in past lives, widely studied scriptures and treatises, expounded teachings, and exhorted the young, guiding them to know the good Dao.

Or they may have, in past lives, planted orchards and groves, dug wells by roadsides, built boats and bridges, and delivered all beings.

Or they may have, in past lives, established great fields of merit, bestowing clothing and food, relieving the hungry, the cold, the sick, and the suffering, and all creatures—fish, birds, and beasts—so that the impoverished were sated.

Or they may have, in past lives, built halls of mercy, pitying those afflicted by cold and heat, offering cool drinks and fire, aiding travelers so they might dwell in peace.

Or they may have, in past lives, wherever they were, aroused the mind of equality and single form, widely transforming men and women, exhorting and assisting in the Dao’s fields, establishing temples to deliver people, copying scriptures and casting images, transmitting scriptures and conferring precepts, making prostrations and burning incense, lighting lamps and reciting, making offerings and repenting, awakening the deluded masses.

Or they may have, in past lives, been loyal, steadfast, benevolent, and filial, aiding their nations and promoting transformation, upright, pure, and honest, gentle and good, never harming any being, bringing peace and joy to all.

Or they may have, in past lives, as rulers, practiced great kindness and goodness, living in humble palaces and eating simple fare, cherishing their people and treating all things with equality, bringing peace to their lands. Yet if their evil was not wholly exhausted or their goodness not yet perfected, though their merit and fame were renowned, they could not ascend. Thus, in accordance with their high or low station, they were reborn among humans, encountered the scriptures and the Dharma, and were able to leave the household life.

Or their seven generations of ancestors may have accumulated blessings, which flowed down to their descendants.

Or they may have, in this very life, established merit, their names resounding throughout the heavens. It is not something attained in a single morning.

In your past lives, you believed in and turned toward the Three Treasures, copied scriptures and fashioned images, established mysterious altars, delivered people and aided beings, observed fasts, made prostrations, recited, burned incense, made offerings, practiced the Dao, made offerings, repented, and vowed without cease, performing great deeds of merit. Thus, you attained the reward of kingship, foremost among humans—this is beyond all reckoning. Moreover, you are able to forsake your kingdoms, cities, wives, and children, abandon worldly joys, seek to leave the household life, uphold the scriptures and precepts, arouse the unsurpassed mind, and cultivate the Dao of long life for the future and the past. This is most rare, beyond all reckoning, beyond all reckoning.”

At this, all the kings prostrated themselves at once, their five limbs touching the ground, their grief and joy beyond measure.

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the true officials of the Nine Earths to prepare the seats of the extended truth. The Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings recorded the registers of those to be delivered as immortals. The Three Heavenly True Kings descended to witness the confirmation of truth. The Five Emperors bore the banners, the Three Realms held the talismans, the Four Offices carried the tablets, and the Three Officials examined the records. The Heavenly Emperor-Lords, the jade maidens and immortal youths, and the divine soldiers and horses—countless millions—all descended at once. They scattered flowers, burned incense, unfurled banners and standards, struck bells and sounded chimes. Ten thousand kinds of heavenly music filled the air, arrayed to left and right. With one voice, they proclaimed their approval and together arrived at the Dao’s field, overseeing the Dharma assembly and opening the good conditions for deliverance.

The Heavenly Worthy commanded me and the Most High and Sacred of Jade Purity to confer upon the kings the precepts and regulations for entering the Dao, along with the standards of conduct and deportment. The Four Heavenly Kings and others bestowed the Dharma robes. Facing north, they made prostrations to the Heavenly Worthy, bowing three times. Then, turning to face east, they prostrated themselves before me and the heavenly immortals and sages, touching the ground to receive the precepts of the Initial Truth.

The precepts state:

After leaving the household life, first, you must not slight or scorn the scriptures and the Dao, nor your original teacher.

Second, you must not carelessly handle or disdain the Dharma robes, thereby damaging the dignity of the Dao.

Third, you must not, midway, retreat and fail, pursuing worldly glory and splendor.

Fourth, you must not abandon your Dharma robes and turn to other teachings.

Fifth, you must not associate or dwell with those who have not left the household life or with followers of other teachings, thereby defiling your Dharma robes.

Sixth, you must not consume wine or meat, nor harbor thoughts of killing or harm.

Seventh, you must not associate with men or women, giving rise to lustful or deviant thoughts.

Eighth, you must not violate the scriptures and precepts, thereby generating transgressions and evils.

Ninth, you must not be arrogant, insolent, cruel, or violent, bullying fellow Dao practitioners or those who have not left the household life.

Tenth, you must not fail to revere your parents and sovereign, nor be disloyal or unfilial.

You must ever arouse the great mind, establish temples to deliver people, copy scriptures and fashion images, and uphold and propagate the sagely teachings.

Second, you must ever arouse the great mind, expound and teach the Three Caverns’ scriptures, and exhort all beings, that they may widely awaken and understand.

Third, you must ever arouse the great mind, maintain fasts and perform obeisance, offer incense with sincerity, and cultivate the karmic fruits of past and future lives in the cycle of birth and death.

Fourth, you must ever arouse the great mind, perform great meritorious deeds for the sovereign, lords, great ministers, and all the people under heaven.

Fifth, you must ever arouse the great mind, create fields of blessings across kalpas for the nine generations of ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, your parents who gave you life, your kin and spouse, and all beings.

Sixth, you must ever arouse the great mind, universally for all beings under heaven and upon the earth—whether sentient or insentient, bound by affinity or not, human or non-human, all who possess consciousness—recite scriptures, perform obeisance, contemplate the Dao, and revere the masters, that all may leave suffering and together ascend the shore of the Dao.

Seventh, you must ever arouse the great mind, vowing that all beings may awaken to the true Dao and forever escape the cycle of birth and death.

Eighth, you must ever arouse the great mind, vowing that from past kalpas to future kalpas, in this life and in lives to come, the great Dao may flourish and never decline, opening the path to deliver all beings.

These kings and others each perform three bows, then turn their minds to bow once to each of the ten directions. Facing the Heavenly Worthy, they make their vows:

First vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to slight the scriptures and Dao or my original master.

Second vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to profane the Dharma robes or diminish the dignity of the Dao.

Third vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to retreat midway or pursue worldly glory.

Fourth vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to abandon my Dharma robes and follow other teachings.

Fifth vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to associate with those who have not left the household life or with followers of other teachings, thereby defiling my Dharma robes.

Sixth vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to consume wine or meat, nor harbor thoughts of killing or harm.

Seventh vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to associate with men or women, giving rise to lustful or deviant thoughts.

Eighth vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to violate the scriptures and precepts, thereby generating transgressions and evils.

Ninth vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to be arrogant, insolent, cruel, or violent, bullying fellow Dao practitioners or those who have not left the household life.

Tenth vow: After leaving the household life, I vow never to fail to revere my parents and sovereign, nor be disloyal or unfilial.

First aspiration: To establish temples to deliver people, copy scriptures and fashion images, and uphold and propagate the Three Treasures.

Second aspiration: To expound and teach the Three Caverns’ scriptures, that all may widely awaken and understand.

Third aspiration: To maintain fasts, perform obeisance, and offer incense with sincerity, without fail day or night.

Fourth aspiration: To perform meritorious deeds for the sovereign, lords, great ministers, and all the people under heaven.

Fifth aspiration: To create fields of blessings across kalpas for the nine generations of ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, your parents who gave you life, and all your karmic connections.

Sixth aspiration: Universally for all beings under heaven and upon the earth, to recite scriptures and perform obeisance, that all may ascend the shore of the Dao.

Seventh aspiration: That all beings may awaken to the true Dao.

Eighth aspiration: From past kalpas to future kalpas, to remain always within the gate of the Dao, with an unretreatant mind.

Ninth aspiration: That all men and women in the ten directions who possess the mind of the Dao may together leave the household life.

Tenth aspiration: That in kalpa after kalpa, I may plant the causes early and attain the immortal Dao, forever free from birth and death.

Having made these vows and aspirations, all in the great assembly exclaim their approval and return to their places. Then the divine immortals, perfected beings, jade lads, and jade maidens, bearing standards and holding canopies, scatter flowers and burn incense, singing praises of the Heavenly Worthy’s boundless virtues. Celestial music is played as they lead the newly departed householders—these kings and others—in circumambulating the Dao three times. Ten times they exclaim their approval, and when the praises and vows are complete, they proceed to the hall of blessings, where they partake of celestial offerings, maintaining pure fasts. The celestial men and women, along with the people of the kingdom, scatter ten thousand kinds of flowers and fruits, rare and wondrous Dharma delicacies, making offerings in due order. When the offerings are complete, they present from their treasuries the seven treasures—pearls and jades, silks and fine fabrics, clothing and bedding, objects of play and adornment, incense burners and tables, dusters and fly-whisks, ruyi scepters and sandals, staffs, eating utensils, sitting mats, rope beds and knee rests, banners and canopies, washing vessels, towels and handkerchiefs, spoons and spatulas, servants and carriages, gardens and estates, parks and enclosures, bamboo groves and fruit trees, flowers and medicinal herbs, ponds and pools—all manner of Dharma requisites, which they donate and offer in devotion.

The newly departed householders and all in the assembly together raise their voices, saying: “By our past good fortune, we have encountered this day. Through the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion, greatly propagating deliverance, these kings have abandoned their kingdoms to leave the household life, thereby creating great blessings for us, opening the eyes of the blind and the minds of the foolish, that we may behold the true Dao. We only pray that these kings may firmly uphold the Dharma, abide in the great Dharma gate, practice the teachings of the Heavenly Worthy, and open the path to deliver us, that we may extinguish our sins, generate boundless goodness, and in future lives attain the Dharma body of one who has left the household life.”

Having spoken these aspirations, they thrice exclaim their approval, gaze upon the Heavenly Worthy, bow their heads, and take their seats.

The Heavenly Worthy says: “All you men and women, through immeasurable kalpas, you have upheld fasts and precepts, made offerings, and performed obeisance, and thus have encountered this inconceivable day. Now you must further make offerings to the newly departed householders and all in this assembly. The merit is boundless, and the joy of gods and humans is assured. You will certainly, at the moment of closing your eyes, be reborn in the gates of wealthy and noble kings, wise and virtuous, and regain the opportunity to leave the household life—this is certain and without error.”

All the men and women exclaim their approval in unison, bow, and return to their seats.

The Heavenly Worthy says: “There are three meanings to leaving the household life: first, leaving the household; second, entering the Dao; and third, forsaking the mundane. What is meant by leaving the household? The household has two meanings. The first is the household of affection and love—love for parents, love for siblings, love for sisters, love between men and women, love for kin and family—all entangling and binding the heart, creating attachments of every kind, generating afflictions, and preventing liberation, so that one cannot cultivate the true and correct Dao.”

“Now, leaving this household means forever severing the bonds of affection and love, ever attaining freedom, and contemplating the Dao in its non-action.

The second is the household of all existence. This body of mine is composed of the five aggregates and the four great elements, temporarily assembled. Dwelling in the world, one deludedly generates attachments. The six senses and the three karmic actions widely construct the dusts of the world. Clinging to worldly conditions, one commits manifold evil deeds. Forms, sounds, fragrances, and tastes disturb the purity of the mind. Once defilement arises, the cycle of rebirth and death ensues, and liberation is impossible. For kalpas unending, one sinks into suffering, life after life, enduring existences not even human.

One must recognize that this body is not the true self—now foul and filthy, a mere aggregation of pus and blood, temporarily lodged for a brief while. Day by day, it dissolves; the hundred bones have no master. It is like a bubble or an illusion, gathering and dispersing in an instant. The ten thousand dharmas are disparate yet equally empty and false. None are truly mine, nor are they identical with me. Deludedly clinging to existence and nonexistence, one generates attachments. The defiled karmic consciousness thus accumulates, and one descends into hell.

Now, leaving this household means forever severing afflictions. Observing the body as empty and illusory, all conditions become perfectly clear. Every thought and movement of the mind returns to the supreme Dao. The spirit embodies the wondrous, refining the form to return to nothingness. Neither dying nor being born, one eternally realizes constant bliss. This is called leaving the household.

What is meant by entering the Dao?
The Dao has two aspects.

The first is the realm of the Dao: the numinous altars and sacred precincts, the mountain forests and secluded retreats, the trees and flower gardens—all are pure and free from action, untouched by the mundane world. When the body ascends to such a place, one faces the true countenance, recites the sacred texts, and is free from all clamor. Burning incense, bowing in worship, pacing the Dao, reciting sutras, expounding the Great Vehicle, and single-mindedly maintaining focus—one abandons the profane realm and enters this Dao-field. Refining mind and form, one is certain to attain constant bliss, perfecting true sagehood and realizing the fruit of the Jade Purity. Without going or coming, one abides in serene constancy.

The second is the essence of the Dao: aligning the body and quieting the mind, one contemplates the inner self, examines one’s own form, and observes all things from afar. All are conditioned, equally empty and nonexistent. Dimly they arise for a moment, swiftly vanishing in an instant. Suddenly appearing, suddenly disappearing, the ten thousand dharmas never cease. A single lifetime is not long. Carefully observing the world, one sees that every thought is impermanent. Closely examining this body, one asks: who is the true self? One must recognize that it is a temporary aggregation. Since it is assembled from causes and conditions, its gathering and dispersal occur in an instant. How can it abide forever? One must preserve the Three and guard the One, refining the form to become true. Eternally in harmony with the Dao, one escapes birth and death, forever realizing the bliss of the pure self. Realizing the fruit of the Dao-field, one transforms this leaky body. This is called entering the Dao.

What is meant by forsaking the mundane?
The mundane has two aspects.

The first is the mundane realm: heaven and earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, cliffs and boulders, grasses and trees, insects and fish—all beings are merely things, temporarily arising and perishing, instantly breaking and decaying. In a short while, they disperse. One must not become attached, defiling this body. One must recognize that the Three Realms are all empty and illusory, and thus abandon them, forever cutting off all craving.

The second is the mundane body: this body of mine—eyes, ears, nose, and mouth; flesh, skin, and bones; hands, feet, and hair; the hundred bones and nine orifices—all are temporarily assembled and called a human. Upon ultimate investigation, no human can be found. Birth, aging, illness, and death—every thought is impermanent. Impure and foul, it is but a temporary refuge. Why cling to it, generating notions of self and other, right and wrong? Killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and wantonness; jealousy, stinginess, and greed; cursing, wrath, and slander; deceitful speech, divisive words, and harsh language; arrogance and oppression; wealth and poverty; mutual encroachment; love and hatred; grasping and rejecting; manifold clinging; drifting amid forms and sounds; craving fragrances and tastes; constantly amassing gold, jewels, silks, grains, and treasures without satiety, intending to provide for ten thousand generations—yet in a single day, the form crumbles to dust.

Now, forsaking this body means ceasing all craving and attachment. The eyes sever all forms, the ears sever all sounds, the nose severs all fragrances, the mouth severs all tastes, the mind severs all dharmas, and the body severs all desires. Even the six senses, six consciousnesses, six desires, six thieves, six entrances, and six defilements—all arise interdependently from the six dusts. The thirty-six conditions, the roots of all evils, are entirely abandoned. The mind becomes perfectly clear, and afflictions are forever severed. This is called forsaking the mundane.

Together, these three are called a Daoist.

Why is one called a Daoist? In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down—every thought and movement of the mind—one’s sole concern is the Dao. Observing fasts, bowing in worship, reverently reciting sutras, burning incense, scattering flowers, lighting lamps, repenting, making offerings, vowing, expounding the Great Vehicle, teaching and guiding beings, arousing the great Dao-mind, performing manifold meritorious deeds, universally benefiting all, putting others before oneself, untouched by worldly toil, and solely practicing Daoist works—this is the meaning of *shi* (practitioner).

The practices vary in degree, and learning leads to differences. There are seven ranks, all called Daoists.

The first is the Celestial Perfected: one’s essence harmonizes with spontaneity, inwardly and outwardly pure.

The second is the Divine Immortal: one’s transformations are unfathomable, transcending the mundane realm.

The third is the Recluse: one conceals one’s light and hides one’s brilliance, unbound by worldly burdens.

The fourth is the Mountain Dweller: one retreats in seclusion, embracing stillness, and the benevolent find peace.

The fifth is the Home-Leaver: one abandons all attachments to existence, shedding the clamor of the dusts.

The sixth is the Householder: one harmonizes with the dusts while embracing the Dao and holding virtue.

The seventh is the Libationer: one humbles oneself to descend among the mundane, rescuing those in peril and suffering. Thus, throughout heaven and earth, the six paths and four modes of birth bow in reverence, for one is most exalted. One does not pay court to emperors nor bow to nobles. One creates blessings for humans and gods, receiving offerings from the Three Realms.

Why is this so? Because one receives the teachings of this Dharma, wears the robes of this Dharma, upholds and transmits the scriptural precepts, and guides beings. One enables past, present, and future—all three times—to forever escape sorrow and suffering, entering the gate of constant bliss. Thus, one is the Dharma-body father and mother of all humans and gods.”

Though emperors and kings possess myriad lands and stand as humanity’s most exalted, they cannot escape birth and death, cannot evade sickness and disease, cannot avoid afflictions and vexations, cannot prevent decay and ruin, cannot shield themselves from cold and heat, cannot halt the cycle of going and returning—whereas the Daoist adept has transcended all such perils.

Should one leave the household yet fail to follow this Dharma, refuse to wear the Dharma-robes; or turn from the Dao to reenter the mundane, abandon truth for falsehood; or pursue heterodox teachings and deviant paths, revering and serving foreign doctrines; or chase worldly glory and splendor, coveting fame and profit; or be coerced by royal law, oppressed by official or private malice, stripped of robes, and the Dharma-body humiliated; or willingly discard the Dharma-robes to sink back into the mortal realm; or face disbelief and disrespect, endure scorn, insults, and abuse, or be beaten and expelled from the Dharma-body’s sanctuary; or harbor arrogance, the mind lacking reverence and solemnity; or engage in jest, mockery, and frivolous laughter, indulging in haughtiness and insolence—such persons shall, in this very life, suffer from leprous afflictions, their eyebrows falling out, their bodies covered in sores and swelling, their flesh rotting away, so that none wish to look upon them. Or they may face imprisonment, fetters, cangues, and chains, their bodies wracked with pain. Or they may become blind, deaf, mute, or dumb, their hands withered, their feet lame, their forms hideous, their lives reduced to poverty and lowliness. Or they may be stricken with madness, epilepsy, or possession by malevolent spirits, vengeful ghosts, and hostile adversaries, who exact retribution, inflicting disease and suffering upon them. Or they may fall prey to venomous snakes, fierce beasts, fire, flood, blades, weapons, violent men, or bandits, meeting unforeseen harm. Or the children they bear may be deformed, poor, and base, forever lacking. Or they may suffer chronic illness, unable to live yet unable to die, forever confined to bed. Or they may be born among barbarian tribes, where mutual slaughter prevails, living in constant terror, parents and children torn apart, until one day they die and plunge directly into hell, forced to swallow fire and eat coals, tread upon mountains of knives, grasp trees of swords, bear iron rods upon their backs, be boiled in cauldrons, pounded in mortars, ground in mills, or frozen by ice, their bodies wracked with myriad pains, tormented day and night, enduring every agony. Even after ten thousand kalpas, when they are reborn, they return as beasts of burden, poor and lowly, blind, deaf, or afflicted with the six maladies, their bodies subjected to endless suffering and mutilation.

Should one, after leaving the household, falter in resolve, treat the Dharma-robes with disdain, violate the scriptural precepts, consume wine and meat, kill living beings, steal, engage in illicit sex, or indulge in wantonness, failing to uphold the Dharma’s appearance and defiling the Dao’s gate, the same fate shall befall them.

Then all in the assembly spoke with one voice, praising and bowing to the Heavenly Worthy, and recited this hymn:

Excellent is the Supreme Worthy,
Compassionate and universally salvific.
Bestowing the Most High Scriptures,
All kings awaken to the truth.
Thereby they together vow,
Sincerely and forever devoted.
Abandoning their kingdoms to seek the homeless life,
They follow conditions to liberate all.
Receiving the precepts and pledging vows,
Humans and gods are moved to sincerity.
Expounding widely the Dharma of causes and conditions,
All enter the path of refuge.
Forever shaping the fruits of birth and death,
Through ten thousand kalpas its flow endures.
We in this assembly,
Together rejoice and drink the sweet dew.

When the four seasons lose their balance and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
When fire, flood, blades, or weapons bring harm to the world, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
When epidemics spread and the people perish, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
When the ruler faces calamity and misfortune befalls him, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
When the kingdom’s destiny is imperiled and warfare erupts on all sides, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
When first ascending the throne to govern and transform the people, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
When ruling the world and the land is unsettled, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
When bearing sons or daughters who suffer illness or misfortune, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
For all calamities, portents, and transformations, every peril and hardship, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.
Whether for parents, oneself, a spouse, children, subjects, ancestors, the living, the deceased, or those in the three wretched destinies, one must establish the *guan* to deliver beings.

Establishing the *guan* to deliver beings dispels heavenly disasters above, stabilizes and secures the kingdom’s destiny, protects and guards the emperor, averts and repels poisonous harms, liberates and saves the people, bringing blessings in life and death. Its merit is vast and towering, universally guiding all to refuge. Its virtue is immeasurable and inconceivable.

The Dao declared: Those who leave the household become fields of merit for birth and death, receiving the supreme reward of humans and gods. They should always be revered, worshipped, and provided for with all necessities—clothing and bedding, toys and utensils, incense, oil, tables, staffs, carriages, attendants, halls and chambers, terraces and pavilions, flower gardens and medicinal groves, bathing pools and orchards, food and delicacies, treasures and silks, banners, flowers, lamps, candles, bells, chimes, Dharma instruments, incense burners, washing vessels, ruyi scepters, and whisk brooms—whatever they possess should be offered in alms to the Dharma-body of those who have left the household, ensuring their peace and comfort. This enables the unfolding of wisdom, the recitation of the sacred scriptures, the offering of incense, the observance of fasts and precepts, the construction of jeweled altars, and the expounding of the Great Vehicle, perpetually serving as fields of merit for the three times—kings and emperors, ministers and chancellors, men and women, and all beings.

Should emperors, kings, ministers, chancellors, or the common people lack faith, reviling, cursing, scolding, or humiliating them, imprisoning them in cangues and chains, harming the Dharma-body, or even injuring or killing them, flogging and torturing them to endure suffering, defiling their Dharma-robes, forcing them back into the mundane, they shall, in this life, contract leprosy and endure every calamity. Their past souls shall plunge directly into hell, suffering myriad torments, for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Upon rebirth, they shall return as swine, dogs, snakes, or vipers, poor and lowly, blind, deaf, or afflicted with the six maladies, their bodies subjected to endless suffering.

Should those who have left the household, out of self-love, endure humiliation, fail to uphold the Dharma’s appearance, and harbor contemptuous or arrogant minds, causing beings to lose faith, they shall, in the past, be reborn as swine, dogs, snakes, or vipers.

Beware, beware, all men and women. The Dao declares: Among you, men and women, it is better to strip five hundred people of their clothes than to remove the Dharma-robe from a single one who has left the household. Better to harm every evil person than to harm the Dharma-body of one who has left the household. Better to offend three thousand fierce beasts than to offend one who has left the household. Better to humiliate five thousand mighty warriors than to humiliate one who has left the household. Better to slight ten thousand malevolent spirits than to slight one who has left the household. Better to sit amidst a great fire than to share a seat with one who has left the household. Better to lie upon a bed of scorching iron than to share a bed with one who has left the household. Better to touch fifty thousand venomous serpents than to touch the Dharma-robe of one who has left the household. Better to blow a great mountain into dust than to speak ill of one who has left the household. Better to swallow ten thousand bushels of raging fire than to consume the belongings of one who has left the household. Better to toil in filth ten thousand fathoms deep than to commit lewd acts against one who has left the household. Better to spill the blood of a hundred thousand people than to witness the faults of one who has left the household. Why is this so?

For one who has left the household is a disciple of the Heavenly Worthy, upholding and propagating the scriptures and teachings; one who has left the household is the supreme Dharma-master of all humans and devas; one who has left the household is the bridge across birth and death for all beings; one who has left the household is the refuge and parent of all people; one who has left the household is the cause and condition for the ruler of the realm to cultivate goodness; one who has left the household is the power that delivers the nine ancestral lineages and seven generations; one who has left the household is the initial resolve of all immortals and sages; one who has left the household is the Dharma-vessel that ferries across the three evil destinies and five sufferings.

The ruler of the realm, parents, and kinfolk offer reverence, faith, and support; the deva-kings, māras, and spirits of the three realms bow their heads, constrain their forms, and declare themselves subordinate officials, receiving the teachings of the Dharma-gate of those who have left the household. Why is this so? Because they receive the bequeathed teachings of the Heavenly Worthy, practice the scriptures and Dharma of the Heavenly Worthy, recite the Dharma-words of the Heavenly Worthy, bear the precepts and registers of the Heavenly Worthy, and hold the talismans and charts of the Heavenly Worthy. Ever are the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, generals, and officers on guard, escorting and protecting them. To offend them is to incur transgression.

Should the ruler of the realm, ministers, officials, or any man or woman generate a mind of goodness and leave the household to enter the Dao, their nine generations of ancestors shall ascend to the heavenly palaces, and their seven generations of descendants shall not fall into hell. If a Daoist broadly exhorts those with karmic affinity to leave the household, each one shall extend their lifespan by one thousand five hundred years. Three or more shall be named among those who attain the rank of immortals, enjoying joy in this life, with clothing and food naturally provided. In past lives, they shall be reborn in heaven, their blessings and retributions boundless.

The Dao declares: All you men and women, having left the household, must guard and uphold the Dharma-robe, revere your master and contemplate the Dao, uphold and serve the scriptures with sincerity, diligently cultivate your practice, pay homage and burn incense, maintain perpetual purity and uphold the precepts, recite scriptures and perform the Dao, expound the Great Vehicle, broadly attain merit, mutually enlighten and deliver one another, transform and instruct beings, propagate the Dharma-teachings, constantly practice compassion, rescue and aid all, refine the supreme Dao, turn the spirit to enter the wondrous, abide in perpetuity, advance with each thought, never regress or fall away, and ultimately attain the true Dao.

The Dao declares: All you men and women have, for kalpas without measure, cast off and received bodies, practiced all good paths, and upheld purity and precepts. Now that you have left the household, you must know the causes and conditions of your past lives and present existence. By virtue of past merit and the power of the Dao, one is born among humans, entrusted to the womb of parents, where karmic affinity converges. The two halves unite to form a body, modeling heaven and emulating earth, complete with the six senses. Endowed with primordial qi, it generates and transforms the hundred spirits, moving yin and yang, pervading the entire form. Eyes, ears, nose, and mouth; bones, joints, and skin; organs, viscera, blood, and vessels—all are internally and externally connected. The true qi gathers, nourishing and defending the five spirits, rendering the body firm and enduring. Internally, it originates from a single source; the sun and moon flow and illuminate, generating and transforming the hundred spirits. The Three Origins and Eight Luminaries transform endlessly, internally and externally harmonizing. Thirty-six thousand in number, from beginning to end, they follow a sequential order.

Now I shall explain this to you; you must recognize it. At the inception of human conception, the Dao is one with causes and conditions. Heaven and earth, yin and yang, each contribute a half. Before the body exists, it dwells in the mother’s womb, where the qi of the Nine Heavens constructs and the Three Origins arrange the spirits. In the first month, it is called the *bao* (embryo-sac), for it envelops. The primordial qi enfolds and gathers, forming a chaotic yellow, revolving and transforming, within which lies true essence. In the second month, it is called the *tai* (embryo), for it expands. The spirit, riding past karma, descends into the parents’ bodies, constructing yin and yang, expanding its form. In the third month, it is called the *hun* (ethereal soul), for it is like clouds. The pure essence of yang thins to generate the spirit, drifting like clouds, ceaselessly revolving and managing. In the fourth month, it is called the *po* (corporeal soul), for it is tranquil. The pure qi of yin congeals the spirit and stabilizes the form, settling calmly to establish the body. In the fifth month, it is called the *zang* (viscera), for it stores. Yin and yang take form, the Five Phases array themselves, and the five viscera—liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—are established to store the five spirits, governing the myriad spirits and generating the entire body. In the sixth month, it is called the *fu* (bowels), for they gather. They accumulate pure fluids, irrigating the five spirits. The large and small intestines, stomach, gallbladder, triple burner, and bladder digest and regulate the essences of grain, completing the hundred parts of the body. In the seventh month, it is called the *qiao* (orifices), for they communicate. They enable entry and exit, seeing and hearing, internally and externally illuminating. In the eighth month, it is called the *jing* (luminaries), for they alert. The Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries vigilantly guard the human body. In the ninth month, the spirits are complete. Heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and Five Phases, the four seasons and their transformations—all spirits, internally and externally harmonizing, enter and exit the body. Above and below the Three Divisions, encircling the Three Palaces, eight thousand in all, manifesting and reflecting, simultaneously generate the body. A golden hall and jade chamber, twelve-storied towers, purple gates and jade pavilions, sun, moon, and stars, the Five Peaks and Four Seas—modeling earth and emulating heaven—revolve and are fully equipped, pervading the entire body.

In the tenth month, the spirits of heaven and earth, the Five Emperors and Four Directors, the Nine Heavens’ Marshals, the benevolent deities of the ten directions, jade maidens and immortal youths—all descend in vigilance. The Great One guards the chariot, the Mysterious Mother watches the chamber. Heaven is moved, earth is stirred, and all the sages rejoice as one. The Registrar of Life inscribes the ledger, the Heavenly Emperor fixes the years. According to past karmic deeds, retribution is meted out without error. Preserve the form and guard the spirit, calm the heart and let it be natural. Transform and refine the turbid and stagnant, renew good deeds. By the Dao, commune with the spirits; by virtue, nurture the form. When form and spirit unite in harmony, return to emptiness and nothingness—neither born nor dying, eternally abiding in solitary existence. People must nurture form and spirit; take care not to harm them.

You, Daoists, must preserve and protect form and spirit, cherish and cultivate essence and qi. Do not damage hair or skin. Internally, safeguard the spirit; externally, maintain the body’s form. Crowned with the lotus, treading upon Mount Tai, robed in the sun and moon, the Four Symbols distinctly arrayed—heaven and earth reside within the body, the sun and moon abide in the person. Those who possess the Dao are worthy of emulation; those who embody virtue are worthy of reverence. All things submit, everything takes refuge. Thus is the Dharma-robe, the Dharma-body of one who has left the household life.

The Dao speaks: After my passing, in the latter half of the Primordial Kalpa, there will arise heterodox teachings and demonic ways that do not follow my instructions, creating their own doctrines. The people will believe and turn toward them, and the world will submit. They will harm the form and destroy the body, amass wealth and treasures, erect vast images, construct extensive dwellings, falsely claim saintly attainment and past-life blessings. Engaging in lust and deceit, they will confuse and mislead people’s hearts. Gradually spreading, men and women will revere and believe, never awakening. Nations will fall, families perish, bodies be destroyed, clans scattered, one after another in succession. The whole world will sink into delusion, never to perceive the truth. At that time, my Dharma will be greatly corrupted; people will refuse to practice it, honoring only demonic teachings. The teachings of quiescence and extinction, of long life and enduring vision, will be disbelieved and unused. How grievous, how grievous!

Daoists, lacking understanding, will also follow these ways. Once habituated to such teachings, they will forever forfeit the hope of immortality and long life. Can they not be cautious? Why is this so? Because these are yin teachings, demonic ways, doctrines of death and extinction. It is like rotted grain—can it still bear the semblance of life? Like putrid soil—can it nurture beings? Like dead ashes—can they ever blaze again? Like withered trees—can they flourish anew? Dissolving, decaying, turning to dung and dust—these are the teachings of quiescence and extinction, of non-rebirth.

The world regards life as good and death as evil; all desire to live and grieve at death. Therefore, I expound the teachings of long life, enabling one to avoid death and abide eternally. Yet, due to the perversity of sentient beings, they cannot believe and uphold them, leading to death and decay. Instead, they seek the teachings of death and extinction. How mistaken! For what need has the dead to learn?

Thus, the Dao of immortals values the preservation of the body; the demonic way values the destruction of form. The Dao of immortals values brilliance; the demonic way values darkness. The Dao of immortals values eternal existence; the demonic way values annihilation. The Dao of immortals values purity and emptiness; the demonic way values turbidity and disgrace. The Dao of immortals values security; the demonic way values peril. The Dao of immortals values having a body; the demonic way values formlessness.

Those who possess the Dao attain long life through non-action, refining the spirit to enter subtlety, returning to the Great Dao. When form and spirit unite in harmony, they abide eternally without perishing. Those without a body are like dead ashes and dust—form decays, spirit departs, sinking into the ninefold darkness, the profound obscurity of the netherworld.

You, Daoists, should take heed. I foretell this now so that those with aspiration may understand.

The Dao speaks: After my passing, there will be Daoists who don the Dharma-robe, appearing to have left the household life, yet whose hearts are truly malevolent. They consume wine and meat, kill living beings, steal, engage in licentiousness and perversion, committing all manner of transgressions. Focusing on minor arts, they covet fame and profit, uprooting their foundation and turning from the true to the heterodox. Disbelieving in the true Dharma of immortality and long life, they pursue demonic teachings of death and extinction—by the thousands and tens of thousands. I shall dispatch the Five Heavenly Demon Kings to sequentially execute them.

The Dao speaks: There will be Daoists, both men and women, who uphold the scriptures and observe the precepts, bow in worship, burn incense, make offerings, aid the poor, construct sacred temples, copy scriptures, cast images, expound teachings, and guide those with aspiration. They will swallow saliva, preserve the Three Ones, calm the heart, and extinguish thoughts, single-mindedly seeking the true immortal Dharma of deathlessness without wavering. For these, I shall send the divine officials of the heavens and the lords of the nine earths to teach them the great Dharma, bestow upon them true scriptures, divine elixirs, and magical herbs—immortal mushrooms and jade blossoms—to extend their years, transform their bodies, and refine their spirits. Following the path of eternal abiding, they will be summoned into the immortal palaces, the grotto-heavens of the Five Peaks, gradually attaining spiritual communion, refining the spirit to enter subtlety, and soaring through the heavens. Such practitioners are beyond worldly measure, for the Dao of immortals is hidden and unknown to most.

All the kings and their retinues, the immortals and sages, praised this in unison, bowed their heads, and withdrew.

Thus concludes the *Scripture of the Causes and Conditions of Leaving the Household in the Wondrous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*.
