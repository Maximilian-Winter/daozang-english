**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Perfected-One’s Admonitory Dharma-Wheel Sublime Sutra**

**Sutra Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Perfected-One’s Admonitory Dharma-Wheel Sublime Sutra*

The Dao speaks:
Now, the turning of the Wheel ensures blessings and felicity never perish. Those born with a love for learning, who honor the Master and the Treasure, and form karmic ties with the Dao, shall never be severed from it through successive lives—all due to the accumulated deeds of past existences. Such is the Dharma-Wheel: the superior practitioner diligently upholds it, widely opening the gates of the Dao, placing others before self, delivering even kings, curbing desires to aid the destitute, enduring nakedness and cold, extending benevolence to birds and beasts, bestowing kindness upon all beings, revering the Master and upholding the Dharma as though in the presence of the divine, maintaining perpetual fasting and arduous contemplation, delving deeply into the Cavernous Mystery, exhaling and inhaling *qi* and saliva, calming the heart and rousing the will, severing attachments to sensual pleasures, dissolving all distractions, harmonizing emotions and softening *qi*, so that both person and spirit rejoice. Through such conduct, with each death and rebirth, the resolve remains unshaken, and one attains the rank of a supreme immortal. With the Three Masters fully attained, the body ascends to the Great Ultimate, and the position of Immortal Minister is conferred.

The middling practitioner, steadfast in devotion, yearns for the Mystery, delivering all beings, resolving calamities and afflictions, performing deeds and spreading virtue, establishing fields of merit, loyal to sovereign and kin, embracing gentleness, wisdom, and benevolence, delighting in the Three Treasures, cultivating and studying morning and night, humbly seeking the Dao, reciting sacred scriptures, burning incense and scattering flowers, deeply entering the gates of the Dao, eating without thought of satiety, dressing without concern for cold, enduring hardship without weariness, finding joy without exultation, laboring without slackening, persisting even in exhaustion, and perfecting all practices. Through three deaths and rebirths, with unwavering resolve, one attains flight and ascends to the Great Clarity, becoming a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces.

The lesser practitioner cultivates the self, severs emotions and restrains desires, nourishes the spirit through diet and restraint, forsakes glory and splendor, dwells in secluded groves, loving mountains and delighting in waters, immersing in tranquility and truth, maintaining simplicity and steadfastness, abstaining from grains and fasting, perpetually contemplating the Dao, tasting no food past noon, sitting upright as though facing the Master and the Treasure, moving among birds and beasts as kin, wandering alone in cliffs and caves, dwelling in empty mountains, thoughts untouched by longing for home, sorrow unmoved by bodily form, enduring hardship in forests and ravines, chewing pine needles for sustenance, bearing the visage of hunger yet holding the heart like a cinnabar elixir, embracing all trials with a serene countenance, unshaken by trials, the heart tranquil and the spirit at peace. Through such conduct, the Supreme Void is moved, and after nine deaths and rebirths, with unyielding resolve and extraordinary steadfastness, one gains the power of transformation, riding the void in flight, roaming and feasting upon the Five Peaks, wandering carefree in the Great Nothingness. From this, one advances to the rank of a lofty immortal.

All who thus attain the Dao naturally draw the assembly of supreme perfected immortals from the ten directions, as well as the Perfected Ones from the boundless worlds of the four directions—numbering like the sands of the Ganges—who, across countless kalpas, have all received *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Cavernous Mystery Perfected-One’s Admonitory Dharma-Wheel Sublime Sutra*. The turning of the Wheel’s karmic conditions all depend on the merits of past lives to attain the Dao in this present existence, without exception arising from the accumulation of good deeds in former conduct.

This Dharma is profound and mysterious, beyond the comprehension of the foolish, shallow-witted, or emotionally dull. Only those who have attained the Dao, embodying truth and entering subtlety, awaken to the imperishability of life and death, where merits and transgressions are interdependent. Through the practice of this sutra, one attains the ultimate perfection.

The Dao speaks:
Now, those who attain liberation and extinction do so through unbroken karmic conditions, reborn into the human realm with dignified bearing, complete and excellent features, keen intelligence, and profound understanding of the Mystery. Some are born into noble houses or the families of kings and lords, revered by all under heaven—men as rulers, women as consorts and queens—begetting noble offspring generation after generation without end. Others are born into wealthy households, with abundant treasures, lacking nothing in all undertakings. Such virtues arise from the deeds and accumulated good intentions of past lives.

Some find themselves in destitute and troubled circumstances, enduring hardship, sorrow, and unbearable suffering. Yet, they arouse compassionate vows, resolve to do good, exert themselves in meritorious deeds, cultivate fields of blessing, sacrifice for others, and deliver beings, enduring hunger while upholding integrity, never blaming heaven, harboring no thoughts of killing, uttering no evil words, respecting and loving Daoists, and acting only with goodness. When merits are complete and virtues perfected, through one death and rebirth, their blessings become boundless, and they receive the rewards of the present life.

If, in this life, one resolutely changes their course, forsakes official rank to study the Dao, follows a Master to receive scriptures, maintains perpetual fasting and contemplation of the Perfected, refrains from jealousy and harm, guards the mouth and speaks with caution, cherishes the Master and treasures the Dharma, and constantly recites and remembers them, then, building upon the foundation of past lives, through two deaths and rebirths, one attains immortality. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus record the merits and transgressions of people down to the finest detail, with no errors or omissions. Once the vow is set, the resolve is unshakable. Thus, the workings of fate are unfathomable—this is the gateway of the Dharma-Wheel.

The Dao speaks:
All Daoist practitioners, laymen, women, and children—some born with a love for the Dao, honoring the Master and receiving scriptures, cultivating and upholding them at home—should prepare a high seat, perform morning and evening rites, maintain purity, burn incense, and never grow lax.

Those who cherish the Three Treasures as if parched with thirst or starved for hunger, forsake their homes and worldly pleasures, neglect their livelihoods, refrain from lust and harm, abstain from killing, guard their passions and restrain their desires, and devote all their endeavors to the Dharma—such conduct arises from their past lives’ offerings to Daoist masters, their encouragement and support of their teachers, their burning of incense and lighting of lamps, their establishment of fields of merit, their self-sacrifice and acts of kindness, and their relief of the distressed and aid to the poor. When their merits are fulfilled and their virtue is universal, after one death and one rebirth, they attain their present circumstances. From this point, unwavering in their resolve, they swiftly attain immortality. Even if their Daoist practice is not yet complete, when their fate turns again, they may achieve liberation through *shijie*, and ultimately become Perfected Ones.

The Dao speaks:
I have surveyed all the heavens across countless eons and witnessed countless Daoist practitioners, laymen, women, and children who have attained the supreme, perfectly true Dao of the lofty immortals and Perfected Ones. Naturally, the sages of the ten directions have all endured past lives of arduous seeking of the Dao, beyond measure. They offered their bodies and abandoned their lives without limit, broadly established merit and virtue, aroused the mind of the Great Vehicle, maintained long fasts and rigorous practices, and purchased fragrant oils to light ten lamps, a hundred lamps, a thousand lamps—an immeasurable number—whose light illuminated the ten directions and shone upon all the heavens, dispelling darkness universally. They scattered gold, jewels, and treasures along the roads, supplied the destitute, sacrificed their bodies and severed their attachments, served their masters with devoted hearts, and harbored no stinginess. Reflecting on their past lives’ failures, they now dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to liberating sentient beings, so that even birds and beasts are drawn to their benevolence. Thus, their virtuous influence overflows, their merit moves the heavens, their bodies attain the seventy-two marks of the Vajra, and their necks bear radiant orbs that illuminate the vast sky. They ascend to the rank of lofty immortals. Such blessings are vast and beyond description. Countless such examples exist, all achieved through accumulated practice, not merely through a single lifetime of study.

Those who come to learn in future lives and enter my Dharma-gate should reflect upon their past existences in pursuit of immortality. When their merits are fulfilled and their virtue is universal, they will enter the realm of the natural and perfectly true. Now, I expound three verses of the Dharma-Wheel.

**The Verse of the Eight Gates of Liberation of the Supreme Dharma-Wheel states:**
I open the Eight Gates, within which lies a jade city.
Jewel forests of the seven treasures grow without roots,
their golden branches intertwined, casting shade upon the Upper Clarity.
The Dharma-Wheel of liberation connects the true and reaches the numinous.
Above, nothing is unilluminated; below, nothing remains obscure.
When I see Daoist practitioners reciting scriptures morning and evening,
maintaining long fasts in secluded mountains, unwavering day and night,
eating cypress and juniper, drinking pure water,
personally receiving the Dharma from their masters, never deviating for a moment,
dwelling alone in rocky caves, journeying solitary paths,
herding with deer, resting their forms against the forest,
facing wild beasts in stillness, hearing the mournful cries of birds,
the wind and clouds their companions, myriad withered things sinking into decay,
ice congealing in the ravines, pristine snow veiling the courtyards,
the cold piercing their flesh, their resolve exceptionally steadfast,
enduring hardships in the mountains and valleys,
laboring without weariness, exhausting themselves without rest,
unceasingly seeking the Dao, they ultimately move the imperial heart.
Cinnabar texts and green characters, celestial charts and mysterious names appear.
Clad in the feathered robes of immortals, their brocade skirts soaring in azure,
they descend in splendor, resplendent with fiery bells,
riding chariots of flowing rosy clouds, the three pure ones flying alongside.
Entering my Eight Gates, they comprehend life and death,
all through accumulated practice—how pitiful are sentient beings!
This verse emerges from the Supreme Elder Lord of the Mystic Terrace, who surveyed the eight directions and called them the Eight Gates, to be recited as this chapter.

**The Verse of the Dharma-Wheel’s Turning, Liberation, and Karmic Deeds states:**
The Dharma-Wheel opens liberation, and life and death follow one’s vows.
Accumulated foundations yield clear retribution; fortune and misfortune spur one another.
The worldly seek past lives; the enlightened aspire to future returns.
If past-life merits are unfulfilled, blessings arrive belatedly.
Rely on past encouragement to continue practice; when merits are complete, the form flies of itself.
The immortals of the ten directions in past lives endured eons to enter subtlety.
I observe the most devoted scholars, yet they fail to embrace others’ hearts.
Diligent practice and reverence for the master’s treasure bring the master’s vast protection.
To slight the master is to lose my treasure; past merits are forever nullified.
Exhortations confirm your truth; the Three Masters guide you through the mystic gate.
If you embody the true Dao, the Dharma-Wheel’s cave will open of itself.
Do not see this as desolate—within the hidden and obscure, it is most profound.
This verse emerges from the Supreme Dao Lord of the Void and Non-Being, who observed past lives from the midst of the boundless and recited this chapter to exhort entry into the void.

**The Verse of the Dharma-Wheel’s Turning When the Root of Life is Not Yet Exhausted states:**
The Dharma-Wheel turns through the empty and cavernous, liberating through repeated deaths and rebirths.
Sin and blessing each have their counterparts; fortune and misfortune know no partiality.
Attaining the Dao arises from one’s past-life essence; the deeds of evil summon such cruelty,
dragging one through the five realms of suffering.
Though heaven and earth stretch endlessly, the mysterious mirror’s principle is most clear.
I have observed your kind, who receive my scriptures from your masters,
yet betray your masters upon obtaining them, harboring jealousy and contending for merit and fame.
Stumbling without self-blame, you spew resentful words,
causing the Six Departments to wield their brushes and condemn your crimes.
When your life ends, you bear the Knife Mountain; suffering and torment cling to your body.
Wandering through the Three Paths, do you not perceive your form and name?
Transformed into herds of beasts, you gaze longingly toward the darkness, hoping to return.
The Dharma-Wheel turns ceaselessly; departure and stay know no delay.
Pity the origins of this fortune and misfortune, for retribution does not wait for another life.
Grieving your ignorance of fate, I compose this verse to lament my heart.
This verse emerges from the Supreme Venerable Lord of the Void and Perfect Truth, who surveyed the karmic deeds and transgressions of past lives, the counterparts of betrayal and rebellion, to exhort entry into truth and the practice of great compassion. Recite this verse to understand the roots of past lives.

The Perfected One of the Supreme Unity of the Mystic One states:
I once received the *Exhortation Scripture of the Eight Gates of Liberation of the Supreme Dharma-Wheel of the Limitless Supreme Dao Lord*, practiced the Dao to completion, and attained the rank of Perfected One. This text was born with the Primordial Beginning, encompasses heaven and earth, and endures for countless eons. It broadly liberates all beings, serving as a bridge for all, turning the Wheel of Exhortation to instruct the Three Vehicles, universally covering all without exception. It opens the path from death to life, its blessings immeasurable, revered by all heavens and relied upon by all practitioners.

This text is profoundly sacred, conferred only upon those whose names are inscribed in the Mystic Register of the Celestial Charts, whose characters are recorded in the Three Clarities, and who are destined to become Lords of Immortality. Those unworthy of its essence must not recklessly transmit it. To encounter its verses is the fruition of accumulated merit and virtuous conduct from past lives. Those who wholeheartedly venerate and uphold it, practicing in accordance with its teachings, will naturally dissolve their karmic roots, forge bonds with goodness, enjoy worldly blessings and prosperity, and see their households flourish. Their beings shall be liberated, forever entering the realm of non-action, and ultimately attain the rank of Perfected One. To transmit it carelessly or with negligence invites the destruction of one’s own existence.
