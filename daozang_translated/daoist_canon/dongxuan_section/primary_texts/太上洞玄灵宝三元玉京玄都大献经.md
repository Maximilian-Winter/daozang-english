**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Three Primes, Jade Capital, and Mystic Metropolis of the Great Offering**

This scripture is titled *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Three Primes, Jade Capital, and Mystic Metropolis of the Great Offering*. Its author is unknown. Tang dynasty scholar Xuanying’s *Rectification of Heresies* attributes this text to the Daoist Liu Wudai, who composed it in imitation of the *Ullambana Sutra*. The original consists of one fascicle and is included in the *Daoist Canon* (Zhengtong Daozang) under the Cavernous Mystery Division, Texts category, as an annotated edition. There is also a fragmentary manuscript (S. 3061) from Dunhuang without annotations. The present translation is based on the *Daoist Canon* edition, collated with the Dunhuang manuscript.

**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Three Primes, Jade Capital, and Mystic Metropolis of the Great Offering**

The perfected ones of wondrous origin emerge before the myriad forms; the great sages of profound source transcend beyond the six directions. Neither born nor extinguished, they elude the reach of seeing and hearing; without dependence or action, they surpass the bounds of form and name. Though abstruse and profoundly remote, they respond and transform without limit; though subtle and empty, they truly benefit all beings. When they manifest golden countenances in the golden palaces, they reveal the hundred-thousandfold dharma-body; when they prepare jade tablets in the Jade Capital, they open the essential scriptures of the five directions. None fail to bridge the myriad kinds, awakening the deluded masses, responding to karmic conditions, and adapting their teachings to the moment.

Yet now, the wondrous origin of the Numinous Treasure remains serene and equanimous. All sentient beings, however, turn from the real and lose their essence, indulging in empty imaginings and false views. They recklessly indulge the six senses, entangling themselves in the net of desire, thereby sinking into the five turbidities through karmic bonds. Thus, the苦海 (*sea of suffering*) knows no bounds; drifting through the three wretched destinies, birth and death stretch endlessly. Without the guidance of perfected ones, there is no escape from suffering.

Our Great Sage, the Heavenly Worthy, encompasses wisdom in both emptiness and existence, his station surpassing the limits of the cosmos. His Dao pervades the Great Network (Daluo), opening the gate of myriad wonders and penetrating the realm of double mystery. With compassion, he saves beings; ever benevolent, he delivers humanity. Thus, he manifested traces in the Western Land, appearing in the mountain’s south to expound the teachings beneath the mulberry grove. He adorned the sacred with precious jades, sending forth auspicious omens in clouds and mist, scattering numinous fragrance across pure realms. Everywhere, wondrous forms unfolded—smiling, he emitted fivefold radiance; illuminating all heavens, his divine splendor shone across the ten realms.

Moved by the suffering of beings in the evil destinies—oppressed in the three wretched paths, entangled in the eight difficulties—he responded to the inquiries of the Dao Lord, explaining the causes of adversity, expounding the portents of fortune and misfortune, and discoursing on the meritorious practices of redemption. Thus, he revealed this Dharma of the Great Offering of the Mystic Metropolis to instruct humans and gods. Universally, he vowed to eradicate the roots of transgression in the five destinies, enabling the four kinds of birth to restore their names in the register of life.

This scripture is titled *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Three Primes, Jade Capital, and Mystic Metropolis of the Great Offering*. Scriptures take karmic resonance as their essence, compassionate deliverance as their substance, and vows and practice as their function. However, later interpretations of the title vary in detail—some broadly explain the Two Vehicles, others narrowly expound the Three Treasures—all being conjectures of later generations, unrelated to the original intent of the title.

Here, we thoroughly investigate the principles of its name and examine its historical traces, extracting its essential meaning to form a single explanation. The title is divided into two parts: the first six characters are the general title, and the latter eight characters specify the particular title.

Within the general title, there are further divisions. The first two characters, *Tai Shang* (Supreme), invoke the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy, indicating the sage who expounds the teaching. The next four characters, *Dong Xuan Ling Bao* (Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure), reveal the profound name of the supreme teaching, clarifying the true Dharma being expounded.

First, the invocation of the Heavenly Worthy’s sacred name: *Tai* (Supreme) means "great" or "ultimate," denoting the vastness of his essence. *Shang* (High) means "exalted," expressing the loftiness of his virtue. The Heavenly Worthy’s virtue is supremely exalted, his essence boundlessly vast; thus, his virtue and essence are both declared, hence *Tai Shang*.

Next, the true Dharma expounded in the *Dong Xuan* scriptures: *Dong* means "to penetrate" or "to unify." *Xuan* means "profound" or "remote." This scripture’s wondrous principles are profoundly clear, its true path vast and boundless—penetrating without obstruction, unified without division: this is *Dong*. Deep and unfathomable, distant and inexhaustible: this is *Xuan*. Hence, *Dong Xuan*.

*Ling Bao* (Numinous Treasure) signifies the meaning of "numinous transformation beyond measure." *Bao* (Treasure) denotes "precious and esteemed." This wondrous scripture’s principles are subtly profound, its numinous transformations beyond measure, urging practitioners to treasure and uphold it. Thus, the *Daode Jing* states: "I have three treasures, which I treasure and uphold." This is its meaning.

The particular title is also divided into two parts. The first eight characters, from *San Yuan* (Three Primes) to *Da Xian* (Great Offering), clarify the scripture’s purpose. The final character, *Jing* (Scripture), is the general term for Dharma teachings.

Clarifying the scripture’s purpose: the Three Primes are presented to elucidate the retribution of good and evil and the wondrous Dharma of exhortation and admonition. Thus, the Upper Prime, Middle Prime, and Lower Prime are described. All sentient beings’ records of life and death, good and evil, are universally bound to the Three Primes and Nine Bureaus, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who examine and verify merits and transgressions without the slightest error.

The Three Primes are as follows: the fifteenth day of the first lunar month is the Upper Prime, when the Heavenly Official conducts the reckoning. The fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month is the Middle Prime, when the Earthly Official conducts the reckoning. The fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month is the Lower Prime, when the Water Official conducts the reckoning. All sentient beings are governed by the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water.

The reason the fifteenth day of the first lunar month is the Upper Prime, when the Heavenly Official conducts the reckoning: in the eleventh lunar month, the first yang arises; in the first lunar month, the third yang arises, completing the *qian* (☰) trigram. *Qian* is the function of Heaven. When the celestial numbers are complete in the first lunar month, all Heavenly Officials preside over the reckoning.

The reason the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month is the Middle Prime, when the Earthly Official conducts the reckoning: in the fifth lunar month, the first yin arises; in the sixth lunar month, the second yin arises; in the seventh lunar month, the third yin arises, completing the *kun* (☷) trigram.

*Kun* is the function of Earth. In the seventh lunar month, the *kun* qi prevails in full cycle, so all Earthly Officials preside over the reckoning.

The reason the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month is the Lower Prime, when the Water Official conducts the reckoning: the tenth lunar month corresponds to *hai*, which belongs to the north; the north is *kan* (☵), and *kan* is the position of water. This is precisely the time when the Water Bureau establishes its dominion, so all Water Officials preside over the reckoning.

Moreover, the Three Primes are the fundamental origins. These Three Officials serve as the foundational principles for the conduct of all things, hence they are called the Three Primes.

*Yujing* is the name of a sacred mountain within the Three Clarities’ wondrous realm. *Xuandu* is the title of a palace in the Great Brahmā Heaven. The *Great Offering* refers to this sutra’s universal reckoning of humans and devas, modeled after the *Great Offering* rites of Xuandu, to deliver and redeem all departed spirits. Its vast and encompassing merit is thus called the *Great Offering*.

The Heavenly Worthy, in compassion for the multitudes, emits divine radiance. The Dao Lord, in pity for sentient beings, transmits the dharma of this sutra, fully expounding the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials—the Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Offices, Four Controllers, and Five Thearchs—who, on the mornings of the Three Primes, ascend to the Xuandu Palace to assess the good and evil of humans and devas, distinguishing the registers of life and death. All meritorious deeds are duly recorded, while karmic punishments in the netherworld may be absolved through redemption. The proper methods of deliverance are fully set forth in this sutra.

Thus, from the Son of Heaven down to the common people, if one encounters this precious sutra and practices its teachings, gathering the finest fruits, flowers, and fragrant delicacies—all the rare and wondrous treasures of the human realm—with sincere devotion, one may arrange a *Great Offering* tray, adorned in manifold ways, and make offerings. The saints of the ten directions will clearly witness this, and the Three Generations of Heavenly Worthies will bestow their grace, for this is the very purpose and intent of this sutra.

Later, the general term for the teachings of the Dao is as follows: examining the true texts of the Three Caverns and the seven divisions of the mysterious teachings, one finds their titles commonly called *sutras*. Thus, *sutra* is the comprehensive name for the teachings and the grand model of perfected beings. The excellence of the sutra is indeed great, for it is the vessel for all beings.

Sutras are of many kinds, broadly categorized into three:
1. Those of the Five Virtues and Three Primes, inscribed in cloud-seals upon the void, with eight-rayed radiance—esoteric and wondrous texts.
2. Those written in azure script on purple brushes, on golden tablets with jade characters, encased in phoenix-script and concealed within the Seven Treasures’ Mystic Terrace, either in mountain grottoes or above the heavens.
3. Those on bamboo slips or silk scrolls, written in seal or clerical script as the times dictate, transmitted and circulated in the world.

Though these three forms differ in refinement, all are the teachings expounded by the Great Sage Heavenly Worthy, each capable of curing illness and thus called good medicine.

The meaning of *sutra* has many interpretations. Summarizing its essentials, it may be briefly explained in four ways:
1. **Origin** (*you*): The Three Generations of Heavenly Worthies and the saints of the ten directions all attain the Dao through the sutras and precepts, hence it is called *origin*.
2. **Path** (*jing*): It opens and guides all things, leading the four kinds of birth, serving as the bridge for learners and the essential path for cultivating truth, hence it is called *path*.
3. **Dharma** (*fa*): It embodies profound and wondrous principles, subtle and refined, providing a model for the multitudes and a standard for the saints, hence it is called *dharma*.
4. **Eternal** (*chang*): Not only are its wondrous principles profound and serene, but it is also the unchanging canon of the Three Generations of Dharma Kings.

Possessing these four meanings, it is thus called *sutra*.

Within this scroll, it is further divided into four parts:
1. From the beginning to *"illuminating all heavens"* is the **Preface Section**;
2. From *"At that time, the assembly of saints"* to *"difficult to redeem"* is the **Main Exposition Section**;
3. From *"At that time, the Most High Dao Lord, having received the decree"* to the end of the verse is the **Transmission Section**;
4. From *"At that time, the holy assembly"* is the **Conclusion**.

Within the initial Preface Section, there are five subdivisions:
1. The Heavenly Worthy gathers with his disciples;
2. From *"Together in the Jade Realm of Xina"* onward, describing the pure land’s location;
3. From *"Spreading golden mats upon the ground, with jade-bordered steps"* to the proper description of the land’s adornment;
4. From *"Yellow clouds entwined fourfold, purple auroras encircling thrice"* onward, displaying the auspicious omens;
5. From *"Then the Heavenly Worthy smiled"* onward, manifesting divine radiance.

**The Most High Numinous Treasure Sutra of the Three Primes’ Jade Capital and Xuandu Great Offering**

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, together with the Most High Dao Lord, the Great Saints of the Ten Directions, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, and seven thousand two hundred forty youths, assembled in the Long Mulberry Grove of Mount Fuluo in the Jade Realm of Xina, on Mount Yucha.

**Commentary:** This opens the sutra’s origin and traces the path, listing the assembly of worthies and sages. It is the first subdivision, presenting the Heavenly Worthy gathering with his disciples and describing the pure land’s location.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy is the august name of the Most Sage, the great title of creation and completion. Remotely, it reaches the boundless void, beyond words; proximately, tracing the teachings’ traces, it may be named. *Primordial* signifies its primacy; *Heavenly Worthy* denotes its loftiness and wonder. Hence, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

The Most High Dao Lord is a sage who has attained the Dao. The Flying Heavenly Divine Kings possess free and luminous wisdom. The youths are inwardly free from desires, outwardly detached from worldly pursuits, their pure nature unblemished, serene and still.

Together, they are in the Jade Realm of Xina, on Mount Yucha’s Fuluo Peak. This is a pure land, the wondrous realm of the Jade Capital, the celestial realm above the azure void. It is also said that the people of this land are purely pure and white, like white jade or fresh frost, hence it is named the Jade Realm.

Moreover, the mountain is named Yucha, its peak called Fuluo, and within its forests stands the everlasting mulberry—thus the place is so designated. This is where the sutra is expounded, described here in full. It is as when Confucius compiled the *Book of Documents* or when the Venerable Lord Lao discoursed at Hangu Pass. Having already identified the sage who proclaims the sutra and revealed the site of his teaching, we now further disclose the marvels of his dwelling.

The ground is spread with golden mats, the steps edged with white jade. Seven treasures and luminous jades gleam with radiance bright as the sun. Yellow clouds entwine on all four sides, purple mists coil thrice around, and fragrant light suffuses the azure void, overflowing into the empty sky.

*Annotation:* This is the dwelling of the Heavenly Worthy, the third [section], describing the adornment of the land and the manifestation of auspicious signs. *Spread* means to lay out. The site of his teaching is entirely covered with gold, and the edges of its steps are bordered with white jade. The *seven treasures* include gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, giant clams, and agate. *Luminous jades* are another name for jade. The Heavenly Worthy’s abode is adorned with rare and wondrous treasures, exquisitely arrayed, their brilliance resplendent, shining through the ten directions, illuminating all heavens, outshining the sun and moon—hence it is said that their light gleams like the sun.

The *yellow clouds entwining on all four sides* and the *purple mists coiling thrice* signify manifold auspicious omens. Yellow is the color of the central direction. True hues manifest blessings, joyous clouds display portents, all converging at once, arriving from every side, dense and luxuriant, swirling in encircling embrace. Moreover, light purple mists spiral thrice, while divine winds stir and fragrant vapors billow, filling the empty sky as offerings.

*Annotation:* No other matters are spoken of here, yet *purple mists* are mentioned. Crimson and black intermingle to form purple. Crimson is yang, the Dao; black is yin, virtue. This reveals that the Heavenly Worthy’s virtue and Dao are like a compassionate cloud, sheltering all beings, their grace surpassing even that of parents. The rare and refined adornments of the celestial paradise, the natural rewards of karmic fruition, differ utterly from the mundane. Even the music and wondrous arts must be extraordinary. The *Celestial Harmony* is a marvelous sound arising naturally; the *Great Music* consists of sublime melodies beyond compare. Thus it is called *marvelous and refined music*. The *myriad forms interplaying* means that the sounds performed arise spontaneously, a thousand arts and ten thousand skills delighting the Heavenly Worthy. As the assembled heavens offer rare treasures and play refined music, the Heavenly Worthy rejoices, revealing his numinous countenance. A smile graces his face, and five-colored light streams from his mouth, penetrating and illuminating all heavens. This is the Heavenly Worthy’s joy manifesting his numinous presence—the fifth [section], displaying his majestic radiance.

From the above to this point constitutes the *prefatory section*. The Heavenly Worthy is ever at ease, and when he smiles, his light is like spring’s warmth. Wherever his radiance reaches, all receive its grace, none left unilluminated. With the pure eye of the Dao, all sages share this vision, gathered together in the assembly, rightfully perceiving all.

At that time, all the sages, united in one place, universally beheld the hells within the boundless worlds of the ten directions. By the Heavenly Worthy’s majestic light, nothing in the hells remained unseen.

*At that time* refers to the moment when the Heavenly Worthy expounds the sutra. *All the sages* is a collective term. United as one, they all universally perceived, yet knew not what torments and punishments filled the hells. The condemned toil in penal servitude, hungry ghosts and dead souls stand naked, their necks and feet bound in chains and fetters. This shows that beings, through past karma, fail to cultivate good roots and commit every evil. Upon death, they enter the hells and the hungry ghost realm, emaciated and bare, their heads and necks shackled. The hungry ghosts and dead souls, stripped of clothing, wear locks on their necks and fetters on their feet—how excruciating must their suffering be!

Their feet stand on sword trees, their heads bear fire mountains. These are the retributions they receive according to their karma. Not only do they endure hunger and nakedness, but their bodies are burdened with iron rods, their feet planted on sword trees, their heads crowned with fire mountains, scorched and sliced by unbearable pain. Some have their heads set aflame with burning coals, their feet planted on knife mountains, driven and tormented, beaten with iron rods. Their limbs bound in fetters, they cannot move, enduring this suffering for ten thousand kalpas.

These beings, enduring such agony, what other forms of torment might they undergo? Dragged by others, their five limbs rot and decay, their faces scorched and charred, boiled in cauldrons of seething broth, a myriad pains piercing their bodies.

*Annotation:* The conditions described here are evident from the text. They arise from past lives’ sins: shooting birds in flight, slaughtering beings, setting nets and snares, flying hawks and hunting dogs, ripping open wombs and plundering eggs, boiling creatures in cauldrons—committing manifold transgressions, thus receiving such retribution.

Iron hammers rain blows without respite; hunger and thirst know no rest. When hungry, they eat burning coals; when thirsty, they drink fiery essence. This is the karmic retribution of evil beings, whose sins are manifold, their stinginess and greed excessive, reborn as hungry ghosts. When they seek food, it turns to burning coals; when they seek drink, water becomes fiery essence. This stems from miserliness, obstructing the accumulation of merit. Such is fully expounded in the sutras, not only now recounted for your sake. For ten thousand kalpas, they remain in the hungry ghost realm.

The assembly, moved by compassion, intoned boundless blessings. As one, they raised their hands, snapped their fingers, and paid reverence to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Prayers. They vowed that in life after life, they would never act with miserliness, obstructing the accumulation of merit, and thus receive such retribution. Not only in the hungry ghost realm, but in all other realms, they would drift through the three paths and five sufferings.

This is not merely retribution in one place, but rather drifting through the three paths and eight difficulties, nowhere untouched.

The Three Paths refer to the hell realm, the animal realm, and the hungry ghost realm. The Five Sufferings are: embracing bronze pillars, treading upon knife mountains, walking through sword trees, entering cauldrons of boiling liquid, and swallowing fire and eating coals. Together with the Three Paths of hell, these are called the Eight Difficulties.

Yet all the sages, moved by compassion, ever hold pity in their hearts. Given such grievous torment, there must be questions to raise. What follows is how the inquiry begins.

The Dao Lord bowed deeply and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We pray to know what sins these offenders committed in their past lives, what karmic causes they created, to endure such agony. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to bestow instruction, to reveal what we have not yet heard. If we are graced with enlightenment, we shall reverently receive the sagely grace."

This shows the Dao Lord making the inquiry to ensure that all who have not yet awakened may hear and know. Though the Dao Lord is a sage who has already understood karmic retribution, he now raises these questions to teach and transform all beings.

After the Dao Lord asked about the causes and conditions, how did the Heavenly Worthy respond?

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "These offenders, due to past causes, did not encounter the luminous teachings, did not hear the Dharma’s sound. They were miserly and greedy without measure, killed the innocent without cause, spoke falsely while harboring deceit, imprisoned the worthy, drank wine and ate meat, and brought chaos to the five spirits.

This is the Heavenly Worthy’s response to the Dao Lord’s inquiry, revealing the causes and conditions. All such acts are the evil karma of sentient beings.

Yet the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao, in boundless compassion, saves and delivers all. His divine radiance universally illumines, shining afar upon the ten directions. Thus, the Dao Lord, bearing the Heavenly Worthy’s majesty, having heard and understood the questions, respectfully requested a full explanation of the causes and conditions.

These karmic-obstructed offenders, in their past lives, committed transgressions, did not encounter the luminous precepts of the sagely teachings, did not hear the wondrous sounds of the true Dharma. They were solely devoted to miserliness and greed, did not honor merit and virtue, severed the path to heaven, and created the causes for hell. They sank into the river of love, drifting through the cycle of birth and death.

The five spirits refer to the spirits of the five viscera: the hun, po, spirit, essence, and will. Yet by drinking wine and eating meat, their karmic offenses deepened. Not only did they pollute and disturb the five spirits, but they also revolved through the Eight Difficulties, causing the six roots and three karmic actions to widely create transgressions. They concealed evil and harbored resentment, their bodies and minds unwholesome. They wantonly killed living beings, their greed and stinginess boundless. They lost the Dao and strayed from the true, not knowing how to turn back. Once they enter hell, they shall have no end to their release.

They cursed and reviled, invoked spirits and gods, deceived their teachers and betrayed the Dao, defiled and disrespected the Three Luminaries, usurped their lords and murdered their fathers, and violently harmed their kin. Such meanings are clearly understood.

When they cursed and reviled, they wished for others’ swift ruin, calling upon spirits and invoking ghosts, stopping at nothing. Such words and deeds are too numerous to recount in haste.

This refers to their past lives, when in ignorance and arrogance, their hearts held no reverence or restraint. Their pride and extravagance grew, or they deceived and disrespected Dharma masters, slandered true sages, defiled the sun and moon, and belittled the stars. As ministers, they were disloyal; as children, they were unfilial. In places where they usurped and murdered their lords and fathers—sages find such acts abhorrent, for they harm gradually, hence the term 'usurpation and regicide.'

The *Book of Changes* states: "When a minister murders his lord, or a child murders his father, it is not a matter of a single morning or evening. Its origins lie in gradual accumulation." *Usurpation* means to seize, and *regicide* means to kill. Sages detest such acts and thus alter their names.

Their hearts harbored flattery and deceit, they did not consider the suffering of beings, secretly committed theft, and endlessly slandered others. They seized merit and virtue to enrich themselves, yet refused to practice generosity or give alms to the poor. Now they endure such suffering to repay past enmity.

Such are the deeds they committed while among humans, and their meanings are clear. *Flattery* means to curry favor. *Generosity* means to use what one has to relieve others’ distress, distributing it evenly—hence the term *generosity*.

*Master Zhuang* said: "Green wheat grows upon the hillside. If in life one does not practice generosity, in death, why hold pearls in the mouth? In life, one fears the worry of robbery; in death, one fears the calamity of grave robbers desecrating the coffin."

Yet the evil karma of the mundane world is vast in number. To speak of it briefly is difficult to exhaust. The main categories and names are as such.

Then the Heavenly Worthy, following the sequence of the preceding questions and answers, reiterated the meaning in detail, calling it a *gatha*. A *gatha* is another name for praise and eulogy. To restate the meaning, it is thus called a *gatha*.

*They usurped and murdered their lords and fathers,*
*Killed the innocent without cause.*
*In death, they receive blows from golden hammers,*
*Iron rods never leave their bodies.*

This is the text of the gatha. In the preceding passage, usurpation and murder came later, but in the gatha, they appear first. The weight of lords and fathers has been primary since ancient times. Among the three thousand precepts, "do not kill" is foremost, hence it is placed first in the gatha. This re-emphasizes the meaning of usurping lords and fathers from the preceding prose.

*Entering others’ homes in darkness,*
*Plundering their wealth and goods.*
*Their dead souls descend to dark hell,*
*For ten thousand kalpas, they shall not emerge.*

Such words are self-explanatory.

Thus, *Master Zhuang* said: "Those who do evil in the light are punished by men. Those who do evil in darkness are punished by ghosts. Only when one is clear before both men and ghosts can one act alone." Hence, we know that the netherworld cannot be deceived, and the divine way is not to be trifled with. All transgressions, even the slightest, are recorded. The retribution of good and evil follows like a shadow. Once one falls into the Three Paths, they shall not emerge for ten thousand kalpas.

This re-emphasizes the sin of theft from the preceding prose.

*Lustful and indulgent in excess,*
*Defiling and disrespecting the Three Luminaries.*
*Their dead souls suffer dark confinement,*
*In later lives, they are both mad and deranged.*

This clarifies the karmic offenses of bodily actions. It speaks of those who engage in depravity, indulging in lust without restraint, solely pursuing desire, seeking refinement and smoothness, offending the sun, moon, and stars, and disregarding the Three Luminaries.

When their punishment for clear transgressions is complete and they begin to be reborn in the human realm, though they obtain a human body, they suffer the retribution of madness, folly, and derangement. This clarifies the karmic offenses of bodily actions, then proceeds to speak of the offenses of speech, and what follows thereafter.

*Fierce and quarrelsome in speech,*
*They sow strife among their kin.*
*In death, they suffer molten copper poured down their throats;*
*In later lives, they are ever barking at others.*

This clarifies the offenses of speech. Those who commit offenses of speech engage in frivolous talk, spread false rumors, sow discord among their kin, reverse right and wrong, destroy harmony, recklessly invoke fortune and misfortune, and harm others. After death, they fall into hell, where molten copper is poured into their mouths. Once their punishment is complete, residual karma causes them to be reborn as dogs, ever barking at people.

*Feasting on living beings,*
*Drinking wine to disorder the five spirits.*
*In death, they suffer boiling in cauldrons,*
*With iron rods never leaving their bodies.*

This speaks of those who devour living beings, taking lives without remorse, consuming wine and meat, and neglecting all beings. Thus, the spirits of their five viscera become confused and disordered. Gluttonous for rich flavors, they fail to realize that karmic retribution follows them. At life’s end, they sink into hell, where they are boiled in cauldrons and scorched by furnace coals, enduring myriad pains that never leave their bodies. This re-emphasizes the sin of drinking wine and eating meat from the preceding prose.

*Clamorous, they turn falsehood into truth,*
*Deceiving and deluding the foolish to benefit themselves.*
*In death, they suffer the retribution of having their tongues torn out;*
*In later lives, they are mute.*

This speaks of those who engage in deceitful speech, openly practicing cunning and fraud, using deception and trickery, employing all manner of schemes, and constantly acting unlawfully to seek personal gain. After death, their souls sink into hell, where they suffer the calamity of having their tongues torn out. Once their punishment is complete, they are reborn mute. This clarifies the sin of deceitful speech, echoing the earlier prose on groundless clamor.

*Deceiving their teachers and disbelieving the Dao,*
*They clamor and invoke the divine.*
*Dragged through the Three Paths,*
*In later lives, they take the forms of the six livestock.*

Those who deceive and delude their teachers, slander the true sages, belittle the Three Treasures, defile sacred texts, create divisions in the Dao, utter coarse and violent words, and use curses and invocations, calling upon the divine with loud shouts—such evil karma binds them, casting them into the Three Paths, where they are endlessly tossed and tormented. Once their punishment is complete, they are reborn in the forms of the six livestock, sinking into myriad bodies and losing the human way. This clarifies the sin of defying heaven, echoing the earlier prose on deceiving teachers, defying the Dao, and clamoring to the divine.

*Slandering and striking the worthy,*
*Flattering and scheming without cause.*
*In death, they fall to be stung by venomous beasts;*
*Endlessly tormented, they know no joy.*

Those who engage in slander, defamation, and secret attacks on the worthy, flattering and scheming with deceit, are reborn with the bodies of wasps, scorpions, vipers, or other venomous creatures, taking turns in these foul forms. When will they ever know joy again? From the fierce and quarrelsome speech to this point, all clarify the karmic retribution for offenses of speech.

Hereafter, the offenses of the mind are addressed.

*Diminishing and appropriating offerings of merit,*
*Indulging their miserly and greedy hearts.*
*In death, their souls become hungry ghosts,*
*Hungry and thirsty, they drink fire and consume essence.*

This fully clarifies the offenses of the mind. When those who cultivate goodness deduct from their own bodies, offer alms, and create scriptures and images for the living and the dead, some greedy individuals intercept and appropriate these offerings of merit. Though they may temporarily benefit themselves, retribution follows like a shadow. After death, they fall into the realm of hungry ghosts, where hunger drives them to swallow fire and eat coals. The sin of greed brings such retribution—through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths, they never hear the name of water or broth. When hungry, they eat coals; when thirsty, they drink fire. This clarifies the sin of greed, echoing the earlier prose on appropriating offerings of merit to enrich oneself.

*Disrespecting and insulting the venerable,*
*Failing to revere those who embody the Dao.*
*In later lives, they are born lowly,*
*Taking the forms of the six livestock.*

This clarifies the sin of discriminating between self and others, disrespecting teachers, and insulting the venerable—such retribution is born among the lowly. Those who fail to revere the Three Treasures in life are reborn in the forms of the six livestock. Karmic retribution follows without the slightest deviation. Some are born in remote, lowly lands, among barbarians far from civilization. Though they may obtain a human body, they never hear the names of the Three Treasures, the true scriptures, or the correct Dharma. Through ten thousand kalpas, they rarely encounter them, and the sacred teachings and divine texts remain unseen. From the appropriation of offerings of merit to this point, the offenses of the mind are clarified.

When the Heavenly Worthy finished reciting the verses, the Dao Lord bowed and made his request. After the Heavenly Worthy had spoken these verses, the Most High Dao Lord advanced, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Today’s joyous gathering is beyond words. The Heavenly Worthy has deigned to gaze upon us and bestow teachings on the roots of sin. I wonder—do these sinful beings have families, living relatives, and descendants, or do they leave no heirs in their present lives?"

When the Heavenly Worthy finished reciting the verses, the Dao Lord, harboring doubts, prepared to ask: if no means of redemption were taught, sentient beings would have no escape from suffering. Hoping for a method of salvation, he earnestly posed his question, advancing to bow and speak. The Heavenly Worthy, in his compassion, deigned to bestow guidance. Overwhelmed with gratitude, the Dao Lord heard the decree, his joy beyond words.

The Dao Lord also knew that sentient beings’ sons and daughters, their descendants, continue unbroken through generations. Wishing to teach them how to preserve their lineage and save their departed ancestors, he raised this question to introduce what follows.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Though they may have sons and daughters, if they do not cultivate merit or create karmic conditions, how can they escape? Their transgressions grow ever more severe, sinking them into the fields of sin. Through countless kalpas of suffering, they have no way to return. All evils are committed, and their hopes of rebirth stretch endlessly."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "The descendants, sons, daughters, and families of these sinners, lacking merit and possessing only the karmic conditions of hell, see their transgressions grow ever more numerous and grave. In the end, their sorrowful souls, suffering spirits, sink and stagnate, trapped in the filth of sin, their minds planting the seeds of past evil karma."

The text further states that those who accumulate evil have sins that flourish and multiply, like brambles and thorns overrunning a barren, filthy field. Even if the seeds of the five grains or good sprouts fall therein, they are ultimately choked by the overgrowth, never able to grow into stalks or bear fruit—hence the term "fields of sin." The Heavenly Worthy, seeing the depth of hell’s sins and the difficulty of rescuing those mired in suffering, thus raises this question to introduce what follows.

The Dao Lord bowed and again asked the Heavenly Worthy: "By what karmic conditions may one escape the manifold sufferings? By what meritorious deeds may one return to the human realm?"

The commentary explains: The Dao Lord, moved by compassion for beings sunk in hell, posed this question once more to establish fields of merit, urging filial sons and obedient descendants to recall the agony of their departed ancestors, and loving brothers to remember the plight of their kin lost in suffering. They are to reduce their family wealth to perform acts of salvation. This repeated inquiry serves to exalt and cultivate the fields of merit.

Below, the Heavenly Worthy expounds upon the sins of the damned, their varied types, and the methods of grand offerings for redemption. This section is divided into three parts:
First, it clarifies that the multitude of sinners differ in kind, making their salvation difficult to achieve uniformly.
Second, it presents the *Yuanjiao Record*, guiding those who seek refuge and veneration.
Third, it describes the rituals to be observed by the assembly, encouraging emulation.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "These sinners have committed countless transgressions, and their offenses are not of a single type. If one seeks to save them, the methods cannot be the same. No single person’s effort suffices to deliver them all."

This is the first part, explaining that the multitude of sinners differ in kind, making their salvation difficult to achieve.

The Heavenly Worthy continued: "As their karmic roots follow them, their sinful roots are hard to uproot. Only by establishing merit and cultivating fields of virtue—without broad vows and unwavering resolve, without ample merit—can one atone for sins and dispel calamities. If relying solely on one person’s strength, how can the multitude of evildoers be saved? Thus, those who commit evil are difficult to rescue unless they widely cultivate karmic conditions and broadly establish fields of merit. Without relying on collective causes, how can one hastily achieve deliverance? Since merit is required, what kind should be performed?"

Next, the text explains the nature of such merit.

One should follow the *Great Offering of the Mysterious Capital* on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Zhongyuan Festival, when the Earth Official conducts his review. He selects the multitude, distinguishing good from evil. All the great sages of the heavens descend to the palaces, determining the kalpas and examining the records of humans and ghosts. The prisoners and hungry ghosts assemble as one.

This is the second part, guiding those who seek refuge and veneration.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke of the Three Yuan Assemblies, also recounting the reasons for the Nine Bureaus’ investigations. He fully explained the morning of the search, detailing how the various officials assess good and evil, so that future generations may follow the example of the *Great Offering of the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Capital* on these Three Yuan days. Each should make offerings to the Three Generations of Heavenly Worthies, the saints of the ten directions, the Nine Ancestors and Seven Generations, and all beings in the Dharma realm, that all may receive the causes of redemption and attain liberation together.

The fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Zhongyuan Festival, when the Earth Official conducts his review. Saints from the ten directions gather in assembly. The Heavenly Official, Water Official, and all the bureaus—five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty-five billion sages—convene to determine the kalpas, examine the severity of sinners’ offenses, and rank them accordingly. On this day, offerings are made to deliver the spirits of deceased parents. What methods should be used?

On that day and night, incense is burned, and lamps are lit to illuminate the nine dark realms of the heavens and the eight gates of eternal night. The *Great Offering of the Mysterious Capital* is performed, modeled after the Jade Capital Mountain. Flowers and fruits of all kinds are gathered, arranged in five colors. All the rare and wondrous treasures of the world, sacred implements, precious objects, patterned silks, brocades, toys, garments, ten kinds of banners and canopies, jeweled parasols, and adornments for offerings—along with delicacies, fine foods, and fragrant hundred-flavored dishes—are presented to the assembled saints and Daoist masters.

The commentary states: This is the third part, demonstrating the rituals of devotion and encouraging emulation.

The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. Banners and canopies are made from interwoven five-colored silks to adorn the offerings. Seeing the hell-bound sinners suffering for kalpas uncounted, the Heavenly Worthy commands filial children to gather all the rare and wondrous treasures of the human realm, modeling them after the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Capital, to make offerings to the saints of the ten directions and Daoist masters, thereby rescuing the spirits of the departed from the sufferings of hell.

One should vow that the Nine Ancestors and Seven Generations, and all beings in the Dharma realm, may rely on the causes of these offerings and be protected by the karmic rewards of heaven. How should the saints of the ten directions and the Daoist masters perform merit on this day?

On that day and night, this scripture is expounded, and the great saints of the ten directions chant the sacred verses in unison. The prisoners and hungry ghosts are thereby liberated, all sated and freed from suffering, returning to the human realm. Without such efforts, redemption is difficult to achieve.

The commentary explains: The Heavenly Worthy extensively expounded these methods, hoping to encourage and instruct. Fearing that those of true faith are few, he repeatedly entrusted these teachings. At every command for the Great Offering, he instructed that masters be invited to perform purification rites and expound the scripture day and night in six periods.

The "day and night" refers to the night of the fifteenth day of the seventh month. On this day, purification rites are held, lectures are given, incense is burned, and lamps are lit to illuminate the nine dark realms of the heavens and the eight gates of suffering. The "nine dark realms" are the nine hells, and the "eight gates" are the eight gates of calamity, where beings endure punishment.

On these Three Yuan days, the *Great Offering* is performed in imitation of the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Capital, presenting all the rare and wondrous fruits and fragrant hundred-flavored delicacies of the human realm as offerings to the Three Treasures. Thereupon, the saints of the ten directions and the Daoist masters, moved by these sacred words, chant and recite, their voices ascending to the nine billion heavens and descending to the six heavens. The sinners in hell are all liberated at once.

When I pass into the past, the goodness of the East shall not be absolute, nor shall the evil of the West be profound. The noble ones of苦 County shall journey to the Great Qin. After thirty-six thousand years from the era of the Supreme Sovereign, this kalpa shall reach its end, heaven and earth shall crumble, and all people shall suffer in the fires of tribulation.

The *Scripture* states: When the Heavenly Worthy spoke this sutra, He declared that after His passing, those who propagate the teachings shall arise in succession, generation after generation, with sagely and enlightened kings perpetuating the Three Treasures. "The goodness of the East shall not be absolute, nor shall the evil of the West be profound" means that the East is not entirely good without evil, nor is the West entirely evil without goodness. The "noble ones of苦 County" refer to Lord Lao’s incarnate form, born from the Mysterious Jade Maiden, who cut open her left armpit in苦 County of Chen Commandery—hence the name苦 County. At the moment of His birth, He walked nine steps in each of the four directions, and upon speaking, pointed to a plum tree as His surname, declaring, "Above heaven and below heaven, I alone am revered." Then, nine dragons surged forth from the earth, spouting water to bathe Him. Where the dragons emerged, nine wells formed, which remain visible to this day.

It is also said: Lord Lao’s incarnate form appeared within the burning house of the Three Realms and the苦 sea of suffering—this, too, is a "苦 County." "Journey to the Great Qin" refers to the alternate name for the Western land of Tianzhu. "Journey" means "to go." Lord Lao traveled west to the Flowing Sands, reaching the land of Yanzhin, where He propagated the teachings of the *futu* to transform the barbarian customs. Thus, the *Book of the Later Han* states: "Lord Lao expounded the *futu* sutras to transform the barbarian customs." The *futu* teachings emphasize purity and stillness, and the *futu* sutras of today’s Buddhist tradition were originally spoken by Lord Lao. However, due to the ignorance of the monastic community, they recklessly added false interpretations and distorted meanings. The sages of former times were misled, and later generations further fabricated falsehoods, turning truth into deception. Through mutual influence, the teachings of simplicity and sincerity became corrupted. As ornate literature flourished, deceit and falsehoods multiplied. The pure and simple dissolved, and the false and deceptive bloomed like flowers.

In the Wujie world, men and women, by nature and habit stingy and greedy, upon death become hungry ghosts. Their souls and spirits suffer hunger, yet when food is offered, it transforms into dust. The Commentary states: Those who have not severed their false and deceptive ways, who engage solely in deceit—*Wujie world* is the name of this realm, also called the *Jambudvīpa* realm. Yet the beings of this land, deluded by distortions and perversions, entangled in confusion and chaos, grow stingy and greedy, discriminating between self and others. Upon death, they become hungry ghosts as retribution for past transgressions. The food they are given turns to dust before their eyes, inedible. Through vast kalpas, they endure bitter suffering, mired in torment and sinking into perdition. They revolve through the Five Paths, repaying past enmities.

Now, I declare this to you: you should heed it well. In future lives, men and women must rouse themselves with diligence, exerting effort to refine their conduct, lest they become the cause of sin. The Commentary states: *Hao* means vast. It speaks of enduring as hungry ghosts through immeasurable kalpas. Even if they complete their punishment and are reborn, they return to lowly families, cycling endlessly through the Five Paths, never attaining sagehood. The Five Paths are: the Heavenly Path, the Human Path, the Animal Path, the Hell Path, and the Hungry Ghost Path.

The Heavenly Worthy further exhorts and instructs the Dao Lord: in future lives, men and women must discipline themselves, rousing their minds with diligence, and not become the cause of sin. *Sins* here refer to karmic offenses. Just as one reaps what one sows in the fields, so too do good and evil deeds yield corresponding retribution—like planting in spring and harvesting in autumn. Thus, it is called the *field of sin*.

At that time, the Most High Dao Lord, having received the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, bowed in reverence and spoke these verses. This is called the *Division of the Dao*. *At that time* refers to the moment when the Heavenly Worthy, having concluded the teaching of the cause, entrusted it to the Dao Lord. Having heard the Heavenly Worthy expound this great scripture of deliverance and salvation, and having received admonitions for both present and future lives—earnest teachings disseminated to guide all beings—the Most High Dao Lord bowed before the Heavenly Worthy, praising the sublime teaching and reverently receiving its wondrous decree, his joy beyond words. As the virtue was inconceivable, he then spoke these verses:

In past lives, our karmic affinity met,
Now we behold the Heavenly Worthy’s face.
First, the kalpas of the present were revealed,
Then the transgressions of future kalpas told.

The Commentary states: The Dao Lord, overjoyed, thus composed these verses to praise the Heavenly Worthy. Through past and present lives, their Dao affinity converged, allowing him to personally receive the supreme teaching and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy. He was further instructed in the causes of deliverance, entrusted with transmission, and charged to swiftly turn the Wheel of the Dao, vowing to practice diligently without laziness. Both past and future kalpas have been graced by the Dao’s benevolence.

The verse on *future kalpas’ transgressions* states: The Dao Lord, in his future incarnation, admonishes beings against the sins of greed, anger, and delusion. Those consumed by greed hoard wealth, endlessly seeking possessions, indulging in arrogance and extravagance, each flaunting their splendor. They do not cultivate merit, their hearts lacking compassion, unmindful of all beings. In this life, they fail to establish fields of blessings; after death, they sink into evil paths. Such retribution is certain and unerring. All this suffering stems from past lives’ failure to cultivate good deeds, and in future lives, they will endure its calamities. Such are the profound transgressions of future kalpas.

Diligently practice the supreme Dao,
Lest it become the enemy of conditioned existence.
Greed breeds great calamity,
Anger and delusion are the roots of disaster.

The Commentary states: This verse admonishes against the sins of greed, anger, and delusion. The Dao Lord, wishing to awaken the deluded masses, composed these verses to elucidate the roots of causes and conditions, the sources of fortune and misfortune. Greed is the affliction that burdens the body; anger and delusion are the roots of ruin. Thus, he briefly expounded their origins, urging their severance.

The Dao Lord, having expounded the Heavenly Worthy’s teaching, further elaborated: wealth, sensuality, fame, and profit are the sources of calamity; greed, anger, and delusion are the roots of self-destruction. How could one cultivate the true while obstructing the Human Path, or even lose the field of blessings? If one can prevent the Three Poisons from arising and keep the Six Roots pure, this is the path to cultivating life. Untainted by worldly dust, it becomes the bridge to deliverance from suffering. What disaster could then arise?

Sever the hindrance of afflictions,
And the Three Actions will naturally be at peace.
Demonic forces cannot disturb,
How could one suffer the hardships of hell?

The Commentary states: Afflictions arise from the Three Actions; demonic disturbances stem from the Six Roots. Yet if one embraces the Dao and guards the true, how could worldly dust contaminate them? The inception of a disturbed mind begins with sensual desire; the cause of hell lies in deviant lust. To sever afflictions, one must attain tranquility. Seeking the cause of eternal joy lies in keeping the Six Roots unstained.

If one practices the Heavenly Worthy’s teachings and, on the great offering days of the Mysterious Capital, makes offerings to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, they will wander before the Golden Gates, forever free from the sufferings of hell. They will roam the Jasper Gardens, stride through the Seven Jeweled Parks, freely indulging in desirelessness, bowing in reverence to the Heavenly Worthy.

The Commentary states: The Dao Lord declared that if, in future times, people observe the Three Primordials by holding fasts and establishing lectures, following the rites of the Mysterious Capital’s offerings to make offerings to the Great Sages of the Ten Directions and the Daoist masters, their merit will be accomplished and their deeds manifest. They will become Heavenly Worthies, journeying through the Western Jade Realm of the Upper Realm, where treasures are inexhaustible. The departed souls of the past will all escape suffering, avoiding the Three Wretched Paths. Below, it describes how the assembly of sages rejoices and circumambulates.

At that time, the assembly of sages from the Ten Directions, having heard the Heavenly Worthy’s wondrous Dharma and the causes of deliverance—hearing what they had never heard before and awakening to what they had never awakened to—joined their voices in praise, rejoicing and reverently practicing. They chanted the *Step of Emptiness*, circumambulating in reverence, bowing in homage and gratitude, extolling the Heavenly Worthy. After the Most High Dao Lord and the assembly of sages from the Ten Directions had spoken their verses, what further exhortations did the Heavenly Worthy offer?

The Most High Dao Lord and the assembly of great sages from the Ten Directions, having recited their verses, the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed: On the days of the Three Primes, this scripture must be expounded, its rites diligently practiced, and homage paid with reverence. Perform the Six-Hour Circumambulation, purify yourself with fragrant waters, abstain from food after noon, maintain inner and outer tranquility, embrace simplicity and non-action, refrain from worldly affairs, first receive the Ten Precepts, calm the mind and seal the senses, contemplate the divine and meditate upon the Real, and visualize the abiding Dharma.

At that moment, the assembly of sages bowed as one, entreating to receive the precepts.

Commentary: Here, the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, once more offers exhortations, further proclaiming the precepts and the rites for their observance. Though the sages perpetually cultivate pure conduct, abiding in clarity and free from desire, untouched by defilement, their purpose is to instruct the common and deliver the ignorant. Thus, on this day, with earnest guidance, the precepts are again expounded, commanding protection, purification through fasting, contemplation of the divine, and meditation upon the Real. Day and night, uphold and maintain them, dwell in mindfulness of the Three Treasures, and in the future, attain the Dao, behold the Heavenly Worthy, and wander in the Jade Capital, at ease within the Golden Towers. Such is the merit of establishing lectures and fasting on the Three Prime days to deliver the departed—thus is the blessing attained.

Having proclaimed the precepts, what is their text?

The Heavenly Worthy declared:

The first precept: Do not kill living beings or make licentious sacrifices to the six heavenly spirits and ghosts.
The second precept: Do not steal or commit wrongdoing by taking others’ property.
The third precept: Do not delight in beauty and lust, or harbor jealousy and unlawful thoughts.
The fourth precept: Do not engage in false speech or frivolous talk, thereby committing sins of the mouth.
The fifth precept: Do not indulge in wine or sink into drunkenness, acting recklessly without restraint.
The sixth precept: Do not be arrogant and self-righteous, or deceive and slander the multitudes.
The seventh precept: Do not deceive your teacher or betray the Dao, or discard sacred scriptures.
The eighth precept: Do not harbor anger toward the four assemblies or slander Daoist practitioners.
The ninth precept: Do not greedily seek excess, harming others to benefit yourself.
The tenth precept: Do not insult or curse your clan and kin, or disrespect the elderly.

These ten precepts are the great afflictions of the body. Those who violate them will suffer the wind-knives for ten thousand kalpas, forever encountering evil conditions. With a sincere and reverent heart, guide those who come after, diligently practice and listen attentively, and receive them without forgetting their words. If you follow them according to the Dharma, in life you will commit no transgressions, and in death you will not be bound or confined. Heaven will send cloud chariots, and you will naturally attain the Dao.

The commentary states: These are the ten precepts, which are the rituals for cultivation and observance. Those who uphold them will surely attain rebirth among humans and gods, while those who violate them will inevitably sink into hell. If there are good men and good women who can uphold these ten precepts, advance with zealous diligence, and never grow weary in their hearts, their conduct will align with the Dao, and they will never stray from it in life. In life, they will be revered by the teachings, and in death, they will ascend to the Upper Clarity, riding cloud chariots, coming and going without obstruction, transcending the Three Realms, and attaining a vajra body. If one violates them, they will sink into the five sufferings, pass through the three evil destinies, walk upon sword trees and blade mountains, constantly compelled to tread them, driven and hurried by ox-headed hell wardens. Their flesh will scatter like stars, their bones dissolve like rain, and for ten thousand kalpas they will suffer without a moment’s respite, forever encountering evil conditions, facing enmity with enmity. Those who transgress the scriptures and violate the precepts will reap misfortune in hell. Those who cultivate according to the Dharma will receive joy in heaven.

Thereafter, the Most High Lord of the Dao further inquired about the rites of the Three Prime Fasts. The following text presents how to make the invocation.

The Most High Lord of the Dao bowed his head in reverence and said: The meaning of the Middle Prime Fast has already been fully heard. I have yet to learn the proper forms for the Upper and Lower Primes.

The commentary states: The rites of the Three Prime Fasts are all contained in the scriptures. The Most High Lord of the Dao, fearing that future generations would be ignorant and fail to comprehend, posed this lofty question again, hoping to receive what had not yet been heard. In this assembly, he earnestly requested once more. The Heavenly Worthy’s response is as follows.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: These Three Prime Fasts are determined and recorded in the Three Registers, the essential texts of the Numinous Treasure. The fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Prime, when the Heavenly Official conducts his review. The fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Prime, when the Water Official conducts his review. Their jurisdictions differ.

The commentary states: This is the Heavenly Worthy’s explanation of the origins of the Three Primes. These Three Prime rites are determined and recorded in the Three Registers, derived from the essential texts of the Numinous Treasure. Their jurisdictions differ because the Upper Prime’s Left Bureau governs life, and the Fire Official of the Great Yang conducts the review. The Lower Prime’s Right Bureau governs death, and the Water Official of the Great Yin conducts the review. The Middle Prime governs the registers of life and death, all matters of sin and merit for the prisoners of hell, and the trials of the wind-knives. Each oversees the inspection of ninety thousand beings, encompassing all twelve months. The Middle and Lower Primes share two bureaus. As for the incense circumambulation, it is performed to distinguish the Upper Prime’s knowledge of life and the Lower Prime’s knowledge of death. Since their jurisdictions differ, they are not the same—hence it is said their jurisdictions differ.

Now, what is expounded here is the Great Offering of the Dark Capital on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, which oversees both the Upper and Lower Primes. Thus, it is fitting to observe it.

The commentary states: This means the Middle Prime encompasses and reconciles the Upper and Lower Primes, reviewing all matters together. The hungry ghosts and imprisoned spirits are all addressed on this day. However, the Middle Prime Dao of this day encompasses the Upper and Lower Primes, and its merit is the greatest. Therefore, the rites of the Great Offering of the Dark Capital are performed to deliver the departed. Thus, it does not mention the Heavenly or Water Officials but only the Middle Prime, for it is the Earth Official of the Middle Prime. The Earth Official resides in the center, and the center is the correct color. Therefore, the Middle Prime is invoked to encompass the Upper and Lower. Moreover, by autumn, all things reach maturity, so the direction of metal is taken as the time of ripeness. Thus, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the day of the Middle Prime, is chosen for the offering. Furthermore, on this day, all hungry ghosts and sinful spirits are released. On the day of the Middle Prime’s teachings and precepts, at the dawn of the Great Offering of the Dark Capital, one must establish merit, observe the fast, perform the Dao, expound the scriptures, make offerings to the Three Treasures, and deliver the departed. At this time, the prisoners of hell all receive blessings. Those who observe these rites will enjoy prosperity, while those who neglect them will incur misfortune.

The commentary states: If the Heavenly Worthy partakes in the Great Offering, the blessings are boundless. If one treats the Great Offering lightly, misfortune will befall them for ten thousand kalpas.

Upon hearing this, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, the Flying Heavenly Kings, and the seven thousand two hundred and forty youths all rejoiced together, bowed in reverence, and departed.

The commentary states: The supreme sages, moved by compassion, always seek to deliver beings. In proclaiming the wondrous Dharma and illuminating the mysterious teachings, how could they not rejoice upon hearing these sublime words? Thus, with devout hearts and exuberant spirits, they bowed and departed, each returning to their respective realms to diligently teach and transform.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes of the Numinous Treasure: The Great Offering of the Jade Capital and the Dark Capital* concludes here.

Here follows the corrected scriptural passage:

For ten thousand kalpas, they shall not escape, bound in the prisons of the Dark Capital, where they will suffer the torments of the Five Evils. Their bodies shall be fettered and shackled, their necks clamped in iron collars, their waists bound with iron chains, their hands and feet locked in iron manacles. Day and night, they shall endure the lash of whips and the strike of cudgels, their flesh torn and their bones shattered, their blood flowing like rivers, their cries of anguish shaking the earth. Even if they die, they shall be reborn only to suffer again, never to emerge.

Moreover, their minds shall be afflicted with madness and confusion, their bodies stricken with sores and ulcers, their limbs twisted and deformed. In future lives, they shall be reborn as the lowliest of beasts, their bodies pierced by iron rods that never leave them. If they have deceived and misled others for their own gain, they shall fall into the realm of venomous creatures, where they shall be stung and devoured. If they have hoarded wealth and refused to give, they shall suffer eternal hunger and thirst, forced to drink the essence of fire and eat the ashes of charcoal. If they have harmed living beings, they shall be reborn as livestock, their bodies butchered and their flesh consumed. If they have severed the bonds of kinship, their descendants shall be cut off, and they shall wander as solitary ghosts, never to find rest.

The commentary states: These are the consequences of transgressing the precepts and violating the Dao. The fields of sin bear such bitter fruit, and none may escape their due retribution.

The Heavenly Worthy then spoke in verse:

Those who break the precepts and defile the Dao
Shall fall into the prisons of the Dark Capital,
Where they shall suffer the Five Evils’ torment,
Bound in iron, their flesh rent and torn.
Their cries shall shake the earth,
Yet none shall hear their pleas.
Even in death, they shall not escape,
But be reborn to suffer anew.
Their minds shall be clouded with madness,
Their bodies stricken with sores.
In future lives, they shall be beasts,
Their flesh pierced by iron rods.
If they have deceived others,
They shall fall among venomous creatures.
If they have hoarded wealth,
They shall hunger and thirst eternally.
If they have harmed living beings,
They shall be butchered as livestock.
If they have severed kinship,
Their descendants shall be cut off,
And they shall wander as solitary ghosts,
Never to find peace.

Thus, on the three prime mornings—the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months—when the Earth Official reviews the registers, distinguishing good from evil, the divine sages and immortals of all heavens shall gather in the Palace of Numinous Flowers to examine the records of kalpas and the ledgers of wicked ghosts and prisoners.

On these days, the world should purify their chambers and dwellings, burning incense and lighting lamps at night. At that time, they should make vows to illuminate the heavens and the nine dark realms of the Eight Gates. They should emulate the divine sages and perfected ones, performing the Great Offering of the Dark Capital upon the Jade Capital Mountain. From the lower realms, they should gather the finest flowers and fruits, all the rare delicacies and sweet nectars of the world, along with banners, canopies, and jeweled parasols, to adorn and present as offerings. With sincere hearts, they should make distant offerings to the assembled sages and all Daoist masters.

On these nights, they should recite this scripture, wishing to extend blessings to their nine generations of ancestors, their seven generations of parents, all their kin, and even others. Through repentance of sins and earnest devotion, the imprisoned and hungry ghosts shall be liberated, granted food and satiation, freed from all suffering, and reborn among humans to enjoy happiness according to their karma. Without such efforts, none may be redeemed.

At the Hall of Jade: Based on the preceding and following context, this should read "the descent of the divine birth."

Then he spoke these verses:

*(The Dunhuang manuscript reads: "Then he spoke this hymn.")*
*(The Dunhuang manuscript omits the lines: "First recounting the transgressions of this kalpa, / Then foretelling the faults of the kalpa to come.")*

*(Note: "二云" should read "一云" based on the preceding and following context.)*

---

At that time, the sacred assemblies of the ten directions all attained awakening, rejoicing as one. They bowed their heads, received the command, and withdrew.

*(The Dunhuang manuscript significantly condenses the text from "At that time" to the end of the scroll, rendering it simply as: "At that time, the sacred assemblies of the ten directions all attained awakening, rejoicing as one. They bowed their heads, received the command, and withdrew."—a total of twenty characters.)*
