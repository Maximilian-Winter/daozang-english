**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Eight Might’s Summons of the Dragon, Scroll One**

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning spoke:
At the dawn of Crimson Clarity, when the primordial chaos first divided, the primordial net flowed and unfolded. What the Most High composed in the obscure darkness of the Dragon Han era shone with the radiance of crimson script—natural celestial writ, subtle and beyond discourse. Dwelling in the profoundest mystery, it was named *Sea Perfection*, the Dragon King Elder. The King of Sea Perfection, for the sea holds truth, resides at its center, veiled by stellar qi, and is called *Mystic Source*. The one hundred and eighty numinous seas each contain over ten thousand vast springs, their waters connected to the water sacs, surging forth to form the thirty-two lesser heavens.

When the time of destruction drew near, mountains and seas tilted as one. The Eight Might spewed forth poison; water and fire threatened to arise. The revolving wheels of the sea spun wildly; peaks and ridges shattered violently. Dragons plunged into abysses; flood dragons and serpents churned the ocean depths. The Dragon King’s attendants, the Three Officials, and the various lords, each following the Dao, recorded and proclaimed the *Great Mystery*. Sea Perfection wrought chaos among the seas, sealing the cavern gates.

The Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the Primordial Most High Perfected One, summoned the Eight Might and subdued the Dragon King. Within the crimson-script jade incantations lie texts that can deliver beings from life and death, the crawling and flying multitudes. Their luminous efficacy is to be treasured and concealed, for they avert calamities and exorcise misfortunes. Practiced for a thousand days, they yield results. On the *jian* and *zi-wu* days of the established year, perform the Daoist rites: burn incense, circumambulate while reciting the scripture, and invoke the Eight Might. The Dragon King Elder, upon hearing the scripture, rejoices, bows his head, and closes his eyes. Those who receive the summons scripture shall encounter no calamities or misfortunes.

At the eight solar terms, ascend the mountains; in the four seasons, cast offerings into the abyss. When great or small kalpas arrive, cast the talisman into the ford. The Dragon King shall receive and welcome you; the Bird Mother shall guide and escort you. Ascend to Jade Capital, where you shall be upheld by the Jade Emperor.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning spoke:
The thirty-two heavens contain one hundred and eighty seas, and there are also thirty-two mountain seas and water sacs. The Dragon King Elder roams and observes within the seas, mountains, caverns, and abysses. Where he sees beings fit for deliverance, where he sees those fit for transcendence, he expounds and composes the *Scripture of the Eight Might’s Summons of the Dragon King to Repel Floods and Extinguish Flames*. Constantly practicing this art, one may attain longevity, escape the corpse, avoid the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, deliver the seven generations of ancestors, and ascend to the Vermilion Mound Forest of the Southern Palace. There, one shall naturally partake of food and drink, and the dead husk shall return to spirit.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, with the Most High Perfected One of Mystic Deliverance, on the eight solar term days ascends the mountains to summon the Dragon King Elders of all seas. Recite the eight covenants, the summons texts, and talismans according to the season.

On the *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) day, use nine inches of green silk. In cinnabar, inscribe the commandery, prefecture, county, village, and year of birth, along with the name of the sealed master: "[So-and-so] bears the Three Departments and Eight Effulgences; the celestial immortals and earthly perfected ever abide within." Petition: "On this *Lichun* day, I submit my name to the *Great Mystery*, erase my name from the register of death, and sever the roots of sin."

On the *Lichun* day, recite the four-directional chants, employing the summons text as before:

Alas! Venerable Dragon Han,
Brave and mighty, exalted spirit-king.
Cavernous abyss, numinous treasures,
Summon the Dragon King Lords.
Demon King, Elder, and Master,
Primordial and sagely divine.
Subdue the might, restrain the eight poisons,
Extinguish floods, halt the flames.
Wander freely, dispersed in emptiness,
Body born of water and fire’s light.
When the great kalpa opens for deliverance,
Eons merge into a single age.

On the *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox) day, recite the summons text and talisman, employing the method as above:

Abyssal depths, the Dragon arrives, venerable,
Water Mother bears the flying clouds.
All empty numinous peaks vanish,
Vast and boundless, none remain.
Crimson seals the Absolute Vessel Ridge,
Eastern Well subdues the Flower Ford.
Mystic harmony, jade maidens,
Numinous consorts, Six Jia persons.
Empty caverns admit no worthies,
Numinous sovereign returns to the Nine Mysteries.
Diligently revere the exalted morning’s work,
To attain deliverance and the honored Dao.

On the *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer) day, use eight inches of crimson silk, inscribing in cinnabar as above:

Crimson radiance, jade script arises,
Great Tenuity, flourishing Yu Luo.
Orthodox light bears cloud effulgences,
Countenance and virtue beyond measure.
Transforming and roaming the human Dao,
Supreme Perfected—who is their home?
Petition to escape the five difficulties,
Subdue and summon all celestial demons.
Dragon King emerges, talisman in mouth,
All seas turn to dust and sand.
Numinous peaks do not collapse,
Blessed lands refine the embryo anew.

On the *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice) day, use eight inches of crimson silk, inscribing as above:

Vacuous Sovereign bears the numinous flight,
Above the Nine Mysteries of Great Empyrean.
Wind and clouds conceal subtleties,
Expounding and reciting the Five Peaks’ artisans.
Blessed lands lie in river gorges,
Numinous mountains hold cavernous sanctuaries.
Immortal fungi, myriad wondrous medicines,
Refined and ingested, birth radiant countenance.
Distribute the many treasure gardens,
Pearls and jades guard the numinous treasuries.
Tridacna, refined beryl,
Amber, vajra mirrors.

On the *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn) day, use six inches of white silk, inscribing as above:

Resplendent, the Great White Star,
Towering, the lofty and jagged ridge.
Dragon King breaches the Celestial River,
All seas unite at once.
The thirty-two celestial perfected,
Each bears the *Scripture of the Mighty Dragon*.
Passing beyond the later Dragon Han,
Scholars ascend to Jade Clarity.
Contemplating and expelling poisonous beasts,
Rinsing fragrance to bathe cap tassels.
Vast and boundless, endless cliffs,
Profound and distant, the great numinous.

On the *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox) day, use six inches of white silk, inscribing as above:

Kalpas turn among the heavens,
The great image no longer arises.
The Venerable Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions,
Ultimately named the Perfected in form.
The Three Caverns uphold the Dao’s origin,
True and wondrous, the Most High scriptures.
Bearers enter emptiness,
Reciting and chanting, all attain Great Clarity.
The Dao is the honored within the true,
Delivering to endless ages.
The supremely true returns to non-being,
Cultivating and studying, soar to Highest Clarity.

On the *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) day, use five inches of black silk, inscribing as above:

Numinous birds disorder the Dragon Han,
Phoenix and flood dragon no longer descend.
Blessed heads, the Three Terraces’ abodes,
Named and ranked, true sorrow forgotten.

Scholars of the sacred peaks who bear their satchels and seek masters,
With these they wander in joyful pilgrimage,
Dispelling demons through recitation of the Luminous Mirror.
The Three Origins trace to the Primordial Ancestor,
Who expounds and invokes the Dragon Kings.
The Eight Might’s poisonous qi disperses,
All seas remain calm, no surging waves.

On the Winter Solstice day, use five inches of black silk, inscribing as above:

Great radiance illumines the ten directions,
All heavens tremble on the verge of collapse.
The numinous work, great vehicle’s origin,
All seas erupt in towering waves.
Above, it founds the Jade Capital’s base,
Below, it reaches the abyssal caverns’ realm.
All creatures—wriggling, flying, crawling—
Follow the path in their every movement.
The host of demons gird themselves anew,
Receiving precepts, cultivating the precious scriptures.
Revolving, transforming by nature,
Their forms embrace both being and non-being.

Recite at the eight solar terms, each according to its season.

**Method for the Four Seasons’ Summons**
On the days of the four seasons—spring *jiayin*, summer *jiawu*, autumn *jiashen*, winter *jiazi*—cast a water tablet. Use one golden dragon and two azure pearls. For waters flowing west to east, this is the source of the numinous sea. Face directly north, recite the contract three times, linking dragon and pearls together. Inscribe in cinnabar on green silk and place in the water. Further exhort the One Hundred Eighty Great Perfected of the Numinous Sea and the Eight Might: do not release poison. The Dragon Kings will receive the talisman, and their response will be immediate. If no form appears, this water will naturally produce strange sounds and surging waves—this is the numinous. After thirty-two years of cultivation, the Eight Might will come to welcome you, with the Dragon Kings leading the way.

**Additional Summons Ritual for the Exhortation Text**
The Three Origin Lords of Grand Mystery, Grand Simplicity, and Grand Tenuity; the Primordial Highest Perfected; the Celestial Master of the Upper Realm; the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony; the Numinous Consorts; and I, so-and-so, having previously sealed the Spirit King of such-and-such sea, now guard the abyssal passage against celestial floods. Today, on this day of such-and-such season, I present a golden dragon and azure pearls to honor my late lord, beseeching that my name be entered in the Emperor’s register and my root of death be excised.

Cast the water tablet on the four seasonal days, inscribing in cinnabar on green paper. Face north and recite the four contracts in the Brahmā voice:

**First Hymn: The Three Origin Lords**
The Supreme Cavern Mystery scriptures,
The Three Origins’ numinous treasure, true.
The Primordial One utters the jade decree,
The ancient words of highest antiquity.
The Eight Might’s poisonous qi,
Exterminates demonic worldly dust.
The true Dao holds emptiness and profundity,
Lofty and wondrous, honored qi of origin.
In the blink of an eye, six kalpas pass,
Ascending the body to join Grand Mystery.
One hundred eighty seas boil,
The Dragon Han opens its floodgates.
Abyssal passages link all rivers’ heads,
Where birds and humans root in sacred peaks.
Flood dragons, beasts, jiao, and whales,
Vast and boundless, guard the cavern texts.
Beholding the aspiring transcendents,
Their paths emit flames and smoke.
Hastening the net of Yu Yi,
Gathering the dawn’s radiant essence.
The yang light no longer shines,
The yin essence no longer gleams.
The hundred-six and yang-nine are exhausted,
Great and small kalpas alternate anew.

**Second Hymn: The Three Origin Lords**
The Eight Might and Dragon Kings,
Abide in the world without birth or surname.
From qi they spew eight poisons,
Not sparing those without the Dao.
The foolish kind, unwashed away,
All assemble in the Five Sufferings’ court.
Corpses lie across the lands,
White bones strewn upon the roads.
The sacred peaks teem with worldly filth,
All are ministers of sorrow and vexation.
In life, they did not cultivate the scriptures,
Hearing the Dharma, their ears did not feast.
Diligently strive to extinguish the dull-witted,
All wriggling, flying, myriad beings.
For offenses received in former lives,
Now I beseech to be absolved of guilt.

**Third Hymn: The Primordial Highest Perfected**
Vast and boundless, the Dragon Han’s abode,
Hazy and obscure, the sacred peaks’ darkness.
Distant and endless, the heavens’ palaces,
From chaos the primordial qi was born.
Silent and still, the secluded cavern palace,
Towering and steep, the numinous perfected’s court.
Soaring and drifting, the lofty immortals,
Their pure admonitions inscribe their original work.
Dragon scales dwell in abyssal sources,
Tigers and leopards hide in rugged fields.
No sight of students seeking the ultimate master,
Only echoes of careless, idle voices.
Hungry, they swallow primordial qi,
Thirsty, they drink the mysterious jade essence.
Nurturing their withered bones,
To endure through endless ages.

**Fourth Hymn: The Celestial Master of the Upper Realm**
The boundless and open palace of the primordial void,
Recitation and revelation, vast and without shore.
The constellations all overturn at once,
Stars and planets transform and flee.
The root of the forbidden origin, vast and wild,
The *Dinghuang* without stable foundation.
Sinking and floating, turning by fate,
Scorching and withering each in their time.
The dawn of non-being, without end,
After ten thousand kalpas, it returns anew.
Human flesh, life’s fleeting breath,
The ultimate Dharma delivers me from calamity.
Returning to the path of the Void Sovereign,
A hundred million years are but a single moment.
Bearing the Eight Might’s talismans,
To dispel the eight elemental disasters.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, accompanied by the Dragon King Elder, the Perfected of the Dragon Han, the Eight Might leading the way, dragon scales and tiger-leopards, lions and apotropaic beasts, flood dragons and phoenixes, swans and egrets in harmonious flocks, all come to assemble in the Seven Treasures Palace of the Terrace of Southern Yang. Above, they gaze upon Hong Ya.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Emptiness and Tranquility expounded the Eight Might Dragon Scripture’s talismanic texts, charts, hymns, and recitations, bestowing them upon the unenlightened. Those who clearly follow the secret transmission rites, receiving the precious jade, must guard it closely—guard it closely. To leak it lightly is to invite the destruction of one’s body.

**Eight Might Talismanic Text**
When performing the Numinous Treasure Retreat, bear this talismanic chapter. All Perfected will come to guide you, and demon kings will not interfere.

**Method for the Eight Might Talismanic Text**
Use true sandalwood, eight inches long and four inches wide. Encase it in white brocade, one foot long and four inches wide, and store it in a pouch. During the retreat, wear it on the body: the Three Divisions’ eight spirits on the left, the talismanic text on the right. The cinnabar characters inside the talisman must be square and precise.

In the primordial age, the Most High Original Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning, the First-Born Primordial Lord, the Primordial Essence Supreme Perfected, the Supreme Essence Primordial Unity Lord, the Three Essences Lofty Spirits, the Numinous Treasure Primordial Beginning Lord, the Primordial Beginning Venerable Great Emperor, the Jade Clarity Divine Master and Radiant Yang Master, the Grand Clarity Jade Calendar Supreme Perfected Great Sage Great Immortal Lord, the Five Marchmounts Earth Immortals, and the Numinous Mountain Dao Lord—this humble one, born in [such-and-such] commandery, county, village, and hamlet, belonging to [such-and-such] celestial realm, governed by [such-and-such] constellation, and enfeoffed as [such-and-such] Marchmount Master and [such-and-such] Official Daoist—prostrates in reverence.

Having heard of the Eight Might Divine Talismanic Text, used to summon the Dragon Kings, and of the Primordial Beginning’s nurturing grace, this humble one has been specially favored by the Lofty Perfected, granted enfeoffment and registry in the Celestial Records, with the roots of death excised. Mighty spirits attend in guard, demon hordes retreat, and one may traverse all seas at will, roaming freely as the talismanic writ commands.

**External Talisman of the Talismanic Text**
The true forms of the One Hundred Eighty Sea Essence Dragon Kings and Venerable Ones.
The covenant text for transcending great and minor kalpas, expounded by the Primordial Beginning.

In the primordial age, the Lofty Venerable One, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Primordial Numinous Venerable Master, the Boundless Dao Worthy, the Eastern Mansion Supreme One, the Southern Culmen Venerable One, the Western Numinous Grotto Mother, the Northern Mysterious Perfected One, the Central Palace Supreme Emperor, and the Yellow Venerable Primordial Lord—together they roamed the assembly at the Abyssal Confluence, traversing the myriad heavens and the Dragon-Han interval. In clarity and quiescence, they recorded the revolutions of the kalpas and the reckoning of transcendence.

The Multitude of Origins dispatched the Mysterious Harmony Jade Maidens and Numinous Consorts, twelve each, bearing the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure texts for great and minor kalpas, the Eight Might Talismanic Text for summoning the Dragon Kings, transforming the hollow emptiness, refining the true spirits, guiding and leading the living diagrams, and pacifying the Twenty-Four Perfected Spirits. This scripture, most exalted and wondrous, was conferred upon the White Stone Cavernous Mystery Transcendent Realized One, who studied and transmitted it to the Lofty Supreme Dao Lord. The Lord transmitted it to the Jade Immortal Metal Mother, who passed it to the Most High Lady Li; she to the Northern Culmen Venerable Master, who transmitted it to the Radiant Yang Master, who in turn passed it to the Grand Harmony King Lord. These lords and their disciples studied it through countless Dragon-Han kalpas, then returned to their cavernous abodes, concealing themselves and no longer emerging. Of those who studied the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure scriptures, not one in a hundred succeeded.

In the era of the Supreme August One, the Lofty Venerable Master expounded it, appointing flying immortals as seed-sent envoys to bear the thirty-six divisions of wondrous scriptures of the Primordial Beginning Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Age, sealing and depositing them in the grottoes of the Five Marchmounts and Numinous Mountains. Those of utmost virtue in the world may perceive its texts of their own accord.

On the eleventh day of the seventh month, the first year of the Cheng Emperor’s reign in the Eastern Jin, the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure descended, opening the cavernous scriptures and expounding the Dharma to deliver beings. Thereupon, they conferred this scripture upon the Cheng Emperor. Ascending the Ten Perils, they left its texts in the world to transform and deliver all, illuminating the secret transmission.

The Cheng Emperor received the scriptures for great and minor kalpas, along with the covenant’s ritual implements: five taels of yellow gold, a pair of gold rings, five-direction patterned silks, a golden dragon, a jade fish, two azure pearls, a censer of broad mountain incense, a ritual mat, ten taels of white silver, and nine attendants for the upper kitchen. The covenant of seven, five, and three was sworn, employing these offerings to invoke the Primordial Numinous Venerable Master and the Primordial August Celestial Worthy.

The altar was erected upon a cliffside, commanding a distant view of numinous springs and removed from worldly folk. Once the altar was complete, the Dharma Master faced east to proclaim the covenant:

The recipient, disciple of [such-and-such] prefecture, born of defiled terrestrial qi and the dull-witted masses, has encountered the Primordial Beginning and been graced by harmonious qi, gaining sight of the wondrous texts. Now, presenting the ritual implements, this humble one petitions for the covenant, swearing by the myriad ancestors.

This disciple, of [such-and-such] commandery, county, village, and hamlet, bearing the name [such-and-such] and the style [such-and-such], aged [such-and-such] years, born beneath the [such-and-such] celestial stem—a defiled vessel, yet graced by numinous harmony, recorded in the Three Origins, nurtured by the Three Caverns—remains ignorant of past lives and the roots of sin, yet awakens to the arts of immortality. Formerly, this humble one sought out the Dharma Master [such-and-such], receiving the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure’s exalted and wondrous scriptures. Their entry and exit are beyond conception; their Dao is most wondrous and precious, beyond the capacity of this humble one’s inferior talents, putrid bones, and foul flesh to bear or recite. Yet, without self-assessment, this one aspires to daily renewal, advancing without retreat.

Having heard of the Primordial Beginning’s expounded teachings on great and minor kalpas, the Eight Might’s summoning of Dragon Kings, the transformation of hollow emptiness, the Twenty-Four Perfected Spirits, the guiding of the Three Luminaries’ cavernous mystery roots, the precious jade’s exaltation, the Cavernous Unity’s truth, and the essential secrets of the Supreme Perfected—truly, these are rarely heard. This humble one prostrates, head bound, begging for accomplishment. Humbly entreating the Illustrious Master to bestow grace and transmission, this one dares not lightly disclose it. After the covenant is sworn, the seven ancestors serve as witnesses, and this one will seal away the precious jade. Should there be any proclamation or careless disclosure, this humble one’s body and household shall atone to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Even unto the ten thousandth extinction, this one dares harbor no resentment.

On [such-and-such] day of [such-and-such] month and year, in [such-and-such] commandery, county, village, and hamlet, the disciple of the Three Caverns and Three Radiance, the Vajra of the Grand Ultimate and Non-Ultimate, the Left-Ruling Divine Supreme Master, the Great Transmitter of the Three Sovereigns and Five Marchmounts, the Northern Marchmount Master and [such-and-such] Official Daoist, the remote descendant and minor portent Realized One [such-and-such], bows twice and prostrates to petition and proclaim:

Supreme petition to the Most High Primordial August Supreme Highest Great Dao Lord, the Primordial Numinous Venerable Master, the Boundless Dao Worthy, the Eastern Mansion Supreme One, the Southern Culmen Primordial Lord Venerable One, the Western Numinous Grotto Mother, the Northern Mysterious Unity Lord, the Central Palace Venerable Master, and the Ten Directions’ Supreme Perfected—this humble servant [such-and-such] petitions the Primordial Lord to manifest the scriptural Dharma and bestow enlightenment.

Now, this humble one [such-and-such] respectfully presents the ritual implements, seeking to behold the scriptural titles. This servant, having departed on [such-and-such] day of [such-and-such] month and year, respectfully sought out the Grotto Master of [such-and-such], the Five Numinous Perfected One and [such-and-such] Palace Daoist of [such-and-such] commandery, county, village, and hamlet, to jointly proclaim the covenant. Precious substances and pearl jades served as tokens, and the thirty-six divisional catalogues were transmitted, separately petitioning the Eight Radiance Divine Perfected for the great and minor kalpas’ revolutions and transcendence, the transformation of hollow emptiness, the circulation through the Five Marchmounts, and the great dwelling of the Numinous Mountain.

Now, the Master of Ceremonies and Libationer [such-and-such] of [such-and-such] prefecture and commandery presents the ritual implements—five-direction patterned silks, golden dragon and jade fish, azure pearls and white silver, ritual mat and incense censer—seeking to proclaim the covenant, receive the transmission of precious secrets, pacify the state and save the people, bringing joy to the land and banishing all woes, to roam the Five Marchmounts.

Wherever one traverses—great rivers and lakes, mountains and streams, valleys and ravines—all the host of spirits come forth to await and welcome, while dragons, scaled beasts, tigers, leopards, lions, and apotropaic guardians ever assemble in attendance. The Perfected of Heaven and Earthly Immortals overshadow one’s body.

Once the ritual of transmission and deliverance is complete, [the adept] such-and-such, following the prescribed observances, humbly petitions the Most High of Antiquity to proclaim to the Thirty-Two Heavens, striking such-and-such’s name from the register of the dead and severing the roots of all transgressions. The disciple then turns toward the east, prostrating one hundred and eighty times and bowing thirty-two times, scattering hair in the four directions.

Such-and-such further petitions the Most Numinous Perfected of the Mystic Grotto-Heaven of such-and-such mountain, seeking to proclaim the covenant of such-and-such scripture. May the Most Numinous Perfected of such-and-such mountain act as sponsor, granting such-and-such a lifespan equal to the Sacred Marchmounts, unwaning through the kalpas.

The disciple recites the proclamation of the covenant:

Boundless, the fathomless cliffs,
Dragons and scaled beasts come forth in welcome.
Beyond the western wanderings of the Water Mother,
The scorching fires no longer harm.
Ascending the Jade Capital’s towers,
One soars aloft, drifting on high.

*End of the Upper Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Eight Mighty Summons of the Dragon, from the Numinous Treasure of the Dao of Supreme Mystery*

*Beginning of the Lower Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Eight Mighty Summons of the Dragon, from the Numinous Treasure of the Dao of Supreme Mystery*

The Lord of the Dao declared: The Most High Primal Lord and the Supreme Emperor of the Boundless Non-Ultimate roamed the Kunlun Jade Capital Mountain, accompanied by the Wondrous Practitioner Perfected, the Supreme Perfected Lord, and the Supreme Perfected Elder, along with twenty-four hundred Perfected Immortals from the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, all descending together.

Thereupon, they invited the Lords of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity to jointly descend upon the Dark Capital Mountain. A host of officials encircled the terrace-palaces, listening to the exposition and discourse of the Dharma.

At that time, the Elder of the Dragon Abyss, known as the Dragon Lord, arrived leading tens of thousands of dragons to attend the Three August Supreme Emperor Lords, listening to the discourse on virtuous teachings and the performance of meritorious deeds. He sighed, extolling the unsurpassed Dao and virtue, inherently exalted in the supreme void beyond the non-ultimate, the great vehicle of the hundred and six kalpas’ deliverance through boundless transformation, exhorting goodness and salvation from the cycle of birth and death, tirelessly guiding and instructing.

There were also ninety-six hundred million paths of the Orthodox and Perfected, all through the accumulation of merit and virtue beyond reckoning, employing the Dao to transform and teach the methods of life, wielding skillful means to universally deliver and eradicate all roots of evil and death. Cultivating the heart of the Four Immeasurables, they rescued those harmed by calamities and misfortunes, where heaven and earth lay withered and the people cried out in distress.

The Dragon Lord then transformed, leading tens of millions of dragons from beyond the Western River’s deserts and the boundless Yu Abyss. Bearing water and riding clouds, they spread across the world, universally bestowing vast rains to moisten and nourish. The spirits of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways universally stirred clouds and mist, shading the heavens and covering the earth, delivering the world from drought and thirst.

Within days, water and land were universally suffused and moistened, valleys and streams filled to overflowing, vast and surging. Then, twenty-four myriad celestial maidens were dispatched from the heavens to escort the Supreme Emperor of the Non-Ultimate, descending beneath the canopy of heaven. They chanted verses and performed dances, circling within the Four Seas, celebrating the joy of the celestial people receiving blessings. The nation enjoyed great peace, and all under heaven rejoiced, their voices harmonizing in unison.

At that time, the Lord of the Great Dao, the Lord of Virtue, and the Supreme Emperor Lord—three august perfected divine beings—along with the lofty sagely Wondrous Practitioner Perfected, the Celestial Thearch, the Supreme August, and myriad billions upon billions of hosts came in person to attend. Innumerable jade lads and maidens, bearing incense and flowers, descended beneath the canopy of heaven to welcome the Three August Ones and Four Perfected, the Lord of the Non-Ultimate, Non-Precedent, and Primal Origin, the Supreme Emperor and Great Divine Lord, the jade lads and maidens, and the jade maidens of incense and flowers. Singing in harmonious chorus, they advanced with the myriad spirits of heaven and earth and the tens of millions of celestial maidens before the thrones of the Three August Supreme Lords, kneeling reverently.

Then, the Dragon Lord led tens of millions of dragons to prostrate before the Supreme Emperor. After a long while, the Dragon Lord addressed the Supreme Emperor, saying: “Since the Three Lords received the mandate of the Three August Ones and the inception of creation, they have not encountered the ninety-six kalpas of the Yang Disaster. Now, after the great drought following the flood, nine thousand nine hundred years have passed. The scorching Yang obscures the abyss, and the Water Mother has fled into hiding. Thus, the withered Yang conceals its radiance beneath the Nine Springs, while the blazing barrier spreads within the Eight Extremities. The myriad people wither and perish, crying out to heaven in lament. Of those parched to death, more than half of the world’s three parts have been consumed, scorched to near extinction. After three years, all wickedness shall be exhausted.”

The Supreme Emperor then summoned the Dragon Lord and commanded the Lord of Yu Abyss to lead tens of millions of dragons to spread the celestial net, bearing water to sprinkle and moisten. Within ten days and a month, those who had withered to death were all revived. In the lands, barely one-tenth of the people remained as survivors. Observing and examining them, they asked by what cause they alone had endured, withered yet not perished.

The survivors said: “We who suffered the cruel drought yet did not perish were precisely those under the scrutiny of the Three Offices. Our ancestors had accumulated meritorious virtue, and their merit extended to us. Moreover, we cultivated ourselves, never straying into wrongdoing, accumulating diligence and piling up virtue, protected by the celestial officials and nurtured by the earth spirits. Thus, scholars such as we should have been ranked among the partial immortals, yet we were unjustly subjected to judgment. When the fires of refinement were first unleashed, the Three Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water reviewed the merits accumulated by our ancestors, which extended to our own bodies. Our meritorious deeds were recorded, our names left in the Southern Palace. When the time of later calamities came, our cases were thrice memorialized. The Lord of the Southern Marchmount and the Envoys of the Blazing Barrier witnessed the grace of deliverance and petitioned the Celestial Thearch and the Envoys of the Fire Pearl. The radiant talismans of the Golden True Tiger and the Majestic Golden刚 of the Great One, along with the luminous Perfected Phoenix Talismans, were invoked to shield and sweep away the flames, allowing the flying embers to disperse. The Immortals and Sages, together with the Great Golden-Mouthed Birds, came to deliver us, enabling us to escape the calamity and survive, a result of our accumulation of virtuous deeds and the response to our good blessings.”

Should one not diligently cultivate fasting and vigilance?

The Dragon Lord said: “The merit of accumulated goodness all arises from the Dao. Those who wish to establish merit and accumulate virtue must rely on the fasts of the Supreme Numinous Three Treasures. Through years and months of tireless practice, the Directors of Destiny memorialize their meritorious deeds to the Upper Heavens. The Celestial Thearch commands the Three Offices to record their achievements, enabling them to transcend the Three Calamities and Five Difficulties. The merit of fasting is especially weighty—how could one not diligently pursue it? The root of all future lives is thus firmly established.”

Now, I have compiled and presented the *Scripture of the Supreme Eight Mighty Summons of the Dragon*. The upper chapter invokes and entreats the dragons, while the lower scroll recounts their origins.

The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao spoke of the cycles of hardship and prosperity, of withering followed by flourishing, and then intoned this ode:

“Vast and boundless, the Dragon Lord,
Endowed with heaven’s supreme numen.
Yet when the Yang-Nine calamity struck,
And the Hundred-Sixth cycle brought ruin,
The myriad people parched and withered,
Dying of thirst in the abyssal pools.
They raised their faces to heaven, sighing,
Pleading for mercy amid the flames of disaster.
Their cries of sorrow and lament
Troubled the radiant Perfected of Heaven.
The Upper Heavens, moved by their plight,
Summoned the Dragon Kings.
But the dragons fled in terror,
Concealing their forms in hidden shadows,
Hiding in the depths of Yu Abyss,
Within the caverns of cliffs and stones.
Then the Eight Mighty Decrees were issued,
Commands intersecting and converging.
‘Let any Dragon Lord
Who bears the girdle of the Five Stars
Strike the cliffs of Yu Abyss—
Let the dragons take flight with roaring cries!’
A thousand myriad came to the rescue,
Receiving merit and renown.
They gathered the Rain Masters,
Weaving clouds over the imperial capital.
For three days and nights,
They cleansed the abyss, restoring purity.
Crops flourished in abundance,
And the myriad people were revived.
The four seasons harmonized,
All enjoying peace and prosperity.”

The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao said: “In praise of the Dragon Lord’s great merit—how majestic is his virtue!”

Those who expound this teaching observe the Five Precepts, as follows:

“With a heart full of compassion, guide many,
And the heavenly Dao will open the dark.
Cherish and protect, dispelling sorrows,
So merit flows to future generations.
The Dao does not fail those who act,
Yet people bring misfortune upon themselves.
Why does fate turn against them?
Good-hearted ones grow desolate.
Diligently urge the cultivation of goodness,
To transcend disasters and grasp salvation.
The Dragon’s might and virtue are vast,
His beneficence bearing heaven’s numen.
Saving and reviving all under heaven,
None fail to receive fortune and glory.
Once the Yang-Nine calamity is averted,
The Hundred-Sixth cycle is pacified.
Withered lands are drenched with blessings,
Turbid afflictions become clear and pure.
The Eight Mighty Commands and decrees,
The precious talismans and the Emperor’s Jade,
All are talismans to subdue poison,
Diminishing the might of demonic hordes.
The Dragon King approaches the riverbank,
The dragons emerge with startled cries.
Merit accumulates, and ten thousand blessings descend;
Long fasts amplify the sound of praise.
None fail to come from goodness,
Their might reaching the Upper Numen.
Fortune descends like thunder from heaven,
The deaf hear, the mute speak.
The blind regain their sight,
The lame rise and walk.
The good are aided by spirits,
The wicked punished by demonic thieves.
The Dao takes goodness as its root,
Virtue takes trust as its light.
Compassion and filial piety—heaven loves them;
Diligence in the Dao keeps fate from toppling.”

The Dao Lord said: “The Dragon Lord’s merit is weighty and great—truly, how excellent! This is the legacy of past deeds that have touched the heart of heaven, and none fail to be moved. How much more so the beauty of the precepts and disciplines expounded by the Divine Perfected and Supreme Perfected!”

The Dao Lord addressed the Dragon Lord: “You have inherited the merit of past lives, your virtue already manifest, becoming a blessing to all. Your recent labors, especially within the Three Treasures, stand as a testament to your merit. Now, heed my precepts and ponder my words, for I shall further expound the primordial methods of the Great Dao. These words are of utmost importance, guiding the cultivation of boundless goodness.”

The Dragon Lord said: “What are these great deeds of goodness? I wish to hear and reflect upon them. I shall receive your precepts anew, proclaim them to the ten directions, and encourage the hearts of goodness, that they may never grow weary.”

Thereupon, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao replied to the Dragon Lord: “There is yet another method for Daoist practitioners of goodness. Such a person, adorned with all auspicious marks, obtains the precious scriptures of the Perfected of the Dao. The Perfected of the Three Sovereigns’ Cavern possess the *Great Precepts of the Supreme Perfected*, the cinnabar talismans and ink registers, along with the *Hidden Writings of the Three Sovereigns of Jade Clarity*, the *Cinnabar Scripture of Supreme Clarity* for flying stones and concealment, and the esoteric arts of the numinous youth’s cinnabar—all are true and authentic. The wondrous subtleties of the Dao are recorded in the primordial registers of heaven and earth; their words are clear. The essentials of ascending as an immortal are most weighty—how could one not diligently pursue them? Cultivate goodness with mindfulness.

The words of the Supreme Dao are the foundation of utmost trust. Great goodness is majestic, governing the lesser vehicle’s methods, which must be restrained and limited. There should be moderation, and moderation must have its bounds. Its might lies in the practice of the greater vehicle, which observes all things. The merit of the Three Treasures enables all beings to progress gradually.

It is said that the Dragon Lord, through the merit of past deeds and accumulated virtue, possesses thirty-three precepts, adhering to the rites of the thirty-two heavens. These precepts all begin with the encouragement of goodness. Furthermore, there are sixteen practices to enhance wisdom and manifest boundless kindness. What are these sixteen practices that augment wisdom?

Bestow goodness upon the multitude, aligning all as if true;
Let precepts be unbroken in word;
Patience is not merely endurance;
Advance with unwavering resolve to attain concentration;
All practices are complete;
Wisdom and sincerity are perfected;
All actions are fulfilled;
Serve as the Dao requires;
Roam in tranquility, delighting in the gate of stillness;
Cultivate the six virtues of the worthy;
Possess the ten virtues;
Adorn body, speech, and mind with virtue, maintaining integrity;
Know contentment, delighting in stillness;
Exhort oneself thrice to advance;
Cultivate inner and outer goodness;
Encourage all virtuous deeds;
And practice the sixteen methods of conduct.
Thus, one receives auspicious fortune,
Develops the mind of great wisdom,
And is rewarded in the era of the Great Dao.
Expound and disseminate wisdom,
Flowing transformation to later generations.

Moreover, the Dragon Lord possesses twenty-two aspects of the heart of good wisdom, also intended to eliminate obstacles and uphold the aspiration of the greater vehicle—lofty and pure. The affairs of Supreme Clarity reject the turbid, suppress the vulgar, avoid idle talk, refrain from improper conduct, cast aside wickedness, grasp wisdom, and cultivate good methods. Thus, the Dao is penetrated, and the Dao is great.”

The Dragon Lord’s majesty has already been established, having entered the Greater Vehicle—how much more so for those of the Supreme Clarity? The Dragon Lord further practices the twenty-two methods, which advance wisdom and inspire the heart, fostering faith and compliance. No demonic officials, heterodox followers, or external deviants can withstand them; they are repelled and driven back. What is meant by "inspiring beyond the hearts of ordinary people"? My heart’s resolve is fierce and steadfast; what it guards is unshakable. With unyielding practice, the heart does not slacken or rest.

When inspired, it is as if the majesty of heaven and earth, the might of spirits and ghosts, the authority over the vulgar and the false, the power over poison and hunting, the dominion over the improper and the inanimate—these eight strategies of awe—take form. Awe is like the unbreakable conduct of the great vajra. The Dao states: The Dragon Lord Perfected possesses twenty-two methods of inspiration, capable of majesty, embodying unwavering and resolute conduct, and manifesting the heart of universal wisdom. All demonic beings, external deviants, and heterodox paths dare not oppose the Dragon Lord’s inspired control.

The Dao does not act in vain; thus, it has its rules and rituals. The Dao says: When rivers and seas surge, the sun scorches, and the four directions are parched, clouds gather to bring rain. When the wind stills and the downpour ceases, the Dragon Lord commands the Perfected. At the moment of majestic vibration, the dragons take flight in alarm. Clouds halt and mists converge, sweeping across the world, nourishing the withered and dry. Five fragrances spread through the courtyard—this is the great illumination of the Great Dao. Such conduct of great goodness—how excellent it is!

The Lord of the Great Dao says: After the Dragon Lord Perfected has exerted his majestic command to summon the dragon hosts, one must first offer sacrifices to honor the Great Dragon King, perform rites for the River God, Wind Earl, and Rain Master, and invoke the Dragon Lord, River Earl, Water Gods, and Yuanyuan Envoys. After three invocations of prayers, fast for three days, then stand by the flowing rivers and recite this upper chapter of the covenant text. When performing the sacrificial rites and covenant oaths to summon the dragons, one must also reverently honor the River Earl, the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, and all the gods.

This is called the descent of heavenly qi and the ascent of earthly qi. The pouring of great currents requires the union of yin and yang, the mutual resonance of the Two Modes, and the harmony of the four seasons. The Five Peaks bow in reverence, the Four Seas merge in darkness, the River God commands the dragons, and Yuanyuan overflows. The Eight Gates open—thus the Dao is accomplished, and its merit is great.

The Primordial Perfected Dragon Lord says: Having received the method of summoning dragons to bestow seasonal moisture, yet not having witnessed the transformations of the Five Illuminations—what are the Five Illuminations? The first is the illumination of the Upper Cavern’s desirelessness; the second is the illumination of the mutual clarity of self and other; the third is the illumination of the Five Penetrations and Nine Unions; the fourth is the illumination of wisdom responding to circumstances; the fifth is the illumination of gazing afar into the ten directions, unimpeded and without obstruction. These are the Five Illuminations of the Cavern.

The radiance of the Five Illuminations first receives the essence of the Three Sovereigns and Five Stars, then the numen of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, and further the brilliance of the Five Fragrant Mushrooms. The Five Fragrances’ illumination reaches even the distant lands beyond the seas. One plant has five roots, one stem five branches, one branch five leaves, one segment five nodes—five and five correspond. Thus, the immortals and sages name it. When the Five Fragrant Wood is burned for ten days, its smoke ascends to the Nine Emperor Heavens. It embodies the heart of great compassion and the sagely virtue of transformation.

The Lord of the Great Dao further instructs the Dragon Lord: When propagating good methods, if there are those who delight in performing purification rites and seeking the Dao, who possess sincerity and faith, and are fit to cultivate the essential Dao, then bestow it upon them universally to illuminate the divine transformations of the Dharma. Thus, later worthies will inherit the unbroken goodness of enlightenment.

Thereupon, the Dragon Lord receives the command, mounts his dragon, and flies to assemble at the Dragon Pond of Yuanyuan. Leading the dragon hosts, he descends upon the various lands, universally enabling those in the world who require rain or drought to follow the covenant text of the upper chapter, performing rites and oaths to the Water Officials, River Gods, and their kind. Then, the Dragon Pond Elder will open the pond’s clouds, bearing water to sprinkle and pour.

The Lord of the Great Dao says: Command the Perfected Dragon Lord to act in a timely manner for those in need, providing regular sustenance to the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, and their officials, as well as the customary attendants of the Heavenly Officials. When not entreated for rain, recite the upper and lower chapters of the *Scripture of the Dragon King*. Let the sound be sorrowful and earnest, chanting toward the flowing river seven times each. Next, the Dharma Master praises and intones the good, moving the River God and stirring the dragon hosts to sorrow. Suddenly, they appear naked in the eastern and western directions. After three days of such devotion, daylight shines brightly, and the night becomes luminous—a response to the entreaty for clear skies.

The Lord of the Great Dao further commands the Perfected Dragon Lord: If, when performing purification rites, the heavens are severely parched, the earth stirs with dust, and months pass without moisture, with scorching yang unrelieved, then summon the Dragon Lord to beseech rain. Recite the upper chapter’s covenant text and the lower chapter seven times each, with mournful and beautiful tones. The Heavenly Perfected Dragon Lord will swiftly mount his dragon and descend. As in the upper chapter, recite both chapters, completing seven repetitions each within a day and a night. Perform rites to the River God and Dragon Lord, dispatching the dragon hosts to fly into the Four Seas and rivers, ascending to bear water, roaming and spreading across the heavens. A torrential downpour will pour for three days, raining for three nights. First, arrange incense, lamps, and continuous offerings day and night. Then, the rain will arrive with a sudden gust. The true power bestowed is boundless, like branches and leaves flourishing in abundance.

The virtuous conduct of the sagely king ascends in great goodness, transforming beyond all ordinary limits. The command and summons are most difficult, yet the matter is swiftly accomplished. This is the pure and cleansing response of the Dragon Lord’s divine transformation—how could any but the most refined ruler achieve such a descent? Vast and level, it is not to be slighted.

The supreme words of the Dao’s truth encompass four kinds of great meritorious conduct. What are the four practices? The Dao says: Cultivating purity and stillness is the first practice.

To set one’s will upon the Dao-heart is the second practice. Transforming beings through virtuous influence to achieve completion is the third practice. Establishing meritorious works and employing skillful means to deliver the lives of sentient beings is the fourth practice.

Why, then, does one cultivate these four kinds of merit? The Dragon Lord True One says: There are also eight upright practices. Those who enact the eight majestic commands of restraint and summoning all proceed from the heart of the true Dao. If matters are not in accord with the Dao, one must not allow one’s own virtuous worthies to witness unprincipled ordinances. One must clearly proclaim this. If the proclamation of virtue is not universal, the fault lies with the Brahma Lord for not instructing his disciples and masters. It is the master’s responsibility.

The Dragon Lord True One further says: I have also heard that the Dao encompasses three realms. What are the three realms? Advancing with diligence in cultivating virtue, one practices in accordance with emptiness and non-being, attaining purity in the formless realm. Having purified one’s nature and life, one is also able to transcend the Dharma-realm. When the Dharma-realm is pure, then the numerical realms are pure; when the numerical realms are pure, then the innumerable realms are pure; when the innumerable realms are liberated, the three realms are pure. When the three realms are pure, the eye-consciousness realm is pure; when the eye-consciousness realm is pure, the mind-consciousness realm is pure; when the mind-consciousness realm is pure, the empty realm is pure; when the empty realm is pure, all Dharma-realms are pure. Because of this purity, all dharmas are equally pure. Just as emptiness is pure in its emptiness, so too are sentient beings purified. Because of this purity, sentient beings abide in it. Thus, there is no duality, nor does one cling to the non-dual. Because there is no duality, the Dao is pure. Speaking thus, this is the supreme purity of the Dao.

The Dragon Lord True One further says: The Dao speaks of non-existence, and the multitude of thoughts does not think of the Dao. All thoughts are utterly purified. If one ascends to the wondrous quiescence of that realm, it is forever without gate—this is called the gateless. Thought should be without thought; the Dao of no-thought is also without cognitive thought. The Dao is entirely without substance, entering into profound obscurity. Practicing this no-thought, the Dao of no-thought is most true.

If the Dragon Lord True One wishes to practice this Dao with a pure mind, one must clearly understand pure conduct and also ensure that one’s body, speech, and mind generate pure conduct in receiving qi. From non-being, the mysterious endowment of being arises—this is called the Dao of generation, the root of the Dao.

The Dragon Lord True One asks: What is meant by the perfection of bodily conduct? The Dao says: Bodily conduct encompasses the dharmas of past, future, and present lives. The future has no end, the present is like a fleeting scene, and the end is without limit. That which is without limit is called bodily conduct. Furthermore, when bodily dharmas converge through causes and conditions, those causes and conditions age and become empty and thoughtless, serene and without念. In such subtlety, the Dragon Lord now wishes to model this Dharma, observing the body in this Dao. One must not fail to exert diligent effort, thereby attaining the true Dao.

The Great Dao Lord says: Dragon Lord True One, if you ride this pure heart and are born into the realm of desire, yet dwell in the form realm among the assembly of Brahma gods, abiding in stillness and advancing without restlessness, then you, Dragon Lord True One, are able to transform and guide gods and humans with skillful means. Or, if born in the form realm yet manifesting in the desire realm with form, and associating with the gods and the thoughts of sentient beings, sitting and rising without awareness of weariness or arrogance, and without the worthy and virtuous belittling themselves—through such conduct, you purify all concentrations. Receiving them with a rectified mind, in the supreme Dao, none fail to soar through the mysterious void.

The Great Dao Lord says: When the True One has fully aligned with the conduct of spontaneity, possessing a body of purity, the practitioner is truly great. If one stabilizes the body yet does not follow the stability that arises from it, there arises a mind of advance and retreat—this is not the reception of the true. It is like the beginning of the teaching of the Supreme True One, which also employs virtuous skillful means. If a Daoist, resolved in study, understands purity, and soars with boundless transformation, this may be called diligent cultivation—the Dao does not betray one.

The Great Dao Lord says: I have also heard that at the beginning of the Dragon Lord True One’s teaching, one seeks the Dao without relying on habitual practice. Not practicing, yet not practicing the thought of the Dao—this is how one may know the conduct of the Dao. One does not practice the expectation of the Dao, nor does one originally seek practice to understand it. Or, if one’s bone structure already penetrates this fundamental principle, not practicing what is generated, yet aspiring toward the practice of non-practice in the Dao, one extinguishes and transcends even the Dao of understanding life and death. Practicing non-practice, holding念 constantly in the Dao—is this not luminous? The Dao will be luminous.

The Supreme Dao says: When the Wheel of the Three Caverns of the True Void turns, the immeasurable Dragon Sutras also cause the dragons to rejoice and leap. The Dragon Lord further says: The true Dao is not distant; the three and five return again. In clear skies, observe the signs, seek rain, and summon the dragon. When the Dragon Lord descends once, his whistling and singing resound. He sprinkles and nourishes the parched seedlings—what is requested is not excessive. The river officials of Yu Yuan, the five sacred peaks—preaching the Dharma and teaching transformation, only goodness is loyalty. Filial piety and compassion flourish, unmatched under heaven. The regulations and methods established may awaken one to the dragon. When the Dragon Lord descends once, none fail to submit.

Controlling and summoning the true, even the demon kings are obtained. The myriad ghosts vanish like shadows, and the spirits of the wilds bow. The five paths are severed, and one ascends to the lofty Song Mountain. Together, they issue the fast texts, instructing the young and ignorant. The golden talismans flow like water, resplendent with precious seals. On the left, the Six Jia are girded; on the right, the seal is worn. Only the Three Realities are contemplated, held within the heart and breast. Resolved in the Dao, diligent in fasting—why inquire about soaring through the void? The soaring void is the long Dao, long instruction in ease.

If the Dao is not obtained through practice, why suddenly entertain thoughts of practice? Seeking the Dao, return to emptiness and non-being; at times, one must establish form and image. If one’s will is not firm, one emerges and follows appearances. Not delighting in the practice of the Dao, one sweeps away all defilements and decay. The true Dao is entirely without practice; purity dispels demons and specters. If one arises in practice, sincerity and wonder may become constant.

The Dao says: Without the念 of self, the念 of self vanishes without a trace.

Extinguishing thought arises from emptiness; from emptiness, true reality is born.
If you can cultivate goodness and transformation, goodness and transformation bring forth the true numen.
Who knows the true Dao’s worth? The golden elixir lies within your form.
Nurtured beneath the mysterious womb, life is prolonged and enduring.
Why pursue a short life, unwilling to release primordial essence?
Primordial essence is easily known—securely dwell in the wondrous, mystic city.
Between the sun and moon it opens; bells resound as officers and soldiers gather.
Who can awaken to this truth? It resides in the thought of the Three Origins’ court.
Failing to seek my Dao, you instead invite calamity’s punishment.
The body perishes on the peaks of the Blade Mountains, dishonored and the Dao’s name ruined.
Why not cultivate fasting and uprightness, to live ten thousand years free from drifting?
Only fear that merit is not accumulated; do not fear that accumulation will not succeed.
The great Dao does not speak idly—I fear you will entangle yourself in sin’s net.
Thus I reveal the treasure of the Three Caverns, exhorting you to nurture eternal tranquility.
Passing through the five trials of suffering, you ascend to the imperial court of immortals.
We know one another—who truly listens to what is real?

The Dragon Lord Perfected says: I received the Dao of the Supreme Great Emperor,
personally bearing the unsurpassed, orthodox, and true Dharma.
Through diligent fasting and uprightness, I diminished myself to bestow alms.
If you wish to deliver yourself, first deliver others.
If you wish to perfect yourself, first perfect others.
If you wish to honor yourself, first honor others.
If you wish to respect yourself, first respect others.
If you wish to establish yourself, first establish others.
If you wish to serve yourself, first serve others.
If you wish to teach yourself, first teach others.
If you wish to cultivate yourself, first cultivate others.
If you wish to save yourself, first save others.
If you wish to reach yourself, first reach others.
If you wish to connect yourself, first connect others.
If you wish to delight yourself, first delight others.
If you wish to sate yourself, first sate others.
If you wish to enrich yourself, first enrich others.
If you wish to precede yourself, first precede others.
If you wish to govern yourself, first govern others.
If you wish to stabilize yourself, first stabilize others.
If you wish to be kind to yourself, first be kind to others.
If you wish to be filial to yourself, first be filial to others.

Bow humbly, diligently tend to your body, and soften your countenance.
Morning and evening, pay homage to my honorable one.
When you see other venerable elders, revere them as you do my elder.
Keep the Dao in your heart and on your lips, ever wishing to serve with devotion.
Exchange flavors to make offerings sweet, never departing from dawn or dusk.
Do not clothe yourself before the cold; first clothe the elderly.
Practice these eighteen virtues, and they shall pierce through to heaven above.
Do not hoard wealth; open your granaries to aid the poor.
Each year, dispense thousands of bushels to rescue the destitute and impoverished.

The Dragon Lord practiced this from youth, awakening to heaven above.
Heaven demands loyalty and filial piety; when his allotted time was spent, it was extended.
His lifespan was lengthened tenfold, and dragons came to welcome him.
This arose from accumulated goodness and filial devotion, a compassionate heart that aided the poor.
The Dragon’s pride was truly hard to bear—he was revered as the Dragon Lord.
Ascending and descending, his intent was boundless; he roamed and chanted as he pleased.
He transformed to appear in other forms, altering his appearance without obstruction.
He also expounded the Dharma to the multitude, awakening later disciples.
His conduct was full of compassion and mindfulness.
Seeing the worthy, he was never irreverent.
The supreme sages supplemented the Perfected; only then did he transform the world.
When his work was complete, he roamed the four seas, circling the Five Peaks.
Attaining the immortal Dao, his name endured; his deeds accumulated for later generations.
He enlightened later worthies.

In the world’s end, calamities abound—cultivate fasting to deliver yourself.
If you can nurture the Three Lives, the Dao refines the Three Origins.
Sit upright and contemplate my Dao, roaming and feasting on Kunlun.
If you cannot ascend to the mysterious void, then delight in wandering as an earthbound immortal.
Do not envy the joys of the human realm; roam the summits of the Five Peaks.
Then refine the golden liquid, ascend to the imperial heavens.
Why not diligently cultivate fasting, rather than sinking into the mundane world?
Assailed by a hundred ghosts, I fear your heavenly allotted years will be diminished.
Let thoughts of goodness continue unbroken; bestow kindness to rescue the poor.
The heavenly Dao does not idly preach—it exhorts you to create good karma.
If goodness is not long practiced, accumulated virtue extends your blessed lifespan.

*Thus concludes the Lower Scroll of the Supreme Perfected Wondrous Scripture of the Eight Mighty Summons of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern of Mystery.*
