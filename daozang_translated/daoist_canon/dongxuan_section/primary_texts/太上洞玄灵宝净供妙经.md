At that time, the Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate was atop the loftiest peak of Mount Ruoye, the utmost cloud-capped summit of its towering heights. There, in concentrated meditation and stillness, he forever stilled the six dusts, inwardly emptied and unadorned, his body and mind unmoving, without straying thoughts. Within seven days, he attained quiescent samādhi.

On the following day at noon, he suddenly heard from above the chaotic ringing of bells and drums, and amidst the floating clouds, celestial grand music arose. In an instant, the heavens rained fragrant flowers—some large, some small—each with a hundred petals, their expanse vast and round, some like chariot wheels, varying in size, their colors and forms ever-changing. Some were azure, some yellow, some vermilion, some purple, some transformed into the seven treasures, displaying manifold marvels, rare and wondrous. These celestial flowers cannot be fully described. There were also various incenses—powdered incense, pearl incense, hundred-fold blended incense, seven-treasure incense, and the like—all rising to the heavens, their fragrance rich and pervasive, filling the mountains and forests.

At that time, amidst the clouds appeared five-colored flying clouds, and eight luminous chariots, bearing thirty thousand divine immortals and their retinues. These immortals were all wise and discerning, eloquent and accomplished in the six penetrations, their virtues inconceivable. Within the three chariots were Perfected Ones, their necks bearing circular aureoles of five colors, illuminating the empty sky. They wore jeweled crowns upon their heads, their robes of cloud-brocade adorned with golden filigree, their pearls bright as the moon, serving as pendants and garlands. Possessing the thirty-two marks and eighty excellences, their radiance shone purely and clearly, each seated upon a chariot before him.

The Perfected One of the first jeweled chariot declared his name: "I am Yuluoqiao."
The Perfected One of the second jade chariot declared his name: "I am Guangmiaoyin."
The Perfected One of the third green chariot declared his name: "I am Zhendinguang."

The three Perfected Ones spoke in unison, praising: "Excellent! Excellent! Good man, through immeasurable and boundless kalpas, you have cultivated great diligence, ever practicing forbearance, and extending a heart of compassion. Today, without relying on external matters, your body and mind remain unmoving, attaining the mind of no-self. Having no mind of self, you also have no mind of others; having no mind of others, you also have no mind of distinction. Having no mind of distinction, you attain the mind of equality. Good man, upon this mountain, you have attained this mind of non-mind, accomplishing the Dao-fruit, inconceivable. We have now, by the command of the Heavenly Worthy, heard of your merit and virtue filling the world, resonating with the heavens above. Thus, we have come here with our retinues to bear witness to your true practice and to perfect your Dao, enabling future beings to gain knowledge, enter the city of Dharma, and attain the formless Dharma. For this reason, we have descended."

Thereupon, the Immortal Duke rose from his seat, prostrating himself upon the ground. After listening to the words of the Perfected One Yuluoqiao, he remained thus for a long while before rising. Making obeisance, he inquired: "How is it that the great Perfected Ones possess such luminous forms, and why do fragrant flowers rain down in manifold transformations, displaying such auspicious signs? I do not yet understand the cause and condition of this day, nor the reason for your gracious condescension to bestow such favor. I earnestly wish that the great Perfected Ones will enlighten me, allowing me to awaken and clearly comprehend these causes and conditions, so that the ignorant and blind may be roused to understand all conditions and ultimately accomplish the supreme Dao-fruit."

Then, the first Perfected One, Yuluoqiao, spoke: "Excellent! Excellent! Good man, what are your past vows, and how do you contemplate them?"
The Immortal Duke replied: "Truly, I have sealed them in my mouth and dare not speak lightly."
The great Perfected One said: "We have come now to fulfill your vow, desiring that in the future you will raise the great bridge of Dharma, construct the great vessel of salvation, open the great causes and conditions, and propagate great merit and virtue. For this reason, we have descended here."

The Immortal Duke again rose and made obeisance, addressing them further: "Great Perfected Ones and Masters, awaken this ignorant one. I have questions to ask but dare not presume to inquire. I only wish that the great Perfected Ones will heed my humble words."
The Perfected One replied: "Excellent! Excellent! Ask whatever you wish."
The Immortal Duke said: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, in a single thought, I beheld the ten directions, where in all the hells, the dark souls and hungry ghosts were swallowing fire and eating coals, treading upon knife mountains, their heads and hands severed. Some were immersed in cauldrons of boiling water, their five limbs rotting away, no longer retaining their ghostly forms. The sufferings and pains were inconceivable, and the torments of the Dharma-realm could not be greater. Yet in a single thought, I witnessed such suffering, and unconsciously, my body’s hundred joints and pores all bled, as if dismembered. Such were my past contemplations, just as I have now spoken. I do not yet understand what merit and virtue the great Perfected Ones possess that can save all these dark souls, freeing them from afflictions, satiating their hunger, and granting them liberation."

Thereupon, the Perfected One, having heard these words, snapped his fingers and exclaimed joyfully: "Excellent! Excellent! Good man, to speak thus is truly inconceivable. Now, I will tell you—listen carefully, and I shall explain it to you."

The Great Perfected One then declared: "The three Yuan auspicious days and the five La festivals together are called the Eight Days. On these days, one should go to the dark altar’s pure abode, invite Daoist priests, and perform the Dao through the night. Offer fragrant oil, prepare various sweet fruits, and pile them into mountains—whether large or small, or arranged in trays—adorning them in manifold ways to present as offerings to the Heavenly Worthy. Through this compassion, grace extends to the ten directions, and the immeasurable, boundless prisoners of hell and hungry ghosts all attain liberation.

Those who commit grave offenses—slandering the Great Dao, defaming the scriptures, or violating the pure precepts and Daoist priests—are guilty of heavy sins. Likewise, killing one’s father or mother, assaulting one’s master or lord, or plotting treason against the ruler are also grave sins. If one commits such sins, the offerings may grant temporary liberation. For those with lighter offenses, through these offerings and the night-long performance of the Dao, they attain permanent liberation and immediate satiation.

Good man, the merit of diligently establishing such blessings ensures that in future lives, compassionate Daoist priests and filial children will make offerings to their ancestors—whether departed parents, sisters, brothers, or other kin—all of whom will be liberated and satiated, free from hunger. If one does not make offerings on these Eight Days to one’s ancestors, it is an act of unfilial piety.

I exhort all future generations to diligently prepare pure offerings. Not only will ghosts and spirits attain liberation, but those in this life will see their wealth and treasures increase, untouched by harm from their seven generations of ancestors. Not only will the seven generations of ancestors be unable to cause harm, but no ghosts, demons, or malevolent spirits will be able to inflict injury. Why is this so?

Worldly commoners, in their ignorance, may seek out ghosts and demons or make offerings to their ancestors, but if they do not adhere to the Eight Days, their offerings will mislead the ancestors and incur further sin. Why? If offerings are made outside the Eight Days, the souls of the departed will remain hungry, and in their hunger, they will turn to harm, summoning external demons to join in malevolence. If offerings are made properly on the Eight Days, the departed will rejoice, refrain from causing harm, and no demons or malevolent spirits will be able to inflict injury. Such is the principle.

The Immortal Lord then said: "Excellent! The Heavenly Perfected One’s words on pure offerings are vast and profound. You mentioned the Eight Days but did not clarify what they are. Pray, elucidate their distinctions."

The Perfected One replied: "The Eight Days are as follows: the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months are called the Three Yuan Days. Additionally, the first day of the first month is the Heavenly La; the fifth day of the fifth month is the Earthly La; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Dao and Virtue La; the first day of the tenth month is the People’s Year La; and the La day in the twelfth month is the Kings and Lords La. Together, these are called the Eight Days. If offerings are made outside these days, the karmic retribution of sin and blessing will not be realized, as previously explained.

Good man, hold these words firmly in your heart. What I have spoken is the ordinance of the Three Upper Heavens, inscribed in purple script and golden characters as the eternal rites of heaven and earth—unfathomable and beyond conception. How could one not revere and diligently practice them?"

The Second Perfected One, Radiant and Wondrous Sound, then addressed the Immortal Lord: "Excellent! Excellent, good man! The merit is immense, beyond all measure. By the command of the Heavenly Worthy, I and the divine immortals and their retinues have descended upon you. Why? Because it is inconceivable, because it is without attainment."

"Good man, what was previously spoken is called the Eight Days—unfathomable, named the Eight Liberations. At the *mao* hour on these days, arrange the seats of the Six Paths, prepare pure fragrant water, garments, and all external requisites, as well as fine delicacies and food, setting them out in order. The Daoist, within the oratory, at dawn presents a memorial for bathing. At noon, perform the circumambulation and repentance rites, so that the ancestral spirits of the patrons’ households, those who have passed away, may all attain liberation and purity on this day."

The Immortal Lord said: "Excellent! The Great Perfected One opens the gate of liberation for all beings, descending here for no attainment."

"I do not yet understand—what are these Six Paths you speak of? Pray, expound upon them fully."

The Perfected One said: "The first is the Heavenly Path, the second the Human Path, the third the Animal Path, the fourth the Spirit Path, the fifth the Ghost Path, and the sixth the Hell Path. These are called the Six Paths. Good man, hold these words firmly in your heart. How could one not revere and follow them?"

Then the Third Perfected One, True Radiance of Concentration, spoke: "Excellent! Excellent, good man! The two Great Perfected Ones have fully expounded the Eight Days, their merit and sequence, their principles vast and clear. Now, I shall speak last of the great causal conditions, for I wish to tell you—would you hear them?"

The Immortal Lord rose and bowed, saying: "Your boundless compassion does not forsake this ordinary being. Today, my joy is beyond words. I only pray the Great Perfected One illumines my ignorance—how could I trouble you with further entreaties?"

The Perfected One replied: "We act by the command of the Heavenly Worthy, truly to perfect what was long ago established. How could your heart not speak of it? If it were not spoken, one would fall into ignorance and sever the seed of the true Dao. Moreover, in past kalpas, you cultivated merit to accomplish this—how could it not be spoken?

"Good man, the causal conditions of offering and merit previously mentioned have two aspects. What are these two? The first is offering while abiding in form, which is called finite. The second is offering without abiding in form, which is called pure offering, called infinite. Why? It is like the waters of rivers and seas, revolving without end. Thus, this scripture clarifies the meaning of the infinite, and it is likewise so. And like empty space, boundless and immeasurable—thus do I now clarify the meaning of the infinite. If the waters of rivers and seas were to revolve and exhaust, then the meaning of the infinite I now expound would also be exhausted. If empty space and rivers and seas are ultimately unknowable in their bounds, then the meaning of the infinite is likewise so.

"Good man, you must also understand the meaning of the finite, discerning it clearly. The finite is like one who recites scriptural verses—one line, two gāthās, from three to four, even up to hundreds of thousands of millions of verses—yet this is not considered much. Why? If one expounds them to others, within a few years they are exhausted. Thus do I now clarify the meaning of the finite. It is also like one who attains the position of a great king, enjoying wealth and nobility for generations, with gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, and vajra, all manner of treasures filling a city—yet this is not considered much. Why? If used for almsgiving, within a fortnight they are exhausted. Thus do I now clarify the meaning of the finite. If one recites scriptures endlessly with the mouth and gives treasures ceaselessly with the hand, then know that what I now speak of—offering while abiding in form—is called finite. Why? All limited things, when given, diminish with each day, while limitless things cannot be exhausted even by kalpas. Thus, the meaning of the finite I now expound is ultimately thus.

"Good man, the principle is entirely so. Not only is the merit of this offering thus, but all fasts—even a single night’s assembly—are likewise. How could one not diligently practice? If one can constantly rouse the mind, practice without abiding in form, and truly know the meaning of the infinite, then you will certainly attain the supreme Dao. Why? Because there is no self-body, no self-mind. Since there is no self-body, there is no self-mind. Since there is no self-mind, there is no other-mind. Since there is no other-mind, all minds are extinguished—this is called purity. One attains the samādhi of no-mind, the samādhi of no-self.

"Good man, I now decisively clarify these words. If there is a self-mind that ceases another’s mind, then the self-mind is not extinguished—this is called attaining the no-self of body and mind, but not yet the no-self of the realm of beings. If one seeks the no-self of the Dharma-realm, one must know that originally there was none, and now there is none. Knowing that originally there was none and now there is none, one knows there is also no Dharma-realm. Since there is no Dharma-realm, there is no arising and no ceasing. Since there is no arising and no ceasing, then know that there is also no non-arising and no non-ceasing. What is meant by no arising and no ceasing? It is for the sake of expounding the Dharma. Thus it is said: no arising, no ceasing. Attaining this principle is called making a pure offering, called attaining the no-self of the Dharma-realm, called attaining the purity of the Dharma-realm.

"Good man, what I now speak last was all practiced by the Heavenly Worthies, Perfected Ones, Immortals, and Sages of ancient times, boundless and immeasurable, and by the mighty ghost-kings of the ten directions, who thereby attained the supreme Dao. Though you are not yet enrolled among them, your title is Left Immortal Lord of the Supreme Ultimate. The great rank of Immortal—how could you not practice it? You will certainly ascend to the rank of Perfected One, attain the six penetrations, and accomplish the supreme Dao."

Thereupon, the Immortal Lord rose from his seat, bowed, and gave thanks, saying: "Today, I have suddenly encountered the Great Perfected One and been granted these words—truly this is rare. From kalpas without measure, I have cultivated merit and encountered immortals who have always expounded to me the lesser vehicle, the lesser wisdom, and the methods of nurturing life."

Never before have I heard such subtle and wondrous teachings as those now expounded by the Great Perfected One—boundless and immeasurable, beyond all thought and conception. My karmic obstructions, long accumulated like layers of frozen ice, have at this moment met the fire of your wisdom and dissolved without a trace, leaving no residue behind. My present liberation is just so.

It is like the parable of the man who sold his child: father, mother, and siblings wept in grief beyond measure, yet in but a moment, gold and silver filled their treasuries to overflowing, and the child was returned to them, their joy beyond all bounds. My joy today is just so.

Or again, like the tale of the king’s daughter named Guayin, who suffered the sixfold afflictions and could not speak. Cast into the deep mountains, starving and exhausted, her life nearly spent, she was visited by a Perfected One who descended to her aid. At once her illness was cured, her speech restored, and she was filled with nourishment—her joy beyond all bounds. My joy today is just so.

I only pray, Great Perfected One, that you command the spirit-chariots to linger a while in these woods and groves, and not ascend too soon.

The Great Perfected One replied: “We shall depart now, but shall return before long.”

With these parting words, the three celestial carriages rose in order, accompanied by immortal musicians and attendants, soaring into the clouds until they vanished from sight. In an instant, they were nowhere to be seen.

The Immortal Lord reverently received and practiced the teachings. On the fifteenth day, he diligently prepared a pure offering, observing all the proper rites and decorum. He constructed a Great Fruit Mountain, eighteen feet high, adorned with rare and wondrous ornaments. All manner of sweet fruits filled the mountain and its forests, and abundant rice was also prepared.

At noon that day, beings from the ten directions—from the hells and the six paths of existence, each with their distinct forms—gathered in numberless multitudes. Among these spirits was a great king named Dawei, who stepped forward with the assembled ghosts, bowed in unison, and praised in one voice: “Excellent! Excellent!”

King Dawei declared: “O pure-land Daoist, you have opened the gate of liberation for us all. Today, whether kin or not, countless spirits have gathered here, and all have been purified and set free. Were it not for your pure precepts and compassion, how could you have prepared such a pure offering for us and our kin? We pray that you, Dharma Master, swiftly attain the rank of Great Immortal and realize the supreme Dao.”

All the gods, humans, animals, spirits, ghosts, and suffering souls of the hells echoed these words. When they had spoken, they bathed in fragrant waters, donned splendid robes, took their seats in order, and partook of the feast in full.

When the noon offering was complete, King Dawei and his kin took leave of the Immortal Lord, saying: “Dharma Master, excellent! Excellent! Beyond all thought and conception! Through your compassion, countless souls have found liberation.” With these words, they bowed and departed.

The Immortal Lord then addressed the assembled good men and women: “From kalpas without measure until this day, I have at last received these essential teachings from the Great Perfected One—beyond all thought and conception. Though I previously received from the Great Perfected One the scripture for making offerings, its discourse was brief and did not expound the causes and conditions as profoundly as these teachings now revealed. There is also a scripture called *The Great Offering*, which speaks only of the Three Primes and does not clarify the Eight Days, nor does it expound such vast and boundless merit—beyond all thought and conception.

Good men and women, how could you not revere and uphold this scripture? Those who honor and practice it are called filial children, repaying the kindness of their parents who gave them life. And not only their birth parents, but also their true parents in the Dao. Having repaid their true parents, they gradually ascend the ranks of the Dao’s fruition.

But those who slander or disbelieve, who fail to offer sustenance to their ancestors, are called unfilial and have turned against their true parents. Why? To withhold offerings from one’s ancestors is to leave their spirits hungry—this is unfilial. Having acted unfilially and slandered the teachings, they mislead their ancestors. Their departed parents suffer myriad torments, while in this present life, their bodies are harmed by demonic forces, plagued by wind and leprosy, and afflicted with all manner of pain. Let future generations of men and women take heed.

Here ends *The Marvelous Scripture of Pure Offerings from the Cavernous Mystery of the Numinous Treasure of the Most High*.”
