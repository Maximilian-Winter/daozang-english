### **The Scripture of the Evolution of the Worlds of the Various Heavens from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure**

#### **Chapter One: The Heavenly Worthy’s Opening Discourse on the Scripture**

The Most High Heavenly Worthy dwelt upon Mount Lingniao, where he expounded the Twelve Divisions of the Scriptures to the assembled gods and humans. Thereupon, he divided them into four hundred thousand sections, which his disciples transcribed. Thus, it is called the Wondrous Dao.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy transformed into a layman, his wisdom boundless, and addressed the assembly, saying: "Since I began cultivating the Dao, I have passed through ninety-one kalpas, severing all craving and emptying the mind. Thus, I attained the Samādhi of No-Thought and became the sovereign among all sages. Through the illumination of penetrating insight, I beheld the decay and renewal of Heaven and Earth, the death and rebirth of sentient beings, without end.

It is like the sun and moon circling Mount Kunlun, revolving to illuminate the four directions. The world completes its cycle and begins anew, without cessation. There are four thousand Kunluns, four thousand suns and moons, four thousand worlds; four thousand great seas, four thousand palaces of the Dragon Kings, four thousand palaces of the Great Golden-Winged Garuḍa Kings. The great evil paths rise tens of thousands of *li* high, the great divine mountains stand thousands of *li* tall, and the great divine trees and myriad hells are boundless.

All these together are called the number of a minor kalpa-world. A thousand minor kalpa-worlds are called the number of a middle kalpa-world. A thousand middle kalpa-worlds are called the Three Realms.

The great kalpa-world begins with its formation, and after seven days, all things emerge, only to be consumed by fire and utterly destroyed. Thereafter, it forms anew, just as before, without end. This occurs naturally, without the agency of gods.

It is also like the death and rebirth of sentient beings—only their lifespans are long, and people do not perceive it. Moreover, when sentient beings die, their forms perish, but their spirits migrate, all according to the sins and blessings they accumulated in life, arriving at the abodes of the Five Paths.

What are the Five Paths?
1. The Heavenly Path,
2. The Human Path,
3. The Path of Hell,
4. The Path of Hungry Ghosts,
5. The Path of Animals and Beasts.

If one accumulates profound virtue in life, attaining supreme blessings, one is reborn in the Heavenly Path, enjoying long life, fine form, and boundless bliss, while retaining knowledge of past lives and their causes. If one attains middling blessings in life, one is reborn in the Human Path, entering the gate of wealth and nobility, lacking nothing.

If one’s blessings are meager and sins many, one attains lesser blessings and is reborn in the gate of poverty and lowliness, enduring base and vile circumstances in all things, or afflicted with blindness, deafness, muteness, or the six maladies, assuming an ugly, servile, foul, and filthy form.

Though these two upper paths differ in superiority, they are still far better than the suffering of the three lower destinies. If one is miserly, greedy, and stingy in life, refusing to relieve hunger and thirst or aid the poor and desperate, one is reborn in the Path of Hungry Ghosts. Assuming a ghostly form, with a belly like a drum and a throat as thin as thread, even when fine food is seen, one cannot eat, enduring eternal hunger. The form is hideous, and the years long, with no escape from suffering.

If one fails to honor parents with filial piety, lacks benevolence toward the nine relations, and harms the common people, incurring the hatred of the multitude, one is reborn in the Path of Hell. Assuming the form of a sinful ghost, one endures unending torment, beyond description.

If one delights in killing and harming sentient beings, making hunting and butchery one’s occupation, neglecting to cultivate blessings and only committing evil, one is reborn in the Path of Animals, becoming sheep, cattle, pigs, geese, chickens, or ducks, suffering the retribution of slaughter and sale.

Who could witness what was done in a past life? Only those who attain the Dao know this. To dispel your disbelief, I shall recite a verse:

Heaven and Earth truly transform,
What endures without change?
Birth inevitably leads to death,
Spirits follow the causes of the Five Paths.
Dare one deceive or falsify,
Hell’s bonds shall ensnare.
Only cultivate good deeds,
Repent and uproot the roots of sin.

The Talisman of the Radiant Spirit of the Most High, if practiced without negligence, transcends the Three Realms, escapes the Five Sufferings, turns the Wheel without ceasing, and attains the rank of Perfected One."

#### **Chapter Two: The King of the Four Kunlun Worlds**

The Dao states: "Before the mysterious transformation, I bore the title of the Most High. I beheld the King of Mount Kunlun, fashioned from gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal. Its height reaches three million three hundred sixty thousand *li*. Below, it is encircled by a great sea, equally deep and wide, at three million three hundred sixty thousand *li*.

The earth’s depth is twenty billion *li*. Beneath it lies another layer of earth, also twenty billion *li* deep. Below that, a layer of grain-like gold, twenty billion *li* deep; then a layer of hard iron, twenty billion *li* deep; then water, eighty billion *li* deep; and beneath that, a great wind, five hundred twenty billion *li* thick.

This great wind supports the earth, preventing it from falling. The earth floats upon the water, the water upon the wind, and below lies the great void, a realm apart from Heaven and Earth.

To the north of Mount Kunlun, golden light illuminates the world, called *Uttarakuru*. Its land spans four hundred thousand *li*, and its people live a thousand years. Their hair is of uniform color, and men and women are of equal height, with no distinctions. The people are all virtuous and do not teach one another to do evil. Among the Four Worlds, this is the most excellent of the three.

To the west of Mount Kunlun, crystal light illuminates the world, called the *Great Tang Realm*. Its land is shaped like a half-moon, spanning three hundred twenty thousand *li* in length and breadth. Its people live two hundred years, and their stature and affairs resemble those of the human world, with lifespans long and short."

To the east of Mount Kunlun, silver light illuminates the world, called the *Jade Fall Realm*. Its land spans four hundred sixty thousand *li*, perfectly round in shape. Its people live three hundred years, some tall and some short, all experiencing the affairs of the human world, with lifespans long and short.

To the south of Mount Kunlun, lapis lazuli light illuminates the land, spanning two hundred eighty thousand *li*, called the *Realm of the Forsaken Worthy*. Its people vary in stature, enduring the greatest hardships of the human world, faring worse than those of the other three realms. Their lifespans are uncertain, yet they possess one virtue surpassing the three realms and even the celestial beings above: their courage and fervor make the pursuit of the Dao easier. If they cultivate merit and follow my Way, they ascend directly to the heavenly halls or transcend the Three Realms to attain the supreme Dao. But those who accumulate sins descend into hell upon death, their fate shifting in an instant, with no fixed rank.

Mount Kunlun stands within the *Yellow Court Heaven*, where the *August Sovereign of the Grand Tenuity* sometimes resides at its center. Four Heavenly Kings guard the four directions, each governing one of the Four Worlds. On the first and eighth days of each month, they dispatch envoys to descend and inspect the world, observing the thoughts, words, and deeds—good or evil—of emperors, ministers, common folk, dragons, spirits, and all crawling, flying, and creeping beings. On the fourteenth day, Perfected Ones descend; on the fifteenth and eighteenth days, Immortal Kings descend; on the twenty-third and twenty-fourth days, envoys descend again; on the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth days, Immortal Kings descend once more; and on the thirtieth day, the Heavenly Kings themselves descend. These four descents are accompanied by the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight constellations, with all celestial beings descending in solemn array to scrutinize those who commit sins and crimes. You should use these days to reform your hearts and conduct, observe fasts, repent of transgressions, recite scriptures, uphold precepts, and engage only in virtuous deeds. Those who do so will earn the protection of the heavenly officials, their life spans extended to their full measure, free from unjust calamities. When their allotted years are spent, they will ascend to the heavenly halls, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and bliss knows no end.

These words are utterly true, yet you do not believe them. Thus, I speak these verses:

Behold the Four Worlds—
no secret lies herein.
Life passes swift as lightning—
why not till the field of merit?
In the dark depths of hell,
countless aeons stretch on.
Heaven’s law admits no pardon—
to whom would you appeal?

Heaven’s law follows truth,
subduing demons and wayward spirits.
Talismans soar, blessings arrive,
ascending with the Dao to distant realms.
The Dark Capital enforces its decrees—
transgressors find no mercy.
Hasten now, as the law commands!

**The Rotation of the Sun and Moon Illuminates the Four Worlds and the Third Heavenly Rank**

The Dao speaks: Above Mount Kunlun, thirty-six myriad *li* in the heavens, divine sages dwell, each in their appointed place. There are also the *Son of the Sun* and the *Son of the Moon*, their radiance complete, universally illuminating the world. Within the Moon’s city, five winds circulate, and the moon contains four palaces and five ladies. There stands the *Kan* tree, towering four thousand *li* high, its shadow appearing in the moon. The virtuous see it, and its fruit is beyond description. There are also seven immortal abodes and seven mountains and trees of the seven treasures. These immortals constantly cultivate my Way, never suffering untimely death or shortened lifespans.

If you wish to be born in this realm of long life, you must practice these five deeds:
1. Cultivate a compassionate heart and refrain from killing, cherishing all living things.
2. Be virtuous and refrain from theft, aiding those in poverty and distress.
3. Maintain a pure heart and avoid illicit relations.
4. Observe fasts, uphold precepts, and practice diligently without weariness.
5. Be sincere and truthful, reduce alcohol consumption, and guard against transgressions.

Practice these five deeds, and you will surely be born in heaven. If you still do not believe, I speak these verses:

Time’s course cannot be controlled—
alas, how fleeting is this world!
Why nurture guilt and sin,
recorded by the heavenly officials?
Once gone, none can be saved—
souls sink into hell’s abyss.
Swiftly seek the joys of heaven,
for the Three Wretched Paths must not be touched.

The talisman of the *Venerable Numinous Scripture* saves and nurtures all beings, awakening the blind and benighted. With wondrous flowers and incense, cultivate the heart in reverence, attain a body of golden light, and enjoy boundless life. Hasten now, as the law commands!

**The Fourth Chapter: The Great Cavern of the Heavenly Realms**

The Dao speaks: Among the beings of the Three Realms, there are three kinds of birth:
1. Birth from flowers,
2. Birth by transformation,
3. Birth from the womb.

Those born from flowers have accumulated profound merit and are born within lotus blossoms as heavenly beings. Those born by transformation possess meritorious spiritual power and arise through metamorphosis. Only those born from the womb, with meager merit and virtue, are the most inferior, entrusting their spirits to fleshly forms. Their lifespans are brief, and they do not compare to heavenly beings. Though heavenly beings enjoy bliss, they remain within the Three Realms. When their lifespans end, they are reborn in lower realms and cannot attain the Dao.

The Perfected are deathless, able to be and not to be. Neither diamond nor stone walls can obstruct them; thunder cannot hasten them; water and fire cannot harm them; the heavens cannot separate them; wisdom cannot surpass them; and no spirits or gods fail to submit to them. All living beings revere them without exception. These are the supreme beings of the Three Realms. Those who attain the Dao merge with the emptiness of space, boundless and endless.

Those born by transformation first perform good deeds, responding to the need for transformation. To aspire to transcendence is like shedding one’s body to save beasts, forgetting death in pursuit of the Dao. One must perform myriad good deeds, sever worldly ties, retreat to mountains and forests, venerate the sacred herbs, fast day and night, bathe in purity, rinse the mouth, and avoid foul and putrid foods. Now, with spirit attached, harm no living beings, follow only the Dao, and vow without ceasing to attain the Dao and become a flying immortal.

Such teachings are imparted to the immortal officials. Daoists possess bodies clad in the robes of the law—emperors, kings, ministers, and common folk cannot practice them.

Only those who revere and practice the Ten Good Deeds, cultivate and uphold the Five Precepts, and avoid the Ten Evils will surely ascend to the heavens, gaining a lifespan of eight kalpas. Should they further embody sagely conduct, they will attain the Dao—this is no deception. All celestial beings accumulate merit in unison, and retribution follows their vows without delay. Those recorded in the Registers of Virtue within the Immortal Capitals, along with the myriad demons, ghosts, and spirits who come to listen, will have their ranks elevated and their clans augmented, swiftly attaining the Heavenly Dao and becoming Radiant Golden Immortals. Let none slight the statutes of the Mysterious Capital; the officers shall be as enlightened as the divine decrees.

**Chapter Five: The Grades of Heavenly and Earthly Destruction in Minor and Major Kalpas**

The Dao declares: The earth is afflicted by three disasters.
The first is fire,
the second is water,
and the third is wind.
First comes the minor kalpa, followed by the major kalpa.

When the minor kalpa arrives, the qi of yin and yang transforms, bringing drought and flood out of balance. The five grains grow scarce, and all trees, stones, grasses, and thorns, along with the claws and nails of living beings, turn into blades and swords, slaying one another. The people perish entirely, their lives brief and fleeting, deluded and self-deceiving. Within seven days, all kill one another until none remain.

Then the great floods surge and overflow, scouring heaven and earth. Mountains and rivers shift, and the land becomes level. Sweet dew descends, and perfected beings are born, their bodies radiant with light, known as Kunlun. At that time, the floodwaters are fair and sweet, dispelling all afflictions. A single planting yields seven harvests. Should one pass foul and impure waste, the earth splits to receive it, then seals once more.

Human lifespans extend to eighty thousand years, and women wed only at five hundred. The world rejoices, its bliss equal to that of the heavens above. Yet when these perfected beings depart, their successors gradually accumulate sins. After countless millions of years, hells overflow, and the great kalpa draws near. Emperors, kings, ministers, and common folk—fathers and sons, superiors and inferiors—turn upon one another. The people lack loyalty and filial piety; rulers lack compassion and benevolence. Banditry and rebellion arise in waves, and the suffering of evil surpasses even that of the great kalpa’s onset.

Beneath the Four Heavens, human nature becomes wholly corrupt, devoid of the former simplicity of customs. Then the great kalpa begins, and the great disasters arise first. Two suns appear, then three, four, five, six, and seven suns emerge simultaneously. For what seems like tens of thousands of billions of years, rivers and seas dry up, and all living beings perish.

The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon the earth, where men and women scatter and play amidst the grasses of earthly flavor. Their complexions darken, their radiance fades, and their bodies grow heavy, unable to take flight, forever mired in lower suffering. Moved by their plight, the Heavenly Worthy commands the sun and moon to return, the constellations to resume their courses, and wind and rain to follow their seasons. Sweet dew descends from heaven, and sweet springs well from the earth. People know no illness, their splendor resplendent. Their lifespans reach sixty thousand years, nourished by spontaneous grain and clothed in spontaneous garments.

Yet in later generations, human nature and conduct grow ever more shallow, and the roots of sin sprout anew. Lifespans gradually shorten, and the spontaneous garments and food suddenly vanish. They begin to eat the flesh of birds and beasts, donning their skins and feathers, and turn to mutual slaughter. Sins accumulate day by day, yin and yang fall out of harmony, and rain and drought lose their rhythm. In winter, they dwell in caves; in summer, they nest in trees to evade the harms of the seasons. Bereft of clothing, food, rites, and propriety, they die and descend into hell, never to ascend to heaven.

Thus, for countless billions of years, myriad sages and wise ones, moved by compassion, descend to teach and transform. They tame oxen and ride horses, kindle fires, till fields, and raise silkworms. They establish the affairs of rulers and subjects, clothing and feeding one another, maintaining order through hierarchy and distinctions of high and low. Those who practice the utmost goodness, aligning their conduct with the Daoist teachings, may ascend to heaven. Those who do not shall all enter hell, plunged into darkness for ten thousand kalpas without hope of release.

For this reason, I now recite these verses:
The suffering of hell’s prisoners knows no end,
eternal kalpas stretch without escape.
The poison of transgression is sown by the self—
believe it well, mock not these words.
When form perishes, it returns to the earth,
while spirit and soul follow the foundation of deeds.
Heaven and earth pass in a fleeting instant—
you have no time like the swift wind.

Below, the Primordial Life unfolds,
harmonizing the measure of spirit.
Wings of this sacred scripture bring
heaven and humanity joy and reverence,
upholding fortune across the Three Realms,
erasing your sins thereby.
Should any dare to destroy or cast it aside,
the laws of hell shall show no mercy.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the divine decree commands.

**Chapter Six: The Nine Dark Hells**

The Dao declares: Beneath the Yellow and Layered Heavens lie nine continents, each encircled by a minor sea, all flowing into the great sea of Kunlun. The realm where I now teach is called the Red Continent, a lesser land. At its center lie the Nine Provinces, modeled after the greater continent.

The people of these Nine Provinces are clever and cunning, rarely sincere. Few ascend to heaven; most descend into the Nine Dark Hells, which stretch for hundreds of thousands of miles in all directions, a realm of utter darkness filled with sinners. Some have molten bronze poured down their throats; others are boiled in cauldrons, burned in raging fires, or impaled on iron forks. Some are struck with iron hammers, beaten with fiery rods, or dismembered, their heads hung aloft. Others bear sand and carry stones to fill rivers and block seas. The great spirits enforce their governance, and the punishments of the damned know no pardon.

Some suffer for one kalpa, others for two, three, four, or even a hundred kalpas. There is a great pit, forty *li* square, where sinners are ordered to labor for a hundred years, casting a single mustard seed into it. Only when the pit is filled is one kalpa complete. Another great stone, forty *li* square, is set before the sinners, who are ordered to labor for a hundred years, brushing it once with a celestial robe. Only when the stone is entirely worn away is one kalpa complete.

At that time, the sinners weep and wail, turning to one another to say: *"The mustard seed is so small, and this pit so deep and vast—when will it ever be filled? This stone is so hard, and the celestial robe so light and delicate. A single brush every hundred years—when will it ever be worn away?"* Hearing this, the hell wardens grow enraged and declare: *"These twenty kalpas are but half of a minor kalpa!"*

Upon hearing this, the sinners choke with grief, their breath stolen, dying and reviving only to be cast into these punishments, with no hope of escape.

The sinners then bitterly regret their past lives—how they were unfilial and rebellious, how they murdered living beings, slandered the sutras and the Dao, took lives, owed debts, schemed and stole, and failed to honor the divine Way—thus bringing upon themselves these retributions.

Witnessing this, I pity you, men and women, for your sins cannot go unpunished. Therefore, I speak these verses:

Neither pit nor stone is named for fame,
Twenty kalpas are not yet half a minor kalpa’s span.
Endlessly you toil in sin’s futile round,
Yet spirit and soul shall never be undone.
For but a moment you regain your form,
Only to be torn and flayed again.
Boiling cauldrons seethe and steam,
Blades and winds carve like butcher’s knives.
Pity these beings of the lower heavens—
Why not cultivate blessings and merit?
Rebirth in heaven is surely attainable,
How much more the immortal Dao’s way.

**Chapter Seven: Addressing the Assembly of Sages**

When the Most High Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking this sutra, all the assembled sages—noble lords, elders, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Elders, and others—rose as one and declared, “Excellent!” They addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Such awakening to the Dao is worthy of universal reverence.”

They then asked: “In those celestial worlds, are there yet higher transformations?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Since I began cultivating the Dao ninety-one kalpas ago, I have taught and transformed worlds numbering sixty-two *yì* of sands. At times, I divided my spirit and scattered my form, sharing in the cycles of birth and death. At others, I manifested as radiant vajra and lapis lazuli light, or took the form of emperors, sages, wise elders, or youths. I appeared as divine omens and benevolent beasts—lions, white deer, qilin, and phoenixes—employing every expedient means without limitation.

Yet the sentient beings of the world are burdened by deep and heavy sins. Their karmic conditions have not yet ripened, so they cannot receive transformation and ultimately descend into hell. Those who do receive it attain the supreme Dao and are no longer reborn within the Three Realms.

Now that you have beheld this sacred precinct, you must propagate the teachings of the Dao, deliver all beings, and make great vows. May all sovereigns and emperors, all the celestial and terrestrial realms, every subject and citizen—down to the smallest flying, crawling, and creeping creatures—awaken to the truth. May none fall into the Three Evil Paths, the Ten Sufferings, or the Eight Adversities. May the dead attain boundless joy, and the living attain the Dharma-body and immeasurable life. May jeweled palaces and all things be abundant without lack.

If you thus deliver beings, you shall become teachers of gods and humans. Can you not strive with diligence?”

The Heavenly Worthy further declared: “This sutra, once revealed to the world, must not be concealed. Those who transmit it in accord with its true meaning shall prosper in blessings. Those who falsely propagate it among the vulgar shall incur guilt and calamity.”

Thereupon, the assembly of sages bowed their heads in reverence, all affirming its goodness. They received and upheld it with faith.

*The Scripture on the Creation of the Worlds by the Divine and Wondrous Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery* is now complete.
