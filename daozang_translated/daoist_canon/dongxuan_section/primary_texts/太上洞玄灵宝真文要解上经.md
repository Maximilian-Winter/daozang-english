**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure True Writ Essential Exegesis, Upper Scripture**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure True Writ Essential Exegesis, Upper Scripture*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. One of the ancient *Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. One fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Mystery Section, Writings Category.

---

The High Mystery Great Master received *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Governance of the Cavern Mystery Jade Capital Mountain’s Seven Treasures Mystic Terrace*. The perfected beings of the ten directions, the spontaneous wondrous practitioners, the flying immortals, and the great sage assembly all hovered in the void, burning incense and scattering blossoms, circumambulating thrice daily. In their hands they held the Ten Absolute Flower Banners, and from their mouths they chanted the Cavern Chapters.

As the sun and moon revolved in alternation and the seven stars turned the celestial passes, after three hundred and thirty days, the Celestial Pass revolved once around the mountain. After three hundred and thirty revolutions, the qi of the Nine Heavens intermingled. After three thousand three hundred revolutions, the qi of Heaven and Earth intermingled. The intermingling of Heaven and Earth’s qi marked the convergence of a minor kalpa. After nine thousand nine hundred revolutions, a great kalpa reached its completion. At this time, Heaven would collapse and Earth would sink, the nine seas merging into one, gold and jade dissolving away, leaving not even the finest speck.

That Heaven and Earth endure without tilting is because the Primordial Beginning commanded the Five Elders and Supreme Perfected to seal the *Numinous Treasure True Writ* within the caverns of the Five Marchmounts, thereby pacifying spirits and anchoring numina, restraining the mandate of the river sources, preventing the surging of great floods, and averting major disasters. This is the spontaneous writ, thus called the *Nine Heavens’ Upper Scripture of the Numinous Treasure*, beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits. Should this writ exist in the world, it protects the state and pacifies the household, and no calamities shall assail them. Those who study and attain its method, at the completion of a great kalpa, shall soar high on vast wings, treading the flying clouds and floating in the void.

According to the old statutes, it emerges once every forty thousand kalpas, bestowed only upon those whose names are inscribed in gold from past lives, destined to become perfected beings.

The *Five Chapters of the Primordial Beginning’s Numinous Treasure True Writ* were formerly concealed in the Supreme Cavern’s Seven Treasures Upper Palace. The celestial script is profound and abstruse, beyond full comprehension; its radiant splendor shines brilliantly, illuminating the Upper Clarity. The Five Elders stand in attendance, the Celestial Thearchs pay homage to the perfected, jade maidens hold towels, golden lads waft incense, burning the hundred harmonized fragrances that suffuse the Purple Court. They exhale the essence of the sun to dispel defilement and scatter the radiance of the moon to sweep away dust. Divine lamps shine brightly, their flames merging in luminosity; golden winds arise in eight directions, auspicious clouds array in four quarters. Simurghs and phoenixes cry mournfully, their harmonious songs resounding; flying dragons and poisonous beasts guard the Jade Tower. The myriad thearchs bow their heads, circumambulating the Upper Palace, treading the void in flight, whistling and chanting the Cavern Chapters. They praise the numinous profundity of the Nine Heavens, rejoice in the precious clarity of the Three Heavens, and truly honor the wondrous weight of the Mystic Writ—its merit and virtue towering in the Great Void.

Thus, the Primordial Beginning recorded twelve virtues in its chapters to exalt the treasure before the celestial perfected and to mark the inexhaustible profundity of the numinous writ:

1. Its virtue is like the Void: serene and truly quiescent, tranquil and spontaneous, darkly obscure, the root of Heaven and Earth.
2. Its virtue is like the Great Dao: vast and unconstrained, non-action, the ancestor of spirit and luminosity. All the myriad things universally receive its accomplishment.
3. Its virtue is like Heaven: limpid and void, broadly covering, high and floating in the Upper Clarity. All the myriad things universally receive their generation and completion.
4. Its virtue is like Earth: expansive and nurturing, containing and embracing without distinction. All the myriad things receive its generous bearing.
5. Its virtue is like the sun and moon: luminous and penetrating, illuminating even the darkest recesses. All the myriad things receive their gentle kindness.
6. Its virtue is like the host of stars: shining and illuminating the various heavens, brightening the dark and obscure. All the myriad things universally receive their light.
7. Its virtue is like clouds and rain: harmonizing Heaven and moistening Earth, broadly bestowing flowing beneficence. All the myriad things universally receive its gracious showering.
8. Its virtue is like the four seasons: revolving the wheel of yin and yang, harmonizing the nodal qi. All the myriad things universally receive their nurtured life.
9. Its virtue is like Mount Tai: encompassing and shielding, its numinous majesty vast. The Five Thearchs are pacified and settled, and it is the dwelling of gods and immortals.
10. Its virtue is like the Great River: gentle and flowing, its kindness streaming in all directions, not rejecting the defiled or base, containing even the smallest.
11. Its virtue is like the Perfected: instructing the Three Vehicles, enduring and long-lasting, opening the gates of the Dharma, universally saving the myriad people.
12. Its virtue is like the divine beings: rescuing the dead and protecting the living, causing cold ashes to emit smoke, expounding the luminous mystery teachings, universally delivering the celestial people.

The numinous writ is wondrous and weighty, arising spontaneously. Thus, its supreme virtues are proclaimed to honor its truth.

The *Five Writs of the Numinous Treasure* are all the roots of Heaven and Earth, giving rise to the Five Elders. Above, they govern the Five Stars; below, they pacify the Five Marchmounts. They circulate and guide the Five Phases, penetrate the Five Viscera of humans, pacify qi and nourish spirit, protect the state and pacify the household, causing the sovereign to flourish and no calamities to afflict them, great waves not to surge. Once the numinous writ is revealed, it ensures Heaven’s enduring existence.

The Primordial Beginning’s intent is subtle and profound. Now, it is thus proclaimed to you—keep it secret and do not divulge it. Diligently cultivate and recite it, and the Dao shall naturally respond.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said: Those who form karmic bonds with the Dao shall not be severed from it life after life, bringing forth good fortune in future existences. They should practice the Twelve Supreme Vows to universally deliver all beings, bringing about the great peace of the state, the flourishing of the household, the prosperity of descendants, the emergence of worthies and sages in every generation, the ascent of the seven ancestors to Heaven, and the turning of the wheel of the hall of fortune. This merit is lofty and weighty—diligently cultivate and practice it.

1. One should vow that the Great Dao be tranquil and void, at ease in emptiness and quiescence, dwelling in clarity, broadly opening the Dharma gates to instruct the stubborn, so all may receive its beneficent understanding. Those who cultivate with diligent austerity shall join the same study, universally ascending to the void, preserving themselves with Heaven, enduring without sorrow, and all sentient beings together attaining peace and tranquility.
2. One should vow that the various heavens condense qi and attain clarity, broadly covering the high and void, preserving truth and securing the numinous. The climatic qi shall be harmonized, the four movements peaceful, the state secure and the people prosperous. The entire world shall be at ease and tranquil, universally aiding all beings, bestowing kindness upon the living, preserving the kalpa’s long endurance, and ensuring it stands firm for billions upon billions of years.

3. One should vow that the earth’s soil bears boundless loads, stable and unyielding, its seas and abysses unshaken, steadfastly securing the nation’s peace. The myriad people shall flourish, nurtured in life and at ease in death, their kindness extending to the ten directions. Crops and plants shall thrive, daily abundance increasing, their virtue deeply rooted and generously borne, with all ten thousand vows fulfilled.

4. One should vow that the two luminaries, sun and moon, shine with lofty brilliance, free from obscuration, eclipse, or waning. Their tranquil radiance shall illuminate all heavens, dispelling darkness and gloom, preserving the kalpa’s firm endurance. The world’s reign shall be peaceful, universally bestowing grace and moisture, showering blessings upon all beings.

5. One should vow that the stars shine with equal splendor to the sun and moon, their revolving light casting illumination, brightening the ten directions. Each shall hold its proper place, moving straight along its celestial path, steadfastly securing the nation’s peace, free from calamity. The four seas shall be united in tranquility, and all under heaven shall flourish.

6. One should vow that the four seasons follow their appointed cycles, their climatic qi harmonious and balanced, free from disaster or affliction. Epidemic poisons shall vanish, all under heaven shall be at peace, the five grains shall ripen in abundance, and the nation shall prosper with joyful people.

7. One should vow that floating clouds condense qi and gather mist, soaring high and clear in the void, shading the profound and mysterious. When concealed, they embody non-action; when dispersed, they fill the heavens. Immortals shall ride the same chariot, forming bonds with the host of perfected beings, bestowing kindness upon all, fostering the nation and cherishing the people, universally aiding all living beings, that humanity may endure as long as the kalpa.

8. One should vow that wind and rain flow and scatter without end, universally bestowing their release. All shall receive their nurturing influence, and the myriad things shall flourish, the nation’s stores abundant and the people prosperous.

9. One should vow that the Five Peaks each hold their proper direction, towering and encompassing, ever serving as palaces of immortals. They shall steadfastly secure the nation’s destiny, preserving Heaven’s endlessness, shielding and delivering all beings, none who do not revere them as their foundation.

10. One should vow that rivers and seas surge boundlessly, vast and all-embracing, nurturing even the smallest things. Their depths shall be profound and gentle, moistening all movement and stillness. Heavenly and earthly beings shall receive blessings, their years enduring as long as the kalpa’s stone.

11. One should vow that the sovereign’s domain daily prospers, its four borders tranquil and harmonious, weapons of war laid to rest. The people shall sing in praise, auspicious omens appearing, teachings widely disseminated, majestic transformations overflowing. The multitudes shall rejoice, their joy unending.

12. One should vow that all crawling and flying creatures, whether born or unborn, shall be wholly preserved, universally receiving life and growth, all filled with primordial qi, assuming forms of yang. Plants, trees, fruits, and forests shall endure winter without withering, all delivered and nurtured, none that do not flourish in fresh vitality.

These twelve great vows originate from the *Five Chapters of Primordial Wisdom Sutra* of the Original Beginning. The Dao of the Numinous Treasure’s great compassion bestows kindness and sows blessings, establishing causes for humanity. Its merit is vast, its recompense beyond measure—this is the supreme karma of blessings. Its power moves all heavens, and those who behold this Dharma shall immediately respond naturally. With diligent cultivation, they shall transcend life and death to attain immortality.

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao said: I once received this from the Celestial King of the Original Beginning, who commanded that it be transmitted to the Lords of Immortals, the Kings of Immortals, the Ministers of Immortals, and the Perfected Ones of Highest Clarity, not to be passed to intermediate immortals. Without the Dark Mystery Chart or the Imperial Writs of Jade, bearing the name *Highest Clarity*, one may not behold or hear of it. Even if one emerges from the realm of leakages and indolence, to see it is not enough—one must cultivate diligently. The nine heavens’ forbidden scriptures are transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas.

Those who study and cultivate yet do not practice this Dharma shall not establish merit or virtue. Their thoughts shall fail to move the profound, and true spirits shall not descend. Their connection to goodness shall be severed in darkness, the path of blessings lost, and when shall they attain immortality? Those who aspire to the highest learning must always fast and purify themselves, burn incense, and perform morning rites. Facing east, they shall recite their vows, aligning heart and speech without stray thoughts. Thus may they summon perfected immortals from the void, sitting in quest of numinous blessings from the natural. They shall rescue the seven ancestors from the dark prison, ascend the lost souls to the Southern Palace, protect their families and nations from adversity, and dispel heavenly disasters in years of prosperity. This blessing is towering and boundless, difficult to fully proclaim.

Here follows the *Numinous Treasure’s Five Chapters of Natural Protective Spirit Incantations*:

**East**
Nine qi of the Azure Heaven,
Bright Star’s great spirit.
Shining upon the eastern quarter,
Illuminating the nine gates.

Preserving Heaven’s long endurance,
For billions of kalpas without end.

Three lights in shared radiance.
Urging the void to chariot,
Raising my form to immortal flight.

And the bodies of your servants.
Hundreds of evils cast down,
Ten thousand demons slain.

The Central Mountain Divine Incantation, universally invoked by all under heaven.
The Five Spirits settle and secure, the body ascends as an immortal.
The Most High Lord of the Great Dao declares: These Five Chapters of the Natural Guardian Spirit Incantations originally emerged from the *Five Writings of the Numinous Treasure*, Upper Scroll. They subdue demons, summon spirits, command the hosts of gods, pacify and secure the Five Peaks, preserve the heavens’ enduring existence, illumine the principle of the Three Luminaries, bring the state to great peace, grant blessings to the people, and deliver all beings.

I once received these from the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, who instructed that they be transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas according to the Mysterious Regulations. When you ascend to the rank of High Immortal, you will govern the Three Realms, overseeing and guiding the hosts of spirits. Now I impart them to you. Choose the recipient wisely, ensuring they align with the Mysterious Chart, and transmit them in accordance with the regulations.

For those who seek the Dao, pursue immortality, attain perfection, pacify the state and stabilize the household, or sever all inauspicious influences, they must uphold and practice the *Natural Guardian Spirit Incantations*. Regularly, on one’s life-day, the year-star, the first *jiazi* day, the *gengshen* day, and on days of purification rites, face east and recite them once. Then the spirits will be radiant, the qi upright, the palace and dwelling solemn and pure, evil demons shattered, the Five Elders descending in truth, all trials subdued, malevolent disasters extinguished, and through prolonged purification and recitation, one will attain the rank of Perfected.

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao addressed the High Mysterious Great Dharma Master: Those who enter my Dharma gate first aspire to transcendence as divine immortals, soaring through the celestial realms. Next, they wish for the peace of their household and state, to traverse myriad calamities, dispel disasters, eradicate misfortunes, and entreat blessings and grace. They must first cultivate the *Five Chapters of the Natural Numinous Treasure*, observe the Eightfold Purification to repent sins, and confess to the Ten Directions. Above, this dissolves the heavy transgressions of past lives, severs karmic entanglements with evil, and below, it absolves the accumulated sins and faults of one’s own conduct. Diligently practice purification and uprightness, broadly establish fields of merit, deliver all beings, succor the dead, and protect the living. When merit is complete and virtue pervasive, one aligns with the Dao-mind, evil adversaries self-destruct, and good affinities arise. The household becomes upright and orderly, all wishes are fulfilled, divine perfected beings descend in mystery, and one attains transcendence as a flying immortal. This is the foundation of cultivation and the source of seeking the Dao. Those who study without this method labor in vain, their karmic roots unresolved, their hope for the Dao fading, and even in old age, they gain nothing, inevitably facing myriad afflictions.

The Great Dao, in its vast compassion, pities them from the heart. Now I impart this to you—diligently cultivate and practice. I once received these from the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, who commanded me to conceal them in the Upper Pavilion of the Numinous Capital, to be revealed once every forty thousand kalpas. Now you must follow the ancient regulations of the former masters. If there is a person of utmost devotion, whose name is inscribed on the golden tablet and whose conduct aligns with the divine immortals, you shall transmit these to them.

The Dao speaks: On purification days, burn incense and face east, praying thus:
*Your servant now burns incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Eastern Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. Your servant now reverently gives thanks to the Nine Qi Azure Heavens of the East, the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Origin Upper Three Heavens Limitless Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, the Heavenly Emperor Elder, the Supreme Thearch Lord, the Highest August Elder, the Thirty-Nine Perfected, the Seventy-Two Sages, the High Mysterious Perfected Lord, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Elder, the Primordial Azure Perfected of the Eastern Florescence Jade Treasure High Dawn Grand Marshal, the Upper Minister Azure Youth Lord, the Primordial Elder Nine Mysteries Lord of the Perfected Immortals, the countless multitudes of hundreds of thousands of layers of Dao-qi, the One Thousand Two Hundred Official Lords, the Jade Terrace of Supreme Clarity, the Azure Thearch Nine Qi Jade Gate Divine Immortals, the Four Bureau Perfected, the Most Exalted Saints and Great Gods of All Heavens, and the Divine Immortals Perfected of the Eastern Limitless World.*

*I beseech and entreat that the sins of your servant’s seven generations of ancestors, down to your servant’s own accumulated transgressions—killing the worthy and good, committing heinous and rebellious acts unbefitting humanity, indulging in lust and theft, undermining others’ achievements, severing others’ bonds of kinship, seizing others’ revered objects, failing in filial piety as a child, disloyalty as a subject, rebelling against superiors and betraying lords, attacking and opposing teachers and elders, disrespecting heaven and earth above, unafraid of ghosts and spirits below, slandering the Great Dao, divulging sacred texts, deceitful speech and duplicitous heart, envying the capable and surpassing others, disdaining the Four Great Ones, defiling the Three Luminaries, malicious speech and double tongues, slandering the good—all such sins, entangled across lifetimes, bound fast and unresolved, piled high as mountains, be absolved. Now, as I burn incense and practice the Dao, I repent before the Mysterious Perfected. May the bonds of past karma dissolve, the seven generations rejoice together, depart from the Five Paths, escape the Eight Difficulties, lost souls be liberated, ascend to the Hall of Blessings, the household remain unharmed, all under heaven receive grace, the land know great peace, the four seas flourish, the emperor rejoice, the state prosper, the people thrive, kindness extend to all beings, and all receive the Dao’s favor. Now I surrender body and life to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, beseeching that your servant’s wishes be fulfilled, ascending to the rank of High Immortal, rising into the formless, and merging with the Dao as one.*

Conclude with nine prostrations and nine strikes to the cheeks.

Next, burn incense facing south and pray thus:
*Your servant now burns incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Southern Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. Your servant now reverently gives thanks to the Three Qi Cinnabar Heavens of the South, the Supreme Clarity Southern Culmen August Highest Elder Lord, the Cavernous Numinous Jade Thearch, the Upper Origin Prohibiting Lord, the Three Origins Elder, the Primordial Elder Mysterious Perfected Lord of Myriad Blessings, the Lord of Myriad Blessings Elder, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace Life-Recording Marshal, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, the Grand Harmony Elder, the Mysterious Harmony Elder, the Cinnabar Spirit High Immortals of the Red Thearch Myriad Perfected, the Most Exalted Saints and Great Gods of All Heavens, and the Divine Immortals Perfected of the Southern Limitless World.*

*I beseech and entreat the sins of your servant’s seven generations of ancestors, down to your servant’s own...*
[The remainder follows the method above.]

Having completed this, nine prostrations with forehead striking the ground.

Next, turning to the west and burning incense, the prayer is spoken:
I now once more burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the West. I now reverently beseech the August Highest Emperor of the Seven Qi White Heavens of the West, the Supreme Clarity Western Florescence, the Supreme Numinous Primordial Elder Lord, the Venerable Lord of Myriad Origins, the Three Origins of Grand Simplicity Lord, the Seven Treasures of the Golden Portal Posterior Sage Thearch Lord, the Lord of Immortals Elder, the Grand Harmony Jade Maiden, the Western Numinous Metal Mother, the White Thearch High Immortals, the Four Culminations Perfected, the Most Exalted Saints and Great Gods of All Heavens, and the Divine Immortals Perfected of the Western Limitless World.

I beseech and entreat the sins of your servant’s seven generations of ancestors, down to your servant’s own. All else follows the method above.

Having completed this, nine prostrations with forehead striking the ground.

Next, facing the southwest, incense is burned while praying:
Your servant now burns incense in devotion, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Infinite Southwest.

Your servant now reverently beseeches the forgiveness of the Southwest’s Primordial Plain Heaven’s Grand Clarity Mysterious Culmen Void-Nothingness Spontaneous Vast Obscurity August Supreme Origin Numinous Dao Lord; the Golden Florescence Utmost Perfected Numinous Treasure Primordial Plain Elder Lord; the Three Heavens Jade Lads Purple Yang Perfected Duke; the Four Perfected of the Dipper; the Primordial Yang Emperor Lord; the Purple Essence Master; the Myriad Blessings Myriad Qi Myriad Salvations Myriad Lives Lord; the Western Radiance Grand Numinous Void August Dao Lord; the Golden Gate Plain Numinous Seven Perfected Jade Florescence Lord; the Most Exalted Saints of All Heavens, the Hosts of Gods; and the Divine Immortals Perfected of the Infinite Southwest World.

I beseech and entreat the sins of your servant’s seven generations of ancestors, down to your servant’s own. All else follows the method above.

Having completed this, nine prostrations with forehead striking the ground.

Next, turning toward the Upper Realm, incense is offered with this invocation:
Your servant now burns incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Infinite Upper Realm.
I now reverently beseech the August Supreme Emperor of the Highest Dao of the Upper Realm—the Utmost Perfected, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Unsurpassable, and Infinite; the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens; the Primordial Heavenly King; the Primordial Elder Lord; the Utmost Numinous Treasure Cavernous Mystery Most High Primordial Numinous Elder Lord; the Hosts of Boundless Great Saints and Utmost Perfected Lords and Elder Lords; the Most Exalted Saints of All Heavens; and the Divine Immortals Perfected of the Primordial Ultimate World of the Upper Realm.

Next, turning toward the Lower Realm, incense is offered with this invocation:
Your servant now burns incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Infinite Lower Realm.
I now reverently beseech the Boundless, Supreme, Formless, Measureless, and Innumerable Great Dao of the Mysterious Yellow Heaven of the Lower Realm; the Elder Lords of the Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Myriad Hundred Million Layers of Dao Heavens; the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens; the Supreme Yellow Primordial Lord; the True King of the Nine Heavens; the Utmost Void August Mysterious Harmony Elder; the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate; the Yellow Emperor; the Yellow Elder Lord; the Central Emperor of Primordial Yellow; the Five Elder Upper Immortals; the Most Exalted Saints of All Heavens; and the Divine Immortals Perfected of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways of the Infinite Lower Realm.
I beseech and entreat the sins of your servant’s seven generations of ancestors, down to your servant’s own. All else follows the method above.

Having completed this, perform nine prostrations and strike the cheeks in repentance. Once the ten-directional repentance and thanksgiving are concluded, proceed according to the ancient rites of solemn dignity.

This is the foundation of Daoist cultivation: above, it can resolve the karmic entanglements of the seven generations of ancestors; below, it can eradicate the vile sins of one’s own conduct. When all transgressions are dispersed, the divine luminaries will naturally protect. When the divine luminaries descend, the people of heaven turn their hearts in devotion. Merit and virtue spread boundlessly, blessings extend without end, universally aiding all beings and safeguarding the multitude of lives.

This Dharma is wondrous and profound, difficult to fully extol.

The Dao declares: Those who wish to cultivate goodness and establish merit, to widely sow the field of blessings, should perform purification rites for the people of heaven, repenting of sins, releasing life, lighting lamps, liberating from past karmic bonds, and breaking free from the snares of the world—so that the people of heaven may receive grace.

When the *Lingbao* True Writ is concluded, in the Eastern Chamber of the Bureaus of the Directions, the Azure Lad of the Upper House sings the hymn of summoning the soul and invoking the spirits. Those who recite it will have the celestial spirits descend to guard them, myriad calamities will retreat afar, the spirit will grow keen and the mind bright, and meditative focus will become easily attainable.

Disciples who possess this scripture must treasure and conceal it, and not transmit it recklessly.

The Divine Consort of the Upper House of the East sings:
*In the jade garden, purple cassia grows,*
*Red blossoms hum with murmuring sound.*
*In the Moon Palace lies the fount of herbs,*
*In the Sun’s midst, a pool of jade.*
*To the left, the Round Spirit’s radiance is drawn,*
*To the right, the Crimson Cloud’s glow is grasped.*
*Flowing gold illumines the crimson court,*
*Eight scenes transcend the swirling mists.*
*A green canopy floats in the bright void,*
*Feathered tablets command the Grand Tenuity.*
*The phoenix’s essence blooms in youthful grace,*
*Jade richness sates eternal hunger.*
*Grasping the dawn, I draw from the Primal Simplicity,*
*Riding the swift wind, I soar the jade steps.*
*Exhaling and inhaling the six spiritual embryos,*
*The jade maidens hold the towels and follow.*
*Strumming the zither, the southern cloud fan stirs,*
*Fragrant winds billow the brocade mantle.*
*Striking the shang note, a hundred beasts dance,*
*The Six Heavens submit to divine might.*
*In an instant, a hundred million springs pass,*
*Yet my age remains lofty and unchanging.*
*Small fish are not yet cooked in the cauldron,*
*Yet I speak of my sorrow beneath the cliffs.*

The Great Lord Azure Lad, with the Perfected of the Great Void, the Supreme Perfected of the Western City, and the Perfected King of the Lesser Existence, gather upon the Jasper Terrace. Gazing across the ten directions, they lament the myriad beings who, infatuated with the paths of the world, do not know the assembly of the Jade Dawn. Sighing in sorrow, they each compose a verse of song.

Recite these on purification days to invoke the protection of the Four Perfected.

The Great Lord Azure Lad chants:
*To plant the root of extinction and deliverance,*
*One must uproot the seeds of birth and death.*
*Lingering in the Nine Springs, I sink,*
*All for clinging to this bodily form.*

The Perfected of the Great Void chants:
*Observe when spirit bears the body—*
*Like a chariot following its horses.*
*When the chariot breaks and the horses flee,*
*The bond is but a fleeting loan.*
*Alas, the world does not recognize this,*
*Yet it is but a borrowing of wind and fire.*
*Sowing sins in the heavenly net,*
*Reaping poison in the hells below.*

The Perfected Lord of the Western City chants:
*Spirit is the boat that ferries the body,*
*Docking at the shore, it must depart.*
*The body is not the spirit’s eternal abode,*
*The spirit is not the body’s eternal bearer.*
*Wandering the wheel of birth and death,*
*Only the heart’s hesitation brings suffering.*

The Perfected King of the Lesser Existence chants:
*Losing the Dao, one follows the ford of death,*
*The three souls stray from the path of life.*
*With each passing day, life grows more distant,*
*With each passing day, death draws nearer.*
*Alas, the visage of bitter pain!*
*The root and flower are already overturned.*
*Rising to sit in the seat of withering,*
*How can one know to return from old age and decay?*

The Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea regularly ascends the Eastern Terrace of the Bureaus of the Directions on *ding* days, gazing across the ten directions. On these days, you may face the sun and bow twice. Performing this at sunrise will fulfill your wishes, and absorbing the essence of the sun is most excellent.

The Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao of Supreme Purity regularly ascends the Jasper Chamber of the Jade Empyrean on the following days: the 4th of the first month, the 8th of the second month, the 15th of the third month, the 8th of the fourth month, the 9th of the fifth month, the 6th of the sixth month, the 7th of the seventh month, the 8th of the eighth month, the 9th of the ninth month, the 5th of the tenth month, the 3rd of the eleventh month, and the 12th of the twelfth month. On these days, he gazes across the ten directions of the world, observing those with lofty aspirations, who roam in devotion, cherish purity, and cultivate reverence with sincere hearts.

When you first embark on your studies and cannot yet rely on visualization to ascend the peaks, wishing to refine and purify past transgressions, on these appointed days, purify yourself, and at dawn, face north and bow twice in supplication, fully expressing your devotion. Along with these rites, gradually ascend the steps of blessings. When the bowing and prayers are complete, ingest the Jade Pool thirty-six times. How subtle and profound! Strive diligently in this practice.
