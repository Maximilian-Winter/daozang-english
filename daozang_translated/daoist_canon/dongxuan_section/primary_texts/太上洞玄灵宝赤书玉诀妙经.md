**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Instructions Sublime Sutra, Scroll One**

At that time, the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Five Elder Thearchs, and the Great Deities of the Ten Directions convened in the Upper Palace of Vermilion Yang within the Southern Cavern. They were seated upon seven-jeweled thrones of luminous pearls in seven hues. Then, the Five Thearchic Great Sages and the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, along with fifty-two thousand five hundred in assembly, approached the dais. Heavenly perfumes and blossoms rained down, divine dragons and celestial musicians—innumerable hosts—filled the air. Purple clouds spread in all directions, the Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, the Celestial Origin rejoiced in harmony, and the assembled perfected ones arrived in procession.

At that time, the diligent scholar Wang Longci, who had been granted attendance at the seat, entreated to receive the precepts and commandments. The Dao addressed Longci:

"For seven million kalpas, I have reverently cultivated the Numinous Treasure, established vows to bestow and disseminate, upheld the precepts, observed fasts, endured hardship without retreat, revolved through birth and death, practiced forbearance and diligence, severed heterodox thoughts, and embraced emptiness and non-conception. Through the accumulation of these practices, I attained the profound quiescence that elevated me to the honored rank of the Sagely Dao.

Ever moved by compassion, I desire to broadly deliver all beings—whether male or female, those of noble aspiration and utmost sincerity—so that all may behold the wondrous Dharma of the Numinous Treasure. You, possessing a virtuous heart, have come to seek refuge in the Dharma Gate. This is due to your past lives across ten thousand kalpas, wherein you already revered the Utmost Perfected. Your merit is complete, your virtue fulfilled, enabling your rebirth in the Dao-world at this time of flourishing Dharma.

Now, I shall expound for you the *Ten Sections of Sublime Sutras on Resolving Obstructions*, that you may deliver the multitudes of the Ten Directions—celestial and human alike. Apply yourself diligently and take heed, lest you be swayed by demonic words."

The Dao declared:
"The causes and conditions of birth and death, the revolving of blessings and vows—none arise apart from the body. The human body is difficult to obtain, the Dao-world difficult to encounter, the sutras difficult to attain, and the decisive teachings difficult to hear. Why, then, do I unfold the profound purport and expound the essential words?

Moved by compassion for the beings of the Ten Directions who, upon receiving birth, cannot preserve and deliver their bodies, dwell long in suffering and affliction, willingly tread the path of transgression, and revolve through the Five Realms—none awakening—I broadly illuminate the Dharma teachings to guide the ignorant and benighted. Thus, all celestial and human beings may enter the Gate of the Supreme Orthodox and Perfected, universally delivering all who are born into this world. By virtue of their past karmic connections, the perfected ones shall all be enabled to transcend.

I have received the ancient sutras of the Original Beginning’s true scriptures, expounding the Dharma to deliver the world for ten thousand kalpas. I shall return to the Primordial Profound Joy Heaven. After this world passes into the Five Turbidities, when the mandate of destiny is obstructed, whether male or female, they shall not behold the luminous teachings. They will abide perpetually in the evil destinies, their lifespans devoid of opportunity, beset by sorrow and torment, enduring unjust suffering. Born and dying of themselves, they revolve through the Five Realms, falling into the Three Wretched Paths and the Eight Difficulties. Calamities and retributions pursue one another endlessly, and in the separation of birth and death, there is no distinction of noble or base—truly a cause for grieving the heart.

Now, I expound these essential teachings to deliver those who can be delivered. You must rectify your mind and attentively receive my words."

Then, having received the talismanic instructions, Long Ci bowed his head to the ground, prostrate in reverent acceptance of the teachings.

The Dao declared: "You who receive the Great Precepts of the Numinous Treasure must rise and face north, your entire body prostrated upon the earth, paying homage to the ten directions. Then, turn eastward and listen in prostration to the Ten Precepts:

First: Let your heart be free of malice and envy, without the hidden thieves of yin. Guard your speech and be mindful of transgressions, keeping your thoughts fixed upon the Dharma.

Second: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing; show compassion and succor all living beings. Let your kindness and love extend broadly to save all, bestowing moisture upon all things.

Third: Maintain chastity and yield to righteousness; neither lust nor steal. Constantly cultivate good thoughts, diminishing yourself to aid others.

Fourth: Be free of sensuality and desire; let your heart not wander. Preserve purity and caution, ensuring your conduct remains unstained.

Fifth: Let your mouth be free of evil speech; your words neither ornate nor deceitful. Be loyal and upright within and without, avoiding transgressions of the mouth.

Sixth: Abstain from wine and regulate your conduct, harmonizing your qi and nature. Let your spirit not be harmed, and refrain from all evils.

Seventh: Do not envy those who surpass you or contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and retreat, delivering others before yourself.

Eighth: Do not criticize the scriptures or slander the sacred texts. Apply your heart to upholding the Dharma, ever as though standing before the gods.

Ninth: Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor pass judgment on the four classes of beings. Let neither gods nor humans bear resentment, nor your spirit and qi be harmed.

Tenth: In all actions and undertakings, maintain equanimity and a unified heart. Let harmony prevail between humans and gods, and let this be your constant practice.

By cultivating and upholding these pure precepts, you shall ever align with the heart of Heaven. Constantly practice great compassion, vowing to universally deliver all from this world of suffering. With reverence for the teachings, never grow lax. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil.

Through unwavering practice, you may extricate yourself from the Five Realms and avoid the Three Wretched Paths. You shall be protected by all heavens, revered by the myriad spirits, and by maintaining a perpetual fast and upholding the precepts, you shall naturally attain deliverance from the world."

The Dao continued: "The Numinous Treasure reveals the Dharma to deliver beings, and there are twelve ways by which one may attain deliverance from the world. You should follow them, and by so doing, you shall naturally attain uprightness and ultimately enter the realm of non-action.

First: Upon witnessing the true scriptures emerge to deliver all beings, arouse the intention for the Dao, and vow that in future lives you may ascend to the rank of Great Sage.

Second: Constantly practice a compassionate heart, wishing that all beings may behold the Dharma, be broadly and universally delivered, without obstruction or hindrance.

Third: Delight in the scriptures and teachings, deeply and extensively studying them. Let your will be firm and your understanding clear, enlightening the ignorant and benighted.

Fourth: Reverently receive the instructions of your teacher, broadly exhorting and transforming others, guiding them into the Dharma gate, and distancing them from blind paths.

Fifth: Have faith in and turn toward the profound and wondrous, reverently upholding the scriptures and their instructions. Recite them morning and evening without weariness or slackening.

Sixth: Do not pursue glory and splendor, severing worldly entanglements. Focus your heart and stabilize your will, directing all your endeavors toward the Dharma.

Seventh: Diligently recite the great scriptures, wishing for all beings, and broadly build bridges for them, creating karmic conditions for future lives.

Eighth: Constantly cultivate a good heart, neither perverse nor false, without envy, harm, evil, or malice.

Ninth: Wherever you are born, may you always encounter a sagely age, and may the teachings of the Numinous Treasure Dharma never be interrupted.

Tenth: Purify your body and uphold the precepts; perform fasts and establish merit. Broadly save all living beings, that all may attain deliverance.

Eleventh: Extensively study and broadly disseminate the scriptures and Dharma, preparing for the company of gods and humans, universally guiding and delivering all.

Twelfth: Constantly encounter enlightened teachers life after life, receiving their teachings and propagating them, delivering countless beings.

These are the Twelve Wondrous Instructions. By cultivating these good thoughts, you shall life after life behold the sacred texts, form affinities with the Dao, and be recognized as friends by all heavens. You shall stride alone through the Three Realms, unobstructed, forever departing from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Realms, and the Eight Difficulties. Divine luminaries shall respect and protect you; earthly deities shall surround and guard you. Your gates and households shall be pure and solemn, and the myriad calamities shall not encroach. All your aspirations and vows, through the recitation of this scripture, shall be fulfilled.

This good man or good woman, with a sincere heart and reverent devotion, shall belong to the Great Sages of the Ten Directions, penetrating the natural and spontaneously attaining the ability to traverse water and fire, transform their form and shadow, and ascend to the Upper Clarity. Before their merit is complete and they should pass through extinction, they shall be welcomed by the Five Emperors and ascend directly to the heavenly palaces, bypassing Mount Tai. They shall be transformed and born into noble lineages, encountering the scriptures and the Dao, and thus attain deliverance from the world."

The Dao addressed Long Ci: "Diligently practice and attentively receive these teachings; do not grow remiss."

Long Ci bowed his head to the ground, prostrate in acceptance of the precepts.

The Dao declared: "The true scriptures and incantations expound the supreme Dharma for deliverance. The ancient texts are profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom in detail, and later scholars find them hard to apply. Therefore, I have annotated them in both elevated and plain styles to resolve obscurities. The jade instructions and true essentials elucidate the ancient texts, their subtle words and wondrous mysteries revered by all heavens. Upon reciting these jade chapters, the ten directions echo them from afar. In the heavens above, rituals are established; gods and demons are subdued, and ghosts and malevolent spirits are extinguished.

Fifty jade youths and fifty jade maidens attend the scriptures. From former lives through ten thousand kalpas, their names have been inscribed in the Supreme Mystery, yet they have not beheld these jade texts. Through the convergence of karmic conditions and encounters, they may attain immortality as divine transcendents. Their blessings extend to nine generations of ancestors, and their grace flows to distant descendants, all delivered from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Realms, and the Eight Difficulties. This scripture is most noble and wondrous beyond compare."

**The Numinous Treasure’s Method for the Water Emperor to Erase Sin Tablets**

Numinous Treasure [Name] Emperor, Master [Name], aged [Number] years, born in the [Number] month, vowing to become a spirit immortal, to attain eternal life without death, and to preserve the Three Origins in unity.

The Nine Mansion Water Emperors, the Twelve River Sources, the gods of the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji rivers, and the great spirits of the Mingling, beseech the erasure of sin names, that they may be reported to the Nine Heavens. They request to proceed to the Water Palace, conveyed by the Golden Dragon Courier.

Inscribe this in red upon a silver-wood tablet, wrap the tablet in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, and have a golden dragon carry the tablet to cast it into the depths of the Three Rivers.

When casting the tablet, face north, click your teeth three times, and recite the tablet’s incantation, saying:

The Primordial Five Elders, the Most High and Revered Lord, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Divine Immortals of Mount Taihua—your red-script decrees resound where none is hidden. Ascending to govern the Nine Heavens, we beseech the descent of jade texts. The sun, moon, and five stars; the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper; the Five Marchmounts at the center; the sacred mountains of the four quarters; the rivers and seas below; the Twelve Fountainheads; the Water Lords of the Nine Palaces; and the great spirits of the Mingling—today we make this supreme declaration.

Record their names in the Water Palace, proclaim them before the Lord on High. May our seven generations of fathers and mothers depart from the Eight Difficulties, ascend to the Nine Heavens, and be clothed and fed by nature itself. As our sins dissolve and scatter, may the myriad spirits all bear witness. We entreat with golden clasps to enlighten the Water Officials. Let this petition be thus conveyed by the Golden Dragon Courier.

At the Marchmount of one’s life destiny, face east, click the teeth nine times, and upon completing the recitation of the tablet’s text, recite the incantation, saying:

Mystic and supreme, luminous and clear, the Primordial oversees the Perfected. The Five Elders of the Lord on High, red-script cinnabar texts—foundation of heaven and earth, governing the Three Origins—gather qi and summon assemblies, hastening the descent of immortals. This exalted talismanic decree universally proclaims to the Ten Heavens, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Five Marchmounts and sacred mountains, all above the earth and below the heavens, the great spirits of the Mingling, the Overseers of Life and Keepers of Records. Open the Three Southern Gates, receive the jade tablet, inscribe names upon the cinnabar register, erase the records of sins. Promote them to serve as imperial ministers.

*The Primordial Numinous Treasure’s Method for Petitioning the Earth Sovereigns of the Nine Lands to Eradicate Sin Names and Seek Immortality*

Numinous Treasure [Name] Emperor, Master [Name], aged [Number] years, born in the [Number] month, life registered in the Nine Heavens, governed by the Eastern Dipper, yearns for divinity and immortality, to attain eternal life and transcend the world, to soar through the Supreme Clarity.

May the August Yellow Deities of the Nine Lands, the Earth Sovereigns of the Central Palace, beseech the erasure of sin records, that they may be inscribed upon the Great Mystery. We request to proceed to the Central Palace, to cast the tablet and record names. Let the golden clasps serve as our pledge, conveyed by the Golden Dragon Courier.

In the year of [Celestial Stem and Branch], the [Number] month, the [Number] day of the new moon, at the [Number] hour, the document is proclaimed in the central precinct of [Name] commandery and county.

Inscribe this in red upon a silver-wood tablet, wrap the tablet in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, attach nine golden clasps, and have a golden dragon bear the tablet to bury it at the central palace of one’s dwelling, all in accordance with the method above.

In the central courtyard, face north, click the teeth twelve times, and upon completing the recitation of the tablet’s text, recite the incantation, saying:

Heaven unfolds, earth extends, the nine qi divide and manifest. The Three Origins unite in harmony, the Ten Directions shine with clarity. The Five Elder Lords on High open the Perfected and govern life. Cinnabar texts and red scripts, the supreme essence of the Primordial—universally proclaimed to the world below, the numinous sovereigns of the Nine Lands. Today we make this supreme declaration; may the ten thousand immortals be destined for life. We vow for our divinity, for our immortality, beseeching to cast our jade names. May the August Sovereign of the Earth Palace eradicate our sins and punishments, present the tablet to the Upper Palace, and inscribe it in the registers of Splendid Azure. May we swiftly attain flight, our spirits harmonizing with heaven and earth. May the nine generations of ancestors and all kin, their decayed bones renewed in glory, ascend in soul to the Southern Palace, transformed in the immortal courts. On this auspicious day, we proclaim our decree; may the myriad spirits all heed. We entreat with golden clasps to manifest our utmost sincerity. Let this petition be thus conveyed by the Golden Dragon Courier.

The Dao declares: If you possess a sincere heart and arouse the intention for the supreme Dao, desiring to deliver all beings—men and women of goodness—from the Three Evils, the Five Paths, and the Eight Difficulties, that they may pass through this wicked age and encounter the Dao, you should cast the Three Origin Jade Tablets on the eight solar terms and the days of the celestial stems and branches. Erase the records of past sins, proclaim names to heaven, performing each act three times. The Three Officials of the Heavens and the Nine Palaces of the Earth will entrust one another, distinguishing all above in heaven. The myriad spirits will reverently protect, the Five Emperors will attend and guard, the administrators of the Three Realms will receive and welcome. Gates and doors will be ordered and solemn; the earthly deities below and the heavenly spirits above, the sun and moon, will come to pay homage. The thousand demons and myriad spirits dare not rashly interfere. If your aspirations are firm and pure, all vows will be fulfilled. Your seven generations of fathers and mothers will immediately be liberated from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, ascending to the heavenly palaces. Life and death will be blessed, and retribution will correspond accordingly. The Three Officials and Nine Palaces record the merits and transgressions of people—this principle is most clear. Through generations of karmic conditions, not a hair’s breadth will be lacking. You must earnestly uphold and practice this, never growing lax, lest demons corrupt your true nature.

Inscribe the thirty-two characters in vermilion upon blue paper, expose it in the central courtyard for five days and five nights, facing north each evening.
Follow the separate incantation method, then burn the text with fire and scatter the ashes into the azure smoke.
Also carve the thirty-two characters upon black stone and bury it in the north—
Celestial disasters will vanish of their own accord, and the asterisms will return to their proper positions.

The Northern Mountain Divine Incantation stirs the yang to raise thunder,
Flowing bells gleam and fall, the simian heavens shake with might,
The Northern Feng’s legions, the myriad demons crushed and destroyed.
Its twenty-four characters govern the subjugation of celestial demons, the Northern Thearch, and the myriad ghosts.
To perform this method, inscribe the twenty-four characters in blue upon a black wooden tablet, direct the text toward the northeast, and follow the separate incantation.
Fivefold performing this method, ghostly essences will vanish of their own accord, the myriad demons will be bound in form—proceed with focused intent.

The nine rivers drain and dry, the crow mothers flock in flight,
Dragons open the paths, water veins unsealed,
Vermilion script and jade characters borne by dragon couriers on the wind.

Its twenty-four characters govern the subjugation of the Northern Sea’s Water Thearch, the control of the myriad spirits within waters, and the summoning of dragons to bear one’s body. Should one wish to cross great floods or disasters, or encounter aquatic perils endangering all beings, inscribe the twenty-four characters in yellow upon blue paper, follow the separate incantation, and cast the written form of all beings into the waters—thus may one traverse the flood, dragons will open the waterways, and the Water Officials shall emerge in welcome.

Together, the one hundred twenty characters comprise the *Writ of the Northern Cavern’s Dark Yin, the Solitary North, the Stifled, the Severed, and the Five Numinous Ones of the Mysterious Venerable Lord*—also called the *Spontaneous Writ of the Primordial Spirit’s Birth of True Treasure Radiance*, the *Northern Mountain Divine Incantation*, or the *Eightfold Might’s Celestial Control Writ*. For all who initiate vows to seek the Dao, present petitions, or perform rites, none may proceed without first turning east, knocking the teeth thrice, and holding incense to recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Most High Venerable Lord, summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Transmitting Words, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans—thirty-six each—to emerge from the passes. I now invoke this land’s earth spirits and the true officials of the four directions. As I burn incense and open the passes, may the qi of the ten directions’ true and numinous ones enter my body, that my supplications ascend and reach the presence of the Most High, Perfectly True, Greatly Sage, Honored Divine Jade Thearch."*

For all who study the Dao and make petitions, or cultivate the supreme methods, failure to first open the passes invites interference by demonic forces, preventing ascent—all efforts will lack resonance, the spirits will not witness them, and labor will be in vain.

**The Five Venerables’ Red Writ of True Writs and Jade Formulas**
The Dao states: Those who study the supreme methods, contemplate the spirits, and meditate upon the Dao—dwelling in mountains with tranquil intent, observing fasts, reciting scriptures, liberating the seven ancestors, and seeking transcendence for themselves—must practice the *Supreme Method of the Five Venerables’ Red Writ of True Writs*. According to the ancient texts, one must first knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

*"Mysterious and Lofty Numinous Ones, Primordial Honored Spirits, Great Sages who wander, the myriad spirits attend the hall. The Three Radiant Ones spread their brilliance, auspicious clouds array the four quarters. I report to the celestial registers, ascending through the nine heavens. Today I initiate my vow, presenting my petition to the numinous mountain. Vermilion script and red characters, the spontaneous true writ, I report to the Five Thearchs, inscribing my name in the Jade Chapters. The myriad spirits bear witness, the sun and moon illuminate my words. May my vows for deliverance and rebirth, for spirithood and transcendence, be seen by the heavens, earth, and stellar lodges. May the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the great spirits of the Five Peaks, universally proclaim without end: sever my roots of sin. The Primordial opens all, none shall reject my words. May the seven ancestors’ imprisoned souls receive blessings spontaneously, forever departing the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, escaping the Eight Perils. May I join the Three Radiant Ones, shining with the Purple Dawn, revolving without end, attaining the flight of transcendence."*

Upon completion, read the petition aloud, cast it into an abyssal cliff, then scatter incense upon the numinous mountain. Knock the teeth thrice more and recite toward your life’s origin:

*"The Primordial oversees and witnesses, my immortal name is inscribed. The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus shall erase all sins. Scatter incense to the Five Thearchs, pledge alliance with the Great Void. As I have petitioned, may I abide for ten thousand kalpas."*

Conclude by inhaling nine qi and ceasing.

**The Five Venerables’ Jade Formula for Dispelling Stellar Calamities and Illuminating Heaven’s Allotted Degrees**
The Dao states: The stellar lodges of the various heavens each hold allotted degrees. When their paths deviate or trespass, encroaching upon one another, or when omens appear in the four directions’ domains, these arise from the misfortune of celestial qi’s cyclical obstructions, forcing them beyond their allotted lands. Thus, the celestial light shifts to illuminate and mystically report the inauspicious.

Therefore, the Primordial bequeathed this writ to harmonize heaven and pacify earth, dispel disasters and relieve afflictions, secure the state and tranquilize the people. Those of utmost sincerity must cultivate this method with devotion. On the day the calamity appears, inscribe the true writ as in the ancient method and expose it in the central courtyard. Face the afflicted direction, knock the teeth twelve times, loosen the hair, and raise a prayer:

*"Primordial of the Upper Heavens, the Three Luminaries’ lofty brilliance, revolving radiance illuminates the four directions’ clarity. Where the cyclical degrees clash, meteors surge and stream. The Five Borders transgress, the Three Systems lose peace. The Five Celestial Dipper’s total stars, the Seven Lodges’ numinous spirits, the True Lords and Great Leaders—whose tabooed name is Jade Essence—with the Empress and Royal Consort, styled ‘Nurturing Infant,’ together govern the Mysterious Pass, revolving the myriad heavens. Now, with this guest calamity, I mystically report the inauspicious. I present the true writ, the red script, to ascend in offering. With loosened hair, I confess my transgressions, revealing my vermilion sincerity. May the Mysterious One deign to witness, restoring the celestial canon. May qi not trespass, disasters not arise wantonly. I burn the numinous writ, scattering smoke in the Jade Court. The Upper Radiance oversees the degrees, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits. May the Three Passes’ qi be purified, the Nine Darks’ calamities be extinguished. Yin and yang harmonized, the land shall know great peace. I present this with golden dragons and wind-borne couriers."*

Conclude by exposing the true writ in the central courtyard and anchoring it with a golden dragon. If the calamity lies in the east, burn the true writ after nine days and nights, scattering the ashes in the blue smoke.

For all methods to dispel celestial calamities and pacify state and people, light lamps corresponding to the afflicted direction to illuminate the celestial lights. If the east is afflicted, light nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred—and use one liang and one piece of golden dragon. For eastern calamities, use ninety feet of blue silk over nine days and nights. For southern calamities, light three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred—and use thirty feet of crimson silk over three days and nights. For central calamities, light twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred—and use one hundred twenty feet of yellow silk over twelve days and nights. For western calamities, light seven lamps—or seventy, or seven hundred—and use seventy feet of white silk over seven days and nights. For northern calamities, light five lamps—or fifty, or five hundred—and use fifty feet of black silk over five days and nights.

This is the *Shangyuan* ritual method of the Primordial Numinous Treasure. The *True Writs and Jade Formulas of the Five Venerables of the Primordial Beginning for Dispelling the Great Kalpa’s Deluge, Summoning the Flood Dragons, and the Water Officials to Deliver from Disaster*.

The Dao declares: When the great kalpa of heaven and earth converges, the deluge surges forth in all directions, sweeping away filth and eradicating evil, leaving nothing behind. At this time, heaven and earth merge in darkness, and the people drift without distinction of good or ill. Only those scholars of resolute aspiration, who obtain the true writs of the Numinous Treasure and the talismans of the great and minor kalpas, may ride upon flying feathers to ascend in lofty observation, or mount the numinous peaks to soar freely. At this moment, divine beings shall command the flood dragons to clear the paths, opening waterways to ferry the body, while the River Earl awaits in attendance, sparing one from the need for bridges or ferries. Thus is the marvel of the numinous writs revealed—how could it be confined to the convergence of the great kalpa?

When encountering such a time, one must follow the writ’s instructions: face north, click the teeth five times, and hold the breath for twenty-five cycles. Visualize a fire arising from within one’s heart and mind, emerging from the crown of the head to burn the mountains, forests, grasses, and trees of the four directions, as well as one’s own body entirely, reducing form and bones to ashes, all of which ascend in a wisp of blue smoke, leaving nothing behind. Envision the great waters surging boundlessly across the world, while one’s body transforms into a flood dragon, drifting with the current.

Then, click the teeth twenty-five times again and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"The Primordial Beginning revolves the numinous,
Illuminating the Nine Origins.
Heaven turns, earth shifts,
The two qi flow and transmit.
The Five Phases press onward,
The mechanism of destiny revolves.
Yin and yang clash in opposition,
Binding calamity into collision.
The great kalpa nears its end,
Sweeping filth and dispelling miasma.
The Nine Rivers receive their reckoning,
The deluge rages through the streams.
The Water Mother lingers,
Birds and horses gather in herds.
Sun and moon meet in darkness,
The Three Luminaries halt their course.
The exalted select their ministers,
Examining the jade writs in judgment.
Abandoning evil, preserving good,
The pure and turbid are forever divided.
I partake in the imperial register,
My name inscribed in the Nine Heavens.
At the convergence of the four great disasters,
The Red Writs absolve all.
This day, the decree is proclaimed,
All spirits hear it in unison.
Sun, moon, and the Five Stars
Illuminate my soul.
The numinous mountains of the Five Peaks
Float and ferry my body.
The Water Palaces of the Nine Rivers,
The vast and cold great spirits,
Open and clear the waterways,
Unblocking the river fords.
The flood dragons respond to the talisman,
Seizing mountains to escort the numinous.
Bearing me, ferrying me,
They gallop in startled haste in all directions.
The cinnabar script in red characters,
The true writs of the Primordial Beginning,
Presented by the golden dragon couriers,
Without delay, moment by moment,
Must be immediately reported,
Facing the imperial honor above."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi twenty-five times. In an instant, the spirits who open the waters shall appear to ferry your body. If in the mountains, the mountains will float. If in the water, the waters will part.

This may be called deliverance in the face of peril.
In the blink of an instant, heaven and earth are wholly leveled.

The *Primordial Beginning’s Five Elders* summon the demons and devils of the Northern Feng with the *Red Writs and Jade Formulas*.

The Dao declares: Those who receive the supreme methods of the *Numinous Treasure* and cause divine luminaries to descend must first distinguish the forms of demons and devils to block and repel their trials. Once demonic essences are subdued, focused contemplation naturally induces resonance, and divine luminaries are readily summoned. To practice this method, proceed according to the writs of the *Supreme Perfected*:
Face the northeast, click the teeth thirty-six times, and hold the breath for nine cycles. Then, looking upward, recite the incantation:

*"The Three Origins unfold illumination,
Revolving and turning heaven’s constancy.
The reckoning advances to its limit,
A hundred and six weave the cosmic net.
At the great kalpa’s convergence,
Myriad demons contend in their courses.
The Northern Feng knows no restraint,
Releasing the ancestral ghosts.
Hordes of demons rampage wantonly,
Obstructing the light of heaven.
The August Emperor commands,
Proclaiming to the ten directions:
Unfolding the celestial demons’ clarity,
The Dharma’s teachings spread and flourish.
The true Dao governs the people,
Sweeping away inauspiciousness.
What petty demons dare
Gather in throngs?
The Red Writs and Jade Texts
Restrain and seize the demonic realms.
The Three Officials of the Northern Feng,
Swiftly transmit the decree.
A thousand demons bind their radiance,
Ten thousand ghosts surrender their forms.
Flowing bells intermingle in splendor,
Stirring the qi of the Great Yang.
Golden tigers patrol the four quarters,
Heavenly soldiers mend the void.
Great and small, all assemble,
None may conceal or hide.
What the Primordial Beginning proclaims,
Is reported in the Upper Palace."*

The *Primordial Beginning’s Numinous Treasure: True Writs and Jade Formulas of the Five Thearchs*

The Daoist ingests the *True Talisman of the Azure Thearch*, faces east, clicks the teeth nine times, and visualizes azure qi entering through the mouth to infuse the liver, generating nine layers of azure efflorescence and precious radiance that suffuse the nape.

Striding alone in flight."*

Upon completion, draw in the qi three times, as in the method above.

The Daoist ingests the *True Talisman of the Yellow Thearch*, faces the center, clicks the teeth twelve times, and visualizes yellow qi entering through the mouth to infuse the spleen, generating twelve layers of yellow efflorescence and precious radiance that suffuse the entire body.

Yellow efflorescence scatters above,
The Five Thearchs intermingle their fragrance.
Flowing essence disperses languor,
Twelve layers of radiance.
Merging with my form,
Myriad spirits come to welcome.

Nurturing qi in the central chamber.
Preserving longevity through kalpas,
Eternally settled without end."*

First dons the primordial kerchief.
Bearing the talisman to gather qi,
Myriad spirits assemble at the gate.
Precious radiance resplendent,
Illuminating my life-root.
Pacifying and settling the lung’s efflorescence,
Enduring through ten thousand kalpas."*

Upon completion, draw in the qi seven times, as in the method above.

The Daoist ingests the *True Talisman of the Black Thearch*, faces north, clicks the teeth five times, and visualizes black qi entering through the mouth to infuse the kidneys, generating five layers of mysterious precious efflorescence and radiance that suffuse the back. With the talisman placed before them, they recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Mystery of the northern heights,
Five qi meander and linger.
Precious efflorescence in five layers,
Flowing radiance gleaming and luminous.
Cloudy scenes luxuriant and elegant,
Suffusing the Great Subtlety.
Looking upward to infuse my body,
The kidney’s palace freshly opens.
Pacifying and settling the numinous abode,
Myriad spirits wholly return.
The body generates feathered raiment,
Descending in form, it flies of itself."*

Upon completion, draw in the qi five times, as in the method above.

Take bamboo from a numinous mountain facing the center, seven *chi* in length with seven nodes, to fashion a divine staff, ensuring it is perfectly straight from top to bottom; sweet bamboo is best. Inscribe the *Black Thearch’s Talisman* within the second node from the bottom; next, the *White Thearch’s Talisman* within the third node; then the *Yellow Thearch’s Talisman* within the fourth node; next, the *Vermilion Thearch’s Talisman* within the fifth node; and finally, the *Azure Thearch’s Talisman* within the sixth node. Leave the top node empty to connect with heaven, and the bottom node empty to stand upon the earth. Seal the top node with wax and impress it with the *Primordial Beginning’s Seal*. Seal the bottom node with wax and impress it with the *Five Thearchs’ Seal*. Wrap it in a crimson silk sheath, its length and size sufficient to contain the staff. In lying down, resting, sitting, or rising, always keep it by your side. When moving about, you may remove the staff from its sheath, concealing it as you come and go, and place it separately when resting. Point the staff toward heaven, and heavenly spirits will render homage. Point it toward the earth, and earthly deities will receive and welcome. Point it toward the northeast, and myriad ghosts will bind their forms. When riding the staff to travel or intending to employ it, click the teeth thirty-six times and visualize the *Straight Talisman Officers* of the Five Thearchs, each clad in the color of their direction, their five-colored radiance flowing and illuminating the staff. The Jade Maidens of the Five Thearchs, one each, together guard the staff on either side. Softly recite the incantation:

*"Mountain of the Great Yang,
Primordial essence of the Primordial Beginning,
Opening and unfolding heaven and earth,
Sweet bamboo connects with the numinous.
Straight Talisman Officers and Guardians,
Commanding and directing divine soldiers.
Five colors flow and illuminate,
Vermilion fire and golden bells.
Assisting the Supreme Perfected,
Exiting darkness and entering obscurity.
Summoning heaven, heaven obeys;
Seizing earth, earth welcomes.
Pointing at ghosts, ghosts perish;
Demons and devils bind their forms.
The numinous talisman and divine staff
Command authority in all directions.
With me they are perfected,
With me they are born.
After ten thousand kalpas,
They will replace my form.
Their luminosity dissolves into five,
The spirit ascends to the Upper Clarity.
Bearing the talisman to proclaim the decree,
None dare disobey."*

When finished, draw the qi of the Five Directions, swallowing each five times, totaling twenty-five swallows to conclude. Practicing this Dao for nine years with utmost diligence and reverence, the divine spirits will manifest in form, and the staff will carry one through the air. Should one seek liberation through the corpse, the staff will replace one’s form, and in an instant, one will become a Perfected. On the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month and the eight seasonal nodes, burn incense to the left and right, and pay homage to this staff—then the numinous spirits will descend in response, and the Dao will be accomplished.

**Numinous Treasure Eight Might Divine Staff Jade Formula**
Inscribe in vermilion the *Three Heavens Supreme Venerable Summoning and Subduing Flood Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, and Mountain Spirits Text* upon a silverwood board. Record the year, month, and the master’s surname and given name on another board. Bind the two boards together and enclose them in a pouch. Inscribe the following text in vermilion on another board and place it outside the pouch. Altogether, three boards are sealed to form the Divine Staff, as in the transmission’s form. All boards must be made of silverwood, one foot and four inches in length, two inches and four fen in width. Use crimson silk to make a pouch twelve feet in length, wrapping it around the outer board, and impress the seal of the Primordial Beginning’s Five Elders at the lower end. Encase it in a sterculia wood box, clad in crimson silk, and store it in a separate chamber with the invocation text for the staff. Burn incense to the left and right, and reverently attend to it. When received, wear it on the body. All divine spirits under heaven will attend at the gates day and night, accompanied by twelve Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Five Emperors. When traveling, the Five Emperors will serve as guards, and the administrators of the Three Realms will welcome you. No longer will you face the three evil destinies in life or death; you will bypass Mount Tai and ascend directly to the Nine Heavens. Clothing and sustenance will come naturally, and your rank will equal that of the Great Ultimate. Ultimately, you will attain immortality.

When a Daoist adept wears this text and employs the divine incantations, pointing the staff text toward heaven, the heavenly spirits will offer rites. Pointing it toward earth, the earth spirits will bow in reverence, and the Three Realms will gird their sashes. Pointing it toward spirits, they will pay homage. Pointing it toward ghosts, they will perish and scatter. Pointing it toward water, the water spirits will clear the way. When great kalpas intersect and floods converge from all directions, use the staff to summon dragons, and they will bear you upon their backs. Through long cultivation and accumulated resonance, divine spirits will gather in response—wherever you invoke them, they will arrive instantly. A thousand transformations and ten thousand wonders will follow your will. In your comings and goings through the years, your rank will be that of the Great Ultimate. You will be preceded by flying dragons and guided by the Celestial Pivot, with phoenixes wailing and simurghs singing, twelve radiant blossoms, and the banners of the Three Sevens. After nine years of focused practice, the celestial regalia will naturally be complete.

Daoists who study the supreme Daoist methods, observe fasts and precepts, and cultivate focused meditation upon the Dao, aspiring to the numinous perfected, must first follow the ancient protocols of the Numinous Treasure’s Upper Primordial, arranging the true texts and placing them in the respective directions.

Inscribe the Vermilion Script of the Yellow Emperor on yellow silk and place it at the Center. Inscribe the Vermilion Script of the White Emperor on white silk and place it on the western wall.

Practitioners must strictly observe the prohibitions.

Within the Nine *Qi* Azure Heaven resides the Primordial Azure Numinous Lad, named Kaiyang Qing, who oversees the Vermilion Script of the Azure Emperor. The Azure Numinous Lad is nine inches tall, clad in azure feathered robes, and holds a green banner, standing to the left of the text.

Those who ingest the Five *Qi* yet remain ignorant of these spirits will ultimately fail to receive response, their efforts spent in vain.

Thus concludes the *Upper Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Vermilion Script and Jade Formulae of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*.

The *Lower Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Vermilion Script and Jade Formulae of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*

The Primordial Thearch, the Numinous Treasure Venerable Divinity, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct customarily visit the Southern Thearch’s Cavernous Yang Palace thrice yearly to audit the celestial origins, reckon the kalpas’ conjunctions, and unveil the Vermilion Script of the Five Elders’ True Text, sealing it upon jade tablets to bestow upon the Five Thearchs.

The Five *Qi* of the Primordial Thearch regularly ascend at cock’s crow to convene at the Numinous Treasure’s Jade Capital and the Mysterious Metropolis’ Upper Palace. As the yang light first brightens, it scatters the radiance of the Primordial Thearch, surveying the myriad heavens. Its *qi* is lush and luxuriant, its brilliance warm and pervasive, its essence like moonlit pearls, its light like purple clouds. The Five *Qi* revolve like a chariot’s wheel, ascending to govern the gates of the Nine Heavens, securing the numinous mountains of the Five Thearchs in the center, and descending to infuse the roots of the Five *Qi* within the scholars. The assembly of sages and Perfected of Great Wisdom in the Upper Palace all partake of its radiance at that hour, inhaling its essence, aligning with heaven to attain boundlessness.

The Most High Dao Lord requested the transcription of this text to transmit it to the utmost perfected. According to the Mysterious Regulations of the Numinous Treasure, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. Thus, the Numinous Treasure’s illumination emerges to deliver beings through the Dharma.

The Ten Directions’ Great Sage Venerable Divinities and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct convened together at the Three Primes’ Cavern Chamber on the Crimson Glow’s Slope in the Southern Garden, sealing the jade tablets. The host of perfected attended in assembly, with fragrant flowers, ritual music, and fifty million in attendance. The True Text shone resplendently, its luminosity penetrating within and without. The Five *Qi* surveyed the radiance, illuminating all directions. Cloudscapes were clear and bright, like the moon amidst stars, their wondrous forms and manifold excellences beyond measure.

At that time, in the Northern Chamber, there was a diligent and worthy man named Wang Fudu. He had a daughter named Aqiuceng, aged sixteen, who was then in the bathhouse, washing herself with fragrant water. She saw a golden light curving and shining, suspecting something unusual. She exited the chamber, climbed the wall, and gazing southward, beheld the Perfected of the Dao. Their divine essence blazed brilliantly, their countenance and luminosity outshone the sun. The girl rejoiced in her heart, clasped her hands in salutation, and called out from afar: “My name is Qiuceng. Today, I am fortunate to encounter this assembly, to behold the Heavenly Venerable, and to return my being to the Heaven within the Heavens of the Ten Directions. I beseech the precepts, to uphold and follow the Dharma texts, to eradicate all evil roots, to swiftly attain rebirth, to transform into a male form, and after ten thousand kalpas, to aspire to become a flying immortal.”

The Five Thearchs’ Demon Kings, seeing the girl make such a great vow, feared she might transcend their realm. They transformed into five elderly thearchs and approached the girl, saying: “We have received the mandate of the Venerable Divinities of the Ten Directions to convey to you the regulations of the Numinous Treasure’s Dharma. Our Dao is now spreading, and its Dharma promotes benevolence and love, with filial piety as its foundation. We have heard that your father intended to marry you off, having already accepted another’s proposal, which cannot be revoked. You should first comply with this, fulfill your human duties, and complete your rites and teachings. Thereafter, you may offer yourself. Heaven observes your heart; if you defy your father, there will be no means for the immortals to deliver you.”

The girl replied to the demons: “In my past life, I was unfortunate, lacking karmic conditions, and my merits and virtues were insufficient, resulting in my rebirth as a woman. From dawn to dusk, I repent and reflect, vowing to maintain a single heart, my resolve firm and arising naturally. My life comes from my parents, but my destiny lies with the Ten Heavens. Though I sincerely defy my father’s teachings, it is not as you say.” The demons, seeing the girl’s steadfast heart and upright conduct, could not sway her, and thus retreated.

Qiuceng declared: “The Dao is lofty and remote, and I have no means to attain it. I shall gather firewood, climb the wall, and burn my body, hoping that my form may become flying ashes, carried by the wind to descend before the Dao.” Thereupon, the fire ignited. Qiuceng clasped her hands toward heaven and said: “Venerable Ones of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Heavens, today I return my form to the Heaven within the Heavens. May I attain timely liberation, to disperse like dust.” She then cast herself into the fire. Suddenly, she felt no attachment, her body as if treading empty space. In an instant, she saw her female form transform into a male, who proceeded directly before the Dao and there received the precepts.

The Primordial Thearch then commanded the Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen to be the girl’s master, transmitting to her the True Text. He assigned three hundred Jade Maidens of Great Florescence and three hundred Jade Lads of Golden Dawn, all adorned with the thirty-two marks, their brilliance illuminating the girl’s body. The Dao addressed the Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen: “This girl, in her past life, had already revered the Numinous Treasure. After ten thousand kalpas of rebirth, she has now been reborn among humans. Upon witnessing my revelation of the Dharma, she immediately attained transformation of form. She shall further deliver ninety-nine thousand beings before attaining the rank of Great Perfected Divinity.”

At that time, all beings—whether male or female—awakened to the intent of the True Dao, none failing to diligently uphold the fasts and precepts, cultivate and follow the Numinous Treasure. With utmost aspiration in their crowns, all attained deliverance from the world.

The Dao addressed Aqiuceng: “The Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen was once also a woman, born in the world of Chanli within the Crimson Brightness Heaven. She performed great merits, praised by all heavens. Before her Dao could be accomplished, she encountered the kalpa of fire, when heaven and earth exchanged positions, and she was among those cast aside. The Southern Culmen was moved by her utmost sincerity, and the Vermilion Palace inscribed her purple name. Her form was transformed within the womb of the Primordial Lady. After one kalpa, she was reborn as a male, dwelling in the Seven-Colored Jeweled Grove of the Upper Bright Pearl Palace in the Southern Vermilion Cavernous Yang. She studied under the Red Thearch’s Brahma Treasure and the Perfected Elder of the Vermilion Yang of the Flourishing Sun. Having mastered the Vermilion Script, she ascended to the rank of the Southern Culmen.”

In your former life, you dwelled with the Southern Culmen in the world of Chanli, where beneath the cypress grove of Vermilion Yang, you together awakened the intent for the Dao. At that time, the Southern Culmen bore the surname Huang and the style Duming. He took your right hand, and together you inscribed red stone, recording your names in the Southern Palace. Your brushstrokes were also inscribed upon the southern veranda, and they remain there to this day—the stone inscriptions still endure. Do you recall this?

Qiu Zeng’s heart awakened, and lowering his gaze, he beheld the carved script on the southern wall where the Southern Culmen resided: *"On the first day of the seventh month in the year Tai Jia, Huang Duming and A Qiu Zeng together vowed beneath the cypress grove of Vermilion Yang."* Twenty-three characters in all, each distinct and clear. Yet scarcely had he recalled this when suddenly three kalpas of heaven and earth had passed, and now he was reborn into the world of Lingbao.

The Dao spoke to Qiu Zeng: "Now that you have taken the Southern Culmen as your master, is this not exalted? All this arises from the karmic conditions of your past lives. You must diligently cultivate the supreme practice, broadly deliver heaven and humanity, and when your merits are complete and your virtue perfected, you shall naturally ascend to the rank of Perfected, transcend the Three Clarities, swiftly traverse the Nine Radiant Mists, and attend the court of the Great Mystery."

Qiu Zeng bowed his head before the Dao: "In my former life, I was fortunate to be born into the world of the Dao, encountering the Heavenly Perfected. Though I dwelt in the hidden chamber, my form reeked and my bones were foul, yet within the sacred altar my spirit was awakened, my heart responding beyond the body. I cast aside my remains and entrusted my life, hoping for even the slightest salvation. The Most High’s mysterious gaze turned to deliver me—having transformed my form, I now attend the Heavenly Worthy, and further, by the grace of the Southern Culmen, I have received the teachings of a master. Joy and awe fill my heart, yet I know not how to express them. I only pray for your fulfillment, illuminating what I have never heard, and bestowing upon me the jade instructions and treasured mysteries."

The Most High Dao Lord commanded the Vermilion Thearch’s numinous youth to open the nine-frost jade case and the seven-colored treasury, bringing forth two scrolls of the *Lingbao Vermilion Script Jade Instructions*, which he entrusted to the Southern Culmen to transmit to Qiu Zeng in accordance with their covenant. The assembled immortals witnessed the pact and all proclaimed its goodness.

**Jade Instructions of the Primordial Vermilion Script: Ingesting the Green Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Ninefold Azure Heaven**

The *Five Chapters of the Primordial Vermilion Script* emerged within the Great Void before the radiance of heaven and earth, before the dawn of creation. They silently wove the primordial root, establishing the Three Luminaries and setting the Five Qi in motion. The five colors divided and shone, illuminating the five directions, appointing the Five Thearchs, and guiding yin and yang. They turned the pivot of the Nine Heavens, revolved the brilliance of the Five Stars, nurtured the Five Peaks to stabilize the earth, and nourished the Five Palaces to cultivate the spirit.

Thus, the Perfected constantly rely upon the first light of yang to guide the harmonious qi of the Nine Heavens above and draw the fragrant flow of Jade Springs below, summoning primordial essence to the Great Ultimate and calling the Five Thearchs to the numinous youth. Those who bathe in it do not decline; those who preserve it know no end. They reverse the myriad kalpas to renew themselves, safeguarding the Five Molars in their countenance—truly the wondrous instructions of Lingbao, the ancestral teaching of the myriad sages.

**Method for Cultivating the Green Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Ninefold Azure Heaven of the East:**
On the day of *Lichun*, at cock’s crow, enter your chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright and click your teeth nine times. Visualize the Eastern Azure Treasure Flower Grove and the Azure Numinous Origin Elder Lord, whose surname is Men, personal name Kaiming, and style Lingweiyang. His form is nine inches tall, crowned with a cyan essence-jade coronet, clad in a ninefold qi azure feathered flying robe. He rides a chariot drawn by green dragons, bearing a quail banner, attended by ninety thousand officials of Jia-Yi and the Dark Elders, descending from the Nine Qi Azure Heaven into your chamber.

In an instant, azure qi is born, billowing like layered clouds, bathing your form. It enters through your mouth and descends directly into the liver palace. Then visualize the virtue of wood, shining brilliantly in the east, its light illuminating your body until all is distinct.

When finished, open your eyes and recite the incantation while looking upward:
*"Nine Qi Azure Heaven, primordial essence of the Primordial Beginning,
August Elder Divine Lord, clad in azure feathers,
Presiding over the celestial palace, shining like Jupiter,
Scattering radiance and flowing fragrance, refining my form.
Above, I feast on dawn’s mist; below, I guide the essence of wood.
I fortify and nourish the Green Molar, preserving decaying years.
My liver palace overflows, jade mushrooms sprout naturally.
Reversing a hundred million kalpas, my complexion returns to youth.
The Five Qi harmonize, heaven and earth endure together."*

When finished, guide the azure qi and swallow it nine times, then ingest the twelve characters of the Eastern Vermilion Script Jade Text.

These twelve characters are the names of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven. Guide the qi of the Azure Thearch and ingest the Green Molar—write them in vermilion on white paper, visualize them, then swallow them whole. The Nine Qi will descend of their own accord, the Azure Thearch will manifest at the sound of your voice, the Green Molar will be fortified in the Eastern Peak, and jade mushrooms will sprout in your liver palace.

Place the numinous youth in vigil beside your sleeping quarters, with azure-clad attendants serving for nine years. Through accumulated resonance and transformation, you will swiftly attain immortality and transcend the world, standing unshaken for ten thousand kalpas.

At cock’s crow, when the yang light first divides, face east and click your teeth nine times. Rub your palms until warm, then wipe your face nine times. Recite the incantation while looking upward:
*"Eastern Green Molar, ingesting the Green Molar,
Drinking the morning’s blossoms."*

When finished, use your tongue to stroke the outer edge of your upper teeth three times, then lick your lips three times, filling your mouth with Jade Spring and swallowing it three times. Guide the azure qi nine times to settle within your liver. This completes the method.

**Jade Instructions of the Primordial Vermilion Script: Ingesting the Vermilion Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Threefold Cinnabar Heaven**

**Method for Cultivating the Vermilion Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Threefold Cinnabar Heaven of the South:**
On the day of *Lixia*, at cock’s crow, enter your chamber, face south, and bow three times. Sit upright and click your teeth three times. Visualize the Southern Brahma Treasure Flourishing Yang Vermilion Numinous Elder Lord, whose surname is Dongfu, personal name Jiyan, and style Chibiaonu. His form is three inches tall, crowned with a cinnabar essence-jade coronet, clad in a threefold qi vermilion feathered flying robe. He rides a chariot drawn by cinnabar dragons, bearing a vermilion banner, attended by three hundred thousand officials of Bing-Ding and the Luminous Elders, descending from the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven into your chamber.

After a moment, a vermilion qi arises, radiant as the brilliance of fire, bathing and enveloping your form. It enters through your mouth and descends directly into the Heart Palace. Then visualize the Fire Star blazing brightly in the south, its light illuminating your body in full clarity.

When this is complete, open your eyes and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Threefold Qi Cinnabar Heaven,
Vermilion Palace Numinous Youth,
Primal Thearch of the Origin,
Attended by a triad of crimson dragons,
Clad in a feathered flying robe of cinnabar,
Adorned with a luminous brocade of radiance,
Driving and commanding the numinous officials,
Directing and guiding yin and yang,
The Threefold Qi exhales its splendor,
Irrigating my Crimson Palace.
The Red Child preserves and stabilizes,
Refining the molar and adorning the countenance.
At dawn, I feast upon vermilion effulgences,
Jade mushrooms fill me to abundance.
The turning of kalpas halts,
Withered bones revert to youth.
Longevity spans heaven and earth,
Endless as the waters’ flow.
Body born of water and fire,
Transforming in a hundred directions."*

When finished, guide the vermilion qi and swallow it three times, then cease. Next, ingest the twelve vermilion-script jade characters of the Southern Heaven.

These twelve characters are the names of the Threefold Cinnabar Heaven. To guide the Threefold Qi of the Vermilion Thearch and ingest the cinnabar molar, write them in vermilion script on white paper. After visualization, consume them at once, thereby drawing in the vermilion qi to fill and overflow, while fragrant mushrooms and mysterious infusions pour into the Crimson Palace. The Vermilion Thearch descends in true form through visualization, receiving the vermilion script from the Numinous Youth. Preserve the cinnabar molar to ensure permanence, nurture the Threefold Qi within Zhurong, wield the vermilion jade tablet to commune with the numinous, and employ the Five Chapters to summon the spirits. Through prolonged fasting and devotion in profound stillness, your name is inscribed in the Southern Window of Heaven. This may be called effortless attainment, yielding boundless and eternal fruition.

At cock’s crow, when yang light first divides, face south, click your teeth three times, rub your palms until warm, and wipe your face and eyes three times. Then recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Vermilion of the South,
Ingest the vermilion,
Drink from the Vermilion Pool."*

When finished, use your tongue to stroke the outer side of your lower teeth, lick your lips, and rinse your mouth until jade mushrooms fill it, then swallow three times. Again, guide the vermilion qi and swallow it three times, allowing it to settle within the Heart Palace. With this, the method is complete.

**Primal Vermilion Script for Ingesting the Molar and Guiding the Primal Qi of the Yellow Heaven**

**Method for Cultivating the Yellow Molar and Guiding the Twelvefold Qi of the Yellow Heaven of the Center:**
On the days of the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, and Winter Solstice, at cock’s crow, enter your chamber, face the center, and bow twelve times. Sit upright and click your teeth twelve times. Visualize the Central Jade Treasure Primal Numinous Elder Lord, whose surname is Tongban, personal name Yuanshi, and style Han Shuniu. His form is one foot two inches tall, crowned with a yellow essence-jade coronet, clad in a five-colored yellow feathered flying robe. He rides a chariot drawn by yellow dragons, bearing a yellow banner, attended by one hundred twenty thousand officials of Wu-Ji and the Luminous Elders, descending from the Twelvefold Qi Yellow Heaven into your chamber.

After a moment, a yellow qi arises, vibrant as the effulgence of auspicious clouds, bathing and enveloping your form. It enters through your mouth and descends directly into the Spleen Palace. Then visualize the Earth Star blazing brightly in the center of the sky, its light illuminating your body in full clarity.

When this is complete, open your eyes and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Central Yellow Song Mountain,
Primal Qi meanders in cycles,
Above resides the Primal Elder,
Governor of the Four Quarters,
Attended by a triad of yellow dragons,
Clad in a five-colored feathered robe,
Directing and guiding the Nine Heavens,
Turning the wheel of the celestial pivot.
The Earth Star blazes resplendent,
Its flowing light scatters radiance.
Jade blossoms and fragrant mushrooms
Fill and suffuse the four limbs.
They refine and irrigate my body,
The Spleen Palace unfurls in freshness.
Nurturing the molar and ingesting essence,
The myriad spirits converge in unity.
Governing the hun and restraining the po,
Refining the Eight Potencies in immortality’s alchemy.
Inner and outer shine with luminous clarity,
Eternal life without decay,
Communing with the numinous and attaining the real,
Ascending into the Grand Tenuity."*

When finished, guide the yellow qi and swallow it twelve times, then cease. Next, ingest the sixteen vermilion-script jade characters of the Central Heaven.

These sixteen characters are the names of the Central Yellow Heaven. To guide the Twelvefold Qi of the Yellow Thearch and ingest the yellow molar, write them in vermilion script on white paper. After visualization, consume them at once. This will draw the Primal Qi from the Nine Heavens above and infuse the Mysterious Gullet below, while the Granary of Qi naturally fills, and the Spleen Palace, unobstructed, steams with fragrance. The Yellow Elder responds in mysterious harmony, and the Numinous Youth unfastens his robe to reveal the script. The Yellow Simplicity circulates and flows, bestowing destiny to east and west. Wondrous indeed is this jade formula, the origin of the myriad immortals.

At cock’s crow, when yang light first divides, face the center, click your teeth twelve times, rub your palms until warm, and wipe your face and eyes twelve times. Then recite the incantation:

*"Central Wu-Ji,
Lofty and majestic as Mount Tai,
Ingest the essence of qi,
Drink from the Sweet Spring."*

When finished, use your tongue to stroke the Mysterious Gullet above the tongue, gather the Jade Spring, lick your lips three times, and swallow. Again, guide the yellow qi and swallow it twelve times, allowing it to settle within the Spleen Palace. With this, the method is complete.

When this is complete, open your eyes and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Seven Numinous Seven Gates,
Resplendent in the glory of the Western Florescence,
Within resides the White August,
Abode of the Primal Origin,
Attended by a triad of white dragons,
The Sevenfold Qi towering and majestic,
Meandering at the Jade Gate,
Scattering the essence of vermilion auroras.
The Metal Star exhales its splendor,
Fragrant mushrooms cascade in abundance.
The Mysterious Gullet irrigates my body,
Nurturing my white molar.
Luminous stones gleam with fresh radiance,
Undying through ten thousand kalpas.
I drink from the flowing spring,
Feast upon the Great Harmony.
The Nine Heavens’ Thearch
Bestows jade blossoms.
Preserving years and halting aging,
White effulgences spread and unfold.
Abiding long with heaven and earth,
The Three Luminaries share eternity."*

By serving the gates of the Nine Heavens without pause, one’s lifespan equals that of the Primal Origin.

At the first cock’s crow, when yang begins to divide, face west, knock the teeth seven times, rub the palms until warm, and wipe the face and eyes seven times. Then recite while looking upward:

Consume the luminous stone,
Drink the numinous liquid."*

When finished, use the tongue to stroke the upper teeth, lick the lips, and rinse the mouth until jade mushrooms fill it, then swallow three times. Again, guide the white qi and swallow it seven times to settle within the Lung Palace. The method is now complete.

**Primal Origin’s Vermilion Script: Ingesting the Mysterious Molar and Guiding the Fivefold Qi of the Mysterious Heaven Jade Formula**

**Method for Cultivating the Mysterious Molar and Guiding the Fivefold Qi of the Mysterious Heaven:**
On the day of the Winter Solstice, at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face north, and perform five bows. Sit upright and knock the teeth five times. Visualize the Dark Elder Lord of the Five Numinous Spirits of the Northern Cavern-Yin, Solitary and Boundless, named Black Nodes, with the style Hidden Marquis Bureau. His form is five inches tall, crowned with a Dark Essence Jade Diadem, clad in a dark feathered flying robe, riding a black dragon jade chariot, bearing a black banner. He is attended by five hundred thousand officials of the Ren and Gui divisions, the Qiang and Elder ranks, descending from the midst of the Fivefold Qi’s Mysterious Heaven into the chamber. In an instant, black radiance arises, merging into obscurity, its brilliance like streaming stars. It washes over one’s form, entering through the mouth and descending directly to the Kidney Palace. Next, visualize the Water Star shining brightly, its northern light illuminating the body, all made distinct.

When finished, open the eyes and recite while looking upward:
*"Northern Mysterious Heaven,
Fivefold Qi dispersing numinosity,
Above resides the Great Spirit,
Primal Elder of the Original Essence.
Riding dragons and bearing banners,
Roaming and feasting in the Upper Capital.
This day is supremely auspicious,
Auspicious clouds spread their glory.
Flying mushrooms stream and scatter,
Abundant in all four directions.
Jade maidens of the Mysterious Gullet
Irrigate my form.
The Kidney Palace is firmly settled,
Decayed teeth regrow and strengthen.
The Five Palaces receive the true,
Communing upward with the numinous spirits.
The Five Elders descend to welcome,
The immortal path is swiftly achieved.
Transforming water and fire,
Clad in feathered azure robes.
Soaring through the Great Void,
Roaming to the Imperial Court.
Lifespan equals the Three Luminaries,
Eternal through ten thousand kalpas."*

When finished, guide the black qi and swallow it five times, then cease. Next, ingest the twelve-character Vermilion Script Jade Text of the Northern Quarter. These twelve characters are the names of the Fivefold Radiance of the Northern Mysterious Heaven. Guide the Black Thearch’s Fivefold Radiance and consume the mysterious molar—both inscribed in vermilion on white paper. After visualization, burn and ingest them. Then the Dark Elder will bear records in the Vermilion Palace, and the numinous youths will inscribe the red script. The Fivefold Qi flows with mushrooms, irrigating the withered abode. Jade springs surge abundantly, sprouting at the Central Gate. The spirit settles the numinous chamber, the Kidney Palace flourishes with vitality, and the Jade Maidens of the Great Mystery are dispatched east and west. Unwaning through ten thousand kalpas, one abides together with the Dark Elder.

At the first cock’s crow, when yang light begins to divide, face north, knock the teeth five times, rub the palms until warm, and wipe the face and eyes five times. Then recite while looking upward:
*"Northern mysterious essence,
Consume the mysterious essence,
Drink the jade nectar."*

When finished, use the tongue to stroke the inner side of the lower teeth, lick the lips, and rinse the mouth until jade mushrooms fill it, then swallow three times. Again, guide the black qi and swallow it five times to settle within the Kidney Palace. The method is now complete.

---

The Dao states: The method for guiding and consuming the molar should be practiced on the days of the eight solar terms. Enter the chamber in each respective direction, purify with a fast, visualize the forms of the Five Elders, and recite the incantations. Afterward, guide and ingest the names of the heavens according to each direction. Practicing this for eight years, immortal officials will descend, jade maidens will attend, and the body will emanate light, illuminating the ten directions. Moving in and out, the Five Thearchs will bow in reverence, and the three realms’ administrators will welcome you. This rank corresponds to the titles of the Perfected of the Three Heavens.

This text is preserved within the Southern Garden’s Red Cavern and Five Cities. The immortal officials of the Three Heavens guard it in full, stored within a twelve-tiered immortal tower, encased in a purple jade coffer, inscribed on yellow gold tablets, sealed with cinnabar mushrooms and luminous grass, and stamped with the Central Seal of the Most High. It is only transmitted to those whose names are recorded in the immortal registers, inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace, and destined to become the Perfected of the Three Heavens. Without such inherent endowment, one will never glimpse its pages. By ancient statutes, it is transmitted once every four hundred years.

At cock’s crow, compose the body and settle the spirit, then proceed in order. First ingest the green-toothed qi of the Eastern Direction, then the Southern, then the Central, then the Western, then the Northern, following the standard method of the Five Thearchs. When finished, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva twenty-five times, and conclude with the incantation:

*"White rock, sheer and steep,
Flowing source, gushing spring,
Washed with jade nectar,
Drink and live forever,
Lifespan ever lengthening."*

When done, stir the tongue around the upper, lower, and central parts of the mouth until jade mushrooms fill the mouth, then swallow three times in sets of three. Again draw qi twenty-five times, hold it to the utmost, and swallow. The Dao is now complete.

**The Primordial Five Elders’ Visualization of the Five Peaks and Five Thearchs: Jade Formula for Summoning Spirits and Seeking Immortality**

Whenever cultivating the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s true writs, visualizing deities and reciting immortal names, or seeking any desire, one will at times hear the Perfected of the Nine Heavens arrive at one’s chamber and attain the body of a divine immortal.

On the *jiayin* or *yimao* day after the Beginning of Spring, bathe, purify, and fast. At dawn, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, knock the teeth nine times, and summon the body’s spirits. When finished, close the eyes and visualize the Green Thearch Lord of Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak, surnamed Xuānqiū, personal name Mùlù. His form is nine inches and nine parts tall, wearing a green jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a green feathered flying robe, riding a green dragon, attended by twelve green-waisted jade maidens. He descends from the Eastern Direction into your chamber. After a long while, the Green Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within green qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the liver. Visualize the heart generating red qi to bathe and surround the liver palace. The green and red qi merge in primordial chaos, like auspicious clouds in boundless mist. When you feel the liver suffused with warmth, swallow nine times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Nine gates of the Eastern Heaven,
Within dwells the Primordial August One,
Who enters and exits the Three Clarities,
Roaming and feasting in the Flowery Chambers.
Pacifying and guarding the numinous peak,
Commanding and dispatching Gou Mang,
Above entwined with green auroras,
Ninety million layers thick.
Attended by feathered ranks,
Twelve flying dragons,
Left served by green-waisted maidens,
Right guarded by divine youths,
Holding jade tablets and registers,
Inscribed with green writs.
Examining and determining immortal names,
Reporting them to the Upper Palace.
Today, O August King, is most auspicious.
I present my petition:
My body bears the Red Writ,
My name enters the Thearch’s hall.
I vow to attain divinity, I vow to attain immortality,
Recorded in the green register.
Turn back your numinous carriage,
Descend into my chamber.
The two qi merge and blend,
Transforming into an infant’s form.
Pacifying and governing the liver palace,
Summoning radiant brilliance.
Numinous splendor flows and bathes,
My face assumes a golden countenance.
Seated, I attain spontaneity,
Spirits and gods commune.
My body attains longevity,
Heaven and Earth know no end."*

When finished, draw green qi and swallow nine times.

Practicing this Dao for nine years, the numinous officials of the Eastern Peak and the Green Thearch will descend in truth, sending nine green-waisted jade maidens to serve you, enabling communication with the Nine Heavens. Your parents in life and death, your karmic records and punitive labors, assigned to the Eastern Peak, will have their spirits re-entrusted, sins erased, and liberation attained, ascending to the Hall of Blessings. This method is wondrous and profound, a bridge between life and death.

On the *bingwu* or *dingsi* day after the Beginning of Summer, bathe, purify, and fast. At noon, enter the chamber, face south, and bow three times. Sit upright, knock the teeth three times, and summon the body’s spirits. When finished, close the eyes and visualize the Red Thearch Lord of Mount Heng of the Southern Peak, surnamed Yán, personal name Yángguāng. His form is three inches and three parts tall, wearing a red jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a cinnabar feathered flying robe, riding a red dragon, attended by twelve red-jade maidens. He descends from the Southern Direction into your chamber. After a long while, the Red Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within red qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the heart. Visualize the spleen generating yellow qi to bathe and surround the heart palace. The yellow and red qi merge in primordial chaos, like blazing flames in resplendent light. When you feel the heart suffused with warmth, swallow three times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Three qi of the Cinnabar Heaven,
Southern Upper Jade Gate,
Within dwells the great spirit,
The Numinous Lord Red Thearch,
Clad in cinnabar, girded with talismans,
Flying patterns on feathered skirts.
Riding a red dragon,
Jade chariot on crimson clouds.
On the numinous Mount Heng of the South,
Myriad spirits hold him in highest reverence.
Entering and exiting the Three Clarities,
Feasting above in the Nine Mysteries.
Red-jade maidens attend and serve,
Jade youths guard the Perfected,
Holding jade tablets and registers,
Crimson writs on jade slips.
Examining and determining immortal ranks,
Reporting their weight to the heavens.
Today, O Great King,
The numinous peak opens the immortal path.
Turn back the myriad spirits,
Descend into my three gates.
Transforming into an infant,
Pacifying the heart and settling the hun-soul.
The two qi merge and blend,
Entwining my life’s root.
Ever with Zhu Rong,
Riding auroras,
Roaming the Southern Heights,
Heaven and Earth enduring forever."*

When finished, draw red qi and swallow three times.

Practicing this Dao for three years, the numinous officials of Mount Heng of the South and the Red Thearch will descend in truth, sending three red-jade maidens to serve you, fulfilling all petitions and granting every request. Your parents in life and death, your karmic records and punitive labors, assigned to the Southern Peak, will all be dissolved, criminal names released, and you will ascend to the Heavenly Offices. This method is wondrous and profound, opening the passage between life and death.

On the *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jichou*, or *jiwei* day after the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, or Winter Solstice, bathe, purify, and fast. At sunset, enter the chamber, face the center, and bow twelve times. Sit upright, knock the teeth twelve times, and summon the body’s spirits. When finished, close the eyes and visualize the Yellow Thearch Lord of Mount Song of the Central Peak, surnamed Jué, personal name Pǔshēng. His form is one foot and two inches tall, wearing a yellow jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a yellow feathered flying robe, riding a yellow dragon, attended by twelve yellow-silk jade maidens. He descends from the Central Peak into your chamber. After a long while, the Yellow Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within yellow qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the spleen palace. Visualize the lungs generating white qi to bathe and surround the spleen palace. The yellow and white qi merge in primordial chaos, like yellow clouds swirling in the heavens. When you feel the spleen suffused with warmth, swallow twelve times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

Central Heaven’s Yellow Origin, sovereign over the Four Numinous Ones, earthly stems wù and jǐ of the Central Mountain, primordial essence of the Supreme Beginning—Great Spirit of the Yellow Thearch, ascending in a flying chariot drawn by three, twelve yellow dragons soaring to feast in the Three Clarities, jade maidens in attendance, divine youths as messengers, opening mountains to reveal charts, verifying immortals and fixing names, lingering upon the Central Peak, the Solar King dispenses numinous power, returning in a winding descent to pour and irrigate my form. In primordial chaos and transformation, the Ancient Thearch becomes an infant, settling and pacifying the Yellow Palace, its repository flourishing in splendor. My body bears wondrous hairs, radiant within and without. When perfected beings commune, I penetrate the Nine Clarities, ascend to join the Yellow Chariot, and fly upward to the Jade Court.

Conclude by drawing yellow qi and swallowing twelve times.

Practicing this Way for twelve years, the numinous officials of the Central Peak and the Five Thearchs descend to your chamber, sending twelve Yellow-Silk Jade Maidens to open and communicate your passages, making your prayers heard in the Nine Heavens. Parents of life and death, criminal records and penal names bound to the Central Peak—all are untied and dispersed, criminal records obliterated, your name inscribed in the immortal register. You depart the earthly palace and ascend into the Hall of Blessings, opening the passage between life and death, delivering countless beings.

Perform this on the gēngshēn or xīnyǒu day following the Autumn Equinox. At dusk, bathe, purify yourself, enter the chamber, face west, and bow seven times. Sit evenly and knock your teeth seven times to summon the spirits of your body.

Conclude by closing your eyes and visualizing the White Thearch Lord of the Western Peak Mount Hua, surnamed Hàojiū, personal name Yuáncāng. His form is seven inches and seven fen tall, wearing a plain-jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a plain feathered flying robe, riding a white dragon, attended by twelve White-Silk Jade Maidens. He descends from the Western Peak into your chamber. After a long while, the White Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within white qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the lung palace. Visualize the kidneys generating black qi to bathe and surround the lung palace. The white and black qi merge in primordial chaos, like auspicious clouds vanishing into the empyrean. When you feel the lungs suffused with warmth, swallow seven times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

Heaven of the Seven Qi, the Pale Sovereign’s Golden Hall—Great Spirit of the White Thearch, pacifying and settling the West. The numinous mountain of Huàyīn, called the Divine King, clad in a white-feathered flying skirt, bearing banners and driving dragons, roams the Dark Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Palace. Overseer of the immortal registers, arranging the records of all directions, on auspicious days and propitious hours, myriad sages feast and descend, lingering amidst the Nine Rosy Clouds, scattering radiant splendor. Golden essence gleams, white stones surge. Opening the immortal’s vision of the numinous, the spirit spreads to the four quarters. Wishing for the Dao, wishing for immortality, wishing for life, wishing for longevity—when these highest wishes converge, none fail to prosper. Gathering and refining to penetrate the true, transform my form and appearance. Through spontaneous transformation, I soar with the qi, my body flying and bones light, ascending to the Purple Chamber.

Conclude by drawing white qi and swallowing seven times.

Practicing this Way for seven years, the numinous officials of the Western Peak and the White Thearch descend in truth, sending seven White-Silk Jade Maidens to open your numinous passages and communicate your prayers, all of which are heard in the Nine Heavens. Parents of life and death, criminal records and penal names bound to the Western Peak—all are released and absolved, criminal records self-erased, your name inscribed in the immortal register. You depart the Five Paths and forever ascend to the Hall of Blessings, opening the passage between life and death, with blessings and felicity naturally arising.

Perform this on the rénzǐ or guǐhài day following the Winter Solstice. At midnight, bathe, purify yourself, enter the chamber, face north, and bow five times. Sit evenly and knock your teeth five times to summon the spirits of your body.

Conclude by closing your eyes and visualizing the Black Thearch Lord of the Northern Peak Mount Heng, surnamed Fú, personal name Tōngméng. His form is five inches and five fen tall, wearing a dark-jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a dark feathered flying robe, riding a black dragon, attended by twelve Supreme Mystery Jade Maidens. He descends from the Northern Peak into your chamber. After a long while, the Black Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within black qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the kidney palace. Visualize the liver generating blue-black qi to bathe and surround the kidney palace. The blue-black and black qi merge in primordial chaos, like azure clouds vanishing into mist. When you feel the kidneys suffused with warmth, swallow five times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

Heaven of the Five Qi, primordial essence flowing from the Supreme Beginning, congealing qi and coagulating numen—called the Immortal’s Abode. Settling and pacifying the Northern Heng, where the Black Thearch roams, feasting in the Northern Solitary Realm, ascending with dragons in a floating chariot. Today is the Solar King’s auspicious day, myriad spirits open the charts. The Five Qi linger, auspicious clouds spread to the four quarters. Immortal youths hold the registers, the Supreme Mystery transmits the talismans, inscribing my immortal record, the Golden Register written above. Returning in a winding descent, merging with the infant, the two qi intertwine, thoroughly irrigating my body. Dark and profound, I grasp the handle, immortals as my companions, eternally enjoying Heaven and Earth, enduring through ten thousand kalpas without end.

Conclude by drawing black qi and swallowing five times.

Practicing this Way for five years, the numinous officials of the Northern Peak and the Black Thearch descend in truth, sending five Supreme Mystery Jade Maidens to serve and command you, communicating your prayers and petitions, all of which are heard in the Nine Heavens. Parents of life and death, criminal names and penal records bound to the Northern Peak—all are absolved and released, enabling you to cross the Three Evil Paths and ascend to the Heavenly Hall. This wondrous and supreme method delivers boundless beings.

In practicing this Way, always maintain a calm mind and focused intention, making the numinous and true easily perceptible. Mastering its forms without deviation, year after year you will witness the spirits’ comings and goings, while heavenly officials welcome you, demonic spirits vanish and submit, daring not to approach. Your mind becomes keen and your thoughts wise, enabling you to discern good and ill fortune. The Five Peaks and Five Thearchs become your constant companions, spirits and deities communicate, and you swiftly attain immortality.

The *Yuánshǐ Língbǎo Wǔdì Jiàojì Zhāozhēn Yùjué* states: The Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Red Writings, each guarding a direction, are all spontaneous writings of the Yuánshǐ. The Five Elders attend the Five Thearchs in the five directions, with numinous officials overseeing the records, their prohibitions lifted once every three years for the assembly of immortals to celebrate the true. According to ancient statutes and former canons, the perfected of the Upper Palaces and the immortals of the Five Peaks, once every three years, offer to the numinous officials of the Five Thearchs of the Numinous Treasure: swans and egrets, fragrant wine, sweet fruits, and other offerings to the heavenly perfected, thereby sustaining the numinous qi.

Those who consistently practice thus will move the spirits of the Five Thearchs of the Numinous Treasure, and the numinous officials of the five directions shall rejoice in response. In all rites, whether lavish or modest, what matters is the sincerity that arises from within—where there is utmost devotion, humans and spirits resonate. Thus, the forms and protocols are recorded here for secret cultivation.

According to the ancient statutes for summoning the numinous officials of the Five Thearchs of the Numinous Treasure:
- In spring, use the days of *jiǎyín* and *yǐmǎo*;
- In summer, use *dīngsì* and *bǐngwǔ*;
- During the four seasons’ transitions, use *wùchén*, *wùxū*, *jǐwèi*, and *jǐchǒu*;
- In autumn, use *gēngshēn* and *xīnyǒu*;
- In winter, use *guǐhài* and *rénzǐ*.

On the day of the *jiànwáng* ritual, construct a high altar upon a sacred peak, purifying the four directions. At the eastern, southern, western, and northern cardinal points, and at the central *wáng* position, open five gates and place five placards, each inscribed as follows:

**Eastern Placard** (written in blue):
*Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Peaceful Treasure Flourishing Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder, Azure Thearch; Nine Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Perfected Kings; Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens; Eastern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.*
Install at the eastern-facing gate.

**Southern Placard** (written in red):
*Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, Brahmā-Treasure Radiant Prosperity, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder, Red Thearch; Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lords; Primordial Qi Venerable; Vermilion Palace Grand Cinnabar Jade Maidens; Southern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.*
Install at the southern-facing gate.

**Central Placard** (written in yellow):
*Primordial Cavern Supreme Thearch’s Mountain, Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder, Yellow Thearch; Supreme Thearch Perfected; Vermilion Elixir Yellow Court Wuji Heavenly Granary Jade Maidens; Central Yellow Supreme Thearch’s Officials; Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate.*
Install to the left of the central *wáng* gate.

**Western Placard** (written in white):
*Seven Qi of the Heavens, Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder, White Thearch; Bright Stone Seven Qi Ministers; Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maidens; Western Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Penetrating Yin Golden Watchtower Gate.*
Install at the western-facing gate.

**Northern Placard** (written in black):
*Five Qi of the Mysterious Heavens, Cavern Yin Solitary Obscurity, Five Numinous Dark Elder, Black Thearch; Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Numinous Lords; Night-Shining Jade Maidens; Northern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Yin Birth Vast Numinous Gate.*
Install at the northern-facing gate.

**Placard for the Host of Perfected** (written in purple):
*Nine Heavens’ Host of Numinous Ones, Perfected of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains; Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways; Numinous Officials, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens; Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials; [Invited to] the Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate on the right.*
Install to the right of the central *wáng* gate.

These five gates correspond to the Five Qi Gates of the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Palace. The immortals and host of perfected, when not entering through their respective directional gates, all pass through the Yellow Thearch’s gate on the right.

Once the five gates are installed, erect screens on all four sides to block the wind, preventing the firelight and qi from scattering. Keep the flames contained, avoiding excessive brightness that would disperse the numinous qi. Spread a five-foot mat and arrange it according to the season—facing east in spring. Prepare one swan or egret, thoroughly cooked. Offer five *dǒu* of fragrant wine, kept pure and aromatic. Present fruits according to abundance and rarity. Use eleven fine, new cups and ladles, with three sets of vessels: two sets of five cups each, and one set of a single cup, placed beneath the five-cup sets. Arrange five incense fires in sequence before the vessels, and three sets of fruits likewise. Reserve additional wine and meat in separate containers, placed before the seats.

On the altar, lay out five *chǐ* of cinnabar-patterned crimson silk and the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s True Writings along with the five talismans. Cut five *chǐ* of azure-patterned silk from the Azure Grove to cover the true writings and talismans, placing them behind the seats. Position the talismans within the cinnabar and azure silk, symbolizing the covenant of hair-cutting and blood-oath. The azure silk substitutes for hair, and the cinnabar for the blood-oath—perfected beings avoid harming their spirit or diminishing their virtue, hence these substitutes.

Prepare five kinds of incense, blended together. Use new, fine censers, arranged in sequence. Kneel with sashes tied to invoke the deities. Speak softly and humbly, so that the heavenly perfected may descend in secret resonance. Inscribe six wooden tablets with cinnabar on white silver, inviting the Five Thearchs and the host of numinous officials, placing them beneath the five incense fires.

**Invocation for the East:**
*Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Peaceful Treasure Flourishing Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder, Azure Thearch; Azure Teeth Nine Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Perfected Kings; Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens; Eastern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.*

**Invocation for the South:**
*Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, Brahmā-Treasure Radiant Prosperity, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder, Red Thearch; Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lords; Primordial Qi Venerable; Vermilion Palace Grand Cinnabar Jade Maidens; Southern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.*

**Invocation for the Center:**
*Primordial Cavern Supreme Thearch’s Mountain, Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder, Yellow Thearch; Supreme Thearch Perfected; Vermilion Elixir Yellow Court Wuji Heavenly Granary Jade Maidens; Central Yellow Supreme Thearch’s Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate on the left.*

**Invocation for the West:**
*Seven Qi of the Heavens, Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder, White Thearch; Bright Stone Seven Qi Ministers; Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maidens; Western Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Penetrating Yin Golden Watchtower Gate.*

**Invocation for the North:**
*Five Qi of the Mysterious Heavens, Cavern Yin Solitary Obscurity, Five Numinous Dark Elder, Black Thearch; Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Numinous Lords; Night-Shining Jade Maidens; Northern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Yin Birth Vast Numinous Gate.*

**Invocation for the Host of Perfected:**
*Nine Heavens’ Host of Numinous Ones, Perfected of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains; Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways; Numinous Officials, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens; Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you.*

Descend through the Primordial Yellow High Morning Gate on the right. Place the five vermilion-written tablets beneath the five incense flames. After reading each tablet, invite one Thearch, bow twice, and deposit the tablet, proceeding in order according to the rite. The final tablet should be positioned to the right of the center. Once the Celestial Officials have all been sent off, bury the tablets in the five directions of the mountain. This is the ancient canon of the Mysterious Capital; the pattern must not be altered, lest the Heavenly Perfected fail to descend and misfortune befall the omen.

After arranging the tablets, modulate your voice and declare of your own accord:
*On the [day] of the [month] of the [year], [Your Name], Perfected of the Thearch of [Place], aged [number] years, having received on the [day] of the [month] of the [year] from [Name], Perfected of the [Peak] Peak, the Five Elder Perfected Writs of the Most High Numinous Treasure—Five Chapters of the Spontaneous Vermilion Script and Mandates—now, in reverent accordance with the ancient canon and ritual code of the Mysterious Capital, purify myself with fasting and ablutions, suffuse the divine chamber with incense, and humbly invite the Five Thearch Lords, the Five Thearch Numinous Officials, Perfected Ones, Divine Immortals, and Jade Maidens. With the solemnity of the wild goose and egret, I offer fragrant wine, sweet fruits, and pure sincerity, purifying body and spirit to receive the Most High August Heavenly Worthy. I beseech the dispatch of the Five Body Perfected Officials, the Three Hun and Seven Po, and the Three Palaces’ Perfected Ones to ascend to the Nine Heavens, to the palaces of the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, the Five Outer Regions, the Azure Tooth Heaven, the Vermilion Cinnabar Heaven, the Great Thearch’s Mountain, the Central Yellow Heaven, the Bright Stone Heaven, the Mysterious Nourishment Heaven, and the courts of the Five Thearch Perfected Ones of the Eight Directions. May they convey my entreaty, uphold the fast, and observe the rites with empty heart and reverent gaze, that the numinous chariot may turn and briefly descend to [Place], illuminating my sincere devotion. May the Perfected of the Five Talismans descend to partake of this humble offering.*

Conclude with two bows, prostrate for a long while, then rise to kneel. Take the Eastern tablet, read the text, and return it to its place. Again invite the supreme deities. Humbly welcome the descent of:
*The Eastern Numinous Might Azure Thearch Lord, Azure Tooth Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Perfected King, Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct.*

Proceed to read the Southern tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:
*The Southern Blazing Might Vermilion Thearch Lord, Vermilion Cinnabar Three Qi Heavenly Lord, Primordial Qi Venerable, Vermilion Palace Great Cinnabar Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Southern Precinct.*

Proceed to read the Central tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:
*The Central Pivot-Embracing Yellow Thearch Lord, Great Thearch Perfected One, Vermilion Child Yellow Court Earth-Aether Granary Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Central Great Thearch’s Court.*

Proceed to read the Western tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:
*The Western Radiant Soul Treasure White Thearch Lord, Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master, Most High White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Western Precinct.*

Proceed to read the Northern tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:
*The Northern Concealed Might Black Thearch Lord, Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Numinous Lord, Night-Shining Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Northern Precinct.*

Proceed to read the tablet for the Host of Numinous Ones in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:
*The Host of Numinous Ones of the Nine Heavens, Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains, Numinous Officials of the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens, Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials.*

For each of the six positions of the Five Thearchs and Host of Perfected, bow twice, totaling twelve bows to welcome the Thearchs’ descent. Upon completion, send off the Thearchs, addressing them as *I humbly labor the [Title] Thearch*. Bow twice again, totaling eleven bows. The rite of libation concludes here.

After inviting the Heavenly Perfected, offer wine five times and burn incense, then declare of your own accord:
*I, [Your Name], by fortunate karmic affinity from past lives, have in this kalpa of the Nine Heavens been granted the grace to encounter this luminous era, wherein the Dao and its methods flourish. Thus, this unworthy self has been permitted to partake in the Five Chapters of the Vermilion Script, the Five Talismans, and the Treasure Scriptures. Since my presumptuous receipt of these, I have revered the Supreme Perfected, yearned for divine transcendence, yet my sincerity remains shallow and feeble, unable to move the numinous. I constantly fear my sinful self will sink into the clamor of defilement, drowning in the Nine Springs. Yet the Heavenly Compassion is vast; may it extend to my humble efforts, as I uphold faith and devotion, maintain perpetual fasting, contemplate the divine, cultivate goodness, and aspire to boundless deliverance. Yet my sincerity is narrow and weak, unable to manifest itself. The profound mysteries of the Numinous Writs and the distant majesty of the Heavenly Worthy deter me from presuming to approach. Today, on this auspicious day, I purify body and fast, offering sacrifice to the Five Numinous Ones, Five Elders, Five Thearchs, and all Lords and Venerables. I humbly labor the radiance of the divine, beseeching the Most True Heavenly Worthy to condescend to my lowly state with compassion and reverence. Overwhelmed by the Heavenly Light’s far-reaching gaze, which leaves nothing unseen, I now make this declaration. Following the ancient canon of my former masters, I have pledged in vermilion and ink, observing silence in my practice, daring not to divulge [the teachings]. Only after five times eight [days] may they be revealed, to secure the covenant of transcendence. May the Five Thearchs take heed: I seek the true talismans, scriptures, and charts, with divine attendants to guard and protect my person. Whether ascending mountains, traversing ridges, entering forests, or crossing ravines, may all my pursuits and aspirations be fulfilled. May metal and stone open, and divine spirits commune with me, granting all my wishes. In gathering herbs and fungi, may none remain hidden. May mountain spirits submit and conceal themselves, and all trials leave me unharmed. May tigers, wolves, and venomous stings not afflict me. May Jade Maidens and Divine Lads attend me in all directions. May the Five Thearchs’ numinous qi descend into my form, settling and stabilizing the Five Palaces, sharpening inner and outer senses, enlightening mind and intent, granting foresight of fortune and misfortune. May the Three Corpses vanish, the Nine Worms perish, and my body grow wondrous hairs, hastening my attainment of divine transcendence. I implore the Most August Great Thearch to bestow compassion upon this humble one among the masses, granting my entreaties. Overwhelmed by this vast grace, I dedicate myself to diligent service. With utmost reverence and awe, I prostrate and bow twice.*

Offer wine three more times and prostrate. If there are private matters to declare, present them as you see fit. After stating your wishes, humbly labor the Eastern Numinous Might Azure Thearch, Azure Tooth Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Perfected King, Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.

Then honor the Southern Numinous Might Vermilion Thearch, Vermilion Tooth Three Qi Heavenly Lord, Primordial Qi Elder, Vermilion Palace Great Cinnabar Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Southern Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.

Next honor the Central Pivot-Containing Yellow Thearch, Supreme Thearch Perfected, Vermilion Child Yellow Court Earth Granary Jade Maiden, Central Yellow Supreme Thearch Officials, and all Numinous Officials to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.

Then honor the Western Radiant Soul Treasure White Thearch, Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master, Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Western Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.

Next honor the Northern Concealed Marquis Black Thearch, Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord, Supreme Numinous Lord, Night Radiance Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Northern Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.

Then honor the multitude of numinous beings of the Nine Heavens, the Perfected of the Five Marchmounts and Numinous Mountains, the Numinous Officials and Earth Immortals and Jade Maidens of the Three Offices and Nine Treasuries of the rivers and four floods, and the Flying Immortals and Divine Immortals and Perfected Lords of the Five Marchmounts to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.

The ritual of offering and libation is now complete. Retrieve the tablets and bury them beneath the five gates, with the tablets of the multitude of Perfected buried beneath the central gate.

This rite is performed once every three years, and three times in nine years, after which it ceases.

*Ritual of the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure True Writs and Jade Instructions for Transmission from the Mysterious Capital*

The Perfected Master of the Numinous Treasure and Grotto-Mysterious [such-and-such] Marchmount, your humble servant [so-and-so], prostrates and bows twice, kowtows in fear of death, and respectfully addresses the Jade Augustness of the Most High, Utmost Perfected, and Greatly Sagely Venerable Lords, the Five Elders of Primordial Beginning:

Your humble servant, born in the lower world, has encountered karmic conditions in this life. Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, I have revolved without cessation. Yet by the accumulated blessings of former lives, my fortune has extended to the present body, allowing me to enter the Dharma-gate. My name is recorded in the imperial register of the Thearch, inscribed in the august scrolls, and my person bears the numinous tally. I have received the Golden Writs of the Three Caverns, the Purple Scripts and Vermilion Chapters of the Upper Clarity, and the Five Vermilion Writs of the Numinous Treasure and Grotto-Mysterious Five Chapters of True Writs.

My former master, the Perfected Master of [such-and-such] Marchmount, [so-and-so] Lord, transmitted these to me for wearing upon my person. They guard and protect the Perfected, command qi and dispatch spirits, and enact the Orthodox Dao. By this grace, disasters have vanished and misfortunes have receded. My family and state enjoy peace, and the efficacy of the Dao has become manifest—its luminous Way should be transmitted.

In the past, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month of the [such-and-such] year, I ascended [such-and-such] Marchmount to swear an oath before the Nine Heavens, vowing that within forty years, I would transmit these teachings to one whose bones and appearance accord with the charts and who meets the ritual requirements.

Since receiving the Dharma, the allotted years have been fulfilled. Now there is an advanced disciple, the Perfected of [such-and-such] Marchmount, [so-and-so], born in the [such-and-such] year of the [such-and-such] life, aged [such-and-such] years, born in the [such-and-such] month. His fate belongs to the Eastern Dipper, his name is recorded on Mount Tai, and his register is kept by the Azure Marchmount. His qi and bones harmonize with the Perfected. He has already received the Numinous Writs of the Nine Heavens and the Upper Dharma, yet his understanding remains shallow and narrow. He has not beheld the origin of the Dao, nor plumbed the roots of Heaven. The Five Thearchs do not oversee him, and the Nine Heavens have not yet heard of him. Yet he has faithfully and arduously sought the cinnabar elixir, accumulating years of supplication. He has laid bare his heart in oaths, moving both humans and spirits.

I now present twenty-four thousand coins of gold, corresponding to the twenty-four qi of life, along with nine taels of refined gold to swear an oath before the Nine Heavens. I offer forty feet of patterned silk for each of the Five Thearchs to entreat the Five Elders and Supreme Perfected.

These gold coins are not found in the Red Continent; I humbly request that various treasures be accepted as their equivalent to fulfill the required amount. I prostrate and make this entreaty, swearing a covenant for my seven ancestors, binding both life and death to this vow. Should I violate the mysteries of the Nine Heavens’ Upper Dharma, I accept death as punishment. In life and death, my parents and I will be consigned to the offices of ghostly officials, swallowing our voices and stifling our breath, daring not to speak.

Your humble servant [so-and-so], with a sincere heart and earnest devotion, has been blessed by accumulated fortune to partake of the Numinous Writs. Having perused their scrolls and beheld their contents, I am fit to attain the perfection of the Dao. I have fasted and purified myself, ascended the numinous mountain, and sworn an oath before Heaven to transmit the Writs. Following the clear statutes, I now confer them upon this disciple.

Daring not act presumptuously, I prostrate upon the altar of the Great Yang’s Numinous Platform and present a memorial on yellow silk with vermilion text to make this known. May the High Numinous Venerable Lords, the Chancellors of the Nine Heavens, deign to reflect upon my petition and take pity on my sincere heart.

Should the August Ones above deign to proclaim this, may the Heavenly Perfected of the Five Thearchs and Five Marchmounts, the Numinous Treasure and Primordial Beginning Great Spirits, deliver my nine generations of ancestors to ascend into the Southern Palace. May their withered bones be crowned and girdled, their decayed frames restored to bloom, and their exhausted souls, revolving in suffering, be transformed to enter the gates of immortality. May the spirits already ascended advance in rank within the immortal palaces, their names inscribed in jade, recorded in the golden registers and treasure repositories of the Nine Heavens’ immortal records.

I entreat the Azure Tooth Azure Thearch of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven, the Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct, along with the Azure Dragon troops and generals of the Jia-Yi offices, numbering nine hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Liver.

I entreat the Vermilion Tooth Three Qi Heavenly Lord, the Primordial Qi Elder, the Vermilion Palace Great Cinnabar Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Southern Precinct, along with the Vermilion Dragon troops and generals of the Bing-Ding offices, numbering three hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Crimson Palace of the Heart.

I entreat the Yellow Thearch of the Primordial Grotto’s Supreme Thearch Mountain, the Supreme Thearch Perfected, the Vermilion Child Yellow Court Earth Granary Jade Maiden, the Central Yellow Supreme Thearch Officials, and the Numinous Officials, along with the Yellow Dragon troops and generals of the Wu-Ji offices, numbering twelve hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Spleen.

I entreat the White Thearch of the Seven Qi Heaven, the Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master, the Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Western Precinct, along with the White Dragon troops and generals of the Geng-Xin offices, numbering seven hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Lungs.

I entreat the Black Thearch of the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven, the Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord, the Supreme Numinous Lord, the Night Radiance Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Northern Precinct, along with the Black Dragon troops and generals of the Ren-Gui offices, numbering five hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Kidneys.

I entreat the Perfected Ones of the Five Marchmounts with their troops and cavalry, the Perfected Ones of the Four Waterways with their troops and cavalry, the Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces with their troops and cavalry, and the divine immortals and flying immortals with their mounts, numbering nine hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body, dispersing through the offices and palaces to securely guard the physical form within the Five Viscera and Six Palaces, the Nine Palaces and Three Primes, following the protective and defensive qi, harmonizing the hun and restraining the po, preserving the spirit and nurturing the essence, gathering qi and refining the immortal, coagulating the marrow and transforming the bones, and refining the blood vessels into perfection.

At dawn, they ingest the primordial efflorescence and the five-toothed mushroom blossoms, rinse the Jade Pool, and let the fluids generate spontaneously, filling the interior and overflowing externally, their radiance and luminosity penetratingly bright. A circular image appears upon the neck, illuminating the ten directions. They roam the world, greeted by the officials of the Three Realms, the celestial and terrestrial deities of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, who bow in attendance and escort them. The myriad spirits guard the Perfected, summoning clouds and descending rain, commanding the Eight Might to summon dragons, performing a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, instantly responding to the natural order.

When the great kalpas cycle and vast calamities surge from the four directions, the body attains flight and traverses heavenly disasters. Amid the Eight Difficulties and a thousand perils with ten thousand poisons, all are dissolved and extinguished. Demons are vanquished and trials repelled, malevolent spirits slain and treachery severed. They perceive the hidden and the manifest, discern fortune and misfortune in reverse, and command the celestial officials. Sitting, they summon the divine immortals of the ten directions to arrive spontaneously, transforming their radiance and refining their form, sitting or standing at will, vanishing or appearing. They ascend to the Upper Clarity, accompanying their nine generations of ancestors to ascend the Nine Heavens together.

After the disciple receives the Perfection, they close their mouth and cultivate in secrecy, awaiting the celestial Perfected. Fathers do not instruct sons; it resides solely within the self. After seven years and within forty years, if one encounters a person of immortal attainment, they shall report to the Nine Heavens for transmission, where the Four Controllers, Five Thearchs, and Three Officials will summon and examine the disciple’s nine generations of ancestors, overseeing the covenant and scrutinizing their conduct and adherence to the precepts, ensuring no violation of the celestial numina. In life and death, they shall attain immortality together.

Should they transgress the celestial statutes, divulging the Perfected Texts midway, the living and deceased parents, along with the disciple’s own body, shall confess their sins before the Four Luminaries, enduring the Wind Blade for ten thousand kalpas and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, never daring to seek pardon. Before the disciple fully participates in the Great Rites, their thousand transgressions and ten thousand sins are beseeched for absolution. From this day forth, they renew their vows and present their petition, which ascends to be memorialized before the Supreme, the Cavernous Mystery, the Numinous Treasure, the Primordial Jade August, and the Five Elder Thearchs.

May they deign to bestow their luminous regard and universally inform the myriad spirits, all wishing the disciple’s name to endure as a Perfected One, illumined by the Three Luminaries and eternally abiding with the Five Qi. We implore the August and Venerable Supreme Dao of the Utmost Perfection of the Nine Heavens, the Celestial Perfected, to discern and compassionately attend to this plea.

Your servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates in submission, kowtowing repeatedly to memorialize this entreaty. Your servant, of the surname [X] from the prefecture and county of [Y],

To the Supreme, Primordial, August, and Venerable Supreme Dao; the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure; the Five Elder Jade August Thearchs; and the Great Sage, Jade August Sovereign.

In the year [Z], the month [A], and the day [B], presented at the Golden Dragon Post of [C] Mountain Peak in the prefecture and county of [D].

The ancient statutes of the Mysterious Capital confer the rites of the Upper Perfected, inscribed in vermilion upon yellow silk. When transmitting the scriptures and rites upon the numinous marchmounts, the texts are exposed for three days and three nights, undisturbed by wind or drifting, thereby deemed suitable for the Perfected. If encountered by wind, transmission is withheld. Should the texts be exposed to wind thrice, causing the memorial to flutter, such a person is deemed unsuitable, and transmission must not proceed. These celestial statutes are severe; master and disciple must together deliberate and exercise utmost caution, ensuring alignment with the celestial numina.
