**The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Grade for Flying Immortals of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure**

The *Scripture of the Supreme Grade for Flying Immortals of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure* is of unknown authorship. Four scriptures share this scroll. The source text comes from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Cavern Mystery Section, Original Texts Category.

The Dao speaks: The *Scripture of Flying Immortals* emerged from the Mysterious Wondrous Palace of Mount Taiyuan. The Perfected One, Master of Emptiness and Void, together with the Supreme Ones of the Ten Directions, the Immortals of the Five Peaks, and seven hundred thousand jade maidens of the Nine Heavens, assembled upon the Purple Jade Terrace of the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis. There, they expounded the *Great Scripture of the Boundless Samādhi of the Divine Net*, transforming the world below.

At that time, three hundred twenty thousand immortals and celestial beings arrived, bowing their heads to inquire of the Heavenly Worthy: "We, your disciples, are dull of heart and beset by the six extremes, unable to comprehend the opening and closing of the Dao. Formerly, we received the grace of our former masters, who bestowed upon us the Yellow, Red, and Purple Talismans, along with the true and secret teachings of the Three Caverns. We practiced the Dao to save others, never faltering in our resolve. Yet in this shallow and frivolous age, many do not believe in the Dao and the transformative power of the Three Caverns. Foolish people cling to perverse views, destined for the Nine Dark Hells of eternal night, with no hope of escape. Since they do not believe, what can be done? The great kalpa draws near, and heaven and earth will soon be destroyed. Before long, the waters shall rise, sweeping away nine hundred million beings. The people will scatter and dissolve like mud in the current, flowing into the sea like water—how can they be transformed?

The Heavenly Worthy’s heart of great compassion—how can such stubborn and benighted people be saved? Is there a special method we may hear?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Your question is most excellent, an inquiry into the boundless Dao. Now, there is an art of the immortals—listen carefully, and I shall transmit it to you in due course."

The Dao speaks: In the land of Jambudvīpa, transformation meets with disbelief. Those who seek to ascend as immortals must first receive the registers. The Yellow, Red, and Purple Talismans are the source of enlightenment. Later, with the guidance of the Three Masters, one may cross over and attain perfection. Receiving the thirty-six scriptures and contracts of the Perfected One’s boundless *Three Heavens of Great Illumination*, along with the divine incantations, one may slay demons and revive the living. When Daoists heal the sick and deliver the people, they should receive this scripture.

The vast multitude of the Great Wilderness, the talismans of the Nine Heavens’ soldiers, the registers for summoning a hundred ghosts, the great talismans of clouds and thunder, the talismans for warding off calamities, and the true contract of the Great One—these are the foundation of immortality. When Daoists receive these inner and outer registers of the Dao, they become immortals. In the process of attaining the Dao, one must practice the Dao according to the method. When merit is complete after three thousand deeds, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.

On the days of Gengshen and Jiazi, the days of one’s fate, and during the six fasts and ten auspicious days, one should burn incense and practice the Dao to dispel disasters, disperse misfortune, pacify the household, and seek blessings. Even a single or double practice must not be concealed. If one fails to do so, one’s descendants, seven generations of ancestors, and parents will be consigned to the eternal night of the Nine Dark Hells. Not only oneself but even the lowly and impoverished will suffer—endless lawsuits, disputes, and the daily harassment of officials and soldiers. If you seek the Dao, it lies within your heart. With a single heart devoted to the Dao, you too may become a flying immortal.

The Dao speaks: For Daoists seeking immortality and studying the Dao, the foremost practice is to establish fasts. Then, ten thousand spirits will abide in the empty mystery of the void, and countless officials and soldiers will fill the fasting hall. With single-minded devotion, you may discourse on the Dharma. Attaining this boundless flying immortality, ten thousand celestial beings, a hundred thousand jade maidens, and countless Supreme Ones will descend to witness the people’s fasts.

The method of fasting lies in diligence—you must not be careless in this.

The Dao speaks: At that time, the Flying Celestial Immortals King, the Heavenly Emperor Immortals King, and the Thirty-Six Heavenly Immortals Kings, along with the Immortals’ Realm Youths, the Immortals’ Might Youths, the Immortals’ Prefecture Youths, the Immortals’ Salvation Youths, the Immortals’ Raven Youths, and the Immortals’ Perfected Youths—thirty-six thousand in all—together arrived at the Great Luo Palace to pay their respects to the Heavenly Worthy. They prostrated themselves, touching their heads to the ground in reverence. Overjoyed and exultant, they took their seats in due order, circumambulating the Heavenly Worthy three times before settling. After a long while in attendance, they bowed in devotion, gazing upward to behold the radiant majesty of the Heavenly Worthies and Great Sages. Now gathered in assembly, they received the *Scripture of Flying Immortality* day and night without cease.

At that time, among the assembly was an immortal named Hao Gangwen, who debated with the Supreme Perfected One but could not resolve their dispute. The Immortals King then addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We humbly request Your judgment—who is right and who is wrong in this debate? Each seeks to prevail before the assembly." The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Gangwen is without reason. He shall be stripped of his immortal rank and banished to the moon, where he must fell the osmanthus tree. He shall not keep company with you henceforth."

Then the Immortals King again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Today, in Your presence, we are filled with boundless joy. Such a great assembly of thirty-six thousand—all standing before the Dao. These sages, perfected ones, and immortals are all past worthies and Dharma masters. In the vast emptiness, they cultivated merit and established virtue, fulfilling the causes and conditions for attaining the Dao. Yet now, they have forgotten, and neither recognize the ranks of immortals and sages nor understand the path for future generations of Dao-seeking scholars, good men, and good women. Nor do they comprehend the merits of almsgiving within the Dao sanctuary, the cultivation of longevity, or the causes and conditions for liberating the mud-pill essence. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to explain in sequence, that future generations may know the bridge of goodness, the causes of goodness, and the fields of blessed merit."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, seated in the Seven Treasures Terrace of the Mystic Capital Jade Metropolis, raised a hand and snapped His fingers, exclaiming: "Excellent! Excellent!" The heavens trembled, and He addressed the Immortals King and the assembly: "You have asked well, opening the way to enlightenment for all. This is most essential for future generations. Now, I shall explain to you the causes and conditions of former days. Build great ships and oars, construct great bridges, establish good causes and conditions, and cultivate blessed fields of merit—listen closely with your hearts.

From countless kalpas past, from birth to death, you have now ascended to the rank of Heavenly Kings. Such inconceivable merit and virtue arise from cultivation. Your merits perfected, you gradually ascend to the supreme Dao fruit. With the six penetrations and wisdom, you descend to the lower seats. There are nine ranks of sages, nine ranks of perfected ones, and nine ranks of immortals. Do you understand? All these assembled here are those who, since the Kai Guang era, the Dragon Han and Red Clarity epochs, have endured kalpas of cultivation, accumulating merit and virtue. They have traversed the cycles of birth and death, entered the hells, endured boiling cauldrons and searing coals, climbed mountains of knives and forests of swords, clung to copper pillars and iron beds, swallowed fire and consumed embers. Some took the form of beasts, undergoing countless trials. Now, they have achieved perfection, attaining the realm of longevity—neither born nor dying, abiding in serene stillness.

Immortal Kings, you must all know: the distance between mortals and sages is not far. Mortals who cultivate the Dao ascend to immortality, from immortality to perfection, from perfection to sagehood. From sagehood, through the accumulation of merit, all arise from the mortal realm. It is like building a tower—one must begin from the foundation. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Thus, when merit is complete and the three thousand virtues fulfilled, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight."

Here ends the *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure: The Flying Immortals, Upper Grade*.
