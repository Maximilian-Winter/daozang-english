**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Salvation from Suffering**

At that time, the Salvation-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy pervaded the ten directions, ever employing his majestic and divine power to deliver all sentient beings, liberating them from the paths of delusion. Yet beings remained unaware, like the blind beholding the sun and moon.

I originally abide in the Great Vastness, transcending all bounds without limit.
Auspicious clouds open the Gate of Life; propitious mists seal the Portal of Death.
First issuing from the Primordial Mystery, I govern the mechanisms of auspicious response,
Saving all from sin, delivering all from calamity.
Vast and boundless, I surpass the wellsprings of immortality; pure and expansive, I am naturally clear.
All this is borne of the power of the Great Dao, by which all demonic essences are subdued.

What shines so radiantly in the void? It is the Immortal of the Mud-Pellet.
Purple clouds cover the Yellow Elder—these are the Lords of the Three Treasures.
Returning with the qi of the upper heavens, I command the souls of the Nine Heavens.
The wondrous spirits of salvation, when they behold the hour of deliverance,
Merge the heavens above without distinction; the celestial qi returns to a single body.
All become beings of spontaneity, naturally possessing distinct forms.
Originally dwelling within the Cavernous Void, where traces of the Cavernous Void are no-traces,
The entire body is pervaded by emptiness.

First, qi is entrusted to establish;
Second, qi is followed to generate;
Third, the myriad dharmas are accomplished;
Fourth, radiance is mastered.

Thirty-six in the heavens above, thirty-six on earth below,
The Great Mystery is boundless—how wondrous is the *Great Cavern Sutra*!
I take refuge in the Supreme Worthy, who dissolves all sins.

**The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions:**
The Jade Treasure August Heavenly Worthy of the East,
The Mysterious True Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings of the South,
The Supreme Wondrous Utmost Heavenly Worthy of the West,
The Mysterious Upper Jade Emperor Heavenly Worthy of the North,
The Heavenly Worthy of Deliverance and Transcendence of the Northeast,
The Heavenly Worthy of Life-Nurturing Deliverance of the Southeast,
The Supreme Numinous Void August Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest,
The Boundless Supreme Florescence Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest,
The Jade Void Luminous August Heavenly Worthy of the Above,
The True August Cavernous Spirit Heavenly Worthy of the Below.

The Dao declares: The Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions are as numerous as grains of sand.
Assuming forms throughout the ten-directional realms, they universally deliver gods and humans.
Entrusting qi to accumulate merit, with one voice they save sinful souls.
Truly, sinful souls are pitiable—I now proclaim this wondrous sutra.
Recite it without ceasing; take refuge without pause.
In the heavens, enjoy great blessings; in hell, the sounds of suffering vanish.
Fiery veils transform into cool shade; sword trees become soaring canopies.
Above, ascend to the Vermilion Mound Palace; below, enter the Gate of Illuminating Radiance.
Transcend the tribulations of the Three Realms, and directly ascend to the Heaven of Primordial Beginning.

Thereupon, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings and innumerable hosts gazed upon the Worthy’s countenance and offered this hymn of praise:

The Heavenly Worthy expounds the sutra’s teachings,
Guiding and receiving the drifting multitudes.
Diligently cultivate and study non-action,
And the true Dao will naturally be realized.
Neither deluded nor distracted,
Without self or name,
Recite aloud the verses on sin and blessing,
And the mind’s defilements will be purified ten thousandfold.

At that time, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings and the assembly of immortals, having recited this hymn, bowed their heads to the Heavenly Worthy and withdrew.

In the autumn of the *jiachen* year of the Xuanhe era, at the Jingde Chan Monastery beneath Chizhou City, there was a novice monk named Mo Daozu. By chance, his mother had recently passed away, and in his unceasing grief, he daily recited the sutras of his tradition to dedicate merit and repay her boundless kindness.

By late autumn, a certain Tian, a *gongcao* official for public instruction from Taiping Prefecture, arrived at the monastery to stay. Daozu observed that the official frequently employed the *Tianshu* method to heal the sick and suffering, and possessed the ability to summon and interrogate the souls of the dead regarding their ascent or descent.

Witnessing these numinous wonders, Daozu submitted a petition detailing his plight and beseeching deliverance. The official accepted the petition, stamped it with his seal, and commanded the divine generals to depart. Immediately, they summoned Daozu’s mother to appear before the altar.

The official asked: “Your brother Daozu recites sutras day and night to dedicate merit on your behalf—why do you remain detained in the netherworld?”

His mother replied: “Though my son Daozu recites sutras to repay and dedicate merit, his sincerity has not yet been fully realized. If he were to perform the *Six Times Six* meritorious deeds, the dark realms would universally receive its blessings, and I would immediately attain transcendence.”

At that time, hundreds of men and women were all enduring suffering.

The official asked again: “What is meant by *Six Times Six*?”

She answered: “The Yellow Register Water and Land Retreat.”

Daozu wept and said: “Since childhood, I have left my compassionate mother to dwell in the monastic cloister. My personal circumstances remain unfulfilled—how could I muster the resources to accomplish such a great meritorious deed?”

His mother replied: “It is not so. Simply recite with wholehearted devotion. The Daoist teachings include *The Supreme Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* and the recitation of the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity’s Salvation from Suffering. The netherworld’s records will be memorialized to the heavens, and merit will swiftly manifest.”

She added: “The netherworld’s time is pressing—I dare not linger.” Then, she bowed in gratitude and departed.

Daozu immediately entreated the official to transmit *The Supreme Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* and the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy. Day and night, he recited them with utmost reverence, accumulating a thousand repetitions of each. He composed a memorial, burned it as an offering, and that very night, his mother appeared to him in a dream, saying:

“You have not failed the kindness of my nurture. Your recitation of the sutra and invocation of the sacred name have sincerely moved the lofty perfected ones. By the imperial decree of the Celestial Emperor, I have already been reborn in heaven. From now on, I shall no longer appear to you. You must exert yourself and never forget the true teachings.”

Having spoken, she ascended upon the clouds and slowly departed.
