**Text:**
The Heavenly Worthy spoke: I am boundless in my boundlessness, ultimate in my ultimacy. I possess the Seven Daoist Methods: Concealed Radiance, Abiding Radiance, Concealed Form, Luminous Concealment, Concealed Transformation, Concealed Truth, and Great Virtue. Through successive transformations in the world, I observe and examine all beings, refining their good and evil.

Whether man or woman, those who revere my Dao, advance with diligence, and hold faith and reverence—sitting or walking, they contemplate the Dao, perpetually uphold fasting and precepts, don pure garments, and reside in cleanliness. Day and night, they burn incense, perform timely prostrations, make offerings to the ten directions, practice the Dao with chanting, and praise the various sages. On the monthly purification days, they maintain unbroken fasts. If such a person suffers illness, distress, or unrelievable pain, or is imprisoned or confined, or if a woman faces obstructed childbirth, they should recite the names of these Seven Methods and invoke me with incantations. I will then follow their voice, leading my retinue through the void to arrive directly at their home, rescue the afflicted, and retrieve their wandering souls, restoring them to their bodies to achieve healing. If they are in prison or dire straits, their fetters will be released. If a woman struggles in labor, she will give birth with ease. Furthermore, within their dwelling, all filth and malevolence—floating disease spirits, demonic forces, specters, venomous qi, and groundless depletion—will be driven far away. Curses, sorcery, jealousy, and slander will be returned to their originators, and any transgressions or offenses will be borne by those who committed them. I will dispatch jade youths and maidens to guard their household, ensuring perpetual fortune and blessings, extending the lives of the elderly, and increasing the longevity of the young. All virtues will adhere to their bodies, and myriad evils will melt like ice.

Those who wholeheartedly believe and receive this teaching, practicing it naturally, will attain the true Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: I propagate my Dao to inspire faith, urging devotees to diligently embody, uphold, recite, and chant it. For such Daoist followers, I constantly encircle and protect them, pitying their refined practices and reverence for the Dao. I dispel their afflictions, ensuring they never suffer unjust misfortune. In life, they will know no sorrow; in death, no calamity. Their existence will be effortless, perpetually joyful in good causes, naturally accruing blessings, and transcending to ascend as immortals.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: My ministers, the Daoist masters, are your gatekeepers. They receive your offerings, transmit my teachings, and recite the scriptures on your behalf. After completing fasts and transmitting precepts, they convey your devotion before me. I know of their sincerity in invocation. If they do not follow the Dao, I also know. You, my Daoist followers, should honor and make offerings without disdain or slander, lest you generate karmic misdeeds. If you give in life but regret it, your merit will be void in death. I observe all—no sin has two masters. With a sincere heart, give as you intend: much offering yields much reward, little offering yields little. The same applies to creating scriptures and images. Those who establish temples, enshrine my likeness, surround it with banners and flowers, keep lamps perpetually lit, and contribute to its completion—such merit is towering and immeasurable. In time, they will ascend to blessed fortune and attain immortality.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: Before heaven and earth existed, I alone was. Without birth or extinction, I transform naturally. Only with the advent of heaven and earth did rulers and people emerge. I issued scriptures and teachings, serving as the teacher of emperors, and later as the Great Divine Spirit of the Celestial Perfected, nurturing all living beings. In the east, I transformed the Azure Vault; in the south, the Flaming Brightness; in the west, the Great Hall; in the north, the Dark Profusion. Having completed my transformative work, I returned to the imperial realm. Relieving and delivering the ten directions, all come to uphold the Dao. Those who have not witnessed cause and effect yet wholeheartedly delight in the Dao will ascend as immortals.

First is the Boundless Great Dao; second is the Supreme Orthodox True Dao; third is the Effortless Great Peace, Pure, and Austere Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: This scroll of scripture, recited thrice daily while invoking my Three Treasures, will manifest protection for the devotee, dispelling all fear. Even if they have committed offenses, these too will be eradicated. You, my Daoist followers, when reciting this scripture, must not do so with impure breath or careless defilement, lest you incur future karmic stains. If you wish to recite it, first rinse your mouth to purity and maintain a focused, upright mind. Those who seek sons will have sons; those who seek daughters will have daughters; those who seek longevity will attain utmost peace, abundant clothing, and ample food.

This scroll of scripture possesses great numinous virtue, delivering beings from life and death. Whether man or woman, those who copy, receive, and uphold it, placing it in purity, will find their homes secure, their sons and daughters flourishing, and the multitude of sages aiding and protecting them. The world will hold them in reverence. They will abide in effortless prosperity, their blessings and power ensuring it. As their virtuous deeds expand, they will ascend to heaven for seven generations. All beings in the Dharma realm who uphold this merit will believe, receive, and practice it.
