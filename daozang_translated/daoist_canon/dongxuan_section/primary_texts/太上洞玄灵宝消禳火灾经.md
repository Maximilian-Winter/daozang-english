At that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy ascended the Golden Immortal Altar in the Garden of Lofty Virtue, where an assembly of immortals gathered for a ritual feast. As he expounded the Supreme Profound and Boundless Dao of the Great Origin, he suddenly beheld the world below engulfed in raging flames, house after house reduced to smoldering ash.

When the feast concluded, the myriad spirits stood in solemn guard, the attending immortals hastened to their ranks, the Wind Earl swept away the dust, and the Two Masters purified the path. Following the Heavenly Worthy, they traversed to the Realm of Radiant Crimson Heaven.

The Crimson Spirit Lord, along with the divine officials and attendants of the Fire Department, arrayed themselves in majestic formation. They presented a hundred varieties of rare incense, cinnabar herbs and purple mushrooms, vermilion banners and crimson staffs, standing in reverent order to welcome and bow before the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy inquired: "You govern the threefold *qi* and hold office in the Crimson Heaven. Good and evil rest in your hands—how do you mete out reward and punishment?"

The Crimson Spirit Lord prostrated himself and replied: "By the Mandate of Heaven, I oversee the Fire Office, nurturing all living beings and fostering the growth of the myriad things. When drought and conflagration arise, disasters befall as ordained by the movements of *qi*. There is no concealment, no deviation. Yet we distinguish between good and evil, assigning weight accordingly, to admonish the foolish and ensure swift retribution.

Those who disrespect Heaven, Earth, and the Three Luminaries; those who are unfilial or disloyal; those who cheat with weights and measures; those who harbor malice, deceit, or greed; those who oppress the common folk without restraint; those who amass wealth through violence and extortion—all who commit wrongs and deny karmic consequences—are observed by the supervising spirits who roam the mortal realm. Their deeds are recorded and verified, then reported for celestial punishment. The Fire Department is dispatched to bring about their reform.

Those who awaken to fear and turn toward goodness, planting seeds of virtue, are protected by my divine subordinates, who are commanded not to harm them.

Today, I am most fortunate to behold the Heavenly Countenance. I pray that for this realm, the true teaching may be proclaimed."

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Your majestic power blazes forth, your decrees are strict and clear. The crimson *qi* and red radiance illuminate the Three Realms. From the Golden Immortal Altar in the Garden of Lofty Virtue, I witnessed these karmic transgressions and thus came to this realm. Now, I shall proclaim a divine incantation for you to transmit. If one can repent, reform, and sincerely uphold this sutra, then on the day of disaster, should they recite this incantation, you shall absolve their transgressions and ensure their safety.

When, within a given region, the *yang* cycle reaches its ninth phase and Mars traverses the heavens, those who recite this incantation shall also be protected by you. I shall promptly grant pardon, and the disaster will naturally cease.

If fire spirits or fire demons recklessly invade a household, stirring calamity, those who recite this incantation shall be shielded by you. You must restrain such entities and prevent them from harming the innocent."

Then he spoke the incantation:

> In the Crimson Heaven of the South, the Crimson Spirit holds sway.
> Fierce radiance and blazing flames transform all without partiality.
> When the Fire Dragon takes flight, its brilliance knows no bounds.
> When the Fire Steed leaps forth, it wheels across ten thousand leagues.
> When the Fire Hawk darts swift, its wings outpace all before.
> When the Fire Bell resounds, its mighty tone echoes afar.
> When the Fire Ladle is cast, smoke arises wherever it lands.
> When the Fire Sword descends, all demons submit in reverence.
> When the Fire Rope is raised, a hundred evils entangle themselves.
> When the Fire Banner stirs, commands are obeyed with solemnity.
> When the Fire Staff points afar, who dares usurp its authority?
> Great virtue extends to all things, nurturing and preserving life.
> Those who defy the mandate and invert the proper order bring scorching disaster upon the heavens.
> Yet those who act with goodness are never overlooked; transgressions are erased, and faults removed.

The Crimson Spirit Lord prostrated himself in gratitude and composed a gatha:

> Once I received the Heavenly Worthy’s decree,
> To observe the laws and guard the fiery realm.
> Now I receive the Heavenly Worthy’s command,
> To heed goodness and descend with blessings.
>
> Where the Heavenly Worthy’s incantation resides,
> The Fire Department brings no calamity.
> Where the Heavenly Worthy’s incantation resides,
> The fire’s power is quelled, its radiance stilled.
> Where the Heavenly Worthy’s incantation resides,
> Fire demons hide themselves away.
> Where the Heavenly Worthy’s incantation resides,
> All demons perish of their own accord.
> Where the Heavenly Worthy’s incantation resides,
> Disasters and misfortunes are dispelled.
> Where the Heavenly Worthy’s incantation resides,
> Wealth and possessions flourish and thrive.
> Where the Heavenly Worthy’s incantation resides,
> The household abides in peace and well-being.

Having spoken this gatha, only the ethereal imperial carriage remained, returning to the Jade Capital. The Crimson Spirit Lord and his divine retinue gazed upward at the celestial radiance, prostrating themselves in farewell.
