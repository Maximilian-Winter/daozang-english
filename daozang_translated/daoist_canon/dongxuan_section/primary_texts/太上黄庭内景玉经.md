### **First Chapter: Highest Clarity**
Before the Purple Radiance of the Highest Clarity, the Supreme Dao’s Jade Dawn Lord,
Leisurely composes seven-word verses with elixir pearls,
Dispersing and transforming the five forms into ten thousand spirits—
Thus is the *Yellow Court* made into the Inner Chapters.
The zither-heart’s triple refrains dance the weary embryo,
Nine qi shine brightly, emerging from the celestial inquiry.
The divine canopy’s youth generates purple mist—
This is called the jade script, fit for refined study.
Chant it ten thousand times to ascend the Three Heavens,
A thousand disasters dissolve, a hundred illnesses heal.
Fear not the ferocity of tigers and wolves,
And thus reverse aging to extend the years forever.

### **Second Chapter: Above**
Above resides the hun-soul, below the Pass of Origin,
Left is Lesser Yang, right Greater Yin,
Behind lies the Secret Gate, before the Gate of Life—
Exhaling the sun, inhaling the moon.
The Primordial Black unites with the constellations,
Purple mist ascends and descends through the Three Pristine.
Irrigate the five flowers, plant the numinous root,
The seven liquids flow through the central chamber,
Revolving purple, embracing yellow, entering the cinnabar field.
The secluded chamber’s inner radiance illuminates the Yang Gate.

---

### **Third Chapter: The Mouth**
The mouth is the Jade Pool, the Palace of Supreme Harmony,
Rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid, calamities do not dry.
The body generates radiant light, the qi like fragrant orchids,
Dispelling a hundred evils, refining the jade countenance.
Those who diligently cultivate it ascend to Broad Cold,
Day and night without sleep, thus attaining perfection.
Thunder roars, lightning flashes, the spirits stir.

### **Fourth Chapter: The Yellow Court**
The Yellow Court’s inner person wears brocade robes,
Purple blossoms fly like skirts, cloud-gauze trailing.
Cinnabar and green, verdant branches, jade-like stalks,
Seven-tiered jade locks seal the double doors,
Heavily veiled by the Golden Gate, the secret mechanism.
The dark spring’s secluded gate towers high,
Within the Three Fields, essence and qi are subtle.
The delicate maiden, graceful, veiled in celestial radiance,
The layered halls gleam, displaying eight mights.
Heaven’s Court and Earth’s Pass array axes,
The Numinous Terrace stands firm, never decaying.

---

### **Fifth Chapter: The Central Pool**
The Central Pool’s inner spirit wears crimson pearls,
Cinnabar brocade cloud-robes girded with tigers.
The three-inch crossing is where the numinous dwells,
Hidden mushrooms flourish, self-supporting.
The numinous radiance obscures, luxuriant and mutual.

### **Sixth Chapter: Heaven’s Center**
Heaven’s Central Peak refines essence with care,
The numinous abode cleansed, the Jade Emperor resides.
The roads of communication remain unceasingly open.
The brows are named Floral Canopy, covering the bright,
The Nine Darks, sun and moon, penetrate the Primordial Void.
Within the abode dwells the Perfected, ever-clothed—
Those who discern this know no illness or fatigue.
Crimson pearls, numinous skirts, floral emotions,
Beneath the tongue, the Dark Gullet spans life and death.
Emerging from azure, entering the mysterious, the two blacks—
If you encounter this, you ascend to the Celestial Han.

Below sits a youth in the Jade Gate,
The Seven Origins’ child governs qi regulation,
Externally corresponding to the Central Peak, the nose’s position.

Use it unceasingly, the form does not stagnate.

Governing cold and heat, harmonizing construction and defense.
Cinnabar brocade flying skirts draped in jade gauze,
Golden bells, vermilion sashes, seated in dance.

Below resides the Azure Youth, the Divine Duke,
Governing all barriers, the beginning of clarity and brightness.
Azure brocade draped, jade pendants worn,
Harmonizing the hun and po, balancing fluids.
Externally corresponding to the eyes, sun and moon.
The hundred illnesses converge—preserve the Flourishing,
Together use it for seven days to naturally fill.
At the verge of death, invoke the spirit to revive,
Gathering the hun, returning the po, forever without...

### **Twelfth Chapter: The Kidney Section**
The Kidney Section’s palace is the Mysterious Pass, round and deep,
Within resides the Youth of Obscure Primordiality, sovereign of the Dark Mystery,
Governing the six viscera, source of the nine fluids.
Externally corresponding to the two ears, the hundred-fluid springs,
Azure brocade cloud-robes swirling with dragon banners.
Above, it summons luminous mist, sun and moon’s haze,
The hundred illnesses and thousand calamities—hasten to preserve it.
The two Water Lords face the Gate of Life,
Enabling one to attain long life and ascend the Nine Heavens.

### **Thirteenth Chapter: The Spleen Section**
The Spleen Section’s palace belongs to wu and ji,
Within dwells the Luminous Youth, wrapped in yellow robes,
Dissolving grains, dispersing qi, governing teeth,
This is the Great Granary, the two Bright Youths,
Seated in the nine-tiered Golden Terrace Citadel,
Square and round, a cun within the Gate of Life.
It harmonizes the hundred grains, the five fragrant flavors,
Repelling emaciation and illness, averting harm.
Externally corresponding to the dwelling of the cubit, radiant complexion,
Its brilliance arises to manifest.
Yellow brocade, jade robes, tiger-patterned sash,
Focus the mind on the Three Elders, and you will lightly soar,
Attaining long life, rising high, far from death’s misfortune.

### **Fourteenth Chapter: The Gallbladder Section**
The Gallbladder Section’s palace is the essence of the six viscera,
Within resides the Youth, radiant with majestic brightness,
Thunder and lightning resound eightfold, brandishing jade banners,
Dragon standards cross the sky, casting fire bells.
Governing all strength and qi, commanding tiger soldiers,
Externally corresponding to the pupils of the eyes, the bridge of the nose,
Brain and hair mutually supporting, both resplendent.
Nine-colored brocade robes, green floral skirts,
Adorned with gold belts, jade, dragon-and-tiger patterns.
If you can preserve its majestic brightness, you will ride the auspicious clouds,
Commanding the myriad spirits to pay homage at the Three Origins.

### **Fifteenth Chapter: The Spleen’s Length**
The Spleen stretches a foot, covering the Great Granary,
Within its central region, the Venerable Lord governs brightness,
Its name is Lingyuan, called Hunkang,
Curing the hundred illnesses, digesting grains.
Yellow robes, purple sashes, dragon-and-tiger emblems,
Prolonging essence, enhancing life—reliant on this Lord.
Call my name thrice, and the spirit will naturally commune,
The Three Elders sit together, each with their own methods,
Whether essence or embryo, they hold distinct prescriptions,
Peach kernels unite to extend life’s blossoms.
Male and female traverse the ninefold path to Peach Prosperity,
Dao-Father and Dao-Mother face each other,
Master-Father and Master-Mother dwell in the Cinnabar Mystery,
You may employ visualization to ascend the void,
Divergent paths converge in one essential end.
Seal the Three Passes, grasp firmness,
Rinse with golden nectar, swallow jade blossoms,
Thus attaining non-hunger, the Three Worms perish,
Heart and intent ever harmonious, bringing joyous prosperity.
The clouds and qi of the Five Peaks billow,
Preserve and bathe in a single jade hut to recompense yourself,
The five forms complete and sturdy, free from calamity.

### **Sixteenth Chapter: Gazing Above**
Gazing above, the Three Origins like linked pearls,
Luminous and resplendent, illuminating the nine corners,
The Five Spirits nightly kindle, illuminating the eight regions.
If you preserve the Inner Sovereign and wander with me,
Clad in phoenix robes, bearing tiger talismans,
You will swiftly ascend to the formless void.
Within the square inch, profound thoughts are concealed,
Neither square nor round, sealing windows and doors,
The Three Spirits return essence, and the old become robust,
Hun and po guard within, not contending with the Supreme.
The Yellow Court’s inner vision—life and death’s contest ceases.
Spirits born within the abdomen, bearing jade bells,
Divine influx fills the obscure gates—how could it be lost?
Jade branches stretch ten thousand spans, offering shelter,
The Three Hun naturally tranquil, the Emperor’s decree commands.

### **Seventeenth Chapter: The Spirit Terrace**
The Spirit Terrace, lush and misty, overlooks the Yellow Wilds,
Three inches, distinct chambers above and below,
The Pass of Inquiry governs the camp and guard, receiving the Lofty Mystery,
The Cavern Chamber, Purple Ultimate, Spirit Gate.
Thus did the Supreme once instruct me:
On the left, the Divine Duke speaks the spirit’s words,
On the right, White Prime stands in attendance,
The Hall of Light, Golden Cabinet, Jade Chamber—inquire within,
The Perfected of Supreme Clarity stand before me.
The Yellow-Robed Youth’s cinnabar qi frequently stirs,
I ask: where do the two brows reside?
Within, they flank the sun and moon, arraying the constellations,
The Seven Luminaries, Nine Origins crown the Gate of Life.

### **Eighteenth Chapter: The Three Passes**
Within the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep,
In the Nine Subtleties, obscure and dark.
The mouth is Heaven’s Pass, the spirit’s mechanism,
The feet are Earth’s Pass, the gate of life,
The hands are Human’s Pass, grasping prosperity and decline.

### **Nineteenth Chapter: If Attained**
If you attain the Three Officials and preserve the Mysterious Elixir,
The Great One’s flowing pearl rests in Kunlun,
Layered towers and pavilions, twelvefold rings,
Naturally high and low, all are real.
Jade Hall, crimson chambers, all are Mysterious Palaces,
The Jade Armillary, Jade Balance, orchid-hued,
Gazing upon the Youths seated in leisure,
I ask: whose children are these within me?
Where have they gone? Entering the Muddy Pellet,
Thousands upon thousands, hundreds upon hundreds, each distinct,
Ten upon ten, like layered mountains.
Cloud standards, jade blossoms flank the ears,
The Red Emperor, Yellow Elder, and my hun,
The Three Perfected support the bones, sharing the chamber,
The Five Dippers radiant, the Seven Origins,
Sun and moon flying through the Six Harmonies,
The Emperor’s homeland, the center of heaven, the earth’s gate,
The facial spirits and hun all preserved.

### **Twentieth Chapter: Breathing**
Inhaling and exhaling primordial qi to seek transmission,
The Transmitted Duke’s son seems present,
Crimson birds contract, white stone’s source,
Congealing essence, nurturing the embryo, transforming life,
Retaining the embryo, halting essence—this is long life.
The Three Qi revolve to the right, the Nine Paths,
The Orthodox One contains blossoms, thus filling.
Gazing afar, the heart like a net,
Beneath the golden chamber, can it not be overturned?
Extending my white-haired years, returning to infancy.

### **Twenty-First Chapter: The Jade Chamber**
Within the Jade Chamber, the Eight Simplicities gather,
The Muddy Pellet Lady stands at the center,
The Long Valley, Mysterious Homeland encircles the outskirts,
Six dragons scatter and fly, difficult to distinguish.
Long life demands utmost caution in the chamber’s urgency,
Why court death, inviting the calamity of the spirits’ neglect?
Only inhale qi, absorb the essence of the child,
The inch-field, foot-dwelling can govern life.
If you indulge in regret, a hundred stains,
Leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdancy,
Qi lost, fluids leak—this is no longer your form.
Focus on sealing, mastering the vision, thus attaining long tranquility,
Preserve my Muddy Pellet’s Three Wonders,
Serene and idle, gazing inward, naturally clear,
Things do not disturb, at peace,
Abundant indeed—no affairs, the old become youthful again,
Recite the Jade Scripture, enter Supreme Clarity.

### **Twenty-Second Chapter: Constant Remembrance**
Constantly remember the Three Chambers, interconnected,
Through penetrating vision, see without inside or outside,
Preserve and rinse the Five Sprouts, free from hunger and thirst,
Divine blossoms hold the towel, the Six Dings exhaust themselves.
Swiftly guard the Essence Chamber, do not recklessly leak,
Seal and treasure it—this is longevity.
Arising from within the form, initially not distant,
The Three Officials are near, easily concealed.
Void and stillness, emptiness’s simplicity,
Make the form thus—it should not be.
The Nine Chambers, perfectly empty, house the spirit’s brightness,
Preserve thoughts, regulate the hundred contemplations,
Cultivate the six viscera, let them not decay,
Then you will soar and enter the clouds.

### **Twenty-Third Chapter: Cultivating Life**
The Dao of cultivating life is not cumbersome,
Simply refine the *Dongxuan* and *Jade Canon*,
And practice the Eight Radiant Spirits within the form,
The Twenty-Four Perfected emerge naturally.
Sit in lofty repose, non-action—soul and spirit at peace,
In clarity and stillness, the spirit appears and speaks with me,
Abiding in the Purple Chamber amid curtains,
Standing or sitting outside the room, the Three and Five Mysteries.

Burn incense, join hands before the Jade Flower,
Together enter the Great Chamber through the Gate of the Turning Sphere,
Profoundly study the garden of the Dao in tranquility,
Inward vision, subtle gaze—all truths are seen.
The Perfected reside within; do not seek neighbors,
Why search afar for causes and conditions?

### **Twenty-Fourth Chapter: Concealing Radiance**
Conceal radiance, hide the form, set apart from the world,
Contain qi, nourish essence—lips like cinnabar,
Grasp life’s nature, guard emptiness,
Your name enters the Upper Clarity, death’s register erased,
The joy of the Three Spirits arises from reclusion.

Swiftly roam and wander without lingering cares,
Adorned in garments, the Eight Winds drive,
Harness the Three Primes, ride the morning clouds,
Golden ranks align, following the Jade Chariot,
Why not ascend the mountain and recite my scripture?
Lush and secluded, the Perfected’s abode,
Entering the mountain—what difficulty? Yet you hesitate,
While the world’s clamor reeks like a refuse heap.

### **Twenty-Fifth Chapter: The Five Phases**
The Five Phases revolve, returning to the One,
Three and Five merge qi, the nine-nines’ nodes,
Use them to conceal the earth, reverse the Eight Guards,
The Hidden Ox, Dark Gate—arrayed in ranks.

The Three Clarities emerge from the boundary of life and death,
The Grotto Chamber’s numinous image—sun and moon lose their chambers,
The Father is the Mud-Pill Palace, the Mother the Feminine One,
The Three Luminaries shine brilliantly into the child.

Abide in the Mysterious True—all affairs are complete,
The spirit of the body must not be lost.

### **Twenty-Sixth Chapter: Soaring Aloft**
Soaring above the sun and moon, I ascend the Dao,
Yu Yi and Jie Lin unite in harmonious protection,
Then you may see the Jade Clarity’s Vacuous Ancient,
And reverse aging, replenish the brain’s blood.

Mouth holding divine fungus, embracing the Five Stars,
Waist girded with Tiger Tallies, wearing the Golden Clasp,
Harness the clouds, receive life, feast in the Eastern Mists.

### **Twenty-Seventh Chapter: The Mysterious Origin**
The Mysterious Origin’s Upper One refines soul and spirit,
The One as a thing is elusive, hard to suddenly perceive,
Only by attaining the Utmost True can skill be attained,
Most taboo are dead qi and all foul impurities,
The Six Spirits gather and feast in emptiness.

Bind the pearl, secure essence, nourish the spirit’s root,
Jade laughter, golden key—ever whole and firm,
Close the mouth, curl the tongue, consume the fetal fluid,
Thus I refine and attain flight and transcendence.

### **Twenty-Eighth Chapter: Transmitting to Others**
Weary of others, the Daoist is not divine,
Accumulating essence, amassing qi—this is the True.

The Yellow Lad’s wondrous voice is rarely heard,
Jade script, crimson tablets, vermilion characters.
Inscribed: "Perfected One, turban of gold,
Bearing armor, holding talismans, open the Seven Gates,
Fire soldiers, talismanic charts—prepare the Numinous Pass,
Front lofty, rear low, high and low arrayed.
Wield a hundred-foot sword, dance the brocade banner,
Ten Absolute Trays swirl in the void,
Fire bells crown the clouds, trailing smoke,
Abiding between the Yellow Gates of the brows,
This is no branch or leaf—it is the root itself."

### **Twenty-Ninth Chapter: Purple Clarity**
The Purple Clarity’s August Sovereign of the Great Dao,
Great Mystery, Great Harmony—flanking attendants,
Transforming and generating the ten thousand things, causing me to transmit,
Ascending through the Ten Heavens, riding jade.

Day and night, seven days—think without sleep,
If you can cultivate this, you may attain longevity.
Accumulating merit, completing refinement—it is not natural,
It arises from sincerity and also from guarding,
Inwardly guarding firmly—the True of the True,
In emptiness and tranquility, the spirit comes of itself.

### **Thirtieth Chapter: The Hundred Grains**
The hundred grains’ essence is the earth’s quintessence,
The five flavors’ external beauty reeks of demonic filth,
Confusing the spirit’s brightness, scattering the fetal qi,
How then can one reverse aging and return to infancy?
The Three Hun suddenly scatter, the Po crumble!

Why not consume the qi of Great Harmony’s essence?
Thus you may not die and enter the Yellow Tranquility.

### **Thirty-First Chapter: The Heart Canon**
The Heart Canon—one body, the Five Viscera’s sovereign,
In movement and stillness, contemplate the Dao and virtue,
Purity and good qi naturally radiate light,
Sitting and rising, I am with you in the hall,
Day’s sun shines, dusk conceals—
Penetrate the Flowery Essence, harmonize the Yin.

### **Thirty-Second Chapter: Passing Through**
Passing through the Six Directions, conceal at Mao and You,
The spirits of the two kidneys govern longevity,
Revolve and descend, align with the Dipper, hide the First Nine,
Know the masculine, guard the feminine—you may be ageless,
Know the white, guard the black—see the seated guardian.

### **Thirty-Third Chapter: Liver Qi**
Liver qi surges, clear and long,
Arraying the Six Viscera, generating the Three Luminaries.
Heart’s essence, intent focused—internally unwavering,
Above it joins the Three Burners, below the Jade Nectar.
Mysterious fluid flows like clouds, dispelling foul fragrance,
Governing and cleansing, teeth and hair refine the Five Directions.
Draw the fluid from the Mysterious Gullet into the Bright Hall,
Below irrigate the throat—spirit’s brightness penetrates.
Sit beneath the Flowery Canopy, wander the Noble Capital,
Drifting through the Three Clarities, resting on the clear frost,
Five-colored cloud qi swirls in verdant profusion,
Close the eyes, inwardly gaze—naturally behold,
Cause the various heart spirits to return and honor themselves,
The Sevenfold Mystic Flower opens the Gate of Life,
Unblock the Heavenly Dao, preserve the Mysterious Root.
Even at one hundred twenty years, return is still possible,
Beyond this, guarding the Dao is truly difficult,
Only await the Nine Turnings’ Eight Jade Elixir,
Must again refine thoughts, preserve the Seven Origins,
The sun and moon’s radiance rescues the old and decrepit,
Liver qi circulates endlessly without cease.

### **Thirty-Fourth Chapter: The Lungs**
The lungs’ qi arises from the Three Burners,
Vision and hearing in darkness await the youthful,
Regulate the Five Flowers, refine teeth and hair,
Thirty-six swallows of the Jade Pool,
Opening and dredging the hundred vessels—blood and fluid begin.

Complexion radiates the light of gold and jade,
Teeth firm, hair black—unaware of whiteness,
Preserve this true spirit, do not let it fall,
Recall the Purple Palace has a seat,
The host of spirits gather, turning and seeking one another.

### **Thirty-Fifth Chapter: Concealing and Hiding**
Conceal and hide the feathered canopy, observe the Heavenly Abode,
Pay homage to the sun, joyfully call to one another,
The Eight Mighties of the Bright Spirit rightly repel evil,
The spleen spirit returns to its home in the stomach.

Indulge and nourish the numinous root, never wither,
Seal the Gate of Life, protect the Jade Capital,
The ten thousand spirits then flourish—lifespan overflows,
This is called the spleen established in the Central Palace.

The Five Viscera and Six Bowels—spirits’ sovereign,
Above it joins the Heavenly Gate, enters the Bright Hall,
Guard the feminine, preserve the masculine, crown the Three Luminaries,
Externally square, internally round—the spirit abides within.
Unblock blood and vessels, the Five Viscera flourish,
Bones green, sinews red, marrow like frost,
The spleen rescues the seven orifices, dispelling misfortune,
Sun and moon arrayed, setting forth Yin and Yang.

The two spirits meet and transform into jade blossoms,
Tasteless yet the celestial beings’ sustenance.
Zidan presents hunger’s fare—pure yellow frost,
Called langgao and jade essence.

The Supreme conceals the Eightfold Jade Ring,
Irrigating the eight fluids, the kidneys receive essence.
Hidden in Great Yin, my form appears,
The Three Mysteries’ wind stirs, emerging in Primordial Azure.

In the fleeting and indistinct, utmost purity and numinosity,
Playing upon the Terrace of Recitation, beholding Red Life.
In the carefree realm, nurturing the true and flourishing glory,
Inwardly gazing in silence, refining the Five Forms.

The Three Qi linger, attaining spirit clarity,
Concealed dragons, hidden zhi, cloud-borne langying.
This can sate hunger and command the ten thousand spirits,
Above, the Profound Profundity; below, the Tiger’s Seal.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: Ablutions**

For ablutions, be thoroughly pure, forsake rich perfumes,
Enter the chamber facing east, recite the Jade Chapters.
Once ten thousand repetitions are complete, meaning shines forth,
Let hair loose, desireless, to abide long.

The Five Flavors all arrive, the upright qi returns,
Calm the heart, still the vexation—do not harbor resentment.
When the count is fulfilled, body and spirit refined,
The Yellow Flower Jade Maiden reveals to you the truth.

The Perfected One having arrived, the Six Dings are dispatched,
Then bestowed the *Hidden Zhi* and *Great Cavern Scripture*.
Ten recitations, four bows, pay homage to the Supreme,
First to the Great Emperor, then turn northward—
The *Yellow Court Inner Scripture* and Jade Writ flow unimpeded.

The granter is called Master, the receiver takes the oath,
With cloud-brocade and phoenix silk, golden knots entwined,
In place of cutting hair, flesh and skin remain whole.
Hand in hand, ascend the mountain to face the liquid cinnabar,
Only then may the Golden Writ and Jade Effulgence be proclaimed.

Having received the transmission, report to the Three Officials,
Lest the seven ancestors suffer the misfortune of dark writs.
The Supreme’s subtle words induce spirit weariness—
This is the scripture of the deathless Dao.

Here ends the *Supreme Yellow Court Inner Effulgences Jade Scripture*.
