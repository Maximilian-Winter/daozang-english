At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning was in the Nine-Colored Jade Hall of the Highest Clarity Heaven atop the Dark Radiance, ascending the Seven-Treasured Throne. He emitted a great luminosity, universally gathering the myriad spirits, and together with the teachings of Heaven, transformed all beings.

The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, Dao Lords, Lord Lao, Imperial Lords, Perfected Lords, Venerable Ones, and Sagely Ones—along with countless immortals—all came to attend the throne and listen to the wondrous Dharma.

Thereupon, Brahmā praised it as good, Śakra rejoiced in song, and celestial music resounded of itself, arriving with the light.

At this moment, Lord Lao of the Most High rose from his jade seat, stepping upon a lotus flower. Perfected Ones attended him on either side, jade maidens supported his trailing robes, and he came before the Heavenly Worthy, proclaiming: "Your disciples, enlightened by the Master’s teachings, have received the blessings of the celestial halls. Your boundless merit is beyond measure. Yet I observe that within the Three Realms and the Sea of Suffering, countless beings are unjustly afflicted by calamities, entangled in the net of sins, and among the various kinds of beings, none can escape the cycles of birth and transformation. I cannot remain in the Great Clarity; I wish to rely on your majestic radiance, divide my body across the Three Realms, and save all beings. I humbly beseech the Most Venerable to regard my compassionate intent with favor."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning slightly manifested his Dharma-body and addressed Lord Lao: "Excellent, excellent! You rise from your jade seat, startling the myriad heavens, to save from suffering and deliver the living—this need not be spoken by you. Return to your seat, and I shall proclaim it for you."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "All things are born of me, all spirits are transformed by me. Those who suffer calamities must be saved. You need not rely on your own power to manifest a body and deliver them. In the Eastern Realm of Everlasting Joy, there is a being of great compassion and kindness, the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Saves from Suffering. His manifested forms are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Responding to the cries of beings, he dwells in celestial palaces, descends among humans, resides in hells, subdues demonic hordes, or appears as immortal youths and jade maidens, as Imperial Lords and Sagely Ones, as Heavenly Worthies and Perfected Ones, as Vajra Deva Kings, as demon kings and mighty warriors, as Heavenly Masters and Daoist priests, as emperors and elders, as celestial physicians and merit officials, as men and women, as civil and military officials, as great marshals, as teaching masters and Chan masters, or as wind and rain masters. His divine transformations are boundless, his meritorious deeds inexhaustible. He saves from suffering upon hearing a cry and responds to beings according to their needs. Now I inform you of this."

Lord Lao again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "This sagely being possesses infinite transformations. How may he come before my Master?"

The Heavenly Worthy told Lord Lao: "You may raise your voice and chant the name of the Great One. Let the immortal officials join in the recitation, and he will naturally respond and manifest his body."

Thereupon, Lord Lao, the assembled immortals, and all others followed the teaching. Together, they chanted the name of the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Saves from Suffering.

Suddenly, from among the ranks of the Imperial Lords, a youth appeared, stepping upon lotus flowers. He bowed his head before the Heavenly Worthy and proclaimed: "Your disciple is the Great One. By my Master’s grace, I have come to expound the Dharma. I gather my forms and listen to the wondrous sounds. In Heaven, joy arises in an instant; in the underworld, movement spans ten thousand kalpas. Within the Three Realms, all beings suffer, crying out in anguish: *How bitter! How bitter!*"

He circled the Heavenly Worthy, bowing and prostrating, and begged to descend through the celestial gates.

At this, the assembled immortals, seeing the youth’s plea, wept tears that stained their robes, sighing: "In Heaven, there is joy; below, there is disaster. The retributions of samsara—when will there be peace?"

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Great One: "Your vows are compassionate, and beings suffer. In accordance with your vows, divide your body to save them."

The youth rejoiced, bowed again, and withdrew.

The assembled immortals beheld the youth transform into a Heavenly Worthy, his feet upon a lotus, a halo of radiance shining forth. In his hand, he held a willow branch and pure water. Nine-headed lions attended him on either side as he rode through the void.

Then they saw the Heavenly Worthy transform into an Imperial Lord, his feet upon a lotus, a ruyi scepter in hand, a halo of radiance shining forth. Nine-headed lions attended him on either side as he rode through the void.

Next, they saw the Imperial Lord transform into a Perfected One, his feet upon a lotus, emitting divine light that connected the Nine Heavens above and the Nine Earths below. Nine-headed lions attended him on either side as he rode through the void.

Then they saw the Perfected One transform into a woman, clad in fiery brocade robes, her hair unbound and feet bare, stepping upon a lotus. In her hand, she wielded a golden sword, a halo of radiance shining forth. Nine-headed lions, spouting flames, circled her form as she rode through the void.

Lord Lao addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "This sagely being’s power and virtue, transforming to save the living—from what kalpa did they arise, and through what aeons of cultivation? I humbly beseech you to respond according to the needs of beings and proclaim it for all."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "This sagely being is called in Heaven the Fortune Spirit of the Great One, in the world the Great Compassionate One, in hell the Radiant Imperial Lord of the Sun, among heterodox paths the Lion Bright King who subdues demons, and in the watery palaces the Imperial Lord of the Abyssal Depths. You are my qi, and I am your root. You know me, and I know you—this is the essence of the Nine Yangs. Most numinous, most numinous! You may keep this secret; it cannot be fully described."

At that time, Lord Lao, hearing the words of the Heavenly Worthy, closed his eyes and composed his spirit. He snapped his fingers, knocked his head, and recited the incantation:

*"The primordial qi of the primordial ancestor,
Wondrously transforms the essence of the Nine Yangs.
Power and virtue spread through the ten directions,
Vaguely, vaguely, revealing its truth.
The Three Nines send forth the wind,
Wandering from the Blue of the Beginning.
Reverently, the nectar of jade is born,
Offering it to avoid hunger and thirst.
The myriad spirits should believe and worship,
The Eight Sufferings cannot follow."*

By accumulating virtuous deeds and upholding precepts, one may ascend to the Jade Capital.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy further addressed Lord Lao and all the immortals, saying: "If there are beings afflicted by pestilence and lingering illness, they may burn incense, recite the sacred name, and reverently transmit this sutra—thus shall their ailments dissipate, and peace be attained. If there are beings seeking office or position, beset by treacherous slander, let them recite the sacred name and transmit this sutra, and naturally envy shall cease, and rank and emolument be elevated. If there are beings traversing rivers and seas, threatened by waves, fish, or dragons, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, and they shall reach the shore unharmed. If there are beings struck by thunder, lightning, or terrifying storms, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, and their spirit shall be clear, their soul undisturbed. If there are beings whose parents, teachers, or kin are discordant, whose siblings are estranged, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, transmit this sutra, and naturally their kin shall harmonize—fathers kind, children filial, elder brothers friendly, younger brothers respectful. If there are kings or lords whose courts harbor rebellious ministers, whose lands are ravaged by war and famine, whose winds and rains are untimely, whose people suffer, let them uphold fasting and recitation, transmit this sutra, and winds and rains shall align with the seasons, traitors be exposed, and the realm know peace. If there are beings harmed by malevolent spirits or bandits, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, and demons shall retreat, bandits perish. If there are beings traveling through mountains or forests, threatened by beasts, snakes, or birds, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, and creatures shall withdraw, daring not to harm. If there are women with child facing difficult labor, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, and true qi shall protect them, free from pain or injury, bearing wise sons or comely daughters, whole in body and spirit, mother and child reunited. If there are men or women, lay or ordained, who aspire to the Dao and seek immortality, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, transmit this sutra, and their merit shall be perfected, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. If there are beings bound in shackles or imprisoned, groaning in despair, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, and they shall be freed, escaping confinement. If there are beings whose seven generations of ancestors, nine lineages of forebears, disciples, classmates, spouses, or departed kin linger in the cold courts of the underworld, unable to be reborn, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, and naturally they shall depart the shadowy realms, ascending to heaven. If there are beings entangled by vengeful ties, let them visualize and recite the sacred name, and their grievances shall dissolve, their bonds severed."

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed Lord Lao, saying: "This sacred name is most exalted, most noble, most holy, most numinous. On the three ninth days of each month, it descends most frequently among mortals. Always in a purified chamber, burn incense, bow in worship, prepare willow branches and pure water, seasonal flowers, and medicinal herbs as offerings—thus shall one naturally live to one hundred and twenty, the Five Fortunes ever present, the Eight Difficulties far removed. Beware of ashes from the hearth, pomegranate refuse, or any unclean matter—these are impure and must not be touched."

When the Heavenly Worthy finished expounding the sutra, all the immortals in the great assembly chanted in praise. Lions spoke, phoenixes sang, fish and dragons took human form, withered trees revived, and even the lowliest creatures were moved—all received blessings without exception. Majestic and resplendent, all ascended as immortals. Then the Dao Lord, Lord Lao, and the boundless host of perfected beings joined in unison, extolling: "Today we have heard the wondrous teaching and gained great benefit." They took their leave and departed.

*Thus concludes the Wondrous Sutra of the Great One for Salvation from Suffering and Protection of the Body.*
