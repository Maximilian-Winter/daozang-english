#1 The Heavenly Worthy once wandered in the Fragrant Grove Garden, where he expounded the wondrous Dharma for all sentient beings, opening and revealing the wondrous gate. At that time, a five-colored, subtle, and marvelous radiance issued from his mouth, its light pervading the ten directions and the boundless worlds, even illuminating the Nine Dark Hells of the boundless nether realms. From heaven above to earth below, none remained unilluminated.

Among the assembly was a Perfected One named Dharma Comprehension, who rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, prostrated himself, and knelt to address the Heavenly Worthy: "All in this assembly, through merits and virtues accumulated over past lives, have met once in ten thousand kalpas with the Heavenly Worthy, who now proclaims the wondrous Dharma. All disciples, prostrating and kowtowing, their five limbs touching the ground, earnestly beseech the Dharma, their blood flowing upon the earth."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by great compassion, raised his hand and snapped his fingers, admonishing his disciples: "Excellent, excellent! You must think of all sentient beings with utmost care and reverence. This Dharma is profoundly deep; only a true person could have entreated its revelation. Now, for your sake, I shall expound these causes and conditions. Listen carefully, listen carefully! Guard purity, observe diligently, cherish and uphold it, revering it day and night, and never neglect the rites.

If there are sentient beings who, with haughty minds, do not believe, slight its reception, harbor slanderous thoughts, and fail to generate faith and reverence, their minds unguarded in purity—then in future lives, they shall become beasts, all manner of creeping things. Even in this present life, on the day of their rebirth, their eyebrows and beards shall fall out, their entire bodies erupting in sores, their flesh rotting away. They shall dwell exposed like birds, abandoned among men. All who see them shall feel revulsion; parents, wives, and children shall grieve to the breaking of their hearts. Such are those who suffer—how can their pain be endured? All this arises from the causes they themselves have wrought; it is not the fault of others. Each must reflect deeply and act with discernment."

#2 Dharma Comprehension said: "I do not yet understand—what kalpas did these sinful beings live in past lives? What are the roots of their suffering, and what karmic causes do they face? I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to graciously bestow his compassion and elucidate the roots of their sins."

The Heavenly Worthy replied to the Perfected One of the Left Mystery: #3 "These sinful beings each have their own karmic causes. Kalpa after kalpa, generation after generation, they establish blessings and create enmity, all arising from their own actions. The great sages of the ten directions never lead beings astray. Now, I wish to tell you all: listen carefully as I expound this sutra of the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings.

All you disciples, men and women alike, in a single thought, arouse the mind of diligence. For seven days and seven nights, eat only vegetable fare and observe a strict fast. On the tenth day of the month, within a single day’s twelve hours, burn incense and perform the Dao-circumambulation. Invite the Daoist masters to establish the ritual arena, light forty-nine lamps, and hang banners and canopies. Recite this sutra seven times day and night, repenting for seven days and seven nights. Then you, all disciples, along with your fragrant-fire companions, the seven generations of ancestors, and past departed ones, shall have the roots of your karmic sins and transgressions entirely dissolved.

If there are those who have not encountered this sutra and fall into hell, yet utter the names of the Three Treasures even once, I shall follow their cry to deliver them, leading them out of hell and into heaven. How much more so for you, who for seven days and seven nights eat only vegetable fare, observe a strict fast, burn incense and light lamps, recite this sutra, and repent—all the past sins within your bodies shall be eradicated. If you do not repent, your sins shall be difficult to remove. All you disciples, listen carefully!

Among the Perfected Ones of the ten directions, all men and women—whether for the departed, the living, or themselves—may offer gold, silver, elephants, horses, carriages, clothing, bedding, or donate fields and dwellings. They may relinquish the precious treasures upon their bodies or other miscellaneous valuables, encouraging the creation of sutras and images. Or they may offer alms to the Dharma masters, dedicating their wealth and sincerity, approaching the masters to request the Dharma, recite the sutra, receive the precepts, bare their hearts in repentance, kowtow before the honored ones, and listen to the masters’ expositions. They may repent for their own thousand sins and myriad afflictions, wishing for their dissolution."

#4 The Heavenly Worthy said: "If there are those of true sincerity who can arouse a good mind and wish to create sutras and images, they should prepare whatever they can at that very moment, according to their means. Do not delay, lest the prior vow be lost. It shall become an enemy to the self, a fault spoken for ten thousand kalpas. If there are offerings of goods for vegetarian feasts or alms given to Dharma masters, they should be distributed immediately, not left for later. If the mind wavers, creating obstacles for others, then in the past, one shall surely enter hell, enduring all manner of suffering and affliction, becoming a hungry ghost. Or one may become an animal, and even if reborn as a human, one shall be deaf, blind, or afflicted with the six illnesses, poor and lowly. Or one may become an orphan, dependent on others for sustenance, suffering hunger, cold, and hardship, with none to show compassion. In the dead of night, one shall weep in sorrow, grief and distress filling the heart, never knowing joy. Or one may become a pig, dog, ox, sheep, or other beast, constantly subjected to slaughter, repaying past transgressions. Even if spoken of for countless kalpas, their sufferings cannot be exhausted.

Now, I tell you, all disciples: cultivate yourselves with utmost care."

#5 The Perfected One of the Left Mystery prostrated himself and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "I beseech you, for the sake of all sentient beings in the kalpas of karmic roots and sins, to expound this sutra of the Three Wretched Realms, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties."

Blind and deaf beings alike all raised their heads to listen. Those who heard this sutra universally received joy, rejoicing with delight, bowing their heads in reverence, wishing to hear more.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed all sentient beings: "Good men and good women, I have often surveyed the heavens and wandered through the hells, where I have seen suffering beings bearing great yokes upon their necks, wooden shackles upon their arms, heavy fetters upon their feet, iron spikes upon their bodies, fire in their mouths, blades and needles piercing their backs, sword trees impaling their hearts, evil birds pecking out their eyes, iron plows tearing their tongues, molten copper poured into their mouths, every joint ablaze, iron pellets burning their throats until they rot, cauldrons of boiling water seething and simmering, copper pillars pressing against their bodies. Some ascend mountains of knives, their flesh and bones ground to pulp. Some enter furnaces of charcoal, their fat dripping and igniting, then are cast into freezing ice, piercing their hearts and bones. Some are made to lie upon iron beds, their bodies festered and rotting, transforming into ghostly forms, their shapes distorted beyond recognition. Some lie within fields of snow, their hearts and entrails torn apart, blades cutting into their flesh until blood and muscle turn to mud, their bones ground to dust, their sinews gathered into heaps, only to be reborn as hungry ghosts. Ox-headed demons raise their clubs, hell wardens wield their forks, driving and tormenting the sinners without respite. For countless kalpas they revolve in this cycle—when shall they ever return?

All you sentient beings, strive to restrain yourselves and mortify your bodies, diligently cultivate merit and virtue. All you disciples and assemblies, rouse your original resolve—only then may you attain liberation."

Before the words were finished, the Perfected One of the Left Mystery again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "I pray, what karmic offenses did these beings commit in their past lives? What cruel acts did they perform? Which precepts did they violate? The ignorant among us do not understand. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to take pity on those suffering punishment, to reveal their transgressions so that they may be cautious and refrain from further wrongdoing. We do not know what meritorious deeds to cultivate to eradicate these karmic roots."

Then all the assemblies aroused the Dao-mind, bowing their heads to the Heavenly Worthy, wishing to hear the explicit teaching.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "All you assemblies, if your hearts delight in hearing this sutra of the Two Wretched Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, listen carefully and take it to heart. This sutra is subtle and wondrous, beyond conception. Among all sutras, it is foremost. Among the highest teachings, it is foremost. In repentance and deliverance of the deceased, in rescuing from suffering, it is foremost. This sutra is noble, the king of all sutras.

The Three Wretched Paths are: first, the hell realm; second, the animal realm; third, the hungry ghost realm. These are called the Three Wretched Paths.

The Five Sufferings are: first, embracing the copper pillar; second, treading the mountain of knives; third, climbing the tree of swords; fourth, entering the cauldron of boiling water; fifth, swallowing fire and eating coals. These are called the Five Sufferings.

The Eight Difficulties are: first, being born and escaping the Three Evil Realms; second, having escaped and become human, leaving the female form to become male; third, having attained a male body, possessing all six senses and four limbs; fourth, possessing all six senses and being born in the Central Kingdom; fifth, being born in the Central Kingdom and encountering a sagely ruler and parents; sixth, encountering a sagely ruler and cultivating the Dao with joy throughout one’s life, with a kind and benevolent heart; seventh, having cultivated a benevolent heart and believing in the Dao of immortality; eighth, believing in the Dao and virtue yet not being born in an era of great peace under a sagely emperor, and for ten thousand kalpas not encountering the Three Treasures. These are called the Eight Difficulties.

The Three Calamities are: first, the calamity of conscription and great warfare; second, the calamity of chronic illness throughout the year; third, the calamity of encountering great floods while traveling or at rest. These are called the Three Calamities.

The Five Sufferings are: first, the suffering of drowning in water; second, the suffering of burning in fire; third, the suffering of being killed or wounded by bandits; fourth, the suffering of being possessed by demonic spirits; fifth, the suffering of all poisons, stings, bites, and deep pain. These are called the Five Sufferings.

The Five Turbidities are: first, the turbidity of perverse views; second, the turbidity of the kalpa’s decline, when days and months grow short; third, the turbidity of sentient beings, their spirits dimmed; fourth, the turbidity of afflictions, with anger and strife; fifth, the turbidity of the lifespan, with premature death, wives and children parted midway, orphaned boys and girls grieving in sorrow. These are called the Five Turbidities.

The Eight Practices are: first, enduring wrongs without complaint; second, yielding virtue to others; third, not desiring what others desire; fourth, tolerating matters without seeking redress; fifth, distancing oneself from the unprincipled and concealing oneself in quietude; sixth, wholeheartedly serving the state, mindful of the Three Treasures, burning incense to the sun and moon, maintaining perpetual fasting, making offerings to those who have left the household life, never violating benevolence and trust; seventh, never betraying the scriptures and precepts, living in the world without breaking fasts, diligently sweeping clean rooms, tending lamps and stoves, rescuing the poor, the lowly, women in childbirth, the old, the sick, the orphaned, the weak, and all deficient beings—upon seeing them, arousing a heart of compassion; eighth, dedicating one’s life to the Dao, never slandering those who have left the household life, harboring no judgments, constantly reciting scriptures, seeing all living beings and arousing a heart of compassion, treating all equally, without self or other, good and evil, beauty and ugliness all the same as one’s own body. These are called the Eight Practices.

The Four Immeasurables are: first, immeasurable kindness; second, immeasurable love; third, immeasurable goodness; fourth, immeasurable patience. These are called the Four Immeasurables.

The Six Dusts are: first, the ear hearing gong and shang tones; second, the eye seeing blue, yellow, white, black, and red; third, the nose knowing fragrance and stench; fourth, the body knowing hardness and softness, dryness and dampness; fifth, the tongue knowing pungent, sour, bitter, harsh, and sweet; sixth, the mind knowing good and evil, joy and anger, sorrow and happiness. That which comes from without is called dust; that which stirs within is called emotion."

These are called the Six Emotions and Six Dusts.

The Six Penetrations are: ear, eye, nose, body, tongue, and mind—these are called the Six Penetrations, the Six Roots sharing commonality.

The Three Poisons are: first, greed and lust; second, anger and hatred; third, ignorance and delusion. These are called the Three Poisons.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying: "When I previously expounded this Scripture of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings for all sentient beings, all—whether near or far—attained wisdom and understanding, entering the Dharma Gate together."

Left Mystery Perfected One again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "All sentient beings whose roots are in sin, having now heard the Heavenly Worthy expound the retribution of sin and blessing, including those beneath your seat and all disciples—hungry ghosts, animals, and beings suffering from cold, hunger, and hardship—upon hearing this scripture, all clearly understood. Each has cultivated and refined themselves, no longer daring to commit further transgressions. For those who have passed away, if they are in hell enduring the transgressions of the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, what method is foremost to save the departed and relieve their suffering?"

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One, saying: "If you wish to save the departed, at the time of their passing, seek masters from all directions to proclaim the precepts and repentance for the deceased. Have them recite and transfer the scripture at the roadside tomb, inviting masters to burn incense for the departed, praise and repent, and dedicate resources to the deceased, including the possessions of their sons and daughters, redirecting them for almsgiving. This accrues the deepest merit. On the forty-ninth day, the hundredth day, and other commemorative days, reduce offerings, commission scriptures and images, observe fasts, and light forty-nine lamps. Make banners of forty-nine feet of silk and hang them on tall poles. If this cannot be accomplished, then make small banners of seven feet, commission the *Scripture of Lingbao* and the *Scripture of the Five Sufferings*, and recite them day and night seven times. Within the forty-nine days, the sins of the departed will be determined. Within a hundred days, they will be assigned to one of the Five Paths. The method just expounded for saving the departed from suffering is foremost."

Left Mystery Perfected One again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Among those in the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, all sentient beings who have heard this scripture—can the departed, following their vows, be reborn in places of bliss? May they hear of this?"

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying: "All the living and the dead who hear me expound this scripture should cultivate merit and virtue, following their vows to be reborn. Listen to my Five Remembrances. For the living and the dead, those who recite this scripture seven times will enable all sentient beings and the departed to be reborn according to their vows as novices, leaving the household life to serve the Three Treasures."

The Dharma Explanation states: "Now, hearing that the Heavenly Worthy is about to expound the text of the Five Remembrances, all sentient beings rejoice and leap with joy, wholeheartedly desiring to hear."

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying: "Those who wish to recite my Five Remembrances must observe long fasts, maintain purity, wear clean garments, single-mindedly invite a master, and receive and practice according to the Dharma. If this is not done, they will surely fall into hell with no return. Strive diligently, maintain purity, uphold and receive with wholehearted devotion, never daring to lose proper decorum."

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One and all human and ghost beings, saying: "Listen with a tranquil mind to the Scripture of the Five Remembrances.

**First Remembrance:**
Constantly cherish the Three Treasures with compassion,
Wishing to deliver and lift from the fiery pit.
Myriad sins and a thousand calamities all disperse,
The lame and sick, long-bound, all can walk.
Demons and evil ghosts are imprisoned in hell,
Men and women of the world generate the mind for the Dao.
The five rebellious enemies all rejoice together,
Cauldrons of boiling water transform into lotus ponds.
All sentient beings in the Dharma realm chant goodness,
The departed follow and are reborn.
**Second Remembrance:**
Seeing all the multitudes before me,
Strive to observe long fasts and build bridges.
Recall the suffering of hell and the Three Paths,
Diligently practice almsgiving and burn incense.
Receive the precepts, recite scriptures, and honor with reverence,
All the departed ascend to heaven.
The Heavenly Worthy snaps his fingers, addressing all,
The dark hells swiftly generate light.
All sentient beings in the Dharma realm diligently cultivate the Dao,
One day they will be reborn in the center.
**Third Remembrance:**
The departed are most pitiable,
Once in the tomb, they rarely see the sky.
They refused to establish the Dao field,
Receiving mud money at the four seasons and eight festivals.
In hell, they endure suffering and affliction,
Their mouths cry out in vain to the August Heaven.
In life, they refused to cultivate merit and virtue,
Now shackled in iron, beaten with rods and whips.
In a single day, they die ten thousand deaths,
Even as the six kinds of livestock for years.
Hungry and cold, their backs broken, unable to speak,
After a year or two, they are pierced through the nose and led.
Filial sons and daughters perform meritorious deeds,
The five rebellious sons and daughters sever karmic ties.
Sated with wine and meat, they seek livelihoods,
Yet not a single coin is offered for the departed.
If in life they had performed abundant merit,
The departed would be reborn before the Three Treasures.
**Fourth Remembrance:**
Sentient beings lack a good mind,
Slandering the Three Treasures, they sink into perdition.
Though entering the Dao field, their intentions are impure,
Praising and speaking of the left-home ones.
They are made to embrace copper pillars and iron beds,
Sword trees and knife mountains press upon their bodies.
In agony, they seek a master but find none,
Ox-headed hell guards forcibly approach.
Iron forks thrust them into cauldrons of boiling water,
Pestles pound, mills grind them into fine dust.
They constantly endure all manner of suffering,
All because they slandered the left-home ones.
Those who leave home do not necessarily enter hell,
All sentient beings scorn the mind for the Dao.
I tell all sentient beings:
Strive to firmly uphold a good mind for the Dao.
All sentient beings, turn your thoughts to right mindfulness,
Follow your vows to be reborn in the Fragrant Grove.
**Fifth Remembrance:**
Fellow students of the Five Remembrances, leave home early,
The heavy hindrances of ignorance sprout the seed of wisdom.
Hell transforms into the bliss of heaven,
Iron beds and copper pillars produce lotus flowers.
All sentient beings receive happiness,
Accompanied by three or five, they ascend on clouds.
At all six periods, they constantly hear the sound of bells and chimes,
Wishing their descendants would always leave home.
Clad in Dharma robes, they convert the multitudes,
Their mouths recite the *Lingbao*, severing demonic evil.
The seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven,
The departed are reborn to serve amidst fragrant flowers."

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying: "Previously, I expounded these Five Remembrances for all sentient beings, clearly explaining this scripture, yet I fear they may not yet understand."

"All you Perfected Ones of the ten directions, expound these teachings again with skillful means, with utmost care and diligence. If there are sentient beings who awaken understanding in their hearts, maintain single-minded right mindfulness, protect purity, and uphold this scripture—those who virtuously recite it, or dedicate it to the living or deceased, travelers, the ill, or all beings—by directing their thoughts toward it, they will eradicate the sins of ten thousand kalpas for both themselves and others. In their dreams, they will constantly behold the Three Treasures, encounter good spiritual friends, and wherever they are reborn, they will always enjoy happiness. If they maintain long-term purity, observe the precepts, burn incense, and pay homage day and night during the six periods without ever forgetting, then in this life and the next, they will carry the scripture and precepts within, leave home as novices, and make offerings to the Three Treasures. If they establish meditation halls, copy and uphold the scripture, adorn and display its scrolls, and propagate it to those who have not yet heard, all who see and hear it will accumulate boundless merit.

Left Mystery Perfected One bowed in reverence and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: 'All sentient beings are blindly attached, consumed by greed, anger, and hatred, their hearts not yet turned toward the Dao. Even if they do turn their hearts, they may offer a hundred fine horses, a thousand jeweled chariots, and all manner of external goods as alms, yet their minds remain coarse and clamorous, unaware of the merit they gain.'

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, expounded further. All present bowed their heads in right mindfulness and wholeheartedly vowed to practice.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying: 'All sentient beings who do not believe in or honor the Three Treasures, scriptures, images, purity, or precepts—observe the laity: among them are the poor, the lowly, the deaf, the blind, those afflicted with the six illnesses, those lacking in good appearance, and those who fall short of human status. If there are beings who wish to practice almsgiving but do not generate faith or reverence, nor honor the Three Treasures, such individuals will surely receive this retribution. It is like a mirror reflecting a person: clarity and purity follow one’s original nature, with no杂见. If one is black, black is seen; if white, white is seen—all follows the root. Sin is likewise. If you do not believe, hell is present before you. Hell resides within the human body; there is no need to seek it afar.'

All in the ten directions bowed in reverence, wholeheartedly turning toward the Dao, wishing to see and hear.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed all present: 'After my passing, if there are sentient beings who obtain this scripture, uphold, recite, and protect its purity, or skillfully expound it for others—if there are those who, lacking faith, defile it with impurity—they will incur sins in the future and be reborn as beasts. But if there are beings who relinquish their wealth, treasures, and external goods to make offerings, dedicating them to scriptures and images, or to purity feasts and life ransoming, they will gain merit in the future, assuredly ascend to heaven, forever dwelling in noble households, kalpa after kalpa, generation after generation, bound to good causes. They will eradicate the sins of ten thousand kalpas and be delivered to ascend as immortals.'

The Heavenly Worthy continued: 'All you sentient beings, listen carefully as I explain the five kinds of almsgiving and their merits, which should never depart from your thoughts. First, if there are beings who, of their own volition, practice almsgiving and encourage others to offer support to Dharma masters for the creation of scriptures and images—even a single coin—will receive a reward forty thousand times over. Ten thousand coins or more yield an immeasurable reward. For ten thousand kalpas, they will constantly enjoy happiness, teaching and transforming all, forever serving as masters to others.

Second, if there are beings who practice almsgiving and encourage others to support the copying of scriptures, as well as the adornment of meditation halls with banners, flowers, lamps, and candles—even a single coin—will receive a reward forty thousand times over. Ten thousand coins or more yield an immeasurable reward. They will be reborn in the central lands, endowed with wisdom and clarity, constantly beholding the Three Treasures, forever free from afflictions, abiding in effortless bliss.

Third, if there are beings who suddenly generate great compassion and encourage others to practice almsgiving for the poor, the lowly, the orphaned, the weak, the elderly, the sick, the hungry, widows, the cold, travelers, and sojourners—even a single coin—will receive a reward twenty-five thousand times over. Ten thousand coins or more yield an immeasurable reward. Wherever they are reborn, they will always enjoy wealth and nobility, with clothing and food naturally provided.

Fourth, if there are beings who, for the sake of past and present parents, suddenly generate vast vows and encourage all to practice almsgiving among Dharma masters, novices, and faithful men and women—even a single coin—will receive a reward twenty thousand times over. Ten thousand coins or more yield an immeasurable reward. Through skillful encouragement, they will turn others’ hearts toward the Dao. In this life, they will receive their reward, leave home, attain longevity, constantly expound the scriptures, and inspire good thoughts in others.

Fifth, if there are beings who generate good thoughts, take pity on all, and encourage almsgiving to teach butchers to cease killing, to turn their hearts toward ransoming lives, to constantly recite the Dao, observe the precepts, and practice accordingly—extending to prisoners, women in childbirth, the hungry, the cold, all creatures, the five grave offenders, and the unfilial—if they reverse their minds to generate compassion, restrain their speech, turn

Though their blessings may be abundant, they are insufficient to offset their transgressions; not a single fragment of merit remains. Only when one calculates merits to counterbalance faults does one begin to comprehend the nature of sin and blessing.

I exhort all men and women: cease from further transgressions, and blessings shall endure. Through this causal connection, it is called "ten-thousandfold reward." All assembled here, be vigilant—most vigilant!

At that time, all in the assembly praised the teaching, bowed their heads in reverence, paid homage to the Heavenly Worthy, and respectfully withdrew.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, further expounded in verse:

All dharmas in their essence
Are pure and ever serene.
Retribution arises from the mind—
Suffering and joy are not external causes.
Hell and heaven,
Clearly lie before your eyes.
The future is profoundly obscure;
Examine and contemplate it deeply.
Reflect on your present life,
Where delusion leads you astray.
The mind cannot attain clarity,
Bound and entangled by its own knots.
In darkness, what can be seen or known?
Time flows on like a passing stream.
In an instant, youthful radiance fades,
And one swiftly descends to the Yellow Springs.
Good and evil are not two dharmas;
Right and wrong share a single source.
Those who perceive them generate distinctions,
For their minds are clouded by ignorance.
Following one’s desires, one enters the gates of celestial immortals;
Defying them, one passes through the doors of hell.
Through profound reflection and self-realization,
One becomes the Supreme Worthy.
Alas for the deluded,
Who know not the true Dao!
Like rotting reins controlling six horses,
One lives in constant fear of a sudden bolt.
Clinging thoughts arise moment by moment,
And faults lie in the restless mind.
Abandon form, forget good and evil,
Seal the senses and close the gates.
Birth and death are retributive responses,
Surely arising from this very body.
If one discerns existence and cessation,
In quiescence, one returns to the Real.
Emerging into life brings differentiation;
Entering death is utterly equal.
Earth, water, fire, and wind disperse,
Yet each finds affinity in its place.
Heaven and earth govern the great order,
With no intent toward any individual.
Calculating the principles of rebirth,
It is neither fruit nor cause.
Collect the mind and cultivate inner conduct—
Enlightenment comes in less than ten days.
If the mind races toward external realms,
One remains in darkness without bound.
Among all treasuries of merit,
Praise stands foremost.
With expedient means, one guides those lost at the ford;
Through compassion, one skillfully leads them.
Accumulating good becomes a field of blessings;
Accumulating evil breeds calamity and misfortune.
Provisional names are inherently empty;
What constancy lies in skillful adaptation?
Deluded and unaware,
One remains lost for days unending.
Terrified of hell,
One suffers torment in boiling cauldrons and hanging agonies.
I open the source of still waters,
To wash away the dust of habitual defilements.
Once body and mind are purified,
For endless kalpas, they shall not decay.
Of old, I heard that those who uphold the precepts
Cultivate forbearance and attain uprightness.
Now, beholding the Heavenly Worthy,
Words cannot express His praise.
Eighty-one marks of excellence shine forth,
Seventy-two signs of purity adorn Him.
His body is lustrous as jade, firm as vajra,
Forever free from decline or decay.
His cinnabar lips seem about to part,
His radiant teeth gleam in response.
His voice is naturally gentle,
Compassion flows from His inherent nature.
His wisdom is like a bellows and key,
His meditative mind like a mirror of water.
This arises from upholding the precepts,
Attaining fruition as a Great Sage.

Thus concludes *The Supreme Cavernous Numinous Treasure Sutra of Rebirth and Salvation from Suffering*.

Now, the Heavenly Worthy once more addressed the assembly, saying:

"All beings within the Dharma Realm, heed my words! I now proclaim to all living beings: those who have perished in the past and emerged from hell shall ascend upon clouds and mist, their steps light upon the turning axis of the Dao. Though their cries of anguish resound, their sins are thus.

I declare to you, all beings: for those who have committed the four hundred myriad transgressions—whether starving elders, laboring women, or those who have fallen into rebirth—if they make offerings among the assembly to Dharma masters and novices, to pure men and women of faith, all shall be spared the trials of childbirth, their mouths freed from restraint. Before the Three Treasures, if they present even a single piece of incense, their merits shall be boundless, their blessings measureless."
