**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Deliverance from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings to Transcend Birth and Death**

At that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Grove Garden of the Ever-Joyful World, expounding the subtle and wondrous true sutra of the Mysterious Unity and the principle of the Non-Dual Wondrous Gate and the Profound Mystery to the Five Venerable Sovereigns, the Ten Ultimate Perfected, the Three Clarities, and the boundless assembly of sagely hosts. All those present heard the Dharma-sound, awakened to the subtle and imperceptible, and attained the realm of true constancy. The joy of humans and gods was beyond description.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy emitted a nine-colored radiance of subtle and wondrous light, universally illuminating the boundless worlds of the ten directions. Heaven above and earth below, within and without, were all pervasively luminous, like lapis lazuli, without obstruction. Thereupon, the immeasurable beings in the hells beneath the Nine Dark Realms were seen enduring manifold torments. In the thirty-six prisons, sinful souls were examined and punished; the enforcing divine soldiers, the mighty heavenly warriors, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the one hundred and twenty offices—all administered tortures without respite. Some embraced bronze pillars, some lay upon iron beds, some ascended knife mountains, some climbed sword trees; their bodies bore iron staves, their heads wore mountains of fire. Some entered cauldrons of boiling liquid, some passed through furnaces of charcoal; they were hung upside down or stood inverted, crushed and ground, parched by drinking fiery essence, starved by eating embers. Molten bronze was poured into their mouths, and fire blazed in every joint. Some were pressed by boulders, their bodies pierced by needle points; some leapt north and south within pits of burning coals. In freezing ice, their flesh and bones split apart; they were sawed asunder, hacked by blades, pecked by birds, swallowed by serpents. Some were nailed with long spikes, some had their tongues plowed by iron plows; some languished in filth and stench, some were submerged in dark and boundless waves. Some bore iron mountains on their backs, filling rivers and flooding seas. Some had their spines broken by ox-head demons, some were gnawed by bronze dogs. In an instant, they died ten thousand deaths, enduring boundless suffering for kalpas without end. When their retributions were exhausted, they were reborn as other kinds: as pigs, geese, chickens, ducks—slaughtered at human whim; as camels, horses, oxen, donkeys—subjected to human control; as deer, wild beasts, flying birds, fish, venomous vipers, evil serpents, jackals, wolves, tigers, leopards—devouring one another in endless succession. If reborn as humans, they were afflicted with the six illnesses: blindness, deafness, muteness, lameness, crippled hands, festering sores covering their bodies, flesh rotting away, noses collapsing, leprosy, madness, and idiocy. Some suffered from chronic illnesses, bedridden in misery; some were hideous in appearance, lacking in wisdom; some endured freezing cold, hunger, and poverty, destitute and alone; some were born as lowly slaves and servants, restrained and oppressed by others, without freedom. Such sins followed them like shadows, and for kalpas they revolved in the wheel of rebirth without respite.

At that time, the assembly, witnessing these causes and conditions, sighed in sorrow and lamentation, filled with compassion. Then, from among the assembly, a Perfected One named Dharma-Comprehension arose from his seat, composed and dignified, adjusting his robes and cap. He prostrated before the Heavenly Worthy, touching his head to the ground, advanced, and made obeisance, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "Since I have attended upon You, through countless kalpas in the realms of the Three Clarities, the golden palaces and jade towers, I have dwelt in tranquility and non-action, roaming freely in bliss. I have wandered the domains of the Perfected, feasting and listening to the Dharma-sound. Such joy has endured for kalpas untold. Yet never before have I witnessed these causes and conditions of birth and death, the endless cycle of the six paths, and the boundless suffering. I do not know what transgressions these sin

The Five Sufferings are: the mountains of knives and forests of swords, the bronze pillars and boiling cauldrons, the endless waves of the dark sea—these are called the Five Sufferings.

The Eight Difficulties are:
1. To be born in the human realm,
2. To depart from the female form and become male,
3. To possess a complete and unblemished body,
4. To be born in the Central Kingdom,
5. To encounter a sovereign or father of the Dao,
6. To be endowed with a nature of kindness and benevolence,
7. To dwell in a land of great peace,
8. To encounter the Three Treasures.
When all eight are fulfilled, it is the greatest of good causes. If any are lacking, it is called difficulty.

By these manifold sufferings, one drifts and cannot return, tossed and submerged, forever severed from the Dao. Indulging in the Five Defilements, clinging to the Six Desires, assailed by external temptations and internal afflictions, entangled in calamities and stained by misfortunes—the six senses of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, with their objects of beauty and ugliness, right and wrong, thoughts arising in unbroken succession—once the human path is lost, one falls into hell, where the long night is dark and there is no means of deliverance.

The Dharma-Comprehension further said: "Sentient beings, deluded by false thoughts, fail to recognize the true and real. They cling to right and wrong, cycling through karmic transgressions, following the dictates of their minds and desires—all these are the causes of sin. How fleeting is human life, arising and perishing in an instant, like a spark from stone, never enduring long, like a floating bubble, utterly without solidity. Birth, aging, sickness, and death assail one day and night. Change and decay are constant; in an instant, all disperses and crumbles. Even if one attains wealth and nobility, it is but a brief moment. How much more for those who suffer hunger and poverty, grief and sorrow, or are afflicted by the six illnesses, their bodies incomplete—when death comes, they return once more to hell. Such suffering is truly pitiable. I only wish that Your Great Compassion may widely open the gates of expedient means, reveal the Great Dao, and establish the path of deliverance, so that these sinful souls and future men and women may all receive the blessings of the Dharma and universally enter the hall of fortune."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "If there are sentient beings whose Three Actions are pure, they will not fall into the Three Wretched Paths. The Three Actions are: bodily action, mental action, and verbal action. Bodily action consists of lust, killing, and theft. Mental action consists of anger, greed, ignorance, and delusion. Verbal action consists of frivolous speech, falsehood, divisive words, and abusive language. These Three Actions are the roots of the Ten Actions; they obstruct good causes and breed sin and affliction. If one can purify them, one will forever avoid the Three Wretched Paths. If there are sentient beings whose Five Poisons are purified, they will escape the Five Sufferings. The Five Poisons are: the eyes beholding the five colors, the ears hearing the five sounds, the nose coveting the five fragrances, the tongue tasting the five flavors, and the mind generating the five desires—these are the roots of the Five Poisons. For kalpas unending, one remains entangled, with no liberation. If one can purify them, the Five Sufferings will be forever eradicated. If there are sentient beings who cultivate the Eight Practices, they will transcend the Eight Difficulties and unite with the Dao in truth. The Eight Practices are:
1. Filial piety,
2. Benevolence and kindness,
3. Chastity and integrity,
4. Loyalty and sincerity,
5. Forbearance and goodness,
6. Gentleness and harmony,
7. Upholding the precepts and fasting, meditating on the Great Dao,
8. Treating all beings with equality, without enmity or partiality.
By cultivating these, merit and virtue become full; the body transcends the Eight Difficulties and forever ascends the ranks of immortality. These are the essential principles of practice in the above Dharma-gates, transforming the coarse into the subtle and attaining the Dao to ascend to perfection. The Heavenly Worthies of the Three Times and the Great Sages of the Ten Directions all cultivated these practices to ascend into the realm of non-action. Out of compassion, you pity the multitudes; you should expound and proclaim what has not yet been heard. In the midst of the sea of suffering and the river of craving, with my Dharma-teachings, you shall rescue and dredge up sentient beings, so that men and women of future generations may all know to cultivate and revere, escape the net of afflictions, sever the roots of doubt, ascend the mountain of liberation, and reach the realm of carefree wandering. With body and mind purified, they shall deeply enter the Dharma-gates."

The Dharma-Comprehension further said: "The gates of the Three Actions, Five Poisons, and Eight Practices are inconceivable, most true and most wondrous. In future worlds and among the present beings of heaven and earth, those who hear this Dharma-sound should awaken and understand. How much more for those who diligently advance and cultivate in accordance with these teachings—they shall certainly attain the Dao. Yet within the hells, the present imprisoned souls, confined in the cold courts, wander through the long night, their bones cut by the wind and knives, their bodies afflicted by manifold sufferings, their hunger and weariness unceasing, their cycles of rebirth endless. And for all the people of future generations, when death comes, they should be delivered. I pray that You may bestow enlightenment and grant them the decisive words, so that both the living and the dead may receive Your grace and be delivered in life and death."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The standards for deliverance and the texts for salvation are fully contained in the scriptures of the Three Caverns. Now I shall proclaim the essential words for you. Listen carefully, receive, and uphold them, and widely disseminate them. Those who study the Dao should establish virtue and merit, refine their qi and sit in forgetfulness, cultivate the real and ingest the elixirs, proclaim the scriptures and expound the teachings, assist the state and deliver the people. To practice all these is true action. Though merit and practice may be complete and the fruits of karma perfect, one must first deliver the nine generations of ancestors and the seven generations of forebears, the departed spirits of parents, and cause them to ascend to heaven. Only when the ghostly registers are entirely cleared may the body attain the Dao. How much more for the people of the world, bound by worldly customs—if filial sons and daughters, upon the death of their parents and all their kin, fear that those ghostly spirits may fall into the Three Evil Paths, enter hell, or be confined in Fengdu, where the darkness is profound and they endure manifold sufferings—they must rely on merit and virtue, widely cultivate fields of blessings, deliver the destitute souls, and dissolve karmic entanglements. Beyond this realm, in the Eastern Palace of Ultimate Extremity, there is the Heavenly Worthy of Instantaneous Salvation through Sound, the Great Compassionate One. He has made vast vows to universally save sentient beings; for countless kalpas, he has delivered beings without number. If one can dedicate merit, turn the mind in a single thought of refuge, visualize his august countenance, and invoke his name, he will respond to the call, come to the aid, and in all suffering, there is none he will not save and protect. Therefore, he is called the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through Suffering. Widely exhort all beings to diligently pay homage and invoke him."

Furthermore, among the Three Caverns’ scriptures, those that relieve suffering and deliver the departed, the kindling of lamps is supreme. Across the five directions and eight extremities, within the dark prisons of hell—the regions of utmost yin and the realms of eternal night—departed souls are imprisoned, cut off from the Three Luminaries. Amidst the gloom, they endure all manner of torture and torment. One should fashion a lamp-tree and kindle nine cups of lamps, continuing from the moment of death through the seven sevens. As the lamp-light persists, it shines downward into the Nine Netherworlds. Upon beholding this radiance, the souls shall immediately attain liberation.

Moreover, with silken banners, one may craft a *Treasure Mill for Transmigrating Spirits*, forty-nine feet in length, or fashion seven small pennants to hang from a tall pole, allowing them to flutter in the wind, whereby all sins are extinguished. Additionally, one may transcribe this scripture upon paper or fine silk, distribute it to learners, and propagate its recitation. Thereby, the departed shall ascend beyond suffering, the hells shall know tranquility, and the blessings of the virtuous shall extend to future generations.

Those who offer precious adornments, garments, or their lifelong possessions to shelter the destitute and relieve the impoverished shall accrue merit akin to the foregoing. Their names shall be stricken from the Black Registers, their records expunged by the Earthly Offices, and their spirits shall ascend to the divine realms, reborn according to their vows. Their descendants shall be blessed, freed from calamities and afflictions, and their boundless virtue and goodness shall defy all measure.

Therefore, one ought to diligently and sincerely receive these teachings, propagate and entrust them widely, and universally deliver both humans and devas. At that time, the assembly—comprising exalted sages, the Three Realms’ perfected immortals, the guardian spirits, the celestial soldiers and mounted officers, and the innumerable hosts of all offices—all attained effortless enlightenment, ascending together to the Dao-fruit. The Three Terraces of Hell and the countless suffering souls therein all gained merit and were instantly liberated. The ten directions’ prisons, with their cauldrons and boiling vats, transformed into cool purity, free from all sorrow and distress.

The Heavenly Perfected, the devas, humans, dragons, and ghosts present in the Dharma assembly heard this scripture with joy, faithfully received it, reverently upheld it, made obeisance, and withdrew.

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture of the Highest Numinous Treasure on Deliverance from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, Liberating from Birth and Death*.
