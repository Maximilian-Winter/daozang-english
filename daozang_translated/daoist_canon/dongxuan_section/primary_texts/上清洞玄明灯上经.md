**The Supreme Clarity Cavernous Mystery Luminous Lamp Scripture**

The Great Tenuity communicates the wondrous, radiant and penetrating through the distant and obscure. It continues the mysterious light of the Great Yang and unfolds the precious chapters of the luminous lamp. Originating in spontaneity, it receives the essence of the sun and moon’s brilliance. Gleaming in subtle obscurity, it scatters its radiance to illumine the void. There is no heaven it does not pervade, no darkness it does not illuminate, no realm it does not render mysterious. Unless one is of profound destiny, with seven generations of accumulated merit, this scripture cannot be glimpsed.

Those who encounter it must treasure and exhort one another. To receive this scripture, one must swear golden, azure, and jade oaths, bestowed upon a precipitous cliff. If faith and covenant are lacking, or if one’s conduct is unexceptional, the careless and unworthy must not rashly transmit it. Those who wish to receive it must first declare their purification; only when numinous signs manifest may it be transmitted.

The Supreme Ultimate Highest Mystery Perfected One ascended the jade terrace of the Nine Empyreans. Bowing his head beneath the window lattice, he inquired of the Purple Palace Elder, seeking enlightenment and wisdom. With elbows and knees he hastened forward, and as the hours passed, the Elder at last spoke, saying: “What you ask is wondrous indeed.” Now, resplendent with the Seven Mysteries, I shall discern good and evil, expound the precious chapters of ritual recitation, and reveal the scripture’s essential purport.

The statutes of the lofty heavens are stern and severe, ever abiding in serene rosy clouds. To ascend their tiers, one must traverse beneath a canopy of mysterious clouds, guarded by flying dragons and celestial soldiers and feathered cavalry, who never rest day or night. Adorned with lapis lazuli, pearls, and jade, their radiance blazes brilliantly. Unless one is a Perfected of the Highest Realm, one cannot gaze upon these palace walls.

To delve into the empty and mysterious, to chew upon the flying roots, and to expound the precious chapters—nothing compares to purification and thanksgiving. And of all purifications and thanksgivings, none surpass the Supreme Clarity Cavernous Mystery’s rites of incense-burning, lamp-lighting, and ritual recitation.

The method of lamp-lighting requires spacing lamps at intervals of one *zhang* and five *chi*. Ten lamps are placed upon poles, and their purport is proclaimed aloud. The essential principle of the multitude of lamps is that a thousand lamps arrayed in order manifest solemnity, their number and sincerity a matter of intent.

The luminous lamps above symbolize the stars, and next they illumine the Seven Ancestors. Their subtlety is beyond expression. Cultivating this for three years, one may ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The method of lamp-veneration begins by facing east, then west, then south, then north. Then, gazing upward to the celestial center, one venerates the center while reciting the true scripture. Those in the purification assembly chant the praises, and afterward, they arrange the incense and flames with reverence. Before the clouds disperse, one must not allow the smoke to cease.

This method is widely embraced, delivering beings from the suffering of dark nights and absolving the calamities of life and death. Devout disciples and those who look upward in faith—when their households are afflicted by misfortune or they urgently wish to establish purification rites for their own deliverance—should offer fine incense and pure oil, with weights and measures according to their means, and cultivate with diligent practice.

Those who falter should contribute the incense and oil provided by the host to cover the costs of correction and to amend their transgressions.

Disciples who cultivate the Dao daily grow impatient, expecting swift results, yet the response is slow. They then deem the Dao distant and empty, lamenting, “What can be done about fate?” If one cannot transcend the boundaries and scale the peaks, how can the Seven Ancestors descend with blessings?

If one retreats and fails to gather like-minded companions at home for purification rites and scriptural recitation, instead constantly racing about in frantic pursuit, amusing oneself with wine and song, one betrays the mysterious teachings above and falls into the abyss of ancestral transgressions. Slaughtering the three sacrificial animals to fulfill filial piety—alas, how grievous! It pains my heart.

When fortune wanes and misfortune waxes, one blames the gods and the directions, praying to the void. This is like digging a well when already parched—what can be done? The suffering of the dead and the torment of pain extend to later generations. Even the hunger and illness of descendants stem from the failure of the present life to perform good deeds, surrendering to capricious thoughts and indulging in malice. Such are the consequences.

Foolish and obstinate men hear compassionate admonitions like the cry of the phoenix in the sky or the flight of the wild goose, and they laugh like dogs. How lamentable! They do not believe in what is taught.

If you wish to prolong your years and abide forever, to dispel calamities and cure illness, to cultivate great virtue and seek the utmost truth, to release the Seven Mysteries, you should know the Supreme Clarity’s great precepts on the retribution of good and evil deeds. Combine this with ritual recitation, and then calamities may be averted, and the luminous Han may be ascended.

The method of lamp-veneration is simply to recite the incantations and prayers. There is no prohibition against rigorous and resolute practice.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One said: When venerating the Lamp King or performing the lamp procession, recite the following hymn:

**Hymn:**

O vast is the Seven Treasures Palace,
Spontaneously born of the lotus!
Resplendent, it opens the night’s radiance,
Swiftly ascending the Great Rosy Clouds.
Gazing upward at the mysterious true gates,
Cloud towers rise in towering majesty.
Flowing brilliance illumines the mysterious void,
Urging the troops to conquer the myriad demons.
Delivering from suffering and the snares of calamity,
After kalpas bound in infancy,
Purification rites ferry the Seven Ancestors,
Accumulating blessings to moisten the disciple’s house.

Supremely wondrous, it emits divine radiance,
Formless, silent, and without shadow.
Beyond the boundaries, without limit,
Vastly and universally it saves all.
Lifting and delivering from the Seven Mysteries’ suffering,
In boundless emptiness, one beholds eternal stillness.
Delivering from the five obstructions and stagnations,
Responding to karmic signs, one rides the clouds above.
The luminous lamp penetrates the ten directions,
No darkness remains unillumined.

Resplendent is the mysterious true hall,
Its brilliance shining through the ten directions.
Vast and open, it dispels the depths of obstruction,
Releasing the bodies of all in difficulty.
The Seven Ancestors and the Three Wretched Realms are freed,
No more sorrow or affliction remains.
Green canopies reflect the ten directions,
Soaring and parting the waves of clouds.
The divine lamp suffuses the Nine Netherworlds,
Its candlelight brightening the mountain valleys.
The pure body abides in the Six Assemblies’ Palace,
Lifetimes become those of immortals.
Empty smoke and all karmic conditions,
Fortune descends to dispel the myriad demons.
Suffering souls respond and disperse,
Like ice melting in flowing sands.

Accumulated misfortunes do not cease of themselves—
How could they be the fault of a single day?
The Seven Ancestors suffer these calamities,
Ever abiding between rivers and seas.
The Perfected Ones, moved by this suffering,
Empty their hearts before the ninefold gates.
Bowing their heads, they venerate the mysterious lamp,
Inscribing their names in the Eastern Florescence Palace.

Upon concluding the rites to the King, proceed with the recitation of the nineteen Lamp Hymns, as follows:

A thousand Perfected Ones ascend the Jasper Towers,
Resplendent, piercing the cavernous void.
Gazing upward to the Venerable One of Non-Action,
Rosy clouds play amidst the heavens,
In purity and stillness, no hindrance remains,
The body radiates the light of the Seven Treasures.

I serve as the helmsman of the sea-vessel,
Thus able to release the Three Bonds.
The night’s glow illumines the hidden valleys,
The suffering body is cleansed and opened,
Empty smoke disperses to the eight directions,
Bright illumination enters the Grand Tenuity.
Reciting the supreme teachings,
Fortune and blessings are truly majestic.

Drifting, drifting, weaving through the open paths,
Silent, silent, filling the eight mounds.
From the Three Qin, cloud-shadows arise,
In emptiness, the Two Great Origins pair.
Gazing through the ten directions,
Freely dispersing the suffering form.

The flying wheel suffuses the vast sky,
Without form, without trace.
Soaring over Luoyang with the wheel’s flight,
Whistling beyond the boundaries,
Clad in coarse robes, chanting the night’s glow,
All heavens surpass the great.

Fortune and misfortune arise not from others,
Their measure lies within your own self.
If merit is not accumulated early,
Day and night, cultivate the field of blessings.
Return your life to the Dao of Non-Action,
And in the end, you shall behold the True Perfected.

Resplendent, the radiant light shines,
Bright and clear, with no hidden depths.
Glorious beyond the darkest nether,
Fortune descends, and blessings accumulate.
In orderly ranks, observing the ten directions,
Universally aiding all beings.

I adorn my reins of Mystic Perfection,
Hand in hand, lifting the jade tally.
The bright lamp strikes the jasper bell,
The echoing response is already attained.
In a single day, I see the Three Attainments,
Releasing my accumulated sorrows of lifetimes.

Transferred to the Palace of Seven Treasures,
The wheel turns along the winding mountain valleys.
Halting the carriage in the chamber of the green canopy,
Who knows how many years have passed?
Sipping the essence of golden liquid,
After ten thousand kalpas, I am but an infant in the register.
Looking down upon the world of striving and competition,
I know not what to make of it.

The mysterious radiance illumines the winding valleys,
Bright and clear, piercing the abyssal springs.
Flowing brilliance intertwines in lush profusion,
Encircling and filling Mount Feng.
The Seven Ancestors return to womb-life,
Abiding forever in the Five-Colored Palace.

Lush and misty, the empty sky glows,
Vigorous and surging, entering the Grand Purity.
Heavenly huntsmen and attendants on left and right,
The wheel turns toward the southern inclination.
Beyond the nine years of illusion,
Momentarily transcending the stone’s awakening spirit.
The Seven Ancestors attain womb-immortality,
Reborn in the Southern Palace.

The flying wheel suffuses the empty cavern,
Gazing down a thousand, ten thousand fathoms.
With a single stroke of insight,
Gathered smoke instantly scatters.
The body is light, the form is Non-Action,
The four directions brighten in response to the scene.
The hells and the Three Evil Paths,
All escape their bonds and fetters.

Whistling and singing on the Ninefold Mystery Terrace,
Lofty peaks congeal in solemn stillness.
The mind and the six senses flow freely,
Naturally abandoning the dust and defilement.
Rosy clouds illuminate the golden chamber,
The empty hall scatters the mysterious radiance.
Accumulated resonance summons the descent of spirits,
Though the form is solitary, the Dao is also divided.
In an instant, gazing across ten thousand kalpas,
Who perceives the passing of countless eons?

The verdant garden flourishes with divine steps,
Crimson jasper weaves through the flowing jade.
The wind stirs the empty sky’s jade,
The perching phoenix sings in the void.
Purple mist coils through the winding halls,
Cinnabar radiance encircles the green carriage.

Flying banners flourish with the mysterious canopy,
Feathered standards gleam in the Purple Clarity.
The limpid scene at the edge of the nine skies,
Roaming and playing in the Phoenix City.
Looking back at the striving mortals,
One joy is shared with those of the morning’s birth.

Reining the soaring radiance,
The tranquil scene stretches beyond the wilds.
Wandering in search of the numinous ones,
Uniting forms in celebration at the edge of the sky.
Pushing open the vermilion jade gates,
Bright as the divine surge of peace.

The golden towers rise in towering splendor,
Their pure shadows free of dust and defilement.
Unfurling the banners on the Mystic Loft Terrace,
Fulfilling my deepest wishes.
Shedding the difficulties of the Three Paths,
Preserving and refining to secure old age.

Wisdom arises from the root of Non-Being,
Bright and clear, transcending the ten directions.
Weaving emptiness to stand in the Mystic Empyrean,
All heavens draw from the flowing fragrance.
Its wonder is beyond thought and discussion,
Empty resonance truly connects.
Being is not being, non-being is not without,
Non-being and non-without encompass all.

Wisdom constantly observes the self,
The first step in learning the Dao.
Subtly entering the Mystic Workshop,
Naturally recording my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy always protects and shelters,
The Demon King offers his pledge.
Resplendent, the Vajra body,
Transcendent, the Supreme Immortal.

Wisdom generates the root of precepts,
The true Dao takes precepts as its master.
The Three Treasures arise from this,
Venerated and transmitted by the lofty sages.
Sailing this deathless vessel,
In an instant, crossing the great expanse.
At this moment of expounding the precepts,
All immortals come to bow their heads.

**Hymn of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity at the Time of Receiving Precepts**

Whenever lighting lamps, one should recite this text—not only when receiving precepts and lighting lamps.

Gently knock the teeth, making no sound for others to hear. All teeth are ears.

The Supreme One scatters to the ten directions,
Flower lamps convey sincerity.
All heavens blaze resplendently,
All earths are bright and clear.
My body, too, is luminous,
The five viscera bloom with splendor.
The blazing scene illumines the Great Non-Being,
Distant thoughts flourish in the Jade Clarity.

Cinnabar essence marvels at the Great Non-Being,
The mysterious yang resounds in the empty sky.
Embracing form, eradicating the roots of suffering,
Subtle and wondrous, the thought of the True Perfected.
Hanging blossoms do not reveal their treasure,
Causes and conditions do not manifest light.
My body is likewise,
Riding transformation, entrusting to the flowing scene.

The night’s glow manifests the yang cinnabar,
Far and bright, illuminating the numinous chamber.
All heavens universally shine,
All yin is already extinguished.
My spirit, too, is keen and bright,
Ever delighting in wisdom and insight.
Freely adapting to the Dao’s movement,
Changing and yielding to heaven’s power.
Raising the form to tread the empty cavern,
The night’s candle blazes with flowing brilliance.

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity says: Lighting lamps without reciting this text allows the Great Demon Mansion of the Six Heavens to cut short human lives. The jade lads and jade maidens of the eight directions’ heavens will not be sent to you. Flying celestial spirits will not descend upon you. The ten directions and three realms will not inscribe your name in the Eastern Florescence or Southern Palace. Your Seven Ancestors and parents will not receive the Dao of transformation and rebirth.

**Incantation for Offering Food to Sentient Beings**

Diligently cultivate the great Daoist methods,
Sincerity moves the Grand Obscurity.
The true descends, demonic illusions scatter,
All demons vanish in form.
The Seven Ancestors cross to the Southern Palace,
Your own body ascends to the Highest Clarity.
Since blessings are universally bestowed,
Offer the Dharma-food to all sentient beings.

**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery’s Bright Lamp concludes.**
