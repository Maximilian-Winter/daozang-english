### **The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Causation**
**Fascicle One**
**The Chapter on Universal Salvation (First)**

The Great Compassionate and Universally Salvific Perfected One, regarding the causes and conditions of karmic retribution, inquired of the Supreme.

At that time, the Supreme Lord of the Dao was in the Heaven of Blessed Virtue, within the Fragrant Accumulation World, seated upon a luminous seven-jeweled dais, expounding the Great Teaching to a vast assembly.

Then the Universally Salvific Perfected One approached and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "For immeasurable kalpas, I have attended upon the Most Compassionate One, yet never have I seen the Merciful Venerable One so joyful as today, bestowing the Great Dharma like clouds, pouring the Great Dharma like rain, enabling all present to attain understanding and awakening, each receiving inconceivable benefits according to their capacity.

I humbly beseech your divine power to reveal the boundless worlds’ causes and conditions of good and evil, illuminating the future so that all may know the affairs of past lives, the three temporal realms—past, present, and future."

Having spoken thus, he prostrated himself upon the ground, gazing upward to behold the Merciful Countenance.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Universally Salvific One: "You have now aroused such a vow, generating a mind of great goodness to benefit all beings in ways beyond conception.

In response to this cause and condition, the Heavenly Worthy emitted a nine-colored radiance, penetrating through the heavens of a hundred million worlds, even to the boundless lands below. Through divine transformation, all was revealed without obstruction, as clear as if held in the palm of the hand.

The Universally Salvific One and the great assembly, borne by this majestic light, beheld the causes and conditions of good and evil across all heavens and earths, both inner and outer realms fully displayed. Above the heavens, they saw the host of sages at play.

Next, they saw below the heavens, down to the various earths, the suffering beings enduring punishment, each distinction made manifest for the future.

Above the heavens, they beheld Great Sages and Lofty Perfected Ones, their necks bearing luminous orbs, their bodily marks complete, transforming at will, assuming forms great or small as they pleased: some riding upon light through the void, some mounting dragons or cranes; some soaring on clouds or treading the empty sky, borne by simurgh-drawn chariots or phoenix-canopied carriages. Countless Flying Immortals, Heavenly Immortals, Divine Immortals, and Numinous Beings roamed freely, their bodies suffused with light, their divine powers unobstructed.

They saw heavenly men and heavenly women, jade lads and jade maidens, their numbers beyond reckoning. They saw phoenixes and peacocks, lions and apotropaic beasts, standing guard to left and right.

Above the heavens, they beheld such realms of blessed virtue, places of joy and freedom. Again, they saw such palaces and flowers, fruits, and myriad offerings beyond description.

Below the heavens, they saw the Great Sages of the heavens riding clouds and traversing the void, bearing banners and holding regalia as they inspected the registers of sentient beings’ transgressions. They saw the Divine Immortals and Sages of the heavens manifesting in various forms—noble or base, poor or rich, sick or robust, male or female, old or young, large or small, tall or short—assuming all manner of guises to descend into the human realm and teach and transform all beings.

Now beholding all these conditions across the heavens and the earth, they saw how causes and karmic retribution differed. They wondered: *What cultivation in past lives led to this present existence? What transgressions were committed to incur this fate? What virtues in past lives brought blessings, and what sins in this life brought suffering? Is this the result of natural endowment, karmic retribution, the influence of land and water, or the legacy of one’s parents? Is this the consequence of one’s own actions, the seeds sown in past lives, the sins of one individual, or the misfortunes passed to descendants? Can one be delivered through the cultivation of goodness, or is this fate immutable?*

They entreated the Heavenly Worthy in great compassion to bestow enlightenment, that all beings might awaken to the causes of their past lives.

The Dao Lord replied: *"Excellent, excellent! You have aroused such profound aspiration, opening the gateway to the benefit of all dharmas, awakening sentient beings to the causes of their past lives—this is beyond the reach of thought. Now listen well, and I shall expound these matters for you."*

**The Second Scroll of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Karmic Retribution and Causes**
**Chapter Two: The Discourse on Virtuous Responses**

The Greatly Compassionate and Universally Salvific Perfected One, having inquired about karmic retribution and its causes, addressed the Supreme Dao Lord.

Then, the Supreme Dao Lord spoke to the Universally Salvific One: *"If there are good men and good women who widely create scriptures and images, establish temples to deliver others, practice almsgiving and fasting, rescue the dead and deliver the living, universally save all beings, and make great vows to cultivate vast fields of merit, their roots of goodness unbroken and benefiting all beings, they shall be reborn as kings of heavenly realms. Those who uphold fasts and precepts, recite scriptures and pay homage, meditate upon the true forms of the Dao, burn incense and worship the Three Treasures and the Great Dao, and widely cultivate fields of merit shall be reborn as queens or mothers of nations. Those who make offerings to the Three Treasures, burn incense and light lamps without wearying, and create scriptures and cast images shall be reborn as attendants in the courts of heavenly kings. Those who believe in and delight in the scriptures and dharmas, follow the regulations and practice them, uphold fasts and contemplate the Dao, and give alms to establish merit shall be reborn with wealth, wisdom, and dignified beauty. Those who uphold the scriptures and precepts and maintain recitation and devotion shall be reborn with intelligence and noble distinction. Those who for seven generations have delighted in the Dao and upheld the precepts, recited scriptures, given alms to relieve the poor, delivered the living and the dead, constantly practiced compassion, and made offerings to the Three Treasures without weariness shall be reborn as those who leave the household life. Those who in lifetime after lifetime have accumulated goodness, widely cultivated fields of merit, upheld fasts and precepts, revered the Three Treasures, recited and contemplated the Great Vehicle, refined their conduct, and never violated the precepts shall be reborn as great virtuous Dharma masters. Those who are revered by all, generation after generation, who take refuge in and honor the Three Treasures, deeply cherish the Great Dharma, and cultivate offerings shall be reborn among heavenly beings, their present lives pure, long, and prosperous. Those who make offerings to the Three Treasures and the Dharma bodies of those who have left the household life shall be reborn with long life and dignified beauty. Those who establish monasteries and build numinous altars shall be reborn with great wealth and nobility. Those who revere and believe in the Great Dao of the Heavenly Worthy and meditate with devoted hearts shall be reborn with fully realized Dharma-nature. Those who believe in and uphold the scriptures and precepts without dualistic thoughts, who attain the knowledge of past lives and understand karmic causes, shall be reborn with nobility and beloved by all. Those who revere the Three Treasures, delight in almsgiving, relieve the poor and needy, accomplish merit, and spare nothing shall be reborn in the Central Kingdom with long life, wealth, and nobility. Those who do not kill, steal, or indulge in wine, meat, or excessive food shall be reborn with long life and completeness. Those who delight in reciting scriptures and uphold the Dao with perpetual fasting shall be reborn as those who leave the household life with reverence and faith."*

Those who make offerings to monastic masters and virtue, and revere the Dharma-body of the Three Treasures in all its forms, shall be reborn with a pure and upright body. Those who constantly pity all beings and show compassion to the lowliest creatures shall be reborn as the highest nobility. Those who are emperors or kings in this life have, over countless kalpas, practiced fasting and upheld the precepts, widely sowed fields of merit, refrained from anger and hatred, and over many kalpas and lives, established grand fasts and jiao rituals to deliver all sentient beings of the Dharma-realm. After the end of their lives, they shall be reborn in the joyous heavenly palaces, their bodies adorned with celestial robes, and partake of natural blessings. From kalpa to kalpa, when their heavenly blessings are exhausted, they shall descend to the human realm and be born into imperial households, thus returning from such fields of merit.

If good men and good women widely cultivate fields of merit, make offerings to the Heavenly Worthy and the lofty perfected of the Great Dao, and perform such manifold acts of merit for immeasurable kalpas, they shall be reborn in this life as empresses or queen mothers. Those who are imperial princes, royal descendants, princesses, or royal consorts arise from the cultivation of goodness and the sowing of karmic causes over many kalpas. Those who enjoy long life and old age arise from upholding fasts and precepts and showing compassion to deliver sentient beings. Those with flourishing descendants and long life in wealth and nobility arise from making offerings to the Heavenly Worthy and the Great Dao. Those whose fathers and sons, husbands and wives, men and women constantly dwell together arise from gentleness, compliance, and harmony. Those who are never separated arise from mutual affection. Those who are revered and provided with sweet and delicious food wherever they go arise from cultivating permanent fields of merit. Those who are noble, honored, and feared by all arise from revering and believing in the Three Treasures. Those who enjoy wealth and abundance arise from almsgiving, fasting, cultivating fields of merit, and relieving the poor. Those who surpass others in wisdom and intelligence arise from reciting scriptures and upholding the Dharma. Those with upright and proper appearances arise from making offerings to the monastic Dharma-bodies of the Three Treasures.

If there are pure men and women or monastic Dharma-bodies who are revered by others, they arise from expounding the Dharma, teaching and transforming, upholding fasts and precepts, and cultivating manifold fields of merit. Those whose nobility and wealth remain unshaken for eternal kalpas arise from the accomplishment of almsgiving and permanent fields of merit. Those who are respected wherever they go and beloved by the noble arise from almsgiving, upholding scriptures, and observing precepts. Those with pure bodies and minds and keen wisdom arise from protecting and upholding the Great Vehicle of the Three Caverns.

Those whose bodies are fragrant and pure, beloved by all, arise from abstaining from wine, meat, and pungent foods, and constantly maintaining purity. Those with numerous descendants and perfect wealth and nobility arise from widely practicing almsgiving, repairing bridges, and performing manifold acts of merit.

Women who give birth to healthy and noble children, cherished by their husbands, arise from conducting Daoist rituals and teaching with faith. Those who are elegant and refined in this life arise from praising and chanting in Daoist rituals and revering the Three Treasures. Those who enjoy happiness and natural blessings in this life arise from single-mindedly and sincerely listening to the Dharma and reciting scriptures in Daoist rituals. Those with upright appearances, gentle speech, reverent conduct, and beloved by all arise from making offerings to monastic Dharma-bodies and upholding scriptures and precepts. Those whose clothing and food are abundant, who constantly receive offerings of monastic robes, and adorn themselves with treasures arise from bestowing monastic robes upon virtuous Dharma-masters.

Thus, all these are the retributions of the deeds sown in this life or by ancestral lineages, resulting in the rewards of the present body. Some sow goodness in one lifetime and receive retribution in this very life. It is essential to universally instruct men and women, enabling them to recognize the good affinities of past lives and attain immeasurable blessings.

**Chapter Three: Retributions of Evil**

Then, the Most High Lord of the Dao addressed Universal Salvation and all the assembled perfected ones, saying: From now on, if any sentient being destroys or defaces the images of the Heavenly Worthy and the Great Dao, they shall, upon death, enter the Nine Dark and Eighteen Hells of the Underworld, suffering for ten thousand kalpas. Only after their suffering is exhausted shall they be reborn among humans, afflicted with swelling and leprosy, their bodies covered in pus and blood, foul and stinking, abhorred by all.

All these are the transgressions committed in this life; after death, one falls into hell, endures various punishments, and is then reborn in these forms. Some receive such retribution in this very life and are reborn in these bodies, all due to the transgressions committed in previous lives. Pǔjì, you must wholeheartedly believe and uphold these teachings, clearly instructing future generations so that all men and women may recognize these evil deeds.

**The Fourth Category of Retributions**

The Most High further addressed Puji, saying: The causes and conditions of suffering in hell enable the men and women of this world to recognize their sins and blessings, turn toward the true and upright, forever sever the three karmic actions, and purify the six senses. Thus, he spoke in verse:

In this life, lacking reverence and faith,
Destroying the true forms of the Dao,
The exalted sages and immortals,
The numinous and divine beings,
The jade lads and jade maidens,
The vajra and the mighty warriors,
The guardian deities of majestic might,
All the various forms and images—
Those who damage and disdain them,
Defile and disrespect them,
Commit lewd acts and mock them,
Act arrogantly and insolently,
Criticize and debate the sutras and dharma,
Forcefully assert right and wrong,
Break fasts and violate precepts,
Steal and covet wealth—
All such acts of irreverence and disbelief
Lead to death and entry into the Nine Dark Hells,
Where they endure the eighteen realms of suffering:
Walking barefoot upon mountains of knives,
Clinging with both hands to trees of swords,
Embracing naked the bronze pillars,
Lying unclothed upon iron beds,
Wearing mountains of fire upon their heads,
Constantly bearing iron rods upon their backs.
Hungry, they eat burning coals;
Thirsty, they drink molten bronze.
Boiled in cauldrons of seething broth,
Their bodies scorched by fire chariots,
Pounded by pestles and ground by mills,
Hung upside down and drained of blood,
Sawn apart and subjected to blade punishments,
Their limbs and joints pierced by needle points,
Crushed by boulders pressing upon their bodies,
Their sinews and bones severed by freezing ice.
Scurrying through burning embers,
Leaping and bounding without respite,
Dwelling in perpetually foul and stinking places,
Drawing water from dark and swirling waves
To pour into the four great rivers.
Fierce birds contend to peck out their eyes,
Bronze dogs come to gnaw at their flesh,
Venomous snakes vie to devour them,
Ox-headed demons break their spines.
In a single day, they die and are reborn ten thousand times,
Their suffering unbearable,
Only to emerge after ten thousand kalpas.

Those who broke fasts in past lives are reborn as hungry ghosts, their hunger fed by raging flames; in later lives, they suffer from choking sickness, their bodies festering with pus and blood. Those who violated sutras and precepts descend into the Needle and Blade Hell, their bodies pierced from left to right, enduring unbearable agony; in later lives, they are afflicted with chronic illness, longing for death yet unable to die. Those who stole from fasts or offerings plunge into cauldrons of boiling broth, their flesh and bones dissolving in ceaseless torment; in later lives, they endure poverty, never having enough food or clothing. Those who stole wealth fall into the Blade Mountain Hell, their bodies sliced apart, their limbs severed joint by joint; in later lives, they are stricken with leprosy, shunned by all. Those who mocked the Three Treasures suffer molten bronze poured down their throats, their joints aflame, their forms charred and rotting; in later lives, they are born incomplete, plagued by the six afflictions. Those who lacked reverence and faith enter the Sword Tree Hell, their hands and feet severed inch by inch, their torment unrelenting, pain piercing bone and marrow; in later lives, they are born foolish and dull. Those who acted with arrogance, deceiving and mocking the Three Treasures, descend into the Fire Chariot Hell, their bodies scorched and ravaged; in later lives, they are born hideous, despised wherever they go. Those who used their tongues to slander monastics, committing adultery or deceit, fall into the Hell of Unrelenting Torment, their tongues plowed by iron plows; in later lives, they are reborn in filth, as maggots in latrines or as swine and dogs. Those who destroyed scriptures and teachings are beaten with iron rods day and night, their bodies drenched in blood; in later lives, they are born without noses or tongues, despised by all.

Those who killed living beings—cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, dogs, geese, ducks, pheasants, rabbits, roe deer, stags, tigers, leopards, owls, crows, swallows, sparrows, jackals, wolves, foxes, raccoon dogs, yaks, mules, donkeys, horses, fish, soft-shelled turtles, alligators, eels, snails, clams, shrimp, mussels, centipedes, millipedes, dung beetles, mole crickets, ants, leeches, water bugs, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, pill bugs, slugs, silkworms, bears, panthers, lions, gibbons, monkeys, and all creatures that fly or walk—without a heart of compassion, slaughtering whatever they encountered, descend into the various hells, enduring every torment, their suffering unending. Each day, they die and are reborn ten thousand times, their pain unbearable. The very creatures they killed—cattle, sheep, and others—come to demand their lives, crying, *"You ate my flesh!"* or *"You killed me!"* With no escape, they are seized, forced to repay their debts. The demon kings consult their ledgers of sins, verifying each transgression, and one by one, they exact repayment, trapping the offenders for ten thousand kalpas. In later lives, they are reborn as cattle, pigs, sheep, or even geese and ducks, slaughtered at will to repay their past sins, like seeds sown to yield their harvest.

Those who committed theft, stealing from the Three Treasures, offerings, or the possessions of parents, children, devas, or common folk—anything not their own—nurturing thieving hearts and persistently wicked deeds, robbing travelers, threatening lives, breaking through walls, plundering by day or night, lurking in shadows, seizing cattle, sheep, servants, wealth, jewels, silks, fabrics, carpets, clothing, utensils, provisions, fruits, vegetables, grains, threads, or even a single hair, measuring their spoils by the sheng or dou, all stolen through cunning—fall into the Fire Chariot Hell, their bodies scorched and tormented. In later lives, they are reborn as oxen or horses, repaying their debts to others, their necks pierced, their backs flayed, their nostrils and flesh torn, enduring hunger and thirst, unable to speak, slaughtered at will to atone for their theft.

Those who indulged in illicit lust, unrestrained and boundless, seducing the wives and concubines of others, tearing families apart, engaging in incest with relatives, even with monastics or livestock, using hands or objects to arouse desire, heedless of good or evil, defiling sacred grounds, temples, altars, places near scriptures or images, exposing themselves beneath heaven and earth, under the sun, moon, and stars, disrespecting gods and spirits, in mountains, marshes, shrines, or temples, giving free rein to their desires—fall into the Nine Dark Hells. Men embrace burning bronze pillars, women lie upon searing iron beds, their bodies engulfed in flames, their flesh and fat charred, their joints shattered. They are boiled in cauldrons, beaten with iron rods day and night, then cast into the Hell of Freezing Ice, their bodies torn apart, pounded, ground, sawn, crushed, and hacked. Later, they are reborn in filth, as maggots in latrines or as swine and dogs, wallowing in foulness. Even if reborn as humans, they suffer madness, deformity, foolishness, ugliness, loneliness, poverty, and are shunned by all.

Those who were miserly and greedy, hoarding wealth like mountains, their hearts swallowing rivers and seas, never satisfied, refusing to give even a hair’s worth at fasts, precept ceremonies, image-making, scripture-copying, temple construction, incense offerings, or lamp-lighting—any meritorious act—always scheming for profit, descend into the Hell of Freezing Ice, their bodies frozen and shattered, their joints broken. In later lives, they are born among barbarians, as slaves or servants, or as cattle, sheep, camels, mules, donkeys, or horses, burdened with heavy loads, their necks pierced, their flesh torn, toiling endlessly, hunger and thirst their constant companions, their bodies devoured by others after death. For ten thousand kalpas, they are reborn incomplete—hands crippled, feet lame, eyes blind, ears deaf, noses flattened, mouths twisted, chests protruding, spines bent, their forms hideous, pitied by none.

Those who in life harbor much wrath and anger, their hearts ever poisoned with malice, their minds constantly oppressed—whether raging at men or women, beasts or servants—torment themselves with ceaseless fury. Wielding knives or cudgels, they seek only to harm living things, their resentment unabated, their hatred never yielding even a moment’s joy. At death, they descend into the Hell of Needle Peaks, their bodies pierced from left to right, needles driven through heart and liver, intestines and flanks, blood flowing without measure. In later lives, they are reborn as toads, their eyes bulging yet unable to speak, or as pufferfish and stingrays, glaring upon the water’s surface, only to be seized by hawks and kites, their flesh torn and devoured. Should they be reborn among humans, they still bear the retribution of folly—ugly and clumsy, their words unskillful, their speech ever offending others, met with no pity or affection.

Those who in former lives were ever foolish, disbelieving in the causes of sin and blessing, mocking others’ meritorious deeds, claiming there is no past or future life, showing no reverence for sun and moon, heaven and earth, or the stars, scorning all spirits and gods, persistently committing evil, their deeds wholly wicked—at death, they enter the eighteen hells, enduring every torment. For ten thousand kalpas, they are reborn as serpents, their hearts filled with venom, their bellies devoid of organs, hunger and thirst unrelieved, all who see them seeking to kill. Should they be reborn among humans, they still bear the retribution of dull-wittedness.

Those who in past lives indulged in frivolous speech and falsehoods, deceiving before the Three Treasures, parents, men and women, kings and commoners—wherever gatherings occurred, they sowed discord, slandered the loyal and good, severed friendships, envied and resented those superior to themselves, spreading rumors and strife, turning falsehoods into truths, white into black, speaking ill of others’ faults, pretending knowledge of right and wrong, their lives marked by ruin—at death, they enter the Hell of Tongue-Ripping, their mouths pierced by iron awls, their bodies crushed by stones, forced to consume foul filth, their tongues stretched a hundred feet, nailed in place, blood dripping endlessly. In later lives, they are reborn as dogs, feeding on foulness, sleepless day and night, ever barking in guard, or should they be reborn among humans, mute or stammering.

Those who in former lives wielded vicious tongues, cursing kin and stranger alike, sparing no one with their words, whatever vile speech arose from their mouths—comparing others to beasts, swine, or dogs, to worms, vipers, or scorpions, to all manner of foul creatures—calling upon heaven and earth, invoking ghosts and gods, even the Three Treasures, sun, moon, and stars; uttering curses and malevolent prayers, inscribing names or drawing images, molding clay or carving wood, tying colored threads or painting likenesses, using nails, hair, or clothing, defiling wells, hearths, flowing water, doorways, roads, sacred groves, altars, or places where carriages pass and dogs bark—directing their malice toward the loyal and good, kings and ministers, nobles and officials, parents, wives, and children, servants and concubines, sparing none regardless of rank, their venomous words met with universal disdain—at death, molten copper is poured down their throats, their bodies smoking from every pore. In later lives, they are reborn as wasps, venomous insects, vipers, scorpions, centipedes, or millipedes; or as snails and clams, their tails bearing poison, ever seeking to harm, yet unable to speak, shunned by all, retreating into their shells. Should they be reborn among humans, they remain mute or stammering.

Those who in past lives indulged in mockery and jest, teasing and provoking others—at death, iron birds peck out their eyes, blood streaming from nose and mouth, their agony unbearable. In later lives, they are reborn as hares, their lips cleft and unable to speak, pursued by all, seized by hawks and hounds. Should they be reborn among humans, they remain mute.

Those who in former lives craved wine and meat, consuming the five pungent roots, entering monastic halls, approaching scriptures and images, defiling monastics, wandering through pure lands, sacred precincts, and divine temples; heedless of sin and blessing, drunken and reckless, showing no respect for high or low, spewing vile words and curses at the Three Treasures; or within heaven and earth, among humans, ghosts, and spirits, parents, men and women, spreading slander and discord—at death, they enter the Hell of Filth, its stench unbearable, suffering for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth, their forms ever vile, becoming worms in latrines, their bodies wholly impure, or as dung beetles, flies, maggots, swine, or dogs, or as millipedes, loathed by all. Should they be reborn among humans, their appearance remains hideous, their bodies foul and stinking, rank as foxes, their teeth uneven, their faces swollen and festering, met with disgust wherever they go, shunned by men and women alike.

Those who in past lives defaulted on debts, refusing to repay what they borrowed, abusing power to oppress others—at death, they enter the Hell of Inverted Suspension, or the Hell of Dripping Blood, their suffering enduring for ten thousand kalpas. In later lives, they are reborn as mules or donkeys, or as sickly dogs, or as oxen and horses, burdened with toil and hardship.

Those who in former lives defied the teachings, creating their own doctrines, abandoning their roots and disrespecting their teachers, deceiving both wise and foolish—at death, they enter the Great Hell, enduring every torment, blades piercing their hearts, iron awls rending their tongues, their joints nailed with iron spikes. In later lives, they are reborn as geese or ducks, or as fish and turtles, slaughtered without protest, their lives at the mercy of others. Should they be reborn among humans, they remain dull, deaf, or mute.

Those who in past lives disbelieved in goodness, seizing what belonged to the monastic community—even a thread or a hair, fruits, vegetables, rice, or wheat—at death, they enter the eighteen hells, enduring every suffering.

Those reborn among starving tigers never know fullness;
should they regain human form, they perish by water, fire, blade, or war,
or suffer chronic illness—madness, epilepsy, or convulsions.

Those who in past lives showed no reverence,
consuming the Three Treasures’ goods—
rice, wheat, fruits, or vegetables,
taking two grains where one was given,
whatever passed their lips, regardless of amount—
at death enter the Molten Copper Hell,
where hunger forces them to swallow iron pellets,
thirst compels them to drink molten bronze;
or they are reborn as hungry ghosts,
forever denied food,
their joints aflame,
fine meals transformed to fire.
Later born as starving dogs,
even if they regain human form,
they live in poverty, lacking food and clothing,
or serve as slaves and bondservants,
or endure the toils of the six livestock,
suffering without respite, day and night.

Those who in former lives lacked compassion,
resenting the poor and destitute,
prisoners, women in childbirth, the aged, and the sick,
feeling no kindness toward them—
at death enter the Flowing Sands Hell,
trapped for ten thousand kalpas;
later reborn among fish and turtles,
and even if they regain human form,
they remain poor and destitute.

Those who in past lives flew hawks and hounds,
burned mountains and drained marshes,
spread nets to exhaust rivers and lakes,
ripped open wombs and crushed eggs,
even to ants, tadpoles, earthworms,
silkworms, and chrysalises—
all creatures born of womb, egg, transformation, or moisture—
all suffered injury and slaughter.
At death they enter the Embers Hell,
unable to escape east or west,
their bodies charred and rotting;
later born in borderland tribes,
constantly hacked and shot by blades and arrows,
or as birds and beasts,
again subjected to wounding and dismemberment.

Those who in former lives disrespected the Dharma,
sharing bed and mat with their teachers—
at death they enter the Gushing Spring Hell,
or the Frozen Ice Hell,
or the Spike Peak Hell,
their bodies racked with pain,
pus and blood streaming from every pore;
later born as gibbons and monkeys,
their forms incomplete.

Those who in past lives saw the Three Treasures
yet remained arrogant and irreverent,
sitting, lying, or standing upon sacred images,
their hearts filled with contempt—
at death endure iron rod beatings,
day and night without rest,
later reborn as beasts,
constantly maimed and mutilated by humans;
even if they regain human form,
their hands and feet are crippled and twisted,
their waists bent, their backs hunched,
their chests protruding, their spines crooked,
blind in both eyes, mute and speechless,
deaf or with blocked noses.

The karmic deeds of beings are boundless,
their retributions likewise endless,
each arising from their own past actions,
not received from others.
In future lives, they are reborn
and again suffer according to their former causes.

Virtuous men and women of the future,
ponder well these words of mine:
sin and blessing follow like shadows,
fortune and misfortune turn like wheels.
Do good, and good reward will come;
do evil, and evil consequences will follow.
All receive their own blessings,
none escape their own deeds.

**Chapter Five: Repentance**

At that time, the Great Compassionate and Universally Salvific Perfected One, having heard the Most High Dao Lord expound the karmic retributions of good and evil, bowed in reverence with joy and addressed the Most High Dao Lord, saying: "Beings, deluded and benighted, are deeply entangled in the snares of the world. Unable to awaken, they cannot escape the midst of transgressions, drifting through the cycles of birth and death, ever abiding in suffering and affliction. I humbly beseech the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy to bestow enlightenment upon them, that future men and women may turn their hearts toward the good Dao and not fall into the Three Wretched Realms."

The Dao Lord spoke to the Universally Salvific One, saying: "If there are good men and good women who, of their own accord, generate thoughts of goodness, come before me to bow in worship, burn incense, and sincerely repent—confessing all the evil deeds they themselves have committed, as well as those of their departed ancestors, spanning hundreds of millions of generations, their past and present parents, wives, children, and kin—if they repent for all the transgressions accumulated through countless kalpas of abandoning and assuming bodies, through all the rebirths up to the present life, then their sins shall be extinguished, their bodies and minds purified, and their offenses immeasurably reduced.

If, in future times, beings—whether men or women of the present age—through countless kalpas, have harbored thoughts or acted with irreverence, slandered the Three Treasures, damaged the Three Treasures, belittled the Three Treasures, defiled the Three Treasures, mocked the Three Treasures, cursed the Three Treasures, deceived the Three Treasures, or behaved arrogantly toward the Three Treasures; or if they have disparaged scriptures, debated their authenticity, recklessly spoken of gains and losses, forcibly argued right and wrong, distinguished between profundity and shallowness, or criticized their length and brevity; if their appearance was unclean, their clothing unclean, their hands and feet unclean, their shoes unclean, or their breath foul; if they consumed wine and meat, ate pungent and rank foods, uttered filthy words, lacked reverence in their hearts, failed to wash their hands, failed to burn incense, failed to rinse their mouths, or failed to bathe before entering sacred halls or approaching the Dharma seat; if they entered ritual precincts to listen to the Dharma and recite scriptures, thereby defiling sacred images, dishonoring Perfected Sages, Immortals, Divine Persons, Jade Maidens, Jade Lads, Fragrance-Officer Messengers, Vajra Deva Kings, Heavenly Soldiers, Mighty Guardians, or Dharma-Protecting Mighties; if, before the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Dao, the Dharma, the monastic body, or Great Virtue Perfected Ones, they failed to show reverence, behaved arrogantly, and refused to bow, prostrate, or sincerely submit; if they lay down to listen to Dharma Masters or Great Virtue Perfected Ones expounding the Great Vehicle scriptures of the Three Caverns; if, reeking of wine, meat, and foul odors, they rode their carriages and horses directly into ritual precincts, approaching the Heavenly Worthy to read scriptures; if, upon seeing others observe fasts and receive precepts, they refused to believe and called it hypocrisy; if, upon witnessing the teaching and transformation of the masses, they disrupted and denounced it as heresy; if they disturbed the common people, entered ritual precincts with loud voices, and harassed the Dharma disciples; if, in speech or thought, they first debated the Three Treasures, arguing right and wrong, weighing truth and falsehood; if they relied on the Three Treasures to seek wealth by expedient means; if they falsely taught the Dharma to deceive the people; if they misused the wealth of the Three Treasures to sustain themselves; if they intimidated monastics to extract their faults and seize their property to support their wives and children; if they carried scriptures and images into markets to teach and transform; if, on roads or in gatherings, they falsely claimed merit to enrich themselves; if they rented or sold scriptures and images for profit, using the proceeds to feed themselves and their families; if they exchanged wine and meat for the sale of images, rented or sold scriptures, and relied on the Three Treasures to seek gain; if they preached from high seats, claiming to expound the Great Vehicle, yet used the offerings solely for themselves; if, without studying scriptures, precepts, talismans, or ritual texts, they set themselves up as teachers and accepted offerings; if they widely recruited disciples without discerning their worthiness, transmitted precepts and talismans, and leaked sacred secrets; if they did not follow the regulations and instructions of their masters, but acted on their own whims, altering scriptures and precepts; if they left sacred images exposed, allowing dust to damage them; if they allowed buildings to collapse and scriptures to be defiled; if they damaged banners and lamps dedicated to merit, disrespected sacred images, or leaked scriptures; if they stole and sold sacred scriptures, treating them like secular texts; if they privately copied them without safeguarding them; if they mixed them with ordinary books without reverence; if they placed them on beds or pillows, or kept them in bedrooms where they slept; if they stored them in rooms filled with filth and disorder, handling wine and meat while discussing scriptures; if they spoke of the Three Treasures during acts of lust; if they read immortal scriptures while consuming foul foods; if they betrayed the Dao and their masters, violating their vows; if they transmitted sacred secrets and leaked holy texts; if they valued wealth and recklessly deceived the foolish—all such thoughts and actions violate the bright statutes and transgress the precepts. The categories of these offenses are boundless.

If, in past or present lives, they have never confessed these sins—extending to the Nine Ancestral Generations, the Seven Generations of Forebears, past and present parents, wives, children, and karmically connected kin—yet now generate a single thought to confess before me, all shall be extinguished, and their inner and outer selves purified."

The Dao Lord said: "If there are good men and good women who, from countless kalpas past to the present day, through all their rebirths—parents, wives, children, past and present—have, with their three karmas and six senses, committed all manner of transgressions; if they have acted cruelly, lacking compassion, killing beings and devouring their flesh; if, for the sake of their parents, themselves, siblings, wives, children, or extended kin, they gathered in villages and slaughtered beings without number each day; if they killed cattle, sheep, donkeys, horses, dogs, chickens, pigs, and other domesticated livestock; if they killed deer, foxes, rabbits, tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves dwelling in mountains and wilds; if they killed geese, crows, magpies, turtledoves, wagtails, owls, kites, ducks, egrets, herons, and other flying birds; if they killed snakes, vipers, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, earthworms, and other crawling creatures; if they killed soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, turtles, snails, clams, frogs, crabs, and other aquatic life; if they killed dung beetles, midges, mole crickets, caterpillars, silkworms, and other small insects; if they killed mosquitoes, fleas, mayflies, maggots, and other creatures born of transformation; if they flew hawks and hunted with dogs, killing beings—"

...or set snares and nets, killing beings; or set fire to mountains, killing beings; or exhaust forests and drain marshes, killing beings; or wield bows and arrows, killing beings; or brandish blades and staves, killing beings; or crush with hands and trample with feet, killing beings; or press down while sitting or lying, killing beings; or till fields and sow crops, killing beings; or build walls and erect barriers, killing beings; or construct houses and dwellings, killing beings; or dig pits and excavate earth, killing beings; or dismantle fences and set up screens, killing beings; or cut grass and level ground, killing beings; or gather firewood and fell trees, killing beings; or pluck flowers and pull grass, killing beings; or raise silkworms and boil cocoons, killing beings; or light lamps and kindle candles, killing beings; or divert water into burrows, killing beings; or pour boiling water onto the ground, killing beings; or wash hair and bathe the body, killing beings; or drink water and eat rice, killing beings; or husk and grind grain, killing beings; or split open wombs and break eggs, killing beings; or swat flies and brush off fleas, killing beings; or open the mouth and close the eyes, killing beings; or raise the hand and stamp the foot, killing beings; or face the Heavenly Worthy, killing beings; or face the scriptures and Dao, killing beings; or face the Dharma master, killing beings; or within the oratory, killing beings; or upon the Dharma seat, killing beings; or through anger and rage, killing beings; or through sorrow and distress, killing beings; or through joy and delight, killing beings; or through song and dance, killing beings; or through prayers and sacrifices to spirits, killing beings; or through compounding medicines, killing beings; or when life ends in one’s grasp, the body perishes on the butcher’s block; or sever heads and limbs, or flay skin and fur, or scorch with raging fire, or boil in seething water; or forcibly separate mother and child, severing their bond; or deliberately destroy the root of life, causing its annihilation; or kill worthy persons and Daoists, common men and women; or kill creditors and enemies, good people from all directions; or kill through intimidation, through terror, through robbery, through poison; or kill through curses, through insults, through delight, through anger; or kill oneself, or incite others to kill, or kill intentionally, or kill by mistake; or kill with the mouth, with the hand, with the mind, with the imagination; or witness killing before one’s eyes, or send others to kill by word of mouth: in all such acts of killing, with every movement of hand or body, countless beings are harmed. At the very moment the mind generates a thought of sincere repentance, all such deeds are eradicated.

The Dao Lord said: If good men and good women, from kalpas without beginning to kalpas without end, including present wives and children, family and kin, their own bodies, parents, nine generations of ancestors and seven of remote lineage, those bound by karmic ties and flesh-and-blood relations—whether in past lives, present lives, or future lives—constantly harbor the intent and commit the act of theft, whether stealing the property of the Heavenly Worthy, or the property of the scriptures and Dao, or the property of the Dharma master, or the property of those who have left the household; or stealing offerings to the Heavenly Worthy, or offerings to the true scriptures, or offerings to the Dharma master, or offerings to those who have left the household, or offerings to the Dao altar, or offerings to the lecture hall, or offerings to the sacred precinct, or offerings to the numinous oratory, or offerings to the fasting assembly, or offerings to those observing the fast; or stealing materials for crafting sacred images, or materials for producing scriptures and Dao, or materials for offerings to the Dharma master, or materials for constructing the sacred precinct, or materials for building oratories, or pure offerings for fasting and purification, or offerings for upholding the precepts and maintaining faith; or stealing the property of the Three Treasures and the ten directions, or the property of the Four Assemblies and the Three Treasures; or stealing items from the radiant treasure of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure seat of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure canopy of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure carriage of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure net of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure banners of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure pillars of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure crown of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure mirror of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure tree of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure flowers of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure hall of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure steed of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the ritual vestments of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the ritual robes of the Heavenly Worthy, or from the treasure seat of the true scriptures, or from the treasure repository of the true scriptures, or from the treasure case of the true scriptures, or from the treasure storehouse of the true scriptures, or from the belongings of the high and venerable seats, or from the belongings of the perfected practitioners of wondrous conduct, or from the belongings of the divine immortals and numinous persons, or from the belongings of the jade lads and maidens, or from the belongings of the vajra guardian deities, or from the belongings of the lion and apotropaic spirits, or from the lamp oil and fire, or from the pure incense, or from the permanent communal property, or from the state granaries and treasuries, or from the common people and others, or from the temples and spirits of gods; or commit theft before the Heavenly Worthy, or before the scriptures and Dao, or within the numinous oratory; or commit theft while avoiding parents, or while avoiding men and women, or while avoiding the king; or take by deceitful means, or by coercion, or by force, or by official authority, or by fraud, or by deception, or by unjust means, or by oppression, or by underhandedness, or by falsification, or in jest, or out of greed and attachment, or by borrowing without repayment, or by exchange, or by failing to return what was borrowed...

Or refuse to repay what is owed, or feign ignorance and bully others, or obscure and confuse to deceive and bewilder: for any object not one’s own—be it the slightest thread or hair, flowers, fruits, grasses, trees, or vegetable leaves—if even a single thought of taking arises, it is theft. Even what is found on the road, encountered in the wild, blown by the wind, carried by birds, delivered by ghosts, or bestowed by spirits; clothing, bedding, utensils, playthings, carriages, horses, cloth, silk, rice, wheat—be it a speck of dust or a single strand—if hidden within the body for countless kalpas, never disclosed, now bring forth all such transgressions before me, before the Ten Directions and all Heavenly Worthies, to implore compassion and acceptance. Today, all gathered in this assembly repent together. Disciples of such-and-such a household repent for the manifold sins committed by their nine generations of ancestors, never before disclosed. Today, at this hour, before the Three Treasures, they resolve to repent, and all sins shall be eradicated.

The Dao Lord says: If there are good men and good women who, from kalpas without measure until this day, through past and present parents, brothers, wives, children, and kin—whether in past lives, present existence, or future rebirths—have constantly engaged in lust, or aroused desires before the Heavenly Worthy, or before the scriptures and Dao, or before the Dharma masters, or upon seeing men and women, or upon seeing clothing, or upon seeing flowers and fruits, or upon seeing mountains and forests, or upon seeing palaces and halls, or upon seeing birds and beasts, or upon seeing oxen, horses, fish, and turtles; or have committed acts of lust before the Heavenly Worthy, or before the scriptures and Dao, or before the Dharma masters, or within the numinous oratory, or within the sacred precincts, or within the Dharma arena, or beneath the seat of the Dharma master, or upon pure ground, or within private chambers, or within the temples of gods; or have seduced others’ wives and concubines, seized and harmed others, separated husbands from wives, abducted others’ sons and daughters; or have disrupted others’ bonds of affection, severed others’ tender attachments; or have colluded with the six relations, united with flesh and blood, coupled with servants and maids, or with birds and beasts; or have made no distinction of beauty or ugliness, or disregarded worthiness or folly; or have forcibly coerced men and women, or sundered husbands and wives; or have defiled the ordained, or exposed their nakedness, showing disrespect to the Three Luminaries, or oppressed the Four Orders; or have indulged in lust with men, women, or even sentient beings, engaging in all manner of desire—whether in thought, dream, or deed—giving free rein to the six senses, boundless and immeasurable, entangling body and mind, never before repented. Today, all gathered in this Dharma assembly, each with utmost sincerity, disclose and repent before me, and the lofty perfected ones shall take pity, the multitude of sages shall show compassion. For the immeasurable sins of your nine generations of ancestors, prostrate yourselves as if Mount Tai were collapsing, bow before the exalted saints, and ten thousand sins shall be extinguished.

The Dao Lord says: If there are good men and good women who, from kalpas without measure until this day, through past and present parents, brothers, their own kin, and dependents—whether in past lives, present existence, or future rebirths—have constantly engaged in miserliness and greed, or aroused miserliness and greed before the Heavenly Worthy and the great Dao, or before the Mahāyāna scriptures, or before the Dharma masters, or before the virtuous perfected ones, or in the presence of the ordained Dharma body, or during fasts and offerings, or where incense is burned and offerings made for great causes, or where temples and monasteries are constructed; or have thought, “I bring not a single coin in life, nor take a single penny in death,” yet upon the hour of death, all is emptiness—how much foolishness, how much miserliness and stinginess! Today, disclose and repent before me, the Three Treasures, together with the assembly of shared karma, with sincere minds. All transgressions committed by past and present kin shall be eradicated.

The Dao Lord says: If there are good men and good women who, from kalpas without measure until this day, through past and present parents, brothers, their own kin, and dependents—whether in past lives, present existence, or future rebirths—have constantly engaged in wrath and anger, or aroused wrath and anger before the Heavenly Worthy; or before the scriptures and Dao, or before the ordained masters and virtuous perfected ones, or before emperors and kings, or before parents; or have felt wrath and anger upon seeing the images of the Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Directions’ lofty perfected ones, and all sagely worthies, or upon seeing the Mahāyāna scriptures and Dao; or have felt wrath upon seeing Dharma masters expounding the supreme teachings in great assemblies, or upon seeing high-ranking officials in Golden Register rituals praying for the emperor’s longevity, or upon seeing Dharma masters expounding the great methods of Lingbao refinement and deliverance, or upon seeing grand fasts and vast offerings; or have felt wrath upon seeing great assemblies upholding the precepts, establishing Jade Register fasts, burning boundless precious incense to offer to the dust-mote-like worthies and sages of the Ten Directions, universally delivering all sentient beings of the six paths; or have felt wrath upon seeing beggars, the poor, the old, the sick, the orphaned, and the solitary, or upon seeing prisoners and travelers, or upon seeing oxen, sheep, birds, beasts, and wild animals; or have raged against heaven and earth, or against the Three Luminaries, or against the sovereign, or against parents, or against ghosts and spirits, or against servants and maids, or against beasts and animals.

Whether they have committed offenses or not, whether close or distant, whether human or non-human, whether male or female—merely conceiving a thought or forming an intention gives rise to wrath. Today, they come in sincerity before me to seek mercy and repent, and all their transgressions and obstacles shall be eradicated.

The Dao Lord declares: If there are good men and good women who, from kalpas without measure, have felt stinginess and greed before fields of merit and virtue; or have felt stinginess and greed in the presence of emperors and kings; or have felt stinginess and greed before their parents, sons, or daughters; or have felt stinginess and greed before sages and elders; or have felt stinginess and greed upon seeing wealth; or upon seeing food and drink; or upon seeing fields and dwellings; or upon seeing carriages and horses; or upon seeing houses; or upon seeing servants and maids; or upon seeing mountains and forests; or upon seeing flowers and fruits; or upon seeing palaces; or upon seeing city walls; or upon seeing the poor; or have refused to save and treat the old and sick, giving rise to stinginess; or upon seeing prisoners, have not sought to rescue them, giving rise to greed; or upon seeing travelers afflicted by hunger, thirst, or illness, have not provided food, drink, or medicine, giving rise to greed; even to the point of hoarding their own possessions, others’ belongings, communal goods, or official property—be it a single hair, a thread, a blade of grass, a leaf, a flower, a fruit, a grain of rice, a kernel of wheat, or a pinch of anything—refusing to give in charity out of stinginess and greed; or have refused to give when seeing the Heavenly Worthy; or when seeing the scriptures; or when seeing Dharma masters; or when seeing those who have left the household life; or when seeing fasts and offerings; or when seeing those who observe fasts; or when seeing lamps being lit; or when seeing incense being burned and precepts being received; or when seeing sutras being expounded; or when seeing vast Daoist altars; or when seeing the numinous altars and celestial halls; or when seeing the radiant palaces of the sacred realms; or when seeing images being made; or when seeing scriptures being copied; or when seeing grand offerings; or when seeing scriptures being recited and the Dao being practiced; or have refused to give when seeing vast fields of merit established as permanent endowments; or when seeing the ninefold radiant palaces, bells, chimes, towers, and corridors in disrepair; or when seeing halls being repaired; or when seeing alms being begged; or when seeing prisoners and sinners.

They amass wealth like mountains, yet their hearts are never satisfied, planning for a thousand years on the basis of a single day’s sustenance. When the time of their lives comes to this day, they and their past and present parents, wives, children, and kin—whether in this body or another—constantly act in ignorance. They may act in ignorance before the Heavenly Worthy and the great Dao; or before the Mahayana sutras; or before great and virtuous Dharma masters; or before those who have left the household life and attained the Dharma-body; or before parents and sovereigns; or before wives, concubines, sons, and daughters; or before ghosts, spirits, and numinous sages; or before the worthy and sagely beings of empty space. They may curse heaven and earth, or revile ghosts and spirits; or rebel against their sovereign, failing to practice benevolence and filial piety.

They may turn to violence and bring about calamity, establish laws that disrupt constancy, commit incest with kin within and kill others without; they may disbelieve in the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, in the retribution of past lives, claiming all arises naturally, enduring without end, making no distinction between good and evil, unable to recognize the worthy and the foolish. All such acts are called ignorance. If one awakens to this and sincerely repents, all may be eradicated, and one shall remain perpetually pure.

The Dao Lord said: If there are good men and good women who, from immeasurable kalpas past until this day, in past and present parents, wives, children, and their own kin—whether in this body or another—set their minds and form intentions, uttering frivolous speech; or utter frivolous speech before the Three Caverns’ scriptures; or before Dharma masters and great virtuous ones; or before emperors and kings; or before parents and revered kin; or before the worthy and elders; or before the lowly and ignorant; or before the blind, deaf, and those with the six afflictions; or before the honored and noble; or before the wealthy and powerful; or rely on seniority to utter frivolous speech; or rely on wealth and nobility to utter frivolous speech; or rely on intelligence and wisdom to utter frivolous speech; or rely on their own understanding to utter frivolous speech; or before all the heavenly hosts and sages, the immortals of the ten directions, the stars, sun, and moon, and all numinous spirits—wherever their minds turn, they utter frivolous speech, flowery words without substance—if they awaken to this, generate remorse and repentance, and come before me to confess, all may be eradicated.

The Dao Lord said: If there are good men and good women, along with their parents, daughters, brothers, and kin, who from immeasurable kalpas past, whether in this body or another, set their minds and form intentions, uttering frivolous and false speech, harsh words and double tongues; or before the Heavenly Worthy, the great Dao, the true scriptures and wondrous Dharma, revered masters and parents, emperors and kings, the worthy and Daoist practitioners, the stellar constellations, the sages of empty space, and all realms—whether human or non-human—utter frivolous and false speech, harsh words and double tongues, envying those superior to themselves, stirring strife and discord, separating kin, turning falsehood into truth and deception into reality, deceiving and misleading all, unaware of how to return to the great Dao and lofty perfected ones—if they openly confess and repent of these immeasurable karmic roots, I shall know it all, and they shall be made pure, attaining the root of faith.

The Dao Lord said: If there are good men and good women who, whether in this body or another, from immeasurable kalpas past, with their eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, have constructed all manner of sins—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, dissipation, stinginess, greed, anger, ignorance, delusion, frivolous speech, harsh words, double tongues, envy of those superior to themselves, drinking alcohol, eating meat, violating scriptural teachings, destroying sacred images, failing to uphold fasting and precepts, disrespecting masters and revered ones, turning from truth toward falsehood, believing in perverse views, sacrificing to ghosts and spirits, not revering the Three Treasures, slandering and reviling, acting with arrogance and carelessness, indulging in sound and beauty, becoming attached to fragrances and flavors, sinking into sensory delights, creating harm within and without, generating transgressions in succession, with the six senses mutually arising, compounding errors, allowing karmic roots to grow, thought after thought forming wrongs—possessing immeasurable grave sins, as numerous as the grains of sand, long-accumulated habits residing within the body, from past causes to present causes, kalpa after kalpa, beyond reckoning—if they generate a single thought of repentance, all may be made pure.

It is like a bright mirror: whether before or after, countless specks of dust, even grease and grime, all manner of impurities, accumulate to form obstructions, dimming its inner and outer clarity. Yet when it encounters a skilled craftsman who wipes, polishes, and refines it, its surface and interior become radiant, reflecting near and far, perfectly clear and bright, restored to its original state. Why is this? Because its nature is fundamentally pure. So too are sentient beings: their spirit is originally pure, without any defilement. But after receiving form, the six thieves and six dusts, the six desires and six consciousnesses, make discriminating and deluded constructions, defiling the body, obscuring it within and without, losing their true nature, drifting through birth and death, constantly entering the path of sin, meeting with karmic retribution, and thus falling into hell, enduring all manner of suffering, sinking for ten thousand kalpas.

Out of compassion, I take pity on sentient beings, and from kalpa to kalpa, I turn through the human realm, whether in China or among the barbarians, whether old or young, whether ordinary or sagely, whether female or male, whether noble or base, manifesting in various forms, employing expedient means to teach and transform, delivering sentient beings. The scriptural teachings are transmitted to awaken all, enabling them to escape suffering and forever depart from the hells. Yet sentient beings are dull-witted and cannot comprehend; therefore, I now explain again in detail, broadly revealing the causes and conditions, so that all sentient beings may attain liberation.

The Dao Lord said: If there are good men and good women who constantly uphold this scripture, burn incense, and repent, they shall eradicate all suffering within their bodies and attain purity, able to eliminate the karmic roots of evil deeds accumulated by immeasurable sentient beings. The heavenly sages, perfected ones of wondrous conduct, immortals, and numinous beings always wish for people to burn incense and repent, so that good spirits will protect them and the host of sages will support them. If karmic obstructions bind the body, fettering it within and without, then evil spirits may harm them, illness will cling to their bodies, and they will encounter water, fire, blades, weapons, poisonous insects, fierce beasts, shackles, prisons, and all manner of harm. Ordinary people only know to adorn their faces, clothing, hands, and feet, merely washing their bodies externally with worldly water, yet remain unaware of using the water of Dharma to internally cleanse the karmic roots of sin and evil deeds within their minds and bodies. How can they not be deluded? If they diligently wash and purify matters of the face, hands, feet, and clothing, they shall surely attain the true Dao.

Chapter Six: Receiving the Precepts

The Universally Compassionate True Person of Great Mercy, having inquired of the Supreme Dao Lord regarding karmic retribution and causation,
At that time, the Dao Lord addressed the Universally Compassionate One, saying:
Since the beginningless world, I have constantly dwelt among humans, teaching and expounding the Dharma to deliver sentient beings.
I enable those of the past and future, the ten directions and three realms, humans and devas, ordinary beings and sages, to universally hear and know, equally attaining the formless, entering the true and eternal Dao—neither born nor extinguished, neither departing nor arriving, eternally abiding in clarity, perfectly penetrating the tranquil chamber.
All who ascend this realm must uphold the precepts, from the initial arousal of the mind to the ultimate fruition.

Repentance and precept-reception, recitation and mindfulness, fasting and Dao-practice with utmost sincerity, the arousal of vast vows, praise and almsgiving, nourishing sentient beings, rescuing and protecting all, broadly establishing merit—
These evoke response from the devas, generate blessings and spiritually transform, gather causes to engender transformation, align root and trace with karmic opportunity, verify the practice of true suchness, disseminate the teachings, broadly unify true responses, and only then do they meet the Dao.
Moment by moment without cessation, extinguishing the mind and forgetting the mind, all must uphold the precepts.
Those who uphold the precepts without transgression will have devas descend to them, sages revere them, and demonic hordes sing their praises. Each, according to their merit, will have their names inscribed in the upper palaces.
Therefore, I expound the precept-gate in accordance with their capacities, varying in number and differing in grade, allowing you, sentient beings, to receive them as your karmic conditions permit.

The Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Six Precepts, Seven Precepts, Eight Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, the Twelve Acceptable Precepts, the Fourteen Precepts for Upholding the Body, the Twenty-Four Precepts, the Twenty-Seven Precepts, the Thirty-Six Precepts—
Extending to the Lower Grade of the Cavern Mystery’s forty precepts, the Middle Grade’s sixty, the Upper Grade’s eighty, and the one hundred eighty;
The Upper Clarity’s three hundred precepts for observing the body, the Cavern Spirit’s seven hundred twenty precepts: each has its sequence, guiding the deluded multitude.
Those who receive and uphold them all obtain blessings and benefits, extinguishing sins without end.
These are scattered throughout the various scriptures of the Three Caverns and have long circulated.
Yet sentient beings, benighted and ignorant, have been unable to hear them.
Now, I shall only expound for you the Supreme Ten Precepts, which generate blessings for humans and devas and create good karmic conditions for birth and death. Transmit these to future generations, universally enabling their protection and upholding, bringing blessings and dispelling calamities—such is inconceivable.

**The First Precept:** Do not kill, nor harbor the thought of killing. Constantly practice compassion, delivering and liberating all beings. Regard all sentient beings as you would yourself.

**The Second Precept:** Do not steal, nor harbor the thought of stealing. Constantly practice yielding and humility, refusing what is unrighteous. Regard all resources and wealth as you would your own possessions.

**The Third Precept:** Do not engage in licentious conduct, nor harbor licentious thoughts. Constantly practice chastity, dwelling alone in seclusion. Regard all men and women as you would your own flesh and blood.

**The Fourth Precept:** Do not be miserly or greedy, nor harbor greedy thoughts. Constantly practice almsgiving, broadly aiding the impoverished. Maintain an equanimous mind, without distinction between self and others.

**The Fifth Precept:** Do not harbor anger, nor entertain angry thoughts. Constantly practice joy and harmony, reconciling enemies and kin. Regard all sentient beings as you would a newborn child.

**The Sixth Precept:** Do not be deluded, nor harbor deluded thoughts. Constantly practice wisdom, exhorting and guiding the benighted. Regard all sentient beings as you would your own hands and feet.

**The Seventh Precept:** Do not engage in frivolous speech, nor harbor frivolous thoughts. Constantly practice loyalty and integrity, inwardly and outwardly pure and harmonious. Regard all scriptural teachings with the thought of recitation and devotion.

**The Eighth Precept:** Do not lie, nor harbor false thoughts. Constantly practice truthfulness, without deceit in concealment or openness. Regard all people without the thought of falsehood or deception.

**The Ninth Precept:** Do not engage in harsh speech or cursing, nor harbor harsh thoughts. Constantly maintain right mindfulness, never arousing a venomous mind. Regard all venomous serpents as bringing harm upon themselves.

**The Tenth Precept:** Do not engage in divisive speech or sow discord, nor harbor divisive thoughts. Constantly practice uprightness, never arousing love or aversion. Regard all self and others without partiality or bias.

The Dao Lord said: These Ten Precepts are the city walls and dwelling houses of sentient beings.
Those who uphold them will have twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, Vajra Spirit Kings, Generals, and Divine Warriors each, attending and guarding at their sides, dispelling disasters and transcending calamities, preserving life and prolonging years.
True sages revere them, and all devas rejoice.
Blades and weapons, water and fire, tigers, wolves, insects, and serpents, illness, imprisonment, ghosts, thieves, demonic spirits, hunger, cold, afflictions, and all manner of calamities shall never assail their bodies.
Those who seek sons shall have sons; those who seek daughters shall have daughters. Wealth, nobility, longevity, and joy—all wishes shall be fulfilled.
Wisdom and intelligence, a dignified appearance—first among humans, inconceivable.
In past lives, they shall be reborn in the celestial palaces of the Pure Lands, amidst flower terraces and jeweled halls, clothed and fed without effort, riding cloud canopies and dragon chariots, carefree and at ease.
Constantly hearing the scriptural Dharma, serving the Heavenly Worthy, they shall transmigrate through successive lives to meet the true and correct Dao.
Those who uphold these precepts are like a precious sword, able to sever all things; like a Dharma boat, able to ferry all across; like a raging fire, able to burn all things; like pure water, able to wash all things. From the Three Clarities downward to the true immortals and sages of the ten directions, none have not done so by upholding these precepts.

Precepts prevent transgressions and halt evil, restrain body and mind, subdue demonic forces, and move the numinous and sagely.
The Dao Lord said: Formerly, five hundred men in the Pure Harmony Kingdom on the Empty Brightness Mountain practiced the Dao for twenty-one years, jointly upholding these precepts, and all awakened to the formless. I dispatched the Perfected One of Attained Appearance to deliver them into the Realm of Formlessness, where they now all dwell as Golden Radiance Immortals, further studying the Great Vehicle and gradually ascending to the true ranks.
Again, in the Accumulated Emptiness Mountain of the Floating Abode Kingdom, thirty-six thousand women of one mind practiced the Dao. For a hundred years, they never heard this scripture of precepts and were harmed by a great demonic spirit, all sinking into the Water of Ignorance, drifting and drowning, unable to escape.

I dispatched the Perfected One of Salvation and Liberation to that place to rescue and deliver them, bestowing upon them this scripture so they might gradually awaken. Relocating them to Guanshan, they rightly upheld the Ten Precepts. Already six million years have passed, during which they have diligently striven day and night, single-minded and unwavering. Divine mushrooms and sacred herbs, sweet dew and jade pools spontaneously arise in their midst, providing sustenance and drink. Gradually they grow enlightened, naturally attaining the utmost truth.

Puji asked: I wonder whether those who uphold these precepts must receive them from a master, or is merely reading the scripture sufficient? Moreover, sentient beings differ in their qi and strength—some practice for their entire lives, while others cease after a time. I wonder what this signifies.

I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to deign to clarify.

The Dao Lord said: If there are good men and good women who can arouse the mind for the Dao, approach a master to receive the precepts, and practice them for life, whether in past or present, they will obtain boundless blessings. If they copy and transcribe the scripture, recite it according to its teachings, burn incense and make offerings, and cultivate in accordance with the Dao, this is the foremost practice, inconceivable in its merit. If they encounter lectures expounding the scripture’s wondrous principles and broadly teach the people, or approach a master to transmit and receive the precepts with wholehearted devotion, cultivating as the precepts prescribe, their blessings will be towering. Even if they approach a master to receive the precepts but fail to practice them, or uphold them at home only temporarily before abandoning them, they still receive transient grace, and their blessings are not slight. Why is this? It is like a single downpour of sweet rain—all who receive it are moistened, and each benefits according to the nourishment they absorb. Those touched by the precepts all depend on it.

The Dao Lord said: If Daoist priests or nuns, for the sake of the kingdom’s ruler, ministers, people, lands, mountains, forests, the Three Wretched Realms, the Five Sufferings, and all sentient beings, arouse the mind wherever they may be and establish a hundred high seats, broadly summoning companions to lecture on this scripture for three days, seven days, nine days, ten days, or even a hundred days—without limit to the time—burning incense, circumambulating, bowing in repentance, making vows, scattering flowers, lighting lamps, and universally exhorting sentient beings to uphold fasting and precepts, so that all may hear and know, wishing for the world’s great peace and the people’s well-being, their blessings will be resplendent. If there are those who, for the sake of the king, emperor, land, and people, copy this scripture in hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands or countless volumes, circulating it everywhere to teach and transform all beings so they may receive and uphold it, their blessings will be boundless and inconceivable.

The Dao Lord said: When Daoist priests or nuns transmit and receive precepts for men and women, they should first conduct the *xinchou* ritual. The *chou* should be one foot and two inches long, made of bamboo or wood as convenient. Only after presenting this *chou* should the precepts be conferred. There are four reasons for conducting this *chou* ritual: first, to inspire men and women to generate the mind of dedication; second, to examine their original resolve in advance, ensuring it is firm; third, to demonstrate the bond of trust, arousing a thirsting aspiration; and fourth, for the precept-receiving disciples to openly express their sincere vows and mutual deliverance. This is why it is called the *xinchou* (trust-token). The *chou* serves two purposes: first, to allow one to assess the quantity of one’s own good and evil deeds; and second, to invite the Perfected and Sages to calculate and extend one’s lifespan. This method manifests the dharma’s form, ensuring the precepts are upheld with singular devotion. Therefore, when transmitting precepts, this *xinchou* is first bestowed.

**Chapter Seven: Upholding the Fast**

The Dao Lord said: Since the beginningless time of receiving form, sentient beings have been miserly, greedy, and lustful, indulging in food, wine, and meat without restraint. They nourish their flesh and blood, breeding disease and affliction, deepening the roots of transgression. Birth, aging, sickness, and death; heat, dampness, wind, and cold; aches, itches, soreness, and pain; noxious winds and toxic qi invade the body, contaminating its form, and a hundred illnesses assail it. Impermanence follows moment by moment, day and night without cease. The conditions of birth and the endowment of consciousness differ for each, cycling day and night through myriad births and deaths: some dwell in the womb, congealing into pus and blood, only to dissolve and vanish; some remain in the mother’s belly, unable to be born, only to be destroyed; though briefly separated at birth, mother and child soon die, beyond reckoning. Whether one or two years old, or even a hundred, moment by moment they decline and dissipate—how could aging and decay ever cease? Headaches and fevers, myriad afflictions assail them. In a single lifetime, there is scarcely a moment of peace and ease. This is truly due to the copious consumption of filth and impurity, filling the body within. Wine and meat seep into the flesh, steaming the organs; noxious winds and toxic qi fan the frame, and even gold and jade dissolve—how could the body endure? I do not eat or drink, embracing the Dao’s spontaneity, transforming without limit, living forever without death. I constantly expound the scriptural teachings to deliver sentient beings. Yet ordinary beings, deluded and ignorant, cannot believe and employ them. I am ever concerned and grieved for them, hence I established the fast to eliminate their sickness and suffering.

Formerly, in the presence of the Primordial Lord, I received the thirty-six divisions of scriptures, the fast’s subtle methods for delivering all classes of beings. Practiced among humans, they possess established efficacy. Yet ordinary beings, lacking understanding, dismiss them as empty and absurd. Even the Three Clarities’ host of Sages, who long ago realized the Dao’s truth, constantly uphold the fast and diligently practice without negligence. How much more should you? If superior practitioners diligently uphold the perpetual fast in a pure chamber, reciting scriptures and burning incense without slackening, whether living or deceased, they adapt the methods according to the foolish and wise, employing skillful means to deliver sentient beings. The Six Fasts, Ten Direct Days, Eight Festivals, Three Primes, Jiazi and Benming days, Three Assemblies, Gengshen days, and various other salvific practices—subtle and wondrous beyond thought—are all methods by which the Primordial Lord guides and receives those below. I constantly exhort and teach, universally urging their cultivation.

Puji asked: I wonder about establishing the fast—how heavy or light are its merits? Are there any deities who oversee it? Is it merely abstaining from food, or are there solemn observances? Moreover, the Dao is perfectly pervasive, pervading all dharmas. Should one practice according to one’s capacity and freely exercise one’s abilities in establishing the Six Fasts and other methods? I am still unclear and humbly request your instruction.

The Dao Lord answered: The weight of merit depends on the descent of the myriad heavens; the solemn observances and ritual regulations differ for the Six Fasts and the like. All are set forth in the sacred Lingbao scriptures. Now I shall briefly explain—listen carefully.

The fast comprises two distinct kinds: one for attaining the utmost Dao, the other for deliverance. The utmost Dao is pursued by those who, from the first stirring of aspiration to the final attainment, maintain the fast in every thought without wavering. This path has two gates: one is the forgetting of the heart-mind, the other its extinction.

The forgetting of the heart-mind means that from beginning to end, one directs intention such that in movement and stillness, form is forgotten. Still as dead ashes, like withered wood, thought and念 are extinguished—only the One remains. The extinction of the heart-mind means that with each arising thought, one lets it pass, the spirit unconfined, the heart-mind returning to quiescence until reaching the Dao-ground.

Deliverance, on the other hand, entails turning one’s thoughts toward the utmost Dao, yearning for the mysterious and true, so that blessings descend and endless calamities dissolve. Even before signs appear, there are two ways to practice according to one’s capacity: one through sincere devotion, the other through offering wealth.

Sincere devotion means wholly dedicating the heart-mind, with utmost sincerity in all ten directions, burning incense and prostrating, seeking only the Dao. Offering wealth means procuring fragrant oils, the eight delicacies and a hundred flavors, preparing feasts and offerings, inviting Daoist masters and even ordinary practitioners, turning the heart-mind to supplicate. Entrusting one’s fate to the perfected and true, inwardly dissolving the six dusts, outwardly aligning with the ten thousand phenomena, the heart-mind stilled in contemplation, one returns in sincerity to the Dao, thereby perfecting the supreme fruit and eternally uniting with the formless.

Whether saving the living or the dead, delivering from suffering and calamity, one practices according to capacity. Blessings descend without fail, and the weight of merit varies with the occasion.

On the days of the fast, the celestial worthies of the heavens above, perfected immortals, numinous beings, jade lads and jade maidens, the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, and all majestic spirits—bearing banners and holding tablets, soaring through empty space, burning incense and scattering flowers—listen to the Dharma-sound, record merits and transgressions, inscribe names in the heavens, in golden registers and jade script, to receive boundless blessings.

The reason for designating specific days and months is that on these occasions, I dispatch the deities of good and evil from the Three Realms and the ten directions to traverse the human realm.

In the first month, the Green Emperor and the Nine Qi Merit Officers, Generals with nine hundred million hosts, bearing banners and holding tablets, descend to the human world with divine immortals, jade lads and maidens, and celestial troops to record merits and transgressions.

In the third month, the Yellow Emperor and the One Qi Vanquishing Stellar General with five hundred million hosts, holding talismans and registers, descend with divine immortals, jade lads and maidens, and celestial troops to investigate and verify merits and transgressions.

In the fifth month, the Red Emperor and the Three Qi Victorious Radiance General with three hundred million hosts, soaring through empty space, descend to the human world with heavenly immortals, jade lads and maidens, and celestial troops to examine merits and transgressions.

In the seventh month, the White Emperor and the Seven Qi Transmitting General with seven hundred million hosts, with jade wheels and feathered canopies, descend to the human world with heavenly soldiers and divine warriors to record merits and transgressions.

In the ninth month, the Supreme One Qi River Stalwart General with five hundred million hosts, brandishing banners and holding tablets, descends to the human world with Merit Officers, envoys, jade lads and maidens to transcribe good and evil.

In the eleventh month, the Black Emperor and the Five Qi Divine Marshal with five hundred million hosts, burning incense and scattering flowers, descend to the human world with the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger to rectify merits and transgressions.

The fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Prime, when the Ten Heavenly Spirit Officers, celestial troops, and countless hosts of perfected worthies and exalted sages, along with the wondrously accomplished perfected, descend to the human world to assess and determine merits and transgressions.

The fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Prime, when the Nine Earthly Spirit Officers, celestial troops, and countless hosts from the renowned mountains and grottoes, along with divine immortals and celestial troops, descend to the human world to review and record merits and transgressions.

The fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Prime, when the Nine River Water Emperors, the great deities of the twelve river sources and valley streams, and the spirit officers of the water palaces descend to the human world to examine and determine merits and transgressions.

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, the Primordial Lord dispatches the Heavenly Worthy of Salvific Immortals, the supreme sage, with the Lord of the Beginning Azure Heaven, countless celestial troops, and divine immortals to teach and transform the human world, delivering sentient beings.

On the Spring Equinox, the Primordial Lord dispatches the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure Sovereign, with the Azure Numinous Beginning Elder Lord and countless celestial troops to teach and transform the human world, delivering sentient beings.

On the Beginning of Summer, the Primordial Lord dispatches the Heavenly Worthy of Life-Sustaining Salvation, with the Lord of the Beginning Cinnabar Heaven and measureless celestial hosts to teach and transform the human world, delivering all beings.

On the Summer Solstice, the Primordial Lord dispatches the Heavenly Worthy of the Myriad Blessings of the Mysterious and True, with the Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder Lord and measureless celestial hosts to teach and transform the human world, delivering sentient beings.

On the Beginning of Autumn, the Primordial Lord dispatches the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous and Empty Sovereign, with the Lord of the Beginning White Heaven and measureless celestial hosts to teach and transform the human world, delivering all beings.

On the Autumn Equinox, the Primordial Lord dispatches the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme and Wondrous Ultimate, with the Radiant Numinous August Elder Lord and countless celestial hosts to teach and transform the human world, delivering all beings.

On the Beginning of Winter, the Primordial Lord dispatches the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Florescence, with the Lord of the Beginning Mysterious Heaven and countless celestial hosts to teach and transform the human world, delivering all beings.

On the Winter Solstice, the Primordial Lord dispatches the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious and Supreme Jade Palace, with the Five Numinous Mysterious Elder Lords and countless celestial hosts to teach and transform the human world, delivering all beings.

All are accompanied by jade lads and maidens, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Four Officers and Five Emperors, bearing talismans and holding tablets, burning incense and scattering flowers. Dragon chariots and phoenix carriages fill the empty sky; now long, now short, now cloud, now rain, now wind, now dew, now bird, now beast, now azure, now yellow—manifold transformations traverse the human world, recording merits and transgressions, observing sentient beings.

On the first day of each month, the Primordial Lord of the Northwest Heaven descends with the Northern Dipper and the Messengers of Proclamation. On the eighth day, the Primordial Lord of the Northern Heaven descends with the Northern Dipper, the Controller of Demonic Slayers, and the Crimson Chariot Messengers. On the fourteenth day, the Primordial Lord of the Northeast Heaven descends with the Messengers of the Grand Unity and the Directors of Celestial Offices. On the fifteenth day, the Primordial Lord of the Eastern Heaven descends with the Heavenly Emperor and the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, along with the Inspecting Messengers. On the eighteenth day, the Primordial Lord of the Southeast Heaven descends with the Heavenly Unity and the Messengers of the Demon Bureau. On the twenty-third day, the Primordial Lord of the Southern Heaven descends with the Eight Divine Messengers of the Grand Unity and the Attendants bearing talismans and decrees. On the twenty-fourth day, the Primordial Lord of the Southwest Heaven descends with the Northern Asterism and the Three Generals Guarding the Household. On the twenty-eighth day, the Primordial Lord of the Western Heaven descends with the Lower Grand Unity and the Heavenly Duke’s Messengers. On the twenty-ninth day, the Primordial Lord of the Lower Primordial Heaven descends with the Median Grand Unity and the various officials and generals. On the thirtieth day, the Primordial Lord of the Upper Primordial Heaven descends with the Supreme Grand Unity and the Heavenly Emperor’s Messengers. All are accompanied by the hosts of all heavens, the perfected and most true honored deities, jade lads and maidens, the Four Officers and Five Emperors, and the Five Dippers’ Inspectors. Bearing tablets and holding banners, they pace the void while reciting scriptures, examining the good and evil, merits and transgressions accumulated by men and women.

Additionally, on *jiǎzǐ* days, the Grand Unity’s Median Terrace Grand Envoys descend. On *gēngshēn* days, the Three Corpses Controlling the People descend from the Supreme Mystery’s Upper Palace. Furthermore, on the first day of the first month, offerings are made for longevity; on the seventh day, auspiciousness is welcomed. On the eighth day of the second month, the fragrance of spring. On the third day of the third month, evil is purged. On the eighth day of the fourth month, summer is inaugurated. On the fifth day of the fifth month, life is prolonged. On the sixth day of the sixth month, summer heat is purified. On the seventh day of the seventh month, autumn is welcomed. On the first day of the eighth month, evil is expelled. On the ninth day of the ninth month, lifespan is extended. On the first day of the tenth month, blessings are completed. On the eleventh and fifteenth days, blessings are inaugurated. On the fifth day of the twelfth month, a hundred blessings. On one’s natal day, prayers are offered for the year. On the Three Assemblies’ days, merit is established.

On all these fasting days, whether emperors and kings, lords of states, empresses and consorts, great ministers, dukes and chancellors, Daoist priestesses and officials, or the myriad common people—if they burn incense and practice the Dao, recite scriptures and offer thanks, expound this sutra, present their names on white slips, and submit petitions to the mountains and rivers, the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, and the numinous offices of grotto-heavens—We shall always dispatch perfected persons, divine immortals, and jade maidens to attend them, while jade lads and incense officials record their names, inscribing them in the Divine Immortals’ Jade Register of Longevity. Thus, calamities shall be dispelled, all sufferings purified, and they shall enjoy boundless blessings.

Fasting for one day eradicates fifty kinds of sins within the body and yields five days’ surplus sustenance. Fasting for two days eradicates one hundred kinds of sins and yields ten days’ surplus sustenance. Fasting for three days eradicates one hundred and fifty kinds of sins and yields fifteen days’ surplus sustenance. Fasting for five days or more eradicates five hundred kinds of sins and yields a thousand days’ surplus sustenance. Fasting for a hundred days eradicates ten thousand sins within the body; the traveling kitchen arrives, jade maidens assist in welcome, and clothing and food arise spontaneously. Fasting for a thousand days brings the attendance of the Three Realms’ guards and the support of the Five Emperors; households flourish, descendants prosper; heavenly beings draw near, auspiciousness daily increases. In the past, one is reborn at the gates of the Heavenly Kings, or gains wisdom and intelligence, a refined and dignified appearance, long life, and natural joy.

The Dao Lord said: “In the past, in the Pure and Wondrous Land, I expounded the Dao and taught the heavenly and human realms. At that time, eighty-seven thousand men and women came together before the seat, all arousing good intentions and forming great vows. For emperors and kings, lords of states, empresses and consorts, great ministers, dukes and chancellors, the people of the land, and all sentient beings, they constantly observed the Six Fasts and Ten Upright Days, the Three Primordials and Eight Festivals, the *jiǎzǐ* and *gēngshēn* fasts, and various other fasts. They also constructed hundred-seat high platforms, summoned Daoist masters to expound this sutra, and for twelve years maintained unwavering sincerity, moving the heavens. I dispatched the Left Mystery Perfected Person to bestow upon them the elixir of immortality, and each attained longevity. Now they dwell in the Mountain of Accumulated Goodness, all having realized the Dao of immortality. Their dignified deportment and ritual regulations each accord with the Three Caverns’ methods.”

Puji bowed and asked: “May I inquire as to the proper times for fasting?”

The Dao Lord replied: “The revolutions of heaven and earth, the alternation of day and night, the twelve double-hours—within them, qi has birth and death, flourishing and decline, transformation and change. Good and evil, auspiciousness and inauspiciousness differ between humans and ghosts; sins and blessings are distinct. The advantages and harms of yin and yang each have their proper times. Now I shall explain them in full; you should listen carefully.

At midnight, the heavenly beings take their meal. If worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan increases by ninety years, eighty-one diseases are eliminated, and the Earth Officials show reverence. At cockcrow, the heavenly officials take their meal. If worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan increases by one hundred years, ninety diseases are eliminated, and the Earth Officials welcome them. At dawn, the heavenly assistants take their meal. If worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan increases by one hundred and twenty years, one hundred diseases are eliminated, and the Earth Officials stand in awe. At sunrise, the Heavenly Kings take their meal. If worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan increases by one hundred and forty years, one hundred and twenty diseases are eliminated, and the Earth Officials send and welcome them. At the *chén* hour, the Heavenly Emperor Śakra takes his meal. If worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan increases by one hundred and eighty years, one hundred and sixty diseases are eliminated, and the Earth Officials stand at the gate. At mid-morning, the perfected and holy beings of heaven take their meal. If worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan increases by four hundred years, four hundred and four diseases are eliminated. The heavenly beings descend in attendance; jade maidens scatter flowers, golden lads waft incense, and the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, the sun, moon, and stars, the divine immortals’ troops and horses, and the vajra warriors all arrive together. Ceasing evil and halting wrongdoing, one’s name is heard in the Upper Clarity; the myriad heavens rejoice, and all obtain blessings. This is the proper time to observe the fast.”

At noon, the demon kings of heaven take their meal; if worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan is reduced by ninety years, and they contract eighty-one diseases, while the Earth Officials examine their bodies. At the time when the sun casts its rays, the demon kings of earth take their meal; if worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan is reduced by one hundred years, and they contract ninety-one diseases, while the Earth Officials harm their gates. At the hour of dusk, the various ghosts and spirits of the human realm take their meal; if worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan is reduced by one hundred and twenty years, and they contract one hundred diseases, while the Earth Officials generate transgressions, and evil ghosts slay their bodies. At twilight, the ghostly spirits of the underworld’s Dark King take their meal; if worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan is reduced by one hundred and eighty years, and they contract two hundred diseases, with manifold harms afflicting their bodies. At the hour of human stillness, the hungry ghosts, beasts, and the ghostly spirits of Fengdu take their meal; if worldly people eat at this time, their lifespan is extinguished by five thousand years, and they contract four hundred and four diseases, with ten thousand harms assailing their bodies. Thus, demonic entities and malevolent spirits seize upon their food and drink to enter their bellies, generating a hundred diseases, manifold sufferings, and all manner of calamities, seizing their lifespan and preventing them from attaining the immortality of divine transcendents.

If men and women can follow my method, each understanding what has been said, whenever they eat, they must first set out all manner of foods before them: first to offer to the immortals and sages, second to nourish the earth deities, third to give to the ghosts and spirits, and fourth to provide for all beings. By cultivating these four intentions, one embodies great compassion and mercy, averting all misfortune and malevolence, so that ghostly qi cannot invade.

Scattering food to birds and beasts, extending it to insects and fish, ensuring all are sated, one obtains boundless blessings, and in life and death, they receive grace.

The Perfected One of Universal Salvation again asked: In what order should one receive food? The Dao Lord replied: First, one must wash and rinse, compose the body, burn incense, perform the Daoist circuit, repent, bow in worship, make vows, and dedicate the merit. After presenting one’s petitions, one may then receive the food. Closing the eyes and visualizing, the various spirits within the body partake together with the Three Ones. While eating, one must not allow others to casually touch or handle anything with unclean hands. Chewing slowly and deliberately, one should ingest it together with the qi. One should always hold clean cloths and vessels in hand, avoiding all vulgar, defiling speech, laughter, or clamor. This is called "Dharmic Eating," and only then is it called a pure fast. If one can adhere to these words, the heavens will descend in chariots, the ten thousand sages will arrive together, the host of perfected beings will praise it, jade maidens will scatter flowers, and in life and death, one will receive grace, obtaining boundless blessings.

The fourth scroll of *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra on Karmic Retribution and Causation* concludes.

The eighth chapter: Recitation and Invocation

The Perfected One of Great Compassion and Universal Salvation, having inquired about karmic retribution and causation, addressed the Supreme Dao Lord. At that time, the Dao Lord told Universal Salvation: In the past, the Heavenly King of Victorious Joy summoned thirty-six thousand female Daoist officials; the Heavenly King of Wondrous Transformation summoned three thousand two hundred female Daoist officials; the Heavenly King of Wondrous Virtue summoned one thousand five hundred female Daoist officials; the Heavenly King of Purity summoned eighteen thousand female Daoist officials; the Heavenly King of Numinous Harmony summoned five hundred and sixty female Daoist officials; and the Heavenly King of Floating Harmony summoned seventy-two thousand female Daoist officials. These six heavenly kings simultaneously established Daoist altars within their main palaces, hanging jeweled canopies, burning hundred-fold fragrant incense, adorning hundred-jeweled seats, setting out hundred-flavored foods and drinks, scattering ten thousand kinds of named flowers, arranging hundreds and thousands of exquisite melodies, and offering all manner of treasures—gold, silver, pearls, jade, finest garments, brocades, silks, damasks, and all varieties of cloth.

For one hundred days, they recited and invoked this sutra, performing the Daoist circuit at the proper times, reverently bowing in worship, maintaining the fast, lighting lamps, and practicing without ceasing day or night. The kings, together with their queens, princes, chief ministers, and great officials, daily burned incense, scattered flowers, performed the Daoist circuit, made offerings, and repented. The men and women, subjects and officials of the realm, hearing that the king had established this field of merit, each aroused their resolve, donating their dwellings and all their possessions to purchase fragrant oils, fruits, flowers, finest garments, and all manner of ritual implements, coming to the palace gates to make offerings and provide for the Daoist priests. They wished for the kingdom’s peace and prosperity, the happiness of its people, and that their departed ancestors might escape suffering and ascend to heaven, enjoying carefree bliss.

The roads were filled with people, and the king did not restrict them, allowing them to follow their own hearts. Each person in the realm obtained the benefits of the Dharma, their lifespans lengthened, their clothing and food provided without effort, golden mushrooms and jade blossoms filled their gardens, phoenixes and peacocks played in the mountains and forests, and men and women rejoiced, devoted solely to reciting the sutra. At that time, the kings each lived for a thousand years before ascending to the upper realms, while the chief ministers and great officials each lived for eight hundred years, following in succession. For seven hundred kalpas, the people of the realm continued to practice the Dao.

The Dao Lord said: If a ruler faces calamity, recite and invoke this sutra; if there is flood, fire, or warfare, recite and invoke this sutra; if the stars and constellations lose their proper course, recite and invoke this sutra; if the sun or moon suffer eclipse, recite and invoke this sutra; if yin and yang are unbalanced, recite and invoke this sutra; if plague and pestilence spread, recite and invoke this sutra; if there is illness and death, recite and invoke this sutra; if malevolent spirits, specters, and demons confuse the people, recite and invoke this sutra; if venomous creatures and fierce beasts harm the multitudes, recite and invoke this sutra; if one is in prison, recite and invoke this sutra; if one is bound in shackles or fetters, recite and invoke this sutra. In all calamities and hardships, recite and invoke this sutra. If a person has passed away, recite and invoke this sutra to deliver the deceased, enabling them to ascend to the Land of Flourishing Joy. By constantly reciting this sutra, the nine generations of ancestors transcend suffering. For all who recite this sutra, the merit is boundless; each according to their capacity, their karmic transgressions are dissolved, they receive grace in life and death, the multitudes rejoice, and the world attains great peace.

The Dao Lord said: In the past, there was a person who upheld this sutra, reciting and invoking it day and night, never tiring in their heart.

While traveling through the mountains, one encountered a pack of fierce tigers surrounding them on all sides, lunging to attack and devour. Silently reciting this sutra, the tigers immediately scattered, and no harm befell the traveler. Again, there was a person journeying at sea when wind and waves surged violently, threatening to engulf them. Reciting and invoking this sutra, they reached the far shore, all returning safely. Another person had violated the king’s law and was bound in shackles. Reciting and invoking this sutra, the prison dissolved, and they escaped the lash. The merit and power of this sutra are of great might, beyond all conception. All of you, men and women, should with utmost sincerity and faith revere and uphold it, thereby attaining blessings and boundless prosperity.

**Chapter Nine: The Practice of the Dao-Way**

The Dao Lord said: If emperors, kings, the people of the land, and all sentient beings encounter calamities and hardships that must be dispelled, they should summon Daoist priests and female officials—whether a thousand or ten thousand, according to their number—to broadly establish a precious altar. They should hang banners and canopies, scatter flowers, burn incense, and light lamps to illuminate the space. Practicing the Dao-Way, performing rites of repentance, they should diligently observe the six periods of day and night without slackening, thereby attaining divine response and universal blessings.

The Dao Lord said: The dissemination of the Three Caverns has pervaded the human realm. The practice of the Dao-Way and the establishment of fasts were instituted according to ritual, long circulating between heaven and earth. Now, I reiterate them, briefly outlining their essential purport.

1. **Great Perfection (Tai Zhen)**: Universally aids heaven and humanity, delivering the living and transcending the dead, eradicating sins and dispelling disasters, invoking blessings and praying for grace, prolonging life and inscribing longevity, ascending on clouds and transforming through feathers—its dharma is wondrous, its merit profound. It is foremost in eternally transcending life and death.

2. **Golden Register (Jin Lu)**: When heaven and earth are in ruin, the sun and moon wane and wax, the seven luminaries deviate, the five planets lose their course, blades and warfare arise, water and fire rage, the sovereign faces peril, and pestilence spreads while yin and yang fall into disorder—it is foremost in pacifying the nation and securing the people.

3. **Yellow Register (Huang Lu)**: It delivers the myriad people, the billions of ancestors across generations, and the departed souls trapped in the Three Wretched Realms, sunk in the depths of kalpas. It lifts them from hell, liberating them from suffering to be reborn in heaven. It is foremost in rescuing and uplifting the hidden souls.

4. **Illuminating Perfection (Ming Zhen)**: It rectifies the divisions of heaven, regulates yin and yang, repels inauspicious calamities, and delivers the flying spirits. Heaven and humanity receive blessings, and in life and death, they receive grace. It is foremost in evoking responses from all heavens.

5. **Spontaneity (Zi Ran)**: It absolves transgressions, brings forth blessings, and extends longevity. It presents petitions to the heavens, transmits and bestows the dharma, and universally ferries men and women, all sentient beings. Its boundless karmic conditions are foremost.

6. **Three Primes (San Yuan)**: For scholars cultivating the self, praying for longevity and feathered transformation, delivering the seven generations of ancestors, and erasing the three officials’ records of death to ascend in rebirth and extend life—whether for oneself or others, it is foremost.

7. **Mud and Ashes (Tu Tan)**: For those in prison, afflicted by illness, or tormented by the suffering of hidden souls, whose agonies are unbearable and for whom myriad remedies fail—confessing and repenting their transgressions in life and death—it is foremost in resolving their perils.

8. **Cavern Spirit (Dong Shen)**: It commands heaven and earth, employs and directs divine spirits, transforms death into life, turns misfortune into fortune, with true numina secretly responding and the mysterious Dao-Way resonating. It is foremost in delivering all sentient beings.

9. **Divine Incantations (Shen Zhou)**: It drives away pestilence and sweeps away demonic spirits, dispelling evil and malevolence. It is foremost in this.

These nine are divided thus to accord with sentient beings, establishing their ranks and instructing the immortals in prohibitions and taboos. Universally benefiting heaven and humanity, their merits are equal.

Whether for three days, seven days, eight days, or a full year, one should burn incense, scatter flowers, practice the Dao-Way, recite this sutra, chant hymns of praise, and illuminate with bright lamps that penetrate all heavens. Making offerings to the Three Treasures, honoring and bestowing alms, and delivering heaven and humanity—such merit is towering and immeasurable.

The Dao Lord said: In the past, the kings of Zhen Ding, Nan He, Wu Liang, An Le, Xiao Yao, Zi Zai, Ping Deng, Qing Zheng, and Zun Sheng—on the same day, each established a form of the Dao-Way practice within their palace halls. They broadly summoned 3,200 Daoist priests, who raised banners and held canopies, walking in refined and elegant procession. Scattering flowers and burning incense, they practiced the Dao-Way and performed rites of repentance through the six periods of day and night. The kings, their queens, princes, ministers, and chancellors personally made offerings, preparing a hundred flavors of food and drink, burning a thousand measures of sacred incense, scattering ten thousand kinds of precious flowers, playing the flutes of the nine phoenixes, strumming the five-stringed zithers, piping the divine sheng of the sacred continent, and presenting the wondrous music of the Celestial Realm. They emptied their treasuries of gold, silver, pearls, jade, clothing, and utensils, bestowing alms and making offerings. They ordained the finest and most handsome men and women in the kingdom, those of keen intelligence and wisdom. Even the kings’ sons, princes, nobles, high ministers, and great officials—all were made to leave the household, numbering in the hundreds of millions. For a hundred days, the people of the land rejoiced without exception, praising and making offerings beyond conception. They gloriously upheld the Three Treasures in unparalleled splendor. For nine hundred years, this tradition was unbroken. Each king ascended as an immortal in the Brahma Heaven, while the queens, princes, and ministers each attained their blessings, all reborn in heaven, enjoying carefree bliss. Their merits were equal, without partiality. Thus, the nine forms of the Dao-Way practice are all foremost.

**Chapter Ten: The Vow of Vast Aspiration**

The Dao Lord said: Those who study the Dao, desiring to escape suffering and affliction, ascend to the realm of non-action, and wondrously enter the penetration of wisdom, should first vow with their heart. Once the heart’s vow is firm, aspiration follows, and through inner and outer resonance, the true numina respond. Cloud chariots and feathered carriages arrive of their own accord.

Upon reaching the Realm of Eternal Joy, one first encounters the True Constant.

The first vow: First serve the Original Teacher, the Most Supreme Dharma King—the Primordial Heavenly Worthy—whose true, responsive, and incarnate forms are the Boundless Great Dao. From body to body, kalpa after kalpa, one receives rebirth, steadfast and unwavering. Fashion their image, prostrate in worship, and make offerings as though before their true countenance.

The second vow: From the Great Canopy Heaven downward through the Three Realms and the ten directions, all immortals, perfected beings, and those who have entered the Dao-Way—let them all turn their hearts. Constantly serve the Original Teacher, burn incense, and maintain mindfulness without momentary lapse.

The third vow: For all sacred teachings—the Three Caverns, the Great Vehicle’s true Dao and wondrous meanings, the medicine for birth and death—let every word circulate to benefit humans and devas. All should be transcribed: in gold script and jade characters, on paper and silk, carved in stone, written in lacquer, or engraved in jade. Recite, chant, and prostrate in worship, with utmost devotion in the heart. Widely disseminate and propagate them, so their resonance pervades the Three Realms, universally enabling all to uphold them. In past and future, let none regress.

The fourth vow: Where sacred beings have left their transformative traces, where the Dharma has been taught and practiced, where the true Dao descends, and where immortals dwell—broadly establish numinous sanctuaries, erect great foundations of merit, and universally provide for humans and devas as refuges and abodes.

The fifth vow: When studying scriptures and receiving the Dharma, even a single thought of good affinity shapes my body, yielding benefit. Let all benevolent ones widely protect the Dharma gate, propagate the numinous sound, teach and transform the ignorant and benighted. Those who don the dark cap and yellow robe and leave the household life—let them all generate good thoughts, make offerings, prostrate in worship, inquire into wondrous meanings, and diligently persist without cease.

The sixth vow: From the Son of Heaven above to the common and foolish below, extending even to the Three Wretched Realms and all creeping creatures—first deliver them, universally liberating them from worldly toil, so all awaken to the utmost truth and accomplish the supreme Dao. Through these six vows, constantly pledge one’s own body. I shall fully perceive and ensure their deliverance.

The Dao Lord said: Long ago, the Emperor of Yellow-Piled Heaven was originally a commoner from the World of Abandoned Worthies, poor and lacking in clothing and food. He often hired himself out for labor, enduring hardship. Yet he constantly generated a good heart and took refuge in the Great Dao. I dispatched an incarnate perfected one to deliver him. For twenty-four years, he practiced the six vows, gaining wealth in clothing and food, and his diligence increased ten-thousandfold. Over two hundred years, I sent the Supreme Wondrous Perfected One to bestow upon him this scripture, and he attained immortality. Later, when a kalpa arrived and heaven and earth’s fate collapsed, he became the Emperor of Yellow-Piled Heaven.

The Fragrant Accumulation King was also a poor girl from the World of Abandoned Worthies, often hired for labor, yet her heart was devoted to the Dao. A Daoist, moved by her sincere prayers, bestowed upon her the Ten Precepts. She practiced the six vows and purified her six roots. After thirty-seven years, when a great flood arose, she transformed into a man, becoming wise and intelligent, with unparalleled appearance and bearing, and her family grew vastly wealthy. She established many meritorious deeds, made offerings to Daoists, transcribed scriptures, fashioned images, prostrated in worship, burned incense, gave alms to the poor, maintained purity, received precepts, practiced the Dao, and recited scriptures for twenty-eight years. Her merit reached far, and her resolve deepened. Over ninety years, she was reborn into the family of the Fragrant Accumulation King. At her birth, three phoenixes descended into the courtyard, lotuses surged forth, and the palace filled with fragrant aromas, suffusing the royal chambers and perfuming the air. For eighty years, she inherited the royal lineage, cherishing all beings with kindness, practicing purity and non-action, delighting in the Great Vehicle’s Three Cavern scriptures, and constantly discussing wondrous meanings with Daoists. She broadly delivered her people, all of whom were upright and complete, and sent many forth to leave the household life. She established numinous altars, performed great meritorious deeds, and upheld the six vows day and night with reverence. After five hundred years, I dispatched the Radiant Mystery Perfected One to deliver her, and now she is the Heavenly King of the Northern Perfected of the Great Clarity. Among those who have attained the Dao, as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, none have failed to practice the six vows, pledging their own hearts.

**Chapter Ten: The Vows**

The Dao Lord said: I have twelve supreme vows, transmitted to the world below to serve as a bridge across birth and death. If good men and good women can practice them, they shall surely attain their aspirations.

The first vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, obtain a human form, with all six senses complete, wisdom and intelligence, abundant clothing and sustenance, and a long lifespan.

The second vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, be born in the Central Kingdom, not among the border barbarians, always dwelling in peace, never suffering from blades, imprisonment, torture, or poisonous harm.

The third vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, encounter a sagely king, with the world at peace, the five grains abundant, the people at ease, all regions tranquil, and the realm free from strife.

The fourth vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, have parents, wife, children, and all kin united, never parted midway, with the household flourishing and descendants prospering.

The fifth vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, hear the scriptures and precepts, uphold, recite, and chant them, prostrate in worship, burn incense, make offerings, and protect and maintain them. May I penetrate the wondrous and mysterious, forever serving as good medicine to heal the ailing body, inwardly and outwardly cultivating refinement, and purifying the six senses.

The sixth vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, constantly encounter the flourishing of the Three Treasures’ great Dharma, with divine masters and numinous worthies expounding and teaching, universally enabling all to uphold it, serving as medicine for birth and death for humans and devas.

The seventh vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, encounter the nation’s ruler, great ministers, dukes, and high officials—along with empresses, consorts, and royal ladies—who establish great fields of merit, erect numinous altars, construct grand treasure halls, build great treasure terraces, cast great treasure bells, forge great treasure chimes, fashion great treasure seats, adorn golden towers and jade pavilions, with myriad halls and thousand galleries, embellished with the seven treasures, their four boundaries resplendent. May they transcribe scriptures, fashion images, and expound the Dharma to deliver people. Through this field of merit, may I attain deliverance.

The eighth vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, be able to leave the household life, don the dark cap and yellow robe, personally practice the scriptures and precepts, teach and transform the human realm, universally deliver sentient beings, and free them from birth and death.

The ninth vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, as a sovereign king, ruler of the people and land, and in the realms of the three evil destinies and five sufferings—wherever all sentient beings dwell—erect a hundred lofty thrones, broadly summon Daoist masters to expound the great vehicle of the Three Caverns’ scriptures, proclaim the profound and wondrous, so that all may attain understanding and awakening, and together enter the flow of the Dharma.

The tenth vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, constantly practice generosity, transcribe scriptures, fashion images, construct numinous sanctuaries, and broadly cultivate fields of merit. May I treat the aged, the sick, the poor, the cold and hungry, and even birds and beasts with perfect equality, never begrudging or hoarding.

The eleventh vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, witness the heavens and earth in serene tranquility, the sun and moon shining upon all, the stars moving in harmony, wind and rain arriving in due season, plants and trees unharmed, and the people joyful.

The twelfth vow: May I, in all the bodies I receive, the bodies I am born into, and the places where I am reborn, be born in a pure land, personally receive the wondrous Dharma, abide in effortless spontaneity, ride feathered carriages upon the clouds, embody the natural, and forever dwell in bliss.

The Dao Lord said: Long ago, Sovereign Xiao of the Heavenly Realm was a mortal of the lower world who constantly made offerings to Daoist masters, diligently and without negligence. The Daoist masters, mindful of his toil and suffering, taught him the twelve supreme vows and instructed him to uphold the scriptures and perform reverent prostrations. For seventeen years, he amassed great wealth and treasure, broadly cultivated fields of merit, transcribed the great vehicle scriptures of the Three Caverns in their entirety, along with all their cases and wrappings, adorned the treasure repository, and invited Daoist masters to collate, recite, and transmit them. For twelve years, his merit moved me, and I dispatched three jade lads of the Three Heavens to bestow upon him a body clad in golden radiance, born of golden light, with the power of spontaneous transformation, ever engaged in deliverance and teaching in the human realm. After seven hundred years, when the kalpa’s destruction arrived and heaven and earth dissolved, I again sent three jade lads in a nine-phoenix chariot to welcome him back to the Great Network, confer upon him this scripture, and appoint him as Sovereign Xiao of the Heavenly Realm.

**Chapter Twelve: Praise and Admiration**

The Dao Lord said: Good men and good women, upon seeing the nation’s ruler, the empress, royal consorts, princes, and high ministers give rise to great virtuous minds, you should all offer praise—such merit is inconceivable. If you see the establishment of oratories and the construction of numinous altars, you should offer praise, wishing for their swift completion. If you see Daoist masters and nuns being delivered, you should offer praise, that they may all be freed from suffering. If you see the fashioning of true and responsive transformation bodies, you should offer praise, that all may attain reverence. If you see the transcription of the Three Caverns’ sacred teachings, you should offer praise, that they may circulate for kalpas without end. If you see halls, towers, pavilions, and terraces, you should offer praise, that all may find refuge. If you see bells, chimes, gold, silver, bronze, and iron, you should offer praise, that they may awaken the deluded. If you see the exposition and proclamation of the wondrous principle, you should offer praise, that all may comprehend the profound and mysterious. If you see recitation, upholding, and offerings, you should offer praise, that they may awaken to the true Dao. If you see the performance of rituals, repentance, and prayers for blessings, you should offer praise, that their merit may universally spread. If you see the burning of incense, prostrations, and offerings, you should offer praise, that they may surely reach the Dao’s realm. If you see lamps lit to illuminate all, you should offer praise, that darkness may forever vanish. If you see the observance of purity and offerings to the true sages, you should offer praise, that all may partake in blessed connections. If you see the upholding of precepts with diligence and unflagging effort, you should offer praise, that the six senses may be perfected. If you see generosity extended to humans and devas alike, you should offer praise, that their merit and virtue may be towering. If you see diligence, with every thought sincere, you should offer praise, that they may never regress. If you see heroic courage in giving rise to great virtuous minds, you should offer praise, that they may surely attain the true Dao. If you see those who dwell at home constantly reciting scriptures and precepts, you should offer praise, that cloud-borne chariots may come to them. If you see those who dwell at home observing purity and upholding precepts, you should offer praise, that the highest sages may take notice. If you see those who have left the household life upholding and reciting scriptures, you should offer praise, that they may attain immortality. If you see those who have left the household life burning incense and performing rituals, you should offer praise, that their merit may surpass the heavens. If you see those in the mountains and forests contemplating the true and meditating on the Dao, you should offer praise, that jade maidens may come to welcome them. If you see flowers, fruits, clothing, and luminous pearls, you should offer praise, that they may be offered to the Heavenly Worthies. If you see men and women of fine and dignified appearance, you should offer praise, that they may all leave the household life. If you see all manner of virtuous causes and conditions, you should all offer praise, that they may gain benefit and profit.

Let all who seek universal deliverance know: praising virtuous causes and conditions exhorts sentient beings to perfect the mind of the Dao. The merit is boundless and inconceivable. Therefore, it is said that you should all offer praise.

**Chapter Thirteen: Generosity**

The Dao Lord said: Generosity has three grades, and its merit is boundless. Humans and devas gain great benefit—it is inconceivable.

The first is the generosity of the Dharma. Constantly employ the teachings of the Three Caverns’ scriptures of my Dao, with skillful means—whether provisional or real, detailed or concise—to guide and instruct sentient beings, that they may comprehend the true Way, together enter the One Vehicle, wholly abandon the snares of attachment, and ascend to the realm of eternal bliss. From kalpa to kalpa, constantly turn the Dharma wheel; in the past and future, never regress or abandon it. This is the foremost, inconceivable generosity.

The second is the generosity of the body. Constantly employ one’s body to relieve all beings—prisoners, the sick, those in water, fire, or the perils of blades and weapons—rescuing and protecting them in countless calamities with skillful means, sparing no bodily form. Whether cutting flesh to feed hawks, casting oneself to hungry tigers, or scattering offerings to birds, beasts, ants, insects, fish, and even mosquitoes, one should be without reluctance or stinginess.

Offering service to Daoist masters—providing for their needs, accompanying them in mountain travels to gather herbs, attending to their side, constructing and maintaining sacred temples, sweeping and cleansing halls, planting orchards and fruit groves, and performing all manner of meritorious deeds—one should act without thought of toil or hardship, ever unwavering and wholeheartedly devoted. Such virtue is vast and immeasurable, beyond all reckoning.

The generosity of wealth comprises two kinds of wholesome roots. The first is inner wealth: head, eyes, marrow, brain, hair, skin, and flesh—nothing is begrudged, all given to others. The second is outer wealth: kingdoms, cities, wives, children, servants, cattle, horses, gold, silver, pearls, jade, silks, brocades, ornaments, and garments—all scattered and bestowed without attachment of heart.

There are nine kinds of generosity, each yielding distinct merit according to the intention behind them, yet all bring benefit:

1. **Offering to those who embody the Dao**—true, responsive, or transformed images—brings worldly prosperity and virtue beyond measure. In past lives, one ascends to the heavens as an immortal, celestial robes adorning the body, befriended by true sages, and enters the Jade Clarity realm.

2. **Offering to scriptures and teachings**—the great vehicle of the Three Caverns—brings flourishing fortune and long life in this world. In the next life, one is reborn in heaven, enjoying bliss and effortless ease, attaining fruition and karmic reward, and entering the Upper Clarity realm.

3. **Offering to perfected immortals and sacred images** brings peace and joy in this life, with ever-increasing fortune and prosperity. In past lives, one transforms and is reborn in heaven, whereupon upholding scriptures and precepts, one ascends to the Great Clarity.

4. **Offering to mysterious altars, sacred temples, towering pavilions, halls, chambers, stairways, courtyards, jeweled canopies, and terraces** brings flourishing households and thriving descendants in this world. In past lives, one is reborn in the five directions, dwelling in pure lands, and after ten thousand kalpas, attains perfection.

5. **Offering to Daoist masters and nuns**—those who dwell in mountains and cultivate the Dao—providing for their monastic robes, ritual implements, and needs, brings the protection of benevolent spirits and natural abundance in this life. In past lives, one is reborn in the lineage of heavenly kings.

6. **Offering to monastic endowments**—incense, oil, lamps, candles, estates, and servants—brings the protection of demon kings, shielding one from calamities and hardships in this world. In past lives, one is reborn into a royal household, with refined features and long life.

7. **Offering bells, chimes, banners, flowers, canopies, seats, and ritual implements** brings the recording of one’s name by the heavens, protection from all misfortunes, joy among sons and daughters, and abundant clothing and food in this life. In past lives, one is reborn into a noble and prosperous family.

8. **Offering vegetarian meals** to those who embody the Dharma and leave the household life, as well as to the diligent and virtuous who uphold precepts and fasts, brings freedom from unjust harm, disasters of water, fire, blades, weapons, demonic afflictions, illnesses, and all manner of suffering in this life. One enjoys abundant clothing and food, and sons and daughters as pure as jade. In past lives, one is reborn into a wealthy and noble family.

9. **Offering to the poor, orphaned, widowed, hungry, cold, sick, imprisoned, lost in the wilderness, hungry ghosts, and beings of water and land—all sentient beings**—brings natural abundance of clothing and food in this life, auspicious blessings, freedom from calamities and obstacles, long life, physical completeness, ample provisions, wisdom, intelligence, and reverence from others.

Pǔjì again asked: "Today, I have heard the Heavenly Worthy expound from the golden mouth on the merit of generosity, bringing boundless blessings in life and death. Yet in ancient times, people did not practice generosity, each being self-sufficient, free from disasters, and living joyfully. Why now urge generosity? What is the cause and condition?"

The Dao Lord replied: "In ancient times, people were simple and honest, embracing the Dao and holding to virtue, neither greedy nor desirous, each content with their lot. With utmost sincerity alone, they could attain the Dao; generosity was unnecessary, for they naturally aligned with the heart of heaven. In this degenerate age, people are cunning and deceitful, seeking only wealth and treasure, ignorant of causes and conditions, valuing possessions over life, destroying kingdoms and families. Within, they harbor myriad evils; without, they form violent alliances, perishing in succession, never awakening. Thus, I now command them to give, so that inner thieves do not arise, outer thieves do not stir, and within and without, all is at peace, with calamities dissolved. Therefore, I urge generosity to break this stinginess and greed, allowing hidden virtues to connect, and rewards to follow according to merit.

Once, the King of Treasure Mountain was avaricious, hoarding gold, silver, pearls, jade, silks, brocades, carriages, horses, garments, ornaments, and playthings in boundless quantities, refusing to give. His exactions were endless; the people suffered hunger and cold, their resentment bitter. They gathered in rebellion, and from all sides, hostile armies advanced. The king, his queen, and their descendants were all slain, their treasures divided, their lineage extinguished, and a virtuous ruler enthroned in their place.

To the north of Good Love Mountain, five hundred men banded together, united in plunder, seizing wealth and slaughtering countless lives to gratify themselves. One day, the king’s law ensnared them, capturing their followers and families. Their hands and feet were severed, and they were cast into a pit, given a single meal each day, left to perish. Such greed and miserliness, destroying kingdoms and families, knows no distinction between wise and foolish—countless are the examples. Whether madness arises within or bandits attack from without, the world remains deluded, unable to awaken. Thus, I compassionately urge them to give, removing the boundless afflictions of sentient beings."

The Dao Lord said: "The Perfected of the Great Ultimate, at the dawn of the Red Clarity kalpa, was a Daoist master who received scriptures and precepts. He aroused the great mind, enlightening all beings, expounding profound teachings, and instructing sentient beings without distinction, tirelessly transmitting scriptures and precepts, guiding the deluded. His merit moved the heavens, and his name was inscribed in the golden registers. For one hundred and eighty years, he departed through corpse liberation, transforming his form to return as a Daoist master. Even more diligently, he continued his labors, aiding those in the lower realms. For sixty years, he was reborn into a royal household."

The Perfected amassed great merit, aiding the poor and succoring the dead, widely establishing good deeds. For three hundred years, he dwelt in the scripture hall by day, and at last his body transformed in celestial fire, ascending through the void. I dispatched a nine-phoenix jade chariot to welcome him into the Four Brahma Heavens, where he received the Dao of transformation and corpse liberation.

Reborn again into the household of King Miaoxi, he further cultivated merit, ascending to heaven in broad daylight to become the Perfected of the Great Ultimate. Through one hundred and eight cycles of birth, death, and transformation—some brief, some long—spanning over thirty thousand years, he widely bestowed precepts and dharma, ultimately attaining perfection and realization.

Formerly, King Shengxi of the Heaven of Joy, moved by compassion for sentient beings, governed his kingdom for thirty-three years. He cast himself before a starving tiger, instantly transforming his form to be reborn in a noble land. Within sixteen years, he ascended to the throne; at twenty-six, he carved his flesh to feed a hawk and cast himself into the jaws of a great sea turtle. His form dissolved into rising smoke, ascending straight into the clouds, where he became a heavenly maiden, receiving in full the Three Caverns’ treasure scriptures.

Descending to the kingdom of Dongming, his countenance was upright and his appearance foremost in excellence. At just six years of age, he began a lifelong fast, observed the precepts, and recited scriptures in seclusion, withdrawing from worldly affairs. The king, moved by his devotion, made him a female Daoist adept, establishing an abbey within the palace and constructing the Tower of Soaring Clarity. Ascending the tower, she nourished herself by nasal absorption, taking no food. After four hundred and nine years, the Eight Winds came to welcome her, and she became the Spirit Consort of the Western Clarity, attended by twenty-four jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens, traveling in a celestial wheel through the gate of heaven. After forty-eight thousand years, she transformed into the Perfected of Radiant Emptiness.

Formerly, the king of Anbao widely distributed wealth and treasure, rescuing the poor and delivering the dying, broadly aiding the people, his kindness extending even to grasses and trees. He provided Daoist masters with robes, ritual implements, servants, staffs, and all manner of necessities. For five hundred years, his form reverted to youth as he amassed great merit, releasing and ransoming lives. After more than seven hundred years, he achieved corpse liberation and ascended as an immortal, entering Mount Penglai to cultivate the Dao of inner contemplation. Serene and profoundly still, his body entered non-action. After eighteen thousand years, he became the Perfected of Luminous Countenance.

Such examples are as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges, beyond count or recounting. I have roughly cited but one or two to serve as encouragement. You would do well to remember them.

*Thus concludes the fifth scroll of the Supreme Cavernous Numinous Treasure Karma and Causation Sutra.*

*The sixth scroll of the Supreme Cavernous Numinous Treasure Karma and Causation Sutra.*

**Chapter Fourteen: Compassionate Relief**

The Perfected of Universal Compassion and Relief, moved by the karmic retributions and causal conditions, inquired of the Most High. At that time, the Most High Lord of the Dao spoke:

"Good men and good women who constantly practice compassion, mindfully deliver all beings, bestow wealth and teach the Dharma, widely rescue sentient beings, and skillfully generate the aspiration for enlightenment—all these bring boundless and immeasurable karmic rewards in future lives.

To carve flesh from one’s body, exhaust one’s resources, accumulate treasures, and perpetually create fields of merit; to distribute clothing and food without discrimination, bestowing equally upon the worthy and unworthy, extending even to birds and beasts, to all creatures that move and possess life—relieving their hunger and cold is the foremost of deeds.

Moreover, to dig wells by the roadside, establish halls of righteousness, plant orchards of fruit trees, and nurture the weary and suffering; to construct bridges across mountains and valleys and along rivers, facilitating travelers with tireless diligence—such acts will be welcomed by the host of sages.

The Lord of the Dao said: Long ago, there was a worthy one who constantly practiced compassion, subsisting on vegetables and wearing humble garments. He exhausted his family’s wealth to establish vast fields of merit, rescuing and aiding all beings. After twenty-three years, I dispatched the Perfected of Compassion to deliver him into the Golden Radiance Mountain, where he received scriptures and teachings. After six hundred and forty years, he encountered a celestial fire that transformed his form, and he was reborn at the gates of the Luminous Clarity Kingdom. After twenty-three years, he ascended the throne, his glory surpassing that of his former life, and he performed great meritorious deeds. After eighty-three years, I sent the Perfected of Formlessness to bestow upon him the *True Scripture of Supreme Clarity*. After twenty-four years of cultivation, his merit complete and his practice fulfilled, he ascended in broad daylight, becoming one of the Four Brahmā Immortals.

There was another worthy one who established halls of righteousness and nurtured the weary and suffering. After one hundred years, I dispatched the Perfected of Mystic Unity to confer upon him this scripture, commanding him to recite and contemplate it. Within eight years, his aged appearance reverted to youth, his face took on a jade-like complexion, his compassion deepened, and he toiled tirelessly. After thirty-seven years, I sent two Jade Maidens of Longevity to bestow upon him the elixir of extended life. Upon consuming it, he gained a lifespan of ten thousand years and now serves as the Perfected of Radiant Empyrean.

There was also a woman who planted orchards of fruit trees and distributed clothing to travelers without discrimination. After fifty years, I dispatched the Messengers of Wind and Thunder to transform her into a man, allowing her to continue her former deeds. After one hundred years, I sent the Nine-Dragon Jade Maidens to bestow upon her the true scriptures. After thirteen years of cultivation, golden mushrooms sprouted in her courtyard, phoenixes descended to attend her, and celestial robes arrived of their own accord. After another seventeen years, I sent the Youth of Great Mystery in a single-wheeled chariot to welcome her, ascending to the Heaven of August Gourd, where she became the Master of the Jade Chart.

Furthermore, the queen of the Pure Tranquility Kingdom constantly practiced almsgiving and universally relieved sentient beings. After one hundred years, I dispatched the Jade Maiden of the Upper Prime to bestow upon her the *True Scripture of the Mysterious Spirit*, ordaining her as a female Daoist adept. After thirty-six years, I sent the Transfiguration Youth to refine her form with fire, restoring her youthful countenance. After another twenty years, I sent the Perfected of the Radiant Empyrean to confer upon her the *Precious Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery*. After six hundred years of cultivation, I dispatched the Perfected of the Upper Prime in a cloud chariot drawn by eight simurghs to welcome her, and she now serves as the Jade Maiden of the Upper Prime.

There was also the prince of the Pure Wonder Kingdom who constantly practiced compassion, personally constructing bridges to relieve the toil of others. After fifteen years, I sent the Perfected of Salvation to bestow upon him this scripture. After seven years of devotion, his diligence intensified. Within seventeen years, lotuses sprouted from the earth, each blossom a thousand-petaled and spanning twelve feet in width. Upon the petals appeared scriptures, jeweled caskets, treasured relics, fragrant elixirs, and immortal medicines. Jade youths and maidens bore them aloft, surrounding him on all sides in wondrous and inconceivable display. The prince’s sincerity deepened, his resolve unshakable. After forty years, I sent the Nine-Light Youth to ordain him as a Daoist adept and bestow upon him the *Wondrous Scripture of Ascending Mystery*. Day and night, he toiled with diligence beyond measure, like the sands of the Ganges, beyond recounting.

All you men and women, if you can widely practice compassion and deliver all sentient beings, great and small alike, I shall know of it. Yet if you begin but do not persevere, or if you cannot endure hardship and temporarily retreat before your merit is complete, take heed and redouble your efforts."

**Chapter Fifteen: Salvation from Suffering**

The Lord of the Dao addressed the Perfected of Universal Relief:

"I constantly contemplate sentient beings trapped in the Three Wretched Realms and the Ten Evils, ensnared by demonic spirits, malevolent ghosts, perverse deities, venomous creatures, fierce beasts, blades and warfare, flood and fire, shackles and prisons, illness and agony—unable to find peace. I have revealed the Three Caverns’ scriptures, precepts, and salvific teachings to rescue and protect them. I have also transmitted seven thousand talismans and four thousand divine incantations to the Perfected Ones, the Celestial Emperors, the Perfected of Salvation, the Great Demon Kings of the Three Heavens, and the Great Demon Kings of the Five Heavens, dispersing them throughout the world to rescue and protect all beings, ensuring their safety.

Yet sentient beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize sin and merit. They indulge their six senses, killing living beings, stealing, engaging in licentiousness and debauchery, harboring greed, anger, and delusion, uttering deceitful words, slander, and divisive speech, devouring other beings, violating fasts and precepts, defying heaven and earth, turning from the upright to the perverse, and sacrificing to ghosts and spirits. Their sins are rampant, and they possess not a shred of goodness. Thus, poisonous winds and malevolent *qi*, along with the demonic hordes of the Six Heavens, pervade the human realm, spreading slaughter and harm, causing countless deaths day and night—yet they remain unaware.

Therefore, I constantly dispatch the Lords of the Celestial Emperors, the Ten Ultimate Immortals, and the officials of the Three Realms and Four Offices to traverse the mortal world, delivering sentient beings throughout heaven and earth—though few are aware of it. Now, I reveal to you the methods of salvation, which you should practice.

Regularly, on the first, fifteenth, and final days of each lunar month, instruct all men and women to abstain from wine and meat, restrain their six senses, maintain purity, and burn incense. In their homes and at the sacred altars and numinous temples, they should observe fasts, receive precepts, recite this scripture, perform the Six-Period Circumambulation, and reverently pay homage."

With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Merciful and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the East.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Life-Cherishing and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the South.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Impartial and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the West.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Greatly Compassionate and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the North.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Universally Salvific and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Boundless and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Equanimous and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Benevolent and Transformative Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Pervasively Compassionate and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the Above.
With utmost reverence, pay homage to the Vastly Salvific and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy of the Below.

After reverently paying homage, each prostrates, kowtows, and kneels long, lying prone upon the ground, and thrice recites:
"Supreme and Most Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions who relieves suffering, your disciple [Name], a mere mortal of this day, has for kalpas uncounted sunk into the depths of sin and suffering. I have committed manifold evil deeds—taking life, theft, sexual misconduct, wantonness, stinginess, greed, anger, ignorance, delusion, harsh speech, divisive words, frivolous talk, falsehood, devouring sentient beings, breaking fasts and precepts, defying heaven and earth—my roots of sin are innumerable, beyond reckoning.

I humbly beseech the Supreme and Most Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions who relieves suffering to pardon my ignorance and grant me purity, even unto all hardships and pains.

Whether in one’s home or at numinous altars and sacred temples, if one can openly confess and repent of one’s own transgressions, I shall dispatch the celestial officials to traverse and inspect the numinous bureaus, immediately erasing the records of sin and sparing one from suffering and calamity.

If one cannot perform this oneself, one should invite Daoist priests or nuns to earnestly pray, pay homage, and make offerings, coming to one’s home or place of residence. One may offer clothing, bedding, toys, fruits, food, incense, oil, vessels, camels, mules, oxen, or horses—whatever one possesses—to express one’s sincerity. The benevolent spirits will descend at once, and disaster and suffering will be averted.

If one can invite Daoist priests or nuns into one’s home, according to one’s means, or go to the sacred temples and numinous altars to recite this scripture, or copy hundreds, thousands, or even myriad volumes, according to one’s capacity, and offer material support, establish fasts, receive precepts, look up to the lofty perfected ones, pay homage, repent, light lamps, burn incense, and persist day and night without cease, I shall dispatch the Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings to deliver one from calamity and lead one out of the sea of suffering.

This method of salvation is foremost.

If emperors, kings, sovereigns, chief ministers, princes, consorts, imperial children, or royal descendants—for the sake of their parents, themselves, wives, children, or living or deceased kin—seek salvation, they should broadly summon Daoist priests without limit. In the main halls of palaces, inner chambers, city walls, residences, sacred temples, or numinous altars, they should recite this scripture, observe fasts, receive precepts, pay homage, repent, circumambulate, chant, burn incense, light lamps, distribute alms of wealth, clothing, bedding, gold, silver, pearls, jade, silks, brocades, servants, carriages, horses, banners, canopies, curtains, and seats, release living beings to extend life, and broadly establish fields of merit. For seven days and nights, or even a hundred days, a full month, or a whole year—without limit to the time—persist earnestly without retreat. I shall dispatch the Ten Perfected Ones of Heaven and the Five Emperors of the Four Bureaus to descend and traverse, examining merits and transgressions. The ill shall recover, the dead shall live, the distressed shall be delivered, the bound shall be freed, the living shall gain fortune, and all calamities—water, fire, blades, weapons, tigers, wolves, venomous beasts, malevolent spirits, and spectral beings—shall never afflict them. Their years shall be long, and each shall dwell in peace.

If the deceased have passed, they shall immediately depart the Nine Dark Hells, the mountains of knives, the forests of swords, the cauldrons of boiling water, and the torments of flogging, ascending to the heavens to dwell in carefree non-action. Their homes shall be pure and auspicious.

If faithful men and women revere the Three Treasures and cultivate merit, their virtue shall be inconceivable.

If Daoist priests, nuns, or any men and women of good heart recite this scripture for emperors, kings, sovereigns, the people, the land, and all sentient beings, delivering the multitudes, they shall attain peace and happiness in this life and ascend to heaven in the next.

If warfare arises on all sides, harming the multitudes, reciting this scripture shall cause the evil bandits to retreat and disperse, sparing all from harm.

If epidemics and poisons spread, afflicting the people with illness, reciting this scripture shall dispel them, and the multitudes shall dwell in peace.

If floods, droughts, locusts, unseasonable winds and rains, or blight harm the five grains, reciting this scripture shall bring timely winds and rains, the realm shall be pure and peaceful, the people harmonious and content, flowers and fruits flourishing, and all grasses lush.

If malignant winds, poisonous vapors, fierce beasts, snakes, or insects harm people, reciting this scripture shall cause them all to scatter and flee.

If a woman is with child and struggles in labor, reciting this scripture shall bring safe and easy delivery.

If palaces, halls, residences, or dwellings are troubled by malevolent spirits, spectral beings, lingering dead, or stagnant qi, reciting this scripture shall bring peace and tranquility.

The merit of reciting this scripture is inconceivable—it protects the state and pacifies the home, harmonizes heaven and stabilizes earth, saves the multitudes, and sows boundless fields of merit."

The Dao Lord said: "Long ago, King Linghe was afflicted with illness, and for a hundred days, his life hung by a thread. The crown prince, queen, ministers, consorts, and princesses kept vigil day and night, at a loss for what to do. A Daoist priest, ever compassionate, spoke of the merit and power of this scripture, so great that it could save the king’s life. He summoned over a thousand Daoist priests and nuns, who before the royal hall hung images and banners, adorned with multicolored canopies and five-hued streamers, arrayed seven-jeweled thrones, burned priceless incense, and lit dragon-and-phoenix lamps and candles, presenting manifold offerings in grand display."

Releasing life to prolong fate, scattering wealth and treasures to relieve the destitute, the impoverished, the distressed, the widowed, the orphaned, the childless, the helpless, the starving, the crippled, and the infirm—all were bestowed with alms and salvation. Scriptures were transcribed, images crafted, and temples established to deliver the people. Within seven days, the merit was boundless. I dispatched the True Person Who Delivers from Tribulation, riding a cloud-chariot of threefold purity, accompanied by a host of divine youths, to descend and grant deliverance, sparing them from suffering and restoring health at once.

The king, together with the queen, the crown prince, the consorts, and the ministers, conferred among themselves: "Can today’s blessings not be attributed to the power of the Great Dao and the true scripture?" Thereupon, they summoned Daoist priests and nuns in vast numbers—over a million from across the realm—to establish a grand ritual arena, erecting a million lofty thrones. They expounded the Great Vehicle, burned incense, scattered flowers, circumambulated the ritual space, chanted sacred verses, kindled lamps to illuminate the scene, and strewed precious blossoms. They widely delivered the people—men and women alike—as well as the king’s sons and upright ministers of civil and martial ranks who harbored devotion to the Dao, all made to renounce the household life. For a hundred days, they toiled day and night without weariness, and their merit moved Heaven. I sent ten Radiant True Persons to descend in unison, arriving at the ritual arena to burn incense, scatter flowers, observe the Dharma teachings, and deliver them, inscribing their names in the Register of Immortality.

At that time, the king awakened to the Great Dao, establishing many temples and delivering the people. He commissioned countless images of the Heavenly Worthy, transcribed the sacred titles of this scripture in vast numbers, crafted innumerable banners and canopies, and distributed boundless Dharma robes. He made offerings to the Three Treasures, bestowed alms upon Daoist priests and nuns, and all the virtuous companions gathered there, thus sowing fields of merit on a grand scale. For seventy years, he continued as before, never severing his roots of goodness. I dispatched ten Heavenly True Persons to descend together, each riding a nine-dragon chariot, attended by jade maidens, bearing standards and banners, to deliver them into the Penglai Mountains, where they cultivated the true Dao. Now, they have become Perfected Lords of the Supreme Ultimate.

Long ago, the King of Fragrant Accumulation was besieged by bandits. For two months, the people suffered hardship, at a loss for what to do. A minister spoke of this precious scripture, its awe-inspiring power beyond conception. The king heeded the minister’s words and summoned Daoist priests to recite this scripture. Within three days, the king and his ministers concentrated their minds in reverent prayer to the Three Clarities, the August Jade Emperor, and the Lofty Perfected, prostrating in silent contemplation of the Three Treasures with unwavering devotion. Their sincerity moved me, and I dispatched five Heavenly Generals, each leading a hundred million divine soldiers, to descend at once and rescue the King of Fragrant Accumulation. The wicked bandits scattered in an instant, and not a single person among the populace was harmed.

Thereupon, the king undertook vast merit-making, establishing temples to deliver the people and repay the Dao’s grace, diligently practicing the scriptures and precepts. For three hundred years, I sent the True Person Who Surveys Fate, riding a six-dragon chariot, to deliver him into the Golden Brilliance Mountains, where he was taught to recite this scripture. After five hundred years, he became an Immortal of the Central Marchmount.

Once, a worthy man ventured into the sea to gather treasures when suddenly a fierce wind arose, stirring the waves violently, leaving him unable to find peace. As he recited this scripture, I dispatched the True Person Who Relieves Suffering, commanding the Nine Sea Dragon Kings and the Eight Wind Envoys to subdue the winds and waters, guiding him safely to the far shore, where all found peace.

Another time, a woman in labor could not deliver, her life hanging by a thread. As she recited this scripture, I sent the True Person Who Saves from Suffering, riding an eight-wheeled cloud-chariot, to deliver her, and she was restored to safety at once.

I have dispatched the Left Attendant True Person and countless others—some appearing as Daoist priests, others as ordinary folk—who uphold the scriptures and precepts, wield talismans, and administer medicinal decoctions, scattered throughout the world to rescue and protect all beings. You, men and women, cannot distinguish them. Yet whenever virtuous people employ even a single word or phrase from my scripture’s teachings, prohibitions, talismans, or incantations to benefit beings, I will shield and empower them. You, men and women, should each believe in this.

The Dao Lord said: Once, a woman lived near a great mountain and was bewitched by a tiger spirit. For twenty years, a Daoist priest performed incantations, inscribed talismans, and had her recite scriptures and receive precepts. The woman had previously borne four sons, each transformed into tiger forms, but all were dissolved and dispersed, and her illness was cured. The woman then took the precepts from the Daoist priest and upheld the scriptures, and now resides in the Golden Flower Mountains, having lived for eight thousand years.

Another woman lived by a great river and was enchanted by a clam spirit. For thirty-five years, a Daoist priest recited incantations and inscribed talismans, and the spirit reverted to its true form, dissolving into a flow of blood, while the woman was restored to her original state.

Yet another woman dwelled beside a vast marsh, often accompanied by four beautiful maidens, roaming together. Sometimes they entered the water, other times they soared into the trees, now large, now small, now eating, now fasting, transforming at will. People called them sages or immortals, yet for thirteen years, none could fathom their nature. Suddenly, a Daoist priest arrived to observe them and discerned they were not true immortals. He recited scriptures, administered precepts, chanted incantations, and inscribed talismans, whereupon the women transformed into great serpents. The priest cast a talisman at each, and they turned to fire, reduced to ashes in an instant.

In another household, music and singing were often heard in the night from the empty sky. In a moment, dragons or phoenixes, men or women, would appear, soaring and playing amidst the trees with boundless freedom. For three years, no one could identify them. Then a Daoist priest arrived, reciting scriptures and performing rituals, chanting incantations and inscribing talismans. He burned the talismans to ash and blew them toward the sky. The spirits descended at once, collapsing to the ground and transforming into foxes, prostrating before the priest. The priest sprinkled water upon them, and they became plants, withering and rotting in moments.

Another man’s abdomen swelled like a drum, and he drank three *shi* of water daily. For seven years, physicians could not cure him.

The Daoist priest inscribed talismans and recited scriptures, leading the man in repentance and receiving the precepts. The man vomited over a hundred small fish, and his condition returned to normal.

Another man consumed only filth, five or six *dou* daily, for twenty-three years, and people found his presence unbearable. The Daoist priest said to him, "In your past life, you indulged in lust and excreted waste in the sacred altar chamber, leaving it unclean and foul. Now you receive this retribution. You must swiftly repent, receive the precepts, and diligently cultivate without regression." Thereupon, the man went before the Daoist priest, sincerely repenting and upholding the fasts and precepts. The priest cast a talisman into water, and after the man drank it, he vomited over a thousand dung beetles, then recovered as before.

Another man daily consumed a handful of foul grass, suffering constant abdominal pain for eight years. The Daoist priest said to him, "In your past life, you devoured living beings, and now you receive this retribution. Simply confess your faults." The man immediately admitted his transgressions, vowing to serve as a lowly servant to the Daoist priest, enduring hardship without complaint. The priest then recited scriptures and administered the precepts. For seven days and nights, he sprayed talismanic water and chanted incantations, and the man transformed into an ox. After a hundred days, the man regained knowledge of his past lives. The priest burned a talisman for refining form and spirit in fire, restoring his original form. From then on, he received the true scriptures and was commanded to uphold them for life.

Such cases are beyond counting. I scatter my Dao-qi without limit, pervading the five billion boundless worlds of the heavens, distributing my numinous essence to establish offices and oversee the registers of life and death for men and women, clearly distinguishing good and evil. In each heaven, there are Heavenly Emperors, the Four Pole Heavenly Masters, the Ten Radiant Perfected, the Life-Inspecting Lads, and the Controllers of Good and Evil, who record merits and sins, knowing even the most minute details. Just as a king governs all under heaven—its people, mountains, rivers, and grasses—so too do I perceive all. Nothing escapes my knowledge.

Pujì asked, "The Heavenly Worthy earlier said that if a ruler faces calamity—war erupting on all sides, celestial bodies falling out of alignment, wind and rain failing to harmonize, crops failing to grow, the people suffering epidemics, and the land in turmoil—when establishing palaces and temples, bearing children, mobilizing armies, or undertaking any endeavor, if misfortune or inauspicious signs arise, one should appeal to me and perform great meritorious deeds: copying scriptures, creating images, establishing temples to ordain people, offering treasures, curios, variegated silks, valuables, gold, silver, pearls, jade, fields, houses, palaces, and gardens as alms, dedicating them to the Three Treasures’ field of blessings; delivering sentient beings, rescuing those in peril, releasing prisoners, holding fasts and precepts, setting up hundreds of high seats, expounding the profound and wondrous meanings of the Great Vehicle, exhorting the people to listen to the Dharma, practicing almsgiving and repentance, and performing inconceivable meritorious deeds of salvation and protection. Yet sentient beings are weak and feeble, their capacities unequal. Even if they cultivate, they may not discern clearly; though they perform one deed, they fear calamities will not be dispelled, wavering in doubt, unable to see clearly. May I ask: do the meritorious deeds of salvation and protection have gradations?"

The Dao Lord answered Pujì, "Salvation and deliverance from calamity fundamentally depend on utmost sincerity; almsgiving and relinquishing wealth test the sincerity of one’s heart. Since sentient beings’ perceptions vary in depth, the power of blessings they attain also differs in weight. Now, I shall roughly explain the five kinds.

The first is creating true images of me, manifesting in response to transformations. Blessings flow through kalpas, and the sublime retribution is boundless. Why? Sentient beings’ deluded thoughts cannot be restrained, but gazing upon my true image gives rise to contemplation. Once contemplation arises, true numen descends to connect; with single-minded devotion, one attains the fruit of non-action. Among deeds of salvation, this is foremost.

The second is copying the scriptural teachings of the Three Caverns and the Great Vehicle. Blessings flow through eternal kalpas, and the merit is infinite. Why? The scriptures are my legacy, guiding the deluded and ignorant, awakening boundless Dao-mind in sentient beings. From delusion arises awakening, and through awakening, one becomes true. All sages cultivate and attain the Dao’s fruit. Among deeds of salvation, this is second.

The third is establishing temples to ordain people, building halls and sanctuaries. Blessings flow through kalpas, and the merit is inconceivable. Why? When one person leaves the household life to maintain scriptures and images, teaching and transforming sentient beings, inspiring them to awaken the Dao-mind, one enlightens ten thousand. Through the wheel of karmic conditions, one assists the state and transforms the people, propagating the Dao and illuminating the Dharma, yielding the greatest benefit. Among deeds of salvation, this is third.

The fourth is observing fasts, practicing the Dao, performing rites of repentance, reciting scriptures, offering praises, and burning incense. The field of blessings is immeasurable. Why? Fasts purify the heart, and the Dao enables resonance. Practicing them atones for sins and aligns with prayers for grace. The merit moves the heavens, dispelling calamities and bestowing blessings. In life and death, one relies on fasts and precepts. Among deeds of salvation, this is fourth.

The fifth is almsgiving in all its forms, an immeasurable field of blessings. The karmic retribution is towering, truly profound and abundant. Why? Wealth is the lifeblood of sentient beings, difficult to relinquish even for oneself. To give up wealth and life without stinginess, broadly establishing merit, universally aiding sentient beings, inwardly stilling miserliness and greed, outwardly eliminating bandits and thieves—this benefits humans and gods, and in life and death, one receives grace. Among deeds of salvation, this is fifth.

Diligently practicing these brings boundless blessings."

**Chapter Sixteen: Meritorious Deeds**

The Greatly Compassionate and Universally Salvific Perfected One, Pujì, inquired of the Supreme Dao Lord regarding karma, retribution, causes, and conditions.

At that time, the Supreme Dao Lord told Pujì, "Long ago, at the beginning of the Red Clarity Kalpa, I was at the Southern Vermilion Cavern, beside the Fire-Refining Pool of the Kaiyang Upper Observatory, where I convened a great assembly with the Primordial Heavenly Worthy to expound the Dharma and broadly deliver the heavens."

At that time, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings, leading their retinues and countless beings from their realms, reverently held incense and flowers to make offerings to the Three Treasures. The Supreme Master of the Primordial Beginning and all the sagely listeners of the Dharma each took their places on one side. The Primordial Beginning then emitted from between his brows a thousand kinds of radiance, which shone through the ten directions and illuminated boundless lands, universally enabling all to hear and know, that they might come together and assemble, broadly proclaiming the numinous sound to universally benefit beings with merit and virtue.

At that moment, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord of the Eastern World, leading his retinues and countless beings from his realm, arrived at the assembly and took his place on the eastern side. There he established ten Dharma thrones, adorned with a hundred treasures, crowned with ninefold luminous canopies and tenfold divine banners, with azure standards and azure streamers, azure cushions and azure mats. Divine dragons and celestial music encircled him on all sides. He burned incense and scattered flowers, with ninefold luminous candles and fourfold bright divine lamps numbering in the hundreds of millions, illuminating all before him.

There he established ten Dharma thrones, adorned with ten thousand kinds of ornaments, crowned with threefold bright canopies and sixfold divine banners, with vermilion flags and vermilion streamers, crimson seats and crimson mats. Nine phoenixes played cinnabar strings, encircling him on all sides. He burned incense and scattered flowers, with floral candles casting light in four directions and eightfold lotus lamps numbering in the hundreds of millions, blazing brilliantly before him.

He burned incense and scattered flowers, with rosy dawn lamps casting eightfold flames and cloud candles emitting ninefold radiance numbering in the hundreds of millions, resplendent before him.

The Five Qi Heavenly Lord of the Northern World, leading his retinues and countless beings from his realm, arrived at the assembly and took his place on the northern side. There he established ten Dharma thrones, adorned with five colors, crowned with eightfold divine canopies and sevenfold bright immortal parasols, with black streamers and dark banners, brocade-patterned mats. Black tortoises struck chimes, encircling him on all sides. He burned incense and scattered flowers, with simurgh candles casting a thousand blossoms and scale-patterned lamps emitting ten thousand flames numbering in the hundreds of millions, dazzling before him.

The Lord of the Beginning Azure Heaven of the Northeast World, leading his retinues and countless beings from his realm, arrived at the assembly and took his place in his direction. There he established ten Dharma thrones, all adorned with azure jade, crowned with flying azure canopies and azure cloud banners, with jadeite standards and jadeite flags, indigo mats and indigo cushions. Heavenly immortals played music, encircling him on all sides. He burned incense and scattered brilliant flowers, with divine candles casting empty brightness and numinous lamps emitting floating flames numbering in the hundreds of millions, blazing brilliantly before him.

The Lord of the Beginning Vermilion Heaven of the Southeast World, leading his retinues and countless beings from his realm, arrived at the assembly and took his place in his direction. There he established ten Dharma thrones, all adorned with red treasures, crowned with red lotus canopies and red valley banners, with red flags and red streamers, red mats and red cushions. Immortal youths performed music, encircling him on all sides. He burned incense and scattered flowers, with nine-colored celestial light and tenfold numinous smoke numbering in the hundreds of millions, illuminating all before him.

The Lord of the Beginning Pale Heaven of the Southwest World, leading his retinues and countless beings from his realm, arrived at the assembly and took his place in his direction. There he established ten Dharma thrones, all adorned with pale jade, crowned with pale cloud canopies and pale luminous banners, with floral standards and floral streamers, floral mats and floral seats. Jade maidens played music, encircling him on all sides. He burned incense and scattered flowers, with floating flames scattering like stars and flowing light like flying blossoms numbering in the hundreds of millions, glowing brilliantly before him.

The Lord of the Beginning Dark Heaven of the Northwest World, leading his retinues and countless beings from his realm, arrived at the assembly and took his place in his direction. There he established ten Dharma thrones, all adorned with various treasures, crowned with wheel-turning celestial canopies and luminous banners containing the radiance of the sun, with purple streamers and purple banners, green mats and green seats. Golden youths played music, encircling him on all sides. He burned incense and scattered flowers, with dragon candles emitting ten thousand flames and mandarin-duck lamps casting a thousand lights numbering in the hundreds of millions, scattering brilliance before him.

The Upper Prime Heavenly Lord of the World Above, leading all the sagely hosts and countless heavenly immortals, arrived at the assembly and took his place at the front. There he established ten Dharma thrones, adorned with ten thousand treasures, crowned with ten thousand colored floral banners and ten thousand lotus canopies, with dragon flags and phoenix standards, cloud brocade and frost-like gauze. Celestial music filled the sky, encircling him on all sides. He scattered flowers and burned incense, with floral lamps emitting ten thousand flames and lotus candles casting a thousand lights beyond reckoning, filling all before him.

The Lower Prime Heavenly Lord of the World Below, leading his retinues and countless beings from his realm, arrived at the assembly and took his place on the left and right. There he established ten Dharma thrones, adorned with yellow jade, crowned with empty-brightness flying canopies and hundredfold revolving divine banners, with pearl-ornamented flags and jade decorations, brocade seats and floral mats. Flying immortals played music, encircling him on all sides. He scattered flowers and burned incense, with golden lamps casting ten thousand lights and gem-studded candles emitting a thousand radiance numbering in the hundreds of millions, shining brightly before him.

The ten heavens arrived, adorned with a hundred treasures, their inner and outer brilliance illuminating heaven and earth. Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning commanded the Perfected Ones of Compassion and Mercy, Wondrous Awakening, Compassionate Kindness, Kind Countenance, Luminous Understanding, Good Awakening, Compassionate Mindfulness, Wisdom Contemplation, Compassionate Love, and Constant Joy to ascend the eastern Dharma throne.

The Perfected Ones of Compassionate Contemplation, Equal Salvation, Empty Kindness, Jeweled Countenance, Mysterious Awakening, Empty Brightness, Perfect Quiescence, Equal Countenance, Compassionate Luminosity, and Radiant Numinosity ascended the southern Dharma throne.

All were adorned with nine-colored feathered capes of *li-luo*, embroidered skirts of flying brocade, crowns of soaring clouds and phoenixes, slippers of coiled dragons and pearl jade. They leaned upon purple-jade tables of returning simurghs, wielded fly-whisks inscribed with hundred-jeweled dragon patterns, and each settled into their seats with solemn grace.

The Jade Chamber youths sat upon flying-cloud treasure platforms, holding flowers of ninefold radiance and myriad petals, chanting in unison the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution by the Most High*. The Perfected Ones expounded the subtle and profound meanings, their merit and virtue vast beyond conception.

For a hundred days, ethereal melodies and floral garlands filled the air. The Celestial Emperors and Divine Lords drifted through the void, bearing banners and standards, burning incense and scattering flowers. They performed ten thousand kinds of wondrous celestial songs and music, suffusing the empty sky and veiling the heavens with brilliance.

Then the kings of Serene Joy, Carefree, Adornment, Self-Mastery, Supreme Victory, Boundlessness, Longevity and Joy, Wisdom Virtue, True Treasure, Fragrant Mountain, Floating Fragrance, Purity, and the Immaculate—each bearing gold, silver, pearls, jade, garments, bedding, chariots, horses, servants, and countless treasures—came together to make offerings. They scattered flowers and burned incense, circumambulated thrice to the left, knelt before the Dao, and prostrated in reverence: "We, the thirteen kings, have come before this assembly to behold and listen to the Dharma."

Moreover, the empresses Good Victory, Treasure Fragrance, Golden Splendor, Fortune Gathered, Jade Mountain, True Peace, Serene Brightness, Immaculate, Numinous Penetration, Enlightened, Victorious Cause, Wondrous Fragrance, and Supreme Victory—each bearing incense, flowers, banners, canopies, and countless precious garments—came together to pay homage and savor the Dharma.

Additionally, the princes of the various kings, numbering hundreds of thousands of myriads, each brought fine foods, exquisite flowers and fruits, golden mushrooms and jade blossoms in incalculable quantities to make offerings and listen to the Dharma.

Furthermore, the consorts, queen mothers, and young princes, numbering millions, each brought fine garments, crowns, slippers, jeweled vases, incense tables, trays, and vessels to the assembly to make offerings and receive the Dharma.

Again, the ministers and chief advisors, numbering millions, each brought ritual foods, rare fruits, delicacies, treasures, utensils, incense boxes, scripture wrappers, precious incense, and miscellaneous items to make offerings and wish to hear the Dharma.

Moreover, the faithful laymen and laywomen, each holding fragrant oils, fine garments, silks and brocades, grains, beans, beds, tables, cushions, hairpins, combs, kerchiefs, capes, slippers, boots, rings, and bracelets, came together to make offerings and wish to hear the numinous sounds.

The Daoist priests and nuns, each bearing incense, ritual vestments, and offerings, came to listen to the Dharma and scatter blessings upon the heavens.

Countless celestial youths and maidens circumambulated the Dharma seat, burning incense and scattering flowers, performing rituals and chanting praises, reciting the numinous sounds.

Jade youths and maidens, lighting lamps of ninefold radiance in boundless numbers, encircled the seat in formation, illuminating the assembly with brilliance.

The Primordial Beginning, through great divine power, transformed the assembly so that all Dharma implements, both within and without, became as transparent as lapis lazuli, pure and unstained.

The kings, empresses, consorts, ministers, officials, and all men and women who listened to the Dharma attained a single appearance, their inner and outer selves opened and connected. Together they awakened to the true Dao and entered the formless.

The lands of Southern Cinnabar, its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—even the birds, beasts, and crawling insects—all equally received the great Dharma sounds. Their merit and virtue were immeasurable, beyond conception.

In an instant, the celestial hosts, sages, and all who had come returned to their original abodes, and all became still and empty.

Universal Salvation said: "What the Heavenly Worthy has spoken today is all through the divine power and majesty of the Primordial Beginning, beyond the reach of ordinary beings."

"Now, I ask: what is the meaning of expounding the Dharma in the future and all its merits and virtues?"

The Lord of the Dao said: "I speak of this precisely to lay the foundation of blessings for sentient beings of the future. The merits and virtues are boundless, but in broad strokes, there are nine, each yielding its own field of blessings according to one’s capacity. Now I shall tell you—listen carefully.

First, the creation of images;
second, the transcription of scriptures;
third, the establishment of temples;
fourth, the salvation of people;
fifth, the holding of fasts;
sixth, the recitation of scriptures;
seventh, the upholding of precepts;
eighth, the making of offerings;
ninth, the practice of almsgiving.

Whether constructing halls and scripture platforms, bell towers and gate pavilions, corridors and master’s quarters, quarters for attendants and permanent residents, or endowing fields, banners, flowers, lamps, candles, bells, and chimes—all manner of Dharma implements and constructions—all become merits and virtues, boundless and immeasurable. Past and future, all shall reap blessings, each subtle and wondrous beyond words.

Yet among these, relieving peril and suffering, dissolving calamities and disasters, the merit of expounding the scriptures is foremost. Why? Because it awakens the boundless Dao-nature within sentient beings, brings forth wisdom, purifies the six senses, and leads to the realization of the formless, the attainment of the true and constant Dao—neither born nor destroyed, forever severing the roots of consciousness, without going or coming, profoundly still and empty. All this is awakened through this scripture, and through awakening, one attains truth.

For this reason, the expounding of scriptures must come first. If emperors, kings, empresses, ministers, chancellors, nobles, and all men and women invite Daoist masters—both male and female—to establish a hundred lofty seats wherever they may be, and expound the great Mahāyāna scriptures of the Three Caverns, burning incense, scattering flowers, illuminating with bright lamps, and making offerings according to their means—for three days, seven days, forty-nine days and nights, a hundred days, or without regard to time—able to complete one, two, or even hundreds of thousands of volumes, the benefit is supreme and inconceivable."

Universal Salvation again asked: "If sentient beings are weak and cannot prepare a hundred seats, but only one or two, or even ten, twenty, or thirty, according to their capacity, what then?"

The Lord of the Dao said: "When I spoke earlier of a hundred seats spread across the ten directions, it was precisely to awaken sentient beings. Each of the ten directions has its own seat, and this carries profound meaning. Yet one may proceed as circumstances allow.

The Primordial Beginning transformed a single qi to give rise to the Three Powers, establishing heaven and earth, moving the five phases, generating the ten thousand phenomena, and distributing qi throughout the ten directions. Humans are born within this, receiving their essence and nurturing their forms, all through this transformation. Externally, they rely on a single qi; internally, they form the five constants. Outer and inner mutually reinforce one another, giving rise to the five virtues.

Sentient beings accumulate yin, enclosing both inner and outer. After ten months in the womb, they emerge, their ten qi circulating in cycles, qi driving generation and transformation, their hundred joints unfolding. In each of the ten directions, qi forms ten knots; within each knot, there resides a spirit. Habits and knots intertwine, binding one in the coils of sin.

To harmonize these hundred spirits, a hundred perfected beings are established, and a hundred seats are arrayed. Thus, within each of the ten directions, ten Dharma-seats are built, and upon each seat sits a perfected one, precisely to untie the knots of sentient beings. If the knots of sentient beings are untied and they profoundly awaken to the source of the Dao, then even words would be unnecessary—how much less the need for expounding? But before awakening, one must rely on the hundred.

It is like a general mustering a thousand soldiers to strike down bandits. Once the bandits are scattered, not a single soldier is needed.

Chapter Seventeen: Responsive Manifestations

The Lord of the Dao said: "Long ago, the King of Supreme Victory abdicated his throne, left the household life, and entered the mountains to cultivate the Dao..."

Over the course of twelve years, the Most High Perfected Being descended to bestow upon him the scriptures and methods, granting him divine elixir. His lifespan extended to thirty thousand years, and he attained the rank of Perfected Being. The King of Many Treasures constantly upheld the scriptures and observed the precepts within his palace, burning incense and reciting in reverence. For sixteen years, the Perfected Being of Eastern Florescence regularly expounded the Dharma to him, teaching him the way to prolong life. His lifespan reached seventy thousand years, and he attained the rank of Perfected Being.

Empress Mǎnxiàng abandoned the palace chambers to leave the household life and cultivate the Dao. For thirty-five years, the Jade Maiden of Mystic Harmony attended her morning and evening, presenting her with the true scriptures. Through unwavering practice, her lifespan extended to twenty thousand years, and she entered Mount Penglai, where she now serves as a Perfected Consort.

Empress Miàoxiàng constantly recited these scriptures and precepts, her mindfulness ever present in her heart. After twenty-eight years, the Jade Maiden of Golden Florescence descended to bestow upon her the immortal scriptures. Over the course of a hundred years, she transformed her form through the water kalpa, turning her body into that of a man. She received the scriptures and methods anew, and after ten thousand hundred thousand years, she attained the rank of Perfected Being.

Prince Duōxǐ left the household life to cultivate the Dao, reciting and contemplating these scriptures. For sixty years, the Golden Radiance Youth provided him with clothing and food. Prince Shòuxiāng left the household life to recite the scriptures, and after fifty-seven years, divine incense descended from heaven, fragrant without burning.

There was also a great minister who left the household life to recite the scriptures. After eighty-nine years, phoenixes descended, their mouths emitting numinous sounds. Once there was a man who recited the scriptures at home, day and night without weariness. After forty-three years, lotuses bloomed in his courtyard, bearing a hundred flavors of fragrant fruits and beverages.

Another man cultivated the Dao in the mountains, reciting and contemplating the true scriptures. Within six years, the Dragon King descended to provide him with clothing and food. A woman entered the mountains to cultivate the Dao, reciting and contemplating these scriptures. After three years, a white tiger came to guard her scripture hall.

A woman recited the scriptures at home for twenty years, and her clothing and food came naturally. A Daoist dwelled alone in the mountains, reciting and contemplating these scriptures. Over nine years, a pair of phoenixes constantly attended him on either side, bringing incense and lamps, supplying all his needs.

A Daoist recited the scriptures at home for twenty-three years, and a heavenly youth descended to provide him with clothing and food. A female Daoist entered the mountains to cultivate the Dao, reciting and contemplating these scriptures. After twenty-one years, heavenly maidens attended and provided her with clothing and food.

A king observed fasts and upheld the precepts, bowing in worship and burning incense. After thirty-three years, the Perfected Being of Longevity bestowed upon him the immortal elixir, granting him an endless lifespan. A queen observed fasts, bowed in worship, upheld the precepts, and burned incense. Over fifty years, the Jade Maiden of Azure Waist welcomed her into the clouds.

A prince observed fasts and upheld the precepts, bowing in worship and burning incense. After seventy-three years, the Golden Florescence Youth descended to bestow upon him immortal lingzhi. A great minister observed fasts, bowed in worship, upheld the precepts, and burned incense. Over eighteen years, a numinous tortoise bore medicine to his seat.

A Daoist observed long fasts and upheld the precepts, bowing in worship and burning incense. After eighty-three years, the Heavenly King recommended him, and he ascended into the clouds. A female Daoist observed long fasts and upheld the precepts, scattering flowers and burning incense. After one hundred and one years, the Jade Maidens of the Five Emperors welcomed her into Golden Florescence.

A man observed fasts, bowed in worship, burned incense, and lit lamps. After ninety-three years, earth spirits attended him. A woman observed fasts, bowed in worship, burned incense, and scattered flowers. After ninety-eight years, the Controllers of the Three Realms welcomed her.

A king established temples to deliver sentient beings, copied scriptures, created images, and performed various meritorious deeds. Over sixteen years, the Five Emperors descended to bestow upon him golden lingzhi, phoenixes, simurghs, luan birds, qilin, rare beasts, sweet dew, sweet springs, divine lingzhi, and numinous herbs, filling the outskirts of his capital.

A queen widely practiced almsgiving, entered numinous temples to leave the household life and embody the Dharma-body, observed fasts, burned incense, and erected banners, canopies, and various fields of merit. Within three years, her white hair turned black again, restoring her youthful appearance. She bore noble children, wise and intelligent, all of whom ruled as kings, benevolent and sagacious.

A worthy person crafted various Dharma robes and offered them to Daoists who had left the household life to embody the Dharma-body. Over eight years, the five grains flourished abundantly, and all his wishes were fulfilled. A worthy person constantly provided vegetarian meals, offering them to Daoists and the virtuous. Over six years, his clothing and food were abundant.

Men and women constantly donated wealth to the permanent endowments, supplying the Three Treasures of the ten directions. Over twenty-four years, the five grains grew spontaneously, and heavenly silkworms descended with silk. A woman relieved the poor and destitute, ransomed lives, and greatly practiced compassion. After twenty-seven years, a jade maiden welcomed her into the clouds.

A woman supplied clothing and food to those who had left the household life. After thirty-nine years, heaven bestowed upon her yellow gold. A woman sewed banners, images, and robes for those who had left the household life, providing vegetarian meals and offerings without weariness or hardship. Over forty years, heaven sent down jade blossoms.

A worthy person cast bells and chimes, sending them to numinous temples. After twenty-five years, the earth yielded yellow gold, and his lifespan extended far. A worthy person constantly offered the five grains to the permanent endowments, sprouting them as seedlings. Over eleven years, his clothing and food were naturally abundant.

A worthy person constantly washed and adorned the revered images at the numinous altars, repaired the scriptural teachings, and offered incense and flowers. Over seventeen years, his household flourished. A worthy person donated manual labor to copy the scriptural teachings. Over eighteen years, he became wise and intelligent, and his descendants prospered.

Such are these examples, roughly outlining the essentials to instruct future generations. Even if the *Responsive Manifestations in the Golden Registers of the Mystic Capital* were expounded for an entire kalpa, they could not be exhausted.

**Chapter Eighteen: Rewards of Merit**
The Lord of the Dao said: "Those who create images and copy scriptures in this life attain supreme victory and are reborn in the future as heavenly kings. Those who establish temples to deliver sentient beings in this life attain nobility and wealth and are reborn in the future as kings."

Those who perform the Dao and recite the scriptures in this life are protected by benevolent spirits and are reborn in the future with a wise and intelligent form. Those who observe fasts and perform prostrations in this life attain peace and happiness and are reborn in the future with a prosperous form. Those who uphold the precepts and burn incense in this life are revered and guarded by all the heavens and are reborn in the future with a complete and perfect human form. Those who offer scriptures and images in this life attain flourishing prosperity and are reborn in the future with a noble and wealthy form. Those who offer vegetarian meals and alms in this life enjoy abundant clothing and food and are reborn in the future with an upright and handsome form. Those who relieve the poor and destitute in this life are free from disasters and calamities and are reborn in the future with a powerful and victorious form. Those who refrain from consuming sentient beings in this life are free from illness and suffering and are reborn in the future with a long-lived form. Those who abstain from drunkenness and recklessness in this life are protected by divine spirits and are reborn in the future with a loyal and steadfast form. Those who abstain from pungent and meat-based foods in this life attain fragrance and are reborn in the future with a pure and clean form. Those who liberate and ransom lives in this life are free from unjust harm and are reborn in the future with a revered form. Those who make offerings to renunciates in this life are respected by others and are reborn in the future with a noble and esteemed form. Those who expound the Dharma and teach others in this life are honored by others and are reborn in the future as renunciates.

The rewards of merit and retribution are like an echo responding to sound, or a shadow following form—great or small, pure or turbid, they never deviate. Yet ordinary beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize the causes and conditions of past lives. They do not believe in the consequences of sin and blessings, fortune and misfortune. They do not know that this present body arises from the field of blessings sown in a past life. They do not know that this body, once born, is already perishing; that this body is entirely transient and illusory; that this body is momentary and impermanent. Instead, they indulge in greed and stinginess, killing living beings, stealing, engaging in sexual misconduct and dissipation, consuming sentient beings, uttering harsh and deceitful words, slandering the scriptural teachings, and amassing wealth. They constantly assume they will live a thousand years in this life. With eyes open, they commit countless sins; with eyes closed, they enter the hells and cycle through rebirth. They spend their days creating sins, never repenting, unable to generate even a single thought of goodness to cultivate blessings for past, present, or future lives. They seek only to preserve their own bodies, planting the seeds of suffering, and worry only for their descendants, fearing they may not survive. Yet when the qi of life in this world is suddenly severed, they weep briefly, then fret over their sons and daughters, forgetting the kindness of their parents’ nurturing care. From beginningless time, they have imitated one another, never awakening—how profoundly foolish!

I pity you, who persist in such delusion, never awakening to yourselves. Thus, I reveal the causes and conditions of past lives, the consequences of sin and blessings, so that you may escape the river of suffering and desire. Yet sentient beings drift and drown in the sea of suffering. This world is called the *Realm of the Forsaken and the Wise*, also known as the *World of Mixed Retribution* or the *Heaven of Desire and Attachment*. Those born into it perish as soon as they arise, scatter as soon as they gather—like lightning, fleeting in an instant. It is impure, foul, and filthy, filled with birth, aging, illness, and death; pain, itching, and soreness; hunger, cold, heat, and dampness; water, fire, blades, and weapons; demonic spirits, ghosts, and thieves; poisonous winds and malevolent influences, all mutually harming one another. Death comes in every moment, never pausing for even an instant—how much suffering there is! Even the afflictions they see before their eyes, which entangle their own bodies, they fail to recognize. How then could they believe in the celestial realms, the blessed lands of immortals, the Dao of long life and deathlessness, or the freedom of non-action?

I observe that the lives of those born into this world are shorter than that of a mayfly; their dwellings are more cramped than a hair’s breadth; their foulness exceeds that of a latrine; their pleasures differ not from those of dung-beetles. Yet they remain unaware, perpetuating evil deeds—how could this not be suffering?

*The Supreme Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue on the Causes and Conditions of Karmic Retribution, Scroll Seven (Conclusion)*
*The Supreme Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue on the Causes and Conditions of Karmic Retribution, Scroll Eight*

**Chapter Nineteen: The Generation of the Spirit**

The Great Compassionate and Universally Salvific Perfected One, in light of karmic retribution’s causes and conditions, inquired of the Most High. At that time, the Most High Lord of the Dao declared:

“I, by the Dao and qi, unfolded heaven and earth, cleaved apart yin and yang, and through the revolving transformations of causes and conditions, gave birth to the myriad things. I divided the spirit and distributed qi to nourish and sustain the people. From beginning to end, I have overseen the workings of life and death, thought after thought unceasing, feeding them with primordial harmony. Yet which among you mortals can comprehend this?

Now I shall dissect these causes and conditions for you, that those of the future may awaken to their primordial origins. When a person first receives a body, they emerge from the void and spontaneity. Turning yellow to white, they gather qi and congeal essence. The primordial father generates the spirit; the mysterious mother forms the shape. They accord with heaven and comply with earth, uniting and transforming yin and yang. From these two halves of causes and conditions, they receive their bones and flesh, all drawing upon past karma and encountering present conditions. They take heaven and earth as their likeness, harboring the sun and moon within. Through the transformations of yin and yang, the spirit and consciousness come and go.

Among the myriad transformations, humans are the most noble. Thus, when first entering the womb, the three qi subtly congeal, and the nine heavens obscurely revolve:
- In the first month, it is the *bao* (embryonic sac), and the qi of the *Yudan Wu-liang* Heaven permeates the body;
- In the second month, it is the *tai* (embryo), and the qi of the *Shangshang Chan Shan Wu-liang Shou* Heaven permeates the body;
- In the third month, the *hun* (ethereal soul) takes form, and the qi of the *Fan Jian Xu-yan* Heaven permeates the body;
- In the fourth month, the *po* (corporeal soul) is complete, and the qi of the *Jiran Dou-shu* Heaven permeates the body;
- In the fifth month, the viscera are generated, and the qi of the *Boluo Ni-mi Bu-jiao Le* Heaven permeates the body;
- In the sixth month, the bowels are transformed, and the qi of the *Dongxuan Hua-ying Sheng* Heaven permeates the body;
- In the seventh month, the orifices become clear, and the qi of the *Linghua Fan-fu* Heaven permeates the body;
- In the eighth month, the *jing* (essence) attaches, and the qi of the *Gaoxu Qingming* Heaven permeates the body;
- In the ninth month, the spirit descends, and the qi of the *Wu-xiang Wu-jie Wu-ai* Heaven permeates the body.

Eighteen thousand celestial spirits and eighteen thousand bodily spirits, inner and outer, unite to form thirty-six thousand spirits. All at once, the spirit is generated. Within the golden towers and jade pavilions, the purple gates and azure portals, the spirit is divided, distributed, and transformed, encircling the body within and without, corresponding inside and out. When voice and spirit are fully formed, the child is born in the tenth month.

While in the womb, the three primals nurture and the nine qi distribute transformations. Day and night, without cease, the spirit of former lives is transformed, receiving the substance of the present body. At first, within the womb, one fully knows the good and evil causes and conditions of past lives and perceives the origins of one’s birth. Yet upon consuming impure filth, one gradually forgets.

The head is round, symbolizing heaven; the feet are square, symbolizing earth. The left eye is the sun; the right eye, the moon. The hair is the stars; the eyebrows, the canopy of flowers. The nose is the gate of heaven; the mouth, the door of earth. The ears are the windows of heaven; the crown, Kunlun. The neck is the pillar of heaven; the five viscera, the five sacred peaks. The four limbs are the four seas. The skin, bones, joints, blood vessels, and mechanisms of the body emulate heaven and earth, containing yin and exhaling yang.

The generation and distribution of the spirit each have their overseers:
- The brain is the *Niwan*, where the Supreme Unity Sovereign Lord resides;
- The heart is the *Jiang Palace*, where the Controller of Destiny receives life;
- The liver is the *Qing Palace*, where *Wu-ying* governs the *hun*;
- The lungs are the *Su Palace*, where *Bai-yuan* tends the *po*;
- The kidneys are the *Xuan Palace*, where *Tao-kang* receives essence;
- The spleen is the *Huang Ting*, where the Yellow Emperor transforms the spirit.

The qi of *Shaoyang* transforms, and the essence of wood, the Year Star, is received and transformed within the body as the liver, where the three *hun* reside. They emerge above through the eyes, attended by nine guardians who oversee nine thousand spirits. The liver has seven lobes, governing the hair, skin, and the circulation of *ying* and *wei*.

The qi of *Taiyang* transforms, and the essence of fire, the Sparkling Deluder, is received and transformed within the body as the heart, where the fire spirit dwells. It emerges above as the tongue, attended by three guardians who oversee three thousand spirits. The heart has three lobes, seven orifices, and three hairs, resembling a lotus blossom. It governs the warmth of the spirit and qi, and the circulation of *ying* and *wei* for the hundred spirits.

The qi of *Shaoyin* transforms, and the essence of metal, the Grand White, is received and transformed within the body as the lungs, where the seven *po* reside. They emerge above through the nose, attended by seven guardians who oversee seven thousand spirits. The lungs have eight lobes, governing the teeth and protecting the sinews and bones.

The qi of *Taiyin* transforms, and the essence of water, the Chronographic Star, is received and transformed within the body as the kidneys. To the left is the Jade Lad; to the right, the Jade Maiden. The courtyard of essence transformation emerges above through the ears, attended by five guardians who oversee five thousand spirits. The kidneys have two, like half-moons, governing the essence and fluids, protecting the blood and marrow.

The primordial yellow qi transforms, and the essence of earth, the Quelling Star, is received and transformed within the body as the spleen, whence will and intent arise. It emerges above through the mouth, attended by twelve guardians who oversee twelve thousand spirits. The spleen is five inches long, governing the muscles and protecting the four limbs.

Circulating through the hundred parts of the body, the hundred spirits are generated, each with its own name. They enter and exit the various heavens, transforming unpredictably, coming and going without cease. Those who know this attain long life. In sitting and walking, recite and recall them, nurturing and protecting the body’s form, dispelling the myriad calamities, and subduing the hundred spirits.

The spirit of the hair emits mysterious light; the spirit of the crown connects to heaven. Before the crown is the spirit *Zhu-yang*; behind it, *Xuan-ming*. To the left of the crown is the spirit *Qing-guang*; to the right, *Bai-zhang*. The spirit of the forehead is *Tian-ting*; of the left eyebrow, *Cui-tong*; of the right eyebrow, *Yu-tong*. The spirit of the left eye is *Ri-guang*; of the right eye, *Yue-guang*. The spirit of the left cheek is *Yu-que*; of the right cheek, *Yu-liang*. The spirit of the left nostril is *Tong-yang*; of the right nostril, *Tong-yin*. To the left of the mouth is the spirit *Ming-tong*; to the right, *Tian-liang*. The spirit of the teeth is *Yu-guan*; of the left tooth, *Tian-zhong*; of the right tooth, *Tian-qing*. The spirit of the tongue is *Chi-tong*; of the upper lip, *Ting-gai*; of the lower lip, *Jing-yu*. The spirit of the left jaw is *Huang-fu*; of the right jaw, *Huang-mu*. To the left of the neck is the spirit *Tian-tong*; to the right, *Sheng-ping*. The spirit of the left shoulder is *Yuan-shan*; of the right shoulder, *Yuan-an*. The spirit of the left elbow is *Fei-long*; of the right elbow, *Fu-hu*. The spirit of the left hand is *Tian-ding*; of the right hand, *Tian-zou*. The spirit of the left fingers is *Jia-zu*; of the right fingers, *Yu-xiong*. The spirit of the left armpit is *Fu-gan*; of the right armpit, *Fu-dao*. The spirit of the left rib is *Wei-bian*; of the right rib, *Fang-fei*. To the left of the waist is the spirit *Dong-kai*; to the right, *Yao-ting*. The spirit of the left thigh is *Xuan-yu*; of the right thigh, *Xuan-shan*. The spirit of the left knee is *Zhuan-sheng*; of the right knee, *Qu-ting*. The spirit of the left shin is *Tian-zhu*; of the right shin, *Tian-guan*. The spirit of the left foot is *Lun-kong*; of the right foot, *Yun-xu*. The spirit of the left ankle is *You-hu*; of the right ankle, *Fu-lang*. The spirit of the chest is *Tian-tian*; of the abdomen, *Bao-ling*. The spirit of the private parts is *Ji-guan*; of the coccyx, *You-guan*. The spirit of the back is *Zi-fang*; of the spine, *Tong-ping*. The spirit of the navel is *Zhong-ping*; of the skin, *Bao-luo*; of the flesh, *Wei-fei*; of the bones, *Nei-ding*.”

Each spirit spans seven inches, appearing in the form of an infant. Within the human body, they absorb qi to become spirits, ensuring the flow of *rong* and *wei* and the natural transformation of qi. In harmony with the virtue of Heaven and Earth, they enter and exit the body, promoting good and halting evil, ceaselessly day and night.

When a person is unborn, they do not exist; once born, they embody the image of Heaven and Earth, inhaling yin and exhaling yang, their fate suspended by Heaven. Heaven grants them a lifespan of forty-three thousand two hundred days—one hundred and twenty years—with each day recorded by the Lord of Destiny and inscribed in the registers of the various heavens.

I have often commanded the Emperors of the Heavens to summon the Five Emperors, the Three Realms, the Four Offices, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Ten Heavenly Generals, the Nine Earth Envoys, the Seven Divine Lads, the Eight Divisions of Heavenly Spirits, and all divine beings to roam the mortal world, inspecting and assessing sins and blessings, the fortunes and misfortunes of men and women.

I have also dispatched the Most Sacred and Exalted Perfected Ones of Wondrous Conduct, the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Divine Immortals, Earthbound Immortals, the Five Sacred Peaks, the Four Waterways, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Three Officials, the Nine Bureaus, and the twenty-four thousand spirit offices. They bear standards and banners, soar through the void, wield talismans and registers, and patrol ceaselessly. Every three days, they report once; every seven days, they memorialize; every hundred days, they conclude—without pause for even a moment.

For those who cultivate goodness and power, the Heavenly Lads and the Offices of Life and Record immediately extend their years, dispel disasters, and scatter misfortunes, ensuring abundant clothing and food. For those who commit sins and accumulate evil, the Heavenly Emperors dispatch the Demon Kings of the Six Heavens to seize their souls and present them before the Three Officials. If their allotted lifespan is not yet complete, it is due to the sins they have committed. Those who fulfill their destined span do so through the accumulation of goodness.

Thus, when a person nears the end of life, it is because the Earthly Offices have memorialized the Heavens, and the Heavens, upon inspection, determine their death according to the celestial registers. They then command the officials of the Three Realms and the Four Offices, along with the Five Emperors, to collect the soul and sever the breath of life.

Whenever a person suffers illness, punishment, calamity, official disasters, imprisonment, water or fire, blades or weapons, or any manner of suffering, it is the result of the underworld’s examination and punishment. At such times, one should broadly establish fields of blessing: perform purification rites, uphold precepts, recite scriptures, practice the Dao, burn incense, scatter flowers, lecture on and recite repentances, make offerings, cultivate resolve, release and redeem lives, aid the poor, rescue those in peril, copy scriptures, create images, receive precepts, repent, and pay homage to the ten directions.

First, create the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, the Banner of Deliverance from Calamity, the Banner of Life Protection, the Banner of Lifespan Extension, the Banner of Life Continuation, and the Banner of Disaster Dispelling. Copy this scripture, recite it day and night, and for three, seven, or even a hundred days, offer repentance to the Heavens. Donate family wealth—treasures, goods, fields, dwellings, servants, silks, fine brocades, carriages, horses, rare curios, fine garments, utensils, bedding, and curtains—kneeling before the Heavens to repent for transgressions. The Three Officials will then release the soul, extend life, and increase the allotted span, allowing rebirth.

If Heaven’s mandate is nearing its end and the celestial tally is nearly exhausted, it cannot be saved. Yet if one, in the realm of the Great Yin, at the hour of death, makes vows, repents, donates clothing, bedding, and all possessions, receives precepts, and repents, the merit gained is inconceivable. From the moment of death until the seventh day, create scriptures and images, hold purification feasts, practice the Dao, recite repentances, burn incense, light lamps, release and redeem lives, aid the poor, and continue these acts day and night to deliver the deceased, enabling them to ascend to Heaven.

Why is this so? From the moment of death until the seventh day, the Heavenly Lads, the Four Offices, the Five Emperors, and the officials of the Three Realms all come to oversee, inspecting sins and blessings, and reporting to the Heavenly Offices. I dispatch the Seven Divine Lads to re-examine their conduct, determine good and evil, and assign them to the Gate of Life. If good, they ascend to Heaven, their blessings flowing to descendants, ensuring present peace, freedom from fear, a pure household, and success in all endeavors. If evil, they suffer calamity, their sins flowing to descendants, causing death, illness, misfortune, official disasters, slander, manifold terrors, and confusion in life—all undertakings will fail.

Thus, the seven days following death are the most critical for deliverance. After this period, every seventh day, the Divine Lads record the soul of the deceased and return to the household to review sins and blessings. After forty-nine days, the Five Heavenly Generals descend to seize the soul, and the Nine Earth Envoys come to take the *po*. The Generals wish to send them to Heaven, while the Envoys wish to send them to Earth. Every five days, they weigh sins and blessings; those with more blessings ascend to Heaven, while those with more sins descend to Hell. The two spirits of good and evil descend every ten days to examine and determine sins and blessings.

Therefore, from the moment of death, the first seven days, the second seven days, up to the forty-ninth day and the hundredth day, the deceased’s family must perform deliverance rites to ensure rebirth in a good place and attain peace. This is the foremost act of merit. On the first seventh day, create one image of the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, copy one section of this scripture, make one spirit banner, and light seven lamps. By the second seventh day, create two images of the Heavenly Worthy, copy two sections of the scripture, make two banners, and light fourteen lamps. By the seventh day, create seven images, copy seven sections of the scripture, make seven banners, and light forty-nine lamps. Increase these accordingly until the hundredth day, when one hundred images, one hundred sections of the scripture (recited one hundred times), one hundred banners, and seven hundred lamps are made. Though the number of scriptures, images, banners, and lamps may reach hundreds of thousands or millions, they must adhere to the number seven. For the poor, adjust according to their means, but aim for seven hundred days.

The Dao Lord said: The Seven Divine Lads are the essence of the Northern Dipper in Heaven.

When a person first resides in the womb, at the seventh month, the Seven Divine Lads descend into the body, opening and illuminating the seven apertures. Their names are recorded in the Northern Dipper: the first is Heavenly Canopy, the second Heavenly Interior, the third Heavenly Charge, the fourth Heavenly Assistance, the fifth Heavenly Quail, the sixth Heavenly Heart, and the seventh Heavenly Pillar. Each rides a sevenfold-brilliant cloud chariot, clad in five-colored garments, accompanied by divine lads from the ten directions, with legions of immortals, soldiers, and horses numbering seventy million each. They constantly dwell among humans, manifesting in various forms—tall or short, male or female—to teach and transform. Holding talismans and records, they precisely assess merits and transgressions, good and evil karmic conditions, without the slightest error. Those who know this shall attain immortality and eternal life.

The Dao Lord said: There are also Eight Divine Lads.
The first is the Golden Flower Lad, whose divine name is Heavenly Origin. He governs the Son of Heaven, crown princes, consorts, and ancestral temples; the renewal of the old and establishment of the new; the enthronement of rulers and replacement of sovereigns; the offering of counsel and rejection of folly; tribute and taxation; wealth and treasures; chariots, horses, and attire; palaces, gardens, and hunting parks; ponds, terraces, and pavilions; ranks, emoluments, and summons; and all movements and travels.
The second is the Yellow Spirit Lad, whose divine name is Heavenly Maiden. He governs dwellings, tombs, and mausoleums; livestock and crops; granaries and storehouses; sons and daughters; longevity and premature death; illness and disease; and the construction of earthworks, mountains, rivers, and valleys.
The third is the Pure Spirit Lad, whose divine name is Heavenly Might. He governs roads, vehicles, and vessels; forests, trees, flowers, and fruits; and thunder, lightning, wind, and rain.
The fourth is the Bright Spirit Lad, whose divine name is Heavenly Life. He governs wells, stoves, doors, and gates; ditches, latrines, and cesspits; impurity, filth, and lewdness; and falsehood and deceit.
The fifth is the Cinnabar Spirit Lad, whose divine name is Heavenly Radiance. He governs prisons and confinement; documents and childbirth; bloodshed, fire, and disasters.
The sixth is the Mysterious Spirit Lad, whose divine name is Heavenly Communication. He governs life spans and their extension or curtailment; demons, specters, and goblins; curses, prayers, and sacrifices; and all spirits and ghosts.
The seventh is the Purple Spirit Lad, whose divine name is Heavenly Perfection. He governs wandering souls and lost spirits; roaming corpses and the dead; and those sunk in hell.
The eighth is the White Spirit Lad, whose divine name is Heavenly Prosperity. He governs fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters; husbands, wives, and childbirth.

These Eight Divine Lads sometimes ride wind, rain, clouds, and thunder, mounting dragons and tigers as they move in and out of the human realm, observing good and evil. If one is good, fortune follows; if evil, misfortune ensues. They respond according to karmic conditions, never erring. You, men and women, should but recite this sutra, and the Eight Divine Lads will come to protect you, bestowing blessings, dispelling calamities, eradicating sins and transgressions—effects beyond imagination.

The Dao Lord said: No one receives life without coming from past karma. Thus, each is endowed with a divine and exceptional nature, each with its own karmic conditions. Whether sinful or auspicious spirits, fortune or misfortune, all arise from one’s karma. Therefore, differences in longevity or premature death, nobility or lowliness, prosperity or adversity, beauty or ugliness, wealth or poverty, foolishness or wisdom—all vary. Even birds, beasts, insects, fish, chickens, dogs, grasses, and trees are likewise. You, men and women, should each reflect upon this.

The Dao Lord said: The receiving of a human body is a rare encounter. Once it decays, when will one meet such an opportunity again for ten thousand kalpas? Therefore, I constantly and earnestly exhort you to diligently cultivate purification rites, practice the Dao, recite scriptures, pay homage, burn incense, light lamps, make offerings, make vows, repent, save the living and deliver the dead, create images, copy scriptures, establish abbeys, and guide others—employing all manner of expedient means to establish future blessings for sentient beings. What could I possibly seek for myself?

The Dao Lord said: In ancient times, when King Miaofan died, he invited three hundred and sixty eminent Daoist masters to the palace. They repented, received the precepts, and offered his clothing, ornaments, bedding, curtains, gold, silver, chariots, horses, jeweled canopies, silks, brocades, utensils, and servants—all dedicated to the numinous abbey and the altar of the Daoist nuns and masters. Their sincerity moved the heavens, and the gods rejoiced greatly. I dispatched the True Person of Good Life, who rode a three-wheeled phoenix chariot with jade lads and maidens to welcome him into the Fire-Refining Pool, where his true form was refined. After three years, he was reborn in the royal palace. Fourteen years later, he reclaimed the throne, greatly cultivated the Dao, and widely established merit. He lived for seven hundred years. I then sent the True Person of Mysterious Communication, seated upon a lotus throne and a flying cloud chariot, to welcome him into the Palace of Square Cauldrons, where he studied scriptures and methods. He attained a lifespan of eight thousand years and now serves as the Attendant Lad of Azure Flower.

When the king of Tonghua died, he invited forty-six thousand Daoist masters to recite scriptures, practice the Dao, create images, copy scriptures, deliver people, establish abbeys, burn incense, scatter flowers, and perform the Five Refining Rites for the Living Spirit. Within a hundred days, I dispatched the True Person of Transformative Mandate, along with the Eight Wind Messengers and Thunderbolt Generals, who came at night to welcome him. Mounting a cloud-dragon chariot, he was conveyed to the Southern Prosperity Palace to further study scriptures and methods. After ten thousand years, he became the True Person of Fire Radiance, governing this Fire Pool.

In ancient times, when a worthy man was at the end of his life, his family invited Daoist masters and nuns to repent and receive the precepts. At the moment of his death, through the power of this sutra, he did not pass through hell but was immediately reborn into a family of virtue and goodness. There was also a woman who died, and her parents and family created images, copied scriptures, made banners and canopies, extensively lit lamps and candles, recited this sutra, established purification rites, practiced the Dao, meditated day and night without weariness, made offerings, released living beings, aided the poor, and delivered those in distress. After a hundred years, I commanded the Controller of Destiny to return her soul. She was restored to her home, where she greatly cultivated merit, supplied the Three Treasures, consulted Daoist masters, and received the true scriptures. She lived for three hundred years. I then dispatched the True Person of Transformative Mandate to deliver her. Her form was refined by wind and fire, and she was reborn as a man. Entering Golden Flower Mountain, she consumed elixirs and lived for over seventy thousand years, ascending to the Western Numinous Palace to become an unsurpassed Dharma Master.

**The Wondrous Treasure Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Causality, Scroll Nine**
**Chapter Twenty: The Vast Salvation**

The All-Compassionate, Universally Saving Perfected One said: The karmic conditions of sin and blessing expounded by the Heavenly Worthy are profoundly subtle and wondrous, beyond conception, employing skillful means to deliver sentient beings. Yet the suffering souls in hell endure boundless agony, their torment unbearable. Though they may receive deliverance, we still fear their relapse into the abyss, enduring ten thousand kalpas of bitterness—how endless their anguish! We humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to extend boundless compassion, revealing the essential Dao, that they may swiftly ascend, and both past and future beings alike receive benefit, serving as a bridge across kalpas for all men and women.

Then the Most High Lord of the Dao said: I have expounded the origins of causality for all sentient beings, revealing the consequences of sin and blessing, that the world may recognize the roots of past lives. I have established vast Dharma gates, guiding men and women according to their karmic power, enabling them to escape the dark prison of the cycle of birth and death, whether gradually or suddenly, until all is exhausted. Now you further seek brevity, desiring swift ascent. Men and women, listen carefully, compose your bodies and minds, and receive this wondrous Dao.

All people are endowed with life from the same qi. At birth, their fate is bound to the Three Origins, determining longevity or premature death, fortune or misfortune, wealth or poverty, the conditions of sin and blessing, good and evil, life and death. Each follows the roots of past lives, all bearing karmic retribution, unerringly determined by their deeds, like a shadow following form, or an echo responding to sound.

The Three Origins are the Upper, Middle, and Lower Origins. The Upper Origin falls on the fifteenth day of the first month, presided over by the Heavenly Official. The Middle Origin falls on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, presided over by the Earthly Official. The Lower Origin falls on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, presided over by the Water Official. Together with the Three Realms, the ten directions, all the sagely beings of the heavens, Perfected Ones of wondrous conduct, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors and Four Controllers, the divine youths of good and evil, and all the innumerable spirits of the divine multitude, they assemble in the Mysterious Capital of the Primordial Yang Palace. Before the Origin of the Primordial Beginning, they examine the records of life and death, the karmic conditions of sin and blessing for all men and women. Even the suffering souls of the Nine Dark Hells and the Watery Abyss are summoned to verify the division of good and evil.

At this time, if there are good men and good women who awaken the natural intention of the Dao, gather all manner of flowers and fruits, fine garments and robes, rare treasures and precious objects, toys and playthings, various incenses and medicines, pure food and drink, as well as the finest silks, brocades, and multicolored fabrics, to create the Great Offering of the Mysterious Capital—adorned in myriad ways, layer upon layer, from one or two to a hundred or a thousand—constructing the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Capital, the Five Sacred Peaks, famous mountains, pavilions and terraces, halls and palaces, and sacred images, exquisitely decorated and refined, numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands, to be used in offerings; scattering flowers, burning incense, practicing the Dao, reciting scriptures, lighting lamps, releasing living beings, singing hymns of praise, making vows, repenting transgressions, seeking mercy, prostrating to eliminate sins, day and night without ceasing—I shall dispatch the Ten Heavenly Perfected Ones, along with all the Heavenly Emperors, Flying Heavenly Devas, Divine Kings of the Three Realms and Four Controllers, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens in countless numbers. They will traverse the void, bearing banners and standards, holding registers and talismans, arriving together at the ritual site to eliminate sins, protect the people, ensure the peace of the land, bring joy to men and women, bestow all blessings, prevent all evils, liberate the suffering souls of hell in an instant, enabling them to be reborn in heaven, enjoying boundless bliss, bringing universal peace and immeasurable fortune.

The Lord of the Dao said: In the past, during the first year of the Red Clarity era of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in the Longevity Abbey of the Land of Faith and Practice in the World of Blessed Assembly, I convened a great Dharma assembly. The Heavenly Emperors of the ten directions, divine immortals, Perfected Ones, and sages in countless numbers, along with all dragons and spirits, gathered to hear the teachings of the Wondrous Marks.

The immeasurable Heavenly Kings of the Upper Lands each crafted thirty-six thousand thirty-six-tiered Mysterious Capital Offering Trays, all adorned with purple pearls, purple jade, purple gold, purple treasures, purple brocades, purple gauze, purple silk, purple fruits, purple incense, purple nets, and even banners, standards, jeweled canopies, garments, curtains, carriages, food vessels, and utensils—all of a single purple hue. Flying clouds, colorful cranes, soaring simurghs, dancing phoenixes, golden-winged vermilion birds, and divine dragon musicians filled the boundless void, arriving at the assembly to make offerings.

The Heavenly King of Sustaining Virtue of the Lower Land crafted twenty-four thousand twenty-four-tiered Mysterious Capital Offering Trays, all adorned with yellow pearls, yellow jade, yellow gold, yellow treasures, yellow brocades, yellow gauze, yellow silk, yellow fruits, yellow incense, yellow nets, and even banners, standards, jeweled canopies, garments, curtains, carriages, food vessels, and utensils—all of a single yellow hue. Flying clouds, colorful cranes, soaring simurghs, dancing phoenixes, golden-winged vermilion birds, and divine immortal musicians filled the eight directions, arriving at the assembly to make offerings.

At that time, the Mysterious Capital Offering Trays from the ten directions transformed into Mysterious Capital Jade Capitals, images of the Five Sacred Mountains, flying cloud towers, intertwining dragons and dancing phoenixes, jeweled terraces and flowering trees, or lotus blossoms and sacred herbs—all intricately carved and inlaid, strung with pearls and threaded with jade, entirely natural, encircling the assembly on all sides.

Moreover, they were adorned with rare treasures and fine garments from their respective lands, silks and brocades, precious incense and superior medicines, utensils and playthings, fruits and grains, chariots and elephants, horses and sleeping mats, fields and dwellings, palaces and ponds, gardens and parks—all manner of embellishments—serving as attendants on either side.

The kings and their queens, along with all the great ministers, consorts, and lords, and the countless men and women of their realms, each bearing incense, flowers, banners, and canopies, came together to make offerings.

For five days and five nights, radiant light blazed brilliantly, illuminating all the heavens, an unprecedented and inconceivable spectacle.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, through the power of divine transformation, made this assembly and all the lands as transparent as lapis lazuli, clearly revealing their interiors and exteriors, all of a single hue. The men and women of the realms all bore the same countenance, and distant and near sights were perceived equally without distinction.

The blessings and joys of the Three Realms and the ten directions were universally shared, their happiness beyond words. The Nine Dark Realms ceased their judgments, the Five Sufferings halted their bitterness, the lands knew peace, and the people rejoiced.

The Dao Lord said: "In former times, the King of Abandoned Virtue did not cultivate proper governance. He slaughtered without restraint, hunted for sport, and neglected the poor. He wantonly harmed the good and innocent, and built palaces in extravagance, indulging in a hundred excesses. Within thirteen years, the people rose in rebellion, and the king himself was executed. His soul fell into the Three Wretched Realms, enduring every suffering for fifty-eight years, day and night in bitter torment.

His son inherited the throne and, recognizing his father’s wrongs, saved himself through self-cultivation. He practiced great compassion and frugality, bringing joy to the people and peace to the land. He bowed in worship, burned incense, and constantly observed fasts and integrity. On the first day of each year, he widely established fields of merit: walking the Dao, expounding sutras, lighting lamps, and making vows. He transcribed scriptures, commissioned images, founded temples to liberate beings, practiced almsgiving, and released living creatures. He gathered all manner of flowers, fruits, rare incense, superior medicines, playthings, garments, silks, brocades, and countless treasures—various ritual implements, pure foods, grains, and multicolored fabrics—to craft the Mystic Capital’s jeweled platters. These he offered to the Heavenly Worthy, all the perfected sages, worthies, and the immeasurable assembly of Daoist renunciates. Over nine years, his accumulated merit and cultivation enabled him to escape hell and ascend to heaven.

The Sage and Good King, along with his queen, the various princes, consorts, ministers, and all the men and women of the realm—worthy persons and Daoist practitioners—regularly on the Three Primordials crafted seven-jeweled platters. With finest incense, medicines, pure foods, and multicolored silks, adorned with countless treasures, they fashioned hundreds, thousands, boundless and immeasurable layers. These they sent to the numinous temples and sacred peaks, placing them everywhere to make offerings to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Realms and the ten directions, past, future, and present, and to all the perfected immortals and supreme sages. Universally they dedicated the merit, scattering flowers, burning incense, bowing in worship, reciting scriptures, observing fasts, upholding precepts, expounding the Great Vehicle, practicing almsgiving, and releasing living beings—constantly and without cease. Over eighteen years, men and women alike became of one countenance, free from premature death. Heavenly beings and humans rejoiced, and clothing and food arose spontaneously.

The King of Proper Governance and his queen, on the Three Primordials, personally burned incense, scattered flowers, walked the Dao, expounded scriptures, bowed in worship, and made vows, repenting of transgressions and praying for blessings. They used all the gold, silver, and treasures of the realm to craft nine-tiered jeweled platters for the Great Offering of the Mystic Capital—three hundred and sixty in number—adorned with fragrant flowers, jeweled canopies, banners, and all manner of music, encircling them completely. Within the main palace hall and its courtyards, they established vast ritual precincts, summoning Daoist practitioners to sit upon hundred-jeweled thrones and expound the Great Vehicle. Day and night they offered sincere prayers, making offerings to the Heavenly Worthy. The land knew great peace, the people rejoiced, and the souls of the departed were delivered, all ascending to the halls of blessing. Men and women were filled with joy, their lifespans long and distant.

The King of Peace and Joy, together with his great ministers, queen, consorts, and all the men and women of the realm, regularly on the first day of the Three Primordial months established hundred-high thrones within the palace. They summoned Daoist practitioners and female renunciates to expound the Three Caverns’ Great Vehicle scriptures, walk the Dao, and perform repentance rituals. They practiced almsgiving, released living creatures, transcribed scriptures, cast images, founded temples to liberate beings, and crafted thirty-six-tiered platters of the Mystic Capital’s treasure—one thousand two hundred in number—adorned in various ways for offerings. On the first day of each year, they widely established fields of merit to protect the nation, bring peace to the people, harmonize heaven and earth, ensure timely winds and rains, and bring the hundred grains to ripeness. Their seven ancestors ascended to heaven, the judgments of the Nine Dark Realms ceased, men and women flourished, and the land knew great peace.

In former times, a worthy person, for the sake of the nine generations of ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, his parents, himself, his inner and outer kin, and all beings, regularly on the Three Primordials crafted the Great Offering of the Mystic Capital. With utmost sincerity, he dedicated his wealth, property, incense, oil, lamps, candles, foods, and fruits—whatever he possessed—to make offerings to the Heavenly Worthy and all Daoist practitioners. Over eight years, his nine ancestors ascended to heaven, his present life knew happiness, his lifespan lengthened, and clothing and food arose spontaneously.

Another woman constantly crafted the Great Offering of the Mystic Capital, universally dedicating it for all. Over twenty years, her body emitted light, and the gates of the Three Realms served her.

Another Daoist, for the sake of the king, the people, all beings, past and present, and all creatures above and below the earth, crafted the Great Offering of the Mystic Capital, making offerings to all the heavens, Daoist practitioners, and the hungry ghosts and destitute souls of the Three Wretched Realms. Over fourteen years, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Yet another Daoist constantly exhorted men and women to act on behalf of their countless ancestors, the people, all beings, and the king. They gathered flowers, fruits, a hundred flavors of food and drink, fine garments, rare treasures, playthings, bedding, banners, flowers, canopies, and crafted seven-jeweled mountain-platters for the Great Offering of the Mystic Capital. On the first day of each year, they made offerings to the Heavenly Worthy and all the sages, bowing in repentance, scattering flowers, and burning incense. Over thirty-two years, he became a Perfected One of the Four Brahmā Heavens.

The Dao Lord said: "In the Formless Mountain of the Luminous Land, there were thirty-six thousand Daoist practitioners. Regularly on the first day of summer, they entered seclusion, burned incense, walked the Dao, performed repentance rituals, expounded scriptures, observed fasts, upheld precepts, exhorted men and women, liberated heavenly beings and humans, and performed all manner of good deeds day and night without cease. They prayed for the nation’s peace, delivered beings from the cycle of birth and death, and widely established bridges.

The king, queen, consorts, ministers, and all the men and women of the realm each aroused the mind of the Dao. According to their means, they made offerings of foods and delicacies, incense, medicines, utensils, finest garments, carriages, elephants, horses, silks, brocades, gold, silver, pearls, jade, grains, fruits, bedding, curtains, fields, gardens, servants, and all manner of things to support and supply the secluded Daoist practitioners. With sincere reverence, they prayed to gain merit, adornment, and benefit."

The Daoist practitioners constantly expounded the scriptures and precepts, explaining the causes and conditions of sin and blessing. They spoke of the impurity and foulness of embodied existence, the floating emptiness of the Four Great Elements, the impermanence of every thought-moment, and how the three karmic actions and six senses construct all evils, gradually staining one with transgressions, leading to the cycle of birth and death. Falling into the Three Wretched Realms and the Nine Dark Hells of the underworld, beings endure all manner of suffering—swallowing fire and eating coals, boiled in cauldrons, treading upon knife mountains, grasping sword trees, ground in mills, pounded in mortars, sawed asunder, pierced with awls, their eyes pecked out by iron birds, their tongues plowed by iron plows, flogged by ox-headed demons, their bodies burdened with iron staves, their flesh oozing pus and blood, their bodies rotting away, sinking into darkness, drifting through hell, bearing stones to fill rivers, tormented day and night. Once entering such a place, escape is impossible for ten thousand kalpas. All this is self-inflicted by the karmic conditions of sentient beings, whether for the sake of parents, children, or descendants, passing down through generations, drawing one another into suffering.

If good men and good women can arouse a virtuous mind and constantly perform the Great Offering of the Dark Capital for the sake of their present parents, past ancestors, blood kin, the suffering souls in the Five Pains and Three Wretched Realms, hungry ghosts, animals, prisoners, the sick and elderly, and all sentient beings—establishing towering altars, expounding the Great Vehicle, copying scriptures and painting images, founding temples to deliver beings, offering their bodies in devotion, leaving the household life to enter the Dao, practicing charity and liberating life, observing long fasts and upholding precepts—then, according to their merit, all shall ascend to heaven, where day and night they observe and expound the teachings, awakening the people of the realm. After one hundred and fifty days, on the day of the Middle Prime Festival, a great assembly is held to expound the Dharma, receive precepts, and repent transgressions, widely delivering sentient beings. The men and women of the realm all arouse virtuous intentions, offering finest garments, ritual implements, incense burners, washing basins, staffs, cushions, rare incense and superior medicines, playthings and adornments, towels, combs, spoons, trays, and vessels, presenting them to the Heavenly Worthy and the host of immortals, perfected ones, and Daoist practitioners in offering. Extending to the prisoners of the Three Wretched Realms, hungry ghosts, and all sentient beings, all are freed from suffering, the land enjoys peace, and the people live in happiness. The thirty-six thousand Daoist practitioners each attain a lifespan of ten thousand years, ascending together to the Jia Yi Heaven as the Four Brahma Perfected Ones. The Radiant King ascends to become the Brahma Sovereign Heavenly King, the queen becomes the Four Brahma Heavenly Maidens, and the great ministers and officials all enter the Reverent Splendor Heaven, where they receive further scriptures and enjoy boundless blessings.

The Dao Lord said: "I speak of this to show you the essential method, so that in the future, men and women and all sentient beings with the mind to turn toward the Dao may take refuge in the true Way, seeking deliverance and becoming a field of merit for birth and death. If, on the great festival days of the Three Primes, they perform the Great Offering of the Dark Capital, make offerings to the Heavenly Worthy and the Daoist practitioners, practice the Dao and recite scriptures, arouse even a single virtuous thought, and pray with unwavering sincerity, then in the past, present, and future three times, they shall gain immeasurable, inconceivable merit."

**Verified Attainment, Chapter Twenty-One**

The Dao Lord addressed Universal Salvation, saying: "If good men and good women can arouse the one mind, copy scriptures and cast images, establish temples to deliver beings, practice charity, observe fasts, uphold precepts, advance with vigor, endure humiliation, and maintain purity—whether great or small, provisional or real, profound or shallow, beginning or end—all must be genuine, with witnesses to attest. One must not outwardly feign reputation while inwardly lacking true substance. Those who seek empty fame without sincerity, even if they practice the Dao, recite scriptures, burn incense, bow in worship, dwell in mountains, enter seclusion, abstain from grains, relieve distress, aid the poor, cultivate truth, and study the Dao, if their devotion is not wholehearted, they will fail to achieve spiritual resonance.

There was once a man named Liu Huangmin, whose family was exceedingly wealthy. He commissioned scriptures and images, burned incense, and bowed in worship, inviting Daoist practitioners to observe fasts and recite scriptures. Yet his heart was not fully devoted; he sought only fame."

Within a hundred years, the body dies and transforms into a phoenix. After sixty years, it reverts to human form, the family grows exceedingly wealthy, and great merit is established. After thirty years, one achieves liberation through the corpse and enters the Azure Flower Palace. There was a man named Huang Anshi who entered the mountains to study the Dao. Within a stone chamber, he recited scriptures and bowed in worship, yet his heart was not wholly devoted, and he sought only to soar aloft. After forty years, he transformed into a soaring swan-goose. After ninety years, he was reborn as a woman, her form and countenance refined. Delighting in divine immortals, her sincerity moved heaven. After fifty years, the Radiant Jade Maiden descended and bestowed upon her the Five Sprouts Method of the Numinous Treasure. Practicing it for thirteen years, she ascended in broad daylight and entered the Yellow Canopy Heaven, becoming a Heavenly Maiden, where she has lived for seven thousand years.

There was a man named Wang Ziqui who abstained from grains and lived alone in the empty mountains, yet cultivated no other practices. After sixty years, he transformed into blue stone. Thirty years later, thunder split the stone asunder, and from within emerged a dragon that entered the Golden Hall Mountain, dwelling among the scripture halls of Daoist practitioners. After eight years, hearing Daoists recite scriptures and observe precepts, he transformed and was reborn at the gate of the Pure Brahmā King, where he established great merit. After twenty-four years, the Eastern Flower Perfected One secretly transmitted the divine elixir. Consuming it, he lived for three hundred years. With a heart ever earnest, he encountered an assembly of Daoists who bestowed upon him this scripture. Cultivating it for sixteen years, he ascended in broad daylight and became the Great Ultimate Immortal King.

There was a man named Han Yuanshou who secluded himself in meditation, reciting scriptures without single-minded devotion. One day, heavenly fire burned his dwelling, and the scriptures flew up to heaven. Over ninety years, Yuanshou transformed into a spirit of wood.

There was a man named Li Zhengxuan, originally a hunter who roamed the mountains in pursuit of game. Arriving at a mountain, he encountered a Daoist studying the Dao and devoted himself wholeheartedly to serving him. For thirty years, he toiled without retreat. The Daoist asked, "Do you wish to attain longevity?" Zhengxuan bowed deeply and replied, "Even birds and mice cling to life. I wish to be granted extended years. I shall serve you all my life without complaint or negligence." The Daoist said, "Simply pay homage to that withered tree at the foot of this mountain, and you shall naturally gain something." Zhengxuan then worshipped it day and night. After thirteen years, the withered tree blossomed with extraordinary radiance. Knowing his sincerity, the Daoist bestowed upon him this scripture. After thirty years, he soared through the empty void.

There was a man named Zhong Qi Ling who entered the mountains to study the Dao. For a hundred years, his sincerity and resolve were unwavering. Heavenly demons descended to test him, transforming into a starving tiger that entered his chamber. Qi Ling stretched out his leg to it. The demon, perceiving his heart, reverted to its true form. The Celestial Clerk of Immortals and the Five Thearch Perfected Ones descended to bestow upon him this scripture. After seventeen years, he gained mastery over transformations and entered Mount Penglai.

There was a man named An Duming who recited scriptures in the mountains for thirty-seven years. The Central Yellow Perfected One transformed into a hunter and offered him a venomous serpent. Duming joyfully accepted it, and the serpent turned into golden lingzhi. The Central Yellow, moved by his steadfast heart, bade him consume the lingzhi. His body emitted golden light. For five hundred years, he wandered the Five Marchmounts and became the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate.

There was a man named Zhou Huihua who delighted in almsgiving, aiding the poor, and enduring hardship without weariness. The Wisdom Contemplation Perfected One disguised himself as an ordinary man and sought alms from him. Huihua, moved with compassion, gave tenfold more than usual. The Perfected One then feigned illness, lying bedridden for three hundred days, emitting foul odors. Huihua showed no sign of disgust. One night, the Perfected One said to him, "I knew your utmost sincerity and came to test you." Huihua bowed and replied, "This foolish one lacks understanding. I have been mistakenly praised. I wish to attain extended years." Thereupon, he was granted the divine elixir. Consuming it, he lived for eight thousand years. Cultivating this scripture, he now serves as the Western Flower Immortal.

There was a man named Zhang Yanguang who served Daoist practitioners for seventy-three years, unwavering from beginning to end, his heart never faltering. The Responding World Perfected One disguised himself as a Daoist, his appearance emaciated, his clothing foul and filthy, and sought lodging. Soon after, he fell ill and died within seven days, his body swiftly decaying. Yanguang mourned him more deeply than for his own kin. The Responding World Perfected One, recognizing his utmost sincerity, revived and bestowed upon him this scripture. After two hundred years, he became ageless and entered Mount Fulai.

There was a man named Qiu Baoxiang who cultivated the Dao in Mount Tongbai for three hundred and sixty years, having already attained extended life. One day, the Wheel Heaven Lad disguised himself as a hunter and sought shelter with him. In the night, he set fire to Baoxiang’s dwelling. Baoxiang showed no change of expression. The lad then transmitted to him the Dao of liberation through transformation, and one day, he flew into the Purple Empyrean.

There was a man named Zhao Changming, a Daoist of Mount Taihe who entered Mount Haiyu to study the Dao for over seven hundred years. One day, mountain spirits, great deities, and various demons came to test Changming. Some appeared as immortals, others as Confucian scholars, now soaring, now crouching, transforming in myriad ways. Changming said to them, "You are mere mountain sprites and petty ghosts. How dare you disturb me?" Thereupon, he pointed at them with the scripture, and each reverted to their true forms, cupping their hands in reverence. The Daoist then expounded the Dharma and administered the precepts. Three hundred years later, the mountain spirits transformed into benevolent deities and presented Changming with these blossoms and fruits, recounting their past karmic ties and seeking to receive the precepts anew. Changming then performed repentance rites and administered the precepts. After a hundred years, he was reborn in the Pure Brahmā Realm as the daughter of a wealthy family, her form and countenance refined, her wisdom and intelligence keen. Delighting in scriptures and the Dharma, she established great merit and became a female Daoist. After forty-seven years of diligently reciting scriptures and precepts, the Golden Flower Jade Maiden bestowed upon her this scripture. One day, she entered the Earth Lung Mountain and gained thirty thousand years of life, now serving as the Perfected Consort of the Great Ultimate.

When Perfected Ones descend to test disciples, they may disguise themselves as the poor and lowly, the hungry and cold, the gravely ill, the maimed, or those begging for children. They may appear as worthies, heavenly demons, or transform into spirits and goblins—changing in countless ways to refine and test cultivators.

Only when their sincerity is fully realized does the initiation of deliverance begin. All future men and women should take heed of this.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Gate of Gathering Causes**

Puji asked: "Sentient beings are boundless, their perceptions and views diverse. They create good and evil causes, their roots and foundations differing. If we were to universally open the Ten Divisions, our wisdom and strength would not suffice. Yet if we preach the One Vehicle, awakening and understanding would be difficult to attain. How, then, should we determine the proper approach?"

The Dao Lord replied: "By responding to their capacities to awaken, no method fails to gather them in. Knowing the essentials, one may yet open the way. For those suited to the middle, what approach would not be fitting?"

Puji said: "The principle of essentials is precisely what I wish to hear."

The Dao Lord replied: "If sentient beings delight in killing, harming, and injuring, then gather them through the Gate of Compassion. If they steal or plunder, gather them through the Gate of Righteous Sharing. If they indulge in licentiousness, gather them through the Gate of Chastity. If they are miserly and greedy, gather them through the Gate of Generosity. If they are wrathful and contentious, gather them through the Gate of Joy. If they are foolish and deluded, gather them through the Gate of Expedient Means. If they engage in frivolous speech, gather them through the Gate of Simplicity and Rectitude. If they lie and deceive, gather them through the Gate of Trust and Compliance. If they curse and revile, gather them through the Gate of Recitation and Invocation. If they slander and malign, gather them through the Gate of Exposition and Teaching. If they are arrogant and contemptuous, gather them through the Gate of Reverence and Worship. If they are stubborn and overbearing, gather them through the Gate of Gentleness and Humility. If they disbelieve in karma, past lives, and destiny, gather them through the Gate of Causes and Conditions. If they cling to existence or nonexistence, gather them through the Gate of the Middle Way. If they discriminate between self and other, gather them through the Gate of Equality. If they are greedy, filthy, and defiled, gather them through the Gate of Purity. If they are rigid and unyielding, gather them through the Gate of Cyclic Transformation. If they ceaselessly create and act, gather them through the Gate of Non-Action. If they are narrow and unchanging, gather them through the Gate of All-Pervading Penetration. If they are restless and competitive, gather them through the Gate of Stillness and Concentration. If they are sorrowful and joyless, gather them through the Gate of Carefree Ease. If they are bound by afflictions, gather them through the Gate of Liberation. Through these twenty-four gates, all are constantly gathered in, and sentient beings attain peace and happiness—is this not essential?"

Puji said: "Though this is essential, it still seems too numerous. Formerly, the Heavenly Worthy taught the principle of no-characteristics, gathering and transforming sentient beings through the truth of non-form. Could it not be simplified further?"

The Dao Lord replied: "That was the form of no-form, uniting all in the One Vehicle. Here, the forms of form are shown, seeking to harmonize the myriad dharmas."

Puji said: "If that was no-form, from what did the no-form unite the One Vehicle? Now that form is shown, how can form harmonize the myriad dharmas?"

The Dao Lord replied: "The no-form of form is absent, and thus its form unites the One Vehicle. The form of form is extinguished, and thus its form seeks to harmonize the myriad dharmas."

Puji said: "If form exists, then it is bound to form—how can it harmonize? If form is absent, then it is formless—from what does it unite?"

The Dao Lord replied: "Originally, form was taken as no-form, and thus through its absence it could unite. Form extinguishes form, and through extinction it can harmonize."

Puji said: "Could one not simply gather through non-gathering, without further expounding the gathering of causes?"

The Dao Lord replied: "I originally gathered and transformed sentient beings through non-gathering. Yet sentient beings have not awakened, so I speak of gathering. If sentient beings awaken, there is also no gathering of causes."

**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Chapter on Generation and Transformation**

The Dao Lord said: "When heaven and earth were yet undivided, all was chaotic and indistinct, a formless expanse. The wondrous transformation of the Primordial Beginning turned and unfolded: the pure qi ascended and congealed to form heaven; the turbid qi descended and solidified to form earth. The essence of yang became the sun; the essence of yin became the moon. The essences of the sun and moon became the stars. Harmonious qi became humans; peripheral qi became beasts; dense qi became birds; attached qi became insects; and spirits established images. Species mutually arose, converging to generate and nurture. Each had its causes and conditions, following its karmic retribution, drifting or sinking as fate decreed. Some were foolish, some wise; some benighted, some enlightened; some great, some small; some turbid, some pure; some long-lived, some short-lived; some base, some noble—thousands of distinctions, myriad forms, all received their shapes from the Dao. They devoured one another, the strong preying upon the weak, deceit and cunning arising between them, with sin and blessing crisscrossing. Those who cultivated goodness obtained blessing; those who created evil incurred punishment.

The Primordial Beginning, mindful of the world, taught and transformed humanity, from kalpa to kalpa, their number like the sands of the Ganges. The unfolding of heaven and earth, the generation of yin and yang—none of this was not brought about by the Primordial Beginning. When the Primordial Beginning appeared in the world during the Dragon Han era to teach and transform, he was called the Formless, sheltering all beings and saving sentient beings. In the Yan Kang era, he governed the turning of the kalpa and was called the Nameless, spreading transformation through the lands and delivering gods and humans. When the Red Radiance dawned, he was again called the Brahmanic Form, descending to save beings, his compassionate aid boundless. In the Kai Huang era, he was called the Void Sovereign, shaping and molding the cosmos and giving rise to the consciousness of beings. When the Supreme Sovereign arose, he was called the Primordial Beginning in totality, gathering and transforming all heavens.

The Primordial Beginning’s turning of the wheel is cyclical, beginning and ending without cease, like the four seasons, returning endlessly. Adapting to beings, he assumes myriad forms and countless names—sometimes ordinary, sometimes sacred; sometimes wise, sometimes foolish. Riding clouds and commanding qi, clad in yellow robes and black caps, dragon robes and tiger belts, with jade countenances and golden visages—sometimes great, sometimes small, entering and exiting without obstruction, generating and transforming all things, sheltering and protecting sentient beings. The ignorant, lost in darkness—who can fathom him? Now, I have received the mandate to govern the Dharma Wheel, to uphold and practice the teachings of the scriptures, and dare not transgress."

You, men and women, should each devote yourselves wholeheartedly.

Pujì asked: "The Heavenly Worthy has often spoken of kalpas—how many years does one kalpa comprise?"

"How many kalpas have passed since the Heavenly Worthy attained the Dao?"

The Dao Lord replied: "A kalpa is the name for the transformation of heaven and earth. There are two kinds: the great kalpa and the small kalpa.

The great kalpa refers to the uppermost three realms and eighteen heavens, and the lowermost nine layers and thirty-six earths—where the disasters of water, fire, and wind burn, scour, and sweep away all beings within, leaving none remaining. In darkness profound, without light or form, the Three Caverns’ great Dharma, those who study the Dao and realize truth, are welcomed below by dragon chariots and all ascend to the Brahman conduct. All miscellaneous lesser teachings that do not enter the Great Vehicle perish with the kalpa, reduced to ashes.

The small kalpa refers to the impermanence of all formed beings, moment by moment, where worlds change and forms shift—this is called a kalpa. Yet the karmic fruits of sentient beings, their encounters with conditions, vary in duration: some brief, some long, some prolonged, some hastened. If one cultivates wholesome thoughts and the Dao, upholds precepts and holds to the scriptures, then days and months are extended, and one’s allotted lifespan is fulfilled. If one commits manifold transgressions and disbelieves in causes and conditions, then days and months are cut short, and a hundred years remain unfulfilled. The number of years—whether many or few—cannot be known by calculation; only by analogy can one grasp their measure.

Consider a great stone, perfectly square on all four sides, each face four hundred *li* wide, and equally high. A flying deity brushes it once every nine years with an object as light as a fly’s wing—when the stone is worn away, that is one kalpa.

Or consider a city, perfectly square on all four sides, each face four hundred *li* wide, and equally high, filled to the brim with mustard seeds. A flying deity removes one seed every nine years—when the mustard seeds are exhausted, that is one kalpa.

Or consider a square enclosure, each side four hundred *li* wide, filled with fine dust. A flying being removes one speck of dust every seven years—when the dust is gone, that is one kalpa.

Pujì, reflect on these three analogies, and you may grasp their measure. As for the number of kalpas since I attained the Dao—even if counted by these three, it cannot be known."

Pujì said: "Now that I have heard the Heavenly Worthy’s wondrous discourse, all doubts are dispelled—it is inconceivable, inconceivable."

*Thus concludes Scroll Nine of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Karmic Retribution and Causes and Conditions.*

*Scroll Ten of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Karmic Retribution and Causes and Conditions begins: The Broad Governance, Chapter Twenty-Four.*

The Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected One of Universal Salvation, on account of karmic retribution and causes and conditions, inquired of the Most High. At that time, the Most High Lord of the Dao said:

In the worlds of the ten directions, each has five billion, five myriad, five thousand, five hundred fifty-five billion, five myriad, five thousand, five hundred fifty heavens, arranged in ordered domains and established as celestial palaces. Above the heavens and below the earth, below the earth and above the heavens, sun, moon, and stars, mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams—condensing qi and soaring clouds—form palaces of gold and jade, halls of treasure and chambers of jasper, halls of rosy clouds and purple abodes, star gardens and cloud forests, phoenix courtyards and simurgh gardens. Suspended in the void, spanning the space beside sun and moon, dividing realms and arranging precincts, they bear ten thousand kinds and a thousand names, filling all without gap.

Perfected Immortals and Supreme Sages, Celestial Emperors and Celestial Masters dwell in each place, each expounding scriptures and teachings. They oversee registers and records, the causes and conditions of life and death, the fate of men and women, good and evil, fortune and misfortune, examining and assessing day and night, distinguishing between humans and heavens. Within each direction, within each heaven, there is the Great Dao, there is the Heavenly Worthy, there is the Celestial Emperor, there is the Celestial Master, there are Perfected Immortals and hosts of sages, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, envoys and generals, spirits of good and evil, the Five Dipper numina—each teaching and establishing different laws. All are governed and transformed by me.

Karmic retribution of good and evil, the life roots of men and women, the pairing of sin and blessing, the causes and conditions of past lives, even the grasses, insects, and all sentient beings—none do not await my dispensation of qi to receive life.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Assembly of Perfected Ones**

The Lord of the Dao addressed Universal Salvation, saying: All that has form is entirely fleeting and illusory, perishing in every thought, never pausing for even a moment—suffering and affliction in the cycle of rebirth. Ordinary beings, unaware, shuttle through the Three Paths, enduring myriad kalpas of bitterness, receiving bodily forms and suffering the fetters of affliction. All arises from deluded thoughts and inverted views, fixating the mind.

You men and women must extinguish all deluded thoughts. When deluded thoughts are extinguished, you will then meet the true and real. You must stabilize your resolve, contemplate all dharmas with stillness, and see that none are not empty. Both within and without, self and mind are wholly dissolved, freed from all fetters. You will ascend the gate of liberation, enter and exit with ease, abide in non-action and spontaneity, neither born nor destroyed, forever severing the causes of suffering.

Universal Salvation said: Sentient beings suffer affliction, ever bound to bodily form, trapped in the cycle of birth and death, unable to free themselves. By what expedient means may deluded thoughts be removed?

The Lord of the Dao said: The deluded thoughts and inverted views of sentient beings all arise from the mind. They forcibly generate distinctions, fixating on the self, deluded by contact with phenomena, every thought a delusion. Due to this error, they are inverted and submerged, drifting in the cycle of birth and death, unable to free themselves. You must stabilize your resolve and contemplate the body with wisdom: bones, flesh, skin, limbs, hair, the six senses, the four great elements, the five constituents, and the hundred spirits. Examine and reflect carefully—there is no true substance. All are temporary aggregates, coalescing to form what seems real. Search within and without—where is the self to be found? Since the body is illusory, the mind becomes empty. Empty and illusory are not real; all are deluded thoughts. Once the delusion of the body is extinguished, all dharmas are likewise. Self and other, right and wrong, love and hate, grasping and rejecting, desire for form, scent, and taste, jealousy, stinginess, greed, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, deceitful speech, harsh words, divisive speech—all such karmic actions are extinguished in an instant. Within and without are purified and void, and you will naturally meet the true Dao.

Universal Salvation said: Though the body is fleeting and illusory, it is a clod with form. Pain, itching, soreness, and ache, wind, cold, heat, and dampness—internal and external movements and contacts assail it in every thought. The slightest disharmony brings worry and affliction. How, through contemplation, may these be swiftly extinguished?

The Lord of the Dao said: All is delusion; I do not deceive you. All that has form is entirely fleeting and illusory. Because it is fleeting and illusory, it is impermanent in every thought. Sentient beings cling and perceive it as real. If you know the body is not real, all suffering vanishes. Simply forget the self, and all afflictions are extinguished. How then could there be pain, itching, soreness, or ache?

Universal Salvation said: The deluded thoughts of sentient beings are deeply entrenched. To suddenly forget the self is truly impossible. By what expedient means may they be gradually shown the causes and conditions?

The Lord of the Dao said: I previously stated that you must stabilize your resolve and contemplate the body with wisdom, carefully examining and reflecting that there is no true substance. This is how I gradually instruct sentient beings to remove deluded thoughts and clinging. The reason sentient beings cannot yet remove them is that the six senses and three karmas are not purified.

Universal Salvation said: How may the six senses and three karmas be purified?

The Lord of the Dao said: The six senses are: first, the eye sense; second, the ear sense; third, the nose sense; fourth, the tongue sense; fifth, the body sense; sixth, the mind sense. They are called the six senses because they generate all karmic actions. Like grasses and trees producing flowers and leaves, seeds and fruits generating one another, they give rise to the six emotions, six desires, six defilements, six entrances, six thieves, six dusts, and six consciousnesses.

Form, sound, scent, taste, touch, and dharmas are fundamentally empty and quiescent, unmoving to body and mind. Sentient beings cling and deludedly grasp and reject, racing in every thought, fettered by affliction. Due to these causes and conditions, they drift in the cycle of birth and death. If you can employ wisdom and resolve, carefully reflect, and awaken to these six senses, then all senses will be exhausted.

The three karmas are: first, bodily karma; second, mental karma; third, verbal karma. Bodily karma includes killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. Mental karma includes greed, hatred, and delusion. Verbal karma includes deceitful speech, false speech, harsh speech, and divisive speech—together forming the ten evils. Carefully reflect on these ten: not one is real; all are fleeting and illusory, hence deluded thoughts. Simply gradually extinguish the three karmas and the six senses, diminishing them again and again. Stabilize your resolve and contemplate the body. If you can practice this for a long time, you will naturally meet the true Dao.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: On the Teachings**

The Dao Lord said:
In the beginning, the Primordial One transformed *qi* into three *qi*, dividing them into the Three Heavens.

The first is the Primordial *Qi*, forming the Qingwei Heaven, known as the Jade Pure Realm. This is the transformation of the Heavenly Treasure Lord, from which emerged the Twelve Divisions of the *Dongzhen* Scriptures, teaching the Nine Saints of Heaven.

The second is the Original *Qi*, forming the Yuyu Heaven, known as the Supreme Pure Realm. This is the transformation of the Numinous Treasure Lord, from which emerged the Twelve Divisions of the *Dongxuan* Scriptures, teaching the Nine Perfected of Heaven.

The third is the Mysterious *Qi*, forming the Great Red Heaven, known as the Grand Pure Realm. This is the transformation of the Divine Treasure Lord, from which emerged the Twelve Divisions of the *Dongshen* Scriptures, teaching the Nine Immortals of Heaven.

These thirty-six divisions are also called the Three Vehicles: the Great Vehicle, the Middle Vehicle, and the Lesser Vehicle. They coalesce from the soaring mysterious *qi*, naturally forming chapters—jade characters in golden script, dragon patterns and phoenix seals—each spanning a square *zhang* with eight radiant corners, their luminous teachings circulating throughout the heavens.

From the world’s beginning to its end, through five kalpas, the Dharma Wheel turns ceaselessly, sometimes real, sometimes expedient, now vast, now concise, adapting to capacities to awaken understanding and guide practice in each age. Though heaven and earth may end their course, the Three Caverns remain indestructible, liberating all beings, guiding gods and humans. The Three Realms and the Ten Directions all receive its benefits.

Pujì asked: When did the Three Caverns descend into the world? Did they arrive together, or in succession?

The Dao Lord said:
At the dawn of each kalpa, the *Dongzhen* teachings descend first. People embrace the Dao and hold to virtue, dwelling together in emptiness and non-being, all upholding the true and real, attaining long life without death.

Next, the *Dongxuan* teachings descend. Humanity gradually drifts apart, simplicity scatters, and purity thins; the Dao is lost, and virtue betrayed.

Then the *Dongshen* teachings descend. People grow ever more frivolous, forsaking the true and real, their lifespans shortening.

After this, the human heart decays, the Three Caverns cease to spread, wisdom does not flourish, humans and ghosts intermingle, and the kalpa’s span hastens, falling short of a hundred years. Impermanence prevails in every thought, and death follows without end.

I then reappear in the world, proclaiming the Three Caverns, disseminating their teachings among humanity, adapting to the capacities of each age. I expound the scriptures—sometimes grand, sometimes modest—according to what suits the beings.

Thus, the original texts of the Primordial Beginning were not fully transmitted below. In the Three Pure Realms above and the Four Brahmā Heavens, the true saints cultivate practice, and their texts are complete. Though mountains, rivers, grottoes, and palaces, as well as the immortal abodes of seas and peaks, may have their own practices, these are not fully comprehensive.

Therefore, I commanded Laozi to incarnate in the human realm, to save and deliver all beings, expounding precepts and regulations. Whether among the Yi or the Xia, whether sage or commoner, throughout the Ten Directions, all are enabled to attain liberation.

The great Dharma of the Three Caverns has spread among humanity, exhorting men and women to diligently cultivate and practice. Those who have amassed great sins, burdened by karmic obstructions and sunk in delusion, having no affinity with the Dao, cannot believe or uphold it. They turn instead to false teachings, worshipping various demonic spirits, exhausting their lives in vain, and ultimately descending into hell.

If one can believe in and practice the great Dharma of the Three Caverns, they will enter the Hall of Blessings. Some ascend in broad daylight, some attain liberation through *shijie*, concealing their traces and dwelling in grotto palaces, roaming the world, changing their names to attain long life, enduring through endless kalpas. They refine *qi* and transform their forms, turning spirit to merge with the Dao, unrecognized by others, boundless and infinite.

After my departure, demonic teachings will flourish, and the world will uniformly follow them. People will die young, and warfare, floods, fires, illnesses, and deaths will follow one after another. Nations will fall, families will perish, and these calamities will occur morning and night. Granaries will be emptied to serve demonic and false cults, deceit and corruption will multiply daily, and the age will be swept by frivolity and distortion. Hunger, cold, and suffering will afflict all; fathers and sons will be scattered and displaced. The world will sink into utter ignorance, never to awaken.

I pity you, who have been submerged for kalpas on end, and so I speak these essential words to open the eyes and ears of the blind and deaf.

The scriptures and teachings of the Three Caverns comprise two types: the true Dharma and the adapted Dharma.

The true Dharma is free from all falsity and endures forever.

The adapted Dharma, transmitted through written words, changes and perishes with the times. Within the adapted Dharma, there are five varieties:

First, the coalescence of soaring mysterious *qi*, forming cloud-seals into chapters, their combinations natural and transformations unfathomable. These reside in the Three Pure Realms above, eternally enshrined in the scriptures, enduring for countless kalpas under the protection of true saints.

Second, cloud-script spanning a *zhang*, its eight corners radiant, circulating through the Three Realms and Ten Directions among the five billion heavens, ascending and descending with the kalpas, responding to conditions and spreading transmission.

Third, inscribed and recited in the halls, pavilions, terraces, and chambers of the heavenly palaces, as well as on their gates and doors, to subdue beings and guide their entry into cultivation.

Fourth, floral scripts on jade tablets, bound in precious volumes, found in the square *zhang* of Penglai, the paradises of Lang, and the gardens of Xuanpu. They appear and vanish with the kalpas, teaching gods, immortals, and various demonic spirits.

Fifth, written on paper, silk, bamboo, and wood with ink and lacquer, scattered among humanity, transmitted and recited. They descend at the kalpa’s beginning and ascend at its end, protecting nations, pacifying people, and liberating all beings.

The scriptures are the words of the Primordial Beginning, teaching and transforming beings, enabling them to recognize the root and origin, past-life causes and conditions, the retribution of sin and blessing, the auspices of good and evil, the gates of life and death, and the expedient means of practice. Now, turning from evil to embrace goodness, one preserves and secures life, attains long life and non-action, and returns to the Dao, becoming a model for endless kalpas. Those who uphold them receive blessings; those who cultivate them become immortals.

I have inherited the teachings of the Primordial Beginning to enlighten gods and humans, solely to rescue beings from suffering. You should uphold them.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: On Dissemination**

The Dao Lord addressed Pujì, saying:
From the creation of heaven and earth to the era of the Supreme Sovereign, I have passed through countless kalpas, beyond measure. The teachings I have manifested and the incarnations I have assumed are likewise innumerable.

In the heavens above and the world below, boundless and infinite, I revolve and transform, adapting to conditions to liberate beings. Sometimes I am called the Primordial Beginning, sometimes the Empty Sovereign, sometimes the Most High Heavenly Worthy, sometimes the Boundless, sometimes the Spontaneous, sometimes the Non-Action, sometimes the Great Dao, sometimes the Formless, sometimes the Lofty, sometimes the Nameless, sometimes the Utmost Real, sometimes the Jade Emperor, sometimes the Golden Sovereign, sometimes the Dao Lord, sometimes the Heavenly Elder, sometimes Lord Lao, sometimes the Ancient One, sometimes the Master, sometimes the Great Thousand, sometimes the Dharma King...

Sometimes I am called the Transformation Lord of the Ten Directions, sometimes the Great Master of the Three Realms, sometimes the Supreme Dharma King, sometimes the Great Sage Perfected Sovereign, sometimes the Wheel-Turning Transformation Lord, sometimes the Compassionate Dharma King, sometimes the Supreme Dharma Master, sometimes the Venerable One in Heaven, sometimes the Perfected Lords of the Eight Poles, sometimes the Sage Lord of the Nine Heavens, sometimes the Transformation Lord of the Three Thousand, sometimes the Heavenly Lords of the Five Hundred Million, sometimes the Teaching Lord of the Great Brahma-Heaven, sometimes the Guide of the Three Realms, sometimes the Mystic Dharma Master, sometimes the Transformation Lord of the Jade Palace, sometimes the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal, sometimes the Dharma King of the Cavern of Reality, sometimes the Teaching Lord of the Cavern of Mystery, sometimes the Dharma Master of the Cavern of Spirits;

Sometimes the Supreme Dharma Master of the Three Caverns, sometimes the Divine Youth of the Three Heavens, sometimes the Wheel-Turning Perfected One, sometimes the Great Master of Longevity, sometimes the Divine Healer, sometimes the Most Victorious Medical King, sometimes the Great Lineage Dharma Master, sometimes the Heavenly Master of Myriad Dharmas, sometimes the Sacred Venerable of the Dharma Realm, sometimes the Wheel-Turning Divine Youth, sometimes the Radiant Perfected One, sometimes the Moonlight Perfected One, sometimes the Starlight Divine Youth, sometimes the Dharma Master of Myriad Ways, sometimes the Dao Lord of Jade Clarity, sometimes the Mystic Ancestor of Highest Clarity, sometimes the Immortal King of Grand Clarity, sometimes the Transformation Lord of the Three Paths, sometimes the Great Master of the Nine Dark Realms.

Sometimes I appear as a Heavenly King, sometimes as a Heavenly Lord, sometimes as a Heavenly Emperor, sometimes as a King, sometimes as an Imperial Teacher, sometimes as a Daoist priest, sometimes as a Confucian master, sometimes as a great minister, sometimes as a National Preceptor, sometimes as a Heavenly Immortal, sometimes as an Earthly Immortal.

Sometimes as a Flying Immortal, sometimes as the Mother of Myriad Beings, sometimes as the Father of Myriad Beings. Sometimes in heaven as the Heavenly Emperor, sometimes on earth as a human king, sometimes in the sun as the Radiant Divine Youth, sometimes in the moon as the Moonlight Divine Youth, sometimes in the heavens as the Most High Heavenly Worthy, sometimes among the stars as the Heavenly Emperor of the Great Thearch. Sometimes as the Great Emperor of the Northern Pole, sometimes as the Divine Youth of the Seven Stars, sometimes as the Perfected Ones of the Five Emperors.

Sometimes among the stars as the Starlight Perfected One, sometimes in the clouds as the Cloud Master, sometimes in the wind as the Wind Earl. Sometimes as the Thunder Duke, sometimes as the Rain Master. Sometimes as a thousand-year-old elder, sometimes as a ten-thousand-year-old youth. Sometimes as a Dragon King, sometimes as a Ghost Lord.

My transformations are boundless, innumerable—sometimes ordinary, sometimes sacred; sometimes male, sometimes female; sometimes large, sometimes small; sometimes tall, sometimes short; sometimes water and fire arise from my body, sometimes my form becomes grass and trees. In all these manifold transformations, I teach and transform beings, expounding scriptures and teachings to liberate gods and humans, revolving through kalpas while eternally abiding in tranquil clarity.

Sometimes I dispatch Perfected Ones and Jade Maidens to descend and transform, incarnating as emperors, kings, queens, consorts, and great ministers, employing skillful means to expound the Dharma and deliver sentient beings. Now I have told you but one or two of my names.

When heaven and earth first arose, at the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, I was called the Formless, transforming in the Jade Clarity Realm, revealing the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, descending to teach and transform as the Mystic Master of Myriad Heavens, the Supreme Dharma King. After ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million years, in the Yan Kang era, I was called the Nameless, transforming in the Highest Clarity Realm, revealing the *Cavern of Mystery Precious Scripture*; descending to teach and transform as the Medical King of the Three Realms, the Most High Perfected Sovereign.

After eighty-eight billion, eight hundred eighty-eight million years, in the Chi Ming Kai Yun era, I was called the Brahma Form, also named Avalokiteśvara, transforming in the Grand Clarity Realm, revealing the *Cavern of Spirits Immortal Scripture*; descending to teach and transform as the Guide of the Ten Directions, the Utmost Heavenly Worthy. After seventy-seven billion, seven hundred seventy-seven million years, when the Kai Huang era changed its name, I was called the Empty Sovereign, transforming in the Primordial Yang Palace, unfolding the Three Caverns; descending to the human realm as the Most High Dao Lord.

After sixty-six billion, six hundred sixty-six million years, reaching the Shang Huang era, I was called the Primordial Beginning, transforming in the Purple Tenuity Palace, broadly disseminating scriptures and precepts, causing innumerable hosts of Immortal Perfected Ones, Wondrously Practicing Perfected Ones, and Flying Heavenly Spirit Kings to each transform in the human realm, liberating all beings. Such is my revolving transformation—it is likewise inexhaustible.

From kalpa to kalpa, from heaven to heaven, I manifest true responsive transformation bodies according to the times, establishing names in accord with the world, altering forms and titles in myriad differences—yet all are my single body. Sometimes I provisionally assume the roles of master and disciple to awaken one another; sometimes I employ expedient means of priority and sequence to instruct gods and humans.

Now, I entrust this scripture to you for dissemination, that above and below in the heavens, throughout the ten directions and three realms, all men and women may universally witness the Dharma’s resonance.

Pujì proclaimed: Today, I receive the Celestial Worthy’s decree to liberate gods and humans. May I borrow divine power to proclaim this to all heavens, that all may universally hear and know.

The Most High flicked a finger, addressing the assembly of Perfected Ones: Above and below in the heavens, throughout the three realms and ten directions, all divine spirits, Immortal Perfected Ones, and hosts of Sages—this scripture I now entrust to Pujì. Each of you should widely propagate it.

Thereupon, the sacred multitudes of the heavens adorned their jeweled thrones, raised banners and held canopies, burned incense and scattered blossoms. Phoenix carriages and simurgh canopies, thousands of chariots and myriad riders drifted through empty space, bowing in unison, thrice voicing their approval. They reverently received this scripture and returned each to their own abode.

Everywhere, they arrayed hundreds of thousands of myriads of seven-jeweled thrones, expounding day and night, chanting the numinous resonance. They burned myriad measures of sacred incense, scattered a hundred kinds of precious blossoms, performed the music of the ten thousand heavens, and lit lamps of ten thousand luminous spirits. They offered Dharma implements, exquisite foods, and rare delicacies—each in hundreds of thousands of myriads—encircling them on all sides in measureless abundance.

Then, with yellow jade as tablets and purple gold as script, they enshrined it within grotto-palace dragon halls, cloud chambers, and phoenix caskets, inscribing it as *The Most High Numinous Treasure Scripture of Karmic Retribution and Causal Conditions*. Thus concludes Scroll Ten of *The Most High Numinous Treasure Scripture of Karmic Retribution and Causal Conditions*.
