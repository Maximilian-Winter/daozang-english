**Items of Dharma Transmission:**

**Incantation for the Seal:**
Upon reciting the incantation, draw one breath of *qi* from the East.
The divine seal bears the true script, the tally of the Supreme Emperor.
The trust of the Three Realms, the guardian of all spirits.
Hold and employ it, and you shall merge with the Dao.
Those who betray the Dao shall be punished to the ninth generation.

**Incantation for the Mirror:**
Upon reciting the incantation, draw one breath of *qi* from the South.
The divine mirror shines with numinous radiance, reflecting the heart of the disciple.
It illumines the heavens, and the heavens become clear;
It illumines the earth, and the earth becomes level;
It illumines the person, and the person becomes sincere.
May my disciple ever remain as bright as the mirror.

**Incantation for the Water:**
Upon reciting the incantation, draw one breath of *qi* from the North.
The divine water flows with purity, like the nature of a filial child.
Flowing upward, it reverses; flowing downward, it follows.
Abiding in *qi*, it neither overflows nor wanes, settling naturally.
May my disciple ever remain as pure as the water.

**Incantation for the Register:**
Upon reciting the incantation, draw one breath of *qi* from the East.
The register, though a common object, reveals true sincerity.
When issuing forth, it serves the lord above; when returning, it serves father and elder brothers.
Neither covetous nor licentious, only truthful and sincere.
All actions are recorded therein; no true circumstance is concealed.
Those who violate this oath shall be bound by this covenant as the master is.

**Incantation for the Dharma Text:**
Upon reciting the incantation, draw one breath of *qi* from the West.
The numinous Dharma of the Most High delivers you from life and death.
Nine generations ascend to heaven; the Three Corpses abandon the body.
Those who devote themselves wholeheartedly shall see a hundred blessings arrive.
They shall ascend the ranks of immortals and reach the clouded heavens.
Those who violate the precepts and statutes shall be bound by this oath as the master is.

**Incantation for the Cinnabar Script:**
Upon reciting the incantation, draw one breath of *qi* from the East.
The numinous cinnabar of the Most High abides by the teachings of the sacred intent.
The nine chapters of true script may govern and manifest.
Dispel your deluded heart; be vigilant in what you hear and see.
Conceive it with focused mind, and the cinnabar shall complete its nine transformations.
In one year, it takes form; in nine years, it transmutes.
With one flight, you soar through the skies; in three years, you ascend to court.
Those who violate this pact shall face calamity and suffering at once, bound by this vow as the master is.

**Incantation for the Sword:**
Upon reciting the incantation, draw one breath of *qi* from the West.
The divine sword is not of iron but is forged from *qi* within the body.
Drawing upon the sun and moon, refining it with the essences of *bing* and *ding*.
After three years, the sword is complete, to slay demons and execute the wicked.
Do not kill the innocent; do not strike down loyal ministers.
Those who violate this and wield it recklessly shall be bound by this covenant as the master is.

Then draw one breath of *qi*, swallow it, and exhale it.
When returning the transmission to the father-master or revered elder, bow deeply, kneel, and hold the Dharma objects facing east toward the master, saying:
I have received the numinous Dharma, and the Dharma objects are now complete.
By the grace of encountering my sacred master, I have attained this profound meaning.
Having reached this point today, the favor truly originates from you.
I beseech my master and father to pity my foolish sincerity.
Exert yourself alongside me; let our aspiration for learning never wane.
Should I violate these precepts, may I suffer punishment in Fengdu and be executed, extending to nine generations.

At this moment, the master must not abandon themselves to negligence.
The master transmits, and the disciple bows twice more, then kneels together to honor the ancestral masters and give thanks to the Supreme Emperor.
Exhale one breath of *qi*.
If transmitting to a first disciple, proceed one by one as above before completing the initiation.

**Incantation for the Dharma Objects:**
May my disciple of the Dharma never lose the heart of a beginner.
First revere the grace of heaven and earth, then honor the bonds of lord and father.
If the study bears fruit, both master and disciple shall ascend together.
Should one slight the master’s teachings, they shall sink into eternal perdition.
Exhale one breath of *qi*.
Kneel and give thanks as before.

**Method for Wearing the Sun and Treading the Dipper:**
Use the day’s position; at sunrise, precisely align and visualize the image upon the head.
To tread the Dipper is to pace the Dipper’s steps.
Turn seven times and return to *yin*, beginning from *chou* and moving leftward.

**Deities and Generals of the Monthly Altar and Subsidiary Courts to be Invoked:**
