### **Memorial Format**
[Your Name], if two or more, write "[Your Names] et al."
[Content of the memorial].

[Your Name], with utmost reverence and awe—if offering congratulations, write "with utmost joy and exultation"; the closing follows accordingly.
*Kowtow, kowtow.*
[Content of the memorial].

Respectfully submit this memorial.
For congratulatory memorials, petitions for exemption, or requests, adjust the phrasing as appropriate.

*To be made known:*
[Your Name], with utmost reverence and awe, *kowtow, kowtow*, respectfully states.
[Year] [Month] [Day].
Submitted by [Official Title] [Your Name].

All memorials for presenting matters follow this format. For informal notes (*jian*), replace *kowtow* with *knock head* and omit the self-designation "your subject." Notes are used for matters below the Southern and Northern Dippers.

### **Petition Format**
[Your Bureau], if submitting on your own behalf, include your official title.
[Matter at hand].

If submitting without a specific matter, begin here: "Your subject [Your Name]."
[Content of the petition].

If listing multiple matters, write: "The above matters are as stated."
Respectfully record and submit; if no matter is listed at the end, simply state "to be made known."
Respectfully submit.
[Year] [Month] [Day].
Submitted by [Official Title] [Your Name].

For all petitions, attach a yellow paper strip to the front and cover with the matter at hand. Also, note the date and time of submission on the front.
For petitions requesting action, affix beside the date: "Requesting issuance to [Recipient]." If borrowing an official seal, state it here.
For dispatched officials, also affix: "Your subject is currently at [Location] and departed for [Destination] on [Month] [Day]."
The above applies to memorials and petitions as appropriate.

**Seal:**
Submitted by [Official Title] [Your Name], respectfully sealed.
For confidential seals (*shifeng*), write "respectfully sealed in confidence." Confidential seals are folded at the corner, doubly sealed at both ends with an official seal; if no seal is available, sign with your name.
Do not affix yellow paper to the seal.

For submissions from outside the capital, only affix "confidential" or "urgent."
For *notes* (*zhazi*), omit official titles at the beginning, do not use "right," and omit the date.
For *memoranda* (*pouzi*), change "petition" to "memorandum," and end with "awaiting your decree," then proceed directly to the appropriate office without passing through subordinate bureaus.
For urgent matters, use *bazi* (short notes), which omit the date, are not full-width, and are not sealed, resembling small petitions.
For silent memorials, face north and silently present, then burn before you.
