**The Upper Clarity Scripture on Unbinding the Fetal Essence Knots: Ritual Instructions**

The upper region of the womb contains four knots: the first resides in the Mud-Pill Palace, the second in the mouth, the third in the cheeks, and the fourth in the Moon. To unbind these four upper knots, on the day of one’s life-destiny at dawn, enter a chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens. Strike the teeth nine times, and thrice invoke the taboo name of the Primordial Father, *Daohui*. Then bow three times toward the southeast, thrice invoking the taboo name of the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens, *Hundunhuan*.

Sit facing the direction of one’s life-destiny, close the eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: nine inches and nine parts in height, clad in a sash of dark-yellow plain numinous silk, his head adorned with a seven-tiered cap of pearls and jade, crowned with the *Wuji Jinxian* coronet. He dwells in the Supreme Ultimate Jade Palace of the Nine Heavens, the Cinnabar Numinous Realm of the Jade Treasure Prefecture within the Cavern Mystery Precinct. He rides a flying chariot of azure radiance, attended by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending into one’s body to govern the realm of the Mud-Pill Palace.

Next, visualize the Mysterious Mother: six inches and six parts in height, clad in a nine-colored sash of azure treasure, divine radiance, brocade, frost-like gauze, and embroidered silk. Her head is crowned with the *Ziyuan Xuanhuang* treasure coronet. She dwells in the Jade Grove of Sevenfold Radiance within the Cavern Mystery Prefecture of the Jade Treasure, the Ninefold Radiance Realm of the Upper Clarity Precinct above the Nine Qi of the Infinite. She rides a flying canopy of purple clouds and feathered essence, attended by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending into one’s body to govern the Cavern Chamber of the face.

Visualize the Father and Mother transforming into blue and yellow qi, intertwining and coiling above the head and face.

When complete, strike the teeth nine times and softly recite the incantation:
*"So-and-so (one’s name) receives the transformation of the Nine Numinosities, yet the knotted qi remain impure, obstructed and bound, congesting the numinous gates. Reverently, on this day of my life-destiny, I report to the lofty dawn: Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, descend to illuminate my body. The Eight Radiant Sceneries shine as one, the Nine Heavens unite in perfection. Together, unbind the four knots of the upper womb-root. Return the numinous to fill the gates, the nine apertures knotted into immortality. The inner embryo refines and transforms, the Nine Elixirs congeal the spirit. Blue transmutes to red, the two qi entwine. Longevity equals the Three Luminaries, eternally enjoying boundless years."*

When finished, swallow qi eighty-one times and cease.

Next, visualize the Heavenly King of *Yudan Wuliang*, surnamed *Hun*, taboo name *(Yu + Shi + Biao) (Yu + Shi + Biao) Luo*, clad in a nine-colored, seamless, naturally patterned fur robe, his head crowned with the *Yaojing Riyuan*. He governs the Infinite Mystery Terrace of the Heaven Without Measure, riding a nine-unicorn jade wheel, attended by twenty-four jade immortals.

Next, visualize the Heavenly King of *Shangshang Chanshan Wuliangshou*, surnamed *Xi*, taboo name *(Yu + Duo) (Yu + Shi) (Yu + Le)*, clad in a nine-colored fur robe of *Zhicheng* cloud patterns, his head crowned with the *Huijing Riguan*. He governs the Vermilion Grove Seven-Treasure Jade Terrace of the Heavenly King’s Realm, riding a twelve-black-tortoise flying canopy of azure feathers, attended by thirty-two jade lads of the Upper Palace.

Next, visualize the Heavenly King of *Xuyan*, surnamed *Zi*, taboo name *(Yu + Ti) (Yu + Tou) Luo*, clad in a nine-colored fur robe of *Sanfa* cloud patterns, his head crowned with the *Tianyuan Baoming*. He governs the Jade Capital Cloud Metropolis of Heaven, riding a nine-colored flying swan and threefold plain flying clouds, attended by twenty-four jade maidens of plain numinosity.

Visualize the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings descending together above one’s head and face, transforming into blue, purple, and yellow qi, swirling in primordial chaos like layered clouds. They enter through the apertures of the mouth, eyes, and nose, enveloping the entire face. Then, raise the head and pray:
*"Great Kings of the Three Heavens, Ninefold Mysterious Immortals, unbind for me the knots of the head’s barriers. Transform the Nine Elixirs naturally, descending upon the Golden Gate of Essence. Intermingle the clouds of the Three Perfected, flowing into my body to perfect my spirit. Scour away the qi of death, eradicate the womb-root. Fill and secure the numinous radiance, casting aside all calamities. Knot by knot, unbind; joint by joint, receive the Perfected. Mysterious radiance flows and spreads, penetrating the imperial abyss. My name is spoken in the Nine Heavens. Return the embryo to transform into an immortal. Inner fullness, outer abundance—within and without, I become a spirit."*

When finished, raise the head and swallow qi nine times, then cease.

Next, visualize the Eight Radiant Lads of the Upper Region.

With eyes closed, summon them:
- **Brain Spirit**, named *Juewuzi*, styled *Daodu*. One inch and two parts in height, clad in white brocade, his head crowned with a three-ridge treasure coronet.
- **Hair Spirit**, named *Xuanfuhua*, styled *Daoheng*. Two inches and one part in height, clad in dark-cloud brocade, his head crowned with the *Wuji Jinxian* coronet.

- **Tongue Spirit**, named *Shiliangzhi*, styled *Daoqi*. Seven inches in height, clad in a crimson brocade flying skirt, his head crowned with the *Jinxian* coronet.

Visualize the Eight Radiant Sceneries of the Upper Region, each settled in its proper place, all resembling the form of infants, arrayed in perfect order, as if seen face-to-face.

Then strike the teeth eight times and softly pray:
*"Upper Radiance, one region—eight spirits containing the Perfected. Knotted qi of the Nine Elixirs transform to perfect my body. A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders, dispersing like clouds and mist, descending to envelop the head and face. Bestow the numinous, spread the spirit. Above, unbind the knots; in the center, eradicate the womb-root; below, remove obstructions. Unblock and regulate the Three Barriers. The Eight Radiant Sceneries guard the body, sharing the same age as the numinous. Imperial Lord and Mysterious Mother, turn and return to the lofty dawn. Descend your jade splendor upon me, halt my decline, restore my freshness. Return my countenance to crimson youth, my face transformed into a Golden Immortal."*

Transforming the radiance to chase the lightning, one directly reaches the Gate of the Sun. Once complete, tilt the head back and swallow eight breaths to conclude, then ingest the talisman of the Nine Elixirs’ Yang Spirit. This talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on blue paper—three copies. Facing one’s life-star, strike the teeth nine times and softly intone:

*"Above, the Nine Qi transform; refining the hundred spirits within. Internally, the Six Palaces are ordered; externally, the Great Immortals descend. Imperial Lord in his station, Mysterious Mother brewing the divine fluid—unbind the knots, disperse the obstructions, sever and extinguish the womb-root. The body lightens, the flesh takes flight, responding to qi as naturally as breath. Ascend with me, together before the Emperor."*

Once complete, swallow the talisman and cease after nine gulps.

The Central Region contains four knots: the first knot resides within the Five Viscera; the second in the Great Granary; the third in the Large Intestine; and the fourth in the Small Intestine. To dissolve the four knots of the Central Region, on the day of one’s life-star at noon, enter the chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father. Strike the teeth nine times and thrice invoke the Primordial Father’s taboo name. Then turn toward the southeast and bow three times, facing the Mysterious Mother, thrice invoking the Mysterious Mother’s taboo name. Return to sit upright facing one’s current age, strike the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: nine inches and nine fen in height, draped in a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk, head crowned with a seven-tiered pearl-and-jade cap, the Limitless Advancement Noble Crown, dwelling in the Jade Palace of the Supreme Ultimate atop the Nine Heavens, within the Vermilion Spirit Precinct of the Jeweled Treasure Repository in the Cavernous Primordial Hamlet. He rides a flying chariot of azure mist, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest to enter the Five Viscera within one’s body.

Next, visualize the Mysterious Mother: six inches and six fen in height, clad in a nine-colored sash of luminous brocade and frost-like gauze, head crowned with the Purple Primordial Dark-Yellow Jeweled Crown, dwelling above the Nine Qi and the Limitless in the Sevenfold Radiance Vermilion Chamber of the Jeweled Grove, within the Jeweled Treasure Cavernous Primordial Repository of the Ninefold Radiance Precinct in the Upper Clarity Hamlet. She rides a purple-cloud flying canopy of feathered essence, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast to enter one’s Five Viscera.

Visualize the father and mother transforming into green and yellow qi, swirling in primordial chaos like a round sun, illuminating the Five Viscera, their radiance shining within and without. Tilt the head back and intone:

*"Father’s spirit, Mother’s essence—two qi conjoined as one. The Nine Elixirs coagulate and transform, knitting a womb of purple jade. Surveying the radiance of the Supreme Subtlety, the life-thread unites the Nine Spirits. Imperial Lord unfolds the spirit, flowing the true to irrigate life. The Five Viscera’s knots and networks, the Six Palaces cleansed and bright—stomach’s tube opens to clarity, the nine apertures gleam with light. Old knots scatter and vanish; a new embryo flourishes anew. Transforming the radiance, refining the marrow, crowned with the Nine Stars, the Three Luminaries winging the regions, flying into the Imperial Court."*

Once complete, cease after swallowing forty-five breaths.

Next, visualize the Heavenly King of Serene Stillness: surname Ban, taboo name Xia (雨+十+庆), clad in a seven-colored dragon-patterned robe of penetrating light, head crowned with the Yin Essence Night-Shining Diadem, governing atop the Vermilion Palace’s Jeweled Terrace. He rides an Eightfold Radiance Flying Wheel, accompanied by twelve Jade Immortals.

Then visualize the Heavenly King of Unyielding Joy: surname Ning, taboo name (雨+十+湏)(雨+十+注)(雨+十+持) Wu, clad in a nine-colored robe of flying-frost cloud-patterned brocade, head crowned with the Azure Florescence Year-Star Dark Essence, governing in the Nine-Tiered Jade Terrace of the Heavenly Radiance Vermilion Chamber. He rides a chariot of white deer and cinnabar mist, accompanied by twenty-six Jade Immortals of the Upper Palace.

Then visualize the Heavenly King of Responsive Transformation: surname Hui, taboo name (雨+十+稣)(雨+十+越) Yue, clad in a nine-colored robe of flowing-light radiant cloud brocade, head crowned with the White Radiance Great White Jade Essence, governing in the Pearl Radiance Chamber of the Jeweled Grove’s Upper Palace. He rides a flying phoenix of soaring auroras and a purple wheel, accompanied by thirty-six Jade Immortals of the Supreme Perfected.

Visualize the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings descending together into the Five Viscera within one’s body, transforming into red, white, and black qi, swirling in primordial chaos like clouds of mist, entering through the heart’s aperture to envelop the Five Internals. Then softly intone:

*"The Nine Elixirs coagulate the spirit; the Three Qi intertwine and bind. The Dark Perfected fill and descend—within and without, bright and fresh. The Great Granary opens and unblocks; intestines and stomach knot into immortality. Sever and extinguish the stem of knots, scatter and remove the old roots. Three harmonies form a covenant; the Nine Transformations coagulate the spirit. Return the essence to the Jade Womb to complete my body. Nine-colored Dark-Yellow, flowing essence irrigating the fluids—washing away accumulated obstructions, within, no dregs or dust remain. Floral branches contain the elegant; planting the numinous root. Aperture by aperture, luminous and bright; joint by joint, cool and clear. Bones transform, radiance takes flight—ascending to the Purple Heavens."*

Once complete, cease after swallowing nine breaths.

Next, visualize the Eight Radiant Spirits of the Central Region.

Close the eyes and visualize them thus:

The Spirit of the Throat is named Bai Liu Fang, styled Dao Tong. Eight inches in height, clad in a nine-colored patterned robe, head crowned with the Level Heaven Purple Dawn Diadem.

Visualize the Eight Radiant Spirits of the Central Region, each appearing as an infant, settled in their proper places, distinctly arrayed as if seen face-to-face.

Having completed this, strike the teeth eight times and, looking upward, intone:

The Eight Radiant Spirits of the Central Region,
Above transform through nine revolutions,
Transmuting essence into the Jade Womb,
Congealing qi within the Purple Tenuity,
Refining the hun and consolidating the po,
All spirits converge in unity.
The Thearch unties the knots,
The nine apertures disperse and open,
The Mysterious Mother descends with numen,
Joints receive the radiance,
Filled within and brimming without,
Resplendent light unwaning.
Attain union with the Eight Radiant Spirits,
Riding together in shared ascent.
The life mandate announces its inception,
As signs turn toward return.
Convey me upward in ascent,
To part and behold the numinous portal.

This done, swallow eight breaths and cease. Then ingest the talisman for refining the spirit within the fetal essence.

The talisman is inscribed in yellow on white paper, three sheets in total.

Facing the year of one’s current age, strike the teeth nine times and softly recite the incantation:

Mysterious qi congeals essence,
Yin transforms and Yang arises,
Nine revolutions transmute the radiant spirits,
Enabling ascent upon the flowing carriage.
Descend into the body of the adept,
Communing with the true and settling the numinous.
Untie each knot and scatter them,
Bonds dissolve and clarity emerges.
The nine apertures open wide,
All spirits universally pacified.
Riding the radiant spirits in flight,
Ascend into the Grand Clarity.

This done, ingest the talisman and swallow nine breaths to cease.

Beneath the womb region lie four knots:
The first knot resides within the bladder,
The second within the yin,
The third within the posterior aperture,
The fourth within the two feet.

When the adept wishes to untie the four knots of the lower region, on the day of their life mandate at the midnight hour when generative qi begins, enter the chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, paying homage to the Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, following the method of dawn and midday. Simply face the Grand Year Star, sit level, strike the teeth, and visualize with focused thought.

Visualize the Father and Mother descending,
Entering within the adept’s bladder,
Extending down to the two feet.
Envision the Father and Mother transforming into cyan and yellow qi,
Chaotic and radiant as the sun’s orb,
Illuminating the entire body,
Light shining within and without.
Looking upward, recite the incantation:

Yin and Yang intermingle in harmony,
The two qi thoroughly luminous.
Above transforms into the Mysterious Elixir,
Below revolves into Yellow Essence.
Containing the fetal transmutation,
The body assumes no fixed form.
The Thearch oversees and illumines,
The nine apertures receive the numinous.
The twelve regional knots,
Dissipate within the Yellow Court.
The Eight Radiant Spirits entwine,
Bone joints become purple jade.
The three hun are refined,
The seven po pacified.
All spirits treasured and settled,
Within and without in unison.
The three regions and Eight Radiant Spirits,
Together with me arise.
Convey me in flight,
Ascending to the Jade Clarity.

This done, swallow twenty-four breaths and cease.

Next, visualize the Brahma Treasure Heavenly King,
Surnamed Jing, personal name Wuyun (雨+十+梓),
Clad in a nine-colored flowing-cloud dawn-flying robe,
Head crowned with the Flowing Cinnabar Crimson Treasure Flaming Star Mysterious Essence.
He governs the Sevenfold Radiance Palace in the upper southern heavens,
Riding a carriage of flowing rosy clouds and jade canopies,
Attended by twelve Jade Immortals of the Upper Palace.

Next, visualize the Brahma Kapila Heavenly King,
Surnamed Xuan, personal name (雨+十+凝) Hong,
Clad in a nine-colored phoenix flying-cloud robe,
Head crowned with the Mysterious Dawn Morning Star Flowing Essence.
He governs the Purple Jade Terrace within the Nine Heavens Mysterious Phoenix City,
Riding a flying wheel of white unicorns and plain clouds,
Attended by thirty-two Immortal Lads of the Grand Florescence.

Next, visualize the Varitapāṇi Heavenly King,
Surnamed Wang, personal name Yin,
Clad in a nine-colored seamless mysterious-cloud treasure robe,
Head crowned with the Limitless Flowing Yellow Quelling Star Flying Essence.
He governs the Ninefold Chambers of the Great Wondrous Palace within the Jade Capital Peak of the Heavens,
Riding a five-colored cloud carriage,
Attended by twelve Jade Lads of the Grand Mystery.

Visualize the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings descending together into the adept’s body,
Residing within the bladder and extending down to the two feet,
Transforming into purple, green, and azure qi,
Chaotic as clouds and mist,
Entering through the yin,
Flowing and spreading within the bladder, posterior aperture, and two feet,
Illuminating within and without.
Then softly recite the incantation:

The Three Heavens nurture the fetus,
Nine qi congeal the spirit.
Above transforms into the Mysterious Elixir,
Below revolves and transmutes.
The two images descend and intermingle,
Thus completing this body.
The six stomachs flourish like jade,
The nine palaces receive the true.
The twelve knots and joints,
Each severs its root.
Foul qi is swept away,
The five numina unfurl.
The Mysterious Elixir emits essence,
Refining and transmuting into radiant splendor.
Golden Immortals wing the numinous,
Jade Florescence composes the chapter.
Names recorded in the Azure Chamber,
Eternally safeguarding the Thearch’s dawn.

This done, swallow nine breaths while looking upward and cease.

Next, visualize the Eight Radiant Spirit Lads of the Lower Region.

With eyes closed, visualize them thus:

The Spirit of the Stomach is named Tonglai Yu, styled Dao Zhan.
Seven inches in height, clad in a yellow brocade flying skirt, head crowned with the Level Heaven Purple Dawn Diadem.

The Spirit within the Exhausted Intestine is named Zhao Teng Kang, styled Dao Huan.

The Spirit within the Right Yin is named Bao Biao Ming, styled Dao Sheng.
Two inches and three fen in height, clad in a cyan-yellow-white three-colored skirt, head crowned with the Three-Ridge Diadem.

Having visualized all Eight Radiant Spirits,
Each appearing as an infant,
Settled in their proper places,
A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders
Densely arrayed within the adept’s yin, bladder, posterior aperture, and two flanks.

Then strike the teeth eight times and, looking upward, recite the incantation:

The Eight Radiant Spirits of the Lower Region,
Dispersing form and transforming spirit,
Containing the primordial and nurturing qi,
Refining the fetal purple mist.
The Supreme Unity Primordial Father,
The Mysterious Mother entwined,
The two essences flow and irrigate,
Nurturing the inner true.
The Thearch establishes the register,
The Director of Destinies alters the years.
The knots of the joints have scattered,
The nine apertures are now resplendent.
Hun and po securely preserved,
All spirits universally gathered.
Ascend together with me,
Together attaining the Jade Dawn.

Looking upward, swallow the saliva eight times and stop.

Next, visualize the inner spirit of the Dao-One, named Dunwuma, styled Daojisheng. His form is two inches and two fen in height, clad in a purple robe of luminous brocade, wearing the Wuji Jinxian crown. He resides within your cinnabar field below the navel, governing the Three Regions and the Twenty-Four Spirits. Once the visualization is complete, strike the teeth thirty-two times and softly recite the incantation:

Great Spirit of the Mysterious Above,
Encompassing all without exception,
Pacifying and guarding the hidden valley,
Flowing essence beneath the purple canopy.
All Perfected attend in spirit,
The Three Regions mutually defend.
The Thearch illumines the seat,
The Mysterious Mother rejoices in peace.
The Nine Origins align as one,
The Director of Destinies extends the years.
The Three Dawns shine together,
Bound to the Perfected with the sash.

Afterward, looking upward, swallow the twenty-four qi and stop. Then ingest the inner talisman of the Three Passes and Twelve Embryonic Knots.

The talisman is inscribed in vermilion on bamboo membrane—three pieces. Once the visualization is complete, face the Year-Star and ingest them. Softly recite the incantation:

This is but a talismanic seal,
Not a commanded talisman or spell.
The four knots of the Upper Region
Secure the mud-pill palace of man,
Bathe the radiant countenance in splendor,
Heavenly beings flourish like fern.
The four knots of the Middle Region
Gather ill omens into throngs,
Ensnare and bind the Great Granary,
Hasten the wandering hun-soul,
Lure demons to conspire,
Scatter dreams and disrupt focus.
The four knots of the Lower Region
Bind the posterior gate of man,
Obstruct the nine apertures,
Sever the root of life.
The Thearch proclaims the numinous,
The Jade Script of the Nine Heavens,
Dissolves the knotted nodes,
Eradicates all roots of affliction.
The Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother
Nurture and nourish the Three Passes.
The Eight Radiant Spirits stand guard,
True qi disperses and divides.
Above, azure; below, yellow;
Without, square; within, round.
Exterior and interior alike purified,
Descending to the Three Origins,
One attains to ride the Eight Radiant Spirits,
Soaring through clouds and streaming mist,
Ascending empty space and mounting the void,
To ascend and reach the Golden Gate.

Afterward, looking upward, swallow the twelve qi, and swallow the saliva twenty-four times to conclude.

In the fourth month, one must receive the qi of the Heaven of Extended Longevity. On the seventh day at dawn, the seventeenth day at noon, and the twenty-seventh day at midnight—three days and three times within the month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, burn incense, bow nine times to the northwest toward the Primordial Father, and three times to the southeast toward the Mysterious Mother. Then, facing the established month, sit upright, strike the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize summoning the Heavenly King of Extended Longevity, surnamed Zi, named Luoluo. He wears a robe of nine-colored, tripled cloud-patterned brocade and the Heavenly Origin Treasure Crown. He governs the Jade Capital Spirit Metropolis Palace in Heaven, riding the Nine Numinous Flying Swans and the Threefold Plain Clouds, accompanied by twenty-four Jade Maidens of the Plain Spirit. Descend and enter your Yellow Court Palace. Visualize a cloud of yellow qi, dense and swirling, encircling your form. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into your mouth and swallow it nine times. Softly recite the incantation:

The three hun are now at peace,
The seven po are now at rest.
Heaven arrays the Five Lodges,
The body aligns with the Seven Stars.
Ten thousand spirits attend in formation,
The Mysterious Perfected exhale the numinous.
Jade mushrooms flow and pour,
Thoroughly irrigating the five forms.
Internally replete, externally overflowing,
The hidden passes become bright and clear.
Return to refine the marrow,
Reverse white to azure.
Roam at will through transformations,
Exit darkness and enter obscurity,
Ride the void and fly through space,
Ascend to reach the Moon Court.

Afterward, swallow the qi nine times and stop. Be diligent, be diligent.

The talisman is inscribed in azure on bamboo membrane. Face your life-star and ingest three pieces at three times, to penetrate the intestines, refine the marrow, transform the bones, and congeal the spirit. After three years, one will ascend in flight, and flesh and bones alike will attain transcendence.

Recite the talisman incantation:

Heaven crimsons, Earth ascends,
The two qi descend in mutual exchange.
The Nine Yangs transform,
Congealing essence within the chamber.
The Eight Radiant Spirits disperse the numinous,
The Six Palaces flourish within.
Ten thousand spirits are all purified,
Eternally enjoying the Great Yang,
To the end of heaven and earth,
Everlasting joy without end.

After ingesting the talisman, swallow the qi nine times to conclude.

Here ends the *Upper Clarity Scripture on Embryonic Essence: The Method for Dissolving Knots*.
