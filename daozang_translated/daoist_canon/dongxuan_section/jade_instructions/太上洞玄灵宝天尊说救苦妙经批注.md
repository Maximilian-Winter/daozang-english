**Explication of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy’s Wondrous Scripture of Salvation from Suffering**
Annotated by Dongyangzi of Daoshen Hermitage

**The Supreme (Taishang):**
*Tai* (Supreme) denotes utmost greatness; *shang* (above) signifies the most exalted. As it originates beyond the *Taiyi* (Supreme Beginning) and *Taiyi* (Supreme Simplicity), it is called *Taishang* (The Supreme).

Now, the *Taiyi* (Supreme Simplicity) is the state before *qi* manifests—the primordial *qi* of the Origin’s inception, yet unseen. The *Taiyi* transforms into the *Taichu* (Supreme Beginning), where *qi* first arises, and the precelestial primordial *qi* begins to reveal faint traces. The *Taichu* transforms into the *Taishi* (Supreme Commencement), where form first emerges, and the primordial *qi* gradually takes shape. The *Taishi* transforms into the *Taisu* (Supreme Simplicity), where substance first appears, and the primordial *qi* attains both form and essence. The *Taisu* transforms into the *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate), which is the undifferentiated chaos—vast and boundless, resembling an egg. Within it lies essence, pervading without limit, as the primordial *qi* congeals yet remains undivided into purity and turbidity.

When the *Taiji* transforms, chaos unfolds, and the primordial vastness splits. Thus, the pure yang *qi* ascends to become Heaven, while the turbid yin *qi* descends to become Earth. As the *Yijing* states: *"The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes"*—this is the principle. The Two Modes generate the Three Powers, which are neither turbid nor pure but the harmonious *qi* that coalesces to form humanity. This is called: *"The Dao gives birth to the One"*—the undifferentiated *qi* of chaos; *"The One generates the Two"*—the purity and turbidity of the Two Modes; *"The Two generate the Three"*—the Three Powers of humanity. Thereafter, the Three give rise to the myriad things.

The myriad things originate from Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth cannot exist of themselves—they are possessed by the *Taiji*. The *Taiji* cannot generate itself—it is born of the *Taisu*. The *Taisu* cannot nurture itself—it is nurtured by the *Taishi*. The *Taishi* cannot conceive itself—it is conceived by the *Taichu*. Before the *Taichu* exists, there is the *Taiyi*. Thus, the *Taishang* refers to that which originates beyond the *Taichu* and *Taiyi*—the greatness beyond all greatness, hence *tai* (supreme), and the height beyond the eight poles, hence *shang* (above).

Moreover, *tai* means "utmost," and *shang* means "lofty," signifying that the wondrous meaning of this scripture is so exalted that nothing surpasses it. In ancient times, the sages crafted the character *tai* (太) from *ren* (人, person), *yi* (一, one), and a dot, for when a person attains the One, they are called great. The great person, standing alone and upright, ever preserving this single point, may embody the entirety of the *Taishang*.

This single point spans past and present, neither arising nor ceasing. In the Dao, it is called the *yuanshen* (primordial spirit); in Confucianism, the *zhenxing* (true nature); in Buddhism, the *benlai* (original face). In the eye, it enables sight; in the ear, hearing; in the nose, smell; in the tongue, taste; in the hand, grasping; in the foot, walking. From speech to silence, movement to stillness, through myriad transformations, it never fails to communicate its numinosity through this single point.

Thus, Lord Lao’s refinement and nurturance concern only this point; Zhuang Zhou’s parables speak only of this point; the Duke of Zhou’s contemplation ponders only this point; Confucius’s profound absorption delves only into this point; the Tathāgata’s great awakening awakens only to this point; the ancestral masters’ transmission passes down only this point.

The common folk use it daily yet remain unaware. Externally, they are swayed by sounds and sights; internally, they are drowned by cravings and desires. By day, they follow passions and affections; by night, they chase dreams in flight. Their thoughts cling and grasp, never ceasing for even a moment. When this single point is not aligned, the heart’s reflection remains askew. Seduced by emotions and desires, it strays outward—thus forming the character *da* (大, "great"), signifying the wandering and turning of the wheel, or even rebirth as beasts.

Now, the character *shang* (上, "above") is composed of *bu* (卜) and *yi* (一). *Bu* means "to divine" or "to measure"; *yi* is "nature." To divine and measure one’s own nature, and to dwell humbly below—this is to be an *upper scholar* (上士). The rivers and seas, by lowering themselves beneath the hundred valleys, become their king; a small state, by humbling itself before a great one, wins its allegiance. This is why Confucius deferred to the fisherman.

Yet if one’s humility is not refined, one cannot grasp its truth. Though a well be a thousand fathoms deep, drawing water from its surface yields nothing. Thus, the sage does not descend without ascending. Hence it is said: "Nobility takes lowliness as its root; height takes lowness as its foundation." Know then that one who never seeks to precede others yet always follows them, who places the self last yet finds the self foremost—such a one is revered in humility and radiant in light. This is the Way of the *zhenren* (true person) in responding to the world.

Thus it is said: "Divine and measure your nature to dwell below, and you become an upper scholar." The principle is luminously clear. But if one is self-aggrandizing, self-promoting, self-righteous, and self-displaying, delighting in standing above others—such a one is truly a *lower person* (下人).

As for one who embodies the Great Void, vast and egoless—where this single point is concerned, both inner and outer are forgotten, above and below are transcended. This is the Way of the utmost sage, wherein one attains the Three Clarities on one’s own. Why gaze upward in longing? One’s own Supreme Purity is already present—why seek it externally?

*Dongxuan* (洞玄): *Dong* means "to penetrate." Above, it connects to Heaven; below, to Earth; within, immortals and spirits traverse in hidden communion. The world has ten great *dong* (caverns) and thirty-six lesser ones, all residing within the boundless expanse of the Great Void. Each is interconnected, penetrating one another. Only when immortals and sages gather do they take form; when they disperse, they become qi, naturally traversing the void without obstruction.

Thus, the sage draws lessons from afar in things and from nearness in the self. Within the human body, too, there are *dong*. The head has nine palaces, above which lies the *Liaotian* (寥天), together forming the ten great *dongtian* (cavern-heavens). The spinal column has twenty-four joints, forming the twelve-storied tower. Together, these make thirty-six *dong*, ascending to the nine heavens of *Nijiu* (泥九) and descending to the nine earths of *Weixian* (尾闲). Within, the true qi traverses in hidden communion.

Thus, in the midst of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, the sage turns the *xuanji* (璇玑, celestial pivot), spiritually penetrating the qi’s caverns, communing above with Heaven. This is what is meant by the three palaces ascending and descending, the endless coming and going. Moreover, the character *dong* (洞) is composed of *shui* (水, "water") and *tong* (同, "same")—meaning the cavern is one with water.

The vast sea’s waters gather the flows of the eight directions and nine wilds, the celestial rivers. Scoop from it, and it is never exhausted; pour into it, and it is never full. Boundless and immeasurable, its depths cannot be fathomed. Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao all proceed from the coarse to the fine, from the fine to the subtle. When subtlety reaches its limit, it attains the wondrous; when the wondrous reaches its limit, it attains the mysterious. When the Dao is mysterious, there is nothing it does not penetrate.

Thus, *dong* signifies its profound depth, unfathomable; *xuan* (玄, "mysterious") signifies its subtlety, inexhaustible. These teachings are arcane and far-reaching, deep as the *Dongxuan*. Without innate excellence from the Jade Void, who could penetrate them?

*The Marvelous Scripture of Salvation Spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*

The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy is the Supreme Dao Lord. In terms of the body: *ling* (灵, "numinous") is spirit; *bao* (宝, "treasure") is qi; form is the dwelling of the numinous treasure.

Humans have ears and eyes, the gates of the primordial spirit. By day, when the heart is awake, the spirit roams through the ears; by night, when the eyes sleep, the spirit returns to the Crimson Palace. The common folk direct their seeing and hearing outward, so the spirit wanders externally. Encountering sights and sounds, it is stirred within. The spirit’s nature transforms into emotion; emotion is entangled, giving rise to thoughts. By day, there are thoughts; by night, dreams—endlessly chasing, scattering in pursuit of boundless desires. The hundred spirits grow weary and dissipate; the dwelling, bereft of treasure, collapses. This is all due to using the spirit externally rather than guarding it within.

As for the *zhenren* (perfected person), all dharmas are forgotten, and only the spirit is guarded. The eyes turn inward, and the spirit’s light illumines the Jade Tower; the ears reverse their hearing, and the wondrous tones resound in the Jasper Chamber. The spirit’s abode is profoundly settled, not a single thought arises. Wisdom and tranquility nurture one another; over time, the Dao becomes numinous. Above, it reaches Heaven; below, it coils upon Earth. The six penetrations and four openings manifest boundless wondrous function. Creation cannot alter it; yin and yang cannot fathom it. Thus, one can ride the light and mount the whirlwind, ascend to truth and merge with the Dao—all through the spirit’s nature. How can this not be called *ling* (numinous)?

Humans have nose and mouth, the gates through which the treasure of life enters and exits. With every breath, they commune with Heaven and Earth, the comings and goings of primordial qi. With each exhalation, valley qi departs; with each inhalation, primordial qi enters. The mechanism of immortality and the essence of longevity lie hidden here.

The common folk’s hearts and spirits stray outward; their emotions are restless, their qi hurried. Their breath is confined to the throat, the fetal origin scatters, true qi withers, and when qi is exhausted, life ends. How lamentable!

Only the *zhenren* profoundly comprehends the source of creation, breathing the qi of Great Harmony. They seize the root and return to the origin, reverting to the mandate and restoring life. Their breath reaches the heels. There is no treasure greater than qi. Those who grasp this principle know that the Mud Pill Palace and Jade Tower are where the spirit dwells, while the Mysterious Gate and Female Portal are where qi is gathered. Qi governs the spirit; the spirit commands qi. Mother and child guard one another; nature and life merge. Then the myriad spirits do not scatter, and one becomes *ling* (numinous). When a single qi congeals, it forms the treasure—this is the numinous treasure of the body.

The suffering of sentient beings is none greater than the cycle of rebirth and death. The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, expounded the profound and wondrous teachings, opening the gate of stagnation and pointing the way of radiant light. Those who awaken through these teachings escape birth and death, forever freed from the wheel of rebirth—hence it is called "deliverance from suffering."

The *jing* (scripture) is the path, the constant. It is meant for those who pursue the higher learning to follow this path and practice it unceasingly. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Deliverance from Suffering—the Heavenly Worthy is none other than primordial qi. The Dharma-body is formless; accumulated qi becomes the true. It is the most revered in heaven. When gathered, it takes form; when dispersed, it returns to qi. Pervading the ten directions, primordial qi is vast enough to encompass all, subtle enough to penetrate all. In valleys, it fills valleys; in pits, it fills pits. It suffuses the eight extremities, present wherever one turns—hence it is said to pervade the ten directions.

Ever through its numinous power, it delivers and uplifts all sentient beings. No power is greater than primordial qi, for its movement alone holds the authority of creation. Sentient beings—whether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation; whether flowers, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, fish, or turtles; whether crawling, flying, or wriggling; whether endowed with consciousness or not—all are nurtured and brought to life by primordial qi. Where primordial qi abides, the soft and weak flourish and grow; where it departs, the hard and strong wither and die. Laozi said: "The soft and weak belong to the realm of life; the hard and strong belong to the realm of death." All things possessing form, sound, or appearance are but phenomena, and all arise only after receiving primordial qi—hence it is said to deliver all sentient beings from suffering, guiding them to depart from the path of delusion.

Sentient beings, unaware and unenlightened, are like the blind beholding the sun and moon. They cling to sensory pleasures and desires, lost in the labyrinth of delusion, unaware that fish dwell in water while water dwells in fish, and humans dwell in qi while qi dwells in humans. Fish perish when parted from water; humans die when parted from qi. A fish large enough to swallow a boat, once stranded on dry land, may be tormented by ants—thus it is said that fish cannot leave the depths, nor humans depart from qi. If fish can inhale and exhale to transform water, they do not die; if humans can inhale and exhale to transform qi, they attain longevity.

The world knows only to consume grains, meats, fruits, and vegetables to sustain life, yet does not realize that these are but forms of slain beings. All that possesses form belongs to yin, being the essence of earth, while only primordial qi belongs to yang. With each exhalation, qi extends three inches; with each inhalation, qi retreats three inches. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. In a day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, and true qi traverses eight hundred ten *zhang* in ascent and descent through the nostrils and mouth. The common person cannot grasp this, and all qi scatters into emptiness. If a single breath does not return, life ends abruptly.

This scripture contains the secret of nurturing qi and preserving spirit to attain immortality, yet the foolish of the world fail to grasp its essence, like the blind who, though the sun and moon shine with great brilliance, cannot see them—hence it is said they are like the blind beholding the sun and moon.

I originate from the Great Nothingness, lifting the tassel beyond all bounds. Primordial qi resides in the vast emptiness of the Great Void, like a bellows ever expanding and contracting. Because it is nothing, it can enter the unbroken; thus it is said to be formless yet possessing essence. To lose it is death; to obtain it is life. From ancient times to the present, those who attained the Dao and ascended as immortals are beyond count, all having mastered the use of primordial qi to become true—hence it is said to lift the tassel beyond all bounds.

Auspicious clouds open the Gate of Life; propitious mists seal the Portal of Death. Herein lies the eye of this scripture and the pivot of deliverance from suffering. Auspicious clouds and propitious mists are alternate names for the wondrous qi of Great Harmony. The Gate of Life and Portal of Death are designations for the Mysterious Gate and Female Portal. Some call them the Gate of Heaven and Earth, or the Portals of Qian and Kun. Wherever gates and portals are mentioned, there must be something that enters and exits through them.

To open is to part; to close is to seal. The *Book of Changes* says: "Closing the portal is called Kun; opening the portal is called Qian." One closing and one opening make a transformation; ceaseless coming and going is called the Dao. That by which heaven and earth endure long and unceasing is this very principle. Those who wish to attain longevity and eternal vision, to equal heaven and earth in years, must within the Gate of Life and Portal of Death thoroughly investigate the origins of passage and obstruction, and fathom the wonders of creation. They must ensure the ceaseless circulation of the yin and yang qi of heaven and earth in ascent and descent—this is called "exiting the sun and entering the moon," or "exiting the pure and entering the mysterious."

Without encountering the guidance of a perfected one, even the most learned cannot hear of this, for its nature requires personal awakening, and its destiny depends on transmission by a teacher. I, having formerly received my master’s profound instructions, now dare to reveal the unspoken true mechanism of the Most High and display the sacred secret. Scholars should study it diligently. The secret states:

The Gate of Life and Portal of Death—under a thousand names they vary,
One called the Crimson Abyss, another the Spirit Hut.
The lesser adept does not comprehend—nose inhales, mouth exhales,
Yet the key to immortality lies in this, unmatched by all things.
Auspicious clouds and propitious mists—now ascending, now descending,
Opening and filling, obstructing and sealing—cloud essence and purple marrow.
Gather the white blossoms—soaring scenes in empty space,
Qi enters the body—its savor surpasses ghee.
Like the tortoise drawing breath—communing with the numinous, never dying,
Like the clam absorbing moonlight—nurturing and congealing the pearl.
The celestial mechanism is now revealed—those who encounter it must keep it secret.
When merit is complete, one ascends lightly, riding the jade chariot.

First, the Primordial Origin arises, communicating with the auspicious and responsive mechanism. The Great Dao first emerges from a single qi. This single qi initially becomes the Three Qi of the Primordial Origin—hence it is said, "First, the Primordial Origin arises." The Three Qi coalesce to form the Three Pure Ones. The three colors intermingle in chaos, illuminating the vast emptiness. Each of the Three Qi then generates three luminosities, and three times three make nine, forming the Nine Heavens.

The *Chapter on Generating Spirit* states: "One must extend and unite the Three Spirits, as the qi of the Primordial Origin divides." The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: "The Three Qi revolve to the right, and the nine paths shine clearly," and also: "The Nine Qi radiate brilliance, emerging between the heavens." Thus, the Three Qi are the lords of heaven and earth, and the Nine Qi are the roots of the myriad things.

One who can refine and explore the Three Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin, penetrating the auspicious mists and felicitous clouds, is said to grasp the pivot of creation—hence it is called "to penetrate the auspicious and respond to the mechanism." This saves all sins and delivers all calamities.

Vast and boundless, one transcends the immortal source; vast and unobstructed, one attains natural purity. All this is borne of the power of the Great Dao, subduing all demonic essences.

Of all sins, none is greater than the sin of death; of all calamities, none is greater than the calamity of death. Though human deaths may differ in ten thousand ways, they all converge into three paths. The death of the sage is called *spirit*; the death of the worthy is called *return*; the death of the common person is called *thing*.

What is meant by the sage’s death being called *spirit*? The sage nurtures the sacred embryo within the chamber of spirit, giving birth to a body within the body. The yang spirit sheds its form, dying yet not perishing, transcending the embryo to become spirit—this is called an immortal.

What is meant by the worthy’s death being called *return*? The worthy, while in the world, does not engage with things, their nature unattached. They regard life as a temporary abode and death as a return—*return* meaning *reversion*. Spirit and essence enter their gate, bones and skeletal frame return to their root. What remains of the self? They empty all that is possessed, and their numinous awareness, luminous and transcendent, emerges beyond things. Unbound by cyclic rebirth, unrestrained by the officials of the shades, they abide in serene freedom—even the joy of a king facing south cannot compare. Those who illuminate the mind and realize the nature—worthy ones, noble persons, and those of the Chan lineage—attain and verify the true and constant, forever free from entanglements. Yet if their insight remains unclear or their cultivation incomplete, if they cling to empty discourse or stagnate in visualization, they may ultimately be called *yin spirits*, *suffering souls*, or *ghostly immortals*. Should they seek liberation, they may seize a new vessel or enter a womb.

What is meant by the common person’s death being called *thing*? The common person, while in the world, is ever entangled in dreams, thoughts, and attachments, constantly engaging with things, unable to transcend them. Thus, when their life is about to end, form and spirit cannot part—like a live turtle shedding its shell or a crab plunged into boiling water, their agony is manifold. After death, their realm is darkness, like a bird flying at midnight, bewildered and recklessly alighting, unaware of where they are bound. They are molded by the Creator, reborn according to their karmic consciousness, or transformed into other species without self-awareness. For the heart’s transformations are inescapable—just as the fiercest become tigers, the most lustful become women, or others become beasts, livestock, birds, or insects. Even if they regain human form, they are still called *things*. Thus, it is said the common person’s death is called *thing*.

If, at the moment of death, all parts of the body grow cold yet the crown of the head remains warm, this person has attained the Dao and directly ascends to the pure realm. If all parts grow cold yet the heart remains warm, they may regain a human body.

Those who do not aspire to cultivate the Dao, who rush about in anxiety, chasing profit and fame, mired in sensual pleasures, day after day—are like oxen and sheep led to the slaughterhouse, each step bringing them nearer to death. Before death comes, should one not swiftly seek the supreme Dao, diligently practice it, perfect the true and deliver the world, and strive to escape the sins and calamities of life and death? Hence it is said: *This saves all sins and delivers all calamities.*

When the Dao is perfected, one’s name is inscribed in the golden register, and one’s rank is listed among the immortal ministers. Jade maidens wield banners, immortal youths beat time, and one roams freely in the Upper Clarity. In the highest and most distant realms of the Great Veil, amidst the qi of the myriad heavens, vast and unobstructed, one attains ultimate purity. Thus it is said: *Vast and boundless, one transcends the immortal source; vast and unobstructed, one attains natural purity.*

Wearing the talisman, a thousand demons lose their courage; casting flowing gold, ten thousand spirits are destroyed in form. Thus it is said: *All this is borne of the power of the Great Dao, subduing all demonic essences.*

What is that radiance in the void? It is called the Immortal of the Muddy Pellet. Emptiness encompasses the myriad dharmas, yet wondrous function resides within—hence it is called *in the void*. The inner landscape shines brilliantly, and in returning vision, one sees it alone—thus it is said: *What radiance!* The Muddy Pellet lies three inches directly inward between the brows. It is the chamber of brain blood, the jade chamber of the soul’s essence, the life-dwelling of the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids. It is also called the *Uppermost Red Child*, the supreme spirit of the bodily form—hence it is called the *Immortal of the Muddy Pellet*.

Purple clouds cover the Yellow and the Old. When the qi of Metal and Wood intermingle, green and white merge to form azure mist; when the qi of Water and Fire harmonize in mutual completion, black and red transform into purple clouds. To refine one’s form and substance, nothing precedes true Water and true Fire. True Water is not the turbid water of saliva, fluids, or grain qi—it is the mysterious spring found within the wondrous qi of Great Harmony, the true Water of the One. One must discern the clarity or turbidity of its source.

Fire has no form; it arises from things. Without method, its calamity will surely strike. The fires of the immortals’ practice vary in degree. When employed, they extinguish the corpse and refine the po, transforming the body into pure yang. There are talismanic numbers and correspondences, the cycles of the celestial stems and branches, the revolutions of the sun and moon—all transmitted mouth-to-mouth, difficult to inscribe on bamboo or silk. The immortals have said: *"The secrets of the immortals are easy to conceal but hard to transmit; the sages pass on the medicine but not the fire."*

If one practices Water but not Fire, qi cannot ascend; if one practices Fire but not Water, it cannot steam and pervade. Only when Water and Fire are mutually completed does the misty qi transform into purple clouds. Where spirit gathers, qi must attend—thus, purple clouds, lush and verdant, ascend to the Muddy Pellet, covering the Central Yellow and Old Lord. Thus it is said: *Purple clouds cover the Yellow and the Old.*

This is called the *Lord of the Three Treasures*. The Lord of the Three Treasures arises from the congealing and transformation of spirit, qi, and essence. Spirit has yin and yang; qi has purity and turbidity; essence has inversion and compliance.

What is meant by spirit having yin and yang? If one relies on visualization and contemplation to achieve numinous communication, able to enter and exit the heavenly gates and foresee the unseen, this is called *yin spirit*. But if one accumulates the qi of yin and yang, coalescing them to form an auspicious body—a body born within the body, an immortal embryo that sheds its husk—this is called *yang spirit*.

The yang spirit becomes an immortal, while the yin spirit becomes a ghost.

What is meant by qi having purity and turbidity? Heaven possesses form and substance; those containing blood and qi—such as grains, meats, fruits, and vegetables—grow by nourishing earthly roots. The character for *qi* (炁) is composed of *wu* (旡) and *fire* (火), signifying *grain qi*, also called *earthly qi*, hence it is called turbid. The wondrous qi of Great Harmony generates heaven and earth, spirits and gods, emperors and lords. Forcibly named as the Dao, it is qi; qi is the Dao. Invisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear, intangible to the touch—formless yet possessing form, imageless yet embodying image—it penetrates metal and stone, fills the eight wilds. The character for *qi* (炁) is composed of *wu* (旡) and *fire* (火), and fire is yang. Thus, it is the pure yang qi within the void and nonexistence.

Accumulating yin qi leads to death; ingesting yang qi leads to life.

What is meant by essence having inversion and compliance? Compliance gives rise to human form; inversion becomes the *Mother of the Elixir*. All these depend on the firing process, which involves ascent and descent. The union of husband and wife is called *kalpa fire*, which also passes through the Three Passes and penetrates the *Weilü*. Thus, following the natural course results in human birth. But if one contracts the *Golden Turtle*, this is called *civil fire*; closing the breath and circulating it is called *martial fire*; harmonizing with the sun and moon is called *tally fire*. Therefore, immortals and Daoists open the *Golden Lock*, pierce the *Jade Gate*, revolve the *Xuanji*, turn the sun and moon, allowing golden essence to penetrate the crown and silver waves to surge to heaven—this is called *counterflow*, hence it is said: *inversion becomes the Mother of the Elixir*. Compliance leads to bodily decay; inversion strengthens the bones.

The eyes are the gates of spirit; the nose and mouth are the doors of qi; the *Weilü* is the path of essence. The subtle and wondrous workings of the celestial and true sagely arts are all concealed within these. Thus, the perfected person inwardly gazes and reverses hearing to concentrate the spirit, inhales and exhales the Great Harmony to absorb its qi, and reverses the flow of the *Pearl Stream* to gather essence. The Three Treasures congeal and accumulate within the *Chamber of Spirit*, all transforming into spirit. Hence, it is called the *Lord of the Three Treasures*.

Returning with the black of the upper heavens to restrain the nine heavens’ souls. The human head contains the *Nine Heavens*, also called the *Celestial Valley*, where the soul-spirit resides in the *Yellow Court*—what is meant by *above lies the soul-spirit, below the Pass of Origin*. The body delights in flavors; the spirit delights in qi. Heavenly qi is the sustenance of the yang spirit. The *Chapter on Generating Spirit* states: *The soul is born, roaming qi, drifting to refine the pristine essence.* Truly, the roaming qi is the heavenly qi of the upper heavens, which the soul-spirit seizes, for it delights in consuming qi. Thus, the qi of the upper heavens restrains the nine heavens’ souls. If the spirit does not obtain this single qi to restrain it, it cannot become numinous; if the valley does not obtain this single qi to fill it, it cannot become full. Without numinosity, the spirit will fear dissipation and depart from the body; without fullness, the valley will fear exhaustion and the *Celestial Valley* will become empty. Once the *Valley Spirit* departs, human life ends.

In the past, before encountering the primordial qi, it drifted away in boundless emptiness. Now, having awakened to the truth, it departs but has a place to return. Thus, it is called the *Great Return*. Returning with the qi of the upper heavens to restrain the nine heavens’ soul-spirits, only then does the *Valley Spirit* not die. Hence, it is said: *The spirit obtains the One and becomes numinous; the valley obtains the One and becomes full.*

The wondrous spirits of salvation see the time of deliverance. In the heavens above, all is undivided. Those who cultivate the supreme Dao must preserve their spirit whole. The spirit-whole person shines without dazzling, veiled to nurture correctness, thus able to return to the Great Uncarved Block, embrace emptiness and tranquility, merge into oneness, and stand alone. Their nature roams the boundless, utterly still realm, without the slightest stirring of knowledge—thus their spirit does not depart. Without the faintest arising of thought—thus their spirit does not scatter.

Master Meng said: *Preserving one’s heaven whole, the spirit does not retreat.* Guarding one’s heaven, the spirit’s radiance lingers, giving birth to the myriad spirits. Hence, they are called the *wondrous spirits*. As for deliverance from suffering, one must first deliver oneself. If suffering does not deliver itself, who can deliver it? When my Dao nears completion, even the great floods reaching the heavens cannot drown me; the great drought scorching mountains cannot burn me. Life and death hold no change for me—how much less the deaths of great cycles and kalpas? Beyond calamity and adversity, thus it is said: *they see the time of deliverance.*

This is the Dao of the *Returning Wind* merging with the *Emperor’s Unity*—unifying the hundred spirits within one’s own heaven, indivisible. Hence, it is said: *In the heavens above, all is undivided.*

The heavenly qi returns to the one body, all becoming *natural persons*. The heavenly qi arises before the *Great Simplicity*, transcending the myriad forms. It emerges and enters in clarity and brightness, abides in the divine mechanism to roll and unfold, purifying the azure of the high heavens, lightening the red of the setting sun. Unaffected by wind and rain, unstained by dust, it breathes through the *Mysterious Female’s Gate*, washes in the realm of the *Inaudible and Invisible*. It relieves hunger and thirst, removes filth and impurities, expels the *Three Corpses*, and dissolves the hundred diseases—this is the qi of the clear void and the possessed Dao.

The *Secret Formula of the Jade Emperor’s Divine Workings* states: *Those who know the supreme Dao are not killed by heaven; those who ingest primordial qi are not destroyed by earth.* Understanding the principles of exhalation and inhalation, one can daily absorb the sun’s radiance and essence, the moon’s brilliance and bloom, the *Three Primes*, the *Five Sprouts*, and the *Primordial Emperor’s Upright Qi*—all these are heavenly qi. When the Great Harmony enters the body, bones and flesh become light and clear, a round image appears at the nape, and concealment and manifestation occur naturally. Only then can one become a *natural person*. Hence, it is said: *The heavenly qi returns to the one body, all becoming natural persons.*

If it arises from unclean places, affected by dryness and dampness, mixed with foul and putrid food and drink, or tainted by the vapors of tombs and graveyards, this is the turbid, foul, stagnant *dead qi*—shunned by the Dao of immortals. Thus, immortals often dwell in lofty towers to be nearer to heavenly qi. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *Most taboo is the dead qi and all foul impurities.*

The natural has a distinct body, originally within the empty and cavernous. The empty and cavernous leave no trace, yet the entire body is void. Laozi said: *Heaven follows the Dao; the Dao follows the natural.*

The Dao of Heaven models itself upon the *natural person*—how could one not embody this? The body without form is originally the unblemished infant, self-rooted and self-originating, existing thus since ancient times. Laozi said: *Profound and still, it seems to endure—unknown whose child it is, appearing before the Lord of Heaven.* This is what is called the *distinct body*. Moreover, the brain palace is round and void, perfectly attuned to the real; thus the Lord of Heaven resides there, and the *Mud Pill* becomes the mansion of the empty and cavernous. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *Ask whose child dwells within my body, where has this one gone to enter the Mud Pill?* This speaks precisely of this.

Therefore, guarding the spirit means restraining the restless heart. If one guards the spirit without loss, becoming one with it, one forgets even the traces of what is guarded—hence it is said: *The empty and cavernous leave no trace, yet the entire body is void.* When the essence of oneness penetrates, one transcends the realm of the ten thousand images. The spirit roams the boundless expanse of true emptiness, and the entire body becomes vast and void.

First, the *commissioned qi* takes its place.
Second, the *qi of compliance* arises.
Third, the ten thousand laws are completed.
Fourth, one presides over light and illumination.

Liezi said: *Life is not my possession; it is the commission of harmony from Heaven and Earth.* Examining its origin, the body was originally non-existent; it stands only through the commission of the two *qi* of Heaven and Earth as parents—hence it is said: *First, the commissioned qi takes its place.* Knowing this body is born of *qi*, one should not violently oppose it, causing its premature obstruction. One must urgently return the heavenly *qi* to the body, making it continuous and unbroken. Embryonic breathing returns to the root, and *qi* is received in compliance—naturally, one attains longevity. Hence it is said: *Second, the qi of compliance arises.*

The *perfected person* lifts and carries Heaven and Earth, grasps and wields yin and yang. The cosmos lies within their hands, and the ten thousand transformations arise within their body. They can transform form into *qi*, thus becoming inexhaustible. Without transformation, one becomes spirit; the spirit’s inexhaustibility lies in its merging with the Dao. The Dao merges with the natural. Following the law to enter the Dao, the law is easily attained; following the Dao to enter the law, the law is easily accomplished. If one law is grasped, then all laws are mastered—hence it is said: *Third, the ten thousand laws are completed.* When the Dao is accomplished, one’s crown bears the round image, and the body radiates light—hence it is said: *Fourth, one presides over light and illumination.*

The *Essentials of the Five Classics* further states: *The Wondrous Scripture for Saving from Suffering originates from the Hidden Writ of the Azure Empyrean—it is the secret text of refinement and deliverance.* Its guiding principles number four, with the essence lying in presiding over light and illumination:

First, the *commissioned qi* takes its place. At the beginning, the Primordial One divided the one *qi* to distinguish Heaven and Earth, circulating and transforming yin and yang, becoming the root of the ten thousand things. This is what Master Zhou meant when he said: *The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; it is still and generates yin. Yang transforms and yin unites, giving rise to wood, fire, metal, water, and earth.*

Second, the *qi of compliance* arises. Once Heaven and Earth are distinguished and yin and yang established, humans receive their harmonious *qi* to come into being. This is what Master Zhou meant when he said: *The essence of the two and five wondrously unite and congeal. The way of Qian becomes male; the way of Kun becomes female. The ten thousand things are transformed and born.*

Third, the ten thousand laws are completed. Once the human way is established, sages and worthies emerge among them, setting forth guiding principles and establishing systems—what is called *rectifying virtue, enhancing utility, and enriching life.* Thus the human way is inexhaustible. This is what Master Zisi meant when he said: *Cultivating the Dao is called teaching.*

Fourth, one presides over light and illumination. Light and illumination are the essence of nature. *Presiding* means honoring it as lord. If one honors this light and illumination, always making it the master of the body, then in movement and stillness, speech and silence, all obey its command. Naturally, within the numinous terrace, all is open and unobstructed; nothing can obscure it, and the embodiment of the Dao is complete. This is what *The Doctrine of the Mean* calls *revering the power of virtue*, what *The Great Learning* calls *illuminating the luminous virtue*, and what Zhuangzi calls *the true lord.*

This light and illumination is possessed by all. It does not exist because of Yao nor perish because of Jie; it is not increased by Yan nor extinguished by Zhi. Grasping it, one becomes worthy; abandoning it, one becomes foolish. Attaining it, one ascends to heaven; losing it, one sinks into hell. All the myriad torments of hell—burning, boiling, slaughter, and dismemberment—arise from losing this light and illumination.

The heavens above hold thirty-six; the earth below holds thirty-six. The Great Mystery is boundless—wondrous indeed is the *Great Cavern Scripture.* These words refer to the thirty-six revered scriptures of the Three Caverns and Three Vehicles. In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning revealed the twelve divisions of the *Cavern-Real Scripture*, expounding the Dao of the Nine Sages. In the first kalpa of the Crimson Brightness era, the Dao Lord of the Supreme revealed the twelve divisions of the *Cavern-Mystery Scripture*, expounding the Dao of the Nine Perfected. In the first kalpa of the High Sovereign era, the Supreme Lord Lao revealed the twelve divisions of the *Cavern-Spirit Scripture*, expounding the Dao of the Nine Immortals. In total, over eight thousand scrolls were composed, weaving the *qi* of soaring mystery. The Five Directions’ Purple Scripts blazed in the Great Empyrean; their eight-cornered radiance shone in the Azure Vault. The Heavenly Perfected and August Person took up the brush to inscribe them.

The thirty-six divisions were concealed in the Purple Tenuity’s Golden Portal in the heavens above. The peerless lofty perfected, together with the Ten Spirits and Five Elders, jointly guarded and protected them. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning and the sagely beings of the heavens above all paid homage to their sacred texts thrice each month. They were never transmitted to the world below—hence it is said: *The heavens above hold thirty-six.* The Primordial Beginning further concealed the thirty-six divisions in the Dragon Palace to guard the grotto-heavens of seas and mountains—hence it is said: *The earth below holds thirty-six.* Thus, the Great Mystery is boundless—wondrous indeed is the *Great Cavern Scripture.*

The foolish and benighted speculate, some saying it refers to the yang number four times nine or the yin number six times six, others invoking the seventy-two seasonal markers. Such interpretations stray far from the profound purport—how could they be so deluded? The scriptures of the supreme vehicle have never spoken of derivative numbers.

I take refuge in the Supreme Worthy, who can dissolve all sins.
Taking refuge in spirit and life with the Supreme means never for a moment parting from the Dao. If one does not part from the Dao even for a moment, then the divine luminaries protect one, great fortune follows, and all actions meet with auspiciousness—what sins could there be?

The Celestial Worthy of the Treasure of the King of the Eastern Realm, Supreme in Heaven,

The Celestial Worthy of the Myriad Blessings of the Mysterious Perfection of the Southern Realm,
The Celestial Worthy of the Supreme Mystery of the Western Realm,
The Celestial Worthy of the Jade Dawn of the Mysterious Above of the Northern Realm,
The Celestial Worthy of the Deliverance of Immortals and Supreme Sages of the Northeastern Realm,
The Celestial Worthy of the Nurturing of Life and Deliverance of Destiny of the Southeastern Realm,
The Celestial Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Emptiness of the Southwestern Realm,
The Celestial Worthy of the Boundless Great Splendor of the Northwestern Realm,
The Celestial Worthy of the Jade Emptiness and Luminous Sovereign of the Upper Realm,
The Celestial Worthy of the True Sovereign and Cavern Spirit of the Lower Realm.

The Dao declares: The Celestial Worthies of the ten directions are as numerous as grains of sand. Manifesting forms throughout the ten directions, they universally deliver and save the celestial and human.

The Celestial Worthies of the ten directions are the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthies of the ten directions. Whenever the term "Dao declares" appears, it refers to the words of the Lord of the Dao. This scripture was spoken by the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy, who is the ancestral master of the myriad heavens, the healing king of the three realms, the Jade Sovereign of the Supreme Great Dao. Dwelling in the Perfected Realm of Supreme Purity, within the Palace of the Elixir Pearl and the Sun, he transforms his form into auspicious light and numinous qi, flowing throughout the realms of the ten directions to universally deliver celestial and human beings.

Now, those of celestial and human nature are humble, reverent, and broadly giving; their virtue is magnanimous and tolerant. Serene and gentle, their demeanor is harmonious. They cherish and respect their teachers and friends, and upon hearing the Dao, they firmly believe. These are those endowed with the qualities of celestial and human beings. The Celestial Worthy then transforms his body to descend, bestowing upon them the supreme Dao, delivering and perfecting them—thus it is said, "universally delivering celestial and human beings."

As for those whose roots are impure and evil, who do not uphold precepts and conduct, whose nature delights in slander and killing, and who laugh upon hearing the Dao—these are like those who have lost their way. It is not that the Dao has failed them, but that they have failed the Dao.

Accumulating qi and amassing merit,
Liezi said: "When qi gathers, life arises; when qi scatters, death ensues." Knowing that qi gathering brings life, one cannot prevent it; knowing that qi scattering brings death, one cannot halt it. Since primordial qi cannot be restrained, life belongs to the creator and not to oneself. The perfected attain its essential pivot and can grasp the breath of inhalation and exhalation. As the breath enters and exits under their control, their life rests with them and not with heaven. What the vulgar call "nurturing breath" is in truth the transmitted sacred teaching of the immortals, enlightening the foolish—who can awaken to it? Those who awaken can guide their breath to prevent its scattering, naturally accumulating harmonious qi within a single breath. Over time, as merit and virtue accumulate, they naturally attain perfection—thus it is said, "accumulating qi and amassing merit."

Resonating in harmony to save sinners,
Laozi said: "Those who harmonize with the Dao, the Dao also attains." If one diligently seeks the gate of the master, delights in the profound principle, and exhaustively studies the scriptures and teachings with an undivided mind devoted to the Dao, this is called "resonating in harmony" and "seeking those of the same qi." Only then can one speak of the supreme Dao and deliver them—thus it is said, "resonating in harmony to save sinners."

Sinners are truly pitiable; I now expound this wondrous scripture.
When a person is conceived in the womb, for ten continuous months, they breathe as their mother breathes, inhale as she inhales. With qi complete and spirit intact, they emerge from the womb to be born, startling heaven and earth to become human—this is called infancy. The heart of an infant values only the mother’s milk, knowing nothing else. This is the time of embracing the true and holding to simplicity. After a hundred days, they are enticed by external things, emotions manifest outwardly, and soon they can smile—transforming from infancy to childhood. From this point begins the loss of the Dao and the departure from simplicity. Then, at fifteen, they become youths; at twenty, they come of age. Their eyes are dazzled by the five colors, their ears confused by the five sounds. The seven emotions usurp their nature, the six desires muddy their authenticity, and their pure simplicity is entirely lost. Day and night, they die and are reborn ten thousand times, driving and exhausting their ethereal and corporeal souls without a moment’s rest. Such is the plight of worldly people, enduring the torments of the unceasing hells in their embodied existence, sinking and drowning without hope of escape. Without attaining the Dao, who can be freed? These sinners are truly pitiable. Therefore, the Celestial Worthy widely opens the gate of salvation from suffering, broadly revealing the subtle and wondrous scriptures. The sacred domains of the Three Clarities lie open for return.

Recite without ceasing, return the body without pause.
With a single thought devoted to the Dao, recitation never ceases; delving into the immortal scriptures, contemplation never halts. Since recitation knows no rest, profound mysteries and hidden wonders merge with the natural. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: "When qi enters the body, it is called life; when spirit departs from form, it is called death." Thus, the sage steals and gathers celestial qi, returning it to the body. The sagely work is subtly employed, reversing the cycle of day and night without pause—thus it is said, "return the body without pause."

Heavenly halls enjoy great fortune; hells are silent of suffering.
Heavenly immortals do not depart from heaven, divine immortals do not depart from the divine, earthly immortals do not depart from earth, alchemical immortals do not depart from ingesting elixirs and minerals, and ghostly immortals do not depart from yin spirits. These are the results of the paths they practice, just as water flows to the damp, fire to the dry, clouds follow the dragon, and wind the tiger. Those who cultivate the higher studies concentrate spirit and refine qi, return to life and restore the root, transform their bodies into pure yang, and transcend the kalpas of the dust. Chewing the morning mist, swallowing the nocturnal dew, the two luminaries entwine, the six qi converge upon the body. Inhaling the cloud essence of the Great Brahmā, their wondrous work fully partakes of the celestial kitchen. Naturally, they attain longevity and return to the heavenly halls—thus it is said, "heavenly halls enjoy great fortune." Not consuming the grains of the hundred crops or the essence of the earth, their bodies do not die. Returning to earth, they are free from the suffering of descent—thus it is said, "hells are silent of suffering."

The fire-obscuration transforms into pure clarity.
The fire-obscuration is the name of a southern hell. Sentient beings are constantly scorched by the fire of desire, their eyes veiled by delusion—thus it is called the fire-obscuration. When the eyes move and the heart stirs, hell immediately appears. Yet upon awakening to the true teaching, the nature of heaven becomes radiant and clear. With a single thought profoundly still, the so-called fire-obscuration is transformed into a realm of purity.

The sword-trees transform into towering canopies.
The sword-trees are the name of a hell, where sentient beings vie for fame and profit, contend over self and others, and engage with things as if wielding blades and grinding edges. Their exchanges are like spear and halberd, their faces like those of sworn enemies—thus they suffer the hell of sword-trees. When the perfected one embodies the Dao, embracing vast luminosity and greatness, acting without contention, the thorns in their breast all transform into jade trees and towering forests.

Ascend above to the Vermilion Mansion, descend below into the Gate of Radiant Opening.
This speaks of circulating the fire. The heart is the Vermilion Mansion, called the sovereign fire of upper darkness. By closing the breath and sitting in repose, guiding it with the heart, there is nowhere it does not burn. The kidneys are the Dark and Mysterious Mansion, called the ministerial fire of middle darkness. Rising through the waist, flanks, and abdomen while closing the breath and circulating it, there is nowhere it does not reach. The bladder is called the civil fire of samādhi. By activating the mechanism, the golden tortoise exhales flames, and there is nowhere it does not ascend. Refining the upper corpse, the fire-qi ascends to the Crimson Palace—thus it is said, "ascend above to the Vermilion Mansion." Burning the lower corpse, the fire-qi penetrates the Gate of Tailbone—thus it is said, "descend below into the Gate of Radiant Opening."

Transcend the trials of the Three Realms.
People of the world have their heads beneath the heavens of desire and their feet upon the earth of desire, their bodies dwelling in the Realm of Desire, endlessly revolving within the karmic wheel of the six desires. Never forgetting desire, if one can constantly be without desire, the trials of the Three Realms’ transmigration are instantly transcended.

Directly ascend to the Heaven of Original Beginning.
The Heaven of Original Beginning is the sacred realm of Jade Clarity. When the supreme Dao is accomplished, the spirit ascends to Jade Clarity, attaining the rank of Perfected One. Emerging, all heavens attend their carriage, and the ten thousand spirits stand guard—elevated above the Perfected of Great Clarity and Highest Clarity.

Then, the flying heavenly perfected ones, countless in number, gaze upon the honored countenance and offer this ode:
The eight pieces of the human skull are called the Eight Heavens, also known as the Eight Gates. Within them lie golden towers, jeweled halls, jade pavilions, and purple chambers. Though formless in oneself, the Perfected One presides over all, and the ten thousand spirits dwell therein. When the Dao is accomplished, the divine light illumines within, and the heavenly gates open of themselves. The Infant and Maiden shed their forms, and thus the Perfected One flies forth from the heavenly gates—hence the name "flying heavenly perfected ones." The thousand perfected and ten thousand spirits within the body are the countless multitude.

The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "Above, the Eight Gates open, and the flying heavenly Dharma-wheel turns." The *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* says: "Rejoice in this shedding of the Infant’s form"—this is precisely what it refers to. The spirit ascends to the Dark Capital, ascending to pay homage to the Celestial Venerable—thus it is said, "gaze upon the honored countenance and offer songs," praising the virtue of the Great Sage.

The Heavenly Worthy expounds the scriptural teachings, guiding and receiving the floating lives.
The office of heaven is to cover, the office of earth is to bear, and the office of the sage is to transform through teaching. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy broadly disseminates scriptural teachings to guide and receive the floating lives of the world—this is the duty of the sage.

Diligently cultivate and study non-action.
Non-action that acts is called the Dao; non-action that speaks is called virtue. Heaven is non-active in its clarity, earth is non-active in its tranquility. The two non-actions combine, and the ten thousand things are born—how can humans not practice non-action? Thus it is said: "Serene, tranquil, empty, and non-active—this is the equilibrium of heaven and earth and the essence of the Dao and virtue." The diligent cultivator, the lofty person who abandons learning, can align with non-action, harmonizing with the equilibrium of heaven and earth and conforming to the essence of the Dao and virtue—is this not grand?

Awaken to the true Dao and naturally attain accomplishment.
To awaken to the truth is to realize that the ten thousand conditions are all illusory, and only the Dao is real. Embracing and guarding the real, one naturally attains the Dao.

Neither deluded nor dissipated.
Worldly people are deluded by fame, profit, emotions, and desires, and dissipated by sounds, colors, flavors, and pleasures. Deluded again and again, they reach dissipation—dissipation meaning their spirit is unclear, their heart-mind follows things, drifting away without return. Laozi said: "So dissipated! It has not yet reached its center"—this decisively speaks of never having guarded the center. The perfected one treads the level and easy, walks the serene and joyful, calmly and alone, their spirit and brightness united in vision. All under heaven are but toil and illusion, like wind-blown lamps, foam, lightning, and bubbles—neither enduring nor substantial, unworthy of attachment. Entering the realm of supreme stability and true constancy, where not a single thought arises and the ten thousand conditions cease—at this境界, how could there be any dissipation or delusion?

Neither self nor name.
Not esteeming worthies or abilities, casting aside the self and emptying the body to depart the world—thus it is said, "no self." The Dao is eternally nameless, and thus the sage conceals their light and hides their body, fearing that the Dao is not yet accomplished while their name surpasses their reality. Name is the guest of reality; when empty fame arises, the Dao and virtue are complete—thus it is said, "endlessly, it cannot be named." Zhuangzi said: "The spirit-person is without merit, the perfected one is without self, the sage is without name."

Clearly chant the verses on sin and fortune,
Proclaiming transformation through teaching.
Ten thousand times, the filth of the heart is cleansed.
Through profound study of the sacred canon, the numinous palace becomes empty and bright.

Then, the flying heavenly spirit-kings and all the immortals, having recited this ode, bow their heads to the Heavenly Worthy, take their leave, and withdraw.
The flying heavenly spirit-kings are the original sovereign spirits of our inherent nature. The divine transformations, though many, unite as one—not transforming due to insufficiency but manifesting as the ten thousand, not due to excess. The various immortals are the ten thousand spirits of oneself. Bowing their heads to the Heavenly Worthy, they eternally follow the great Dao. Taking their leave and withdrawing, they return to the Ultimate Non-Being.

*Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of Salvation Spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure of Supreme Mystery and Cavernous Mystery*
Scripture Title: *Commentary on the Wondrous Scripture of Salvation Spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure of Supreme Mystery and Cavernous Mystery*. Composed by Dongyangzi, a Daoist of the Song-Yuan period. One fascicle. Source of the base text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavernous Mystery Section, Jade Instructions Category.

*Preface to the Wondrous Scripture of Salvation of the Numinous Treasure of Supreme Mystery and Cavernous Mystery*
Those who study the Dao of long life and enduring vision must refine qi and nurture spirit, practicing both simultaneously.

Yet the work of refinement and nurturance fundamentally resides in the One Mind. If the mind can diligently cultivate itself, then what hindrance remains to attaining immortality? As the *Declarations of the Perfected* states: "Immortality is the study of the heart—profound indeed is this principle."

I have long admired the pursuit of true reality, though I have yet to encounter a perfected master. Should there be one who can clarify life and death, who penetrates the nature of destiny, I would kneel at their footsteps to seek instruction. Recently, while traveling between Mount Wuyi and West Lake, I chanced upon Master Lü of Siming. At our first meeting, we rejoiced, and soon formed a bond as friends of the misty groves. Together, we returned, and he took residence in my quiet abode.

Master Lü, styled Dongyangzi, early in life met a perfected being and devoted himself to the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi. His mastery of immortal scriptures is vast, and no question lies beyond his understanding. One day, he said to me: "There exists in the world a *Scripture of Salvation*—truly the esoteric essence of the Great Cavern, the secret words of the Supreme Dao. Yet its depths are obscure and its subtleties profound, making its wondrous principles difficult to fathom. Though transmitted since ancient times, its annotations remain unilluminated. I wish to exhaust my store of knowledge to expound its meaning."

Before long, his work was complete—a flowing ten thousand words. It begins by clarifying the single luminous point, identifying auspicious clouds and propitious mists as the Great Harmony. It distinguishes the Gate of Life and the Door of Death as the Mysterious Female, separates the purity and turbidity of the Two Qi, and discerns the fire talismans of the Three Meditations. It reveals the Cavern Chamber as the destination of the enlightened true nature, and the return of celestial qi as the gathering of the treasure of destiny. In sum, it discusses the pivotal essentials of the Supreme Dao, encompassing all within its scope. This is not merely to awaken the unenlightened and aid later learners, but also to enable practitioners to thoroughly comprehend the workings of refinement and silently grasp the celestial mechanism—how could it be compared to empty words or vain rhetoric?

Alas! The wondrous Dao and ultimate teachings of this scripture, long obscured, are now made manifest. The Heavenly Worthy, supreme among the heavens, expounds the Dharma to broadly deliver all beings. This so-called "salvation from suffering" is not solely established for the tormented souls of the departed; rather, its salvation extends to all living beings beneath the heavens. For it aims to guide every person to embody the Dao, to universally depart from delusion, to perceive the clarity of the celestial realm, and to awaken to the non-action of the true nature. Only then may one ingest celestial qi, steal from the void, congeal the sacred embryo, and commune with the numinous. When form and spirit unite in subtlety, one ascends in broad daylight—this is what it means to be a great person transcending the world, escaping the trials of the Three Realms’ cycle of rebirth. Only then is it called true salvation from suffering.

How vast! To transcend death and ferry across life—nothing surpasses this scripture. Those who encounter this commentary and attend to it without ceasing will surely witness their attainment of the Dao.
