### **Preface to the *Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine*: An Exposition of Its Meaning**

#### **On the Structure**
The canonical teachings of the Three Caverns, as one singular vehicle, are broadly divided into three parts: (1) the *Introduction*, (2) the *Main Doctrine*, and (3) the *Dissemination*. This scripture, however, is formed from the spontaneous *qi* of the Three Caverns, crystallized into numinous text—not expounded by any human hand. Thus, its title bears no prefix of "The Most High" (*Taishang*), nor does its opening invoke the "Words of the Dao" (*Daoyan*). It omits an *Introduction* and makes no mention of time or place.

The designation *Dongxuan Lingbao* ("Cavern of Mystery, Numinous Treasure") is appended by the scripture’s redactor to indicate that the Dao it conveys belongs to this tradition. From its opening to the *Great Clarity’s Supreme Ultimate Palace*, it traces the original traces of the Three Treasures. Though these three titles differ in name, their essence is one—until they diverge from their primordial truth. It speaks of the Three *Qi* as the origin of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad transformations, with humanity sharing their root and harmonizing their virtue/power.

The text is internally divided into five chapters:
1. From "These Three Titles" to "Proclaiming the Transformation of the Original Light," it extols the fundamental teachings.
2. From "The *Qi* is pure, lofty, and limpid" to "Together receiving generation and completion," it distinguishes the ritual forms and images, establishing the foundation of the Three Powers.
3. From "Heaven, Earth, and the myriad transformations" to "the ultimate of Heaven and Earth," it subsumes traces to honor the root.
4. From "Humanity’s reception of life" to "never to be born again," it speaks of humanity’s penetration of the Three Powers and the weight of karmic conditions.
5. From "Now, the person" to "their primordial truth," it praises and exhorts cultivation.

Next, from the *Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine* to "what has been heard," it lauds the origin of the chapters and their boundless merit. This section is divided into four chapters:
1. From "The Nine Heavens" to "the natural chapters," it praises the chapters’ spontaneity, embodying both essence and function.
2. From "Heavenly Treasure" to "generating humanity," it expounds the merit of reciting the chapters, with mysterious responses proportionate to one’s capacity.
3. From "Scholars" to "selecting people," it describes the various ranks’ return to the Dao, with self-benefit proportionate to their measure.
4. From "The Three Treasures" to "what has been heard," it returns to the root and reverts to quiescence.

Next, from "Now, those who study the supreme Dao" to "ascending the dawn," it further extols the graded efficacy of cultivation. This section is divided into six chapters:
1. From "Now, those who study the supreme Dao" to "sitting to attain spontaneity," it urges equal emphasis on praise and practice.
2. From "The Three Treasures" to "attaining immortality together," it stresses the secrecy and reverence of their veneration.
3. From "The Three Primes" to "examining the body," it encourages past good deeds and warns against careless transmission.
4. From "Cultivating practice" to "the precious chapters," it advocates abandoning worldly affairs to enter the Dao, calming the mind to unite with the origin.
5. From "Reciting it once" to "generating the divine in one moment," it describes proper practice, with merit accumulating gradually.
6. From "Nine recitations as one cycle" to "ascending the dawn," it outlines the stages of efficacy, ultimately attaining the supreme fruit.

The above constitutes the *Main Doctrine*. Since this scripture takes spontaneity as its宗 (*zong*, fundamental principle), it initially omits an *Introduction*. Here, however, it establishes the *Introduction* of the scripture.

From "The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning" to "bestowing what has not been heard" forms one section, internally divided into nine chapters:
1. From "The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning" to "resounding through the Nine Heavens," it provisionally establishes time and place, displaying majestic demeanor.
2. From "At this time" to "laying bare the heart," the Divine King responds to the moment, preparing to pose his question.
3. From "Thereupon" to "attending the dawn," he arranges his ritual posture, initiates his inquiry, and states his office.
4. From "It is fitting to seize the moment and respond to the assembly" to "good and evil must be distinguished," he seizes the occasion to arouse compassion and proclaim his task of aiding the good.
5. From "Since the Red Clarity Kalpa" to "to fill the storehouse offices," it clarifies the selection of people across three eras to fulfill immortal duties.
6. From "Such examples" to "not a hair’s breadth omitted," it elucidates the correspondence between cause and effect, grading the distinctions.
7. From "Moreover, the Nine Dark Prisons" to "opening the people of Great Possession," it describes the deliverance of those with past good deeds to become citizens of Great Peace.
8. From "At this time" to "this is also the minister’s concern," it discerns the occasion and warns against losing impartiality.
9. From "The great kalpa is pressing" to "bestowing what has not been heard," he opens his heart, assumes responsibility, and piteously seeks the essential Dharma.

Next, from "Thereupon, the Celestial Venerable" to "take care not to transmit it lightly," it clarifies the circumstances of the scripture’s revelation. This section is divided into two chapters:
1. From "Thereupon, the Celestial Venerable" to "the wondrous is also difficult to surpass," the Celestial Venerable responds to the moment, praising the Dao before bestowing it.
2. From "You, who preside over the imperial throne" to "take care not to transmit it lightly," the Celestial Venerable praises and encourages diligence while warning against careless transmission.

The above constitutes the *Introduction*.

From "Ascending the mandate" to "returning to their positions" expounds the essentials of dissemination and describes the ritual procedures. This section is divided into two chapters:
1. From "Ascending the mandate" to "the Divine King then issues the mandate to transmit the scripture, and the assembled perfected ones assume their postures," it details the ritual.
2. "When the Dharma rites are complete, the various heavens return to their positions"—after the transmission of the scripture, the postures are withdrawn, and quiescence is restored.

This constitutes the *Dissemination*.

Next, from "The Celestial Venerable further addressed" to "how could one not be cautious?" it reiterates the secrecy and weightiness of the scripture before presenting the chapters.

### **Explanation of the Nine Heavens’ Meaning in the *Five Kalpas’ Transformation***

The *Yuan Dong Yu Li Zhang* states: In the primordial chaos of *Mingxing* (Obscure Profundity), the great *Brahma* pervaded *Miluo* (the cosmos). Before the heavens were divided, the Nine Yangs merged in darkness. The Three Causes revolved nine times, six transformations and seven revolutions occurred. The Primordial Beginning took form, and the first transformation of the Five Kalpas commenced. Thereupon, the Lord of the Dao of the Dawn of the Primordial *Qi*, the Ancestral Morning, was commanded to record the Heavenly Origin, traversing the Five Kalpas.

Thus, *Yuan Dong* ("Primordial Cavern") names the ancestral *qi*, while *Yu Li* ("Jade Calendar") records the Heavenly Origin. The kalpas revolve five times, returning to their oneness. From the division of the One *Qi*, the Three Causes form the Nine. Like dragons or serpents, they coil through nine paths, collectively embodying the origin of the Nine Yangs’ ancestral *qi*. The Most High employs the Three Nines to revolve the *Brahma*, the Three Fives to ride the origin, combining forty-two *qi*. Three times nine makes twenty-seven; three times five makes fifteen—together forming forty-two.

With the inception of the Azure Heaven’s Primordial *Qi* of the Origin, the dawn of the Eastern Azure’s origin is revealed, corresponding to the initial rise of the Nine Yangs’ Wood Sovereign. Thus, the East receives nine *qi* to divide its celestial realm, and the kalpa is named *Long Han* ("Dragon Han").

Next, the Nine Causes reiterate, and the Yang *qi* unfolds in radiance. Crimson script flows with light, scattering across the Five Measures. The Dark Diagram and Cinnabar Writ—where the Most High employs three times five—three revolutions of the Vermilion Essence—converge twenty-four *qi*. Three times five makes fifteen; three times three makes nine—together forming twenty-four.

With the inception of the Vermilion Heaven’s Primordial *Qi* of the Origin, the dawn of the Southern Vermilion Light’s origin is revealed, corresponding to the initial rise of the Three Yangs’ Fire Sovereign. Thus, the South receives three *qi* to divide its celestial realm, and the kalpa is named *Chi Ming* ("Crimson Clarity").

Next, the Nine Causes accumulate once more, and the Central Yellow transforms the origin. The celestial weft encircles the heavens, as the Primordial *Brahma* rides the Five. The Most High, with five times five and three revolutions, blends the Twelve Yangs, uniting fifty-two *qi*. Five times five makes twenty-five; five times three makes fifteen—combined with the twelve, they total fifty-two.

With the inception of the Central Yellow Heaven’s Primordial *Qi* of the Origin, the dawn of the Central Numinous Yellow Florescence’s origin is revealed, corresponding to the initial rise of the Five Yangs’ Earth Sovereign. Thus, the Center receives twelve *qi* to divide its celestial realm, and the kalpa is named *Shang Huang* ("Supreme August").

Next, the Nine Origins reiterate, and the Pale Radiance inaugurates the Yang. The Seven Luminaries illumine the *Brahma*, as the Five Wefts ride the heavens. The Most High, with seven times five and three revolutions, unites thirty-six *qi*. Three times seven makes twenty-one; three times five makes fifteen—together forming thirty-six.

With the inception of the Pale Numinous Heaven’s Primordial *Qi* of the Origin, the dawn of the Western Pale Luminous Radiance’s origin is revealed, corresponding to the initial rise of the Seven Yangs’ Metal Sovereign. Thus, the West receives seven *qi* to divide its celestial realm, and the kalpa is named *Yan Kang* ("Prolonged Prosperity").

Next, the Nine Causes complete their cycle, and the blended transformations return to their root. The One *Qi* inaugurates radiance. The Most High, with two times five and thirteen revolutions, accumulates the Primordial Yang to unite thirty *qi*—for two times five makes ten, and three accumulations of ten total thirty.

With the inception of the Mysterious Dark Heaven’s Primordial *Qi* of the Origin, the dawn of the Dark Profound’s Supreme Radiance is revealed, corresponding to the initial rise of the One Yang’s Water Sovereign. Thus, the North receives five *qi* to divide its celestial realm, and the kalpa is named *Kai Huang* ("Inaugural August").

The *Xuanshu of Mount Gui* states: The Heavenly Venerable condensed the *qi* of the Primordial Cavern to compose the *Jade Calendar*, taking *Long Han* as the initial kalpa, *Chi Ming* as the middle kalpa, and *Yan Kang* as the final kalpa.

The *Scripture of Numinous Chapters* states: *Long Han* inherits the realm of *Yan Kang*, inaugurating the kalpa named *Chi Ming*.

The Most High dwelled at the inception of the primordial chaos, riding the *qi* of the Prior Heaven, becoming the ancestor of the myriad transformations and accumulating the Yang to form Heaven. The Yang numbers are odd—Heaven’s numbers are twenty-five: one, three, five, seven, nine. The One resides in the North; the One and Six have no fixed position but are lodged in the Center, serving as the inception of the unfolding transformations. The Center faces South, and thus the sequence of *qi*-dispersal begins in the South. Yet the Three, which resides in the South, cannot lack its counterpart; thus, the North opposes the South, and the Five resides there. The *qi*-dispersal of the Prior Heaven follows the reverse sequence. *Qi* has contraction and extension, and thus positions have reversal and compliance—yet reversal itself becomes compliance. Therefore, from the North to the West, the Seven resides there; from the West to the East, the Nine resides there. The East receives the number nine, for here the end returns to the beginning. This Nine is the origin of the myriad things and the root of the Posterior Heaven’s application. Numbers culminate at nine and transform at thirty-six. Three, five, seven, and nine make twenty-four, arrayed at the four directions. The Center’s positionless One, empty at the core, revolves twelve *qi* to complete the number thirty-six. In the *qi*-dispersal of the Prior Heaven, the One begins from the Center. In the *qi*-revolution of the Posterior Heaven, the Five occupies the central position. One begins and one ends, thus the One is doubled to become Two. One extends and one contracts, thus the Five is doubled to become Ten—together forming twelve. Numbers transform at thirty-six; with twenty-four arrayed externally, taking two-thirds of the diameter and circumference, the number remaining at the Center is twelve. Thirty-six is the transformation of nine, and thus the five kalpas and celestial realms are all expressed in terms of nine. Observing the method of the Five Branches returning to Geng, Geng-Zi occupies the first position yet embodies the complete *qi* of the twelve branches—this is of the same principle. The Five Branches’ origin arises from the West’s Jia-Zi Metal, the number seven encountering Geng; the North’s Bing-Zi Water, the number five encountering Geng; the South’s Wu-Zi Fire, the number three encountering Geng; the East’s Ren-Zi Wood, the number nine encountering Geng. The Center’s Geng-Zi Earth, the One unmoving, becomes the return of the Four Branches, thus governing the *qi* of the twelve cyclical signs. The necessity of encountering Geng lies in the transformation of *qi*-numbers. Yet how do the numbers of the five directions correspond? They also arise from the Center, emptying the Center to govern the numbers of the four directions. Thus, three, five, seven, and nine reside in the four directions, serving as the origin of the twenty-four *qi*, while the positionless One and Six are distributed to the four directions, each receiving seven, becoming the origin of the twenty-eight lodges. The One and Six originally summon the North, for the One is the origin of Heaven, and Six is the origin of Earth, while Five is the number of the Center—thus they have no fixed position yet are present in all four directions. Therefore, the One and Five mutually appear in the Center and North, combining their numbers to make Six. One is the inception of the generative numbers; Six is the inception of the consummate numbers. Thus, the Great Inception resides there, serving as the root of generation and consummation. Combining twenty-four and twenty-eight yields the Center’s fifty-two. The numbers of the Prior Heaven are dispersed in reverse, thus first the South and then the North, first the West and then the East—following the sequence of three, five, seven, nine. The *qi* of the Posterior Heaven flows in compliance, thus Wood, then Fire, then Earth, then Metal, then Water—this is how the five kalpas revolve.

The Most High conceals the One within the Center, establishing it as the root of all beginnings. When the One is concealed, the Six is activated. Thus, gathering the Six of the four directions and distributing it to the due South yields twenty-four. Adding another Six and distributing it to the North yields thirty. Next, thirty-six to the West and forty-two to the East—each augmented by Six. Once the Six is activated, its function is again concealed: forty-two reverts to thirty-six, thirty-six to thirty, thirty to twenty-four, and twenty-four becomes the three, five, seven, and nine of the four directions. Divided yet united, united yet divided—such is the supreme subtlety of creation. The so-called correspondence lies in its direction, thus responding to its number.

This is how the Most High conceals the Heavenly One and divides the celestial realms, then employs the Six as the root of the myriad transformations and creations.

**Explication of the Scripture’s Title**
*Exegesis on the Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Spontaneous Nine Heavens’ Chapter on the Generation of the Spirit*, Scroll One
By Dong Sijing of Gui Shan, Celestial Celebration Abbey, Qingyuan

This scripture is formed from the *qi* of the Three Caverns’ soaring mystery, spontaneously coalescing into numinous script before perception or hearing, transcending the bounds of names and words. All perfected beings revere it; all sages honor it. Originally secreted within the Purple Yang Jade Terrace of the Mystic Capital, it was only when the Flying Celestial Divine Kings pitied the calamities of the Nine and Six in the lower world that they personally paid homage to the Heavenly Venerable, earnestly entreating its proclamation. Thereupon, the lofty perfected transmitted it downward, and it has since circulated among the mortal realm.

As for *Dongxuan Lingbao* (Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure), it is the name of one of the Three Caverns’ divisions. *The Spontaneous Nine Heavens’ Chapter on the Generation of the Spirit* is the title of a single text within that division. The Three Caverns are *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection), *Dongxuan* (Cavern of Mystery), and *Dongshen* (Cavern of Divinity). *Dong* signifies emptiness, penetration, and boundlessness; *xuan* signifies profundity and unfathomability. This is the fundamental nature of the Dao, encompassing the Three Powers, merging the myriad existences, yet beyond all inquiry.

*Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure) expresses the boundless transformations of spirit, revered by all sages. In humanity, *dong* (cavern) denotes unimpeded penetration; *xuan* (mystery) denotes unobstructed responsiveness; *ling* (numinous) denotes spiritual wisdom and transformation; *bao* (treasure) denotes the congealing of *qi* into subtlety.

*The Spontaneous Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit*: *Spontaneous* clarifies its essence; *Nine Heavens* reveals its traces; *Generation of the Spirit* manifests its function. Its essence is perfectly merged, fundamentally without dependence—hence it is called *spontaneous*. Nine is the yang number, beginning with one and culminating in nine. *Heaven* denotes the traces where principle resides. *Generation of the Spirit* means that from Heaven, destiny is conferred upon humanity to generate spirit. Spirit, being formless, must lodge within the *qi* of the Nine Heavens to achieve boundless subtlety. *Chapter* refers to its resplendent composition. *Scripture* is the designation for texts that bear the Dao, eternal canons of all ages.

The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Great Cavern; the Heavenly Treasure Venerable is the ancestral *qi* of the Heavenly Treasure Lord—this speaks of the root of the teaching’s traces. The Lord of the Cavern of Perfection is the trace of the Heavenly Treasure, while the ancestral *qi* is its root. This ancestral *qi* is the *qi* of the Primordial Chaos, Supreme Non-Being, and Loftiest Jade Sovereign. The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the ancestor of all Dao, hence the august deity of the Great Cavern.

*Heaven* signifies mystery, taking spontaneity as its meaning, thus named *Heaven*. *Treasure* is the designation for utmost preciousness. *Lord* is the title of utmost honor, signifying reverence by all living beings. It is not called the *Venerable Deity of the Cavern of Perfection* but the *Great Cavern* because before the Three Caverns were divided, they were collectively the Great Cavern—just as before the Two Modes separated, there was only Chaos. *August Deity* denotes its lordship, for it is lofty beyond measure, revered as supreme. The *qi*-mother is perfectly merged, unfathomable as spirit—this refers to the union of principle and *qi*. It is also called *Venerable* because it is the sovereign and most venerable, the first of the *qi*.

The Venerable is the *qi* of the Primordial Chaos, Supreme Non-Being, and Loftiest Jade Sovereign—ninety-nine quadrillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety million *qi*. In the first year of the Dragon Han kalpa, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was transformed and born, and when the scripture emerged, it was titled *Loftiest Great Possession Jade Clarity Palace*.

*Primordial Chaos, Supreme Non-Being*: *Hun* (primordial chaos) signifies undivided unity; *dong* (cavern) signifies empty penetration; *tai* (supreme) signifies utmost greatness; *wu* (non-being) signifies true emptiness. This clarifies the fundamental nature of the Great Dao, vast and penetrating, existing before Heaven and Earth yet truly without form—hence it is called *Primordial Chaos, Supreme Non-Being*. Yet if one speaks only of *Primordial Chaos* without *Supreme Non-Being*, then *Primordial Chaos* nearly merges into a single entity, insufficient to serve as the origin of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. If one speaks only of *Supreme Non-Being* without *Primordial Chaos*, then *Supreme Non-Being* nearly merges into emptiness and quiescence, insufficient to serve as the pivot of yin, yang, and the myriad transformations. Only when both are called *Primordial* (*yuan*) are they unified under a single origin, thus becoming the root of all arising.

The *qi* of the Loftiest Jade Sovereign: the Three Treasures’ original ground all transcend names and words, hence they are collectively called *Supreme*. Yet tracing their traces to their root, Jade Clarity is the highest, thus it is further called *Loftiest*. *Huang* (sovereign) signifies brilliance and greatness; *wang* (king) signifies nurturing virtue. Though this wondrous root is spiritually transcendent and empty, it possesses the virtue of brilliance, greatness, and nurturing—it is the ancestor of *qi*, most venerable and precious, the abode of principle.

Ninety-nine quadrillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety million *qi*: before the chaos, there were no years to record, hence only *qi* is spoken of. When the number accumulated to this point, the Dragon Han kalpa began. Nine is the yang number. The scripture states: "Accumulated yang forms Heaven." The first year of the Dragon Han kalpa saw the transformation and birth of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. *Dragon Han* is the name of the initial kalpa, belonging to the celestial realm of the East. *First year* is the designation for the beginning, not to be equated with the years of the present world. *Transformation and birth* means existence without form, non-existence with essence—since it does not arise from form, it is called *transformation*.

As the *Dongshen Jing* states: "The wondrous image is formless; responsive resonance takes shape. True essence and marvelous *qi* transform to manifest countenance." The two later explanations are identical.

This is the image without form, the shape without appearance—only the Dao as its body, neither belonging to emptiness nor existence. The time of the scriptures' emergence refers to the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, when the *Twelve Divisions of the Dongzhen* were revealed. Yet at that time, neither humans nor creatures had yet appeared—how could scriptures have been produced? It is not known that the texts of these scriptures are the coagulation of *qi*. Wherever *qi* exists, the scriptures are already present; the reason *qi* is as it is lies entirely in the principle of the scriptures.

The Highest Great Possession Jade Clarity Palace is the seat of governance of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. The Numinous Treasure Lord is the revered deity of the *Dongxuan* realm, while the Numinous Treasure Venerable is the ancestral *qi* of the Numinous Treasure Lord. This Numinous Treasure Lord serves as the master of the *Dongxuan* teachings; the various principles have been discussed previously. The Venerable is the *qi* of the Crimson Chaos Supreme Nonbeing Primordial Jade Void—ninety-nine quadrillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million *qi*. Crimson is the color of the South. This speaks of the brilliance of its manifested form, also foreshadowing the appearance of the Crimson Script. Yet though it possesses the four colors, they remain undifferentiated, hence it is called "Crimson Chaos." Since it is called "Crimson Chaos," it may be named as existence; since it is also called "Supreme Nonbeing," it may be named as non-existence. Now, combining these terms, it expresses the wondrous existence of true emptiness, harmoniously without division—thus it is the origin of the myriad transformations. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "The Crimson Text of Chaos Primordial, the peerless true ones." This conveys the same meaning. The meaning of "Primordial Jade" has been discussed previously. "Void" signifies a body fundamentally empty and hollow, fully possessing the virtue of Primordial Jade. Though principle resides therein, it is not a concrete form or vessel—it is constantly self-pervading and unobstructed.

Later, when the Dragon Han kalpa unfolded its chart, the Numinous Treasure Lord was transformationally born. After one kalpa, in the first year of the Crimson Clarity kalpa, the scriptures were revealed to save humanity, and the era was named the *Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital Mysterious Metropolis of Supreme Clarity*. Previously, it was said that in the first year of the Dragon Han kalpa, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was transformationally born; here, it is said that with the unfolding of the Dragon Han chart, the Numinous Treasure Lord was transformationally born. This is because the first year marks the initial kalpa, while the "unfolding of the chart" signifies the manifestation of the transformative origin, where patterns and radiance have already emerged, and the Numinous Treasure Lord was born at that time. Crimson Clarity is the name of the second kalpa, belonging to the celestial realm of the South. "After one kalpa" refers to the Dragon Han kalpa. Thus, the Numinous Treasure Lord was born during the Dragon Han kalpa but revealed the scriptures at the beginning of the Crimson Clarity kalpa. The addition of "saving humanity" signifies that the Numinous Treasure Lord is truly the progenitor of the teachings that deliver beings. The *Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital Mysterious Metropolis* is the palace governed by the Numinous Treasure Lord and also the repository of the scriptures.

The Spirit Treasure Lord is the revered deity of the *Dongshen* realm, while the Spirit Treasure Venerable is the ancestral *qi* of the Spirit Treasure Lord. The Venerable is the *qi* of the Profound Stillness Mysterious Permeation Primordial Jade Void—ninety-nine quadrillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety million *qi* of blackness. Later, in the first year of the Crimson Clarity kalpa, the Spirit Treasure Lord was transformationally born. After two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme August kalpa, the scriptures were revealed, and the era was named the *Three Sovereigns Grotto Spirit Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Palace*. "Spirit" signifies the unfathomable transformations and the meaning of transcending without encumbrance. The explanation of the Treasure Lord is as before. The master of the *Dongshen* teachings is the manifestation of the Spirit Treasure, while the *qi* of the Profound Stillness Mysterious Permeation Primordial Jade Void is its essence. "Profound" speaks of obscurity; "Stillness" denotes tranquility; "Mysterious" means non-attachment; "Permeation" signifies absence of obstruction. This clarifies that though the wondrous origin is obscure, utterly quiescent, and detached from the four extremes, it remains constantly permeating and unobstructed, transcendent and without hindrance. The remaining principles are as before.

They are collectively called "Primordial" because they equally serve as the ancestral leaders of the myriad virtues and the fundamental origin of the myriad transformations. Yet among these three, the first two Primordials are both called "Supreme Nonbeing," while the two subsequent *qi* are both called "Jade Void." The Primordial in the middle derives from the above, while the *qi* below derives from the middle. Thus, the Primordial in the middle and its *qi* uniquely encompass both aspects—could this not be the means by which a single lineage flows without interruption?

By the first year of the Crimson Clarity kalpa, the Spirit Treasure Lord was transformationally born. After two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme August kalpa, the scriptures were revealed, and the era was named the *Three Sovereigns Grotto Spirit Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Palace*. This is because the Dragon Han and Crimson Clarity kalpas constitute two kalpas, while Supreme August is the name of the central kalpa. When the master of the *Dongshen* teachings descended to transform, the *Three Sovereigns Grotto Spirit Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Palace* was the designation of his abode.

Examining the *qi* accumulated by the Three Primordials, their quantities differ in gradation. From the Upper Primordial to the Middle Primordial, the reduced number is already vastly unequal, and the Lower falls even further short—this reveals the gradual acceleration of the cosmic cycles, akin to the progression of a human life from youth to maturity and then to old age.

Though these three designations differ in kalpa and name, their essence is one. They divide into the Three *Qi* of Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin, governing the Three Treasures. All are revered deities of the Three *Qi*, born of the Three Designations, and the Three Designations together generate the Nine *Qi*. From non-existence to existence—even "existence" is but a forced appellation. From the One to the Three, the Three do not depart from the One. Though the Three Primordials differ in designation, they fundamentally share a single purpose and return to the same source. Speaking of differing kalpas refers to the distinctions among Dragon Han, Crimson Clarity, and Supreme August; speaking of differing names refers to the distinctions among Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, and Supreme Clarity. Yet in reality, they all derive from the ancestral *qi* of the Origin and ultimately unite in the supreme Dao of the *Dongzhen*.

Thus, when one seeks to meet it, its beginning is unseen; when one follows it, its end is unseen—is this not the ultimate subtlety of its essence? Yet when it is designated by kalpa and named by *qi*, are these not merely its manifest traces that can be named? Nevertheless, the traces have never departed from the essence, nor has the essence ever differed from the account.

They divide into the Three *Qi* of Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin to govern. Alternatively, according to the *Hundun Chapter of the Seven Lots*: "One *qi* divides into the Three *Qi* of Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin to order the Three Treasures"—here, the phrase "to govern the Three Treasures" is an awkward construction.

The above speaks of these three designations, while below it states they are fundamentally one—this is the gathering of the Three into One. Yet it also says they divide into the Three *Qi*, which is the unfolding of the One into Three. The *Scripture of the Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens* states: "The Origin *qi* is blue; when the blue *qi* refines and clarifies, it is called the Heaven of Pure Tenuity. The Primordial *qi* is white; when the white *qi* refines and clarifies, it is called the Heaven of Yu-Yu. The Mysterious *qi* is yellow; when the yellow *qi* refines and clarifies, it is called the Heaven of Great Redness. The Three *Qi* all arise within the Void and Cavern, spontaneously dividing from One into Three to govern the Three Heavens, and only then do they guide and steer the world."

The Three Treasures are the Heavenly Treasure, the Numinous Treasure, and the Spirit Treasure—these are the sovereigns within the *qi*, hence they are called the Venerable Spirits. The Three *Qi* are the Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin *qi*. Each designation generates Three *Qi*, so the three designations together produce Nine *Qi*. The *Orthodox Dharma Scripture* states: "Once the Three Heavens were established, the Origin *qi* gave rise to the *Hun* *qi*; the *Hun* *qi* was dark green, and when it refined and clarified, it generated the Heaven of Immeasurable Purity. The *Hun* *qi* gave rise to the *Dong* *qi*; the *Dong* *qi* was red, and it generated the Heaven of Immeasurable Longevity. The *Dong* *qi* gave rise to the *Hao* *qi*; the *Hao* *qi* was dark green, and it generated the Heaven of Brahma’s Surveillance. The Primordial *qi* gave rise to the *Hao* *qi* (or *Yu* *qi*); the *Hao* *qi* was green, and it generated the Heaven of Tusita. The *Hao* *qi* gave rise to the *Jing* *qi*; the *Jing* *qi* was yellow, and it generated the Heaven of Joy Without Arrogance. The *Jing* *qi* gave rise to the *Dun* *qi*; the *Dun* *qi* was white, and it generated the Heaven of Responsive Transformation. The Mysterious *qi* gave rise to the *Rong* *qi*; the *Rong* *qi* generated the Heaven of Brahma’s Assistance. The *Rong* *qi* gave rise to the *Yan* *qi*; the *Yan* *qi* was azure, and it generated the Heaven of Clarity and Brightness. The *Yan* *qi* gave rise to the *Yan* *qi*; the *Yan* *qi* was black, and it generated the Heaven of No-Thought. The Nine *Qi* all arise within the Three Upper *Qi*, each separated from the upper *qi* by nine hundred million kalpas."

Within the human body, the Three *Qi* and Three Treasures are the original spirit, original *qi*, and original essence, residing in the three cinnabar fields and dividing to guard the nine palaces. The Nine *Qi* emerged before the Great Void, concealed within the Void and Cavern. Without light, without image, without form, without name, without color, without texture, without sound, without voice. The *True Scripture of Vanquishing Demons, Chapter on Guarding the One* states: "The first is Origin-Nothingness, which is Jade Purity. The second is Primordial Cavern, which is Highest Purity. The third is Mysterious Void, which is Supreme Purity." Thus, emerging before the Great Void refers to the original state before *qi* was visible—this is what is called the original spirit. Concealed within the Void and Cavern refers to the union of Primordial Cavern and Mysterious Void—this is what is called the original *qi* and original essence. At this time, one looks but does not see, listens but does not hear. Hence, there is no light, no image, no form, no name, no color, no texture, no sound, no voice. Observing it at its inception, it is utterly empty and without trace, initially without any perceptible sign. Yet the principles of yin and yang, movement and stillness, are all fully contained within it. This is why it is the foundation for guiding and steering the world.

Guiding and steering the world, opening and penetrating the mysterious, the three colors of chaos alternately existing and vanishing, revolving and exhausting their numerical limits, the Three *Qi* unfold their radiance. The preceding section praises the origin and proclaims transformation.

*Qi* pure and lofty clarifies, accumulating yang to form heaven. *Qi* congealing and turbid stagnates, accumulating yin to form earth. "Guiding" means to enlighten; "steering" means to govern. As if there were something causing it to be so, this is the pivot of mysterious revolution, the framework of creation, by which the Two Modes open and the Three *Qi* transform. The three colors are blue, white, and yellow; the Three *Qi* are Origin, Primordial, and Mysterious. When the three colors are obscurely one, in a state of undifferentiated chaos, about to divide yet not yet divided, alternately existing and vanishing, now separating, now uniting, suddenly appearing, suddenly disappearing—after nurturing for a long time, the revolution advances further, and the numbers follow accordingly. Once the numbers are complete, the *qi* unfolds its radiance. The light and pure *qi* belongs to yang, thus it floats above and clarifies, accumulating to form heaven. The heavy and turbid *qi* belongs to yin, thus it stagnates below and congeals, accumulating to form earth. From the unfolding of the Three *Qi*’s radiance to the formation of heaven and earth, all follows this sequence.

The Nine *Qi* arrayed in order, the sun, moon, and constellations, yin and yang, the Five Phases, the multitudes of people, and the myriad things all receive their generation and completion. The preceding section distinguishes the patterns of the cosmos and establishes the foundation of the Three Powers. This speaks of the Nine *Qi* as the root of the myriad things, as referred to in the scriptures. The *Orthodox Dharma Scripture* states: "Three times three transformations give rise to the Nine Origins." "Arrayed" means orderly and well-regulated; "order" means steadfast and not deviant. Within the undifferentiated chaos, patterns shine forth in brilliant succession, neither borrowing from nor encroaching upon one another—this is because they are governed by a fundamental principle and converge at an original source.

The sun is the essence of the great yang; the moon is the essence of the great yin. The stars, according to the *Preface to the Star Scripture*, are bodies born of earth and essences emitted by heaven. The constellations are the arrayed stars. Yin and yang are the movement and stillness, contraction and extension of the original *qi*, from which yin and yang divide. The Five Phases are substances contained in earth and *qi* circulating in heaven. In terms of substance, the sequence of generation is water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. In terms of *qi*, the sequence of circulation is wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Even the multitudes of people and the profusion of categories ultimately arise from the Nine *Qi* arrayed in order and then receive their generation and completion.

The myriad transformations of heaven and earth cannot be generated without being nurtured by the Three Origins and guided by the Nine *Qi*. The Three *Qi* are the honor of heaven and earth; the Nine *Qi* are the root of the myriad things. Thus, the union of the Three constitutes the ultimate virtue of heaven and earth. The preceding section speaks of gathering traces to honor the origin. "Nurturing" means compassionate cultivation; "guiding" means propelling revolution.

Spirits and divine emperors, in generating heaven and earth, cannot do so without being nurtured by the Three Origins. The myriad beings, in assuming their forms and each aligning with their nature and destiny, cannot do so without being guided by the Nine *Qi*. This is how they establish the framework of creation, flowing through ancient and modern times, serving as the honor of heaven and earth and the root of the myriad things. The union of the Three to form virtue is the ultimate of heaven and earth—this is the process of three becoming nine, nine returning to three, and ultimately reverting to the One. As the *Zhengfa Sutra* states, "From nine return to one," which is the true entry into the Dao.

Tracing back to the root of creation and generation, one knows that the true virtue of the Three Origins is a harmonious unity, profound and formless, standing supremely before heaven and earth as the standard for all transformations. Thus, in bestowing upon the myriad things, each receives without deficiency or excess—this is what is meant by "descending the impartial endowment." When a person receives life within the womb, nurtured by the Three Origins and shaped by the Nine *Qi*, the spirit is distributed and *qi* fills the body by the ninth month, enabling sound. The sound takes in the spirit, which is fully possessed. The Nine Heavens rejoice in celebration. The Great One holds the talisman, and the Imperial Lord ranks the destiny. The Recorder inscribes the register, and the Director of Destinies fixes the allotted span. The Five Emperors oversee birth, and the Holy Mother guards the chamber. Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, along with the guardians of the Three Realms, all stand vigilant. The Marshal of the Nine Heavens stands in the courtyard, facing east to recite the *Ninefold Treasured Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Giving Spirits* nine times. For a male, the myriad spirits chant "reverence," and for a female, they chant "service." For a male, the Director of Destinies respectfully assents; for a female, it respectfully complies. Only then is life granted. If the Marshal of the Nine Heavens does not descend with the command chapters, and the myriad spirits do not chant their reverent assent, birth will not occur.

The preceding section speaks of humanity spanning the Three Powers and the weight of life’s karmic convergence. The Three *Qi* are the honor of heaven and earth; the Nine *Qi* are the root of the myriad things. Only humans, born within the womb, receive the endowments of both heaven, earth, and the myriad things, and thus are most numinous and uniquely noble, serving as the heart of heaven and earth. The nurturing by the Three Origins is the same process that generates heaven and earth, and humanity, as their sovereign, receives this to become its nature—the inherent goodness of the constant norm. The shaping by the Nine *Qi* is the same process that circulates between the two realms, bestowing upon the myriad things, and humanity, as their fundamental origin, receives its rectitude to form the body—the resource for shaping form. When the ninth month’s count is complete, the *qi* of the Nine Heavens descends in full. The spirit resides within this *qi*, blending seamlessly, so when *qi* is full, the spirit is also pervasively distributed throughout the body. Sound is the activation of spirit and *qi*. "Takes" means to acquire, and "fully possessed" means complete. The rejoicing of the Nine Heavens arises because heaven takes the generation of beings as its heart; thus, when the *qi* encounters no obstruction and a person is successfully formed, the Nine Heavenly Emperors praise and delight in it.

The Great One holding the talisman: As the *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* states, the Five Spirits—Great One, Duke’s Son, White Prime, Director of Destinies, and Peach Prosperity—ascend into the Purple Chamber, each presenting a blue jade tablet bearing five talismans to the Imperial Lord. Here, the Great One holding the talisman refers to the Five Spirits, with the Great One as their chief. Thus, the *Jade Sutra of the Great Cavern* states, "The Great One, Divine Master, holds the omen-talisman in his left hand." The Great One is the spirit of the initial shaping of the embryo, named "Duty and Care." At a person’s birth, it holds the talisman to harmonize the myriad spirits. After birth, it guards the Jade Pillow beneath the Muddy Pellet’s rear gate.

The Imperial Lord ranking destiny and the Recorder inscribing the register: The Imperial Lord, also called Crimson Radiance or Lingfan, alternatively known as the Divine Elder, determines the rank of one’s destiny. Once born, it guards the Purple Gate outside the space between the eyebrows. The Recorder is the Lord Director of Records, who inscribes the register of destiny. The Director of Destinies fixing the allotted span refers to the Central Director of Destinies, Elder of Reason and Clarity, who initially sets the span. After the body is formed, it guards the Crimson Palace within the heart’s chamber, at the gate of the blood aperture.

The Five Emperors overseeing birth are the emperors of the five directions: the Azure Emperor at the Carved Beam’s Edge, the Vermilion Emperor of Everlasting Awareness, the White Emperor of Prosperous Fortune, the Black Emperor of Preserved Prosperity, and the Yellow Emperor of Forest Void or Containing Radiance. Together, they oversee a person’s birth. The Holy Mother guarding the chamber is the Holy Mother of the Nine Heavens, who governs birth and completion, thus protecting the chamber. Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, along with the guardians of the Three Realms—heaven, earth, and water—all stand vigilant. "Spirits" refers to those in heaven, as their yin and yang are unfathomable; "deities" refers to those on earth, as they manifest visibly to people.

The Marshal of the Nine Heavens is the Supreme Marshal of Immortals, the Master of Longevity, whose name is Sudden Birth of Cypress. The courtyard is the central position, and east is the direction of generative *qi*. "Nine times" refers to the completion of the chapters. For a male, the chant of "reverence" and respectful assent conveys honor and celebration; for a female, the chant of "service" and respectful compliance conveys joy and submission. This is how distinctions of nobility and humility are made. The command chapters are the nine chapters. The statement that without descending the command chapters, birth will not occur means that the pivot of fortune and misfortune, life and death, lies in a single mechanism; thus, opposing it prevents birth.

The above spirit names are from the *Arrayed Records of the Three Heavenly Lords*.

For a person to return and be born in the human realm, washing their form in the Great Yang, startling heaven and earth, the honor is indeed profound. Heavenly perfected ones and earthly spirits, along with the guardians of the Three Realms, all attend—this is not a trivial matter. Even at the moment of birth, it is not to be deemed insignificant. The term "returning to life" means that the principle of heaven is inherently blended within humanity; possessing it brings life, while losing it brings death.

Thus, when born into the human realm, the heavenly principle is restored. "Washing the form in the Great Yang" means departing from utmost yin to bathe in utmost yang. The Shu commentary states: Upon obtaining a human body, one must first enter the South Crimson Fire-Refining Pool, cleansed by the Yellow Flower’s waters, then descend into the womb to take residence—only then can one become fully human. It is not called "Yellow Flower" but "Great Yang." The Yellow Flower is the essence of yang, the celestial abode above the sun, also named the Cavern Yang Palace. Within it lies the Flowing Fire Pool, where the Yellow Flower’s true water resides, and where heavenly beings constantly bathe their forms. Both are preserved therein.

Now, the human spirit aligns its virtue with the Three Treasures, while qi shares its root with the Nine Heavens. Head and feet mirror heaven and earth, the seven apertures correspond to the Three Luminaries, and the Three Powers interflow—its mechanism is singular. Thus, it is fitting that heaven and earth are startled, the honor is indeed profound, the Three Realms all attend, and it is not trivial. At the moment of birth, it is not to be deemed insignificant. How then, as a human, can one fail to esteem oneself?

Therefore, one must cherish the form, preserve the spirit, honor the qi, and secure the root—only then can one avoid death and decay, attain immortality, bones and flesh ascending together, and ascend to the Three Clarities, merging virtue with the Three Qi and uniting with the Nine Qi. Yet, though born as a human, if one fails to revere their qi, esteem their form, treasure their life, or cherish their spirit, they bring about their own decay, severing from their original true nature. The preceding section praises and earnestly exhorts cultivation.

Moreover, the human form emulates heaven and models earth, responds to the Three Powers and embodies the Five Phases, nurtured by blood and qi, entrusted with intelligence and clarity—how can it not be cherished? Yet the form is not merely form; there must be that which animates it. Thus, one must also preserve the spirit. The *Nanhua Sutra* states: Be pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, serene and without action, moving in accordance with heaven’s course—this is the Dao of nurturing the spirit. To honor the qi is to conserve it and not dare misuse it. To secure the root is to guard it and not depart from its origin. Hence it is said: Guard the center, embrace the One, and unite with heaven. This is the meaning of avoiding death and decay.

Thus, one begins by cherishing the form and ends by fulfilling it, begins by preserving the spirit and ends by exhausting its mysteries. Only then can one ride the clouds and qi to wander the Great Clarity, merging virtue with the Three Qi and uniting with the Nine Qi. If one acts contrary to this, how long before decay and severance from one’s original true nature? It is self-inflicted.

From the Three Names to this point, the text is divided into five chapters. The "Nine Heavens Birth-Spirit Chapter" is the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, threefold harmonizing into sound, weaving into numinous script, blending the hundred spirits, concealing inner names in hidden rhymes, where generative qi coalesces into form—this is the natural chapter. The preceding section extols the completeness of the natural body’s functions. Here, it elaborates on the text of the "Birth-Spirit Chapter," which harmonizes the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, weaving it into sound, hence "threefold harmonizing into sound, weaving into numinous script." Within it, the hundred spirits blend, inner names are concealed in hidden rhymes, and the efficacy of generative qi coalescing into form is manifest. The hidden rhymes are the concealed verses of the various heavens, while the inner names are the esoteric names of the myriad spirits.

When the Heavenly Treasure is recited, it illuminates heaven and earth. When the Numinous Treasure is recited, it awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms. When the Spirit Treasure is recited, it governs the myriad spirits. When the Great One is recited, it completes the body’s spirits. When the Imperial Lord is recited, it coalesces form. When the Nine Heavens are recited, it gives birth to humans. The preceding section speaks of the merits of reciting the chapter, with mysterious responses following one’s capacity.

Scholars recite it to ascend to heaven. The Heavenly Treasure Lord manifested at the dawn of the Dragon Han era, when above there was no longer light, below no longer abyss, only the vast expanse of primordial chaos, boundless and lightless. The Heavenly Treasure, with its natural chapter, opened and divided it, establishing the positions of above and below, illuminating heaven and earth. The Numinous Treasure Lord manifested at the Dragon Han’s unfolding of the cosmic pattern, becoming the progenitor of salvation—thus it awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms. The Spirit Treasure Lord manifested in the first year of the Red Brightness era, truly the lord of the myriad spirits—hence it governs them, meaning it universally commands them. The Great One is Wu You Shou, the honored among all spirits—thus reciting it completes the spirits within the body. The Imperial Lord is Feng Ling Fan, where "coalescing form" means coalescing qi into form. The Nine Heavens are the emperors of the Nine Heavens. The above describes the merits of reciting the chapter, which are acts of benefiting others.

Recitation and hearing are counterparts: recitation bestows its grace, while hearing receives it. Scholars stand between the six counterparts, initially self-cultivating, yet upon achieving success, they benefit others. Though the functions vary with use, the Dao remains singular.

Ghostly spirits hear it and ascend. Ordinary people hear it and attain longevity. Lost souls hear it and are delivered. Withered bones hear it and emit vapor. Infants hear it and gain speech. The dead hear it and return to life. The preceding section speaks of the myriad beings’ return to the source, self-cultivating according to their capacity.

Vapor is the warm qi rising to generate life, the harmonizing breath. The *Great Cavern Sutra* states: "The Seven Mysteries arise again, and the luminous scene emits vapor." The Three Treasures’ divine profundity is the root of all beings. Thus, it is beyond the knowledge of ghosts and spirits, beyond what ordinary people can hear. The preceding section speaks of returning to the original source and quiescence.

The spirit is wondrous, transforming the myriad things yet unfathomable. The profundity is hidden, concealing the ultimate principle yet difficult to know. That it is the root of all beings is supremely mysterious, beyond the knowledge of ghosts and spirits, beyond what ordinary people can hear. The root is like that of plants and trees, unseen by humans yet truly the foundation of flourishing.

Yet the preceding passage speaks of ghosts and spirits hearing it to ascend and transform, and ordinary mortals hearing it to attain longevity, while here it declares it beyond the knowledge of ghosts and spirits, beyond what ordinary people can hear—why is this? For the Nine Chapters’ mysterious efficacy, discussed above, is the most manifest operation of the Dao, whereas this discourse on the Three Treasures’ divine profundity concerns the most subtle essence of the Dao.

From the "Nine Heavens’ *Shengshen* Chapter" to this point, the text is divided into four sections. Those who study the supreme Dao, yearning for immortality, and even those who attain *shijie* or undergo *miedu* and *zhuanshu*, ultimately return to the immortal Dao, where form and spirit unite, never parting, both entering the perfection of the Dao. The *Eight Essentials of the True Scripture* states: "The Supreme Dao has three divisions, the Upper Perfected Dao seven, the Middle Perfected Dao six, and the Lower Perfected Dao eight." The Nine Chapters are the gateway to the *Great Cavern*, and the *Dongjing* ranks as the fifth text among the Upper Perfected Dao—hence it is called the supreme Dao. *Shijie* belongs to the category of the Five Liberations. *Miedu* and *zhuanshu* refer to what the *Scripture of Salvation* describes as those of shallow cultivation whose immortal rank is incomplete, fated to undergo *miedu*. It also speaks of *zhuanshu* without annihilation, whereby one attains immortality. Such learning and yearning are the pursuits of those who have not yet arrived. Thus, some may attain *shijie* or undergo *miedu* and *zhuanshu*, yet if they possess the aspiration and persist in study, they will ultimately return to the immortal Dao, achieving unity of form and spirit, never parting, both entering the perfection of the Dao.

All cultivation must reach the perfection of the Dao to attain its ultimate state. Yet to attain this perfection, one cannot do without this text. Without it, the fetal obstructions remain bound, the deathly *qi* solidifies the root, the true radiance is not preserved, the life-generating *qi* lacks regulation, the nine apertures become blocked, the body fails to generate spirit, and one merely bears a form, as if borrowing *qi* to move about. By mastering this method, one may sit and attain spontaneity.

The preceding section speaks of unified praise and exhortation. All humans, while in the womb, receive the *qi* of the Nine Heavens, which coalesces to form a person. After birth, twelve knotted obstructions remain coiled within the five viscera. The five viscera become stagnant and obstructed, the knots insoluble, the nodes indestructible. Thus, illness arises from knotted stagnation, and death from bound obstructions. The *Scripture of the Azure Spirit and Yang Peace Lord* states: "The hundred knots of the five viscera give rise to myriad illnesses. The mysterious unity of the Forest of Emptiness opens the gates and dissolves the knots. When knots are severed, illness scatters; spirit and essence overflow; the immortal Dao advances daily, while the path of death recedes." This intent pervades every chapter of the *Great Cavern*. For if the fetal root is not severed, one cannot escape the wheel of rebirth; if the knotted obstructions are not dissolved, life-generating *qi* cannot arise. This is the essential formula for generating spirit and the primary task of cultivating the true.

To merely bear a form, moving about as if borrowing *qi*, means possessing a body yet ignorant of the Dao of generating spirit—how is this different from a walking corpse? Yet if one knows this text and sits to advance in this Dao, the hundred spirits merge, transforming into the Imperial Unity. Entering without exit, dancing upon the wheel of emptiness, one sits and attains spontaneity—this is no deception.

The Three Treasures are revered, the Nine Heavens’ utmost perfection. Their secrecy is of the greatest importance, sealed within the nine-tiered golden lattice of the Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Unless heaven and earth undergo a new inception, this text shall not emerge. It is the *Yuan Shi*’s forbidden scripture, not to be heard by ghosts or spirits. Those who steal it shall face the Wind Blade for ten thousand kalpas, their souls perishing without rebirth. Those who follow the regulations and uphold it shall unite form and spirit as immortals.

The preceding section speaks of secrecy, reverence, and devotion. The *Scripture of Generating Spirit* is the revered text of the Three Treasures, the teachings of the Nine Heavens’ utmost perfection, concealed within the Palace of Great Existence. The *Five Elders’ Jade Tallies* state: "Great Existence is the Purple Palace of the Nine Heavens, the profound depths of ninefold seals." The lattice refers to the tables, the terrace to the place where the scripture is enshrined. Unless the Dragon Han era unfolds its charts and a divine king pleads to lift the prohibition, how could this text be seen? Thus, those who steal it incur punishment, while those who uphold it attain immortality.

According to the *Great Cavern’s Feminine Unity Scripture*, the *Tai Shang*’s regulations state: "Those who transmit celestial scriptures yet bring calamity upon their ancestors bear the weight of violating their vows, guarding against the breach of their covenant." Furthermore, the *Black Record’s Upper Chapter* describes, beyond the Water and Fire Officials, the Wind Blade’s left and right officials. The Left Wind Examiner governs those who receive scriptures, talismans, or esoteric formulas without vows, cultivating for profit or self-interest, thereby incurring the crime of harming celestial regulations. The Right Blade Examiner governs those who violate oaths, betray masters or friends, judge good and evil, or attack the root—crimes of the utmost gravity. From this, one must guard against theft and strive to uphold the teachings.

Those whose names are inscribed in gold within the Three Yuan Palace, whose characters are etched in purple, are destined in their next life to become immortals of the Three Clarities. When the time and conditions align, they shall offer gold and treasures, serve their master with devotion, receive the text in accordance with the regulations, and vow to uphold it. They must guard their hearts and practice diligently, never lightly divulging it, lest the Wind Blade examine their bodies.

The preceding section exhorts those with past good roots to guard against careless transmission. The Three Yuan Palace is the Three Clarities’ Palace. The *Five Elders’ Jade Tallies* state: "This book was once hidden, unknown to the world. Only the Supreme Mystery possesses golden tablets, jade records, and purple slips; the Three Yuan holds the *Hidden Record of the Conjoined Dawn*; the Cinnabar Terrace contains the yellow-character texts. These are reserved for those destined to become perfected beings." When the karmic conditions for receiving the scripture arise, one must offer gold and treasures, serve the master with devotion, and receive it in accordance with the regulations. After receiving it, "guarding the heart and practicing" means cultivating in silence.

The meaning of the Wind Blade has been explained earlier. The method of cultivation requires a thousand-day fast, disengagement from worldly affairs, the exhaustion of all defilements, a tranquil mind in silent recitation, holding incense and observing precepts. Entering the chamber facing east, one knocks the teeth nine times, regulates the voice and aligns the *qi*, then recites and chants the precious chapters.

The preceding chapter speaks of relinquishing worldly affairs to enter the Dao, calming the heart to align with the primordial. According to the *Scripture of the Forty-Nine Chapters of the Void Sovereign*: "Fasting and precepts are the root of the Dao and the bridge of its methods. If you wish to study the Dao, you must purify yourself with fasting and uphold the precepts, maintaining right mindfulness in every thought—then deviant delusions will naturally vanish."

Now, this "purifying fast" is a fast of the heart. As the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: "If the will is unified, do not listen with the ears but with the heart; do not listen with the heart but with *qi*. Listening ceases at the ears, the heart ceases at resonance. *Qi* is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness—emptiness is the fast of the heart." Thus, Yan Junping said: "Empty the heart to seek the Dao and virtue; still the *qi* to await the numinous." Lu Xiujing’s *Fasting Compendium* also states: "Though the human body is not that of a sage or perfected being, it dwells in the Five Turbidities, where the Three Corpses flourish, internally generating attacks and thievery. The nine orifices and four gates each pursue their own inclinations, and in all actions, one treads the path to death. Therefore, ritual texts and instructional models are established to regulate the external, while methods of focused mindfulness and concentrated spirit are prescribed to rectify the heart. Further, through the art of refining *qi* within the primordial womb and regulating diet, one restrains the senses; through offerings to the perfected and repentance for transgressions, one purifies faults. Only then may one proceed to study.

Those who do not study reach the depths of stillness, abiding in the realm of reduction upon reduction, aligning with non-action—thus, the gates of deceit and cunning remain closed, and the purity of tranquil harmony may be attained. Yet human karmic habits run deep and heavy, making sudden union with the Dao difficult. By using fasting to sever worldly ties and quieting the heart to align with the Dao, one must observe a thousand-day fast, disengaging from worldly affairs—then the heart becomes single-minded, and the practice endures, maturing over time. Only then will the defilements of the senses naturally be purified.

Generally, the human heart, if not awakened to subtlety, cannot achieve immediate clarity and stillness. As it is said: 'If the heart does not wander in heavenly realms, the six senses will contend.' Thus, the primordial oneness of the true cannot avoid scattering and leaking through the senses. Now, with all defilements dissolved, the heart becomes level and thoughts grow silent. 'Level heart' means open and even; 'silent thought' means stillness without thought.

Then, one holds pure incense and upholds the precepts. Pure incense is used for its fragrance, harmonizing *qi* in profound obscurity, connecting with the perfected and reaching the sages. Purity signifies the clarity of the heart; fragrance signifies the sweetness of virtue. 'Precepts' mean examining oneself and restraining one’s conduct, preventing transgressions and guarding against wrongdoing. 'Upholding' means treasuring and maintaining them. If one can achieve a level heart and silent thought, the primordial oneness becomes clear and deep, all phenomena are empty—then one attains the subtlety of neither holding nor transgressing. Why, then, uphold precepts? Yet, as it is said: 'Without mindfulness, even the sage becomes mad.' If not for this, the work of clarity and cultivation would be lax. Thus, the body of tranquil preservation must first be established, so that the function of dynamic observation naturally becomes manifest.

Entering the chamber facing east draws upon its *qi*. Knocking the teeth nine times gathers the multitude of spirits. Nine is the number of yang. The *Scripture of Divine Illumination from the Supreme Treasure* states: "The method of knocking the teeth: the left is the Heavenly Bell, the right is the Heavenly Chime, and the center is the Heavenly Drum. To dispel inauspiciousness, strike the Heavenly Bell; to subdue evil, strike the Heavenly Chime. To concentrate thought and gather spirits, invoking the utmost truth of the Dao, strike the Heavenly Drum. One must close the mouth and relax the cheeks, so the sound is hollow and the resonance deep."

The *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: "The teeth are the outer defense of the gallbladder spirit, the might of the stomach spirit, and the essence of the *Kan* spirit. Is this not to dispel inauspiciousness through outer defense, subdue evil through might, and connect with the utmost truth through essence?" Then, one regulates the voice and aligns the *qi*, reciting and chanting the precious chapters.

When the voice is regulated, it is known that the *qi* is aligned, for this is manifest externally. Thus it is said: "When the heart is harmonious, the *qi* is harmonious; when the *qi* is harmonious, the body is harmonious; when the body is harmonious, the voice is harmonious; when the voice is harmonious, the harmony of heaven and earth responds." The *Hidden Commentary Instructions* state: "After reciting five hundred words of the scripture, knock the teeth three times, lick the upper and lower lips with the tongue, and swallow saliva three times—this ensures the *qi* does not exhaust and the voice remains clear."

This passage in the scripture refers to the essential method of entering the Dao, which the practitioner should devote their heart to. How could it be merely reciting with the mouth? Reciting once, the sound reaches the Nine Heavens. Reciting twice, heaven and earth show reverence. Reciting thrice, the Three Realms bow in homage. Reciting four times, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. Reciting five times, the Five Emperors attend the perfected. Reciting six times, the demon kings bind themselves. Reciting seven times, the stellar lodges halt their gates. Reciting eight times, the darkest night becomes luminous. Reciting nine times, all heavens descend. Every spirit and deity, without exception, guards the carriage.

By following the preceding methods of cultivation, the responses to reciting the chapters are thus. Speaking in terms of the Two Modes: the first is the yang mode, which is heaven—thus, reciting once, the sound reaches the Nine Heavens. The second is the yin mode, which is earth—thus, reciting twice, heaven and earth show reverence. The later text says "reciting twice resounds in the earth," here referring specifically to earth. Since the first recitation just reaches the Nine Heavens, at this point the celestial and terrestrial deities both show reverence—thus, it is spoken of together. As in the *Scripture of Salvation*, where "heaven and earth show reverence." Reciting thrice corresponds to the establishment of the Three Powers, so all spirits of the Three Realms, without exception, pay homage to the chamber. Reciting four times corresponds to the Four Symbols—thus, the Azure Heaven of the East, the Vermilion Heaven of the South, the White Heaven of the West, and the Black Heaven of the North, the Four Great Heavenly Kings each assemble, and immortals descend to the place. Reciting five times, the Five Emperors attend the perfected.

Reciting five times corresponds to the Five Phases, so the Emperors of the Five Directions each lead their perfected ones to attend in audience, as if to guard the hun and serve the po. Reciting six times subdues the demon kings. Six is the number of Great Yin, for the demon kings of the Six Heavens are the qi of the Six Heavens. Their power is equal to that of Heaven; when the Primordial Beginning spreads transformation, these demons arise together. They test the practitioner, first through minor demons, then through greater ones. Only after passing these trials is one protected and recommended to ascend to the ranks of immortality. Now, at six recitations—the culmination of the Six Yin numbers—demonic might is at its peak, yet with the merit of six recitations, one is sufficient to subdue it, compelling the demons to restrain their bodies and heads, daring not to rashly intrude. Such merit is supreme.

Reciting seven times halts the stellar passes. Seven recitations correspond to the Seven Stars, symbolizing the seven orifices of man. Here, "halting the passes" aligns with the *Scripture of Salvation*'s meaning of "momentarily halting the wheel." Reciting eight times illuminates the darkest night. Eight is the number of Lesser Yin; the darkest night is the domain of Yin. Yet now, riding the yang qi, it becomes luminous. Reciting nine times draws the descent of all heavens, and every spirit without exception guards the chamber. With the merit of nine recitations complete, the response is spontaneous and inevitable. Since all heavens are born of the qi of the Nine Heavens, and no spirit exists outside this qi, none fail to gather and come to guard.

Reciting once pierces Heaven, and the primordial womb is opened and permeated. The Three Powers share a single principle, inherently interconnected. Thus, one recitation corresponds to the Primordial One, hence "pierces Heaven," and the primordial womb is thereby opened and permeated. Moreover, Heaven One generates Water, which in man is essence. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: "In the first month, it is the womb, where essence and blood congeal." This arises from the qi of the Primordial Yellow Evolution, serving as the origin of life. If this qi ascends and descends without losing its measure, the principle of life flourishes.

Reciting twice resounds in the earth, and the root of the fetal knot is untied. Two recitations correspond to the Two Modes, hence the earlier passage speaks of both Heaven and Earth showing reverence. Sound issues forth and responds; Yang intones and Yin harmonizes. Heaven One and Earth Two follow this order. With two recitations resounding in the earth, the fetal knot is thereby untied at its root, for the fetal root is tied to the earth. Now, Earth Two generates Fire, which in man is spirit. When form takes shape, spirit has a dwelling. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: "In the second month, it is the embryo, where form begins to take shape." Yet once the embryo takes shape, there is an old root that binds it. One must obtain the qi of the Dark and Mysterious Purple Door to nourish it, severing the root and cutting off the Gate of Death, fostering and nurturing the infant, thereby untying the fetal knot.

Reciting thrice elicits divine reverence, and the Gate of the Hun is refined into immortality. "Refined" is interchangeable with "tempered"; the ancient characters are used interchangeably hereafter. Three recitations correspond to the Three Powers. Now, Heaven Three generates Wood, which in man is the hun. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: "In the third month, the yang spirit becomes the Three Hun, moving to generate life." One must obtain the qi of the Everlasting Numinous Bright Immortal to govern the Three Clouds, thereby refining the Gate of the Hun into immortality.

Reciting four times brings the descent of Heavenly Kings and immortals, and the Gate of the Po is sealed. Four recitations correspond to the Four Symbols, aligning with the Four Heavens above. Now, Earth Four generates Metal, which in man is the po. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: "In the fourth month, the yin spirit becomes the Seven Po, quietly stabilizing form." One must obtain the qi of the Vast Corpse Dark Evolution to nourish it, so that the Divine Duke gathers the wandering qi and refines the White Flower. The so-called "sealing the gate" means closing the gate of dead qi to block external evil and preserve the qi of life.

Reciting five times brings the Five Emperors to attend the perfected, and the viscera are cleansed and frozen. Five recitations correspond to the Five Phases; the Five Emperors are the rulers of the qi of the Five Directions. Now, Heaven Five generates Earth. In the fifth month of human life, the Five Viscera become distinct. The number of the Spleen-Earth is fulfilled, manifesting internally as the viscera and externally as flesh. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: "In the fifth month, the Five Phases divide the Five Viscera to settle the spirit." Thus, only when the Five Viscera are fully formed do the Five Emperors attend the perfected. These are the qi of the numinous among the Five Immortals, refining the primordial viscera, thereby generating immortals in the Purple Door. The bowels are the counterparts of the Five Viscera, serving as receptacles. For example, the small intestine is the bowel of the heart, the large intestine of the lungs, the gallbladder of the liver, the stomach of the spleen, the bladder of the kidneys, and the Triple Burner is the bowel of the Gate of Life.

Reciting six times subdues the demon kings to obedience, and the stomach duct generates fluid. Six recitations correspond to the Six Pitch Pipes. At this stage of practice, one can control the demons of the Six Yin, so the demon kings of the Six Heavens all submit in reverence to the heart and comply in speech. Now, six is the completion number of Water, hence it is spoken of in terms of fluid. The *Scripture of Inner Observation* states: "In the sixth month, the Six Pitch Pipes settle the Six Bowels to nourish the numinous." One must obtain the qi of the Lofty Perfected’s Harmonious Fusion to nourish it, thereby severing the womb-tree, stagnating the heart, and soaring to the Upper Capital. Moreover, there are six bowels on the right, yet only the stomach is mentioned. The stomach belongs to Earth, the master of the Five Phases, and can encompass them all. In terms of the four seasons, Earth flourishes for eighteen days each season; in terms of the Five Phases, nothing is completed without Earth. If one pairs the viscera and bowels with the Ten Heavenly Stems, then: Jia and Yi correspond to Wood, the liver and gallbladder; Bing and Ding to Fire, the heart and small intestine; Wu and Ji to Earth, the spleen and stomach; Geng and Xin to Metal, the lungs and large intestine; Ren and Gui to Water, the kidneys and bladder. Thus, the stomach’s position corresponds precisely to six. Water is halted by Earth, so the stomach is the receptacle of fluid.

Reciting seven times brightens the stellar lodges, and the orifices become keen and clear. Seven recitations correspond to the Seven Stars, which in man are the seven orifices. Seven is the completion number of Fire, and Fire illuminates things, hence it corresponds to the light of the stellar lodges.

The *Neiguan Jing* states: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Seven Stars open the seven orifices, illuminating with radiant light." This occurs when one receives the primordial qi of the cavernous grottoes of the lofty immortals to nourish and open them. As the chapter says, "Seven recitations open the layered barriers."

Eight recitations reveal light in the darkest night, perfecting the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, fully integrating form and spirit. Eight recitations correspond to the Eight Trigrams, which in man are the Eight Sceneries. Eight is the completion number of Wood. The nature of Wood is compassion and benevolence, its position aligned with the East, emerging from the land of Zhen, governing the generative qi of Yang brightness. All things arise from it, embodying the image of light in the darkest night. Thus, in human life, one begins with a single qi as the ancestor, dividing the Three Origins within the Three Divisions and Three Fields. Each Origin possesses Eight Sceneries, together forming the Twenty-Four Perfected. Therefore, the Eight Sceneries of the Upper Division are ruled by Niwan; the Eight Sceneries of the Middle Division are governed by the Crimson Palace; and the Eight Sceneries of the Lower Division are ruled by Guanyuan. The *Neiguan Jing* states: "In the eighth month, the Eight Sceneries of the spirit are complete, descending true numinosity." This is due to the nourishment of the qi of true numinosity in transformation and congealment, thus form and spirit are fully integrated, allowing one to ascend and wander without end or decay.

According to the *Qiqian*’s "Method of Unbinding Knots" and the *Huiyuan Jing*, the Eight Sceneries of the Upper Division are as follows: the Brain Spirit, Awakened Origin Child, styled Daodu; the Hair Spirit, Mysterious Patterned Splendor, styled Daoheng; the Skin Spirit, Penetrating Multitude Second, styled Daolian; the Eye Spirit, Void Overseer of Life, styled Daotong; the Crown Marrow Spirit, Numinous Model Cover, styled Daozhou; the Spinal Spirit, Beneficial Calendar Assistant, styled Daozhu; the Nose Spirit, Rushing Jade Dragon, styled Daowei; the Tongue Spirit, Originating Beam Peak, styled Daoqi.

The Eight Sceneries of the Middle Division are as follows: the Throat Spirit, Hundred Streams Released, styled Daotong; the Lung Spirit, Plain Numinous Life, styled Daoping; the Heart Spirit, Radiant Yang Prosperity, styled Daoming; the Liver Spirit, Opening Lord Child, styled Daoqing; the Gallbladder Spirit, Dragon Virtue Restrainer, styled Daofang; the Left Kidney Spirit, Spring Origin Perfected, styled Daoqing; the Right Kidney Spirit, Image of Earth’s Vastness, styled Daosheng; the Spleen Spirit, Treasure Origin Complete, styled Daoqian.

The Eight Sceneries of the Lower Division are as follows: the Stomach Spirit, Alike Vermilion Nurturer (or "Alike Arriving Nurturer"), styled Daozhanzhong; the Intestinal Spirit, Auspicious Calf Health, styled Daohuanda; the Small Intestine Spirit, Abundant Delivery Keeper, styled Daochu; the Torso Spirit, Receiving Offering Vigorous, styled Daoling; the Chest Diaphragm Spirit, Vast Crystal Residence, styled Daozhong; the Two Knees Spirit, Splitting False Horse, styled Daocheng; the Spirit of the Left Yin and Right Yang Center, Supporting Flow Rise, styled Daogui; the Spirit of the Right Yin and Left Yang Center, Embracing Bright Manifestation, styled Daosheng.

Nine recitations cause the myriad heavens to descend, opening the Three Passes, Five Viscera, Six Bowels, Nine Palaces, Golden Towers, Jade Chambers, Twelve Layered Gates, Purple Portals, Jade Enclosures, and the thirty-six thousand joints. From the root origin and fundamental beginning, all generate spirit simultaneously. The preceding chapter describes the gradual merits of practicing the Dao in accordance with the method. Nine recitations correspond to the Nine Heavens, thus the myriad heavens descend to align with man’s Nine Palaces. Nine is the completion number of Metal. When things reach completion, they become firm and steadfast, belonging to Metal. The four seasons also regard autumn as the time of completion. The *Neiguan Jing* states: "In the ninth month, palaces and chambers are arrayed to stabilize essence." Only when virtue and function are fully prepared is its heaven named the Heaven of No Thought, No Entanglement, No Attachment, and its qi called the qi of Natural Mysterious Illumination.

The Three Passes are the Upper Jade Capital Pass, the Middle Double Passes of the Spine, and the Lower Tailgate Pass. The Five Viscera are the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. The Six Bowels are: the large intestine as the Court of the Minister of State, the small intestine as the Court of Primordial Yang, the gallbladder as the Court of the Orchid Terrace, the bladder as the Court of Supreme Harmony, the stomach as the Court of Supreme Simplicity, and the Triple Burner as the Court of the Boundless.

The Nine Palaces are: three *fen* between the eyebrows as the Palace of the Double Fields; one *cun* inward as the Palace of the Bright Hall; three *cun* inward as the Palace of the Cinnabar Field, also called the Palace of the Muddy Pellet; four *cun* inward as the Palace of the Flowing Pearl; five *cun* inward as the Palace of the Imperial Unity; one *cun* above the Bright Hall as the Palace of the Celestial Court; one *cun* above the Cavern Chamber as the Palace of the Ultimate Perfected; one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field as the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar; and one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl as the Palace of the Supreme Sovereign. The Five Viscera also possess Nine Palaces.

The Golden Tower is the Tower of Layers. The Jade Chamber is another name for the brain. The Twelve Layered Gates are described in the *Huangting Jing*: "Within the layers are twelve-ringed towers and gates." The commentary states: "The twelve layers of the throat." The Purple Portal is mentioned in the *Suwen Linglan Middle Chapter*: "Above the two eyebrows, within lies the Purple Portal." The Jade Enclosure is called the Jade Hall in the *Huangting Jing*, also known as the Jade Enclosure.

The phrase "thirty-six thousand joints, from the root origin and fundamental beginning, all generate spirit simultaneously" means that while the physical form gradually takes shape, only the spirit is without limit. When the body’s qi is sufficient, the spirit is complete, not arising in stages, hence it is said that all generate spirit at once. The *Jiudan Jingzhong Ji* states: "There are eighteen thousand heavenly spirits and eighteen thousand bodily spirits, totaling thirty-six thousand spirits. When spirit and qi are fully possessed, they are thus generated."

The correspondences of the nine recitations not only reveal the principles of human life but also the path for scholars to nurture the sacred embryo—its Dao is one. Nine recitations form one cycle. Upon completing one cycle, one’s name is proclaimed across the Three Realms, the Five Emperors become companions, and one is titled a Perfected Person. Ten cycles unify qi, allowing control over the myriad spirits. Demon kings offer protection, and one is ranked among the heavens. A hundred cycles unify spirit, enabling one to sit and attain the natural state. The Taiyi bestows talismans, and the Primordial Lord receives life. A thousand cycles unify numinosity, allowing one to sit or stand at will, vanishing or appearing. Immortal youths and jade maidens serve at one’s command. Ten thousand cycles complete the Dao, enabling one to ride a dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight. The preceding chapter outlines the graded effects, ultimately leading to the supreme fruit. One chapter constitutes one recitation; nine recitations fully generate spirit, forming one cycle of qi transformation, naturally and spontaneously.

When one recitation completes its full circuit, the Three Realms record one’s name, the Five Emperors acknowledge one as companion, and one is called a Perfected Person. As the *Three Caverns Pearl Bag* states: “When the Heavenly Perfected descend, they bestow the great scriptures. The Way of the Upper Immortals is to recite and study them, thereby becoming a Perfected Person.” “Companion” means to be ranked as a peer of the Five Emperors; “acknowledgment” means to have one’s graded rank established. Ten recitations multiply merit tenfold, enabling one to control the myriad spirits. A hundred recitations unify spirit, allowing one to sit and attain the natural state. The Taiyi bestows talismans, and the Primordial Lord receives life—such merit is even more refined, hence one can spontaneously attain the natural state. Examples include the Six Jia spirits manifesting traveling kitchens; the Taiyi transmits the Five Talismans, and the Primordial Lord receives one’s life register.

A thousand recitations unify numinosity, allowing one to sit or stand at will, vanishing or appearing. That jade maidens and immortal youths serve at one’s command is illustrated by the Supreme Four Poles Perfected, who say: “The Six Qi circulate through the ten directions; the Six Jia traverse the hidden and obscure. Concealing transformation without limit, they ascend to replenish the Heavenly Perfected. Soaring through the void, riding the light, jade maidens hold towels, the myriad spirits offer protection, and the Perfected enter their chambers.” In sum, practicing the Way of the Upper Perfected grants one three thousand jade boys and jade maidens each, with phoenix songs leading the way and dark chimes following behind.

Ten thousand recitations complete the Dao, enabling one to ride a dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight. The *Feminine Unity Jade Tablet* states: “Then the Five Elders flank the chariot, the Eight Winds fan its wings, divine lightning leads the way, jade blossoms support the wheels, and one mounts clouds to ride dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.” Thus the *Yellow Court Scripture* also says: “Robes of feathers arrayed, the Eight Winds drive them; controlling the Three Primes, they ride the morning clouds.”

Some dismiss the responsive power of these sacred texts as remote or impractical, even mocking and deriding them. Yet the merit of recitation is clearly expounded in the scriptures. Though reciters are as numerous as ox hairs, those who attain the fruit are as rare as unicorn horns. This is truly lamentable. As the *Dao De Jing* states: “Abstruse, obscure—within it lies essence. Its essence is most true; within it lies sincerity. When sincerity is insufficient, there is disbelief.” What is called “essence” pervades heaven as heaven, pervades earth as earth, pervades humans as humans, pervades things as things. Heaven and earth, humans and things, sages and Perfected, ghosts and spirits—all share this same essence. How much more so for the human body, which models heaven and earth, encompasses the myriad things, and is most noble and numinous? Thus its resonance is most easily achieved.

In ancient times, loyal ministers and filial children moved heaven and earth, stirred ghosts and spirits—such accounts fill the historical records beyond counting. Their responses arose from the utmost sincerity in a single moment. How much more so for one who observes a thousand-day fast, severs worldly affairs, exhausts all defilements, calms the mind, and silently recites, pure in their heavenly nature? Alas, among those who practice with ease, I have yet to see one; among those who practice for gain, not one in ten thousand; among those who practice with effort, not two or three in a thousand. Moreover, some waver between doubt and faith, their thoughts and concerns scattered, their likes and dislikes preying upon them, their desires drowning them, worldly affairs burdening them. What remains of their own effort? How can they blame the scriptures for lack of efficacy?

In antiquity, many attained immortality through recitation and cultivation, such as Wei Zixu, Li Shunxing, and Sima Ziwei. Though today’s students of the scriptures may not yet sever ties with the world, if they can harden their resolve like metal or stone, turn from the dust to unite with the Real, and recite with utmost sincerity over time without cease, they will undoubtedly ascend to the ranks of immortals. Yet if faith is insufficient, disbelief will arise. Strive on! Strive on!

Here begins the division into six chapters, from "Those Who Study the Supreme Dao" to this point.

*Exegesis of the Scripture of the Natural Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, Volume One* (concluded)
*Exegesis of the Scripture of the Natural Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, Volume Two*

Composed by Dong Sijing of Guishan, Daoist of Qingyuan Tianqing Abbey

At a time of stillness, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided in leisure within the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, amidst curtains of the seven treasures. Cultivating simplicity, he harmonized with the void and refined his true nature, savoring the profound wisdom of the Caverns and delving into the generation of the spirit. His principle was subtle, merging with the Great Primordial, and his resonant chant illumined the Nine Heavens.

The preceding chapter spoke of the provisional establishment of time and place, revealing the demeanor. This scripture, however, begins directly from the origin of the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth, and thus no preface is set forth. For the Primordial Beginning is the very essence of the natural, and this chapter is the natural qi congealing into a natural composition, forming a natural sound—not derived from expounded discourse. Yet without a preface, how would this scripture have been transmitted? Therefore, only now is the cause of the teaching’s emergence recounted, to instruct later learners.

Though the heart of the Supreme Sage in aiding beings knows no moment of cessation, it must await resonance before responding. Thus, in stillness and repose, he finds contentment. When the spirit-kings petition, he responds without concealment.

From "At a time of stillness" to "amidst curtains of the seven treasures" describes the provisional establishment of time and place, preserving his essence. What follows manifests function through essence.

*Xi* means harmony; *yi* means equilibrium. *Cultivating simplicity* is to embrace the pure and unadorned Dao. *Void* is like the Great Emptiness; *azure* signifies the mystery. Thus, he roams his mind in the void and unites his qi with the profound, refining his true nature. *Savoring the profound wisdom of the Caverns* is to relish the essence of the Dao. *Delving into the generation of the spirit* is to study and chant the chapters on the generation of the spirit. *His principle was subtle, merging with the Great Primordial* means that his principle admits no form or sound, hence its subtlety. Yet within the utmost non-being, all virtues are complete, merging into a singular unity—thus the Great Primordial. *His resonant chant illumined the Nine Heavens* means his harmonious voice flowed through the Nine Heavens, proclaiming its concord to Heaven and Earth and extending to the myriad beings.

At that time, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit-King, the Jade Assistants and Supreme Stewards, and the Four Harmonious Attendants of the Dawn, having purified themselves and raised their standards, stood in attendance. Leaning upon their jade-like visages, they sensed the marvel; gazing upon his divine eyes, they opened their robes. They secretly rejoiced in the spirit-chapters, feasted upon the celestial sounds, and, seizing the moment of awakening, dared to expose their hearts beneath his numinous gaze.

The preceding chapter spoke of the spirit-king responding to the moment, preparing to present his question. The *Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit-King* refers to the Ten Directions’ Flying Celestial Spirit-Kings as recorded in the *Scripture of Salvation*. They are called *Flying Celestials* for their unhindered movement; *Great Sages* for their embodiment of all virtues without attachment. *Boundless* is the utmost honorific, while *Spirit-King* denotes their sovereign authority. The *Jade Assistants and Supreme Stewards* are the Four Celestial Emperors of the Golden Towers, known as the assisting ministers. Those who decree and proclaim are called *Stewards*. The *Four Harmonious Attendants of the Dawn* (alternatively, *of the Imperial Chamber*) resemble the worldly positions of chief ministers, left and right assistants. *Harmonious* signifies accord. These are all titles of the Primordial Beginning’s most intimate ministers.

When they humbly prepared to pose their question, it is called *purifying themselves*. The *standards* are the emblems held by the spirit-kings to summon the host of spirits. From *leaning upon their jade-like visages* to *exposing their hearts beneath his numinous gaze*, the spirit-kings, standing in attendance, were moved by the Celestial Worthy’s chanting and study. Their hearts leapt with joy, and seizing the moment of resonance, they awakened to the karmic convergence of this blessed encounter. Gazing upon his divine eyes, they bared their long-held aspirations—this was the moment the spirit-kings purified themselves to advance.

Thereupon, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit-King, stepped forward, bowed deeply, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: "This humble servant, by fortunate convergence, has been permitted to attend your numinous presence. Not spurning my meager and narrow capacities, you have drawn me from the dark ford, granted me profound awakening to the congealed mystery, and elevated me to the rank of spirit-king. I oversee the registers of life and death, govern the ranks of celestial immortals, supervise the Seven Awakenings, survey distant realms, harmoniously observe the Supreme Stewards, and serve alongside the Attendants of the Dawn."

The preceding chapter spoke of arranging his demeanor to pose the question. This passage records the spirit-king’s address before the Celestial Worthy. He declares that, despite his limited talents and virtues, he was not abandoned but cleansed in the ford of the mystery, suddenly awakening to the profound and doubly subtle Dao, attaining the position of spirit-king. He oversees the records of life and death and governs the offices of celestial immortals. As for *supervising the Seven Awakenings*, this refers to examining the conduct of those who study immortality. The *Seven Awakenings*, according to the *True Scripture of the Eight Simplicities of the Supreme*, are: the arising of knowing from the spirit of consciousness (1), knowing that leads to perception (2), perception that leads to following (3), following that leads to practice (4), practice that leads to firmness (5), firmness that leads to accomplishment (6), and accomplishment without attachment (7). The Seven Awakenings proceed in seven stages from a single awakening, their depth varying in sequence—this is their meaning. *Surveying distant realms* means his wisdom illuminates all things. *Harmoniously observing the Supreme Stewards* and *serving alongside the Attendants of the Dawn* refer to the aforementioned Jade Assistants and Supreme Stewards and the Four Harmonious Attendants. *Harmonious* means accord, as when two people gaze upon each other with kindred hearts—sharing aspirations and delighting in one another’s presence. *Serving alongside* means sharing office and rank. At that time, the assisting ministers, united in virtue, each bore a heart of compassion for the kalpic fortunes, aspiring to broadly propagate the Dao and benevolently save beings. Thus, the spirit-king undertook this petition.

The term *shangjian* (賞監) appears in another version as *zhangjian* (掌監). At this time, one must seize the moment and respond to the conjunction, treading the Nine Supreme Yang, penetrating the principles of the Yin Talismans, and guiding the multitudes with a gentle hand. The great cycle nears its end, the reckoning concludes in the *jiashen* year, and the deluge scours away filth as calamities blanket the heavens. The Three Bureaus wield their brushes to assess and distinguish the lineages of humanity, tallying merits and transgressions—good and evil must be separated.

The preceding memorial spoke of seizing the hour to arouse compassion and proclaim the mandate to deliver the good. As the spirit-king holds a position among the close ministers, an opportunity for petition arises; moreover, the moment of culmination approaches. Thus, he must seize this moment and respond to this conjunction, taking the propagation of the Dao and the salvation of beings as his own duty.

*Treading* means encountering. *Nine* is the extreme of Yang. *Supreme Yang*: As the *Sutra of the True Dharma* states, when the celestial revolution completes nine thousand nine hundred cycles, Yang is eclipsed; when the earth rotates nine thousand three hundred degrees, Yin surges. When Yang reaches its extreme, qi is exhausted in the Supreme Yin; when Yin surges, qi culminates in the Supreme Yang. Thus, when Yin declines, eclipses occur; when Yang is provoked, surges arise—this is called the Great Kalpa. When the Great Kalpa converges, heaven and earth overturn, rivers and seas overflow, humans drown and mountains sink, gold and jade dissolve, the Six Directions merge into darkness, white corpses drift boundlessly, and solitary souls lament upon the floodwaves. It further states: The Five Thearchs assess good and evil, and at this time, all wickedness is eradicated, demonic traces vanish, and across the Eight Wastes and Four Poles, not one in ten thousand remains. Without the intercession of the Three Highest Heavens, none can avert this; without the Azure Register and White Tallies, none can escape.

*Treading the Nine Supreme Yang* thus means encountering the qi of this Supreme Yang, exhausted in the Supreme Yin—this is the time of the Yang eclipse. *Penetrating the principles of the Yin Talismans* means *penetrating* as in thorough comprehension, and *talismans* as the Yin registers; it refers to fully grasping the principles of the Yin reckonings and guiding the multitudes with a gentle hand.

*The great cycle nears its end, the reckoning concludes in the jiashen year*: This marks the convergence of the kalpic conjunction, approaching its appointed time. According to the *Sutra of the True Dharma*, after the Tang era, forty-six *dinghai* years pass, and the years between—including *jiashen*—constitute the conjunction of the Lesser Kalpa. Furthermore, as the *Sutra of the Immeasurable Realms of the Three Caverns’ Highest Clarity* states: The reckoning of the Nine Yang spans one thousand eight hundred years, and when it coincides with *jia*, it becomes the Great Nine Yang. The reckoning of the Sixteen Yin spans one thousand six hundred years, and when it coincides with *shen*, it becomes the Great Sixteen Yin. If the Nine Yang does not coincide with *jia*, or the Sixteen Yin does not coincide with *shen*, no disaster arises. Thus, *jiashen* marks the conjunction of calamitous kalpas. For when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin is born—hence the great flood. This is what is meant by *the deluge scours away filth, calamities blanket the heavens*.

*The Three Bureaus wield their brushes to assess and distinguish the lineages of humanity, tallying merits and transgressions—good and evil must be separated*: This accords with the *Sutra of the True Dharma*. From the Crimson Brightness era to the first year of the Highest Thearch, according to the Jade Treasury of Primordial Yang, those who receive deliverance—*should* (平聲, here meaning *ought to*). The same applies below.

Two hundred forty thousand persons.

According to the *Seven Lots’* “Kalpa and Destiny” chapter: the Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder, during the *Kaihuang* era, calculated the celestial origin, reviewed and reckoned the kalpic destiny, and on white tallies and azure registers recorded the names of those who had attained the Dao, compiling the *Imperial Register of the People*. The reckoning culminated in the reign of Tang Yao, marking the juncture of a minor kalpa, wherein the tally of gains and losses amounted to two hundred forty thousand—these being the ones who had attained the Dao.

The Primordial Yang is the office of the Purple Tenuity; the Jade Treasury is the coffer that holds the names of those who receive deliverance. From the *Kaihuang* era onward, when the count reaches *jiashen*, the heavens conduct their selection in sequence, the offices of the immortals lie vacant, and the ranks of the bureaucracy remain unfilled. Those in *yousan* posts—positions akin to supernumerary appointments—along with all other offices, are to be filled by select candidates.

Following the five kalpas’ sequence in correspondence with the Five Phases, the *Kaihuang* era pertains to Water. Thus, from the *Kaihuang* era onward, when the count reaches *jiashen*, it coincides with the period of *the deluge scouring away filth*. According to the Primordial Yang’s jade calendar, during the Three Eras, those who have cultivated goodness with sincerity, accumulated merit, and been commended by the Three Realms and protected by the Five Emperors—whose names are recorded in the heavens—shall be selected to the number of one hundred thousand to fill these offices. An additional one hundred twenty thousand shall be chosen separately to serve as reserve officials.

The preceding section clarifies the selection of candidates from the Three Eras to assume immortal offices. The *jade calendar* is the text that records the kalpic destiny and the offices of the immortals. The *Guishan Primordial Record* states: the Heavenly Worthy condensed the qi of the Primordial Grotto to form the *jade calendar*. The *Heavenly Script Sutra of Salvation*’s “Primordial Grotto Jade Calendar” chapter states: the Primordial Heavenly Worthy commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to inscribe with the jade calendar the inception of the Primordial Grotto’s undifferentiated transformation, the origin of kalpic cycles’ ebb and flow, the demarcations of the various heavens, and the condensation of the Primordial Grotto’s true Yang qi into the jade calendar, thereby recording the path of the Heavenly Perfected and Heavenly People’s kalpic merit, accumulation, ascent, and decline, and elucidating the nine grades of the nine sages.

The Three Eras refer to the period from the Crimson Brightness era through the first year of the Highest Thearch and onward from the *Kaihuang* era. *Reserve* denotes deputy officials. In such cases, selection may proceed by:

- **Inscription in the Mysterious Register**: The *Three Primes Jade Inspection Sutra* states: only when the Mysterious Register is displayed in the Upper Hall and the Five Talismans are ordered within the Womb Venerable may one’s name be recorded in the Mysterious Register. The *Mysterious Register* is the register of the Mysterious Capital. *Inscription by former name* refers to the engraving of one’s name prior to birth.

- **Alignment of bone and form with immortal likeness**: For instance, the Celestial Master of Orthodox Unity bore green eyes with arched brows, a high nose and square jaw, eyes with three corners, a rhinoceros horn traversing the brain, a jade pillow peak rising, and arms extending past the knees. Similarly, Wei Huacun possessed five viscera crisscrossed with purple networks and a phoenix’s bones with a dragon’s bearing.

- **Transmigration through karmic conditions**: When the ranks of immortals are not yet filled and the kalpa’s destiny calls for dissolution, one sheds the physical form and departs, attaining rebirth by the day’s reckoning. *Karma* refers to the deeds one has performed; *conditions* refer to the circumstances one encounters. Thus, through karmic conditions, one cycles through rebirth to realize fruition, as the *Jade Sutra of the Nine Auroras’ Flight in the Upper Clarity* states: the Northern Culmen Star, Heaven’s Grand Constancy, presides over advancement and governs the bodies of learners below. All who diligently cultivate merit and attain the Dao ascend through the ranks of cyclic transformation under its aegis.

- **Devotion to the Three Treasures, with virtuous deeds piercing the heavens**: The Three Treasures comprise three aspects.

The present scripture divides the Heavenly Treasure, Numinous Treasure, and Divine Treasure into the Three Qi of Mysterious Origin—Primordial, Originating, and Commencing—which descend into humans as the Three Fields: essence, qi, and spirit. These are the Inner Three Treasures. The teachings comprise the Dao Treasure, Scripture Treasure, and Master Treasure. The Three Treasures are the Three Exalted Ones of the Supreme. The Scripture Treasure consists of the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries of true scriptures. The Master Treasure encompasses the perfected saints of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, as well as the Three Masters of ordination, transmission, and scriptural instruction. These are the Outer Three Treasures, all of which the cultivator of the Dao must devote themselves to with utmost sincerity.

Moreover, the *Scripture of the Inner Secret True Treasury* states: when one’s nature is quiescent and extinguished, free from the dust of defilements, and precepts remain unbroken, this is called the Dharma Treasure. When wrathful nature does not arise, one is not enraged by external dust, and concentration is unshaken by birth and death, this is called the Master Treasure. When deluded nature grasps nothing, free from affliction and distress, and wisdom flows unimpeded, this is called the Dao Treasure. These Three Treasures are neither inner nor outer, neither sound nor form; to devote oneself to them is to treasure them profoundly and embody them utterly. Thus, the One True [nature] becomes limpid and still—no virtue is greater.

Some, by making offerings to the Master Treasure, are commended by the Three Officials. The *Luminous Writ of the Grand Empyrean* states: true immortals ascend to sagehood only through the guidance of a master. For humans are born ignorant, and without a master, they remain foolish in maturity. Thus, the realization of virtue and the Dao truly depends on transmission from a master. How could one fail to fulfill the fourfold offerings in full reverence, advancing with elbows and knees, hastening to the leeward to serve with diligence? If the learner truly exhausts the Way, they will surely be praised and rewarded by the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water.

Some, by performing purification rites and upholding precepts, accumulate merit and evoke resonance. "Purification" means unifying the mind; "precepts" means halting transgressions and restraining wrongdoing. "Performing" means ceaseless cultivation; "upholding" means unwavering adherence. "Merit" refers to diligent practice manifest in deeds; "virtue" refers to embodying the Dao and attaining it within oneself. The deeper the accumulation, the more one may move the numinous and commune with Heaven and Earth. As the *Baopuzi* states: without the accumulation of yin and yang influences, one cannot move the numinous.

Some, by dispersing wealth and treasures, establish Dao halls. This refers to founding temples to deliver others. According to the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Conditions*: the method of dispersing offerings has two benefits—inner thieves do not arise, and outer thieves do not appear. With inner and outer tranquility, all misfortunes vanish. Thus, the Dharma includes almsgiving to break miserly hearts, for the numinous power of the sages mysteriously responds, and one receives retribution according to their capacity. Yet this still pertains to the form of almsgiving. As for almsgiving without attachment to form, one perceives neither the self who gives, nor the object given, nor the recipient. The merit of such an act cannot be measured or limited.

Some, by aiding the destitute and delivering humans and celestials—those who share the same endowment from Heaven and are born as humans—rescue them from peril, avert calamities, protect them from illness, and prevent unjust deaths, which is the highest merit. As the *Baopuzi* states: establishing merit is foremost, followed by eliminating transgressions. Thus, the superior person dwells in the world with great compassion, practicing impartial salvation as virtue. Accumulating such extraordinary causes, one ascends to excellent fruition.

Some, by establishing merit to fulfill the Three Masters, gain renown among the Heavenly Officials. The Three Masters are the Master of Ordination, the Master of Transmission, and the Master of Scriptural Instruction. Those who serve as the Three Masters of the world, propagating the wonders of the Dao and ceaselessly establishing merit until fulfillment, have their names recorded by the Heavenly Officials. The ledgers of reckoning and registers of the Three Officials correspond, all retroactively inscribing the names of the seed people with distinctions of rank, leaving no detail unrecorded.

The preceding section elucidates the realization of fruition according to causes and arranges the grades of virtue. The Shu commentary states: the Three Origins have Three Officials, divided into Nine Offices, totaling Twenty-Seven Bureaus and One Hundred Twenty Departments. The left governs the living with yang offices; the right governs the dead with yin offices. The left bureau’s green ledgers record the meritorious; the right bureau’s black ledgers record the guilty. If one’s transgressions are mingled with merit, or merit with transgressions, they are not confined to a single department. Thus, the investigation of facts involves triennial, novennial, or twenty-four-year reviews. Only when the merit officials and Three Bureaus align without discrepancy are the names submitted for retroactive inscription among the seed people.

Above the formless realm lie the Four Kinds of Celestial Seed People, a place untouched by great calamities. When Heaven and Earth are reborn, they become the seed of humanity—hence, "seed people." "Retroactive inscription" means recording them before their time has come. As the *Scripture of the Eight Simplicities* states: those who attain the Dao have their names retroactively inscribed in the Green Palace before their birth. The term "retroactive" follows the *Great Commentary on the Book of Changes*: "Those who know the future are retroactive."

Moreover, the Nine Dark Bureaus receive the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate from the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence, commanding them to extract the male and female souls of the dead from the Jade Caskets of the Nine Dark Prisons. Those whose past names bear goodness, whose merit and virtue are fulfilled, and who are destined for deliverance—thirty-two myriad of them—are chosen to replenish the people after the expulsion of the Jia-Shen era, becoming the people of the Great Prosperity. The preceding section elucidates the deliverance of past goodness to fill the people of Great Peace.

The Nine Dark Bureaus are governed by the Earth Official, where sinful souls are confined. That such selection extends even here reveals the boundlessness of supreme benevolence. The Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence is the domain of the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering of the Fusang Cavern Yang Palace. Due to the impending Jia-Shen cataclysm and the need for expulsion, the Azure Palace preemptively issues the Nine Dragon Mandate to open the prisons of the Nine Bureaus, selecting from the Jade Caskets those souls whose past names bear merit and virtue, lest they be swept away in the expulsion. Not only are they delivered to avoid expulsion, but they are also granted rebirth to become the people of the renewed kalpa, the future sage citizens of Great Peace. As the *Upper Scripture of the Purple Text* states: "Passing through the Three Calamities unharmed," and "One must witness rebirth in Great Peace."

At this moment, when the cycles of life and death converge and the destinies of good and evil are decided, how joyous it is for those who transcend this cataclysm. During this kalpic convergence, when all beings—whether of life or death, good or evil—are thus distinguished, is it not bliss to pass beyond this tribulation?

As the *Sutra of the True Dharma* states: "Those who attain its scripture, whose three qi are complete, traverse the hundred and six calamities unbound, tread the flood’s surging waves without sinking, take flight though featherless, and soar through the empty vault of heaven. They are received by the Sage Sovereign in the Palace of Supreme Clarity, where they undergo further refinement at the Essence of the Golden Gate—all in accord with this principle."

Yet the Three Bureaus press urgently, their records teeming in disarray. At Dragon Gate, the assembly convenes; the Avian Matriarch oversees the immortals. The myriad sages manifest their presence, ceaseless day and night, weighing merits and transgressions with impartiality, ensuring no bias in life or death. This tumultuous chaos is also my concern.

The preceding memorial clarifies the response to the assembly and the meticulous distinctions made, lest impartiality be lost.

The Three Bureaus are those of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Their "pressing urgency" refers to their mutual oversight. The "teeming records" describe the tangled mass of registers cross-examined to assess the ledgers of life and death, good and evil.

Dragon Gate, according to the *Classic of Waterways*, lies in Pidi County of Hedong, where the sources of all rivers converge. Thus, as the Jia-Shen deluge approaches, the water deities are first assembled here to fix the kalpic deadline, after which the floods are unleashed. At that time, all wickedness will be eradicated, demonic paths obliterated; across the eight wastes and four extremities, not one in ten thousand shall remain. Only the virtuous seed-people, spared from the flood, are swiftly borne aloft by the Avian Matriarch’s flying immortal chariots to the heights of Kunlun’s ruins.

The Avian Matriarch is the marshaling spirit of water. The *Sutra of the Five Elders’ Exorcism of the Great Kalpa* states: "The nine rivers face judgment; the deluge churns the streams. The Water Matriarch lingers, and avian steeds gather in multitudes."

As for the "myriad sages manifesting their presence," the *Sutra of the True Dharma* says: "The Sage Sovereign displays his presence in the Pavilion of Luminous Radiance, while the Five Elders scrutinize the registers of good and evil." Thus, they conduct their investigations and inspections without pause. Merit is rewarded, transgression is demoted—all striving for impartiality, lest the assessments of the various bureaus err, even to the point of bias in life and death.

This tumultuous chaos is also my concern: though those below are examined by some and those above are overseen by others, I still fear that the good may not be duly recognized, the evil not justly condemned, or that the public Way may suffer some deficiency.

Herein lies the profound concern of the Divine King—such caution is indeed most prudent. The great epoch presses near, and in every matter, negligence and decay prevail. Ever—*heng*, meaning "constantly"—I fear that one day, we may incur the censure of the public tribunal. For the cataclysmic kalpa’s term draws nigh, yet the affairs of the immortal courts and their attendants remain mired in omission and decline. I dread the moment we face reproach for our failures before the celestial judgment.

I have heard that the Heavenly Worthy, in establishing the transformation of great compassion, extends mercy to all living beings, unlocking the profound mysteries of the Nine Heavens to deliver the myriad people. The luminous statutes contain prohibitions—matters not for a humble servant such as myself to presume to inquire. Yet the grand reckoning approaches its term, with the *jiashen* year nearing its close; the celestial cycles hasten, and the great Dharma ought to be enacted. May those of sincere intent, even amidst the reckonings of merit and transgression, hear the resonance of the Dharma’s sound, receive enlightenment through sight and hearing, and be exhorted to awaken those yet unawakened.

For this reason, I dare to present this petition above, trembling lest I offend the celestial countenance. I humbly beseech your compassion and the bestowal of what I have not yet heard. This memorial lays bare my heart and assumes the burden of supplication, entreating the essential Dharma. *Zao*—meaning "to establish"—refers to the Heavenly Worthy’s enactment of the transformation of great compassion, with the intent to extend mercy to all living beings by revealing the secret mysteries of the Nine Heavens to deliver the myriad people. The Divine King, desiring to request the precious scripture, first presents this entreaty to the Heavenly Worthy.

The luminous statutes contain prohibitions—namely, the precept that the Dharma is enacted but once in forty thousand kalpas, and the warning against reckless disclosure. Such strictures are not for a humble servant like myself to presume to hear. Yet with the epoch of calamity pressing close, the Heavenly Worthy, in compassion for all beings, cannot bear to withhold the great Dharma—hence the *Scripture of the Divine Vitality*. It is fitting that this scripture be brought forth into the world. Those of sincere intent—those devoted to the Dao who have not yet heard the great Dharma—may, amidst the Three Offices’ reckoning of good and evil, hear the resonance of the Dharma, receive enlightenment through sight and hearing, and be exhorted to awaken those yet unawakened. Thus may they endure the great deluge and become the seed-people.

Having thus enlightened their sight and hearing, and exhorted those yet unawakened, how deep is the Divine King’s concern for the world! Truly, the search of the two immortals for worthy ones surpasses even the longing of mortals for immortality. I humbly beseech your compassion, that the Heavenly Worthy may take pity on my earnest devotion and bestow the Dharma I have not yet heard.

Upon close examination of the beginning and end, it becomes clear that the Divine King oversees life and death, governs the realms of heaven and immortality, supervises the Seven Awakenings, and surveys the distant lands. It is further said: "At this moment, you shall seize the opportunity to respond to the celestial convergence, tread the Nine Great Solar Realms, penetrate the principles of the *Yin Talisman*, and extend your embrace to the myriad people." Thus, the duty of the immortal courts to deliver the seed-people falls entirely upon the Divine King. Yet in this world, the good are few and the wicked many; the offices of the immortal courts remain unfulfilled, and the number of seed-people falls short—all of which weigh heavily upon the Divine King. Therefore, he prostrates himself, advances boldly, and dares to transgress the prohibitions in his entreaty. Is this not because he deems the peril his own responsibility and takes upon himself the burden of this Dao alone?

From the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s moment of tranquil repose to this point, the text is divided into nine chapters.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, resting his hand upon the table, raised his countenance high, concentrated his spirit in distant contemplation, intoned the scriptures of the Cavernous Heavens, and chanted the resonant tones of jade-like purity. After a long while, he suddenly sighed and declared: "The supreme model is boundless and empty; its principles are subtle and profoundly obscure. The Dao penetrates the double mystery; its *qi* crowns the Divine Empyrean. Its ultimate extremity is difficult to express in words; its wondrousness is difficult to surpass."

This memorial clarifies the Heavenly Worthy’s response to the moment, praising the Dao before bestowing it. *Resting his hand upon the table, raising his countenance high, concentrating his spirit in distant contemplation*—these describe the Heavenly Worthy’s demeanor as he prepares to answer. *Intoning the scriptures of the Cavernous Heavens* refers to his raising his head to recite the jade scriptures of the empty void. *Chanting the resonant tones of jade-like purity* describes his harmonious and unobstructed expression, giving voice to sounds as clear and melodious as fine jade. After savoring these words for a long while, he further lamented that the loftiness and subtlety of the Dao and its methods cannot be fully captured in a single utterance. He also wished for his listeners to grasp the essence beyond mere sounds and forms, not to be misled by the superficial teachings of language.

*Supreme model boundless and empty*—*fan* means "model" or "standard." This scripture serves as the supreme standard, yet its fundamental nature is tranquil, empty, and vast, beyond all containment, as the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity* states: "The majestic and boundless standard, whose virtue is beyond measure." *Its principles are subtle and profoundly obscure* refers to the scripture’s principles, so refined and hidden that they transcend all comparison. *The Dao penetrates the double mystery* means that this Dao comprehends the profound depths of the double mystery, untethered from either existence or non-existence. *Its qi crowns the Divine Empyrean*—among the Nine Empyreans, the Divine Empyrean stands foremost, and the *qi* of this jade scripture surpasses even it.

This passage elucidates the scripture’s inherent excellence in both principle and *qi*, their perfect fusion, the completeness of its essence and function, and its transcendence of both speech and silence, rendering it beyond all form, instrument, sound, or scent. Herein lies its principle—utterly central, utterly correct, utterly wondrous, utterly profound—beyond any further augmentation. Thus, he praises it, saying: "Its ultimate extremity is difficult to express in words; its wondrousness is difficult to surpass."

"You, who hold the imperial throne and bear the office of Divine King, extend your celestial wings within the jasper towers, while the Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel. Your gaze surveys the farthest reaches, governing the boundless; you harmonize the myriad transformations and oversee the reckoning of all living beings."

From this passage onward, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy offers encouragement, clarifies the Divine King’s duties, and imparts admonitions. *Imperial throne*—this refers to the Four Celestial Emperors of the Golden Towers, known as the assisting ministers. Though you hold the office of Divine King, your rank is that of an emperor. *Extend your celestial wings within the jasper towers*—this describes the Divine King soaring through the void, lending his wings to assist the jasper towers. As the commentary to the *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* states: "The jasper towers are the abode of the Supreme Subtlety, the jade palaces of the Celestial Emperors." *The Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel*—these are the Jade Assistant, the Four Harmonious Attendants, and the Celestial Throne, all of whom jointly assist the luminous wheel, for at this moment, they are all present among those making the entreaty.

The *Luminous Wheel*, according to the commentary of the *Great Cavern Jade Scripture*, is the vehicle upon which the Four Venerable Perfected of the August Supreme constantly ride—thus, the Luminous Wheel is the jade chariot. *"Gazing afar, surveying the boundless"* describes the comprehensive governance of life and death, the oversight of celestial immortals and earthly transcendents, requiring distant observation of remote realms to ensure nothing is overlooked. It also entails regulating the myriad transformations, harmonizing them to their proper state, comforting and nurturing the mortal multitudes, and discerning their good and evil with precision, leaving no margin for error. These are all the duties of the Divine King.

The *Luminous Wheel*, as recorded in the *Precious Register of the Three Realms* from the *Seven Lots*, is the *Xuanji* wheel formed by aligning the nine qi upon Kunlun Mountain. Now, as the great kalpic cycle commences, the *Three and Five* announce the appointed time; the *Hundred and Six* respond to the mechanism, the *Yang Nine* surge forth, the vast springs churn waves, and ten thousand calamities assail the heavens. The Four Palaces conduct selections to replenish the *Seed People*; the Three Dynasties fall into chaos, and good and evil must be distinguished. You must labor diligently for the myriad masses, exhausting yourself in service to the Three Bureaus. At this juncture of rise and fall, affairs demand the fullest exercise of your abilities. Now, I entrust this to you—strive with all your might.

The *Three and Five*, as stated in the *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Precepts and Prohibitions*, refer to the Three Primes and the Five Marchmounts, who, together with all divine spirits, assemble in the Three Prime Palaces to fast and review the ledgers of karmic conditions and past-life roots for the heavens, earth, and the myriad masses, which are then presented to the various heavens. This also signifies the appointed time of the kalpic convergence. The *Scripture of the True Dharma* further states: "When the great kalpa ends, the reckoning of the Nine Heavens is exhausted; when the destiny of the Six Heavens is spent, qi surges through the *Three and Five*." The multiplication of Three and Five yields fifteen, which corresponds to the numbers Nine and Six—Nine being yang, Six being yin. Hence, below it speaks of the *Yang Nine* and *Hundred Six*.

*"Announcing the appointed time"* refers to the moment of ultimate culmination. If we follow the present text, the explanation of the Three Primes and Five Marchmounts is consistent; if we cross-reference other scriptures, the theory of Nine and Six is more accurate. The Shu commentary states: "According to the calculation of the *Great Expansion* numbers, nineteen years form a *zhang*, four *zhang* form a *jie*, twenty *jie* form a *ji*, and three *ji* form a *yuan*. Each *yuan* spans four thousand five hundred and sixty years; when the reckoning of three *yuan* is complete, it constitutes one kalpa." Furthermore, the *Brush Records of the Primordial Dawn Dao Lord* state: "The celestial *yuan* operates through five kalpas. The *Primordial Cavern* illuminates the ancestral qi, the *Jade Calendar* records the celestial *yuan*, and after five kalpic cycles, all returns to unity." The so-called five kalpas correspond to the Five Phases: *Longhan* to Wood, *Chiming* to Fire, *Shanghuang* to Earth, *Yankang* to Metal, and *Kaihuang* to Water. Here, *"the great kalpic cycle commences, the Three and Five announce the appointed time"* signifies that the great kalpa has begun its fixed period, and the numbers of the Three Primes and Five Phases have all reached their culmination at this moment. The *Upper Scripture of the Phoenix Terrace and Pure Silk* states: "The great kalpa has a final destiny; when destinies intersect, the two images collapse. The Dragon Gate severs the Celestial River, and the Three and Five turn against one another."

*"The Hundred and Six respond to the mechanism, the Yang Nine surge forth, the vast springs churn waves, and ten thousand calamities assail the heavens"*—according to the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Revolutions of Heaven and Earth*: "The celestial tribulation is called *Yang Nine*, and the terrestrial tribulation is called *Hundred and Six*." The *Scripture of the True Dharma* states: "When yin is exhausted, it eclipses; when yang is stimulated, it erupts. When yin and yang eclipse and erupt, heaven and earth transform." Thus, the *Hundred and Six* responds to the extreme of yin, while the *Yang Nine* marks the exhaustion of yang. When they respond to the mechanism and surge forth, the vast springs churn waves, and ten thousand calamities shake the heavens.

*"The Four Palaces conduct selections to replenish the Seed People"*—the Four Palaces include such places as the *Square Cauldron* and *Azure Florescence*. The Shu commentary states: "For men, there are the *Youthful Beginning* and *Leisurely Retreat*; for women, there are the *Easy Transition* and *Embracing Perfection*—these are the Four Palaces." The *True Statutes* also record these names. As they are the bureaus for selecting immortals, it is fitting that they choose individuals to fill the ranks of the *Seed People* of heaven. However, the records of the Three Dynasties are muddled, with good and evil intermingled, still obscured and unclarified, disordered and unrectified. At this time, the ledgers of good and evil must be distinctly separated to ensure not even the slightest error remains.

Thus, the admonitions are repeated thrice to the Divine King, emphasizing the gravity of the matter. You must devote yourself diligently to the myriad masses, and your toil must exceed even that of the Three Bureaus, for the greater the responsibility, the greater the labor of the heart. *"At this juncture of rise and fall, affairs demand the fullest exercise of your abilities"*—when the kalpa is destroyed and renewed, the stakes are immense. You must exert every ounce of your ability, for even the slightest inclination toward self-indulgence will prevent you from fulfilling your duties, amounting to self-deception. Now, I entrust this to you—strive with all your might. These are the words of exhortation from the Most August.

The sacred scripture is of wondrous weight, the numinous voice of the Nine Heavens, bestowed upon the perfected sages—beyond the hearing of ghosts and spirits. The standards of luminous perfection are met but once in forty thousand kalpas. Now, in transgression of the prohibitions, I entrust it to you; guard it in secrecy, and take utmost care not to transmit it lightly. The preceding section is the Heavenly Worthy’s praise and exhortation, urging diligence and caution in its concealment.

*The Great Golden Writ of the Three Treasures* is of the most subtle principle and the gravest prohibitions. It is the resonant sound formed by the convergence of the soaring mystery-qi in three assemblies, played upon by the divine winds of the Nine Heavens—its voice arising naturally, hence called the "numinous voice." It is bestowed only upon the perfected sages, beyond the hearing of ghosts and spirits. Moreover, the standards of luminous perfection have not yet reached their appointed time, thus it is said to be entrusted in transgression of the prohibitions. It is fitting to adjure you to guard its secrecy and not transmit it lightly. Yet "not to transmit lightly" does not mean to conceal it entirely, but rather to transmit it only to the virtuous.

Here, the Heavenly Worthy, resting his hand upon the table, divides the text into two sections, which form the preface. He commands the Nine Heavens’ Marshal, the Jade Gentleman Attendant of the Immortals, to open the purple-flamed jade case and the cloud-brocade satchel, and bring forth *The Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of the Divine*. The Four Assistants take their places, the Five Elders oversee the perfected, the Great One of the Central Yellow commands the hour, and the Jade Emperor intones the oath. All proceed in accordance with the rites of luminous perfection, as recorded in the canonical texts. Facing south in reverent prostration, the scripture is entrusted to the Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King.

The preceding section recounts the issuing of the command and the transmission of the scripture, with all the perfected ones arrayed in proper ritual. When the ritual is complete, the hosts of heaven return to their stations. The section above describes the conclusion of the scripture’s transmission, the gathering of the ritual implements, and the return to stillness.

The Nine Heavens’ Marshal is Bo Chengxu Qin Sheng. The Jade Gentleman Attendant of the Immortals is the official in charge of the scriptures, and the Purple Yang is the repository of the sacred texts. The jade case is a bamboo container made of jade, while the cloud-brocade satchel is the bag in which the scripture is kept. The Four Assistants take their places, determining rank and station. The Five Elders who oversee the perfected are the Primordial Elder of the Jade Clarity’s Vast Ultimate, the Origin Elder of the Numinous Radiance of the Empty Sovereign, the True Elder of the Mystic Flower’s Treasure Heaven, the Ancestral Elder of the Vast Numinous, and the Immortal Elder of the Vast Capital—together they supervise the assembly of the perfected. The Great One of the Central Yellow commands the hour for the reception of the scripture. As stated in the *Middle Grade of the Nine Perfected’s Luminous Regulations*: "One must not unseal the sacred writ without first making an oath." Thus, the Most High Jade Emperor intones the oath for the reception of the scripture. The solemn protocols and forms for the transmission of scriptures are all recorded in the canonical texts of luminous perfection, and today all proceed in accordance with those standards. As noted in the Shu commentary: "The standards of the Three Primordials’ offices, with their postures of reverence, total two thousand four hundred items." Facing south refers to the master facing south while the disciple faces north. The long prostration signifies reverence in the transmission. When the ritual for the transmission of the scripture is complete, the hosts of heaven return to their stations.

From "He commands the Nine Heavens’ Marshal" onward, the text is divided into two sections, forming the circulation portion. The Heavenly Worthy again addresses the Flying Heavenly Divine King: "These chapters of the Nine Heavens are the resonant sound formed by the convergence of the soaring mystery-qi of the Three Caverns in three assemblies, weaving together the true writ and uniting the hundred spirits, concealing the inner names within their hidden rhymes. Thus, the Great One examines and observes, gathering the life-qi of the ten directions, guiding them to comprehend the Cavernous Void, and only then initiates the oath in cinnabar and azure. Here, the Heavenly Worthy reiterates the preceding meaning to the Divine King, explaining the scripture’s profound secrecy. Thus, he constantly commands the Great One to examine and observe in the human realm, and only after passing the test does he initiate the oath and transmit it. The character *shi* (試) may also be read as *jie* (戒觀). However, the *Scripture of the Golden Mystery’s Feathered Chapters* also states: 'All receive the charts from the Five Elders, and the Great One examines and observes.' Moreover, the *Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity* states: 'The Divine Lord encompasses the hosts of heaven and examines the ten directions.' Thus, *shi* (試) is the correct reading. 'Gathering the life-qi of the ten directions and guiding them to comprehend the Cavernous Void' means to assemble the life-qi of the ten directions, enabling those of sincere heart to spiritually comprehend and realize the Dao of the Cavernous Void, at which point the scripture may be transmitted. *Cavernous* signifies thorough penetration, while *Void* signifies vast clarity—referring to the numinous penetration and vast clarity of the Dao’s essence, the convergence of all wonders. The Great One is the ancestor of the myriad spirits and holds the office of examination and observation—such is the nature of the Dao.

Thus, when the heart is empty and the realm is empty, when principle is still and affairs are still, when one is capable of emptiness and stillness, all principles converge, and the subtlety of transmission and reception reaches its utmost. Therefore, in ancient times, the transmission of scriptures required the prior observance of purification rites—both master and disciple purified themselves, hence called 'mutual purification.' This is the reason. If it were otherwise, one would listen to the Dharma with a mind bound by conditions, and the Dharma would also be conditioned, leaving no path to awakening and entry. Only after this is the oath initiated in cinnabar and azure. *Initiating the oath* means making a covenant. *Cinnabar and azure* refer to the practices recorded in the various regulations, such as drinking cinnabar water in place of blood oaths and severing azure threads in place of cutting hair.

Without the karmic affinity of countless kalpas, without one’s name preordained in the imperial charts, one cannot even glimpse its pages, and nine generations ascend together as immortals. One must carefully select those destined to become immortals, who, within seven hundred years, observe a thousand days of pure purification, purify their hearts with golden silks and oaths, and transmit in accordance with the covenant. Guard it well, and blessings will be bestowed; leak it, and calamity will befall."

Guard it well, and blessings shall extend to nine generations, with virtue as weighty as mountains and seas. Leak it, and retribution shall flow through countless kalpas, more agonizing than scalding poison, with wind and blade meting out punishment—how could one not be cautious?

This jade scripture, once obtained, ensures transcendence of the mortal world. Thus, without the karmic affinity of countless kalpas and one’s name inscribed in the celestial registers, one cannot even glimpse it. Those who do behold it shall see nine generations ascend together as immortals.

As the *Dongxuan Dayou Miaojing* records, the Azure Lad states: "Those with golden bones and jade marrow, whose names are listed in the Azure Palace, upon receiving this text and practicing it in secret, shall attain merit equal to the perfected. They shall redeem sins, extricate themselves from calamities, dissolve karmic knots of old, and bring joy to the nine ancestral lineages. Their own bodies shall ascend and feast in the Jade Capital."

One must carefully select those destined to become immortals, who, within seven hundred years, observe a thousand days of pure purification, purify their hearts with golden silks and oaths, and transmit in accordance with the covenant. This further admonishes the divine kings to choose such individuals, follow such regulations, and only then transmit this scripture.

The circulation of great teachings is the fundamental intent of the exalted sages. The reason for emphasizing these prohibitions is solely to guard against those who would recklessly leak or profane them. As the former perfected ones declared: *"Do not transmit the secret Dao to the unworthy; to transmit celestial treasures to the undeserving is to profane them."* It is not that the Dao itself is to be kept secret, but rather that those worthy of it are rare. Thus, the *Taiqiao Langshu* states: *"Transmit to the worthy without restriction to fixed numbers."*

What, then, is meant by the "karmic affinity of countless kalpas"? It refers to those described in the scriptures as deeply devoted to the Three Treasures. Such virtuous conduct ensures one’s name is entered into the celestial registers, marking the threshold for receiving the scripture. The "seven hundred years" denotes the time limit for transmission. One must also observe a thousand days of pure purification and present gold and silk as tokens of sincerity before transmitting it. As the *Taishang Suling Dayou Yupian* states: *"Within seven hundred years, if such a person exists, transmission may occur up to three times."*

The regulations specify: offer three taels of gold, a hundred feet of purple silk, twenty-seven feet of azure silk, five taels of silk threads, a catty of agarwood, and a tael of cinnabar. Present these to the master to perform the purification ritual, swearing an oath before the Nine Origins, the Northern Emperor, the Supreme Numinous, and the Ten Thousand Perfected of the Jade Bureau. This serves as the covenant of trust, vowing to treasure and practice the sacred text in secret, never to leak it or reveal it to the divine. To violate this covenant and transgress the regulations would bring calamity upon nine generations—such is the intent.

---
From the Three Treasures to the restoration of all heavens, this section is divided into six parts comprising twenty-eight chapters. Here, the Heavenly Worthy reiterates the importance of secrecy in this final chapter.

*Dongxuan Lingbao Ziran Jiutian Shengshen Zhangjing Jieyi*, Scroll Two (concluded)
*Dongxuan Lingbao Ziran Jiutian Shengshen Zhangjing Jieyi*, Scroll Three

Composed by Dong Sijing of Gui Shan, Daoist of Qingyuan Tianqing Abbey

**First Chapter: The Nine Heavens of Yudan Wu Liang Tian**

These nine chapters are texts of natural revelation:
1. Expounding the primordial origins of heaven, earth, and the transformation of beings.
2. Revealing the affairs of cultivating truth and practicing the Dao.
3. Narrating the discernment of good and evil, and the causes of kalpic renewal.

In essence, they collectively discuss the essentials of generating spirit and body, attaining perfection, and realizing sagehood.

The *Dazang Shu* states: "Yudan is the sound of the Great Brahma. The beings in this heaven attain fruition and establish their positions, their merit boundless—hence the heaven is named thus."

The *Taiji Jinshu Mizhi* states: "The qi of this heaven is the essence-spirit that opens the Yang, presiding over the inner spirits of the Upper Realms within the Mud Pill Palace. The imperial true qi of the primordial womb-life is the primordial yellow-evolving qi."

"Imperial" denotes its sovereign authority; "true" signifies its purity and lack of admixture. The *Dadong Santian Jun Lieji* states: "The imperial true is named *Shi Ming Jing*, styled *Yuan Yang Chang*. The nine qi divide and transform, all following the command of the imperial true. Thus, all nine chapters take the imperial true as their foundation, corresponding in the human body to the Yellow Court below the Gate of Life."

The primordial king governs the qi of life, serving as the root of human existence. "Womb" refers to the spirit of the Great Void that governs the primordial qi, condensing to form the womb, born of true earth. As the ancients said: "At one month of gestation, it is called the womb. When the Qian Dao forms a male, yin envelops yang; when the Kun Dao forms a female, yang envelops yin—such is the meaning of the womb."

"Life" is the flowing mandate of heaven bestowed upon all things. "Primordial" is the root from which all things derive their beginning and sustenance. "Primordial yellow-evolving" is the name of this qi. Most texts omit the character *yuan* (primordial), but the Shu and Zhedong editions include it—this version follows them.

"Primordial" denotes the initial movement of heavenly principle; "one" signifies the first division of the wondrous qi. "Yellow" embodies the meaning of pure tranquility and harmony; "evolving" conveys the sense of flowing, pervading, and communicating. This imperial true of heaven governs this qi, serving as the primordial source of the human womb and life.

The human Gate of Life resides at the border of the Yellow Court, thus its qi is yellow-evolving, and its spirit is *Tao Kang*. At the inception of human life, all receive this qi. The Sima of the Nine Heavens recites this chapter to resonate with the celestial womb. When scholars recite and practice it, their life-primordial remains unwaning, and their spirit is born anew.

Hereafter, the three heavens all arise from the primordial qi:
*"Amalgamating the vast and empty qi, soaring spirits float in the distant void.
The kalpa of Yan Kang stretches without end, distant and detached from the original branch.
Suffering souls sink through nine nights, awaiting dawn’s first light, yearning for the sun’s rays."*

The *Xiaomo Shouyi Pin* states: "The first is the Beginning of Non-Being; the second is the Primordial Cavern; the third is the Mysterious Void." These are the ancestral qi of the Three Origins, the root from which all beings arise. Now, when they amalgamate and condense at the Gate of Life, the soaring hun-spirits naturally ascend, rising into the depths of the dark and silent void.

Herein, *Yan Kang* is the name of a kalpa of destruction—boundless and silent, without reckonable limit. Once the soaring hun-spirits sink within it, they drift into vast and distant obscurity, severed from the branch of their original life. The "nine nights" are the depths of this darkness. Yet after long submersion, yang revives, and the heart of repentance and goodness arises spontaneously. Thus they long to ride the dawn’s light, yearning with uplifted spirit for the radiance of the sun.

The *Great Possession* opens the Gate of Mystery;
The *Yu Shan* descends in morning mist.
Yellow clouds congeal in the Mansion of Spirit;
Yin and yang qi-images intermingle.
The primordial womb coalesces into long life;
Evil roots transform and dissolve.

The *Great Possession* is the name of a Jade Clarity Palace. Though it soars beyond the realm of things, it is in truth the origin of all living beings. The *Gate of Mystery* is the passage through which the primordial womb first forms. For the qi of this heaven descends from the *Great Possession* and flows downward into the *Gate of Mystery*. Thereupon, the qi of *Yu Shan*—the domain of sun and moon in the *Divine Empyrean*—descends into the primordial womb. The "yellow clouds" are the yellow qi. As the *Scripture of Solar Essence* states: "Gather the yellow qi from *Yu Shan*." The place where the womb coalesces is the meeting-mansion of spirit and numen. When the qi of heaven descends, the qi of earth ascends; yin and yang wondrously unite, their qi-images harmonizing. Thus the yellow clouds congeal in the Mansion of Spirit.

Now, when Qian and Kun conjoin at the *Hai* position, the first yang gestates at *Ren-Zi*. The primordial womb begins to form, the life of the kidneys first takes shape, the omen of form gives rise to spirit, and good intention flourishes. The qi of life endures unbroken, and the evil roots of past karma fall away, transforming and dissolving. As for the method of cultivating the Real, the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: "The womb-sac of Jade Clarity; the embryo coalesces, opening into luminosity. The seven ancestors return to the womb; my life attains long existence." Here, the *Great Possession* is the Palace of Mud-Pill, and the *morning mist* is the scene of the Six Harmonies—between the two eyes. The *distant void* lies beneath the *Mysterious Darkness*, while *Yan Kang* corresponds to the hours of *Xu* and *Hai*. "Riding the dawn, yearning for yang" is the moment when the first yang begins to sprout.

The *Peach-Kang* unites essence and extends life;
The Two Emperors flourish like jade petals.
They irrigate the Gate of Life in the womb;
Essence refines the spirit, which does not wither.

The *Peach-Kang* is the Lord of the Peach, the Child Dao-Kang, the spirit of the Gate of Life. He is also called the *Root of the Womb* and bears the style *Uniter of Essence and Extension*. The *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* states: "The *Peach-Kang* governs the life that receives qi." Thus, at the moment of inception, he fashions the primordial womb; after a person is formed, he guards the region below the navel. The *Two Emperors* are the *Imperial Perfected* and the *Peach Lord*. "Flourishing like jade petals" means pure harmony and radiant purity. The *Cavern Scripture* says: "The branches of the jade forest grow in the Gate of Life"—this is the same idea. Thus, *jade petals* in the *Great Treasury Commentary* are rendered as *jade standards*. The Gate of Life is the place to which the root of the womb is tied. Since the principle of ceaseless generation originates here, the Two Emperors constantly circulate the water of life to irrigate its root, refining its essence and spirit, so that the primordial womb does not wither and dry. For the adept cultivating the Real, the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: "Irrigate and nourish the numinous root so it does not wither; seal the Gate of Life to preserve the jade."

The *Nine Heavens’ Mandate of Numinous Life*:
The spirit is born, and the spirit transcends itself.
The Primordial Lord blocks the path of death;
The Marshal recites the Cavern Chant.
One intonation, ten thousand Perfected respond;
Nine recitations, all heavens pay homage.
Bowing in reverence, they celebrate kalpas of years,
Rejoicing in the glory of the old sprout.

Here, as the intention of life flourishes, the Nine Heavens send down the *Mandate of Numinous Life* to generate the spirit, which then naturally transcends. The *Primordial Lord*—as the commentary states—is the *Three Primordial Lords of the Plain*. Once the primordial womb is formed, the Primordial Lord blocks the path of the qi of death. The *Marshal* is the *Grand Marshal of the Host of Immortals*. The *Cavern Chant* is the *Mandate of Numinous Life*. Since the Dao of Heaven values life, when the Marshal intones this once, the ten thousand Perfected all respond—such is the wonder of resonance. After nine recitations, all heavens descend to pay homage. Bowing in reverence, they praise the kalpas that have passed and celebrate the return of the peaceful era, rejoicing in the renewed glory of the old sprout. The root of nature is inherent in human beings; having endured through kalpas without destruction, it is reborn—hence the phrase "glory of the old sprout."

Some may doubt that this chapter, being the first, already contains the line "nine recitations, all heavens pay homage," while the second chapter, *Embryonic Origin*, only then speaks of "nine recitations completing the work of human formation," and that similar expressions appear in other chapters, suggesting a lapse in sequence. Yet they fail to realize that when the primordial qi first gathers and the intention of life begins to sprout, all four limbs and hundred parts are already contained within it—just as in plants, when the first leaves appear, the branches and leaves are already present, merely unfolding in due order. Thus, the qi of a single heaven necessarily undergoes the work of nine revolutions; within each chapter, the meaning encompasses both inception and completion. The number of recitations must also proceed through nine cycles for each chapter. The cultivator of the Real must not fail to recognize this.

**Second Chapter: The Numinous Life of the Heaven of Immeasurable Life in the Supreme-Supreme Meditation of Goodness**

The commentary states: "Supreme-Supreme" means the highest of the high. "Meditation of Goodness" is the great Brahma sound; on earth, it is called "Concentration of Goodness." The *Secret Script* says: "The qi of the soul’s essence and luminous yang governs the Perfected within the Hall of Light." The qi of the *Imperial Perfected of the Embryonic Life and the Mysterious Gate of Purple Darkness*—the *Imperial Perfected of Life* (its meaning was explained earlier). In the second month of human life, the embryonic form begins to take shape. "Mysterious" means "to penetrate"; this qi can penetrate the darkness and truly originates from the *Purple Gate*. The *Purple Gate* lies within the Nine Palaces of Heaven; in humans, it is one *cun* above the space between the eyebrows, three *fen* inward, on the right—called the *Purple Gate*. It resides in the Upper Origin and is truly the master of the embryonic root.

The Immeasurable coalesces in the Purple Gate;
The qi is honored as the King of Heaven.
It opens the passage for soaring numinous spirits,
Congealing and transforming the wheel of empty vastness.

Thus, the root departs from former attachments, and the thread returns to its original source. Through the dark night of distant kalpas, one exhausts the great cycles of destiny.

This speaks of the boundless celestial qi coalescing in the Purple Gate, serving as the primordial origin of human embryonic life. This qi’s spirit is most revered, honored as the King of Heaven. Once born, this qi rests in the Gate of Life, enduring ceaselessly—like a ruler in a kingdom, it truly governs the entire body.

Moreover, all movement and stillness, contraction and extension, arise from this single qi. Thus, when the passage opens for soaring numinous spirits to renew life, they congeal the wondrous essence of transformation, circulate the qi of empty vastness, and recreate the primordial embryo.

Yet attachment is the root of rebirth; it must first be wholly purified. Therefore, the old root is severed and extinguished, former attachments cast off. Tracing the thread to its origin, one yearns to restore the inherent source.

This is what is meant by *"Through the dark night of distant kalpas, one exhausts the great cycles of destiny."* From of old, one had sunk into the dark night of remote kalpas; now, at last, the burdens of attachment are dissolved, karmic debts fully repaid, and the Way of Life restored—encountering this great cycle of flourishing passage.

*"Distant kalpas"* refers to the *Yankang* kalpa. In terms of kalpas, *Yankang* is the kalpa of dissolution; in terms of days, it is night; in terms of humans, it is death.

The Imperial Perfected’s primordial luminous essence is named *Ziyuan Yang*. The Infant Elder, *Boshi Yuan*, binds the embryo and guards the Yellow Chamber. Sever the root, seal the Gate of Death, and nurture the infant with radiant countenance.

The *Records of the Three Heavenly Lords* state: Below the Gate of Life resides the Primordial Yellow Court King, the primordial luminous essence, named *Ziyuan Yangchang*, also called the *Elder Infant Embryo* or *Boshi Yuan*. It further states: The *Axle Gate* below the wheel is the portal of deathly qi. The Primordial Yellow Court King firmly guards it, causing the hundred bloods to congeal and the spirit-qi to remain undispersed, extracting one from the Earth Gate and transcending the Eight Difficulties.

The *Jade Record of the Great One* states: The Great One’s embryonic essence is the master of transformation, thus it can bind the embryo and form the body within the Yellow Chamber—the Yellow Chamber being where the embryonic form first appears. *Boshi Yuan* is sometimes mistakenly written as *Shibo Hua*, but this is incorrect. *Shibo Hua* is the *Crimson Child of Mysterious Congealed Heaven*, governing the *Mud Ball* (ninefold brain). Here, it speaks of binding the embryo and guarding the Yellow Chamber, which is not its domain.

Moreover, the Yellow Chamber is the pivot of yin and yang, the threshold of life and death, the mechanism of generation and destruction—its timing is finer than a hair’s breadth. In terms of position: below it lies the *Yellow Springs Winding Mansion*; ascending above it is the Way of Yang Brightness and generation; descending below it is the path of dark yin and death.

The *Scripture of Salvation* states: *"In the Northern Capital’s Yellow Springs Winding Mansion, myriad ghosts dwell, ever seeking to obstruct human destiny and sever the Gate of Life."* Without the Way of Generating Spirits to sever its evil roots and block its Gate of Death, how could one nurture the spirit-qi to a radiant countenance and rear the infant?

Cultivate goodness to guide the numinous qi, mystically nourish the soaring celestial fragrance. The flowery radiance flourishes with jade-like substance; through refinement, one’s form naturally takes shape. Strive for the mysterious to foster superior life, arraying all in readiness within the Hall of Light.

This *Cultivating Goodness Heavenly Emperor* further guides with wondrous qi, mystically nourishing the soaring celestial fragrance. *"Mystical nourishment"* refers to silent nurturing, like the *Great Cavern’s* feminine unity nourishing the hundred spirits. *"Soaring celestial fragrance"* is the qi of supreme harmony, the flower of the Dao.

Once the numinous qi is guided and mystical nourishment abounds, the spirit-light arises and the jade-like substance gradually flourishes; through long refinement, one’s countenance naturally forms—all these are the embryo’s spontaneous transformations.

The *Records* state: Within the embryo is the *Primordial White Qi Lord*, named *Wu Xuanzi*, styled *Foster Superior Life*. Descending from the *Mud Pill*, it spreads below the five viscera, thus harmonizing the multitude of spirits and arraying them within the Hall of Light.

Some say that at this stage, the embryonic life is only just formed, the body not yet complete—how can there be a Hall of Light? Yet they fail to realize that as soon as the primordial qi manifests, the principles of the hundred bones are already present. Why wait for sequential development? Moreover, this passage primarily expounds the purport of cultivating reality, generating spirits, and untying knots—how could it be limited to the events of initial birth?

The Great Void responds to the numinous convergence, commanding me to generate the *Chapter of Spirit Generation*. At the first recitation, the Nine Mysteries stir; at the second, Heaven and Earth commune. Harmonizing and blending of themselves, nine recitations complete the work of humanity. The Great Sage rejoices in primordial auspiciousness, scattering flowers in homage to the Great Void. All heavens delight in unison; every being bows in reverence.

The Great Void holds the numinous, its responses unfathomable. Once *Wu Xuan* and the host of spirits are arrayed within the Hall of Light, the myriad spirits of the Great Void naturally gather, and the *Chapter of Spirit Generation* is commanded.

*"Mystery"* is the color of Heaven. *"At the first recitation, the Nine Mysteries stir"*—with one recitation, the sound reaches the Nine Heavens. *"At the second, Heaven and Earth commune"*—with two recitations, Heaven and Earth are reverently aligned. As Heaven and Earth commune, yin and yang harmonize, interpenetrating to form unity—thus all things are born, and the Three Powers are complete. After nine recitations, the work of humanity is fully accomplished.

At this time, the Mandate of Heaven flows forth, bestowed upon all things. At their initial reception of life, they are imbued with the undifferentiated principle of Heaven—only goodness and auspiciousness remain. Thus, the Great Sages of all heavens celebrate its primordial auspiciousness, scattering flowers and offering rites in the Great Void, for they revere the Way of Life.

All phenomena arise from the Void, each responding according to its kind. Only humans can attain the utmost emptiness, whereupon the spirit becomes numinous and wondrous—this is what is meant by *"an empty chamber generates brightness, and the numinous comes of itself."* Scholars must realize this for themselves.

The *Third Commentary on the "Chapter of Spirit Generation" from the Extended Heavenly Mandate* states: *"Brahmā"* denotes lofty elevation; *"oversee"* means clear perception. *"Extended"* is the sound of the Great Brahmā.

The *Clarification of Meaning* further states: "To demonstrate lofty elevation, one must cultivate and extend the years."

The *Esoteric Script* says: "This is the celestial-soul essence, the primordial yang qi, governing the Upper Cinnabar Field and the true inner spirits of the lower regions. It is the *Imperial True-Soul Life-Origin, Ever-Numinous Radiant Immortal Qi*—the *Imperial True Life-Origin* (its meaning having been explained previously). The third month pertains to the soul, hence it is spoken of as the soul. *Ever-Numinous Radiant Immortal* is the name of this qi."

The *Commentary* explains: "This qi extends and lengthens, while the spirit becomes numinous. *Immortal* signifies yang brightness, hence it is called *Radiant Immortal*."

"Xu-yan encompasses the Three Clouds,
The Mysterious, Primordial, and Original Qi divide.
Vast and boundless, the Great Brahmā spreads,
Jade Capital, the Emerald Jade Honored One."

The Three Clouds are the Three Qi—azure, yellow, and white—known as the Three Essence Clouds. The Mysterious, Primordial, and Original Qi divide into the Nine Heavens: the first three heavens, beginning with Yü-tan, are born of the Original Qi; the next three, beginning with Tou-shu, are born of the Primordial Qi; and the last three, beginning with Fan-fu, are born of the Mysterious Qi. Xu-yan Heaven marks the end of the upper three heavens. Once the Original Qi is complete, the Primordial Qi descends from it, and all qi divide and flow downward—hence it is said, *"Xu-yan encompasses the Three Clouds, the Mysterious, Primordial, and Original Qi divide."* *Vast and boundless* describes the expansive grandeur. Once the Three Qi divide, each heaven establishes its own realm, and the myriad forms array themselves throughout the Great Void.

The Jade Capital Mountain is also called the Flowery Capital. *Emerald Jade* signifies the luminous hue of the generative qi. This mountain is the most revered among all heavens, the abode of the Supreme Qi of the Upper Origin. In humans, it corresponds to the Mud-Pill Palace.

"Luminous Brahmā soars with the Dark Radiance,
Opening and delivering the souls of the long night.
Wandering spirits hasten to their destined return,
Qi by qi, they revert to the original root."

When humans receive life, it fundamentally arises from Brahmā qi. *Luminous Brahmā* refers to the radiance of Brahmā qi. This qi originates from the *soaring Dark Radiance* and descends to open and deliver the souls of the long night. *Soaring Dark* refers to the *Three Caverns’ Soaring Dark Qi*, the source from which all spirits and qi derive their authority. Thus, it enables wandering soul-spirits to return to their destined place of birth, as if reverting to their ancestral homeland—hence it is called *return*. From this, qi by qi, they revert to the root, and the impulse of life flourishes. *Reverting to the original root* is akin to a withered plant reviving.

"The Supreme Emperor is titled Yang Hall,
His name is Eightfold Numinous Lord.
The Nine Passes wind through the Green Returning Path,
Fetal qi generates the Upper Origin.
Ascending Brahmā, he traverses the Register of Lives,
The Great One assists in extending the essence.
The Mud-Pill Palace spreads the imperial seat,
The Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries divide.
The soul is born, gathering the wandering qi,
Nine revolutions complete the immortal’s way."

The Supreme Emperor’s spirit-soul is named *Yang Hall Jade*, styled *Eightfold Numinous*. The Nine Passes soul is named *Green Returning Path*, styled *Absolute Darkness* (or *Green* may be written as *Record*). These spirits all govern the fetal qi within the Upper Origin Palace.

The Lord Emperor is named *Encountering Ascendant Brahmā*, styled *Treading Flourishing Numinous*, guarding the Purple Chamber within the inner palace and overseeing human lifespans. Thus, the *Great Cavern Emperor Lord’s Incantation* says: *"The Lord Emperor traverses the tally registers, the upright qi summons the myriad spirits."*

The Great One, the revered spirit, is named *Duty and Planning Gatherer*; the Peach Lord is styled *Uniting Essence and Extension*. The Peach Lord governs the life of the Original Qi, while the Great One precedes the One Qi—thus, at this stage, they interact to generate the soul.

The Ninefold Nine Palaces are all places where the Lord Emperor enters, rests, and resides. Once the imperial seat is spread within them, the spirits of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries naturally assume their respective palaces.

Spirit and qi are as mother and child; thus, the soul’s gathering of qi is like a mother summoning her child, who follows harmoniously. When the work reaches nine revolutions, the immortal way is accomplished.

"Resonant are the Nine Heavens’ sounds,
Jade chapters give birth to the myriad spirits.
Thrice recited, they array in proper positions,
Qi intermingles at the Eight Celestial Gates.
The Dark Pass bars the Gate of Death,
The numinous guards the source of fluids.
Responding to the meeting, the numinous reckoning is felt,
The Way illumines the hidden turning wheel.
Rejoicing in this infant’s shedding,
I bow my head to praise the Cavern Scripture."

This recitation intones the jade chapters of the Nine Heavens, resonant, harmonious, and pure. The marvelous workings of the Way lie solely in the transformative nurturing of the One Qi, yet it does not rely upon the One Qi alone.

The *Jade Chapter of Spirit Generation* is formed by wondrous qi. Spirit gathers qi, and qi retains spirit. Reciting this chapter causes qi to gather and spirit to find its dwelling—hence it is said to *give birth to the myriad spirits*.

The *Mysterious Scripture* states: *"The Three give birth to the myriad things."* Thus, reciting it thrice causes the myriad spirits to array in their positions.

The *Eight Celestial [Gates]*—the *Commentary* says: According to the *Scripture of Wondrous Perfection*, *chen, xu, chou, wei, zi, wu, mao, you* are called the Eight Celestial [Gates], corresponding to the Eight Trigrams and aligning with the gates of human and heavenly fortune and misfortune. The *Scripture of Salvation* says: *"Above, the Eight Gates open, the flying celestial dharma-wheel."* Applied to the body, this refers to the head palace. *Intermingling* signifies qi converging at the Eight Gates.

The *Dark Pass* is the Upper Cinnabar Field. The *True Instructions* say: *"Guard and close the Dark Pass, internally store the Nine Perfected. The Three Qi circulate the fluids, irrigating the Cinnabar Field."* All these express the same meaning. Once the Dark Pass is guarded, the Gate of Death is barred. *Numinous* refers to the spirit presiding within this pass. When the spirit is securely settled here, the Dark Spring naturally flows—hence it is the source of fluids.

At this time, the internal and the profound meet in resonance, the numinous reckoning is felt, and the great Way illumines the mechanism of the turning wheel. Thus, the numinous reckoning is subtly stilled—this is called *attaining the reckoning of the present life*.

Those who cultivate the truth and seek to perfect the sacred embryo, gradually severing the turning wheel, must prioritize the illumination of the Way.

According to the *Marvelous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Salvation, Eternally Severing the Turning Wheel*:
*"To escape birth and death, to avoid drifting and wandering, first one must be without mind. If there is no deluded mind, then the Three Actions are absent. Sentient beings, deluded and confused, take consciousness as mind, distinguishing being and non-being, calculating birth and death. Mind is fundamentally a deluded name, for it is named by delusion."*

The heart is but an illusory phantom; when awakened to knowing, it is fundamentally the primordial Dao—what relation has it to the affairs of the heart? To recognize the heart and cling to phenomena is to dwell in birth and death; if there is no deluded mind, one does not abide in birth and death, and thus severs the turning wheel forever. Even the great celestial immortals, lofty perfected ones, and divine emperors, by means of the non-deluded mind, attain the rank of sacred perfection and naturally achieve the Dao. In this way, the sacred embryo is completed and the immortal’s path is fulfilled. Hence, we celebrate the shedding of this infant’s form and praise the merit of this cavernous scripture.

**Chapter Four of the "Silent and All-Encompassing Heaven’s Scripture of Engendering the Spirit"**
The *Commentary* states: "Silent" means without sound. "All-Encompassing Art" is the sound of the Great Brahma. Moreover, *all-encompassing* signifies receptivity, and *art* signifies thoroughfare. In its essence, silent and quiescent unity in measure encompasses all without exception, and in principle, it can traverse all paths. To embody this Dao is to dwell in this heaven.

The *Scripture of the Esoteric Glyphs* states: This heaven’s *hun*-essence and *jing*-spirit belong to the *Tai Chang* qi, presiding over the inner spirits of the *Dongyang* Palace’s perfected ones. The imperial *po*-destiny’s primordial *Yangshi Mingyan You* qi—human beings form the *po* in the fourth month, hence it is spoken of in terms of *po*. *Yangshi Mingyan You* is the name of this qi.

The *Commentary* states: *Yang* is interchangeable with *dang* ("to shake"), meaning this qi can dispel the obscurity of the corpse-*po*. *Yan* means "to spread," and *you* means "to penetrate thoroughly." It refers to the ability to spread and subtly penetrate the gate of the *po*.

Generally, the names of heavens and qi are difficult to confine to their literal meanings. From this point onward, the three heavens all arise from the primordial qi.

The Silent and All-Encompassing Heaven stands alone beneath the Three Heavens of Great Purity and above the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm, serving as the origin of the formless and directly opposing Great Purity. After its primordial qi generates this heaven, it further divides and scatters its numinous radiance to give rise to the Four Heavens of the Formless Realm—hence it is said, "the numinous transforms and the four scenes divide." The realm of this heaven is a forest of seven treasures, with ten thousand strands of lush verdure arrayed amidst crimson clouds—all describing the scenery within this heaven.

The wandering *po* does not turn back; once departed, it merges with the hordes of demons. The Divine Duke gathers the wandering qi, refining its pristine radiance as it drifts. Here it is said that the *po* pertains to yin and delights in human death. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: "The *hun* desires to ascend to heaven; the *po* enters the springs." Thus, the Great Cavern possesses methods to restrain the *po*.

The *Commentary* states: The wandering *po* sinks and drowns, unable to turn back, because it has lost the Dao—hence, once departed, it becomes one with the demonic hordes and does not return. Thereupon, the Divine Duke gathers its scattered wandering qi, and the *po*-spirit is restrained, refining its pristine radiance. The Divine Duke is mentioned in the *Great Dao Scripture of Jade Purity*: "Within it dwells the Jade Perfected, named the Divine Duke."

The *po* is stored in the lungs, which pertain to metal; its color is white, and it governs qi. Thus, one refines its qi to engender radiance.

Flourishing and splendid, it anchors the kalpa’s term, riding the movement to align with the numinous chart. The "Scripture of Engendering the Spirit in the Cavernous Void" emits jade tones that soar beyond the nine clouds. One chant summons the assembly of ten thousand perfected; the soaring spirits unite to form a home.

All things flourish through a single qi. Now, having gathered and refined this qi, the root is firm and the branches luxuriant—its flourishing and splendor can equal the kalpa’s term of the numinous anchor. The *Annals of the Perfected*’s song by Lady Ziwei of Purple Tenuity states: "Feasting their gaze in the Palace of Broad Cold, the ten thousand kalpas grow ever more youthful." Only thus does one ride this movement and align with the mysterious chart, even to the point of shedding the embryo and transforming the spirit—all effects arising from this.

Yet without the jade scripture of engendering the spirit, how could such efficacy be achieved? Hence it is said: "The cavernous void’s scripture of engendering the spirit emits jade tones that soar beyond the nine clouds." This means its harmonious resonance ascends above the nine skies. The *nine clouds*, according to the *Commentary*, are the morning qi of the nine heavens. Here, the voice is in harmony, and heaven and earth respond—thus, with a single chant, the assembly of ten thousand perfected gathers, all naturally so. Therefore, it can cause the wandering soaring spirits to return and unite with the *hun*, dwelling securely in their place. *Home* refers to the place of residence.

The nine transformations complete the numinous radiance; luxuriant, it illumines the jade blossom. The All-Encompassing Art opens the Great Possession; one celebration bestows boundless blessings. The supreme sages turn their imperial chariots; the infant suddenly sings. Overwhelmed by the auspicious morning assembly, all bow their heads in reverence.

Moreover, the jade scripture is the ancestor of the nine qi. When a person is born, only when the nine qi are complete can they become fully human. The cultivator of truth, having accomplished the nine transformations, attains immortality. Thus, though these four chapters have already mentioned the nine transformations, it is because once the qi is initiated, its number must be fulfilled before success is achieved.

*Numinous radiance complete*: The *Commentary* states that *numinous radiance* refers to the eight numinous spirits, all fully present. *Luxuriant* describes a flourishing appearance; *illumines* means radiant. After nine transformations, the lung qi is fulfilled, luxuriantly blooming the jade blossom. The *jade blossom* is the essence of the lungs.

The Emperor of the All-Encompassing Art Heaven, lord of the lung-*po*, then opens the light of the Great Possession to descend upon humanity—for the Palace of Great Possession lies north of the Jade Capital, corresponding to the human mud-pill. *One celebration bestows boundless blessings* means that once the celebration of life’s completion is attained, one enjoys limitless fortune.

The great virtue of heaven and earth is called *life*; thus, the supreme sages of the heavens all turn their radiant chariots to descend and attend the infant, who suddenly sings—its voice complete and spirit perfected. Therefore, the nine heavens rejoice, overwhelmed with joy at the auspicious morning assembly, and all spirits bow their heads in reverence.

**Chapter Five of the "Pāramitā Joyous Heaven’s Scripture of Engendering the Spirit"**
The *Commentary* states: *Pāramitā* is the sound of the Great Brahma.

Here the sound becomes that which ferries across. *"Not Arrogant Joy"* means that the people of this heaven can ferry others across without arrogance and thus find joy. When the Dao fills one’s self and goodness extends to others, this is indeed joyous. Yet the heart of reckless arrogance easily arises—here, the heavenly principle and human desire are separated by no more than a hair’s breadth. Now, to find joy without arrogance is possible only through virtue as one’s guide. When one possesses such virtue, one crosses the Five Turbidities and enters this heaven.

The *Secret Script* states: The qi of this heaven is the *hun*-essence’s upper yang, governing the true inner spirits of the Crimson Palace. The five qi of the imperial true organs—*the life-mandate of the five immortals’ numinous center*—are complete by the fifth day of the fifth month, corresponding to the number of true earth and aligning with the central position. They encompass yin and yang, embrace the four images, and thus the five immortals’ numinous center is the life-mandate of the organs.

Fluttering, the five emperors’ chariots descend;
Drifting, they pass through the Gate of Mystery Above.
They wander the Yellow Flower Wilderness,
Turning spirits toward the summit of Joyous Pride.
Gathering the soaring scenes of empty space,
The old souls that once could not endure are no more.

*"Fluttering, drifting"* both describe the appearance of flight. The chariots of the five emperors of the five directions all drift down from the Gate of Mystery Above, wandering the land of Yellow Flower. The *Commentary* states: The *Gate of Mystery Above* is the gate of the Mystic Capital. The essence of Yellow Flower travels to the Eastern Well, and the region of the Eastern Well is called the Yellow Flower Wilderness. If one compares this to the human body, it corresponds to the spleen. Thus, the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: *"The numinous terrace is misty, gazing toward the Yellow Wilderness; three inches apart, the chambers have upper and lower."* When the spirit wanders here, it can turn all spirits toward the summit of the Joyous Pride Heaven. Moreover, it gathers from the soaring emptiness to seek those souls that once could not endure on their own, drawing them together to restore their original state. The following passages—*Great Tenuity’s Yellow Banner* and *Nameless Lord’s Numinous Feast*—serve to summon them.

The Great Tenuity turns the Yellow Banner;
The Nameless Lord commands the numinous feast.
They summon the Palace of Long Night,
Opening the crossing to receive the living souls.
The Duke assists Yellow Tranquility,
Recording in full both form and spirit.

The *Lesser Lad of Great Tenuity* is the thousand-scene essence, styled *Meeting the Primordial One*. Thus, the *Jade-Purity King’s Incantation* says: *"The Lesser Lad of Great Tenuity always stands before the Emperor; his name is Scene-Essence, his surname is Qian. He unites with the Great One in form, clad in vermilion cinnabar, bearing the five talismans and life-registers, holding the jade tablet."* As Great Tenuity presides over the five talismans, turning the Yellow Banner serves to summon all spirits. Yellow is the color of earth, and earth, dwelling at the center, overshadows the four directions—hence, *"turning the Yellow."*

The *Nameless Duke* is *Mysterious Primordial Uncle*, styled *Uniting the Talisman One*. The *Scripture of the Supreme Jade-Void Dao Lord* says: *"The Great One’s Mandate-Root, the Duke summons to unite the talisman."* The talisman is the five talismans. Great Tenuity presides over them, while the Nameless Lord summons and unites them, using the banner as the summons-flag to issue commands. With these, they summon the Palace of Long Night and open the crossing to receive the living souls. The *Duke* is the Nameless Lord. The *Three Perfected of Essence and Blood* are named *Primordial Life Lord*, styled *Yellow Numinous Mystery*. The Duke, as the spirit of the liver, governs blood, and thus assists the Three Perfected of Essence and Blood, recording in full the souls and restoring them to complete form and spirit.

For harmonizing the five qi at the center and blending the hundred spirits, what surpasses the qi of the central numen?

The jade scripture penetrates dark emptiness,
Five revolutions divide heaven and earth.
Qi refines the primordial organs,
Purple gates spontaneously birth immortals.
The count circles the assembly of all perfected,
Opening yang to respond to abundant resonance.
Jade maidens bathe with five fragrances,
The Holy Mother celebrates ten thousand years.
The Three Realms together rejoice,
Bowing their heads to worship the Heavenly Venerable.

The principle of the *Jade Scripture of Engendering the Spirit* penetrates dark emptiness. Thus, at the fifth revolution, the numbers of heaven and earth are divided. Before their division, all was undifferentiated unity; at the fifth revolution, heaven is one, earth two, heaven three, earth four, heaven five—the generating numbers of the five phases are complete. Human life must also reach this point before the five organs are complete and the numbers of *"three heavens and two earths"* are divided. Now, having refined the qi within the primordial organs, immortals spontaneously arise from the purple gates. *"The count circles the assembly of all perfected"* means that when the count completes nine revolutions, creation is fully accomplished, and all perfected inevitably gather. *"Opening yang to respond to abundant resonance"*—yang belongs to life and is of the same kind as brightness. *"Opening yang"* refers to the moment of birth, the beginning of illumination. At this time, the descent of heavenly spirits and earthly deities is beyond counting. Thus, the jade maidens bathe with five fragrances, and the Holy Mother celebrates the fortunate assembly of ten thousand years—this is the *Holy Mother of the Guarded Chamber*. When the Three Realms together rejoice and bow their heads to worship the Heavenly Venerable, this is returning the virtue of engendering and completing life to the Most High.

**Chapter Six of the "Scripture of Engendering the Spirit of the Dao-Transforming Resonant-Sound Heaven"**
The *Commentary* states: *"Penetrating"* means communication—it refers to the mutual communication of the Three Origins. *"Dao-Transforming Resonant-Sound"* means that the demons of this heaven transform and fly through empty space, responding to human desires by manifesting in various forms and producing various sounds to test practitioners. If one is not deluded by these trials, one is protected and recommended for liberation from the Three Realms.

The *Clarification of Meaning* says: It urges the cultivation of true precepts so one is not confused or disordered, and thus reveals that this heaven responds by proclaiming the five virtues.

The *Secret Script* states: The qi of this heaven is the *hun*-essence’s primordial yang, governing the true inner spirits of the lower cinnabar field. The five qi of the imperial true numinous palace—*the life-mandate of the soaring perfected’s harmonious fusion*—

The *Commentary* states: This is the gathering place of all perfected, hence *"numinous palace."* *"Soaring perfected"* refers to principle, *"harmonious fusion"* to qi. In terms of principle, it transcends the realm of form and image, purely real and without falsehood; in terms of qi, it is harmonious and fused, the resource from which the myriad things are born, and only then does its numen have a dwelling—thus, it is the life-mandate of the numinous palace.

The responsive realm transcends the Formless Heavens,
Its dawn-glow outshines the ten directions.
Its transformations return without shadow,
Its dark cycles hasten toward the Dao-precinct.

The numinous chariot needs no reins,
Luminous, it generates the divine scripture.

The *Shu Annotation* states: The Nine Heavens lie below the Three Purities yet above the Three Realms, and thus the Responsive-Sound Heaven stands above the Formless Heavens. Here, "responsive realm transcending the Formless Heavens" means this heaven has no form or appearance, nor any bounded realm—it is not the Formless Heaven of the Three Realms. Yet its dawn-glow illumines all heavens, surpassing the ten directions. "Shadow" refers to image; "wheel" to movement. Above it is said to be formless, here to be shadowless—thus utterly without trace or semblance.

Though this heaven alone crowns the ten directions, its imperial perfected celestials turn the great transformation within the shadowless, ever responding to the dark cycles of convergence to hasten toward the Dao-precinct. The Dao-precinct is where all perfected gather, where divided numina descend as qi to unite with all heavens in generating spirit. The word "hasten" follows the *Yi Jing*’s meaning of "adapting to the times." The numinous chariot needs no reins, luminous, it generates the divine scripture—if even form and shadow are absent, how could it require reins to be driven? Yet though no form is visible, the heaven’s divine scripture naturally resounds with luminous clarity.

The empty vastness truly has no bounds,
The dark clarity too is but a metaphor.
Refining the embryo returns to the primal origin,
Ever riding the flying dark beam.

To seek and nurture is to lose one’s celestial truth,
Scatter thought and await the constant tread of Heaven’s principle.
Sever the stagnation of the womb-tree,
Let the heart roam beyond the Upper Capital.

The "empty vastness" is qi—neither existent nor nonexistent, hence truly boundless. The *Commentary* states: "Boundless" means limitless; though this empty vastness of qi has no limit to be fathomed, the flying dark clarity draws strength from it—strength meaning the flourishing of vital intent. Thus one refines the embryonic origin to restore the primal beginning, ever riding the flying dark qi as a bridge to cross the gate of death.

The character *cheng* (乘), though often written as *guai* (乖) in common editions, follows the Zhedong version as *cheng* (乘). *Qi* (蕲) means to seek; *xu* (畜) to nurture; *hou* (侯) to await; *lü* (履) to tread. The Way of generating spirit takes naturalness as its essence—if one harbors intent to seek and nurture, one instead loses one’s celestial truth. Only by scattering thought and awaiting the spontaneous tread of Heaven’s constant principle can one sever the stagnation of the womb-tree and let the heart roam freely beyond the Upper Capital. "Heart roams" echoes the *Nanhua Jing*’s "heart has a celestial roaming"; the Upper Capital lies above the Jade Capital, signifying union with the Three Origins in virtue.

When the long-cherished meeting attains the profoundest mystery,
I awaken and forget both principle and self.
Auspicious blessings crown the Nine Heavens,
Exchange of rites harmonizes earth and stars.
Merging transformations return to the Primal One,
Loftily uniting with the Primordial King.
Bowing, I match the numinous course,
Forever parting from the clamor of dust.

"Long-cherished meeting" means the fulfillment of a past vow. "Attains" means to exhaust; "profoundest mystery" means mystery upon mystery. At this moment, one fulfills the past vow and exhausts the principle of double mystery. Only by fully grasping this profoundest mystery does true awakening occur—once awakened, one forgets both the self that awakens and the principle awakened to. Having attained this Way, Heaven and Earth unite in virtue and exchange reverence, hence "auspicious blessings crown the Nine Heavens, exchange of rites harmonizes earth and stars." Thus the wondrous transformations merge and return to the Primal One, uniting above with the Primordial King.

"Bowing, I match the numinous course"—the *Commentary* states: "Match" means to pair; "numinous course" refers to the dark cycles of spirit. Matching the numinous course unites one with Heaven, allowing one to roam beyond the Three Realms—how then could the clamor of dust ever burden one?

**Numinous Transformations of the Brahma-Assisting Heaven: Scripture on Generating Spirit, Chapter Seven**

The *Commentary* states: The celestials of this heaven transform through numinous spirit, assisting Brahma-qi to accomplish transformation. The *Secret Script* states: The qi of this heaven is the pure yang of the essence-soul, governing the inner spirits of the Upper Valley Palace. The imperial true numinous palace’s life-mandate—*the qi of the cavernous scripture of the soaring immortals*—

"Primordial" refers to the primordial spirit; the palace where the primordial spirit dwells is empty yet capacious, hence "cavernous scripture." When spirit and qi unite, cultivation can lead to becoming an upper immortal, thus "the qi of the cavernous scripture of the soaring immortals." The three heavens below all arise from the dark qi.

The dark convergence unites the boundless,
The blended qi returns to the Brahma-assisting realm.
Diligent in the workings of numinous transformation,
Silently propelling without cold or heat.
Riding the numbers to construct the steadfast stem,
Sleeves fluttering, brushing light feathers.

This heaven arises from the dark qi, hence the dark realm’s dark convergence unites what it governs—boundless and vast. The blended qi returns to the Brahma-assisting heaven. This speaks of returning to the root to honor the body, then deploying transformation to manifest function. Within its qi, a spirit serves as sovereign—this is the Supreme Unity, the honored spirit named *Diligent Workings*, who in the human body guards the posterior gate of the mud-pill palace as the root of generation and completion. It turns the qi of this numinous transformation heaven to accomplish wondrous creation, all the work of the Supreme Unity. Thus the qi of numinous transformation silently propels, free from the changes of cold and heat. "Cold and heat" follow the *Nanhua Jing*: "Its heat scorches like fire, its cold congeals like ice"—either extreme disrupts the harmony of vital intent. The holy embryo and the ordinary embryo share the same principle. Only by propelling without losing harmony can one ride the numbers to construct the steadfast stem. The "steadfast stem" resembles a root or branch—when qi gathers and spirit congeals, roots deepen and stems firm, inevitably yielding the effect of soaring aloft, hence "sleeves fluttering, brushing light feathers."

Within the jade chamber resounds a wondrous tone,
Where high spirits ascend and roam.
The celestial wheel turns without cease in its radiance,
As true immortals array themselves in ordered ranks.
Above, the empyrean’s azure thoroughfares stretch boundless;
Below, the primordial cavern’s depths span myriad leagues.
Lush leaves veil the jade haze,
Their shade resting upon the limpid isle.

The jade chamber lies above the nine heavens, as the *Zhen’gao* records the Supreme Void Primordial Sovereign: "The upper chamber of jade, flowing through the Jade Purity." The wondrous tone is the sound of spontaneity. This jade chamber is the realm where high spirits feast and wander—ascending as waters overflow, through long accumulation of effort, naturally attained, without the slightest imposition of human force. The "celestial wheel" refers to the sun and moon within heaven, their luminous brilliance ceaselessly intermingling, while true immortals stand in solemn ranks within.

Gazing upward, one beholds the empyrean’s lofty void and luminous heavens, their azure paths vast and distant; looking downward, the primordial cavern’s transformative resonance spans depths immeasurable. Amidst this scene, verdant leaves veil the sky like kingfisher mists, casting their shade upon the limpid isle. The *Eight Yang Songs of the Pure Radiance* states: "I soar with feathered canopy, lingering by the limpid isle." All describe the jade chamber’s vistas, embodying the marvel of upward and downward contemplation.

For the adept cultivating the Dao, speaking of the human body, within the golden chamber and jade hall, amid soundlessness, harmony alone is heard. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: "Within, the sun and moon array the constellations, the seven luminaries and nine origins crown the Gate of Life." The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "Golden perfection shines resplendent, its echoes flowing through cloudy encampments; jade tones gather qi, numinous winds amass mist. The Purple Void flourishes in splendor, aiding the ascent of myriad immortals—thousands harmonize, ten thousand unite, spontaneously achieving truth." Thus, the *Cavern Spirit Scripture* designates the liver as the palace of limpid coolness.

Reveling in the company of the five spirits,
Prolific thoughts call to radiant companions.
The five difficulties depart by principle,
The tranquil heart finds joy in itself.

To "revel" is to feast and wander; "joy" is delight. The five spirits are the sovereigns within the five qi. "Prolific thoughts" are the many entanglements. "Radiant companions" are those who summon and command luminous virtue. When these prolific thoughts dissolve, the five difficulties likewise depart by this principle—what is meant by "principle penetrating all obstructions."

The five difficulties are: first, removing the burden of sensual form; second, severing the burden of attachment; third, cutting off the burden of greed; fourth, stilling the burden of vain competition; fifth, dissolving the burden of bodily existence. Only when these difficulties are overcome can one traverse the five gates and be named among the Great Mystery. Thus, the *Zhen’gao* states: "When inner burdens are dispelled, the hun and po become supple; guard this without weariness, accumulate it without cease. The five difficulties having departed, one is enfeoffed as a marquis."

Thus, learning the Dao is not difficult—stilling the heart is difficult. When heart and method merge as one, utterly free from defilement, the harmonious heart abides joyfully in the Dao. This chapter concerns the work of the seven passages, opening the apertures to clarity. For humans are tranquil at birth, this is heaven’s nature; moved by external things, this is desire’s nature. The gate of perception lies in the seven apertures, their master in the single heart. Lest prolific thoughts stray into error, the very apertures that opened to clarity may become obscured. Only when the tranquil heart finds joy in itself can the sevenfold transformation be accomplished.

The luminous soul follows its root,
Diligent and untiring,
Poised in the void.
Seven recitations open the layered gates,
Dissolving stagnation without divine might.
Movement issues from within,
Raising a lofty chant, bowing in reverence.

The luminous soul refers to the dispersion of the soul’s essence and the spirit’s numinosity. To "follow its root" is to return to the origin, revert to the primordial, and restore the mandate without departure. Thus unified and merged, empty yet thoroughly permeated with numinosity, it stands solitary and unsupported—hence its steadfast independence in the void.

The "seven recitations opening the layered gates" means the seven passages opening the apertures to clarity. "Dissolving stagnation without divine might" describes the natural efficacy of the *Shengshen Jade Chapters*: the dissolution of congealed obstructions arises not from the divine’s power but from the divine’s non-divinity, the martial’s non-martiality—utterly pristine, utterly luminous, with not a trace of human artifice. This is the unanticipated yet inevitable.

Thus the circulation’s unimpeded flow is not attained from without, and so one raises a lofty chant and bows in reverence.

**Chapter Eight: The High Void and Pure Clarity, Heaven of the Numinous Birth**
The *Exegesis of the Luminous Meaning* states: This heaven reveals the high, distant, and profoundly subtle; the pure, bright, and penetratingly radiant. It illumines and mirrors the form and body, descending qi to the Three Origins, engendering the Three Palaces within humans. Internally, it constitutes the five viscera and nine repositories; above, it corresponds to the Golden Flower Palace, named the Heaven of the High Void and Pure Clarity. Those born in this heaven cultivate deeds of lofty remoteness, perceive the earth as void and luminous, ascend to the layered firmaments, transcend the Three Realms, advance to the immortal ranks, and enter the Gate of Liberation.

The *Secret Script* says: The qi of this heaven’s essence-soul communicates with yang, presiding over the True Inner Spirits of the Yin Utmost Palace.

**The Qi of the Imperial True Flower Palace, Commanding the Primordial Numinous Transformation and Congealment**
The *Commentary* states: The preceding chapter spoke of the apertures opening to clarity; this chapter elucidates the Flower Palace, encompassing the gods of the Three Regions and Eight Sceneries. "True" denotes the principle’s truth, real and without delusion. "Numinous" denotes the qi’s numinous subtlety, unobstructed. As principle and qi merge and fuse, wondrous transformation and congealment ensue—thus it circulates through past and present, eternally numinous and enduring. Though its functions are unfathomably transformative, its essence remains quiescent and congealed in non-action.

Above the pure clarity of layered firmaments,
It meets the auspicious clouds at the appointed time.
Jade chapters disperse into the tranquil heart,
The solitary radiance seeks numinous communion.

This heaven lies above the layered firmaments. "Meeting the auspicious clouds at the appointed time" means aligning with the profound moment to gather at the edge of the felicitous clouds. "Solitary radiance" describes the principle’s snail-like purity, solitary and unopposed by phenomena. Having spoken in the preceding chapter of the tranquil heart’s joy in itself, there remains the danger of stagnation in one place, unable to transform. Thus the jade chapters are dispersed to harmonize with the tranquil heart, forgetting both subject and object, transcending to spontaneous transformation—whereupon the numinous naturally awakens, for the very substance is the Dao.

Resplendent, the radiant rosy clouds spread,
The heart’s spirit traverses all without hindrance.
Jade branches stream with ethereal sounds,
Serene and unhurried, in the subtlety of the void.

This passage depicts the scenery within the true, the essence of wondrous awakening. With insight attained, every encounter reveals the heart, and all things accord with principle—its joy lies not without. "Resplendent, the radiant rosy clouds spread" praises the extraordinary unfolding of celestial splendor. The *Commentary* states: "Resplendent" means luminous; "falling" means cascading. "Radiant rosy clouds" are auspicious clouds. "The heart’s spirit" refers to the heart, and "traverses all without hindrance" means nothing is left unexperienced—thus this heart perceives boundlessly.

"Jade branches stream with ethereal sounds" describes the branches of the *qian* tree, stirred by the numinous wind, their music flowing freely, like the serene and unhurried discourse of the void’s subtlety.

Numinous tones vibrate through the empty vastness,
The Nine Mysteries depart from dark lineages.
Responsive and unobstructed, free from stagnation,
Departure and abiding are like loosening a sash.

"Lucid understanding of the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*—soaring on high without ultimate decay."

When numinous tones vibrate through the wondrous emptiness of the void, the souls of the Nine Mysteries are all liberated from the dark night. At this stage of cultivation, the nine generations of ancestors ascend and transcend.

"Responsive and unobstructed, free from stagnation" describes self-benefit extending to the benefit of others. The character *shuang* (爽) is often mistakenly written as *shang* (赏) in common editions due to phonetic similarity, but the Shu and Zhedong versions both use *shuang*, and this is followed here. The *Wanguang Repentance* states: "When the true spirit abides in stillness, the souls of the departed are moved and transformed as if by echo and shadow"—this speaks of the marvel of resonance in quiescent concentration. For when those ethereal spirits are awakened by this Dao, they are no longer bound by stagnation, and their comings and goings become as effortless as loosening a sash.

"Lucid understanding of the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*—soaring on high without ultimate decay" means that by awakening to the Way of generating the spirit, one realizes that one’s original spirit is one with the Dao. Thus, one roams beyond the realm of things, forever free from the prospect of decay. In this state, how could the calamities of the *yang* nine and hundred-six cycles ever reach one?

The dark radiance illumines the cloud-laden thoroughfares,
Traces transcend the divine beyond.

"Resonance knows no bounds of square or circle,
Yet provisionally moves through the Four Great Elements.
With focused mind, bowing in reverent recitation,
All sages together rejoice in delight.

*Xuan jing*—the dark radiance—refers to the luminous splendor of the Mystic Flower, ascending and shining upon the cloud-laden thoroughfares, so that above and below are wholly illumined. *Traces transcend the divine beyond* means transcending the four directions of heaven and earth. For though this celestial origin’s traces are supremely exalted, far surpassing the realm of things, the spirit has no fixed form—how could it be confined to any trace? Thus, its response to phenomena is unfathomable, while its wondrous essence remains ever quiescent. Whether the stimulus is round or square, its resonance is round or square without being bound by round or square—hence, *resonance knows no bounds of square or circle*.

The *Four Great Elements*, as the commentary states, are earth, water, fire, and wind. These four combine to form this body, yet the Way of generating the spirit is subtler than the myriad things. Though it moves and transforms through the Four Great Elements, it is not hindered by them; yet one cannot abandon these Four Great Elements to pursue emptiness and wonder beyond them—hence, *provisionally moves through the Four Great Elements*. *With focused mind, bowing in reverent recitation, all sages together rejoice in delight* means that by refining this principle in the heart and reciting it with reverence, the merit of the Eight Transgressions is fulfilled. Then, whether the sages above or oneself below, all are united in the one Dao, and all delight in the accomplishment of the immortal’s path—thus, *all sages together rejoice in delight*.

**Chapter Nine: The Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knots, No-Attachment**
The commentary states: This heaven is free from the thoughts of the five desires, has severed the knots of the womb, and forever relinquished attachment to form—hence its name is taken from these surpassing virtues. The *Secret Script* says: The essence-spirit of this heaven, the *qi* of yang’s sprouting, governs the inner spirits of the Cinnabar Field Palace below. To dwell in the heights yet generate the spirit below is the reversal of the Dao.

*The Qi of the Imperial True Spirit’s Mansion, the Life-Source of Spontaneous Mystic Illumination*
All versions read *Yue Mansion*, but Master Zheng Suonan’s *Discussions* emends it to *Spirit’s Mansion*, a reading of greater depth and propriety—hence it is followed here. This speaks of the fullness of yang brightness, its illumination boundless, a success of spontaneity—thus, *the qi of spontaneous mystic illumination*.

*Without knots, emotions are firmly stilled,
In profound profundity, the void is serene.*
*Transformation turns without fixed sequence,
Yet its reckoning cannot be defied.*

While in the womb, humans form knots through blood and *qi*; if these knots remain unresolved, the Way of life does not flourish. Moreover, the human spirit is fundamentally quiescent, yet emotions disturb it. Emotion is the movement of nature; when movement strays from rectitude, it clings to external things, forming knots and obstructions. As the *Nanhua Sutra* says: "Things are knotted by this." Thus, following karma, one revolves without cease. Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must refine their emotions to unite with their nature. When emotions are forgotten and knots dissolved, one may witness the wondrous Three Primes and directly enter the realm of profound profundity—then the center is empty, serene, and non-active.

*Wheel* means turning. The quiescent and non-active revolve and transform spontaneously, without fixed measure or sequence—how could they be reckoned by numbers? *Cannot* means impossibility; *reckoned* refers to multiplication by calculation. The *Nanhua Sutra* says: "The hinge finds the center of the ring, responding without end"—this is the same idea.

*Who says the formless is level?
Lofty and towering, many are its hills and ridges.*
*With a darkened mind, one soars freely onward,
Aspiring high to purify the spirit’s summons.*

From coarse observation to refined, the formless becomes as nothing; yet viewing the Dao through the Dao, wondrous existence abides within utter nothingness. The *formless* refers to the Heaven of No-Form. Above the Heaven of No-Form lies the Heaven of the Seed People; above that, the realm of the Great Luo Dao. This chapter speaks of the affairs of spiritual ascent to the highest realms after merit is complete and virtue perfected. Who says the formless above is flat and featureless? In truth, it is lofty and towering, with many hills and ridges. Yu Luo Xiao Terrace, Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital, the Three Flowers’ Departure from Convenience, the Wondrous Court of Great Possession—all lie within the Jade Clarity realm, the abode of the Three Pure Ones. Within the human body, the region above the eyes is the Heaven of No-Form, while the Muddy Pellet is Jade Capital Mountain. Thus, those who darken their minds to unite with the Dao may soar and roam freely, transcending the Three Realms to enter Jade Capital—this is what is meant by *with a darkened mind, one soars freely onward, aspiring high to purify the spirit’s summons*.

Attaining this felicitous encounter, one forever realizes the non-active, harmonizing virtue with the Three Primes and aligning with the Nine *Qi*, without end or beginning, beyond death or birth. It cannot be measured by years and ages, nor can kalpas suffice to name it. *Summons* is also written as *clarity*, meaning clarity and purity.

*Ethereal spirits follow the ancient paths,
Returning to the womb by constant law.*
*Divine resonance pervades the Great Void,
Treading upon the frost of the empyrean.*
*The ford’s swiftness—seven *gou* in measure—
Stirs the ten thousand streams, silently congealing the true spirit’s ascent.*
*Without attachment, there is no sorrow;
In lofty contemplation, one bows and ascends.*

The Shu commentary states: From the first chapter’s "womb-Primordial knits long life" to the second chapter’s "severing roots and sealing death’s gate," the third chapter’s "soul-born gathering of wandering qi," the fourth chapter’s "spirit-lord gathering of wandering qi," the fifth chapter’s "qi refining and tempering the Primordial viscera," and the sixth chapter’s "hewing and clearing the womb-tree’s stagnation"—once the Five Viscera and Six Palaces are complete, only then do the seventh chapter and beyond speak of non-action. In my humble view, this chapter discusses the womb and embryo, the time when spirit is whole and qi is full; in terms of cultivating the Real, it is the time when the Dao is complete and virtue is perfected. Thus, its words all pertain to those who embody form and emulate power. If earlier chapters occasionally touch upon the already-accomplished, it is to perceive cause through effect; if this chapter still mentions ethereal spirits, it is to perceive effect through cause. Each chapter, therefore, mutually contains this intent.

Here, "ethereal spirits follow the ancient paths" means that the light and floating spirits return by adhering to their root, fully restoring their inherent constancy. Thus, qi aligns with the Nine Heavens as one, and spirit resonates with the Great Void, penetrating it utterly—hence one may tread upon the empyrean’s frosty realm. Thus it is said: *Divine resonance pervades the Great Void, treading upon the frost of the empyrean.*

*Ice* is formed by congealing, possessing substance yet no materiality, embodying firmness, steadfastness, and immaculate purity. *The ford’s swiftness stirs the ten thousand streams, silently congealing the true spirit’s ascent*—*ford* refers to the Celestial Ford and the River of Stars. *Ten thousand streams* signifies their branching in myriad directions. The Celestial Ford’s swift currents surge and stir the countless tributaries, a realm unattainable to those bound by form, only to be reached when the true spirit silently congeals and ascends. Thus, the Lady of Purple Tenuity says: *Mystic waves shake the azure tides, the vast ford stirs the ten thousand streams; I chariot the radiance to gaze upon the Jade Void, longing to wander with the fair one.* This expresses the same meaning.

Some say the *frost of the empyrean* is the brain, where qi steams upward to form the ford’s currents, flowing downward to moisten below, while the spirit then reascends to the upper realm. The Shu commentary states: Those who study this Dao must take non-attachment and non-sorrow as their foundation. The Lady of the Southern Culmen says: *From attachment arises sorrow, from sorrow arises fear; without attachment, there is no sorrow, without sorrow, no fear.* For those who attain this Dao, transcending beyond form, walking alone beyond the Three Realms—otherwise, one drowns in the cycles of life and death, mired in the river of attachment. How then could one speak of the Dao of engendering spirit? Thus, *In lofty contemplation, one bows and ascends*—free from all defilement, one soars to sublime heights, bowing in reverence to ascend.

Now, the *Precious Chapters of Engendering Spirit* are the nine celestial chapters bestowed by the Primordial Heavenly King, who commanded the Nine Heavens’ Marshal and the Jade Lad-in-Attendance to open the cloud-brocade satchel of Purple Yang’s Jade Thatch. In this scripture, they are praised as the *Primordial’s Forbidden Writings*, the *Cavernous Chapters*, the *True Writings*, and the *Precious Chapters*—all undoubtedly referring to these chapters. Yet within this very chapter, there are further praises, such as: *The Marshal recites the cavernous hymns, jade chapters engender the ten thousand spirits; jasper tones soar beyond the nine rosy clouds; jade chapters penetrate the hidden void, resplendently engendering the spirit-chapter; jade chapters disperse into the center of the heart, illuminating and recognizing the spirit-chapter.* Such phrases leave one uncertain: to what do *spirit-chapter*, *jasper tones*, and *cavernous hymns* truly refer? Perhaps they point to meanings beyond the chapters themselves, guiding one to seek the natural chapters within oneself, silently comprehending and naturally attaining them. Truly, that which is revered as the honor of heaven and earth, the root of the ten thousand things, cannot be contained by mere words. *Chapters, oh chapters! Can they be merely recited with the mouth?*

*Explication of the Meaning of the* Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure’s *Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters of Engendering Spirit*, Scroll Three—*End*
*Explication of the Meaning of the* Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure’s *Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters of Engendering Spirit*, Scroll Four
By Dong Sijing of Mount Gui, Daoist of the Tianqing Abbey of Pure Source
*Two Eulogies by the Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate*

The *Explication* states: The Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate is none other than Yuanfu. *Gēdé* means "eulogy." These verses extol the merit of transcending the Three Realms and praise the virtue of the practitioner, bestowed upon the Immortal Duke. Some say this refers to Maitreya. The *Declarations of the Perfected* records: "In Mount Huo, there was a Daoist adept named Wang Yuanfu who received the method of the Azure Jade Meal from the Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate." The *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Shangqing Scripture’s Mysteries* states: "Xiliangzi received the method of the □ meal, as did Wang Zongzhen, An Duming, and Du Chong of Gaojing—all were the Perfected Ones of the Supreme Ultimate." Thus, the immortals who held this office in antiquity were not few. Yet in this *Explication*, only Yuanfu is mentioned, without surname, and the precise identity remains unclear; we leave it aside for now.

The Great Dao, though without intent, may be sought with sentiment. The *Explication* states: Utterly quiescent and wordless, it responds with discourse when moved. Through sentiment, one may reach the unsentimental; through the heart, one may merge with the heartless. This is because the Dao is the primordial source of the myriad transformations, giving birth to heaven and earth, driving the sun and moon—all occurs spontaneously, without intent. If one seeks it, one need only reach the state of selflessness, and the heart itself becomes the Dao. What is called "sought with sentiment" refers to the scholar’s resolve to pursue the Dao. The path of study must first arrive at knowledge, then through learning, ascend to the realm of the sage—hence, "sought with sentiment."

I await my chariot in the Cavernous Void,
Gaze back upon the misty, surging streams.
Beyond the Three Realms, pure and bright,
I wander the Jade Capital, serene and free.

Without the mysterious decree’s decree,
Who could fathom the dark mystery?
The distant corner—
Vast and clear, the Celestial River gleams,
In every glance, in every turn, all is emptiness and softness.

The Seven Mysteries scatter the dark night,
Returning to the womb, they follow the ebb and flow.
If the dark destiny is silently congealed,
The Yang’s nine calamities bring no fear.

The Cavernous Void is the realm of the Three Qi, the domain of the Three Clarities. To await one’s chariot here is to look back upon the lower realms, all shrouded in misty, surging streams—referring to the calamity of the *jiashen* epoch, when the Three Disasters strike, and all is deluge. Only those whose Three Poisons are extinguished, whose hearts and realms are pure and bright, transcend the Three Realms entirely, wandering the Jade Capital in serene freedom. Yet without the Great Cavern’s mighty One True Method—what is called "the mysterious decree of the Emperor’s Chart," the destiny that aligns with immortality, or the fortune of encountering the Great Peace—one cannot partake in this Dao. Thus it is said: "Without the mysterious decree’s decree, who could fathom the dark mystery?" The dark mystery is the Dao itself.

"Vast and clear, the Celestial River gleams; in every glance, in every turn, all is emptiness and softness." Having awakened to this principle, the heart fuses with the realm’s purity, so wherever one dwells becomes thus. "Vast" describes its boundless expanse; "the Celestial River gleams" depicts the heavens’ splendor. To perfect the heart and attain the Dao, to concentrate the qi and achieve softness—this emptiness and softness become the essence. In every glance, in every turn, there is nothing that is not the Dao. Even the Seven Mysteries’ souls, scattered in the dark night, all ride this wondrous fruit to return to the root and revert to the origin, blending into the sacred embryo, following the ebb and flow of kalpic fortunes without attachment. Having grasped this dark destiny’s appointed time, if one can silently congeal the spirit and refine the primordial, then even the Yang’s nine disasters will not stir joy or sorrow in the heart.

I observe these comings and goings,
Yet time and again, I linger.
Externally, the body is cast aside, yet the body endures—
The true immortals gather with their worthy companions.

The commentary states: The preceding section elucidates inner virtue; this one expounds external transformation—the teachings of compassion and mercy. For those who have attained the Dao, if they cannot extend compassion and enact mercy, they remain ensnared by self-indulgence, fostering the illusion of self and thus obscuring the Dao. When virtue reaches this depth, such pitfalls vanish. The admonition to disciples is thus: when encountering the convergence of karmic cycles—of departure, return, life, and death—one must descend into the realms of humans and gods, lingering to teach and transform, ripening all beings until they attain the true Dao. This is what is meant by: "With great wisdom, one does not enter samsara; with great compassion, one does not abide in eternal quiescence."

"Externally, the body" refers to forgetting the self. To forget oneself in aiding others is to cast the body aside externally. Yet what remains within is the self; the more one gives to others, the more one possesses, abiding in stillness and constancy—thus enduring forever. How much more so when the self is fundamentally nonexistent? This is how one unites with the Dao and gathers with the true immortals as worthy companions.

Subtly profound is the mystery within,
Such is the principle.
Deep and clear is the sound of stillness—
The waves of the celestial river.
Change unfolds like a revolving ring,
Yet the camphor tree’s branches never alter.

The commentary states: The prior verse praises the adept’s merit in transcending the Three Realms; this verse extols the diligence of the perfected in their transformative work. Urging oneself onward in the profound mystery, one gazes down upon the Three Realms and sees only the deep, clear waves of the celestial river. In stillness, one observes the ceaseless flux of the myriad transformations, like a revolving ring without end. Only the wondrous root remains serene, enduring calamities and kalpas unchanged—just as, after the depths of winter, all blossoms wither, yet the camphor tree’s branches remain ever green. This is but an analogy for the principle, expressed thus.

With a tranquil mind, contemplate the utmost truth,
Flowing with the kalpic tides, following the dispersion of the net.
Resonance and response—principle is ever unobstructed,
Spiritual perception reaches its own culmination.
Wandering lightly, boundless from the outset,
Proliferating thoughts penetrate the ninefold radiance.
Flying roots scatter dark leaves,
The principle returns—there is nothing else.

The commentary states: This passage further praises the virtue of resonance and response in the perfected. The "utmost truth" refers to the flying celestial spirit-kings, who, with tranquil minds, oversee the Seven Awakenings, govern the celestial immortals, cherish all beings with compassion, and labor for the multitudes. As kalpic fortunes converge and the records of merits and demerits grow tangled, they are able to order each according to its category, arranging the scattered threads of the net with perfect clarity—such diligence is truly remarkable. Without awakening to the original essence and grasping its essentials, one could not respond to circumstances without hindrance. Thus it is said: "Resonance and response—principle is ever unobstructed."

Vast and impartial, when things arise, one responds in accord; when they depart, nothing lingers. Though phenomena vary endlessly and the stimuli of the sentient are inexhaustible, the principle of response remains ever unobstructed, never stinting in the slightest—this is what is meant by "quiescence and stimulus without limit." "Spiritual perception reaches its own culmination" means that while the stimuli of the sentient are boundless, the numinous response to each attains its own perfection. The commentary states: *Shi* (适) means "to reach the principle"; *dai* (逮) means "to arrive"; *zicu* (自徂) means "to proceed of itself." The spirit is that which subtly pervades the myriad things yet remains unfathomable. Thus, the spirit’s contemplation cannot be measured—it arrives without traveling, swiftly without haste. This describes how the numinous response, attuned to principle and answering phenomena, assigns each thing to its proper place, each affair to its proper affair. Without need for deliberation, it naturally and effortlessly reaches the utmost in each case.

The commentary further states: The traces of resonance and response are the teachings of the sages, who respond according to capacity. Since beings differ in kind and their faculties vary, the Three Caverns’ myriad methods are expounded so that each may awaken according to their portion. "Principle is ever unobstructed" means the sages perpetually enact salvation, never ceasing. As the *Mysterious Classic* states: "Ever skillfully saving beings, thus nothing is discarded." Whether beings have already resonated or not, each has their portion of the Dao. Thus, the sages skillfully ensure principle remains ever unobstructed, responding to every stimulus, and from each response, new stimuli arise—hence, "resonance and response—principle is ever unobstructed." By fully engaging the spirit to respond to things, each attains its utmost, and things cannot obscure it. Thus, principle remains ever unobstructed, and the spirit reaches its own culmination.

"Wandering lightly, boundless from the outset" describes a state of serene detachment, wandering at the origin of things, coextensive with the great void, utterly without limit. This is what the *Nanhua Sutra* calls "the land of nothing-whatsoever, the vast and boundless wilderness." "Proliferating thoughts penetrate the ninefold radiance" refers to the boundless clarity of the supreme sages, whose vastness knows no limit. Though the thoughts of sentient beings proliferate endlessly, the responses to their stimuli are inexhaustible—yet all arise and cease within this boundless expanse. From the perspective of the supreme sages, their vision penetrates all, luminous as the ninefold radiance spreading across the sky.

"Flying roots scatter dark leaves"—when humans are born, they are still, for stillness is the nature of heaven. When they are stimulated by things, movement arises, which is the desire of their nature. Thus, stillness is the root of movement; if stillness is the root, then movement is but its branches and leaves. When the root, which is still, scatters into movement, it is called "flying roots." The leaves, which are movement, ultimately originate from stillness, never departing from this nature—hence, "dark leaves." *Xuan* (玄) denotes the subtlety of this nature. "The principle returns—there is nothing else" means that, having awakened to this principle, one abides in quiescence, returning to the true principle—what else could there be? This is to embody the truth in every thought. In this state, movement is not movement, stillness is not stillness—not that there is neither movement nor stillness, but that movement and stillness are not two roots.

Ever reciting the jade verses,
The numinous sound pierces the distant heavens.

In the jia-shen year, the floodwaters rise,
Wings are reined to the Queen Mother’s home.
Eternally abiding without end,
Who knows the countless kalpas that pass?

Commentary: This concludes with an exhortation to the disciple. "Eternal" means unceasing at any time. If one can take constancy as the rule, reciting the jade verses in word and practicing the jade verses in deed, then merit and conduct will become manifest, naturally ascending to pierce the distant heavens. Should the jia-shen cycle arrive and the deluge descend, one may rein in one’s wings and ascend to the Western Queen Mother’s abode. Yet this flood disaster arises from the karmic retribution of sentient beings.

According to the *Lingbao Scripture on Dispelling Water and Fire Disasters and Epidemics*, when heaven and earth reach the exhaustion of their kalpic cycles, disasters of water and fire arise. Only the loftiest sages, the most exalted deities, and the celestial emperors can pacify them, ensuring that the kalpic cycles know no end and that water and fire cause no ruinous upheavals. It also states: The human body likewise suffers from water and fire disasters and epidemics. Only through great stillness and non-action, by subduing fire and elevating water to achieve harmony, can these be pacified—a truth known only to the most perfected and advanced disciples.

From this perspective, one who purifies the six senses and abides in great stillness and non-action can naturally pacify the disasters of water and fire, rectifying the imbalances of yin and yang. Thus, the ancient transcendents embodied the essence of the myriad things and grasped the origin of wondrous transformation. At first, they rode the uprightness of heaven and earth, wandering with the Creator. In the end, they presided over the cycles of kalpas, becoming masters of creation. Ascending to the divine void, they led the vastness of the primordial, bearing the vicissitudes of the world’s fortunes while their true constancy remained serene and undisturbed—how could any qi or kalpic reckoning constrain them?

According to the *Biography of the Queen Mother of the West*: The Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Turtle Mountain Metal Mother, also called the Most Numinous Nine Radiance Turtle Terrace Metal Mother, is the ultimate subtlety of the Western Florescence and the supreme honor of the Cavernous Yin. In ancient times, when the Dao’s qi congealed in stillness and its essence abided in non-action, it sought to initiate mysterious workings and give birth to the myriad things. Thus, from the qi of the Eastern Florescence’s utmost perfection, Lord Wood was born, and from the qi of the Western Florescence’s utmost perfection, the Metal Mother was born. Embodying the root of gentleness and compliance, she became the origin of yin’s extremity. Positioned in the west, she nurtures all beings. Her palaces and towers are arrayed with a thousand layers of golden walls, twelve jade towers, towers of luminous blossoms, halls of radiant azure, nine-tiered dark terraces, and purple-cinnabar chambers. To her left lies the Jasper Pool, to her right winds the Emerald River. Below stretch nine layers of weak waters and towering waves of ten thousand fathoms—none may reach her save by flying chariots or feathered wheels. Beneath her terraces grow trees of white jade and forests of cinnabar-hardness, with ten thousand branches of hollow azure and jade trunks reaching a thousand fathoms. Though no wind stirs, divine music resonates of its own, all attuned to the nine suites and eight harmonies. In accordance with the *Three Caverns Jade Writ of the Supreme Clarity Treasure Scripture*, all initiations and transmissions are overseen here. The Divine Continent lies to the southeast of her domain.

In the human body, this corresponds to the palace of Brahma’s qi, the true residence of earth, the root of the nine palaces.

"Eternally abiding without end—who knows the countless kalpas that pass?"
Commentary: Twelve years make one cycle. Here, "eternally abiding without end" refers to an unbroken succession of cycles—how could one know the multitude of kalpas that have passed? Thus, an ancient song says:
The Dao has no end,
My body has no end.
From kalpa to kalpa,
When will my life be exhausted?
This is to embody the Dao and transcend all limits.

*The Exegesis on the Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Spontaneous Generation of the Divine Chapters from the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure, Fascicle Four* concludes here.

Postscript:
After completing my exegesis on this scripture, a critic said: The Mandate of Heaven flows ceaselessly, august and unceasing. The two qi and five phases bestow themselves upon the myriad things, generating without end, originating from a single qi. That which governs this qi is but one principle. Thus, when bestowed by the celestial realm, it is called "mandate"; when received by humans and other beings, it is called "nature"; and its unfathomable responsiveness is called "spirit." Spirit is one—when in the heart, it thinks; in the eyes, it sees; in the ears, it hears; in the mouth, it speaks. Even the hands’ grasping and the feet’s movement—all the thousand changes and myriad transformations—are the work of this single spirit. Its use is auspicious when aligned with correctness and inauspicious when misaligned. How could there be distinct names and functions as disparate as these?

I replied: Your argument indeed has merit, but you know only one aspect and not the other. The Dao’s complete body is undifferentiated and unified, yet the distinctions between essence and coarse, root and branch, inner and outer are clearly demarcated. Within it, not even a hair’s breadth or a thread’s weight may be confused. Now, you only recognize the greatness of what is undifferentiated and delight in speaking of it, yet you fail to see that what is clearly demarcated has never been separate. Have you observed the Way of heaven and earth? In general, it is simply heaven and earth. Yet within it, the sun, moon, and stars follow their courses; wind, rain, dew, and thunder enact their transformations; rivers, lakes, mountains, and peaks flow and stand; birds, beasts, plants, and trees live and grow. Are these not clear and distinct within the undifferentiated whole? Do such phenomena each have their own governing spirits, or is it merely that spirit is one?

If we analyze and distinguish them, they cannot all be enumerated. Take, for example, the sun’s movement: broadly speaking, it completes one circuit of the heavens in a year. Yet its 365¼ degrees cannot be in *Yi* when it should be in *Zhen*, nor in *Jiao* when it should be in *Kang*. Are these not distinctions finer than a hair’s breadth? The human body is also a heaven and earth. The four limbs and hundred parts are distinct; the five viscera and six bowels are complete. Even the 36,000 joints each have their own governance. Thus, the eyes’ office is to see, yet the deaf do not use sight to replace hearing. The mouth’s function is speech, the heart’s is thought—all are so.

The establishment of these myriad spirits’ names thus arises, yet when unified, they have their *Zong* (Source), and when gathered, they have their *Yuan* (Origin). How could one fragment and fault them?

The critic further asks: *The Laozi* states, “Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; man attains the One and becomes numinous; the myriad things attain the One and live.” *The Zhuangzi* says, “Heaven and earth are born together with me; the myriad things and I are one.” It also says, “To embrace the myriad things as one, to join the One and follow Heaven.” Of all discourses on the Dao, none surpass Lao and Zhuang, yet both uphold the One. Thus, the distinctions of heaven, earth, and the myriad things are but the One running through them. Now this scripture instead values non-unity—why?

I reply: Do you understand the intent of this scripture? Its names are manifold, yet what unifies them is one. The scripture’s *Yuan* is precisely the One of Lao and Zhuang. To call it *Yuan*, to call it One, speaks of its essence. The method of generating spirits, with its manifold names, speaks of its function. In discussing essence, we point to their sameness; in discussing function, we reveal their differences.

*Laozi* says, “The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things.” This is a saying that encompasses root and branch alike. This scripture’s discourse begins with the One Origin and ends with heaven, earth, and the myriad transformations all receiving life and completion—thus, within the One, the Ten Thousand are already contained.

The Dao of generating spirits takes the empty, cavernous True One as its essence and ceaseless, non-uniform transformation as its function. Only through the One can it be still; through stillness, it can then transform; through transformation, it can then transmute. Therein arises sagely achievement, and numinous clarity emerges. Thus, the One and the non-One are not two separate things.

I have heard the former sages say: “Gather the Ten Thousand *qi* into One *qi*; disperse the One *qi* into the Ten Thousand *qi*. Unite the Ten Thousand spirits into One spirit; divide the One spirit into the Ten Thousand spirits.” They also say: “When gathered, it becomes form; when scattered, it becomes *qi*.” This is the Dao of opening and closing, gathering and dispersing—its workings align with yin and yang, its virtue matches heaven and earth.

Thus it is said: “The universe lies in the palm of your hand; the myriad transformations arise within your body.” Extending and practicing this, one may perfect the person, perfect things, assist in transformation and nurturance, and partake in the work of heaven and earth. Who but the sagely and numinous of the world could attain this?

As for those who know its fundamental non-being yet do not grasp its ultimate being, who know the True One yet do not comprehend its transformations—these are partial views. How can they be mentioned in the same breath as this?

The critic further asks: The teachings say, “When feeling abides in sagely measure, it still falls into dharmic dust.” Now this scripture instructs people in the method of cultivating the sagely embryo—does this not risk falling into the same error?

I reply: “Feeling abiding in sagely measure” refers to those who have not forgotten the mind and its methods, while “cultivating the sagely embryo” is set forth for beginners. As for those in whom the Dao is complete and virtue perfected, how could this be used to judge them?

I have heard the former sages say: “The sage gathers the Ten Thousand existences into a single breath—no single thing can enslave their luminous clarity. They disperse a single breath into the Ten Thousand existences—no single thing can interrupt their cloud-like actions.” It is like the rising and setting of the sun and moon in the heavens, the stirring of wind and thunder, the arising and vanishing of clouds and mist, the transformations of the myriad existences—all come and go, appear and disappear, naturally and spontaneously. Who knows why it is so? Who knows why it is not so? In such a state, what is sagely measure? What is dharmic dust?

The critic further asks: I have heard the Buddhist teachings hold that all conditioned things are illusory and false, hence their doctrine of non-arising and the bliss of quiescent extinction. Yet the Daoist teachings speak of long life and enduring vision, even ascending to emptiness and liberating the corpse. Thus, they are derided as “juggling spirits” and “corpse-guarding ghosts.” I cannot help but be perplexed—would you resolve this for me?

I reply: It is not so.

The Dao is but one—how could there be any division into "this" and "that"? Consider Bodhidharma crossing the river on a reed, or Puhua ringing his bell in empty space; some ascend in golden coffins, others conceal themselves in stone steles—are these acts of "juggling spirits" or "corpse-guarding ghosts"? The Dao is responsive and faithful, formless and non-acting, self-originating and self-rooted. Before heaven and earth existed, it was already eternally present. It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth, yet lies not deep even beneath the six directions, nor grows old though it precedes antiquity. Without beginning or end, without before or after, those who attain it endure as long as the Dao itself.

Moreover, the myriad things cannot be born without the Dao, nor completed without virtue. The principle of ceaseless generation is ever thus. Yet that which generates does not itself generate; that which transforms does not itself transform—what room is there for deliberate intent? I have heard the ancient sages say: "Humans exist within the Dao as fish exist within water. If humans depart from the Dao, they perish; if fish lose water, they die." Truly, the difference lies in diligence or negligence in cultivation, hence the depth or shallowness of attainment.

Those who attain it shallowly reach only the mind. Having reached the mind, they gain only wisdom and awareness. Delighted by this, they become loquacious, dissipating their numinous qi, and their form follows in decline. Those who attain it deeply permeate both form and spirit, merging with the Dao in truth. When manifest, their spirit harmonizes with form; when hidden, their form harmonizes with spirit. In being, they are; in non-being, they are not. They cannot be discerned by form or traces, nor judged by life or death—how then could they be called "jugglers of spirits" or "guardians of corpses"?

Thus it is said: "Unite my essence with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things; unite my spirit with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things; unite my hun-soul with the hun-souls of heaven, earth, and the myriad things; unite my po-soul with the po-souls of heaven, earth, and the myriad things." Then heaven, earth, and the myriad things become my essence, my spirit, my hun-soul, my po-soul. What is death? What is life? In this state, one rides the constancy of heaven and earth, masters the transformations of the six qi, roams the Three Clarities, and becomes one with the Dao in body. Hence it is said: "The perfected person has no self."

Thus is the critic’s doubt resolved. I have sent this to Jing’an of the Three Mountains for verification and appended it to the scripture’s end. Respectfully recorded by Dong Sijing of Tianqing Abbey in Qingyuan, in the renzi year of the Chunyou reign.
