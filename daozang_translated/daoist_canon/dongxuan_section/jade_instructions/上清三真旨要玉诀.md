*Author:* Unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Compiled from early Supreme Clarity School scriptures and oral instructions. Liu Shipei believed this text to be a missing volume of Tao Hongjing’s *Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection*. The original number of fascicles is unknown; two versions survive: (1) Dunhuang manuscript P.2576V, and (2) the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, under the *Jade Instructions* category of the *Cavernous Mystery Division*. Both are incomplete. The present text is a collated reconstruction.

**The Essential Jade Instructions of the Three Perfected Ones of Supreme Clarity**
*(Preceding text missing)*

Don the *Primordial Seamless Robe of Colored Chapters*, hold the essence of the sun in the left hand and the radiance of the moon in the right, and fill the mud-palace of my upper mansion. Thrice invoke the Supreme Treasure Perfected One. The Great Void bestows the five *qi* to flow with essence, refining and observing my body. Swallow the five flavors five times, then raise the head and recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Perfected Sovereign,
Five Thearchs of the Great Void,
Guard my mud-palace,
Mysteriously reflect the five forms.
The Three Luminaries shine brightly,
Sun and moon illumine with clarity.
Flying clouds and flowing auroras
Infuse and refine jade essence.
Cultivate countenance, preserve the *po*,
Spirit and soul spontaneously arise.
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes,
Ascend to the Purple Court."*

When finished, guide the *qi* five times and cease.

After reciting the five directional invocations, rub the palms and wipe the eyes. After five years of such practice, the face will assume a golden countenance, the five viscera will flourish with blossoms, the jade storehouse will preserve *qi*, and the Dao of immortality will be achieved. The Three Palaces will all be harmonious, the true numina will manifest in form, riding the void and mounting the mist to soar through the Great Empyrean. This must be practiced in secrecy; do not transmit it lightly.

For those who cultivate the supreme method, reciting it ten thousand times to seek the numinous and attain immortality: on the days of the eight solar terms, inscribe a memorial on the sacred peak of one’s life-destiny and present it to the Jade Clarity. After three years without lapse, one’s name will be recorded in the Azure Palace, registered with the Jade Thearch, attended by jade blossoms, and welcomed by the Golden Dawn. This jade essence true instruction is the treasured scripture of the Thearch-Lord. Whoever obtains this instruction will ascend as an immortal in a calculated number of days. To recklessly divulge the divine text is to invite judgment upon the nine ancestral generations, body destroyed and form extinguished, eternally sealed in the River Source. Only through secret cultivation does the Way not speak falsely.

From this time onward,
The Three Realms will welcome and receive,
Riding the void, mounting the mist,
Soaring through the Great Empyrean."*

Northern Feng descends in death,
Southern Palace records the name."*

Beginning of kalpas without end.

On the day of the summer solstice, at noon, face southeast. Strike the teeth thirty-two times and recite while looking upward:

Form renewed, years made young.
Crossing radiant light, enwrapped in glory,
Eternally preserve the highest immortals."*

When finished, swallow *qi* nine times and cease. Turn north, kneel, and read the memorial incantation as prescribed. Then bury the memorial.

The Highest Purple Void Jade Sovereign of the Great Cavern’s Three Luminaries, Disciple of the Eastern Peak’s Master of Mystic Stillness, He Xuanming, aged fifty-six, styled Zifangguo, born in the first month, having received the Three Sincerities, respectfully petitions to open the sacred mountains of the Five Peaks, the Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, and Twelve River Sources. This humble servant, Xuan, presents his name to the Jade Clarity in memorial.

Inscribe in vermilion on a silver tablet, face north to read it, then bury the tablet beneath the Dark Mystery Crag, ensuring no one discovers it.

Face north, bow twice, kneel, and read the memorial to completion. Then strike the teeth nine times and softly recite the incantation:

*"Primal Thearch Sovereign,

Golden Immortals, Father and Mother,

Governor of the myriad *qi*,
Inspector of the true, leader of immortals.
In the Upper Azure Palace,
Seal the numinous immortals.
Name fixed in the celestial register,
Presented before the Thearch.
Reverently open the Nine Bureaus,
Three Offices, and River Sources.
Name entered in the Azure Register,
Eternally preserved in perpetuity."*

When finished, bury the memorial.

These are the plain words and wondrous formulas of the Thearch Lord, transmitted only to those of bone predestined for immortality. At each seasonal node, perform the above rite, completing twenty-four burials of the inscribed tablet in the sacred peaks over three years. Then the True Sovereign will record the name, and the Thearch will assign twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens. To recklessly divulge this treasure formula is to invite the annihilation of oneself and one’s descendants. Strictly observe the mystic statutes and guard this practice in secrecy.

The Jade Essence Formula states: Should you conceal your studies and purify yourself in the mountains, on a *ren* or *gui* day, carve the Nine Heavens Jade Script in black on green stone and bury it in the east of your dwelling. At the moment of burial, face east, strike the teeth nine times, and recite:

*"Green Obscurity, Green Obscurity,
Spirit Peak of Mount Tai,
Nine *qi* dense with essence,
Eternally numinous in dark mystery.
Three Fields of indigo waves,
Four limbs, six eyes—
Palace of the Highest Perfected,
Proclaimed throughout the four quarters.
Thousand spirits, myriad essences,
All submit in reverence.
The Jade Thearch commands:
Those who transgress shall be executed."*

When finished, bury the stone nine feet deep.

Inscribed in black on green stone and buried east of one’s dwelling mountain, it subdues myriad demons and summons perfected immortals to appear, with jade maidens guarding the form. Guard this secret closely.

Southern Flame of myriad spirits,
Dense mist nurturing the whirlwind,
Descending into dark obscurity.
The Thearch’s palace holds rank,
Floating life in Yellow Tranquility.
From heaven above,
Dare none fail to heed.
Those who transgress shall be executed,
Those who offend shall be punished."*

The Jade Essence Formula states: On a *wu* or *ji* day, carve the Nine Heavens Jade Script in yellow on white stone and bury it west of your dwelling mountain. At the moment of burial, face west, strike the teeth nine times, and recite:

Pale clouds, dark slopes.
Myriad spirits of the Western Peak,
Riding *qi* on flowing waves.
The Primal Beginning proclaims the command,
Governing the Three Florences.
Four quarters, eight *qi*—
All become my domain.
Those who transgress shall be slain,
Those who offend shall lament."*

The Jade Essence Formula states: On a *geng* or *xin* day, carve the Nine Heavens Jade Script in white on black stone and bury it north of your dwelling mountain. At the moment of burial, face north, strike the teeth nine times, and recite:

*"Northern Mount Heng,
Essence of the Star of Longevity,
Dark vastness, black radiance,

Governing the Five Directions.
Above, the Primal Decree descends,
Subduing demons and vanquishing lords.

The Jade Essence Mountain-Subduing Method to the right was received by the Thearch Lord from the Nine Heavens Venerable—an oral transmission of utmost secrecy. In accordance with the statutes of the Supreme Perfected, it may be transmitted only once every seven hundred years to those whose bones are predestined to receive it. Those without jade names must not rashly disclose or lightly reveal this divine scripture; violators will bring calamity upon their seven ancestral generations and annihilation upon their own bodies. Let the recipient be vigilant.

This secret scripture is to be reverently practiced. For the transmission of its true oral instructions, in accordance with the luminous statutes, one must provide: a golden fish, a jade dragon, forty feet of azure silk, nine pairs of golden buttons, and one hundred feet of silk bearing the recipient’s life-tally, all as pledges of faith before the Nine Heavens. The oath is to be sworn in a secluded chamber during the Muqing Fast. Only then may the transmission proceed. Should the pledge be broken, both master and disciple shall share the same punishment. Let all who receive this transmission from the ghostly officials proceed with utmost caution.

*Precious Divine Jade Scripture on the Rising and Resting of the Queen Mother of the West*
Copied by the Lady of Purple Tenuity

Upon waking at night, immediately close both eyes, click the teeth nine times, and swallow saliva three times. Then press the tongue against the throat, shake the head and neck seven times, and with the hands, rub the sides of the nose—left and right, up and down—dozens of times. Softly recite the incantation:

*"Nine Heavens Thearch,
Three Origins protect the infant.
The Supreme deploys the flower,
Jade chamber emits essence.
Seven gates summon spirits,
Nine chambers receive illumination.
Ears keen, eyes clear,
Communing with the Perfected, penetrating the numinous.
The mountain within heaven,
Harmonious qi in balance.
Cloud-demeanored Maid,
Bright Lad of radiant wisdom.
Mysterious hearing, resplendent,
Hundred halls gleaming.
Preserve harmony in the Upper Origin,
Wandering the Golden Court.
Five viscera radiant,
Ears and eyes ever-vital.
Spirit terrace stands firm,
Pillars and beams unshaken.
Seven po refined,
Three hun in yellow serenity.
The Great One takes my hand,
Walking beside me.
Five Elders merge as one,
Wu Ying aids the encampment.
Myriad evils vanish,
Myriad wishes fulfilled.
Sun and moon guard the gates,
Heart roams with auspicious stars.
What the immortal longs for is proclaimed—
Ten thousand spirits heed with reverence."*

Upon waking, perform this pressing and incantation without fail. Let it not be forgotten. Though the true Dao may be attained, this practice must still be observed continually.

This is the superior method of *The Supreme Western Queen Mother’s Precious Scripture on the Jade Rites of Rising and Resting*. It sharpens the ears and brightens the eyes, strengthening perception and memory. The nose remains balanced and clear, free from mucus and filth. The four directions and eight reaches become luminous, the face retains a youthful glow, the hun and po are governed, and all demons are repelled—this is the wondrous Dao of the Perfected One’s rising and resting.

It is called "rising and resting" because these are the practices to be observed upon waking and before sleep. Upon completion, rub the face and eyes with both hands until slightly warm, making this a regular habit to be performed frequently.

The Divine Mother said: When a person grows old, the skin of the face begins first beneath the eyes. When the body’s qi wanes, it starts between the nostrils. These two places are the windows of the skin and the passes of qi’s power. Thus, the rites of rising and resting are practiced constantly to protect the skin and preserve the harmony and vigor of qi.

*The Western Queen Mother’s Precious Scripture of Jade on Life Without Death*
Copied by the Lady of Purple Tenuity

The Scripture of Jade on Life Without Death states:
Hands part the blossoming courtyard’s side,
Lingering in harmony with the celestial Perfected.
Above, enter the chambers of the spirit,
Jade valleys fill the celestial mountains.
The inner source reveals the mysterious numen,
Myriad demons wipe themselves away.
Eternal life without death,
Jade registers return to the Lord Emperor.
Through you, harmony with the celestial Perfected,
Press this hidden mountain’s source.

The celestial Perfected resides between the brows, at the inner corners of the eyes. A fraction below the celestial Perfected lies the upper chamber of spirit conduction. The inner source is at the root of the philtrum above the upper lip, within the small hollow beside the nostrils—this is the gate where the mysterious numen extinguishes demons. The blossoming courtyard lies below the brows, at their central point, the bridge of luminous vision.

At dawn upon rising and at dusk before sleep, swiftly close the eyes, turn the tongue toward the throat, and swallow saliva three times. Then press these three places, each twenty-seven times, applying gentle pressure without lifting the hands. Make this a constant practice, and one will attain life without death, summon spirits, achieve luminous vision, and block the paths of all ghosts.

After pressing, softly recite the incantation:
Supreme Void Sovereign,
Disperse the jade courtyard.
The golden chamber gleams resplendent,
The jasper terrace lush and verdant.
I seize the three paths,
Extinguishing demons and birthing spirits.
Since I am without death,
I am also without birth.
Ever abiding in freedom,
Reversing age to return to infancy.
Hun and po refined and supple,
The five spirits at peace.
The whirling gale conveys the numinous carriage,
Northward I visit Jade Purity.
Ascending to the Great Void,
Merging with the sun,
I become a Perfected One,
The Lord Emperor unites in darkness.
The Three Voids receive my proclamation,
Myriad spirits heed with reverence.

In the time of Duke Zhuang of Chu, there was a market overseer named Song Yuanfu, a man of good heart who constantly swept the marketplace. After some time, a beggar appeared in the market, staying for a month. Each morning, he would beg while singing:
Heaven bestows the golden blossom,
The inner source reveals the hidden mystery.
Jade valleys join the mysterious realm,
Jasper and void mutually support.
The celestial Perfected stands above the sun,
Flying elixir spouts wondrous numen.
At dawn, press the celestial steed,
Wandering to the divine and mysterious abode.
The immortal enters the chamber,
Wiping away all demons.

Before leaving, he inscribed these words on the market gate. No one in the Chu marketplace understood them, but Yuanfu suddenly grasped their meaning and suspected the beggar was an immortal—though he did not comprehend the song’s purport. He knelt and earnestly entreated, persisting for a long time. The beggar finally told him: "I am indeed a Perfected One. These words are the Queen Mother of Kunlun’s *Precious Dao of Life Without Death*. Those who know it do not die." He then transmitted the essential and secret methods to Yuanfu. After twenty years of practice, Yuanfu ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Now he resides in the Dark Realm, holding the rank of Immortal Minister.

The beggar in the Chu marketplace was none other than the Perfected One of the Southern Marchmount, Red Pine, who had divided his form and spread his shadow to temporarily dwell in the dust and filth, wandering through the clamor and impurity to summon hidden encounters.

*The Pure Numinous Perfected One, Master Pei, on the Scripture of Divine Treasures*
To seek the essential Dao, first clarify the eyes and sharpen the ears, for they are the masters of all affairs. Moreover, the ears and eyes are the ladder to seek the Perfected and the gate to gather the numinous. Success and failure depend on them, and life and death are determined by them. Now this scripture is copied and presented for practical use.

*The Superior Chapter on Dispelling Demons* states:
Frequently press and restrain the ears on both sides, but do not overdo it—this is called "tending the city walls" and "inscribing the imperial register."
Also, frequently press the sides of the nose, but only in moderation—this is called "irrigating the central marchmount" and "inscribing the emperor’s records."
These two methods were spoken by Lady Li of the Illustrious Numen of Fangzhang Terrace on the night of the twelfth day of the ninth month.

The Dao says: Constantly press the small hollows behind the brows twenty-seven times. Also, rub the area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones with the palms and fingers, and pull the ears thirty times. Rub frequently without fixed times. Upon completion, stroke the forehead upward twenty-seven times, beginning between the brows and moving into the hairline. Swallow saliva as often as desired. Practicing this regularly will clarify the eyes day by day, and within a year, one may read at night. It may also be done discreetly at the philtrum without revealing the method.

The small hollows behind the brows are the mansion of the Upper Six Harmonies, governing the generation of eye radiance, the harmony and luster of essence and light, the preservation of the pupil’s clarity, and the refinement of the celestial orbs—this is the supreme Dao of the Perfected One’s rising and resting. It is also called *The Perfected One’s Constant Abiding Inner Scripture*.

The Perfected One sighed and said: "If you wish to read at night, constantly cultivate the *Constant Abiding*." The reason the Perfected One can observe all directions and illuminate the eight distant reaches is truly the clarity of the *Constant Abiding*’s methods.

The area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones is the chamber of decisive clarity, the returning-infancy supreme Dao. Pulling the ears is the art of deep illumination.

Thus, when the blood flows smoothly through the gates of regulation, no blemishes arise upon the skin, the eyes’ radiance shines darkly and profoundly, and harmony and spirit flourish in abundance. Now, when a person approaches old age, it seldom begins anywhere but in the ears and eyes. Moreover, the signs of aging in the body also first appear beside the outer corners of the eyes.

The secret of cultivating the true Dao lies in concentrating the spirit and settling the breath at dawn and dusk. After a long while, place the hands upon the forehead, inwardly visualize the infant, the dual luminaries of sun and moon, and the joy of the Upper Prime. Begin at the brows and count three cycles of nine, ceasing only when the count is complete. This is called *The Way of the Hands Paying Homage to the Three Primes to Fortify the Brain and Strengthen the Hair*.

Stroke the four sides of the head with the hands, smoothing the hair into place and gathering it together—only let it be done thoroughly. In this way, the blood of the head flows freely, and wind-dampness does not congeal. When all is complete, press the four corners of the eyes eighteen times, until the light is perceived with perfect clarity. This is the method for examining the spirit of the eyes. Practiced over time, it enables one to see the hundred spirits.

The *Red-Writing Scripture* states: "Often cover the mouth and nose with the hands, gaze intently through the eyes for a long while, and let fluid arise within the palms. Then use the hands to rub the face and eyes. Practicing this constantly will make the body fragrant."

The *Celestial Pass Jade Scripture of the Most High* states: "Often press the corners of the eyes near the nose with the hands, holding the breath while doing so. Cease when the qi flows through, then exhale and begin anew. Practicing this constantly will enable the eyes to perceive with penetrating clarity."

The two preceding passages were transmitted by Lady Wei of the Southern Peak.

The *Three-Five Sequential Practice Scripture of the Cinnabar-Writing Purple Book* states: "When sitting, close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera and the intestines and stomach. Practicing this over time will naturally bring clarity and distinctness."

The *Great Simplicity Scripture of the Cinnabar Radiance* states: "On the face, it is always desirable to rub with both hands until warm, following the contours up and down until thoroughly covered. This will give the face a lustrous glow and prevent wrinkles and blemishes. Practicing this for five years will make the complexion like that of a young maiden—this is what is meant by the qi of mountains and rivers flowing freely and remaining ever full without depletion."

The *Scripture of the Cinnabar Radiance* states: "First rub the two hands together until hot, then use them to wipe the face and eyes. Afterward, stroke the hair with the hands as if combing it. Alternate the two arms, rubbing them with the hands, to prevent the hair from turning white and the vessels from becoming superficial and enlarged."

The *Massage Section of the Essence and Radiance of the Great Cavern True Scripture* states: "When rising from bed, sit upright and regulate the breath. First clasp the hands together and raise them to cover the back of the neck. Then tilt the head back to look upward, straining the neck against the hands. Do this three or four times to harmonize the essence and circulate the blood, preventing the intrusion of wind-qi. Practicing this over time will prevent death and illness. Furthermore, bend and stretch the body, extend the hands to the four extremities, arch the back, and pull the sides, moving and shaking all the joints—each three times.

Upon rising, first use a handkerchief or thick cloth to wipe the mouth on all sides and behind the ears until thoroughly warm. Then stroke the head with the hands, smoothing the hair as if combing it, leaving no part untouched. After a long while, rub the two hands together and use them to tend to the face and eyes. Practiced over time, this will brighten the eyes and prevent evil qi from assailing them, keeping the body free from grime and grease, and dispelling filth. When all is complete, swallow the saliva thirty times to guide the inner fluids."

The preceding passage is from the *Essence and Radiance of the Great Cavern Scripture*.

The *Jade Scripture of Reversed Womb Massage of the Queen Mother of the West*, transcribed by Lady Purple Tenuity.

The Dao of nurturing life takes the ears and eyes as its foundation. Scattered vision dims the eyes, and excessive worry blocks the ears—these two afflictions arise from within and congeal into illness, not from external misfortunes invading from without.

What is called "the difficulty of hearing the Dao" does not lie in hearing the Dao itself, but in practicing it; yet even practicing the Dao is not so difficult as bringing it to completion. If the ears and eyes are disordered by stray thoughts and one does not dispel hardship, then even if one’s feet tread the halls of immortals and one’s hands grasp the dragon’s reins, it will still be of no benefit.

The Reversed Womb Massage should be performed regularly on yang days—the first day of the lunar month is a yang day. On the morning and night of each yang day, when lying in bed at night and upon awakening before rising in the morning, swiftly close the eyes and face the direction of one’s life destiny. Rub the two palms together until slightly warm, then use them to wipe and press the eyes and ear openings on both sides. Cross the hands so they meet at the nape of the neck, repeating this nine times. Next, visualize within each eye a cloud of three colors—purple, red, and yellow—each descending into the two ears. After a long while, recite the following incantation:

*"Triple clouds of the eye pupils, Radiant Lords of Vision,
Brilliant and luminous, they infuse essence,
Opening and connecting the divine spirits.
Great Mystery’s cloud insignia, Jade Numinosity’s unfolding scripture,
Guard and benefit the twin gates,
Unseal and penetrate the nine portals.
All joints respond in resonance,
Revolving fluids ascend to the Mud Pill.
The body ascends to the Jade Palace,
Ranked among the highest perfected."*

After the incantation, swallow the saliva three times, then open the eyes. Make this a regular practice; on yang days, whether sitting or rising, one may perform this at any time, not only at dawn and dusk. Practicing this for three years will sharpen the ears and brighten the eyes.

When combing the hair, always face the direction of one’s life destiny. At the start of combing, recite the following incantation:

*"Great Thearch disperses numinosity,
Five Elders return the spirit,
Mysterious flower of the Mud Pill,
Preserves essence and ensures its longevity.
On the left, the hidden moon is restrained;
On the right, the sun’s root is drawn.
The six harmonies refine and purify,
A hundred spirits receive grace."*

Perform this regularly to prevent head and brain pain.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate’s Verdant Efflorescence* states: When combing the hair, face the direction of one’s ruling earthly branch. At the start of combing, recite softly:

*"Mud Pill’s mysterious flower,
Preserves essence and ensures its longevity.
On the left, the hidden moon;
On the right, the sun’s root.
The six harmonies refine and purify,
A hundred spirits receive grace."*

After reciting, swallow the saliva three times. Practicing this regularly will prevent hair loss and stimulate new growth. Frequently change combs, using one with many teeth but without causing pain. One may also have an attendant comb the hair to ensure thoroughness, thereby preventing blood stasis and strengthening the hair roots.

The above two methods were taught by An Jiuhua for daily practice.

When sitting or lying down, always direct the nostrils toward one’s life destiny; the same applies when eating and drinking. If unable to face one’s life destiny, orienting toward the northeast or northwest is also beneficial, for these two directions are the gateways of heaven and earth’s hun and po souls.

Furthermore, when lying down, gently rock the body from side to side several dozen times. Then, pressing both hands behind, lift the head toward the sky and rock left and right twenty-one times. Afterward, sit upright, raise the hands toward heaven, and remain so for a long while. Next, rub the palms together and wipe the eyes, extending the motion to the ears, and pause again for

The Supreme Primordial of the Great Origin, the Purple Heaven of the Nine Capitals, governs the hun-soul and protects life—O Lofty and Pure Perfected One. I don the supreme method and receive the teachings of the Great Mystery. May I attain long life and enduring vision, my body ascending as an immortal. May the tombs remain eternally at peace, the gates of ghostly litigation sealed. May my hun and po souls be harmonious and joyful, evil qi dispersed like smoke. Should demonic spirits, wangliang, or any malevolent beings dare offend my spirit, may the Northern Emperor rebuke and restrain them, drawing their qi into the abyss. May I be recorded in the registers of the Supreme Sovereign and reverently presented to the Jade Dawn.

Recite this invocation twice, then knock the teeth together three times, and the dreams of tombs and deceased household spirits shall no longer recur. This is the Northern Emperor’s secret prayer; those of sincere and virtuous intent may all practice it. For those frequently afflicted by inauspicious dreams, this method may be applied, thereby vanishing ghostly qi and scattering evil spirits.

If the arms fail to move, it is due to wind-toxin qi lodged within the meridians, binding and numbing the bones. Acupuncture and moxibustion are fitting remedies, and the Northern Emperor’s prayer of bending and turning may also be employed. If practiced a hundred times, the illness will dissipate. First, gently massage the afflicted arm with one hand for a long while. Then, close the eyes, inwardly gaze, swallow saliva three times, and knock the teeth together three times. Silently recite:

Supreme Four Mysteries, Five Flowers and Six Courts, Three Hun and Seven Po, Heavenly Pass and Earthly Essence, Divine Palace

This incantation also reverses inauspicious dreams, transforming them into auspicious omens. The above was revealed by the Lady of Right Radiance on the night of the thirteenth day of the eleventh month.

The celestial patterns and numinous pivot are the destinations of those who attain penetrating insight. With a heart serene and luminous, the spirit savors the void, chewing and absorbing the Supreme Harmony. The body’s qi becomes pure and boundless, whereupon jade chimes resound, and the myriad sounds are silently summoned.

Qi is the vessel and artisan of spirit and illumination, the primordial abyss of purity and turbidity. Abiding in the mysterious, Heaven becomes clear; dwelling within the person, the body endures. Life and death, waxing and waning—all proceed from the art of nurturing and guiding.

To practice the Six Qi Absorption, always face the northeast at dawn, during the *chou* and *yin* hours, for this is when Heaven’s seasons begin. One must align with this direction at this time. As the rosy glow of the Great Auroral Division arises and the Cinnabar Sun gives birth to light, the numinous radiance dawns, and the Vermilion Essence begins to shine.

First, visualize the sun as an egg within the Mud Pill Palace. Then exhale one breath, imagining the qi as black—this is called the Corpse Qi. Next, exhale a second breath, visualizing the qi as white—this is the Old Qi. Then exhale a third breath, imagining the qi as gray—this is the Death Qi. Each exhalation should be prolonged. Having expelled these three colors, one has thus exhaled the Six Qi.

Afterward, slowly inhale the Yellow Qi four times. Upon completion, swallow saliva three times—this constitutes one full cycle. Then visualize the sun within the Mud Pill Palace ascending and emerging from the eyes, positioning itself nine inches before the face. Gaze inward as if seeing it, then inhale the Red Qi seven times. After seven inhalations, swallow saliva three times and cease. Rise and sit, moving and stretching the four limbs, bending and extending to harmonize the joints and meridians. This completes the practice.

When visualizing and swallowing saliva, ensure it appears green. At night, one may also visualize the moon within the Mud Pill Palace, following the same method as for the sun. For lunar visualization, the period from the first night to the fifteenth day of the month is optimal. From the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the moon’s qi wanes, and the Celestial Embryo contracts—do not visualize the moon at night during this time.

This method is supremely subtle. Those who practice it become immortals, for it enables the refinement of prenatal breathing, the cultivation of luminous perfection, the summoning of the Five Swallows, and the attainment of natural harmony. The hun-soul returns to the Crimson Mansion, and the po-soul retreats to the Mud Pill Palace—thus is longevity achieved. How could this compare to grasping the yin qi of dark valleys, seeking the swift spirits of galloping steeds, traversing the sea in search of passage, or driving a feathered carriage upon a volcano? Be cautious, be most cautious!

The above is from *The West Queen Mother’s Narrative Instructions*.

On the night of the fourth day of the seventh month in the third year of the Xingning era (Yichou), the Lord of Life, Eastern Minister, descended with seven attendants. One bore a purple bannered staff, another a floral pennant, one held the Ten Absolute Numinous Sashes, another carried a satchel of inscribed talismans, and three bore a white ivory box—within it appeared to be books. One attendant grasped a flowing-gold fire bell, and all were clad in vermilion robes. The Lord of Life appeared far younger than his two brothers, wearing a green brocade embroidered skirt, a purple feathered cloak, and a hibiscus crown. His two brothers accompanied him, standing in attendance until bidden to sit. They conversed at length.

On the night of the sixth day of the seventh month, the Lord of Life descended again. After a long while, he instructed in writing: "If one must model oneself upon the mysterious and uphold the image, maintaining purity and stillness in rare moments, then one may transcend the hidden depths, fold one’s wings, and nest in lofty seclusion. By savoring the profound and tasting the sublime, one’s spirit harmonizes with the highest. Like a still pool or a towering peak, one delves into the jade scriptures, playing with treasures to quicken the spirit. Abandoning worldly attachments, one tunes the zither of pure numen, clarifying the luminous within the void. The Five Ways become manifest, and form dissolves into the waves of transformation. Desires merge with the insipid, and the empty and obscure thoroughfare becomes a realm of no seeing, no hearing. Only then may one ascend to the subtle perfection of the true, reawakening the mysterious awareness. With inner virtue rounded and outer numinous signs fulfilled, one may at last drive the cloud chariot to the heavens and inscribe the Lord of Life’s cinnabar register.

Yet if one’s essence scatters amidst a myriad thoughts, life cannot be firmly rooted. If qi follows the dusty waves and the heart does not dwell in truth, one merely wearies body and spirit among the groves and peaks—truly, this is a grievous error before enlightenment. The Way is subtle yet easy to seek, yet arduous and difficult to attain."

At midnight on the fifth day of the lunar month, visualize the solar orb within the heart, drawing the sun in through the mouth so that its light illumines the heart’s interior. When its radiance merges with the sun’s, you will feel warmth in the heart and a rosy glow suffusing the body. After this union, recite the invocation:

*"Great luminosity nurtures essence,
Within, the cinnabar heart is refined.
Light and radiance merge as one—
Divine spirits come seeking."*

Upon completion, swallow saliva nine times.

Repeat this practice on the fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-ninth days of the month. Through this, the adept gains clarity and keen perception, all senses become fresh and lucid, the face radiates jade-like luster, and the body gleams with golden sheen. After five years of practice, the Supreme Unity will dispatch a jeweled chariot to welcome the adept, ascending to the Great Empyrean. While frequent practice is essential, it need not be confined to these specific days.

The above method is recorded in the *Scripture on Dispelling Demons*, from the inner teachings of the Red Lord of the Southern Prison.

It further states: When partaking of meals, avoid speaking of death or exposing food, lest malevolent qi gather. Bathe frequently, and on each *jiazi* day, perform a full ablution; if not, do so at the start of each month to attain spiritual communion. The obstacle is not the frequency of bathing, but the practitioner’s inability to persist. By washing away the stench of the corpse, true qi enters the body.

The above was commanded by the Mystic Master, Lady Wei, for practical application.

The *Scripture of the Nine Transformations and Ten Transmutations for Renewal* states: When treading upon filth or contentious places, first perform a ritual bath to purify the body and dispel impurities. The method employs ten ounces of bamboo leaves and four ounces of peeled white peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water in a cauldron, ensuring it does not boil over. Once cooled to a suitable temperature, use the water to bathe, and all defilements will dissolve. This not only removes impurities but also prevents dampness, numbness, sores, and itching.

Bamboo is hollow, plain, and inwardly white, while peach repels evil and expels filth—hence these two substances are used to cleanse the body’s impurities. When celestial beings descend to the mortal realm and return, they invariably use this water for self-purification. Compared to worldly talismanic waters, incantations, or external rinses, this method is unparalleled. While bathing with it is most effective, it should not be used for washing the hair. This refined essence for refining the corpse is precisely suited for bathing the body—a truly wondrous and secret technique.

The above was commanded by the Lady of the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mystic Dragon Feather Court for practical use.

On the tenth, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh days of each month, at the hour of *ren ding* (night’s stillness), gaze at the mouth of the Northern Dipper and behold the great star within. Then, addressing the Celestial Master and Libationer, bow twice and declare:

*"Your servant [Name], kowtowing in reverence, humbly petitions for transmission, beseeching the gift of longevity."*

At dusk, press the corners of the eyes and visualize the divine light, ensuring it shines with a radiant red-yellow hue—this is auspicious. Never forget this practice. Though the body is one, the spirits are myriad; they must not be disordered.

Before sleep, meditate upon the body’s spirits; upon rising, do the same. These are the three methods.

The above is recorded in the *Essentials of the Dao*.

At the first crow of the rooster, before rising, first bend the left hand to lick the salt from the finger, then extend the right hand to gaze at the salted finger, rubbing them together while reciting:

*"The daughter of the Queen Mother of the West is named Yi Yu. She bestows upon me the cinnabar elixir, which I receive into my mouth, accumulating essence to polish my form."*

At every cock’s crow, swallow saliva twice seven times to dispel the dimness of the eyes, drawing forth their radiant essence so that one’s vision may penetrate ten thousand *li* and perceive all four directions. After swallowing saliva twice seven times, rub the eyes with the fingers twice seven times to prevent drowsiness—this is what is meant by *"spitting on the hands and rubbing the eyes with Yang Brightness."*

The above is recorded in the *Nine Capitals*.

Next, tap the teeth, sounding the drum of the Heavenly Gate thirty-six times. Then swish the divine springwater and swallow it three times—this is called *"sounding the Heavenly Drum"* and visualizes the myriad spirits of the body.

The above is recorded in various texts.

Upon rising at dawn, sit facing east. Rub the hands together until warm, then rub the forehead upward to the top of the head, repeating this eighteen times—this is called *"Muddy Pellet."* Next, rub the hands together again until warm, then rub the face, passing into the hairline three times. If one can thoroughly rub the entire body, it is even better—this is called *"Dry Bathing."*

Next, after rubbing the hands and touching the forehead, clasp the ears with the hands and pull them upward and downward fourteen times to ensure lifelong hearing. Then, contracting the nose and holding the breath, use the right hand to pull the left ear from above the head fourteen times, then the left hand to pull the right ear fourteen times—this grants longevity.

When dressing, one should don the belt facing *wu-ji*. For example:
- During the *jia-xu* decade, face *yin*;
- During the *jia-yin* decade, face *wu*;
- During the *jia-shen* decade, face *zi*;
- During the *jia-wu* decade, face *xu*;
- During the *jia-chen* decade, face *shen*;
- During the *jia-zi* decade, face *chen*.

This is what is meant by *"donning the belt facing* wu-ji*"* to remain perpetually free from cold.

When walking, always step forward first with the left foot while saying *"Qian,"* then with the right foot while saying *"Yuan,"* then with the left foot while saying *"Heng,"* then with the right foot while saying *"Li,"* and finally with the left foot while saying *"Zhen."* This completes the sequence—it is called *"Walking the Qian-Yuan."*

When making a request, state your name aloud:
*"Left-aligned spirit, right-aligned spirit, Earth Controller of Destiny, Azure Lady, sever [Name]’s entry in the register of death. Gatekeeper Lord, grant this to the Lady."*

If assent is given, repeat it quietly, ensuring the voice does not carry too far.

When relieving oneself, face the direction of the Six *Ding*. For example:
- During the *jia-zi* decade, face *ding-mao* (east);
- During the *jia-xu* decade, face *chou*;
- During the *jia-shen* decade, face *hai*;
- During the *jia-wu* decade, face *you*;
- During the *jia-chen* decade, face *wei*;
- During the *jia-yin* decade, face *si*.

This is what is meant by *"facing the Six Ding when relieving oneself."*

The above eight methods are recorded in the *Scripture of Spontaneity*.

Before eating or drinking, first state your name and declare:
*"I establish my body as the Dao, my body as the Heavenly Repository. Dao Father, Dao Mother, Perfected Ones, Immortals, Divine Ones, Sages—I join with you in this meal. Divine youths and jade maidens attend at my left, holding my immortal register, granting me boundless life."*

The above is recorded in the *Essentials of the Dao*.

**Method for Absorbing the Essence of the Sun and Moon:**
On the first day of the lunar month, when the sun has risen three *zhang* high, gaze toward it, clench the fists, and perform the *Yu Step*. From afar, draw in the sun’s essence with the mouth twenty-four times and swallow it. If three people enter a plague-stricken household in this manner, no illness will afflict those accompanying them. Practicing this regularly ensures longevity.

On the third day of the lunar month, when the moon rises in the *geng* position, clench the fists, walk southwest, face the moon, perform the *Yu Step*, and from afar draw in the moon’s essence with the mouth twenty-four times, swallowing it. This ensures a year free from illness. It also allows one to enter households of the deceased, for the sun and moon illuminate all impurities.

The above two methods—*"eating the sun and drinking the moon"*—dissolve all *qi*.

*"Born together with the Dao, dwelling with the spirits in the same hall, Perfected One [Name], who dares speak of my demise?"*
Recite this when the ears ring.

*"Dwelling with the Dao, sharing a chamber with the spirits, Perfected One [Name], may my lifespan match heaven and earth."*
Recite this at the first cock’s crow.

*"Sharing a chamber with the Dao, sharing merit with the spirits, Perfected One [Name], may my lifespan unite with heaven and earth."*
Recite this at the second cock’s crow.

When traveling at night, invoke *"Heavenly Peng"* to stand before you and repel tigers and wolves.

Recite this when walking at night.

At dawn and dusk, face north. First visualize the *qi* of the five viscera:
- The *qi* of the liver as true blue,
- The *qi* of the heart as true red,
- The *qi* of the lungs as true white,
- The *qi* of the kidneys as true black,
- The *qi* of the spleen as true yellow.

Once the *qi* of the five viscera is settled, tap the teeth thirty-six times and recite:
*"Heavenly Peng, Heavenly Peng, Nine Origins Slaying Youth, Five Ding Controllers, Gao Diao Northern Duke, Seven Governors Eight Spirits, Supreme One Dispels Misfortune, Long-Skulled Giant Beast, Grasping the Emperor’s Bell, White Owl of the Three Mornings, Sternly Driving the Kui Dragon Chariot, Mighty Sword Divine King, Slaying Demons and Erasing Traces, Purple Qi Riding the Sky, Cinnabar Clouds Blazing Forth, Devouring Demons and Consuming Ghosts, Body Transverse Drinking the Wind, Azure Tongue Green Teeth, Four-Eyed Old Man, Heavenly Ding Warriors, Mighty South Warding Off Misfortune, Heavenly Couriers Rousing Fury, Mighty North Biting the Blade, Three Hundred Thousand Soldiers, Guarding My Ninefold Gates, Repelling Corpses a Thousand *Li* Away, Further Dispelling Inauspiciousness. Should any petty ghost dare approach to harm me, seize the Heavenly Great Axe and sever the five forms of ghosts. The Fiery Emperor scorches their blood, the Northern Emperor burns their bones, the Four Brightnesses shatter their skeletons, Heavenly Strategy annihilates their kind. With a single stroke of the divine blade, ten thousand ghosts scatter."*

Recite this incantation to ward off ghosts, tapping the teeth once for every four lines.

All ghosts under heaven submit in awe. Should any seek to harm you, they will vanish upon hearing this incantation. The Great Demon of the Northern Emperor constantly fears this prayer. Those who regularly employ it may traverse the world unopposed, with gods and ghosts submitting in obedience.

Do not recklessly reveal the existence of this incantation method; keep it secret and practice it diligently.

The master’s oral instructions state: If the body is not pure and refined, one must not lightly perform the incantation rites. You ought to be cautious of this.

Regularly at cock’s crow, clench the fists, raise the Celestial Pillar, and tap the teeth twice seven times. Envision the Twelve Parent Deities encircling the head, the Twenty-Four Divine Persons arrayed upon the body, and the Twenty-Four Sages surrounding the earth beneath you. Then, press the left heel against the anus, clench the fists tightly once more, curl the tongue back toward the throat, hold the breath, and visualize the Kingly *qi* before you. Envision all the gods of heaven and earth, the spirits of mountains and rivers, the Five Peaks, and all living beings coming to pay homage to you—from heaven to earth, none dare not tremble in submission. Only then release the breath.

*Right: The Great One’s Celestial Encompassing Prohibition.*

The *po* soul by day resides beneath the left eye, and at dusk beneath the nose in the philtrum. Regularly at dawn and dusk, press with the second finger of the right hand three times while softly reciting:

The seven *po* are refined and purified,
Unmoving and unyielding,
Ever conjoined with the three *hun*,
Concealed within the Imperial Court.
They preserve harmony of the Three Origins,
Communing with the true and penetrating the numinous.
All misfortune vanishes,
And I attain longevity,
Becoming a Perfected One,
Ascending to the Celestial Court.

*Right: The Great One’s Method for Restraining the Seven *Po*.* Practice this regularly, and the three *hun* will be guarded, the seven *po* will remain at peace, and death shall never come. Perform this without others witnessing.

When entering a purification chamber or sacred space, first expel and dispel ghosts and illnesses. Guard against all trials, then relax the inner palace and recite, facing north and tapping the teeth thirty-six times. Softly address the Jade Clarity’s Resplendent Primordial Sovereign:

The Great Demon Kings of the Six Heavens,
Bound in the desolate void,
Giant beasts of crimson armor,
Poisonous dragons with four throats,
White rats howling upward,
Brandishing claws and shaking bristles,
Myriad spirits lurking in darkness—
Vanquish evil and shatter demons.
The Heavenly Soldiers are as one,
The Five Peaks pay homage.
Wind and fire launch their assault,
The Nine Heavens fan the whirlwind.
Behold!

Then, straighten the spine, close the eyes, refine the countenance and essence, harmonize the Three Palaces, and visualize the Six Courts. The Imperial Lord holds court, his ministers and aides all radiant. Harmonize the *qi* and fluids, pay homage to the Nine Numinous Ones, the Five Spirits rest in succession, the springs of saliva overflow, the White Prime awakens the true, the Dark Flower spreads its life. The cavernous radiance shines in secret, the Four Powers are balanced, the inner treasure gleams brightly. Sing and delight in the Cavernous Clarity, the Primal Simplicity arrays its charts, and longevity shall never falter.

On one’s natal day or in places where the heart trembles, close the passes and refine the thoughts, tap the teeth thrice, regulate the breath, face north, and softly intone:

*Roluona chao, Fangnai guanlian,*
*Banmu bo dui, Danmo ju she,*
*Hecha bai shu, Danli da mo,*
*Zhenfu guangfu, Xuling zhi xiao,*
*Zonglan jixiong, Fa dong chang you,*
*Wumian zhongpin, Lingkuo fan tiao,*
*Baifang qian tu, Moneng huo liao,*
*Tiandi qidu, Shu yun neng diao.*

*Right: These two passages are from the* Incantations of the *Jade Register of the Eight Luminaries of the Cavernous Realms of Golden Mystery.* Do not recite them lightly; be cautious.

For extreme cold: Inhale through the nose, swallow the *qi* thrice without exhaling, and cease once the *qi* is drawn in.

For extreme heat: Inhale through the nose, swallow the *qi* twice slowly, first drawing in through the nose, then exhaling through the mouth. The heat will subside.

*Right: These two passages are from the* Scripture of Qi Circulation by Master Huang.

At that time, eighty-five thousand vajra spirits acted as Dharma protectors, subduing the minds of both the hidden and the manifest, and spoke this incantation:

Lightning fire illumines the void,
Divine radiance brightens the obscure.
Poisonous dragons crouch at the four quarters,
Spiritual tigers encircle the eight directions.
The headscarf bears the Seven Stars,
The feet tread upon Dipper and Ox.
The divine blade arrays the constellations,
The golden hook gleams with essence.
The foremost wields mighty soldiers,
Striding through the void.
Sever the center of demonic evil,
Annihilate the wandering spirits below.
Tear out the liver, extract the gall,
Invert the intestines, sever the vessels.
Cut left, strike right,
Boil and decapitate the rear.
Sever the root of demonic *qi*,
Bind and restrain all grudges.
The ghost-eating messengers,
Crush and devour them alive.
Sorcerers and shamans with drums and songs,
Drinking blood and eating flesh,
Foul of form and stinking of bone,
*Wangliang* spirits overturned.
Rank and filthy, base and vile,
Hearts and forms full of flattery and slander.
The divine pestle shatters their skulls,
The golden blade slits their bellies.
Those who conceal evil and hide harm,
Suddenly submit.
In the left hand, the golden talisman,
In the right, the ledger of sins.
The Great One’s golden bell,
The Jade Emperor’s jade scepter.
Those who know their faults yet do not reform,
Hang their heads and sever themselves.
What demon does not perish?
What spirit does not vanish?
The Six Spirits do not hide,
The Seven Stars spill blood.
Above, the Heavenly Master,
Below, the vajras.
Together they subdue the *qi*,
Mouths spewing divine radiance.
Drink from the Cinnabar Pool,
Feed upon the Mysterious Frost.
The Five Viscera bloom with flowers,
Abiding forever, unending.

At that time, the Great Ghost King with four eyes and a body like lightning, together as Dharma protectors, dispelled inauspiciousness, guarded the ritual space, detected deceit and corrected faults, subdued evil men and all external paths, and those lacking faith. They spoke this incantation:

Divine wind sweeps away dust,
Uprooting the roots of evil.
The Six Heavens lose their essence,
The Five Poisons perish their grudges.
Golden head and iron teeth,
Devouring ghosts and vanishing souls.
Peach light arrays the doors,
Twin luminaries shine upon the gates.
Shooting stars and killing *qi*,
Radiant and fearless.
The hundred vessels flow like rivers,
The seven meridians are regulated.
The spirit is at peace, the body is balanced,
Abiding forever, undying.

*Right: These two incantations are from the* Supreme Jade Clarity Scripture*, Chapter Seven, "The Dao Transforms the Four Barbarians."*

The *Hymn of the Fengdu Palace* states:

Zhou’s end marks the divine emperor,
In truth, affairs meet heavy calamity.
Flaming like smoke in the sky,
Bursting like radiant blossoms.
Wucheng girds the divine blade,
Serene illumination swallows the Clear River.
The Gate of Heaven overlooks the Cinnabar Well,
Cloud Gate looms precipitously.
The Seven Wrongs connect to the wondrous canopy,
Linked and winding, they spread demons.
The Six Heavens cross the northern path—
This is the abode of ghosts and spirits.

These are the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces. Reciting them dispels ghostly and demonic influences.

Silent communion conveys inspired feeling,
Mysterious *qi* stirs the resonant tone.
Though the lofty wheel is uneven,
From ten thousand fathoms, they still come seeking.
The diligent Daoist disciples,
Harmonizing spirit and contracting the numinous lapel,
Surrender to the transformations of the floating world,
The heart’s standard planted in the secluded forest.
Together we await the journey beyond principle,
And with one another, still the eastern peak.

Here the heart’s longing is expressed,
its karmic bonds conveyed.
Commanding the chariot to vast Feng E,
free traces transcend the nether realm.
In emptiness, things exist of themselves;
within existence, nothing remains constant.
Realizing the words at the boundary of being and non-being,
together we meet at the Hao Bridge.
The eye perceives, the profound understanding dawns—
the principles of ghosts and spirits are forgotten of themselves.

This discourse concerns the subtle essence of humans and ghosts.

Mount Luofeng lies in the northern *gui* region, its height two thousand six hundred *li*, its circumference thirty thousand *li*. Beneath the mountain lies a grotto-heaven, its circumference fifteen thousand *li*. Both above and below, ghostly and divine palaces stand. On the mountain are six palaces; within the grotto, six more—each palace spanning a thousand *li* in circumference. These are the Six Heavenly Palaces of ghosts and spirits.

The palaces above the mountain are the outer courts; those within the grotto, the inner courts—their systems are the same.

The first is the Zhōu Jué Yīn Heavenly Palace;
the second, the Tài Shā Liàng Shì Zōng Heavenly Palace;
the third, the Míng Chén Nài Fàn Wǔ Chéng Heavenly Palace;
the fourth, the Tián Zhào Zuì Qì Heavenly Palace;
the fifth, the Zōng Líng Qī Fēi Heavenly Palace;
the sixth, the Gǎn Sī Lián Wǎn Lǚ Heavenly Palace.

Reciting these Six Heavenly Palaces, one then knocks the teeth six times and lies down—warding off all ghostly and demonic *qi*.

When the worthy and the sages depart this world, they first pass through the third, the Míng Chén Heavenly Palace, to receive their affairs. Fortune and misfortune, good and ill, all life’s transgressions and harms, are governed by the fourth, the Tián Zhào Heavenly Palace, where the Lord of the Northern Dipper presides.

The ghostly officials intone:

I am a disciple of the Most High, governing below the Six Heavens. The officials of the Six Heavens are under my command—not merely under my command, but under the dominion of the Most High. I know the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces, and thus attain long life. Should any dare to transgress, the Most High shall sever your form.

*(From the fifth scroll of* Zhen’gao Chan Youwei: *Elucidating the Subtle and Obscure.)*

Here ends the *Essential Jade Instructions of the Three Perfected Ones of Highest Clarity*.
