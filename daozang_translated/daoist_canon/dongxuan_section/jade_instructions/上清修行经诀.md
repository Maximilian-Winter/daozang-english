**Upper Clarity Scripture on Cultivation Practices**

**Method for Restraining the Three Hun-Souls**
*Excerpted from the* Upper Scripture: *Numinous Writ in Purple Characters*

The Daoist adept must first restrain and regulate the hun and po souls, eliminating corpse-demons. On the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new moon, and on the days of *gengshen* and *jiayin*, one should enter seclusion in purity, bathe to cleanse the dust, and sit upright upon the mat. Those who remain sleepless gain greater benefit. With a brush of cinnabar, mark beneath the outer canthus of the left eye; with a brush of realgar, mark beneath the right nostril, allowing the pigment to slightly enter the nasal cavity.

Upon completing the markings, strike the teeth three times and recite the incantation:
*"The twin luminants take flight in coils,
Cinnabar and realgar scatter mist.
Qi seizes the hollow and perverse,
Corpse-filth sinks into oblivion.
Harmonizing the hun, refining the po,
Uniting form with the great spirit.
Grant me undying life,
Eternal wholeness and perfection.
Clarity of sight, penetrating vision—
Enduring prosperity, constancy, and purity."*

Conclude by striking the teeth three more times, swallowing saliva thrice, and with the second finger of the right hand, press the left eye’s outer canthus seven times; with the second finger of the left hand, press beneath the right nostril seven times. Press firmly without lifting the hand—thus is the practice complete.

These two points are the gateways through which the seven *po* souls and wandering corpses roam, the bridges by which demonic spirits and perverse influences traverse. Thus, they receive the essence of cinnabar and realgar, sealing the paths of corpse-demons and fumigating the chaotic qi of the twin luminants with their radiance.

This is a supreme method of the Great Ultimate. By practicing it regularly, the hun and po souls attain harmony, corpse-filth disperses entirely, and one achieves longevity as a divine immortal, penetrating vision, and communion with the numinous. After three years of practice, desire for sensual beauty vanishes entirely.

These days are called the "Days of Strife Between Corpse and Demon." Men and women must not share the same seat—beware of this.

Whenever studying the profound Dao or reciting sacred scriptures, after every ten or twenty words, lick the lips and swallow saliva three times. After every hundred or fifty words, strike the teeth two or three times to summon the spirits and unite with the numinous, pacifying and harmonizing the blood and qi. Thus, the numinous fluid congeals in fullness, and the Celestial Unity delights in its abode—this is what is meant by "the qi flows effortlessly, tranquil yet unexhausted."

In all cases, Daoist practitioners must not weep tears or emit seminal fluid, for this dissipates the vital fluids and drains the essence, severely depleting the throat and brain. Thus, true persons and Daoist practitioners constantly practice exhalation and inhalation, swallowing saliva to harmonize the six fluids.

Daoist practitioners should always visualize their own form, making it vividly present before them, so that their face is perpetually illumined by the light of the sun and moon, fully illuminating their entire body. Place the sun to the left and the moon to the right, nine inches from the face. Upon completing the visualization, tap the teeth three times and recite the incantation:

*"Primal Origin, Supreme Perfection,
Twin Radiance, Twofold Mystery,
Bind the seven po on the right,
Bind the three hun on the left,
Let my spirit and luminosity
Abide eternally with my form."*

Afterward, tap the teeth twenty-one times and swallow saliva seven times. This is called the *"Method of the Celestial Lord for Preserving Form, Binding the Hun, and Restraining the Po,"* which grants one clarity, transcendence, and immortality. If unable to recite the incantation, one may simply perform the visualization.

On the third and thirteenth evenings of the lunar month, at this very hour, the three *hun* become unsettled, drifting and wandering. *Shuangling* roams freely, *Taiguang* releases its form, and *Youjing* stirs and calls. *Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, and *Youjing* are the names of the three *hun* spirits. On these evenings, they abandon the body and roam, swiftly returning to their original abode—or they may be detained by other wandering spirits, captured by spectral entities, or prevented from returning, causing the form to disperse. They may also clash with external spirits, as the two *qi* engage in battle, agitating the inner child and inducing stray thoughts, leaving the heart sorrowful and the mind distressed. Students must bind and retain them to prevent their escape.

The method for binding and retaining them is as follows: Lie calmly facing upward, place a pillow beneath the head, stretch out the legs, and cross the hands over the heart. Close the eyes, hold the breath for three cycles, and tap the teeth three times. Visualize a red *qi* like an egg rising from within, emerging through the eyes. As it exits, the red *qi* expands, enveloping the body and flowing downward, reaching the head and neck, where it transforms into fire, engulfing the entire body inside and out, as if burning like charcoal. Once complete, a slight warmth should be felt within. Then, tap the teeth three times and call the names of the three *hun*: *Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, *Youjing*—commanding them to halt at once. Softly recite the incantation:

*"Great Tenuity, Mysterious Palace,
Verdant Prime of the Central Yellow,
Refine the three hun within,
Let Taiguang rest in peace,
Spirit-treasure of the Jade Chamber,
Born with me, abide as one,
Do not stir recklessly,
Witnessed by the Supreme Numinosity.
If you wish to soar,
Only ascend to the Great Ultimate and Upper Clarity.
If you hunger or thirst,
Only drink the Jade Essence of Returning Waters."*

Thus concludes the method.

**Method for Restraining the Seven Po (II)**
From the *Scripture of Purple Texts*

On the evenings of the new moon, full moon, and dark moon, at this hour, the seven *po* drift and wander, roaming through filth and impurity. They may consort with blood offerings, interact with ghosts and specters, or merge with corpses, entering and exiting together. They may seduce the inner child, gather in licentiousness to assail the dwelling, or report a person’s sins to the Three Officials and the River Earl. They may transform into *wangliang*, causing people to be afflicted by malevolent spirits, or lead ghosts into the body, summoning evil to slay the essence. All manner of ailments and afflictions in the living arise from the transgressions of the *po*. They delight in human death, desire human ruin, and hasten human downfall—such is the nature of the *po*. Daoist practitioners must restrain, refine, suppress, and subdue them.

The first *po* is called *Corpse Hound*, the second *Crouching Arrow*, the third *Yin Sparrow*, the fourth *Swallowing Thief*, the fifth *Vile Poison*, the sixth *Expelling Filth*, and the seventh *Fetid Lung*. These are the yin names of the seven *po*, the impure spirits within the body.

The method for restraining and regulating them is as follows: Cross the hands over the neck, hold the breath seven times, and tap the teeth seven times. Visualize a white *qi* like a small bean at the tip of the nose, gradually expanding to envelop the body in nine layers, descending to the feet and ascending to the head. Once complete, the white *qi* suddenly transforms into celestial beasts: two Azure Dragons in the eyes, facing outward; two White Tigers in the nostrils, also facing outward; a Vermilion Bird above the heart, facing the mouth; a Dark Tortoise beneath the left foot; a Numinous Serpent beneath the right foot; and in each ear, a Jade Maiden clad in black brocade, standing at the ear’s entrance, each holding a flame in hand. After a long while, swallow saliva seven times and tap the teeth seven times, calling the names of the seven *po*. Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Nine Cycles of Pristine Qi,
Subdue the po’s malevolence,
Celestial Beasts guard the gates,
Maidens of Radiance hold the passes,
Refine the po to harmony,
Abide with me in peace,
Do not stir recklessly,
Observe the origin of form.
If you hunger or thirst,
Permitted to drink the Yellow of the Moon and the Cinnabar of the Sun."*

Thus concludes the method. Thereupon, the seven *po* are inwardly restrained, bound to their posts, and submit to control. If practiced regularly, the turbidity of the *po* dissipates downward, returning to goodness and dwelling within the form, ascending to harmonize with the Three Officials and unite with the primordial spirit.

**Method for Dispelling Nightmares (III)**
From the *Scripture of the Feminine One and the Five Elders*

If one frequently encounters nightmares, they fall into three categories: the first is *White Specter*, the second is *Heart Trial*, and the third is *Corpse Thief*. To dispel and dissolve them, upon awakening from the dream, press the philtrum with the left hand thirty-four times, tap the teeth thirty-four times, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Great Cavern, True Mystery,
Zhang refines the three hun:
The first hun swiftly guards the seven po,
The second hun swiftly guards the Muddy Pellet,
The third hun receives the heart’s command,
Swiftly summon the Three Lords of Pristine Tenuity.
Facing an inauspicious dream,
It is the seven po’s wandering corpse that conspires,
The source of ten thousand evils.
Hasten to call Taokang to protect life,
Report above to the Celestial Lord,
The Five Elders and Nine Perfected,
All guard the gates of the body.
The Yellow Gate Divine Master,
The Purple Portal General,
Grasp iron and hold bells,
Crush and annihilate evil spirits,
Turn misfortune to fortune,
Sever ties with life and death."*

Thus concludes the method.

Once completed, should you lie down again, you shall surely receive a favorable response. As for the malevolent qi that once formed the inauspicious dream, it will be sealed beneath the Celestial Pass. After three years, only when the spirit responds to the decree will dreams occur—yet every dream will be known and seen, revealing the clarity of what is to come. No longer will there be ill omens or inauspicious thoughts.

If you encounter a propitious dream at night, it is a fortunate sign. Should you dream and feel in your heart that it is auspicious, it is indeed a blessed omen. Upon waking, rub your eyes thirty-four times, tap your teeth thirty-four times, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Lofty Essence,
Three Emperors’ Cinnabar Spirit,
The Crimson Palace shines clear,
Auspicious omens reveal their truth.
The Three Primes guard the po,
The Celestial Sovereign imparts the scripture,
All you face shall align,
Ascend as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,
Ever with the Jade Perfected,
Together in the Purple Court."*

Thus concludes the secret method of the Great Cavern, transmitted to those who first wade into the stream.

**Method for Auspicious Dreams (4)**
Also from the *Scripture of the Five Elders*

Whenever a scholar dreams of a woman dressed in purple silk, bearing a tray of food, accept and eat it without fear. This food consists entirely of treasures from the Eastern Sea or rare herbs from the Five Peaks of Mount Song, the consumption of which may extend one’s lifespan.

Whenever a Daoist rests during the day, first press the four corners of the eyes with both hands thirty-four times, then tap the teeth thirty-four times before lying down.

Whenever a Daoist retires at dusk, press the two nostrils with the left hand thirty-four times, then tap the teeth thirty-four times before lying down.

---

**Method for Peaceful Slumber (5)**
From the *Upper Scripture: Yellow Plain Scripture of Forty-Four Methods*

When a Daoist is about to sleep, stroke the heart three times with the hand, close the eyes, and recite:

*"Great Spirit of the Nine Palaces,
The Great One guards the chamber,
A hundred spirits assume their stations,
Hun and po harmonize as one,
To live long without dying,
Sealing away evil and misfortune."*

Then sleep.

---

**Method to Subdue Ghosts and Demons (6)**
From the *Jade Clarity Scripture for Dispelling Demons*

Whenever a Daoist travels alone and lodges in a place haunted by demonic spirits or malevolent ghosts, tap the left teeth thirty-six times, hold the breath, and softly recite:

*"Supreme Yang of the Great Emperor,
Four Nether Gates of the Dark Pass,
A thousand demons, ten thousand poisons—
Dare they stand before me?
Mighty beasts with crushing jaws,
Rending bellies and severing livers,
Divine envoys and messengers,
Guard and patrol the encampment,
Yellow-robed master-soldiers,
Slay and behead demonic hun,
Annihilate a thousand demons,
Crush and cast down the wicked,
Eradicate their kind, extinguish their lineage,
Seize and decapitate them,
By the command of the Jade Emperor,
Purify and sweep the Three Primes."*

Then tap the teeth thirty-six times again. This is called the *Inner Incantation of the Great Emperor’s Divine Strike*, the method to seal and eradicate all demons.

---

**Method for Encountering Inauspicious Objects During Purification (7)**
Also from the *Scripture of Forty-Four Methods*

When a Daoist enters the purification chamber and encounters an inauspicious object, perform the *Northern Emperor’s Incantation to Subdue Ghosts*. First, tap the left teeth thirty-six times and recite:

*"The Twin Images collapse,
Essence of the Mysterious One,
Seven Spirits guard life,
Ascending to the Three Clarities,
Twin Sovereigns drive them away,
Terrifying the legions of Luo,
Three hundred thousand warriors,
Attend the divine encampment,
Mighty beasts a hundred yards long,
Spewing might to seize essences,
Brandishing swords to expel evil,
Beheading and casting down demonic spirits.
By the decree of the Divine Countenance,
A thousand demons are obliterated."*

Then tap the teeth thirty-six times again.

---

**Method for Refining the Corpse of the Dead (8)**
From the *Upper Scripture: Green Essentials, Purple Writ, Scripture of the Golden Root*

The Purple Writ states: Whenever a practitioner of the Upper Clarity Dao has parents, uncles, brothers, or other relatives who die in the world, and the practitioner has not yet severed ties with them, thus encountering the dead in the mortal realm, on the third day take a basin of pure water, place one tael of true pearls into it, and stand in the central courtyard facing south over the water. Tap the teeth nine times and recite:

*"Qi transforms into spirit,
The corpse changes and enters the Mysterious,
Three transformations, five bodies,
Ascend into the Nine Heavens.
Through the Nine Heavens’ tribulations,
The body is reborn anew,
The renewed body transforms,
Attaining the state of a Perfected One."*

After reciting, if the deceased is male, visualize three Jade Lads; if female, visualize seven Jade Maidens. Pour the water from the jar over the corpse of the dead, then use the remaining water to wash your hands and face. Look up to the sky, spray a mouthful of water, and silently recite:

*"The celestial qi is now pure,
The human transformation is complete,
Attaining rebirth in the heavens above,
Nine transformations renew the form,
The Five Sufferings and Three Paths,
Sever the name of death,
Deliver the destitute souls,
Return them to the Southern Court."*

Cease. Thus, the deceased will undergo another transformation and be reborn in the heavens above, ascending to the Jade Clarity Palace after nine years. This method surpasses the Great Cavern’s method for delivering the seven ancestors. It is a secret of the Jade Emperor, not to be transmitted to the unworthy. Those who possess the *Golden Register of the Emperor’s Chart*, written in green characters on purple script, must not lightly employ or recklessly disclose it to others. Should they do so, their seven generations of ancestors will be eternally confined to the ghostly officials, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas without release. According to the *Bright Regulations of the Four Poles*, only after seven hundred years may a Perfected One be permitted to transmit it.

**Method for Encountering Another’s Corpse While Traveling (9)**
Also from the *Scripture of Green Essentials*

The Purple Writ states: Whenever a scholar of the Upper Dao traverses the paths of the world and suddenly encounters a corpse along the way, its foul qi assailing the body, the practitioner should walk twenty-four steps, stop, face north, and tap the teeth nine times. If the corpse is male, visualize three Jade Lads; if female, visualize seven Jade Maidens, coming to invite the practitioner to the Royal Valley, where they will draw from the Mysterious Water of the Celestial Mushroom to pour over the corpse. In an instant, visualize the corpse transforming and reviving as a living person, then silently recite:

*"Withered, it flourishes again,
Extinguished, it lives again,
Attaining rebirth in the heavens above,
Receiving the Great Spirit anew.
Through the Nine Heavens’ tribulations,
The cycle of rebirth repeats,
Impurities are swept away,
The white corpse revives."*

Then rub the eyes thirty-four times to conclude. Thus, the foul qi will dissipate, and the dead will undergo another transformation, later becoming a spirit-person. If the practitioner encounters and refines twenty-four such corpses, their merit will be complete, their virtue augmented, their name inscribed in the Upper Clarity. After twenty-four years, they will ascend in a spirit-chariot, soaring through the Nine Mysteries.

**Methods for Divining the Auspiciousness of Mountain Dwellings and Residences (Section Ten)**
*From the* Upper Scripture *and* The Sutra of Foreign Release

**Inscription of the Thirty-Six Sounds of the Nine Earths of the Cavernous Abyss**
*From* The Sutra of Foreign Release

A method for divining the auspiciousness of a Daoist’s mountain dwelling or household residence:

**Inscription of the Thirty-Six Sounds of the Nine Earths of the Cavernous Abyss:**
- **First Rampart:** Earth’s true tone, moving tone, wandering tone, and Brahma tone—one each.
- **Second Rampart:** Four tones—one each.
- **Third Rampart:** Tone.
- **Fourth Rampart:** Tone.
- **Fifth Rampart:** Tone.
- **Sixth Rampart:** Tone.
- **Seventh Rampart:** Tone.
- **Eighth Rampart:** Tone.
- **Ninth Rampart:** Tone.

When ascending a mountain to reside or establishing a dwelling, to discern the land’s auspiciousness, on a *wu* or *ji* day, inscribe in yellow ink the thirty-six sounds of the nine earths upon white paper, place it at the dwelling’s center, and cover it with a basin. After three nights, uncover and examine it: if the paper appears moist and yellow, it is greatly auspicious; if green, there lies a corpse of the dead below; if white, it is inauspicious; if red, there will be fright; if black, there is buried treasure; if purple, one will attain immortality. If none of these appear, the dwelling may be occupied for three years—beyond that, harm will befall.

**Method for Employing the Divine Staff (Section Eleven)**
*From the* Lower Scroll of the Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s True Writ

The Primordial Supreme Perfected, the Pure and Numinous Highly Revered, the Grand Thearch of Luminous Radiance, illumining the Eight Gates, the Five Elders proclaim their decree—nothing is hidden from their hearing. Above, they govern the Nine Heavens; in the middle, they restrain Mount Feng; below, they command the rivers and seas, the twelve water sources. The Eight Mighty Divine Incantations, the Numinous Staff and Jade Writ, summon dragons to bear water, gather qi and assemble spirits, bind demons and dispatch ghosts, sweep away demonic hordes. Ten thousand spirits are shattered, none escape their judgment. The sun, moon, and five stars; the Northern Dipper’s seven origins; all heavens, all earths, all waters, all mountains; the jade perfected under their command; the great spirits of the netherworld; the immortal kings at their feasts; the Five Thearchs bearing banners; the Heavenly Soldiers as vanguard; the Golden Tigers in pursuit; fierce beasts of the heavens, arrayed at the four gates—what is summoned arrives instantly, what is called forth stands before them. The vermilion writ blazes forth, wind and fire unceasing. Whatever is seized is transmitted by golden dragons.

Conclude by knocking the teeth nine times, howling thrice toward the heavens, and drawing in the celestial qi three times. Point the Eight Mighty Staff Writ toward the designated place, hold the breath for nine breaths, and cease.

---

**Method for Employing the Divine Staff (Section Twelve)**
*From the* Upper Scroll of the Jade Instructions of the Scripture of the Numinous Treasure

When a Daoist wishes to employ the divine staff method, they should knock their teeth thirty-six times and visualize the five emperors’ direct talisman officers, each clad in the color of their direction, their five-colored radiance flowing and illuminating the staff. The five emperors’ jade maidens, one each, stand in attendance to the staff’s left and right.

Softly recite the incantation:
*"Mountain of the Great Yang, primordial essence of the Origin,
Opening heaven and unfurling earth, sweet bamboo connects to the numinous.
Direct talisman officers and guardian soldiers,
Troops of divine warriors,
Five-colored radiance flowing,
Crimson robes and golden inscriptions,
Assisting the perfected on high,
Emerging from darkness and entering the unseen.
Summoning the heavens, the heavens bow;
Seizing the earth, the earth welcomes.
Pointing at ghosts, ghosts perish;
Demons and evil spirits are bound in form.
The numinous talisman and divine staff,
Wielding authority over all directions,
Annihilate with me,
Live with me.
After ten thousand kalpas,
They shall take my place.
Their luminous forms dissolve into five,
Their spirits ascend to the Upper Clarity.
Heeding the talisman’s decree,
None dare disobey."*

Conclude by drawing in the qi of the five directions twenty times. Point the staff toward the heavens, and the heavenly spirits pay homage; point it toward the earth, and the earthly deities receive it; point it toward the northeast, and ten thousand ghosts are bound in form.

**Method for Aiding During a Solar Eclipse (Section Thirteen)**
*Also from* The Scripture of the Azure Essentials

The purple writ’s instructions state: On the day of the eclipse, expose a mirror in the central courtyard, facing the sun. The practitioner, wielding a broadsword, faces south and knocks their teeth thirty-six times, then recites the invocation:
*"Radiant Child of the Sun,
Essence of the red yang light,
Illuminating Perfected of the Net,
Jade spirit within the shadow,
Traversing the cycles borne by qi,
Above and below, solemn and clear.
The yin circle’s inner schemes
Encroach upon the sun’s court.
The Heavenly Mirror wields its staff,
Thearch’s ministers and soldiers assist.
The Three and Five in proper alignment,
The yang light resplendently bright.
Heaven and earth alternate in eclipse—
What presumptuous force dares arise?
Return each to its place,
Let no deficiency or excess remain.
The Jade Thearch’s decree
Is heeded without fail."*

Then draw in qi twenty-four times and cease. Thus, heaven and earth return to their positions, the Three and Five shine in unison. The Radiant Child is moved to joy, the sun’s essence returns, its flowing light and mysterious infusion descend upon the practitioner’s body. Their name is inscribed on the purple tablets, recorded in the jade annals of the Upper Clarity. Within nine years, they shall ride the green plow, soaring through the void to ascend to the Upper Clarity.

---

**Method for Aiding During a Lunar Eclipse (Section Fourteen)**
*Also from* The Scripture of the Azure Essentials

The purple writ’s instructions state: On the day of the lunar eclipse, at dusk, go to the central courtyard. Take a basin of clear water, and the practitioner, wielding a blade, faces the moon and knocks their teeth sixteen times, then recites the invocation:
*"Heaven and earth separate and unite,
The round qi waxes and wanes.
Encroaching upon the moon’s chamber,
It offends the yellow radiance.
Thearch’s ministers wield their staffs,
The Jade Morning captures the transgressors.
Heavenly soldiers array themselves,
Divine lords unleash their might.
What presumptuous force dares arise,
Clinging to shadows and riding the faint?
Swiftly return to your original place,
Let no deviation remain."*

Recite this three times toward the moon, then circle the blade three times over the basin’s water. Above the water, draw in qi sixteen times and cease. The lunar eclipse will then dissolve, the celestial scene become solemn and clear, the Three and Five shine in unison, and the ten thousand palaces be at peace.

The Perfected within the Moon, the Lady of Numinous Radiance, moved to joy, returns her essence in a mysterious reflection, bestowing her favor upon the practitioner. Their name is recorded by the Northern Thearch, their death-name erased, inscribed in the Jade Annals of the Azure Palace. Twelve jade maidens are granted to attend their body. After nine years of such practice, they shall ride the flying rosy clouds to ascend to the Moon’s Court.

This Way is most wondrous—it is not practiced in the world. Those who obtain it must treasure and conceal it; be cautious not to transmit it lightly.

**Method Fifteen: Dissolving Residual Impurities**
*Also from the* Scripture of Forty-Four Methods

Whenever a Daoist encounters a corpse, blood, or defiled objects, take one *zhū* of cinnabar, scatter it into water, and use it to wash the eyes, rinse the mouth, and cleanse the hands and feet. Upon completion, enter the chamber and settle into proper repose. Cross the hands over the heart, knock the teeth twice seven times, and bow in reverence to the four directions, reciting the incantation:

*The Dao of the Three Origins on high,*
*The Great One shields this form.*
*Lord Controller of Destiny,*
*Five Spirits of Yellow Tranquility—*
*Dissolve the blood-corpse, dispel the inauspicious,*
*Let defilement sink and scatter.*
*Seven fluids coil and infuse,*
*The five viscera bloom anew.*
*Grant me immortality as a transcendent,*
*Ever prosperous, ever steadfast.*

After reciting, close both eyes and hold the breath for a long while, awaiting a slight warmth within the body as the sign. Then knock the teeth seven times and swallow saliva thrice. This is the *Internal Method of the Three Origins for Dissolving Impurities*.

---

**Method Sixteen: Incantation for Combing Hair and Washing the Head**
*Also from the* Scripture of Forty-Four Methods

Whenever a Daoist arranges their topknot or washes their hair before letting it down, first knock the teeth seven times, then recite the incantation:

*The Supreme Thearch scatters blossoms,*
*The Mysterious returns to the Great Spirit.*
*On this auspicious day,*
*I comb my hair and wash away dust,*
*Repelling evil, dispelling misfortune,*
*To attain long life as a transcendent.*

After reciting, proceed with the topknot, then knock the teeth seven times again to conclude. This is called the *Internal Method of the Supreme Thearch’s Scattered Blossoms for Combing Hair*, ensuring one remains free from illness all year, with keen hearing and sight, and no pain in the head or brain.

---

**Method Seventeen: Method for Bathing the Body and Washing Hands and Face**
*Also from the* Scripture of Forty-Four Methods

Whenever Daoists bathe the body or wash the hands and face, first stand before the water and knock the teeth three times, then recite the incantation:

*The Four Great radiate clarity,*
*Heaven and Earth endure as constants.*
*The Mysterious Water washes away filth,*
*Repelling misfortune, dispelling inauspiciousness.*
*The Twin Sovereigns guard the gate,*
*The Seven Spirits secure the chamber.*
*Cloudy essences refine and bathe,*
*Myriad qi harmonize in well-being.*
*Within and without, benefit and integrity,*
*Preserve this yellow robe.*

After reciting, knock the teeth three times again, then wash the hands and face. This is called the *Seven-Chamber Incantation for Washing Away Filth and Dispelling Misfortune*. Those who regularly practice it will sharpen their spirit and blood, repelling all inauspicious qi.

---

**Method Eighteen: Incantation Before Purified Meals**
*Also from the* Scripture of Forty-Four Methods

Whenever Daoists enter the chamber for purification and fasting, before eating, always hold the chopsticks in the left hand and tap the plate three times, then recite the incantation:

*The Two Mysteries ascend the Dao,*
*The Four Poles are pure and cool.*
*The Supreme One, Thearch of Emperors,*
*All spirits rest in yellow tranquility.*
*Receiving sustenance from the Three Officials,*
*Irrigating the numinous spleen,*
*Offering up to the Supreme Harmony,*
*Feasting on the five fragrant flavors.*
*The soul and embryo receive life,*
*The seven fluids flow and settle.*
*A hundred passages open in harmony,*
*The five viscera bloom with radiance.*
*The Twin Sovereigns merge with the light,*
*Soaring to ascend the Upper Clarity.*

After eating, tap the plate twice more. This is called the *Way of the Soul and Embryo Receiving Fragrance and All Spirits Partaking of Sustenance*. Those who regularly practice it will sharpen their spirit and harmonize their qi, calming the hun and po souls, repelling evil and dispelling trials, and perpetually preserving beneficial essences. Recite this before eating.

Whenever Daoists approach a sumptuous meal, first rectify the mind and concentrate on the One, imagining the One partaking of the food first, then proceed to eat. After eating, silently recite the incantation:

*A hundred grains enter the stomach,*
*Uniting with the spirit in qi.*
*Fortifying and replenishing blood and fluids,*
*Corpse-demons and evil perish and fall.*
*Ascending to fly through the celestial gates,*
*Attaining long life with Heaven and Earth.*
*Commanding the Six Dings,*
*With numinous youths offering protection.*

Cease reciting. Those who regularly do so will cause evil qi to retreat afar and true qi to advance. Recite this after eating.

---

**Method Nineteen: Daoist Self-Massage**
The method for Daoists to self-massage the head and face is essential for seeking the Dao, first ensuring clear eyes and sharp ears, as these are the foundation of all affairs.

Moreover, the ears and eyes are the ladder for seeking the true and the gateway for gathering the numinous. Success and failure are determined by them in an instant; life and death must be discerned through them. The great teachings are here demonstrated—practice them accordingly.

Press the small cavities behind both eyebrows thirty-three times. Then, with the palms and fingers, massage the area below the eyes and above the cheekbones. Next, rotate the ears thirty times. Then, with the hands, stroke the forehead upward thirty-three times, swallowing saliva as needed, without limit.

Regularly practicing this will clarify the ears and eyes. Perform this discreetly at the philtrum, without speaking of its form.

Next, with both hands, stroke the head in all four directions, following the hair to its ends, as much as possible. Thus, the blood in the head flows and disperses, preventing the congealing of wind and dampness.

When finished, press the four corners of the eyes thirty-six times until one sees light clearly. This is the method for examining the spirit of the eyes. Regular practice enables one to perceive the hundred spirits.

**Method Twenty: Seeking Spiritual Response Before Transmission**
*From the* Scripture of Forty-Four Methods

Whenever transmitting the superior methods, the master possessing the scripture should first seek a spiritual response before imparting them.

Enter the chamber, burn incense, and secretly pray to the spirits. Then, bow before the scripture and silently recite the incantation:

*Supreme Primordial Sovereign,*
*Great Spirit of the Immortal Capital,*
*On this auspicious day,*
*I unfold eight vows:*
*Desiring to transmit the superior method,*
*I dare to inform the numinous origin.*
*Whether it may be granted or not,*
*I await a response before proclaiming.*

After reciting, retire to sleep, and one will surely receive a numinous response. The disciple will then know the sincerity of their heart and may discern whether to transmit the method.

*The Nine Heavens proclaim the mandate,*
*All spirits heed with reverence.*

Conclude.

If, while traveling at night, one feels fear and trepidation, or during nightmares when demons and ghosts test one, violating the true and disrupting the qi, intending to cause illness and harm, swiftly perform the Jade Thearch’s *Method for Expelling Ghosts and Guarding the Numinous*.

The disciple should concentrate the mind on the supreme Dao, seeking aid from the Thearch of the One. Face north, knock the teeth thirty times, hold the breath, and carefully recite the incantation. After reciting, knock the teeth again as before and swallow saliva ten times. Thus, treacherous evil will be shattered, and all demons subdued. The Seven Spirits will entwine, the Supreme One will oversee and seize, and myriad spirits will guard the true, externally overawing inauspicious qi.

This may also be chanted and recited daily, resonating aloud, whether sitting or lying down, to block the approach of all evil trials and seal the malevolent traces of treacherous ghosts. When retiring to sleep, it may also be regularly recited, calming the spirit and clarifying the mind, dispelling nightmares and curses, eliminating all toxins and evils, ensuring lifelong freedom from fear.

On days of recitation, one need not face north or hold the breath. The method of holding the breath and secretly reciting is used when ghosts and demons have already tested one’s surroundings and malevolent spirits have violated one’s spirit chamber, thus commanding the numinous and true to eradicate their malevolent traces. The incantation for sleeping, however, does not follow this same method.

---

**Method Twenty-Two: Method for Knocking the Teeth**
All methods of the Upper Clarity for knocking the teeth and swallowing saliva follow specific directions, with a proper sequence of before and after. They must not be practiced in a disordered or mixed manner, lest the true spirits become confused and erratic.

To command the spirits, one knocks the teeth; to harmonize the true, one swallows qi. Drawing in harmonious qi and swallowing the six fluids, one circulates them to restrain the spirits—this must be done with the resonance of the drum to align the ranks.

In all practices of the Upper Clarity, when performing rites and invocations, one first taps the teeth, striking the upper and lower together, not the left and right. With each inhalation and exhalation, one swallows the various qi and fluids. This is called "summoning the spirits and harmonizing the true," the method by which one seeks to ascend as an immortal.

The method of knocking the teeth: striking the upper and lower together is called the "Heavenly Drum"; striking the left teeth is called the "Heavenly Bell"; striking the right teeth is called the "Heavenly Chime." To subdue ghosts and summon demons, one knocks the bell and chime; to practice the Dao and seek the true, one knocks the Heavenly Drum.

**Method Twenty-Three: Incantation for Ringing in the Ears**
From the *Great Wondrous Scripture*

When ringing is heard in the ears, cross the hands to cover the ears and recite:
*"The Red Child dwells in the palace,
The Nine Perfected abide in the chamber.
Hearken to the divine command,
Discern what is inauspicious.
The Great One flows with fire,
To extinguish the ten thousand evils."*

After reciting, cover the ear openings seven times. When the face grows warm, it is an auspicious sign. If one feels a creeping chill in the head or neck, it is the entry of malevolent qi. One must immediately lie down, close the eyes, and visualize the True Lord of the Great One in the Cinnabar Palace, casting forth the fiery bell to expel the malevolent qi from the ears. The firelight follows behind, blazing brightly to illuminate the entire body, and after a long while, one returns to tranquility.

**Method Twenty-Four: Discerning Auspicious and Inauspicious Signs in Ear Ringing**
Also from the *Great Wondrous Scripture*

If one suddenly hears the sound of rushing water, thunder, or drumming in the ears, it signifies bodily exhaustion, extreme damage to the heart’s storehouse, an inability to savor the true and sustain life, and indulgence leading to dissipation. The six palaces lose their governance, the hun and po wail in sorrow—this is the omen of impending illness and death.

Thus, the Mud-Pill Palace collapses, the Nine Palaces fall into disorder, sorrow and confusion arise, and the drumming of the spirits becomes chaotic. They prepare to abandon their dwelling and forsake the body. Upon hearing this, one must concentrate the mind to reverse delusion and return to the true heart. If the transgression is not yet grave, one may still reform upon hearing it.

Deafness occurs because the ear spirit has departed. If one suddenly hears the sounds of gold and jade, true qi is entering, and the Dao is about to be accomplished. If one hears the sound of stringed music, the Six Ding Jade Maidens have come to protect one’s Dao. One should retreat into seclusion, focus on cultivation, and devote oneself even more earnestly than before. The True Person will gradually manifest in form—unless one’s master instructs otherwise, do not speak of this to others.

Hearing the sound of flutes and horns is an auspicious omen of noble arrival. Hearing cries, wails, or shouts is an inauspicious omen of ruin. Hearing foul odors foretells filth and decay—one must immediately bathe, burn incense, and sweep the dwelling. This is the warning the Lord Emperor imparts to humanity.

If one smells blood or unexpectedly sees pools of blood, it portends warfare. One must flee the mortal realm, visualize the Three Primordial Lords, seek salvation, and observe a three-month retreat—then the disaster will cease. These are all ways the Lord Emperor forewarns humanity of fortune and misfortune, urging vigilance against calamity.

Upon witnessing inauspicious omens, one should practice hidden virtue, engage in acts of kindness and rescue, do what others cannot do, and walk the path others cannot walk—only then can one escape the fate of certain death. Be diligent in this; do not cling to the ordinary.

**Method Twenty-Five: Method for Placing the Five Directions Talismans in the Retreat Hall**
From the *Scripture of Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*

After inscribing the talismans for the Five Directions to summon spirits, restrain demons, and attract the true, first face north and knock the teeth thirty-six times, then softly recite:
*"The Nine Heavens issue their command,
Proclaiming to the ten thousand spirits.
Three generations succeed one another,
The five qi intermingle.
The Jade Emperor reveals his chariot,
Guiding the reins in the celestial court.
He enacts and spreads the true Dharma,
Subdues demons and binds essences,
Slays the primordial fiends,
And all paths are pacified.
Those who follow the Dao and study later,
The Lord Emperor records their names.
Summon the true to penetrate the hidden,
Qi merges without form.
Transform the luminous and refine the Dao,
Ascend to the Three Clarities,
Attain swift-flying chariots,
And ascend to the Jade Court."*

After reciting, place the talismans according to their positions. The true immortals will descend at once, and one’s body will be free from misfortune. Those who study without this Dao will rarely escape bodily ruin. This is a wondrous method—without study, one may yet attain immortality.

**Method Twenty-Six: Visualizing the Three Perfected While Practicing the Dao and Absorbing Qi**

In the Upper Primordial Palace of the Mud-Pill Palace, the spirit is the Red Child, named Yuanxian, also called the Imperial Minister. In the Middle Primordial Palace of the Crimson Chamber (the heart), the spirit is the True Person, named Zidan, also called Guangjian. In the Lower Primordial Palace of the Cinnabar Field (three inches below the navel), the spirit is the Infant, named Yuanyangzi, also called Guxuan. These are the Three Ones.

When restraining the hun and po, first silently call their names and visualize the three spirits as jade-colored with golden radiance, appearing like infants. The Upper and Middle Primordials both wear red, while the Lower Primordial wears yellow. Their heads resemble those of newborn infants. When practicing the Dao and absorbing qi, one also visualizes their names.

**Method Twenty-Seven: The Seven Harms to Immortality**
From the *Mysterious Record of the Seven Sages*

All those who study the mysterious records and whose names are inscribed, whose bodies bear the signs of immortality, should naturally unite with the true. Yet they may incur the following harms:

**First Harm:** Cloaking truth with falsehood, indulging in lust to exhaust the spirit, leaking the soul’s fluids, drying up the radiance of essence, scattering qi and dispersing the po, hollowing the bones and shaking the form, the spirit weeping in the exhausted palace. This is heard in the Celestial Pass, and the true immortals flee afar. One becomes bound to the nine dusts, sharing the same fate as the earthly palace—how can one still attain immortality?

**Second Harm:** Outwardly appearing devoted to the Dao, with a pleasing demeanor and reverence for the true, yet harboring malevolence within. Evil accumulates inwardly, wishing others ill, envying the capable and resenting the worthy. The mouth speaks fair words while the heart is perverse; the face smiles while the mind seethes. One debates others’ gains and losses, recklessly creates the roots of sin, slanders fellow students, and attacks the foundations of one’s master. The Three Offices record this, marking one as an evil gate. The immortal true ones depart, and malevolent demons assail the body, causing the form to wander as a phantom and the body’s spirit to scatter. Thus, one suffers unjust calamities, reaching the depths of evil. After judgment, the body turns to ash, and one is extinguished in the Nine Springs. Even with an inscribed name in the mysterious records, how can one preserve one’s natural state?

The third harm: indulging in wine to the point of drunkenness, damaging qi and losing one’s numinous spirit. The Five Palaces collapse, the ten thousand spirits are shocked, the hun and po scatter and flee, the inner and outer decay and wither. The original chamber stands empty, the Red Child wails in sorrow. The true immortals ascend far away, while malevolent demons enter the body. Such study only wastes one’s essence and sincerity. Though one’s name may be inscribed in the mysterious records, it remains an empty entry in the jade register. The spirit ascends to the Upper Palace, while the body turns to ash in the dark underworld. In vain does one seek to prolong life—how can one’s years endure?

The fourth harm: conduct that fails to rectify things, demanding others’ reverence and admiration. The heart seethes, the mouth utters curses without restraint, anger and joy lose all moderation, the mind’s nature strays from constancy. Qi surges and the spirit scatters, the inner true ones take flight, the po departs and the hun wanders. The nine orifices fill with dust, the Five Palaces rush to ruin—all due to an impure nature and inauspicious conduct. The true immortals ascend far away, while external afflictions enter the body. With such study, what benefit can one hope to gain? Though one may possess the mysterious charts, one cannot escape this calamity. The days of longing for immortality stretch on, while the distance to the earthly realm grows ever longer.

The fifth harm: when the mysterious charts are displayed and one receives the precious scriptures, or when one encounters a numinous master who imparts divine texts, yet fails to follow the precepts and covenants, revealing the celestial true ones. Before nine years have passed, one hastens to inscribe one’s name on the famous mountains, causing the Azure Palace to record it and the Golden Gates to compile it—then transmits it to others, scattering it among the world. To treat the true lightly and reveal the precious brings judgment upon oneself. Though one’s name may be inscribed in the mysterious records, it only burdens the Seven Mysteries. The immortal Way ascends far away, while the body dies in the dark springs, forever bearing the debt of ghosts, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas.

The sixth harm: the body treads in filth and impurity, the form and radiance lack fragrance. Within, there is no purity and emptiness; without, no orchid-like fragrance. The clear and numinous lose their truth, the spirits do not dwell in their chambers. Qi is disturbed and essence is muddled, the numinous origin loses its light. The Five Spirits scatter and flee, the Red Child soars away, malevolent demons attack, and both inner and outer perish. With such study, one hopes for success but instead suffers harm. The true immortals ascend far away, leaving only an empty radiance to wander alone, sinking into turbidity—what benefit can one gain from immortality?

The seventh harm: consuming the flesh of all living beings, slaughtering the finest creatures for the palate. Foul vapors fill the viscera, life is cut down in what is not one’s own. True qi is disturbed at the numinous gate, the wandering spirits are startled in the Red Child. The hun and po depart from their palaces, turbidity and stagnation cling to the mouth and teeth. The immortal true ones ascend to the Jade Clarity, while one’s own body sinks and languishes in the earthly realm. Though one’s name may be inscribed in the Emperor’s registers, one cannot escape inevitable death.

The Most High Sagely Thearch says: The foundation of study lies in urgently guarding against the seven harms. Once one has gazed upon the gates of the mysterious paths and perused the jade scriptures, if one does not violate the prohibitions of the seven harms, one may sit and await the descent of the numinous, ascending at dawn in broad daylight.

If one toils externally in study yet internally does not dispel the seven harms, one will seek immortality but instead meet defeat, hope for life but instead perish, desire good fortune but instead encounter misfortune, aspire to flight but instead sink. The numinous immortals depart to the lofty clarity, the Five Spirits scatter to the eight wilds, the Red Child wails within the central chamber, and the wandering hun laments in the mysterious void. Thus, the signs of immortality have both success and failure, and advanced study has its seven harms. For those who earnestly esteem the Way, who can purify their truth?

**The Ten Failings of Immortal Signs, Twenty-Eight Methods**
From the *Upper Scripture: Scripture of the Purple Texts of the Numinous Book*

First failing: Do not indulge in licentiousness. Licentiousness causes the hun’s essence to leak outward, the radiance of essence to wither and dry up, the spirit to scorch and the po to scatter. The bones grow thin and the marrow turns foul, the hun wails in the numinous palace. This is heard at the Celestial Pass, the Three Palaces vie in contention, and the Embryonic Flower grieves in disorder.
This is the first failing of immortal signs.

Second failing: Do not harbor malevolent and vicious thoughts. Malevolence causes the Yellow Court to fall into chaos, the Three Corpses delight in killing, the hun-spirits spy on wickedness, and the po-ghosts invade the chambers. The light of the eyes scatters and vanishes, the mouth emits harmful qi.
This is the second failing of immortal signs.

Third failing: Do not become drunk on wine. Drunkenness causes the bodily form to decay and collapse, the divine true ones to become entangled, the hun to forget its original chamber, and the po to wander in evil dwellings. The Red Child takes flight and wails, the throat and brain burn with fire.
This is the third failing of immortal signs.

Fourth failing: Do not be filthy, slothful, or impure. Filth and impurity cause the clear and numinous to lose their truth, essence and hun to find no dwelling. The Three Palaces breed worms, the Red Child floats away, the blood turns turbid and the marrow grows foul. The radiance of the spirit loses its brilliance, the po flees to the evil gates, seeking my deathly texts.
This is the fourth failing of immortal signs.

Fifth failing: Do not eat the flesh of any living being. Consuming it causes the original form to lose its beginning, the root and foundation to perish. The Embryonic Spirit wails, the Crimson Lord cries out in longing, the Three Hun grow grim and poisoned, the po searches for graves. Once this flesh enters the mouth, life plunges into eternal night.
This is the fifth failing of immortal signs.

Sixth failing: Do not eat the flesh of any living being in water. Consuming it causes the form and spirit to offend the true, the Muddy Pellet to fall away, the Three Palaces to close their gates, and the Infant to become entangled. The hun-spirit flees in terror, the po seeks a coffin.
This is the sixth failing of immortal signs.

Seventh failing: Do not eat the flesh of flying birds. Consuming it causes the qi, form, voice, and odor to become turbid and stagnant. The brain turns yellow and the teeth wither, the spleen nurtures dead qi. The hun does not receive the true, the po generates evil impulses. The body sinks into the eternal abyss, the bones follow the earth to dissolution.
This is the seventh failing of immortal signs.

Eighth failing: Do not eat the five pungent vegetables. Consuming them causes the Five Viscera to reek, the Three Flowers to collapse in chaos. The spirit cannot ascend, the essence-embryo sinks downward. The hun and po part ways, the Red Child grows weary and distressed. The flying numinous loses its guard, the light of the eyes flows away.
This is the eighth failing of immortal signs.

Ninth failing: Do not kill creatures from insects upward. Killing causes weapons to turn against the myriad things, binding the bones and blood in resentment. The form becomes violent and the po fierce, the qi of the hun wages war. The Embryonic Spirit wanders in panic, the True Child flees in terror. The Muddy Pellet turns treacherous and wild, the Red Child abandons and betrays. The corpse-form is scalded in boiling water, cooked in fire.
This is the ninth failing of immortal signs.

Tenth failing: Do not face north when urinating or defecating, or look up at the Three Luminaries. Do not face north when cutting hair, removing clothes, spitting, or cursing. Do not offend the broken or destroy the royal—“broken” refers to the earthly branches beneath the year, and “royal” refers to where the royal qi resides.
This is the tenth failing of immortal signs.

Do not rage against the sun, moon, or stars. Do not impose punishments or execute authority on the eight solar terms. Do not harbor anger or resentment on the first day of the lunar month. Do not harm creatures with shells or scales—such as tortoises or dragons—on the days of the Six Jia. Do not harm pheasants on Bingwu days. Do not harm black beasts on Bingzi days. On Gengshen days, do not entertain other thoughts; instead, concentrate and meditate upon the True. On Yimao days, do not drink alcohol or eat meat; maintain purity and a tranquil mind.

Do not take life in the first month. Do not eat meat on the ninth day of the second month. Do not consume the hearts of any of the hundred grasses on the third day of the third month. Do not cut grass or fell trees on the eighth day of the fourth month. Do not draw blood on the fifth day of the fifth month. Do not break ground on the sixth day of the sixth month. Do not dwell on evil deeds on the seventh day of the seventh month. Do not purchase or obtain footwear or anything that attaches to the feet on the fourth day of the eighth month. Do not disturb bedding or mats on the ninth day of the ninth month. Do not punish or reprimand people or creatures on the fifth day of the tenth month. Do not fail to bathe on the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Do not neglect fasting, burning incense, or reciting the True during the last three days of the twelfth month.

All such taboos are great prohibitions of Heaven and humanity. The Three Officials record and examine them, deeming their violation a grave offense. They may cause the three hun-souls to contend with one another, the seven po-souls to scatter in chaos, or provoke the wrath of the Embryonic Spirit when the Three Officials receive reports of evil. Thus, nightmares assail the cinnabar heart, malevolent spirits seize the vermilion gates, and the essence-fluid is violated. The divine and true become disoriented, transformations multiply, and prohibitions abound. Those who fail to recognize these taboos will not master their art. If you uphold and cultivate these precepts, you will become a candidate for immortality; if you violate the heavenly prohibitions, you will suffer harm and defeat.

**Shangqing Ritual Robes (Twenty-Nine)**
*From the* **Tai Shang Huang Su Forty-Four Methods Scripture**

The Shangqing ritual robe is made of purple and cyan silk, with purple on the outside and cyan within. The robe is four feet and nine inches long, corresponding to the number of the four seasons, and five feet and five inches wide, aligning with the qi of Heaven and Earth. The outer and inner layers follow the same pattern: the outer layer has twenty-four strips, and the inner layer has fifteen strips, together corresponding to the thirty-nine positions of the True Emperors. Thus, one who wears this robe bears the vestment of the Emperor Star.

Without this robe, one must not recklessly handle the sacred scriptures. This ritual robe is bestowed upon twelve Jade Lads. It must not be lent to others, nor may it be defiled by impurity or treated with disrespect.

For women, the purple gauze robe requires twenty-four feet of fabric, with sleeves cut to an appropriate length. The sleeves should be divided into sixteen strips, and the body into twenty-three strips, totaling thirty-nine strips. Additionally, a cyan gauze skirt is made from forty-five feet of fabric, divided into eight panels, each four feet and nine inches long. The remaining fabric is used for the waistband, which is split into thirty-two strips across the eight panels—this is the Flying Cyan Skirt.

Without this robe, one must not chant the Shangqing sacred scriptures. This ritual robe is bestowed upon twelve Jade Maidens. It must not be lent to others, nor may it be defiled by impurity or treated with disrespect.

**Daoist Travel Incantations for Mountains and Marshes (Thirty)**
*From the* **Scripture for Dispelling Demons**

When Daoists traverse the Five Peaks or cross rivers and marshes, they must perform the incantations of the Three Heavens and Orthodox Unity, the methods for testing authority and summoning spirits to attain immortality.

At the outset of ascending a mountain, first strike the teeth nine times outside the mountain, close the eyes, and visualize five-colored clouds billowing forth, converging from the four directions to envelop the mountain and oneself within the cloudy qi. After a while, see the immortal officials of the Five Prisons, the mountain forests and grasses, the rivers and marshes, the birds and beasts, and the myriad things all coming to pay homage. Then, raise the head and recite:

"The Supreme Emperor sets forth on a journey,
The day is auspicious, the hour is propitious.
Jade radiance covers me,
The Great One supports and guides me.
On my left, White Prime assists;
On my right, Limitless Flourishing aids.
The Eight Emperors and Nine Perfected,
Ascend in majesty and tread in prosperity.
They lead me, escort me,
And share their brilliance with me.
As I traverse the Five Peaks,
The host of immortals welcomes me.
Entering and exiting rivers and seas,
Myriad paths open wide.
I command the Six Dings,
My steps tread the Five Phases.
The Three Heavens have decreed:
Sweep away all misfortune,
Scatter filth and expel calamity,
Molten metal annihilates disaster.
The Orthodox Way is pure and unobstructed,
Stern as the frost’s might.
Radiant essence shines resplendent,
Dragon chariots rise majestically.
Flowing cyan and emerald plumes,
Flying brocade and silken robes.
Wherever I go,
All is auspicious and prosperous.
The myriad perfected come to pay homage,
Together ascending the Jade Capital."

Upon completion, draw in qi thirty-six times and swallow it.

After practicing this for a thousand days, the true immortals of the Five Peaks will descend in cloud chariots and feathered canopies, enabling flight through the vast heavens.

**Prohibitions and Auspicious Days for Daoists Entering Mountains:**
When Daoists wish to enter mountains, the third and seventh months are auspicious.

Another method: In spring, do not enter eastern or western mountains; in summer, do not enter southern or northern mountains; in autumn, do not enter western or eastern mountains; in winter, do not enter northern or southern mountains.

Auspicious days for entering mountains: *Bao*, *Yi*, and *Zhuan* days are favorable; *Zhi* and *Fa* days are inauspicious.

**Bao Days (Auspicious):**
Jiazi, Bingyin, Dingmao, Jisi, Xinwei, Renshen, Guiyou, Yihai, Gengchen, Xinchou, Gengxu, Wuwu.

**Yi Days (Auspicious):**
Dingchou, Bingxu, Jiawu, Gengzi, Renyin, Guimao, Yisi, Dingwei, Wushen, Jiyou, Xinhai, Bingchen.

**Zhuan Days (Auspicious):**
Wuchen, Jichou, Wuxu, Bingwu, Renzi, Jiayin, Yimao, Dingsi, Jiwei, Gengshen, Xinyou, Guihai.

**Zhi Days (Inauspicious):**
Yichou, Jiaxu, Renwu, Wuzi, Guisi, Jiachen, Gengyin, Xinmao, Yiwei, Bingshen, Dingyou, Jihai.

**Fa Days (Inauspicious):**
Gengwu, Bingzi, Wuyin, Jimao, Xinsi, Guiwei, Jiashen, Yiyou, Dinghai, Renchen, Guichou, Renxu.

If a Daoist suddenly encounters inauspicious or ominous signs, strike the Heavenly Bell thirty-six times—striking the left teeth.

If a Daoist traverses mountains, to repel evil and invoke the might of the spirits, strike the Heavenly Chime thirty-six times—striking the right teeth.

When meditating upon the Dao and summoning the true to attract the numinous, sound the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times—striking the upper and lower teeth together.

Whenever a Daoist lodges alone in mountain forests and is often harassed or tested by mountain spirits or malevolent ghosts, strike the teeth twenty-seven times, hold the breath, and recite the incantation:

*"Yesterday I was summoned by the Emperor, entrusted with the true primordial essence, commanded to seal and govern this peak, to crush and sunder Feng Mountain. All myriad spirits receive their duties and assemble before the Emperor. The Seven Spirits initiate their departure; the Three Origins administer the true. If any petty demons remain, let them be instantly decapitated and destroyed. Mountain spirits and marsh wardens, hasten to receive me. The divine master bears the mandate, ascending to report before the Three Clarities. Let all proceed as in the Great Cavern’s law, without delay or hindrance."*

After the incantation, strike the teeth twice seven times. This is the method of the Perfected Lord’s divine incantation to subdue mountain spirits and the hundred ghosts. When the gods of all mountains, earth deities, and the lords of dwelling shrines hear this incantation, they will wield whips to welcome you, with divine soldiers standing guard—making it as though ten thousand men share your lodging.

Those who have received the Three Ranks of the Supreme Dao, yet have not ascended to the Three Clarities or been titled as Immortal Kings, are often tested by heavenly demons and harassed by the myriad spirits. They should chant the Demon-Repelling Incantation to stir the numinous sounds of the upper heavens, summon the might of the Three Realms’ spirits, bind the myriad essences to the Heavenly Bell, and slay demons with the Cavern Scripture.

When performing this method, always face north. First visualize a radiant orb like the sun rising from the nape, with a vermilion phoenix to the left and a dark dragon to the right. Purple auroras cover and illuminate your form, while jade lads and maidens hold five-colored banners, leading the myriad spirits of the Three Realms. Before you, nine phoenixes cry; behind you, eight simurghs sing. White dragons clear the path, and the Supreme Ultimate attends your chariot.

After this, strike the left teeth thirty-six times, then the right teeth twenty-four times, then the upper and lower teeth together twelve times, and recite:

*"Net the poisonous beasts of the heavens, guard the four great gates. Devour and drown, sever and disembowel—ten thousand hideous mountain hordes, gaping jaws that claw the sky, fierce steeds galloping high, venomous dragons brandishing claws, golden heads swallowing sideways. Mighty soldiers by the thousands, receiving talismans to inspect immortals. The Six Heavens are unrestrained; evil gathers in swarms. Demons surge like waves; foul qi swirls in chaos. Empty chants and wild songs, discordant sounds like storm clouds. Lesser ghosts manifest, targeting the gate of life. The divine king proclaims: nothing in the unseen remains unheard. Above, the Six Qi are seized; below, the river sources are examined. The Five Peaks and Four Waterways swiftly distinguish good from evil. By the millions and tens of millions, come before me. The Five Emperors record and judge: those with merit are pardoned. If malevolent demons harass the true, the true form of the Perfected Lord—dare you disobey the command? Those executed shall know no reprieve: livers torn, bellies carved, heads severed, roots destroyed. Boiled in northern cauldrons of scalding broth, burned in southern mounds of raging fire. The Golden True records their qi; flowing bells capture their souls. No trace of demonic essence remains; their forms and origins are utterly extinguished. Bearing the Heavenly Scriptures, practicing the correct texts of the Dao, purging the Nine Qi, purifying the Three Origins. The mysterious and void uplifts the true, uniting with the natural. Let none dare to test or disturb—report all changes above."*

After reciting, draw in the breath and swallow twelve times.

This is the Wisdom Demon-Repelling Incantation.

Whenever scholars of the Dao wander through famous mountains, lodging alone amid a hundred ghosts and trembling in fear, or when illness clings like an infant and ghosts swarm at the door, reciting this once is like melting ice with boiling broth or refining gold with blazing flames. The hun-soul becomes clear and upright, the qi settles, the body strengthens. Unless fate decrees otherwise, even seeking death will be impossible.

The *Shangqing Scripture on Cultivation and Practice* concludes.
