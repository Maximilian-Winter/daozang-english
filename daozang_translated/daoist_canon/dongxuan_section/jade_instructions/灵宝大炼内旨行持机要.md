Facing the altar, perform the Nine Bows of Reverence. One may first offer three bows and burn incense, or burn incense before bowing—additional offerings may be made as the moment requires. Declare the purpose of the fast, briefly addressing the Supreme Sages and Perfected Masters, stating the intent of the ritual upon its completion.

Bow three times again, then withdraw and sit upright before the altar. Compose the spirit and align the breath. Recite the Great Scripture nine times—or the *Scripture of Ascending to Heaven*, the *Nine Chapters of Generating the Spirit*, or the *Qingxu Invocation*. With each recitation, draw in a breath of qi, directing it straight into the Cinnabar Field. (The original text reads thus; however, it is likely that "Cinnabar" should be "body," directing the qi to fill the Field of the Body entirely. This is the Water Palace, as the scripture states: "The Two Water Lords face the Gate of Life"—this is the Water Department.)

Gather the radiance of the nine breaths of qi to form an infant. This transformation occurs precisely between the two kidneys, where a single point of light appears—this is the place. Its form mirrors one’s own body.

Turn outward, cross the legs, and sit upright. The remaining light pervades heaven and earth—not as an external posture, but as the alchemy within the crucible. Form and spirit become luminous.

In an instant, the qi of the Five Viscera, in their five colors, rises like clouds from below, bearing the infant upward. Ascending through the Double Passes of the spine, it enters the Mud-Pill Palace, where it suddenly transforms into a precious pearl—the Millet Pearl.

The infant becomes the Primordial Beginning, while the cloud-qi of the Five Viscera transforms into five-colored lions. The Primordial Beginning sits within the precious pearl atop the five-colored lions, its myriad rays of luminous power illuminating all heavens and earths, penetrating inner and outer.

Next, visualize the Thirty-Two Heavens, with their ten thousand sages and thousand perfected beings, floating in the void and entering the precious pearl. They all gather before the Emperor, as if listening to the Dharma. The Primordial Beginning emits the light of the White Brow and the Radiance of the Forehead Mark, which descends to illuminate the Nine Dark Prisons of Fengdu—this corresponds to the region below the navel.

Within the Mud-Pill Palace and the two lights, the precious pearl is visible. Within the two pearls, the Thirty-Two Heavens, ten thousand sages, and thousand perfected beings are seen, escorting the Primordial Beginning—identical to the previous pearl. Within the two lights, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering is seen, his radiance shining brilliantly, illuminating the ten directions.

All the prisons of Fengdu, by the power and majestic light of the Heavenly Worthy’s Dao, are illuminated, dispelling the deepest darkness and transforming them into pure lands. Next, visualize the region below the two kidneys as the realm of dark yin—this is the prison. When its gates open, the Northern Emperor, along with the underworld officials and wardens, array themselves in ranks outside the capital gates to pay homage.

Fengdu lies behind the Water Department, between the waist, kidneys, and spine. After the homage is complete, the Flying Heavenly Kings of the Ten Directions arrive, riding dragon chariots, with golden lads and jade maidens attending at their sides. They hold the talismanic decrees of the Primordial Beginning before the Emperor. Receiving the Dao’s command, they descend in radiance, entering the prisons of Fengdu. All condemned souls are pardoned, released from their cells, and gathered before the palace of Fengdu.

Next, visualize the Flowery Pond and its vast, surging waters. Then, visualize the ten thousand sages and thousand perfected beings within the precious pearl, all reciting the *Great Invocation of Danyang*. Next, visualize the Primordial Heavenly Worthy issuing a decree, summoning the Red Dragon to stir the waves of the Misty Pond, which pour down like a waterfall into the Eastern Well.

Swiftly visualize the tongue as the Red Dragon, stirring the Flowery Pond. When the divine water in the mouth overflows, turn the head to the left and swallow it, sending it to the front of the Water Palace—this is the Celestial River. Swiftly visualize the front of the Water Palace as a vast, boundless ocean. All condemned souls enter to bathe in the auspicious wind and harmonious qi, warmed as if in spring. The fragrance permeates their inner and outer, filling them with joy. They suddenly awaken from greed and anger, turning their hearts toward the true Dao. After bathing,

the Primordial Beginning commands the golden lads and jade maidens—numberless in their ranks—to each present pure garments to the souls. Once clothed, the thousand perfected and ten thousand sages within the precious pearl recite in unison the *Scripture of Salvation* and the *Mysterious Verses of Hidden Wisdom*. The Heavenly Worthies of the Great One and the Ten Directions descend step by step with the recitation, floating upon clouds.

The Great One showers the souls with the Dharma-rain of sweet dew, cleansing their bodies and minds, easing and moistening their throats. The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions each hold golden bowls and jade spoons, filled with sweet dew and jade ointment, scattering them in the void as offerings. The souls partake of this Dharma-food until they are sated.

Next, visualize the spine as the Great Dharma Bridge of Ascension to Heaven, connecting to the Crimson Palace of Zhuling below and the Water Palace above. Golden lads and jade maidens, holding banners and canopies, scatter flying incense and flowers, guiding the departed souls onto the bridge. They ascend to the Fire Palace of Zhuling, where the Great Lord of Longevity, clad in imperial robes, resides. The Marshal of the Celestial Bureau, wearing a star crown, and the Venerable Lord Han, in a white jade crown and azure robes with black-green trim, oversee the process. The Deities of Life and Destiny, Longevity and Fortune, and the Deliverance from Calamity, all in star-crowned attire, monitor the passage of the souls into the fiery crucible for refinement.

The souls, now clad in celestial garments, are tempered by the flames. Countless fire dragons, their radiant flames leaping from the crucible, carry the departed souls through the Twelve-Storied Tower, soaring into the void until they reach the Jade Clarity Realm. There, they bow before the Primordial Beginning and enter the radiance of the precious light.

The practitioner must still the mind into profound tranquility, forgetting both self and others, abiding in utter stillness. Do not inquire where the departed have gone—even the slightest attachment prevents ultimate liberation and obstructs their deliverance. This practice must be kept secret, the mouth sealed while performing it.

This method is the alchemy within the crucible—it is not the deluded pursuit of mysteries beyond the embrace of heaven and earth.

Beware, beware—never lightly reveal this to the unworthy, lest they fall into confusion and arrogance, giving rise to disbelief. Should this occur, both master and disciple will be bound by the celestial decree. Take heed! Take heed!
