**Explication of the Inner and Outer Jade Landscape Scriptures of the Huangting**
Presented by the court official Jiang Shenshiu (朝散大夫赐徘鱼袋臣蒋慎修), who offers this work in progress.

**The Chapter on the Immortal Daoist**
The Immortal Daoist is not one endowed with inherent **Dao/Way** (神).
The accumulation of **qi** (精) and refinement of **qi** (气) alone bring forth the True (真).
**Dao/Way** (神) is the primal principle (元方),
The True (真) is a tangible reality (有物).
If **Dao/Way** (元方) were inherent to the Immortal Daoist,
Then the True (真) would lack material foundation (物).
Thus, the True (真) arises only through the accumulation and refinement of **qi** (精气),
And this is why it is called *True* (真).

The Inner **Huangting** (黄童) emits sounds that are hard to hear (内音难可闻),
Its **Jue** (玉) scriptures bear crimson bamboo slips and vermilion-red writings (玉书绛简赤丹文).
The **spleen** (脾) holds the office of clarity (明),
Within it resides the luminous child (明童),
Hence it is called the *Inner Huangting* (黄童).

The Inner **Huangting** is threefold (三迭),
All achieved through recitation and contemplation (诵、味),
So that the five **zang** organs (五脏) do not engage with external things (外物),
And this is why its sounds are called *inner* (内音).
The so-called "manifestations of the heavens" (诸天隐出)
Are derived from this very principle.

The **Daoist** of ultimate attainment (至人) does not concern himself with mere hearing (闻),
While the common multitude hears yet cannot comprehend (众人闻而不能解).
If one does not concern himself with hearing (闻) and yet hears without comprehension (闻而不能解),
This is what is meant by *hard to hear* (难可闻).

Those who wish to hear and comprehend (欲闻且解),
Must seek beyond mere words (元他焉),
And discern the underlying intent (迹其意).

The Immortal Daoist pursues many methods (多方),
Yet the essence lies in harmonizing with the **Yang** (阳) to ascend together (俱升).
Through cultivation and refinement, **qi** (精) becomes **Pure Yang** (纯阳).
Thus, the scriptures are inscribed upon **Jade** (玉),
For **Jade** is the essence of **Pure Yang** (纯阳).

The **Upper Clarity** (上清) **qi** (气) descends to interact with the material world (下与物接),
Hence the bamboo slips are crimson (绛).
The crimson hue (绛) is the manifestation of the **Dao/Way** descending from the heavens (天道之降).
The **Pure Yang** (纯阳) is derived from the interplay of **One Yin, One Yang** (一阴一阳),
Through cultivation and refinement, it is perfected (修炼而成).
Since it originates from **Yin-Yang** (阴阳),
Its mixed composition forms the characters—
Thus, the **Yang** (阳) is called *red* (赤),
And the **Yin** (阴) is called *cinnabar* (丹).
The **Yin-Yang** interplay of **Dao/Way** and **Virtue/Power** (德) is reflected in these colors (迹道德之意见於物色),
And this is why it appears as such.

The scriptures bear the **Dao/Way** (载道),
The bamboo slips bear the writings (载文).
The **Dao/Way** is conveyed through the essence of **Pure Yang** (纯阳),
The writings are conveyed through the **Dao/Way** descending from the heavens (天道之降),
All in accordance with their proper symbolism (物宜).

The term *writings* (文) refers to the division of **Yin** and **Yang** (分阴分阳),
Alternating between softness and rigidity (迭用柔刚),
Combining and interweaving (参伍错综),
To establish principles and effects (以成理致).
In human affairs, it is the adornment (华),
In the seasons, it is the summer (夏).
The **Dao/Way** descends to complete its work (天道下济),
And all transformations reveal themselves in this season (万化呈露於斯时).

To analyze the refined essence of principles (析理精微),
To embrace the luminous mysteries of the **Dao/Way** (拥莹道妙),
Then the meaning of *vermilion-red* (赤) and *cinnabar* (丹) becomes clear.

The characters read: *True Person, Golden Person* (真人巾金巾).
Those who comprehend this meaning,
Understand the accumulation of **qi** (精) and refinement of **qi** (气)
To achieve the True (真).

The term *characters* (字) is used because,
Once the **Dao/Way** is perfected (道成),
One is held in high esteem (尊),
And thus their names are exalted (褒).
The *Laozi* says, *"The character is called **Dao/Way**"* (老子云字之日道),
Which aligns with this sentiment.

The *Golden Person* (金巾) and *True Person* (真人) are adornments,
For the **qi** (精气) generated by the **Dao/Way** (道)
All originates from the **lungs** (肺),
Hence their embellishments are described thus.

**Carrying Armor and Holding Talismans to Open the Seven Gates** (负甲持符开七门),
**Fire Soldiers with Talismans and Diagrams to Guard the Spirit Pass** (火兵符图备灵关).
*Carrying Armor* (负甲) refers to the creatures of the North—tortoises and serpents (龟蛇之属),
Which rely on **Yin** (阴) for self-defense (背阴以自卫).
*Fire Soldiers* (火兵) refers to the creatures of the South—crimson birds (朱乌之属),
Which face the **Yang** (阳) to subdue foes (向阳以制敌).

The *Seven Gates* (七门) are the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—
The so-called *Gate of Life* (生门).
When the *Gate of Life* is open (生门外通),
The senses (六入) and nature (识性) merge within.
Thus, *Zhuangzi* says: *"Hearing stops at the ears, the mind stops at the talisman"* (庄子日：听止於耳，心止於符).
Extending this logic,
One knows that the use of the six senses (六入)
All depends on the talismans held between the window and the door (焦牖之问).

Therefore, to *open the Seven Gates* (开七门),
One must first grasp the talismans (持符),
And by holding the talismans, one opens them—
Thus, the fault of reckless action (妄作) is avoided.

However, to *hold talismans and open gates* (持符开门),
One must first *carry armor* (负甲),
For when the *Gate of Life* is opened (生门一开),
The six evils (六贼) may enter,
And thus one must urgently defend oneself (自卫).
If defense is solid (固),
Then the True (真) will have no later calamity (后艰).
This is why one *carries armor, holds talismans, and opens the Seven Gates* (负甲持符开七门).

The *talisman diagrams* (符图) are the *River Diagram* (河图) and the *Nine Palaces* (九官),
All of which are my harmonious correspondences (皆我合也).
Three on the left, seven on the right (左三右七),
Wearing the Nine on the head and stepping on the One (戴九履一),
Two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet (二四为肩，六八为足).
This describes the entire body, from head to foot,
As nothing that the True (真) would engage with (元所不契),
Hence it can guard the *Spirit Pass* (灵关).

The *Spirit Pass* (灵关) is one of the *Three Passes* (三关),
Where the **Dao/Way** of the Three Talents (三才) is complete,
And humans align with heaven and earth (人配天地),
This is why it is called *Spirit* (灵).

The flourishing or decline of **spirit** (精神) is the root of life (生命之本).
Internally, it harmonizes with numerology (内与数合),
Externally, it corresponds with talismans (外与理符).
Thus, the fault of reckless movement (妄动) does not arise.

For those who govern the realm (治国者),
The gates and passes are controlled by talismans and seals (符节).
There has never been a case where
The opening and closing of gates and passes
Did not adhere to the use of talismans and seals (入出而不由符者也).

The gates are near (门近),
The passes are far (关远).
Once the gates are opened (近既启矣),
The distant passes cannot be fully secured (远者不可以元备),
This is why one employs *Fire Soldiers with Talismans and Diagrams to Guard the Spirit Pass* (火兵符图备灵关).

**Front Proud, Back Humble, High and Low Deployed** (前昂后卑高下陈).
*Front Proud* (前昂) refers to crimson birds (朱乌之属),
Which ascend (趋上).
*Back Humble* (后卑) refers to tortoises and serpents (龟蛇之属),
Which descend (趋下).
Since they are called *proud* (昂) and *humble* (卑),
They are also called *high* (高) and *low* (下),
For their *proud* (昂) and *humble* (卑) positions
Are derived from their ascending and descending natures (因其昂而高之，因其卑而下之).
*Deployed* (陈) means arranged and spread out (列而布之),
Which is the work of humans (人所为).

**Wielding a Sword a Hundred Zang Long and Dancing a Brocade Banner** (执剑百丈舞锦幡).
To *wield a sword a hundred zang long* (执剑百丈) is to display mighty force (威烈之壮).
To *dance a brocade banner* (舞锦幡) is to agitate the vibrant writings (文探之振).
These are all the implements of the *Fire Soldiers* (火兵).

The banner (幡) represents the multitude (表众),
To make them joyfully follow (使人乐从),
Hence it is danced.
The sword (剑) represents victory over foes (胜敌),
To make them fear and submit (使人畏服),
Hence it is wielded.

**Ten Disjunctions, the Empty Circle, and the Whirling Fan** (十绝盘空扇纷纭).
The *Nine Palaces* (九官) and *Ten Colors* (十色) interweave to form brocade (相属而为锦),
And separate to form disjunctions (相离而为绝).
The *Ten Disjunctions* (十绝) are named for colors that do not interweave (色不相属),
Yet they are actually banners (幡).
As the *Scripture on Transcending Mortality* (《度人经》) states:
*"The Ten Disjunctions are the Ten Spirited Banners"* (所谓十绝灵幡是矣).

The *gallbladder* (胆) section states:
*"Brocade robes of nine colors and green silk skirts"* (九色锦衣绿华裙).
The five proper colors (正色) are five in number,
With patterns and designs added to correspond with the *Nine Palaces* (九官),
While the wood element (木) emerges from the earth element (土),
Green and yellow blend to form green (青黄合体),
This is the tenth color (十色).

This chapter expounds upon the **Dao/Way** of the True Person (真人),
Emphasizing the expulsion of falsehoods and impurities (驱除邪伪),
And the preservation of the **spirit** (神守).
One must ensure that the talisman diagrams (符图) align with numerology (数),
And that the mind resonates with the **Dao/Way** (冥契胳合).
When external things approach (外物之来),
The True (真) will have no banner to resist (元帜可抵).

Thus, these ten colors are seamless and dense, without beginning or end.
Though falsehoods and impurities wander daily at its borders,
None can penetrate its harmony.

Yet still the principle of expulsion persists—
This is the "unconquerable" made to await the conquerable.
To make the unconquerable,
There is no other method than relying upon the **virtue/power** of awe and clarity.

This is why the ten colors are complete,
And correspond with the *gallbladder* section.

Yet the *gallbladder* belongs to Minor Yang,
With thunder and lightning shaking eight times,
Dragon flags sweeping the sky,
Serpents awaken from their slumber,
Heaven and Earth harmonize above and below.
Thus, its patterns coalesce into brocade—
The True Person stands apart from humanity,
Yet perfects the celestial within,
Independent yet unchanging,
Circulating without peril.

This is how it transcends all things,
And its patterns disperse into the *Spirited Banners*.

Thus, the upper text speaks of brocade banners,
The lower of the *Ten Spirited Banners*—
Their essence converges at the end.

*"The fire-bell tolls, descending through the smoke."*
The fire-bell is the *gallbladder*’s mighty voice.
Here, it speaks of relying upon awe and clarity.

Falsehoods and impurities sink into the lower **Dao/Way**,
While the fire-bell soars through the upper **Dao/Way**.
Yet the *gallbladder*’s voice ascends but does not descend,
So the murky and hidden find their advantage.
Thus, though the fire-bell’s force flies high and crowns the heavens,
Its use lies in its descent into the smoke.
The *gallbladder* section speaks of *casting*,
But here it speaks of *falling*—
For casting and falling complete each other’s meaning.
Smoke cannot descend,
Yet to say it "falls into the smoke" reveals its swift, striking force below.

Fire is a yang substance,
The bell is of yin nature.
The fire-bell is yang containing yin—
The *li* (separation) symbol.
*Li* above brings advantage,
*Li* below brings use—
This is the principle of life and **Dao/Way**.

*"Where is the Yellow Obelisk between the brows?"*
This is not mere branch—it is the root.

The *Heavenly Court* is the celestial station,
The *Yellow Court* is the earthly **Dao/Way**.
The earthly **Dao/Way** governs the interior,
Its force is downward,
Yet because it is interior and downward,
It emerges upward to connect—
The bell has an *obelisk* within it.
The *obelisk* is a high path at the crossroads.
Between the brows is truly the *Heavenly Court*,
Yet the Yellow Obelisk also resides there—
Hence its name.

The Yellow Obelisk is the grand thoroughfare
Where Heaven and Earth ascend and descend in joyful union,
Giving birth to ten thousand transformations.
Thus, the True Person’s **Dao/Way** lies in this subtle harmony.

This is how the upper and lower align as the Two Principles.

Yet the Yellow Court is positioned below,
While the Yellow Obelisk is above—
Hence the question: *"Where is it?"*
*"Where is it?"* expresses doubt about its location,
For the original **Dao/Way** is not there.
The original **Dao/Way** not being there,
The doubt itself is how it *is* there.

Branches are derived from the root but are not the root—
Since they are not the root,
They flourish and wither, changing daily and monthly,
While the root remains unchanged.
The True Person returns to the root,
Restores the mandate,
And stands alone in heaven.
Thus, those who steal and boast—
With their written contracts, sharp blades,
Their gluttony for food and wealth,
Their grasping and relentless pursuit—
All these are tied to branches.
Therefore, the True Person dons armor, wields talismans,
Opens gates and guards the passes,
Shuts out external things,
Turns light inward and reflects it back—
Then even the shifting clouds of movement and stillness
Arise from the root,
And the original emptiness dispels false accusations.
Thus, it is truly the root.

**Chapter of Purple Clarity**
*The Supreme Dao Lord of Purple Clarity*

The Sovereign of the Original is the Emperor of Creation, the Monarch of All Things, collectively named as the One Sovereign.

The first chapter divided into two, but this passage unites as one—
For the previous section expounded on the Dao of the True Person,
Shutting out external things, reflecting light inward,
Observing equality and inequality to discern the Original,
Realizing truth and attaining the Way—
Thus named the True Person.

The Sovereign of the Original, the Monarch of Creation,
All converging as the One Sovereign—
Mutually arising and interdependent,
Its Dao subtle and profound,
Beyond the grasp of thought or discrimination—
Only the True Person can comprehend it.

The Great Mysterious and Great Harmonious attendants stand erect,
Transforming and giving birth to all things, making me a transcendent.

The Great Mysterious—
The Northern Void Heaven, germinating and transforming things,
To solidify the numinous root.

The Great Harmonious—
The Eastern Azure Heaven, yielding and harmonizing life,
To manifest the numinous radiance.

These two deities attend in reverence,
Their homage to the One Sovereign—
Thus the Dao of transcendence is attained.

Though the Dao of transcendence is vast,
Its essence lies in preserving life.

From the North’s binding to the Central Yang,
The principle of transformation and birth is complete here.
Yet the four seasons complete the year,
And the Heavenly Dao is whole—
To halt at Central Yang is but its beginning.

Ascend ten heavens with a jade chariot,
Day and night for seven days, cease not in contemplation.
Heaven’s number is nine,
Yet ten heavens are spoken of—
One is void, as in the Great Yield’s void one,
Where the marvelous origin resides.

The ancient True Persons,
Realizing truth and attaining the Way,
Understood the One Sovereign’s intent—
Thus they could transcend beyond the nine heavens,
Solely wandering in the void’s realm—
This is the ascent of ten heavens.

Ascending, they ride the waves of Yang,
Hence called the Jade Wheel.
Jade is pure Yang;
Wheel is the lower Dao.
Speaking of ascending upon pure Yang’s qi,
From below to above.

When Yang stirs from below,
It is the time of return.
Seven days of return—
The number of return—
Contemplate to ascend above.

To ascend upon pure Yang’s qi—
This is no matter of indulging in sleep.
The ancients, upon hearing the Dao,
For seven days abandoned licentious thoughts,
Till their bones stood erect.
Erect—
The opposite of sleep.

Yet this is the foundation of cultivation’s work—
If you practice it, you may endure long.
Accumulating merit and refining—
Not natural, but achieved.

“Transforming and giving birth to all things, making me a transcendent”—
This is the Emperor’s decree.
The Emperor’s decree—
Natural and inevitable.

Thus, *my* self is the Inner Dao.
If you practice it, you may endure long—
This is the result of learning.
Learning’s result—
Not natural.

Thus, the Dao is neither natural nor unnatural.
This text alone declares the unnatural as false,
To establish its teaching.
When teaching is established,
Learning and the natural align in unity.

This arises from sincerity and singularity—
Sincerity and singularity—
The matter of accumulating merit and refining.

Sincerity—
Original doubt.
Singularity—
No duplicity.
Doubt the things of the world,
And the world responds in kind.
No duplicity in the heart,
And the spirit congeals.

The merchant of Shangqiu, believing in falsehood as truth,
Swam the river and obtained a pearl—
Original doubt, and the world responds.
The hunched old man of Cao,
Refused to exchange all things for a cicada’s wing,
Thus he departed and did not return—
No duplicity, and the spirit congeals.

Those who learn the Dao,
Nurture the Three Officials in thought,
And all spirits respond to contemplation—
Sincerity is complete.

Yet if questioned by things,
Few escape loss and fall.
Thus, sever the green of causes,
Abandon fame and gain,
With a single heart devoted to the Dao—
Then the Dao may be attained.

Guard internally with unyielding truth,
In emptiness, serene and tranquil—
The spirit naturally manifests.

Internal guarding is firm and unyielding—
The work of sincerity and singularity.
Internal guarding—
No other seeking.
No other seeking—
Then singularity is achieved.
Firm and unyielding—
Hold fast and do not abandon.
Hold fast and do not abandon—
Then sincerity is complete.
Singularity and no other seeking—
Truth is not lost.
Adding hold fast and do not abandon—
This is the truth within truth.

Yet singularity and no other seeking,
Hold fast and do not abandon—
May lead to obstruction and stagnation,
Thus emptiness and tranquility
Save from such obstruction.
Emptiness—
Not fixating on internal guarding.
Tranquility—
Not fixating on firmness.
Thus internal guarding and firmness are clinging to methods,
Emptiness and tranquility are beyond forms—
Without clinging to methods, one cannot enter the Dao,
Without transcending forms, one cannot attain the Dao.
Attaining the Dao—
No need to seek the spirit,
For the spirit naturally manifests itself.

**Chapter of the Hundred Grains**
The fruits of the hundred grains are the essence of the earth,
Their five flavors—external beauty, yet demonic and foul.

The essence of the earth—
Insufficient to nourish the spirit, yet able to nourish the form.
Demonically foul—
Insufficient to nourish the form, yet their stench is all the more vile.
To call foul things beautiful—
All know beauty’s true nature is evil.

Insufficient to nourish the spirit yet called essence—
Speaking of what may still aid the true self.
For it clings to the earth, there is a principle of affinity with the low.
This cannot compare with ascending ten heavens.

Stench disrupts the clarity of the spirit,
Babying qi dissipates—
How then return to youth?
The three souls flit aimlessly, the soul’s essence decays.

The spirit’s clarity,
With purity, emptiness, and openness as ideal—
If indulged in food and drink, drowned in vulgar qi,
Its purity and emptiness are lost—
Thus stench disrupts.

Babying qi—
Received from Heaven, pristine and harmonious,
Naturally firm and congealed within.
Yet as sight, hearing, eating, and breathing assault from without,
Day by day, one orifice is pierced—
Thus babying qi dissipates.

When the spirit’s clarity is disrupted daily,
This is not the way to return to youth.
When babying qi is scattered,
This is not the way to restore infancy.
The soul is the essence of life—
If the spirit is scattered throughout life, it is never vital—
Thus the three souls flit aimlessly.
The soul is bound to the form—
When babying qi is lost, the body decays—
Thus the soul’s essence decays.

The **Dao of Nourishment**—
Why not consume the **Qi of Grand Harmony’s essence**,
Thus ensuring life’s vitality without death—
**Huangning** is where one attains **mixed repose**.

Human **qi** gathers to sustain life—
When gathered, it brings birth;
When scattered, it brings death—
Thus, those who consume **qi** do so to keep it gathered, never dispersed.

**Grand Harmony** is the **Qi of Minor Yang**,
Softly yielding yet ever giving birth—
The mouth is its **orifice**,
Rinsing and swallowing **numinous elixir**,
To generate **radiant luster**.

These are the **fundamentals of life’s Dao**,
No need for external aids—
Self-sufficient in nourishment,
Thus one attains **no-death**.

**Huangning** is the **repose of mixed vitality**,
The **spleen’s office** consumes grains and scatters **qi**,
Overseeing all maladies—
Thus it ceaselessly moves, never still.

Now, by nourishing **true qi** alone,
No need for external aids—
The **spleen’s original function** is fulfilled,
Thus one attains **repose and vitality**.

The text states:
*"In the previous chapter, it was said that
Within, one guards the **unyielding True** of **True qi**,
In the **emptiness** of the **center**, tranquil and undisturbed, the spirit rules itself—
This is the accumulation of **refinement’s merit**, to forge the **True Person**,
Thus this chapter utterly rejects external aids,
Nourishing with **true qi** alone,
And one may attain **no-death**."*

For those **beginning their studies**,
**Heavenly True** is yet unfulfilled,
The spirit’s guard is not yet firm—
Thus, to supplement **life’s Dao**,
It is because the **True** is still incomplete,
And the nourishment of external aids
Cannot yet be utterly abandoned.

Hence, **Heaven** produces **essence** to nourish the spirit,
**Earth** produces **essence** to nourish the form—
The **spleen** and **stomach**, harmonizing **virtue** and **merit**,
Bestow **fragrant luster** and **flourishing vitality**,
Their supplementation is vast indeed.

Therefore, the **Bright Granary** (明童) oversees the blending of grains,
And draws upon the five flavors—
Refining and transforming to renew,
Moving the **primordial methods**.

Its dwelling place is called the **Huangting**.
**Ting** is the **land of governance’s spread**,
Where **Lao Jun** (老君) in the **center** acts with purpose.

When **refinement’s merit** is accumulated and perfected,
Within, one guards the **unyielding True**—
All grains and five flavors are utterly abandoned,
In the **emptiness** of the **center**, tranquil and undisturbed,
The **spleen** and **stomach** become like a **void chamber**,
Thus what is taken in is called **Huangning**.
**Huangning**—
Though not yet severed from **form and color**,
Approaches the **stillness of motionless repose**.

This is why the **Ten Heavenly True Persons** (十天真人)
Originally attain **naturalness**—
Their foundation lies here.

The **Huangting Inner-External Jade Landscape Classic** concludes.
