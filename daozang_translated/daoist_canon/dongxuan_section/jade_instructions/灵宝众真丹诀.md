### **Method for the Elixir of Returned Soul, with Preface**

Man is endowed by the Five Phases and constrained by the Five Constants, thus becoming prey to the Five Flavors and assailed by the Eight Winds. From the moment of suckling milk to the decrepitude of old age, none escape death by wind. Some perish from overindulgence in food, others from hunger; some from excessive drink, others from parched thirst. Some consume salty or sour flavors, others sip pungent or acrid brews. Some, fearing heat, stand in drafts; others, loathing cold, draw near to fire. Some gaze at the moon in the courtyard; others rest beneath trees in the frost. Some suffer cuts to the flesh; others endure bruises to their limbs. Some ingest desiccating medicines; others guzzle cold water. Some abstain too long from the bedchamber; others expend their essence in excess. Thus, wind rushes into the hundred apertures, and poison gathers in the four limbs, causing hands and feet to falter, speech to falter and slur.

Some endure pain that bores into the marrow; others suffer numbness that creeps over the skin. Some itch as if infested by worms; others grow rigid as iron or stone. Some cough up copious phlegm, forget easily, rage often, their blood and vessels stagnant, their flesh withered and dry. Some lie bedridden for years, able to rise only briefly; others swell in the face and head, living yet as if dead. Some feel no illness at all, only to die suddenly and without warning. In men, wind is drawn in by their yang; in women, wind follows their blood. None fail to meet their end through wind.

Yet the world cannot cure this wind. They merely attack the interior with medicines—how can decoctions and drafts expel wind lodged in the Five Viscera, Six Bowels, four limbs, and hundred vessels? Even if one seeks treatment and the physician prescribes the wrong remedy—though he be versed in the *Nanjing* and *Suwen*, though he boast three generations of flawless cures—how could he dispel such deep-seated afflictions?

I dwelled long on Mount Taibai, bearing illness for years. A thousand medicines were tried, yet none brought relief. Later, an old man bestowed upon me this elixir. After ingesting but five grains, my ailments gradually faded. I bowed my head to heaven, entreating him for the method. Only after he exacted an oath of secrecy did he deign to transmit it. Thus, I recorded it upon my person and stored it in the sacred chamber. Those who come upon it later must revere it. Do not transmit it lightly, lest you invite calamity upon yourself. Follow the method in refinement, and what fear is there that it will not work wonders?

The roasted medicine governs the calcined medicine; the calcined medicine governs the boiled medicine; the boiled medicine governs the raw medicine. The raw medicine activates the boiled medicine; the boiled medicine activates the raw medicine. The raw medicine activates the roasted medicine; the roasted medicine activates the calcined medicine. They restrain and activate one another in turn, with ruler and minister complete, father and son firmly established. Thereafter, yin and yang each find their proper course.

Yang medicines govern yin to draw forth yin; yin medicines govern yang to draw forth yang. Though this elixir cannot refine one into an immortal, those who obtain it need only ingest a mung bean’s worth to remain free of illness for the span of their allotted years. If one already suffers from wind afflictions or injuries to the limbs and joints—even if movement has been impossible for five or ten years—ingesting a single grain as prescribed will bring effect. For severe cases, no more than ten grains are needed.

If someone dies suddenly but their heart has not yet grown cold, take one grain of the elixir, mix it with vinegar, and rub it into the navel a thousand times or more. The warmth will gradually spread from the navel in all directions. Once the eyes open, administer another grain dissolved in warm vinegar, and the person will revive. For all wind-related illnesses, regardless of how long they have persisted, the elixir’s divine efficacy is beyond full description.

Each pill is the size of a mustard seed. Dry them in the sun and store them. For the afflicted, regardless of how long the illness has endured, first administer half a tael of *Hongxue* (Red Snow) or *Tongzhong San* tea.

If the wind-stasis is severe, administer one tael of the elixir, wait a while, then follow with hot tea to induce the patient to purge two or three times. Afterward, prepare ginger and bean broth as prescribed, and administer one grain. Have another person use their warm hands to massage the afflicted area alternately. After a while, the heat will penetrate deeply, and the patient will feel as though a fiery substance moves through the flesh to the painful spot, whereupon the suffering will vanish immediately.

For those bedridden with wind-illness for a hundred or two hundred days—or even a year—after taking one grain, they will immediately be able to walk as if never afflicted. In the most severe cases, after each purging, administer one grain of the elixir, then wait three to five days before repeating the process: first purging with *Hongxue*, then taking the elixir. No more than ten to twenty grains should be taken daily until full recovery.

For those suffering from chronic injuries—where pain flares with overcast skies and movement is impossible—the elixir is especially effective, requiring only one or two grains. For those who take this medicine in abundance, after recovery, its power will settle beneath the sole of the foot—left for men, right for women. Whenever distress arises, simply focus the mind on the elixir, and its efficacy will respond at will.

This medicine’s divine potency defies mortal comprehension. Its method of preparation follows:

- Twenty-four sheets of gold foil
- One tael and one *fen* of *guangmingsha* (bright cinnabar), ground to a fine powder
- Three *da fen* of realgar, washed in lye from burnt wheat stalks and boiled for three days, then ground to a fine powder
- Three *da fen* of *shitingzhi* (stone garden fat), boiled in vinegar for three days, then ground to a fine powder
- Three *da fen* each of the following, ground to a fine powder and used raw: ox bezoar, musk, *dounaoqi* (navel of a male musk deer), tiger bone, dragon’s teeth
- Three *da fen* each of: *yangqishi* (actinolite), *cimaoshi* (magnetite), *zishiying* (amethyst), *zirantong* (pyrite), *changlishi* (longitudinal stone)
- Five *da fen* each of: *yuanzhi* (polygala), *baji* (morinda), *xuanshen* (scrophularia), *wuta* (aconite), *xianlingpi* (epimedium)
- Six *da fen* each of: *qingmuxiang* (saussurea), *roudoukou* (nutmeg), dried deer antler resembling dried persimmon, *rougui* (cinnamon)
- Three *da fen* each of: *yanhusuo* (corydalis), *mulu* (chuanxiong)

Place the following four ingredients together in a jar, covered with gold foil (not sealed): sulfur, realgar, cinnabar, and pyrite. Heat with fire for three days, keeping the flame three inches from the jar to avoid excessive heat.

Place the following four ingredients together in another jar, also covered with gold foil: actinolite, magnetite, amethyst, and longitudinal stone. Bury half the jar in ash, leaving the mouth unsealed, and heat for three days. On the first day, keep the flame two inches from the jar; on the second, one inch; on the third, cluster the flame around the jar until it glows red-hot by nightfall, eliminating all fire toxicity.

Grind ten taels of *zhongru* (stalactite) with a jade pestle for seven days until it becomes a fine powder. Place it in a silk pouch, tie it securely, and suspend it in a pot with two *dou* of water. Boil until one *dou* remains, then take three *ge* of this *zhongru* water to grind raw rhinoceros horn one thousand times. Set this water aside separately. When adding *zaojiaoren* (gleditsia seeds), grind them together with this water.

Boil the remaining *zhongru* water with the five ingredients—*yuanzhi* and the others—adding five *da fen* of crushed *manjingzi* (vitex). Reduce the liquid to seven *sheng*, then strain and retain the decoction. Use this medicinal liquid to boil the four ingredients—*qingmuxiang* and the others—until four *sheng* remain, then strain. Further reduce this liquid to boil *banxia* (prepared pinellia, washed and crushed) and *danggui* (angelica, finely chopped), each one tael, until three *sheng* remain. Strain and clarify the liquid.

Combine one *sheng* each of rehmannia juice, ash-free wine, and boy’s urine with the three *sheng* of medicinal liquid, totaling six *sheng*. Simmer in a clean vessel over gentle heat until reduced to one *sheng*. Add all the prepared mineral medicines, stirring continuously until the mixture resembles thin congee. Remove from heat and add the five raw medicinal powders—ox bezoar and the others—stirring thoroughly. Then add six *da fen* of *zaojiaoren* (gleditsia seeds, toasted and shelled, ground to powder) and two *fen* of *longnao* (borneol), ground to a fine powder in a mortar. Incorporate the rhinoceros horn juice and grind the entire mixture in a mortar with a strong man for three thousand strokes until extremely thick. Form into pills the size of mustard seeds, ensuring they are not too large.

This medicine’s transformative efficacy is unparalleled. After preparation, divide it into three equal portions arranged like the character *pin* (品). Each portion is taken as one dose.

Additionally, refine one tael of *mangxiao* (mirabilite) into *poguan dan* (Breaking-the-Coffin Elixir). Use the finest Sichuan mirabilite, which has sharp, crystalline edges. Heat it in a crucible until all moisture evaporates, then grind to a powder and incorporate into the medicine.

For sudden death, regardless of the condition, if the limbs have not yet stiffened, break open the coffin, pry open the teeth, and drip one grain dissolved in hot vinegar. If it passes the throat, revival is nearly certain, with eight or nine out of ten saved. The pills should be the size of mung beans; the rest of the medicine follows the verses.

*Sulfur and cinnabar rest atop copper*—the first four mineral medicines are placed in the jar in this order and heated as prescribed.
*Magnetite, actinolite, longitudinal stone, and amethyst lead the way*—the latter four mineral medicines are placed in the jar in this order and heated as prescribed.
*Gold above, below, and twice in the center*—when calcining the medicines, use gold foil: three sheets above, three below, and two in the center to separate the minerals.
*Purple burns, copper roasts, each for a day’s rest*—if using amethyst, heat the jar; if using pyrite, roast the jar, each for one day only.
*Boil the stalactite with four or five, uniting them as one*—"boil" here means decoct. Use stalactite to decoct the previous twenty ingredients in two *dou* of water until one *dou* remains, thus uniting them.

To refine once more requires eleven transformations.
Take the one *dou* of stalactite decoction prepared earlier and decoct eleven herbal medicines—hence the term "eleven transformations."
Boil until reduced to three *sheng*, then remove.
Blend with rehmannia, boy’s urine, and wine—these three ingredients.
When the fiery stones return to the tranquil chamber, the fire is withdrawn and the mineral medicines added.
Wait until the texture resembles flesh and the five fresh ingredients—ox bezoar and the five flavors—are incorporated.
Store separately in a vessel holding three *ge* of water, and grind with a rhinoceros horn, turning it a thousand times externally.

**Method for Purple-Gold Cinnabar**
Take half a *jin* of finest cinnabar (shimmering like dawn silk), three *liang* of azurite, and two *liang* of realgar and orpiment. Using an iron key, crush all into pieces the size of soap beans.
Select a jar with a capacity of one *sheng*, place the three ingredients inside, and boil with salt-bitter water for twenty-one days, maintaining a gentle simmer like fish eyes—ensure it does not overflow.
Remove one grain of cinnabar, wash with water, and examine in the light: if it appears golden, cease boiling. If red or black halos remain, boil for another seven days. Remove, dry, and heat over fire to expel yin-blackness, then store in a cabinet.
Take two *jin* of mirabilite flowers and one *liang* of nitre. Melt in a jar, pulverize, and melt again, then grind into fine powder. Pack into a cabinet, first layering with realgar and orpiment, then filling with salt powder to within three *fen* of the rim. Seal with cloth, cover with a ground tile, and seal tightly with Six-One Mud, ensuring no gaps.
Fire with four *liang* of heat for seven days.
Fire with six *liang* of heat for twenty-eight days.
Fire with half a *jin* of heat for fourteen days.
Fire with three *jin* of heat to calcine.
Once cooled, steep in cow’s milk contained in a bamboo tube, steam with black soybean rice three times, then soak in cold spring water for three days. Remove the rice, steam again to expel yin-blackness.
Grind finely, mix with paper mulberry juice to form pills the size of millet grains. Take three pills daily with wine to cure thirty-six types of wind-induced paralysis, tendon and bone wind-madness, wind-archer’s wind, kidney viscera wind-heat, poisonous wind, and all cold winds. Prolonged use transforms skin, flesh, and hair, prolongs life, lightens the body—its merits cannot be fully enumerated.
Take four *liang* and place in the cabinet as before: first layer with realgar and orpiment, then alternate layers of calcined and raw cinnabar until all four *liang* of raw cinnabar are used. Top with calcined cinnabar, then realgar and orpiment, and cover with cabinet powder. Seal as before and nurture with fire for forty-nine days.
Upon completion, repeat the process layer by layer, always using four *liang* as the base.

**Method for Golden-Green Cinnabar to Transform Gold Millet**
Cures all winds, prolongs life, preserves youth, heals myriad diseases, and transmutes treasures.
First, mold a clay ball using red lead, white clay, tile powder, mirabilite, and vinegar-soaked wax as the core—ensure no cracks. Dry in shade, pierce a hole, remove the wax, and fire.
Take fine, luminous cinnabar, grind to powder, and pack into a paper tube to fill the ball. Knead earthworm-mixed clay with the ball’s mud until pliable, then seal the hole. Dry, then fit with an iron ring and place in an iron crucible. Pour molten lead into the crucible, leaving two *cun* of space above. Nurture with chaff fire, keeping the lead soft.
After one hundred twenty days, increase the fire, then remove. Quench on the ground, cool, and extract the medicine—it will resemble green-purple snail shells. Discard black residue.
Divide the medicine in half: store one portion in a green bamboo tube, steam with cow’s milk five times, changing the milk thrice (the milk skin can treat *jianzeng*). Remove, bury in a pit for three nights.
Grind finely, mix with millet rice to form pills the size of millet grains.
For those aged forty: one pill daily.
For those aged fifty: two pills daily.
For those aged sixty: three pills daily.
Its potency is unique—do not exceed the dosage.
Grind the remaining medicine into fine powder. In a crucible, layer with one *liang* of fine yellow vitriol, covering top and bottom with cinnabar powder. Seal the lid, dry, then nurture in ash fire for forty-nine days. Fire intensely until cool, and all will transform into gold millet.
Take one *shao* of mouse-tail silver (three *liang*), and half a *fen* of true *geng* metal. First melt the silver in a crucible, then add three or four grains of millet—they will transmute into true metal, the true Western essence.
For the furnace, use three *da liang* of fire. Place the ball in the lead crucible, adjusting size as needed. Position the ball with its hole facing upward within the lead crucible.
All procedures must be timed precisely.

**Method for Feather-Transformation River Chariot**
Take four *liang* of luminous cinnabar, crush into pieces the size of soap beans.
Take half a *liang* of Gua Prefecture yellow vitriol.
Mix the above with three-year-old rice vinegar, grinding into a paste. Coat the cinnabar pieces one by one, then dry.
Take half a *liang* of top-grade Western *geng* metal, hammer into thin sheets, cut into small pieces, and wrap the cinnabar.
Then take one *liang* each of Wu Du’s finest realgar and azurite, grind finely, and boil with left-flavor decoction until viscous. Shape the realgar-azurite powder into small cakes, wrap the cinnabar, dry, then coat with spirit-vinegar clay. Wrap once more, then set aside to dry.
Use true lead to make a cabinet, arranging the lead *ba* with method.
Fire three times, each time grinding and sifting as prescribed.

Take six *liang* of lead-silver and hammer into a lidded container. The joint where the lid meets the body must be recessed two *cun* and four *fen* deep, with the upper opening one *cun* and two *fen* in both depth and width. Line the bottom of the container with true lead to a thickness of two *fen*, then arrange the cinnabar grains like lotus seeds. Cover with another layer of true lead, then add more cinnabar, repeating the layers until all is used. Seal the container with true lead, then secure it with a silver clamp. Seal tightly with Six-One Clay and set aside to dry.

Take five *jin* of *guan* salt, refine twice with saltpeter, then grind and sift finely. Select an iron crucible large enough to hold the previous container with some space. Pack the *guan* salt into the crucible, embedding the container within it to serve as the outer cabinet. Fill the gaps with salt, seal the lid, and secure it with iron rods. Set aside to dry.

Dig an earthen furnace one *chi* and six *cun* deep, one *chi* and four *cun* wide. Fire with horse dung and chaff for forty-nine days. Open the crucible, remove the inner cabinet with iron rods, and observe: if the silver container has turned golden, cease firing and retrieve it. If not, continue firing for another seven days before opening. Once cool, pry open the container and scrape off the yellow vitriol and azurite, reserving one grain. Grind finely, then take two *liang* of mercury in a pan and gently heat the medicine until it forms pellets the size of half a small bean. Sprinkle these onto the mercury, which will then dry and forge into a treasure. Guard this well and do not use it lightly—this is the First Transformation.

Take twelve *liang* of luminous cinnabar, grind to powder, and mix with the previously refined cinnabar. As before, knead into a paste with fine vinegar and place into the inner cabinet. Grind and sift finely, then pack into the cabinet. Line the bottom with the previously scraped yellow vitriol, ground finely, then place the cinnabar paste inside. Seal the lid, fill the gaps with cabinet powder, and seal as before. Set aside to dry, then place into the crucible. Prepare another clay furnace, add half a *jin* of grass ash, and nurture with fire for one hundred and twenty days. Finally, apply intense fire to refine. Retrieve the medicine, which should now resemble top-grade Western metal—this is the Second Transformation, the Purple Gold River Chariot.

If intending to ingest it, first detoxify by soaking in cold spring water for a month, then steam with milk and form into pills with paper mulberry juice, each the size of a millet grain. This prolongs life and cures all diseases; take no more than one pill daily. If one consumes a full *liang* with sincere devotion, one’s lifespan will extend five *jiazi* cycles. This method is sacred and must not be disclosed. If recklessly shared with the unworthy, misfortune will befall the transgressor.

Take one *jin* of luminous cinnabar, grind finely, and mix with left-flavor decoction. Select a crucible large enough to hold the medicine, then pack the mixed cinnabar into an outer cabinet. Grind the previously refined cinnabar, mix with vinegar into a clay, and line the inner cabinet. Once dry, add eight *liang* of mercury and two *liang* of fire. Place into the furnace and nurture for one hundred and twenty days to form purple gold. Do not use this yet; first offer it to a sacred mountain, report to the Supreme Mystery, and inscribe your name in the Immortal Register. Store the divine chamber carefully. When needed, place it in ash with six *liang* of mercury and two *liang* of fire. Nurture for one *fu* period, and it will become true top-grade Western metal—this is the Third Transformation, the Divine Chamber River Chariot.

**Method for Golden Flower Yellow Sprouts**
Take half a *jin* each of raw silver sprouts and raw mercury. Melt the sprouts and merge with the mercury to form a silver paste. If insufficient, add more wet silver to meet the original quantity. Select a high-quality oil bottle from Hunan, capable of holding two *jin*, and large enough to contain the medicine with extra space. Seal the bottle thoroughly, ensuring the top remains flat for easy inversion. Prepare a second, slightly larger bottle to serve as the outer cabinet, leaving it unsealed and temporarily covered.

Place the bottle on three nails, then construct a furnace with three sections, symbolizing the Three Powers. In the middle layer, install three nails horizontally, and include two doors: a larger front door four *cun* high, and a smaller rear door one and a half *cun* high. The lower fire chamber should be three sections long, each four *cun*, and always covered with ash. When adding fire, place charcoal at the center; charcoal briquettes work best.

Begin firing in the eleventh month, continuing for ten months. For the first sixty days, use martial fire, slightly stronger than usual. Cover the furnace with a basin, leaving a star-shaped opening about one *cun* wide. From midnight, keep the medicine bottle’s top facing upward. At noon, invert it so the top faces downward, then return it to the original position by midnight. Rotate only the inner bottle, leaving the outer one stationary. After each rotation, recover the furnace.

The upper layer of the furnace should resemble a rice cooker, with the star-shaped opening. From midnight, cover it with a piece of paper, removing it at the appointed time. If the fire timing is precise and unerring, each day and night will form one seal. By the fifth month, weigh the contents: if mercury is lacking, replenish to the required amount. Once the medicine solidifies into a single mass, it has taken form. Break the bottle, retrieve the medicine, grind, wash, and refine until fine. Dry thoroughly in the sun.

Add new mercury, one-third the amount of the medicine, and press it evenly into the paste. Do not seal; follow the previous fire regimen and nurture for a full month. Retrieve, wash, and dry, then continue nurturing as before. After ten months, the medicine will develop cinnabar spots—this is the essence of the medicine, emerging from the mother’s womb, weighing about half a *jin* and appearing brown. It has now been refined by fire. Store in a separate vessel.

After sixty days of martial fire, the medicine will turn a brilliant red. Remove the fire toxin, and it can be ingested to prolong life and enhance vitality—its virtues are beyond description. If the fire is too intense after ten months, the medicine may liquefy. Reduce the fire to restore its original state. Return the medicine’s mother to its former state, add half a *jin* of raw mercury, and nurture for another month. The surface will again turn brown. Continue nurturing for a full year.

Gather the aforementioned medicine to create worldly wealth—it has been refined by fire and appears a lustrous white. If one seeks worldly profit, mercury may be added month by month. Should mercury be added nine times, nurturing it to a full *jin*, the medicine becomes wondrous, granting eternal existence in the world while curing all ailments. This is the Nine-Cauldron Elixir, its power perfected for ascension. The *Cantong Qi* calls it "Golden Flower," and some refer to it as the External Elixir. This is a most secret formula, known only to one or two on Mount Su; it must not be lightly disclosed.

Master Ji’s White Method:
The Most High, pitying the struggles of scholars and the unmet aspirations of superior men, set forth this teaching to aid practitioners, thus revealing this formula.

- White Tiger: thirty *liang*
- Supreme Yin Mysterious Essence: twelve *liang*
- Alum: twelve *liang*
- Lead Powder: eight *liang*

Grind the above three ingredients into powder and blend with the left-hand flavor to form a paste. First, mold eight *liang* of wax into the shape of a parrot. Then coat the wax parrot entirely with the medicinal paste. Apply sweet clay over the paste, ensuring full coverage, and make the layer about half a *cun* thick. Open a small hole the size of a bean at the top. Dry it in the sun, then burn away the wax with fire. Place the aforementioned Black Warrior into the hole, sealing it again with the medicinal paste. Proceed with gentle fire and refine for sixty-three days. The Black Warrior will dry completely, its color resembling silver—this is called Silver Essence.

Take one *liang* of this refined essence and add it to one *jin* of wrought copper, which will dissolve entirely into paste—this is the method of subduing. If the medicinal substances are not refined by fire, they will disrupt the order of copper and iron, failing to achieve mastery.

Master Ba’s name is Ji, and "White" is another designation for the Black Warrior. Subdued substances can be incorporated—yet they are unsuitable for ingestion. Why is this?

This is the method of transformation, not the true gate of profound mystery. The "Ji White" refers to mercury and lead. The "able to whiten" denotes this transformation and subjugation—hence Master Ba is also called Master Ji White. There is also a method of boiling with oil and vinegar, detailed in another formula.

**Nine-Turn Lead Refinement Method**
Take ten *jin* of lead and one *jin* of mercury, melt them in a vessel over gentle fire, and skim off the black skin with an iron spoon until exhausted. Each time, pour it onto the ground, then return it to the vessel and melt again—repeat this nine times in total. Then add the mercury and heat vigorously until it turns the color of green sand; if it scatters, sprinkle it with vinegar and bran, and it will transform into green sand. Next, place it in an iron vessel with vinegar, pour the sand into the vinegar, and grind it thoroughly with an iron spoon. Boil it again with vinegar, then collect the lead yellow on a tile, let it dry, and mix it with the juice of yellow cow dung (or finely ground barley) to form balls the size of pigeon eggs or cakes. Dry them in the sun—one version says to dry them in the shade. Arrange them in a bellows furnace and blow to extract the lead essence, called Lead Elixir. Its nature is moist; further heat it in a vessel until fully cooked, its color turning entirely red. Then grind it again in vinegar until smooth, let it settle on a tile to dry, and heat it in a vessel until it turns purple. In another vessel, take one *sheng* of good wine and add two *liang* of red salt, mixing them well. Then add the purple elixir, stirring it into the wine until it crystallizes—this is called Nine-Return Lead. The "nine" denotes the elixir’s name: Nine-Turn Purple Lead Elixir.

**Divine Transformation Gold Elixir Method**
- *Ting* juice: three *liang*
- Mountain pond rock salt: two *liang* (ground as fine as flour)
- Fire-subdued northern sulfur: one *jin* (transparent, ground to powder)

Mix these three ingredients evenly. Take an iron box, grind fine ink with rice vinegar, and apply a thick coat inside the box three times; let it dry. Place the three ingredients inside, warm the box over gentle fire until the medicine melts into liquid, and the northern *ting* turns dark. Stop the fire and let it congeal. Then take four *liang* of saltpeter, grind it to powder, and press it firmly into the base of the box. Seal the base with dry paper, then secure the lid. Place the box in a crucible and seal it with method paste. The paste is made from crow’s-gate hematite (the color of a rooster’s comb), left-turning oyster shell, and red halloysite—each finely ground to powder—mixed with the juice of fire-subdued northern *ting*. Pound them in a mortar over a thousand times, then use this to seal the joints, ensuring firmness and density. Secure the crucible lid with an iron latch, making it tightly sealed. Let it dry in the shade.

Take three *jin* or more of lead, melt it in a crucible, and use a small iron ladle to coat the base of the box evenly on all sides. Gradually pour more molten lead into the crucible until it reaches two *cun* above the box. Choose an auspicious day and begin firing at midnight during the *zi* hour, starting with six *liang* of fuel and increasing by one *liang* each day until sixty days are complete. Once the crucible cools, chip away the black lead, open the box, and retrieve the medicine—it will be truly golden in color. Grind it finely in a mortar.

- Northern *ting* sand: three *liang* (white and bright)
- Yellow wax: one and a half *fen* (melted into liquid and mixed evenly with the northern *ting*)

Form this into a ball and wrap it in paper. Take one *dou* of slaked lime and place half in a jar, packing it tightly. Scoop out a hollow, place the northern *ting* inside, then cover it with the remaining slaked lime, packing it as before. Initially use three *jin* of fire to nurture it, gradually increasing to five or seven *jin*. After three *fu* periods, use ten *jin* of fire to heat it until red-hot. Once the fire subsides and it cools, remove it and place it in a raw silk bag. Dig a pit large enough to hold five to seven *sheng*, fill it with water, and place a fine porcelain bowl inside. Suspend the bag of northern *ting* over the bowl with a rod, then cover it with a tile basin, sealing the edges with wet earth to prevent air leaks. After three *fu* periods, it will dissolve into water. Mix this water with the aforementioned two ingredients.

- Refined metal (*geng*): ten *liang*
- Mercury: fifty *liang*

Store these in a jar and keep them warm over fire. Heat the *geng* until red-hot, then add it to the mercury, stirring with a willow twig until fully dissolved. Add three *jin* of divine flowers and grind them with the gold paste until fine. Place them in a large cauldron, level the mixture, and cover the cauldron with a basin, sealing it with paste to ensure airtightness. Heat gently to allow the mercury to volatilize completely. Then rinse the divine flowers with boiling water until their flavor is gone. Dry the *geng* powder in the sun, grind it finely, and add it to the medicine.

- Realgar: eight *liang* (the color of a rooster’s comb, ground to powder)
- Orpiment: eight *liang* (transparent leaf-like, ground to powder)
- Halite: four *liang* (ground to powder)
- Gold powder: ten *liang*

Grind these five ingredients to powder. Prepare another crucible, following the previous method: grind fine ink with rice vinegar and apply it evenly inside the box three times; let it dry. Place the medicine inside and warm the box over gentle fire until the medicine melts into liquid. Follow the previous method: add four *liang* of saltpeter, ground to powder, press it firmly into the base of the box, seal it with dry paper, then secure the lid and place it in the crucible. Seal the joints with method paste as before, secure the lid with an iron latch, and let it dry in the shade.

Following the previous method, first take three *jin* of lead and melt it into liquid in a Yao vessel, then use an iron ladle to scoop and apply it evenly around the base of the box. Melt more lead and gradually fill the crucible until it reaches two *cun* above the box. As before, select an auspicious day and begin the fire at midnight during the *zi* hour. The firing regimen follows the previous method: start with six *liang*, increasing by one *liang* each day, until sixty days are complete.

Once the crucible and box have cooled, use an iron chisel to remove the black lead and retrieve the box. The medicine inside should have turned the color of purple gold. Grind one *fen* of it finely in a mortar, and it can transmute one *jin* of mercury into refined purple-gold. This is not of the mortal world but a secret transmission from the immortals. For those who seek to aid their Dao, know when to be content.

**Mercury:** one *jin*
**Medicine:** one *fen*

Place the medicine atop the mercury in a new iron pan, cover it with a tea bowl, and seal it properly. Set the pan over fire and listen carefully for the sound of dripping inside. Then immediately quench the pan in water. Repeat this process ten or more times until the mercury is subdued, resembling black lead sand. Transfer it to a crucible and melt it into refined purple-gold. The transformations possible with this method are too numerous to record in full.
