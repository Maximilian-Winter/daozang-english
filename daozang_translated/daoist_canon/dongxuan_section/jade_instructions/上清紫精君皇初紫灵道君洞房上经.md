**The Method of the Five Spirit-Qi of the Supreme Simplicity for Summoning the Imperial Lords**

Recline beneath the radiant celestial stems, repose within the ninefold essences, restrain the hun and po in the northern ascent, refine the five spirits within the true qi, roam the eightfold simplicities, and inscribe names upon the Dark Chart. The Supreme Great Lord chants:

Ascend the Purple Gate, gaze upon the Eight Mornings,
Expand the Vermilion Palace, array the luminous spirits,
Roam the nine qi, dance with the celestial immortals,
Turban the azure heavens, intone the Great Calendar,
Gird the Vast Fall, recite the Numinous Strategy,
Summon the storm-dragons, tread the twin whites,
Magnify the Purple Youths, revolve the two reds,
Conceal the Supreme Simplicity, hide the radiant jade.

This is the scriptural method of the Purple Essence for summoning the five spirits.

The *Great Calendar* refers to the records of the Seven Sages.
The *Numinous Strategy* refers to the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor*.

At the hour when the parrot cries, visualize the green qi of the east emerging from the sun and filling the head’s Mud-Pill Palace. Within the Mud-Pill Palace are two green mists, which then issue from the eyes, billowing thickly, and transform into two youths. They are clad in green above and below, resembling infants taking their first steps. The youth of the left eye is named Flying Numinous; the youth of the right eye is named Morning Infant. Both stand at my left and right, perfectly distinct. After a long while, knock the teeth nine times, swallow the saliva nine times, and softly invoke:

*"Five numina of the east, solar qi gleaming green,
At dawn enter the Mud-Pill, refining the brain’s precious form.
Left transforms, right transmutes, attaining the name of the Dao,
Enabling me to ascend and audience the Supreme Simplicity of Purple Clarity."*

When finished, concentrate intensely on the names of the two youths, and the hundred harms will not assail you. If one cultivates this persistently for eighteen years, one will ascend to heaven.

Visualize the two youths emerging from the eyes, causing the green qi to suddenly transform and take form. Station them at the left and right, so that the two youths each exhale green qi, which bathes and encircles my entire body, penetrating both within and without.

At noon, face the sun with eyes closed and fists clenched. Visualize two red qi from the sun entering the clenched hands. After a long while, they suddenly transform into two red youths, one in each hand, both clad in red, resembling infants taking their first steps. They stand at my left and right, attending to my rising and resting. The youth in the left hand is the Controller of Destiny within the sun, named Life-Receiver. The youth in the right hand is the Peach Lord within the sun, named Square Fullness. Both exhale red qi, which enters my mouth, surging upward to the Mud-Pill Palace and downward throughout the body, penetrating within and without like firelight. After visualizing for a long while, softly invoke:

*"True perfection of the Great Yang, red numina wafting mist,
Jade numina transform and arise, intimate with me.
Life-Receiver and Square Fullness, upper spirits of the sun,
Order the hun and guard the form, prolonging life by billions and thousands.
The entire body merges with the radiance, ascending as a lofty immortal."*

When finished, if one persistently practices this and visualizes the names of the spirits, one may sit in death or stand in disappearance.

At the hour of *bu*, sit upright and, with eyes closed, visualize two streams of white qi emerging from the moon and entering directly into the soles of your feet, penetrating to their centers. After a long while, from each sole two white dragons take form, one on my left and one on my right. The left dragon is named Whirlwind Essence, the right dragon Swift Pavilion. Both dragons exhale white mist, which enters my two nostrils and proceeds directly to the lungs.

Visualize within the lungs a youth clad in white above and below, who emerges from the right nostril and stands at my right. He is named Luminous Purity Youth, his appearance like that of an infant taking its first steps. After a long while, refine the visualization until it is distinct and vivid. Then knock the teeth seven times, swallow saliva seven times, and softly invoke:

*"Jade Sovereign’s whirlwind and swiftness,
Two dragons descend at dawn,
Entering my two feet, transforming my entire body.
Luminous Purity Youth, circling left and right,
Harmonizes and gathers the six qi, nurturing the five spirits.
Bearing me upward, we ascend to the Treasure Immortals of Great Simplicity."*

Persist in this practice, and one will attain swiftness without haste.

The five spirit names are: the youth in the left eye, Flying Numen; the youth in the right eye, Morning Infant; the youth in the left hand, Life-Receiver; the youth in the right hand, Square Fullness; and the youth of the lung, Luminous Purity. Constantly command the two dragons, Whirlwind Essence and Swift Pavilion, to exhale qi and bathe me in it.

Practice this without negligence for eighteen years, and the Lords of Great Simplicity will dispatch Jade Guardian Duke to descend and welcome you. You will ride the radiance, driving the dawn chariot, and ascend directly to the Purple Clarity.

When visualizing Luminous Purity standing at my right, see him exhale white mist that billows over my face. Focus the mind intently, without distraction. All visualizations should be done with eyes closed; open them only when finished. Constantly maintain the five spirits and two dragons at my left and right, bathing me in qi without cease.

On the eight seasonal nodes, avoid mingling with others. Do not lend clothing or headscarves, nor overuse carriages and horses. This is to preserve undivided stillness, to concentrate the mind in seeking the subtle. Thus may one fan the purple chariot through empty space and ride the whirlwind and swiftness upward.

The immortal path is a study of the heart; with sincerity, one becomes an immortal. The Dao is sought within; with inner secrecy, the Dao comes. The true is cultivated in stillness; with profound quiet, one merges with the true. The divine requires resonance; with accumulated resonance, spiritual communion is achieved. Constantly abide by this, and the day of ascension draws near.

If the heart is competitive and the spirit restless, if the body is harmonious but the mind not focused, if movement and stillness dissipate essence, if the ears and eyes are overly stimulated—then even with long accumulation, the Dao remains distant.

*The Scripture of the Twenty-Four Spirits Returning to the Origin, by the Lord Emperor of Grand Tenuity, states:*
The Lord Emperor of Grand Tenuity, the Great One who fashions form,
The inner spirits of Purple Origin, the twenty-four perfected,
Blended qi transforms and generates, the jade immortals’ supreme essence.
They dissolve the knots of the womb, release stagnation, and open the origin.

The twenty-four knots must be untied by the command of the twenty-four spirits. If one cultivates and visualizes their names, they will govern and stabilize the entire body, preserving original essence.

To untie the knots, first recite the incantation, then the gates may open. These numina are the mysterious origin of knotted qi, the true spirits that complete the body. They guide clouds and mist, bear the true smoke of life, and each can summon jade-script dragon-riders in ranks of thousands. They must unite as one body to ascend at dawn.

These are the twenty-four spirits of the Most High Perfected, who guard the mysterious and preserve the origin—the Dao of the Lord Emperor of Highest Clarity, riding the whirlwind and swiftness.

One should always calm the body and still the heart, rectify the qi and pacify the form. Close the eyes and inwardly gaze, forget the body and contemplate the spirits. Burn incense, purify, refine, visualize the spirits, and guard the true. With threefold indistinct entry, the radiance of the mysterious gathers like mist.

After practicing for eighteen years, the Most High will command the Lord Emperor of Grand Tenuity and the Five Spirits of the Great One to transform and generate the Lord of Blended Numen and Dao. He will issue a summons to the twenty-four perfected, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, galloping on wind and treading clouds, breathing and ascending in flow, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

In the practice of spirit visualization, do not associate with the unworthy. Retreat to secluded chambers, avoid worldly affairs, perch essence on emptiness. With the heart stored and the eyes visualized, guard the subtle and preserve the tranquil. Still the *hun* and pacify the form, then the ten thousand harms will not wound, the hundred ghosts will flee, the thousand demons will not act, disasters will dissolve, and misfortunes scatter—blessings beyond measure.

First knock the teeth twenty-four times, then visualize:
The spirit of the brain is named Awareness Without Child, styled Dao Capital, one *cun* and one *fen* in height, pure white in color.
The spirit of the hair is named Mysterious Patterned Flower, styled Dao Balance, two *cun* and one *fen* in height, dark in color.
The spirit of the skin is named Penetrating Multitude Second, styled Dao Link, one *cun* and five *fen* in height, yellow in color.
The spirit of the eyes is named Numinous Overseer of Life, styled Dao Youth, three *cun* in height, clad in five colors.
The spirit of the nape marrow is named Numinous Plan Cover, styled Dao Circumference, five *cun* in height, white in color.
The spirit of the spine is named Beneficial Calendar Assistant, styled Dao Pillar, three *cun* and a half in height, clad in white jade and plain robes.
The spirit of the nose is named Second Dragon Jade, styled Dao Subtle, two *cun* and five *fen* in height, clad in blue, white, and yellow.
The spirit of the tongue is named Beginning Beam Peak, styled Dao Fork, seven *cun* in height, pure red.

These are the names of the eight numinous youths of the upper body’s eight luminaries. First visualize them all in the form of infants, indistinct yet present in the body, each settled in its place. Then knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly invoke:

*"Eight spirits of the upper luminaries,
Lord Emperor and Mysterious Mother,
Five spirits each arrayed, merging as one within the body.
The entire form vanishes and transforms, flowing and changing to merge with the true.
A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders together ascend to the imperial dawn.
White Origin and Non-Exalted nurture the Supreme Guest,
Eight numina flank the body, jade radiance bearing mist.
In a thousand cycles of indistinctness, we proceed directly to the Gate of the Sun."*

At the beginning of visualization, first call the names of the spirits three times. When the invocation is finished, call their names three more times, so that as the sound leaves the mouth, the three sections respond in unison.

At dawn, noon, and midnight, constantly visualize the twenty-four spirits in sequence, reciting and calling their names as described above.

*The Scripture of Precious Numinous Regulations* states: The method of knocking the teeth—knocking the left against the left—is called "knocking the Heavenly Bell."

Knocking the right against the right is called "striking the Heavenly Chime."
Knocking the upper and lower teeth together at the center is called "sounding the Heavenly Drum."
If suddenly encountering inauspicious omens or malevolence, knock the Heavenly Bell thirty times.
When traversing mountains, to repel evil and invoke the might of the spirits, strike the Heavenly Chime.
When visualizing the Dao to summon the true and invoke the numinous, sound the Heavenly Drum.
Though the act of knocking the teeth is one, in truth it distinguishes left and right, upper and lower.
Thus, malevolence fears the resonance of the Heavenly Bell, mountain spirits dread the clarity of the Heavenly Chime, and the summoning of spirits is solemnized by the thunder of the Heavenly Drum.
The notes of gong and shang must be measured; subtle inner resonance cannot be sought through uniformity nor achieved by mere coincidence.
In all matters great and small, this principle holds—thus the method of knocking the teeth unfolds, and the sounds of bell and drum are distinguished.
Therefore, the numerology of the Dao must not be transgressed or confused; its techniques and methods must not be disordered.
Transgression and confusion lead to obscurity and failure; disorder invites slander and calamity.
This is not due to the impenetrable void of the unseen, but to the lack of order in its practice.
The failure of the Dao and the inefficacy of affairs stem from seeking the true path without following the proper tracks.

Knocking the Heavenly Bell twenty times suffices when no other incantation is required, serving only to dispel inauspiciousness.
If following a specific method, adhere to the prescribed number of knocks in the text, without necessarily performing thirty.

The spirit of the throat is named Hundred Streams Radiant, styled Dao-Tong, eight inches in height, clad in nine colors.
The spirit of the lungs is named Pure Numen Born, styled Dao-Ping, eight inches and one fen in height, pure white.
The spirit of the heart is named Radiant Yang Prospering, styled Dao-Ming, nine inches in height, crimson.
The spirit of the liver is named Opening Lord Youth, styled Dao-Qing, six inches in height, azure.
The spirit of the gallbladder is named Dragon Virtue Bound, styled Dao-Fang, three inches and six fen in height, azure-yellow-green.
The spirit of the left kidney is named Spring Origin Upright, styled Dao-Qing, three inches and seven fen in height, dark, its color shifting among white, red, and the five hues without constancy.
The spirit of the right kidney is named Image Other None, styled Dao-Yu, three inches and five fen in height, white or black.
The spirit of the spleen is named Treasure Origin Complete, styled Dao-Qian, seven inches and three fen in height, true yellow.

Visualize in sequence the names of these eight numinous youths of the central body, each in the form of an infant, faintly present within, settled in their respective places.
Upon completion, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly intone:
*"The eight spirits of the central realm,
Four transformations, nine flights,
Refine the soul, rectify the body,
Bright radiance shares its splendor.
United with the eight spirits,
We join in shared majesty,
A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders,
Ascend together to the Supreme Microcosm."*

The spirit of the stomach is named Together Come Nurturing, styled Dao-Zhan, seven inches in height, yellow.
The spirit within the hollow intestines is named Omen Knee Health, styled Dao-Huan, one inch and four fen in height, yellow-red.
The spirit within the large and small intestines is named Vast Delivery Remaining, styled Dao-Chu, two inches and one fen in height, red-yellow.
The spirit within the torso is named Receiving Abundance Thriving, styled Dao-Xu, nine inches and one fen in height, clad in nine colors.
The spirit of the chest diaphragm is named Vast Crystal Dwelling, styled Dao-Chong, five inches in height, white.
The spirits of the two flanks are named Repelling Falsehood Steed, styled Dao-Cheng, four inches and one fen in height, red-white.
The spirit of the left yin and left yang is named Supporting Flow Rising, styled Dao-Gui, two inches and two fen in height, azure-yellow-white.
For men, visualize as left yang; for women, as left yin.
The spirit of the right yin and right yang is named Embracing Bright Manifestation, styled Dao-Sheng, two inches and three fen in height, azure-yellow-white.
For men, visualize as right yang; for women, as right yin.

Visualize in sequence the names of these eight numinous youths of the lower body, each in the form of an infant, faintly present within, settled in their respective places.
Upon completion, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly intone:
*"The eight spirits of the lower realm,
Dispersed forms transform into numinous beings,
Purple mist rises thickly,
Embracing the origin, guarding essence.
The Primordial Father of the Great One,
The Lord Emperor engenders life,
The seven luminaries shine in the register,
The Controller of Destiny records birth.
Soul and spirit are at peace,
The five luminaries nurture clarity,
A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders,
Join me in ascent,
First to the Primal Simplicity,
Then to pay homage in the Supreme Clarity."*

The spirit of the innermost root of the body is named Pursuing Nothing Steed, styled Dao-Ji-Sheng, two inches and two fen in height, purple.
For men, visualize as the Inner Spirit of the One Dao; for women, as the Central Numen of the True Origin.
This is the profound spirit of the body’s deepest root, the supreme numen guarding the center.
Next, visualize it in the form of an infant, seated in its proper place.

Having completed this, knock the teeth thirty times and swallow saliva twenty-four cycles, then softly intone the incantation:

"Dark Prime’s inner truth,
Nurtures form and attends the dawn,
Mastering the pivot and grasping the web,
Nine revolutions and eight spirals,
The Dipper’s stars within the profound,
Palaces arrayed in ninefold ranks,
The Lord Emperor joins in flourishing,
Nine Ways and seven swallows,
Expelling fluid and receiving essence,
Harmonizing to bathe the host of spirits,
The five viscera bloom with radiance,
Reverting age to youthful countenance,
A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders,
Ascend with me to heaven,
To pay homage at the Grand Stair,
And bow deeply to the Jade Dawn."

This is the precious name of the body’s inner character, the spirit of transformation and life. Without knowing this name, the Dao of immortality cannot be achieved. If, on the day of untying the knots, one does not first recite this incantation, the knots will not be undone. Should the knots remain unresolved, the three hun-souls will lose their harmony, the Upper Prime’s inner essence will be lost, the Five Elders will lose their clarity, and the Lord Emperor will become estranged.

For men, visualize this as the spirit of the Divine Child; for women, as the spirit of the Divine Maiden—both share the same name. Visualize the twenty-four spirits, always at midnight, lying flat without a pillow, fists clenched and body relaxed, breath regulated and subtle. Focus the mind on the body’s spirits, and with tranquil thought, summon the Lord Emperor to appear in his proper place. Close the eyes and inwardly behold him. If any are incomplete, then burn incense, sit upright, close the eyes, clench the fists upon the knees, and with concentrated intent, visualize the host of spirits while reciting the incantation as prescribed.

At dawn and noon, perform the visualization while sitting upright, ensuring no one witnesses it. Always inwardly behold with eyes closed.

On the first day of the month at midnight, after visualizing the spirits, next visualize within the eyes a white qi the size of a chicken’s egg, suspended before the face. In an instant, it transforms into two luminous mirrors, each nine feet in diameter, which shine before and behind, illuminating the twenty-four spirits upon the body with perfect clarity. After a long while, intone the incantation:

"Great Luminous Treasure Mirrors,
Dispersing forms and transforming manifestations,
Illuminating the primordial spirit,
Subduing the myriad demons,
Soaring to the Supreme Clarity,
Parting the cloud-veiled canopy,
Commanding a thousand spirits,
Sealing mountains and summoning rivers."

Conclude. Perform this once every five days—this is what is meant by "reviewing the inner essence and inspecting the five spirits." By practicing this regularly, calamities will not arise, and one will ascend to the rank of High Immortal.

The method for the Divine Child’s revelation, enabling clear vision of the Lord Emperor, the five spirits, and the twenty-four spirits, is as follows: During the *jiazi*旬, on the day of *gengwu*, at noon, take a *dou* of pure water and dissolve one *zhu* of true cinnabar into it. Stir counterclockwise twenty-one times and recite the incantation:

"Crimson essence of the Dark Flow,
Generating light and entering clarity,
The host of body spirits all appear,
Manifesting their forms,
Penetrating vision for ten thousand *li*,
Communing with the Nine Numinous Ones,
The Lord Emperor illumines the Child,
Refining my supreme essence."

Conclude the incantation, then face east and wash the eyes fourteen times. Those who practice this regularly will attain penetrating vision of the myriad spirits. The incantation should be recited softly, washing the eyes with the water while facing the moon’s position, always toward the east.

The Most High Perfected Person summons the Five Celestial Bodies in the Grotto Chamber and registers the flying immortals within the Six Directions. The Hidden Stored Secret Dao of the Southern Culmen’s Primordial Lord transmits the Jade Scripture’s precious instructions.

At midnight, in perfect stillness, sit or lie as you wish. Calm the body, quiet the mind, relax the breath, and regulate the spirit. Close the eyes and inwardly visualize the Western White Star above the brows, called the Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace. One *cun* above the brows and one *cun* inward lies the Jade Pendants of the Purple Palace. On yang days, visualize the star above the left brow; on yin days, above the right brow.

Next, visualize the Northern Chen Star in the Celestial Center’s Imperial Realm of the Dark Palace. The Imperial Realm of the Dark Palace lies directly above the nose, five *fen* from the hairline, one *cun* inward.

Next, visualize the Eastern Wood Star in the Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass. The Vermilion Terrace of the Grotto Pass lies one *cun* behind the eyes, one *cun* inward. On yang days, visualize the star behind the left eye; on yin days, behind the right eye.

Next, visualize the Southern Fire Star in the Jade Gate of the Flowery Chamber. The Jade Gate of the Flowery Chamber lies five *fen* within the inner corners of the eyes. On yang days, visualize it within the left eye’s corner; on yin days, within the right.

Next, visualize the Central Earth Star in the Golden Coffer of the Yellow Chamber and the Long Valley. The Golden Coffer of the Yellow Chamber and the Long Valley lies at the center of the philtrum, two *fen* inward, with the star suspended as if strung above.

Having completed the visualization, ensure the stars occupy their proper positions. One should feel the five stars emitting radiant beams, releasing five-colored mists that penetrate the body, illuminating both within and without, as if the body is suffused with the stars’ essence.

Then knock the teeth twenty-five times and swallow saliva twenty-five cycles. Softly intone the incantation:

"Lofty Purple Palace,
Within appears the Lord Emperor,
The Great One blends in unity,
The gate of the Purple Chamber,
Within it shines resplendent,
This is the Three Primes,
The Three Primes congeal essence,
Within dwell the five spirits,
Precious luminaries spread their radiance,
Beams of light surge through the gate,
Essence transforms and accumulates,
Changing into an elder,
Head wrapped in white, serene countenance,
Green mantle and crimson skirt,
Right side bears flowing bells,
Left side adorned with tiger patterns,
Holding the Heavenly Net in hand,
Dispersing blades and flying stars,
Feet treading the Flowery Canopy,
Spouting rays to refine the body,
The Three Luminaries guard and protect,
Granting me attainment of the true,
Nurturing the hun and restraining the po,
Riding the whirlwind to fly as an immortal."

Conclude, then swallow saliva three more times and knock the teeth three times.

Those who practice this for fifteen years will be met thus: The Southern Culmen’s Elder of the Cinnabar Mound and Supreme Perfected One will welcome them with a chariot of green clouds; the Western Culmen’s Elder, the White Numinous Master, will welcome them with a carriage of yellow whirlwinds; the Northern Culmen’s Elder, the Dark Supreme Immortal Sovereign, will welcome them with a dragon of dark radiance; the Eastern Culmen’s Elder, the Yang-Assisting Noble Son, will welcome them with a palanquin of azure curtains; the Central Prime’s Elder, the Supreme Dark Child of the Center, will welcome them with a canopy of curved dawn. The Five Elders will unite, ascending together to the Purple Void.

Practice this without fail, and visualize with utmost precision.

Avoid treading upon filth, shun defiling company, regularly burn incense, and bathe frequently. Those who violate these precepts will wither and decay; those who observe them will ascend as flying immortals.

Once the visualization of the stars is complete and you harbor a wish, focus your intent upon the invocation and then articulate it. Envision the Five Stars dwelling together, entering directly three *cun* below the nape, then spreading one *cun* in each direction—each star bright as a pellet, illuminating the entire body with radiance.

On the first, fifteenth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, seventeenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, at cockcrow, visualize the images of the sun and moon within the *Hun* Chamber, the Mansion of the Six Harmonies. This mansion lies at the upper outer corners of the eyes, slightly raised toward the empty space above. Press there, knock the teeth, and listen below for the convergence of the Four Meetings—where movement stirs beneath is the place. Enter directly one *cun*, spanning nine *fen* in width, called the *Hun* Chamber, the Mansion of the Six Harmonies. The sun to the left, the moon to the right, visualize their light illuminating the form, making it faintly perceptible in its place. Close the eyes and concentrate intensely, allowing no lapse in focus. Upon completion, knock the teeth six times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly invoke:

*"Great luminous dawn, ninefold verdant ascent,
Summoning rosy clouds, concealing radiance,
Bathing and refining the five forms,
Palace-chariot of the Six Harmonies,
Seven spirits in harmonious balance,
Grant me flight as an immortal,
Ascending to traverse the Upper Clarity."*

After fifteen years of practice, the Jade Emperor will dispatch the Three Pure Jade Lads to welcome you.

One must train a rooster to crow, ensuring it marks the dawn with regularity. If the method is concealed and practiced in secret, the mutual radiance of sun and moon will be lost.

The Southern Culmen’s Lady received this protective method from the Most High Perfected Ones, naming it the *Double Radiance Winged Form Concealment Dao*.

**The Seven Primes and Nine Stars Scripture of the Celestial Grotto Chamber’s Eightfold Liberation Gate and Jade Characters**

**Dipper Star, First Great Star:** Essence named *Mysterious Pivot*, spirit called *Yang Brightness*.
**Second Prime Star:** Essence named *Northern Terrace*, spirit called *Yin Essence*.
**Third True Star:** Essence named *Nine Ultimates*, spirit called *Perfected Person*.
**Fourth Pivot Star:** Essence named *Rotating Root*, spirit called *Mysterious Darkness*.
**Fifth Net Star:** Essence named *Celestial Balance*, spirit called *Cinnabar Prime*.
**Sixth Record Star:** Essence named *Life Mechanism*, spirit called *Northern Culmen*.
**Seventh Barrier Star:** Essence named *Mysterious Yang*, spirit called *Celestial Barrier*.
**Eighth Emperor Star:** Essence titled *Supreme Jade Emperor Lord*, spirit called *Eightfold Radiance Numinous Prime Lord*.
**Ninth Venerable Star:** Essence titled *Grand Tenuity Jade Emperor Lord*, spirit called *Grand Simplicity Sevenfold Dawn Prime Lord*.

These are the names and titles of the Dipper Lords, known as the Nine Stars. The Dipper possesses stars of *hun* and *po*, revolving around its exterior and entwining it—the Dipper lies within the *hun* and *po*. Its net extends outward, unlike the Dipper’s form, for the *hun* and *po* roam and transform, unbound by shape.

To pace the *hun* of the Dipper, store the heart’s intent and call the names of the Seven *Hun*, saying *Flying Immortal* as you tread upon each black star, invoking one *hun* name per step. Without knowing these names, the method will not take effect, and the Dao will not be achieved.

The star between *Yang Brightness* and *Yin Essence* is the chief of the Dipper’s *hun* and *po*, named the *Celestial Pivot Hun Spirit*. Next, proceed to the upper corner of the second star, named the *Celestial Rotation Hun Spirit*. Then, moving toward *Yang Brightness*, follow the third star, named the *Celestial Mechanism Po Essence*. Opposite the *Perfected Person*, the fourth star is named the *Celestial Balance Po Essence*. Opposite *Cinnabar Prime*, the fifth star is named the *Jade Balance Po Numinous*. Opposite *Celestial Barrier*, the sixth star is named the *Kai Yang Po Numinous*. Finally, ascending to face *Northern Culmen*, the seventh star is named *Shaking Radiance Great Brightness*.

These are the names and titles of the seven stars’ *hun* and *po*, called the *Seven Primes’ Numinous Brightness*. The *hun* of the seven stars reside upon the black stars—store these names in the heart and say *Flying Immortal*.

**The Most High’s Revolving Prime Concealment Dao for Removing Sin Records, Inner Chapter**

The *Jade Perfected Concealed Prime Inner Vision* employs the days of the Six *Ding* as the time of generative *qi*, when the Celestial Prime unfolds, the embryonic matrix is doubly fortified, the Seven *Po* speak above, the Three *Hun* record transgressions, ancestral errors of seven generations accumulate, and punishments amass in the Three Yin. Thus, there exists a method of dissolution to absolve transgressions and sins.

Those who practice this method are called seekers of immortality. Regularly, on the *Ding-Mao* day within the *Jia-Zi* decade, at midnight, sit upright upon the bed, face north, clasp the hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly invoke:

*"First Great Star, Mysterious Pivot, Yang Brightness, Celestial Pivot Hun Spirit, Supreme Prime Lord."*

Call seven times, then invoke again:

*"May I be absolved of all yang sins and yang transgressions from my seven generations down to my present self, dissolving them entirely. May all I undertake be as I wish, all matters align with my heart. May I pace the Seven Primes, harmonize with heaven, my name inscribed upon the Dipper’s dawn, my lifespan extended by billions and thousands."*

Upon completion, visualize the *Yang Brightness* star descending from the Dipper, flying into your mouth, and entering your heart. Envision the star’s light, making the interior and exterior thoroughly luminous, and concentrate intensely. This is called *Dissolving the Dawn Net’s Inner Reflection of the Upper Dao*.

At this moment, visualize the Seven Stars, one missing and six remaining, thus suspended in the sky. Visualize the missing one descending and suddenly entering your mouth—hence, the other six remain in the heavens. All matters follow this method.

On the *Ding-Chou* day within the *Jia-Xu* decade, at midnight, sit upright upon the bed, face north, clasp the hands, knock the teeth seven times, then gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly invoke:

*"Second Prime Star, Northern Terrace, Yin Essence, Celestial Rotation Hun Spirit, Supreme Jade Lord."*

Call seven times, then invoke again:

*"May I be absolved of all yin sins and yin transgressions from my seven generations down to my present self, dissolving them entirely. May the Six *Qi* be full, the Four Spirits at ease. May I fly through the Seven Primes, my name inscribed in the Jade Book, ascend to the Purple Clarity, ride the dark chariot of the void, move with auspicious correctness, and harmonize with heaven."*

When finished, visualize the Yin Essence Star descending from the Dipper, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into your lungs, allowing it to illuminate and clearly discern both within and without, making the Five Viscera distinct. As the star enters your mouth, you should feel its radiance scattering and filling your mouth; if your mouth grows slightly warm, this is the sign that the star’s essence has entered. In all contemplations of the Seven Primes and the Way of the Nine Mornings, the bed and mat where you sleep must not be shared with others, nor should your clothing. If a man and woman share a mat to rest, their names are recorded in the ledgers of sin under the Northern Mystery. Those who defile themselves with impurity bring calamity upon their three generations of ancestors. This does not apply to masters and those of the same *qi*.

On the *Ding-Hai* day within the *Jia-Shen* decade, at midnight, sit upright upon the bed, face north, clasp the hands, knock the teeth seven times, then gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly invoke:

*"Third True Star, Nine Ultimates, Supreme Perfected, Primordial True Person, Celestial Mechanism, Po-Spirit, Essence of the Upper Void, Lord of Pure Simplicity."*

Call seven times, then invoke again:

*"May I be absolved of all death sins and death transgressions from my seven generations down to my present self—accumulated evils, hidden faults, and offenses against the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water—dissolving them entirely. May my eyes see clearly, piercing the darkest depths, my name inscribed in the Upper Clarity, commanding the myriad spirits, ascending to the Jade Court, riding the luminous chariot of the void, and harmonizing with heaven."*

When finished, visualize the True Person Star descending from the Dipper, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into your liver, its light illuminating the Five Viscera and making all within and without distinctly visible. Then, face north and bow twice; when finished, swallow saliva nine times. You may also bow in your heart to the True Star.

On the *Ding-You* day within the *Jia-Wu* decade, at midnight, sit upright upon the bed in your sleeping chamber, face north, clasp the hands, knock the teeth seven times, then gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly invoke:

*"Fourth Pivot Star, Mystic Mechanism, Dark Depths, Celestial Balance, Po-Spirit, Essence of the Upper Void, Lord of Profound Mystery."*

Call seven times, then invoke again:

*"May I be absolved of all ungrateful and unvirtuous deeds, all acts of unkindness and unfiliality, and all yin evils—numbering in the tens of millions—from my seven generations down to my present self, dissolving them entirely. May I ingest essence and refine *qi*, daily increasing in power, ascending through the Seven Primes, my name inscribed in the Great Mystery, listed among the Jade Emperor’s court, riding the swift chariot of the Nine Heavens, commanding spirits and guiding numina, renewing with the sun and moon."*

When finished, visualize the Dark Depths Star descending from the Dipper, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into your spleen, its light illuminating and piercing through, casting radiance upon the Five Viscera. Then, swallow saliva fourteen times.

On the *Ding-Wei* day within the *Jia-Chen* decade, at midnight, sit upright upon the bed in your sleeping chamber, face north, clasp the hands, knock the teeth seven times, then gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly invoke:

*"Fifth Principal Star, Celestial Balance, Cinnabar Prime, Jade Mechanism, Po-Spirit, Numinous Essence, Supreme Lord, Nine August Sovereigns of the Upper Mystery."*

Call seven times, then invoke again:

*"May I be absolved of all inner and outer defilements—sins and deep transgressions numbering in the tens of millions of billions, recorded in the hidden passes—from my seven generations down to my present self, dissolving them entirely. May my body be filled and my *qi* abundant, the Yellow Court stabilized within, my name listed in the Great Simplicity, riding the luminous chariot to the Purple Palace, attended on the right by Jade Maidens and on the left by Jade Lads, sharing radiance with the sun and moon, and assuming the rank of True King."*

When finished, visualize the Cinnabar Prime Star descending from the Dipper, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into your stomach, its light illuminating and clearly distinguishing the Five Viscera. Then, swallow saliva eighteen times.

On the *Ding-Si* day within the *Jia-Yin* decade, at midnight, sit upright upon the bed in your sleeping chamber, face north, clasp the hands, knock the teeth seven times, then gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly invoke:

*"Sixth Record Star, Life Mechanism, Northern Culmen, Opening Yang, Po-Spirit, Numinous Essence, Supreme Perfected, Cinnabar August Sovereign of the Void."*

Call seven times, then invoke again:

*"May I be absolved of all thieving evils, rebellious acts, and chaotic transgressions—offenses recorded in the imperial archives—from my seven generations down to my present self, dissolving them entirely. May the hundred ailments be cured, my body’s *qi* flow with auspicious correctness, my name inscribed on the Immortal Terrace, engraved in gold in the Upper Clarity, commanding the myriad spirits, and soaring through the Nine Luminaries."*

When finished, visualize the Northern Culmen Star descending from the Dipper and entering directly into your mouth, settling in your kidneys, its light illuminating and clearly distinguishing the Five Viscera. Then, swallow saliva fourteen times. On yang days, visualize it in the left kidney; on yin days, in the right kidney. The first day is yang, the second yin. This practice strictly forbids sexual intercourse. Those who engage in it will be examined by the Most High and their three generations of ancestors and parents; their own death will reduce them to lowly ghosts.

On the evening of the last day of the lunar month, before the next month’s first day and before the cock crows, sit upright upon the bed in your sleeping chamber, face east, clasp the hands, knock the teeth seven times, then gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars of the north, making them shine brilliantly to your left. After a long while, softly invoke:

*"Seventh Barrier Star, Mystic Yang, Celestial Barrier, Shaking Radiance, Great Brilliance, Supreme Jade August Sovereign, Dao Lord."*

Call seven times, then invoke again:

*"May I be absolved of all hidden and obscured sins—offenses subject to the Five Punishments, numbering in the tens of millions of billions among the spirits within my body, recorded in the Ghostly Archives of the Northern Emperor—from my seven generations down to my present self, dissolving them entirely. May my spirit and essence flow freely, granting the power to sit in stillness or vanish at will, my ears hearing the most distant sounds, my eyes emitting purple light, my name inscribed in the Jade Great Simplicity, my vision piercing all ghostly forms, my name recorded in the Imperial Carriage, my fate equal to the Two Luminaries, soaring through the Seven Primes, and resting in the Purple Court."*

When finished, visualize the Celestial Barrier Star descending from the Dipper, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into your pupils, illuminating both eyes and allowing you to see clearly within and without, distinctly perceiving the Five Viscera.

On yang days, visualize the star entering the left eye; on yin days, visualize it entering the right pupil. In all practices and meditations, keep both eyes gently closed.

On the days of the Six Jia, at the hour when generative qi arises at midnight, in your bedchamber—whether lying or sitting, with your head facing any direction—clench your fists, settle your breath, and stabilize your spirit. After a long while, knock your teeth nine times, then visualize the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper shining brilliantly above your crown. Let the radiance of the Nine Stars extend their rays, with two stars positioned before the Dipper’s handle, their light intermingling. Then softly intone:

*"Eighth Imperial Star, Exalted Jade Sovereign, Spirit of the Eightfold Radiance Primordial Lord; Ninth Revered Star, Supreme Jade Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, Spirit of the Sevenfold Dawn Primordial Lord."*

Call upon them nine times, then pray:

*"May all transgressions of my nine generations of ancestors and parents, down to my own self—every great and small sin committed in mountains, rivers, and water sources—be dissolved. May all names inscribed in the ledgers of the dead, all hidden evils, concealed treacheries, and deceptions—numbering in the tens of millions and recorded in the Ghostly Archives of Mount Feng—along with all capital offenses and errors listed in the Black Register of the Ninefold Primordial Perfected of the Northern Supreme, be petitioned before the Ninefold Primordial Supreme Jade Mystery Lord. May every matter be erased, allowing me to soar through the Seven Paths, ascend to the Jade Purity, roam the Great Void, ride the luminous dawn, feast in the Eightfold Simplicity of the North, rival the sun in splendor, and collectively attend the Perfected Consorts, commanding the myriad spirits."*

When finished, visualize the Eighth Imperial Star and the Ninth Revered Star descending from the Dipper, flying directly into the Purple Chamber of your Mud-Pellet Palace, illuminating it thoroughly and brightening your entire body’s Five Viscera, so that inner and outer are suffused with purple cloud-qi, dense and luxuriant. Hold this vision firmly.

Conclude by swallowing saliva twenty-seven times.

If the days of the Six Jia and Six Ding interfere with one another in visualization, repeat the practice in sequence, ensuring each step adheres fully to the true method.

Here ends the *Dao of the Supreme’s Return to the Origin and Atonement for Transgressions*.

The Supreme concealed the *Dao of the Fivefold Penetration* within the Jade Casket of the Five Peaks and hid the *Dao of Returning to the Origin* in the Palace of the Nine Dawns. The Fivefold Penetration opens the beginning, while Returning to the Origin seals the end. Thus, those who cultivate the Fivefold Penetration must first observe a three-day fast before proceeding on the appointed day. Those who practice the *Sevenfold Primordial Return Dao* must abstain from blood and meat, though no fast is required on the preceding or following days. The reason for this is that the Fivefold Penetration has already been purified beforehand. The Fivefold Penetration occurs on the Supreme’s auspicious assembly day, while Returning to the Origin marks the Supreme’s day of renewal. Without knowledge of the Fivefold Penetration, one cannot dissolve sins or erase transgressions; without knowledge of the *Hidden Dao of Returning to the Origin*, one cannot inscribe their name in the registers of the Perfected. Always on these days, reflect upon auspicious matters and first atone for the transgressions within your body—this is what is meant by *liberation from form and name*. Do not reveal these practices to the immortals of the Nine Palaces.

For all who cultivate affairs of the Purple Chamber within the Grotto Chamber, or visualize the Ninefold Primordial or Sevenfold Primordial, upon first rising from sleep, when first lying down, or after eating, softly intone:

*"Five Stars, Fivefold Penetration,
Sixfold Union, Purple Chamber,
Return to the Origin, Hidden Dao,
Vast and Luminous Seven Dawns.
The Mysterious Father generates the hun-soul,
The Father transforms it into the One, becoming spirit;
The Mysterious Mother generates the po-soul,
The Mother transforms it into the Two, becoming form.
The Duke’s Son governs my sinews and bones,
The White Prime governs my essence and qi.
May I attain long life and enduring vision,
Soaring as an immortal through the Ten Heavens."*

Do not let your ears hear the sound of this prayer. This is the Supreme’s *Hidden Prayer* for dispelling malevolent qi, gathering spirit-essence, and ensuring one never falls into obscurity throughout their life.

Here ends the *Upper Clarity Scripture of the Purple Essence Sovereign, the August Primordial Purple Numinous Dao Lord of the Grotto Chamber*.
