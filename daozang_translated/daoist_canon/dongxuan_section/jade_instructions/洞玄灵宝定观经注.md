**Commentary on the *Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture of Stabilized Contemplation***
**By Lengxuzi**

"Spiritual" (*ling*) denotes the numinous—what is called "spirit" in heaven.
"Treasure" (*bao*) denotes the precious—what is called "treasure" on earth.
Heaven possesses spiritual transformations, its divine functions unfathomable, thus its vast covering knows no bounds.
Earth possesses manifold treasures, sustaining and nourishing all beings, thus its profound bearing upholds the ten thousand things.
This scripture is like heaven and earth: it covers and upholds, possesses the spiritual and the precious, its merit and power boundless. One who realizes this mind names it *Lingbao* ("Numinous Treasure").

"Stabilization" (*ding*) is the stabilization of the mind, like the earth’s immovability.
"Contemplation" (*guan*) is the illumination of wisdom, like the sky’s constant radiance.
The essence of stabilization is without thought; the illumination of wisdom is without limit. Stabilization and wisdom cultivated equally are thus called *dingguan* ("Stabilized Contemplation").

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying:
"Left" (*zuo*) signifies stabilization.
"Mystery" (*xuan*) signifies profound subtlety.
"Perfected" (*zhen*) signifies purity—singular and without admixture.
"One" (*ren*) signifies a person who penetrates principle and fathoms nature.
"Said" (*yue*) is a particle of speech.

If one desires to cultivate the Dao,
the mind that advances and strives is called "cultivating the Dao."
First, one must relinquish affairs—
freedom from all defilement is called "relinquishing affairs."
Sever all external affairs:
the six dusts are external affairs, which must be distanced.
The six dusts are form, sound, scent, flavor, touch, and dharmas.
No longer being stained or attached is called "severing all."
Nothing opposes the mind—
when circumstances do not oppose, the mind is without vexation;
when the mind does not arise in defilement, circumstances are without affliction.
When both mind and circumstances are forgotten, there is no vexation,
thus it is called "nothing opposes the mind."
Then sit in stability—
gathering and settling afflictions is called "stability."
The original mind not arising is called "sitting."
Contemplate internally the arising of the mind.
If one perceives a single thought arising, it must be extinguished, striving to achieve tranquility.
The illumination of wisdom inwardly is called "internal contemplation."
Unsevered delusive thoughts are called "the arising of the mind."
When a prior thought suddenly arises, the subsequent awareness follows.
Once the arising mind is extinguished, the illuminating awareness is also forgotten,
thus it is called "extinguishing."
Understanding that the mind does not arise is called "tranquility."
The awakened nature’s immovability is called "stillness,"
thus it is called "tranquility."

Next, even if there is no specific attachment, drifting and chaotic thoughts must also be entirely extinguished.
When the multitude of minds does not arise, false thoughts are wholly forgotten; when chaotic thoughts do not arise, how can there be attachment?
Thus it is called "extinguishing."
Practice diligently day and night, without the slightest interruption.
"Day" signifies purity; "night" signifies defilement.
When both defilement and purity are forgotten, there is no interval or interruption,
thus it is called "without interruption."
Only extinguish the moving mind—
forgetting discriminative thoughts is called "the moving mind."
Awareness and illumination dispel it, thus it is called "extinguishing."
Do not extinguish the illuminating mind—
the illumination of wisdom is constantly bright, without interruption,
thus it is called "not extinguishing the illuminating mind."
Simply congeal the empty mind—
not arising in any mind is called "the empty mind."
Do not congeal or abide in the mind—
non-attachment to anything is called "not congealing or abiding in the mind."
Do not rely on a single dharma while the mind abides constantly.
If one grasps a single dharma, this is called "attachment to form."
When the mind does not grasp dharmas, this is called "not relying."
Illuminating yet constantly quiescent, it is thus called "constant abiding."

However, the ordinary mind is restless and competitive.
Next, for beginners, quieting the mind is exceedingly difficult; even if momentarily stilled, it may be lost again upon pause.
This speaks of habitual afflictions, which are difficult to extinguish. When the power of stabilization is not yet perfected, a momentary pause leads to loss.
Departure and abiding engage in battle; the hundred bodily [functions] flow unceasingly.
When the mind arises in defiled circumstances, circumstances come to drag the mind; when mind and circumstances defile each other, this is called "engaging in battle."
When false thoughts do not cease, the hundred evils arise spontaneously,
thus it is called "the hundred bodily [functions] flowing unceasingly."
With prolonged and concentrated reflection, one will eventually become attuned.
Do not, because momentary gathering is unattainable, abandon the endeavor of a thousand lifetimes.
When the stabilizing mind does not arise, one accords with the true and constant.
A single thought not gathered, and a thousand lifetimes are abandoned.
Having attained a measure of stillness—
having attained purity, right wisdom has not yet arisen,
thus it is called "having attained a measure of stillness."
Then, in the times of walking, standing, sitting, and reclining—
these are the times of the four dignified postures—
in places of engagement with affairs, in clamorous settings,
seeing all various forms is called "places of engagement"; arising in all various minds is called "clamorous settings."
one intentionally stabilizes—
quieting chaos and returning to stillness is called "intentionally."
Being serene and properly situated is called "stabilizing."
Whether in activity or inactivity, one is always as if without mind;
whether in stillness or in clamor, one’s resolve remains singular.
Abandoning both existence and nonexistence, forgetting both stillness and function, the myriad dharmas are non-dual,
thus it is called "singular."
If one binds the mind too tightly, this will become an illness, with qi manifesting as madness and derangement—this is its sign.
Partiality toward stillness is called "binding the mind."
Perceiving forms outside the mind is called "derangement."
If the mind is unmoving, one must also allow it freedom, adjusting tension and relaxation to their proper measure.
Issuing wisdom from stabilization is called "allowing freedom."
Stabilization and wisdom equally blended is called "proper measure."
Naturally and constantly regulate and harmonize—
too much stabilization leads to dullness; too much wisdom leads to madness.
Stabilization and wisdom employed equally is called "regulating and harmonizing."
Restraining without attachment, allowing freedom without movement, abiding in clamor without aversion, engaging in affairs without vexation—this is true stabilization.
Quiescent yet constantly illuminating, illuminating yet constantly quiescent, empty yet constantly functioning, functioning yet constantly empty, attaining the original and fundamental quiescence,
thus it is called "true stabilization."
Do not, because one is without vexation in engaging affairs, seek out many affairs;
do not, because one is without aversion in abiding in clamor, forcefully approach clamor.
Habitual defiled labors must constantly be restrained and governed; one must not indulge in excess.
Taking non-activity as the true dwelling—
seeing the original nature’s emptiness and quiescence,
thus it is called "the true dwelling."

Having affairs manifests as responsive traces. The boundless application of wisdom thus becomes responsive traces. Like water or a mirror serving as a reflection, it reveals forms in accordance with things. The original mind is pure and still, like water or a mirror—its illuminating function unimpeded, all phenomena simultaneously appearing—this is called "revealing forms." Skillful expedient means arise only through attaining stabilization. All dharmas are empty in nature, quiescent without arising—thus it is called "entering stabilization." The speed of wisdom’s arising does not depend on the person. Do not urgently seek wisdom within stabilization, for haste injures the nature, and injury precludes wisdom. Eagerly pursuing knowledge and perception destroys true stabilization. Clinging to all appearances is called "lacking wisdom." If, without seeking wisdom in stabilization, wisdom arises spontaneously, this is called "true wisdom." The mind’s essence is quiescent, its wondrous function inexhaustible—thus it is called "true stabilization." Wisdom unused is true insight resembling foolishness. Comprehending without discrimination is called "unused." Concealing brilliance and obscuring traces is thus called "resembling foolishness." Both stabilization and wisdom are perfected, their beauty boundless. Quiescence and illumination merge equally—thus it is called "boundless beauty."

If within stabilization thoughts arise, they often attract manifold demons—specters and spirits of all kinds appear in response to the mind. This is the mind grasping at appearances. When all appearances arise, every demon and evil spirit competes to disturb and confuse. Even the sight of Heavenly Worthies, immortals, or perfected beings is but an auspicious sign—these too are appearances and must not be clung to. Only let the stabilized mind be utterly unobstructed above, vast and unbounded below. No prior thought arises—thus it is called "unobstructed above"; no subsequent thought arises—thus it is called "unbounded below." Old karma daily dissolves, new karma is not created. Past habits are entirely exhausted—this is called "old karma daily dissolving"; no further thoughts arise—thus it is called "new karma not created." Without entanglements, one transcends the cage of dust. Free from all defilement—this is called "without entanglements"; liberated and unbound—thus it is called "transcending the cage of dust."

With prolonged practice, the Dao is naturally attained. Unceasing luminous insight—this is called "prolonged practice"; accord with principle and union with truth—thus it is called "attaining the Dao." Those who attain the Dao exhibit seven signs: First, the mind easily attains stabilization and perceives all defiled leaks. The mind attains purity and knows all defiled thoughts—thus it is called "perceiving all defiled leaks." Second, chronic illnesses vanish entirely, body and mind become light and refreshed. True qi and fetal breathing heal all deep-seated ailments. Embodied union with the Dao brings a lightness of body and agelessness. Third, premature decay is restored, years are regained, and life is renewed. Bones and marrow become firm and full—thus it is called "restoring premature decay"; the countenance remains unchanged—this is called "regaining years and renewing life." Fourth, one extends life for ten thousand years and is called an immortal. Attaining longevity without death, extending life for ten thousand years, one’s name is recorded in the immortal registers—thus it is called an "immortal." Fifth, refining form into qi, one is called a perfected person. Attaining the original primordial qi—thus it is called "refining form into qi"; the true nature is without falsity—thus it is called a "perfected person." Sixth, refining qi into spirit, one is called a spirit person. True qi communicates with spirit, yin and yang are unfathomable—thus it is called a "spirit person." Seventh, refining spirit to merge with the Dao, one is called a consummate person. True spirit unites with the Dao—thus it is called a "consummate person." Their discerning power grows ever clearer with each sign. "Discerning power" means constant, unceasing illumination. "Ever clearer" means luminosity without end.

When the Dao is attained and perfected, wisdom becomes fully complete. If the original nature is realized, the Dao is attained and truth is perfected—wisdom becomes perfectly luminous, and all dharmas are complete. If, after long study of the stabilized mind, the body shows none of these signs, and one’s brief, impure life ends with the fading of form—claiming to have awakened wisdom or attained the Dao—such a one has not truly grasped the principle of seeking the Dao. Only through communion with spirit and union with the Dao is true attainment of the Dao achieved. Delusion of the mind and death of the body keep one from transcending birth and death. As the *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "Thus, losing the root of life, how can one know the source of the Dao?"

There is a gāthā that says:
Wisdom arises from conditions,
Fire is born from causes.
Each is the true seed-nature,
Yet following the current, the source of the Dao is lost.
To seek cessation of knowledge by arousing the mind—
The mind arises, and vexation increases.
Realizing the nature is fundamentally empty,
Knowledge becomes the gateway to all wonders.

The *Commentary on the Scripture of Stabilization and Contemplation of the Numinous Treasure* concludes here.

The Dao is learned through the mind, not sought elsewhere;
Spirit resides in form, with nothing beyond.
My numinous luminosity spans past and present,
Yet bound by the six senses, my true thought is harmed.
Greed, anger, delusion, and ignorance—
Manifold perceptual delusions,
Turning from truth toward falsity,
Without end.
Truly, the true teacher, pitying the ignorance of sentient beings,
Expounded this wondrous scripture,
As a model for humans and gods,
A ladder and vessel for attaining the Dao.
Thus, the teaching of stabilization and contemplation
Unfolds the wondrous essence,
Penetrates the profound and subtle,
Washes away defilements,
Transcends sight and sound;
Illuminates the formless behind forms,
Extends emptiness to the unmanifest,
Forgets both self and others,
Perfects both form and spirit.
All my fellow Daoists,
Revere it, revere it.
