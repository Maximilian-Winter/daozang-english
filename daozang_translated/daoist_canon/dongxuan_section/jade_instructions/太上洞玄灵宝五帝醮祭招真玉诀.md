The Dao speaks: The *Numinous Treasure Red Writ* comprises five scrolls of True Script, each governing one direction, all being the spontaneous writings of the Primordial Beginning. The Five Elders and Five Emperors stand in attendance, while the Numinous Officials of the Five Directions record and regulate them. The prohibitions are lifted thrice a year, allowing the host of immortals to deliver the Perfected.

According to the ancient statutes of the Mysterious Regulations, the Perfected of the Upper Offices and the divine immortals of the Five Marchmounts, once every three years, present offerings to the Numinous Officials of the Five Emperors of the Numinous Treasure: scattering flowers, kindling lamps, fragrant waters, and sweet fruits, to reverently offer to the Heavenly Perfected and preserve the numinous qi. Those later disciples who can consistently uphold this will move the Five Emperors of the Numinous Treasure with their sincerity, and the Numinous Officials of the Five Directions will rejoice in response.

In all rites, there is no distinction of lavishness or simplicity; what matters is the intention arising from within. If one possesses utmost sincerity, humans and spirits will be moved. Thus, these precepts and prohibitions are recorded for secret cultivation.

The ancient statutes prescribe the method for summoning the Numinous Officials of the Five Emperors of the Numinous Treasure:
- For spring, use the days of *jiǎyín* and *yǐmǎo*;
- For summer, use *dīngsì* and *bǐngwǔ*;
- For the four transitional periods, use *wùchén*, *wùxū*, *jǐwèi*, and *jǐchǒu*;
- For autumn, use *gēngshēn* and *xīnyǒu*;
- For winter, use *guǐhài* and *rénzǐ*.

On the *jiànwáng* day, construct a high altar upon the numinous marchmount, enclosing it with railings on four sides. At the eastern, western, southern, and northern cardinal points, set up five gates and place five placards. The inscriptions on the placards follow separate texts found in the *Great Covenant Rites*.

After installing the five gates, erect screens on all four sides to prevent wind from disrupting the firelight and qi. Ensure the fire’s qi remains dense, avoiding excessive illumination that would scatter the numinous qi. Spread a clean mat, five feet in size, and arrange it according to the season—facing east in spring.

Use fine incense, pure tea, jujube broth, and fresh fruits to purify the ritual seat, offering them according to abundance. Prepare eleven clean cups and new, fine ladles. Arrange three trays: two holding five cups each, and one holding a single cup. Place the single-cup tray below the five-cup tray. Arrange the five incense burners in sequence before the trays, and likewise prepare three trays of fruits. Place the remaining broth in a separate vessel before them.

On the table, lay out five feet of crimson-patterned silk, the *Nán Hé Dān Zēng*. Upon it, place the five scrolls of the *True Script of the Upper Clarity Numinous Treasure* and the five talismans. Cut five feet of azure-patterned silk from the *Bì Lín* fabric to cover the True Script and talismans, placing them behind the seat. Position the talismans within the crimson and azure silks to symbolize the covenant of cutting hair and drawing blood. The azure silk substitutes for hair, and the crimson for the blood oath. The Perfected do not harm their spirit or diminish their virtue, hence these substitutes.

Use five types of incense, blended together. Ensure each incense burner is new and fine, arranging them in sequence. Kneel with girded sash to invoke, speaking slowly and softly to subtly attract the descent of the Heavenly Perfected.

Inscribe six slips of white silver with cinnabar characters. Next, invoke the host of immortals and Numinous Officials of the Five Emperors, placing them below the five incense burners.

**For the East:**
The Nine Qi Azure Heaven, Peaceful Treasure Florescence Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder Lord; the Azure Emperor; the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord; the Supreme Perfected King; the Azure Waist Jade Maiden; and the Numinous Officials of the Eastern Realm.
This Perfected of the Emperor, [Name], twice bows to the five incenses and prostrates to reverently invite you. Descend through the Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.

**For the South:**
The Three Qi Vermilion Heaven, Brahma Treasure Prosperous Yang, Vermilion Numinous True Elder Lord; the Red Emperor; the Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lord; the Primordial Qi Elder; the Vermilion Palace Supreme Vermilion Jade Maiden; and the Numinous Officials of the Southern Realm.
This Perfected of the Emperor, [Name], twice bows to the five incenses and prostrates to reverently invite you. Descend through the Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.

**For the Center:**
The Primordial Cavern Supreme Emperor’s Heaven, Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Primordial Elder Lord; the Yellow Emperor; the Supreme Emperor Perfected; the Purple Cinnabar Yellow Court of *Wù-Jǐ*; the Heavenly Granary Jade Maiden; and the Numinous Officials of the Central Yellow Supreme Emperor.
This Perfected of the Emperor, [Name], twice bows to the five incenses and prostrates to reverently invite you. Descend through the Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate.

**For the West:**
The Seven Qi Heaven of the Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder Lord; the White Emperor; the Bright Stone Seven Qi Heavenly Lord; the Supreme White Plain Jade Maiden; and the Numinous Officials of the Western Realm.
This Perfected of the Emperor, [Name], twice bows to the five incenses and prostrates to reverently invite you. Descend through the Pervading Yin Complete Barrier Gate.

**For the North:**
The Five Qi Mysterious Heaven of the Cavern Yin, Solitary and Profound Five Numinous Mysterious Elder Lord; the Black Emperor; the Mysterious Nourishing Five Qi Heavenly Lord; the Supreme Perfected; at the first crow of the cock at dawn, face east, knock the teeth nine times, rub the palms until warm, and wipe the face nine times with the hands. Recite the prayer while imbibing the Azure Molar Qi.

Face south and perform the same ritual, knocking the teeth three times. Face west and knock seven times, as above. For the center, knock twelve times and wipe the face. For the north, knock five times, following the same method.

At the first crow of the cock, compose the body and settle the spirit. Proceed in order, first imbibing the Azure Molar Qi of the East, then the South, Center, West, and North, as described. After completing the Five Emperors, knock the teeth thirty-six times and swallow the qi twenty-five times to conclude.

Then recite the collective incantation:
*"White rocks towering, proceed in order,
Fountains gush through caverns as jade nectar.
Drink and attain long life,
Lifespan ever extended."*

Conclude by circling the tongue around the upper and lower mouth, gathering the jade spring until the mouth is full, and swallow thrice. Then draw the qi twenty-five times, swallowing it completely. The Dao is thus fulfilled.

The method for imbibing the Five Cloud Molar Qi is recorded in a separate scroll.

The Heavenly Perfected August One states: Those who cultivate the Dao of flying immortality, the methods of deliverance, corpse liberation, and concealed transformation—who cycle through life and death, roaming freely with the turning of fate, unbound by the Great Yin—must inscribe in cinnabar the limitless inner sounds of the Jade Characters of the Various Heavens, wear white silk upon the body, and consume them according to the script. With a heart untainted by impurity, the five viscera harmonize, the six palaces become tranquil, and the empty azure attains non-action. After eight years, one penetrates the various heavens, sits and perceives the ten directions, with myriad spirits descending in communion. The body generates jade radiance, and one rides the dragon chariot to ascend at dawn.

The Jade Chapters’ Supreme Dao is transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas. The methods of cultivation must follow the cinnabar-inscriptions above, aligning with the seasons’ nodes.

In the first, second, and third months of spring, inscribe the text in cinnabar, face the sovereign, and knock the teeth nine times. Recite the prayer:
*"Great Brahmā of Flying Heaven, Vairāja of the Eight Directions,
Nine Qi of the Azure Sky, all gathered as Divine Kings.
Five Unions and Eight Assemblies, streaming and radiant through the Great Void,
Above opening the Dragon Han, ancestral lineage of divine immortals,
Below parting the Long Night, chambers of the Nine Dark Realms.
Delivering suffering souls, decayed bones kindled with light,
The body transforms into feathered raiment, garments of five hues.
Azure dragons and jade chariots, soaring steps through empty space—
Today I make this supplication to the Azure Sky’s first yang.
May ten thousand vows unite, merging with qi as one,
Ascending into formlessness, eternally preserved without end."*
Upon completion, ingest the text and, facing upward, swallow eight breaths to conclude.

In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months of summer, inscribe the text in cinnabar, face the sovereign, and knock the teeth eight times. Recite the prayer:
*"Heavenly Script unfolds in the Brahmā-net, crimson clarity of the Dao’s practice,
Above opening the Eight Paths, Five Unions connecting the numinous.
The Great Cycle commences its term, the Cavern Yang refines essence,
Jade texts gleam resplendent, the Three Luminaries self-illumined.
Below delivering life and death, all who receive form—
Today is most auspicious, the Great Sage descends to the court.
Nine nights open the windows, dark chambers bright and clear,
The Three Evils cease, my Dao naturally fulfills.
The Five Emperors safeguard and deliver, ascending to the Flowery Capital,
Within the Seven Jeweled Grove, eternally enjoying kalpas’ longevity."*
Upon completion, ingest the text and, facing upward, swallow eight breaths to conclude.

In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months of autumn, inscribe the text in cinnabar, face the sovereign, and knock the teeth seven times. Recite the prayer:
*"Flying Mystery of the Eight Assemblies, coalescing qi to form the True,
Sixty-four characters, root of the Numinous Sky,
Opening deliverance from life and death, decayed bones restored to humanity,
Dark souls unbound, receiving qi to ascend the Supreme Mystery—
Today the time is propitious, ten thousand vows laid bare,
All spirits gather in communion, my wish for immortality,
Radiance merging with the Dao, my wish for divinity.
To ride the plain clouds, ascending to the Emperor’s dawn,
Rejoicing among the Seven Treasures, befriending perfected beings."*
Upon completion, ingest the text and, facing upward, swallow eight breaths to conclude.

In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months of winter, inscribe the text in cinnabar, face the sovereign, and knock the teeth five times. Recite the prayer:
*"Jade characters open the dark, streaming radiance to the upper gate,
Eight qi coalesce the True, Brahmā-practice of luminous clouds,
Divine Kings kindle light, the Three Images cleave asunder,
Five hues swirl and linger, illuminating my numinous soul—
Today the convergence is met, I gaze upward to the Imperial Lord,
Opening and pardoning to bestow the script, granting me the True Text,
Jade moisture intermingles and irrigates, the five palaces suffused with fragrance,
Feathers and plumage transform, mounting radiance to ride the dawn,
Exiting darkness to enter the formless, immortal deliverance naturally attained,
Seven ancestors together return, rejoicing in the Upper Prime."*
Upon completion, ingest the text and, facing upward, swallow eight breaths to conclude.

The Heavenly Perfected August One states: These invocatory words are the qi of the Four Assemblies, the sounds of the Eight Harmonies, the natural chapters of spontaneity. Those who practice them gather herbs without concealment, mountain spirits submit and hide, demonic trials do not intrude, tigers and wolves with venomous stings cannot assail the body. Jade maidens and divine youths attend and serve in all directions, the numinous qi of the Five Emperors descend into one’s form, pacifying and stabilizing the five viscera, brightening inner and outer senses, the heart opened and intent penetrating, foreknowing fortune and misfortune. The Three Corpses vanish, the Nine Worms do not arise. The body grows wondrous fur, swiftly attaining divine immortality. Only by the grace of the Most August Supreme Emperor, who deigns to bestow merciful kindness, flowing down to the multitudes, granting as petitioned—unable to bear such vast beneficence, I humbly offer my diligent service. Your servant [Name], with reverence and awe, prostrates and bows twice. Again, three times offer warmed wine, prostrating upon the ground. If there are private petitions, present them as one’s heart desires. Upon concluding the supplications, first honor the Eastern Azure Emperor of Numinous Might, the Nine Qi Azure Sprout Heavenly Lord, the Supreme Perfected King, the Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist, and the various spirit officials of the Eastern Quarter, each returning to their divine chambers, then scatter incense and bow twice. Next honor the Southern Vermilion Emperor of Blazing Might, the Three Qi Vermilion Heavenly Lord, the Elder of Primordial Qi, the Great Vermilion Jade Maiden of the Vermilion Palace, and the various spirit officials of the Southern Quarter, each returning to their divine chambers, then scatter incense and bow twice. Next honor the Central Yellow Emperor of the Encompassing Pivot, the Supreme Emperor Perfected One, the Zi Dan of the Yellow Court’s Wu Ji, the Jade Maiden of the Heavenly Granary, and the various spirit officials of the Central Yellow Supreme Emperor’s Palace, each returning to their divine chambers, then scatter incense and bow twice. Next honor the Western White Emperor of Radiant Soul, the Seven Qi Bright Stone Heavenly Lord, the Supreme White Plain Jade Maiden, and the various spirit officials of the Western Quarter, each returning to their divine chambers, then scatter incense and bow twice. Next honor the Northern Black Emperor of Hidden Might, the Five Qi Mysterious Nourishment Heavenly Lord, the Supreme Numinous Lord, the Night Radiance Jade Maiden, and the various spirit officials of the Northern Quarter, each returning to their divine chambers, then scatter incense and bow twice. Next honor the multitude of spirits of the Nine Heavens, the perfected ones of the Five Marchmounts’ numinous mountains, the various spirit officials of the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the rivers and four watercourses, the Jade Maidens of Earthly Immortals, and the various spirit officials of the flying immortals and divine immortals of the Five Marchmounts, each returning to their divine chambers, then scatter incense and bow twice. The rites of offering and libation are complete. Take the tablets and bury them beneath the five gates, burying the multitude of perfected ones’ tablets beneath the central gate. This is performed once every three years, thrice in nine years, and then ceases.

Daoist Zhang Chengxian states: On the day of receiving the Two Registers of the Five Elders’ Vermilion Script of the Numinous Treasure, one should immediately perform the libation rites according to the method to summon the Heavenly Perfected. Their hidden radiance will respond and descend through the power of sincerity. Thereafter, supplicate once every three years, and prayers will surely be answered.
