**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Wisdom Adorations**

The Supreme’s mysterious void is the ancestral teaching,
Its scriptures revered for vasting the Dao.
Bowing and rising, one attains immortality,
Passing kalpas without reckoning of years.
Majestic is the Great Perfected’s virtue,
Silent and still, rooted in non-arising.
Celestial radiance weaves empty structures,
Riding the void, naturally journeying.
Sun and moon blaze with brilliance,
Peace and harmony bring boundless joy.
Those who study immortality sever ornate thoughts,
Each thought accumulates through mutual causation.
Coming and going disturb my spirit,
Restlessness prevents all attainment.
Extinguish thoughts, dwell in tranquil leisure,
Effortlessly enter emptiness and stillness.
Seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst,
Hold resolve firm as metal and stone.
Preserve the child, ascend the mysterious path,
The Five Numinous Ones transmit talismanic registers.
Cross me through the Six Perfections,
Thus able to unbind the Three Netherworlds.
Purify fasts, venerate the Primal Simplicity,
Exhale and inhale to nurture cloud-teeth.
Roam within the Golden Gates,
Jade Capital is my home.
Naturally, the Seven Treasures arise,
Each person seated upon a lotus.
Gazing upward, chew the forbidden fruit of the Mysterious Capital,
Bowing down, drink deeply of the hollow melon of the Void.
Complexion shines like a thousand suns,
Why reckon the multitude of kalpas?
Dharma drums summon celestial immortals,
Resonant bells subdue great demons.
Divine winds waft fragrant blossoms,
Resplendent, unfurling ornate robes.
The Great Perfected strums the cloud zither,
The assembled immortals pluck numinous lutes.
Elegant songs resound in the Three Heavens,
Scattering wisdom through the Jade Flower Grove.
The seven ancestors ascend the Hall of Blessings,
Thereby treading the mysterious tones.
If past-life virtue was insufficient,
This scripture remains distant and hard to find.
Sincerity in the Dao knows no end,
Yet plotting flight only leads to sinking.
The Supreme’s non-active Dao,
Expands within the hearts of all beings.
Studying the Dao arises from cinnabar faith,
Revering the master as one’s closest kin.
Drawing in radiance, pairing with purity and emptiness,
Diligently renewing with each passing day.
Until all beings are delivered,
I shall not deliver myself.
Great vows bear weighty recompense,
Mysterious virtue must naturally unfold.
Yin evil sins run deep,
Confronting one like a turning wheel.
Studying the Dao is also arduous,
Day and night, cultivate the field of blessings.
Planting virtue is like planting a tree,
Piling baskets of earth to form a mountain.
If you can delight in the mysterious and exalted,
You shall soar to the azure heavens.
Cultivate this non-active Dao,
And be bound in affinity with goodness.

The Supreme’s most recondite scripture,
Is called the *Wisdom Chapters*.
Liberation from suffering comes through great talent,
Transcending the mundane to attain the Real.
Numinous countenance, rare in the world,
Glowing like a lotus in the abyss.
Each person’s conduct has its root,
All stemming from past-life merit.
Establish virtue while time permits,
Make vows—none shall go unanswered.
Good and evil both await their retribution,
The principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.
The worthy uphold the Dharma’s words,
Virtue and power lie in forgetting both.
Understanding this is great wisdom,
Ascending to become a Lord of the Great Ultimate.
Jeweled canopies rise in succession,
Commanding chariots drawn by nine dragons.
Golden blossoms hold the Cavernous Scriptures,
Immortal youths bear incense.
Whistling songs resound through the Mysterious Capital,
Jade chimes strike the jasper bells.
Rising to ascend the Great Clarity,
Surpassing radiance to roam the Purple Empyrean,
Preserving the origin, upholding the Dharma’s net,
Wandering the mysterious ultimate in freedom.
Ten thousand kalpas are like last night,
A thousand *chun* like this morning.
Towering, shading the cloud blossoms,
Hand grasping the branches of the Jeweled Grove.
Fragrant smoke naturally arises,
Mysterious steps ascend on whirlwinds.
Divine banners disperse with the wind,
Complex thoughts dissolve in due time.
Extinguish wisdom, vast the great chaos,
Observe the pure hymn of non-action.

**Eulogy of the Earth Talisman**

Resplendent, it unveils the hidden epoch,
Obscuring the radiance of sun and moon.
Mysterious yin does not dissolve the night,
The four assemblies all reverently attend.
Numinous destiny naturally accords with the plan,
Suddenly illuminating the vast sky.
The scripture’s eightfold script forms characters,
The five tones harmonize into verses.
The Perfected opens great forgiveness,
The heavens, vast and bright, descend.
Wondrous is the Dragon Han Dao,
The eightfold script coalesces into form.
Resplendent, it soars within the void,
Streaming light through the courts of the Three Realms.
Divine charts reveal numinous assemblies,
Jade script bears talismanic names.
Pray to the Perfected, ascend the Purple Peak,
Proclaim destiny at the Numinous Mountain.
Jade maidens raise Brahmanic echoes,
Golden youths offer purple incense.
Script names communicate with the Nine Palaces,
Characters ascend to the Three Heavens.
Eternally enjoy boundless longevity,
Inscribed to become Golden Flower Immortals.

**Invoking the Perfected**

The Nine Heavens command the numinous chapters,
The spirit of life transcends itself.
The Primordial Lord halts the path of death,
The Marshal recites the Cavernous Hymns.
One chant, and the myriad Perfected know,
Nine recitations, and the heavens all attend.
Bowing heads, revering the kalpic years,
Celebrating the purple glory of the ancient sprouts.
The Great Void stirs numinous assemblies,
Commanding me to compose the *Life-Spirit Chapters*.
One chant stirs the Nine Mysteries,
A second recitation unites heaven and earth.
Harmonizing naturally with one another,
Nine recitations perfect human merit.
The Great Sage praises primordial auspiciousness,
Scattering blossoms to venerate the Great Void.
Pray to the Perfected—they shall surely respond,
Request blessings—blessings shall be vast.
The heavens all rejoice,
All bow heads in reverence.
Resonant are the Nine Heavens’ tones,
Jade chapters give rise to myriad spirits.
Three recitations array the correct positions,
*Qi* intermingles at the gates of the eight celestial bodies.
The Mysterious Pass halts the gate of death,
The Numinous Seal guards the source of fluids.
Responsive assemblies naturally stir the numinous,
Numerical clarity reveals the Dao’s hidden return.
The wheel of blessings sheds the infant’s husk,
Bowing heads to praise the Cavernous Scriptures.

**Thanksgiving to the Spirits**

Today, we pray for luminous blessings,
Bowing heads to the numinous altar.
The assembled immortals all descend,
The host of sages all come to observe.
Having bestowed abundant grace,
They linger, cranes circling in flight.
May the fast’s host enjoy long life,
The entire household find peace and security.
Radiant between heaven and earth,
Wandering among the assembled spirits.
The Milky Way scatters auspicious clouds,
Gates and courtyards teem with wind and rain.
Today, the immortals and sages descend,
Bestowing grace in answer to prayers.
Sweet dew sprinkles upon the destitute,
Hungry ghosts are naturally gathered.
Rank and emolument accord with the nether registers,
Wealth and nobility endure for a thousand autumns.

All you boundless beings of the human and celestial realms,
Fortunate to encounter the true Dharma King.
Compassionately descending to the ritual arena,
Smiling, releasing majestic radiance.
Illuminating the three-thousandfold great chiliocosm,
Devotedly prostrating to the ten directions.

With single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, Lord of the Land of Many Joys in the Eastern Realm.
With single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings, the Mysterious Perfected of the Land of the Great Blessing Hall in the Southern Realm.

With single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, as numerous as the dust-motes in the boundless void.
With single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures: the divine texts, numinous talismans, and precious strategies of the Three Caverns.
With single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the profound Dharma treasury of the cloud-seal in empty space, its eight corners trailing radiance.
With single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Fragrant Forest Treasure Palace of the Jade Capital Heavenly Terrace.
With single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, who transmits the scriptures, expounds the teachings, and ferries the deluded multitudes.
With single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the perfected immortals, the mysterious masters, and the host of transcendents who have attained the Dao in the ten directions.

Your servant now universally invokes the grace of the Dao for the upper realms and the lower regions, the six paths of humans and celestials, emperors and lords, masters and ancestors through kalpas past, parents who gave us birth, patrons of the ten directions, and all beings of the six paths and four births. May all receive the blessings of the Dao and return to repentance.

With utmost sincerity, we repent.
Born in an enlightened age, we have long encountered a time of felicity and entered the Mysterious Gate. Though our bodies remain mired in delusion, our masters have bestowed upon us the sacred texts. Yet driven by karmic entanglements, we stumble at every turn. In the three assemblies and five years of ordination, we have accomplished little merit; at the eight festivals and three origins, we have often neglected rites and recitations. On the ten fast days and our birthdays, we have failed to cultivate practice; on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, we have not paid homage to the perfected or guarded the sacred precincts. Of the nine grades of purification rites, our minds have not been single-mindedly devoted; of the three thousand deeds of merit, we have never reverently upheld them. The precepts and prohibitions are most weighty, yet our every action incurs transgression; the commandments are majestic and stern, yet our frivolous speech compounds our faults. Our hearts and minds stray, violating one hundred and eighty precepts; our wisdom and discernment deeply transgress, forsaking the three hundred great commandments. We ourselves have created the three karmic deeds, and our misfortunes accumulate like mountains; the six desires and four entanglements plunge our transgressions as deep as the vast sea. Our offenses are recorded in the black registers, our sins bound in the nether courts. We constantly fear that when judgment comes, our bodies will be carved away and our lives wither in the repositories of fate.

We humbly beseech the Most Perfect and Most Sagely to distantly behold our sincere devotion, to remove death and ascend to life, to further extend our years, to forever extinguish calamities, to bestow upon us fortune and wisdom, to grant us ample emolument and long life. May we ever dwell in the shade of the Dharma, our wisdom penetrating the mysterious, forever dispelling delusion and confusion, practicing the Dao to attain perfection, and upholding the scriptures without transgression.

Having repented, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.

With utmost sincerity, we vow:
May we, through kalpas past, broadly cultivate the goodness of the three karmic deeds.
May we constantly uphold the wondrous Dharma to save sentient beings,
Never enmeshed in the snares of the dusty world.
May we, life after life, transcend the sufferings of the three evil paths,
And attain a heart as bright as the sun of wisdom,
Able to dispel darkness and illuminate the void,
In all Dharmas, free from the notions of self and others.
May we constantly arise in the compassionate practice of the One Vehicle,
Our mouths ever savoring the sweet dew of gathas,
Proclaiming the pure precepts to deliver humans and celestials,
Never uttering evil speech or frivolous words.
May we never consume the lives of beings that breathe blood,
Our feet never tread the three evil paths.
May our hands never kill a single living being,
Our bodies like shadows, aiding the Heavenly Worthies.
In sitting and rising, may we traverse without shunning the distant,
Wishing that all kinds, together with us,
May forsake the bodies of hungry ghosts and beasts,
And with the celestials and humans of the three realms,
All diligently seek the supreme Dao.

Having made our vows, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.

All listen to these words:
At this time, recite the verse of purity,
If you seek to return to the true Dao,
Leave the worldly and dwell in the cliffs and peaks,
Thrice daily burn precious incense.
With steadfast hearts, diligently uphold the precepts,
You must forsake glory and emolument,
Let not fame and profit entangle you.
Then you will encounter a true person,
Who will transmit to you the supreme Dao.

Those in the upper, middle, and lower seats,
Each remember the six recollections:
Recollect Heaven, recollect Earth,
Recollect the Dao, recollect the scriptures,
Recollect the perfected, recollect the precepts.

All listen to the diligent upholding of the precepts:
First, do not kill;
Second, do not steal;
Third, do not engage in illicit sex;
Fourth, do not lie;
Fifth, do not indulge in wine or eat meat;
Sixth, do not slander the worthy and good.

The Heavenly Worthy’s bequeathed teachings clearly exhort and admonish.
Strive diligently in cultivation,
Seek early liberation.
The human body is hard to obtain,
Birth in the Middle Kingdom is hard to attain.
Once the human body is lost,
For ten thousand kalpas it is not regained.
Therefore, I exhort you all,
Together return to this ritual arena.
In this life and the next,
Constantly encounter the true scriptures and precepts.

Having admonished and exhorted, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.

Here concludes *The Wondrous Wisdom Hymn of Veneration from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern of Mystery*.
