**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Five Talismans Preface, Scroll One**

In primordial antiquity, harmony was pure and unadulterated; yin and yang flowed without entanglement. The wind stirred not the branches, clouds and rain came in their season. All things followed their own hearts, the multitudes walked the Dao/Way by nature, aligning above with the celestial mind. Heaven and humanity merged in qi, fortune and misfortune showed no omens, no fear arose from calamity, no joy from blessing. No words of approval or disapproval were spoken, no teachings of right or wrong were given. Unblemished and unchanging, steadfast and undiminished, they entrusted themselves to heaven and followed their nature, yielded to earth and let fate unfold. All attained their place, none harmed the harmony.

When harmony remained unharmed, heaven and earth had no ruler, yet transformed of themselves. The great instruction of no-teaching preserved their destiny. At that time, humans lived nine myriad years before beginning to study the immortal Dao/Way and ascend to heaven. This may be called the ultimate transformation, following the heart’s inclination—truly the ultimate teaching. Transformation knew no fixed method, teaching left no trace. Though no trace was seen, its merit endured; though instruction was ever-preserved, its virtue/power vanished. This may be called the celestial harmony manifesting its image, the Three Powers (heaven, earth, humanity) in perfect accord.

By the era of the Three Sovereigns, the pure harmony began to wane. Slight gains and losses appeared, joy and anger showed in countenance. Institutions were established to order the people, spirits and numina tended the body to preserve the multitude. This may be called the beginning of strife and the emergence of contention. The people spoke of gains and losses, naturally giving rise to omens. The hexagrams symbolized the myriad things, calculating the mysterious void within heaven and earth. The rise of affairs found its omen here.

By the time of the Yellow Emperor, the age of Shennong had declined. The feudal lords encroached upon one another, their qi of attack and seizure mutual. Even a wise ruler could not rectify them. Thus, the Yellow Emperor practiced the arts of war, punishing those who defied court. The feudal lords all came to submit, yet Chiyou was the most violent—none could subdue him. The Flame Emperor sought to dominate the feudal lords, but they all turned to the Yellow Emperor. He then cultivated virtue/power and marshaled his troops, ordering the five grains, aiding and comforting the people, surveying the four directions, and training bears, black bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, tigers, and macaques to battle the Flame Emperor at the wilds of Banquan. After three engagements, he achieved his aim.

Chiyou caused chaos, refusing the Emperor’s command. The Yellow Emperor then mustered his forces and fought Chiyou at the wilds of Zhuolu, ultimately defeating him. The feudal lords thereupon honored the Yellow Emperor as Son of Heaven, succeeding the House of Shennong. He styled his reign by clouds, naming his court the Cloud Host, and appointed left and right grand inspectors to oversee the myriad states, spirits, and numina. He sealed mountains and rivers, performed feng and shan sacrifices, and did so abundantly. He obtained the precious tripod, welcomed the sun, and employed the *yi* divination. He elevated Feng Hou, Li Mu, Heng Xian, and Da Hong to govern the people. He aligned with the celestial and terrestrial principles, the mysteries of light and darkness, the doctrines of life and death, the perils of survival and extinction. He sowed the hundred grains and grasses, transformed birds, beasts, silkworms, and mulberries, and regulated the sun, moon, stars, water, earth, stones, metal, and jade. He toiled with mind, strength, ears, and eyes, moderated the use of water, fire, and all things, possessing the auspicious sign of earthly virtue/power—thus he was called the Yellow Emperor.

The Yellow Emperor fathered twenty-five sons, fourteen of whom received surnames. He dwelled on Mount Xuanyuan and took as wife the daughter of Xiling, named Leizu. Leizu became the Yellow Emperor’s principal consort and bore two sons, both of whom later ruled the world. The first was Xuanxiao, known as Qingyang, who descended to dwell by the Jiang River. The second was Changyi, who descended to dwell by the Weak River. Changyi married the daughter of Mount Shu, named Changpu, and begot Gaoyang. Gaoyang possessed sagely virtue/power and was known as Zhuanxu, grandson of the Yellow Emperor and son of Changyi. Profound and pure, he was wise and far-reaching, cultivating resources to employ the earth, bearing the seasons to emulate heaven. He relied on spirits and numina to uphold trust and righteousness, governed qi to instruct the people, and purified his sincerity in sacrifices and rites. From the northern reaches of Youling to the southern Danxue, from the western Flowing Sands to the eastern Coiling Tree, all moving and still beings, great and small spirits, all within the light of the sun and moon, acknowledged his rule.

He fathered a son named Qiongchan, while Xuanxiao’s grandson Gaoxin ascended the throne as Emperor Ku. Emperor Ku was the Yellow Emperor’s great-grandson. Gaoxin’s father was Qiaoji, whose father was Xuanxiao, whose father was the Yellow Emperor. From Xuanxiao to Qiaoji, none held the throne, until Gaoxin assumed the imperial seat. Gaoxin was a distant nephew to Emperor Zhuanxu. Born divine and numinous, he declared his name as "universally beneficial," not for his own sake. Keen of hearing to know the distant, clear of sight to perceive the subtle, he followed heaven’s principles and understood the people’s needs. Benevolent yet majestic, kind yet trustworthy, he cultivated himself and the world submitted. He took the things of the earth and used them with restraint, comforted and taught the people to benefit them, tracked the sun and moon to welcome and send them, and illuminated spirits and numina to reverently serve them. His countenance was expansive, his virtue/power towering. His actions were timely, his governance skillful.

Emperor Ku held the center and embodied heaven’s mandate. Where the sun and moon shone, where wind and rain reached, none failed to assist him. He wholly grasped the heart of heaven and earth. At that time, celestial beings, divine immortals, and perfected officials descended to him, riding a precious canopy and a dark chariot drawn by nine dragons, urging cloud-horses and emerging from the heavenly window. They called themselves the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Kings and the Three Heavens’ Perfected Sovereigns, each bearing the eight luminous tally and wearing the talisman of radiant clouds. Arriving at the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue/Power, they bestowed upon Emperor Ku the *Nine Heavens’ Perfected Numinous Scripture* and the *Three Heavens’ Perfected Treasure Talismans*. The nine heavens’ true golden script opened the qi of the Supreme One’s communion with heaven above and spread the measure of the primordial generation of spirits and numina below. It bounded the primordial chaos to set limits, ended the earth’s darkness to bring forth beginnings. Only the celestial perfected could fathom its depths; even the worthy below could not reach its bounds.

The nine qi’s refinement aligned spirits with the sun and moon, and thus plants, trees, grasses, and the myriad kinds were distinguished, their sweet and bitter flavors manifesting, metals and stones diverging in kind. Above, it ordered heaven, leaving nothing of the Two Modes ungoverned; below, it ordered humankind, ensuring that years and lifespans would not falter. Those who attained vision grasped its intent; those who entered the subtle marveled at its savor.

Yet its text was vast and flourishing, the celestial script difficult to fathom. The Perfected Ones’ words could not be deciphered, the Supreme One’s mind beyond the reach of the multitude. Without enlightenment from the highest spirits, none could glimpse its first unfolding.

Thus Emperor Ku lamented his own meager talent, treasuring the script yet unable to turn toward its meaning. He then offered sacrifice at the Altar of the Celestial Thearch by the Northern River, concealing the text upon the peak of Mount Zhong, sealing it within a casket of azure jade, awaiting a later sage of merit and virtue to put it into practice.

Its seclusion lay on Mount Zhong, north of the Weak Waters, nineteen thousand *li* away. The mountain rose twelve thousand *li* high, its summit spanning seven thousand *li*, its circumference thirty thousand *li*. It bore a thousand divine mushrooms and a hundred and forty kinds of spirit grasses—whoever trod upon its soil would attain transcendence after three steps. At its peak stood a golden terrace and a seven-jeweled purple palace, the abode of primordial qi and the seat of governance of the Celestial Thearch Lord. Neither sun nor moon could illuminate it, yet Mount Zhong’s radiance shone bright day and night, casting light a hundred thousand *li* beyond, where even the stars and Milky Way could not reach. The sages spoke of heaven’s gap in the northwest—this was Mount Zhong illuminating the depths of the Nine Yin.

In the time of Emperor Yao, the floodwaters surged to the heavens, mountains collapsed and ridges crumbled, and the people below were filled with dread. Yao commanded the search for one capable of controlling the waters, and all his ministers and the Four Peaks declared, “Gun is fit.” Yao said, “Gun is a man who defies mandate and destroys his kin, his heart wounded and flawed. I fear he cannot be employed.” The Four Peaks replied, “We have yet to see one more worthy than Gun. We beg Your Majesty to test him.” Thus Yao heeded the Four Peaks and tasked Gun with regulating the waters. For nine years the waters did not recede, and his efforts bore no fruit.

Thereupon Emperor Yao sought another, and obtained Shun. Shun ascended to office, assuming the governance of the Son of Heaven. He toured and inspected the realm, and seeing that Gun’s regulation of the waters had failed, he banished Gun to die at Feather Mountain. All under heaven deemed Shun’s punishment just. Then Shun declared that Gun’s son Yu was capable and sent him to continue his father’s work.

When Yao passed, Emperor Shun asked the Four Peaks, “Is there one who can beautifully complete Yao’s undertakings and hold office?” All replied, “Earl Yu, as Minister of Works, can accomplish the task and perfect Yao’s merit.” Shun said, “Ah! I command Yu to finally pacify the waters and the earth.” Yu bowed and kowtowed, yielding to Xie, Hou Ji, and Gao Yao. Shun said, “Go and attend to your duties.”

Yu was a man of keen diligence and sagacious aid. His virtue was unerring, his benevolence endearing, his words trustworthy. His voice set the pitch, his body the measure, his weight the standard of earth. Solemn and reverent, he was the warp and weft of governance. Thereupon Yu, together with Yi and Hou Ji, led the emperor’s command, the feudal lords, and the common people, mobilizing laborers to spread earth, following the mountains to fell trees, and determining the heights of great mountains and rivers.

Yu grieved that his father Gun’s efforts had failed and he had suffered punishment. Thus he toiled his body and burned his thoughts, dwelling abroad for thirteen years, passing his home without daring to enter. He wore coarse clothing and ate sparingly to offer filial piety to the spirits, humbled his palace and exhausted his strength in ditches and canals. On land he rode a chariot, on water a boat, through mud a sledge, and over mountains a *biao*. With the marking cord in his left hand and the compass and square in his right, he bore the four seasons to open the Nine Provinces, dredge the Nine Ways, dam the Nine Marshes, and survey the Nine Mountains.

He commanded Yi and the multitudes to plant rice in low, damp places. He commanded Hou Ji and the multitudes to prepare meager and fresh foods, ensuring that those with little were supplied by those with abundance, thus equalizing the feudal lords. Yu then assessed the suitability of the land’s resources for tribute and the convenience of mountains and rivers.

Yu began his work in Jizhou, having already cut through the Hukou and Liang ridges and the Qi. He repaired Taiyuan up to Yueyang, and Tanhuai’s achievements extended to Heng, Zhang, and the Wei and Si rivers. Having traversed the Great Marsh, he crafted the island barbarians’ fur garments. Flanking the right of Jieshi, he entered the Yellow River, and crossing the river, he reached Xuzhou. The Nine Rivers were dredged, Leixia became a marsh, and the Nong and Ju converged. The mulberry lands were cultivated for silkworms, and thus the people could descend from the hills to dwell below.

After the earth of the central plains was leveled and the great waters receded, he then toured and offered sacrifices at Mount Zhong, worshipped the Celestial Thearch at the Jade Palace, returned the great merit to the Heavenly Queen, and restored great accomplishment to the myriad spirits. Then he ascended the dark peak, to the bend of Embroidered Ridge, upon the jeweled realm. Suddenly, he obtained this scripture.

Yu then redoubled his reverence, fasting and purifying himself in the secluded groves and hidden valleys, to request and wear it upon his person. The Perfected One told Yu, “Your merit and virtue have moved the spirits, and heaven and humankind both aid you. Yet your years and lifespan approach decline—how perilous!” He then imparted the oral instructions of the Way of long life, revealed the methods of wearing and employing the true treasures, and divided and distinguished them.

Returning, Yu then calculated his labors in the wilds of Kuaiji, summoning and assembling the host of spirits at the mountains of Eastern Yue. At that time, the four qi were warm and flourishing, the pure winds had risen, the dark merit flowed subtly, and his empty heart was inwardly ordered. He contemplated withdrawing to erase his traces, concealing his radiance in hidden beginnings. Gazing upon the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens, observing the treasure gardens of the Three Heavens, he moved with the great compliance of preserving life, stilled with the enduring vision of storing essence. Above, he perused the celestial scriptures, profound and difficult to unravel; below, he pitied the multitude of beings, ignorant of their guiding principles.

Thus he once more soared like a phoenix over the Southern Mountains and stood like a dragon upon the sea isles. He further compiled the dark essentials of the Perfected and Numinous, gathered the treasure scriptures of the Heavenly Palace, arranged their ranks and grades, and distinguished their practices. He determined the directions with the five colors and named their thearchs’ titles.

The Supreme One’s original name for it was the *Celestial Writ of the Five Numinous Talismans of the Lingbao*. It was concealed within the Dark Terrace, in the ancient red stone vault of *cigui*, hidden in the valleys of Miaoshan. Once every ten thousand years it emerges, to demonstrate its immortality.

The first scroll was inscribed on cinnabar-dyed silk and concealed within the dense thickets of Menglong Hill. It was sealed in a casket of golden blossoms and stamped with the seal of the Dark Capital. The river and marsh water spirits were commanded to deliver it to the Lord of the Zhenshui Grotto Chamber, to be transmitted at the assembly of three thousand years to the Water Master Fu Bochang. As for the script on the stone vault, it awaited the arrival of the great kalpa before being revealed.

Yu, having taken the numinous formula to conceal his radiance, buried himself in this mountain to manifest his end. Immortals understood the covenant, while fools called him dead. How vast the divine transformation—committing the body to return to the origin! Alas, great lord, your dark traces reach lofty heights, your Way chants await its method through ten thousand kalpas. When the Yang Nine reveals the celestial writ and the Hundred Six proclaims the merit of the transmitted lineage, your mighty song shall resound for a thousand generations, leaving the fragrance of orchid qi as legacy.

Later, in the twelfth year of King Helü of Wu, in the first month of spring, he ordered his troops to muster along the rivers and lakes, his banners gleaming with dragons. He reviewed his forces before the enemy state and loosened his belt at Baoshan. The Recluse of Baoshan, acting as his envoy, was known as the Venerable Dragon Might. He was commanded to explore the depths of the grotto chamber and tread the source of the vast cavern.

The Recluse of Baoshan was one who had attained the Dao. Dwelling on Mount Wu, none knew his name. Aloof and untrammeled, he stood apart from worldly glory, and so the people called him the Recluse of Baoshan. Helü repeatedly visited him in person to pay respects and inquire about fortune and misfortune. It was at that time they once discussed the origins of this path, and so he was temporarily dispatched.

The Recluse thus carried torches and fire, traveling day and night for one hundred seventy-four days before returning. Upon his return, he recounted: "I knew not its limits. The Recluse walked perhaps over seven thousand li when suddenly he encountered a tangle of grassy hollows and myriad paths—hundreds of trails and shifting sand roads—all converging in one place, their forms and gates alike. At the mouth of these clustered paths stood a city of gold and jade, five hundred li in circumference, at the center of all ways. Bright moonlight gleamed, its radiance effulgent. Within were curtains, couches, and looms; windows and secluded chambers adorned with purple jade and embellished with yellow gold. Cloud-piercing towers soared, their shapes beyond recognition.

Gazing about, I saw no one. Looking toward the city’s side, I beheld an inscription above the gate: *Detached Palace of the Queen of Heaven*, and above the door: *Hall of the Great Yin*. Knowing this to be a divine abode, I dared not rashly enter. Instead, I purified myself and fasted, contemplating the Perfected for three days. Then, offering my humble gifts, I entered and surveyed the interior. Within a jade chamber, upon a northern couch, lay a scroll of red silk, its characters indecipherable.

I bowed twice and took the scroll, saying: 'A petty servant of the lower realm, sent by the King of Wu, humbly requests this divine writ to serve as a token of authentic qi for external application.' Having exited, I saw the gates close of their own accord. From within came the sounds of flutes, drums, and the clamor of men and horses. Trembling with fear, I dared not linger, nor venture further along the path, lest I become lost and unable to find my way back. Thus I turned and returned, bearing the obtained scroll to present to Helü.

I recounted my journey: at first, all was dim, and I advanced only by torchlight. Even so, I could barely distinguish the murk. Along the path, all four directions—above and below—were of blue-green stone, roughly five or six zhang square, nearly uniform in size. At times the way widened or narrowed. Where my feet trod, the ground was damp, sometimes for one or two li. After walking perhaps a thousand li, the darkness lifted, and natural light shone as bright as day. The great path was high and dry, dust rising. To either side lay yin and yang channels, and every thirty li stood a stone well, its water sweet and refreshing. Drinking it, I felt full and no longer hungry. At times, I saw traces of men and horses branching into other paths.

The path I took, along with its left and right walls, appeared to be of white stone, all translucent and luminous—seventy or eighty zhang wide, nearly two hundred zhang high. Nearing the Dongting Grotto, I could no longer see its upper reaches. Looking up, it seemed like the sky, yet the daylight grew ever brighter, as intense as midday. Neither warm nor cold, a harmonious qi suffused the air. A fragrant aroma lingered, rich and unceasing.

Along the way stood chambers and pavilions, their exquisite carvings beyond description. Arriving at the convergence of paths, I circled the vast and narrow ways, traversing perhaps forty or fifty li. On all four sides stood jade pillars bearing inscriptions: *Ruins of the Nine Springs and Dongting*. Between them, trees stood in rows—green leaves and purple blossoms, dark grasses and white flowers—all unknown to me. Five colors arose naturally, the seven treasures gleaming brilliantly. Flying phoenixes soared above, dragons and unicorns played below. Truly, this was the numinous treasury of Heaven and Earth, the grand abode of the Perfected One."

The Recluse detailed all he had witnessed and shown it to the king. Helü listened with solemn awe, then purified himself in a quiet terrace, offering sacrifices to Heaven before receiving the scroll. That very year, the winds and rains of Great Fuxi came in season, the five grains ripened abundantly, the people rejoiced in their labors, and the land was at peace.

Helü treasured the celestial writ but could not decipher its words. He dispatched an envoy bearing the scroll, sealed with golden fastenings and stamped with the Jade Emperor’s seal, to inquire of Confucius, the Grand Master of Lu. The envoy arrived in Lu, presented the scroll, and knelt before Confucius, saying: "Once, the King of Wu commanded his chariot to journey forth, gazing upon the sea’s ford. His troops rested at the eastern forest mound, and he feasted on the northern slopes of Baoshan. There, his steeds were fed and his carriage stilled, when suddenly a red crow soared among them, bearing this silk scroll, which fell before the king’s chariot. A great omen of fortune, a numinous sign from Heaven—may the kingdom enjoy ten thousand generations, its legacy enduring as metal and stone. Your servant, sent forth from the state, bears this celestial writ, wishing to know the cause of auspicious blessings and future felicity."

Confucius, serene in his leisure, did not open the casket. He replied to the envoy: "Once, I traveled along the Western River and heard children singing: *'The King of Wu journeys forth to view Zhen Lake; the Venerable Dragon Might, named the Recluse, ascends Baoshan to enter the numinous ruins. There he reaches Dongting to steal Yu’s book—the great writ of Heaven cannot be unfurled. This is the beginning of the Hundred Six for Fu Bochang. Though now retrieved, it shall bring ruin to the gates of Wu.'*"

Confucius examined the words of the children’s song: Long ago, when Yu of Xia tamed the floods and leveled the mountains and rivers, his work complete, he patrolled the slopes of Mount Zhong and there obtained the *True Scripture of the Supreme Numinous Treasure* bestowed upon the Yellow Emperor and Emperor Ku by the Three Heavens. Later, journeying to Kuaiji, he further expounded and elucidated the mysterious text of the Numinous Treasure, compiling it into the *Writ of the Numinous Treasure*. One copy he concealed in the stone vaults of a renowned mountain, and another he entrusted to the water spirits, to be yielded only when a Dao-attained adept should present it to a true king.

I suspect this book must be the *Numinous Talisman and Supreme True Writ of the Most High*. Yet how it came to fall here, borne by a red crow—I cannot fathom.

The envoy knelt and acknowledged: "In truth, it is as the Master has said."

Zilu, standing at Confucius’ side, said: "To be sent on the lord’s mission yet betray his command is no loyal minister. To enter a state and deceive its officials, to receive a charge and falsify its words—this is no worthy envoy. That man is cunning; let me punish him."

Confucius replied: "To lift one’s robes and obscure the great sun, to raise one’s hand and block the bright day—can the yang radiance be veiled? Can the sun and moon be hidden? These two omens are but strange obstructions—why condemn their concealment as evil? Where illumination reaches, no harm is done. Do not strike at him."

Then Confucius addressed the envoy: "This is the numinous essence of the celestial offices, a work compiled by the great sages. Above, it expounds the qi of Grand Harmony and yin-yang; below, it discourses on the convergence of the Dao’s transformations and the nurturance of life. Only immortals can employ its text; kings cannot attain its arts. If one were to ascend to the distant and obscure, seeking the natural far away, evading the snares of entanglement in nonaction, and opening the strife of contention in the depths of mountains and secluded dwellings—then, perhaps, I might reveal to the king the marvelous subtleties of the numinous writ and the profound words of the Most High."

Thereupon he returned the book to the envoy, unopened.

The envoy departed and recounted Confucius’ words in full. Helü, grieving his own shallowness, sighed in despair and abandoned all hope, no longer seeking further interpretation. He stored the writ in a divine casket, treasuring its numinous text in secrecy. Yet one quiet morning, when he himself went to inspect it, the seal remained unbroken, but the book had vanished.

Fuchai later obtained it at Mount Lao, only to meet with destruction and ruin. Helü sought it in Dongting, and soon fell to Goujian’s conquest. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the children’s song Confucius had recited—the omen of the kingdom’s downfall at its gates.

For those who seize the divine writ without proper transmission, few escape calamity. And those who pass on the celestial book without attunement to the Dao shall not avoid punishment in the Dark Capital.

Hua Ziqiu, a native of Jiujiang, was devoted to the Way of immortals from his youth. He entered the mountains to conceal his traces, gathering and consuming herbs, dwelling among the forests and hills for over twenty years. One day, he encountered Master Luli, who bestowed upon him the *Divine Concealment and Numinous Treasure Methods*: first, the *Hidden River Chart Talisman*; second, the *Flying Turtle of Yi and Luo*; and third, the *Balance of Equilibrium*. Upon verifying and practicing them, he grew younger with each passing day, his complexion like that of a maiden. In a single day, he could travel five hundred *li* and lift a thousand *jin*; in a year, he shed his skin ten times. He then entered Mount Qian, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

The *Scripture of Absorbing the Qi of the Five Directions and All Heavens*:
Hua Ziqiu received the oral instructions of Master Luli, and Le Zichang’s writings revealed the names of the spirits.

**The Azure Tooth Heaven of the Nine Qi of the East**—its qi like mist rising as spring grass first sprouts, its radiance like the sun’s first glow at dawn. Below lies the Abyss of Morning Blossoms; above, the Palace of Flowing Splendor. Within its chambers dwell the Jade-Maiden of the Azure Waist; in its halls, the True King of the Supreme. The Jade-Maiden rides the beast of the Nine Mountains; the True King drives a nine-light divine dragon. Above, they guide the qi of the Nine Heavens; below, they draw the fragrant streams of the Nine Springs. They nurture the Two Modes to endure, safeguard Yin and Yang to flow unimpeded. Heaven bestows primordial essence upon the Great Ultimate; Earth preserves the mountains and hills under Goumang. Spirits move in emptiness upon the Terrace of Stillness; humans cultivate the Five Viscera at the edge of their lips. Thus, those who cultivate it know no bounds; those who preserve it never perish. Thereby, they reverse the myriad kalpas to renew, casting off decay to return to youth. Then, like the roc soaring to the nine distances, they ascend the Dark Cavern, gazing upward to seek the numinous halls of the Supreme Perfected, joining the immortals as their kin. Great is the *Azure Tooth Numinous Treasure*—long life arises from the merit of the Nine Qi.

**The Vermilion Cinnabar Heaven of the Three Qi of the South**—its qi like crimson clouds veiling the white sun, its radiance like dark jade reflecting a flowing abyss. Below lies the Crimson Spring’s deep pool; above, the Vermilion Palace of Longevity. Within its chambers dwells the Jade-Maiden of Great Cinnabar, residing upon the Three Mountains of the Grand Yang. In its halls sits the Venerable One of Primordial Qi, riding a three-horned unicorn. Above, he guides the numinous transformations of the Supreme Clarity and Primordial Mystery; below, he harmonizes the Three Qi in the kiln of creation, ensuring the eternal endurance of the myriad things. He circulates celestial essence in the southern summer, nurturing human essence at the cinnabar lips. Thus, those who refine it never end; those who cultivate it endure forever. Thereby, they cast off withered age to return to infancy, restore decay to flourishing abundance, dispel autumn frost’s falling leaves, and revive radiant splendor for ten thousand springs. Then, like the dragon gazing into the void and the simurgh soaring amid clouds, they suddenly release the heart and clear the mind, free from the dust of worldly attachments. Great is the *Vermilion Cinnabar Numinous Treasure*—immortality arises from the merit of the Three Qi.

**The Central Mountain of the Great Emperor of the Primordial Cavern**—above, yellow qi rises; below, it governs the Gate of Earth. Its qi, like clouds, steams straight through the Nine Heavens; primordial essence flows back and forth, its qi straight as a bowstring. Above, it connects to the Supreme and Boundless; below, it generates divine spirits. Its radiance is like flying light weaving through the morning sun; its brilliance like the bright moon illuminating a secluded city. Within lies the Nine-Windowed Gate of the Dark Breast; without, the Abyss of Sweet Springs and Jade Nectar. The Perfected One is named Zidan; in heaven, he is called the Jade Maiden of the Yellow Court, the Heavenly Granary of Wu and Ji. He presides over the Palace of Nurturing Life, known as the Great Emperor. He governs the Perfected of the Nine Heavens, riding the chariot of Earth’s axis, accompanied by the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits. He rewards the merits of the Dao, punishes demonic essences, above guiding the harmony of spontaneity, below extending to the numinous spirits of the Five Lands. Heaven and Earth are preserved without loss; Yin and Yang are balanced without tilting. Heaven’s qi is gentle and boundless; humans rinse their lips and teeth to prevent decay. Thereby, they resist the sun of Yu Yuan, restore the first light of dawn, reverse the withered old man’s decline, and transform extinction into purity. Their luminous countenance shines anew; their spirit and qi overflow with abundance. Then, like the dragon pacing the eight realms, they ascend the cloud paths, surpassing the multitudes with a glance, drawing in heavenly qi to sustain themselves. They befriend the Perfected Immortals in the Grand Tenuity, following the Three Luminaries to announce the dusk. Great is the *Yellow Court Numinous Treasure*—immortality arises from the solidity of the One Qi.

**The Bright Stone Heaven of the Seven Qi of the West**—its qi like the bright moon descending upon rosy clouds, its radiance like beholding a luminous pearl in the deep night. White dragons hold magic mushrooms in their jaws to ascend; divine immortals descend with pure nectar to moisten and nourish. This is the numinous essence of the Seven Heavens, the celestial sustenance of the Supreme Perfected—its qi sweet and harmonious, subtle and wondrous, surpassing even the finest alchemical elixirs. Below lies the Long River of Jade Springs; above, the towering mansions of Flowing Splendor. Within its chambers dwell the Supreme Jade-Maidens of Purity; in its halls, the Great Man of Primordial Qi. They ride fierce tigers of collapsing mountains, driving cloud chariots through the void. Above, they guide the vast essence of the Seven Heavens; below, they harmonize all beings in the cloud thoroughfares. They embrace cloud dew upon white mushrooms, drink divine liquid from dragon’s whiskers, strike the Heavenly Pool to sound the drum, and gather sweet essence upon their tongues. Thus, those who preserve it never fall; those who practice it dwell forever. Thereby, they reverse white hair to dark, restore decay to infancy. Then, like the phoenix dancing in the Milky Way, they chant clear and empty hymns, resting upon cloud peaks to refine the spirit, nurturing essence and harmony in the Great Beginning. They befriend the Perfected Ones, heedless of honor or disgrace. Great is the *Bright Stone Numinous Treasure*—immortality arises from the joy of the Seven Qi.

**The Dark Moisture Heaven of the Five Qi of the North**—its qi like whirlwinds stirring in fiery forests, its radiance like meteors plunging into vast waves. Jade syrup is simmered in dragon cauldrons; dark qi is drawn from the Heavenly Lake. Below lies the Abyss of Longevity; within, the home of the Supreme. In its chambers dwell the Night-Glow Jade-Maidens, clad in emerald silk of cloud groves, riding divine dragons to reveal the Perfected, driving deer chariots upon the Heavenly River. Above, they guide the flowing qi of the Five Constants; below, they rescue the multitudes of living beings. They harmonize and protect the Two Modes without tilting, safeguarding all lives for eternal ages. Heaven bestows primordial essence upon the Supreme Mystery; the Perfected nurture the Three Palaces at the teeth and jaws. Thus, those who preserve it never perish; those who cultivate it endure forever. Thereby, they cast off withered age to return to youth, restore decay to flourishing vitality. Then, like the dragon gazing into the void, they soar amid the clouds, suddenly freeing the heart and releasing worldly cares. Great is the *Dark Moisture Numinous Treasure*—immortality arises from the merit of the Five Qi.

Thus, those who enact it endure forever; those who employ it enjoy long life. They rinse the divine fluid in the primal head, merging with the pure qi without dissipation. Thereupon, they turn back the westward-sinking yang radiance, returning the vast sun to the eastern heights, dispelling the withered and desiccated to their final breath, and reversing decay to ascend once more in youthful vigor.

Then, with the resonant drum of the cloud pool, the pent-up qi surges forth in dragon-like ascent. They befriend the Perfected to discourse on affinity, ascending high with the numinous immortals—so vast is their virtue that none can surpass it. Great is the *Numinous Treasure Dark Moisture*—immortality arises from the flourishing of the Five Qi.

**The Numinous Treasure Five Thearchs’ Official Generals**
These titles were compiled by Yu of Xia from celestial script, revealed on the southern slopes of Mount Kuaiji. They are as follows:

The **Eastern Thearch, Spirit Awe-Loft**, styled the Azure Thearch. His spirit governs *jia-yi*, his raiment favors azure, he rides a green dragon, and bears a cyan banner. His qi is Wood, his star is Jupiter. He commands a host of ninety myriad spirits, harmonizing the spring qi above and engendering the ten thousand things below.

**Essential Instructions of the Numinous Treasure**
Transmitted by the Immortal of Huolin to Le Zichang, concealed on the northern slopes of Mount Laoshen.

When Daoists enter the mountains to gather herbs, they must collect the Eight Stone Numinous Fungi to concoct the elixir, and conceal themselves in the forest crags to repel all spirits. Those without the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans will find divine medicines sinking into concealment, the Eight Stones vanishing in form, the radiance of fungal blossoms hidden, their studies unfulfilled. Malevolent qi will test and assail them, ghosts and demons will stir in alarm.

When encountering the specters of *wangliang*, point the talisman at them, and they will dissolve of themselves. If mountain spirits seek to intimidate, they too will be shattered and broken. Against the thousand transformations and myriad shifts, the talisman holds absolute dominion.

Daoists must not recklessly practice heterodox ways—such methods should be shunned. Your caution is most thorough.

Those who uphold the Great Method will immediately summon and command the host of spirits, gather and call forth the ten thousand numina, sever and destroy baleful demons. Wearing the Five Scripts at the elbow, they summon the transcendents and perfected from the Nine Empyreans, conceal the Numinous Treasure in the Five Directions, and—unless bound by covenant—remain forever secluded. This is the arcane teaching of the Supreme Thearch, hidden by Yu the Great in the eastern wilds. Sworn to be revealed but once in ten thousand kalpas, only then may one behold the celestial writ that never fades.

To seal the mouth is to manifest blessings in clarity; to leak secrets is to invite calamity and decapitation. Thus, even Di Ku’s closest kin were not entrusted with the clamor of Yao’s son.

**The Five Beginnings Method of the Grand Purity**
To practice the Way of the East: Wood governs the liver, with the heart as its chief minister. Regularly enter the quiet chamber at *Lichun* and the spring equinox, facing outward in repose. With eyes closed, inwardly visualize the liver’s qi as true azure, attended by a vermilion spirit and nurtured by yellow qi. Align the body with true azure, ascending to commune with Heaven. The primordial qi of the Grand Purity descends into the body, where Gou Mang arrives, presided over by Lord Lao.

When rulers practice this, qilin appear, soaring phoenixes take flight, and the ten thousand things flourish in luxuriance. Jupiter follows its proper course, essence permeates the Grand Tenuity, the southern barbarians submit, and numinous portents arrive. The East embodies benevolence: Wood is sovereign, Fire is minister, Earth is dead, Metal is imprisoned, Water is at rest. When the imprisoned and dead arise, one should raise a son to avenge the father.

To practice the Way of the South: Fire governs the heart, with the spleen as its chief minister. Regularly enter the quiet chamber at *Lixia* and the summer solstice, facing in repose. With eyes closed, inwardly visualize the heart’s qi as true crimson, like the sun, attended by a yellow spirit and nurtured by white qi. Align the body with true crimson, ascending to commune with Heaven. The primordial qi of the Grand Purity descends into the body, where Zhu Rong arrives, presided over by the Grand Unity.

When rulers practice this, phoenixes soar, sweet dew descends, balmy winds fan the land, and the ten thousand things grow and thrive. Heaven suspends auspicious stars, Mars follows its constant path, *shapu* grasses sprout, fine grains ripen, the western barbarians submit, and the Central Kingdom prospers. The South embodies propriety: Fire is sovereign, Earth is minister, Metal is dead, Water is imprisoned, Wood is at rest. When the imprisoned and dead arise, one should raise a son to avenge the father.

To practice the Way of the West: Metal governs the lungs, with the kidneys as its chief minister. Regularly enter the quiet chamber at *Liqiu* and the autumn equinox, facing in repose. With eyes closed, inwardly visualize the lungs’ qi as true white, attended by a black spirit and nurtured by azure qi. Align the body with true white, ascending to commune with Heaven. The primordial qi of the Grand Purity descends into the body, where Ru Shou arrives, presided over by the Grand Harmony.

When rulers practice this, the White Tiger appears in benevolence, baleful influences are suppressed, poisons conceal their forms, crisp winds and fresh rains arrive, the five grains ripen, the myriad affairs fall into order, the Jade Balance levels, celestial horses descend, Venus follows its path, the eastern barbarians submit, and simurghs alight. The West embodies righteousness: Metal is sovereign, Water is minister, Wood is dead, Fire is imprisoned, Earth is at rest. When the imprisoned and dead arise, one should raise a son to avenge the father.

To practice the Way of the North: Water governs the kidneys, with the liver as its chief minister. Regularly enter the quiet chamber at *Lidong* and the winter solstice, facing in repose. With eyes closed, inwardly visualize the kidneys’ qi as true black, the primordial qi billowing like mountains exhaling clouds, floating and ascending to Heaven. Align the body to commune with Heaven. The primordial qi of the Grand Purity descends into the body, filling it with warmth, nurtured by crimson qi and the five colors of dark yellow. Xuan Ming arrives, presided over by the Lord of the Dao.

When rulers practice this, the ten thousand mechanisms attain harmony, the celestial writ never fades, and the northern barbarians submit. The North embodies wisdom: Water is sovereign, Wood is minister, Fire is dead, Earth is imprisoned, Metal is at rest. When the imprisoned and dead arise, one should raise a son to avenge the father.

When rulers practice this, the ten thousand waters flow unimpeded, the divine tortoise bears fresh patterns, governing winds still the rains, and the myriad things close and store away, resting and nurturing in the Yellow Springs. Do not recklessly cut short or harm them. The Morning Star moves in accord with its measure, the literary luminaries never cease, the southern barbarians submit, and black cinnabar emerges.

The North embodies wisdom: Water is sovereign, Wood is minister, Fire is dead, Earth is imprisoned, Metal is at rest. When the imprisoned and dead arise, one should raise a son to avenge the father.

To practice the Way of the Central Palace of *Wu* and *Ji*, the Spleen-Earth is sovereign, the Lungs are chief minister. On the day when Earth reigns in the sixth month, enter the quiet chamber, sit facing due south, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the spirit. Within, contemplate the spleen’s qi as true yellow, attended by white qi and nurtured by black qi, the body suffused with true yellow, ascending to commune with Heaven. The primordial qi of the Grand Purity descends into the body, a pure yellow like a chicken’s egg, serene and without action, so the myriad things govern themselves. *Yuqiang* arrives, presided over by the Lord of the Dao.

When rulers practice this, the eight directions are transformed, the hundred spirits all attend, the earth yields sweet springs, Heaven hangs auspicious stars, the yellow dragon appears and ascends, essence-mushrooms flourish, *Weixi* is born, sweet dew descends, crops ripen, the four barbarians submit, and the world attains great peace.

The Central Palace of *Wu* and *Ji* embodies trust: Earth is sovereign, Metal is minister, Water is dead, Wood is imprisoned, Fire is at rest. When the imprisoned and dead arise, one should raise a son to avenge the father.

**The Way of Ingesting the Essence of the Sun and Moon**

To ingest the sun’s essence is to attain longevity. Regularly on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days of the lunar month, at sunrise, face the sun with hair unbound, close the eyes, and visualize within the heart a small youth clad in crimson robes, resplendent with five-colored radiance, a true red. Rub the hands over the face, descending to the heart, repeating this twelve times. The sun’s essence, a true red-yellow qi, appears before the eyes, enters the mouth, and is swallowed thirty-six times, guided downward with the hands. Recite the incantation:

*"Sun Lord, Primordial Yang, unite your virtue with mine, together nurturing the small youth within the Crimson Palace."*

After a moment, guide the visualization down to the Cinnabar Field, where it remains, granting long life.

To ingest the moon’s essence is to nourish the root of the kidneys, restoring white hair to black. Regularly at midnight, visualize white qi within the kidneys circulating throughout the body, ascending to the brain’s gate and descending to the soles of the feet. This is the natural Way—easy to attain, difficult to practice.

Regularly on the fifteenth day of the lunar month, face the moon and recite the incantation:

*"Moon Lord, Primordial Yin, unite your virtue with mine, together nurturing the small youth within the Cinnabar Field."*

Then close the eyes and inwardly visualize the moon’s white-yellow essence appearing before the eyes, entering the mouth, and being swallowed twenty-one times, guided downward with the hands until it rests in the Cinnabar Field.

The Central Yellow Lord of the Dao says: Heaven gives birth to the myriad things, and humans are the most noble. The human body encompasses Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the Northern Dipper, the jade armillary sphere, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, mountains and rivers, seas and streams, the Wind Earl and Rain Master, the spirit stars and altars of soil and grain, the qilin and phoenix, the dragon and tiger, the Dark Warrior, the five grains and hemp, the six livestock—oxen and horses—birds and beasts, fish and soft-shelled turtles, tortoises and alligators, bamboo and trees, the hundred grasses—nothing it does not model.

Thus, the Son of Heaven is established, with the Three Dukes, Nine Ministers, Twenty-Seven Grand Masters, and Eighty-One Principal Officers. The nine provinces are divided into one hundred twenty commanderies, one thousand two hundred counties, eighteen thousand townships, thirty-six thousand wards, and one hundred eighty thousand outposts. There are palaces and residences, gates and doors, wells and hearths, cauldrons and steamers, rice and millet—all the spirits that may be nourished. When humans understand this, they may attain long life.

The human head is round, modeling Heaven; the feet are square, modeling Earth. The hair is the stars, the eyes are the sun and moon, the brows are the Northern Dipper, the ears are the altars of soil and grain, the nose is the hills and mountains, the mouth is the rivers and streams, the teeth are jade and stone, the four limbs are the four seasons. The five viscera model the Five Phases, the Five Thearchs, the Five Offices, the Five Stars above, the Five Peaks below, the Five Kings within, the Five Virtues without, ascending as the Five Clouds, transforming into the Five Dragons.

The five viscera are the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The six bowels are: the gallbladder as the liver’s bowel, the stomach as the spleen’s bowel, the large intestine as the lung’s bowel, the small intestine as the heart’s bowel, the bladder as the kidney’s bowel, and the navel as the capital’s bowel.

The gallbladder is the Celestial Thearch, the Great Lord of the Dao; the spleen is the Empress, the Noble Lady; the heart is the Grand Commandant; the left kidney is the Minister of Education; the right kidney is the Minister of Works. The eight trigrams’ spirits, together with the Great One of the navel, form the Nine Ministers. The twelve encircling tower spirits, the twelve Remonstrating Gentlemen within the spleen, and the three *jiao* spirits together form the Twenty-Seven Grand Masters. The spirits of the four limbs are the Eighty-One Principal Officers. The upper primordial qi is the Crowned Envoy; the lower primordial qi is the Grand Herald.

The upper body has nine transformations, the middle body has nine orifices, the lower body has nine names—modeling the nine provinces. The Three Dukes’ offices, the Nine Ministers’ offices, the Twenty-Seven Grand Masters’ offices, and the Eighty-One Principal Officers’ offices together form one hundred twenty offices. Within the offices are the Five Offices; without are the Five Directors, together forming the Ten Directors, modeling the one thousand two hundred counties. The central spirits, eighteen thousand in number, model the eighteen thousand townships. The upper spirits, thirty-six thousand in number, model the thirty-six thousand wards. Each ward has five outposts, modeling the one hundred eighty thousand outposts.

Moreover, the lungs are the Jade Hall Palace and the Ministry of Works; the heart is the Crimson Palace and the Palace of Primordial Yang; the liver is the Azure Yang Palace and the Orchid Terrace; the gallbladder is the Purple Tenuity Palace and the Limitless Palace; the spleen is the Central Palace and the Palace of Grand Simplicity; the kidneys are the Dark Prosperity Palace and the Palace of Grand Harmony.

If one desires the Dao, to attain long life and avoid death, one must first visualize the spirits, nurture their roots, circulate their qi, and invoke their names. The spirits of the hair are seven in number, named *Xunchang*. The spirits of the nape are three in number, the Eastern King Father.

Within the brain’s gate resides the Southern Culmen Lord, styled *Yuanxian*. Between the brows dwells the Heavenly Numinous Lord. The two ears each house four spirits, styled *Jiaonü*. The two eyes each contain six spirits, styled *Yingming*. The spirit within the nose is styled *Tonglu*. The spirit of the mouth is styled *Danzhu*. The spirit of the tongue is styled *Danhuang*. The spirits of the teeth number thirty-six, styled *Weishi*. The spirit within the throat is styled *Huben*. The spirits of the two eyebrows are styled *Jueshen*. The spirits of the two hands are styled *Poyin*. The spirit of the lungs is styled *Honghong*. The spirit of the heart is styled *Xuxu*. The spirit of the liver is styled *Linlin*. The spirit of the gallbladder is styled *Huohuo*. The spirit of the stomach is styled *Juju*. The spirit of the spleen is styled *Pipi*. The spirits of the two kidneys are styled *Piaopiao*. The spirit within the navel is styled *Yulingzi*. The spirit of the Cinnabar Field is styled *Cangjing*. The spirit of the large intestine is styled *Dundun*. The spirit of the small intestine is styled *Liangliang*. The spirit of the yin is styled *Qiongying*. The spirit of a woman is styled *Danjing*. The spirits of the two limbs are styled *Yinyin*. The spirits of the two knees are styled *Ougong*. The spirits of the two shanks are styled *Suikongzi*. The spirits of the two feet are styled *Zhutian Lishi*.

When you close your eyes to sleep, call out to them three times from the top downward, and then cease. If any part of the body suffers pain, wherever the pain is, call out the name of the spirit there nine times, and bid it heal the affliction. Lie flat, close your eyes, visualize the spirit, and the ailment will immediately be cured. On the evenings of the full moon, new moon, equinoxes, and solstices, visualize the spirits within, summon and call out the names of the spirits upon the body, and command them to restrain the hun and po.

The Perfected One says: If you desire to ascend as an immortal, you must summon the spirits of the body. The Central Yellow Elder Lord says: Once you know the names of the spirits dwelling within the body, you should also know the abode of the Heavenly and Earthly Parents and the Red Child, the Perfected Ones of the Five Cities and Twelve Towers. These are concealed within the Grand Clarity’s Palace of Mysterious Harmony and the Towering Clouds Observatory. Those without immortal records shall not behold these writings. The Master of Luli transmitted the oral instructions to Hua Ziq.

If you wish to know the Heavenly and Earthly Parents and the Red Child, they are the Three Ones. The Heavenly One resides beneath the Canopy of Flowers; the Human One, within the Dipper’s Gate; the Earthly One, where the sun and moon wander. The Three Ones gleam like radiant pearls. If you do not guard them, what else is there to seek in life? Moreover, the Earthly One wanders where the sun and moon roam; the Human One dwells within the Dipper’s Gate; the Heavenly One resides beneath the Canopy of Flowers. The primordial qi flutters and draws them together.

The divine tortoise lies within the Central Upright, slightly askew. If you wish to attain it, you must ask me. Where the One abides, there it rests. Do not merely guard the male but also the female. The One, formless, is most difficult to know. If you do not know the One, all affairs will fail. It is as large as a chicken’s yolk, its color like a sweet orange. When it emerges, it is half; when it enters, it is whole. If you can guard it, all affairs will be accomplished.

The Three Ones are the three palaces of the body: the head, the heart, and the navel. Once you know the abode of the Heavenly and Earthly Parents and the Red Child, the Perfected Ones of the Five Cities and Twelve Towers, you must also know how to ingest the divine elixir, golden liquor, the flowing pearl of the Great Yang, and the Great One. Only then will you become a person of the Three Heavenly Palaces. If you do not ingest these Three Primes, your efforts will be in vain.

First, visualize the Five Beasts: the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, and the Dark Warrior—with the Yellow Qilin at the center. These Five Beasts may suddenly transform into mountain forests. Beyond the forests in the four directions stand celestial warriors, tiger guards, and feathered forest officials, eight to each side. Visualize them as vast or narrow as you wish, and you may conceal ten thousand men.

Second, summon the spirits within the body, from head to foot. Visualize the spirits, nurture their roots, circulate their qi, and call out their names. Only then will you attain long life and become a divine immortal.

Third, guard the Earthly One, called the Cinnabar Field. It is luminous white like clouds, its five colors dark and yellow, the dwelling of the Mother of the Dao, within the watery womb.

Fourth, guard the Human One, called the Crimson Palace. Here resides the Southern Culmen Great One, the Red Child, the youth. The moon is to the right, the sun to the left, and the hun and po unite.

Fifth, guard the Heavenly One, called the Purple Palace. It is as large as a mixed chicken’s egg, its nine colors dark and yellow, interwoven with the stars and constellations, the warp and weft of the body.

Sixth, ingest the divine elixir, the essence of the Great Yang. Always begin on the first, seventh, fifteenth, twenty-third, or thirtieth day of the lunar month, or on the half-months of the ninth month, the *jiazi* or *bingwu* days. Enter your chamber, close your eyes, and visualize the red essence of the sun descending into your mouth. Swallow it eighty-one times.

The Perfected One says: Ingesting the essence of the sun inclines you toward Heaven and Earth.

Seventh, ingest the golden liquor, the essence of the mysterious water. Always on the fifteenth day of the lunar month, at midnight, enter your chamber, close your eyes, and visualize the pure white essence of the moon descending into your mouth. Swallow it forty-nine times.

The Perfected One says: Ingesting the essence of the moon is the reason for long life.

Eighth, ingest the descending qi of the mysterious stars, blue-white and cinnabar-yellow. Always at the first watch of the night when stars appear, enter your chamber, close your eyes, and in spring, visualize the blue essence of Jupiter descending into your mouth. Swallow it ninety times. In summer, visualize the red essence of Mars descending into your mouth. Swallow it thirty times. In autumn, visualize the white essence of Venus descending into your mouth. Swallow it seventy times. In winter, visualize the black essence of Mercury descending into your mouth. Swallow it fifty times. On the second day of each of the four seasonal months, visualize the yellow essence of Saturn descending into your mouth. Swallow it twelve times. The four seasonal months are the twelfth, third, sixth, and ninth months. Perform this on the second day of the month, inwardly visualize with focused mind, and you will naturally see the qi.

The Perfected One says: Ingesting the qi of the stars aligns you with Heaven.

Ninth, perform the Great Ultimate’s purple clouds filling the sky, ascending and descending, naturally merging and parting. On the days of the eight solar terms, enter your chamber, close your eyes, and inwardly visualize the purple qi from the Muddy Pellet ascending to Heaven, the red qi from the Crimson Palace ascending to Heaven, and the yellow qi from the Cinnabar Field ascending to Heaven.

In an instant, three celestial youths descend from Heaven. The first youth, clad in purple robes, is called the Brain-Protecting Perfected One; he descends directly from the purple qi and enters the Muddy Pellet Palace, the purple qi following him back to the Gate of the Brain. The second youth, clad in crimson robes, is called the Heart-Protecting Crimson Child; he descends directly from the red qi and enters the Crimson Palace, the red qi following him back to the Heart Center. The third youth, clad in yellow robes, is called the Spirit-Protecting Hidden One; he descends directly from the yellow qi and enters the Cinnabar Field, the yellow qi following him back to the Gate of the Navel. These three celestial youths replenish qi and dispel evil, refine and harmonize blood and qi, command the hun-soul and pacify the po-soul, stabilize the mind and fill the meridians, causing radiance to flow freely and the reservoir of fluids to be replenished. After a long while, the body feels serene and content, tranquil and replete—this is the power of the three celestial youths guarding the body. When the visualization is intensely focused and the three palaces are full and their gates open, the three celestial youths suddenly fly back to Heaven, and the gates close once more.

The Perfected One says: If you wish never to forget, carefully summon the Heavenly Youths. The Heavenly Youths descend, riding emptiness as their steed, to guard your body’s spirits—thus one attains immortality. If you do not visualize the spirits, the corpse and po-soul will speak. This Way has nine practices; those who cultivate them attain longevity. The Perfected One of Bell Mountain transmitted this to Yu, who thereby preserved harmony with Heaven and ascended to the Mysterious Mansion. In summer, Yu received from the Perfected One of Bell Mountain the method of ingesting the essences of the sun, moon, and stars, which he concealed in the wilds of Dongting.

To ingest the essence of the sun is to surely attain long life, thereby ascending to Heaven to pay homage to the Primordial Ancestor. Always on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days of the month, from sunrise to midday, first visualize the sun, then focus on the sun within your mind. Within the sun is a mysterious canopy, and beneath the canopy stands a small youth, perfectly crimson, his red qi suffusing nine layers within and without the body. Visualize the qi filling your head, then emerging from the crown and ascending to Heaven, circling the sun nine times. Recite the incantation: *"Sun Sovereign, Primordial Yang, return to the Crimson Palace. Unite your virtue with mine, together nurturing the small youth."* Then visualize the solar essence descending and entering your nostrils and mouth; swallow it twenty-seven times until it fills your heart. Within the heart are three figures: to the left is the Great One, the Father; to the right is the Mysterious Radiance, the Mother; and in the center is the Crimson Child. They sit upon a golden grove and jade couch, holding jade plates and jade cups. In the cups are divine wine of jade blossoms and celestial lingzhi grass, which they consume. Thus one neither hungers nor thirsts and attains long life.

To ingest the essence of the moon is to attain long life, thereby ascending to Heaven. Always on the night of the fifteenth day, at midnight, face the moon and bow twice. Recite the incantation: *"Moon Sovereign, Primordial Yin, return to the Cinnabar Field. Unite your virtue with mine, together nurturing the small youth."* Then visualize the moon’s white qi and yellow essence descending and entering your nostrils and mouth; swallow it twenty-one times and stop. The lunar essence anchors to the root of the kidneys—thus one attains long life.

To ingest the essence of the stars is to ascend to the Great Clarity. Always at sunrise, the evening meal hour, midday, and midnight, visualize the Supreme Star of the Northern Pole. Recite the incantation: *"August Heavenly Thearch, Supreme Dao Lord, your humble descendant, so-and-so, loves the Dao and wishes to attain long life."* Then visualize the stellar essence descending and resting between your eyebrows, flowing into your nostrils and mouth; swallow it fifteen times, and visualize the qi filling your heart, gallbladder, and spleen. Within the spleen dwells the Dao Mother, who nourishes the Crimson Child—thus one neither hungers nor attains long life.

**The Wondrous Scripture of the Five Talismans of the Supreme Mystery of the Numinous Treasure, Scroll the Middle**

**The Numinous Treasure’s Ingestion of the Essence of the Five Fungi**

The Venerable Lord said: The pine lives a thousand years; its resin congeals to commune with the spirits. Descending into the earth, it conceals its lineage and alters its name, forsaking its origin to grow vast. From its root it takes form, called *Weixi* (威僖), also known as *fuling* (茯苓). It repels weapons and submerges armies, emerging from the profound and entering the obscure. Neither hungering nor thirsting, it unites sun and moon. If one can ingest it, one attains long life.

The Venerable Lord said: The flea nourishes the body, restoring youthful complexion and reversing age. It is called *huma* (胡麻), originally growing in Dawan. Born ten thousand years ago, it came east across the passes, remaining in the Central Land to sever the Hu and barbarian tribes. It embodies the essence of water, dispelling wind and cold. Known also as *jusheng* (巨胜), it expels evil and treachery. Ingesting it without cease, one endures with the world.

*Jusheng* and *Weixi* form kinship, emerging from the Hu lands. They harmonize spirit and essence. If one can ingest them, one thus attains long life.

The Venerable Lord said: Pepper grows in Shu and Han, containing the *qi* of the Great Yin. Born with heaven and earth, it transforms and submerges. Thus it dispels dampness; evil dares not encroach. It devours demonic poisons, none it cannot restrain. If one can ingest it constantly, all desires are sated. This is the world’s arcane mystery, its Dao profound. Guard it firmly, do not reveal it—not for ten thousand gold.

The Venerable Lord said: Ginger grows in the Great Yang, sharing its homeland with pepper. Both emerge from fertile soil, nestled in the secluded mountains. Firm and unyielding, they rely on springs and water. Containing the *qi* of Mars, they guard the earth’s root, turning from yin toward yang, enduring with the world. Thus they dispel dampness, repel cold for warmth, expel evil and sever illness, sealing the demonic gate. If one can ingest them constantly, one’s lifespan matches heaven and earth.

The Venerable Lord said: Sweetflag grows in marshes, near deep pools. In low, damp places—by riverbanks and water’s edge—it also thrives on high mountains, rooting in stone. Nine nodes in an inch: this is called the numinous body. Obtaining even one, it contains the *qi* of ten thousand. Thus it revives people, preserves and nourishes the spirit, dispels water and dampness, suppresses demons and dissolves misfortune. Ghosts, specters, *wangliang*, and baleful spirits flee into dark obscurity; inauspicious omens dare not approach. Ingesting it without cease, one’s lifespan reaches a thousand thousand years.

Master Le Zichang said: These five substances may all be ingested singly. Together, they augment *qi*, preserve youth, extend essence, and stabilize the *po*. Ingesting them without cease, one endures with the world. Thus the *Xiao Jing Yuan Shen Qi* states: Ginger and pepper augment *qi*; sweetflag sharpens hearing; *jusheng* extends years; *Weixi* repels weapons. These are the secret words of Confucius, the luminous decree of the supreme sages.

The Venerable Lord observed heaven and composed the *Five Fungi Elixir*, a method to preserve spirit, sustain years, and endure with the world.

**Numinous Elixir of the Three Heavens Formula**
Recorded by Le Zichang.

**Fivefold Numinous Elixir Formula**

Five parts *jusheng*, four parts *Weixi*, one part Sichuan pepper, three parts dried ginger, and three parts sweetflag. Select only genuine, fresh, and fine specimens, meticulously preparing each. On a day of celestial dominance, have a male virgin grind the ingredients—do not change the person. Process each separately, sift finely, and pound each ten thousand times. Place each in a separate red cup, arranging all five upon a red table, exposed to the open air for one night. At dawn the next day, measure them with the sacred dipper and combine according to method. Blend with white honey or maltose, then pound again thirty thousand times, forming pills the size of parasol seeds. At dawn, face the sun and kneel to swallow three pills, declaring your wish for longevity. At dusk, as the sun sets, kneel facing west and swallow three more, following the dawn method as a regular practice. Avoid raw fish, pork, and Chinese chives; refrain from encountering funeral corpses, dogs, pigs, or childbirth filth. Be vigilant. This constitutes one dose.

Should the dose be exhausted and another prepared, calculate the proportions of the ingredients and combine them at will, ensuring the quantity suffices for a full year—this is most excellent for the practitioner. As for the pounding, increase the total by ten thousand strokes, making the combined pounding forty thousand in all. The celestial stems and earthly branches mark the path: *jiazi* initiates the cycle, *guihai* completes the count, with dawn and dusk as the appointed times. Take heed and never forget.

The sixty-one nodes are the constant of Heaven and Earth; follow the method in taking the pills. *Jia* and *gui* illuminate the way: from the *jiazi* day of establishment to the *guihai* day is one node. If *jiazi* lacks an establishment day, a full and fixed cycle will also suffice. Before taking the medicine, fast for three days, burn incense, and concentrate the spirit; only then proceed. After sixty days, the body feels light and able to walk; another sixty days, the four limbs become unobstructed; another sixty days, the complexion gains radiance; another sixty days, the abdomen and intestines harmonize, the five viscera grow firm, and malevolent influences cannot harm; another sixty days, the body becomes sturdy and strong; another sixty days, the ears and eyes grow wholly clear. These are the verifications of the first year.

After another sixty days, the bones and frame grow robust; another sixty days, the fingernails gleam; another sixty days, signs and portents become manifest; another sixty days, essence and *qi* flourish; another sixty days, white hair retreats; another sixty days, the teeth grow firm and hard. These are the verifications of the second year.

After another sixty days, virtue and the Dao attain thoroughfare; another sixty days, the Six *Jia* spirits follow; another sixty days, the spirit pervades the body; another sixty days, the will and faith move with the spirit; another sixty days, the heart opens and the eyes brighten; another sixty days, distant knowledge of the four directions arises. These are the verifications of the third year.

After another sixty days, the gaze shines with light; another sixty days, the five spirits do not depart; another sixty days, hunger and thirst are unknown; another sixty days, the hundred spirits come to pay homage; another sixty days, the five viscera never deplete; another sixty days, one endures both cold and heat. These are the verifications of the fourth year.

After another sixty days, one can float or sink; another sixty days, move shallow or deep; another sixty days, become round or square; another sixty days, grow weak or strong; another sixty days, extend or contract; another sixty days, shorten or lengthen. These are the verifications of the fifth year.

After another sixty days, one can be fair or foul; another sixty days, young or old; another sixty days, large or small; another sixty days, light or heavy; another sixty days, pass through barriers without hindrance; another sixty days, the traveling kitchen appears at one’s side, and one attains the rank of immortal. These are the verifications of the sixth year.

With unceasing practice, one aligns with Heaven, undergoes a thousand transformations, and ascends to the Great Clarity.

**Divine Treasure Grain-Winning Formula**
Transmitted by Immortal Huolin to Le Zichang, who concealed himself on the northern slopes of Mount Lao.

Grain-winner is also called sesame, *gou shi*, *moru*, "the lingering glory of the Three Luminaries," "the renewal of Heaven and Earth," *liuzhu*, "nine transformations," *youchang*, *hanyu*, and *qingxiang*. *Qingxiang* is the name of its leaf.

**Longevity-Extending Divine Formula**
Select fine sesame seeds, cleanse and remove impurities, steam them as in cooking, then dry in the sun. Repeat the steaming and drying nine times. Grind finely, sift, and form into pills with white honey, taking one the size of a chicken’s egg, three times daily. Another method states that if unable to form pills, take three *sheng* of the powdered medicine as a regular dose. After one year of practice, the complexion becomes beautiful and the body smooth and lustrous; after two years, white hair returns to black; after three years, fallen teeth regrow; after four years, one enters water without getting wet; after five years, one enters fire without burning; after six years, one can run as swiftly as a galloping horse. This medicine is sweet, fragrant, and delightful, easy to maintain and difficult to grow weary of. The formula is secret and rarely transmitted, passed down only once in a hundred years.

**Method for Consuming Sesame**
Take one *hu*, wash thoroughly, remove the black outer skin to reveal pure white, steam for one day, then dry in the sun. Grind or pound finely. Boil five *dou* of stones in a cauldron of water, then steam again, ensuring the cauldron retains a *shi*-worth of water. Place the sesame in a steamer, pour it into a wooden tray, and douse thoroughly with the stone-boiled water. Add one *dou* of finely ground wheat bran, mix, and ferment like sugar. Press out the dregs when done, then reduce the liquid by two-thirds over heat. Transfer to a copper vessel, float it in a cauldron of boiling water over a fierce fire, ensuring it does not cease boiling. Form into pills the size of a chicken’s egg. Taking three pills daily for a hundred days will replenish the flesh, turn the hair and temples black, and sharpen the ears and eyes. With prolonged practice, life knows no end.

**Sesame Paste**
Take one *dou* of sesame paste and three *jin* of scallion bulbs, simmer over a low fire until the scallions turn golden brown, then strain out the dregs. Take with wine, one *sheng* at midday. After a hundred days, the skin and flesh become full and flourishing; after two hundred days, the old grow young again; after three hundred days, one attains longevity. With prolonged practice, one becomes a divine immortal.

**Perfected One’s Grain-Abstention Formula**
Take two *dou* of grain-winner and five *sheng* of large pepper, remove the black skins, then pound and sift together. Initially take five *ge*, three times daily. Water infused with fermented grains may be used, or form into honey pills the size of a chicken’s egg, taking one four times daily. Gradually, hunger ceases. In times of famine, this medicine alone can replace grain. If thirsty, drink water only; consuming other foods will induce hunger. It multiplies strength a hundredfold, renders one immune to cold and heat, cures all illnesses, and naturally leads to immortality.

**Perfected One’s Grain-Abstention Method for Consuming Grain-Winner**
Take one *hu* of grain-winner, steam until the hot *qi* thoroughly permeates, then dry in the sun for one day. Repeat the steaming and drying nine times, requiring nine days in all.

When finished, pound and sift, then blend with white honey. Take pills the size of a chicken’s egg, three times daily. Over time, grain consumption naturally diminishes. After one hundred days of ingestion, all illnesses spontaneously heal, and water will not cling to the body. After one year, jade maidens attend as guardians.

For urgent use, steam and sun-dry three times daily, completing nine steams and nine dryings in three days before use. On overcast days, wait for the sun to emerge. For one *hu* of grain-winner, add three *jin* of *fuling* (Poria cocos), pound together, blend with honey, and ingest as above. The effects manifest more swiftly, replenishing essence and marrow, gradually eliminating hunger. Thirst may be quenched with water.

**Perfected One’s Light Grain Method for Abstaining from Coarse Food**
Take one *dou* and two *sheng* of grain-winner (pure black), twenty-four *liang* of *fuling*, and eight *liang* of *zexie* (Alisma). Process the three ingredients with ten thousand pestle strokes, then ingest pills the size of a bullet thrice daily. When food is available, eat; when not, consume any of the hundred foods without restriction.

**External Travel Method for Strengthening the Body**
Take five *sheng* of hemp seeds, soak in warm water until they split, then remove the skins. Combine the kernels with two *jin* of sheep fat and simmer over low heat until fully cooked, eating to satiety. Thirst may be quenched with water, and grains may be consumed freely. Prepare anew as before.

Hemp is the chief of the five grains, capable of discerning the myriad things and communing with divine luminaries. On the seventh day of the seventh month, take one *sheng* of hemp pollen and half a *jin* of true Shangdang ginseng, pound together, steam until *qi* emerges, and ingest one *daogui* (scant spoonful). No effect will fail to manifest.

**Discerning Chrysanthemum and *Yi* (Wild Chrysanthemum)**
Chrysanthemum flowers resemble *yi* flowers; distinguish them by taste—chrysanthemum is sweet, while *yi* is bitter. Chrysanthemums grow everywhere, though sparingly, often near water. In Goushi and Lixian, they are most abundant.

The Perfected One states: *Rijing* (Sun Essence), *Gengsheng* (Renewal), *Zhouying* (Fullness of Zhou), *Shenjing* (Divine Essence), and *Changsheng* (Longevity) are all one chrysanthemum, though their roots, stems, flowers, and seeds bear different names. The teachings are most refined, yet recent practitioners ingest them with little effect, precisely because they fail to obtain true chrysanthemum.

**Longevity-Extending Formula**
In spring, on the third month’s *jiayin* day, at noon, gather *Gengsheng* (the leaves). In summer, on the third month’s *bingyin* or *renzi* day, at noon, gather *Zhouying* (some texts say *Zhoucheng*). *Zhouying* is the chrysanthemum stem. In autumn, on the third month’s *gengyin* day, at the evening meal hour, gather *Rijing*. *Rijing* is the chrysanthemum flower. In winter, on the tenth month’s *wuyin* day, at dawn, gather *Shenjing*. *Shenjing* is also called *Shenhua* (Divine Flower) or *Shenying* (Divine Bloom)—the chrysanthemum seed. If no *wuyin* day is available, *renzi* may be used. In the eleventh or twelfth month, on *renyin* day at sunset, gather *Changsheng*. *Changsheng* is the chrysanthemum root. One text states: if no *renyin* day occurs in the eleventh month, *renzi* may be used.

Another text advises: combine all five ingredients, dry in the shade for one hundred days, then process two parts of each and sift. If the specified days for gathering are unavailable in any month, use *wuyin*, *wuzi*, *wuchen*, or *renzi* days instead.

In spring, add one part *Shenjing* and two parts *Gengsheng*; in summer, add three parts *Zhouying* and two parts *Gengsheng*; in autumn, add one part *Shenjing* and two parts *Rijing*; in winter, add three parts *Rijing*. Always compound on *zhicheng* days; never use *pori* or *weiri* days. One text states: do not adhere rigidly to days, lest the medicinal spirit fail to move. Pound in a secluded chamber, form pills with white pine resin, and take them the size of *wutong* seeds thrice daily after meals.

After one year of ingestion, all illnesses vanish, hearing sharpens, vision clarifies, the body lightens, *qi* increases, and lifespan extends by two years. After two years, the complexion glows, strength multiplies a hundredfold, white hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow, and lifespan extends by three years. After three years, one may traverse mountains without fear of serpents or dragons, avoid encounters with ghosts and spirits, evade blades and weapons, and cause birds to dare not fly nearby, extending lifespan by thirteen years. After four years, one gains communion with divine luminaries and the five phases, extending lifespan by forty years. After five years, the body emits radiance, the eyes shine day and night, light bridges barriers, joints become supple, and though wingless, one may fly at will. After six years, lifespan extends by three hundred years. After seven years, the Dao nears completion, extending lifespan by a thousand years. After eight years, one may see a thousand *li* and hear ten thousand *li*, extending lifespan by two thousand years. After nine years, the spirit is perfected, enabling transmutation of metal and stone, resurrection from death, and extending lifespan by three thousand years. A green dragon guards the left, a white tiger the right, and the chariot is wrought of gold.

Another text states: in spring, add two parts *Shenjing* and two parts *Gengsheng*; in summer, add one part *Shenjing* and two parts *Zhouying*; in autumn, add two parts *Rijing*; at the onset of winter, add two parts *Shenjing*; at the winter solstice, add one part *Shenjing* and two parts *Changsheng*. Swallow ten pills daily, five at dawn and five at dusk. One text states: in autumn, add one part *Shenjing* and two parts *Rijing*. Another text states: in spring, add two parts *Zhouying*.

**Method for Ingesting Apricot Seeds**
Take three *dou* of apricot seeds, discarding those with two kernels. Prepare boiling water, then immerse the apricots for a moment, rub to remove the skins, and process thoroughly. Place in a jar, strain the liquid, yielding seven or eight *dou* of juice. Discard the dregs, take a one-*shi* cauldron, place it over a fire of chaff or silkworm droppings, and rub four *jin* of sheep fat into the cauldron until fully absorbed. Heat again and rub in the fat until all four *jin* are exhausted. Pour the juice into the cauldron and simmer over the chaff or silkworm-dropping fire. After four or five days, the medicine is ready, its color like gold, resembling an infant’s chewed food.

Take a portion the size of a chicken’s yolk, thrice daily. After a hundred days of ingestion, even one’s parents will fail to recognize them, and their complexion will become radiant. The mother of Xia Zhengshu consumed this and lived seven hundred years before ascending as an immortal—this is a divine formula, to be kept secret.

**The Formula Bestowed upon Yu the Great by the Perfected One**
Recorded in the writings of Le Zichang, concealed on the northern slopes of Mount Lao.

**Red Arrow (赤箭)**
Also called *Limu* (离母), *Guidu You* (鬼督邮), *Divine Herb* (神草), *Solitary Sway* (独摇), *Dangku* (当苦), *Victory Child* (胜子), or *Ghost Arrow* (鬼箭).
It grows in Chen Cang, Mount Shaoshi, the Yaoliu Mountains of Shangluo, the southern slopes of Mount Tai, or the southern faces of renowned mountains, as well as in the streams and ravines of Nanyang or the shady recesses of valleys. A single stem bears nodes and leaves, its tips resembling bamboo leaves, unmoved even by wind. Harvest in the third month, taking the entire root without discarding any part. Pound and press to extract the juice, then set it in a vessel. Dry the dregs in the sun, then reintroduce the juice and dry again. Process and ingest a *fangcun* spoonful after meals to prevent aging. Effects manifest in ten days; after thirty, *qi* surges abundantly; after a hundred, the body lightens, hearing and vision sharpen, and within a year, teeth and hair regenerate. Its stem is red, like a bow and arrow, and its root resembles a human foot with toes but no nails. Its seeds resemble small lambs.

Another account states: the root resembles a taro corm, its seeds like taro kernels, growing beside it without attachment—often more than ten. In the morning, they lie west of the mother; by evening, east; at midday, beneath. Gather them all. At the center is a "king," as thick as a finger, with smaller ones like rings—twelve in total, three on each side, serving as its guards. To harvest, first purify oneself for a hundred days, then offer wine and dried meat to the mother. Under sunlight, gather the seeds, wrap them in a vermilion pouch, and keep it beneath the left armpit. The king is called *Six Jia Parents*, capable of concealing five hundred guards; its children can conceal one. If the mother plant dies in a household where childbirth occurs, the medicinal spirit departs.

Another account states: its leaves are as thick as a thumb, with four red "feathers" extending above and below. It grows year-round, and can be harvested at any time. It governs malevolent ghosts, spectral entities, *gu* toxins, pernicious *qi*, alternating chills and fevers, abscesses, and swelling. It invigorates *yin*, augments *qi*, strengthens the body, and lightens the frame. Prolonged use extends lifespan. Its flavor is bitter.

**Pokeweed Root (章陆根)**
Acrid and toxic, it dispels pathogenic *qi* from the chest, reduces swelling when applied topically, eliminates spectral entities, refines the five viscera, and disperses water *qi*. Roots resembling human forms are imbued with spirit. Harvest from abandoned ruins or fields in the third and eighth months.

**Pokeweed (章陆草)**
Also called *Yehu* (夜呼), *Danggen* (荡根), *Danglu* (当陆), *Xianlu* (苋陆), *Longgen* (长根), *Shanglu Grass* (商陆草), *Divine Reed* (神陆), *White Blossom* (白华), *Dispel Evil* (逐邪), *Heavenly Herb* (天草), or *Expeller of Yin Spirits* (逐阴之精). This is a divine herb.
It expels the Three Worms, slays dormant corpses, treats facial darkening, enhances intelligence, prevents forgetfulness, and cures the Five Taxations, Seven Injuries, women’s postpartum ailments, and red-and-white vaginal discharge. The formula: ten *jin* of pokeweed, three *dou* of rice, and one *dou* of processed *tianmen dong* powder. Soak the pokeweed for six days, then consume while fasting. After five days, hunger vanishes; after twenty, the intestines grow plump, the countenance becomes refined, the breath sweet, all worms depart, hearing and vision sharpen, and scars fade. On days when the moon lodges with ghosts, at the *ding* hour, harvest *shanglu* and ingest a portion the size of a jujube, thrice daily. Daoists cultivate this herb in the gardens of secluded chambers to commune with spirits. It prevents aging, bestows longevity, expels the Three Worms, and cures all poisons, rendering them harmless.

**Formula for Longevity, Expelling the Three Corpses, and Reversing Gray Hair**
One should ingest the mother of *Dan Guang* (丹光) and consume the marrow of *Floating Water* (浮水)—these arise naturally. After a thousand years, they transform; after a hundred, they transmute. First transformation, then transmutation: Heaven can no longer harm, and gods and ghosts are powerless. Thus, they may be ingested, and thus, one attains life.

The mother of *Dan Guang* is pine resin. The marrow of *Floating Water* is *fuling* (茯苓). They subdue ghosts and spirits, avert death, and restore life. Pine resin that seeps into the earth transforms into *xia ling* (狭苓) after a thousand years; *fuling* transmutes into amber after a thousand years; amber becomes *Dan Guang* after a thousand years—*Dan Guang* is purple and luminous. After another thousand years, *Dan Guang* becomes *Fei Jie Zhi* (蜚节芝); *Fei Jie Zhi* becomes the marrow of *Floating Water* after a thousand years; the marrow of *Floating Water* becomes *Ye Guang* (夜光) after a thousand years; *Ye Guang* becomes *Jin Jing* (金精) after a thousand years; *Jin Jing* becomes a shooting star after a thousand years; a shooting star becomes *Shi Dan* (石胆) after a thousand years; *Shi Dan* becomes *Jin Gang* (金刚) after a thousand years; and *Jin Gang* becomes *Mu Wei Xi Zhi* (木威僖芝) after a thousand years. Gold, when cast into fire, does not diminish; when placed in water, it thrives.

The transformations of pine resin are ever without fixed form, thus it may sink and pervade without bound or ascend to the Great Clarity. This is the method of the flying immortals—do not transmit it to the unworthy.

The formula states: First take twelve *jin* each of pine resin and *fuling*. Soak the *fuling* and pine resin in water for seven days, then drain the water at sunrise. Mix the *fuling* with two *dou* of pure wine and consume it, drying it in the sun. Eat one *jin* per month, and you will no longer need to eat.

Next, refine the pine resin to remove its bitterness and odor. Warm it with fire, then blend it with the *fuling* and mix with white honey. Combine these three substances and consume one *jin* per month. After a hundred days, the body becomes light; after two hundred days, chills and fever depart; after three hundred days, wind in the head, chest, and eyes is dispelled; after four hundred days, the five taxations and seven injuries vanish; after five hundred days, cold accumulations, phlegm-rheum, and qi bind in the abdomen are removed; after six hundred days, the complexion stabilizes; after seven hundred days, blemishes fade; after eight hundred days, black hair grows; after nine hundred days, scars from moxibustion disappear; after a thousand days, the eyes become bright; after two thousand days, the complexion renews; after three thousand days, one leaves no footprints; after four thousand days, all marks vanish; after five thousand days, one sees light at night; after six thousand days, the flesh renews; after seven thousand days, skin and vessels are concealed; after eight thousand days, the spirit is strong; after nine thousand days, one resembles a youth; after ten thousand days, the form is naturally sound; after twenty thousand days, the spirit is enlightened; after thirty thousand days, one manifests in broad daylight; after forty thousand days, the Great One welcomes you; after fifty thousand days, one sits in disappearance and stands in vanishing.

Consume it thrice daily, taking care never to forget. After ten thousand days, you may roam freely, change your name and surname, and ascend to the imperial heavens.

In ancient times, there was a man named Huang Chuping. By faithfully consuming this medicine, he became a perfected one. Chuping was from Danxi. At the age of fifteen, his family sent him to herd sheep. A Daoist, seeing his goodness and diligence, took him to a stone chamber in Mount Jinhua, where he remained for over forty years, suddenly ceasing to think of home. His elder brother, Chuqi, searched for Chuping for years without success. Later, he encountered a Daoist in the marketplace and asked, "My younger brother was herding sheep and has been lost for over forty years. I do not know whether he is alive or dead. I beg you, Daoist, to divine his whereabouts." The Daoist replied, "On Mount Jinhua, there is a boy who herds sheep, surnamed Huang, named Chuping—he is your brother." Chuqi, upon hearing this, followed the Daoist and found his brother. After exchanging joyful and sorrowful words, Chuqi asked Chuping, "Where are the sheep you once herded?" Chuping replied, "The sheep are just east of the mountain." Chuqi went to look but saw no sheep—only white stones. Returning, he said to Chuping, "There are no sheep east of the mountain." Chuping replied, "The sheep are there—it is only that you cannot see them." They went together, and Chuping shouted, "Sheep, rise!" At once, the white stones all stood up and became sheep—tens of thousands of them. Chuqi said, "You alone have attained the Dao to such a degree—can I learn it?" Chuping replied, "Only if you are devoted to the Way." Chuqi then abandoned his wife and children, staying with Chuping to consume pine resin and *fuling*. After fifty thousand days, he could sit in disappearance and stand in vanishing, walking at midday without a shadow, his complexion like that of a youth. Together, they returned to their hometown, where nearly all their relatives had died, so they departed again. Chuping taught the formula to Nan Bo Feng, changing his surname to Chi. Chuqi changed his name to Chi Luban, and Chuping changed his name to Chi Songzi. Thereafter, thousands of people who consumed this medicine became immortals.

**Chi Songzi’s Formula**
On the sixteenth day of the seventh month, remove the fingernails and toenails to expel the Three Corpses worms from the abdomen.

**Perpetual Mountain-Dwelling Non-Food Formula**
Use ten parts of soybeans, three parts of *weirui*, one part of *zexie*, one part of *feiying*, and half a part of *gaoben* leaves. Grind these five ingredients into powder, mix with jujube pulp, and form pills the size of plums. Swallow three daily, along with twenty-one jujubes, and you may go without food for life. If jujubes are unavailable, regularly drink Jade Spring water.

**The Yellow Emperor’s Four-Substance Immortal Formula of Yellow Lightness**
The first is *Hongguang*, the second is *Qianqiu*, the third is *Wansui*, and the fourth is *Cimo shi*. Combine these four substances, forming pills with white pine resin the size of chicken eggs. Consuming them for seven years grants a lifespan of forty-three thousand years without death. Taking them continuously allows one to endure with heaven and earth.

The Yellow Emperor asked, "What do the forms of these four substances resemble? May I hear of them?"
Huang Qing replied, "Hongguang is mica. Qianqiu is curled cypress, growing among mountain stones. Wansui is *zexie*. Cimo is amaranth seed. Form them into pills with pine resin, the size of chicken eggs. Consume one pill at dusk each day, and one will endure forever, free from hunger and thirst."

**Perfected One’s Four-Substance Grain-Avoidance Powder**
Use three parts of *fuling* powder, one part of dried *dihuang* powder, one part of *huma* powder, and one part of *tianmen dong* powder. Parch the *huma* over fire. Grind these four ingredients together, mix with honey, and consume a square *cun* spoonful daily, taking it with fine rice-water wine. After thirty days, one’s strength will differ; after a hundred days, it will double; after a year, the complexion will be like clouds, and one will dream of wandering with spirits; after three years, the bones will soar and the flesh will fly.

**Sophora**
Sophora is the essence of the Void Star. Long-term consumption rejuvenates the old, prevents brain depletion, and enhances the complexion. On the *shangsi* day of the tenth month, gather sophora seeds and place them in a new clay jar. Cover it with a clay basin, seal it with mud, and open it after twenty-one days. Wash the seeds, and their outer skins will peel away, leaving the kernels like soybeans. Begin consumption on the first day of the month: one seed on the first day, two on the second, three on the third, increasing by one each day until the tenth day. In ten days, consume fifty-five seeds. In a long month, consume one hundred sixty-five; in a short month, do not follow the long-month count.

In one year, consume one thousand nine hundred eighty seeds. Since a year has six short months, subtract sixty seeds.

**Another Method for Consuming Sophora to Treat Illness**
On the *shangsi* day of the tenth month, gather sophora seeds and dry them in the shade for one hundred days. Pound them to remove the skins, then place the kernels in a clay vessel. Begin consumption on the first day: one seed on the first day, ten seeds on the tenth day, then restart from one. Follow this pattern for ten days, then repeat as before. To treat sudden illnesses, stagnant fluids, undigested food, chest fullness, diarrhea, or dysentery: take one *ge* at a time, and recovery will follow after two *ge*. There is no toxicity in large doses. If the patient has a poor appetite, do not administer too much, as it may cause hard, difficult bowel movements.

**Method for Expelling the Three Worms**
Gather sophora seeds—no need to wait for the *shangsi* day. Collect them with their skins intact, pound them into a paste, and form into pills the size of apricot kernels. Take three pills per dose, twice daily. Preparing a larger quantity for long-term use is also beneficial. Alternatively, they may be made into honey pills.

**Longevity Formula**
Use ripe sophora seeds, place them inside ox intestines, and dry in the shade for one hundred days. Then, swallow one seed at morning and evening meals. After ten days, the body will feel light; after thirty days, white hair will turn black; after one hundred days, the complexion will glow; after two hundred days, one will outrun a galloping horse.

**Rejuvenation Formula**
On the *shangsi* day of the tenth month, consume one sophora seed, increasing by one each day until the tenth day, then restart from one. The preparation should be made on the *shangsi* day itself.

**The Single-Ingredient Lotus Powder, Bestowed by the True Person for Monthly Use**
Gather seven *fen* of lotus flowers on the seventh day of the seventh month, eight *fen* of lotus roots on the eighth day of the eighth month, and nine *fen* of lotus seeds on the ninth day of the ninth month. Combine them to complete the formula. Take one *fangcun* spoonful, as taught to Liu Changsheng of Nanyang. Changsheng dwells in the northern reaches of Qingyuan Marsh. Having consumed the formula for over seventy years, he neither ages nor weakens. To verify its efficacy, feed it to a chick the size of a myna bird: after three years, it will remain a fledgling, proving the formula’s power to confer immortality.

Lotus seeds are also called *water red lingzhi*, *qie* seeds, *qian* seeds, lotus flowers, or hibiscus. Their leaves are called *he*, their small roots *yu*, their large roots *ou*, and their initial roots *jiao*. Together with *qianshi* (fox nut), they form a yin-yang pair. On the *shangxu* day of the eighth month, gather lotus pods; on the *shangxu* day of the ninth month, gather fox nut seeds; and on the *shangwu* day of the ninth month, gather lotus roots. Dry each in the shade for one hundred days, then process them in equal parts. On the first *shangmao* day of the first month at dawn, take one *fangcun* spoonful with well-water, four or five times daily, followed by meals. Continue for one hundred days. This formula tonifies the center, augments qi and strength, nourishes the spirit, eliminates hunger, dispels all illnesses, and with prolonged use, lightens the body, extends life, prevents aging, and bestows immortality.

Fox nut seeds are also called *yan* seeds, *heavenly gate essence*, *heavenly Yu*, or *yao*. Their sweet flavor treats damp impediment, lumbar and spinal pain, supplements and boosts qi, strengthens the will, sharpens hearing and vision, and with prolonged use, lightens the body, eliminates hunger, and bestows immortality.

**Longevity Formula**
On the *zhicheng* day of the eighth month, gather lotus seeds; on the *zhicheng* day of the ninth month, gather fox nut seeds. Dry them in the shade for one hundred days, then pound and combine in equal parts. On the *zhicheng* day, take one *fangcun* spoonful with well-water. After one hundred days, the strong will no longer age, and the old will regain youth. If in doubt, feed the formula to a chick for one hundred days to witness its effects. Prolonged use bestows immortality.

**Deer Antler Formula for Longevity, Enhancing Hearing and Vision, and Blackening Hair**
Take fresh antlers, scrape away the black skin with a knife, and collect the white inner portion. Roast until yellow, then process thoroughly. Take one *fangcun* spoonful twice daily. After thirty days, one will attain divine clarity; after sixty days, strength will increase a hundredfold; after one hundred days, one will commune with spirits. With continuous use, life will be boundless and longevity infinite. Peng Zigao and Rong Cheng consumed it to attain immortality, while Fan Li took it to wander among the people.

**Yellow Essence Herb**
The yellow essence herb is the essence of the Great Yang. It gathers qi from the nine heavens, drifts through the eight expanses, follows the wind’s transformations, and scatters its essence across the six directions. It takes root beside mountains, borrows its name from the clouds and rain, and assumes its form by clinging to light. As a plant, it grows on the slopes of Mount Taihang, its roots clinging to the sides of boulders. Embracing the essence of the three yangs, it flourishes with the qi, nurturing purity and harmony, tempering sweet dew. Above, it receives the Great Fire of the Lesser Yang, blooming in the height of summer. Accumulating essence to refine its truth, it fills its roots and multiplies its nodes. Its color is yellow, its flavor sweet. At dawn, it turns toward the sun, its veins and textures unobstructed. Unlike other plants, it does not wither in drought, and no other being rivals its singularity. This is the dwelling of the Central Yellow, the ancestral source of accumulated yang—its divine transformations are wondrous indeed.

When serpents consume it, they transform into dragons; when birds consume it, they become phoenixes; when humans consume it, they become immortal kings. Great is this herb, for it captures the pure essence of heaven and earth. Yet the people of the world do not know its truth; those who know it cannot consume it. Thus, the *Scripture of the Great Immortals of the Nine Heavens* states: "Thirty-six thousand spirits of heaven and earth enter the human body, yet none can be harnessed. Thirty-six thousand immortality elixirs exist, yet none are used. Long life and enduring vision are possible, yet none achieve them. Divine sagacity can be attained, and lifespan extended, yet none comprehend the way. Though the spirits are luminous, and the effects of consuming the elixirs are swift and evident, none persist in the practice."

People cling to poverty and lowliness to nurture their bodies, yet I have never seen one attain long life and enduring vision. Those who chase power and profit do so eagerly in the present age. If people sought long life with the same fervor as they seek profit, none would fail to attain it. Those who can relinquish glory and splendor, cultivate stillness and purity, embrace constant non-action, and seek the mysterious and wondrous—consuming this herb without fail through the four seasons—may achieve extended life. If one can renounce the mundane world, dwell in seclusion in the famous mountains, and consume this herb, one may stand peerless with heaven and earth, gather with the host of spirits, receive the welcome of the Great One, ascend to the celestial palace, and wander Kunlun. One may thus share the beginning and end of heaven and earth.

This herb stands opposite to *goumian*. *Huangjing* is the essence of the Great Yang, and when ingested, it grants long life. *Goumian*, however, is the essence of the Great Yin, and when taken, it brings immediate death—yet people remain unaware of their opposition. They believe only in *goumian*’s power to kill but not in *huangjing*’s power to give life, and so they do not consume it.

*Goumian* is wild aconite. In the southern mountains of Rinan, the barbarian tribes call wild aconite *goumian*. When eaten, it kills instantly, its poison seething and vengeful, its qi hooking into the intestines and severing them—hence the name *goumian*. This is what it means when people neglect long life in their craving for fleeting glory.

Only *huangjing*, among all herbs and trees, embodies the qi of the Three Yangs. It ascends into the Palace of Great Purity, refining its essence into profound wonder, transforming with the flow of pure harmony. Its radiance streams across the Nine Wilds, spreading through the Six Directions. It hides in clouds and conceals itself in mountains, shifting form with the qi. Its roots take hold, its stems rise, its leaves transmit essence, and its sweet, fragrant taste forms. Its leaves are green and yellow, connecting with spirits and transcending union. Ten thousand roots grow downward, catching the wind and bearing dew. Its roots knot in several nodes, slanting and branching sideways. It receives pure, hidden qi and exhales to nurture the true. Its flowers possess nine virtues, enhancing longevity and advancing wisdom. Its stems hold numinous treasures—consuming them makes one an immortal. Its roots are celestial treasures, harmonizing light and commanding spirits. Taken as a powdered elixir, they enable flight as a transcendent.

In late spring, gather its roots—called *mountain essence*—wash them in clear water, and place them in a large tray. Carefully prepare them for consumption, either fresh or dried. When dried, they become powder; when fresh, they form pills. Consuming much allows one to abstain from grains, while taking little calms the spirit. Whether root or flower, all three grades of ingestion yield the same effect. With years of accumulation, one attains spiritual transcendence. The flowers are *flying blossoms*, the roots *flowing essence*. Together, they nourish the inner spirits, transforming one’s spirit into numinosity, illuminating with penetrating clarity, sharpening vision across a thousand miles. They bind the hun and anchor the po, balancing the Five Viscera, driving out the Three Worms, subduing the corpse-reflex, and dispelling fright. With regular consumption, heaven and earth merge as one.

Its roots are yellow, not white; its leaves soft and lustrous. It receives pure, untainted qi, unlike ordinary plants. While a hundred grasses wither and fade with autumn, *huangjing* flourishes, concealing the Dao and harboring virtue. Its numinous stalks sway gently, its flowers and leaves gleaming. In mid-spring, gather its blossoms, place them in a silk pouch, and dry them in the shade under the Six Ding days, with the Jade Maiden at one’s side. Consuming them for a thousand days, one may sit in death or stand in disappearance.

Its spring and autumn leaves and roots harmonize yin and yang. Formed into pills or cakes, they reveal a sweet, fragrant taste. The amount consumed depends on one’s intention—there is no fixed measure. Its stems and leaves, rich in essence, yield a juice that serves as a broth, broadening the center and replenishing qi. The Five Viscera are regulated, the flesh plumps, the bones strengthen, and one’s strength surpasses that of youth. The body thrives in health, and immortals consume it as their supreme sustenance.

**Numinous Treasure Huangjing Formula**
In spring, take the roots, wash them clean, and slice thinly. Steam thoroughly, then dry in the sun until crisp. Pound and take a square-inch spoonful—best done in the open air. It is also called *horse arrow*, *mianbamboo*, *weirui*, *keju*, *sheep’s clasp*, *immortal’s surplus grain*, *gouge*, and *hanging pearl*. Its leaves are called *chicken’s clasp root*; it is also named *huangjing*, *white fern*, and *baiqi*. Gather the roots in the third month for consumption. It lightens the body, replenishes qi, and brightens the eyes. Eating it allows one to endure hunger. Its taste is sweet and non-toxic. Dried in the shade for fifty days, it matures. Take a peck of its fruit, soak it in sweet water, and use two pecks to make a broth or wine. Regular consumption ensures immortality.

Consuming *huangjing* roots yields many benefits. Wash and scrape them to remove all soil. Boil one *hu* of roots in two *hu* of water until the flavor is fully extracted. Strain and boil again, repeating until the essence is exhausted. Combine and simmer the liquid until it thickens, then remove from heat and mix with roasted soybean powder to form cakes the size of coins. Consume as desired—the taste is sweet and fragrant. The roots may also be steamed or boiled and eaten without restriction.

When it first sprouts, its stems and leaves may be taken as vegetables for fasting meals—this is the *double-storied* of the day. If boiled, the broth may be drunk—do not discard it, for it is fragrant and delicious.

**Method for Consumption**
In the second and eighth months, gather the roots, scrape off the hairs, wash thoroughly, and slice finely. Boil one *hu* of roots in six *dou* of water over a gentle fire until the medicine is done by evening. Remove and let cool, then knead by hand to break it apart. Use a wine bag to press out the juice, then simmer until it thickens enough to form pills. Dry the residue into powder, mix it into the pot, and blend until the medicine is ready. Take pills the size of chicken eggs, three times daily. This allows one to abstain from grains without hunger or cold, to run as swiftly as a galloping horse, and to cure all illnesses.

One who can abstain from the bedchamber will not age and may attain boundless longevity as an immortal. Without such abstinence, one may still live two hundred years. Consuming this medicine, one need not fear tigers or wolves, nor dread weapons of war. When traveling in the mountains, one may eat it raw, drink water freely when thirsty, and consume it fresh. It also enhances communion with the divine and may be taken as a powder—ingestion is not strictly necessary.

Consuming *huangjing* prevents aging, restores youthful complexion, turns white hair black, and makes fallen teeth regrow. After thirty days, one gains clarity of spirit; after a hundred days, one may leap and run like a galloping horse without fatigue. After two hundred days, one may appear and vanish at will. After ten years, the Dao of immortality is achieved. Many have witnessed its efficacy, and past generations often consumed this formula.

Some consume only the flowers—the essence of *huangjing*, also called *yellow blossom*. Its taste is sweet and fragrant. Boil its "mother" (root) to make a drink that broadens the center, replenishes qi, and wards off malign qi. Regular consumption imparts a radiant complexion and resilience to cold and heat. It is also called *salvation-from-poverty grain*, for in famine years, both young and old may rely on it to survive without other food. Consuming its flowers surpasses its fruit, and its fruit surpasses its roots.

The Celestial Officials name this herb *Wuji Zhi*. In ancient times, one who entered the Red City within Mount Huo saw therein several thousand households, all tilling the fields and cultivating this herb—some planting dozens of *qing*, others merely dozens of *mu*. Their roots and stems grew exceptionally large, for they were diligently tended and hoed, unlike those that sprouted wild in the mountains. It thrives in marshes and wetlands.

The traveler asked the people of Red City, “Why do you cultivate this herb?” They replied, “This is an herb of immortality. The people here have long consumed it to attain longevity.” When Sun Quan, Lord of Wu, heard this account and verified its truth, he dispatched men to cultivate it in the mountains of Jiangdong and consume it. Yet Sun Quan did not abstain from the bedchamber, nor maintain stillness in his conduct, and thus failed to reap its benefits. At the time, overseers and soldiers were stationed to guard the fields. Though Wu fell, the name of this place endured. In Jiangdong, it is sometimes called *Mianzhu Li*, or *Yellow Li*, the very site where Sun Quan once planted it.

Disciple Ge Hong once heard from Master Zheng of its origins, who said:
*“Consume Wuji, and life shall not end;
Consume the essence of longevity,
And stand peerless beneath heaven.”*

I have also heard from the transmission of Immortal Ge Xian’gong: “Those who cultivate the Dao of longevity must first expel the Three Worms and subdue the Lying Corpses before engaging in medicinal fasting and grain avoidance. Without expelling the Three Worms and Lying Corpses, those who abstain from grain will be plagued by cravings, harming the body. Moreover, they may encounter tempting foods, leading to distraction and transgression.

The highest path is to practice non-action, ingest natural qi, and rinse with sweet springs. Most cannot achieve this, so they may rely on herbs to assist—first subduing the Lying Corpses, then consuming the medicine, which yields efficacy. This is the secondary path of the Dao.

When compounding medicine, choose an auspicious day under a clear sky, free of clouds, and form the pills in a secluded place. Do not speak of the medicine while preparing it. The Three Worms, though earless, hear; though eyeless, see. First bathe with orchid-scented water, fast for three days, avoid women, and abstain from pork and dog meat. Consuming these meats leads to death, barring ascent to heaven—one is confined to Mount Tai, cast into the Three Officials’ hell, and becomes a ghostly warden. This rule applies to Daoist practitioners.

Furthermore, avoid pork and dog meat, for they cause forgetfulness in old age, a sallow complexion, tooth decay, and a ruined voice. Those who consume purity attain longevity; those who consume filth meet their end. The crane does not kill living things, hence its thousand-year lifespan; the swan does not tread black waters, hence its century-long life. Purity begets truth; clarity begets longevity—this is the natural order.”

**Formula for Expelling the Three Worms and Lying Corpses**
Use ten *jin* of *fuling*, five *jin* of *zhanglu* root (peeled to retain only the white inner part), five *dou* each of clear wine and wheat yeast. Steam and ferment them in a jar, sealing it for twenty days. Once the medicine is ready, shape it into a paste. Take pure, roasted soybeans, grind them into a syrup-like powder, and form pills the size of large marbles. Consume three pills daily. After ten days, the effects will gradually manifest.

The Upper Corpse, resembling a hand, emerges after a hundred days—black in color.
The Middle Corpse, resembling a foot, emerges after sixty days—blue in color.
The Lower Corpse, resembling a chicken egg, emerges after thirty days—white in color.
All will rot and be expelled.

**The Three Corpses and Their Nature**

The Three Corpses are born within man and ever seek his death. On the last day of the lunar month and the first day of the new moon, they ascend to heaven to report his transgressions. When the last day arrives, one must restrain the *hun* and subdue the *po*, and on the night of *gengshen*, remain vigilant—thus the Three Corpses cannot stir. On such nights, if one dreams of struggling with another, it is the *po* contending with the Corpses. The *hun* ever desires tranquility, yet the body resists submission to the Corpses; the *po* ever seeks calm, yet the spirit inclines toward distraction. The Three Corpses, desiring man’s death, strive to assail and seize him—such is their nature.

Most Daoist adepts and physicians merely follow formulas to treat the body, unaware that the Lying Corpses dwell within the abdomen, obstructing the efficacy of medicines—all the work of the Three Worms. The Upper Corpse craves boundless wealth, the Middle Corpse delights in the five flavors, and the Lower Corpse lusts after the five colors. If they are not expelled, one merely deceives oneself. Once purged, hunger ceases, the mind becomes still and free of thoughts, and one may attain longevity.

The Perfected value this formula, Daoists revere its medicine, the wise delight in its use, while the foolish scoff at the practice. Thus, when men speak of the dead as "corpses," it is by virtue of these Three Worms’ designations.

To prepare the *zhanglu* powder is sufficient to expel the Three Corpses—fermentation is not strictly necessary. Sophora seeds are also effective. Those who practice *qi*-absorption need not employ this method.

Moreover, true *qi* is the "green sprout," the essence of the five directions. If a Daoist ingests it for twenty-one days, the Three Worms will flee.

**Le Zichang’s Refined Sesame Paste Formula**
Take two *dou* of sesame paste and one *dou* of water, combine with two *sheng* of frankincense and two *sheng* of aloeswood, grind into powder, and boil until the water evaporates, leaving only the paste. Mix the powder into it. Consume five *ge* daily with wine. After a hundred days, jade maidens will attend you—its efficacy is divine. After five hundred days, immortals will come to escort you away. This formula is a closely guarded secret of the Daoist tradition, never lightly transmitted.

**Le Zichang’s Sesame Method**
Roast one *dou* of sesame until fragrant, then pound it into fine powder. Place it in a silk bag and steep in five *dou* of wine, sealing it for twenty days. Consume the wine, which becomes infused with sesame essence. The powder may also be ingested directly.

**The Numinous Treasure’s Supreme Mystery Yin-Generating Talisman**
A script of Xia Yu, received from the Perfected One of Mount Zhong. The Way of Corpse-Release for Lesser Immortals. Its lifespan matches that of heaven and earth, allowing one to wander sacred mountains as an Earth Immortal.

After completing the prescribed days of the Corpse-Release elixir, inscribe this talisman in cinnabar on white silk and place it before the abdomen. On a *wu* or *ji* day, lie with the head to the west, meditate upon oneself as a corpse, and after a long while, remove the garments and leave them where one lay. Depart immediately for the mountains. If traveling far, change one’s name and never return to the former home. Initially, others will see a corpse where one lay, but after some time, it will vanish without a trace.

**Corpse-Release Elixir**
In the third month, slaughter an ox and render one and a half *jin* of its fat. Combine with one and a half *jin* each of mercury and tin. Seclude oneself in the mountains for a month of purification, then melt the tin in a bronze vessel. Once liquefied, add the mercury and fat, blending them into pills the size of large soybeans. Consume three pills thrice daily. After nine days—eighty-one pills in total—one will suddenly undergo Corpse-Release, shedding the body like a snake’s slough. Depart as instructed by the talisman above. If unsuccessful, consume more and hasten the process until release is achieved.

The Perfected One says: Use cinnabar for the script, fresh silk for the cloth, and a fresh silk pouch for storage. The ancients called cinnabar "vermilion child" and silk "fresh support."

**Formula for Expelling the Three Worms and Lying Corpses**
On the third day of the third month, gather peach leaves, pound them to extract seven *sheng* of juice, and boil with vinegar until reduced to five or six *ge*. Consume on an empty stomach in one dose.

**Divine Immortal’s Cultivation and Nourishment Formula**
Render one *dou* of ox or sheep fat on an auspicious day. Combine with one *dou* of sesame, one hundred pieces of dried ginger, half a *jin* of fresh ginger, and one *jin* of fresh rehmannia, then press to extract the juices. Simmer in a large bronze pot over low heat until the medicinal essence is exhausted and the fat turns yellow. Strain and discard the dregs. Take a portion the size of a chicken egg, dissolve in wine, and consume thrice daily. It cures all ailments, restores black hair, and renews teeth.

**Divine Immortal’s Wine Formula**
Take ten *jin* of fresh rehmannia, three *jin* of fresh ginger (peeled), and five *jin* of asparagus root (peeled), then chop and pound them together into a mash. Steep in one *hu* of fine wine, dividing it between two jars. Seal tightly and place the jars in a large cauldron to steam until the stoppers emit hot, billowing vapor. Consume one *sheng* warm daily before sleep, sensing the radiant *qi* of the medicine coursing through the body. This wine replenishes deficiency and taxation, augments essence and *qi*, strengthens appetite, fortifies against wind and cold, enhances complexion, and imparts lustrous skin, prolonging life.

**Atractylodes Wine Formula**
Grind five *dou* of processed atractylodes into powder, place in a silk bag, and steep in one *hu* of fine wine for ten days. Remove the atractylodes, dry it in the sun, and reserve.

Alternatively, mix with glutinous rice porridge, ferment into wine, and consume; eating the dregs is also beneficial.

**Divine Wine Formula**
Cures all diseases, replenishes essence, augments *qi*, and beautifies the complexion. Take three *jin* of cassia (or a three-*chi* length, finely processed to retain only the inner bark) and five *sheng* of asparagus root powder, place in a silk bag, and steep in five *dou* of rice wine until fermented. Consume as desired.

**Sesame Wine Formula**
Roast five *dou* of sesame until fragrant, then pound into fine powder. Mix into one *hu* of glutinous rice porridge and ferment as usual. Once ready, drink as desired. It plumps the body, whitens the skin, and imparts a lustrous complexion.

**Rehmannia Divine Wine Formula**
Prepare five *dou* of glutinous rice porridge, strain to yield two *dou* of liquid, then add three *jin* of fine wheat yeast, allowing the wine’s fragrance to rise. Take ten *jin* of fresh rehmannia root, briefly sun-dry, then thoroughly pound. Steam one *dou* of rice into cooked grains, mix into the liquid, and stir well. Seal with clay for a day, then check if the rehmannia is softened—only fibrous strands should remain. Strain the dregs, steam another two *dou* of rice, and add to the wine until fully fermented. Drink one *sheng* thrice daily. It cures all diseases, remedies the five taxations and seven injuries, knits bones and sinews, replenishes marrow, and with prolonged use, extends lifespan.

**Pine Resin Wine Formula**
Use three *dou* of glutinous rice and two *jin* of wheat yeast to brew wine as usual. Then add one *jin* of white pine resin, five *sheng* each of asparagus root powder and poria powder, sealing with clay for thirty days until mature. Consume three *sheng* at once to prolong life. The pine resin must first be refined to remove its bitter taste.

**Alternative Pine Resin Wine Formula**

**Pokeweed Wine Formula**
Use three *dou* of glutinous rice, ten *jin* of wheat yeast, and one *dou* of asparagus root powder. Process pokeweed roots until white, dry, and grind into ten *jin* of powder. Ferment together for sixty days, then strain the dregs. Drink as desired. Prolonged use eliminates the need for grain, plumps the abdomen, augments *qi*, expels the three worms, eradicates dormant pathogens, and treats the five taxations and seven injuries in men and women, as well as postpartum ailments and vaginal discharge (red or white). It sharpens hearing and vision, enhances mental acuity, and erases facial blemishes and scars. One variant uses only one *jin* of pokeweed.

**Lycium Berry Wine Formula**
Wash and clean one hundred *jin* of lycium roots, finely chop, and boil in a large cauldron with ample water. Strain the liquid, let it settle in a vessel, and decant five *dou* of clear juice. Wash thirty *jin* of fresh rehmannia root, pound, and extract its juice, then combine with the lycium juice. Use three *jin* of yeast, finely ground, and five *dou* of red glutinous rice, steaming the rice with the medicinal juice. Once cooked, mix with the yeast and ferment in the combined juices. Drink the matured wine as desired, without restriction—only avoid intoxication. It cures all diseases, boosts *qi* and strength, and extends lifespan.

This herb is also called *mengchai*, *chunlü*, *xianrenzhang*, *xiwangmu zhang*, *tianjing*, *queshu*, *digou*, or *gouqi*. With eight names, it corresponds to the eight *qi*. The immortals say: "If you wish to live long, consume my eight *qi*; by ingesting them, you shall see far."

**Five-Leaf Ginseng Wine Formula**
Chop five-leaf ginseng into one-*cun* segments; one *dou* of chopped herb yields one *dou* of material. Steep in fine wine for ten days. Drink warm, in moderation. It sharpens hearing and vision, regrows fallen teeth, restores black hair, lightens the body, strengthens vitality, and enhances complexion. It treats impotence, postpartum ailments, and all diseases in women, promoting fertility. Select only the male variety (five leaves, sweet taste); avoid the female (three leaves, bitter taste).

**Asparagus Root Wine Formula**
Harvest the roots in autumn, wash, and extract juice as desired. Soak rice and yeast in the juice, fermenting as usual. Drink without restriction, avoiding only excessive intoxication. Alternatively, dry the roots into powder and take with this wine—more is better. This remedy cures all diseases, calms the spirit, nourishes *qi*, and grants immortality. It is the formula once used by Lady Xia. If juice extraction is incomplete, rinse the roots with water, pound again, and strain. Over time, the wine may sour; store it in a jar and boil in a cauldron to prevent spoilage.

One variant prescribes taking a square-inch spoonful three to four times daily—more is better.

**Asparagus Root Decoction Formula**
Treats consumptive diseases, suspended fluid beneath the heart causing loss of appetite, and thirst. It plumps the body and ensures eternal youth. Use two hundred *jin* of asparagus root and one hundred *jin* of fresh rehmannia root, both thoroughly washed. Pound and extract the juice, then decant the clear liquid: one *hu* of asparagus juice and five *dou* of rehmannia juice. Combine in a copper vessel and simmer over low heat until reduced to five or six *dou*. Add four *dou* of white honey and continue simmering over a water bath, stirring constantly for several days until it can be formed into pills. Take one pill the size of a chicken egg thrice daily, or mix with wine. Effects appear within ten days.

Do not attempt to process all the rehmannia and asparagus at once; store excess in soil to prevent spoilage.

**Divine Formula for Longevity**
Peel three *hu* of asparagus root, thoroughly wash, pound, and extract one *hu* of juice. Simmer over low heat until reduced to about five *dou*, then add one *dou* of white honey. Roast sesame until fragrant and golden, grind into two *dou* of powder, and stir into the mixture without pause until thickened. Shape into cakes with soybean flour, three *cun* square and half a *cun* thick. Consume one cake daily. After a hundred days, the skin becomes lustrous, white hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow, and lifespan extends indefinitely. This method of consuming asparagus is most wondrous.

**Perfected One’s Asparagus Root Wine Formula**
Harvest the roots in autumn, thoroughly pound, and extract juice as desired. Soak rice and yeast in the juice to brew wine as usual. Alternatively, gather the roots, dry, grind into powder, and take a square-inch spoonful with this wine three to four times daily. Avoid excessive intoxication; no restrictions apply.

After three years of consuming the medicine, all illnesses are cured, and leprous worms bore through the skin, exiting from the joints. After three years, hair and fallen eyebrows regrow; after ten years, one’s name is inscribed in the Register of Life. After twenty years, one feels neither cold in winter nor heat in summer; after thirty years, an elder of a hundred years appears as a youth of fifteen. After forty years, one attains communion with spirits, and a divine maiden will bring medicine—upon consuming it, this is the divine elixir. Three days later, one sheds the mortal form and ascends as an immortal. Even after obtaining the divine cinnabar, drinking this wine further enhances its effects.

**Invigorating Immortal Wine Formula**
Take twenty *jin* each of *Atractylodes* (术) and rehmannia (地黄), and twenty *jin* of *Solanum* (五茄), removing the outer skin. Chop finely and boil in one *shi* and five *dou* of water until reduced to two *dou* of liquid. Strain and use the decoction to soak yeast, then brew with one *shi* of glutinous millet as in standard wine-making. Once the wine is ready, drink one cup thrice daily. After one month, the body becomes robust; after two months, the skin glows, and one can run as swiftly as a galloping horse, free from all ailments. For smaller batches, use two *dou* of rice or more as the standard, with four *jin* each of *Solanum* and rehmannia (using only the stems of *Solanum*).

**Divine Wine for Curing All Illnesses**
Take five *jin* each of hemp seeds and wheat yeast. Process the hemp seeds and yeast finely, sift, and soak together in one *shi* of water for three nights. Strain and discard the dregs, then steam five *dou* of glutinous millet and add to the liquid at an appropriate temperature. Let it ferment for two more nights before the medicine is ready. Consume as desired, but avoid letting the water grow cold, or the medicine will fail. Use only pure, fresh white rice. Consume this medicinal wine for a hundred days before practicing other Daoist methods.

**Numinous Treasure Wine of Rehmannia and Lycium**
Gather over a hundred *jin* of lycium roots and stems, wash to remove dirt, chop finely, and boil in a large cauldron with ample water until reduced to about five *dou* of liquid. Strain through silk to clarify. Take twenty *jin* of rehmannia roots, wash to remove soil, pound, and extract the juice. Pour about one *dou* of lycium decoction over the rehmannia dregs, press to extract all juice, then combine both juices. Take three *jin* of fine yeast, grind, and soak in the combined juice. Wash three *dou* of red glutinous millet, steam, and pour the rehmannia-lycium juice over it. Remove the yeast dregs once the millet is cooked, then ferment. Once the wine is ready, drink according to one’s capacity, stopping before intoxication. This wine cures wind-dampness, chronic cold, qi ascent, emaciation, and all ailments. To brighten the eyes, take a square-inch spoonful of *Kochia scoparia* (地肤) powder with this wine. Abstain from sexual activity, pork, raw fish, and *Veronica* vegetables. With prolonged consumption, one attains longevity and immortality.

**Asparagus Wine Formula**
Take thirty *jin* of asparagus, wash clean, and place in a silk bag. Use one *dou* of asparagus juice to soak the fermented rice, then brew with one *shi* of rice as usual. Add yeast and ferment according to standard methods. Place the bag of asparagus at the bottom of the vessel, add the rice, and seal with mud. After thirty days, the wine is ready; strain out the asparagus dregs and drink without becoming excessively intoxicated. Consuming one *hu* cures all illnesses and imparts a jade-like luster to the body. This wine may also be used to take asparagus pills, chrysanthemum, or cypress seeds, yielding excellent results. Another method states to remove the dregs after one month.

**Lycium Wine Formula**
Cures wind, the five taxations, the seven injuries, and strengthens bones. Take a hundred *jin* of lycium, chop finely (including stems), wash to remove soil, and boil. When the inner stem can be peeled, and the outer skin is dry, it is done. Strain and reserve the liquid, then boil the remaining raw lycium as before. For one *hu* of rice, use a hundred *jin* of lycium decoction, ensuring sufficient liquid to brew one *hu* of rice.

**Brewing Method**
Use refined glutinous or *Lin* rice, winnow thoroughly, and wipe clean with a damp cloth. Soak in lycium decoction, steam, and spread to cool. Soak the yeast in lycium liquid and proceed as in standard brewing. To make clear wine, add yeast starter. Another formula: brew with thirty *jin* of *Zanthoxylum* (猪椒) for superior results. Yet another: combine with thirty *jin* of rehmannia to nourish the marrow. Boil as with lycium and use to soak one *shi* of rice.

**Divine Wine Formula**
Take three *dou* of rice, three *jin* of yeast, and ten large aconite roots. Brew without adding water, using three *dou* of aged wine. Dry in the sun, then grind into powder. To make one *dou* of wine, take a square-inch spoonful of the powder and add to one *dou* of water; it will instantly become fine wine. Consume according to one’s capacity. Dry the wine and other medicines in the sun, then grind into powder for treating cold illnesses.

**Divine Wine Formula**
Take three *jin* of asparagus and one *dou* of rice, steam until cooked, and add just enough water to submerge the asparagus. Place in a bag and ferment. Once ready, combine and strain. Drink without becoming intoxicated, and avoid consuming vegetables or garlic. Consuming one *hu* of this wine cures all illnesses.

**Immortal’s Dry Wine Method**
Soak three *dou* of glutinous millet, three *dou* of non-glutinous rice, and two *dou* of malt in five *dou* of aged wine for five days. Remove, steam thoroughly without leakage, and dry in the shade for a hundred days, ensuring no loss of qi. Form into pieces the size of *bo* tiles; adding to two *dou* of water instantly produces wine. Use warm water in winter.

**Immortal’s Nourishing Green Millet Formula**
Take one *dou* of green millet, wash, and soak in aged wine for three days. Steam without leakage, then steam and sun-dry repeatedly, avoiding exposure to sunlight. Store carefully in a leather bag. When entering mountains or traveling far, one meal suffices for ten days without hunger. After ten days, another meal sustains for forty-nine days; after forty-nine days, another meal sustains for four hundred and ninety years as one cycle. One formula recommends *Xuan Liang* millet; another specifies three *dou*.

**Another Formula**
Take one *dou* of green millet and three *jin* of red halloysite. Combine, soak in water until sufficient, and place in a warm location for two to three days until a film forms. Pound into pills the size of plums. Consume three pills daily to eliminate hunger; drink water when thirsty. This enables travel of over a thousand *li* without hunger or thirst.

**Another Formula**
Take rice, wash thoroughly, steam and sun-dry repeatedly, then pound into powder. Consume once daily with water; after thirty days, drink a cup of water daily. This sustains one for life without hunger, enabling travel of three hundred *li* per day.

**Dry Wine Method**
Take five *dou* of refined rice and five *jin* of yeast. Soak in four *dou* of water until softened over two nights. Add two large *fuzi* (aconite) roots and two *liang* of fine cinnamon, then sift and mix into the wine. Press out the dregs, sun-dry, and return to the wine until all liquid is absorbed. Form into pills with white honey, the size of chicken eggs. Drop one pill into a *dou* of water to make fine wine.

**Powder of Japonica Rice for Consumption**
Take one *dou* of japonica rice and three *dou* of wine. Combine the two and soak until all wine is absorbed. Consume gradually; when thirsty, drink water. This suffices for thirty days, after which prepare again as before.

**Rice Formula for Consumption**
Take rice, wash thoroughly, steam repeatedly, sun-dry, and pound into powder. Consume once daily with water; after thirty days, drink a cup of water daily. This sustains one for life without hunger, enabling travel of three hundred *li* per day. If one wishes to eat, they may do so.

**Grain-Abstention Formula**
Take five *ge* each of japonica rice, broomcorn millet, wheat, soybeans, and hemp seeds. Roast the soybeans, then grind all into powder. Mix with one *jin* of white honey, boil to a hundred bubbles, then drop into cold water. Form into pills the size of plums. Consume one full dose in a single sitting to abstain from hunger for life. Prepare all ingredients separately, roasting only the soybeans.

**Le Zichang’s Date-Pit Sucking Method**
The Way of longevity lies in constantly holding a date pit in the mouth, moistening it with the milk-like saliva of an infant. Over time, when the mouth is full of fluid, swallow two-thirds and retain one-third, drawing it in with the breath. This is called "returning the essence." Repeat in cycles like a revolving wheel. When abstaining from grain, one may feel slight dizziness after five days, which soon passes. After fourteen days, dizziness recurs briefly, then subsides. After twenty-one days, the *qi* stabilizes. One may eat if desired or abstain naturally. During grain abstention, avoid sexual intercourse. One may consume a small amount of dried dates and drink no more than one *sheng* of wine. The method applies equally to men and women.

Here ends the middle scroll of *The Wondrous Five Talismans of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery*.

---

**The Lower Scroll of *The Wondrous Five Talismans of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery***
The celestial script shines with wondrous subtlety, profound yet lucid, its ultimate sound voiceless. Though expounded, it is never verbose.

The blade of Xiwu, though but ten inches long, can cleave jade; the metal of a shooting star, though fine as a hair’s breadth, pierces through all sight. Thus, great talent finds universal use, while minute things serve in completeness—is this not the very principle of *The Wondrous Five Talismans*?

The sages unfolded the patterns of Heaven and Earth, expounding in tens of thousands of words; they depicted the forms of dragons and phoenixes, composing a hundred chapters to animate all beings. They revealed the traces of the Eight Assemblies in the mountains and forests, making them the tasks of daily life, establishing the names of profound divisions, harmonizing herbs and trees with immortals and spirits, awakening to the boundlessness of life and destiny, and thus achieving cultivation and nourishment—all must follow an order.

Only the supreme Dao values its契合, and the perfected ones revere its script. Of old, Fuxi carved the Eight Trigrams upon dark stone, his drawings few indeed. By the Xia dynasty came the *Lianshan*, and the Shang the *Guicang*; when the *Zhouyi* arose, it still did not encompass the root. The reason lies in the hexagrams—*Tun*, *Meng*, *Kun*, *Pi*—which bear the images of obstruction, making the subtleties of the Dao difficult to manifest and its mysteries hard to fathom. Through the ages, the imperial canons have proliferated, amounting to hundreds of thousands of words. How much more so, then, the divine scriptures of the Nine Heavens and the treasure charts of the Three Heavens, which guide above the primal *qi* of Great Harmony and below prepare for the primordial assembly of all beings?

Yet the sound of utmost stillness remains scarcely understood in the world. Thus, Emperor Yu sacrificed to the Heavenly Emperor at the altar of Northern Alley, concealing the script upon the peaks of Mount Zhong, desiring that the multitudes might hear songs transcending the dust. When Yu of Xia later compiled these texts, their waves had not yet stilled; the perfected ones of the upper realms still sealed them within stone chambers, awaiting the great kalpa, while the immortals and sages remained hidden in cavernous chambers, awaiting the appointed time for their revelation.

The marvel of the *Divine Talismans* truly stems from what the loftiest sages esteem, the highest philosophers carry, the perfected ones treasure, and the divine immortals savor—its profound subtlety illumines its radiance, and the celestial spirits verify its correspondence. Those who ingest and employ the sun, moon, and stars, the eight *qi* and five primal forces, or the methods of bodily herbs and trees, merely grasp the downstream currents of the Five Talismans, a mere froth upon the flowing waters. The celestial incantations and mystical keys are not for the ears of ordinary worthies. Though recorded within the Five Talismans, their dragon traces are discarded, and their great sounds remain unmanifest.

Those who merely see without understanding—what can they say? The deaf scarcely hear the resonance of the great bell; the blind strain to discern the path of black and white—how is this different? Though the sages do not explain their lofty and wondrous intent, they nonetheless set it forth upon the original talismans, without diminution.

The Perfected One of Mount Zhong told Yu of Xia: "Long ago, I heard from the Youth of the Eastern Sea, who said: 'Simply embrace the *Divine Treasure Talisman* and enter the water to plunge into the abyss, and the Northern Emperor will open the path, with flood dragons as your escort, while the water spirits tremble in fear. You shall attain long life and enduring vision, forever enjoying heavenly blessings. Hold the talisman and enter fire, and the sunlight will dim, while the Southern Emperor hurls lightning to assist you in driving away filth, heat, and poison, so that cinnabar essence will not overwhelm you. Wear the talisman and ascend mountains, and mountain spirits will flee in terror, while the Central Yellow Great Emperor aids you, and tigers, wolves, and all beasts dare not oppose you. Dwell in cliffs and enter caves, and earthly *qi* will not obstruct you; demons and evil spirits will cower and die, while *wangliang* spirits flee the land. Point the talisman toward metal, and the five weapons will not harm you; the true *qi* of the Western Emperor will share your grove, granting you ten thousand years of life, to drink of jade nectar. Turn your back to metal and face wood, and you shall long preserve great fortune; the numinous *qi* of the Azure Emperor will come to bathe you, restoring your complexion to that of a child, ensuring enduring vision and eternal joy. Ascend peaks to gather mushrooms, and they will not alter your eyesight; the eight minerals will assume their proper forms, allowing you to pluck them at will. To invert heaven and earth lies within the desires of your heart.'

The words of the Supreme Perfected One, conveyed by the Youth of the Eastern Sea, instructed Ling to wear the talisman for protection. The *Upper Preface* of the *Divine Treasure* and the texts on its ingestion and employment are all written in tadpole script, their characters indecipherable. Zichang collected and revealed them, tracing their currents—all flow from above the Five Talismans.

Zichang received oral instructions from the immortal Huolin, who resembled Han Zhong. Thus, Zichang said: 'At sunset, when the sun has set in the west, depart the world to become neighbors. With like minds and shared devotion to the Dao, even mortals may become flying immortals. If Tai Bai harbors dual intentions, the external becomes his root. Ascend to heaven and soar through the void—this is my teacher and lord. He taught me to ingest the Three Luminaries—the Three Luminaries being the sun, moon, and stars. *Giant victory* is another name for the Three Luminaries. Lezi delighted in Zichang’s receipt of the immortal’s method, taking *giant victory* as primary, hence calling it the Three Luminaries. He bestowed upon me the *Numinous Secret Text*—the *Divine Treasure Five Talismans*. A talisman is a classic. Purify yourself in fasting to descend the Five Emperors, and for ten thousand years you may remain eternally whole.'

Zichang’s oral instructions: 'Fast for three days to summon the Heavenly Emperors of the Five Directions; when sincerity is perfected, the perfected ones will surely descend. The purpose lies in reverence, and longevity depends on devotion to the Dao. With cinnabar and ink, draw the pledge of faith—five times eight makes one proclamation.' Long ago, Ling received this from the Youth of the Eastern Sea, who instructed him to cut five feet of silk from Nanhe, to be taken as a token of trust and a contract. Cut five feet of silk from Bilin as a covenant against leakage. *Nanhe* signifies slander; *Bilin* signifies green. The ancients prized their hair and skin, hence used pearls and jade to honor them; they revered their four limbs, hence entrusted them to silk. To exalt the Dao and preserve the body’s spirits—this is the teaching of the immortal officials.

The celestial texts and methods are transmitted once every forty years—five times eight is their number. To transmit them without adhering to this time limit is to violate the decrees of the Heavenly Capital of the Dark Metropolis, as has already been set forth for later generations. Be cautious, be cautious."

The swan-goose of a thousand years’ plumage is used to summon the celestial perfected. The *honglu* is a chariot-drawn bird. With a lifespan of a thousand years, the ancients offered it to summon the celestial spirits. It is also called the *jia’e*, the *Heavenly Canopy*, or the *White Swan*. If this bird is unavailable, the crane may be used instead, for the crane is also called *hong* and likewise lives a thousand years. The *jia* does not kill living things, yet venomous creatures submit to it—such is its nature that repels evil. In old age, its cry remains clear—such is the purity of its spirit and qi. To summon the celestial beings, one must use a refined bird, for like seeks like, and descent is assured. These are the essential words of Zichang. Yet his phrasing is subtly veiled, concealing and revealing the master’s name. Pondering it slowly, one discerns that his master was Han Zhong.

The rites of offering and invocation are set forth below. Those who aspire to the Dao and seek life should simplify their clothing and diet, devoting filial piety to the celestial spirits. If sincerity is utterly exhausted, who can say one will not attain the Dao? Having prepared as a master and personally verified the divine, I speak again of these matters with caution.

A seat should be arranged without fixed orientation, placed wherever convenient. One should purify oneself with a three-day fast, offering in a quiet chamber or upon a courtyard altar. The rites are performed at midnight, with all others excluded from the place. Invoke the celestial officials with whispered words, receiving transmission with a sincere heart.

First, burn the incense of the Five Gatherings and observe where the fragrant smoke drifts. If the qi rises straight upward, the Yellow Emperor of the Center descends first. If it flows eastward, the Bluegreen Emperor descends first. If it flows southward, the Red Emperor descends first. If it flows westward, the White Emperor descends first. If it flows northward, the Black Emperor descends first. If the qi scatters and mingles in a tangled profusion, the divine maidens arrive first.

Arrange five fires side by side before the seat, adjusting the flames and incense. Observe the rising smoke closely. If the numinous light manifests in the lamp’s glow, and the focused mind reveals signs in dreams, then the true spirits have indeed come. If, despite this, the true spirits cannot be made to descend and one still returns to decay in the yellow springs, how could I, Ling, and Zichang bear such guilt in the celestial realms? Yet if the heart is not fully devoted and the quest for life remains uncertain, merely hoping for an extended response while seeking the reward of celestial perfected—such efforts are in vain.

Prepare one plump bird, and wine in no less than three *dou*, ensuring it is clear, pure, and excellent. Arrange eleven cups, all clean and fine. Use three trays: two holding five cups each, and one holding a single cup. The tray with one cup should be placed below the five cups, with five incense fires aligned before it. The remaining wine is placed in a separate vessel before the seat. Arrange the meat according to the cups, with any excess meat on a separate tray before the seat.

Display the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Lingbao* behind the seat, rolled backward to resemble celestial script. *Baopuzi* says: After ascending a sacred mountain and receiving the scriptures from a master, one who wishes to carry them on the body for reverence performs this offering.

Tear five feet of crimson silk from *Nanhe* and place it on the seat behind. Tear five feet of green silk from *Bilin* and place it above the seat. Cover the crimson silk so that the talisman rests between the red and green, serving as a token of trust.

Offer fruits according to what is available, but avoid the five pungent vegetables and dishes prepared with pork fat. Spread a single mat. Blend five kinds of incense. If the offering is made upon a courtyard altar, set up screens on all four sides to avoid wind, for wind disrupts the numinous qi. Use a small fire, covering its flame with wax to prevent excessive brightness, for bright light scatters the numinous qi.

Dress in full attire, fasten your sash, and kneel to invoke. If in the mountains without proper robes, this may be omitted. With subdued breath and measured voice, recite the invocation:

On this day, month, and year, in the commandery, county, village, and hamlet, I, [name], a man/woman of [age] years, receive the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Supreme Lingbao* from the Daoist [name] of [commandery]. In accordance with the statutes of the Great Dao, I humbly invite the Lords of the Five Emperors.

Having purified myself with a three-day fast, I have prepared the swan-goose bird, purified my body and spirits, and emptied my heart to await the descent of the Supreme Celestial Worthy. May my three hun and seven po, the Perfected of the Three Palaces, ascend to the Nine Celestial Palaces, the Five Outer Realms, the Bluegreen Tooth Heaven, the Vermilion Cinnabar Heaven, the Heaven of the Central Yellow within the Great Emperor’s Mountain, the Bright Stone Heaven, the Dark Nourishing Heaven, the Eight Directions’ Heavens, and the courts of the Perfected of the Five Emperors. I declare my fast and vow to descend to this commandery, county, village, and hamlet, to attend the true qi of the Five Talismans and partake of this modest offering.

After speaking, bow twice, prostrate toward the seat, and remain still for a long while before rising. Then, facing the altar, invoke the supreme deities again:

I humbly invite the descent of the Bluegreen Emperor Lord Lingweiyang of the East, the Lord of the Nine Qi of the Bluegreen Tooth Heaven, the Supreme Perfected King, the Jade Maiden of the Bluegreen Waist, and the various spirit officials of the Eastern Realm.

I humbly invite the descent of the Red Emperor Lord Chifengnu of the South, the Lord of the Three Qi of the Vermilion Cinnabar Heaven, the Venerable Qi Elder, the Great Vermilion Jade Maiden of the Vermilion Palace, and the various spirit officials of the Southern Realm.

I humbly invite the descent of the Yellow Emperor Lord Han Shuniu of the Center, the Supreme Perfected of the Great Emperor, the Perfected of the Yellow Court Zi Dan and Wu Ji, the Heavenly Azure Jade Maiden, and the various spirit officials of the Central Realm.

I humbly invite the descent of the White Emperor Lord Yaopobao of the West, the Lord of the Seven Qi of the Bright Stone Heaven, the Venerable Qi Master, the Supreme White Luminous Jade Maiden, and the various spirit officials of the Western Realm.

I humbly invite the descent of the Black Emperor Lord Yinhouju of the North, the Lord of the Five Qi of the Dark Nourishing Heaven, the Supreme Numinous Lord, the Night-Shining Jade Maiden, and the various spirit officials of the Northern Realm.

I humbly invite the descent of the Emperor Lord Wenming Xia Yu, the Perfected of the Five Sacred Mountains, the spirit officials of the Four Rivers and Watercourses, the Jade Maidens of Earthly Immortals, the Immortal Officials of Luli, and Master Xian.

For each Emperor invoked, bow twice—six bows in total.

When sending off the Emperors, proceed as at the initial invitation, only omit the words "humbly invite" and instead say, "I humbly offer my gratitude to such-and-such Emperor," then bow twice. For welcoming and sending off, perform twelve bows in total, and the jiao-ritual sacrifice is thus concluded.

After the invocation, offer wine, then burn more incense. Slowly declare the following:

"I, born of flesh, a mortal of brittle bone, have seen my descendants grow in this turbid world, where impure qi gathers thickly. My accumulated sins are as vast as rivers and seas, and my transgressions weigh heavily upon me. Since gaining understanding, I have revered the Great Dao and longed for the true qi, finding joy therein. Yet my spirit is weak and feeble, unable to ascend and flow freely. I have always guarded my heart and mind in goodness, daring not to transgress.

I fear even the slightest lapse may cast me into the Nine Springs. Now, by heaven’s grace, I have been granted the honor of beholding the sacred Lingbao scriptures. These true writings are vast and profound, hidden in the Mystic Terrace, and thus I dare not lightly take or wear them, lest I violate the divine statutes.

Today, I perform this fast and offer sacrifice to the Five Emperors and the Venerable Lords, to establish a covenant of spiritual trust. I shall inhale the pledge of this bond, making it my proof and vow, swearing never to leak or disclose it. May heaven cherish and earth embrace it; let it be transmitted only to the worthy, never recklessly bestowed, and made clear in accordance with the statutes.

My resolve is to retreat into the mountains and forests, forsaking worldly glory. Should I wear this talisman and ascend the mountains, may all before me yield—metal shatter and stone split, no herb remain hidden, and my will move freely, unbound by heaven or earth. May mountain spirits submit, tigers and wolves flee, and ghosts and gods serve at my command. May I attain long life and enduring vision, guarded by the numinous qi, with malevolent forces vanquished, plagues and stings averted, and demonic beings driven far away.

Thus, under the protection of heaven’s blessing and the aid of the numinous qi, may the spirits ever guard my body, the Three Corpses dissolve, and the Supreme Thearch bestow boundless grace. The multitude of beings cannot fully express their gratitude for such vast beneficence."

Again, offer wine. If there is anything further to petition, declare it as you wish. This text outlines only the general intent. Then, with incense, send off the spirits.

Upon Mount Laoshan, an inscription was carved in stone,
composed by the immortal Le Zichang,
and transcribed by King Fuchai of Wu.

Dark currents stir crimson waves,
jade-green brilliance illumines Mount Lang.
The morning sun harnesses dawn’s radiance—
how sinuous its verdant splendor!
Wandering clouds descend upon the sun,
whirlwind-light ascends the Three Heavens.
The Numinous Treasure gleams across the Nine Voids,
mysterious clarity resounds amid the mountains.
Yu of Xia ascended the Eight Windows,
dispersing qi that echoed through golden orchids.
From branches, jade boughs tremble;
along currents, the flood’s source is traced.
Supporting the essence, the numinous trunk stands firm,
its hanging leaves weaving abundance.
Vast and distant, the tracks of dragons and phoenixes,
resplendent as the calligraphy of the Nine Heavens.
Gaze upward to gather the essence of the Three Mornings,
preserving the body in eternal peace.
Bend down to sip the Five-Flowered Elixir,
restoring youth to the face.
Soaring in spirit through the Palace of Warmth and Coolness,
how could one know heat or cold?
A thousand autumns resemble a clear dawn,
ten thousand years are but half a day.
Beating wings in the hollow vastness above,
I summon the Numinous Treasure’s court.
The five Thearchs’ chariots arrive in profusion,
all assembling at the edge of the luminous Han.
They inquire of hunger and thirst—
the Dark Spring abounds with flowing cinnabar.
Seeking immortality lies within a square inch of the heart,
the Eight Distances hold no ease or difficulty.
Yet hearing the stench of vermilion gates,
one sighs amid the path’s midst.
Carve this inscription on the shady side of the laboring crag,
where caves and peaks may bear its winding trace.

The Eastern Thearch’s Azure Thearch Talisman of the Numinous Treasure’s Nine Qi Celestial Script
transforms and gives rise to the Red Thearch’s qi.

Mountain-Entering Incantation:
*"Before me, all who stand in ranks—
the nine characters of combat arrayed."*
A perpetual secret incantation,
warding against all perils.

In spring, do not enter the Eastern Marchmount or mountains—
this applies likewise to each month in turn.
Be vigilant.

The Three Heavens’ Numinous Writ,
the True Treasure of the Nine Heavens.

The Xia Emperor Yu compiled this Numinous Treasure writ, one copy concealed within a stone coffer, another within a secluded grotto chamber. When Yu received it from the Perfected One of Mount Zhong, he was instructed: on the day of entering mountains or waters, one must choose a *Preserving Day*, *Righteous Day*, or *Devoted Day*—all highly auspicious, wherein the Dao is readily attained. To enter on a *Restraining Day* or *Striking Day* ensures certain death.

The *Six Gui Days* and *Six Gui Hours*—also called *Celestial Heart* or *Celestial Unity*—are essential for transcending the world. The *Preserving Day* arises when the heavenly stem nurtures the earthly branch, as in *jia-wu* or *yi-si*. The *Righteous Day* arises when the earthly branch nurtures the heavenly stem, as in *ren-shen* or *gui-you*. The *Restraining Day* arises when the heavenly stem overcomes the earthly branch, as in *wu-zi* or *ji-hai*. The *Striking Day* arises when the earthly branch overcomes the heavenly stem, as in *jia-shen* or *yi-you*. Restraining Days may be used for talismanic summons of spirits.

When selecting the *Six Gui Days* and *Six Gui Hours*, all must align with harmony and compliance. Seek by correspondence—this is the oral transmission’s essential method.

For entering mountains with the Numinous Treasure, choose the *Opening* or *Removing Day* of *jia-zi*. Take the entrusted silk strips, interweave them with five-colored threads, each five inches long, and suspend them upon the great stones of renowned mountains—thus shall all aspirations for transcending the world be fulfilled. The seventh day of the third month is most auspicious for mountain entry.

**Eastern Numinous Treasure Talisman and Mandate**
Yu disseminated the Eastern writ, derived from the Southern Thearch’s scripture.

**Southern Numinous Treasure Talisman and Mandate**
Yu disseminated the Southern writ, derived from the Yellow Thearch of *wu-ji*’s scripture.

**Nine Heavens’ King of Chang’an Flying Talisman**
When Daoists wear this, they traverse the *Yang Nine* and *Hundred Six* calamities—no poisons shall afflict them. Formerly, Yu concealed it within a stone coffer, transmitting it to Li Sang, who governed waters, and later to Fu Bochang, Jiazi, Li Kuo, and Ma Ping of Stone Mountain. When the great kalpa arrives, wear it before you; when the lesser kalpa comes, wear it behind.

**Three Heavens’ Supreme Writ for Subduing Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, and Mountain Spirits**
Named the *Eightfold Might Strategy*. When Daoists enter mountains bearing this writ at their elbow, a hundred beasts and mountain spirits shall follow at their left and right. Holding it in hand, all poisonous creatures and mountain spirits shall flee a thousand *li* away.

**Nine Heavens’ Great Mystery Yang-Generating Talisman**
The Old Lord received it from the Supreme Venerable One, inscribed in cinnabar upon white silk, five inches square. After a hundred days of pure fasting, enter the chamber and swallow it—thus shall one escape death and attain long-lasting existence. Should impure qi issue from the mouth, the talisman shall emerge, and death follow. It is also called the *True Contract* or *Eight Dragons’ Writ*.

**Three Heavens’ Great Mystery Yang-Generating Talisman**
For men who swallow it, the method is as above. Should a Daoist seek *corpse liberation*, inscribe it with a divine brush upon wood, grass, a knife, or metal—these shall transform into a human likeness, and the practitioner shall depart.

**Three Heavens’ Great Mystery Yin-Generating Talisman**
For women who swallow it, the method is as above. Should a Daoist seek *corpse liberation*, inscribe it with a divine brush upon wood, grass, a knife, or metal—these shall transform into a human likeness, and the practitioner shall depart.

**The Yellow Thearch’s Supreme Perfected Unity Scripture of the Myriad Heavens’ Names**
Inscribed by the Divine Xuanyuan.

**Method of Drawing the Azure Essence**
At cock’s crow, upon completing the incantation, press the tongue against the upper teeth, lick the lips, rinse the mouth, and swallow thrice. For the cinnabar incantation, press the tongue against the lower teeth, lick the lips, rinse the mouth, and swallow thrice. Upon finishing the central *wu-ji* invocation, curl the tongue upward to pierce the dark gullet, lick the lips, and swallow thrice. After the luminous stone incantation, press the tongue against the upper teeth, lick the lips, rinse the mouth, and swallow thrice. With each swallow, knock the teeth twice seven times. Upon completing the *Xuanzi* incantation, press the tongue beneath itself, draw qi through the nose, and swallow thrice. This is called the Dao of natural fetal breathing through eating and drinking, where each swallow fills the mouth with jade liquid.

The *Supreme Scripture of the Great Unity and True Unity* states: The Three Ones interdepend, though their abodes differ. Some dwell within the Northern Culmen’s Great Abyss, where before them lies the Hall of Light, below the Crimson Palace, above the Florid Canopy, with jade towers layered ten thousandfold. To the left, the Dipper’s Handle; to the right, the Dipper’s Ladle—waves surge and winds rise, dark mushrooms blanket the eaves, clustering thickly. Deep valleys plunge straight down, crimson bamboo flourishes, white jade peaks soar, and sweet springs flow endlessly. Sun and moon cast their radiance, golden censers stand tall. Some reside in the Southern Palace, some in the Gate of Destiny, passing through fire and water, traversing squares to enter circles. Palaces and watchtowers crisscross, curtains and canopies form clouds. Dragons and tigers stand guard in ranks, divine beings gather in throngs. Jade abysses stretch ten thousand fathoms deep—drinking from their springs, knocking jade to abstain from grain, one reverts to youthful countenance. A hundred evils flee afar, legions of spirits are commanded. Long life and enduring vision extend years by the myriad, eyes see clearly, intestines transform into sinew. Should you attain this, you become a Heavenly Immortal. If unworthy, the Dao is not idly transmitted. Keep it secret in practice; be cautious in speech.

In ancient times, the Yellow Thearch Xuanyuan perused the *Celestial August True Unity Scripture* yet failed to grasp the essence of the Three Ones’ true qi. Thus, he journeyed to the four quarters seeking its explication. He then ordered his chariot readied for a distant sojourn, with Changyu as his driver and Limu as his attendant. Eastward he traveled to Green Mound, passing Wind Mountain, where he met the Master of the Purple Palace and received the *Three Augusts’ Inner Writ of Celestial Script*, enabling him to summon the myriad spirits and command legions of numina. Southward he reached the Dark Gorge of Five Mushrooms, ascending Round Ridge beneath the Shade Tree to observe the hundred spirits gathering the blossoms of the *Qian* hexagram. Westward he met Master Central Yellow, who bestowed the method of the Nine Mushrooms. Ascending Kongtong, he received the *Scripture of Spontaneity* from Master Broad Accomplishment. Northward he arrived at Hongti’s summit on Mount Juci, where he met the Great Hidden Lord and the Yellow Canopy Youth, receiving the *Twelve Scrolls of Divine Immortals’ Mushroom Charts*. Returning, he ascended Mount Wangwu, where the Dark Maiden transmitted the *Scripture of the Nine Cycles of Golden Liquor Divine Elixir*. He then journeyed to the Cloud Terrace and Green City Mountains, where he met Master Ning. The master said: “I have attained the Dao and become an Immortal, yet I am not an official of the Three Augusts’ Celestial Perfected. Truly, I do not comprehend this text of the True Unity. Recently, the August Person was dispatched by the Lord of Fusang to govern the Immortal Offices of Mount Emei and has not yet departed. You may inquire of him.”

Thereupon, he traveled to Mount Emei, purified himself for three months, and was granted an audience with the August Person. The August Person’s era was unknown. His body stood nine feet tall, covered in dark fur over a foot long, his hair several inches in length. His dwelling lay beneath a sheer cliff on the mountain’s northern face, its halls wrought of azure jade, its forms of yellow gold. Curtains of patterned silk hung, thousand-fold incense burned. His attendants were all jade maidens of the host of Immortals; three seated guests all styled themselves Perfected Kings of the Great Clarity. As the August Person appeared, platters overflowed with jujubes the size of pint vessels, rice of cinnabar blossoms, interspersed with dried unicorn and phoenix meats. They rinsed their mouths with the numinous nectar of the Vermilion Palace’s Jade Well.

The Yellow Thearch prostrated himself upon arrival, bowing twice with his forehead to the ground before rising. The August Person asked: “What do you seek?” The Yellow Thearch knelt and replied: “I wish to attain long life.” The August Person said: “You already rule the Four Seas—do you also covet immortality? Is this not greed?” The Thearch knelt again: “Without a lord, the myriad peoples would oppress one another. Now I have established laws sufficient to transmit to posterity. Privately, I cherish the Dao and have traversed the Four Seas, fortunate to encounter you, a Perfected Lord. I humbly beg your compassionate instruction.”

“I have seen the scripture of the Perfected One’s consumption of essence, yet I have only perused its text without grasping its meaning, read its words without comprehending its practice. I beseech your teaching.” The August Person was greatly astonished, striking his thigh and sighing deeply. After a long while, he replied: “How did you come to hear of this? This text is the first chapter of the Register of Life, the numinous talisman of High Heaven, the treasure writ of the Supreme. Ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, striding through the void, the body generates water and fire, transforming without constancy—this is the reality of Heavenly Immortality, found only in the Nine Cycles of Golden Liquor Elixir from the Dragon Embryo. Preserving form and abstaining from grain, repelling the myriad evils, commanding ghosts and spirits, attaining long life and enduring vision—only then do the blood vessels flow freely, the intestines transform into sinew. A hundred calamities cannot harm you; your lifespan extends by the myriad. This is found only in the True Unity’s consumption of the Five Sprouts’ Celestial Script. These two matters are governed by the Lord of the Southern Dipper, recorded in the Great Thearch’s key. Unless one is an Immortal, they are revealed but once every forty years, and none may violate the statutes to recklessly divulge them. Moreover, the Queen Mother of the West safeguards this text within the Five Cities, its outer defenses manned by twelve Immortal towers. It is stored in a casket of purple jade, inscribed on tablets of yellow gold, sealed with cinnabar radiance and mushroom grasses, stamped with the Supreme’s Central Seal. Those without Immortal registers may not hear of it. You are not yet permitted to hear Heaven’s sounds upon the earth—now depart from the heterodox.”

The Yellow Thearch bowed deeply and replied: “Formerly, I received the divine elixir from the Dark Maiden but have not yet compounded it. I have only yet to receive the Five Sprouts’ consumption of the true and comprehend the meaning of the true scripture. Fortunate to encounter you today, if you do not bestow the Dao of life, it means I am not destined to transcend the world.”

If one remains unmoved by such sorrow, why cling to this fleeting life? Only implore the compassion that saves all beings.

The Yellow Thearch knocked his head upon the ground until blood flowed and his bowels seemed torn, prostrate for a long while. The August Person descended from the dais to raise him, then gently admonished: “You are one who has truly attained the Dao.” Moreover, the Three Perfected Lords of Great Clarity, witnessing the Thearch’s utmost sincerity, took pity and interceded, saying to the August Person: “This man’s ancestors once endured famine yet denied themselves full sustenance, sharing their meager fare to feed starving birds, laboring to rescue beasts, and sparing their strength to aid all creatures. For forty years they acted thus, their benevolence moving Heaven, their merit overshadowing all things. The Supreme recorded their virtue, and the Nine Heavens preserved their lineage. Thus, the radiance of their fragrant qi now illumines the imperial throne, their power spanning generations, their kindness drawing all to submit. With such goodness already established in his forebears, why withhold the Scripture of the True Sprouts? Moreover, it is through his earnest seeking and karmic affinity that he has met us—you may instruct and perfect him.”

The August Person sighed deeply: “With such goodness in your past lives, how could I withhold it?” He bade the Thearch sit once more, then revealed the essential Dao: “The true scripture you spoke of earlier, whose meaning eludes you, is none other than the qi of Highest Heaven converging within this single body. Once the body is made luminously clear, you may attain long life. Man is the most numinous of living beings, yet he fails to know himself, fails to guard his spirit and repel all evils. Those who know this need not seek protection from celestial deities—for within the body alone is sufficiency. Thus it is said: The body of one man mirrors a kingdom. The chest and abdomen are its palaces; the four limbs, its borders; the joints, its officials. The spirit is the sovereign, blood the ministers, qi the people. Thus, to govern the body is to govern the state. To cherish the people is to secure the kingdom; to conserve qi is to preserve the body. When the people scatter, the kingdom falls; when qi is exhausted, the body dies. What is lost cannot be restored; what is dead cannot live again. Therefore, the perfected ones quell incipient disasters, treat illnesses before they arise, heal before harm is done, and do not chase what has already passed. The people are hard to nurture yet easy to corrupt—thus, weigh authority and virtue to maintain order, sever desires to fortify blood and qi. Then the True Unity abides, the Three Ones are guarded, the body grows robust, and years stretch far. The Mud Pill Palace, Crimson Palace, and Cinnabar Field—these are the Three Ones’ true dwelling. If you guard them, no poison or demon will dare harm you. Rinse with the Flower Pool, consume the Five Sprouts without cease, and you will become an immortal.

My former master received this method from the Perfected King of the Nine Heavens and inscribed it for transmission. Hold it in the mouth—it is called Cinnabar of the Vermilion Bird; draw it from the body—it is called the True Unity. This is the celestial treasure of scriptural text.

At dawn, recite the secret incantation:
*Eastern Blue Sprout, consume the Blue Sprout, drink of the Morning Flower.*
After reciting, press the tongue against the outer upper teeth, lick the lips, rinse the mouth, and swallow thrice.

Next recite:
*Southern Vermilion Elixir, consume the Vermilion Elixir, drink of the Cinnabar Pool.*
After reciting, press the tongue against the outer lower teeth, lick the lips, rinse the mouth, and swallow thrice.

Next recite:
*Central Wu Earth, majestic Mount Tai, consume the essence of qi, drink of the Sweet Spring.*
After reciting, press the tongue against the dark roof of the mouth, draw forth Jade Spring, lick the lips, and swallow thrice.

Next recite:
*Western Luminous Stone, consume the Luminous Stone, drink of the Numinous Fluid.*
After reciting, press the tongue against the upper teeth, lick the lips, and swallow thrice. Then tap the teeth seven times. When all is complete, tap five more times, totaling thirty-six.

Next recite:
*Northern Mystic Essence, consume the Mystic Essence, drink of Jade Nectar.*
After reciting, press the tongue against the lower palate, lick the lips, and swallow thrice. Then inhale deeply through the nose and exhale slowly, repeating this more than five times. The true Dao is now complete.

The Three Perfected Lords added: “We attained immortality by consuming this method. Our former master instructed us to further recite over the Sweet Spring below the mouth’s center:
*White stone, sheer and towering, flows the source spring, surging to nectar. Drink and live long, life’s span ever lengthening.*
These twenty-two words—you may practice them. If you perform this daily, consume the True Unity without cease, swallow the Flower Pool’s essence without pause, and retain inner qi without weariness, you will attain the Dao and cease all grain—achieving perfection in less than a month.

The ancients of dark antiquity lived long because, in the interval between creation and existence, they consumed no grain. The *Great Existence* states: *The Five Grains are chisels that hollow life, rotting the five viscera, hastening death and shortening years. This food enters the mouth—do not hope for longevity. If you desire not to die, keep your intestines free of dregs. If you desire long life, purify your viscera’s qi, draw forth the body’s flower nectar to meet Heaven. With Jade Water in the mouth, mortal and immortal share the same lifespan.*

When the Yellow Thearch had received the teachings, he offered the August Person all he possessed—common dried fruits, preserved meats, and clear wine from the sacred kitchen—vowing never to transmit them, marking a single stroke in parting.

Yu of Xia said: “To know the Cinnabar of the True Unity is to prolong all things. To know the One is to know all. Not to know the One is to know nothing. The One is most noble, the title without peer. The Dao arises from the One; all numbers proceed from it. Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; spirits attain the One and become numinous; earth attains the One and becomes stable; man attains the One and lives. Gold sinks and feathers float; mountains stand and rivers flow. It is unseen, unheard—present when preserved, lost when neglected. Follow it and prosper; defy it and perish. Treasure it, and boundless blessings endure; divulge it, and life withers, qi vanishes.”

Hush, elusive—within it there is form; elusive, hush—within it there is substance: this is called the One.

If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be made clear. When hunger for the One arises, the One provides sustenance; when thirst for the One arises, the One offers drink. The ancients prized this Way of the True One, guarding its words in secrecy.

The One can generate yin and give birth to yang, propelling the cycles of cold and heat. Spring attains it and flourishes; summer attains it and grows; autumn attains it and harvests; winter attains it and stores. Vast, it cannot be concealed within the Six Directions; minute, it cannot be compared to the tip of a hair. The hundred clans use it daily yet do not know it.

Without exertion, without depletion, the One rests in its place. Without haste, without delay, the One abides in its chamber. Able to be at ease, able to be prepared, the One does not depart. Preserve the One with diligence, and the One can commune with spirits. Drink sparingly, eat modestly, and the One lingers to nurture breath. Facing peril without doubt, the One dispels disaster. When heavenly calamity looms, contemplating the One brings deliverance.

To know the One is not difficult; the difficulty lies in persevering to the end. To know the True and not act is the same as not knowing. Seek it without ceasing, and you will ascend to the Nine August Ones. On land, fierce beasts and venomous creatures retreat; in water, demons and dragons withdraw. No being fails to yield; no evil fails to be struck down.

Guard the True, and it remains; leak essence, and it perishes. Feeding on qi, one may live ten thousand years, ever youthful in countenance.

It is further declared: If a person preserves the One, the One also preserves that person. Thus, blades find no edge to strike, and a hundred harms find no opening for their malice. Others may falter, but you stand firm; even in peril, you remain secure.

Is the numinous treasure of the *Lingbao* a mere deception for Daoists? Are the profound tones of the supreme sages not to be trusted by the common people? The fault lies only in the seeker’s shallowness.

Those who come after, deepen your roots—its gate and door are before you.

*Tai Shang Dong Xuan Ling Bao Wu Fu Xu*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.
