**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Essentials of Petitioning with Talismanic Writs**

At cock’s crow, when yang light first divides, face east and knock the teeth nine times. Rub both palms until warm, then wipe the face and eyes nine times with the hands. Look upward and recite while ingesting the Azure Tooth qi.

For the south, face south and follow the same method, knocking the teeth three times.
For the west, face west and do so seven times, as above.
For the center, knock the teeth twelve times and wipe the face and eyes.
For the north, five times, following the same method.

Always at cock’s crow, settle the body and stabilize the spirit, then proceed in order: first ingest the Azure Tooth qi of the east, then the south, then the center, then the west, then the north, as above. When the Five Thearchs are complete, knock the teeth thirty-six times and swallow qi twenty-five times to conclude.

Then recite the general incantation:
*"White rocks, towering in sequence,
Spring founts surge forth with jade nectar.
Drink of it and attain long life,
Lifespan ever extending."*

When finished, roll the tongue around the upper and lower mouth and center, filling the mouth with jade springwater, then swallow three times. Again draw qi twenty-five times, swallowing it fully—thus the Dao is complete.

The method for ingesting the Five Cloud Teeth is recorded in a separate fascicle.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign says: For those cultivating the Dao of flying transcendence, the method of liberation, corpse-liberation and concealed transformation, or the revolving cycles of life and death—roaming freely without constraint in the Great Yin—one must vermilion-inscribe the Jade Characters of the Myriad Heavens’ Ineffable Inner Sounds upon white silk, wear it upon the body, and ingest it according to the text. The heart remains unstained by defilement; the five viscera are harmoniously clear; the six palaces are tranquil and still. Abiding in empty azure and non-action, after eight years one penetrates all heavens, sits and beholds the ten directions, and myriad spirits descend in communion. The body generates jade radiance, and one gallops upon dragon chariots, ascending at dawn.

The transmission of the Jade Chapters of the Supreme Dao occurs once every forty thousand kalpas. The method of practice requires following the above vermilion-inscribed texts according to the seasons’ nodes.

**Spring (First, Second, Third Months):**
Vermilion-inscribe the writ, face the Thearch, and knock the teeth nine times. Recite:
*"Great Brahmā of Flying Heaven, Vairāja of the Eight Directions,
Nine Qi Azure Heaven, all become divine kings.
Five Unions and Eight Assemblies, flowing and resplendent in the Great Void.
Above, they open the Dragon Han, ancestral lineage of divine transcendents.
Below, they part the long night, chambers of the Nine Darks.
They deliver suffering souls, making withered bones glow with life.
The body transforms into feathers, clad in five-colored raiment.
Azure dragons and jade carriages, soaring through empty space.
Today I make this supplication to the Azure Heaven’s dawning yang.
May all vows be fulfilled, harmonizing with qi as one.
Ascend into formlessness, eternally preserved without end."*

When finished, ingest the writ and swallow qi eight times to conclude.

**Summer (Fourth, Fifth, Sixth Months):**
Vermilion-inscribe the writ, face the Thearch, and knock the teeth eight times. Recite:
*"Heavenly writs spread in arrays, Brahmā practices in Crimson Clarity.
Above, they open the Eight Paths; the Five Unions communicate with spirits.
The Great Cycle initiates its term; the Cavern Yang refines essence.
Jade texts gleam and shine; the Three Luminaries illuminate themselves.
Below, they deliver life and death, all who receive form.
Today is most auspicious; the Great Sage attends the court.
Nine nights open the windows; dark chambers grow bright and clear.
The Three Evils cease; my Dao naturally fulfills.
The Five Thearchs protect and deliver, ascending to the Flourishing Capital.
In the Seven Treasures Grove, eternally enjoying kalpas of longevity."*

When finished, ingest the writ and swallow qi eight times to conclude.

**Autumn (Seventh, Eighth, Ninth Months):**
Vermilion-inscribe the writ, face the Thearch, and knock the teeth seven times. Recite:
*"Flying Mystery’s Eight Assemblies, congealing qi to form perfection.
Sixty-four characters, root of the Numinous Heaven.
They open and deliver life and death, restoring withered bones to humanity.
Dark souls disperse, receiving qi from the Supreme Mystery.
Today is a time of celebration; ten thousand vows unfold.
Myriad spirits gather in communion; I vow to become transcendent.
Scenery unites with the Dao; I vow to become divine.
Attaining to ride upon plain clouds, ascending to the Thearch’s dawn.
Delighting in the Seven Treasures, befriending perfected beings."*

When finished, ingest the writ and swallow qi eight times to conclude.

**Winter (Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth Months):**
Vermilion-inscribe the writ, face the Thearch, and knock the teeth five times. Recite:
*"Jade characters open the dark; flowing and resplendent, they ascend the gate.
Eight qi congeal perfection; Brahmā practices in luminous clouds.
Divine kings initiate radiance; the Three Images part the Cavern.
Five colors drift and linger, illuminating my soul alone.
Today, in timely convergence, I look upward to the Thearch.
Open and pardon, issue the writ, bestow upon me the true text.
Jade moisture intermingles and irrigates; the five palaces generate fragrance.
Feathers transform; I ride the luminous chariot at dawn.
Emerging from darkness into formlessness, transcendence occurs naturally.
Seven ancestors return together, rejoicing in the Upper Prime."*

When finished, ingest the writ and swallow qi eight times to conclude.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign says: These recitations are the qi of the Four Assemblies and the sounds of the Eight Harmonies, natural chapters. Those who practice them will have the distant heavens echo their chants; the Three Realms prepare rites; myriad spirits gird their sashes and attend the numinous writs.

Ingesting according to the seasonal nodes, reciting, and swallowing qi—after a hundred days, the heavens record it, the Earth Officials erase the ledgers. After eight years, divine perfected beings descend of their own accord. The body generates jade radiance, penetrating the dark and empty. Sitting, one beholds the natural; the dead corpse revives, returning to the womb and becoming human again. The revolving wheel ceases not; in life and death, one attains transcendence.

The Dao is revered, the method wondrous—practiced once in ten thousand kalpas. Those who lightly divulge or carelessly reveal it will bear the burden of the river’s source, suffering the wind-knives for ten thousand kalpas, never attaining transcendence. The ancient statutes of the Illuminated Perfected decree that this must be kept secret.

When entering and exiting the Azure Heaven of the East, one should always knock the teeth nine times, envisioning nine-colored dragons leading and following, with nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body. Secretly recite:

The Crimson Clarity unfolds the Chart, the Eight Qi return to the True. Governing the Mystic Tablet, the Great Divine Lord of the Azure Thearch, his transformative flow extends beyond the Nine Realms, entwining my body. The numinous sounds of the Eight Scripts, sixty-four chapters in all, illumine Heaven and Earth, merging with me to attain transcendence. The dragon-drawn chariot arrives, ascending to the imperial terrace.

This done, draw in qi and swallow nine times to conclude.

When entering and exiting the Vermilion Heaven of the South, one should always knock the teeth three times, envisioning the Vermilion Bird and phoenix soaring ahead, with three layers of crimson clouds enveloping the body. Secretly recite:

The Three Qi linger and return, clouds and phoenix come in flight. The Jade Tone’s eight characters blaze in the Purple Tenuity. On this auspicious day of great rejoicing, my Dao opens wide. I partake of cinnabar’s sweet nectar, inhaling the numinous radiance. My body generates water and fire, clad in crimson and feathered robes. Ascending the void with mystic steps, my feet tread the phoenix ladder. Circling the Eight Heavens, seven generations follow in my wake.

This done, draw in qi and swallow three times to conclude.

When entering and exiting the White Heaven of the West, one should always knock the teeth seven times, envisioning the White Tiger and lion guiding left and right, with seven layers of white clouds enveloping the body. Secretly recite:

The Seven Qi gather the numinous, the Eight Heavenly Honored Gods. The White Tiger steers the chariot, the lion bears the shafts. The Seven Qi entwine me, refining me into an immortal. My body emits golden radiance, my lungs reflect the white clouds. Inner and outer transform, ascending into the Cavernous Gate. Seven ancestors escape the night, the Nine Darks release their souls!

The Three Calamities and Five Sufferings are severed forever, cutting away evil roots. Together they rejoice in the abode of blessings, receiving the felicity of the natural. For a hundred million kalpas, they attain deliverance, enduring with the turning of the ages.

This done, draw in qi and swallow seven times to conclude.

When entering and exiting the Mysterious Heaven of the North, one should always knock the teeth five times, envisioning the soaring tortoise and feathered canopy flourishing left and right, with five layers of black clouds enveloping the body. Divine lads and jade maidens in feathered robes and flying garments attend before and behind. Secretly recite:

The Mysterious Heaven lingers and returns, streaming light to the Upper Clarity. The Great Possession initiates its course, the eight characters exalted and bright. The soaring mystery settles into emptiness, the Cavernous Tone arises spontaneously. The Five Qi entwine me, irrigating my form. Crowned and girded with the Northern Host, I receive refinement in the Cavernous Numinous. My kidney palace transforms into an immortal, inner and outer radiant with essence. Flying through the Three Realms, I roam and feast in the Purple Court. Seven ancestors rejoice together, delighting in kalpas of age. In the Forest of Seven Treasures, I return to the womb and renew my form. The long night vanishes in death, the Southern Bureau records my name. On the Yellow Register and White Tablet, I attain eternal life through the ages.

This done, draw in qi and swallow five times to conclude.

If one truly desires the Dao, to become an immortal and never die, one must first expel the Three Worms and the corpse-crawling parasite beneath the heart. Each day, perform 360 breath-cycles of qi-ingestion, swallowing once every thirty cycles, resting once every ninety cycles, and doing this four times daily.

Regularly at midnight and cock’s crow, recite:

In the East, the Azure Molar—consume the Azure Molar, drink from the Morning Flower.

This done, swallow three times to conclude.

In the South, the Vermilion Cinnabar—consume the Vermilion Cinnabar, drink from the Cinnabar Pool.

This done, swallow three times to conclude.

In the Central Wilds, the towering Mount Tai—consume the Primordial Qi, drink from the Sweet Spring.

This done, swallow three times to conclude.

In the West, the Luminous Stone—consume the Luminous Stone, drink from the Numinous Brook.

This done, swallow three times to conclude.

In the North, the Mysterious Nourishment—consume the Mysterious Nourishment, drink from the Jade Nectar.

This done, swallow three times to conclude.

After thirty days of this practice, the Three Worms will die, the corpse-crawling parasite will depart, and the true spirit and true qi will settle naturally. The corpse-crawling parasite will no longer return to the heart, and you shall become an immortal.

The twenty-four characters above summon the Nine Heavenly Thearchs and the registers of divine immortals.

Those who study the Dao of immortality should, on the first *jiazi* day of their life cycle coinciding with the Beginning of Spring, inscribe in green on a white poplar tablet their year, month, and name, then cast it beneath an isolated cliff. After nine years, the immortal officials will arrive, and you shall attain true transcendence.

The thirty-two characters above should be inscribed in vermilion on a white tablet on the first *jiazi* day of one’s life cycle coinciding with the Beginning of Summer, recording one’s name, year, and month, then cast upon a sacred mountain’s peak. After nine years, the immortal officials will arrive, and you shall attain flying transcendence.

Regularly on the first *jiazi* day of one’s life cycle coinciding with the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, or Winter Solstice, inscribe in yellow on a white tablet, recording one’s name, year, month, and day, then cast it upon a sacred mountain’s ridge.

After five years, the immortal officials will arrive, dispatching five Jade Maidens of the Great Mystery, and your name shall be inscribed in the registers of immortals.

To cultivate the Azure Molar and practice the method of guiding the Nine Qi of the Azure Heaven of the East, regularly at cock’s crow on the day of the Beginning of Spring, enter the chamber, face east, and perform nine bows. Seated evenly, knock the teeth nine times, envisioning the Azure Numinous First Elder Lord of the Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove in the East—surnamed Yan, named Kai Ming, styled Ling Wei Yang—his form nine inches tall, wearing a crown of azure essence-jade, clad in a nine-qi azure feathered flying robe, riding a chariot drawn by green dragons, bearing the *baobu* banner, attended by the nine hundred myriad officials of the Jia-Yi Hu-Lao’s Bureau, descending from the Nine Qi Azure Heaven into the chamber. In an instant, he transforms and generates azure qi, dense as clouded mist, enveloping your form and entering through the mouth, descending directly into the liver palace.

Next, envision Jupiter shining brightly in the East, its light illuminating your body, all made distinct and clear. Then open your eyes and recite while looking upward:

Scattering radiance and streaming fragrance, refining and irrigating my form.
Above, I feast on morning clouds; I ingest and guide the essence of wood.

Cultivate and nourish the azure sprouts, preserving and securing decrepit age.
The liver palace fills to overflowing, jade mushrooms grow of themselves.
Years reverse and kalpas halt; complexion returns to that of a child.
The five qi merge and harmonize, heaven and earth endure as one.

When finished, guide the azure qi and swallow it nine times, then cease. Proceed to ingest the twelve vermilion-script jade characters of the eastern direction. These twelve characters are the names of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven. Guide and draw the Nine Qi of the Azure Emperor, and consume the azure sprouts—all inscribed in vermilion on white paper, visualized and then ingested in one draught.

Regularly at cock’s crow, when yang light first divides, face east and click the teeth nine times. Rub the palms until warm, then with them wipe the face and eyes nine times. Look upward and recite:

Azure sprouts of the East, consume the azure sprouts, drink of the morning radiance.

When finished, with the tongue stroke the outer side of the upper teeth, lick the lips three times, and let jade spring fill the mouth. Swallow it three times, then guide the azure qi and swallow it nine times, allowing it to settle within the liver. Thus is the Dao complete.

To cultivate and nourish the cinnabar sprouts, guide and draw the Three Qi of the Vermilion Heaven of the South. Regularly on the day of the Summer Solstice at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face south, and perform three bows. Sit upright and click the teeth three times. Envision the Southern Treasure of Brahma, the Radiant Yang Cinnabar Numinous True Elder Lord, whose surname is Dongfu, personal name Jiyan, and style Chifiaonu. His form is three inches in height, his head crowned with a vermilion turban and jade diadem, his body clad in a feathered flying robe of the Three Qi Vermilion. He rides a vermilion dragon-drawn jade chariot, raises a vermilion banner, and is followed by three hundred myriad officials of the Bing-Ding Yue-Lao, descending from the Three Qi Vermilion Heaven into the chamber. In an instant, he transforms and generates vermilion qi, blazing bright as the brilliance of fire, enveloping your form and entering through the mouth, descending directly into the heart palace.

Next, envision Mars shining brightly in the South, its light illuminating your body, all made distinct and clear. Then open your eyes and recite while looking upward:

Three Qi Vermilion Heaven, vermilion palace numinous youth.
Primordial Elder of the Highest Beginning, riding a chariot drawn by vermilion dragons.
Vermilion feathered flying robe, brocade mantle of radiant light.
Commanding and directing the celestial officials, regulating and guiding yin and yang.
The Three Qi exhale their splendor, irrigating my crimson palace.
The Red Child preserves and secures; refining the sprouts adorns the countenance.
Above, I feast on vermilion dawn; jade mushrooms fill to abundance.
Years reverse and kalpas halt; decrepit frame returns to youth.
Lifespan endures with heaven and earth, eternally enjoying boundless existence.
Body generates water and fire, transforming in a hundred ways.

When finished, guide the vermilion qi and swallow it three times, then cease. Proceed to ingest the twelve vermilion-script jade characters of the southern direction. These twelve characters are the names of the Three Qi Vermilion Heaven. Guide and draw the Three Qi of the Vermilion Emperor, and consume the cinnabar sprouts—all inscribed in vermilion on white paper, visualized and then ingested in one draught.

Regularly at cock’s crow, when yang light first divides, face south and click the teeth three times. Rub the palms until warm, then with them wipe the face three times. Look upward and recite:

Vermilion cinnabar of the South, consume the vermilion cinnabar, drink from the cinnabar pool.

When finished, with the tongue stroke the outer side of the lower teeth, lick the lips and rinse the mouth, letting jade spring fill the mouth. Swallow it three times, then guide the vermilion qi and swallow it three times, allowing it to settle within the heart palace. Thus is the Dao complete.

To cultivate and nourish the yellow sprouts, guide and draw the Twelve Qi of the Central Yellow Heaven of Wu-Ji. Regularly on the days of the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, and Winter Solstice at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face the center, and perform twelve bows. Sit upright and click the teeth twelve times. Envision the Central Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Primordial Elder Lord, whose surname is Tongban, personal name Yuanshi, and style Hanshuniu.

He rides a yellow dragon-drawn jade chariot, raises a yellow banner, and is followed by one hundred twenty myriad officials of the Wu-Ji Cang-Lao, descending from the Twelve Qi Yellow Heaven into the chamber. In an instant, he transforms and generates yellow qi, billowing forth like luminous clouds exhaling their radiance, enveloping your form and entering through the mouth, descending directly into the spleen palace.

Next, envision Saturn shining brightly in the center of heaven, its light illuminating your body, all made distinct and clear. Then open your eyes and recite while looking upward:

At the Central Yellow Great Mountain, the primordial qi lingers and swirls.
Above resides the Primordial Elder, governing the four directions.
He harnesses yellow dragons, clad in a five-colored feathered robe,
Guiding the Nine Heavens, turning the wheel of the celestial pivot.
Saturn shines resplendent, its streaming light scattering radiance.
Jade blossoms and fragrant mushrooms fill and overflow the four directions.
They bathe and irrigate my body, the spleen palace blooming fresh and bright.
They nourish the teeth and consume essence, all spirits converging in unity.
They inspect the hun and restrain the po, refining the eight mights of immortality.
Inner and outer shine alike, ever-living and unwaning.
Communing with the real and penetrating the numinous, ascending into the Grand Tenuity.

When finished, draw in yellow qi and swallow twelve times, then ingest the sixteen-character vermilion script of the Central Jade Text. These sixteen characters are the names of the Central Yellow Heaven. Guide and lead the twelve qi of the Yellow Emperor, consume the yellow sprouts—all written in vermilion on white paper. After visualizing, suddenly ingest them.

Regularly at cock’s crow, when yang light first divides, face the king, click the teeth twelve times, rub both palms until warm, and with them wipe the face and eyes twelve times. Look upward and recite:

Consuming essence and qi, drinking from the sweet spring.

When finished, stir the tongue beneath the dark jade channel, gather the jade spring to lick the lips, swallow three times, then draw in yellow qi twelve times to settle within the spleen palace. This completes the method.

In an instant, he transforms and generates white qi, billowing forth like luminous clouds veiling the heavens, enveloping your form and entering through the mouth, descending directly into the lung palace.

Next, envision Venus shining brightly in the west, its light illuminating your body, all made distinct and clear. Then open your eyes and recite while looking upward:

The Seven Golden Gates of the Numinous Spirit gleam radiantly in the Western Florescence.
At their center dwells the White Sovereign, the primordial household of the Origin.
He harnesses white dragons, the seven qi towering majestically.
Pacing the Jade Gate, he scatters luminous crimson auroras.
Venus emits its splendor, fragrant mushrooms overflow in abundance.
The Mystic Grotto suffuses my body, nourishing my white sprouts.
Bright stones gleam with fresh radiance, enduring through ten thousand kalpas without decay.

Conclude by drawing in white qi seven times and swallowing it. Then ingest the twelve vermilion-script jade characters of the West.
These twelve characters are the names of the Western Seven Qi Plain Heaven.
For guiding and drawing in the White Thearch’s seven qi and ingesting the white sprouts, all are written in vermilion script on white paper. After visualization, promptly consume them.

The method for cultivating the Mystic Sprouts and guiding the Five Qi of the Mystic Heaven:
Regularly on the day of the Winter Solstice at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face north, and complete the five rites.

In an instant, he transforms and generates black qi, its brilliance layered and cascading like the radiance of shooting stars, enveloping your form and entering through the mouth, descending directly into the kidney palace.

Next, envision Mercury shining brightly in the north, its light illuminating your body, all made distinct and clear. Then open your eyes and recite while looking upward:

In the northern Mystic Heaven of the Five Qi, numinous essence scatters and spreads.
Above resides the Great Spirit, the Primordial Elder of Original Essence.
He rides a dragon, raises his banner, and roams the Upper Capital in joyous feast.
This day is supremely auspicious, as radiant blessings unfold in glory.

Jade maidens of the Mystic Gulf bathe my form,
filling and fortifying the kidney palace, decayed teeth firming anew.
The Five Palaces receive the true, ascending to commune with the divine.
The Five Elders descend to welcome, and the Dao of immortality is swiftly attained.
Transforming water and fire, clad in azure-feathered robes,

The northern Mystic Essence, consumed as Mystic Nourishment,
drunk as Jade Elixir.

For all who cultivate the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s true writs, visualize the spirits and invoke the immortals—whatever desires they seek shall be granted in due time. The Perfected of the Nine Heavens will attend their chamber, and they shall attain the body of divine immortality. This should be performed on the days of *jiǎyín* or *yǐmǎo* after the Beginning of Spring: bathe, purify, and fast, then at dawn enter the chamber, face east, bow nine times, sit upright, and click the teeth nine times to awaken the body’s spirits.

Conclude by closing the eyes and visualizing the Azure Emperor Lord of Mount Tai in the East, his surname, personal name, and style; his form nine inches and nine-tenths in height, crowned with a sapphire jade *tongtian* diadem, clad in an azure-feathered flying robe, riding a green dragon, attended by twelve Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist. From the east he descends into your chamber. After a long while, the Azure Emperor transforms into the form of a newborn infant within a cloud of green qi, following the qi into your mouth and proceeding directly to the liver. Visualize the heart generating red qi to encircle and envelop the liver palace; the green and red qi blend in primordial chaos, layering like auspicious clouds of intertwining mist. Feel the liver suffused with warmth, then swallow nine times. Look upward and recite:

The Nine Gates of the Azure Heaven,
within resides the Primordial Sovereign.
Exiting and entering the Three Clarities, reveling in the Flowery Chambers.
Pacifying and guarding the numinous peak, dispatching and directing Goumang.
Above, governing the azure mists, nine thousand myriad layers.
Drawn by a feathered chariot, twelve flying dragons.
To the left, the Azure-Waisted attend; to the right, divine youths guard.
Holding jade tablets and scrolls, inscribed with azure writs.
Verifying and recording immortal names, reporting to the Upper Palace.
Today is most auspicious; I present my petition.
My body bears the vermilion script, my name enters the imperial hall.
I vow to attain the divine, I vow to become immortal—
pray record me in the celestial registers.
Turn your cloud-borne chariot, descend into my chamber.
The Three Qi merge and blend, transforming into an infant’s form.
Pacify and govern the liver palace, summoning radiant splendor.
Numinous brilliance flows and bathes, my face assumes a golden countenance.
Seated, I attain spontaneity, communing with the divine.
My body achieves longevity, boundless as heaven and earth.

Conclude by drawing in green qi and swallowing nine times. Practicing this method for nine years will summon nine Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist and the divine officials of Mount Tai in the East to descend, conveying your prayers and fulfilling all wishes. Petitions ascend to the Nine Heavens, and the karmic records of your parents’ transgressions—assigned as servitude to Mount Tai—shall be dissolved. The divine and the mortal will be newly bound, sins erased, and you shall ascend to the Hall of Blessings. This method is wondrous and profound, a bridge between life and death.

Regularly on the days of *bǐngwǔ* or *dīngsì* after the Beginning of Summer: bathe, purify, and fast, then at noon enter the chamber, face south, bow three times, sit upright, and click the teeth three times to awaken the body’s spirits.

Conclude by closing the eyes and visualizing the Vermilion Emperor Lord of Mount Heng in the South, his surname, personal name, and style; his form three inches and three-tenths in height, crowned with a cinnabar jade *tongtian* diadem, clad in a vermilion-feathered flying robe, riding a red dragon, attended by twelve Jade Maidens of the Vermilion Jade. From the south he descends into your chamber. After a long while, the Vermilion Emperor transforms into the form of a newborn infant within a cloud of red qi, following the qi into your mouth and proceeding directly to the heart. Visualize the spleen generating yellow qi to encircle and envelop the heart palace; the yellow and red qi blend in primordial chaos, blazing like the radiant light of flames. Feel the heart suffused with warmth, then swallow three times. Look upward and recite:

The Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heaven,
the southern Jade Gate above.
Within resides the Great Spirit, the Vermilion Emperor, Numinous Lord.
Clad in cinnabar, bearing talismans, flying script on feathered skirts.
Riding a crimson dragon, jade reins descending through clouds.
On the numinous peak of Mount Heng in the south, myriad spirits hold him in highest reverence.
Exiting and entering the Three Clarities, ascending to feast in the Nine Mysteries.
The Vermilion Jade attend and serve; jade youths guard the true.
Holding jade tablets and records, inscribed with crimson registers.
Verifying and recording immortal ranks, reporting their weight to the heavens.
Today, Great King, the numinous peak opens the path to immortality.
Turn your exalted spirit, descend through my three gates.
Transform into an infant, pacifying the heart and settling the hun-soul.
The two qi merge and blend, entwining my life’s root.
Ever with Zhurong, riding the luminous clouds,
roaming the southern slopes, enduring as heaven and earth.

Conclude by drawing in red qi and swallowing three times. Practicing this method will summon the divine officials of Mount Heng in the South to descend, dispatching three Jade Maidens of the Vermilion Jade to serve you, conveying petitions and fulfilling all requests. The karmic records of your parents’ transgressions—assigned as servitude to Mount Heng—shall be dissolved, punishments released, and names expunged, ascending to the celestial offices. This method is wondrous and profound, unlocking the passage between life and death.

Regularly on the days of *wùchén*, *wùxū*, *jǐchǒu*, or *jǐwèi* after the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, or Winter Solstice: bathe, purify, and fast, then at sunrise enter the chamber, face the sovereign, bow twelve times, sit upright, and click the teeth twelve times to awaken the body’s spirits.

Close your eyes and visualize the Yellow Emperor of the Central Peak, Mount Songgao—his surname, given name, and courtesy name—standing twelve inches tall, crowned with a Yellow Jade *Tongtian* Treasure Diadem, clad in a yellow feathered flying robe, riding a yellow dragon. Twelve Yellow Plain Jade Maidens accompany him as he descends from the Central Peak into your chamber. After a while, the Yellow Emperor transforms into the form of a newborn infant, nestled within yellow qi, which follows the breath into your mouth and proceeds directly to the Spleen Palace. Envision the lungs generating white qi to encircle and envelop the Spleen Palace, where the yellow and white qi intermingle in primordial chaos, swirling like yellow clouds across the heavens. When you feel a warm sensation suffusing the spleen, swallow twelve times.

Then recite the prayer while looking upward:
*"Central Heaven’s Yellow Origin, sovereign of the Four Numinous Ones,
Mountain of Wu and Ji, primordial essence of the Supreme Beginning.
Great God Yellow Emperor, riding a flying chariot,
Twelve Yellow Dragons ascend to feast in the Three Clarities.
Jade Maidens attend as guards, divine youths serve as messengers.
Unsealing the mountain to inspect the charts, recording immortals’ names for confirmation.
Roaming the Central Peak, white jade unfurls its numen.
Returning in a winding descent, streaming to irrigate my form.
Merging and transforming, the aged emperor becomes an infant.
Securely settled in the Yellow Palace, the treasury flourishes in splendor,
My body sprouts wondrous hairs, radiant within and without.
True ones commune, pathways open to the Nine Clarities—
My heart attains the yellow chariot, soaring to the Jade Court."*

Conclude by drawing in yellow qi and swallowing twelve times.

Practicing this method will summon the divine officials of the Central Peak’s Five Emperors to descend into your chamber, dispatching twelve Yellow Plain Jade Maidens to serve as your spirit-mediums, opening the gates to report your prayers to the Nine Heavens. The karmic records of your parents’ transgressions—assigned as servitude to the Central Peak—shall be dissolved, punishments released, and names expunged, ascending to the immortal registers. Freed from the Earthly Offices, they rise into the Hall of Blessings, unlocking the passage between life and death and bestowing boundless deliverance.

Regularly on the days of *gēngshēn* or *xīnyǒu* after the Beginning of Autumn: bathe, purify, and fast, then at dusk enter the chamber, face west, bow seven times, sit upright, and click the teeth seven times to awaken the body’s spirits. Close your eyes and visualize the White Emperor of the Western Peak, Mount Huayin—his surname, given name, and courtesy name—standing seven inches and seven parts tall, crowned with a White Jade *Tongtian* Treasure Diadem, clad in a white feathered flying robe, riding a white dragon. Twelve White Plain Jade Maidens accompany him as he descends from the Western Peak into your chamber. After a while, the White Emperor transforms into the form of a newborn infant, nestled within white qi, which follows the breath into your mouth and proceeds directly to the Lung Palace. Envision the kidneys generating black qi to encircle and envelop the Lung Palace, where the white and black qi intermingle in primordial chaos, layering like auspicious clouds across the heavens. When you feel a warm sensation suffusing the lungs, swallow seven times.

Then recite the prayer while looking upward:
*"Heaven of the Seven Qi, golden hall of the White Sovereign,
Great God White Emperor, securely settled in the West.
Spiritual mountain of Huayin, hailed as the Divine King.
White feathered skirts flutter, banners command the dragons,
Roaming the dark azure, entering and exiting the Flowery Palace.
Overseeing the immortal registers, arranging the records of all directions.
On this auspicious day, the myriad sages feast upon the peaks,
Roaming the Nine Radiant Clouds, scattering their luminous glow.
Golden essence gleams, white stones surge in abundance.
Unsealing the mountain to observe the numen, spirits spread to the four quarters.
Wishing for the Dao, wishing for immortality,
Wishing for life, wishing for longevity.
When the supreme wish is fulfilled, naught shall not prosper.
Gathering and refining the perfected, transforming my form,
Changing and completing myself, soaring in unison with qi.
My body flies, my bones grow light, ascending to the Purple Chamber."*

Conclude by drawing in white qi and swallowing seven times.

Regularly on the days of *rénzǐ* or *guǐhài* after the Beginning of Winter: bathe, purify, and fast, then at midnight enter the chamber, face north, bow five times, sit upright, and click the teeth five times to awaken the body’s spirits. Close your eyes and visualize the Black Emperor of the Northern Peak, Mount Heng—his surname, given name, and courtesy name—standing five inches and five parts tall, crowned with a Dark Jade *Tongtian* Treasure Diadem, clad in a black feathered flying robe, riding a black dragon. Twelve Great Mysterious Jade Maidens accompany him as he descends from the Northern Peak into your chamber. After a while, the Black Emperor transforms into the form of a newborn infant, nestled within black qi, which follows the breath into your mouth and proceeds directly to the Kidney Palace. Envision the liver generating blue-green qi to encircle and envelop the Kidney Palace, where the blue-green and black qi intermingle in primordial chaos, swirling like azure clouds in the distant mist. When you feel a warm sensation suffusing the kidneys, swallow five times.

Then recite the prayer while looking upward:
*"Heaven of the Five Qi, primordial essence flowing from the Supreme Beginning..."*

Gather qi and congeal spirit, calling it the Immortal Hut.
Securely settled at Northern Heng, where the Black Emperor roams.
Wandering and feasting in the northern wastes, riding a dragon-drawn chariot.
Today is most auspicious—ten thousand spirits unfurl the chart.
The Five Qi linger and circle; felicitous clouds spread in all four directions.
Immortal youths hold tablets, the Supreme Mystery transmits the talisman.
Inscribe my name in the immortal register, inscribed in golden script above.
Returning to the true and winding descent, merging with the infant form.
The two qi intertwine and weave, thoroughly irrigating my body.
The Dark and Hidden leads by the hand, with immortals as companions.
Eternally partaking of Heaven and Earth, through ten thousand kalpas without end.

Conclude by drawing in black qi and swallowing five times.
