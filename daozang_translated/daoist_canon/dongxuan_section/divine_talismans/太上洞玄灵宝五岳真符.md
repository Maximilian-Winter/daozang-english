**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Talismans of the Five Marchmounts**

The *Chart of the Divine Immortals* states:
The numen of the Eastern Marchmount is called Mount Tai, its primordial *qi* ascending to connect with Jupiter. Its mountain is green. The Venerable Lord of Numinous Elders governs within, presiding over the *qi* of spring and the generation of the myriad beings. Arrayed in attendance are one hundred twenty Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist, who oversee the one hundred twenty palaces. Nine Transfiguring Jade Maidens govern the Nine Provinces. Twelve thousand Jade Maidens of Mountain Spirits patrol and protect the world, dispatching the spirits of *jia* and *yi* to enact celestial virtue, and the spirits of *yin* and *mao* to rectify terrestrial *qi*. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, the myriad spirits of the world’s famous mountains and great marshes ascend Mount Tai, entering the Palace of Azure Stone and Jade Towers to pay homage to the Azure Numinous Elder and receive the Mysterious Talismans. They emerge riding the *tiaofeng* winds, returning to the four directions to summon and command the hundred demons, slaying malevolent spirits. Those who disobey the Mysterious Talismans shall have their essence extinguished by Heaven and be denied the offerings of their sacrifices. Thus do they assist Heaven and Earth in generating the beings of the world. With the *qi* of the *tiaofeng* winds, they refine and purify human forms; if a human form is not upright, they rectify it with talismans. Those who regularly rise with *jia* and *yi* and govern *yin* and *mao*, and who ought to receive talismans and pay homage, all turn toward the sundial.

The *Chart of the Divine Immortals* states:
The numen of the Southern Marchmount is called Mount Heng of the South, its primordial *qi* ascending to connect with Mars. Its mountain is red. The Venerable Lord of Scorching Solar Elders governs within, presiding over the *qi* of summer and the growth of the myriad beings. Arrayed in attendance are one hundred twenty Jade Maidens of Grand Cinnabar, who oversee the one hundred twenty palaces. Nine Transfiguring Jade Maidens govern the Nine Provinces. Twelve thousand Jade Maidens of Mountain Spirits patrol and protect the world, dispatching the spirits of *bing* and *ding* to enact celestial virtue, and the spirits of *si* and *wu* to rectify terrestrial *qi*. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, the myriad spirits of the world’s famous mountains and great marshes ascend Mount Heng of the South, entering the Palace of Red Stone and Jade Towers to pay homage to the Scorching Elder and receive the Mysterious Talismans. They emerge riding the *changfeng* winds, returning to the four directions to summon and command the hundred demons, slaying malevolent spirits. Those who disobey the Mysterious Talismans shall have their essence extinguished by Heaven and be denied the offerings of their sacrifices. Thus do they assist Heaven and Earth in generating the beings of the world. With the *qi* of the *changfeng* winds, they refine and purify human forms; if a human form is not upright, they rectify it with talismans. Those who regularly rise with *bing* and *ding* and govern *si* and *wu*, and who ought to receive talismans and pay homage, all turn toward the sundial.

The *Chart of the Divine Immortals* states:
The numen of the Central Marchmount is called Mount Song, its primordial *qi* ascending to connect with Saturn. Its mountain is yellow. The Yellow Venerable Lord governs within, presiding over the *qi* of the four seasons, unifying the spirits of the four marchmounts, and overseeing the myriad beings. Arrayed in attendance are Jade Maidens of the Yellow Simplicity, with fifty thousand Transfiguring Jade Maidens in each of the four directions, who patrol and circulate. Fifty thousand Jade Maidens of Mountain Spirits patrol and protect the world, dispatching the spirits of *wu* and *ji* to enact celestial virtue, and the spirits of *chou-chen* and *wei-xu* to rectify terrestrial *qi*. On the last day of the first month of each season, the myriad spirits of the world’s famous mountains and great marshes ascend Mount Song, entering the Palace of Yellow Stone and Jade Towers to pay homage to the Yellow Venerable Lord and receive the Mysterious Talismans. They emerge riding the Eight Winds, returning to the four directions. The Mysterious Talisman ever abides in *ji*; without speech, the Dao is naturally present; without action, the Dao is naturally luminous. In quiescence and non-action lies the root of the Dao. If it issues forth, illness arises, yet it remains unill. My non-illness means death has no way to approach. Thus does the Mysterious Talisman eternally guard your life, covered by the Canopy of Florescence, prolonging your years with Saturn’s stability. When Saturn’s staff is endangered, the great gates of Heaven close, the portals of Earth widen, and in profound obscurity, the myriad spirits arise spontaneously. The Mysterious Talismans of the Five Marchmounts are the tokens of the Five Powers’ fidelity, rewarding good and punishing evil, nurturing the beings of the world. Thus, with the Eight Winds harmonizing the talismans, they regulate and rectify humanity. Those who ought to receive talismans and pay homage all turn toward the sundial.

The *Chart of the Divine Immortals* states:
The numen of the Western Marchmount is called Mount Hua of the West, its primordial *qi* ascending to connect with Venus. Its mountain is white. The August Venerable Lord governs within, presiding over the *qi* of autumn and the ripening of the myriad beings. Arrayed in attendance are one hundred twenty Jade Maidens of White Simplicity, who oversee the one hundred twenty palaces. Nine Transfiguring Jade Maidens govern the Nine Provinces. Twelve thousand Jade Maidens of Mountain Spirits patrol and protect the world, dispatching the spirits of *geng* and *xin* to enact celestial virtue, and the spirits of *shen* and *you* to rectify terrestrial *qi*. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the myriad spirits of the world’s famous mountains and great marshes ascend Mount Hua of the West, entering the Palace of White Stone and Jade Towers to pay homage to the August Elder and receive the Mysterious Talismans. They emerge riding the *qingfeng* winds, returning to the four directions to summon and command the hundred demons, slaying malevolent spirits. Those who disobey the Mysterious Talismans shall have their essence extinguished by Heaven and be denied the offerings of their sacrifices. Thus do they assist Heaven and Earth in ripening the beings of the world. With the *qi* of the *qingfeng* winds, they refine and purify human forms; if a human form is not upright, they rectify it with talismans. Those who regularly govern *shen* and *you* with *geng* and *xin*, and who ought to receive talismans and pay homage, all turn toward the sundial.

The *Chart of the Divine Immortals* states:
The numen of the Northern Marchmount is called Mount Heng of the North, its primordial *qi* ascending to connect with Mercury. Its mountain is black. The Venerable Lord of Mysterious Lunar Elders governs within, presiding over the *qi* of winter and the storage of the myriad beings. Arrayed in attendance are one hundred twenty Jade Maidens of Grand Mystery, who oversee the one hundred twenty palaces. Nine Transfiguring Jade Maidens govern the Nine Provinces.

The Mountain Spirits and Jade Maidens, numbering twelve thousand, govern the roaming protection of the world. They dispatch the *shen* of *ren* and *gui* to enact the celestial virtue, and the *shen* of *hai* and *zi* to rectify the terrestrial *qi*. On the sacred mountains and great marshes, the myriad *shen* of the world, on the day of the Beginning of Winter, ascend Mount Heng of the North and enter the palace of Black Stone Jade Gates to pay homage to the Venerable Lord of Mysterious Lunar Elders and receive the Mysterious Talismans. Emerging, they ride the cool winds and return to the four directions, summoning the hundred ghosts and slaying malevolent *shen*. Those who do not obey the Mysterious Talismans have their essence extinguished by Heaven and are denied the offerings of their sacrifices. Thus do they assist Heaven and Earth and complete the storage of human beings. Therefore, with the *qi* of the cool winds, they refine and purify human forms; if a human form is not upright, they rectify it with talismans. Talismans commonly arise from *ren* and *gui*, governing *hai* and *zi*. Those who ought to receive talismans and pay homage all turn toward the sundial.

The *Chart of the Divine Immortals* states:
The Perfected of the Five Marchmounts guard the palaces and halls of the Son of Heaven. The method employs five *jin* of realgar, one *jin* for each marchmount. Seal with wax to fashion figures twelve *cun* in length, place them in a large jar of five *dou* capacity, and suspend them by their directional colors from the great beams of the palace halls. This benefits the palace chambers, dispels inauspiciousness, and subdues the four directions. The kingdom flourishes, and myriad blessings arrive for ten thousand years.

**White Tiger Talisman**
Laozi said: Yao transmitted the rites of sacrifice to Shun, and in the first month on the day *jiawu*, Shun performed the sacrifice of the *Chart of the Mysterious Talismans* beneath Mount Li. By the fourth month, a divine messenger riding a white deer announced the Queen Mother of the West and presented Shun with a white jade ring. In the second month of his first year, Shun transmitted it to Yu. In the sixth month of that year, auspicious clouds appeared three times. The ritual of sacrifice employs drums and grand drums to summon the Straight Talismans. One Straight Talisman corresponds to one drumbeat; two Straight Talismans, to two drumbeats. When one thousand two hundred Straight Talismans have arrived, then the Transfiguring Jade Maidens are invited, followed by the Jade Maidens of the Mountain Spirits of the Five Phases, and finally the Divine Ears of the Supreme August. For three days, the precepts are upheld and the altar established, with three incense fires and fruits offered in accordance with the four seasons. The central altar is arranged with the five colors of the upper and lower as a mat. Do not recklessly transmit or divulge this. **Five Marchmount Talismans**

The Upper Talisman suppresses and pacifies the malign qi and wood essence of the East. When toxins and harm spread, bandits and raiders arise frequently, the five grains do not flourish, the people suffer many demonic disasters, violent floods emerge, and locusts swarm—this is the doing of the Spirit Gou Mang. The method of suppression and pacification: use the three sacrificial animals at the far eastern border, first offering to Heaven and Earth. The altar face measures twelve zhang, with silk cloth laid as a mat for sixty cups. Use one *hu* and two *dou* of rice, and five-colored pigments mixed with white earth to create the Human-Dragon Talisman. On the west side, inscribe cinnabar characters on white silk twelve *chi* in length. Prepare twelve white jars, placing six *liang* of realgar and twelve *jin* of cinnabar inside.

When toxins and harm spread, mountains collapse and the earth quakes, and the four barbarians are unsettled—this is the doing of the Spirit Hou Tu. The method of suppression and pacification: use the three sacrificial animals at the state’s center, erecting an altar on level ground with a face of twenty-eight zhang and one hundred twenty cups, with silk cloth laid as a mat. Use one *hu* and two *dou* of rice, and five-colored pigments mixed with green earth to create the Human-Dragon Talisman. On the east side, inscribe cinnabar characters on green silk twelve *chi* in length. Prepare twelve white jars, placing six *liang* of realgar and twelve *jin* of cinnabar inside. Seal the mouths tightly with wax, stamp with the seal of Gou Mang, and cast them into the state’s center.

The Upper Talisman suppresses and pacifies the malign qi and metal essence of the West. When toxins and harm spread, bandits and raiders arise frequently, the five grains do not flourish, soldiers are disturbed, violent floods surge, and locusts harm the grain—this is the doing of the Spirit Shu Shou. The method of suppression and pacification: use the three sacrificial animals at the far western border, first offering to Heaven and Earth.

When toxins and harm spread, yin forces prevail with torrential rains, waters surge and mountains collapse, and raiders violently arise—this is the doing of the Spirit Xuan Ming. The method of suppression and pacification: use the three sacrificial animals at the far northern border, first offering to Heaven and Earth. The altar face measures twelve zhang, with yellow cloth laid as a mat for sixty cups. Use one *hu* and two *dou* of rice, and five-colored pigments mixed with yellow earth to create the Human-Dragon Talisman.

**The Talisman of Great Peace**
In the first month of the *jiazi* year, the first year of the Phoenix reign of Emperor Yao, the master-shaman Xian received this from the Son of Heaven Yao, who ruled all under Heaven, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Waterways, mountains, and rivers. The spirits who oversee constant prohibitions, when Heaven employs suppression and pacification, thereby awe the Four Seas, subdue the Eight Barbarians, prevent the rise of armed bandits, and naturally dispel plagues and epidemics. They respond like an echo, and the spirits ever assist. The ritual of sacrifice employs the three sacrificial animals, ox horns five *cun* in length, sheep horns seven *cun* in length, one hundred twenty *jin* of fat, five *hu* of clear wine, yellow non-glutinous rice, and twelve kinds of fruits. Incense fires are placed on each side, three in number. The altar face measures twenty-eight zhang, with white cogon grass as a mat, two *chi* and two *cun* in length. Also use five *dou* of non-glutinous rice, one thousand two hundred cups, and four hundred cups on the face. A pole twenty-eight *chi* in length is erected in the central courtyard, with a twelve-zhang banner, equal on all four sides. Five large tables are set, with twenty-four cups, totaling one hundred twenty cups. The five colors are arranged in order, and silk four *zhang* and one *chi* in length is inscribed. The pure noble’s son and inner ministers observe the three-day precepts before the sacrifice. In the third month of the first year, the sacrifice is performed to receive the qi of fortune, and in the third month, the qi of harmony appears. In three years, all under Heaven attains Great Peace.

**The Talisman of Majestic Virtue**
The Talisman of the August Supreme’s Majestic Virtue. This talisman is for nobles from the Three Dukes downward to local magistrates, all officials with seals and cords. On the first *wang* day of the first month, they receive this talisman and place it in their seal pouch. When serving the emperor, the lord and his ministers enjoy good fortune, spirits are subdued, the people are at peace, bandits cease, officials are promoted and prosper, and all affairs are auspicious.

**The Five Generals’ Talisman**
Fan Li’s Five Generals’ Talisman governs military affairs, using the talisman to break enemies and suppress multitudes. Ten thousand men dare not face those who bear this talisman. Later, Fan Li defeated Wu. On the day of *jigeng*, he performed the libation ritual for this talisman atop Nanshan, and King Goujian of Yue thereby became hegemon of Langya. Goujian was narrow-minded and suspicious, harboring jealousy in his heart, unable to complete the imperial enterprise. Thus, his joys and sorrows shifted, his cruelty and indulgence alternated, like carving rotten wood. Lord Fan, discerning the signs, fled to the borders of Qi, where he secretly cultivated rituals and libations, praying in secret to Heaven and humanity. Later, he became Prime Minister of Qi, known as Master Chi Yi Zi Pi.

Sighing that in private life he amassed a thousand gold pieces, and in officialdom attained the rank of minister or chancellor—this was the pinnacle for a commoner—he deemed long-received honorifics inauspicious and thus returned the ministerial seal.

Later, he settled in Tao, surpassing the wealth of all past ages, his benevolence extending to later generations, and was styled Lord Tao Zhu. His original name was Shaobo, a native of Xu, who studied under the Grand Duke Lü Shang. He often employed wondrous methods to encourage and guide the virtuous, bestowing teachings upon the Lords of Zhou and Su, as well as the Four Whiteheads of Qin. For the Han founder’s secret affairs, all were entrusted to Zhang Liang, who personally befriended the Four Whiteheads and constantly cultivated merit alongside them.

Among Lord Zhu’s disciples was Zhu Zhong, who traded pearls in Kuaiji and presented his arts to Empress Lü. The Empress, unable to employ them, stored both the man and his diagrams away.
