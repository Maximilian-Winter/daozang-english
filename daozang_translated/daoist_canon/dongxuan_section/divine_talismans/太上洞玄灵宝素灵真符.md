### **Preface to *The Primordial Numinous Treasure of Simplicity and Spirit True Talismans***

The *Talismans of Simplicity and Spirit* were transmitted by the Heavenly Master, Master Zhai. During the *Qianyu* and *Qianyuan* reigns, he journeyed from Yellow Crane Mountain, drifting into Shu until he reached the Wu Gorge. There, he lingered among the forests and springs, traversing peaks and valleys for over a year. Southward, he reached Qingjiang; northward, Shangyong—roaming over a thousand *li*, visiting sacred ruins and numinous traces, cliffs, grottoes, and caverns without exception.

One evening, he dreamed of a perfected one, over a *zhang* in height, clad in plain robes and an ornate cap, standing atop a towering cliff. Gazing down, the figure seemed to issue a command. The next day, the Master ascended the Peak of the Heavenly Worthy, bowing in reverence—and there stood the perfected one. Suddenly, from the Heavenly Worthy’s hand, he received a scroll of cinnabar script. Bowing, he accepted it: the *Talismans of Simplicity and Spirit*.

When applied, these talismans healed ailments, subdued demons, commanded spirits, revived the dead, summoned wind and rain, and tamed tigers and wolves. The people of the Three Gorges greatly benefited. During the *Tianbao* era, the Master was summoned to the inner palace, where he discoursed on the Dao with the wind. Later, he returned to the Mountain of the Immortals’ Capital.

Thereafter, Duan Chengshi of Pingchang, along with scholars and generals of Jing and Ying, all became his disciples, studying for years before attaining the Dao and departing. Those who receive these talismans must transmit them to save others, for their efficacy is certain.

In the *Tianfu* *bingyin* year, I requested the scripture from Pingdu Mountain and obtained its original text, compiling it into the *Three Caverns Canon*, hoping that future kindred spirits may share in the aspiration to aid all beings.

### **The Primordial Numinous Treasure of Simplicity and Spirit True Talismans, Volume One**
**By Master Lu**

**1. Talisman for All Illnesses**
**2. Talisman for Epidemic Pestilence**
**3. Talisman for Cold Damage**
**4. Talisman for Chills and Fever**
**5. Talisman for Headaches**

Each day, visualize the Five Numinous Spirits encircling your body and recite this incantation:

*"On my left, the Azure Dragon Mengzhang of Jia-yin;
On my right, the White Tiger Guardian of Jia-shen;
Above my head, the Vermilion Bird Lingguang of Jia-wu;
Beneath my feet, the Dark Warrior Zhiming of Jia-zi;
The Noble Child of the Spleen enters the Central Palace of Jia-chen and Jia-xu."*

Recite this invocation until memorized, without letting the sound pass your lips or be heard by others.

When facing public or private disputes, the *qi* of war arising from the four directions, perilous battlefields, or entering foreign lands with unfamiliar climates and pestilence, recite it frequently at dawn and dusk.

When attending wakes, approaching corpses, entering temples, or encountering places of fear, misfortune, or inauspicious homes, step with the *Yu* pace as you enter and recite it. Then the Six Jia spirits and Four Numinous Beasts will guard your body.

This is called the *Master Artisan Talisman*. First, hold your breath while inscribing it. Upon completion, knock your teeth thrice and recite:

*"The sun rises, yang and yang;
I wield the divine talisman, commanding the four directions.
Wearing this talisman, all illnesses vanish, all evils perish.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

All talismans bear written characters, though most cannot decipher them. Those who can read talismanic script may summon myriad spirits, command a hundred ghosts, and achieve all things.

Here, I elucidate the *Master Artisan Talisman* and its essentials. When encountering warfare, bandits, tigers, wolves, storms, or hearing wailing spirits, attending wakes, or witnessing defilement, compose your mind and recite the *Heavenly Emperor of Radiant Union* thrice daily—nothing will fail to be averted.

To interpret this talisman, read its five characters thrice, inscribing the talisman twice.

When swallowing the Six Jia Talismans, avoid consuming the creature of the corresponding earthly branch: do not eat ox on *chou*, pig on *hai*, or rabbit on *mao*.

The Six Jia Reversion Talismans are taken for ten days per cycle, over six cycles—all Six Jia Talismans are consumed together.

---

**1. Talisman for All Illnesses (31 Talismans)**
The true talisman governs all ailments. Placed at the head of a bed, it revives those on the verge of death, restoring their *hun* and *po* to grant eternal longevity.

Inscribed in cinnabar and swallowed, it repels a hundred evils and a thousand spirits, proving its true efficacy. Take it for thirty-nine days on the left, thirty-two on the right.

**2. Talisman for Epidemic Pestilence (88 Talismans)**
On *jia-zi* days, the Celestial Lord and all spirits pay homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy asked why the people suffered endless deaths from epidemic *qi* and pestilence.

The Heavenly Worthy instructed the Celestial Lord and spirits: *"When the *yin* essence reaches its peak, affix the Yellow Emperor’s talisman to the celestial gate, inscribing red characters upon the door. Let the afflicted drink the Six-Character Talisman, and they will sweat and survive."*

Thus, it was proclaimed for all to practice. At the first sign of pestilence, prepare peach-blossom decoction and consume this talisman to induce sweating. After a while, take one; if no sweat comes, take up to three. If still no sweat, take seven or nine—then sweat will come, and recovery will follow. If not, take the second talisman the next day, continuing in sequence. None will fail.

Inscribe it facing the kingly direction on a day of royal vigor. Long ago, Master Xuan obtained twelve divine talismans from a stone chamber. Wearing them, he ascended to the heavens. Those afflicted with pestilence may inscribe them in cinnabar on paper and consume one daily to remain free of illness.

Wang Qiao wore them and ascended in broad daylight. Chi Song wore them and transformed into an immortal. Lord Lao practiced them to govern all heavens.

Upon completing the inscription, recite:
*"Nurtured by Heaven, formed by Earth;
Receiving the divine talisman, one may attain longevity."*

The immortal aids the self, the jade maiden assists the form;
The twenty-eight constellations ascend to the celestial court.
Five colors transform—black, white, red, and azure;
The Yellow Emperor of the center merges with the self.
Where the divine talisman acts, it subdues the myriad spirits;
All wickedness, evil, and malevolence vanish without trace.

Recite the incantation for activating the talisman:
*"The Great Law declares: Today is jiazi, you serve as my direct envoy.
I wish to deploy the talisman—you shall be my messenger.
Adorned in crimson brocade, enter the Gate of Heaven directly.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes of the Lord Lao command!"*

**Talisman for Treating Cold Damage (Third)** – Eight talismans
**Talisman for Treating Cold-Heat (Fourth)** – Thirty-two talismans

**For unbearable abdominal pain, intestinal distension, or qi on the verge of collapse (appearing like corpse-back syndrome):**
Inscribe in cinnabar upon the patient’s abdomen, filling it with large talismanic characters—extending the length of the abdomen enhances efficacy. Alternatively, burn and ingest.

Inscribe in cinnabar on water, or on paper, and swallow three pills. If unresolved, inscribe three talismans below the heart and upon the abdomen in large characters—none fail to heal.

**Two talismans for sudden encounter with malign visitors, ghost-stabbing heart pain, or qi pain:**
Inscribe in cinnabar on white paper. First ingest the upper talisman; if pain persists, then ingest the next. If still unresolved, inscribe again from the top. If the patient appears dead but the area below the heart remains warm and moving, ingestion revives them. For lockjaw, break the teeth to insert the talisman; once in the mouth, ensure it enters the abdomen. Alternatively, take a strong scallion leaf, cut a small opening, insert the talisman, and blow forcefully into the nose to propel it inward. If unsuccessful, use water to blow it in, shaking the head to aid its descent—immediate efficacy.

First ingest the first talisman; if unresolved, then the second, then the third. If the patient appears dead but the area below the heart remains warm, and the talisman does not take effect immediately, inscribe in ink on paper, form into pills, and ingest. For lockjaw, break the teeth to insert the talisman, or use a strong scallion leaf, cut a small opening, and insert through the nose to the throat. Use water to aid its descent, shaking the head to ensure it enters—immediate recovery. If unresolved, return to the first talisman and proceed to the second, continuing until healed.

**Two talismans for sudden corpse-strike causing qi cessation and lockjaw:**
Inscribe the upper talisman in ink on paper and force it into the mouth. If unresponsive, ingest the lower talisman. If still unresponsive, ingest the upper talisman again—immediate recovery. Named the "Break the Funeral Cart, Revive the Dead Talisman," inscribe on plain silk and apply to the afflicted area—greatly auspicious.

**Two talismans for sudden malign stabbing pain with extreme vexation near death:**
First ingest the upper talisman; if unresolved, then the lower. If the patient appears dead but the heart remains warm, ingest the talisman with a shake—immediate recovery. Inscribe in ink on paper and ingest. For lockjaw, break a tooth, insert the talisman into the throat, and use water to aid its descent—immediate efficacy.

**Talisman for sudden malign attack near death:**
If already deceased, inscribe in cinnabar below the hairline and on both shoulders. Upon completing the talisman, use a cinnabar brush (unnoticed by others) to trace the talisman. Grasp the brush and rotate it four or five times for robust ghosts, three or four times for wrathful ghosts—none fail to heal. First, place the patient’s hands before the head and tightly bind the thumbs. Then, with the cinnabar brush, inscribe the talisman on the five centers, positioning the left side over the patient’s heart. Direct the brush toward the nose to draft the talisman, then inscribe it into the nose—counterclockwise for men, clockwise for women—completing before midnight or noon. Knock the head and state one’s name, beseeching departure. If unresponsive, compel self-declaration.

First ingest the first talisman; if unresolved, then the second, then the third. If the patient appears dead but the area below the heart remains warm, and the talisman does not take effect immediately, inscribe in ink on paper, form into pills, and ingest. For lockjaw, break the teeth to insert the talisman, or use a strong scallion leaf, cut a small opening, and insert through the nose to the throat. Use water to aid its descent, shaking the head to ensure it enters—immediate recovery. If unresolved, return to the first talisman and proceed to the second, continuing until healed. If still unresolved, proceed to the next.

**Two talismans above, for treating sudden corpse-strike, qi cessation, and lockjaw:**
Inscribe the upper talisman in ink on paper and force it down the patient’s throat. If unresponsive, then ingest the lower talisman. If still unresponsive, ingest the upper talisman again—immediate recovery. Named the *Breaking the Funeral Cart, Reviving the Dead Talisman*; write it plainly and apply to the afflicted area—greatly auspicious.

**Two talismans above, for treating sudden malign stabbing pain and extreme vexation near death:**
First ingest the upper talisman; if unresolved after a moment, then the lower talisman. If the patient appears dead but the heart remains warm, ingest the *Shaking Talisman*—immediate recovery. Inscribe in ink on paper and swallow. If the patient’s mouth does not open, break a tooth to insert the talisman into the throat, then use water to aid its descent by shaking—immediate effect.

**Upper talisman, for treating sudden malign attack near death:**
If already dead, write in cinnabar on the hairline and both shoulders, completing the talisman. With a cinnabar brush and water, without the patient’s awareness, grasp the brush. Circle the *robust ghosts* four or five times, the *wrathful ghosts* three or four times—none will remain unresolved. First place the patient’s hands before the head and tightly bind the thumbs with a cord. Then, with a cinnabar brush, inscribe the five centers as the talisman-master writes, placing the left side over the patient’s heart. Next, with the cinnabar brush, trace toward the nose to form the talisman, then insert the brush into the nostrils—turning left for men, right for women—no later than midnight or noon. Knock the head and state one’s name, begging departure. If unresponsive, press urgently and have the patient state their name—then the illness departs.

The Nine Upper Talismans cure *zhong’e* (sudden possession by malevolent spirits). Ingest them after inscribing, and the effect is immediate.

The Three Upper Talismans cure *shuanshi zhuwu* (corpse transmission and hostile spirits lodged in the five viscera). Inscribe them in cinnabar on yellow silk and swallow the first talisman. If the condition persists, ingest the subsequent ones—none will remain uncured.

The Upper Talisman cures sudden attacks by the Five Ghosts carving into the five viscera. Inscribe it in cinnabar and swallow the first talisman. If the condition persists, ingest the subsequent talismans—none will remain uncured.

Chest pain
Dysentery
Cholera
Obstruction of urine and stool
Strangury
Yin heat and vexing heat
Dispels confusion
Opens the heart and strengthens memory
Pacifies the hun and po souls
Dispels sorrow and longing

**Treats:**
Malaria
Prohibitive incantations
Chest pain
Dysentery
Cholera
Obstruction of urine and stool

The right talisman treats obstruction of urine and stool in children—inscribe it below the navel for immediate efficacy.

**Treats:**
Strangury
Yin heat and vexing heat

The right talisman treats heat diseases, nightmares, the hundred ghosts, and encounters with malevolent spirits while traveling at night—wear it for auspiciousness.

**Dispels confusion**
The right talisman treats those afflicted by confusion. One should hold this talisman, kneel facing west, and bow in reverence—thus dispelling it. If unresolved, inscribe and wear it for great auspiciousness. If the condition persists, inscribe it in cinnabar on yellow silk and ingest it for immediate healing.

**Opens the heart and strengthens memory**
The right talisman enables one to open the heart and attain the method of reverse knowing. On an auspicious day, inscribe fifty talismans and ingest one daily, twice a day, for fifty days. When the talismans are exhausted, begin anew. After one hundred days to a year, the heart opens, and one will not forget what is read, daily retaining three thousand words. Prolonged ingestion leads to ascension to heaven.

**Pacifies the hun and po souls**
The right talisman treats the unsettled hun and po souls of the sick. In cases of sudden *zhong’e*, ingest it, and the hun and po souls will immediately return—greatly auspicious.

**Dispels sorrow and longing**
The right talisman treats sorrow, longing, melancholy, abdominal discomfort, weeping, and madness. Inscribe it in cinnabar on yellow silk and ingest it. Also inscribe it over the heart twice, and write it on a five-inch piece of crimson silk to bind on the left arm—then lie on one’s side. Follow this method for auspicious healing.

**Treats malaria**
The right talisman governs the twelve-hour malaria ghosts—inscribe and wear it for immediate healing. Ascend a high mountain, gaze upon cold waters, and command the tigers and wolves to capture the malaria ghosts: *"Why do you not swiftly depart? My household has wealth and nobility!"* **Haste, haste, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!**

Again: Ascend a high mountain, gaze upon cold waters, and dispatch tigers and wolves to capture the malaria ghosts: *"Come at dawn, die by dusk—if captured, you shall not be spared, and the same punishment applies!"* **Haste, haste, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!**

Ascend a high mountain, gaze upon cold waters, and command the tigers and wolves to capture the malaria ghosts: *"Drink your blood—why do you not swiftly depart? My household has noble guests!"* The character is *Poshi* (Breaking Stone), its head like the Western Mountains, its body like the Eastern Marsh. It does not consume the five grains but feeds only on malaria ghosts—three thousand at dawn, eight hundred at dusk. If even one ghost remains, it will demand more. **Haste, haste, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!**

The two right talismans should be inscribed and placed before the heart. Ascend a high mountain, gaze upon the sea, and order the tigers and wolves to capture the malaria ghosts: *"Why do you not swiftly depart? My household has noble guests!"* The character is named *Poshi* (Breaking Stone), its head like the Western Mountains, its body like the Eastern Marsh. It does not consume the five grains but feeds only on malaria ghosts—three thousand at dawn, eight hundred at dusk. If you are insufficient, come now for more. **Haste, haste, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!**

The seven right talismans—those afflicted with malaria should inscribe and ingest them as above for immediate healing. This is a secret of inestimable value, never before transmitted.

**Prohibitive incantations**
Ascend a high mountain, gaze upon cold waters, and dispatch tigers and wolves to capture the malaria ghosts: *"Three thousand at dawn, eight hundred at dusk. If even one ghost does not depart, its name shall be transferred to the River Earl. If still unsatisfied, hasten to demand more!"* **Haste, haste, in accordance with the newly issued statutes and ordinances of the Venerable Lord!**

The right mandate commands the capture of malaria ghosts—wherever the illness is found, the incantation and talisman are applied alike. The Heavenly Emperor’s emissaries capture the malaria ghosts and kill them without inquiry. **Haste, haste, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!**

The right mandate for treating malaria with talismanic texts: The officials to the left and right of my body, the emissaries, must not err or interfere—each governs the spirits of their respective directions. Yet the malaria ghosts have violated their mother, and the four sons, without cause, entered the garden where fire burned them to death, transforming them into malaria ghosts. I am the emissary of the Supreme, and I know your names and origins—why do you not swiftly flee? Now I pursue and kill you with water and fire. **Haste, haste, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!**

**Malaria Petition**
Respectfully stated: I, so-and-so, a mortal born of flesh, descendant of the hundred officials and children of the Dao, have been fortunate for a thousand generations to serve the pure transformation and be upheld by the Dao’s qi, ever receiving grace and fulfilling my wishes. Yet as a mortal, my conduct has often transgressed, incurring karmic retribution. In such-and-such a year, at such-and-such an age, on such-and-such a month and day, I suddenly contracted malaria, which has recurred daily, causing headaches, brain pain, chills, fever, gasping breaths, and inability to eat or drink. On the day of onset, my breath nearly ceased, and the condition worsened, filling me with great fear and leaving me without recourse. I hasten to you, seeking your salvation. Overwhelmed by this mortal’s affliction with malaria, I can only prostrate myself in pity. Respectfully, I bow to the ground before the Supreme Lords, the Venerable Masters, the Lady, and the officials of the Five Qi Lords...
