Ziming addressed Li Fang, saying: "Recently, I heard from Xiaoyao Yun: 'In the past, while I was attending the Immortal Altar, I encountered Master Lian of the White Cloud Bureau. He mentioned that when I arrived at the side of the Pure Void Cavern of Wangwu, I obtained two scrolls of true talismanic scriptures of the immortals—one called *Primordial Essence*, the other *Cinnabar Splendor*. Upon examining their authentic traces and savoring their profound meanings, I realized that the dragon scripts and phoenix talismans differ utterly from worldly brushstrokes, and the sacred methods and immortal formulas stand apart from common writings. Though I longed for them with melancholy yearning, I deeply regretted never having seen their author. Yet, through prolonged and devoted study, I gradually penetrated their abstruse depths, hoping only to glimpse their topknots and beards.'

In former times, the Embracer of Simplicity, the True Man, received the two scriptures *Primordial Essence* and *Cinnabar Splendor* and transmitted them to Master Zhonghe. Master Zhonghe, in turn, passed them to the Recluse of Tiantai, Lord Liu. Lord Liu’s ancestral home was in the ancient Yingzhou Prefecture of the Bohai Commandery. Later, he paid homage to the Perfected Immortal Li of Banyang and received the esoteric instructions of the *Golden Sash*. In the year *jihai* of the dragon cycle, while sojourning in Zhulin, he obtained the *Nine-Cauldron Divine Elixir* from an old woman in a humble abode. Thereupon, he was moved by the Supreme Realm, bestowed the title *Great Simplicity Perfected Man and Penglai Immortal Lord*, and roamed freely, widely expounding the primordial mysteries of the Great Cavern’s wondrous truth. He gathered correct teachings, skillfully guided the people’s hearts, delivered those of virtue, and diligently observed the celestial patterns.

Moreover, when the supreme sages expounded the scriptures, the true immortals bestowed them upon humanity in due time. Since the true immortals modeled their teachings on Heaven, how should the affairs of Heaven and humanity be conducted? Thus, what the lofty scholars valued was nothing but the practice of the Dao.

Thereupon, Xiaoyao thoroughly studied the teachings and instructions. In his words, he recounted the sayings of the ancient perfected ones—no deception or falsehood. In his conduct, he manifested the deeds of later sages—truly in accord with the august sovereigns. Thus, his words and deeds all followed the charts and writings, resembling cloud-script, fresh and radiant, utterances from beyond Heaven, imparting instruction to the mortal realm. Tracing their purport, how vast they are! Therefore, to propagate the Dao without exhaustion—who but the Immortal Lord could achieve this?"

At that time, Xiaoyao addressed Ziming, saying: "Reflecting on the Immortal Lord’s transmissions and teachings, they are now complete. If one follows them, the cultivation of life will be tranquil. Yet the concern is that worldly people, lacking in merit and conduct, will surely fail to accomplish them—how lamentable! Still, fearing that the secret treasury of the heart might return to the winds of Pengcheng, it is fitting to praise and compose gāthā verses:

*Together we inquire, O!*
*The Great Cavern’s true primordial, O!*
*The Immortal Lord’s vast compassion, O!*

Having disseminated the essential Dao, Li Congzhao of the True Source Gate recorded and inscribed it."

The Recluse said: "I have heard that the sages established teachings through words, and teachings are the verbal elucidation of the Dao. If one cuts off names and words, where then would the relationship between master and disciple reside? Thus, they employed the discourse of constant testing as the gateway to practice. Moreover, humanity is nurtured by the Dao, and the Dao is propagated through humanity. The merit of broadly bestowing relief upon the masses and still attaining the five vast blessings does not compare to transmitting the scriptures and exhorting goodness, which yields a hundredfold of profound auspiciousness.

Alas! Worldly people, unaware of the great dream, toil day and night, accumulating surplus wealth. Yet when illness, aging, and death approach, and bandits or calamities suddenly strike—oppressed by cruelty and violence, seeking an end in vain—their material goods scatter among others, while the burden of evil karma accumulates upon themselves. At such a juncture, what sorrow is not present? Only then do they think of the Dao and desire to perform good deeds—like digging a well when thirsty, is it not too late? How much better to be healthy in one’s prime, to encounter an era of peace, to joyfully donate pure wealth, to print and distribute precious scriptures, to circulate and recite them, and to emulate the fields of blessings of Jiang and Xiang. Then, one knows that prayers and vows will be manifestly answered, like an echo responding to sound. As hidden virtues accumulate, auspicious omens descend from afar, and naturally, one will ascend to the Golden Gates to pay court and roam and feast in the Jade Capital."

At that time, the Recluse, on Mount Yi, walked with his staff and sang:

*The merit of broadly bestowing relief upon the masses,*
*Does not compare to the blessing of transmitting the scriptures.*
*In life, one enjoys celestial emoluments;*
*In death, one ascends to the halls of immortals.*
*As you depart, do not return empty-handed in vain lamentation.*

In former times, when the former master was at leisure, someone inquired about the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Sages, and the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ incarnations. Ziming replied: "I have perused the *Commentaries of Master Guangcheng*. Before Heaven and Earth were established, when the primordial chaos had not yet taken form, the Great Dao, through the mutual generation of the One Qi, unfolded into the Three Qi of the Mysterious, Primordial, and Origin. The first, the Qi of Origin, transformed into the Heavenly Treasure Venerable, who presides over the Jade Purity Realm of the Clear and Subtle Heaven, overseeing the twelve divisions of scriptures on the sagely conduct of the *Cavern of Truth*. He is the Master of the *Dongzhen* teachings, illuminating the Dao of natural spontaneity, the pivot of superior accomplishment.

The second, the Qi of Primordiality, transformed into the Numinous Treasure Venerable, who presides over the Supreme Purity Realm of the Yu-Yu Heaven, overseeing the twelve divisions of scriptures on the true conduct of the *Cavern of Mystery*. He is the Master of the *Dongxuan* teachings, expounding the Dao of non-action, the mechanism of middle accomplishment.

The third, the Qi of Mystery, transformed into the Divine Treasure Venerable, who presides over the Grand Purity Realm of the Great Red Heaven, overseeing the twelve divisions of scriptures on the immortal conduct of the *Cavern of Divinity*. He is the Master of the *Dongshen* teachings, unfolding the root of the Dao and virtue, the handle of great accomplishment.

I have heard that the lofty perfected ones, unbound by limitations, manifest myriad bodies to deliver beings across kalpas; the supreme sages, radiating light and scattering reflections, extend their presence in the ten directions to receive and transform all things. In the past, the Primordial Beginning responded to the Qi and manifested bodies in the ten directions. The Dao says: 'The Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions are as numerous as grains of sand. They transform their forms across the ten-directional realms to universally deliver and save heavenly and human beings.'

These Heavenly Worthies, with their wisdom of others’ minds, fully comprehend the root-nature of all beings who can be transformed and delivered. They manifest bodies to go among them, saving and delivering according to kind, guiding and leading sentient beings to enter the correct Dao. Some appear as the bodies of emperors, expounding the Dao of emperors to the masses, saying: 'Illumine the affairs of non-action, assist the principles of natural spontaneity, reverently serve the Supreme Emperor, and benevolently love the people below.'"

Some manifest as ministerial bodies, expounding to sentient beings the Dao of ministers, saying: "Illumine integrity, loyalty, uprightness, and directness; reverently practice kindness and righteousness. Thus, serve those above with sincerity and govern those below with forbearance."

Some appear as official clerks, teaching sentient beings the Dao of clerks, saying: "Dispel the mind of cruelty and harm toward beings; act with compassion and mercy to save lives. Do not let likes and dislikes arbitrarily dictate rewards and punishments. By this unceasing practice, one may endure long."

Some take the form of renunciates, instructing sentient beings in the Dao of renunciation, saying: "Abide in non-action yet nothing is left undone; engage in no affair yet nothing is unfit. Refine the inner and outer elixir, secure the foundation of nature and life. Comprehend the principle of wondrous being and true non-being, clarify the essentials of profound spirit and primordial qi. Once united with the Dao, one attains longevity and enduring vision."

Some manifest as Dharma masters, teaching sentient beings the Dao of Dharma masters, saying: "Illumine fasting and precepts to establish jiao rites; transmit registers to deliver people. The Dao follows the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, the scriptures honor Yin Xi and Zhuangzi. Adorn their terraces, pavilions, palaces, and halls; enshrine the sacred images and true visages. Moreover, broadly bestow blessings to cultivate the field of merit, aid the multitudes to reap the fruits of goodness."

Some appear as dragon kings, expounding to sentient beings the Dao of dragon kings, saying: "Do not overflow to harm the people’s fields; restrain the surging waves to subdue ditches and channels. Timely bestow sweet rains to nourish crops and grains."

Some manifest as male bodies, teaching sentient beings the Dao of men, saying: "Through the virtue of filial piety and fraternal respect, practice benevolence and kindness. Harmonize with the Dao and accord with Heaven, pacify people and benefit beings. When dwelling in turbidity, embrace impurity; when riding clarity, bathe in purity. Transform with the times, without clinging to a fixed self."

Some appear as female bodies, instructing sentient beings in the Dao of women, saying: "Illumine the nature of tranquility, chastity, purity, and resoluteness; follow the aspiration of uprightness and illustrious virtue. Serve elders with filial reverence, approach the young with benevolence and kindness."

Some take the form of mendicants, teaching sentient beings the Dao of mendicants, saying: "Deeply delight in non-arising; how could one take pleasure in self-assertion? Gladly embrace poverty and rejoice in the Dao, without resentment or greed. Know your destiny, reduce your desires. Dwell in the realm of purity and simplicity, abide in the land of leisure and ease."

Some manifest as lowly bodies, instructing sentient beings in the Dao of the lowly, saying: "It is fitting to reverently serve your master, unwavering from dawn to dusk. Constantly offer water and present flowers, repeatedly recite scriptures and venerate the sages."

All these manifested bodies of the Heavenly Worthies transmit scriptures to deliver people. Thus, the *Sutra of Causes and Conditions* states: "If good people copy and transcribe the scriptural teachings—whether the Three Caverns or the Great Vehicle—their blessings flow for eternal kalpas, and their merit is boundless. Why is this so? The scriptures are the legacy of the Supreme Sages, guiding the deluded and ignorant. They awaken in sentient beings immeasurable Dao-intent, leading from awakening to perfection. All sages who cultivate the path attain the fruition of the Dao."

Next, inquiring into the scriptures of the Dao: "Without words, there is no means to reveal its profundities; without the Dao, words have no foundation. Yet, where the Dao is hidden in silence, it is better to make it manifest through speech." Therefore, the former masters praised, "Great indeed is the Dao’s realm, driving away evil; the palace of virtue bestows blessings. The myriad spirits receive their teachings, spanning the five great kalpas. Beginning with the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras, the reign of the Vermilion Radiance High Emperor, continuing through the Kai Huang and Shao Yun epochs, the celestial patterns were fully established."

Reverently considering the Supreme Sages, they ordained and initiated immortals, employing the Nine Sincerities, Ten Goodnesses, Three Caverns, and Four Supplements, unified under the Twelve Divisions, arranged into the Thirty-Six Sections. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Luo transmitted the cloud-script, comprising one million eight thousand chapters. The August Emperor of Supreme Virtue composed five thousand eight hundred verses in eighty-one chapters. The Dao Lord transmitted sixty-one sections, opening one hundred twenty gates. They sealed the three hundred sixty grotto-heavens, established seventy-two prefectures of blessed lands, conferred ranks and talismanic registers, selected and promoted officials across the nine ranks.

The teachings originated from a single sound, and the scriptures culminate in the myriad wonders. The vast canon, though modeled on the grandest scale, cannot be fully described. Here, the great school of the Dao encompasses one million one hundred fourteen thousand five hundred ninety-two matters, all recorded within the Mysterious Capital’s secret treasury, collectively illuminating the origin of the *Wondrous Scripture of the Great Cavern*.

Yet, the peril lies in later generations’ inability to broadly peruse them, still failing to dispel delusion, and aspiring to abide in non-action. Directly tracing back to the Golden Portal, is it not difficult? There has never been one who attained without study. But if a single word exhorts goodness, it benefits those who cultivate the Dao. Thus, I follow the sound and inscribe these words.

This solitary servant, with reverent intent, respectfully wishes the sagely ruler of the great dynasty an auspicious longevity of a hundred million myriad years.

The *True and Primordial Charts of the Great Cavern of the Upper Realm* concludes here.
