**The Supreme Cavern’s Wondrous True Origin Scripture Chart**

In ancient times, the people of Yao beheld an Immortal Lord and entreated him, saying: "Yong ventures to inquire—may the Great Cavern’s True Origin be heard?"

The Immortal Lord replied: "You are but a humble man—how could you fathom such matters? Yet I shall recite what I have heard, and you may choose for yourself."

He expounded thus:
*"Great" is akin to the Dao. "Cavern" means pervading. The boundless Dao circulates the True One’s primordial yang qi. This qi is inexhaustible, penetrating all things, and thus is the origin of the ten thousand beings. If one can preserve it, the arts of immortality may be mastered.*

The Immortal Lord continued:
Now, for Yong’s sake, I shall trust in his sincerity, diligently impart my teachings, and elucidate the essential Dao of all wonders. I shall gather the finest words from the scriptures, expound the teachings of the True Origin, and make them clear to the world. Heaven has bestowed its charts—twelve in number. Let people heed its instruction, that future generations may be awakened.

Like Master Kuang tuning his bells, awaiting a true connoisseur in later times.

**The Chart of the Void and Spontaneity**
Its beginning has no head, its end no tail; above, it is not constrained, below, it is not obscured. Endless and unnameable, it returns to nothingness—this is called the formless form, the imageless image, the realm of indistinctness. One meets it yet sees not its head; one follows it yet sees not its rear. Holding fast to the ancient Dao, one governs the present being. To know the ancient beginning is called the thread of the Dao.

That which is said—"Man models himself on Earth, Earth on Heaven, Heaven on the Dao, and the Dao on spontaneity"—is none other than the spontaneity of the Void. The scripture states: "The non-none is called the Dao," its meaning profoundly abstruse. It declares that without the Void and spontaneity, man cannot come into being.

The ode says:
*Within the Great Void, the body is spontaneity,
The Dao gives birth to the One qi, which divides into the ten.*
The boundless transformation spans the realm of Heaven and Earth,
The Dragon Horse and Tortoise Script convey the true principle.

These, along with the Heavenly Perfected and August Ones, all inscribe the cloud-seal of the Great Void—how can they be spoken of in the same breath?

**The Chart of the Dao’s Indistinct Wonder**
The Dao is a numinous and wondrous thing: void yet sentient, spirit-like yet formless. It eludes pursuit whether one seeks or follows; its hiddenness and manifestation cannot be fathomed. One knows not why it is so, nor why it is not so. It endlessly generates life, and thus is called the Dao.

The Master of the Valley said: "I would cease speaking, to behold the Dao’s subtlety."
Laozi said: "As a thing, the Dao is indistinct, evanescent. Evanescent! Indistinct! Yet within it are images. Indistinct! Evanescent! Yet within it are things. Dark! Obscure! Yet within it is essence. Its essence is most true; within it is sincerity. From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart, that it may survey the beginning of all things."

For all things under Heaven are born of being, and being is born of non-being. Is it the indistinct "having" or the evanescent "non-having"? To survey is to examine; the beginning is the origin. It speaks of qi emerging from non-being, initiating the transformation of the myriad beings. Among all beings, man is the most noble. If one can cultivate the Dao, one may endure long. Thus, the wonder of the Dao is where the sage holds it in reverence. Hence, the Yellow Emperor crawled on his knees to follow the wind, and Confucius, having heard the Dao at dawn, could die that evening. Herein lies the essence of the indistinct and evanescent.

In former times, the Perfected Lord cultivated the Dao on Mount Wudang for forty-two years before ascending to the Purple Empyrean, ranked among the immortals and sages. Was it not through the tortoise and serpent swallowing black tin, Heaven and Earth nurturing cinnabar? Meng the Banished Immortal said: "To bind mercury and congeal lead is to attain immortality." Yet people are mired in depravity and fail to grasp the essentials. Seeking celestial immortality while neglecting the Golden Elixir—how can one achieve the wondrous union of form and spirit? Only when form and spirit are both wondrous is the true and mysterious power concealed within.

Thus, when the Dao is about to be practiced, diligence is precious. Who does not say: "Neither near nor far, majestic and resplendent, one ascends the jade hall"? The *Book of Changes* states: "Treading the Dao’s level path, the reclusive man’s steadfastness is auspicious." Does this not speak of this very truth?

**The Chart of the Supreme Ultimate and Prior Heaven**
There is the spirit of the Great Simplicity, the qi of the Great Beginning, the essence of the Great Inception, the form of the Great Simplicity, and the Dao of the Supreme Ultimate. It has no past, no present, no beginning, no end.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: "In the *Changes* there is the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams determine good fortune and misfortune; good fortune and misfortune give rise to great undertakings." It speaks of all things possessing the Supreme Ultimate and the Two Modes, the images of the Four Images. When the Four Images and Eight Trigrams are complete yet unmoving, this is called the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is the great root of Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth divide the Supreme Ultimate; the myriad things divide Heaven and Earth. Man draws from the midst of Heaven and Earth’s true and primordial qi to be born, grow, mature, and nurtured. Observing man, one sees the embodiment of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the master says: "When qi reaches its extreme, it transforms; having transformed, it flows freely." Is not this flow the Dao? The reversal of the corpse is the movement of the Dao.

There is a thing formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth. Silent! Vast! It stands alone and does not change; it circulates without cease and may be called the Mother of all under Heaven. This Mother is the Dao—how supreme! The greatness of the Dao cannot be surpassed. The Dao has clarity and turbidity, movement and stillness. When one practices the Dao, one gives birth to spirit. If one abandons the great method, one falls into faithlessness.

**The Chart of the Three Modes in Obscure Possession**
The first and second yang lines of Qian are called the mode of Kun’s origin, the great transformation where qi congeals and sediment accumulates to form Earth. The third and fourth yang lines are called the mode of man’s origin, the great transformation where the Three Origins nurture spirit, the Nine Qi bind form, yellow and white like a chicken’s egg, Qian and Kun sharing the same pattern. The fifth and upper yang lines are called the mode of Qian’s origin, the great transformation where qi is clear, lofty, and limpid, accumulating yang to form Heaven.

It speaks of Heaven enveloping Earth, Earth residing within Heaven. That on which Earth relies is the great qi that propels it. The great qi is the movement of time. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they are still within the transformation of the Dao. The harmonious and primordial qi, through numinous change, becomes man, thus completing the Three Powers. It speaks of the obscure possession of man and things, originating from Qian and Kun. Thus, the sages of old established it, matching the records of the Great Void, benefiting the people in all things.

If one’s virtue harmonizes with the Two Modes, and one follows this path, is it not excellent? Alas, those who stray—do they not reflect?

**The Chart of Qi’s Movement**
How wondrous! Before the primordial chaos was divided, the One Qi concealed the Two Modes. After the Supreme Ultimate was separated, the Three Powers manifested, unfolding the myriad beings. The bodies of man and things are all complete; the sources of their qi and destiny are all continuous. The Brahma qi pervades all, and the ten thousand patterns unfold.

The Brahma qi is the great and pervasive Brahma qi.

**Of the All-Encompassing**

"All-encompassing" signifies the inclusion of the ten thousand existents. Of old, from the Primordial Beginning, the true essence of the Great Brahma was exalted, and the Record of the Crimson Clarity was opened. Heaven and Earth are the above and below of the myriad things; left and right are the pathways of yin and yang. Thus, generation and nurturance are inexhaustible, the array of all beginnings unfolds, and the safety or peril of the moving and the still all proceed from the movement of qi. Even for those who cultivate the Way, can they defy this?

It is said that the nine orifices and four limbs all communicate with the qi of Heaven. Moreover, the yin and yang of the hands and feet each possess their threefold divisions. The wondrous method is fully recorded in *The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: "Comprehensive Discourse on Regulating the Spirit in Accordance with the Qi of the Four Seasons"*, instructing the people on the proper use of medicines and foods—most essential to the Way. Thus, the Classic states: "Eat in accordance with the seasons, and the hundred bones will be ordered." The seasons remain ever thus, and this is indeed the foundation of health and peace.

Each year, the Five Movements and Six Qi govern, with the *Controller of Heaven* and *Controller of Earth*, the *Left Intercalary* and *Right Intercalary*. Beginning from the *jiazi* day before or after Great Cold, the first step of qi is exchanged: the wind of *Jueyin* Wood, which transforms during the *si* and *hai* years as *Controller of Heaven*, the *yin* and *shen* years as *Controller of Earth*, and the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* years as *Intercalary Qi*. This qi resides in the left bar of the human pulse, as well as in the liver and gallbladder. The liver and gallbladder generate anger, and anger harms the Three Hun. Therefore, the lofty Daoist awakens from the great dream of floating life and refines the yang spirit to endure.

At the Spring Equinox, the second step of qi is exchanged: the heat of *Shaoyin* Sovereign Fire, which transforms during the *zi* and *wu* years as *Controller of Heaven*, the *mao* and *you* years as *Controller of Earth*, and the *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, *wei*, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai* years as *Intercalary Qi*. This qi resides in the left inch of the human pulse, as well as in the heart and small intestine. The exterior and interior generate joy, and joy harms the spirit. Only the superior person remains unstained by form, directly beholding the Dao in non-arising.

By Grain in Ear, the third step of qi is exchanged: the dampness of *Taiyin* Earth (or *Taiyin* Sovereign Origin), which transforms during the *chou* and *wei* years as *Controller of Heaven*, the *chen* and *xu* years as *Controller of Earth*, and the *yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* years as *Intercalary Qi*. From the first to the third step of qi, Heaven’s qi governs. Some say the blazing of *Shaoyang* Ministerial Fire transforms the qi in the right foot of the human pulse and the Gate of Destiny, as well as in the Triple Burner. The Three generate fear, and fear harms the blood and qi. Those of insight awaken to the naturalness of gathering and dispersal, departing from the forms of things to abide in non-action.

By Great Heat, the fourth step of qi is exchanged: the dampness of *Shaoyang* Sovereign Origin (or *Taiyin* Earth), which transforms during the *yin* and *shen* years as *Controller of Heaven*, the *si* and *hai* years as *Controller of Earth*, and the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* years as *Intercalary Qi*. This qi resides in the right bar of the human pulse, as well as in the spleen and stomach. The Three generate thought, and thought harms the body. The resolute immortal perceives sounds and sights as illusory flowers, extinguishing desire to augment wisdom.

At the Autumn Equinox, the fifth step of qi is exchanged: the dryness of *Yangming* Metal, which transforms during the *mao* and *you* years as *Controller of Heaven*, the *zi* and *wu* years as *Controller of Earth*, and the *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, *wei*, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai* years as *Intercalary Qi*. This qi resides in the right inch of the human pulse, as well as in the lungs and large intestine. The Three generate sorrow, and sorrow harms the Seven Po. The true person observes worldly affairs as all empty, ever abiding in luminous clarity.

By Light Snow, the final step of qi is exchanged: the cold of *Taiyang* Water, which transforms during the *chen* and *xu* years as *Controller of Heaven*, the *chou* and *wei* years as *Controller of Earth*, and the *yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* years as *Intercalary Qi*. This qi resides in the left foot of the human pulse, as well as in the kidneys and bladder. Here, the Three generate terror, and terror harms essence. Only the perfected person accumulates the ten thousand practices in the human realm and records the thousand virtues in Heaven. From the fourth to the final step of qi, Earth’s qi governs.

Each step of qi is exchanged every sixty days. The reckoning of years and days follows the same great principle. Thus, the Dao accords with the Great Cavern, and virtue matches the true source. Profound indeed is the Cavern Real! It unites the spirits of vast generation and transforms the sequence of mighty change. By its categories, forms are received in their time. Moreover, the hundred bones of man are bounded, while the One Qi of the profound is without interruption. Those who advance in the Dao summon the uninterrupted qi to supplement the bounded form. Thus, form is the guest of qi, and qi is the master of form. When form and qi preserve one another, the manifold excellences nourish life.

There is nothing in the world not prized more than the Dao. Those who follow the transformations of the Dao endure; those who oppose the movement of qi perish. They sigh as the sun and moon hasten onward. If one does not say: "Is there a time for words? The time does not come again." Thus, they regard wealth and honor as dust, contemplate life and death with equanimity, and restrain the mind of man.

The Dao bestows appearance, Heaven bestows qi, and Earth bestows form. The single cavity of the spirit gate is called the *Celestial Center*. Above the *Celestial Center*, Heaven’s qi governs; below it, Earth’s qi governs. At the division of qi’s intersection, human qi follows. The transmission speaks of the Six Qi: yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. They are divided into the four seasons and ordered as the nodes of the Five Phases.

The Three Yin signify emptiness; the Three Yang, fullness. Wind is *xun*; rain is *kan*. Darkness is the rest of yin; brightness, the waning of yang. As the almanac states: Each year, the qi of the celestial revolution totals twenty-four. From *Beginning of Spring*, *Awakening of Insects*, and *Pure Brightness* are the seasonal nodes of spring; within them, *Rain Water*, *Spring Equinox*, and *Grain Rain* are the mid-season qi of spring. Next, *Beginning of Summer*, *Grain in Ear*, and *Lesser Heat* are the seasonal nodes of summer; within them, *Lesser Fullness*, *Summer Solstice*, and *Greater Heat* are the mid-season qi of summer. Then, *Beginning of Autumn*, *White Dew*, and *Cold Dew* are the seasonal nodes of autumn; within them, *End of Heat*, *Autumn Equinox*, and *Frost’s Descent* are the mid-season qi of autumn. Finally, *Beginning of Winter*, *Greater Snow*, and *Lesser Cold* are the seasonal nodes of winter; within them, *Lesser Snow*, *Winter Solstice*, and *Greater Cold* are the mid-season qi of winter.

The earth phase governs the ends of the four seasons, each presiding for eighteen days. The aforementioned qi collectively govern the governance of the four seasons and the five phases. Moreover, the waxing and waning of qi are discerned only by the lofty scholar. To earnestly instruct others in this is to prolong life; to recklessly defy it is to invite calamity. One ought to distance oneself from extremes of cold, heat, warmth, and chill, and earnestly align with the Dao of Heaven to nurture the primordial qi. For this primordial qi is difficult to accumulate yet easy to dissipate—its secret lies within the *Discourse on Regulating the Spirit in Accordance with the Four Qi*.

Thus, the sage harmonizes with the movements of qi, as though transcending human emotions to attain longevity. Therefore, the superior scholar integrates and comprehends this principle in the same manner. As the *Rites* states: "The emotions of humans—joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, aversion, and desire—these seven arise without being learned." Yet if one follows them, one remains ordinary; if one masters them, one becomes sagely.

Should one diligently cultivate the *Great Cavern of Primordial Perfection*, all emotions must be wholly eradicated, for they gnaw at the roots of yin and yang. Thus, one approaches the Dao, transcends the realm of generation and transformation, and ascends to the boundless realm of freedom. Supreme joy is serene and radiant—how could this be neglected?

Here ends the *Illustrated Scripture of the Wondrous Primordial Perfection of the Great Cavern*.
