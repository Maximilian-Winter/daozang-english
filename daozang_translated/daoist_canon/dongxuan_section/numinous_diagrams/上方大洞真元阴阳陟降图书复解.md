**Postscript to the *Chart of the Supreme Cavern’s True Primordial Yin-Yang Ascent and Descent***

How vast! The Qian and Kun are the great sovereign lords of the four seasons; Fu and Shen are the lesser parents of the myriad things. Thus, Qian begins its generation at *zi* and concludes with Kan at *yin*. Kun first brings forth at *wu* and completes with Li at *shen*. This accords with the celestial seasons.

From *zi* to *si*, yang hardens and takes action; from *wu* to *hai*, yin lies horizontally and abides. Thus, among all things under heaven, there is not one that does not possess yin and yang. Moreover, the mutual resonance of yin and yang is the natural Dao.

It is also said: *zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu* are the yang of Qian; *wei*, *si*, *chou*, *hai*, and *you* are the yin of Kun. Yang propels the Five Fortunes outward—"outward" meaning like land. The Five Fortunes are longevity, wealth, health, peace, and good virtue ending in destiny. Thus, yang is auspicious and bestows the Five Fortunes upon the outer and upper realms.

Yin conceals the Six Extremities and draws them downward—"downward" meaning below. The Six Extremities are misfortune, short life, premature death, illness, sorrow, and poverty—weakness and evil. Thus, yin is inauspicious and relegates the Six Extremities to retreat and decline.

Yin and yang are mutually seeking entities. Therefore, the exalted is the position of yang, and the lowly is the position of yin. It is also said: yang is the noble person, and yin is the petty person. Whether drumming or resting, weeping or singing, the dispositions of petty persons are exhausted therein. At times, the foolish below may harm the noble. When the noble person’s destiny has not yet come to fruition and contends with them by force, it leads to obstruction and unresolved entanglement.

Since ancient times, noble persons who could not bear the petty and thus incurred calamity have been many. When the noble person knows there is nothing to be done, they say: "Only through defilement, humiliation, and abasement does the Dao esteem." Thus, they humble their words, conceal their traces, act without contention. In this way, they ultimately evade the blame of petty persons.

*Xunzi* said: "That which follows its kind is called fortune; that which opposes its kind is called misfortune." *Guan Yinzi* said: "Do not slight petty persons. Petty persons harm the state. Only by harmonizing with petty persons can one align with great persons." Great persons are those whose virtue matches heaven and earth.

All that is received in life and destiny arises from the endowment of yin and yang within. The tortoise hides within the sea, the White Prime revels in joy, water descends and fire resides without—after nine years, great accomplishment is achieved.

Taking the sun and moon as the model for change, that which employs the one without separation is none other than Kan not departing from fire. As with humans: having crossed, life begins; not yet crossed, it ends.

In the creation of ancient characters, the curved river of yin’s feminine *qi* of the One can grant long life to people. It must rely on the fire of the solar palace and the water of the lunar mansion, uniting with the curved river of yang’s masculine crystal of the One. Thus, the One is born from the Two, and the Three Primes are completed—namely, the Primordial of Qian, the Primordial of Kun, and the Primordial of Humanity.

Humans emulate the Two Modes to align with the Dao. Gao Xiangxian sang:

*"Have you not seen? Shu Tong served Wei Boyang,*
*Together they laughed and entered the land of nothingness.*
*Following the* Lianshan *they composed the* Cantongqi*,*
*Leaving it as the eternal king of elixirs."*

The *Lianshan* was the original name of the *Book of Changes*. It is also said:

*"The sun is Li, the moon is Kan;*
*Sun and moon as Change devour each other.*
*When the golden crow dies, the jade hare is born;*
*The myriad things arise from heaven and earth’s resonance."*

The *Book of Changes* says: "Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things transform in purity." Is this not what it refers to? The *Book of Rites* states: "Only when heaven and earth unite do the myriad things flourish." The *Commentary* says: "Neither yin alone nor yang alone can generate; only the union of the three brings forth life." The *Book of Documents* says: "The Dao ascends and descends; only the perfected person embodies this."

Thus, the *Supreme Cavern Scripture of Great Purity* declares: "Above, open the gate of immortality; below, seal the pass of death. The White Emperor of the Western Florescence becomes the spirit that gives me life."

Meng the Banished Immortal, enlightened by the Dao of embracing the One, said first: "Embody yin and yang within the indistinct and vague; discern movement and stillness within the subtle and profound." Second: "Spirit is stored in the Celestial Valley; *qi* flows into the Cinnabar Prime." Third: "When fire is kindled, it burns away all impurities; when water flows, it aids the hundred passes." How fitting!

Yet some discourse exceeds the bounds of yin and yang’s alternation—are they not to be feared? Little do they know: the myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the *qi* of the center. This is acceptable.

Only by advancing in the Dao can one attain distant equality. If one acts in accordance with it, they can receive luminous blessings. Thus, when Jizi attained long life, he was marked as the first of the Five Fortunes, aspiring to the age of the tortoise and ranked among the Three Joys. What in the human realm is more esteemed than this?

The only concern is that practitioners of cultivation fail to revere their *qi*, honor their form, preserve their life, and cherish their spirit. This is the fault of self-inflicted decay. Alas!

**Chart of the Four Images**

How towering and great! Heaven and earth do not speak, yet the four seasons proceed, and the hundred creatures are born. Do not all things sprout in spring, grow in summer, mature in autumn, and store in winter?

Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: "The myriad things emerge from Zhen"—Zhen is the east. "They are arrayed in Xun"—Xun is the southeast. "Arrayed" means the myriad things are pure and orderly. "Li is brightness"—all things become visible; it is the trigram of the south. "Kun is earth"—all things receive nourishment therein. Thus, it is said: "They are employed in Kun."

**Chart of the Four Images (continued)**

Dui is the true autumn, the season in which all things delight—thus it is said: "Joy is spoken of in Dui." They contend in Qian—Qian is the trigram of the northwest, signifying the struggle of yin and yang. Kan is water, the trigram of the true north, the trigram of toil, the place to which all things return—thus it is said: "Toil is in Kan." Gen is the trigram of the northeast, where all things reach their completion and begin anew—thus it is said: "Completion is spoken of in Gen."

Therefore, the ancient sages, drawing upon the proper seasons of things, enriched and nourished the world, so that the multitudes never lacked. They harmonized with the sequence of the four seasons. The east corresponds to spring—*chun* (spring) means *chun* (stirring), for it brings forth the myriad things; this is sageliness. The south corresponds to summer—*xia* (summer) means *jia* (extension), for it nurtures, fosters, and sustains growth; this is benevolence. The west corresponds to autumn—*qiu* (autumn) means *chou* (sorrow), for in autumn, things are examined and guarded in due season; this is righteousness. The north corresponds to winter—*dong* (winter) means *zhong* (center), and *zhong* means *cang* (concealment).

The *Records* state: "The Dao takes the four seasons as its handle, and thus affairs may be encouraged." The *Music* says: "Spring creates, summer grows—this is benevolence; autumn gathers, winter stores—this is righteousness." Only the true person can align with these seasons through benevolence, righteousness, and the Dao.

Thus, the true person, hands clasped behind, sings:
*"Vast are the four seasons,
Boundless is the single qi,
Radiant are the sages."*

**Chart of the Five Phases’ Transitions**
The Viscount of Ji said: "Heaven bestowed upon Yu the *Hong Fan*’s nine categories, the first of which is the Five Phases." The saying that "Heaven One generates water, Earth Two generates fire, Heaven Three generates wood, Earth Four generates metal, Heaven Five generates earth" refers to the generative numbers of the Five Phases. The subsequent sequence—water as six, fire as seven, wood as eight, metal as nine, earth as ten—constitutes the completion numbers of the Five Phases.

Further, it is said: From the onset of spring, wood reigns; from the onset of summer, fire reigns; from the onset of autumn, metal reigns; from the onset of winter, water reigns—each for seventy-two days. At the end of each of the four seasons, earth reigns for eighteen days. This is the mutual succession of the Five Phases’ dominion.

Again, it is said: Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water—this is called the mutual generation of the Five Phases. Conversely, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water—this is called the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases.

Only Heaven generates the four seasons and Five Phases, while the sages named them. All things fill the space between heaven and earth, yet the greatest and most numerous among them are the Five Phases. In their application to humanity, none of these five can be lacking for life to persist.

The *Rites* state: "The Five Phases form the essence, and thus affairs may be restored." Only those who possess the Dao can trace the source of the single qi and master the laws of the Five Phases’ transitions. If one internally loses the rectitude of the Three Origins and externally strays into the depravity of the Nine Orifices, death will surely follow—how true are these words!

The song says:
*"Great are the Five Phases,
In their relation to humanity!
Used with the Dao, they bring prosperity;
Without the Dao, they bring peril."*

This pattern of principles originates from the teachings of the Perfected One of True Yang:
*"Rushing forth, the great Dao roams the heavens,
Drawing the three carts with sixteen oxen.
The Four Images and Five Phases gather in a single grasp—
Then comes the pulling of sinews and the changing of bones."*

**Chart of the Eight Trigrams and Six Changes**
The trigrams of the *Book of Changes* model the functions of heaven and earth. Qian above is heaven—Qian above represents heaven, in humanity the head, and below, the earth. Kun below is earth—Kun above represents heaven, in humanity the abdomen, and below, Kun.

Qian and Kun are the root of heaven and earth, the great parents of yin, yang, and the myriad things. Kan in heaven is the moon, in humanity the ears, and on earth, water. Li in heaven is the sun, in humanity the eyes, and on earth, fire.

Thus, the immortals use Qian and Kun as the cauldron and metal, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances. When the qi of heaven and earth, yin and yang, intermingle and harmonize, the myriad things are born and thrive, achieving unimpeded flow. *Tai* (Peace) means "unobstructed." When heaven and earth unite, they descend sweet dew—this is called *Jiji* (Completion).

Fire flames upward, and water moistens downward, yet when water is placed above fire, it does not lose its nature. Once the principle of mutual completion is achieved, all endeavors reach perfection—thus, the great work of the world is accomplished. If one acts during the time of *Jiji*, one must proceed with reverent caution.

When heaven and earth enclose and communicate in *Tai*, the four seasons contain their spiritual qi and Dao. When Kan and Li unite in *Jiji*, the hundred things attain their fixed forms. The Master of Azure Radiance instructed the Daoist: "Have you not seen the bricks at the kiln’s head, shattered by rain? They have never endured water and fire. But if water and fire refine them into tiles, they endure among humanity for ten thousand years." Unfeeling clay vessels, once perfected by water and fire, become firm and indestructible—how much more should the cultivator of truth attain longevity!

It is further said: Zhen is the feet, Xun the thighs, Gen the mountain and hands, as well as the nose. The nose is the mountain of the face. The nose opens like the mouth, and mouth and nose communicate qi—thus, mountains and marshes communicate qi. Next, it is said: Dui is the marsh and the mouth.

Formerly, the Yellow Emperor received the oral instructions of the Heavenly True Sovereign at Mount Jing, where he cast a tripod. The tripod’s three legs represented essence, qi, and spirit, sufficient to ascend the clouds. The scriptures say: "When the primordial qi is transformed and refined, one becomes an immortal." The secret of ascending in flight lies in the *Gui Cang*.

The six changes refer to Qian progressing from the first yang to the top yang, and Kun from the first yin to the top yin. Whether there is change or no change in the middle, the time lies in the correct yang numbers of heaven. Observing the multitude of trigrams, all follow this pattern.

Long ago, when the dragon emerged from the River, the eight trigrams revealed their images; when the lin was wounded in the marsh, the Ten Wings manifested their functions. The Master sang: *"In the age of Tang and Yu, the lin and phoenix roamed—now is not their time, what do they seek? O lin, O lin, my heart is heavy."* Moreover, when the noble one meets their time, they mount their chariot; when they do not, they wander like tumbleweed. The Fisherman’s song says: *"When the Canglang’s waters run clear, they can wash my cap’s tassels; when they run muddy, they can wash my feet."* Thus, those who know when to advance or retreat, to preserve or perish, and never lose their correctness—are they not the sages alone?

Yet, in the human realm, one must adapt to gains and losses, fullness and emptiness, moving with the times. *Fa Yan* states: *"The sage is keen of perception, profound in wisdom, inheriting heaven and measuring the numinous, surpassing all mortals, weaving the patterns of all norms."*

**Nine Palaces and Seven Primordials Diagram**
How wise were the ancients! The historians’ eulogies say: *"The River Chart ordained Fu Xi; the Luo Script bestowed Yu."* It tells how Fu Xi first drew the dragon-horse bearing the River Chart to manifest the eight trigrams. Yu was granted the dark jade tablet, and the turtle-script emerged from the Luo River, whence he expounded the Nine Categories, detailing the numbers of the nine palaces: the sixth palace is Qian, the first palace Kan, the eighth palace Gen, the third palace Zhen, the fourth palace Xun, the ninth palace Li, the second palace Kun, the seventh palace Dui, and the central palace is five.

Next, the colors of the nine palaces: only black must not be violated. For green-blue governs sores and ulcers, while red and yellow still arise from sorrow and illness. Observing the Way of Great Simplicity, only white is the beneficial direction. Each year and month, its pattern is greatly illuminated, fully recorded in annotated almanacs, shifting through the flying diagrams.

Some say of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials: to clarify the year-white, month-white, and day-white—the Way of the three yangs and three yins. Further, the Three Primordials: the celestial numbers are twenty-five—one, three, five, seven, nine; the terrestrial numbers are thirty—two, four, six, eight, ten. In total, fifty-five, from which the terrestrial ten, the terminal numbers, are excluded, leaving forty-five—namely, the Celestial Primordial, Human Primordial, and Terrestrial Primordial. Thus, the fifteen in crosswise and lengthwise arrangement are wondrous beyond measure.

Moreover, as heaven and earth generate the myriad things, only the Human Primordial corresponds to the reckoning of the nine palaces, situated between the Celestial and Terrestrial Primordials. With this hard-won body, how could one not diligently advance in the Way? Would that not be perverse?

The Recluse of Mystery and Stillness states: The Dao of refining mercury and subduing cinnabar lies entirely in "three on the left and seven on the right." Two and four serve as the shoulders, six and eight as the knees and feet. Nine is worn upon the head, one is trodden beneath the feet. The five palaces of the abdomen are august, with the central square complete when the auspicious arrival is in the center. The merit covers the eight directions, and the wondrous function is perfected through the Three Primordials.

Thus, there are the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, which the sages took as their model. The character for Dao (道) in ancient script is composed of *yuan* (元) and *shou* (首), signifying the origin of all dharmas and the head of all sages. The character for virtue (德) is composed of *zhi* (直) and *xin* (心), denoting an upright heart and the contemplation of emptiness and forgetfulness.

To guide the benighted and align with the Great Principle is the Dao of the Former Masters. To attain the inner elixir of returning cinnabar and achieve merit without loss is the virtue of the superior adept. Applied to governing the state, it brings profound peace; applied to cultivating the self, it leads to enduring existence. Such is the ultimate attainment—is it not sublime?

Emperor Ming of Tang regarded the *Tongxuan Daode Zhenjing*, the *Zhouyi*, and the *Nanhua Zhenjing* as the Three Profound Studies—was this not fitting?

**Illustrated Charts of Immortal Cultivation and Realization of the True**
How extraordinary! To live between heaven and earth—even if granted a lifespan of a hundred years—is like a swift steed passing a crack. How many fail to nurture their allotted years? Alas!

The true person, however, is not thus. By perpetually establishing fasts and setting up jiao rites, and by repeatedly bestowing alms to relieve the multitude, they cultivate the Dao to instruct others, illuminating sincerity and revering their teacher. The perfected person, through virtue, attains communion with the divine; the superior adept, through subtlety, ascends to heaven. Without the study of immortal arts and the refinement of form, how could this be achieved?

Those who diligently advance in the Great Cavern Dao will naturally move the eight directions of heaven and earth, causing the vital qi of the correct unity to descend from the sun, moon, and stars, flowing into the palaces of their body. The qi of the four seasons—spring’s warmth, summer’s heat, autumn’s chill, and winter’s cold—responds without speech and arrives unbidden.

Thus, by returning the qi of the upper heavens to govern the form of the great earth, auspicious clouds open at the Gate of Life, and propitious mists seal the Portal of Death. Thereupon, the luminous essence of flying mystery descends to stabilize the Mud Pill Palace and Crimson Palace within the human body, regulating the five qi, harmonizing the hundred spirits. After ten revolutions of returning numinosity and myriad qi uniting in transcendence—such is the immortal Dao, which treasures life and universally delivers beings.

Fortunate is the one who, having received deliverance in this embodied existence, attains eternal endurance through kalpas, fully partakes in the wondrous Dao, and is rightly called a perfected person. The perfected person who embodies the Dao moves through the world with lofty virtue, comprehends the myriad things with all-encompassing knowledge, and employs the divine without limitation.

The noble person is likewise. The Dao of the noble person lies in reverence, respect, kindness, and righteousness. It values guarding the feminine, enduring humiliation, and embracing impurity—this is the model of the highest wisdom, yet the common people often reverse it.

Thus, one of complete virtue acts when the moment is ripe, not waiting for the day to end. When the time is to stop, they stop; when the time is to act, they act. Their emergence and withdrawal always align with the opportune moment; their actions and concealment never conflict with adaptability. In advancement, they benefit the world; in retreat, they perfect themselves. The enlightened scholars of old were ever engaged in this—who was it, if not Master Zhuang?

When the King of Chu marched on a distant campaign, his robes trailed in the mud like a turtle’s tail; when the Prime Minister of Liang flew into a rage, he was met with mockery as stale as a rotten rat. How worthy was Yanzi, content with a single basket of food in his humble alley! How sagely was Confucius, resting his arm as a pillow to drink plain water! Xu You delighted in the Dao by the banks of the Ying, while Bing Bo found fulfillment at Gongshou. These were all talents who transcended the mundane, scholars who embraced the profound.

Thus, the superior person aligns with the Dao, and Heaven naturally comes to their aid. The great Dao lies broad and level, not far from the self—cultivate it within, and one’s virtue becomes true. As jade must be carved to become a vessel, so must one study to grasp the Dao. The *Rites* states: "The great Dao is not confined to any vessel." Here, the nine palaces are arranged thus: Li in the south, Kun in the southwest, Dui in the west, and the central palace, five, corresponds to Si. Next, the nine palaces and their associated colors—only black must not be violated. For green-blue governs sores and ulcers, while red and yellow arise from worry and illness. Observing the Dao of the Great Simplicity, only white serves as the beneficial direction. Each year and month, its pattern shines brightly, as recorded in annotated almanacs, shifting through the flying stars.

Some speak of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yuan, clarifying the whiteness of the year, month, and day—this is the Dao of the three yangs and three yins. Further, the three Yuans correspond to the celestial number twenty-five (one, three, five, seven, nine) and the terrestrial number thirty (two, four, six, eight, ten). Summing these gives fifty-five; subtracting the ten terminal numbers of earth leaves forty-five, which are the Heavenly Yuan, Human Yuan, and Earthly Yuan. Thus, the fifteenfold permutations in all directions are wondrous beyond measure.

Moreover, as Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things, only the Human Yuan aligns with the nine palaces’ reckoning, situated between the Heavenly and Earthly Yuans. With this rare and precious body, how could one not hasten to advance in the Dao? Would that not be foolish indeed?

The Recluse of Mystery and Obscurity states: The Dao of refining mercury and subduing cinnabar lies entirely in "three on the left and seven on the right." Two and four serve as the shoulders, six and eight as the knees and feet. Nine is worn upon the head, one is trodden beneath the feet. The five palaces of the abdomen are ruled by the radiant central square, thus completing the pattern. Its merit spans the eight directions, its wondrous function perfected through the three Yuans.

Thus, the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* were emulated by the sages. The character for Dao (道) in ancient script combines *yuan* (元) and *shou* (首), signifying the origin of all dharmas and the foremost of all sages. The character for virtue (德) combines *zhi* (直) and *xin* (心), denoting an upright heart and the contemplation of emptiness and forgetfulness.

To guide the ignorant and align with the Great Principle is the Dao of the Former Masters. To attain the inner elixir and achieve enduring accomplishment is the virtue of the superior adept. Applied to governing the state, it brings profound peace; applied to cultivating the self, it leads to eternal existence. Such attainment is the ultimate—how could it not be exalted?

Emperor Ming of Tang regarded the *True Scripture of Penetrating Mystery and Virtue*, the *Book of Changes*, and the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* as the Three Profound Studies—was this not fitting?

**Illustrated Charts of Immortal Cultivation and True Refinement**
How extraordinary! For one born between Heaven and Earth, even if granted a lifespan of a hundred years, it passes like a horse galloping past a crack. Those who fail to nurture their allotted years—alas!

The perfected, however, are not thus. They constantly establish purification rites and perform offerings, frequently bestowing alms and aiding the multitude. Thus, they cultivate the Dao to instruct others, illuminating sincerity and revering their teachers. The perfected attain virtue and commune with the divine; superior adepts grasp the wondrous and ascend to Heaven. How could those who do not study immortality and refine their forms achieve this?

Whenever one sits to advance in the Great Cavern’s Dao, they perceive the eight directions of Heaven and Earth, the descending vital qi of the sun, moon, stars, and Orthodox Unity, flowing into the palaces of their body. The four seasonal qi—spring’s warmth, summer’s heat, autumn’s chill, winter’s cold—respond without speech and arrive unbidden.

Thus, the adept harnesses Heaven’s qi to govern Earth’s form, whereupon auspicious clouds open at the Gate of Life and propitious mists seal the Portal of Death. Then, the luminous essence of Flying Mystery descends to stabilize the Crimson Palace of the Mud Pill, harmonizing the five qi and uniting the hundred spirits. After ten revolutions of the numinous and myriad qi coalescing, all attain immortality.

The immortal Dao treasures life, delivering countless beings. Fortunate is the one whose body receives deliverance, enduring through eternal kalpas, attaining the wondrous Dao, and being named a Perfected. The Perfected embodies the Dao, their lofty influence pervading the world, their knowledge encompassing the myriad things, their spiritual efficacy boundless.

The noble person is likewise. The Dao of the noble person lies in reverence, respect, kindness, and righteousness. It values guarding the feminine, embracing disgrace, enduring defilement—this is the model of the highest wisdom, yet the common people often oppose it. Thus, those who preserve virtue act upon opportunity without delay, stopping when the time is right, advancing when the time is right. Their conduct and withdrawal always align with timing, their actions and concealment never contravene adaptability. In advancement, they benefit all under Heaven; in retreat, they perfect themselves. The enlightened scholars of old invariably pursued this—who else but Master Zhuang?

When the King of Chu led distant expeditions, he dragged the tails of turtles through mud; when the Prime Minister of Liang grew enraged, he was met with mockery for his rotten-mouse pride. How worthy was Yanzi, content with a single basket of food in his humble alley! How sagely was Confucius, resting his arm for a pillow and drinking plain water! Xu You delighted in the Dao by the banks of the Ying, while Bing Bo realized his ambition at Gongshou. These were all talents who transcended the mundane, scholars who revered the profound.

Thus, the superior person aligns with the Dao and is aided as if by Heaven itself. The great Dao lies broad and level, not far from the self—cultivate it within, and one’s virtue becomes true. As jade must be carved to become a vessel, so must one study to grasp the Dao. The *Rites* states: "The great Dao is not confined to any vessel," yet it is present everywhere. Moreover, the golden scriptures teach: if one cherishes their form, preserves their spirit, values their qi, and secures their root, the body shall not decay in death, and in the end, one may ascend in flight—can this not be called immortality?

The charts of the Golden Gates in the celestial court are luminous indeed! The heavenly net ensnares all. For the gravest of sins, how could curses suffice? For the rarest of transgressions, how could punishment be light? Yet the radiance of Heaven and Earth endures—only through conduct and merit. The enlightened scholars of old all accumulated the merit of emptying the heart and refining the true, then amassed deeds to aid the state and save the people. As for those who mastered qi through non-action, they ascended to the ranks of the immortals, for they possessed wisdom vast and principles unmatched by the common crowd. Thus, their forms and spirits attained perfection, harmonizing with the primal origin.

I have heard that on Mount Wei, which does not turn back, Prince Jin played his flute and ascended to the Silver River; by the Liao River, which flows but once, Lord Ding transformed into a crane and soared to the jade skies. Then he left behind his song:
*"Ding Lingwei, transformed into a crane, returns after a thousand years—*
*the city walls remain, but the people are gone.*
*Why not learn the Dao? Graves lie piled high."*

Later, the cypress and juniper of Zhaozhou all became Buddhas, while Master Xu’s chickens and dogs all ascended as immortals. The scholar of Wu, in his lyrics, wrote:
*"Behold the youthful face, the preserved hair,*
*soaring in flight, controlling shadows,*
*bowing to the decree of Jingyang."*

The recluses said:
*"How grand is the empty-hearted Master Pang!*
*How wondrous is the life-mastering Lord Xu!*
*Their entire families ascended together into the azure clouds!"*

Ah! The forest wind howls, the mountain stream murmurs. Plum and bamboo rustle, while phoenixes sing beyond the emerald heavens; pines stand dense, while [ ] barks amid the white clouds. Then, the feathered chariots and jade carriages emerge from being and enter non-being. I, your servant, approach the imperial capital, awaiting commands in the jeweled palace—all this is the result of reverently serving the true origin of the Great Cavern.

As the saying goes:
*"Bright, bright is the High Heaven,*
*illuminating the earth below.*
*When one’s merit is complete and virtue perfected,*
*they leave the mortal dust,*
*ride the auspicious mist,*
*and pay homage at the gates of the Great Clarity."*

Here concludes the *Chart of the Ascent and Descent of the True Origin of the Great Cavern in the Upper Realms, Yin and Yang*.
