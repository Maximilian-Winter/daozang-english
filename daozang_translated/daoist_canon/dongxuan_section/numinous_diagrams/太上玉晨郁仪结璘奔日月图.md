*The Supreme Jade Dawn Esoteric Diagram of Yu Yi and Jie Lin Racing the Sun and Moon*

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Jade Dawn Esoteric Diagram of Yu Yi and Jie Lin Racing the Sun and Moon*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Compiled from excerpts of *The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* and adapted into one scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Sacred Diagrams*.

---

The *Central Chapter of the Supreme Hidden Writ* states: Should you aspire to perfection, you must visualize the Sun Lord, riding dragons and phoenixes, borne upon celestial radiance and clouds. Journey eastward to the Forest of Rarities, then enter the Gate of the Emperor. Through concentrated meditation, you shall attain it—this essential Dao is not arduous. Your name shall ascend to the Numinous Clarity, where you shall be ranked among the Perfected Officials and wield the *Script of Yu Yi*.

The *Central Chapter of the Supreme Hidden Writ* further states: Should you seek to ascend to Heaven, you must visualize the Moon Lady, driving ten celestial dragons, mounted upon my flowing chimes. Travel westward to the Six Ridges, then enter the Emperor’s Hall. Through concentrated meditation, you shall behold her and ascend to pay homage to the Celestial August. There, you shall wield the *Seal of Jie Lin*.

The esoteric Dao of racing the sun and moon, as described above, is treasured and concealed by the Supreme Clarity, the Great Ultimate, the Nine August Ones, and the Four Perfected. It is the jade script of the Mysterious Void Primordial Lady. Unless one’s name is inscribed in the Golden Pavilion and recorded in the Eastern Florescence, they shall never hear even the titles of these two chapters.

To practice this, one must first purify through a hundred days of abstention, severing all worldly affairs, before it may be undertaken. With prolonged practice, one shall ascend to race the sun and moon, and be granted fifty jade boys and fifty jade maidens as attendants.

The *Crimson Script of Yu Yi* and the *Yellow Seal of Jie Lin* are the sacred and secret texts of the Supreme Jade Emperor Lord. They are concealed within the chambers of the Nine Heavens, upon the Cinnabar-Jade Terrace. None may see or hear of them save those who diligently cultivate the Dao with a sincere heart, and who bear the predestined register of the Flying Mystery Celestial Immortals. Even to speak their titles carelessly is forbidden. Those who transgress shall be examined by the Three Officials, and neither Heaven nor Earth shall absolve them.

Initially, the scripture was permitted to be transmitted to one person every three hundred years. Afterward, for seven hundred years, it may again be transmitted to one person. If the numinous perfected or hidden spirits deem someone worthy of receiving it, it shall be passed on. The method of transmission is through master and disciple, in accordance with the statutes of the Revered Mystery. To transmit it to the unworthy, or to violate the precepts, is to leak and profane celestial writ. Those who betray their oaths through negligence shall become lowly ghosts after death, and their seven generations of ancestors shall suffer the punishments of the wind-knife.

Unless bound by shared destiny, one should remain silent.

On the Terrace of the Western Mystery Mountain, these two scriptures are inscribed upon jade tablets in golden characters. They are also present, though not in full, in the Pure Void Heaven of Wangwu. The immortals of the Central Palace and the various officials of the Grand Clarity do not even know what these texts pertain to.

Within the stone chamber’s pivot at the northern cavern of Mount Emei, twenty characters are carved into the stone: *"Yu Yi draws the essence of the sun; Jie Lin summons the spirit of the moon. Attaining the Dao, one dwells in the Upper Palace, ranked as a Perfected of Great Courage."* Lesser immortals who see this find themselves utterly unable to comprehend its meaning. Many such immortals have never even glimpsed the titles or registers of these texts.

The Golden Liquid and Nine Elixirs are but minor arts, all insufficient to ascend to the Upper Clarity. To practice this Dao, one need not be wise or foolish—only that such texts do not exist in the mortal realm. The true methods of the Mysterious Law are transmitted only after vows are sworn. Those who obtain and practice them attain the rank of Upper Perfected, then ride the Eight Radiance Jade Wheels, roaming the Nine Mornings. Thus, the secret words say: *"Only when you master Yu Yi and Jie Lin do you become a Perfected of the Upper Clarity. Without cultivating this Dao, you cannot behold the Three Primordial Lords."*

The Perfected of the Great Simplicity said: *"Store within you the essence of the sun and the Five Emperor Lords; hold in your mouth the scripture of the Supreme Yu Yi. Only when this Dao is accomplished will you meet the Lord of the Sun. Without it, your efforts are in vain, and you will only bring distress upon yourself."* He also said: *"Store within you the essence of the moon and the Five Empress Ladies; hold in your mouth the chapter of the Supreme Jie Lin. Only when this Dao is accomplished will you meet the Lady of the Moon. Without it, your efforts are in vain, and you will only invite sorrow."* These two passages were the oral instructions the Perfected of the Great Simplicity received from the Supreme Thearch.

The *Hidden Writ of the Supreme* states: *"When storing, grasp it."* The Thearch said: *"Hold it in your mouth."* The Perfected of the Great Simplicity taught Lord Pei that when storing, one should hold one scripture in the mouth and grasp another, practicing both simultaneously. The Perfected of the Great Simplicity transmitted to the Perfected of Pure Numinosity, Lord Pei, these two matters—the scriptures of the Supreme Yu Yi and Jie Lin—to summon the spirits of the sun and moon, ascend to the sun and moon, and traverse the celestial radiance to soar through the Great Void. All ride cloud chariots and feathered canopies, driving a host of dragons to ascend to the Purple Court of the August Heaven.

The *Inner Vision of the Central Realm* says: *"If you wish to walk the void, store the sun and moon within. If you wish to ascend to the Pure Numinosity, store the Five Stars within. Practice in secret, never leaving your chamber—this is the way."* The *Plain Memorial of the Cinnabar Talismans* states: *"Great is Yu Yi! Wondrous is Jie Lin! They are unseen by lesser Perfected, unheard by lesser immortals. Through them, one summons the spirits of the sun, moon, and Five Essences, rides dragons to walk the void, and treads upon radiant clouds. Following the Five Emperors, one enters the Gate of Heaven. Whoever hears of this must not speak carelessly. Only when leaving the mortal world may it be transmitted, and only after swearing a golden oath. It must be entrusted to disciples of sincere heart. Those who recklessly reveal its contents will be reported by the Jade Lads, punished, and barred from immortality. The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens will depart, never to return, and the scriptures will be lost. One will incur the judgment of the Three Officials. Beware of speech, for words are the source of transgression."*

The *Purport of the Jade Hall* of the Sun Palace states: *"At dawn on the first day of the lunar month, sit in quietude, purify yourself, and settle your mind. Strike your teeth thirty-six times. First, visualize your cinnabar field as a great sea, the sun rising from it. Your body sits atop your crown, solid as mountain stone. Recite the incantation: *'Yang arises from the Primordial Sea, ascending from below. The undifferentiated yang essence scatters the host of yin. Within it dwells a great spirit, the Lord Yu Yi. Descend with this true qi to bathe my form.'*"*

The *Purport of the Jade Hall* states: *"After reciting the incantation, swallow saliva nine times. Next, visualize the sun rising, its golden light illuminating your true form. Face the Sun Palace and recite the incantation: *'The Golden Wheel manifests its auspice, resplendent with yang brightness. The flaming radiance soars, streaming essence for ten thousand li. Demonic vapors extinguish their flames; dust and filth are swept clean. Ascend through emptiness, riding qi on high.'*"*

The *Purport of the Jade Hall* states: *"After reciting the incantation, swallow saliva nine times. Then, mount the fire dragon and hasten to the Sun Palace. Recite the incantation: *'The fire dragon leads the way, piercing the crown with flying light. The spirit enters the boundless, paying homage to Yu Yi. In an instant, ascend and merge with the numinous radiance. The One True follows its origin, burning away the corpse of Peng.'*"*

The *Purport of the Jade Hall* states: *"After reciting the incantation, swallow saliva nine times and contemplate entering the Sun Palace, merging with your body as one. After a long while, forget your form, warm as spring. Practicing this for one year dispels illness, commands ghosts and spirits, and allows natural coming and going. After two years, one attains communion with immortals and receives the attendance of the Three Realms. After three years, the Demon Kings will vouch for you."*

After nine years of practice, the Five Emperors descend to befriend you, and a decree is issued to name you a *Zhenren* (Perfected One), granting you eternal life.

The *Supreme Jade Dawn’s* *Yu Yi’s Hastening Gaze Red Radiance Jade Scripture* states: The method of *cai fu fei gen* (gathering and ingesting flying roots) and swallowing the qi of the sun was once transmitted by the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. It is also called the *Red Cinnabar Metal Essence Stone Radiance Water Mother Jade Embryo Scripture*. The practice is as follows: At sunrise, face east and click your teeth nine times. Then, softly invoke the names of the sun’s soul and the five emperors within it:

*Sun Soul, Vermilion Radiance, Illuminating Veil, Green Reflected Glow, Rosy Clouds, Crimson Youth, Mystic Flame, Whirling Simurgh.*

Recite these sixteen characters while holding your fists firmly. Visualize the five-colored streaming radiance within the sun approaching your body, with the sunlight and flowing radiance both entering your mouth.

The *Purple Scripture of the Upper Clarity* states: The method of swallowing the essence of the moon is practiced at moonrise. Face west and click your teeth ten times. Softly invoke the names of the moon’s spirit and the Lady of the Moon:

*Moon Spirit, Warm and Serene, Fragrant and Luminous, Veiled and Vast, Graceful and Void, Numinous Orchid, Luxuriant Blossom, Jade Petals, Pure Gold, Limpid and Bright, Radiant Countenance, Terrace’s Standard.*

Recite these twenty-four characters, then close your eyes and hold your fists firmly. Visualize the five-colored essence and light of the moon entering your mouth. Within the moon, there is also a yellow qi, as large as the pupil of an eye, called the *flying blossom jade embryo’s essence*. Those who cultivate this Way become immortals who hasten to the sun and moon.

For the practice of *Yu Yi’s Hastening to the Sun*, one should daily await the moment of sunrise. If the sun is not visible, remain in a quiet chamber, face east, click your teeth nine times, close your eyes, and hold your breath for nine cycles. Then swallow the sun’s radiant light nine times, visualizing the light and radiance entering your mouth before ingesting it. Afterward, softly invoke:

*Within the Sun, the Azure Emperor, whose taboo name is Yuan Chang Yuan and style name is Zhao Long Tao, wears a cyan jade brocade mantle, a skirt of azure blossoms and flying feathers, and a morning crown of emerald lotus.*

*Within the Sun, the Vermilion Emperor, whose taboo name is Dan Ling Zhi and style name is Lü Hong Ying, wears a crimson jade brocade mantle, a skirt of vermilion blossoms and flying feathers, and a luminous crown of red lotus.*

*Within the Sun, the White Emperor, whose taboo name is Hao Yu Jiang and style name is Hui Jin Xia, wears a white jade brocade mantle, a skirt of white feathers and flying blossoms, and a crown of luminous white lotus.*

*Within the Sun, the Black Emperor, whose taboo name is Cheng Qin Ting and style name is Xuan Lü Yan, wears a black jade brocade mantle, a skirt of black feathers and flying blossoms, and a crown of dark mountain lotus.*

*Within the Sun, the Yellow Emperor, whose taboo name is Shou Yi Fu and style name is Biao Hui Xiang, wears a yellow jade brocade mantle, a skirt of yellow feathers and flying blossoms, and a purple crown of yellow lotus.*

The spirit within the moon’s essence is named *Warm and Serene Terrace’s Standard*.

Repeat this invocation three times, then close your eyes and hold your fists firmly. Visualize the five-colored streaming radiance within the sun approaching your body, descending to your feet, then ascending to the crown of your head. Next, visualize the five-colored qi of the sunlight and radiance entering your mouth. Within the flowing radiance of the sunlight, there is also a purple qi, as large as the pupil of an eye, layered in dozens, resplendent within the five-colored light. This is called the *flying root water mother*. Together with the five qi, it enters your mouth. Face the sun and swallow the radiance forty-five times. Afterward, click your teeth nine times and softly invoke:

*Red furnace’s cinnabar qi, celestial orb’s flying essence, hardness receives softness, flame and water’s yin flower. Sun’s primal radiance, named Great Brightness, nine yangs harmonize as one, twin mists arise together. Congeal the soul and harmonize the po, essence of the five qi. Within, the Five Emperors are born, riding the light to command form. Gather the flying in emptiness, sip the root to fullness. Head draped in dragon blossoms, mantle of vermilion, sash of azure. Bridle the crow’s flowing mystery, radiance reflects the Upper Clarity. Bestowed with jade tablets, name inscribed in the Golden Pavilion. Feast on morning radiance, unite with the Dao in numinosity. Ascend as an immortal to the Grand Tenuity, soaring to the Purple Court.*

After the invocation, visualize the Azure Emperor descending from the sunlight to your left, the Vermilion Emperor to your right, the White Emperor to your back, the Black Emperor above your left hand, and the Yellow Emperor above your right hand. All Five Emperors arrive—visualize their attire in vivid detail. Then click your teeth five times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly invoke:

*Red furnace’s cinnabar radiance, orb of ninefold brilliance, great radiance dawns, resplendent vermilion essence. Five Emperors initiate the dawn, illuminating the myriad beings of the cavernous void. Behold the descent of the Upper Perfected, vast and boundless. Circulate qi and refine the gathered, flowing through the five forms. Transform my spirit, infuse the six viscera with numinosity. Together with the Emperor Lords, unite with the Supreme One’s peerless essence. Mount the crimson clouds, ninefold sun-chariot of yang’s mirror. Ascend to the sun’s midst, merge with the Emperor in numinosity. Lifespan equals heaven and earth, twin dawns converge.*

Afterward, click your teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and softly invoke:

*Moon’s spirit and essence, Warm and Serene Terrace’s Standard, enable me to reach the sun’s cavern-heaven. On the eastern peak of Chang Qiu, receive the scripture of wielding spirits, bear the talisman of the nine provinces, feast on azure essence’s nectar, drink cloud-jade’s richness. Feast in the realm of the eight poles, ascend the terrace of luminous perfection, sit in the Hall of Sparse Forests, chant the verses of jade dawn.*

After the invocation, visualize the crimson cloud chariot of the *yang mirror*, drawn by nine red dragons, arriving before you from the sunlight. Then visualize the Five Emperors riding together toward the sun. Forget your form for a long while, swallow saliva fourteen times, then close your eyes and focus your thoughts until a semblance appears. Bow twice toward the sun. Those who practice this Way for a long time will surely attain the ability to ride the radiance and hasten to the sun. This concludes the *Yu Yi’s Way*.

If a Daoist abstains from grains in the mountains, maintains perpetual fasting on the Five Peaks, severs ties with the mundane world, and deeply contemplates purity and perfection, they may daily ingest the sun’s root-radiance and swallow the essence of the Great Yang. Soon, their body will emanate jade-like luster, and their face will glow with flowing light.

Should worldly affairs entangle you, preventing stillness of form, or should you wander the paths of the mundane with your heart ensnared in webs of distraction, then perform this practice on the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month—ten times within a single month—following the method described above. These are the days when the sun’s soul descends to meet the earth, when the flying root is full, and when the water mother and her dream-hosts gather.

After eighteen years of such practice, the Supreme Clarity will refine you with golden perfection, polish you with jade radiance, and elevate you to the rank of True Sovereign. You will soar through the great void, riding the threefold splendor of the celestial blossoms, illuminating all beneath heaven.

**The Supreme’s Sun-Qi Opening Brightness Talisman**
On the final night of the lunar month at midnight, write this talisman in cinnabar on blue-green paper, face east, and ingest it to first announce yourself to the sun’s soul. When taking the talisman, hold your breath, grasp it in your left hand, and recite the incantation in your heart:

*"The Vermilion Script of the Great Subtlety,
Named Opening Brightness,
Summons the sun’s upper soul
To transform this form.
At dawn’s first light, arrayed in solemnity,
Departing from the round courtyard,
Flying blossoms and water mother,
Sun-root and golden essence,
Purple radiance streaming,
Called the Fivefold Numinous."*

Once the incantation is complete, ingest the talisman.

**The Lunar Palace**
On the full moon, visualize yourself as Kunlun Mountain, seated at its summit with the great sea below. As the moon’s wheel first rises, swallow saliva three times, and knock your teeth together thrice. Recite the incantation:

*"True radiance first arises,
Supreme Yang within Yin,
Waters surge in the dark wheel,
Golden dew glimmers faintly,
The source of fluids flows freely,
Illuminating the jade chamber,
Qi swells with luminous might,
Feasting upon the soaring flight."*

After reciting, swallow saliva nine times. Next, visualize the moonlight as a half-crescent, its golden radiance shining upon your body, and recite:

*"Radiance scatters from the celestial pool,
Golden waters in half-arc,
Light brightens the hidden night,
Illumining my dark pearl,
Drinking the crystalline nectar,
Fragrance permeates the numinous frame,
After cycles of true convergence,
Riding the radiance in soaring flight."*

Once the incantation is complete, swallow saliva nine times and knock your teeth. Visualize the moon as full, true water forming a bridge descending to the mountain’s stones. Your body, riding a multicolored phoenix, enters the moon. Recite:

*"The celestial source flows in cycles,
Light pierces the layered towers,
Dawn’s glow suffuses the ten directions,
Five fluids stir the hidden depths,
Soaring through emptiness, seizing the radiance,
The true body takes flight,
A single perfection ascends in audience,
The Yang cycle knows no sorrow."*

After reciting, swallow saliva nine times. Envision entering the lunar palace, merging with your body, and after a long while, forget your form. Feel the golden light scattering in all directions, illuminating the entire sky.

Practicing this for one year banishes illness, and spirits come and go at your command. After two years, you commune with the true, and the Three Realms attend you. After three years, the demon kings will vouch for you.

After nine years of practice, the achievement is complete, and the Five Ladies descend to summon your form, whereupon you attain the rank of flying immortal.

**The Jade Dawn’s Jeweled Radiance Rushing to the Moon and the Yellow Effulgence Jade Scripture**

The *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text* states: The method of gathering and ingesting yin blossoms, of swallowing the moon’s essence, was once transmitted by the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. It is also called *The Yellow Qi Yang Essence Concealed in Heaven and Hidden in the Moon Scripture*.

To practice the Way of Jeweled Radiance Rushing to the Moon, one should await the moment of the moon’s first rising. If there is no moon, proceed in a quiet chamber, facing west toward the moon. Knock the teeth ten times, close the eyes, hold the breath for nine cycles, and then swallow the moonlight nine times. Envision the moonlight entering your mouth, and then swallow it.

Once done, softly intone:
*"The Azure Emperor’s Lady of the Moon, whose taboo name is Zhu Yine, and whose style is Fenyan Ying, wears a robe of azure-flowered jade brocade with a cape of kingfisher-green, and a flying-feather skirt embroidered with dragon and phoenix patterns.
The Vermilion Emperor’s Lady of the Moon, whose taboo name is Yi Yiliao, and whose style is Wanyan Xu, wears a robe of cinnabar-bud jade brocade with a cape of vermilion, and a flying-feather skirt of fallen phoenix plumes.
The White Emperor’s Lady of the Moon, whose taboo name is Ling Sulan, and whose style is Yulian Hua, wears a robe of white nephrite brocade with four-dragon motifs and a cape of white silk, and a flying-feather skirt adorned with white luan-bird patterns.
The Black Emperor’s Lady of the Moon, whose taboo name is Jie Lianqiao, and whose style is Chun Shujin, wears a robe of dark jadeite brocade with nine-cloud motifs and a cape of black silk, and a flying-feather skirt embroidered with black dragon patterns.
The Yellow Emperor’s Lady of the Moon, whose taboo name is Qing Yingjin, and whose style is Jiong Dingrong, wears a robe of yellow cloud-mountain brocade with a cape of yellow silk, and a flying-feather skirt of green phoenix embroidery."*

Each of the Ladies wears her hair in a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon, with the rest flowing down to her waist. Within the sun dwell the five-colored soul-essences of the inner spirits, named Zhu Jing Chi Tong.

Recite the invocation three times, then close the eyes and clench the fists. Envision the five-colored flowing essences from the moon descending to embrace your entire body, down to your feet. Envision the five qi ascending to the crown of your head. Then, the five-colored flowing essences of the moonlight all enter your mouth. Within the flowing essence of the moonlight, there is also a yellow qi, large as the pupil of an eye, layered in dozens, following within the five-colored radiance of the moon’s essence. This is called the flying yellow moon-blossom essence. Together with the five qi, it enters your mouth. Facing the moon, swallow the essence fifty times. Once done, swallow saliva ten times. Then knock the teeth ten times again and softly intone:

*"Yellow essence, mysterious splendor,
Primal yin’s ascending qi,
Dispersing pent-up cold gales,
Ordering numinous powers to gather the stomach,
Empty waves and rippling tassels,
Wandering through pure vessels,
Moon’s essence, night’s radiance,
Exalted in the Dark Palace,
Five Ladies, each safeguarding their mother’s standing,
In the ten thousand directions,
Harmonizing the hun and restraining the po,
The five wombs flowing freely,
Riding the clouds to fly the essence,
Soaring in emptiness to the east,
Crowning the head with numinous clouds,
Radiant blossoms summoning the wind,
Left girded with the dragon tally,
Right bearing the tiger insignia,
Phoenix-feathered vermilion cape,
Jade pendants and golden earrings,
The soaring tree binding the slopes,
Named the Wood King,
The divine toad controlling the roots,
Now waning, now waxing,
Bright essence inwardly reflecting,
Dark waters spouting beams,
Granting the jade tablet of scripture,
Inscribing the name in the cloud chamber,
Ingesting the moon’s blossoms,
Merging with the true,
Flying immortal of the Purple Tenuity,
Ascending in audience to the Grand August One."*

Once the invocation is complete, envision the Azure Emperor’s Lady descending from the moonlight to stand at your left, and the Vermilion Emperor’s Lady descending from the moonlight to stand at your right.

Envision the White Emperor’s Lady descending from the moonlight to stand at your back; envision the Black Emperor’s Lady descending from the moonlight to stand upon your left hand; envision the Yellow Emperor’s Lady descending from the moonlight to stand upon your right hand. When all Five Emperor’s Ladies have arrived, visualize their attire in vivid detail. Then knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly intone:

"Yellow essence unfurls its radiance,
Primal yin reveals its inner splendor,
Illumining the vision of the Great Mystery,
Opening the caverns of the ten thousand directions,
Dispersing the misty chill winds,
Seven dawns suspending their jade,
The Three Convergences of yin revolve,
Heaven and Earth exhale their light,
Purple luminaries roam and descend,
Floating blossoms fill the nine voids,
Perfect clarity bestows its hues,
The six qi transform and interflow,
The Five Emperor’s Ladies,
Grasping clouds and seizing winds,
Divine capes of dense gauze,
Adorned with jade pendants and golden earrings,
Feathered skirts brushing the clouds,
Wafting mists fanning the east,
The soaring tree unfurling the dawn,
Its branches lush as the sacred fern,
Cloud toads refining and polishing,
Nurturing the Wood King,
Penetrating roots for ten thousand miles,
Shading and sheltering the five bodies,
Hun and po harmonized and transformed,
The six mysteries brimming with numinous power,
Returning from old age to infancy,
Jade-like radiance reverting to youth,
The Perfected Lords merging in transformation,
Together in the luminous peach of well-being,
Timely riding the Flowing Chime,
Ten dragons drawing the cloud chariot,
Ascending to the bright moon,
Attaining the rank of Preserving August One,
Lifespan uniting with the two images,
Heaven and Earth enduring without end."

When the incantation is complete, knock the teeth seven times, swallow saliva seven times, and softly intone:

"Spirit of the sun’s essence,
Named the Crimson Lad of Radiant Pearl,
Guide me westward to
The Gate of the Six Peaks,
Entering the Jade Palace of Harmonious Dawn,
The White Mound of Eight Strings,
The Upper Chamber of Eight Sceneries,
To receive the talisman of Ten Brightnesses,
To wear the insignia of the Night-Shining Flowing Star,
To sit in the Palace of Great Harmony,
To ascend the Terrace of Seven Numinosities,
To drink the moon’s blossoms and cloud cream,
To feast on the amber of yellow jade and the nectar of purple springs,
To chant the Lofty Numinous Stanzas,
To recite the True Verses of the Jade Dawn."

When the incantation is complete, envision to your right the Flowing Chime Cloud Chariot, drawn by ten yellow dragons, arriving from the moonlight before you. Then envision yourself riding together with the Five Ladies, hastening toward the moon.

Returning to your own form, after a long while, swallow saliva thirty times, then open your eyes and concentrate intently, visualizing until a semblance appears, and bow twice toward the moon. Those who practice this Way for a long time will surely attain the ability to ride the luminous chariot and hasten to the moon—thus concludes the Way of the Jade Dawn’s *Jie Lin*.

**Essential Instructions for Practice:**
As with absorbing moonlight, if practiced nightly, one will swiftly perceive the body emanating light, the eyes possessing flying essence. The essential method is to perform this on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 22nd, 24th, and 26th days of the month—eleven times in a lunar cycle—sufficient to attain immortality. On these evenings, yin essence takes flight and converges, the Three Qi overflow, the moon’s waters crystallize into blossoms, and the Yellow Spirit descends to receive them.

After eighteen years of practice, the Upper Clarity will refine the hun and transmute the substance, suffusing it with jade-like radiance, riding the dark reins of luminous chariots to traverse the Great Void.

**Purple Tenuity’s Talisman for Absorbing the Moon’s Essence and the Great Mystery’s Yin-Generating Sign**
On the last night of the lunar month at midnight, inscribe in yellow upon blue paper, face east to ingest it, first announcing it to the moon’s essence. At this time, one should first ingest the Talisman of Opening Numinosity.

When about to ingest the moon talisman, hold the breath, grasp the talisman in the right hand, and silently recite:
"Purple Tenuity’s yellow script,
Named the Great Mystery,
Summons the moon’s blossom waters,
Nurtures the po and harmonizes the hun,
Within the square, solemn affairs commence,
Issuing from the Mysterious Pass,
Concealing heaven and veiling the moon,
The Five Numinous Ladies,
Nine paths of flying light,
Illumine the Mud Pill Palace."

When the incantation is complete, ingest the talisman.

It is also said: One who knows the name of the moon’s po will be free from calamity for life, and no harm will befall them. The Most High concealed the names and titles of the Sun and Moon Emperor’s Ladies within the Palace of Primordial Simplicity—those who know them become divine immortals.

It is further said: One who knows the name of the sun’s essence will be free from illness for life, and no misfortune will touch them. The Most High concealed the names of the sun and moon’s essences within the Palace of Purple Emptiness and Jade—those who know them command spirits and employ numina.

For those practicing the Way of Hastening to the Sun and Moon, proceed as convenient; it need not be performed in full. Seek a secluded chamber, ensuring only the first glimmer of the sun or moon is visible. If one does not sever worldly affairs and remains entangled with external matters, this Way cannot be practiced.

Nightly, burn incense and visualize the names of the Five Emperors and Five Ladies, silently reciting: "May I unite with the Perfected Lords and the Great One, merging our luminous forms as one." After twenty-four years of such practice, one may also ascend to heaven in broad daylight, without necessarily performing the hastening visualization. Constantly visualize them at your left and right, silently reciting the incantation—an ancient teaching not to be heard by the ears.

For those who have already attained the immortal Way and refined their essence through meditation, two years of visualization will yield semblances, three years will manifest forms, and in five years, one may hasten to the sun and moon. For those who are not yet immortals but seek to refine their essence, progress will not be swift. With prolonged practice, one will ascend to the Two Luminaries, becoming an Upper Clarity Perfected—once every seven hundred years, this is transmitted to a single person.
