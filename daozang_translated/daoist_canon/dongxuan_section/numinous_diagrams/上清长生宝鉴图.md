**The Upper Clarity Precious Mirror of Long Life Diagram**

**Inscription on the Mirror:**
A hundredfold-refined divine metal,
Nine inches in perfect roundness.
Flanked by birds and beasts with wings,
The Seven Luminaries bestow numinosity.
Its mirror encompasses Heaven and Earth,
Its might subdues demonic spirits.
Adorning the immortals of sacred mountains,
Its wheel ascends to the Upper Clarity.
