**Title:** *Qīng Xuán Jiùkǔ Bǎo Chàn* (The Precious Repentance of the Verdant Dao for Deliverance from Suffering)

**One scroll.** Source text: *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòng Xuán* (Cavernous Mysteries) section, *Wēiyí* (Ceremonial Rituals) category.

**Opening Invocation and Homage:**

With utmost reverence, the devotees of all ritual stations, [here named] **Certain**, humbly burn incense and sincerely petition:

**The Most High, Peerless Dao/Way Treasure—** the Three Sovereigns of Supreme Authenticity,
**The Most High, Peerless Sutra Treasure—** the Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures,
**The Most High, Peerless Teacher Treasure—** the Venerable Great Master of Verdant Middle, the Yellow Talisman Sovereign of the Dao, who responds to the call of the *Tāiyī Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn* (Supreme Unity Deliverance-from-Suffering Celestial Sovereign),
The **Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Deliverer from Suffering**,
The **Great Compassionate, Great Merciful, Great Benevolent Deliverer**,
And the **Divine Assembly of Attendants**—boundless in number—within the **Eastern Extremity Palace**, the **Long-lasting Verdant Realm**, and the **Left and Right Guardians of the Boundless True Immortals**.

All rely upon the **true incense**, universally offering reverent devotion.

**Reflective Prayers:**

We humbly submit: In the **Verdant Realm of Long-lasting Bliss**, there is originally the **Celestial Sovereign of No Sound, No Form**;
Within the **Eastern Extremity Palace of Marvelous Austerity**, there exists the **Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Parent**.

**All-pervasive across the Ten Directions**, he delivers beings from suffering;
**Enduring through countless kalpas**, he guides all to liberation.

He **broadly opens the gate of repentance**, and **greatly unveils the path of ascent**;
The **dark and bright alike** depend upon him, and **all beings—sage and mundane—take refuge**.

If one earnestly invokes with **sincere supplication**, he **responds to the call without fail**.

Now, the **ascetic host** seeks to **commemorate the deceased**, establishing **fasting rites and devotional practices**.
With **ninefold reverent obeisance**, we aspire to **glimpse his dust**;
With **elevenfold sincere devotion**, we **confess our faults** and seek absolution.

We **humbly pray** that the **Most Benevolent** will **hear our plea**:
**Erase the black records** of the Right Bureau, and **forever extinguish all calamitous omens**;
**Grant the green tablets** of Eastern Verdance, and **swiftly fulfill our transcendence**.

With **profound homage**, we take refuge in the **Boundless Dao**.
All present **bow with utmost reverence**, offering **sincere rites of refuge**.

In the **Jade Purity Sacred Realm**, the **Pure and Exalted Celestial Palace**,
Amidst the **Yùluó Xiāotái** (Jade Lattice Tower of Serenity), above the **Sēnluó Jìnghuāng** (Forest of Pure and Bright),
He **manifests the sacred form** of the **Dharma-body**,
Possessing the **divine penetration** of the **Boundless Dao**.

He **expounds the true mysteries of the Dao**, dispelling the **obstacles of formless emptiness**;
He **rescues all sentient beings**, severing the **divisions of high and low in wisdom and folly**.

His **marvelous methods** are **difficult to fathom**, his **spiritual mechanisms** **inexplicable**.
With **great compassion and boundless vows**, with **great holiness and boundless mercy**, the **Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Liberation**.

We **bow with utmost reverence**, offering **sincere rites of refuge**.

In the **Upper Purity Sacred Realm**, the **Yǔyú Tiān Gōng** (Palace of the Celestial Sovereign of the Flood),
Amidst the **Zǐwēi Qióngtái** (Purple Micro Tower of Splendor), above the **Xuándū Yùjīng** (Abyssal Capital of Jade),
He **inherits the lineage** of the **Primordial Sovereign of the Void**,
And **transcends the roots** of the **Western *Xīnà* Realm of Jade**.

He **consumes grains and pearls**, exhaustively drawing the **essence of the true mysteries**;
Within the **Fragrant Arbor Grove**, he **repeatedly discourses** on the **hidden secrets of the Dao**.

His **marvelous virtue** is **beyond thought**, his **divine penetration** **immeasurable**.
With **great compassion and boundless vows**, with **great holiness and boundless mercy**, the **Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Liberation, the Sacred Treasure**.

We **bow with utmost reverence**, offering **sincere rites of refuge**.

In the **Supreme Purity Immortal Realm**, the **Tàichì Tiān Gōng** (Palace of the Great Red Celestial Sovereign),
Lofty and **golden gates** stand **high above**,
Vast and **heavenly layers** stretch **far beyond**.

He **manifests in countless kalpas**, preaching the **Law in twelve thousand heavens**.
**Five thousand sacred teachings** merge the **marvelous Dao of the Three Realms**;
**Eighty-plus liberations** embrace the **six paths of sentient beings**.

His **holy virtue** is **exalted**, his **mysterious power** **vast**.
With **great compassion and boundless vows**, with **great holiness and boundless mercy**, the **Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Liberation, the Sovereign of Virtue and Power**.

We **bow with utmost reverence**, offering **sincere rites of refuge**.

In the **Verdant Jade Sacred Realm**, the **Eastern Extremity Supreme Palace**,
His **Ten-Directional transformations** liberate all beings;
A **hundred billion auspicious lights** illuminate his **marvelous form**.

He **responds to each call**, guided by **vows of boundless depth**.
The **nine-colored lotus** becomes the **compassionate vessel** of the **other shore**;
A **single branch of willow** opens the **gate of sweet nectar**.

The **Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Liberation**, the **Great Compassionate and Benevolent One**,
With **great compassion and boundless vows**, with **great holiness and boundless mercy**, the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.

We, the **devotees**, **bow with utmost reverence**, offering **rites of refuge to his Compassionate Form**—
Refuge in **body**, refuge in **spirit**, refuge in **command**—
And **surrender sincerely** to the **Supreme Sage**.

**Again, we ponder** the **deceased soul of Certain**, from **birth to decline and ruin**,
Accumulating **disloyalty and transgressions**, yet **unable to confess fully**.

Some **defy parents** and **deceive the natural order**, their **guilt being the greatest**;
Some **offend elder kin** and **abandon filial duties**, this **is the ultimate transgression**.

They **lose respect for hierarchy**, **forget obligations to kin**;
Though **wealthy and honored**, they **betray their teachers’ trust**.

Their **rites of respect and propriety** are **deficient**, their **clothing and nourishment** **unprovided**.
Such **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.

Now, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.
We **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**, delivering our **deceased soul**.

In **hell**, there shall be **no cries of suffering**, the **winds and thunders** **cease their wrath**;
In **heaven**, he **enjoys great blessings**, ascending to the **highest celestial realms**.

All **devotees take refuge**, offering **sincere homage**.

**Sincere homage** to the **True Form of the Marvelous Dao—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.
**Sincere homage** to the **Purple-Gold Auspicious Form—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.
**Sincere homage** to the **Sovereign who Delivers by Following the Call—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.
**Sincere homage** to the **Sovereign of Boundless Vows—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.
**Sincere homage** to the **Great Sage, Great Compassionate One—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.
**Sincere homage** to the **Great Merciful, Great Vowed One—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.
**Sincere homage** to the **Ten-Directional Transformer—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.
**Sincere homage** to the **Universal Liberator of All Beings—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.
**Sincere homage** to the **Sovereign who Delivers by Following the Call—** the **Supreme Unity Sovereign who Delivers by Responding to the Call**.

We, the **devotees**, **bow with utmost reverence**, offering **rites of refuge to his Compassionate Form**—
Refuge in **body**, refuge in **spirit**, refuge in **command**—
And **surrender sincerely** to the **Supreme Sage**.

**Again, we ponder** the **deceased soul of Certain**, from **birth to decline and ruin**,
Accumulating **disloyalty and transgressions**, yet **unable to confess fully**.

Some **hold great office** yet **do not repay with gratitude**, their **duties being most arduous**;
Some **dwell in lowly service** yet **do not exert effort**, their **pursuit being mere deception**.

In **times of hardship**, they **cannot die for loyalty**;
In **moments of victory or defeat**, they **always harbor two hearts**.

They **seal their lips and stammer** to **avoid suspicion**,
And **deceive with false sincerity** to **gain renown**.

Such **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.

Now, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.
We **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**, delivering our **deceased soul**.

Hell’s torments know no sound of suffering,
Yet spared are the **searing burns of the bronze pillar** upon the body;

The celestial realm enjoys boundless bliss,
Ascending the **jade terrace**, strolling freely in ** Daoist transcendence**.

The **dharma assembly** takes refuge with **devout hearts**,
And **prostrates in homage** with utmost sincerity.

With **devout hearts** and **prostrates in homage**,
We pay reverence to the **Supreme One, the Saviour of Suffering, the True Form of the Marvelous Dao**.

With **devout hearts** and **prostrates in homage**,
We pay reverence to the **Supreme One, the Saviour of Suffering, the Auspicious Manifestation of Purple Gold**.

We, the **devout assembly**, with **devout hearts**,
Take refuge in **body, spirit, and life** before the **Compassionate One**,
And **surrender sincerely** to the **Supreme Sage**.

We **solemnly recall** the **deceased soul** who **transgressed in mortal life**,
From **birth to ruin**, **accumulating sins of murder and harm**,
Yet **never confessed fully** in repentance.

Some **witness death yet fail to stir compassion and rescue**,
As though they had **slain the victim themselves**.
Some **deliberately scheme to murder others**,
Not in accordance with **heavenly fate**.

They **forsake forgiveness and grudges**,
And **yield to their own desires**.
They **accept bribes and perjury**,
And **enter into falsehoods** with ease.

They **drown, strangle, or suffocate** others in their schemes,
And **endure with cold-hearted cruelty**.
They **consume flesh and sleep upon skins**,
Yet **feel no remorse**.

Such **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.
Now, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.
We **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**,
Delivering our **deceased soul**.

Hell’s torments know no sound of suffering,
Yet spared are the **agonizing pains of slaughter**;

The celestial realm enjoys boundless bliss,
And **delights in leisurely feasts of transcendence**.

With **prostrations and refuge-taking**,
We **pay homage with devout hearts**.

With **devout hearts** and **prostrates in homage**,
We pay reverence to the **Supreme One, the Saviour of Suffering, the True Form of the Marvelous Dao**.

We, the **devout assembly**, with **devout hearts**,
Take refuge in **body, spirit, and life** before the **Compassionate One**,
And **surrender sincerely** to the **Supreme Sage**.

We **solemnly recall** the **deceased soul** who **transgressed in mortal life**,
From **birth to ruin**, **accumulating sins of lust and desire**,
Yet **never confessed fully** in repentance.

Some **see beauty and recklessly indulge in licentious thoughts**,
Losing their **true nature**.
Some **violate kin and cannot rectify their conduct**,
And **trample upon moral precepts**.

They **sing lewd songs and obscene words**,
And **disturb the virtue of others**.
They **utter flattering and lascivious speech**,
And **provoke the passions of others**.

Their **recklessness leads to the ruin of nations and families**,
And their **licentiousness causes miscarriages and harms children**.

Such **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.
Now, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.
We **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**,
Delivering our **deceased soul**.

Hell’s torments know no sound of suffering,
Yet spared are the **lashings of iron rods and golden hammers**.

The celestial realm enjoys boundless bliss,
And **wanders freely in the gardens of Peng Hu and Lang Yuan**.

With **prostrations and refuge-taking**,
We **pay homage with devout hearts**.

With **devout hearts** and **prostrates in homage**,
We pay reverence to the **Supreme One, the Saviour of Suffering, the True Form of the Marvelous Dao**.

With **devout hearts** and **prostrates in homage**,
We pay reverence to the **Supreme One, the Saviour of Suffering, who Universally Delivers All Sentient Beings**.

With **devout hearts** and **prostrates in homage**,
We pay reverence to the **Supreme One, the Saviour of Suffering, who Seeks and Responds to Calls**.

We, the **devout assembly**, with **devout hearts**,
Take refuge in **body, spirit, and life** before the **Compassionate One**,
And **surrender sincerely** to the **Supreme Sage**.

We **solemnly recall** the **deceased soul** who **transgressed in mortal life**,
From **birth to ruin**, **accumulating sins of theft and plunder**,
Yet **never confessed fully** in repentance.

Some **see profit yet cannot push aside righteousness**,
And **conceive theft in their hearts**.
Some **deceive the public and indulge in wrongdoing**,
Thus **revealing their corrupt deeds**.

They **openly rely on strength to rob and seize**,
Or **secretly plot to encroach and usurp**.

They **deceive others with hidden schemes**,
Yet **feel deep shame within their own hearts**.

Such **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.
Now, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.
We **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**,
Delivering our **deceased soul**.

**Anger and resentment, sins unconfessed,**
From **birth to ruin**, **their transgressions never fully atoned**.

Some **without cause display wrath and menace**,
Disturbing others with **unjustified fury**.
Some **seize any pretext to indulge in rage and cruelty**,
Thus **inviting retribution from Heaven**.

To **defy with words** is to **offend the sovereign’s dignity**,
And **harsh speech** may **fester resentment in others**.
Shouting, cursing, and **malicious reviling**—**lacking compassion**—
Or **brutal beating and torture**—**excessive cruelty**.

Such **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.
Now, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.
We **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**,
Delivering our **deceased soul**.

In **hell’s endless torment**, let the **flaming chariots cease**,
In **heaven’s boundless bliss**, let them **ride the clouded paths in ease**.
With **profound reverence**, we **take refuge** and **bow in homage**.
We **earnestly pray** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering**,
The **True Form of the Wondrous Dao**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering with Auspicious Purple-Golden Manifestation**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Attends to All Sentient Beings**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering with Boundless Vows and Devotion**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering, Greatly Holy and Compassionate**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering, Greatly Merciful and Vowed**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering with Ten-Directional Transcendent Names**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Universally Liberates All Beings**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Seeks the Voice and Responds to Aspirations**.

We, the **lowly multitude**, with **sincere hearts**, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life** in the **Merciful Sovereign**,
And **surrender in truth** to the **Supreme Saint**.
We **recollect with grief** the **departed soul** of [name],
From **conception to its fall into ruin**,
**Accumulating sins of deceit and falsehood**, **never fully confessed**.

Some **flatter with cunning words** before **lords and parents**,
**Harming principle and propriety**—**most unfit**.
Some **concoct secret plots** to **betray the virtuous and innocent**,
**Deceiving even their own hearts**—**their guilt is profound**.

In **friendship’s exchange**, they **lack sincerity**,
And **invoke the gods in oaths**—**yet their words are hollow**.
They **adorn speech and feign conduct**, **making trust impossible**,
**Smiling to faces yet contradicting in truth**—**truly despicable**.

Such **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.
Now, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.
We **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**,
Delivering our **deceased soul**.

In **hell’s endless torment**, let the **cold ice’s agony be released**,
In **heaven’s boundless bliss**, let them **behold the radiant light of grace**.
With **profound reverence**, we **take refuge** and **bow in homage**.
We **earnestly pray** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering**,
The **True Form of the Wondrous Dao**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering with Auspicious Purple-Golden Manifestation**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Attends to All Sentient Beings**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering with Boundless Vows and Devotion**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering, Greatly Holy and Compassionate**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering, Greatly Merciful and Vowed**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering with Ten-Directional Transcendent Names**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Universally Liberates All Beings**,
The **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Seeks the Voice and Responds to Aspirations**.

We, the **lowly multitude**, with **sincere hearts**, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life** in the **Merciful Sovereign**,
And **surrender in truth** to the **Supreme Saint**.
We **recollect with grief** the **departed soul** of [name],
From **conception to its fall into ruin**,
**Accumulating sins of arrogance and pride**, **never fully confessed**.

Some **ride in carriages with haughty bearing**,
Still **clutching at injustice**—**their hearts remain unlevel**.
Some **regard earth and wood** with **contemptuous disregard**,
**Dismissing truth itself**—**they truly incur blame**.

We **despise** nobles and ministers, **treating them as common folk**;
We **see** kin and flesh, **yet act as if they were strangers**.
To **venerable sages and elders**, we **barely bow**—**one gesture is too much**;
To **vulgar fools and mediocre masses**, we **hold affection in our hearts**.

Such **sins and transgressions** are **boundless and endless**.
Now, **before the Dao**, we **devoutly confess** our errors.
**With reverence**, we pray for **manifestation of sacred decrees** to **deliver the departed soul**.

In **hell’s depths**, no **suffering cries**—**we escape** the **seething caldrons of boiling heat**;
In **heaven’s halls**, great **blessings abound**—**we drink** the **pure nectar’s cooling refreshment**.

**Prostrating with homage**, we **take refuge with sincere hearts**,
**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance**.

**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering, whose True Form is the Marvelous Dao**,
**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering, adorned with the Auspicious Purple-Golden Form**,
**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Attends to All Aspirations**,

We, the **lowly multitude**, **with sincere hearts**, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life** in the **Merciful Sovereign**,
And **surrender in truth** to the **Supreme Saint**.
We **recollect with grief** the **departed soul** of [name],
From **conception to its fall into ruin**,
**Accumulating sins of arrogance and pride**, **never fully confessed**.

Some **profess the Dao yet lack devotion and singularity**,
**They violate the sacred statutes**—**their own folly they invite**.
Some **seek the True** yet **hesitate in faith and doubt**,
**They court calamity and retribution**, **breaking oaths and betraying trust**,
**Yet blame others and resent the spirits**—**their guilt is profound**.
Some **break fasts and violate precepts**,
**They mock the Sage and deceive Heaven**.

They **speak well of others yet harbor malice within**,
**Their labors begin with zeal yet end in slackness**.
Such **sins and transgressions** are **boundless and endless**.
Now, **before the Dao**, we **devoutly confess** our errors.
**With reverence**, we pray for **manifestation of sacred decrees** to **deliver the departed soul**.

In **hell’s depths**, no **suffering cries**—**we renounce** the **sword-trees and mountain of knives**;
In **heaven’s halls**, great **blessings abound**—**we attend** the **Phoenix and Lotus Throne**.

**Prostrating with homage**, we **take refuge with sincere hearts**,
**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance**.

**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering, whose True Form is the Marvelous Dao**,
**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering, adorned with the Auspicious Purple-Golden Form**,
**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Attends to All Aspirations**,

**With reverence**, we **pay obeisance** to the **Too-One Saviour of Suffering who Seeks the Voice and Responds to Aspirations**.

**Three invocations, three obeisances**.
**We humbly submit**, for **the heart’s deepest truth** is **a cry to Heaven**,
And **compassion for all life**, **the natural essence of our Dao**.

**Only through utmost sincerity** will we **surely receive divine grace**.
Now, **our sacred scriptures and treasured texts** are **fully revealed and proclaimed**,
And **our pure and earnest devotion** has **harmonized with the responsive qi**.
**We rejoice** in **life and death’s blessings**, **forgiving the hidden and the manifest** with **stained grace**.

**Humbly we pray** that **the Benevolent Vision** may **save and relieve suffering**,
**Ever manifesting its sacred might** to **ascend the souls from hell’s abyss**.
**Prostrating with homage**, we **take refuge and extol virtues**.

**Reciting the sutras, making merit transfers**:
The **Green Heavenly Treasure of the Saviour of Suffering** **rites the Confession of Errors complete**.
