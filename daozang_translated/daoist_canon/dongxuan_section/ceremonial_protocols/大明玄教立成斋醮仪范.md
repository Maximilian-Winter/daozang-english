**Imperial Preface to the Ritual Texts for Daoist Offerings and Services of the Mysterious Teaching**

We observe that the teachings of the Buddhists and Daoists each have two branches. Among the Buddhists, there are the Chan and the *jiao* (doctrinal schools). Among the Daoists, there are the Orthodox Unity and the Complete Perfection. Chan and Complete Perfection devote themselves to cultivating the body and nurturing nature, solely for their own sake. The *jiao* and Orthodox Unity, however, focus on transcending the mundane, specifically established for filial sons and compassionate parents. They benefit human relations and enrich customs—how great is their merit!

Though the teachings of Confucius and the laws of the state are clear, rigorously honoring the virtuous and punishing the unworthy, there are still those who refuse to heed them. Even among those who do, how many act in accordance with principle? The two traditions of Buddhism and Daoism, however, are entirely free from the constraints of correcting faults or rectifying errors, yet the number of people who follow them without distinction is vast.

In the households of officials and commoners, when there is a funeral, without Buddhist monks or Daoist priests, it is difficult to conduct the rites of interment. If these two traditions are not employed for the funeral, then parents are deemed uncompassionate toward their children, and children are deemed unfilial toward their parents—bringing shame before neighbors and kin. This is why Confucius said: *"In the West there is a Great Sage who governs without teaching"*—this is precisely what he meant.

Yet today, those who instruct monks and Daoists act without principle, wantonly establishing rituals and ceremonies that neither accord with reason nor align with human sentiment.

The ignorant and unknowing populace blindly follows these ritual forms, engaging in three, five, or seven days and nights of chanting scriptures. These scriptures, which teach people to do good and refrain from evil in the Buddhist and Daoist traditions, are like the laws and decrees of the state. If chanting scriptures allows the spirits of the dead to hear them and thereby awaken their good intentions, this is acceptable. But if chanting scriptures is meant to absolve the dead of their sins—as if one could escape punishment for violating the law by reading the statutes—this is impossible. Such practices waste family resources, while the dull and foolish monks and Daoists take them as models of ritual perfection, exhausting their spirits in the process. Observing the rituals they perform, one finds errors in the texts and miswritten characters, which the learned then mock and deride. The reason for such ridicule is this: before the Buddha has been invited or the Three Pure Ones have arrived, they already face the wall to report the patron’s affairs. Monks may even proclaim these matters to the Buddha three times a day, while Daoists present their memorials thrice daily. From this, one might think Śākyamuni and Laozi are hard of hearing or blind, requiring such repeated address. If not for this, what possible reason could there be?

Let the Ministry of Rites convene with Buddhist and Daoist clergy to establish standardized formats for their ritual forms, which shall then be disseminated everywhere for their observance. This would prevent the waste of poor families’ resources and preserve the spiritual vitality of monks and Daoists—would this not be excellent?

*Preface to the* Ritual Forms for the Establishment of Daoist Offerings and Purifications *of the Great Ming, composed in the eleventh month of the seventh year of the Hongwu reign.*

When divine tortoises and dragon-horses presented their charts and writings in response to enlightened eras, and when the nine phoenixes and eight simurghs sang in secret harmony with wondrous forms—then did the radiance of precious pearls shine forth, and the exalted jade tablets ascend in splendor. The thirty-six divisions, texts of profound mystery, could be pored over endlessly without exhaustion; the five thousand and more words, the essence of the *Dao* and *virtue*, aligned perfectly with the transformations of governance. Yet as the meaning of the scriptures grew obscure and their truth was lost, ritual forms were transmitted and gradually proliferated. A hundred schools arose in separate lineages, and through the ages their excesses overflowed. Where chants and praises multiplied, simplicity and sincerity were no longer upheld; where rites stretched day and night, devotion inevitably waned. Examined against the standards of ritual and music, they often transgressed proper bounds; measured against Heaven, Earth, and the gods, they risked irreverence.

Fortunately, a sage now reigns above, and the immortal Dao may be renewed. By the grace of His Majesty the Emperor—pure, serene, subtle, and profound; lofty, luminous, vast, and deep—all under Heaven is pacified, and the tribute of distant lands flows in like rivers converging in the Yangtze and Han. His reverence in serving the Supreme Lord is manifest in the suburban sacrifices; his rites of conciliation toward the hundred spirits move them to respond. Thus does he gather blessings for the common people and turn his divine attention to the two teachings.

On the twenty-third day of the eleventh month in the seventh year of the Hongwu reign, your servants Song Zongzhen, Zhao Yunzhong, Fu Tongxu, Deng Zhongxiu, Zhou Xuanzhen, and others, reverently obeying the imperial decree, compiled and streamlined the rituals of the Daoist tradition, establishing fixed regulations to present for the throne’s approval.

We, your servants Zongzhen and others, are of humble nature and shallow learning, yet presuming to undertake this task with due reverence, have compiled these ritual forms and now humbly submit the draft for presentation. Should it pass the scrutiny of the celestial gaze and receive the sagely decision of His Majesty, its implementation among the unseen and manifest realms would bring benefit and advantage—truly a blessing for the Daoist tradition through ten thousand generations.

The following is the ordered sequence of rites, with the ritual texts appended thereafter:

**The Great Ming’s Established Ritual for Daoist Fast and Jiao of the Mysterious Teachings**
**Three-Day Ritual for Deliverance of the Deceased**

**First Day**
Dispatching the talisman of direct command, incantation of water for purification by sprinkling.

Within the cavern’s profound void, radiant shines the Great Nothingness.
The majestic spirits of the eight directions empower me to be as nature.
The talismanic command of the Numinous Treasure universally proclaims the Nine Heavens.
Qianluo Danna, the cavern’s mighty Pivot of the Great Mystery,
severs demons and binds evil, slaying ten thousand ghosts.
The Central Mountain’s divine incantation, the Jade Text of the Primordial Beginning—
once I recite it, ghosts retreat and years extend.
Marching across the Five Peaks, the Eight Seas hear and know.
The Demon Kings bow their heads, guarding my chariot.
Malevolence and filth disperse, the Dao’s qi ever abides.

**Summoning the Generals** – **Burning the Talisman** – **Threefold Presentation of the Text**

We humbly acknowledge that the Dao encompasses heaven and earth, fully recorded in the fast’s liturgy;
the resplendent texts of the Cloud Han align with the memorial’s draft.
In an instant of spiritual resonance, may the manifold rites be fittingly received.
Pouring the immortal brew to float its fragrance, the first offering is arrayed in order;
gazing toward the Dark Capital, riding the light, the Six Directions are not distant.
With wine in the pure vessel, we reverently present the initial offering.

We humbly acknowledge that what is above form is called the Dao, its subtlety beyond naming, its sageliness unknowable.
As spirits, reverence demands devout offering.
Having assumed the duty of conduct, we now transcribe the sincerity of our supplication.
May the gates of the true realm open wide, though immortals and mortals remain distinct;
mounting the wind-borne chariot to ascend and descend, above and below know no bounds.
With careful movement, we present the second offering.

We humbly acknowledge that the Dao governs heaven and earth, treasuring the ten thousand things, hence its reverence;
it moistens with wind and rain, rouses with thunder and lightning—there is nowhere the spirits do not dwell.
Resplendent as the revealed immortal liturgy, vast is the numinous transformation of the spirits.
We possess sealed documents; may the divine generals deign to peruse them.
We beseech transmission; may our earnest prayers be answered.
Offering our utmost sincerity, we conclude with the third offering.

**Reading the Dispatch** – **Dispatching the Generals** – **Burning Paper Money and Dedication** – **Raising the Pennant**

**Liturgical Text – Plain Prose**

We humbly acknowledge that the Great Unity, the Merciful Venerable One, broadly bestows boundless grace; the great thousandfold world all depends on his salvific benevolence. He scatters sweet dew to moisten and bedew, spreads auspicious clouds to shelter and embrace. Today, reverently following the mysterious title, we unfurl the resplendent pennant. Crimson characters trail radiance, universally illuminating the brightness of benighted thoroughfares; vast blessings absolve transgressions, widely extending the compassionate ferry of the Dharma sea. We bow our heads in reverence, take refuge, and extol with praise and chant.

**Mantra Pennant**
Eastern Florescence, wondrous and solemn, manifests myriad merciful forms. Dwelling in eternal joy, seated upon the golden lotus, wisdom-light shines unimpeded, illuminating the dark springs. Withered skeletons and decayed bones all attain luminous freshness. Sweet dew flows and moistens, pervading the empty mystery. Those sunk in the depths are delivered, no longer stagnant in the frigid abyss.

**Chanting the Gāthā**
Auspicious clouds weave this numinous pennant,
its shadow cast upon the floating void, dispersing through the world.
As soon as the ethereal wind stirs,
all sentient beings escape the dark barriers.

**Chanting the Sūtra – Dedication**

**Inviting the Altar Overseer**
We humbly acknowledge that within the Three Realms, each position is ordained by the true sovereign; within this region, merit necessarily relies upon the divine luminaries. Moreover, as this purification rite is solemnly conducted, we reverently invoke the protective guardianship of the altar overseer, all majestic spirits, their awe-inspiring presence manifest, their numinous power towering. They uphold the luminous mind of impartial integrity, wielding the handle of fortune and misfortune, good and ill. All spirits submit to their sway; every being takes refuge. Whatever sincerity is offered must meet with response. We humbly hope that cloud-banners gleam in the sunlight, wind-horses are harnessed to descend; that immortal retinues soar through the sky, dispelling malevolent vapors to ensure solemn stillness. May they bear witness to the purification rite, suppress disturbances in the sacred precinct, and as the Dharma assembly takes refuge, we earnestly invoke their presence.

**Inviting the Deities – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra – Inviting the Purification Overseer**

Thus, the Dao holds purification rites as foremost, requiring offerings of utmost purity; sincerity deems ritual as paramount, demanding meticulous preparation in culinary arts. To ensure the kitchen’s offerings remain solemn and pristine, we must rely on the awe-inspiring presence of the deities to oversee and govern. We humbly beseech the numinous ones to descend, wielding their silent authority to suppress disorder; may the Dharma’s essence be refined, free from the taint of discordant vapors. May the purification rite be accomplished, the sacrificial rites perfected, and as the Dharma assembly takes refuge, we earnestly invoke their presence.

**Inviting the Deities – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra – Arranging the Seats and Expounding the Sūtra**

It is said: The Primordial One Qi gave rise to all heavens. The illumination of the Three Luminaries is the root of the sky. Above, there is no ancestor—only the Dao is its body. Thus, those who comprehend the Dao are beyond conception. Neither existent as existence nor nonexistent as nonexistence, it manifests throughout the ten directions, nurturing the myriad beings. Like the moon embracing all waters, its reflection is perfectly complete; like clouds receding from the vast sky, the boundless void remains unimpeded. Eternally tranquil and serene, abstruse and profound, it saves the world without limit, liberates beings without measure.

Today, the filial devotee, in remembrance of the departed, knows that illusory forms perish while the true nature endures. Though all beings are fundamentally equal, not transcending the singular true essence, yet through eons of karmic defilement, how could they be free from the dust of the Three Poisons? Without the guidance of the Dharma’s teachings, how might they ascend to the celestial realms? Therefore, we expound the wondrous scriptures of the profound mystery, thereby illuminating the radiant wisdom of the *Lingbao*. As the pearl-like grains manifest, they summon the vibrant presence of immortals; where the jade celestial sphere pauses, one beholds the profound vastness of the great Dao. The Dharma assembly, reverent and devout, requests the scriptures in accordance with ritual.

**Requesting the Sūtra – Liturgical Rite – Chanting the Sūtra**
*The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for the Salvation of All – The Scripture of the Generation of the Spirit – The Scripture of Salvation from Suffering – The Scripture of Ascension to Heaven*

Before the spirit tablet, we recite the offering of consecrated food:
The chapter on the spontaneous generation of the spirit unfolds the great abundance of the numinous scripture. For all sentient beings, we proclaim the esoteric mantras. We reverently invite the departed spirits, their minds stilled in solemn reverence. Today, we offer this Dharma food; may they deign to partake.

For the spirit’s honor, we dedicate this to ascend the cloud-path, rebirth in the immortal realms. Reciting the *Lingbao* invocation of compassion and wisdom, we chant:
We bow to the Radiant Wisdom of the Void and Supreme, we bow to the Lord of the Profound Mystery. You fashion heaven and earth, yet none can describe Your merit; You are the refuge and support of all beings. With compassion, You turn the Five Paths of the wheel of rebirth; with mercy, You rescue those suffering in the Three Realms of hell. We take refuge in the Azure Mystery of the Eastern Summit, we take refuge in the Compassionate Father of the Six Paths. We take refuge in the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Lords, forever freed from birth and death, transcending existence and entering the void without reliance. You enable the withered and decayed to become immortals. Through countless eons, such an encounter is rare; for the multitudes, You broadly expound the causes of karma. You revive the dead, granting eternal abiding, ensuring their form and spirit remain unchanged. Dispelling the suffering of the long night, releasing torment in the Three Realms. The Flower Pool flows with true fragrance, its merit beyond conception. A single sprinkle of sweet dew, like heat finding coolness. The spirit ascends to the Great Canopy, its blessings extending to all.

For the spirit’s honor, we dedicate this to ascend the cloud-path, rebirth in the immortal realms. Reciting the mantras for purifying Fengdu, shattering hell, departing the cold courts, and ascending as immortals:
Vast and boundless is Fengdu, layered with mountains of vajra. The boundless light of the *Lingbao* illumines the scorching pools of suffering. The seven generations of ancestors and all lost souls, their bodies follow the fragrant cloud-banners. With the wisdom of samādhi and the blue lotus, they ascend to the eternal peace of the spirit. The golden light of merit gently opens the gates of darkness. The Flower Pool flows with true fragrance; the lotus canopy drifts upon the clouds. The immortals chant the mysterious scriptures, ever dwelling in the Twelve Towers. Hasten to uphold the *Lingbao* mantra, roam freely in the celestial paradise. The cold courts hold much sorrow; turning back, they pay homage to the subtle mystery. The talisman of the Azure Lady and the *Lingbao*, inscribed by the divine of Mount Zhong. With a single thought, ascend to the Great Clarity; silently recite, contemplating the Supreme Void. Merit accrues to the Nine Dark Realms below, gradually rebirthing in the Purple Void.

**Mantra for Nurturing the Spirit and Cultivating the Soul**
The spirit mushroom has no root, the source of all wonders. Within, it congeals the seven *po*, internally binds the three *hun*. The Twenty-Four Perfected Ones enter and exit without gate. In the abstruse and obscure, the primordial essence flickers. Through kalpas of existence and decay, it arises with the qi. Externally, it solidifies the primordial chaos; internally, it nourishes the Seven Perfected. The five spirits plant their blossoms; the Three Terraces unfold their glory. The Purple Chamber and the White Youth guide the soul back to infancy. Ascending upon clouds, drifting with the mist in the void. Within, the Jade Perfected, known as the Divine Elder. To the left, embracing the Peerless; to the right, guarded by the White Prime. The Dark Beast blocks the rear; the Vermilion Phoenix escorts the front. Above, the emerald canopy floats; below, the golden lotus supports. Fragrant clouds congeal in the sky; sweet dew flows without end. Inexhaustible in use, tracing its source without end.

**Mantra for Opening the Towered Chambers with the Qi of the Three Luminaries**
The vast essence generates the Dharma qi, misty and dense in the midst of heaven. The two luminaries together shine clear; the five planets intermingle and communicate. The Three Luminaries blaze with brilliance; the precious qi congeals in the Three Palaces. The immortal realm gathers the Nine Elders; swallowing and absorbing, the hundred bones flourish. The golden blossom illuminates the light and shadow; the body harmonizes with creation. Aligning with the Dao and the natural, through ten thousand kalpas, life is endless.

**Mantra for Empowering the Dharma Food**
Turning back, we gaze upon the Mystic Canopy, merging with the radiance to grasp the numinous splendor. Restraining the *hun* and controlling the seven *po*, contemplating and settling at the center. In movement and stillness, we pay homage to the Void; in rest and repose, we feast in the Mystic Chamber. Hungry, we dine on yellow and azure blossoms; thirsty, we drink the nectar of the jade grove. The spirit and essence ascend to the Great Canopy, uniting the body to refine the true light. Reflecting again upon the Supreme Void, ever roaming the emptiness. The profound interpenetrates beyond the bounds of waves; the true transformation knows no interval. Subtle and boundless, without end or beginning—those who practice shall know for themselves. In silence, we forget doctrines and teachings; responding to the moment, we reveal the subtle mystery. The descent of the Dao does not summon itself; it must first be bestowed. Converging without dual paths, following the heart’s intent, they unite or part.

**Mantra for Universally Offering the Dharma Food**
Fragrant smoke disperses to the ten directions; blossoms open in the lotus chambers. The kalpa grove’s precious fruits, the immortals’ sweet dew nectar. The natural offerings of the fragrant kitchen, the wondrous jade liquid beyond measure. We now universally offer, carefree in the halls of supreme blessing.

Devotedly cultivate the great Daoist methods,
With focused heart, one senses the Great Darkness.
Yellow blossoms descend with true qi,
The five viscera knit the embryonic infant.
Seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,
Countless souls soar to the Supreme Clarity.
Blessings and benefits pervade without exception—
This food is offered to all beings.

**Chanting Sutras | Transforming Wealth | Dedication**
At the Cold Grove site:

**Reciting the Verse**
Talismanic commands traverse the vast and obscure,
Divine banners flutter in the dawn wind.
The spirit transcends the Northern Bureau,
Flying sandals ascend to the Southern Palace.

With sincere intent, summon universally:
The Three Wicked Realms, the Nine Nights,
The Six Paths, the Four Births,
The spiritually endowed yet unenshrined,
The male and female souls in darkness.

May they, by the power of the Three Treasures
And the compassion of the Three Treasures,
At this day and this hour,
Come and attend the Dharma assembly.

**Offering Food | Reception | Chanting Sutras**

**The Second Day**
Purification | Dharma Rites | Reciting the Previous Sutras
Repentance Rituals | Raising Reverent Praise | Each participant bows in respect

**The Three Refuges**
With sincere heart, take refuge in the Three Treasures of the ten directions.
May the departed spirits arise in mind and dedicate,
All paying reverence in faith.

**Seated Praise**
The assembly of the Daoist altar,
Holding tablets before their hearts,
Perform repentance according to the Dharma.

Recite repentance texts—whether the *Repentance to Heaven*,
The *Nine Darknesses Repentance*, or the *Three Officials Repentance*.

**Incantation for Food Before the Spirit Tablet** (as before)
Until evening, offer food to the solitary and forsaken.

**Reciting the Verse | Burning Talismans**
The gate of greatness opens to the mysterious,
The fragrant heavens descend in divine radiance.
Yellow clouds congeal in the numinous palace,
Yin and yang’s qi and signs intermingle.

With sincere intent, summon universally:
The Three Wicked Realms, the Nine Nights,
The Six Paths, the Four Births,
Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants,
Civil and martial, physicians and diviners,
The thousand trades, the myriad classes,
The hundred schools, the nine streams,
The spiritually endowed yet unenshrined,
The male and female souls in darkness.

May they, by the power of the Three Treasures
And the compassion of the Three Treasures,
At this night and this hour,
Come and attend the Dharma assembly.

**Incantation for the Food Vessel | Chanting Sutras**

**The Third Day**

**Ritual Proceedings**

**Consecrating Water and Purifying the Altar | Inviting the Master | Invoking the Divine and Communing with Intent | Placing the Five Directions’ True Talismans for Pacification | Proclaiming the Talismanic Petition | Sealing the Lamps | Summoning the Departed | Bathing and Robing | Paying Reverence | Consecrating the Food and Dedication | Aiding the Forlorn and Offering the Food Vessel | Establishing the Numinous Treasure’s Food-Offering Rite | Extolling the Most Supreme Unity, the Compassionate Savior Lord**

Burning the talismans, sprinkling purification:
The fragrance of pure virtue and power knows no distance unreached;
In the vastness of the Great Void’s expanse, response arises where feeling stirs.

On this day, as we establish the fast and open the Dharma banquet for [Name],
Universally aiding the souls in darkness,
We reverently await the descent of compassionate radiance to grant deliverance.
May the nine gloomy realms’ lingering souls all receive the merit of liberation;
May the six paths’ spirit-souls all attain the fruit of carefree wandering.
The Dharma assembly takes refuge and extols the merit and power.

**Extolling the Most Supreme Unity, the Compassionate Savior Lord**

We have heard:
Qi waxes and wanes, the myriad forms emerge and vanish.
Death follows life, and life follows death;
Humans become ghosts, and ghosts become humans,
Endlessly revolving, ceaselessly repaying.
No sorrow surpasses that of the six paths,
No suffering exceeds that of the four births.
Those lacking in goodness struggle to ascend the steps of virtue,
While those who accumulate evil descend into evil realms.
Yet by the grace of our Mysterious Ancestor,
You are rescued from sinking,
As the rites of vast deliverance are spread,
And the great assembly for transcendence is opened.

At the juncture when yin darkens and yang brightens,
When spirits commune and ghosts gather,
Souls stir and mournful winds arise,
Divine echoes resound and yin mists gather.
At the first resounding cry, the dark earth hears from afar.

We look up to the Purple Pole’s Mysterious Lord,
The Father of the Azure Flower’s Teachings,
Who points to the bright star as a torch of wisdom,
Broadly extending its illumination;
Who condenses the qi of Brahma to form the Dharma Bridge,
Greatly bestowing deliverance.

The messengers of soul-summoning proclaim to the ten directions,
Calling upon the earth deities of their jurisdiction to hasten and urge.
May those of the Heavenly Immortals’ Dao,
The Divine Spirits’ Dao,
The Human Relations’ Dao,
The Hell Dao,
The Hungry Ghost Dao,
The Animal Dao,
And all living beings—fish, turtles, insects—
In the blink of an eye, be universally informed across the high and deep;
In this fleeting moment, be made aware near and far.
Naturally, intent moves and sincerity responds,
Shadow follows echo.

Summoning the many to lead the multitudes,
Voices respond as qi seeks its kind;
Emerging from death to enter life,
The faint of sight may see, the lame may walk.
Unobstructed and unhindered, they come flowing forth;
Some lag behind, some press ahead, arriving in measured pace.
The messengers exert their power of summoning,
While the souls receive the merit of this calling.

All spirits of the Dao of Opening Karma, heed now the sacred chant.
Recite the Fengdu incantation, burn the Summoning Soul talisman,
Invoke the Most High Compassionate Savior, the Merciful Honored One.
Summon the forsaken—chant the verse:

The Great Tenuous returns the Yellow Banner,
The Peerless commands the Spirit Pennant.
Gather and call from the Long Night’s abode,
Open the passage for souls to receive rebirth.

With wholehearted devotion, summon universally:
The nine provinces’ domains, the ten kinds’ river sands,
Those struck down by thunder, devoured by tigers and wolves,
Slain by blade and slaughter, perished in childbirth or battle,
Spirits without rites, the lost souls of men and women.
May they, by the power of the Three Treasures and their boundless compassion,
This very night and hour, come before this Dharma assembly.

With wholehearted devotion, summon universally:
Those who drowned in rivers or wells, swept away by floods,
Consumed by conflagrations, wandering in famine,
Stricken by plague and pestilence, hanged or slain by their own hand,
Spirits without offerings, the lost souls of men and women.
May they, by the power of the Three Treasures and their boundless compassion,
This very night and hour, come before this Dharma assembly.

With wholehearted devotion, summon universally:
All across the ten directions’ empty realms, throughout the wilds,
The souls of those who died far from home, the ghosts of violent demise,
Dry bones and rotting remains, the lost souls of men and women.
May they, by the power of the Three Treasures and their boundless compassion,
This very night and hour, come before this Dharma assembly.

Bathe in the recitation of mantras, burn the spirit garments,
Burn the talismans of absolution, empower the offering of food.

The Scripture of the Five Kitchens

Qi harmonizes in supreme harmony,
Attaining the One, the Dao brings all to peace.
Harmony is not one harmony—
Mysterious principle merges with the boundless mystery.
Do not think thoughts with thought,
Nor seek the absence of thought.
Thought without further reflection—
This is the Dharma held thus.
Do not bind the mind to the mind,
Nor dwell in absolute detachment.
When the mind is present, do not fixate on mind;
In truth, guard the abyss of truth.
Cultivate detachment from intent, yet detach not from intent,
For accumulated practice must not diverge from detachment.
Intent without cultivation of intent—
One’s karma remains unknown even to oneself.

All consume qi to bind qi,
Yet none bind it through prolonged stillness.
Qi returns to its original qi;
Take as you should, discharge as you must.

Scattering the offering of food,
Recite the invocation to the Most High, the Merciful Savior,
Here performing the talismanic rite of refinement and deliverance.

Transmission of the Precepts

The Dao says: Precepts are cessation.
They serve to halt the mind’s transgressions,
Returning it to right concentration—
Thus precepts give rise to concentration.
The Confucians also speak of “knowing cessation,
Then attaining concentration.”
Yet the scriptures of the Three Caverns,
The four auxiliary esoteric texts,
Expound preceptual Dharmas in myriad forms.
Only the Supreme Cavernous Mystery, the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Numinous Treasure,
Stand as the foremost of all precepts.
Revered by heaven and humanity,
Upheld by the hidden and the manifest,
Supreme above the supreme,
Mysterious within the mysterious,
Spiritual among the myriad spirits,
The treasure of the singular qi,
Wondrously pervading the Three Realms,
The precepts restrain the six emotions.
Their number fixed by yang,
They are divided into nine.
Cultivated without pretense,
They are thus called the Twofold Real.
Immortals and mortals look to them as their fortress;
The hidden and manifest rely on them as their bridge.

The soul receives them as Dharma-medicine.
Yet the method of receiving precepts begins with stillness and silence;
The method of upholding precepts exalts diligent reverence.
The assembly of Dharma devotees takes refuge together,
With unified sincerity in praise and chant.

Each person must show reverence—
The Three Refuges are precisely refuge in the Dao,
Refuge in the scriptures,
And refuge in the master.
Thus all souls ought to believe and venerate.

**The Three Refuges**
Once refuge is taken, the precepts are about to be transmitted.
The netherworld brightens as if spring has returned;
Karmic grievances melt like ice dissolved.
Sin’s blossoms wither, merit’s fruit ripens.
The assembly of Dharma devotees, having taken refuge,
Shall now receive the Nine Precepts:

The First Precept: Be diligent, loyal to the sovereign;
The Second Precept: Be respectful and yielding, filial in supporting parents;
The Third Precept: Do not kill, but compassionately save all beings;
The Fourth Precept: Do not engage in licentiousness, but rectify the body and dwell rightly among things;
The Fifth Precept: Do not steal, but extend righteousness and diminish the self;
The Sixth Precept: Do not harbor wrath, nor oppress others with fury;
The Seventh Precept: Do not deceive, nor flatter, harm, or betray the good;
The Eighth Precept: Do not be arrogant, nor scorn the most essential;
The Ninth Precept: Do not waver, but uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.

The wondrous precepts, the numinous text,
Inscribed on yellow registers and white tablets,
Having been fully expounded in the sacred canon,
Are now to be reverently received in their spiritual form.

The heart is hard to restrain,
Yet restrained by the Nine Precepts, it may return to the Great Void.
The form has not yet transcended,
Yet transcended by the Two Talismans, it may refine itself in the upper realms.
The departed soul must be reborn;
While living, do not forget the precepts.
Through kalpas, ever uphold the talismanic covenant.

Calm the spirit beyond the material world,
Severing worldly ties across many lives;
Receiving form in the yang realm,
Good fruits naturally gather like ice congealing.
Fragrance lingers in the present,
Blessings extend without end.
Bowing to the Merciful Venerable One,
The feast concludes, and the departed is sent forth.

Recite the talismanic memorial,
Send off the departed,
Transform the paper offerings,
And dedicate the merit.

The Ritual of the Three Offerings for Salvation and the Jiao Sacrifice

Recite the incantations, declare the ranks, and with the Dharma Master [Name] and the assembled ritualists of this altar, we reverently and sincerely invoke:

The Boundless and Spontaneous, the Limitless Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao; the Azure Empyrean Savior of Suffering, the Merciful Venerable One; the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm; the Patriarchal Perfected Sovereign of Orthodox Unity, the Serene and Responsive True Lord; the Ancestral Perfected Master; the Masters of the Scriptures and Salvation; and all the Perfected Ones of the ranks—may the numinous altar respond to our invocation, and all majestic spirits attend.

We have heard:
In the cloud-palace of the Dharma-realm, above, we gaze upon the radiance of the Eastern Pole;
In the wind-marsh of the hollow void, below, we reach the bounds of the Northern Yin.
No scrutiny escapes the net of law, yet the handle of the Dipper opens the mysterious rites.
Relying on the cinnabar tablet, the soul is led from darkness, and delusion is shattered;
Aided by the jade gaze, the form is refined, and the luminous spirit is perfected as true.
The Merciful Venerable One’s vow-power is vast and deep; the benevolent hearts of immortals and sages shine forth.
As this rite is established, resonance arises with life, and transformation brings carefree wandering.
In the Purple Court and the Pure Capital, our reverent aspirations are fully expressed;
From the muddy streams and flowing waters, our humble devotion is wholly offered.
We humbly pray that feathered winds sweep away the dust, cloud chariots drift upon the light,
Manifesting in response to beings and circumstances, like the moon mirrored in a thousand rivers,
Soaring through the void, riding the qi in flight.
May the fragrance drift to the eight directions, and benevolent grace flow abundantly.
Witness our reverence and sincerity, and accept our earnest devotion.
We now present the First Offering.

**First Offering Rites**
We have heard:
The limitless and boundless are unfathomable in their mysterious subtlety;
Life and death follow one another like night and day.
Yet the divergence of delusion and awakening leads to the distinction of ascent and descent.
We contemplate the suffering of the dark, copper-bound prisons, where some fall into confinement;
We gaze upon the compassionate light of the Azure Empyrean’s lotus throne, where salvation is sought.
Thus, we follow the immortal models, bathing and refining the form and soul.
Transcending the unceasing cycles of birth and transformation, we dare not delay in offering our devotion.
The waxen lamps’ wicks unfold nine-colored auspicious radiance;
The pine flowers of the ritual mat sincerely move the assembly of the Perfected.
In solemn and reverent order, we again offer our earnest devotion,
And now present the Second Offering.

**Second Offering Rites**
We have heard:
The luminous wisdom of the Mystic Clarity flows endlessly through the teachings;
Carefree joy and bliss belong to the transcended souls who find their return.
Rescuing the hidden and manifest, we revive with clarity;
Holding fast to sincerity, we are fervent in our plea.
The grace of the waves is profound, deeply bestowed and felt;
The bright water is offered with humility, though our gifts are meager.
May the departed soul swiftly shed karmic retribution and forever sever clinging attachments.
In the moonlight’s radiance, may they awaken to their original nature;
In the realms of humans and gods, may they be reborn in bodies of blessed wisdom.
Now, the filial devotee [Name], moved by sincerity, fulfills their vows.
May the three disasters and eight difficulties silently vanish, and auspicious blessings ever abide;
May a hundred harmonies and a thousand blessings converge, and every step be luminous.
With wholehearted devotion, we present the wine of the Final Offering.

**Third Offering Rites**
Recite the memorial.
Send forth the spirits.

Bowing in reverence, we affirm that the Dao rejects nothing, ever cleansing and uplifting without fail; rites possess their proper forms, and we are fortunate that this offering is now complete. The fragrant wine in the cup, clear and deep, has been poured, while the sinking water-clock’s arrow hastens on. Dust and defilement shame us, mere mortals; how could the swift wings of the divine ever pause for our entreaties? The visions of cloud and sky are truly beyond our full grasp; the profound grace of the cosmos still ever relies upon its sheltering care. We, [Names], can scarcely contain our longing and devotion, and so with utmost reverence we bow twice and humbly send forth the spirits.

**Burning of Paper Offerings** | **Full Dispersal of Offerings**

The *Rites for the Establishment of the Fast and Offering* of the Great Ming Mysterious Teachings are now concluded.
