**Explanations on the Torch Light Fast**
By Lu Xiujing

Before assembling the fast, one should retire to a private chamber, burn incense, and gird oneself to expound the rites.

The "torch light" (jué guāng) is akin to what Zhuangzi called a "torch flame"—a faint illumination. The methods of fasting are most refined, yet practitioners often remain coarse, for the five turbidities and defilements obscure them deeply, as though dwelling in a dark cavern where the sun’s rays never reach. To guide those lost in such gloom, the brightness of lamps and candles is fitting. The "torch light" refers precisely to this.

These explanations outline the main principles of the fast scriptures, presenting the essentials of the ritual body in accessible terms. The intent is to restrain the crude and vulgar while guiding toward profound clarity. It is like a carpenter selecting wood: when the grain is twisted and warped, one must first trim the outer edges before applying the inked line to shape it. I am ashamed of my own clumsiness, which has led to such prolixity. Perhaps the grain of this text is too gnarled for even a master craftsman to work.

When preparing for a fast or offering, one should first explain the rites in a private chamber, girding oneself and kindling incense according to proper form.

In fasting, one must sit in silent seclusion, mastering the passions and closing the gates of the spirit to prevent external burdens from entering. One upholds the Ten Precepts, ensuring worldly thoughts do not arise. One cultivates a heart of courage and vigor, practicing the Ten Daoist Practices. One’s resolve must be firm and unshakable, like a tree deeply rooted. One contemplates the profound and savors the true, ensuring every thought is pure—only then can it be called a fast.

1. **Purifying Bath:** Bathe in fragrant water to cleanse the spirit, qi, and the five limbs, making the nine orifices bright and clear. Clothing must be spotless, both inside and out, suffused with fragrance. This is to welcome the descent of the exalted perfected and to meet the gaze of the numinous and subtle.

2. **Renouncing Worldly Affairs:** Sever all worldly ties, withdraw from internal and external distractions, and abide in tranquil non-action. Body and mind must be at ease, focused and undistracted.

3. **Moderating Diet:** Abstain from rich flavors and curb desires, regulating excess and deficiency so that the organs are harmonized, the spirit and qi purified, and the primordial spring nourished.

4. **Proper Attire and Demeanor:** Maintain solemnity and reverence in dress and bearing. Abandon arrogance and sloth, ensuring no negligence in conduct. Bowing, prostrations, and every act must be performed with utmost propriety.

5. **Silence and Recitation:** Seal the mouth and still the tongue, avoiding idle speech. Regulate the voice and rectify the qi while reciting scriptures. This awakens humans and spirits and resonates with immortals and sages.

6. **Purifying the Mind:** Cleanse the heart and thoughts, banishing perverse imaginings. Subdue the six senses and eradicate the Three Poisons. Focus the spirit on the true, penetrating the profound and subtle.

7. **Incense and Invocation:** Burn incense and waft its smoke, strike the drum to summon the gods. Let the Three Clarities hear above and the Ten Directions know below.

8. **Repentance and Petition:** Confess transgressions and seek forgiveness, making vows with a heart of utmost sincerity, humble and earnest.

9. **Great Compassion:** Extend boundless mercy, pitying all who suffer calamities and afflictions, wishing to deliver them all. May birth and death cease, and sorrow be no more.

10. **Graceful Conduct:** Every movement—advancing, retreating, rising, or bowing—must be refined and unhurried. Encourage one another, confining speech to the Dao, never straying from the Dharma. If one becomes aware of errors or lapses, one must immediately prostrate and repent.

This is the *Lingbao Natural and Supreme Fast*.

"Ling" means "numinous." Its wondrous efficacy transcends thought and imagination, its transformations boundless—hence it is called "ling."

"Bao" means "one." It is what the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, and Humanity) attain, embodying purity, tranquility, and integrity. Since it cannot be lost, it is called "bao." If one embraces it without parting, myriad blessings will naturally arrive. To stray from it even for a moment is to invite chaos and calamity. Fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm, gain and loss—none can compel these outcomes, nor can any prevent them. Thus, it is called "natural."

It universally aids the Five Paths, delivering all beings, extinguishing the cycle of birth and death, and transcending the Three Realms—hence it is called "supreme."

Though humans are not perfected sages, they dwell in the Five Turbidities, where the Three Corpses thrive, internally generating thieves. The nine orifices and four gates each pursue their own ends, and every action leads toward death, cutting short one’s heavenly years. Failing to fulfill one’s allotted lifespan, one commits evil and accumulates sins in the hidden courts. Thus, in this world, one suffers hardship, never resting from the human path. Hunger, cold, poverty, and lowliness; illness, punishment, and calamity; disasters and misfortunes—all entangle and assail. Only after death does one tread the path of suffering.

This is why the Most High Heavenly Worthy opened the Purple Tenuity Jade Writ of the Upper Palace of the Mysterious Capital and revealed the wondrous fasts of Lingbao.

Humans are restless in the Three Passes, unable to remain still. Their bodies engage in killing, theft, and lust—thus, they are disciplined through bowing and prostration. Their mouths utter evil words, frivolous speech, and double-tongued deceit—thus, they are tasked with scripture recitation. Their hearts harbor thoughts of greed, desire, anger, and hatred—thus, they are made to contemplate the spirit. Through these three methods, the heart is cleansed, and conduct is purified. When heart and conduct are refined to perfection, this is the meaning of fasting.

One should widely vow good intentions to expand merit and karma. The resolve to uphold precepts must be like grasping a rope while falling into a well—never letting go for even a moment. The commitment to the Dharma must be like reinforcing a crumbling dam—never allowing laziness. The devotion to practice must be like planting fertile fields—never growing weary. Day and night, one reveres the precepts and honors the Dharma with tireless diligence. Then, one will resonate with the Great Mystery, and the perfected spirits will descend. The Three Corpses will scatter and vanish, and all demons will be subdued. With such vows, nothing will go unfulfilled, and no aspiration will remain unachieved.

The age of the sages is hard to encounter; the scriptures and Dharma are hard to hear. Favorable times are hard to come by; enlightened teachers are hard to meet. All you worthy ones, in past lives, have accumulated great blessings, bringing this joyous convergence in your present existence. You have encountered the Three Treasures, heard the sounds of the Dharma, and inclined toward purity and emptiness. You have feasted on the flavors of the numinous, and your names are already inscribed in the imperial registers of the celestial archives, written in gold and jade. You are the honored guests of the Heavenly Palace and the immortal companions of the Most High.

Now you have ascended to the Dharma seat, embracing the Dharma’s discipline—having made a virtuous beginning, why not bring it to fulfillment? Let us together steel our resolve, contending with sloth, upholding the Dharma’s teachings, and regarding mindfulness as sublime practice. Strive with earnest sincerity, sparing no effort, counting no toil. A single day of diligence shall bring blessings across lifetimes.

Human life is perilous; the four elements are unreliable. A century passes in an instant—how much time is truly ours? If decrepitude suddenly arrives—eyes dimmed, ears dulled, afflictions and pains entwined—then even in sleep, sitting, breathing, or movement, one must rely on others’ strength. In such a state, could one still advance in the Dao’s work, or remain in this Dharma seat?

To lose this auspicious opportunity—when shall we meet again? To sink into the depths of suffering—what use is regret? Ponder these words, each for your own sake. Encourage one another, and together cross the perilous straits.

If one’s past lives bear heavy sins and karmic debts, they become enshrouded in obscuring veils, the six senses unopened. The mind grows crooked and narrow, the qi perverse and rebellious. Deluded by the five desires, they see nothing beyond. They indulge in rich flavors, sounds, and sights, seeking fleeting pleasure. They resent goodness and envy the worthy, treating them like foes.

Such people, wherever they turn, form bonds with evil and never encounter the scriptures and teachings—or if they do, they do not believe. Seeing others reverence and follow the Dao and Dharma, they call it delusion and join in mockery. The deaf do not hear the *Shao* and *Wu* melodies; the blind do not see black from white. Can they be said to suffer from their own afflictions?

Even if wise counsel forcibly drags them forward, it is not their nature. They soon repent, turning from truth to falsehood, chasing after demonic illusions. For them, joy is fleeting, while sorrow stretches long. These beings take the three wretched realms as their path, the earth and mountains as their home. Forever lost in darkest night, they never behold the three luminaries. They embrace copper pillars, tread upon knife mountains, walk beneath sword trees, plunge into cauldrons of boiling oil, swallow fire and devour coals—through endless kalpas, no escape.

Even if reborn, they fall into the forms of the six livestock, their bodies subjected to the cruelty of slaughter, their souls trapped in the three evil destinies. Drifting and tossed between lives, how pitiful they are!

*Dharma Lamp Record*, composed by Lu Xiujing.

At the onset of the evening fast, one burns incense and lodges the initial invocation, then, facing east before the deities, recites the following.

**Dharma Lamp.** *Dharma* signifies the compass and square—collectively termed "the Dharma." The compass draws the circle, the square marks the right angle; all things conform to them and thus attain correctness. *Lamp* denotes an object that emits light, aiding the moon and supplementing the sun, dispelling dusk and illuminating darkness. By its radiance, one gains sight. Crookedness and deceit lack the Dharma and thus cannot rectify themselves; applying the Dharma without illumination fails to reveal gains and losses. To rectify, one cannot be without the Dharma; to apply the Dharma, one cannot be without illumination. To stabilize the self, one must fast; to fast, one cannot be without this text. This text serves as the *Dharma Lamp*, guiding one through the Daoist canon to attain the true treasure.

Of all things, humans are most noble; of humans, life is most precious. Life depends on spirit and *qi*. Spirit and *qi* reside within the body as the life of the four limbs. Humans cannot be without *qi* for even a moment, nor can they lose spirit in bowing or rising. Losing spirit causes the five viscera to collapse; losing *qi* brings sudden death. Spirit and *qi* always move in tandem. Spirit and *qi* rely on each other to strengthen. When spirit departs, *qi* perishes; when *qi* is cut off, the body is lost. All fear death and delight in life, yet fail to recognize that the work of living lies in spirit and *qi*. Instead, they repeatedly harm their minds, offend their *qi*, indulge their spirits, and wither their lives. They do not cherish stillness or preserve their true nature, thus inviting ruin.

How can one not treasure essence and guard *qi* to seek long-lasting vision, harmonizing and nurturing all things to cultivate the blessings of branches and leaves? The sages, seeing the people rushing after the five desires and unable to stabilize themselves, established the fast. Through affairs, they quell affairs; through precepts, they restrain inner foes; through威仪, they guard against external threats. Ritual recitation engages body and speech, steering movement back to stillness. Meditation on the deities engages the mind, guiding existence toward emptiness. In stillness and emptiness, the *qi* harmonizes with the Dao, like reining in a swift steed to align the chariot returning to truth. Yan Zun said: "Empty the heart to trace the Dao and virtue; still the *qi* to await the divine." This is the meaning.

Yet scholars of the degenerate age value ornament over substance. Though blessings lie in stillness, they seek them in motion; though life rests within, they abandon the self for external things. Such people, though eager to practice fasting, do not understand its methods. Or, understanding its methods, they do not recognize its form. Or, recognizing its form, they do not grasp its meaning. Or, grasping its meaning, they do not attain its intent. Confused and disordered, they act without restraint, drifting from their origin, forever unaware—like turning from a fierce wind to follow a swift current, ignorant of how to row back to the source, thus sinking forever in the sea of suffering. How tragic!

I have carefully gathered teachings from various scriptures and compiled them into ten chapters, to be applied during fasting, naming it *Dharma Lamp*. The first chapter concerns the initial evening invocation; six chapters address the six periods of ritual circumambulation; three chapters focus on the three periods of meditation on the deities. If the Dharma Master illuminates these to conduct the fast, and all officials and hosts receive them with empty hearts, then their sight and hearing will become clear, and they may glimpse the gate of the great Dao.

The *Dao* is the name for the ultimate principle. *Virtue* is acting in accordance with that principle. *Scripture* is the path that leads through. The *Dao* is like a road; *virtue* is good virtue; *scripture* is like a measured path; *practice* is like walking; *Dharma* is like a model. Those who study the Dao must follow the Dharma to seek the scriptures, practice goodness to cultivate virtue, and thus attain the Dao. Without performing meritorious deeds, merely holding to one thing without change will never achieve the Dao—like a person sitting at home without walking, how can they see the road?

The Dao, when combined threefold, forms virtue. Without completing the three, nothing is achieved. The three are: Dao, virtue, and benevolence. Benevolence is one; performing meritorious deeds is two; virtue sufficient to complete the Dao is three. When these three unite, one attains the Dao. If one only performs meritorious deeds but does not understand the Dao, one does not attain the Dao. If one only understands the Dao but lacks meritorious deeds, one does not attain the Dao. If one possesses Dao and virtue but lacks benevolence, the ultimate principle becomes obscured and returns to nothingness. Like sowing grain by casting seeds into the earth without water to moisten them, how can they grow? With a ruler and ministers but no people, how can they govern? With heaven and earth but no beings, how can they nurture? Thus, the *Five Thousand Words* states: "The three give birth to the ten thousand things."

The selection of precepts and the imposition of prohibitions and penalties follow the established texts composed by Master Lu.

After completing the initial evening invocation, the Ten Precepts of the Highest Grade are conferred, with all facing east and standing evenly. The *Hymn of Wisdom* is recited:

Wisdom arises from the originless,
Darkly transcending the ten directions.
Binding emptiness, it towers in the mystic firmament,
While all heavens embrace its flowing fragrance.
Its wonder defies thought,
Its numinous resonance truly connects.
Being is ultimately non-being,
Non-being contains all without exclusion.
Wisdom constantly observes the body,
The foremost task in studying the Dao.
Subtly entering profound contemplation,
Naturally it records my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy ever protects,
The demon kings pledge their guardianship.
Resplendent is the vajra body,
Lofty before the Most High.
Wisdom engenders the root of precepts,
The true Dao takes precepts as its master.
From this the Three Treasures arise,
Revered and received by the exalted sages.
Riding this deathless vessel,
Swiftly it crosses the great expanse.
At this moment of preaching the precepts,
All heavens come to bow their heads.

After the recitation, all turn north, prostrate themselves fully to the ground, and, turning their hearts, pay homage to the ten directions before returning to face east and prostrate again. The Dharma Master turns to face west, and, with dignity, proclaims the precepts.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: "Now I shall universally proclaim the Dharma’s sound to awaken all beings. For all men and women, I shall dissolve disasters and avert calamities, entreat blessings and deliver lives, and eradicate the roots of all suffering."

May the living behold the Dao and escape the eight difficulties of embodiment,
while the dead rejoice, feast in celestial halls,
and swiftly be reborn among men as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings.
All who fast and seek the Dao must single-mindedly request and receive the Ten Precepts,
attending closely lest they forget.
Focus the mind in silent contemplation,
penetrating reflection upon the natural.
Let no stray thoughts disturb body and spirit.
Those who can do this shall listen in stillness.

The First Precept: Let the heart harbor no malice or envy,
giving no rise to the thieves of yin.
Guard the mouth and be cautious of transgressions;
let thoughts dwell upon the Dharma.

The Second Precept: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing,
showing compassion and aiding all beings.
Embrace kindness and extend salvation,
nourishing all things.

The Third Precept: Maintain chastity and yield to righteousness,
neither lusting nor stealing.
Ever cultivate good thoughts,
sacrificing the self to aid others.

The Fourth Precept: Be free from sensuality and desire,
keeping the heart from reckless abandon.
Uphold purity and vigilance,
ensuring conduct remains unstained.

The Fifth Precept: Let the mouth utter no evil words,
nor speak with ornate deceit.
Be upright within and without,
committing no transgressions of speech.

The Sixth Precept: Abstain from wine and moderate conduct,
harmonizing qi and temperament.
Let the spirit remain unharmed,
avoiding all manifold evils.

The Seventh Precept: Do not envy those who surpass you,
nor contend for fame and merit.
In all matters, yield and withdraw,
humbling yourself to deliver others.

The Eighth Precept: Do not criticize the scriptures and teachings,
nor slander the sacred texts.
Devote yourself to the Dharma,
ever as though in the presence of the divine.

The Ninth Precept: Do not engage in quarrels or disputes,
nor judge the four classes of beings.
Let neither heaven nor man bear resentment,
lest spirit and qi be harmed.

The Tenth Precept: In all actions and deeds,
maintain equanimity and single-mindedness.
Let harmony prevail among people and spirits,
ensuring conduct remains thus.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: Those who cultivate and uphold the pure precepts
ever align with the heart of heaven.
Ever practicing great compassion,
they vow to universally deliver all from this world of suffering.
Humbly revering the teachings,
they must not grow lax midway.
Better to die upholding goodness
than to live in evil.
Thus unwavering,
one may escape the five destinies,
avoid the three evils,
be protected by all heavens,
and revered by the myriad spirits.
Those who maintain long fasts and uphold the precepts
shall naturally attain deliverance.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: The Dao is exalted, the Dharma wondrous,
and the human body is likewise precious.
Thus the Dao unfolds the Dharma,
bequeathing precepts and scriptures
to deliver the human form.
Once the human form is delivered,
it ascends to become one with the Dao.
One should practice with diligence,
maintaining fasts and upholding precepts,
calming the mind in stillness,
keeping aspirations clear,
focusing intent single-mindedly,
without distraction.
Purify the six viscera,
avoid rich flavors at meals,
and maintain inner and outer purity,
ever in accord with the natural.
On such fasting days,
light incense and make vows,
so that the heart’s sincerity ascends.
The patrolling deities of the Four Heavens
and the mighty spirits of the Ten Divisions
will descend to observe,
listening to the Dharma’s sound
and overseeing your heart.
Those who uphold the precepts and practice the Dao
shall have their merits recorded in the heavens,
where fortune and misfortune manifest instantly.
The Dao does not fail those who practice diligently;
attend closely and receive without doubt,
lest demonic words deceive.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: When establishing fasts and practicing the Dao,
the Four Heavenly Kings ride upon flying clouds,
green-canopied eight-jewel jade chariots,
accompanied by perfected beings and jade maidens,
holding flower banners,
leading with phoenix songs,
followed by celestial music.
White cranes and lions
sing in harmonious chorus,
burning incense and scattering flowers,
floating through the void as they come.
They gaze upon those practicing the Dao,
listening to the Dharma’s sound.
The Heavenly Kings descend,
and the myriad spirits pay homage.
How could one not fully adhere to this Dharma?
First receive the Ten Precepts,
then practice the Dao,
proceeding with refined steps,
calming the heart and quieting the mind.
In sitting, rising, lying, and resting,
never depart from proper decorum.
The Heavenly Kings rejoice,
and names are inscribed in the Upper Clarity.
This is truly attaining the Dao within the square inch of the heart.

The scripture states: To move heaven and earth,
summon the hosts of spirits,
communicate with the Dao of immortals,
penetrate the utmost truth,
dissolve the sins of past lives,
extinguish misfortune,
repel vengeful foes,
cultivate great virtue,
heal illnesses,
and deliver all beings—
nothing surpasses the practice of fasting and reciting scriptures.
Fasting is indeed the foundation of seeking the Dao,
through which all accomplishments are achieved.
Its merit is towering,
unmatched by any other.
Above, it enables ascension to immortality and attainment of the Dao;
in the middle, it brings peace to nations and families,
prolongs life and increases longevity,
and secures blessings and prosperity,
attaining the Dao of non-action.
Below, it erases past transgressions,
pardons present faults,
rescues from distress and eases hardship,
dispels disasters and illnesses,
relieves the suffering of the dead,
and delivers all beings—
nothing is inapt.

The scripture states: Among the great methods of fasting,
none precedes the *Lingbao* Fast of the Most High.
The *Lingbao* scriptures
are the primordial root of heaven and earth,
the gateway and window of the divine,
the ancestor of all scriptures,
and the bridge of boundless great Dharma.
If one recites but a single sentence,
its resonance pierces the nine heavens,
and all heavens pay homage,
while ghosts and spirits stand in awe.
Profound and wondrous,
beyond full declaration—
only the utmost goodness in the world
can achieve this.
Only the utmost sincerity in the world
can invoke this.
Only the utmost devotion in the world
can uphold this.
Only the utmost talent in the world
can practice this.

The Most High holds it in the highest regard, and all perfected beings revere it—all cast in golden characters, inscribed upon jade tablets, sealed within the Supreme Great Luotian, the Mystic Capital’s Jade Capital Mountain, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, upon the Seven Treasures’ Mystic Terrace. This terrace is where the Most High presides. The Five Elders stand in attendance, the Ten Thousand Emperors pay homage to the perfected, jade maidens hold the towels, golden youths waft incense, burning the hundred harmonies’ blended fragrance to suffuse the Purple Court. They exhale the essence of the sun to dispel impurity, scatter the radiance of the moon to brush away dust. Divine lamps shine brightly, their flames merging in brilliance; golden winds scatter in eight directions, auspicious clouds array in four quarters. Flying dragons and poisonous beasts guard the jade gates. The perfected of the ten directions, the great sages of the three thousand great thousand worlds who have attained the Dao, and the spontaneously wondrous and practiced perfected ones—all circumambulate the Upper Palace thrice daily, bowing in reverence, soaring through empty space, scattering flowers and burning incense. In their hands they hold the Ten Absolutes, chanting and intoning the profound chapters, praising the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens and honoring the wondrous weight of the Mystic Writ.

Now, when Daoists fast and circumambulate the high seat, chanting and pacing the void, they precisely emulate the ancient root of the Mystic, the assembly of the perfected sages as they pay court in the Jade Capital. In performing the Dao and offering obeisance, all should move with calm and refined steps, their bearing orderly and composed, their bows and gazes aligned, without disorder. As they circumambulate and pace the void, all hold tablets before their hearts. In winter, they must not clasp their hands over their hearts; in summer, they must not fan themselves. They should face forward with upright bodies, their eyes gazing inward, visualizing the Most High upon the high seat, fixing their thoughts upon the Mystic and True, so that heart and form become as cinnabar, in harmony with the celestial canon. Thus shall they be marveled at by flying immortals, serve as the model for the Three Realms, and be beheld with reverence by ghosts and spirits.

They must not glance left or right, nor jostle one another, nor speak or laugh in jest, nor call out—lest they offend the numinous majesty, be censured by the Four Controllers, or incur the Five Emperors’ penalties. The clear statutes forbid such transgressions; how can one not be cautious?

The scripture states: During the fast, at dawn and dusk, thrice daily, burn incense and repent transgressions, listening with single-minded devotion to the wondrous and profound meanings of the scriptural Dharma. Thus, when the scriptures are recited and the Dharma expounded, it is as when the ancient perfected ones taught and transformed. The sages transmit the scriptural teachings to the world, that those who have not heard may hear, and those who have not known may know. By this Dharma bridge, they universally deliver all people.

During the performance of the Dao, one must not speak idly or discuss worldly affairs; one should only inquire of the Dharma Master regarding the scriptural meanings and precepts. The Dharma Master shall then expound the true essentials. If one can achieve inner and outer tranquility, reverently receiving even a single sentence of the scripture, the Controller of Destinies shall add ten years to one’s lifespan, and thereafter one shall be wise and enlightened. If one is restless within or without, and offends even a single sentence of the scripture, the Controller of Destinies shall deduct ten years, and thereafter one shall follow blind and foolish paths.

Thus, the perfected do not speak idly; when they speak, their words strike true, all in accord with the Dharma’s speech. It is said: “Humans can magnify the Dao; the Dao does not magnify humans.”

When the precepts have been expounded, the Dharma Master once more selects and appoints the assembly’s officers. The officers kneel to receive their tablets. On the morrow, during the performance of the Dao, each shall oversee their appointed duties.

The Dharma Master—
The scripture states: One should elevate those of lofty virtue, profound in their understanding of the scriptural meanings. Such a person’s virtue fills them within, their majestic bearing manifests without; in every movement and stillness, they embody the Dharma’s model. They are the exemplar of the Three Realms, the gaze of ghosts and spirits. In opening prayers and invoking blessings, they commune with the perfected and summon the numinous, resolving doubts and dispelling obstructions, guiding and enlightening the assembly of worthies.

The Precentor—
The scripture states: One of keen intelligence and clarity, practiced in the Dharma’s disciplines. Their duty is, during the performance of the Dao, in all matters of eating and resting, to follow the Dharma Master’s lead, then guide the assembly of officers in bowing, yielding, and all acts of reverence, which they shall intone and chant.

The Fasting Supervisor—
Their duty is to oversee the assembly’s transgressions, to censure and correct faults, to uphold the statutes and ordinances, and to report all matters as they arise, ensuring all is just and proper, without concealment or leniency.

The Scripture Attendant—
Their duty is to serve the honored scriptures, arranging the cloth wrappings, the high seat and its table, and the seating mats on all four sides, keeping all clean and orderly, without negligence.

The Incense Attendant—
Their duty is to prepare the censer and its implements, ensuring the fire burns and the ash remains clean. During the six periods of the Dao’s performance and the three periods of recitation and lecture, all must be prepared in advance, without last-minute deficiencies.

The Lamp Attendant—
Their duty is, as the sun approaches the western horizon, to prepare the lamp implements, arranging them according to the Dharma, ensuring the flames burn brightly and steadily. If wind or rain prevents the fire from standing, they shall consult the Dharma Master, and only then may the lamps be extinguished. They must not be negligent, nor allow any lapse or omission.

When the selection and appointment of officers is complete, they circumambulate to the left to offer incense, facing east to pray, then return to the incense. The officers lead the procession to the hall, arranging themselves in order and taking their seats without loosening their sashes.

The Dharma Master then proclaims the statutes and precepts, instructing the assembly in the majestic bearing, which all shall listen to in silence.

When Daoists enter the fast, each shall bring their own towel, robe, tablet, and footwear; they must not exchange these with others at the last moment, lest there be deficiencies, nor may they borrow garments not their own.

On the day of the fast, when burning incense or descending from the lecture, the Precentor shall lead the assembly of officers to first descend from their seats and stand facing west. The Dharma Master shall then descend from the high seat, leading the procession in order of seniority, moving with refined and measured steps to the Dharma gate. They must not jostle or overtake one another, nor move too swiftly or slowly, all subject to censure and penalty according to the statutes.

When the incense offering is complete, and when descending from the lecture, the Precentor shall lead the assembly of officers to first exit the hall and stand facing west. The Dharma Master shall then ascend to the high seat, whereupon all officers shall bow once in unison before taking their seats.

When Daoists enter or leave the fast, they shall report to the Fasting Supervisor, bow once to the Dharma Master, then bow thrice to the incense before departing. Upon returning, they shall do likewise. Transgressions shall be penalized as follows:

Arriving at the fasting hall with disheveled footwear: two *sheng* of oil.
Sitting or rising without order: half a *liang* of cinnabar.
Sitting improperly: two *jin* of incense.
Upsetting the incense or fire: half a *jin* of incense.

Speaking to outsiders during ritual proceedings: one *jin* of incense.
Attending to the scriptures with disheveled attire, or touching objects from the high seat: half a *jin* of incense.
Discussing worldly affairs: two *sheng* of oil.
Engaging in frivolous speech or laughter: one *liang* of cinnabar.
Muttering or dozing off: half a *liang* of cinnabar.
Spilling lamp oil: five *sheng* of oil.
Wearing headscarves or robes improperly: half a *jin* of incense.
Failing to maintain mutual discipline, or raising one’s voice harshly: five *sheng* of oil.
Listening to scriptures while leaning or resting without holding a tablet: one *sheng* of oil.
Lacking focused reverence, or allowing the mind to wander—if noticed by others: two *sheng* of oil.
Leaving the fasting hall without reporting: two *sheng* of oil.
Letting hair hang loose or walking hurriedly: one *jin* of incense.
Reciting scriptures carelessly, or mispronouncing passages when questioned: five *sheng* of oil.
Chanting out of unison: two *sheng* of oil.
Performing the incense ritual without washing hands or rinsing the mouth: two *sheng* of oil.
Failing to observe proper etiquette in bowing, rising, or yielding: half a *jin* of incense.
Circulating out of order: half a *jin* of incense.
Allowing incense smoke to extinguish while tending it: four *sheng* of oil.
The Precentor failing to chant or praise with care: one *jin* of incense.
Rising, moving, or returning to one’s seat without bowing thrice to the scriptures before departing: one *jin* of incense.
Allowing the lamp to extinguish while tending it: one *jin* of incense.
Rushing forward abruptly during the incense offering: one *sheng* of oil.
The Fasting Supervisor failing to prepare offerings, or causing shortages: one *jin* of incense.
The Enforcer observing transgressions but concealing them out of favoritism: six *sheng* of oil.
Receiving reports but failing to present them to superiors: three *sheng* of oil.
Leaving the fast to attend to personal matters and failing to return—if reported by others: one *dou* of oil and one *jin* of incense.
Engaging in deceitful or vulgar speech, or discussing private improprieties: one *jin* of incense, five *sheng* of oil, and three *liang* of cinnabar.

The *Golden Register* states: Ascending or descending the fast without fulfilling ritual duties shall be addressed by the Fasting Supervisor according to the offense. For three or more infractions, the offender shall be stripped of their rank and expelled, with their transgressions announced to the assembly, and they shall not be permitted to remain in the ritual seat. If the Fasting Supervisor neglects to enforce these rules, they shall receive the same penalty as the offender. Should the Dharma Master in the high seat fail in their duties, their faults shall be recorded and reported to the Fasting Supervisor. For one to three infractions, they shall be barred from the ritual seat for three hundred days.

The *Statutes on Dignity* state: Fines shall be delivered to the Fasting Supervisor, announced to the assembly, and then used for public purposes. All these prohibitions derive from the ancient codes of the Supreme Bureau of the Mysterious Capital, serving to curb negligence and enforce discipline. The Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion, pities those who incur sin through ritual lapses and thus permits redemption through offerings of incense and oil, that their misfortunes may be dispelled and their offenses dissolved, rather than allowing them to accumulate in the unseen realm. This also awakens remorse in the transgressor, prompting reform and renewal. Though the required offerings of incense and oil may seem modest, they are often difficult to procure at short notice. Moreover, Daoists gathered for a fast are often not regular members of the community; once the ritual concludes, they disperse, and fines may go unpaid, further violating the scriptural intent and compounding their guilt. Even those guilty of grave offenses may seek redemption through fasting and atonement. How much more should those who uphold the precepts strive for reverence in ritual? If minor lapses in decorum are to be penalized with prostrations, this too may be permissible, with the number of bows determined by the severity of the offense. The officiating officers shall assess each case and report to the Fasting Supervisor with due respect.

The fast is a practice of utmost refinement, governed by strict prohibitions. This is because the Heavenly Perfected, the Great Spirits, the sages of the ten directions, and the myriad spirits of the three realms all descend to the ritual site, observing and witnessing the proceedings. Demon kings bow in reverence, and local deities stand guard at the gates. The Fasting Supervisor must ensure the premises are swept clean. All, great and small, must maintain silence, and the gates must be marked to bar entry, preventing interference from outsiders or the uninitiated. If devout men and women, sincere in their faith, arrive in proper attire to observe the ritual, they shall be seated separately and not intermingled with the assembly. All participants, high and low, must wear sashes and proper footwear, not slouching or shuffling. When giving instructions, voices must be gentle and measured; shouting is forbidden. Harsh voices disturb the Heavenly Perfected and violate the sacred prohibitions. If guests or the Fasting Supervisor are in mourning, even if they have not met, they must maintain composure and avoid expressions of grief or consolation.

If guests are of lower status than the host, or if worldly distinctions create disparity, they may not fully grasp the reverence due to Daoists. Yet the Dao is supreme, its virtue unmatched; though a Daoist may be humble, their aspirations are lofty. The Fasting Supervisor, seeking divine favor, should humble themselves, yield to the Daoist’s guidance, and empty their pride, that virtue may flow and blessings abound. They must not remain aloof or arrogant, for to slight a Daoist is to sever the unseen currents of grace and block the descent of celestial blessings. Heaven’s rain falls evenly, yet mountain peaks remain dry, for their steep heights leave no place to receive it. The Eastern Sea reigns over all rivers not by force or coercion, but by its nature—vast and lowly, embracing all impurities, drawing the convergence of countless streams. If a child is too young to participate in the fast, they must not be allowed near the ritual hall or disrupt the proceedings.

The essence of the fast lies in purity and emptiness, its practice in tranquility, its foundation in humility, and its conduct in reverence.

With trembling caution, as though treading upon ice or crossing a ravine; with solemn dread, as though standing before a stern sovereign. At every verse of the scripture, rise to perform the rites of bowing. In each moment, single-mindedly invoke goodness, following the promptings of one’s intent and aspirations—only let sincerity be pure, and response will surely come. The Most High’s Daoist gaze ever pierces through, surveying all good and evil beneath the heavens, with no detail overlooked.
