**Golden Talisman Tenfold Invocation and Closing Rites for the Liberation of All Beings at Midday**
*(After the solemn vow of fasting)*

**Threefold Refuge** (*Sānupratishṭhāna*)
**Sūtra of Past Lives** (*Shùmìng Zàn*)
**Invocation of the Fivefold Session to Open the Scripture**

With reverence, I humbly present:
*"By the auspicious realm of the soaring jade and triumphant longevity,*
*I transcend the formless realm [of the Pure Land].*
*Within the verdant expanse where the [celestial] mists float,*
*I attain the primordial blue sky.*

In ancient times, when the **Celestial Worthy** (*Xūhuáng*) was about to expound the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*),
He convened a grand assembly and spoke this **scripture** (*jīng*) here.
At first, ascending the **Lion Throne** (*Shīzuò*), its tenfold circuit [of recitation]
Still allowed one to hear its teachings;
But once entering the **Grain of Millet** (*Shǔzhū*) [i.e., the profound mysteries],
A single true secret remains—
Who can truly discern it?

This is called the **symbol beyond symbols** (*xiàngwài zhī xiàng*),
The **essence within essences** (*yào shí xuánzhōng zhī xuán*).

Now, with awe, I follow the **Imperial Edict** (*Lún yīn*),
Devoutly observing the **Golden Talisman** (*Jīn lù*),
And extending the **auspicious fast** (*Yí zhāi*) for several days and nights.

Now, I lead the assembled officials,
Ascending the altar for the **fifth session** (*dìwǔ huì*),
To recite in rotation the **Supreme Scripture of Mysterious and Transcendent Treasures, the Precious Scripture for the Boundless Liberation of All Beings** (*Tàishàng Dòngxuān Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng*),
Pay homage to the **Precious Decrees** (*Bǎo guì*),
And with utmost reliance, turn to the **Incomparable Triple Jewel** (*Wúshàng Sānbǎo*—the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*), **Virtue/Power** (*Dé*), and **Scriptures** (*Jīng*)),
The **Compassionate Saints of the Ten Directions** (*Shífāng zhūtiān Dàshèng*),
And the **merciful vows of all beings** (*cíbēi yuànlì*),
To preside over the **meritorious work** (*jīnggōng*) of this **scripture** (*jīng*).

May it be that the **Purple Dawn’s** (*Zǐyáng*) hidden texts are revealed,
And the **Primordial Beginning’s** (*Yuánshǐ*) forbidden scriptures are unveiled.
May all beings be enlightened and illuminated,
And brilliance shine upon the ten thousand things!"

«The jade and coral chime resound,
Naturally forming the hollow sound of the void;
The Milky Way divides its chapters,
Piercingly revealing the colors of the boundless expanse.

All sentient beings, all aware,
See and hear it all.

With reverent obeisance, we take refuge,
And practice the scriptures' Dao/Way.

We spread our seats and chant,
Upon completion of the sutra, we dissolve our seats and chant,
And dedicate the merit.

Now, Your servant, with utmost respect,
Offers that all things—from creation’s end to its beginning—
Are governed by the **Kun** (*Gèn*) direction;
The five phases, in their birth and completion,
Ultimately return to the earthly element.

At the season of spring’s arrival,
The **vital qi** should surge and ascend.
For within, the **yang** is contained,
And without, the **yin**—here, they first harmonize in **Tai** (*Tài*).

Since life first took form and nature was borne,
What fear is there that it will not flourish and complete?

Your servant, having just led the assembled officials,
Ascended the platform for the fifth recitation of the *Boundless Liberation of All Beings* (*Tàishàng Dòngxuān Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng*),
Directly offers merit to the **Supreme Primordial Lord of the Dao/Way** (*Wújí Tàishàng Língbǎo Tiānzūn*) of the northeast,
The **Noble Lord of Purple Clarity and Descending Blessings** (*Zǐqīng Jiàngfú Tiānzūn*),
The **Primordial Azure Celestial Sovereign of the Northeast** (*Dōngběi Shǐqīng Fànqì Tiānzūn*),
The **Celestial Illumination Star Lord of the Primordial One and Purple Qi** (*Tiānyī Zǐqì Dàoyào Xīngzūn*),
The **Celestial Phoenix Star Lord of the Tail Constellation** (*Wěisù Tiānjī Xīngzūn*),
The **Celestial Star Lord of the Dipper Constellation at the Heavenly Ford** (*Jīsù Tiānjīn Xīngzūn*),
The **Celestial Star Lord of the Dipper Constellation at the Heavenly Temple** (*Dǒusù Tiānmìao Xīngzūn*),
The **Celestial Star Lord of the Ox Constellation and Heavenly Mechanism** (*Niúsù Tiānjī Xīngzūn*),
The **Divine Swallows of the Two Mansions of Chou and Yin** (*Chǒuyín Èr Guāng Huàngyàn Fēnyuè Lièwèi Xīngzūn*) and their constellations,
The **Noble Deities of the Two Mansions of Mo and Ji** (*Mójiè Èr Guāng Zūnshén*),
The **Supreme Primordial Great God of the Northeast** (*Dōngběi fāng Wújí Wúliàng Pǐn Zhìzhēn Dàshén*),
The **Long-Lived Celestial Sovereign of the Flying Immortals and the Great Saint of Boundless Liberation** (*Fēitiān Shénwáng Chángshēng Dàshèng Wúliàng Dùrén Zūn*),
The **Noble Deities of the Current Year Star and Auspicious Horse** (*Běnmìng Tàisuì Lùmǎ Zūnshén*),
And the **Divine Officials of the Purple Hall and the Celestial Constellations** (*Zǐtáng Shénshà Guānzhòng*),

As the **fasting platform** responds to the blessings of all true spirits.

We beseech that through the **merit and power of the sutra** (*jīnggōng yuànlì*),
Longevity and prosperity be extended,
And years of life be added and multiplied.

May the Five Stars align in harmony,
And the Nine Luminaries proceed in order! »

**Translation:**

The **Purple Qi** pours into the Dipper and Ox,
Auspicious omens descend to Earth’s treasure;
East Wei rides upon the Tail and Arrow,
Heroes ascend to supplement the Celestial Officials.

By doing good, a hundred blessings descend,
By establishing the Pole, the Five Auspicious Virtues unfold.

With reverence, I take refuge and chant in rotation.

**Hymn of Wisdom and Benevolence**
Learning the Dao begins with sincere faith,
Serving the Master as one’s closest kin.
Drawing inspiration from the Pure Void,
Diligently renewing each day.

While others remain unenlightened,
I shall not cross over alone.
Great vows demand great recompense,
The Mystic Virtue shall shine forth.

For deep sins of darkness,
Facing judgment like the turning wheel,
I humbly offer incense to the **Noble Sage of the Northeast**,
Proclaiming the **Sixfold Recitation of the Scripture**,
Burning the **Sacred Talismans of Propagation**.

With reverence, I declare:
Among the **Thirty-Six Heavens of the Nine Realms**, none surpasses the **True King, Great Emperor**;
The **Sixty-One Volumes of Liberation** all stem from the **Boundless Original Scripture**.

For though some may specialize in a single teaching,
Here, all are encompassed by the **One Vehicle’s essence**.

Practicing Dao and cultivating the Way,
Extraordinary merit is achieved.
Protecting the nation and bringing peace to the family,
The True Law is preserved.

For roots stretch deep, waves surge wide,
And great foundations bear vast branches.

Now, I humbly follow the Imperial Edict,
Reverently crafting the **Golden Talismans**,
Extending the **Great Auspicious Fast** for days and nights.

With the assembled officials, I ascend the platform,
For the **Sixth Recitation** of the *Supreme Daoist Scripture of the Mystic Treasure—Boundless Liberation, Supreme Grade, Marvelous Scripture*,
Paying homage to the **Sacred Edicts**,
Relying on the **Three Precious Ones of Supreme Compassion** and the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Saints**,
Their mercy and vows sustaining the merit of the scripture.

May Heaven open this Way,
And the Emperor guide the sincere.

Instantly grasp the profound meaning,
Joyfully aligning with the natural order;
Hearing the sacred words in six recitations,
Illuminated as if scales fall from the eyes.

Blessings extend to the realm and family,
Joy spreads to the borders and defenses.
Witnessing the gathered assembly of the Law,
The marvelous sounds resound with divine power.

With reverence, I bow to the **Celestial Sovereign**,
Practicing the scriptural teachings.

**Seated Chant:**
After reciting the scripture, I sing.

**Dissolving the Seat Chant: Returning the Merit**

With reverence, I now return the merit,
As the Six Chants call forth the southeast—
The *Xun* trigrams’ qi, harmonious and bright.

In time, it is summer’s first dawn,
When all things are pure and aligned;
In number, the waters complete,
Returning to the One, the source’s embrace.

Through supreme learning’s alchemical art,
The marvel lies in *Liquan*’s flowing grace—
Thus teeth regrow where once they fell,
As jade’s essence nourishes the *Cilia*’s core;
Hair darkens where it turned to silver,
As golden essence ascends to the elbow’s glow.

If one knows the Dao’s profound return,
Then the Way of divine transformation is known.

Now, having led the officials in chanting
The *Sixth Universal Recitation* of the
*Supreme Daoist Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure—
The Marvelous Scripture for Delivering Beings,*

I direct the merit to the southeast—
To the **Supreme Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Treasure**,
The **Celestial Sovereign of Longevity and Life-Preservation**,
The **Celestial Lord of Azure-Qi and Divine Breath**,
The **Star Lord of the Divine Tail and Falling Radiance**,
The **Star Lord of the Winged Constellation and Celestial Capital**,
The **Star Lord of the Imperial Enclosure and Heavenly Seat**,
The **Star Lord of the Chariot Constellation and Celestial Street**,
The **Star Lord of the Horn Constellation and Heavenly Gate**,
The **Star Lord of the Hyades and Celestial Court**,
The **Divine Lords of the *Chen* and *Yi* Mansions**,
The **Star Lords of the *Zheng* and *Chu* Lunar Divisions**,
The **Divine Lords of the *Tianping* and *Shuangnu* Mansions**,
The **Supreme Great God of Boundless Truth in the Southeast**,
The **Flying Heavenly King, the Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance**,
The **Lords of the Native Year and Auspicious Horse**,
The **Purple Hall Star Gods and Official Spirits**,
And all responsive true spirits of the Three Realms.

I pray that through the merit and power of the scripture,
The southeast’s **Longevity Star in the Quail’s Tail** may be pacified,
Extending blessings and auspicious signs,
Increasing years and refining fate.

May the Three Lights shine forth,
And the Five Constants return to harmony.

The **Dragon’s Horn** mansion—when the Dipper’s handle brightens, it heralds auspicious signs;
Within the **Quail’s Tail**, when the stars disperse in order, they form the foundation of blessings.

With bowed reverence, I take refuge and turn to chant in praise.

**Ode to Wisdom and Enlightenment**
Learning the Dao is indeed arduous,
Yet morning and evening, one cultivates the Field of Merit.
Planting virtue is like nurturing trees—
Layer by layer, it grows into mountains.
If one can dwell upon the Mysterious and Lofty,
Then like a breeze, one ascends to the Azure Sky.
Practicing this Dao of Non-Action,
One forever binds ties with the Good.

This is the *Supreme Most Hidden Scripture*,
Named the *Chapter of Wisdom*.

A land’s prosperity stems from great talent,
Ascending beyond the mundane to attain immortality.
A divine form, rare in the world,
Resplendent as a lotus in the depths.

**Highest Merit to the Southeast—Reverently Declared**
With solemn incense, I proclaim the sacred scriptures,
Sevenfold recitation of the opened text.
With humble reverence, I present the *Lingbao Original Chapter*,
The *Secret Canon of the Mysterious Capital*.

When its five sections unfold,
They possess the power to pacify Heaven and stabilize Earth;
When its ten thousand precepts are revealed,
They hold the force to guide the cosmic flow and govern the age.

Why then is this scripture named *Degree of People*?
Is it not because humans are the most refined of all things,
And thus the ruler must be the sovereign of all under Heaven?
Humans are the most noble of the Three Powers—
Without them, how could one perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth?
Thus, its name is fitting, and its analogy profound.

Now, I humbly follow Your edict,
Reverently crafting the Golden Talismans,
And extend the Grand Auspicious Fast for days and nights.

Now, I lead the assembled spirits,
Ascending the platform for the seventh recitation of the
*Supreme Most Daoist *Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture of Boundless Degree of People*,
The Supreme Excellent Scripture*,
Paying homage to the sacred decrees,
And relying upon the boundless compassion of the Supreme Three Jewels,
The Ten Directions’ Celestial Saints,
Their mercy and vows—
May the merit of the scripture prevail.

I pray that the Dao’s transformation may flourish,
And the Mysterious Wind be greatly revived.
May those lost in obscurity and confusion
Eventually resonate with the profound and subtle blessings.
May the nation’s destiny be steadfast and secure,
And blessings and auspicious signs be granted.
What is wished for is obtained without seeking.

On the platform, the assembled ritualists
Resound with the sacred, resonant sounds of the law.
With bowed reverence to the Celestial Sovereign,
I practice the scriptural methods.

**Seated Chant**
Having completed the recitation of the scripture.

**Dismounting Chant**
**Transfer of Merit**

With reverence, I nourish the Earth with offerings,
And return my form to the soil.

The Great Fire is forged from the Seven Qi,
While the spirit is nourished by the Heart Sovereign.

Within, I refine the method of cultivating qi,
Without, I exhaust the art of nourishing the body.
When I strike the drum, my hair turns youthful and my teeth grow firm—
Then transform into a crimson visage.
Though my bones were weak and sinews soft,
Now I stand with robust strength.

Indeed, the scripture’s singular effects
Are but the same benevolence of the Sage’s transformation.

Just now, I led the officials in ascending the platform,
Reciting the *Supreme Dao/Way’s Mysterious Treasure of Boundless Salvation for Humans—The Supreme Scripture* in its seventh cycle.
Directly, I transfer merit to:

The **Supreme Soul Treasure Celestial Venerable of the Boundless Southwest**,
The **Celestial Venerable of Boundless Blessing in the Southwest**,
The **Primordial White Dao/Way’s Celestial Qi Sovereign**,
The **Celestial Enclosure Imperial Seat Star Sovereign**,
The **Great Unity Moon’s Dark Luminous Star Sovereign**,
The **Tianxiù Celestial Screen Star Sovereign**,
The **Shen宿 Celestial Water Star Sovereign**,
The **Jing宿 Celestial Well Star Sovereign**,
The **Gui宿 Celestial Feast Star Sovereign**,
The **Shen-Wei Two Mansions Venerable Deities**,
The **Supreme Most True Great God of the Boundless Southwest**,
The **Flying Heaven Divine King of Longevity, the Great Sage of Boundless Salvation**,
The **Native Star Year’s Auspicious Horse Venerable Deity**,
The **Purple Hall Spirit Officials and Attendants**,
And all responsive true spirits of the Three Realms.

I beseech that through the merit and vow of the scripture,
The **Quèwěi constellation** in the southwest may be steadied,
Life preserved and years extended,
Auspicious omens welcomed and blessings gathered.

May I pray that auspicious signs illuminate the celestial realm,
Their light shining upon the human world.

The **Celestial Well** guards the **Feast** and the **Room**,
Following the **Dao**’s course through the star degrees;
The **Beak** and **Three Stars** govern the **Big Dipper**,
Wondrously revolving at the **Heavenly Pass**.

Auspicious blessings pair in the **Command Palace**,
Noble fortunes ever uphold the **Destiny Limit**.

With bowed head, I take refuge and turn to chant.
The **Wisdom Praise** speaks:
*"Each person’s path has its root,
All born of past-life merit.
Establish virtue while time allows,
Speak vows—none shall be denied.
Good and evil await their turn,
Rise and fall by logic’s unseen depth.
The worthy scholar follows the **Dao**’s words,
Yet the **Way** itself lies in forgetting all."*

This is the **Great Wisdom**—
To the **Supreme Ultimate Sage** above,
A **Jade-Covered Chariot** links with the **Celestial Carriage**,
Commanding the **Nine Dragons** in procession.
**Gold and leather** bear the **Sacred Scripture**,
Youthful immortals present the fragrant incense.

Songs and melodies resound in the **Mysterious Capital**,
Jade chimes strike the **Lapis Lazuli Bell**.

With solemn rites to the **Southwest**,
I humbly proclaim and solemnly declare:
*"The **Sacred Text** is opened wide—
Though it embodies the **Boundless Salvation** of the **Great Sage**,
The **Inner Dao** of the **Immortal Way** holds the **Divine Transformation**’s power.
Since the **Five-Zhang Pearl** hangs high in its celestial court,
It already contains the **Nine Refinements** of **Gold and Mercury**’s alchemy.
When the sun and moon pause their light,
It is the silent, luminous hour;
When mountains hide their clouds,
It is the breath’s slow, endless flow."*

The **Three Corpses** perish, and the **Three Realms** stand guard;
The **Five Qi** are refined, and the **Five Emperors** await their welcome.

When the **Mysterious Pearl** elixir is perfected,
The **Sage’s** sacred work is complete—
The **Golden Chamber** grants passage to the **Celestial Gate**,
And the **Jade Tablets** record the name for the **Jade Capital’s** feasts.

Now I drink the **Imperial Edict’s** decree,
Reverently crafting the **Golden Talismans**,
Extending the **Auspicious Fast** for days and nights.

I lead the **official assembly**,
Ascending the platform for the **eighth circuit** of recitation—
The *Supreme Dao/Way’s **Mysterious Treasure Soul-Jewel Sutra of Boundless Salvation***,
Bowing to the **Sacred Edicts**, relying on the **Supreme Triple Jewel’s** merciful sovereign,
The **Ten Directions’** great sages—
Their compassionate vows sustain the **Sutra’s** power.

Humbly, I pray to ride the **Three Pure Ones’** clouds,
To bear the **Nine-Luminous** effigy upon my neck.
The **Black Tortoise and Hare** dwell in unity within one chamber,
While the **Lion and Crane** stand guard in the four quarters.

Now, with mouth reciting and heart contemplating,
We enter the **Great Measure’s** profound depths;
Divine communion and intuitive understanding
Awaken the **Ultimate Stillness’s** boundless mechanism.

May all sentient beings equally attain **unerring enlightenment**,
And the **congregation of the Law** resound with **mystic harmonies**.

With deepest reverence to the **Void Sovereign**,
We practice the **Sutra’s** sacred method.

The **Seat is spread**—
The **Sutra** is chanted to its close.

**Dissolving the Seat and Turning Merit**

With reverence, I align my heart with Heaven and Earth’s nurturing of all life—
My merit complete, I do not rule over them.
The **Lingbao** teaches salvation for all beings, its Dao boundless in its reach.
Thus, the **Sutra’s** power circles the eight extremes,
Its patterns mirroring the **Primordial Dao’s** singular transformation.

Each now upright in **nature and fate**,
All shall equally attain **birth and fulfillment**.
From high to low, from vast to minute—
Form and hue arise without division;
Conceived in womb, egg, or damp—
None perish, none decay—what cause for worry?
Divine wonders! The **Mystic Virtue** is vast indeed.

Now, I lead the officials and congregation,
Ascending the platform to recite the **Supreme Dao’s *Lingbao Scripture of Boundless Salvation for All Beings, Supreme Grade of Wondrous Perfection***—
The **Eighth Chapter**—
And turn its merit toward:
The **Supreme Lingbao Sovereign of the Boundless** in the **Western-Northern Quarter**,
The **Nine-Palace Guardian Sovereigns of the Western-Northern Quarter**,
The **Primordial Mystic Dao’s Celestial Qi Sovereign**,
The **Celestial Enclosure Emperor’s Star Sovereign**,
The **Divine-Headed Luo**’s **Radiant Star Sovereign**,
The **Xiù Constellation’s Heavenly Granary Star Sovereign**,
The **Bì Constellation’s Heavenly Market Star Sovereign**,
The **Kuí Constellation’s Heavenly Marshal Star Sovereign**,
The **Lóu Constellation’s Heavenly Prison Star Sovereign**,
The **Xū and Hài Constellations’ Ru and Wei Star Sovereigns of the Two Palaces**,
The **Emperor Gods of the White Ram and Pisces Constellations**,
The **Supreme Most True Great God of the Boundless Western-Northern Quarter**,
The **Flying Heaven Divine King, Long-Living Great Sage of Boundless Salvation**,
The **Native Year Star and Luck-Horse Sovereign Gods**,
The **Purple Hall Spirit Officials and the Assembly of the Ritual Platform**—
All responsive celestial spirits.

I beseech, through the **Sutra’s** merit and my vows,
To pacify the **Western-Northern Quarter**,
To descend upon the **Lóu and Chī**’s abodes,
To preserve life and extend years,
To invite auspiciousness and bring blessings.

May the **Divine Talismans** settle the **Ru and Wei** divisions,
May the **Celestial Patterns** brighten the **Kuí and Bì** stars.
Within the **Star Constellations of fate**,
Let auspicious omens ever flourish;
In the **years, months, days, and hours of adversity**,
Let all transform into **prosperity and rectitude**.
Whatever is guarded by **action** shall be without calamity or harm.

With deepest reverence, I take refuge and turn to chant praise.

**Ode of Wisdom**

My body soars beyond the **Great Void**,
Ascending the **Purple Clarity** in boundless ease.
I uphold the **Primordial Essence**, the **Law’s** unyielding thread,
Wandering the **Mystic Peak** in carefree flight.
Ten thousand kalpas pass like yesterday’s night,
A thousand springs unfold like morning’s dawn.
Towering clouds shade my **Lingbao** grove,
My hand grasps the **Treasure Forest’s** boughs.
Incense smoke arises naturally,
The **Mystic Stairs** stir the **Whirling Ascension**.
The **Divine Banners** ride the wind’s command,
Dissolving all fleeting thoughts in their wake.
Extinguishing **worldly wisdom**, I expand the **Great Unity**,
In **Non-Action**, I sing the **Pure Song**.

**Humbly Declared to the Western-Northern Quarter**—
**Proclaimed and Recorded for the Sacred Offerings**.

**The Threefold Hearings of the Sutra—
Taking the Vow, Rekindling the Furnace, Descending the Altar,
Offering Thanks to the Master, Returning in Circle,
Reciting the Golden Arrow Ten Times to Liberate Beings.**

**At noon, the grand ritual concludes.**
