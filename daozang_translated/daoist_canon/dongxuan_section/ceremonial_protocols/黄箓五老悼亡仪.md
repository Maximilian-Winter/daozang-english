**Yellow Talisman Five Elders' Rite for Comforting the Departed**

**Title:** *Yellow Talisman Five Elders' Rite for Comforting the Departed*
**One scroll.** Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Tongxuan Section* (洞玄部), *Rites of Dignity Category* (威仪类).

**Ritual Procedure as Prescribed:**

Humbly acknowledging that the **Dao/Way** of the **Mixing of the Primordial** (混元) was yet undivided,
and that the **One Qi** (一气) was established as the first principle;
when the **Great Polarity** (太极) was already manifest,
it paired with the **Three Talents** (三才) to stand in mutual harmony.
From this arose the **Three Existences** (三生) and myriad beings,
with the **Five Extremes** (五极) dwelling at the center.
The **Five Directions** (五方) were set in place,
and the **Five Qi** (五炁) were apportioned by number.
The heavens bear the **Five Stars** (五星) in orderly array to illuminate,
while the earth holds the **Five Sacred Mountains** (五岳) to govern and oversee.
The **Nine Palaces Diagram** (九宫之图) is laid out in all its breadth,
and the **Two Complementaries** (两仪) appear in their generated forms.

Only the **Five Elders** (五老) hold fast to their appointed stations,
and align with the **One Qi** in their shared origin.
Reverently invoking the **Three Pure Ones** (三清),
their boundless compassion extends across countless **kalpas** (万劫).
They rescue and guide all beings,
and deliver the departed souls from suffering.
Those who honor this rite shall be born in heaven,
and those who hear it shall extinguish their sins.

Now, on this day of the **Xin** (辰) hour, I humbly offer this **Rite for Comforting the Departed** (悼亡仪)
for the soul of the late **Mr./Mrs. [Name]** (亡过某),
who early fell into the **Five Turbidities** (五浊之境) of existence,
and did not yet comprehend the **emptiness of the Five Aggregates** (五蕴之空).
With ears attuned to the **Five Sounds** (五音),
and tongue indulging the **Five Flavors** (五味),
the eyes were drawn to the **Five Colors** (五色),
yet unaware of the entanglements they brought;
the body was ensnared by the **Five Desires** (五欲),
and thus fell into self-inflicted **obscuration** (昏迷).
How could they know that the **Five Phases** (五行) would eventually come to an end,
and that they would follow the **Five Sufferings** (五苦) into the realm of evil?

Now, I raise the **Sage’s Auspicious Title** (睿号),
and proclaim the **Sacred Scriptures** (秘文).
Like shadows following forms,
I repent in accordance with the **Five Directions** (方).
Relying upon the **Dharma Assembly** (法众),
and with hearts united in **compassion** (慈悲),
I offer this **Rite of Repentance** (忏悔) for the departed,
with utmost sincerity and devotion.

**Action:** Each participant reverently bows and pays respects according to their station.
