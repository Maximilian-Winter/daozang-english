**Ritual Text for the Venerable Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation True Lord**
The ritual proceeds according to form.

We have heard that divine immortals may be summoned, but this depends upon utmost sincerity. When purification and abstinence are solemnly observed, blessings naturally follow. How fortunate that the Great Dao, though hidden in humble abodes, grants the common people refuge in their fragile lives.

With reverence, we recall the Most High Lord of the Nine Provinces, Celestial Master, Illustrious Envoy, and True Lord of Mysterious Response, Divine Merit, and Wondrous Salvation. His heart merges with the wondrous Dao, and his person grasps the primordial chart. Proficient in the celestial patterns of astronomy and the harmonies of pitch-pipes, he penetrates the principles of primordial truth, yin and yang. He eradicates demons and banishes calamities to safeguard households and states; he inscribes talismans and dispenses medicine to revive the dead and restore the flesh. Laying down his bow and breaking his arrows, he awakened to the harm of taking life; transmuting stone into gold, he grieved over the loss of original nature. He never practiced deceptive illusions to delude others, but devoted himself to the compassionate heart of saving all beings. His towering virtue rivals heaven, and his radiant merits defy description.

Today, we, [Name], devoutly follow the immortal’s model, earnestly cultivating sincerity. We burn fragrant dragon’s spittle incense to welcome the soaring crane-drawn chariot. May his divine merit swiftly manifest, and his sagely transformation swiftly arrive. Treading through colored mists and bearing vermilion banners, may he briefly depart the sublime realm of the Western Mountains; riding the pure wind, descending to this humble abode, to witness our sincere devotion from the north.

We, the assembly, take refuge and wholeheartedly praise and worship.

**Invocation of the Most Pure and Perfect Heavenly Worthy**
With wholehearted devotion, we bow in homage to the Three Treasures—Celestial Treasure, Numinous Treasure, and Divine Treasure—and to the Three Clarities: Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Great Clarity. One qi flows into form, and the Three Honored Ones respond to the world. Radiant yet silent, they speak not yet command the four seasons; pointing to form and emptiness, they act not yet transform and generate the Three Luminaries.

Homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Clarities and Three Realms, dwelling in the Palace of Golden Towers within the Great Primordial Heaven.

With wholehearted devotion, we bow in homage to the distant Purple-Golden Towers and the towering Azure Jade Palace.

They set in motion the mechanism of creation and transformation, and wield the handle of life and death.

His wisdom and sagacity crowned all within the mortal realm, and the people to this day reap his beneficence.
