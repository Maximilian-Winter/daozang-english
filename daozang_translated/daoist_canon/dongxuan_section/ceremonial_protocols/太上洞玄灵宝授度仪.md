**Memorial on the *Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Ordination Rites***

Your servant Xiujing, abiding in the utmost Dao and reverently awaiting the numinous scriptures, has never forgotten them even in haste. By fortunate coincidence, one of humble grass and thatch has been permitted to peruse the dragon-and-phoenix chapters. The profound and august majesty is beyond what I can bear; my heart is filled with both joy and fear, like ice and fire.

Since presumptuously receiving these teachings seventeen years ago, I have devoted all sincerity and thought to upholding and studying them, immersing myself in the divine texts and savoring their mysterious essence. With mind fixed and eyes intent, I have striven for mastery, holding fast to my resolve and exerting myself day and night without respite. Through careful examination of what I have received, I have roughly attained a comprehensive understanding. I feel my spirit awakened and my mind enlightened, gradually grasping the principles and their return to the source. The subtle meanings and wondrous subtleties are inherently beyond my reach, yet the coarse traces and proximate purport may be faintly glimpsed.

I humbly observe that the great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure descends to deliver humanity. The ancient catalog of its arcane regulations comprises thirty-six fascicles. Its talismans and diagrams arise naturally from emptiness, and its eulogies and explanations are inscribed by the highest perfected ones. It is the path by which immortals and sages ascend, the guiding norm across kalpas. Its language is wondrously elegant and august; its matters are truly essential and profoundly subtle. Its words are pure, empty, mysterious, and refined; its principles are deep, abstruse, and boundless. It clarifies the distinctions between sin and blessing, adapts its methods to circumstances, and provides precepts, regulations, and rituals to guide all directions. Its numinous sounds resonate in eight directions, opening the ears of the deaf and the eyes of the blind. Its Dharma gates extend in four directions, accommodating both the great and the small. Its vast transformation is immeasurable, like an infinite bridge of Dharma.

Yet when the true teaching first arose, the celestial scriptures were treasured and revered. The profound store of the Great Existence was not fully revealed. However, among the scriptures now extant—those transmitted from the Primordial Beginning and those received by the Perfected Lords—thirty-five fascicles that I have verified are complete, with roots and branches, exterior and interior, mutually supporting one another. The body of the Great Vehicle is amply provided for.

Yet for the ordination rites, only two memorials exist. There are no established forms for petitions, memorials, or invocations. When the sages transmit the Dharma, the celestial perfected ones are arrayed in full, and there is no need for the cumbersome invocation of names. But in this defiled and turbid world below, divine officials must be moved to respond. Without complete regulations, the foolish are left without guidance.

Since the Numinous Treasure began guiding the world, those who have transmitted it have sometimes conferred the Three Caverns together, sharing the same altar and covenant. The refined and the coarse are intermingled, the great and the small are confounded. At times, one receives only the Cavern Mystery, yet employs the rites of the higher Dharma. Proclamations and summonses are misapplied, with no proper authority to oversee them. Some borrow from the lower paths of the Yellow and Red Officials, descending to the base and vulgar, forcing what is inappropriate, causing inversion and chaos. They fail to adhere to proper forms, deviate from the hidden classics, and mislead later disciples.

I sigh over this morning and night, my heart aching as if weeping blood. Yet the true teachers are distant and unattainable, and I cannot hope to seek them out. The worldly teachings lack these texts, and the urgent need for them demands fulfillment. Thus, I dare, in my ignorance, to consult the *Golden and Yellow Registers*, the *Luminous Perfected Jade Instructions*, and the *Instructions on the Scripture of the True One’s Spontaneity*. Following the models of the myriad perfected sages who conferred ordination, I have compiled rites for the assembly of the divine officials of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences at the altar for the covenant oath, establishing a complete set of ritual procedures.

Yet these matters are profoundly abstruse and utterly transcendent, beyond the measure of mortal eyes. The affairs of the divine are subtle—how could a corpse-like fool comprehend them? My hand trembles as I write, my body and soul both unraveling. I fear that errors may incur guilt, and that my creation may invite punishment. Hesitant and apprehensive, I tread as if upon blades and poison.

Though the compilation is complete, I dare not presume to use it. I have purified myself and observed a fast before the Three Treasures, reciting it once through. I humbly beseech the Supreme Ones, the myriad venerables, and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center to deign to inspect and examine my submission. If there is even the slightest merit in it, I beg that it be permitted for use. If it is not acceptable, I shall promptly destroy it. Whether it is fitting or not must be determined by numinous signs. I earnestly pray for a response, awaiting a manifestation. With reverence, I submit this.

Your servant Xiujing, with utmost trepidation and awe, bows twice and respectfully reports.

Your servant Lu Xiujing respectfully presents this.

**The *Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Ordination Rites***

The *Yellow Register’s Brief Text on the Ranks of Transcendent Immortals* states: When receiving the scriptures and Dharma, one should initiate nineteen disciples for the Three Masters, establishing merit and virtue so that their names are recorded in the heavens. Only then may they ascend the altar to swear the covenant, receive the *True Writ of the Five Elders in Red Script and Jade Chapters*, the *Twenty-Four Perfected of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences*, and the offices of the celestial transcendent riders and highest perfected ones. Those who receive the great Dharma without having established merit and fame will be seized by the Three Officials, facing bitter retribution in life and death, and will be examined by the Court of Illuminating Dharma.

The *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: The covenant requires 24,000 gold coins as a pledge to the twenty-four qi-generating officials. If this solemn pledge is lacking, the gods of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences will not register the disciple’s name in the ledgers of life. If gold is unavailable, copper may be used as a substitute. If entirely lacking, the case falls under the jurisdiction of the General Divine Court.

The *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Five taels of highest-grade gold are used to swear an oath with the Five Marchmounts as a pledge for the precious scriptures. The *Jade Instructions* state: Nine taels of highest-grade gold are used to swear an oath with the Nine Heavens. If lacking, one incurs the penalty for disrespecting the scriptures. The numinous mountains of the Five Marchmounts will not register the disciple’s name in the ledgers of learning, and the case falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of Yin Officials.

The *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Forty feet of figured silk from each of the five directions are used to invoke the Five Emperors as a pledge for the oath. If lacking, the Five Emperors will not accept the disciple’s name, and the demon kings of the Five Emperors will harm them, causing their aspirations and thoughts to waver. The case falls under the jurisdiction of the Water Officials and the Court of the Springs and Bends.

The *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Three gold dragons and three gold buttons are cast into mountains, waters, and earth as a pledge for learning transcendence. If these are not offered, the Three Officials will seize the disciple’s name in the ledgers of life, and their prayers will not be answered. Violations fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of the Nine Capitals.

*The Jade Instructions* state: Five feet of crimson-patterned silk from Nanhe—crimson-figured silk—is torn to serve as a cloth upon the altar table, upon which the *Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure True Writ* and the Five Talismans are invoked.

*The Jade Instructions* state: Five feet of azure silk from Bilin—blue-figured silk—is cut to serve as a cloth to cover the True Writ and talismans.

*The Jade Instructions* state: The True Writ and Five Talismans are placed between the crimson and azure silks, forming the covenant of tonsure and blood-oath. The azure silk substitutes for hair, the crimson for the blood-oath pledge; thus the perfected ones avoid harming their spirit and diminishing their virtue, and so these are used in their stead.

*The Jade Instructions* state: Five blended incenses—though the scripture does not specify the quantity—are customarily measured as two *dou* and five *sheng*. Additionally, one *dou* of five-colored mixed flowers is required, to be scattered in the ten directions during the perfected one’s transmission of the precepts. Five large mats, a seven-patterned altar table, five incense burners with lidded boxes, and a length of life-bestowing silk corresponding to the disciple’s age in *chi* are also needed.

The eight items listed above are used as pledges for the altar rites and oaths.

*The Jade Instructions* state: In spring, the rites are performed on *jiayin* and *yimao* days; in summer, on *dingsi* and *bingwu* days; during the four seasons, on *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jiwei*, and *jichou* days; in autumn, on *gengshen* and *xinyou* days; and in winter, on *guihai* and *renzi* days. The rites are conducted on the days of the establishing *wang* phase.

*The Jade Instructions* state: A high altar is constructed upon the sacred peaks, enclosed with railings on four sides. Five gates are opened to the east, west, south, and north, each marked with a placard bearing the following inscriptions:

**Azure Heaven of the Nine Qi**
*Anbao Hualin Qingling Shilao Jun, Cangdi Jun, Jiuqi Qingya Tianjun, Taishang Zhenyu Qingyao Yunü, Dongxiang Zhulingguan.*
**Gate of Primordial Azure Radiance.**
Inscribed in azure on a crimson ground, placed above the eastern gate.

**Cinnabar Heaven of the Three Qi**
*Fanbao Changyang Danling Zhenlao Jun, Chidi Jun, Zhudan Sanqi Tianjun, Yuanqi Zhangren, Zhugong Taidan Yunü, Nanxiang Zhulingguan.*
**Gate of Grand Yang and Great Light.**
Inscribed in crimson on a yellow ground, placed above the southern gate.

**Primordial Cavern of the Great Emperor**
*Tianyu Baoyuan Lingyuan Laojun, Taidi Zhenren, Zidan Huangting Wuji Tian Cang Yunü, Zhonghuang Dadi Guan Jun.*
**Gate of Primordial Yellow and Lofty Dawn.**
Inscribed in yellow on a white ground, placed above the central gate.

**Golden Gate of the Seven Qi of White Heaven**
*Qibao Jinmen Haoling Huanglao Jun, Baidi Jun, Mingshi Qiqi Dafu, Taishang Baisu Yunü, Xixiang Zhulingguan.*
**Gate of Penetrating Yin and the Golden Portal.**
Inscribed in white on a black ground, placed above the western gate.

**Mystic Heaven of the Five Qi**
*Dongyin Shuojue Wuling Xuanlao Jun, Heidi Jun, Xuanzhi Wuqi Tianjun, Taishang Lingjun, Yeguang Yunü, Beixiang Zhulingguan.*
**Gate of Yin’s Birth and Vast Spirit.**
Inscribed in black on an azure ground, placed above the northern gate.

**Primordial Yellow and Lofty Dawn Gate**
All spirits of the Nine Heavens, perfected ones of the Five Peaks and sacred mountains, the Three Officials of the Four Seas and Nine Bureaus, all earthbound immortals, jade maidens, flying immortals of the Five Peaks, and all divine immortals and lords.
Inscribed in purple on a yellow ground, placed to the left of the central gate.

To the right, six plaques are affixed above the five gates—one plaque each for the eastern, western, southern, and northern gates, positioned according to their directions. Above the central gate, the symbols for *wu* and *ji* are displayed, while the two plaques of the Nine Heavens are placed to the left and right of the gate. Five incense burners are arranged within the altar. Beneath the five tables, five-colored silken banners corresponding to the five directions are laid out. An additional table is set in the center of the altar to receive the *True Writings of the Five Talismans* and scriptures. Another table is prepared for submitting memorials and conducting rituals, making a total of seven tables. Gold and coin offerings are arrayed before the ritual table.

The *Yellow Register Simplified Writings* states: Those who receive the teachings must adhere to the luminous statutes, present their credentials to the master, and observe a seven-day fast. They shall submit a memorial on yellow silk, petitioning the heavens for the sacred texts. The altar is exposed to the open air for one night; if no wind stirs and the writings remain unshaken, the candidate’s bone-name aligns with the Dao, and the transmission may proceed after the oath. If the wind disturbs the writings, the candidate must retreat and fast for three more days, then repeat the ritual as before. Should the wind disrupt the proceedings three times, and the candidate lacks a predestined name or virtuous merit, the Three Realms will not acknowledge them, the Five Emperors will not protect them, their bone-*qi* will not harmonize, and the teachings must not be lightly transmitted. This is examined and verified by the Bureau of Rectification.

For the great oath of the *Numinous Treasure* and the overnight exposure of the true writings, the order of submitting memorials and exiting the official precincts is as follows:

Once the altar is established in the sacred mountain site, the master and disciple enter together through the earthly gate, circling left. The master enters the inner altar’s royal gate, facing north to offer incense three times. First, the two registers of true writings received by the disciple are placed upon the table. The disciple proceeds to the outer altar, faces south, turns north, and bows three times, prostrating to present the memorial. The master sounds the celestial drum thirty-six times. Next, the incense burner is kindled according to ritual, followed by the exit from the official precinct.

With reverence, the five bodily *zhen* officials and *gongcao* officers within your servant’s person emerge; the three caverns’ flying immortals within your servant’s person emerge—ascending to the Three Heavens, the enforcers of the Dao and transformers of yin and yang, the *gongcao* officers who deliver the Dao and dispel calamities, disperse misfortunes, and resolve adversities—each in groups of eleven. The high perfected officials and governing officers within your servant’s person, the *Jianjie Jian’gong* Great General of the established banner, the *Xiaogong* officers of the vanguard and *Xiaosha* officers of the rearguard, the *Yiting* Commandant and *Yiting* Aide, the four divisions’ *Jiangong* inspectors and *Yezhe* heralds, the immortal and numinous *Zhishi* envoys within your servant’s person, the *Zhengyi Gongcao*, the *Zhibing Gongcao*, the left and right *Guanshizhe*, the yin-yang divine adjudicators, the *Keche Chifu* officers, the *Gangfeng Qizhi* couriers bearing memorials—each in pairs—emerge. Those who emerge don their solemn regalia, robes, and pendent tassels, arraying their majestic presence.

The *Zhishi Gongcao* wears the *Tongtian* crown and a black single-layered robe; the *Zhengyi Gongcao* dons the *Zhuyang* turban and a crimson single-layered robe; the envoys wear the *Jiude* crown and five-colored longevity robes, girded with tiger tallies, bearing on the left a *Liujin* fire bell and on the right the *Huoluo Qiyuan*, each holding a jade tablet. The *Zhishi Gongcao* stands at the center; the *Zhibing Gongcao* guards your servant’s person; the left *Guanshizhe* holds the banner in front; the right *Guanshizhe* raises the standard behind; the yang divine adjudicator stands to the left; the yin divine adjudicator stands to the right; the upper division *Gongcao* gazes afar toward the heavens; the middle division *Gongcao* surveys the eight directions; the *Cuqi Gongcao* urges the ten directions; the *Du Guan Shizhe* encircles your servant’s person.

The *Lang* officers and tiger warriors, the *Chajian Qiji* inspectors of the capital bureau, the celestial armored soldiers, the *Tianding* warriors, the *Shouqi Shiqi* officers, the *Shoushen Shishen* officers, the *Shougui Shigui* officers, the *Shoujing Shijing* officers, the *Shoudu Shidu* officers, the *Shouxie Shixie* officers, the *Zhufu Pomiao* officers, the *Keche Chifu* officers, the *Gangfeng Qizhi* couriers bearing memorials, the *Feilong* cavalry officers, and the garrisoned officers stand before and behind your servants.

Once the left and right *Gongcao* envoys have completed their solemn preparations, they array the ceremonial regalia, summoning the officials of the *Numinous Treasure* bureau, the *Jianzhai* immortal kings, the *Dianjing* attendants, the *Weiling* marshals, the various lords, officers, and generals of the Three Caverns, the twenty-four *zhi* established by the Celestial Master, the thirty-six *jing* hermitages, the seventy-two blessed lands, the three hundred sixty renowned mountains including Kunlun, and the over thirty-six thousand celestial officials of the upper realms—along with the sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the *Xuanji* and *Yuheng*; the Five Thearchs of Heaven and Earth; the officials, lords, generals, and officers of the Three Realms; the *Erxuan Sanyuan Sishi* of the Dao; the *Fengqi Zhuqi Jiazi* officials of the four directions and orientations; the summoned *Lao* Lords of the Eastern Nine Yi Hu, the Southern Eight Man Yue, the Western Six Rong Shi, the Northern Five Di Qiang, and the Central Three Qin Cang; the lords of the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, hills, and marshes; the *Mengzhang* of the myriad temples in high mountains and low valleys, the Twelve Stream Women, and the original land deities of root and origin; and the officers of the altars and soil—all at once don their solemn regalia and, together with the *Gongcao* envoys and *Feilong* cavalry officers within your servant’s person, ascend to address the *Taishang Xuanyuan Taishang Da Daojun*, the *Taishang Laojun*, the *Taishang Zhangren*, the *Wushang Xuanlao*, the *Tianzun* of the Ten Directions and Boundless Dao, the myriad sagely and virtuous hosts, the *Zhizhen* Great Emperors, the Celestial Thearchs, the Celestial Masters, the Female Masters, the Three Master Lords, and the Ladies of their courts.

The twelve scribal attendants handling documents proceed in order, following the memorial’s protocol. Your servant, having reverently received the *Lingbao* Great Dharma, the numinous true writings, the two registers of the *Bajing Neiyin*, and the yellow silk memorial, now places them upon the jade table for perusal.

The exit from the official precinct is complete. Next, the memorial is read aloud.

Next, the solemn charge is reiterated.

The true officials of your servant’s five bodily constituents, one minor attendant, and the twelve scribal aides are again commanded to array themselves in full regalia, donning caps and pendent tassels, and to promptly bear your servant’s memorial of true scriptural compositions upward to the *Taishang* court, presenting it in due order. Should any character be miswritten, let it be corrected; should any be omitted, let it be supplied. If words are transposed or disordered, they must be sought out and rectified, ensuring all accords with the highest standard, that no superior office may reject or reprimand. Let the demonic hosts of the Six Heavens and the stagnant *qi* of subordinate offices be severed and intercepted, the memorial distinguished and transmitted, and the report conveyed upward in timely fashion. Await the response in reverence.

Next, rise and face north, striking the teeth nine times, and invoke:

O Exalted Primordial Origin, Numinous Honored One of the Nine Heavens,
Supreme Perfected of the Mysterious Beyond, Jade Pavilion of the Dao’s Depths,
As the Three and Five revolve their courses, the Seven Luminaries alter their dawn,
The Void Thearch reins in the reins, the Five Emperors ordain transcendence.
The Azure Palace gathers the verdant, the talismanic mandate issues from the Numinous Mountain.
On this day of primal felicity, the myriad perfected open their ranks.
The advanced disciples of the cyclical signs *jia* and *yi*,
Bound by karmic affinity from former lives,
Have encountered the divine scriptures, the precious chapters of the August Sovereign.
Reverently, upon the Mystic Peak, they pledge alliance to the Nine Heavens,
Proclaiming below to the Five Emperors and the Twelve River Sources.
Beseeching registration and receipt, they memorialize the exalted court,
Universally notifying the ten thousand numina.
Arrayed in ranks upon the imperial altar,
They marshal and guard the majestic rites, adhering to the standards of the Supreme Perfected.
Await the transmission of the dawn’s initiation.

Next, the officials are dismissed. The *gongcao* messengers within your servant’s person, the generals and soldiers of the register, and the officials of the memorial’s presentation, having fulfilled their duties, return into your servant’s body. Those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right, securely abiding within the Nine Palaces and Six Treasuries, the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber, and the Twelve Passes and Mechanisms. They coil about the body and entwine the bones, traversing and safeguarding the hundred vessels. Should any overseer be charged with protecting your servant’s person, let the *gongcao* dispatch them in proper sequence, ensuring no error or confusion, until your servant summons them forth again, whereupon they shall act in accordance with precedent.

Sound the ritual drum three times, and swallow the *qi* thrice.

Next, rise and bow twice, then replenish the incense burner as prescribed.

When complete, the master and disciples exit through the Earth Gate. The next day, ascend the altar to perform the great alliance rites in proper sequence.

At dawn, declare the completion of the merit. If the disciples are numerous, alter the altar as before. Use six placards, placing them upon the five gates: one each at the eastern, southern, western, and northern gates according to their positions, and two placards—*wuji* and *jiutian*—at the central gate, affixed to its left and right.

The formula states: The Central Gate lies below the main gate at the *ji* position, as in spring at *chou*; the Gate of the Multitudinous Perfected lies above the main gate at the *meng* position, as in spring at *si*. The rest follow accordingly.

If the disciples are few, use the fasting altar, adhering to the standard *Huanglu* fast rites. Further adorn and purify the arrangements, ensuring all is meticulously prepared. All requisite items for ascending the altar are assembled. Sound the bell, and the Dharma Master with the disciples approach the altar.

The Three Masters and Five Guarantors, arrayed in ritual vestments, and the disciples, all in dark caps and yellow-brown robes, holding tablets, stand in solemn order. The offerings of incense and flowers, the chants and processions, all proceed according to ritual.

First, lead the disciples in circumambulating the altar three times, halting at the southeastern corner, facing west, and chanting without cease. Next, lead the master in circumambulating the altar three times, halting at the northwestern corner.

The master withdraws thirty paces from the altar—or seven paces—and strikes the teeth thirty-two times, visualizing purple clouds veiling his crown. Envision the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors of a single altar or mountain, one hundred thousand each, come to welcome your servant’s person, vivid and distinct. Then invoke:

As the divine perfected set forth on their journey,
The myriad emperors are struck with awe.
The Jade Void’s mysterious guard, the celestial lodges overturn,
The officials of the Five Marchmounts all lend their numinous aid.
Summoned by command, the armies of the ten directions are driven forth,
Leading the hosts of heaven downward, all assemble at the imperial court.
Grant that I may ascend as transcendent, penetrating the essence of the Dao,
Discerning the inauspicious, plumbing the depths of the obscure and hidden.
All that is directed or declared shall accord with the Jade Purity.

When complete, proceed slowly to ascend the altar, entering through the northwestern Celestial Gate. Invoke as prescribed.

Ascend the central altar, circling left to face northwest, and bow nine times toward the Lord of the Nine Heavens. Having completed the obeisance, strike the teeth nine times and invoke:

Your servant *jia* now transmits to disciple *mou jia* the precious scriptures of the Nine Heavens, up to the supreme jade taboo names. Having purified the fast and memorialized in advance, with *qi* and destiny conjoined in perfection, beseech the descent of the supervising perfected jade transcendent, the Attendant Gentleman of the Register, and the Marshal of Numinous Guardians to oversee the alliance text and all that is presented and entrusted, that it may be fully reported above.

Circumambulate the altar to the left, returning to face southeast, and bow twice. Then invoke again:

The Most High Primordial Heavenly King, on this day of supreme vows at the Eighth Assembly, with the day auspicious and the hour pure, reverently at the Dark Altar—or called the Sacred Peak—we transmit the Dark Scripture of Alliance and Ascent, beseeching the descent of the Five Sacred Mountains of the Five Emperors to oversee this servant’s covenant oath, that swiftly the divine immortality be granted, to ride the flying chariot and ascend to the Imperial Dawn.

Having completed this, the Dharma Master leans forward, then commands the disciple to enter the Central Altar from the southeastern Earth Gate, facing northwest to bow nine times. When finished, the Master circumambulates left to stand at the Earth Gate, while the disciple circumambulates left to stand at the Heavenly Gate, turning to face southeast. They bow twice more, then prostrate facing north with heads to the south. The Master turns to face north, strikes the teeth thirty-six times, and recites the *"Golden Perfection, Great Void Chapter"* to subdue the myriad demons. Its words say:

Heavenly demons surge through the void,
Myriad spirits startle the divine court.
Assuming forms in songs and chants,
They shift and enter the nameless.
How clamorous the chaotic *qi*,
Defiling the Way as it arises on the path.
Within clouds they dwell in crimson palaces,
The Northern Emperor deploys his divine troops.
The drum resounds—he knows by nature,
The dark fate comes to summon them.
The Supreme Radiance reins the flying bridle,
Swiftly driving to inspect the cloud encampments.
Urging the Northern Emperor’s records,
Seizing the names of the demon hordes.
The *huoluo* unfurls the celestial net,
Unleashing might to cast the ringing bells.
Golden Perfection aids the empty vastness,
Jade light illumines the eight darknesses.
Golden Mystery guards the Upper Palace,
Divine Tigers slay the celestial essences.
Severing the *qi* of ten thousand evils,
Countless billions all made level.
Upholding the Nine Heavens’ trust,
A single whistle commands all to yield.
Summoning the Perfected to fathom the Three Caverns,
Wisdom’s recitation shines with clarity.
The Eight Paths gaze upon the Dark Text,
Seven revolutions weave the Heavenly Scripture.
Merging with the Imperial Unity’s truth,
Delivering the seven generations of ancestors.
Eradicating the roots of the Five Sufferings,
Returning souls to receive renewed glory.
Golden light blazes in the silent chamber,
Divine candles kindle of themselves.
Fragrant blossoms scatter through the Jade Universe,
Misty *qi* pierces the Jade Capital.
The Emperor dispatches the lingering chariot,
The Three Origins descend in emerald carriages.
Swiftly ascending through the Nine Mysteries,
They come to attend my Jade Emperor’s court.

When finished, they circumambulate left, the disciple following the Master through the Heavenly Gate into the Inner Altar—or called entering through the Heavenly Gate. They circumambulate left. Three times they offer incense to the Five Directions, beginning in the east and circling back to the west, facing east. The Dharma Master closes his eyes, inwardly visualizing and perceiving the five viscera, five sacred peaks, five stars, and five emperors, all guarding within his body, illuminating and covering his form as one. His body becomes golden, emerging from behind the lungs, his neck crowned with a halo like the sun’s image, shining brightly in the ten directions. Within his body, all is clearly seen, inside and out.

Then he recites the invocation to the Guardian Spirits of Numinous Protection, saying:

Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Radiant Star Great Spirit,
Shining upon the eastern quarter, illuminating the Nine Gates,
Turning like a candle’s yang-light, sweeping away filth and dispelling miasma.
Luminous Youths, guard my chamber,
Seizing demons and binding evil,
Ascending to face the Imperial Lord,
Upholding the true Dao, the vermilion script and jade texts,
The talismanic commands of the Nine Heavens,
Summoning dragons to relay the decrees,
Pacifying and securing all under heaven—
Thus may I attain flight as an immortal.

Southern Vermilion Heavens, Three Qi flowing with light,
The Flaming Star turning like a candle, illuminating the Great Yang,
Above dwell the Crimson Essences,
Luminous Youths of numinous clarity,
Commanding the hosts of fire,
Guarding the Three Palaces,
Slaying deviance and binding evil,
Severing the demon kings.
Upheld by the Northern Emperor,
The Eight Thrusts of Wind and Fire,
Interlocking bells resplendent—
Should any dare disobey,
The true Dao flows forth.
I partake of supreme merit,
Preserving heaven’s enduring existence,
For kalpas without end.

Seven Qi of Heaven, the Great White streaming with essence,
Radiance shining upon the Golden Gate, illuminating the Great Darkness.
Within dwells the White Sovereign,
Titled the Imperial Spirit,
Preserving and pacifying the divine,
Guarding my bodily form,
Severing the roots of deviance,
The kingly Dao resplendent in rectitude.
Palaces and dwellings ordered,
The Three Luminaries aligned as one.
The Dao harmonizes with spontaneity—
Ascending to the Purple Court,
The talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure,
Universally benefiting the ten thousand beings.
Merit extended to all,
Heaven and earth at peace.

Northern Mysterious Heavens, Five Qi circling,
The Morning Star resplendent, shining upon the Supreme Subtlety.
Black Numinous Honored Spirits,
Flying in dark feathered robes,
Guarding the Five Gates,
Inspecting essences and seizing transgressions.
Should any dare test me,
They shall be shattered by the Vast and Falling.
As the jade talismans proclaim,
The Eight Might of the Divine Perfected,
The gates of deviance sealed,
The true Dao brightly opened,
Illuminating my body—
The Three Luminaries shine as one.
Spurring the void, riding the floating,
My form ascends in immortal flight.

Yellow Center governing qi, unifying the Mysterious and True,
The Star of Stability emitting radiance, streaming and shining upon the Nine Heavens.
Twelve Luminous Youths,
Primordial qi and yang essence,
Flames ascending as vermilion smoke,
Together illuminating one chamber,
And thus illuminating my body.
A hundred evils cast down,
Ten thousand ghosts slain.
The divine incantation of Mount Zhong,
Universally enacted under heaven.
The Five Numinous Ones pacified and secured—
My body flies as an immortal on high.

Next, strike the teeth twenty-four times.

Next, recite the incense-burning invocation, saying:
Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,
Summon forth from my body the Three and Five Merit Officers,
The left and right attending messengers,
The left and right incense-bearing dragon-riding couriers,
The Jade Lads attending incense,
The Jade Maidens scattering flowers,
The Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman Officers and Direct Day Incense Officers,
Each thirty-six in number,
To emerge and report to the true officials and divine spirits of this land and domain.

I now, at this moment, burn incense and transmit the teachings,
May the life-breath of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected Ones descend and infuse my body,
That my supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao.

Next, the Master leads the disciple in circumambulating left, holding the petition tablet, facing west toward the east, and intoning the Heavenly Worthy of the East. Each direction is honored with three bows.
Alternatively, one bow may suffice, or the tablet may be omitted, directly intoning the directions as they face.

Next, the south; then the west; then the north; then the northeast; then the southeast; then the southwest; then the northwest; then the upper direction; then the lower direction—each performed in the same manner.

We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Eastern Quarter’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,
The Azure Emperor, Nine Qi Heavenly Lord,
And all the numinous officials of the eastern quarter.
[Disciple’s name and lineage] reverently presents this petition.
The same is done for all ten directions.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the Southern Quarter’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,
The Flaming Emperor, Three Qi Heavenly Lord,
And all the numinous officials of the southern quarter.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the Western Quarter’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,
The White Emperor, Seven Qi Heavenly Lord,
And all the numinous officials of the western quarter.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the Northern Quarter’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,
The Black Emperor, Five Qi Heavenly Lord,
And all the numinous officials of the northern quarter.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the Northeastern Quarter’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,

With utmost sincerity, I, your disciple, now follow the covenants of the Supreme Perfected and the precepts of the fast,
Ascending the altar to prepare the offerings.
At the appointed hour yesterday, I presented the memorial to the numinous worthies,
Awaiting with sincerity in the jasper chamber,
The assembled spirits taking their positions.
Thus, the rain has ceased on this auspicious day,
The winds stilled in the clear daylight,
Extending through the Ten Heavens,
The Three Qi streaming with light,
Majestic forms spreading like clouds—
The Most High’s unfolding revealed.

I, [disciple’s name], am most fortunate,
Having rashly initiated this difficult-to-fulfill cause,
Presumptuously hoping for a difficult-to-attain fruition.
Diligently following the Dharma, I transmit the talismans,
From beginning to end,
Free from wind and rain,
That after receiving them,
I may encounter no obstacles.
Each kowtows and strikes the cheeks.

Next, the Dharma Master takes his position, facing east, while the disciple returns to face east, prostrating westward upon the ground.
The Dharma Master kneels lengthily and again strikes the teeth twenty-four times.

Summoning the officials:
With utmost sincerity, I reverently summon forth the true officials of the five organs within my body,

Each takes their position, stationed in the ten directions, scattering flowers and burning incense, attending upon the minister’s body.

True immortals and divine officials, with their armies and mounted escorts, assemble and station themselves before, behind, to the left, and to the right of the minister, arrayed in ordered ranks.
Spontaneous five-colored plain clouds illuminate and canopy their forms, streaming essence and dispersing qi, filling the ten directions, encircling heaven and covering earth, encamping and guarding the minister’s body.
Once all solemn preparations are complete, the Orthodox Unity Ascending Mystery Merit Clerk, the Communicating Perfected Delivering Destiny Transmitting Affairs Flying Celestial Messenger, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman Direct Attendants, bearing the Mystery-Void’s tablet, stand before the minister, receiving the words from his mouth, distinguishing and transmitting them to the heavenly officials and earthly spirits of the upper and lower, central and four quarters, eight directions, the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, Nine Rivers and Eight Poles, famous mountains and great marshes, the Five Thearchs’ Perfected Officials, the Four Offices’ Inspectors, the Nine Divisions’ Examiners and Summoners, the Primordial Yuan Beginning Qi Jiazi Officials, the boundless, limitless, immeasurably high, deep, profound, and manifest, innumerable hosts of Perfected Officials infusing qi into the Celestial August One, the Nine Palaces’ Eight Trigrams’ Six Jia Perfected Persons, the Root Origin Primordial Earth Lords, the Altars and Granaries’ Generals and Clerks—all at once solemnly prepared, together with the minister’s body’s Merit Clerk Messengers, Flying Dragon and Post Dragon Riders, Direct Talismans and Direct Attendants—jointly ascend to address the August Presence of the Supreme Unsurpassed Yuan Beginning Most High Great Dao, the Five Venerables, the Perfected Great Sage Honored Divine Lords, and the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and Virtue’s Multitudes of Sage Heavenly Worthies, Supreme Thearchs, Heavenly Thearchs, and Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center.

By fortunate karmic affinity from past lives, through nine heavens’ kalpas extending to this present body, I have encountered the luminous destiny of this age, when the Great Dharma flows and spreads, allowing this defiled being to partake in the sacred texts of the Upper Clarity Golden Writ and Three Caverns’ Treasure Scriptures. Since presumptuously receiving them, I have revered and aspired to the supreme Dharma, my heart yearning for immortality, yet my sincerity remains shallow and weak, failing to move the numinous. Constantly fearing the advent of transgressions, I dread sinking into the Nine Springs. Heaven’s compassion is vast, and my life has been preserved; I ought to guard my shortcomings and dare not speak further.

Now, as the Three Caverns govern the turning of the Dao, and the Numinous Treasure bestows its teachings below, the prior deliverance and ascension have left celestial offices vacant, requiring worthy ones from the middle realm to fill the heavens. On the day I received the Dharma, I was to deliver others first; those whose names were predestined in the Golden Registers and Jade Records, the perfected ones, have traversed the Eight Poles and come from the midst of emptiness and non-being. Now, there is one whose destiny is predestined: the Perfected Person of Such-and-Such Marchmount, So-and-So, aged such-and-such years, whose embodied conduct is pure and true, whose bones and destiny align with perfection, and who has already received the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ of the supreme Dharma. Though his participation has been humble and narrow, he has not yet beheld the source of the Dao; his faith and devotion have been earnest and long-standing. Now, bearing golden silks and Dharma tokens, he seeks to receive the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables’ Vermilion Writ Jade Chapters of the True Text, the Golden Writ Purple Characters’ Jade Text Vermilion Seal Scriptures, the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones’ Three Divisions’ Eight Effulgences’ Charts of Immortals’ Mounted Escorts, the Inner Sounds of the Heavens’ Spontaneous Jade Mighty Command Records of Eight Characters, and other sacred implements—divine staves, covenant texts, treasure scriptures—pledging his sincerity, making supplication, with his nine ancestors as witnesses, swearing to treasure them as his own body, vowing never to transgress.

The prohibitions of the Dharma I have received are weighty, and I dare not lightly proclaim them. After thorough verification, his words and sincerity grow ever firmer; examining his cinnabar heart, I deem him capable of accomplishment. Since the Dharma allows for deliverance, I dare not obstruct it. Accordingly, following the *Yellow Register’s Simplified Writs and Numinous Immortals’ Ordinances and Ranks*, I have fasted with him for three days, revealing the true texts under the open sky, with heaven clear and earth still, the four qi tranquil, no wind stirring, no dust rising—meeting the Dharma and aligning with perfection. Now, reverently adhering to the ancient canons of my former masters, I transmit to So-and-So the essentials of the Illuminating Perfected Great Dharma and Jade Instructions, ascending the August Altar together.

With golden silks to secure the numinous, I first bow and present a scroll of yellow silk with a vermilion memorial, ascending to the Nine Heavens, placing it upon the jade tablet for inspection. Next, I read the memorial text aloud, then strike my teeth three times to dispatch it. I solemnly dispatch the Five Body Immortal Officials and their mounted escorts within my body, the repeatedly commanded Merit Clerk Messengers, the Memorializing Direct Talisman Transmitting Words and Writing Assistants, all solemnly attired in manifest vestments, crowned and sashed with hanging tassels. They promptly carry the minister’s delivered Dao yellow silk vermilion memorial, ascending to the presence of the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables, the Perfected Great Sage Honored Divine Lords.

Should my words be inverted or erroneous, the texts mistaken or deviating from the ancient Dharma, I pray they be corrected and rectified according to the matter, ensuring they align above, without causing the overseeing celestial officials to reject or reprimand. If any demonic spirits, ghosts, or malevolent forces obstruct or intercept the public documents, may they be seized and delivered to the local prisons, punished according to the offense. May what I have presented be conveyed above, and may my wishes surely reach fulfillment. Humbly awaiting your gracious consideration and response, I prostrate myself in anticipation of your decree.

Then the disciple turns left, faces south, while the master turns left to face north, and kneels lengthily. The drum is sounded thirty-six times.

The Most High Numinous Treasure Supreme Cavern Mystery Master, so-and-so the Master, your servant Yue so-and-so bows twice with head reverently lowered, and respectfully invokes the Celestial Canon Attendant Immortals, the Jade Scribes of the Scriptures, the Supervisor of Ordination Sima, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens—all bearing purple-feathered tablets and tenfold sacred banners, accompanied by ten thousand spirits and a thousand perfected ones, with phoenix flutes sounding before and celestial harmonies played behind, burning incense and scattering flowers, descending together through the void.

Heavenly ranks arrayed, they oversee the covenant of ordination. Your servant, relying on the assembled perfected immortals and flying dragon couriers, humbly addresses the Most High Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables, the Numinous Treasure Primordial Honored One, the Ten Directions’ Spontaneous Perfected, the Four Quarters’ Great Sages, the Golden Watchtower Lord, the Supreme Pole Perfected, the Three Perfected of the Supreme Mystery Unity, and the host of honored ones in the Jade Tower below:

Your servant, a fool of base flesh, has by past merit and destined meeting encountered the true scriptures and received the great Dharma of the Three Caverns’ precious texts. The Dao is lofty, its principles profound—far beyond my capacity. Day and night I tremble in fear, body and soul never at rest. Your servant, in utmost reverence and dread, kowtows again and again, acknowledging my mortal transgressions.

Presumptuously overstepping my station, I dare to present these words. I reflect that the honored scriptures are sacred and weighty, their origins deep and fathomless—truly not something a humble servant may expound. Moreover, the luminous statutes and regulations decree that transmission may only occur after fifty-eight hearings. My grasp of the Dharma is still shallow; I am unworthy to proclaim it openly. Yet as the great kalpa nears its end and the world’s span shortens, fortune and misfortune alternate swiftly. The Dao requires that the loyal and worthy be broadly initiated, that they enter the Dharma gate.

Though the hearts of people today are shallow and deceitful, truth and falsehood hard to discern, yet those who yearn with utmost sincerity—even faintly—may be recognized. Through earnest seeking and sincere devotion, none should be shut out. Having previously submitted a memorial for your celestial attention, I now respectfully report that the Perfected of such-and-such an Emperor, so-and-so, is by nature compassionate and kind, his character pure and unblemished. His aspirations are lofty, unconcerned with glory or splendor. He delights in emptiness and savors the real, longing for immortality. He has followed the teachings of the Great Vehicle of the Supreme Dharma, exhorting and guiding others, establishing virtue and merit. Diligent in alchemical toil, tireless in his devotion, he has drilled and striven for years, his resolve fixed on the source of the Dao.

Now he presents gold, silk, and precious tokens—requisites for receiving the true teachings—and swears before the assembled spirits, with his nine generations of ancestors as witnesses, seeking to bear the Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Beginning Five Venerables’ Red Writ of the True Text and Precious Talismans, the twenty-four Perfected Divine Officials and Soldiers of the Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries, the Jade Scripts of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, the Eight Might Command Texts, the divine staff, and all other matters as I have observed.

So-and-so’s innate nature and conduct are fitting for accomplishment. Respectfully following the ancient statutes of the Illustrious Perfected, I have established an altar, formed a covenant, and sworn before the Nine Heavens. In accordance with the regulations, I now confer these upon him. Let them be treasured as his own body, never to be betrayed, lightly divulged, or carelessly profaned. To violate this would be to sever his roots and destroy his lineage, to harm the parents who gave him life, and to bring upon himself the trials of the wind-blade and the knife, with no reprieve for ten thousand kalpas.

May the Most High and the host of honored ones, the Ten Directions’ Sacred Perfected, and the Four Directors and Five Emperors witness this covenant. Respectfully submitted for your celestial consideration and enactment. Your servant, in utmost reverence and dread, bows twice with head reverently lowered.

Then the Dharma Master concludes the invocation. Thereupon he rises, and the disciple follows behind the master. Three times they offer incense to the five directions, beginning in the east, kneeling lengthily each time they approach a quarter. When the circuit is complete, they circumambulate three times and scatter flowers in the ten directions. At this time, the Five Perfected Ones’ hymns are chanted in turn. The disciple bows twice and intones the benediction.

**Hymn of the Supreme Pole Perfected:**
The Most High Lord of the Great Dao
Revealed the Numinous Treasure scriptures.
Sublime and wondrous, beyond compare—
Like the mystery within the mystery.
The spontaneous, non-actional Dao,
Studied, leads to lofty immortality.
Vast is the Cavernous Void scripture,
Seated in peace, one may ascend the heavens.
Above, it treasures the Purple Tenuity Terrace;
Below, it conceals itself in famous mountains.
Resplendent with dragon and phoenix script,
Its radiance gleams in the spaceless.
Wondrous is the Most High’s Dao,
Non-actional, ever spontaneous.
Kings, lords, and common folk—
All esteem only the loyal and worthy.
Those with past-life blessings,
Outstanding from former causes,
Receive the Dharma Master’s transmission,
The precious trust for kalpas uncounted.
Broadly mindful of delivering all,
Great fortune returns to your person.
In offering, one attains the Dao;
In practice, one becomes a perfected one.
The Great Dao has no self or other—
Transmission must find the right person.

**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity First Perfected:**
From the Cavern of All Wonders,
Resplendent, it illumines the Great Clarity.
Those who uphold it are called immortals,
Their bodies eternally enduring.
Carefree, they sport in the mysterious void,
Palaces arrayed in formlessness.
Lush are the seven-jeweled groves,
Radiant as sun and moon’s essence.
Dragon scales intertwine in flight,
Phoenixes soar with mournful cries.
The Most High governs the Purple Terrace,
The host of perfected chant the Cavern scriptures.
Burning incense, they bow in reverence,
Circumambulating the palace city.
Three circuits return to the high seat,
The Dao King responds in kind.
When the ruler embraces the supreme Dao,
The world enjoys universal peace.

**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity Second Perfected:**
Emptiness and constancy are spontaneous,
Forcibly named the Great Dao.
Boundless and remote, without limit,
All wonders return to the Numinous Treasure.
Closing the eyes, one contemplates the Perfected;
With concentrated thought, the Ten Elders descend.
Ascending as immortals, forever non-actional,
Their numinous countenances ever wondrous.
Thirst quenched with jade pool nectar,
Hunger sated with golden radiance herbs.
Through stillness and wisdom, the eight perils are crossed,
The world’s myriad sufferings relieved.

**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity Third Perfected:**
Wondrous are the Numinous Treasure scriptures,
The Most High’s spontaneous texts.
Those who uphold them attain immortality,
Called the true Heavenly Honored Ones.
Charged with proclaiming the Dao’s teachings,
Truly they transcend the mundane.
Their work complete, they ascend as immortals,
Their palaces govern the Mystery Terrace.
At times they descend Mount Kunlun,
Carefree, they rest on Penglai.

**Hymn of the Supreme Rectified Unity Perfected, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Celestial Master:**
The Numinous Treasure and the Great Cavern—
The king of the perfected Dao’s scriptures.

Should there be the Five Thousand Characters,
Lofty and wondrous, peerless in the world.
Those who uphold them ascend as flying immortals,
Their mysterious abodes governing the void.
They attend the Terrace of the Most High,
Carefree, they dwell in the Purple Tenuity Palace.
Ten thousand kalpas pass like a flash of lightning,
Yet they endure eternally without end.
The Dao-eye now fully complete,
Their luminous clarity pierces the hidden depths.
Dark and obscure, nothing remains unknown—
Seated in stillness, they observe the ten directions.

When the recitation concludes, the Dharma Master and disciples return to their positions, facing south and north, unfolding the True Writ upon the altar. The Master recites the Preface to the True Writ, after which the disciples bow again. Then, following the Jade Instructions, they pronounce each character with correct intonation, explaining and transmitting them orally for reception.

The disciples receive the oral instructions and install the Eastern Treasure Floriate Grove’s Azure Numinous First Elder and the Nine Qi Azure Heaven’s Vermilion Writ.

**Vermilion Writ of the Eastern Jade Chapter**

Goblins and specters,

The Demon-Quelling Straddler and Mysterious Dipper
Illuminate and traverse the Celestial Pass.
The Nine Heavens’ talismanic command,
Transmitted by the Golden Horse courier.
It commands and restrains the Northern Emperor,
Sealing the Ghost Gate.
Shearing away inauspiciousness,
None dare stand before it.
The Central Mountain’s divine incantation
Summons dragons to ascend the clouds,
Restrains and convenes the Yellow River,
The nine watercourses’ sources.
They must not slacken or indulge—
Good and evil are fully distinguished.
A thousand malevolent spirits and ten thousand treacheries,
All face the Imperial Lord.

Proclaimed for all to hear.

All under Feng’s dominion,
Ten thousand malevolent spirits crushed to naught.
The nine rivers’ waters overturned,
Bird mothers and their flocks take flight.
Dragons clear the paths,
Waterways open in luminous passage.
The Vermilion Writ’s jade script,
Transmitted by dragon couriers on the wind.

Crimson fire and golden bells,
Assisting and winging the Highest Perfected,
Exiting darkness and entering shadow,
Summoning Heaven-Heaven’s reverence,
Seizing Earth-Earth’s welcome,
Pointing at ghosts—ghosts die,
Demonic rebels bound in form.
Numinous talisman, divine staff,
Mightily subduing the hundred spirits,
Rising to seize all directions,
Born with me in life,
After ten thousand kalpas,
To replace my form.
Radiance becomes the Five Liberations,
Spirit ascends to Highest Clarity.
Receiving the talisman and proclaiming the mandate,
None dare disrespect or fail to heed."*

Complete, draw the qi of the five directions and swallow it twenty-five times to conclude.
Next, the master proclaims the Cinnabar Water Text:
*"Great Cavern Master of Such-and-Such Peak, your servant So-and-So, proclaims to disciples So-and-So and others:
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the boundless vastness, unfolded and expounded the true writ, weaving it into wondrous scriptures. Kalpa after kalpa, salvation and deliverance know no end, like the dust and sands of measureless eons without cease. The numinous writ, profound and recondite, is secreted within the Golden Pavilion, revered by the host of perfected, looked up to by all heavens. In the era of the Red Bird, it was bestowed upon the Immortal Duke, and the wondrous scriptures of the Numinous Treasure thus emerged to deliver humankind.
I, by humble karmic affinity, have encountered this numinous writ. My former master, in manifest adornment, transmitted the supreme Dharma, which I vowed to treasure as my own body—how dare I presume to divulge it? Yet as kalpas turn and fortunes shift, the Dharma’s time has come to spread. To those who harmonize with the real, I transmit it in accordance with the statutes.
Today, I swear before the Nine Heavens to bestow it upon So-and-So. After receiving the scriptures, you must follow the luminous statutes: purify yourself, discipline your body, devote yourself with diligence and sincerity, sever worldly ties, and aspire solely to the Great Vehicle. Make offerings, perform reverent rites, study the wondrous and abstruse, inquire of those accomplished in the Dao, practice guiding and refining, observe purification fasts and wear ritual vestments, and seek to ascend in flight. Honor the Dao and revere your master, esteeming the root above all. You must not be insincere, all face and no heart, nor assail your own foundation, nor fabricate groundless faults. Do not slight the scriptural treasures, nor indulge in superficial admiration, nor wallow in lust and greed, nor harbor jealousy, anger, or resentment. Do not be deceitful in heart, nor nurse malice within. Should you violate these precepts even once, your body will fill the Three Springs.
You, So-and-So, along with your three progenitors and five ancestors, shall together sink into the earthly prisons, without reprieve for ten thousand kalpas.
Today, I establish the Yellow Altar, ally with the Five Emperors, and transmit the precious writ of the Ten Sections of Wondrous Scriptures. All heavens and the Five Peaks stand witness to this covenant. Examine your conduct, uphold the Dharma with care, and hold it fast in your heart. Flight as an immortal may then be expected, and you shall ultimately attain the perfection of the Dao. Discipline yourself earnestly, as prescribed in the statutes of the Four Poles."*

Next, the disciple’s own covenant text:
*"Disciple So-and-So of the Cavern Mystery, from Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, Village, and Hamlet, prostrates and bows twice, reverently addressing the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Dao Lord, the Venerable Divinities of the Ten Directions, and the Perfected of the Four Quarters who have already attained the Dao.
The precious talismans of the Thirty-Six Sections of the Most High Numinous Treasure’s venerable scriptures, and the Great Cavern Master So-and-So, by karmic affinity and accumulated merit, through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, have revolved unceasingly. Blessed by fortune’s reach and transformed by the wheel of rebirth, I was born into the Dharma gate. By former vows, I aspired to the loftiest lineage, the great vehicle of the Dharma’s board, my spirit exultant, fearing only the decay of this fleshly frame.
Now, as heavenly fortunes shift and the imperial Dao’s destiny unfolds, I have been graciously uplifted and enlightened by Master So-and-So, who has opened my ignorant mind and bestowed upon me the numinous writ, allowing me to serve before the sagely lord. My mortal body trembles with awe, having washed away defilement and filth, and now attending the numinous altar. I bow in gratitude for this elevation, a glory beyond my due.
I vow to discipline myself and purify my body, to make offerings and revere the honored rites, to cast off worldly entanglements and retire to secluded heights, to forever forsake the paths of the world and dwell only among hills and crags. Day and night, I shall prostrate in worship, striving to exhaust my humble capacities, hoping to rely on the sagely writ to deliver this decaying frame. With utmost sincerity and single-minded devotion, I shall harbor no second thoughts. I dare not violate this covenant or betray my oath, nor deceive my master or slight the Dao, nor be all face and no heart, nor fail to preserve the kalpas.
I, having gathered my transgressions and swallowed my voice, dare to speak thus, invoking my seven generations of parents and ninefold ancestors as witnesses to this oath, and all living kin of my nine clans as guarantors of this covenant.
I delight in the immortal’s path and dare not be constrained by time. Should I violate this even for a day, may my life and death alike sink into the earthly prisons of the Five Paths, and may I never be pardoned.
Above, I proclaim to the Primordial Beginning; below, I swear before the Five Emperors. Before the master’s treasure and my own body, I establish this covenant oath. With cinnabar sincerity and utmost devotion, I humbly beg for your compassionate acceptance.
Your servant So-and-So, with reverence and awe, prostrates and bows twice."*

Next, the master rises and faces north, holding the two copies of the true writ in his left hand.
The disciple kneels, holding the token of faith in his right hand. The master strikes his teeth thirty-six times and visualizes the colors of the five viscera, fully arrayed to form a canopy of precious clouds, covering the scriptures and the master.
He then recites:
*"The celestial writ’s simplicity is not burdensome,
The Dao and virtue are complete of themselves.
Cultivate them, and you shall surely become an immortal—
What more could you desire?
The text shines in the Grand Interstice,
Resplendent and radiant.
Transmit and receive it strictly by the Dharma;
To divulge or slight it is to fall into hell."*

Next, the disciple kneels, performs nine bows, rising and prostrating three times, and receives the true writ. Girding the sash and grasping the staff, he bows once to each of the ten directions, beginning in the north and circling eastward to complete the circuit.
He visualizes the Most High’s true form, like the Heavenly Worthy’s image.
Complete, the master rises and paces in procession, chanting the *Step of Emptiness*:
*"Prostrating, I bow to the Most High,
Burning incense, I return to emptiness.
Luminous radiance follows my turning,
The Dharma wheel likewise circles thrice."*

The mystic vow arises in the four directions,
Auspicious blessings reach kings and lords.
Seven generations ascend to heaven’s halls,
Resplendent, their radiance spreads wide.
Whistling songs survey the vast desert,
Heavenly music delights my joy.
In unison, we offer the supreme virtue’s fragrance,
Lesser immortals cannot compare.
Wondrous thoughts illumine the profound awakening,
In throngs, they ride the void in flight.
Turning, they tread the cloud-net’s threads,
Mounting the void, they pace the mystic register.
Chanting praises to the Emperor of Unity,
A hundred passages self-regulate.
Bowing, they command the Eight Seas’ youths,
Gazing upward, they grasp the lofty immortals’ hands.
The heavens scatter fragrant blossoms,
A subtle, numinous wind arises.
Long-held vows root destiny’s core,
Thus attaining lofty eminence.
Beholding the music before the Most High,
Even ten thousand kalpas seem unbegun.
Towering, the Mystic Capital’s peaks,
The ten directions revere the August One.
Soaring, the Heavenly Treasure Terrace,
Its radiance flames like streaming sunlight.
Refining brilliance in jade-forest blossoms,
Vivid hues gleam like pearls’ essence.
Ever mindful to feast on primordial essence,
Refining fluids to solidify form and substance.
Golden light scatters through the Purple Tenuity,
Graceful, the Great Vehicle’s ease.
Looking up and down, I hold the Most High in mind,
Luminous splendor adorns the cinnabar field.
Glancing left, I grasp the Dark Standard,
Turning right, I take hold of the Knotted Brilliance.
The Six Perfections crown the brahmic practice,
Virtue and power renew with the sun.
Karmic fortune from past lives ripens,
Hearing the scriptures as if kin.
Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent,
Delighting in reciting the subtle and minute.
Embracing emptiness, the Great Harmony’s qi,
Exhaling and inhaling the flowing rosy mist.
Embryonic breathing stills a hundred passages,
In solitude, I fathom the three conveniences.
The Mud-Pill Palace gleams with bright radiance,
Thus becoming a Golden Flower immortal.
The Demon King reverently receives his charge,
Thus able to ascend and pay homage to the heavens.
All begins with fasting and precepts,
Accumulating merit to bind past-life affinities.
Soaring flight traverses the Great Void,
Uplifting the loftiest adepts.
Guiding the reins to the ten directions,
Circling to rest on the Mystic Radiance’s slopes.
Gazing up at the Kalpa-Blade Terrace,
Looking down upon the Purple Cloud Net.
Carefree in the Most High’s capital,
Together we sit upon lotus blossoms.
Through accumulated study, one becomes a perfected person,
Serene, the constructive and protective qi harmonize.
Eternally enjoying boundless longevity,
Ten thousand cedars—what abundance could compare?
The Great Dao’s master is profound stillness,
Ascending immortals befriend the peerless.
The noble scion transmits the numinous talisman,
The Great One upholds the cavernous scriptures.
Śarīra radiates golden splendor,
Dragon-drawn chariots suddenly arrive to welcome.
The Heavenly Worthy gazes from the cloud carriage,
Floating, floating, soaring through the void.
Fragrant blossoms like flying snow,
Swirling mists luxuriate on the mystic beams.
Bowing my head, I pay homage at the Golden Portal,
Hand in hand, we invite each other to the Jade Capital.
The Kien Tree’s Round Radiance Garden,
Resplendent, the Seven Treasures’ Grove.
Three hundred named celestial beasts,
Lions vast as ten thousand fathoms.
Flying dragons pace and chant,
Divine phoenixes sing in rhythm.
A numinous wind fans wondrous blossoms,
Pure fragrance scatters upon my lapels.
Without transcendent talent, how could one indulge this heart?
I adorn my nine-dragon chariot,
Mounting the void to roam carefree.
The eight heavens are like a hall at fingertip’s reach,
The six directions—how could they be distant?
All immortals recite the Cavernous Mystery,
The Most High sings a pure melody.
Fragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,
Jade tones form in the purple clouds.
The Five Sufferings all at once disperse,
The Eight Difficulties follow the scriptures’ emptiness.
Wondrous indeed, the Numinous Treasure’s preserve,
Raising this great Dharma bridge.
The Heavenly Perfected’s Palace of the Emperor of Unity,
Lush, it crowns the radiant numen.
Flowing brilliance, the Dharma wheel’s net,
Turning through space, entering formlessness.
The Void Sovereign’s village-cloud zither,
All perfected ones recite the cavernous scriptures.
Lofty immortals, solemn, join hands in praise,
Through endless kalpas, they preserve integrity.
The supremely perfected await nothing,
At times, they rein flying dragons.
Long fasts convene in the Mystic Capital,
Jade chimes strike the jasper bells.
The Ten Blossoms’ immortals assemble,
Purple mists congeal into a palace.
Jeweled canopies array before the Most High,
Perfected persons grasp lotuses.
Scattering blossoms, I declare my vow,
Grasping the tally, I subdue demon kings.
Dharma drums summon the assembled immortals,
Numinous chants resound in unison.
Nothing to be done, nothing not to be done,
Thoughts commune with the subtle and minute.

Then, facing north, he recites three hymns of reverence. Their words say:

*"Delighting in the Dharma as my wife,
Cherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.
Upholding precepts to restrain the six passions,
Mindful of the Dao, I dispel desires.
Serene, the upright qi abides,
The numinous spirit, still and silent.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
Lifetimes receive great blessings.
Flourishing, the household and kingdom prosper,
Thriving, the scriptures and Dao arise.
May heaven and humankind fulfill their vows,
Ethereally entering the Great Vehicle.
Establishing a field of merit through intention,
The Dharma wheel ascends, vast and boundless.
Seven generations ascend to heaven’s halls,
My body ascends at daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the cavernous void,
With mindfulness, nothing fails to align.
Refining form to enter immortal truth,
Thus becoming a vajra body.
Transcending the three realms’ difficulties,
Dissolving the Five Sufferings of hell.
All return to the Most High’s scriptures,
In stillness, I bow my head in homage."*

After each recitation of a *Step of Emptiness* hymn, the disciple chants "Excellent!" and scatters blossoms, bows once, and completes the rite by chanting the Three Reverences:

*"With utmost sincerity, I bow my head in homage to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, I bow my head in homage to the thirty-six revered scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, I bow my head in homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center."*

Then, sitting evenly, the disciple prostrates before the master. The master recites the *Primordial Beginning’s Prohibitions and Precepts*, and the disciple responds with assent to each phrase, declaring his name: "Disciple So-and-so." The master instructs, and the disciple responds three times with assent.

The *Primordial Beginning’s Red Writ of the Five Tablets* is the scripture of the Highest Clarity’s spontaneity, the numinous, cavernous chapters of the Nine Heavens’ inception, establishing heaven and earth, unfolding the myriad perfected, pacifying spirits and settling numina, engendering and completing the multitudes, rectifying and governing the cosmic rhythm, preserving heaven’s eternal endurance. Above, it regulates celestial mechanisms; at the center, it inspects the five numina; below, it reins the earthly deities. Whistling, it commands the river’s source, directs and employs yin and yang, summons spirits and dispatches immortals. This most perfected writ, wondrously responsive to spontaneity, causes heaven’s heights to clear, the earth to stand firm, the Five Peaks to secure their guardianship, and the ten thousand kinds to endure. The Primordial Beginning inscribed it in the Numinous Capital’s palace. Through countless kalpas, its text remains steadfast at heaven’s root, never decaying or sinking. With the cosmic rhythm, it shifts yet remains unstained; defiled, it grows ever purer; destroyed, it does not perish; extinguished, it shines most brightly. This writ of the Great Existence is revered by the heavenly perfected. Unless one’s name is recorded in the imperial register and inscribed on the tablets of future lives, this text remains hidden and secret, beyond the reach of prying eyes. Those who obtain it abide with the Three Qi eternally. Diligently practicing its methods, they attain immortality.

Only through wholehearted devotion and personal reverence shall household and state know peace, life be preserved, calamities averted, and all inauspicious omens swept away. When the Son of Heaven and feudal lords uphold it, the realm attains great tranquility, hostile invaders submit of themselves, borderlands cease their strife, the myriad people raise their voices in song, and all under heaven flourishes. As the cycles of destiny turn and the true Dao prevails, those who obtain it summon forth the natural, the heavenly perfected in their wondrous majesty—what the Nine Heavens guard in secrecy. It must not be lightly disclosed, lest judgment befall your person.

Should a disciple be deemed worthy of transmission, though their years have not yet reached five times eight, let all ritual tokens be fully prepared. Following the Yellow Register, they shall take three masters and initiate nineteen disciples, their merit complete before the precious instructions may be passed. No transmission shall occur outside the proper lineage, nor shall it be privately taught.

Should one violate these statutes, recklessly divulging without covenant, both master and recipient shall face the trials of the Four Poles, their seven generations consigned to the earthly prisons, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Can you not be cautious? Can you not be cautious? Let this be your faith.

Hereupon, the disciple rises and bows three times, then prostrates again.

Next, the Six Vows are conferred, saying:
First vow: not to lightly disclose.
Second vow: not to treat with irreverence.
Third vow: not to transmit recklessly.
Fourth vow: not to speak of it idly.
Fifth vow: not to violate the scriptural prohibitions.
Sixth vow: not to accept wealth in exchange for the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy’s Six Vows bind the human heart; when the human heart is steadfast, the heart of the Dao is true. One must not break these vows or transgress the covenant, lest they endure the Wind Blade’s eternal torment.

As the vows are recited, the disciple first holds incense, one hand pointing to heaven—left for men, right for women.

Hereupon, the disciple bows six times. The master stands and intones:
The true Dao is lofty and wondrous, revealed only in response to sincere devotion. With a heart of red earnestness, moved by compassion for the Supreme Mystery, the Purple Text refines the essence, divine gold subdues demons. Radiant and majestic, its power grants immortality. Now I bestow it upon you—swear not to speak of it recklessly. Treasure and guard this descent of the true; to divulge it is to invite disaster. The heavenly statutes are stern—let this be your observance.

Hereupon, the disciple bows six times again.

Next, the master formally confers the disciple’s rank, saying: *Tai Shang Lingbao Wushang Dongxuan Disciple, Master of Such-and-Such Peak, So-and-So.*

The disciple kneels to receive, then retreats, holding the tablet upright before them. They address their root master, bowing nine times, rising and prostrating thrice, advancing on elbows and knees.

When finished, they move left to face east, bowing twice toward the west. Then they turn north, then east, then south, bowing twice in each direction, in homage to the Four Poles.

Returning to their position, they bow three times to each of the Three Masters of Transmission. Then they again read the petitions to the Ten Directions and the Five Masters, facing each direction as before, save that the Five Masters are honored facing west.

Hereupon, they kneel in profound gratitude, the disciple kowtowing and striking their cheeks without count. Their words are:

The Disciples of the Supreme Numinous Treasure, Peerless Cavern Mystery—this mountain’s master, your subjects [Name] and others—now burn incense and kowtow, entrusting body, spirit, and life to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, to the Perfected Lords of the Ten Realms who have attained the Dao, to the Venerable Ones, to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm, to the Three Perfected of the Supreme Unity, to the High Mystery Dharma Masters of the Great Ultimate, to the Orthodox Unity Perfected of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters, and to all divine spirits within and beyond the Three Realms.

Your subjects, in transmitting the precepts to the disciple [Name] and conducting the altar’s oath-pledge, humbly beseech the grace of deliverance from the assembled Worthies above. We pray for absolution of all transgressions—from the time we first received form from our parents, through all karmic ties and kin, to the present—for the myriad sins and errors of your subjects and the disciple now receiving transmission. Since the establishment of this retreat until this day, we have violated precepts, broken laws, erred in conduct, failed in decorum, mispronounced sacred names, confused ranks and order, and deviated in the transmission of empowerment. We implore your great compassion to pardon and not hold us guilty.

May your mercy flow forth at once, your majesty manifest this day. Today, from the mouth of the Precious Pearl, countless beings ascend to its summit, joining the assembly of the exalted. Together they cross the Tiger Gorge and arrive as one, surmount the Dragon Mountain and reach in unison, attaining the four fruits of realization. Thus may the five vows previously made be fulfilled in this moment.

The Pearl’s mouth knows no overflow, water and fire cannot burn or sink it. Today, men and women gaze in awe at the Phoenix Chariot, awaiting the Dragon Carriage from afar. All these wise companions, each the father of their father’s father, share in the One of the Mystic Unity. May the five eyes reward diligence, the three luminances bestow virtue. May merit race like joyous steeds, and blessings of ease and delight abound. May the tally of death be erased, the record of life flourish. May the hymns of the Primal Beginning endure forever, and the unending celebration of the Never-Ending resound.

May each be granted extended destiny and discerning form, protection for high and low, life for young and old. May men be steadfast in faith, women guarded by the Dharma. May women bear purple tablets, men inscribe jade registers. May their immortality rival the Red Lord’s, their attainment of the Dao vie with the Mountain Chart’s liberation. May the paths of misfortune vanish together, and the steps of blessing rise through compassion. May emperors reign long, loving their people and governing the realm. May the Three Refuges be universally embraced, the Four Teachings widely received. May prisons and calamities be forever averted, karmic bonds eternally severed. May disasters and afflictions not arise, decline and suffering not be born.

For all other wishes, may each be fulfilled as sought: those who seek office attain office, those who seek nobility attain nobility, those who seek the Dao attain the Dao, those who seek the Real attain the Real. May all aspirations be harmonized, all desires fulfilled. May the Dao be perfected in heaven and earth, merit aid living beings. May it extend to all—the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens; the mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams; the Dragon Kings, Bird Kings, Beast Kings, and Insect Kings; the myriad spirit-kings of all things; all Heavenly Kings; the gods of heaven and earth in every place; the numinous spirits of mountains and waters; the officials and elders of villages and domains; and all guardian soldiers and officers. May they all turn in unison this instant, ascending together to the wondrous and sublime.

May the Seven Origins be peacefully traversed, the Four Symbols free of error. May heaven display auspicious omens, earth reveal numinous portents. May mountains open their treasure tablets, rivers yield their dragon charts. May the five sacred herbs and green grasses spread across the countryside. May the four directions be purified, the world know great peace.

May boundless merit extend to the overseeing officials, those who labor, and all who rejoice in this act—along with the men and women who observe and listen. May all with karmic affinity partake in supreme blessings, their dark debts repaid across the six paths, their joy bestowed upon the four kinds of birth. May the five sufferings and three evils, all sentient beings with consciousness, be cleansed and bathed. May they don celestial robes and sashes, delight in freedom, and form good affinities forever. May they become companions in the Dharma, never regressing, with the attainment of the Dao as their destined goal.

As for the altar master who pledged himself, [Name], may the five scriptures enter his body, the jade talismans nurture his essence. May divine perfected ones guard his life, heavenly texts inspire auspicious signs. May the eight assemblies align with the charts, the six perfections be constantly upheld, the four practices remain unbroken. May the five penetrations elevate him to immortality, the ten transformations enable his flight. May his body be adamantine and pure, his attainment of the sagely fruit resplendent. Bowing to the Ten Directions, may he abide eternally in the Three Treasures.

Next, the master recites the verses on the three destinies and five sufferings:

The Three Powers and the myriad things,
Dependent and latent, each has its span.
End and beginning await the kalpa’s reckoning,
When blessings are exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.

Back and forth through the five paths,
How bitter to die and be reborn again!
Turning within the three destinies,
Coming and going with calamity.

Great worthies, heed this warning,
Restrain your nature, sever your passions.
Foolish ones do not believe the Dharma,
Their sins and pains ever cling to them.

I grieve that the world knows no end,
So I now proclaim this clearly:
If you wish to escape these afflictions,
Take refuge in the Supreme Scriptures.

Sin and blessing do not come from another—
Truly, they arise from your own voice.
Great worthies, therefore, seal your lips,
To sever all evil ties.

Extinguish thoughts, attain perfect stillness,
Dependent and latent, await their final dissolution.
Spreading the Dao to pacify the world,
You will ultimately behold the True.

Lust and jealousy are the roots of misfortune,
The greatest perils to body and life.
Nurturing such harms,
How can the Dao find peace?

Knowing evil yet not reforming,
You will surely meet an early end.
Harboring poison while feigning purity,
You make me sigh deeply.

Karma from past lives is real,
Yet the weak call it nonexistent.
All desire to see it before their eyes,
Dismissing what passes as false.

Great worthies, enlightened by the Dao’s teachings,
Grieve for the stubborn.
Tenderly I think of your suffering,
Diligently I cause you concern.

Life is consumed like fire in oil,
The four great elements but a temporary abode,
The five aggregates a provisional loan.
In your prime, study earnestly,
Seek to preserve what is yours.

When blessings are exhausted, body and spirit scatter,
In the dark depths of hell below.
The sages above fear this,
So they seek the Dao to escape this calamity.

To learn immortality is urgent,
Uphold the precepts, restrain the heart.
Let emptiness and purity dwell in the upright qi,
And immortals and sages will naturally come.

If you do not believe these words,
Why dwell in the mountains?
Great worthies, delight in the scriptures and precepts,
Receive them as treasures for your body.

To study is always bitterly late,
To cultivate the body, regrettably not sooner.

When I now unravel these profound mysteries,
In a flash, years have aged me.
Clutching the scroll, I exhaust your essence—
Soon death will bring only grief and torment.

Thus in my youth I forsook the world to study the Dao.
Next, the Dharma Master turned eastward,
Spoke of merits, and resumed his office.

Tai Xuan Du Zheng Yi Ping Qi, Celestial Master of Yangping District, Left Minister of Ping Qi, your subject [Name], bows twice and respectfully declares:

According to the documents, your subject is but a mortal of flesh and blood, yet by fortune’s grace was born into the Dharma gate. By the boundless favor of the Great Sage, I have been graciously granted the inner and outer essentials of the wondrous Dharma—the Dao of immortality and deliverance from death. I humbly ascend the *Three Caverns’* treasure scriptures of *Shangqing*, guarded by the radiance of clouds, blessed by profound and unmatched grace.

The weight of the Dao is heavy; mortals are light. Such burden is not for this humble frame to bear. To fail the celestial offices would be to forfeit my very head.

Today, upon this mountain ridge, I transmit the precious scriptures of ordination to my disciple [Name]. From the midst of the Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries, the celestial steeds of immortals emerge—Divine Envoys of Flying Heaven, messengers who convey petitions and memorials. I invoke the registering officials of the Five Emperors, the local deities of the Five Peaks, the true lords of sacred mountains and domains, to oversee the bestowal of qi, to witness and protect this rite.

All is by the merit of the assembled officials’ protection. Overwhelmed by such grace, I reverently offer this memorial of merit and petition for all to hear.

May the exalted officials deign to take pity and review this plea, absolving all my past and present transgressions, countless as they are. Grant that my body be delivered from the thousand calamities and ten thousand perils, that I may serve as an attendant jade youth or maiden of the scriptures, as an inner or outer inspector of summons, as a lord of the Four Quarters and Nine Wilds, as a true official of the sacred mountains and domains, as a minister of the Five Emperors and Five Peaks. May my body’s Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries, the Flying Celestial Envoys, the celestial steeds of the heavenly offices, the guardians of the ten directions, and all officials—past and present, encountered along the way—who have aided in transmission, proclamation, and transformation, see their heartfelt vows fulfilled. May their merits be reported to the heavenly courts, their ranks advanced, their offices elevated, their merits recognized and promotions granted.

For great merit: three thousand grades.
For middling merit: two thousand grades.
For lesser merit: one thousand grades.
For scribes and minor clerks, soldiers and attendants: five hundred grades each.
May all return to the Central Palace.
May the exalted officials distribute rewards in due time, ensuring fairness and leaving none aggrieved or resentful.

Once the merit is recorded, may each return to their post, safeguarding my body, warding off the thousand poisons, public and private slander, the schemes of evil men, and all that lurks hidden in the Great Yin.

Unworthy of such boundless grace, I offer this in token of my devotion.

Humbly beseeching the Most High to distinguish and pity this foolish subject, I respectfully dispatch, through the true envoys of the inner and outer assemblies, the *Zheng Yi* Merit Envoys, the left and right official messengers, the yin-yang divine decree clerks, the chariot officers of the red talismans, the couriers of the fierce winds, the mounted memorial officers, and the flying dragon cavalry—twelve each—to present this memorial of merit and petition, one copy, to the Three Heavenly Courts, awaiting their decree.

Your subject [Name], trembling with awe, bows twice and respectfully submits this.

Your subject’s surname belongs to [Prefecture], [County], [Abbey].
*Taiqing* holds the rank.
In the year of the *Tai Sui*.

Your subject, having completed the covenant rites, now invokes the celestial and terrestrial deities. As they return to the Nine Heavens, may they ascend in due order. The *Yu Xu* True Qi Merit Envoys within this subject’s body, along with the divine transcendents’ mounts, shall proceed in their customary ranks, entering through the wondrous gate and golden portal of the Purple Mansion’s Jade Pavilion. They shall encircle the body, entwining the hundred meridians and bone joints, inwardly filling them with immortal *qi*, outwardly sealing off all sources of evil, refining the soul and preserving essence, that this subject may soon attain flight and transcendence. The transcendents’ feathered mounts shall ascend directly to the Imperial Throne.

Swallow the twenty-four *qi* and pause.

Next, the Dharma Master returns to the incense burner and prays:

"Fragrant Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials—may this place of transmission naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and jade blossoms. May the hundred numinous transcendents gather here before this incense altar, that this subject may attain the Dao and swiftly achieve transcendence. May disciples [Names] and their households, both within and without, receive blessings. May the ten directions’ immortal youths and jade maidens, guarding the fragrant smoke, convey this subject’s supplications directly to the Jade Emperor’s throne."

Next, recite the *Precepts Hymn*:

The Dao is the heartless source,
All acts become fields of merit.
One cessation—no fixed measure,
Each vow arises from the self.
Empty the self to respond to beings,
Focus the mind without partiality.
Great sages exalt the true teaching,
As rain descends from heaven.
Lofty and boundless in reach,
Yet humble, thus forming the abyss.
The sea is king of all rivers,
For it can forsake even dragon scales.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom endures—
Not merely for one’s years.
Uphold the precepts without lapse,
Lifetimes of good karma bound.
With concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the Dao’s truth.

Recite the *Returning Precepts Hymn*:

The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,
Expounds the precepts to deliver beings.
Majestic virtue pervades the hidden and manifest,
Karmic retribution moves the true numina.
All heavens bow in reverence,
All demons restrain their forms.
The past transcends the eight difficulties,
The present preserves a thousand years.
When the merit of the fast is complete,
Together we send forth our devotion.
The drifting *brahmā* chant soars on clouds,
Incense and fragrant smoke intermingle.
Jade phoenixes ride cinnabar carriages,
Golden dragons draw emerald chariots.
In life and death, all find joy,
Families and nations all know peace.

When finished, master and disciples circumambulate the altar, chanting *brahmā* hymns, and conclude the rites.

Alternatively, the master may return to the incense burner and perform the *Ascending Heaven and Treading Earth* rites upon the august altar. Then, master and disciples chant *brahmā* hymns as they exit through the northwest gate of the Nine Heavens—without looking back.

The *Treading Earth* talisman for dissolving form is inscribed in blue on white silk. The *Ascending Heaven* talisman for concealment is inscribed in yellow on green silk.

Some masters say: Before declaring merit, perform the rites in full. Then lead the disciples to face north and bow four times toward the Supreme Jade Throne of the Most High. Next, face east and bow twice to the Great Emperor Lord. Then face south and bow twice to the Highest Perfected. Next, face west and bow twice to Heavenly Master Zhang. After three days, the disciples may declare their merit, hold a fast to give thanks, and follow the separate scroll for the rites.

Next, the disciples perform the *Tally Tablet* rite in the direction of their natal destiny at the altar. Facing east, they knock their teeth three times, offer incense, and pray:

"Most High Lord Lao, Primordial Three Qi of the Three Heavens, summon forth from this subject’s body the Three and Five Merit Envoys, Left and Right Official Messengers, Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens Attending the Incense, Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and Direct-Day Fragrant Officials—thirty-six each. Open and notify the local earth deities and the true officials and divine spirits of the four directions. As this subject now burns incense and makes this notification, may the true *qi* of the Ten Directions’ Perfected enter this body, that this petition may ascend directly to the throne of the Most High, Perfect, and Greatly Sagely Divine Lord and Jade Emperor."

When finished, turn to face the king and knock the teeth twelve times. After reading the tally, pray:

"Heaven unfolds, earth extends,
Nine *qi* divide the numinous.
Three Origins share the tally,
Ten Directions’ Mystic Purity.
Five Elder Thearchs,
Open the true and lead the living.
Cinnabar script and vermilion writ,
Primordial essence of the Highest Origin—
Universally proclaim to the Supreme,
Nine Lands’ August Spirits.
Today is supremely auspicious,
Myriad transcendents fix their destiny.
I vow my transcendence,
Plead to inscribe my jade name.
Earth Mansion’s Great August,
Erase my sinful form.
Present the tally to the Upper Palace,
Inscribe it in the Azure Register.
Swiftly attain flight and ascension,
Heaven and earth share the numinous.
Nine generations of kin,
Rotten bones renewed in glory.
Souls ascend to the Southern Palace,
Transformed in the Transcendents’ Court.
Today I declare my mandate,
All spirits heed my words.
With golden seals I affirm
My utmost sincerity.
As I have declared, so let it be—
Golden dragons speed the courier’s way."

When finished, offer incense and return to the incense burner, following the above method.

The *Primordial Numinous Treasure* addresses the Nine Earths’ Earth Augusts, erasing sins and inscribing names to seek transcendence.

The *Numinous Treasure* and *Red Thearch* Master, female Daoist [Name], aged [X] years, born in the [X] month, destiny linked to the Southern Dipper’s register under the Nine Heavens.

Explanation: This text refers to the *Red Thearch* as one born in the *bing-wu* year, and "destiny linked to the Nine Heavens" as one born in the first or second month. The *Southern Dipper* governs the direction of one’s natal destiny; the rest follows this pattern.

Vowing to become a transcendent, to attain long life and deliverance from the world, to soar to the Upper Clarity, the Nine Lands’ Central August, the *wu-ji* Yellow Spirits, and the Five Thearchs of the Earth Mansion—beg to erase the record of sins, inscribe it in the Great Mystery, and present the tally to the Central Palace. The golden seal serves as proof, and golden dragons speed the transmission.

In the year of the *Tai Sui* [X], the [X] month, the [X] day, this document is declared in [Prefecture], [Subprefecture], [County], [Village].

Inscribe in vermilion on a silver tally, wrap it in blue paper, and bind it with nine blue silk knots and one golden dragon. Bury it in the central palace of the dwelling.

Next, present the spirit tablet, inscribe the tablet, and bury it in the corresponding direction of the altar. Alternatively, cast it into mountain caves, deep springs, or abysses—let no one retrieve it.

Each tally is one foot two inches long, two inches four *fen* wide, and three *fen* thick.

The ritual offerings for ascending the altar are as follows:

Twenty-four thousand cash (or equivalent in bronze coins or treasures).
Nine taels of gold.
One bolt each of five-colored silk.

Five large mats.
Five sets of compounded incense, each set comprising two *dou* and five *sheng*.
Five incense burners.
A seven-chaptered table.
One crimson-patterned cloth.
One five-*chi* double-layered azure-patterned cloth.
One five-*chi* double-layered cloth with five-colored scattered floral patterns, one *dou* in quantity.
Life-destiny silk, its length matching the recipient’s age in *chi*.

For those born in the first or second month: their register belongs to the Azure Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Nine-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.
For those born in the fourth or fifth month: their register belongs to the Cinnabar Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Three-*Qi* Lords.
For those born in the seventh or eighth month: their register belongs to the White Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Seven-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.
For those born in the tenth or eleventh month: their register belongs to the Black Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Five-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.
For those born in the third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth month: their register belongs to the Yellow Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the One-*Qi* Heavenly Lord.

According to the month of the ordination rite:
In the first or second month, state: “Now in the Three-*Qi* Heaven.”
In the fourth or fifth month, state: “Now in the Three-*Qi* Heaven.”
In the seventh or eighth month, state: “Now in the Seven-*Qi*.”
In the tenth or eleventh month, state: “Now in the Five-*Qi* Heaven.”
In the third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth month, state: “Now in the One-*Qi* Heaven.”

The *Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Rite of Ordination* concludes.

The *Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Rite of Ordination* states in the *Huanglu Jianwen Lingxian Section*:
Those who receive scriptures and methods must ordain nineteen disciples for the Three Masters, establishing merit and virtue so their names are recorded in the heavens. Only then may they ascend the altar to pledge alliance and receive the Five Elders’ Red Writ of the True Script in Jade Chapters, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, and the celestial steeds and offices of the Upper Perfected.
Those who fail to establish merit yet recklessly receive the Great Law will be seized by the Three Offices, facing bitter retribution in life and death, and examined by the Court of Illuminating the Law.

The *Mingzhen Code* states:
The pledge requires twenty-four thousand cash to secure the twenty-four *qi* life-officials.
If this solemn pledge is lacking, the gods of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries will not register the person’s destiny.
If gold cash is unavailable, bronze may be used as substitute.
If entirely lacking, the case is referred to the General Divine Bureau.

The *Mingzhen Code* states:
Five taels of refined gold are used to pledge the Five Marchmounts as a token of the precious scriptures.
The *Jade Decisions* states:
Nine taels of refined gold are offered to swear an oath to the Nine Heavens; deficiency incurs the penalty of disrespecting the scriptures.
The Five Marchmounts and sacred mountains will not register the learner’s name, and the case is referred to the Dark Bureau.

The *Mingzhen Code* states:
Forty *chi* of five-directional patterned silk are used to invoke the Five Thearchs as a token of the pledge.
If lacking, the Five Thearchs will not accept the person’s name, and the Five Thearch Demon-Kings will disrupt them, causing their resolve and thoughts to falter. The case is referred to the Water Bureau’s Springs and Bends Court.

The *Mingzhen Code* states:
Three gold dragons and three gold knots are cast into mountains, waters, or earth as a token of immortal study.
If not cast, the Three Offices will seize the person’s destiny register, and their prayers will not reach the heavens.
Violations are referred to the Nine Capitals Bureau.

The *Jade Key* states:
Tear five *chi* of Southern Harmony Elixir silk—crimson-patterned silk—to make a cloth for the altar table, upon which the *Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure True Writ* and the Five Talismans are invoked.

The *Jade Key* states:
Cut five *chi* of Azure Grove silk—blue-patterned silk—to make a cloth to cover the True Writ and talismans.

The *Jade Key* states:
Place the True Writ and Five Talismans between the blue and crimson silks, forming a covenant of tonsure and blood-oath. The blue silk substitutes for hair, the crimson for the blood-oath; thus the perfected ones avoid harming their spirit and depleting their virtue.

The *Jade Key* states:
Five blended incenses—though the scripture does not specify the quantity, two *dou* and five *sheng* are customarily sufficient. Additionally, prepare one *dou* of five-colored mixed flowers, to be scattered in the ten directions during the perfected one’s ordination. Five large mats, a seven-patterned altar table, five incense burners with lidded boxes, and a lifespan silk matching the initiate’s age in *chi*.

The eight items above are used for the altar rites as tokens of the pledge.

The *Jade Key* states:
In spring, use *jiayin* and *yimao* days; in summer, *dingsi* and *bingwu*; during the four seasons, *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jiwei*, and *jichou*; in autumn, *gengshen* and *xinyou*; in winter, *guihai* and *renzi*. Ascend the altar on the day of the establishing sovereign.

The *Jade Key* states:
Construct a high altar on a sacred peak, with railings on four sides. Open five gates at the east, west, south, north, and center, each marked with a placard bearing the following inscriptions:

**Nine Qi Azure Heaven, Peaceful Treasure Florescence Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder Lord; Azure Thearch Lord; Nine Qi Azure Molar Heavenly Lord; Supreme Perfected Jade Azure Waist Jade Maiden; Eastern Quarter Spirits and Officials.**
*Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.*
Inscribed in blue on red ground, placed above the eastern gate.

**Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven, Brahma Treasure Prosperous Yang, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder Lord; Vermilion Thearch Lord; Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lord; Primordial Qi Elder; Vermilion Palace Supreme Cinnabar Jade Maiden; Southern Quarter Spirits and Officials.**
*Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.*
Inscribed in red on yellow ground, placed above the southern gate.

**Primordial Cavern Supreme Thearch, Heavenly Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder Lord; Supreme Thearch Perfected One; Purple Cinnabar Yellow Court *Wu-Ji* Heaven Azure Jade Maiden; Central Yellow Great Thearch Official Lord.**
*Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate.*
Inscribed in yellow on white ground, placed above the central gate.

**Seven Qi White Heaven, Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder Lord; White Thearch Lord; Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master; Supreme White Plain Jade Maiden; Western Quarter Spirits and Officials.**
*Passage Yin Golden Watchtower Gate.*
Inscribed in white on black ground, placed above the western gate.

**Five Qi Mysterious Heaven, Cavern Yin Northern Solitude, Profound Five Numinous Mysterious Elder Lord; Black Thearch Lord; Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord; Supreme Numinous Lord; Night Radiance Jade Maiden; Northern Quarter Spirits and Officials.**
*Yin Birth Vast Numinous Gate.*
Inscribed in black on blue ground, placed above the northern gate.

**Nine Heavens’ Multitudes of Spirits, Perfected Ones of the Five Marchmounts and Sacred Mountains, Spirits and Officials of the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Seas, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens, Flying Immortals of the Five Marchmounts, and all Divine Immortal Lords.**
*Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate.*
Inscribed in purple on yellow ground, placed to the left of the central gate.

To the right, six placards are affixed above the five gates, with one placard each positioned at the eastern, western, southern, and northern gates according to their respective directions. Above the central gate, the symbols for *wu* and *ji* are displayed, while the two placards of the Nine Heavens are placed to the left and right of the gate. Five incense burners are arranged within the altar. Beneath the five tables, five-colored silken banners corresponding to the five directions are laid out. Additionally, a separate table is set at the center of the altar to receive the *True Writs* and the *Five Talismans Scripture*. Another table is prepared for submitting memorials and conducting rituals, making a total of seven tables. Gold and coin offerings are arrayed before the ritual table.

The *Yellow Register Simplified Writs* states: Those who receive the teachings must adhere to the luminous statutes, present their credentials to the master, and observe a seven-day fast. They shall submit a memorial on yellow silk, petitioning the heavens for the sacred texts. The altar is exposed to the open air for one night; if no wind stirs the *qi* and the writs remain unshaken, the candidate’s bone name is deemed fitting, and the transmission proceeds after the oath. If the wind disturbs the writs, the candidate must retreat and fast for three more days, then repeat the procedure as before. Should the wind disrupt the ritual three times, and the candidate lacks a celestial name or meritorious deeds, the Three Realms will not record them, the Five Thearchs will not protect them, their bone and *qi* will be deemed unfit, and the teachings shall not be lightly transmitted. This is examined and verified by the Bureau of Rectification.

The great oath of the *Numinous Treasure* requires the sacred writs to be exposed overnight. The sequence for presenting the memorial and invoking the officials is as follows:

Once the altar is established at the sacred mountain site, the master and disciple enter through the earthly portal, circling left. The master enters the inner altar’s royal gate, facing north to offer three pinches of incense. First, the two registers of the disciple’s received *True Writs* are placed upon the table. The disciple proceeds to the outer altar, faces south, turns north, and bows three times, prostrating to present the memorial. The master sounds the celestial drum thirty-six times. Next, the incense burner is kindled according to ritual, and the officials are invoked.

With reverence, the five visceral true officials and functionaries within this servant’s body are summoned forth; the flying immortals of the Three Caverns within this servant emerge—eleven each of the *Yin-Yang* Functionaries of the Upper Three Heavens, Enforcers of the Dao, Transformers of Civilization, Dispensers of the Way, Dissolvers of Disasters, Dispersers of Calamities, and Resolvers of Adversities. The high perfected officials governing this servant’s body, the *Great General of Established Authority and Surveillance of Merit* under the charge of so-and-so, the *Vanguard Effectors of Merit* and *Rearguard Effectors of Execution*, the *Commandant* and *Vice-Commandant of the Courier Court*, the *Fourfold Inspectors of Merit and Envoys*, the *Immortals and Numinous Direct Envoys* within this servant’s body, the *Orthodox Unity Functionaries*, the *Healing Functionaries*, the *Left and Right Palace Envoys*, the *Yin-Yang Spirit-Decision Officers*, the *Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers*, the *Sturdy Wind Courier Post Riders*, and the *Memorial-Presenting Officers*—two each—emerge.

Those who emerge don their solemn regalia and ceremonial robes, caps and pendants, arraying their majestic presence. The *Direct Envoy Functionaries* wear the *Crown of Penetrating Heaven*, clad in black, holding unlined garments. The *Orthodox Unity Functionaries* don the *Crimson Yang Turbans* and vermilion unlined robes. The *Envoys* wear the *Nine-Virtue Caps* and five-colored *Longevity Unlined Robes*, girded with tiger-seal belts, left side bearing *Flowing Gold Fire Bells*, right side bearing the *Seven Origins of the Vast Expanse*, all grasping jade tablets.

The *Direct Envoy Functionaries* stand at the center; the *Healing Functionaries* guard and protect this servant’s body. The *Left Palace Envoys* hold banners at the fore; the *Right Palace Envoys* raise standards at the rear. The *Yang Spirit-Decision Officers* stand to the left; the *Yin Spirit-Decision Officers* stand to the right. The *Upper Functionaries* gaze afar toward the heavens; the *Middle Functionaries* survey the eight directions; the *Qi-Urging Functionaries* hasten the ten quarters; the *General Palace Envoys* encircle this servant’s body.

The *Tiger-Rushing Officials*, the *Inspectors of Treachery and Hook-Riding Generals*, the *Commanders of the Palace Servants*, the *Celestial Armored Soldiers*, the *Celestial Ding Warriors*, the *Qi-Gathering and Qi-Consuming Officers*, the *Spirit-Gathering and Spirit-Consuming Officers*, the *Ghost-Gathering and Ghost-Consuming Officers*, the *Essence-Gathering and Essence-Consuming Officers*, the *Toxin-Gathering and Toxin-Consuming Officers*, the *Evil-Gathering and Evil-Consuming Officers*, the *Talisman-Executing and Shrine-Destroying Officers*, the *Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers*, the *Sturdy Wind Courier Post Riders*, the *Memorial-Presenting Officers*, and the *Flying Dragon Riders* take their stations before and behind this servant and retinue.

Once the *Left and Right Functionary Envoys* have completed their solemn preparations, they array the regalia and insignia, summoning the officials of the *Numinous Treasure*, the *Perfected Kings Overseeing the Retreat*, the *Attendants of the Canonical Scriptures*, the *Marshal Guardians of the Numinous*, the various lords, officials, generals, and functionaries of the Three Caverns, the twenty-four *Zhi* established by the Heavenly Master below, the thirty-six *Jing* hermitages, the seventy-two blessed lands, the three hundred sixty renowned mountains including Kunlun, and the over thirty-six thousand upper officials of the heavens. The sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the *Xuanji* and *Yuheng* constellations; the Five Thearchs of Heaven and Earth; the officials, lords, generals, and functionaries of the Three Realms; the *Two Mysteries*, *Three Origins*, *Four Beginnings*, and the *Qi*-infusing officials of the four directions, orientations, winds, and cyclical signs; the summoned *Nine Yi Hu Elders of the East*, the *Eight Man Yue Elders of the South*, the *Six Rong Shi Elders of the West*, the *Five Di Qiang Elders of the North*, the *Three Qin Cang Elders of the Center*; the lords of the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, hills, and marshes; the lords of all shrines, the *Meng* elders of high mountains and low valleys, forests and groves; the *Twelve Stream Women*; the original landlords of roots and sources; the generals and functionaries of the altars of soil and grain—all at once don their solemn regalia, joining the functionary envoys and *Flying Dragon Riders* within this servant’s body to ascend and address the *Supreme Venerable of the Mysterious Origin*, the *Supreme Lord of the Great Dao*, the *Supreme Elder*, the *Unsurpassed Mysterious Elder*, the *Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions and Boundless Great Dao*, the *Virtuous and Perfect Great Thearchs*, the *Heavenly Thearchs*, the *Heavenly Masters*, the *Female Masters*, the *Three Masters*, the *Lords and Ladies*, their attendants handling the twelve documents, those who process memorials and manage affairs—this servant humbly entrusts to them the *Numinous Treasure Great Rites*, the *Numinous True Writs*, the *Two Registers of the Eight Effulgences’ Inner Sounds*, and the *Yellow Plain Memorial*—one set placed upon the jade table, respectfully submitted for perusal.

The summoning of the officials is complete. Next, the memorial is read aloud.

Next, the solemn reaffirmation of the charge.

The true officials of the five constituents within this servant’s body, each with their minor clerks and the twelve document handlers, shall don their ceremonial attire—crowns, sashes, and pendent tassels—and promptly present this servant’s memorial of the revealed and true scriptural texts, ascending to the Supreme Lord’s court to submit and respond according to the matter at hand. Should any character be miswritten, let it be corrected; should any be omitted, let it be supplied. If words are inverted or disordered, pursue and rectify them, ensuring all conforms to the highest standard, so that no superior office may reprove or reject it. Let the host of demons of the Six Heavens and the residual qi of subordinate offices sever and intercept the official documents no longer; let them distinguish and transmit the memorials in due course, that they may ascend and be reported in time. Then, rise and face north, strike the teeth nine times, and invoke:

O Most High Primordial Origin, Spiritually Venerable of the Nine Heavens,
Supreme Perfected of the Mysterious Beyond, whose Dao abides in the jade pavilion,
As the Three and Five revolve and the Seven Luminaries alter the dawn,
The Void Sovereign reins in the chariot, the Five Thearchs ordain transcendence.
The Azure Palace gathers the verdant, the talismanic mandate issues from the numinous mountain.
On this day of primal auspiciousness, the myriad perfected open the array.
The initiates of ranks Jia and Yi, bound by karmic conditions of former lives,
Have encountered the divine scriptures, the precious chapters of the Supreme Thearch.
Reverently, upon the Mysterious Peak, they pledge alliance with the Nine Heavens,
Proclaiming below to the Five Thearchs and the twelve river sources,
Beseeching registration and receipt, to memorialize the exalted court above,
Universally announcing to the ten thousand spirits, arraying the ranks upon the imperial altar.
Let the guard and defense of the majestic ritual proceed as ordained by the Supreme Perfected.
The transmission shall await the dawn’s report.

Next, the officials are dismissed.
The *Merit Clerk Messengers* within this servant’s body, the *Register’s Generals and Clerks*, and the *Officials for Memorializing Above*—having fulfilled their duties—shall return into this servant’s body, those on the left to the left, those on the right to the right, securely abiding within the nine palaces and six repositories, the golden hall and jade chamber, the twelve mechanisms of the passes, coiling about the body and winding through the bones, safeguarding the hundred meridians. Should any overseer be charged with protecting this servant’s body, let the *Merit Clerks* sequentially inspect and verify, allowing no errors or omissions, until this servant summons them forth again, whereupon they shall act as before.

Sound the ritual drum three times, swallow the qi three times.
Then rise, bow twice, and replenish the incense burner according to the proper method.
When complete, the master and disciples exit through the earthly portal.

The next day, ascend the altar to proclaim the great alliance in due order.
At dawn, declare the completion of the merit. If the disciples are numerous, rearrange the altar as before.
Use six placards, placing them upon the five gates: one each at the eastern, southern, western, and northern gates according to their positions; at the royal gate, affix the *Wu-Ji* and *Nine Heavens* placards to the left and right of the gate.
The formula states: The central gate lies below the main gate at the *Ji* position—like *Chou* in spring; the gate of the assembled perfected lies above the main gate at the *Meng* position—like *Si* in spring. The rest follow accordingly.
If the disciples are few, use the fasting altar, adhering to the standard method of the *Yellow Register* fast.
Further adorn and purify the arrangement, ensuring all is meticulously prepared.
All requisite items for ascending the altar shall be fully assembled. Sound the bell, and the Dharma Master with the disciples approach the altar.
The *Three Masters* and *Five Guarantors*, clad in solemn ritual vestments, and the disciples, all in dark caps and yellow-brown robes, holding tablets and maintaining reverent order, with incense, flowers, and invocations, shall proceed entirely according to the proper method.

First, lead the disciples in circumambulating the altar three times, halting at the southeastern corner, facing west, and chanting the invocations without cease.
Next, lead the master in circumambulating the altar three times, halting at the northwestern corner.
The master withdraws thirty paces from the altar—or seven paces—then strikes the teeth thirty-two times, visualizing purple clouds veiling the crown.
For one altar or one mountain, the divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs, each one hundred thousand strong, come to receive this servant’s body, vivid and distinct.
Then invoke:

As the divine perfected set forth on their journey,
The myriad thearchs are startled,
The jade void’s mysterious guard,
The celestial lodges overturn.
The officials of the Five Peaks, none fail to lend their numinous aid.
Commanding the ten directions, driving the celestial soldiers,
Leading them from heaven below, all assemble at the imperial court,
That I may ascend to transcendence, penetrating the essence of the Dao.
Discerning what is inauspicious, plumbing the obscure and profound,
All that is directed and declared shall wholly accord with the Jade Purity.

When finished, ascend the altar slowly, entering through the northwestern celestial gate. Invoke according to the proper method.
Ascend to the central altar, circling left to face northwest, and bow nine times toward the Lord of the Nine Heavens. Having completed the obeisance, strike the teeth nine times and invoke:

This servant [Name] now transmits to disciple [Name] the precious scriptures of the Nine Heavens, the supreme jade taboo names. Having purified the fast and submitted the nocturnal memorial, with qi and destiny harmonized with the true, beseech the *Jade Perfected of the Lower Realm*, the *Attendant Gentleman of Records*, and the *Marshal of Numinous Guardians* to descend and oversee the alliance documents, as well as all that has been initiated and entrusted, that it may all ascend and be heard above.

Circumambulate the altar to the left, returning to face southeast, and bow twice.
Then proclaim:

The Most High Primordial Heavenly King, on this day we present the eightfold vows at the auspicious hour, reverently at the Dark Altar—or Mount of the Sacred Peak. We transmit the *Alliance Scripture of the Dark Mystery*, beseeching the Five Divine Mountains of the Emperors to descend and oversee this servant’s oath, that we may swiftly be granted immortality, ascend on flying chariots, and rise to the Imperial Dawn.

Having completed this, the Dharma Master leans forward, then commands the disciple to enter the central altar through the southeastern earthly gate, facing northwest to bow nine times. When finished, the Master circumambulates left to stand at the earthly gate, while the disciple circumambulates left to stand at the heavenly gate, turning to face southeast. They bow twice, then prostrate facing north with heads to the south. The Master turns to face north, strikes the teeth thirty-six times, and recites the *Golden Perfected Vast Emptiness Chapter* to subdue the myriad demons. Its words are:

Heavenly demons surge through the void,
Myriad spirits startle the divine court.
Assuming forms in songs and chants,
They shift and enter the nameless.
How clamorous their chaotic qi,
Defiling the Way as they arise along the path.
Within the clouds they dwell in crimson palaces,
While the Northern Emperor deploys his divine troops.
The drum’s resonance knows its own course,
The Dark Mandate comes to summon them.
The Upper Radiance reins the flying steeds,
Swift chariots inspect the cloud encampments.
Hastening the Northern Emperor’s records,
They seize and bind the names of the demon hordes.
The *Huoluo* unfurls the celestial nets,
Unleashing might and casting the ringing bells.
The Golden Perfected aids the hollow vastness,
Jade light illumines the eight darknesses.
The Golden Mystery guards the Upper Palace,
Divine tigers slay the celestial essences.
Severing the qi of the ten thousand perils,
All countless billions are pacified as one.
Upholding the Nine Heavens’ trust,
Their whistled commands leave none unbowed.
Summoning the Perfected to fathom the Three Caverns,
Wisdom’s recitation shines with clarity.
The Eight Paths gaze upon the Dark Text,
Seven revolutions weave the Heavenly Scripture.
Merging with the Imperial Unity of the One True,
Delivering the seven generations of ancestors.
Eradicating the roots of the five sufferings,
Returning souls to receive renewed glory.
Golden light blazes in the chamber of stillness,
Divine candles kindle of themselves.
Fragrant blossoms scatter through the Jade Universe,
Misty qi penetrates the Jade Capital.
The Emperor dispatches his lingering chariot,
The Three Origins descend in green carriages.
Swift steeds soar through the Nine Mysteries,
Attending our court in the Jade Emperor’s palace.

When finished, they circumambulate left, the disciple following the Master through the heavenly gate into the inner altar—or entering through the heavenly gate. They circumambulate left, then offer incense to the five directions, beginning in the east and circling back to the west, facing east. The Dharma Master closes his eyes, inwardly visualizing and perceiving the five viscera, five sacred peaks, five stars, and five emperors, all guarding within his body, their radiance covering him as one. His body becomes golden, emerging from behind the lungs, his neck crowned with a halo like the sun, illuminating the ten directions. Within his body, all is clearly seen, both inside and out.

Then he recites the invocation to the Guardian Spirit of Numinous Might:

Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Radiant Star Great Spirit,
Shining upon the eastern quarter, illuminating the nine gates,
Turning like a candle’s yang-light, sweeping away filth and banishing miasma.
Luminous Youth, guard my chariot,
Seizing demons and binding evil, ascending to face the Imperial Lord,
Upholding the true Dao, the vermilion script and jade texts,
The talismanic commands of the Nine Heavens, borne by dragon couriers,
Pacifying and securing all under heaven—
Thus I attain flight as an immortal.

South: Cinnabar Heaven of Three Qi, streaming with light,
The gleaming star turns like a candle, illuminating the Great Yang.
Above dwells the Crimson Essence, Luminous Youth of Spirit,
Commanding the hosts of fire, guarding the Three Palaces,
Severing evil and binding demons, shearing away demon kings.
Empowered by the Northern Emperor, the Eight Thrusts of Wind and Fire,
Interlocking bells blaze in radiance.
Should any dare disobey, the true Dao flows forth—
I partake of supreme merit, preserving heaven’s enduring existence,
For kalpas unending.

Heaven of Seven Qi, where Venus streams with essence,
Its light illumines the Golden Gate, brightening the Great Darkness.
Within dwells the White Sovereign, named Imperial Spirit,
Preserving and pacifying the numinous, guarding my form,
Cutting off the roots of evil, the kingly Dao shines forth in rectitude.
Palaces and dwellings stand ordered, the Three Luminaries aligned as one.
The Dao harmonizes with spontaneity—
I ascend in flight to the Purple Court,
By the talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure, universally benefiting all beings.
Merit extends to all, heaven and earth attain tranquility.

North: Mysterious Heaven of Five Qi, circling in procession,
The Morning Star blazes resplendent, its light illumining the Supreme Subtlety.
Black Numinous Honored Spirit, clad in flying dark feathers,
Guards the five gates, inspecting essences and seizing transgressors.
Should any dare challenge, the Vast and Falling Blade severs and shatters.
By the jade talisman’s decree, the Eight Might of the Divine,
The gates of evil are sealed, the true Dao shines forth in clarity,
Illuminating my body, the Three Lights gleam as one.
I spur the void and ride the floating clouds, my form ascending in immortal flight.

Yellow Center governs qi, unifying the mysterious and true,
Saturn emits its radiance, streaming and blazing through the Nine Heavens.
Twelve Luminous Youths, primordial qi and yang essence,
Flames rise in crimson smoke, together illuminating this chamber and my body.
A hundred evils are shattered, ten thousand ghosts slain.
The divine incantation of Mount Zhong spreads universally—
The Five Numinous Ones pacify and secure, my body ascends as an immortal.

Next, strike the teeth twenty-four times.

Next, kindle the incense burner and recite the invocation:
Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,
Summon forth from my body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the left and right attendants,
The left and right incense-bearing dragon couriers, the Jade Lads who tend incense,
The Jade Maidens who scatter flowers, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman and Direct Day Incense Officials—
Each thirty-six in number—
To emerge and report to the local earth deities and territorial spirits of this place.
I now, in this moment, burn incense and transmit the teachings,
Praying that the life-breath of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected Ones descend and infuse my body,
That my supplications swiftly ascend, directly presented before the True and Boundless Dao.

Next, the Master leads the disciple in circumambulating left, holding the petition tablet, facing west toward the east, and intoning the Heavenly Worthy of the East—each direction receiving three bows.
Alternatively, one bow may suffice, or the tablet may be omitted, simply intoning the directions in sequence.

Next, the South; then the West; then the North; then the Northeast; then the Southeast; then the Southwest; then the Northwest; then the Upper Realm; then the Lower Realm—each performed in the same manner.

We, with utmost sincerity, submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East,
The Azure Emperor, Lord of the Nine Qi of Heaven, and all the spirit officials of the eastern quarter.
[Disciple’s name and lineage] reverently presents this petition.
The same for all ten directions.

With utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest,
The Lord of the Primordial Mysterious Qi of Heaven, and all the spirit officials of the northwestern quarter.

With utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm at the Heavenly Gate,
The Celestial Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis, the Golden Watchtower of the Seven Treasures, the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Supreme Palace of the Thirty-Two Heavens,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Flying Brahma and Great Brahma Heavens, the Perfected Ones and Jade Maidens, and all the spirit officials of the upper realm.

With utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm at the Earthly Gate,
The August Sovereign of the Nine Lands, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the Yin-Yang Water Bureau and Twelve Immortal Officials,
The Heavenly Worthies of the Thirty-Six Earthly Primes of the Cavernous Abyss, Cavernous Void, and Cavernous Origin,
And all the spirit officials of the earthly realm.

With utmost sincerity, I, your servant, now follow the covenants of the Supreme Perfected and the precepts of the fast,
Ascending the altar, preparing the implements.
At the appointed hour yesterday, I presented the memorial to the numinous worthies,
Awaiting with sincere devotion in the jasper pavilion, the assembled spirits taking their places.
Thus the rains have ceased on this auspicious day, the winds stilled in this clear hour,
Extending through the Ten Heavens, the Three Qi streaming with light,
Majestic forms spreading like clouds, the supreme rites unfolding.
I, [disciple’s name], am profoundly fortunate, having aroused the causes most difficult to fulfill,
Presumptuously hoping for fruits most difficult to attain.
Diligently following the Dharma, I transmit the talismans from beginning to end,
Praying to avoid wind and rain, that after receiving them, I may proceed without hindrance.

Each kowtows and strikes the cheeks.

Next, with utmost sincerity, the Dharma Master takes his position, facing east, while the disciple returns to face east, prostrating westward on the ground.
The Dharma Master kneels lengthily and again strikes the teeth twenty-four times.

Summoning the officials:
With utmost sincerity, I summon forth the true officials of the five organs within my body,
And the twenty-four Flying Heavenly Immortal Officials of the Three Caverns, Eight Effulgences, and Eight Palaces of the Numinous Treasure and Cavernous Mystery—

Each takes their position and arrays themselves in the ten directions, scattering flowers and burning incense to encamp and attend the disciple’s person.

The perfected immortals, divine officials, troops, and cavalry assemble and station themselves before, behind, to the left, and to the right of your servant, arrayed in orderly ranks. Naturally arising five-colored plain clouds illuminate and shroud their forms, streaming essence and dispersing *qi* to fill the ten directions, encircling heaven and covering earth, encamping and guarding your servant’s body.

Once all preparations are complete, the Orthodox Unity Ascending Mystery Merit Officers, the Communicating Perfected and Conveying Destiny Flying Celestial Messengers, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Officers, bearing the Tablet of Mysterious Emptiness, stand before your servant. They receive the words from your servant’s mouth, distinguishing and transmitting them to the heavenly officials and earthly spirits of the upper and lower realms, the central and four directions, the eight quarters, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Waterways, the Nine Rivers, the Eight Poles, the famous mountains and great marshes, the true officials of the Five Thearchs, the Four Departments of Surveillance, the Nine Bureaus of Examination and Summoning, the various officials of the Primordial *Qi* of the Mysterious Origin and the *Jiǎzǐ* Calendar, the boundless, infinite, immeasurable, unfathomable, hidden, and manifest hosts of true officials who infuse *qi* into the Celestial Sovereign of *Qián*, the Perfected of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams and Six *Jiǎ* Deities, the lords of the root origin and fundamental beginning of the land, and the generals and officers of the altars and boundaries—all of whom now prepare in solemn array. Together with your servant’s merit officers and messengers, the Flying Dragon and Posting Dragon Cavalry, and the direct talismans and direct officers, they ascend to report before the August Jade Presence of the Supreme Primordial Origin, the Most High Great Dao, the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Perfected and Greatly Sage Honored Divine Lords, the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao, the Hosts of Sages and Heavenly Worthies, the Celestial Thearchs, the Great Thearchs, the Heavenly Thearchs, and the various officials of the Great Masters of the Mysterious Center.

By good fortune, through karmic conditions of past lives and the kalpas of the Nine Heavens extending to this present incarnation, your servant has encountered the luminous destiny of this era, when the great Dharma flows freely, and has been permitted, despite this defiled form, to partake in the sacred texts of the Upper Clarity Golden Writ and the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures. Since presumptuously receiving these teachings, your servant has revered the supreme Dharma, yearning in heart for the immortals, yet with shallow sincerity and feeble devotion, unable to move the numinous. Constantly fearing the advent of transgressions and the descent into the Nine Springs, yet through the vast compassion of heaven, your servant’s life has been preserved. It is only fitting to guard these humble capacities and dare not speak further.

Now, as the Three Caverns govern the turning of the cosmic wheel and the Numinous Treasure bestows its teachings below, the prior ranks of those who have been delivered and ascended leave celestial offices vacant, requiring worthy candidates from the middle realm to fill the heavens. From the day your servant received the Dharma, it was ordained to deliver others. Those with predestined names inscribed in the golden registers and jade records, who are destined to attain perfection, traverse the Eight Poles and come from the midst of emptiness and non-being. Now, there is one with a predestined mandate, the Perfected of a certain Marchmount, so-and-so, of such-and-such age, whose conduct is pure and whose bones and destiny align with perfection, having already received the sacred texts of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ. Though their understanding remains shallow and narrow, never having glimpsed the source of the Dao, their faith and devotion have been earnest and long-standing.

Today, they present offerings of golden silks and Dharma tokens, seeking to receive the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerables’ Vermilion Writ of the Jade Chapters, the Golden Writ and Purple Characters of the Jade Texts and Vermilion Scriptures, the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones’ Three Caverns and Eight Effulgences’ Charts of the Divine Immortals’ Mounts, the Inner Sounds of the Various Heavens’ Natural Jade Whip Records of Eight Characters, the divine staffs, and all other matters, the covenant-bound precious scriptures. They pledge their sincerity, making their supplication with the Nine Ancestors as witnesses, vowing to treasure these teachings as their own body and soul, binding themselves to no transgressions or violations.

Your servant, bound by the weight of the Dharma’s prohibitions, dare not lightly disclose these teachings. After thorough verification, their words prove ever more steadfast, and upon examining their sincere heart, it is deemed they may achieve success. Since the Dharma provides for deliverance, your servant dare not obstruct or sever this path. Accordingly, following the *Huanglu Simplified Writs and Numinous Immortal Regulations and Ranks*, your servant has fasted with them for three days, revealing the true texts under the open sky. Heaven is clear, earth is still, the four *qi* are tranquil, with no wind or dust—all in accord with the Dharma and attuned to perfection.

Now, respectfully adhering to the ancient canons of former masters, the essentials of the Illuminating Perfection Great Dharma and Jade Instructions are transmitted to so-and-so’s person, ascending together to the imperial altar. With golden silks to secure the numinous, your servant first reverently presents a scroll of yellow silk and vermilion memorial to the Nine Heavens, placing it upon the jade tablet for inspection and consideration. Next, the memorial is read aloud, and after three rounds of tooth-clicking, it is dispatched.

Your servant now dispatches the five bodily perfected immortals and their mounts, the repeatedly commanded merit officers and messengers, the reporting direct talismans and transmitting scribes, all in solemn attire, crowned and sashed with hanging tassels. They promptly carry your servant’s Dharma-conveying yellow silk and vermilion memorial to the presence of the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerable Thearchs and the Perfected and Greatly Sage Honored Divine Lords. Should any words be inverted or erroneous, or the texts deviate from the ancient Dharma, may they be corrected in accordance with the matter at hand, ensuring perfect alignment above, so that the officials and scribes of the upper realms suffer no reprimand. Should any demonic spirits, malevolent ghosts, or thieves intercept or obstruct the memorial, may they be seized and delivered to the local prisons, punished according to the offense.

May your servant’s memorial reach its destination above, and may all wishes be fulfilled. Humbly awaiting the gracious response, your servant prostrates in anticipation of the report.

Then the disciple turns left, faces south, while the master turns left to face north, and kneels lengthily. Thirty-six strikes of the drum are sounded. The Most High Numinous Treasure Supreme Cavern Mystery Dharma Master, so-and-so, your servant Yue so-and-so bows twice with head reverently lowered, and respectfully invokes the Celestial Canon Attendants of the Supreme Ultimate, the Jade Scribes of the Scriptural Bureau, the Inspector-Marshal of Ordination, the Four Directors and Five Thearchs, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, who grasp purple-feathered tablets and tenfold numinous banners, leading ten thousand spirits and a thousand perfected ones, with phoenix flutes sounding before them and celestial harmonies played behind, burning incense and scattering flowers as they descend together through the void. Heavenly ranks arrayed, they witness the ordination and the sworn covenant.

Your servant, relying upon the perfected immortals and transcendent officials, the flying dragon couriers, humbly addresses the Most High Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerable Thearchs, the Numinous Treasure Primordial Honored One, the Ten Directions’ Spontaneously Arisen Perfected, the Four Quarters’ Great Sages, the Golden Watchtower Thearch, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, the Three Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity, and the host of venerable ones beneath the Jade Towers of the Clear Mystery: your servant, base and foolish, a walking corpse of foul flesh, by accumulated fortune and karmic convergence, has encountered the true scriptures and been granted the honor of receiving the Three Caverns’ precious texts. The Dao is lofty, its principles subtle—far beyond what I can bear. Day and night I tremble in fear, my form and soul never at rest. Your servant, in utmost trepidation, kowtows again and again, prostrate with mortal transgression, prostrate with mortal transgression.

Your servant, unworthy and presumptuous, dares to offer these words. Reverently examining the august scriptures, so profound and weighty, their traces deep and their sources abstruse, they are truly not something a humble servant may presume to expound. Moreover, the luminous statutes and canonical regulations decree that transmission may only occur after five or eight hearings. Your servant has but newly received the Dharma and is unfit to proclaim it openly. Yet as the great kalpa nears its end, the world’s span shortens, fortune and misfortune alternate, and the Dao requires that the loyal and worthy be broadly initiated into the Dharma gate. Though the hearts of people today are shallow and false, truth and deceit difficult to discern, still those who sincerely aspire—though their merit be slight—may be recognized. If they diligently seek and their sincerity reaches, they must not be shut out.

Your servant, having previously presented a memorial above, now respectfully reports that the Perfected of such-and-such an Imperial Realm, so-and-so, is by nature compassionate and kind, his character pure and unsullied, his aspirations lofty, disdaining glory and splendor. He delights in emptiness and savors the true, yearning for immortality and revering the divine. He has followed the teachings of the Great Vehicle’s supreme Dharma, exhorting and guiding others, establishing virtue and merit, devoutly enduring hardship, tirelessly striving, drilling and toiling for years on end, his resolve fixed upon the source of the Dao. Now he presents golden silks and precious tokens, the requisites for receiving the true, swearing before the assembled ministers with his nine ancestors as witnesses, seeking to bear the Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Origin Five Venerable Thearchs’ Vermilion Script of True Writs and Precious Talismans, the twenty-four Perfected Divine Officials and Soldiers of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, the Jade Characters of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, the Eight Might Command Texts, the divine staff, and all other matters as your servant has witnessed.

So-and-so’s bone nature and resolve are fitting for accomplishment. Reverently following the ancient canons of the Luminous Perfected, a ritual arena is established, covenants are sworn before the Nine Heavens, and the transmission is conferred in accordance with the statutes. Let it be treasured as his personal jewel, never to be betrayed, lightly divulged, or treated with negligence, lest he sever his roots and destroy his lineage, his parents in life and death, and his own person, suffering the trials of the wind-blade and enduring ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. May the Most High Host of Venerables, the Ten Directions’ Sage Perfected, and the Four Directors and Five Thearchs clearly witness this sworn covenant. Respectfully submitted for your august consideration and enactment. Your servant, in utmost trepidation, bows twice with head reverently lowered.

Then the Dharma Master concludes the invocation. Thereupon he rises, and the disciple follows behind the master, offering incense thrice to the Five Directions, beginning in the east. At each direction, he kneels lengthily to present the incense. When the circuit is complete, he paces three times around the altar and scatters flowers in the ten directions. At that time, the Five Perfected Ones’ hymns of praise are chanted in full. The disciple bows twice and intones the benediction.

The Hymn of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One:
The Most High Lord of the Great Dao
Revealed the Numinous Treasure Scriptures.
Sublime and wondrous, beyond compare,
Like the mystery within mystery.
The spontaneous, non-actional Dao—
Those who study it ascend as high immortals.
Vast is the Cavernous Void Scripture,
Seated in peace, they attend the heavens.
Above, it treasures the Purple Tenuity Terrace,
Below, it conceals the famed mountains.
Resplendent with dragon and phoenix patterns,
Its radiance gleams in the spaceless.
Wondrous is the Most High Dao,
Non-action, ever spontaneous.
Kings, lords, and common folk—
All esteem only the loyal and worthy.
Those with karmic fortune from past lives,
Outstanding from former causes,
Masters transmit it in succession,
Precious tokens through kalpas of years.
Broadly mindful of delivering all,
Great fortune repays your person.
Those who make offerings will attain the Dao,
Those who uphold it become perfected immortals.
The Great Dao has no self or other—
Transmission must find its proper recipient.

The Hymn of the First Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:
From the Cavern Perfected emerge all wonders,
Resplendent, illuminating the Great Clarity.
Those who uphold it are called immortals,
Their bodies eternally enduring.
Carefree, they sport in the mysterious void,
Palaces arrayed beyond form.
Lush and radiant, the Seven Treasures Grove,
Luminous as the sun and moon’s essence.
Dragon scales intertwine in flight,
Phoenixes soar with mournful cries.
The Most High governs the Purple Terrace,
The host of perfected chant the Cavern Scripture.
Burning incense, they bow in reverence,
Circling the palace city.
Three circuits return to the high seat,
The Dao King responds in kind.
Should the lord of men magnify the supreme Dao,
The world will be universally at peace.

The Hymn of the Second Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:
Emptiness and constancy, ever spontaneous,
Forcibly named the Great Dao.
Vast and boundless, without limit,
All wonders return to the Numinous Treasure.
Closing the eyes, one contemplates the Perfected,
With concentrated thought, the Ten Venerables descend.
Ascending as immortals, forever non-active,
Their numinous countenances eternally wondrous.
Thirst quenched with jade pool nectar,
Hunger sated with golden radiance herbs.
Serene wisdom transcends the eight difficulties,
Delivering the world from all suffering and affliction.

The Hymn of the Third Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:
Wondrous are the Numinous Treasure Scriptures,
The Most High’s spontaneous texts.
Those who uphold them attain immortality,
Called the true Heavenly Honored Ones.
Charged with proclaiming the Dao’s teachings,
Truly they surpass worldly talent.
Their tasks complete, they ascend as divine immortals,
Their palaces govern the Mysterious Terrace.
At times they descend Mount Kunlun,
Carefree, they rest on Penglai.

The Hymn of the Most High Orthodox Unity Perfected, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Celestial Master:
The Numinous Treasure and the Great Cavern—
The supreme king of the true Dao scriptures.

Should one possess the five thousand characters,
Lofty and wondrous, peerless in the world,
Their practice establishes ascent to immortality,
Dwelling in mystery, they govern the void.
They attend and guard the Terrace of the Most High,
Carefree, they wander the Purple Tenuity Palace.
Ten thousand kalpas pass like a flash of lightning,
Yet they endure, ever without end.
The Dao-eye now fully complete,
Vast and unobstructed, they commune with the unseen.
The obscure and dim hold no secrets,
Seated in stillness, they observe the ten directions.

When the recitation concludes, the Dharma Master’s disciples each return to their positions, facing north and south, and unfold the true script upon the altar. The Master recites the preface to the true script, after which the disciples bow again. Then, following the jade instructions, they articulate the correct pronunciation, explaining each character and transmitting the oral transmission for recitation.

The disciples receive the oral instructions:
In the East, establish the Treasure Florescence Grove of the Azure Numinous Beginning Elder and the Nine Qi Azure Heaven’s Red Script.

"Supreme Lord’s Supreme One tablet,
True scripture inscribed by the Yellow Emperor."

**Further Instructions:**
"Wisdom’s numinous power opens the flood’s deliverance of humanity."

Next, visualize: ahead, a flying dragon leads; behind, the Celestial Balance guides. Phoenixes shriek and simurghs cry, twelve resplendent lights arise. Erect the banner of three-seven colored nodes, the life-spirit’s standard, and assign twelve jade lads and lasses of the Five Thearchs to each. The Five Thearchs’ attendants, the Three Realms’ overseers welcome; the disciple receives the memorial, kneeling long before the master.

**Decree to the Host of Talismans:**
"East-flowing waters,
meander through the Five Cities.
The *po* enters, the *hun* departs,
refining the body’s form.
So-and-so receives and upholds
the numinous treasures’ host of talismans,
to attain everlasting life.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Supreme Lord’s statutes and ordinances."

Next, seal both ends of the memorial and invoke:
"Primal Beginning, Supreme Perfected,
Five Numinous Ones of lofty honor,
Great Flower’s luminous radiance,
penetrating brightness of the Eight Gates,
Five Elders proclaim the mandate,
no hidden place unheard.
Above, they govern the Nine Heavens;
in the middle, they restrain Mount Feng;
below, they pacify rivers and seas,
the twelve water sources.
Eight Might divine incantations,
numinous memorial of jade script,
summon dragons to bear water,
gather *qi* and amass clouds,
bind demons and dispatch ghosts,
sweep away and scatter pernicious hordes.
Myriad spirits are shattered and felled,
none spared from execution.
Sun, moon, and Five Planets,
Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins,
all heavens, all earths,
all waters, all mountains,
jade perfected ones’ retinue,
Mingling Cold’s great deities,
immortal kings at their banquets,
Five Thearchs’ staff-banners,
celestial soldiers lead the vanguard,
golden tigers rush in pursuit,
heavenly ferocious beasts,
arrayed to guard the four gates.
Those called arrive at once;
those summoned stand forthwith.
Crimson script blazes and scatters,
wind and fire unceasing.
Whatever is seized or verified
is transmitted by golden dragon couriers."

Upon completing the invocation, strike the teeth nine times, raise the head and roar thrice to heaven, then draw in *qi* and swallow three times to conclude. Seal the memorial with the Primal Beginning Five Elders’ seal.

**Next, the Staff-Sealing Method:**
Strike the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Five Thearchs’ scribes, each clad in the color of their direction, their five-colored lights streaming and blazing upon the staff. Each Thearch’s jade maiden, one to each, together guards the staff on left and right.

Conclude by first holding the staff horizontally before the master, its head pointing left—this the master performs.

Next, the master grasps the Green Thearch’s talisman and commands the disciple to observe.
**Instructions:**
"The Green Thearch’s surname is Ou, given name Gengsheng."
Having recited this, he hands it to the disciple. The disciple, receiving the talisman, faces east, strikes the teeth nine times, and visualizes green *qi* entering from the mouth to infuse the liver, where nine layers of green blossoms bloom, their precious light penetrating and illuminating the nape. Conclude, then return the talisman to the master, who places it into the first aperture above.

Having done so, the master invokes:
"Peerless azure essence,
Nine *qi* of supreme numinosity,
divine light spreads afar,
streaming to illumine the Eastern Azure.
Flourishing splendor of blossoms,
irrigating your body’s form,
palace and precincts securely pacified,
precious *hun* naturally arises,
penetrating the Eight Brightnesses,
soaring to ascend the Jade Court."

Conclude; the disciple draws in *qi* and swallows nine times to finish.

Next, the master grasps the Red Thearch’s talisman and commands the disciple to observe.
**Instructions:**
"The Red Thearch’s surname is Zhu, given name Changzhong."
Having recited this, he hands it to the disciple. The disciple, receiving the talisman, faces south, strikes the teeth three times, and visualizes red *qi* entering from the mouth to infuse the heart, where three layers of cinnabar blossoms bloom, their precious light penetrating and illuminating the chest. Conclude, then return the talisman to the master, who places it into the second aperture above.

Having done so, the master invokes:
"Cinnabar blossoms stream with crystal,
precious mushrooms radiate light,
divine essence penetrates the hidden,
dispersing numinosity to the eight directions.
The straight talisman seizes *qi*,
roaring command to the Vermilion Lads.
Three essences resplendently unfold,
infusing your crimson palace.
The Red Spirit securely pacified,
five fragrances overflow and fill,
penetrating illumination beyond form,
inner and outer blazing with light.
Body generates water and fire,
walking alone in flight."

Conclude; the disciple draws in *qi* and swallows three times to finish.

Next, the master grasps the Yellow Thearch’s talisman and commands the disciple to observe.
**Instructions:**
"The Yellow Thearch’s surname is Si, given name Jing."
Having recited this, he hands it to the disciple. The disciple, receiving the talisman, faces the center, strikes the teeth twelve times, and visualizes yellow *qi* entering from the mouth to infuse the spleen, where twelve layers of yellow blossoms bloom, their precious light penetrating and illuminating the entire body. Conclude, then return the talisman to the master, who places it into the third aperture above.

Having done so, the master invokes:
"Governor of the Primal, lofty numen,
turning spirit to the four quarters.
Yellow blossoms scatter above,
Five Thearchs’ fragrances intermingle.
Essence streams and disperses,
twelve layers of light,
blending and merging with your form.
Myriad spirits come to welcome,
securely establishing the Yellow Spleen,
nurturing *qi* in the central chamber,
preserving longevity through kalpas,
eternally pacifying without end."

Conclude; the disciple draws in *qi* and swallows twelve times to finish.

Next, the master grasps the White Thearch’s talisman and commands the disciple to observe.
**Instructions:**
"The White Thearch’s surname is Ru, given name Quzheng."
Having recited this, he hands it to the disciple. The disciple, receiving the talisman, faces west, strikes the teeth seven times, and visualizes white *qi* entering from the mouth to infuse the lungs, where seven layers of white blossoms bloom, their precious light penetrating and illuminating the cinnabar field. Conclude, then return the talisman to the master, who places it into the fourth aperture above.

Having done so, the master invokes:
"Seven *qi* of golden numinosity,
white blossoms streaming in profusion.
Golden essence lads,
Dao established in the primal kerchief.
Bearing talismans to seize *qi*,
myriad spirits gather at the gate.
Precious light gleaming and glistening,
illuminating your meeting root.
Securely pacifying the lung’s blossom,
enduring through ten thousand kalpas."

Conclude; the disciple draws in *qi* and swallows seven times to finish.

Next, the master grasps the Black Thearch’s talisman and commands the disciple to observe.
**Instructions:**
"The Black Thearch’s surname is Xuan, given name Yin Feng."
Having recited this, he hands it to the disciple. The disciple, receiving the talisman, faces north, strikes the teeth five times, and visualizes black *qi* entering from the mouth to infuse the kidneys, where five layers of mysterious blossoms bloom, their precious light penetrating and illuminating the back’s exterior. Conclude, then return the talisman to the master, who places it into the fifth aperture above.

Having done so, the master invokes:
"Northern Supreme’s great mystery,
five *qi* meandering and lingering.
Five layers of precious blossoms,
streaming light blazing and radiant.
Numinous splendor lush and elegant,
penetrating illumination of the Grand Tenuity.
Raising to infuse your body,
the kidney’s precincts freshly open.
Securely pacifying the numinous abode,
myriad spirits wholly return.
Body sprouts feathered wings,
lifting form to fly of itself."

Having completed this, the disciple draws *qi* and swallows it five times, then ceases. Next, after inserting the talisman, he seals both hollow ends of the staff with red wax, impressing the upper end with the seal of the Primordial Beginning and the lower with the seals of the Five Elders. Done, the disciple strikes his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the five *Direct Talisman Officials of the Emperors*, each clad in robes matching their directional hue, their five-colored radiance streaming and blazing upon the staff; and the five *Jade Maidens of the Emperors*, one for each, together guarding the staff on left and right. The disciple then holds the staff horizontally as before. The master invokes:

"Mountain of the Great Yang,
Primordial Essence on high,
opening heaven and unfurling earth,
sweet bamboo channeling the numinous.
Direct Talisman Guardians,
marshaling divine soldiers,
five hues streaming and blazing,
crimson fire and golden bells,
assisting the perfected on high,
emerging from darkness and entering shadow.
Summoning the heavens, the heavens bow,
commanding the earth, the earth welcomes.
Pointing at ghosts, ghosts perish,
demons of heresy bound in form.
Numinous talisman, divine staff,
commanding all spirits with awe,
governing all directions,
living with me as one.
After ten thousand kalpas,
replacing my form,
its splendor the Five Liberations,
spirit ascending to the Upper Clarity.
Receiving the talisman and proclaiming the decree,
none dare disobey."

Done, he draws the *qi* of the five directions and swallows it twenty-five times, then ceases.

Next, the master proclaims the *Cinnabar Water Text*:

"Great Cavern Master of Such-and-Such Peak, your servant So-and-So, addresses his disciples So-and-So and others: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the vast and boundless, unfolded and expounded the true scriptures, weaving them into wondrous sutras. Kalpa after kalpa, salvation knows no end, like grains of sand or countless billions without cease. The numinous scriptures, profound and recondite, were hidden within the Golden Pavilion, revered by the assembled perfected, looked up to by all heavens. In the era of the Red Bird, they were bestowed upon the Immortal Duke, and thus the *Numinous Treasure Wondrous Sutra* emerged to deliver humanity.

I, by humble karmic affinity, have encountered these numinous scriptures. My late master, in manifesting their splendor, transmitted this supreme Dharma, which I vow to treasure as my own body—how dare I divulge it recklessly? Yet as kalpas turn and destiny shifts, the Dharma’s time has come to spread. To those who align with the true, I transmit it according to the rites.

Today, I swear before the Nine Heavens to bestow these scriptures upon So-and-So. After receiving them, you must adhere to the luminous precepts: purify yourself, discipline your body, cultivate sincerity and diligence, sever worldly ties, and aspire solely to the Great Vehicle. Make offerings, perform rites, study the profound mysteries, seek guidance from the enlightened, practice *daoyin* and refine your essence. Observe fasts, regulate your attire, and yearn for transcendence. Honor the Dao and revere your master, upholding the root with devotion. Do not feign reverence with hollow words, nor attack the very foundation of your being with reckless deeds. Do not slight the sacred scriptures, nor indulge in superficial piety, lust, greed, jealousy, or hatred. Do not harbor deceit in your heart or conceal malice within. Should you violate these vows even once, your body will sink into the Three Springs.

You, So-and-So, along with your three progenitors and five ancestors, shall together descend into the earthly prisons, lost for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Today, I establish the Yellow Altar, ally with the Five Emperors, and transmit the *Ten Sections of Treasured Scriptures* and the wondrous sutras. All heavens and the Five Peaks bear witness to this covenant. Examine your conduct, guard the Dharma, and hold it within your heart. Ascension to immortality may then be expected, and you shall ultimately attain the true Dao. Strive with solemnity, as prescribed in the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*."

Next, the disciple proclaims his own covenant:

"Disciple So-and-So of Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, Village, and Peak, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully addressing the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Venerable Deities of the Ten Directions, and the perfected who have attained the true Dao in all quarters.

The thirty-six sacred scriptures and talismans of the *Most High Numinous Treasure*, the supreme Dharma of the Great Master of the Lofty Mystery So-and-So, by karmic fortune and past blessings, have endured through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, unceasing and undying. Blessed by destiny and transformed by the wheel of rebirth, I was born into the Dharma’s gate. From an early age, I vowed to admire the supreme lineage, the great vehicle of the Dharma’s board, my spirit leaping with joy, dreading only the decay of this mortal frame.

Now, as heavenly destiny shifts and the imperial Dao’s number unfolds, I have been graciously uplifted by Master So-and-So, who enlightened my ignorance and bestowed upon me the numinous scriptures, allowing me to stand before the sagely lord. My flesh trembles with awe; I have cleansed my filth and impurities to attend the numinous altar, humbly receiving this exalted favor, a glory beyond my due.

I vow to discipline myself, purify my body, make offerings and pay reverence, cast aside worldly burdens, and entrust my aspirations to the hidden peaks. Forever forsaking the paths of the world, I dedicate myself solely to the mountains and cliffs. Day and night, I shall prostrate in worship, striving to exhaust my humble devotion, hoping that through the sacred scriptures, my decaying frame may be delivered. With utmost sincerity and single-mindedness, I shall harbor no second thoughts. I dare not violate this covenant or betray my oath, nor deceive my master or slight the Dao, nor feign devotion with hollow words, nor fail to uphold the kalpas’ trust.

I, having gathered my transgressions and swallowed my shame, now dare to speak, invoking my seven generations of parents and ninefold ancestors as witnesses to this vow, and all living kin of my nine clans as guarantors of this covenant. I delight in the immortal’s path and shall never be constrained by time. Should I violate this even for a day, may my life and death alike sink into the earthly prisons and the Five Paths, without hope of reprieve.

Above, I appeal to the Primordial Beginning; below, I swear before the Five Emperors. Facing the master’s treasure, I establish this covenant. With cinnabar sincerity and utmost devotion, I humbly beg for your compassionate acceptance."

The disciple, prostrate, bows twice with reverence.

Next, the master rises and faces north, holding the two copies of the true scriptures in his left hand. The disciple kneels, holding the token of faith in his right hand. The master strikes his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the colors of the five viscera, complete and perfectly forming a canopy of cloudlike brocade, covering the scriptures and himself. He then invokes:

"Celestial writ, unburdened and free,
the Dao and its power self-sufficient.
Cultivate it, and immortality is certain—
what more could one desire?
Its radiance shines in the Great Void,
brilliant and resplendent.
Transmit and receive all according to the Dharma;
leak or slight it, and fall into hell."

Next, the disciple kneels, performs nine bows, rising and prostrating three times, then receives the true scriptures. Girding his sash and grasping his staff, he bows once to each of the ten directions, beginning in the north and circling eastward to complete the circuit. He visualizes the Most High’s true form, resembling the Heavenly Worthy’s image.

Done, the master rises and paces in a circuit, chanting the *Step of the Void*:

"Prostrating, I bow to the Most High,
burning incense to return to the Void.
Luminous radiance follows me in turn,
the Dharma’s wheel likewise circles thrice."

The profound vow stirs the Four Great Ones,
blessings reach kings and lords.
Seven generations ascend to heaven’s halls,
brilliant and resplendent, their glory unfolds.
Whistling and singing, I gaze o’er the vast desert,
heavenly music delights my joy.
Equal in fragrance is the supreme virtue,
lesser immortals cannot compare.
Wondrous thoughts illumine the mysterious awakening,
in throngs they ride the void in flight.
Circling, they tread the cloud-net’s strands,
mounting the void to pace the dark principle’s path.
Chanting the hymn of the Imperial Unity,
a hundred meridians self-regulate.
Bending, I command the Eight Seas’ lads;
looking up, I grasp the lofty immortals’ hands.
The heavens scatter fragrant blossoms,
a subtle spirit-wind arises.
Long-held vows root destiny’s core,
thus attaining lofty eminence.
Beholding the music before the Most High,
ten thousand kalpas are but its beginning.
Towering is the Dark Capital’s mountain,
the ten directions revere the August One.
Lofty is the Heavenly Treasure Terrace,
its radiance flames like streaming sunlight.
Refining and glowing, the jade-forest’s flowers,
vibrant and resplendent, the pearl-fruits gleam.
Ever mindful to feast on primordial essence,
refining the fluids to firm the body’s form.
Golden light scatters the Purple Tenuity,
graceful and free, the Great Vehicle’s ease.
Looking up and down, I hold the Most High in mind,
radiant splendor adorns the cinnabar field.
Glancing left, I grasp the Somber Standard;
rightward, I take hold of the Knotted Brilliance.
Six Perfections crown the brahmic practice,
virtue and power renew with the sun.
Long-life’s accumulated blessings respond,
hearing the scriptures as if kin.
Heaven-endowed with talent surpassing the world,
joyfully reciting the subtle and rare texts.
Embracing the void and the Supreme Harmony’s qi,
exhaling and inhaling the rosy mist’s flow.
Fetal breathing stills a hundred meridians,
in emptiness, I fathom the Three Conveniences.
The Mud-Pill Palace gleams with bright light,
thus becoming a Golden Flower Immortal.
The Demon King reverently receives his charge,
hence I ascend to the heavens.
All begins with fasting and precepts,
accumulating merit to bind past-life bonds.
Soaring flight traverses the Great Void,
uplifting the loftiest ones.
Reining in to journey the ten directions,
circling to rest on the Dark Radiance’s slopes.
Looking up at the Kalpa-Blade Terrace,
gazing down at the Purple Cloud Net.
Carefree in the Most High’s capital,
together we sit upon lotus blossoms.
Through accumulated study, one becomes a Perfected Person,
tranquil, the constructive and protective qi harmonize.
Eternally enjoying boundless life,
ten thousand cedars—what need for more?
The Great Dao’s master is the Dark Silence,
ascending immortals befriend the Peerless Hero.
The Noble Scion bestows the numinous talisman,
the Great Unity presents the cavernous scriptures.
The śarīra gleams with golden splendor,
the dragon-chariot suddenly arrives to welcome.
The Heavenly Worthy gazes from the cloud-carriage,
floating, floating, riding the void in flight.
Fragrant blossoms like flying snow,
swirling mists embellish the dark beams.
Bowing my head, I worship the Golden Portal,
hand in hand, we invite the Jade Capital.
The Kien Tree’s Round Radiance Garden,
resplendent with the Seven Treasures’ grove.
Three hundred named heavenly beasts,
lions vast as ten thousand fathoms.
Flying dragons pace and chant,
divine phoenixes sing in rhythm.
The spirit-wind fans wondrous blossoms,
pure fragrance scatters upon my lapels.
Without the talent of a lofty immortal,
how could one indulge such a heart?
I adorn my nine-dragon chariot,
riding the void in carefree ease.
The Eight Heavens like a hall at fingertip’s reach,
the Six Directions—how could they be distant?
The assembled immortals chant the Cavernous Mystery,
the Most High sings the pure hymn.
Fragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,
jade tones form in the purple clouds.
The Five Sufferings burst forth at once,
the Eight Difficulties follow the scriptures’ emptiness.
Wondrous is the Numinous Treasure’s preserve,
raising this great Dharma bridge.
The Heavenly Perfected’s Palace of Imperial Unity,
lush and luxuriant, crowns the radiant spirits.
Flowing and glowing, the Dharma-wheel’s net,
circling the void to enter the formless.
The Void Sovereign strikes the cloud-zither,
the assembled Perfected chant the Cavernous Scriptures.
Lofty immortals, solemn, join hands in praise,
through endless kalpas, they preserve integrity.
The Utmost Perfected awaits nothing,
at times reining in flying dragons.
Long fasts convene in the Dark Capital,
chiming jade strikes the jasper bells.
The Ten Flowers’ immortals gather,
purple mist congeals into a palace.
Jewel canopies array the Most High,
Perfected Persons hold the lotus.
Scattering blossoms, I declare my vow,
grasping the tally, I subdue the Demon King.
The Dharma drum summons the assembled immortals,
their numinous chants differ not in sound.
There is no can, there is no cannot—
thoughts commune with the subtle and rare.

Then, facing north, he recites three hymns of reverence and praise. Their words are:

Delighting in the Dharma as one’s wife,
cherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.
Upholding precepts to restrain the six passions,
mindful of the Dao, I dispel desires.
Serene and pure, the upright qi abides,
the numinous spirit stills in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
lifetimes receive great blessings.
Lush and flourishing, the household and kingdom prosper,
solemn and majestic, the scriptures and Dao thrive.
May the wishes of heaven and humankind be fulfilled,
floating and distant, entering the Great Vehicle.
Establishing the field of blessings through the heart,
the Dharma wheel ascends in boundless ascent.
Seven generations ascend to heaven’s halls,
my body ascends in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the Cavernous Void,
with thought, nothing fails to accord.
Refining the form to enter immortal truth,
thus becoming a Vajra body.
Surpassing the Three Realms’ difficulties,
the Five Sufferings of hell are dissolved.
All return to the Most High’s scriptures,
in stillness, I bow my head in reverence.

After each recitation of the *Step of the Void*,
the disciple chants "Excellent!" and scatters blossoms,
completing one bow, then chants the Three Reverences:

With utmost sincerity, I bow to the Most High, the Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, I bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, I bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery.

Then, sitting upright, the disciple prostrates before the master.
The master recites the *Yuan Shi* prohibitions and precepts,
the disciple responding "Yes" to each phrase.
The disciple, so-and-so, states his name,
the master instructs: the disciple chants "Yes" three times.

The *Primordial Beginning’s Red Writ of Five Chapters*,
the Upper Clarity’s natural scripture,
the Nine Heavens’ primal-born numinous Cavernous Chapters,
forming heaven and establishing earth,
unfolding the myriad Perfected,
pacifying spirits and anchoring numina,
giving life to and nurturing the multitudes,
governing and guiding the cosmic movements,
preserving heaven’s eternal endurance.
Above, it regulates the celestial mechanisms;
in the middle, it inspects the Five Numinous;
below, it governs the earthly deities,
whistling commands to the River’s source,
directing and employing yin and yang,
summoning spirits and dispatching immortals.
This is the scripture of the Utmost Perfected,
wondrously responding to the natural,
causing heaven’s heights to clear,
making earth firm and secure,
preserving and guarding the Five Peaks,
wherein the ten thousand beings abide.
The Primordial Beginning inscribed it in the Divine Capital’s hall,
through countless kalpas and cosmic movements,
its text remains steadfast at heaven’s root,
never destroyed or lost,
moving with the cosmic shifts,
mingling yet unstained,
defiled yet ever purer,
destroyed yet not extinguished,
extinguished yet supremely luminous.
The Great Possession’s scripture,
revered by the Heavenly Perfected,
unless one’s name is inscribed in the Imperial Register,
carved on the bamboo slips of future lives,
this scripture remains hidden and secret,
none may glimpse or hear of it.
Those who obtain it
abide with the Three Qi eternally;
diligently practicing its methods,
they attain the divine immortals’ rank.

Only through wholehearted devotion and personal reverence may household and state know peace, life be preserved, calamities averted, and all inauspicious omens swept away. When the Son of Heaven and feudal lords uphold it, the realm attains great tranquility, hostile invaders submit of themselves, borderlands cease their strife, the myriad people sing in praise, and all under heaven flourishes. As the cycles of fate revolve, the true Dao prevails; those who obtain it summon forth spontaneity, their celestial perfection held in wondrous esteem, concealed by the Nine Heavens. It must not be lightly disclosed, lest judgment befall your person.

Should a disciple be deemed worthy of transmission, though the prescribed years of fifty-eight have not yet been fulfilled, let all ritual requisites be fully prepared. Following the Yellow Register, take the Three Masters, and initiate nineteen disciples. Only when merit is complete may the precious instructions be conveyed. No unauthorized master may privately instruct others. Should one violate these statutes, recklessly divulging without covenant, both master and recipient shall face the Four Extremities’ trial, while seven generations of ancestors sink into the earthly mounds, bound for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Can one not be cautious? Can one not be cautious? Let this be heeded.

Thereupon, the disciple rises and bows thrice, then prostrates again.

Next, the Six Vows are conferred, saying:
First vow: not to lightly disclose.
Second vow: not to treat with irreverence.
Third vow: not to transmit recklessly.
Fourth vow: not to speak of it idly.
Fifth vow: not to transgress the scripture’s prohibitions.
Sixth vow: not to accept wealth in exchange for the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy’s Six Vows bind the human heart; when the human heart is steadfast, the heart of the Dao is true. One must not violate these vows or breach the covenant, lest the Wind Blade befall them eternally.

As the vows are recited, first hold incense, and the disciple points one hand to heaven—left for men, right for women.

Thereupon, the disciple bows six times. The master stands and intones:
The true Dao is lofty and wondrous, revealed when resonance is felt. With sincere devotion, the Supreme Mystery is moved to compassion. The Purple Text refines the essence, divine gold subdues demons. Radiant and majestic, its power renders one a divine immortal. Now it is transmitted and entrusted—swear not to speak of it recklessly. Treasure and conceal the true descent; to divulge it is to invite disaster. The celestial statutes are stern—let this be upheld.

Thereupon, the disciple bows six times again.

Next, the master formally confers the disciple’s rank, saying: *Supreme Numinous Treasure, Peerless Cavern-Mystery Disciple, Master of Such-and-Such Peak, So-and-So.*

The disciple kneels to receive, then retreats, joining the tablets at the ends. Bowing to the original master, they perform nine prostrations, rising and kneeling thrice, advancing on elbows and knees.

Completed, they turn left, face east toward the west, and bow twice. Then they turn north, then east, then south, bowing twice to each, in the daily audience of the Four Extremities.

Returning to their position, they bow thrice to the Three Masters overseeing the transmission.

Next, they again read the petitions to the Ten Directions and the tablets of the Five Masters, facing the respective directions as before, save that the Five Masters face west.

Concluding, they kneel in profound gratitude. The disciple kowtows, striking their cheeks without count.

Their words are:

The Supreme Perfected, Most High Numinous Treasure, Peerless Cavernous Mystery Disciples, the so-and-so Peak Masters, your subjects so-and-so and others, now reverently burn incense and kowtow, entrusting body and spirit, pledging life to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, the Perfected Lords of the Ten Realms who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Ones, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Cavernous Mystery, the Three Perfected of the Supreme Unity, the High Mystery Dharma Masters of the Great Ultimate, the Orthodox Unity Perfected of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters, and all the deities within and beyond the Three Realms.

Your subjects, in transmitting the precepts to disciple so-and-so, who ascends the altar to swear the covenant, humbly beseech the grace of the Most High and all the Worthies to deliver and save us. We pray for the forgiveness of your subjects, this master and disciples, from the time our parents gave us form, along with all our karmic dependents, and for the myriad sins and transgressions of so-and-so, that all may be permitted this transmission.

From the establishment of the retreat until this day, we have violated precepts and laws, erred in conduct and decorum, mispronounced names contrary to nature, transgressed the order of seniority, and deviated in the conferral of ranks. We implore your great compassion to absolve and pardon us, that we may not incur punishment.

We humbly pray that your grace flow forth at this very moment, your majesty manifest today. May the mouths of the precious pearl today, though countless in number, ascend upon the precious pearl, attain fellowship with the exalted, together cross the Tiger Gorge and arrive as one, together traverse Dragon Mountain and reach its summit, and realize the four fruits of attainment. May the fruits of past vows be fulfilled in fivefold, their fulfillment coinciding with this very hour.

As the pearl’s mouth knows no overflow, as water and fire cannot burn or sink it, so today do men and women gaze in admiration at the phoenix wheel, awaiting afar the dragon chariot. All these wise companions, each the father of their father’s father, united in the One of the Mysterious Unity, we pray that the five eyes reward diligence, the three luminances bestow virtue, that merit and joy, toil and ease, all flow in harmonious delight. May the tally of death be dissolved, the record of life blessed. May the hymns of the Primordial Beginning endure forever, the unending celebration of the never-ending resound.

May each be granted extended lifespan and discerning form, protected and sheltered in their station, whether high or low, young or old. May the faithful sons of heaven’s protection and the guarded daughters of the Dharma attain their ends. May the women’s fruits be inscribed on purple tablets, the men’s names harmonize with the jade registers. May they vie in immortality with the Red Earl, attain the Dao and compete in liberation with the Mountain Charts. May the paths of misfortune be extinguished together, the steps of fortune arise through compassion.

May the Emperor’s reign be prolonged, the people cherished, the state governed. May the Three Refuges be universally embraced, the Four Teachings universally come. May imprisonment and distress be forever averted, karmic bonds eternally severed. May calamities and afflictions not arise, decline and suffering not be born.

For all other wishes, may each be carved as desired: those who seek office attain office, those who seek nobility attain nobility, those who seek the Dao attain the Dao, those who seek the Perfected attain the Perfected. May all aspirations be fulfilled, all desires realized. May the Dao be perfected in heaven and earth, merit deliver living beings. May it extend to all the celestial bodies of the heavens—sun, moon, and stars—the mountains and rivers, the dragon kings, bird kings, beast kings, insect kings, spirit kings of the myriad things, and all heavenly kings. In every place, whether heavenly spirits or earthly deities, mountain and water numina, local officials and guardians, all the soldiers and functionaries of the various defenses, may they all turn at once and together ascend to wondrous victory.

We pray that the Seven Origins be peacefully traversed, the Four Symbols free of transgression. May heaven display auspicious omens, earth reveal numinous portents. May mountains open their treasure tablets, rivers bring forth dragon charts. May the five magic mushrooms and green grasses spread across the countryside. May the four directions be purified, the world know great peace.

May boundless merit extend to the overseeing officials, those who labor and rejoice in the work, and all men and women who observe and listen. May all those of karmic affinity together enjoy supreme blessings, their dark resources reaching the six paths, their blessings extending to the four kinds of birth. May the five sufferings and three evils, all sentient beings with consciousness, be cleansed and bathed, crowned with heavenly robes, attaining joy and ease, forever forming good affinities, eternally companions of the Dharma, never again retreating, with the attainment of the Dao as their appointed time.

As for the altar master who pledges himself, so-and-so: may the five scriptures enter his body, the jade talismans nurture his essence, divine perfected guard his life, heavenly writings inspire auspicious signs. May the eight assemblies correspond to the charts, the six perfections be constantly upheld, the four practices remain unbroken, the five penetrations elevate him to immortality, the ten transformations enable him to soar. May his body be as adamantine and pure, perfectly attaining the sagely fruit. We bow our heads to the Ten Directions, ever abiding in the Three Treasures.

Next, the master recites the verses on the three destinies and five sufferings:

The Three Powers and the myriad things,
Each dependent, each with its span.
End and beginning await the kalpas’ reckoning,
When fortune is exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.

Back and forth through the five paths,
Ah, the suffering of repeated death and birth!
Turning in the three destinies,
Coming and going with calamity.

Great worthies, heed this warning,
Restrain your nature, sever your passions.
Foolish men do not believe the Dharma,
Their sins and pains ever cling to them.

I grieve that the world knows no end,
Thus I now proclaim it anew.
If you wish to cross this suffering,
Take refuge in the Most High Scriptures.

Sin and fortune do not come from another,
Truly, they arise from your own voice.
Great worthies, therefore, seal your mouths,
Seeking to sever all evil affinities.

Extinguish thoughts, attain complete cessation,
Dependent arising awaits final dissolution.
Expound the Dao to pacify the world,
In the end, you shall see the True Perfected.

Lust and jealousy are the roots of misfortune,
The greatest perils to body and life.
Nurturing such harms,
How can the Dao find peace?

Knowing evil yet not reforming,
I fear it must lead to early death.
Harboring poison while fasting,
It makes me sigh deeply.

Karma from past lives is indeed so,
Yet the weak and lost call it nonexistent.
All wish to see it before their eyes,
Dismissing what passes beyond their gaze.

Great worthies, illuminate the Dharma’s teachings,
Mourn the stubborn and dull.
Tenderly I grieve for your suffering,
Diligently I cause myself sorrow.

Life is consumed and exhausted,
Like a flame in the oil.
The Four Great are but temporary lodging,
The Five Aggregates a provisional loan.

In your prime, study diligently,
Hasten to preserve your self.
When fortune is spent, body and spirit scatter,
In the dark hells below.

The sagely fear this,
Thus they seek the Dao to cross this calamity.
To learn immortality is urgent,
Uphold the precepts, restrain the heart.

Let emptiness and equanimity house the true qi,
The immortals and sages will naturally seek you.
If you do not believe the Dharma’s words,
Why dwell in the mountains?

Great worthies, delight in the scriptures and precepts,
Receive them as treasures for your body.
To begin study is ever too late,
To cultivate the self, one ever regrets not starting sooner.

When I now delve into the profound and obscure,
In a flash, the years have aged me.
Clutching the scroll, I reach the limit of my breath,
Soon to face death’s agony and sorrow.

Thus in my youthful prime,
I abandoned the world to study the Dao.
Next, the Dharma Master turned eastward,
His mouth declaring merit, then resuming office.

Tai Xuan Du Zhengyi, the Celestial Master of Yangping’s Left Rectifying Qi, Minister So-and-so,
Bows twice and respectfully submits:
According to the documents, I, a mere mortal of flesh and blood,
Fortunate in destiny, was born into the Dharma gate.
By the great sagely grace, I was graciously and profoundly favored,
Permitted to partake of the wondrous essentials of the inner and outer true teachings—
The Dao of immortality, transcendence, and deathlessness.
I humbly ascend the *Shangqing* and *Sandong* treasured scriptures’ ascending-aurora guard,
Whose boundless, profound favor is unmatched.

The Dao is weighty, man is light—
How could my foul bones bear such a burden?
To fail the celestial offices would leave me headless.

Today, I ascend this mountain ridge
To confer the precious scriptures of initiation upon my disciple So-and-so,
Summoning from within his body the Three Divisions and Eight Radiant Spirits,
The celestial immortals’ steeds, the flying

Having concluded the covenant rites, the celestial and terrestrial spirits invoked are now respectfully dismissed to return to the Nine Heavens, proceeding in due order. From the Purple Mansion’s Jade Pavilion, through the wondrous gate and golden portal, the Jade Void True Qi’s Merit Officers and the divine steeds of the immortals enter my body, encircling and suffusing every vessel, bone, and joint. Within, they fill me with immortal qi; without, they sever all sources of evil, refining the soul and preserving essence, that I may soon attain flight and ascension. The feathered steeds of the immortals ascend directly to the Imperial Throne. Swallow the Twenty-Four Qi and halt.

Next, the Dharma Master returns to the incense burner and intones:
"Incense Officers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials—may this place of transmission naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before this incense altar, that I may attain the Dao and swiftly achieve transcendence. May disciples So-and-so and all within their households, both inner and outer, receive blessings. May the ten directions’ immortal youths and jade maidens attend the fragrant smoke, conveying my supplications directly to the Jade Emperor’s celestial throne."

Next, recite the *Precepts Hymn*:
The Dao is the heartless origin,
All acts are fields of merit.
One cessation—no fixed measure of merit,
Each vow springs from the self.
Empty the self to respond to all beings,
Focus the mind without partiality.
The Great Sage exalts the true teaching,
As rain descends from heaven.
Lofty and boundless, none untouched,
Yet humility forms the abyss.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
For it can forsake even the dragon’s scales.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom endures—
Not merely for this lifetime.
Uphold the precepts without lapse,
And life after life, good karma binds.
With concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the Dao’s truth.

Recite the *Returning Precepts Hymn*:
The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,
Expounds the precepts to deliver all beings.
Virtue and power pervade the hidden and manifest,
Karmic retribution summons the true spirits.
The devas bow in reverence,
While demonic hordes restrain their forms.
The past transcends the Eight Difficulties,
The present secures a thousand years.
When the merit of the fast is complete,
Together we send forth our devotion.
The flowing Sanskrit and soaring clouds chant,
Fragrant smoke mingles with incense’s perfume.
Jade phoenixes ride crimson chariots,
Golden dragons draw emerald carriages.
In life and death, all find joy,
Families and nations attain peace.

Upon completion, master and disciples circumambulate the altar, chanting Sanskrit hymns, and conclude the rites. Alternatively, they may return to the incense burner and perform the *Ascending Heaven and Treading Earth* rites upon the august altar. Then, master and disciples chant Sanskrit hymns as they exit through the northwest gate of the Nine Heavens—without looking back.

The *Treading Earth* and *Dissolving Form* talismans are inscribed in blue on white silk; the *Ascending Heaven* and *Concealment* talismans are written in yellow on green silk. Some masters say: before declaring merit, perform these rites to completion, then lead the disciple to face north and bow four times to the Jade Throne of the Supreme Lord. Next, face east and bow twice to the Great Emperor Lord. Then, face south and bow twice to the Most High Perfected. Afterward, face west and bow twice to Master Zhang, the Heavenly Master. On the third day, the disciple declares merit, holds a fast to give thanks, and the rites are recorded in a separate scroll.

Next, the disciple performs the *Lance-Tablet Casting* rite in the direction of their life’s origin at the altar. Facing east, they knock their teeth together three times, offer incense, and pray:
"Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao: summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the Left and Right Attendant Officers, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens who attend the incense, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Daily Incense Officers—thirty-six of each—to emerge. I now burn incense and invoke the local earth deities and the true officials of the four directions. May the Supreme Lord’s ten-directional true qi enter my body, that my supplications ascend directly to the throne of the Most High, Perfect, and Great Sage, the Celestial Worthy and Jade Emperor."

Upon finishing, they turn to face the king and knock their teeth together twelve times. After reading the tablet, they pray:
"Heaven unfolds, earth extends,
The Nine Qi divide their numinous power.
The Three Origins share a single talisman,
The ten directions are mystically pure.
The Five Elder Thearchs,
Open the true and guide the living.
Cinnabar script and vermilion texts,
Primordial essence of the Highest Origin—
Universally proclaimed to the supreme,
The august spirits of the Nine Lands.
Today is most auspicious,
All immortals confirm life.
I vow for my immortal self,
To cast my jade name.
The Earth Mansion’s Great August One,
Erase my sinful form.
Submit the tablet to the Upper Palace,
Inscribe it in the Azure Register.
Swiftly attain flight and ascension,
Heaven and earth share their numinous power.
Nine generations of kin,
Rotten bones renewed in glory.
Souls ascend to the Southern Palace,
Transformed in the immortal courts.
Today I declare my mandate—
May all spirits heed!
With golden clasps I affirm
My utmost sincerity.
As I have petitioned, so let it be—
By golden dragon courier."

Upon completion, they offer incense and return to the incense burner, following the above method.

The *Highest Origin Numinous Treasure* addresses the Nine Earths’ Earth August Ones, the *Extinguishing Sins and Inscribing Names to Seek Immortality* method:
The *Numinous Treasure* and *Vermilion Thearch* female Daoist adept, So-and-so, aged such-and-such, born in such-and-such month, life registered under the Southern Dipper of the Nine Heavens.
Explanation: This text refers to the Vermilion Thearch as one whose life origin is in the *bing-wu* (fire-horse) year, and whose life is registered under the Nine Heavens if born in the first or second month. The Southern Dipper governs the direction of one’s life origin; the rest follows this pattern.
Vowing to become a spirit, vowing to become an immortal,
To attain long life and transcend the world,
To soar to the Upper Clarity,
The Central August of the Nine Lands.

The right side is inscribed on a silver tablet in vermilion, wrapped in blue paper, bound with nine blue silk clasps, and sealed with one golden dragon. It is buried at the central palace of one’s residence. Next, present the spirit tablet, inscribe the tablet, and bury it in the corresponding direction of the altar. Alternatively, it may be cast into mountain ravines, deep springs, or abysses—let no one retrieve it.

Each tablet is one foot and two inches long, two inches and four fen wide, and three fen thick.
