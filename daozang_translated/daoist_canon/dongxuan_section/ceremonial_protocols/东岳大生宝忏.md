**Purification of Heaven and Earth Spell**  
**Purification of the Altar**

We reverently declare:
Fragrant incense ascends in solemn mist, suffusing the Great Void;
With sincere devotion, we dare not falter, though the distance be but a foot.
We humbly burn precious incense, offering it in worship to:
The Azure Emperor of Broad Life of Mount Tai, the Eastern Peak;
The Heavenly Equal Great Life Benevolent and Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak;
The True Lord of the Nine Heavens, Minister of Destiny;

The Illustrious and Benevolent Manifest King;
The King of National Protection and Manifest Response;
The True Lord of Pure Source and Wondrous Dao;
The Loyal, Brave, and Martial King of Pacification, the True Lord of Exalted Peace;

The Earth Spirits of the Nine Provinces;
The Deities of the Year, Month, Day, and Hour;
The Merit Officers of the Four Directions;
The Deities of the Temples and Shrines of the Prefectures, Subprefectures, and Counties.

All rely upon the true incense, universally offered in worship.

This incense—purple and void, richly fragrant—gathers the numinous winds and dense clouds, ascending directly to the Grotto-Heavens.
May the Incense Officials convey our petition, reporting it before the Emperor.
May all we declare be granted as spoken, our sincerest sentiments fully revealed.

We humbly hope:
Banners and standards, borne by clouds, descend past the Tiger Pass;
The wind clears the way, the phoenix carriage’s bells harmonize.
A hundred lords attend in solemn ranks, a thousand officials escort in formation.
All descend to this humble altar, gazing upon our pure devotion.

Now, with orchid altars purified and precious incense thickly perfuming,
we face the sacred and true, proclaiming the repentance ritual.
We bow our heads in reverence, taking refuge in the Boundless Dao.

**The Three Refuges**
With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Dao-Treasures of the Ten Directions.
May all beings turn their minds toward faith and reverence.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Scripture-Treasures of the Ten Directions.
May all beings awaken to understanding, receive, uphold, and recite them.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Master-Treasures of the Ten Directions.
May all beings ascend the Dharma-Bridge without hindrance.

**Declaration**
We have heard:
Before the primordial chaos divided, a single *qi* stretched boundlessly;
Once high and low were arrayed, the Three Powers took form.
The earth was divided into the Five Peaks, yet none held greater authority than Mount Tai.
It stands as the pillar of Qi and Lu, the guardian of the Horn and Neck constellations.
In the Yu dynasty, the royal hunt was marked by the solemnity of burnt offerings;
In the Zhou era, seasonal tours were honored with ritual gifts.
It has been revered beyond compare.

We humbly consider the Heavenly Equal Great Life Benevolent and Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak.
Responding to creation, He arose at the dawn of chaos;
Established by yin and yang, He governs the vast expanse.
His years equal Heaven’s, His great virtue ever-growing.
Benevolence begets benevolence, embodying the generative power of Qian;
Holiness surpasses holiness, dwelling in the towering majesty of Mount Tai.
He presides over the East among the Five Directions, supreme in the Middle Realm among the Three Realms.
Enacting Heaven’s decrees, He governs the netherworld.
In the Alabaster Pavilion and Stone Gate, His spirit abides in profound silence;
With golden tablets and jade registers, He knows the span of human lives.
He established seventy-five bureaus to wield authority;
He maintains thirty-six prisons to punish the wicked.
Ever securing the nation and sheltering the people,
the state offers sacrifices in due seasons, and all under Heaven come to pay homage in spring.
Perceptive and upright, He grants every request;
His majestic *qi* and numinous power reach even the farthest realms.
All who pray are surely bathed in His compassion.

Thus, we purify our humble abode and establish this ritual of incense and flowers.
With bowed hands and reverent prostration, we gaze upon His august presence;
With devotion and sincerity, we seek to cleanse the sins of all beings.
As if He were present, we are moved and our prayers reach Him.

The assembly, with utmost devotion, chants praises in unison.

**Chant**
We look up to the Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor,
Greatest of the Five Peaks, Mount Tai as its foundation.
He governs the affairs of the world and humanity,
His *qi* concentrated in divine splendor, majestically dwelling in the East.
Lofty and vast is Mount Tai,
its height of four thousand nine hundred *zhang* unmatched.
Its summit is called the Peaceful Peak,
with the Self-Sacrifice Terrace and Jieqiu Peak.
The Hall of Benevolent Peace gleams with lapis lazuli,
its crown and regalia resplendent at its heart.
Ancient emperors performed the feng and shan sacrifices,
ascending to report their achievements and inscribe their success.
Seventy-two rulers are recorded,
beginning with the Yellow Emperor, who first received the honor.
Steles remain, inscribed in Qin script;
to the east lies the Pool of the Senior Officials and the Pine of the Great Master.
The Tang emperor carved an image of aloeswood;
the Song dynasty established the Hall of Meeting the True.
In our dynasty, unity brought heightened reverence,
and the title "Great Life" was lavishly bestowed.
Utmost benevolence and holiness, the people’s ultimate hope,
timely rain and sunshine ensure bountiful years.
With profound reverence, we bow and take refuge,
gazing afar at the cloud-girded palace to honor His compassionate countenance.

The inconceivable merit of harmony is beyond thought.
We raise the Threefold Vows in reverence:
Vow and bow to the Highest Ninefold Qi, the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure in the East of the Central Heaven.
Vow and bow to the Highest Ninefold Qi, the Heavenly Worthy of the Azure Spirit, the Primordial Elder.
Vow and bow to the Highest Ninefold Qi, the Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Florescence, the Supreme Minister.

I have heard: the sacred peaks reside between *xun* and *gen*, presiding over judgment and examination; humanity dwells within *qian* and *kun*, and every action accumulates transgressions. The solemn records never fail to inscribe even the slightest detail. Prostrate in reflection, we repentant disciples, transient in this borrowed life, sheltered as human beings—our bodies and hair, skin and limbs, received from our parents; our ears and eyes, nose and mouth, completing our form and spirit—are the most numinous of all creatures, equally endowed with the essence of the Five Phases. Through years and months, days and hours, our faults and offenses pile high as mountains, while our virtuous thoughts fade like dew. The roots of sin are hard to extinguish; evil fills its measure with ease. Unaware of the path of expiation, ignorant of the way to confess, we ponder in silence: how can we justify ourselves? Now, in repentance, we examine our faults, humbly bowing to seek absolution.

On this auspicious day, we pour forth our sunflower sincerity. The censer burns with fragrant incense, the candles blaze with crimson flame. We strike the bell and chime the stone, their sounds harmonizing with the *Step-in-Emptiness* chant; we pour water and offer flowers, our rites never straying from sincerity. Our sacrifice emulates the simplicity of the Western neighbor; our prostrations are offered to the august presence of the Eastern Peak. May our past wrongs be redeemed, our karmic burdens dissolved. With reverence, we rely on repentance, beseeching forgiveness.

The assembly, devout in faith, takes refuge and offers praise.
Each person reverently joins in unison, bowing once.

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the sovereign of the Eastern Direction, who presides over the Azure Spirit’s treasury of purity on Mount Tai. His stone image stands in majestic dignity; jade tablets record his enfeoffment. His imperial title is bestowed with lavish praise: *Guangsheng*—"Vast Life." From antiquity, his glory endures. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Guangsheng Emperor of Mount Tai, Azure Emperor of the Eastern Peak.**

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One who embodies virtue and manifests benevolence, guardian of the Eastern Lands. Mount Tai is hailed as the foremost of peaks, ruling the Three Palaces of the Hollow Void; its sacred precinct is supreme, governing the court where gods and spirits are judged. Worship is exalted by imperial decree; his position presides over *Xuanxiao*. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One who, from youth, left home to wander and seek instruction. He received the prophecy of the Supreme Heavenly Worthy and attained transcendence through Dao; he was granted the title of Controller of Destiny and joined the assembly of inspectors. Dwelling in the Office of Destiny on Mount Huo, he was enfeoffed as the Supreme Minister of Mount Tai. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Supreme Minister of the Nine Heavens, Controller of Destiny, Bestower of Blessings, Protector and Sage Perfected.**

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One whose qi was nurtured by the mountain’s spirit, whose lineage flows from the celestial clan. Earth’s primal power merged with his virtue; he embodied filial piety and benevolence in full. The imperial dream foretold his noble birth, declaring his majesty and valor. As heir to the palace, he received the royal enfeoffment. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Supreme Hall, Most Sage, Majestic and Illustrious, Benevolent and Kind King.**

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Virtuous and Radiant August Empress of the Eastern Peak.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Great King of the Western Qi, Protector of the Realm.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Immortal Officials of the Blue-Green Cavern of the Hollow Void.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Vice-Regent Immortal Officials of Mount Changbai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Vice-Regent Immortal Officials of Mount Liangfu.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Blessing and Protection, Divine Heir.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Kindness and Numinosity, Divine Heir.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Great Master of Serene Discernment, Divine Heir.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Manifest Numinosity, Divine Heir.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Transformation, Ruler of the Southern Peak.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Prosperity and Favorable Omens, Ruler of the Western Peak.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Truth and Mystic Sanctity, Ruler of the Northern Peak.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Tranquility and Exalted Sanctity, Ruler of the Central Peak.**

**Incantation:**
The Azure Mystery spreads its true array,
the primordial rank pervades the numinous.
The Fusang guards its entirety,
the firstborn engenders primordial flourishing.
The cinnabar grove scatters its radiance,
nurturing essence and engendering flourishing.
Merging with the mystic splendor,
it subdues and restrains demonic hordes.

With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who encompasses the Great East, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Foremost of the Sacred Peaks, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose height rivals the heavens, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose compassion is impartial, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One of vast and luminous embrace, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who shelters all beings, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who regards all with equal benevolence, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose wisdom makes him sagely, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**
With single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose august title is Emperor, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**

The rites completed, each kneels in reverence, taking refuge in repentance.

We, the assembly of devotees, with single-minded devotion take refuge in the divine, surrendering body and life to the **Guangsheng Emperor of Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor; the Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens; the Most Sage Illustrious King; the divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.**

I have heard: though the mountain’s true form stands immutable in its majestic stability, our bodies are but grand illusions—how could we avoid missteps in our conduct? We humbly beseech the sagely compassion to bestow its vast grace, showering boundless mercy.

In repentance this day, we, the faithful, since time immemorial, since our birth, have borne the heavens and trodden the earth, embraced yin and carried yang, dwelling like ants in clusters, busying ourselves like flies. In our comings and goings, not a single good deed is recorded; in our rising and resting, a hundred transgressions accumulate unnoticed.

At times, we have offended the multitude of sages; at others, exposed ourselves shamelessly beneath the Three Luminaries. We have acted contrary to ritual and moved against righteousness. Racing grand carriages and fine steeds along the paths of fame and profit; donning fine linen and light furs, indulging in excess beyond all measure of splendor. Our conduct has been full of secrecy and perversity, our pursuits beyond what is proper. We have received this single form yet remain ignorant of the Three Reflections. Thus, transgressions accumulate, boundless and immeasurable.

We humbly beseech the multitude of sages to bestow their grace, the host of Perfected to confer their blessings. Extending benevolence to all things, may they untangle the entanglements of bodily karma; preserving life and prolonging years, may they shatter the mountain of our sins. We further pray that this vast response may extend equally to all living beings.

With devoted hearts, we bow our heads in reverence, offering thanks to the Most Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Dao.

**The Most Sagely Treasure of the Dao, Heavenly Worthy**
We take refuge in the Supreme Dao, honored in the Three Realms of Great Purity.
In repentance, all faithful,
May the transgressions of bodily karma be dissolved.
The four wrongs all eradicated,
Seeing goodness, we daily transform.
If we examine ourselves without cease,
Fortune and blessings will naturally extend our years.

**Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Bodily Karma**
*Incantation*
Virtue flourishes in wood,
Corresponding above to the Year Star.
Ancestor of the Five Peaks,
Grandchild of the Heavenly Emperor.
The sun resides in the East,
Gateway of Heaven.
Mists swirl in abundance,
Joyful qi intermingles in harmony.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
In the eastern image of the sun—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Revered by the Four Peaks—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Vast and boundless as Heaven—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
The Nine Qi conjoined as one—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Great and transformative—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Loving life and hating killing—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Radiant with kindness and benevolence—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Wise, enlightened, sagely, and intelligent—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
United with Earth as Emperor—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.

Having completed the rites, we each kneel in reverence, taking refuge and repenting.

We, the assembled faithful, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life:
The Lord Controller of Vast Life of Mount Tai, the Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor;
The Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens;
The Most Sage Illustrious King;
The divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.

We have heard: as the mountain anchors the rivers and peaks, wondrously silent and scentless; yet when the mouth speaks, often what is right becomes wrong. We humbly beseech the sagely compassion to bestow its vast grace, showering boundless mercy.

In repentance this day, we, since former lives until now, have indulged in ornate speech and clever words, sharp tongues and harsh voices, boastful discourse and lofty talk, wild singing and reckless laughter. Immersed in wine and intoxication, we have pursued pleasure without restraint; consuming meat and fish, we have deemed delicacies insufficient. At times, we have berated the wind and scolded the rain; at others, resented the heat and lamented the cold.

In repentance, we recall that since our birth until today, the six senses have clashed, the seven emotions have gone unchecked. Cunning calculations arise, and greed runs rampant. Desires have roamed unbridled, indulging in excess without measure; virtue has been forgotten in favor of wealth and rank. We have committed every manner of depravity, perversity, and extravagance; anger, fear, and dread have led us astray. We have concealed our own faults while undermining others’ strengths. Envious of the worthy and resentful of the capable, we have obscured our spiritual terrace, remaining unaware. We have bullied the lonely and weak, believing the darkness of our chambers could conceal our deeds. Mixing falsehood with truth, we have embraced the new while forgetting the old. Our hearts, benighted, have failed to awaken to the Nine Contemplations. Thus, grievances have multiplied, beyond naming or recounting.

We humbly beseech the Sagely Emperor to bestow compassion, the Perfected Spirits to perceive with clarity. Above, may they fulfill the intent of benevolence, pardoning the transgressions of our mental karma; below, may they satisfy human desires, bringing joy as radiant as the spring terrace. We further pray that this vast blessing may extend equally to all living beings.

With devoted hearts, we bow our heads in reverence, offering thanks to the Most Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Scriptures.

**The Most Sagely Treasure of the Scriptures, Heavenly Worthy**
We take refuge in the Supreme Scriptures, honored in the Thirty-Six Sections.
In repentance, all faithful,
May the transgressions of mental karma be dissolved.
Ever pure and ever still,
Desires naturally do not arise.
Within and without, both chaste and bright,
May we forever preserve the tranquility of the Dao-mind.

**Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Mental Karma**
*Incantation*
Majestic Mount Tai,
Governor of all spirits.
Receiving Heaven’s bright mandate,
Overseer of human relations.
Its position is in the East,
Its virtue is benevolence.
All things rely on it to begin,
Its merit aids the living.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Flourishing in the East—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:

With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Thus sagely, thus benevolent—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.
With devoted hearts, we bow and worship:
Emperor through virtue—
The Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.

Having completed the rites, we each kneel in reverence, taking refuge and repenting.

We, the assembled faithful, with utmost devotion take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life:
The Lord Controller of Vast Life of Mount Tai, the Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor;
The Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens;
The Most Sage Illustrious King;
The divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.

We have heard: the mountain stabilizes the rivers and peaks, wondrously silent and scentless; yet when the mouth speaks, often what is right becomes wrong. We humbly beseech the sagely compassion to bestow its vast grace, showering boundless mercy.

In repentance, we recall that since former lives until now, we have indulged in ornate speech and clever words, sharp tongues and harsh voices, boastful discourse and lofty talk, wild singing and reckless laughter. Immersed in wine and intoxication, we have pursued pleasure without restraint; consuming meat and fish, we have deemed delicacies insufficient. At times, we have berated the wind and scolded the rain; at others, resented the heat and lamented the cold.

We have scorned the Dao, flattered the gods, belittled the Confucians, and slandered the Buddhist teachings. With a three-inch tongue, we have sowed discord among the six relations; with a single deceitful heart, we have stirred strife between two parties. Our ornate words have deluded the masses; our boasts of wealth have humiliated the poor. Ever relying on glib tongues, we have seldom heeded the caution of sealing our lips. Our accumulated transgressions run deep, and even washing our hair would fail to count them all.

We humbly beseech the sagely Emperor to show compassion, the true numina to take pity. May your virtuous decrees be proclaimed, that our oral karmic offenses may be cleansed; may the realm attain purity and peace, and the sound of teachings gradually spread. We further pray for your vast blessings to extend equally to all sentient beings.

With devoted hearts, we bow our heads in reverence, offering homage to the Supreme and Rightly Enlightened Master Treasure.

Great Sage Master Treasure, Heavenly Worthy,
We take refuge in the Supreme Master, revered by humans and gods alike.
In repentance, all faithful,
Pray to dissolve the transgressions of speech.
Like a sealed jar, guard well,
A single word worth a thousand gold.
When words are full yet faults are none,
All becomes pure and tranquil sound.

Merciful Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Oral Karma,
We circumambulate in the void, treading the cloud-net,
Scattering flowers.

We have heard: whether one does good or evil, it is surely not concealed from the divine; whether fortune or misfortune descends, each is governed by its respective office. Within the six directions, all things great and small, every being with form and qi, are all under their jurisdiction. There are officials to record merits and transgressions, to oversee life, death, and registration. They govern both the unseen and the manifest, administering the affairs of people and all creatures.

Now, we repentant faithful, dwelling in the dusty world with mortal roots, have in times past seen what is right yet failed to act; deemed small evils harmless and thus not abandoned them. These have brewed into manifold sins, and we fear a hundred calamities. Relying on utmost sincerity, we look up and pray for your great response, to guide us toward future blessings and atone for past transgressions.

With bowed heads, we take refuge and reverently pay homage.

Proceeding with the *Eliminating Karmic Obstructions* Heavenly Worthy,
chanting the *Pacing the Void*:

We have heard: all human transgressions arise from a single misguided thought;
making goodness one’s teacher may bring the descent of a hundred blessings.
If one does not forestall calamity in advance,
surely swift retribution will befall the self.
Awakening to self-renewal,
one turns back in reflection.
Taking refuge in the Three Treasures,
we hope the three karmic actions will melt like ice;
paying homage to the host of Perfected Ones,
we pray all transgressions will be swept away like lightning.
With the six senses purified,
ten thousand sins are absolved.
Thus, for errors unwittingly committed,
and for transgressions taught to others,
we repent past deeds and seek release,
prostrating to trace the source of all faults.

Once more, we reflect with reverence upon the numinous radiance,
bowing in earnest supplication.
Day by day, we uphold solemn devotion,
undaunted by repetition;
Heaven’s mandate is not constant,
yet blessings flow abundantly from the Nine-Five.
Grant us further the gift of trustworthy grace,
that we may become people without fault.
We humbly pray that the great winds of benevolence may spread,
fanning the withering of karmic blossoms;
that the sagely grace may universally moisten,
nurturing the growth of good fruits.

We, your servants, overwhelmed with gratitude,
prostrate ourselves in deepest reverence, and respectfully submit this petition.

*Three Petitions*
*Three Bows*

We, your servants Fa and Zhong, with devoted hearts and bowed heads, take refuge in the Most High Three Honored Ones and the sacred assemblies of the ten directions, performing the rites of the *Canonical Scriptures* in accordance with the Dharma.

With devoted hearts, we prostrate and bow to the Most High Boundless Great Dao.
With devoted hearts, we prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.
With devoted hearts, we prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center.

*Twelve Vows*
First, may the blessings of one person extend to all.
Second, may the Two Luminaries of the altar shine brightly.
Third, may the Three Agricultural Seasons bring joy and prosperity.
Fourth, may the Four Seasons be harmonious and peaceful.
Fifth, may the sacrifices of the Two and Five be firm and enduring.
Sixth, may the Six Directions be pure and clear.
Seventh, may the Seven Stars trace their radiant paths.
Eighth, may the Eight Festivals bring peace and prosperity.
Ninth, may the Nine Springs open to great fortune.
Tenth, may the Ten Directions flourish and thrive.
Eleventh, may blessings flow to all good and faithful followers.
Twelfth, may the Great Dao flourish and prevail.

Thus far,
thus far have our morning devotions and rites of repentance been completed in full.

We now turn to offer thanks to the Greatly Compassionate and Sagely Emperor of the Eastern Peak, Heavenly Equal of Creation, and to all the numinous powers of Mount Tai.
Humbly we beseech your sagely grace to bestow your vast protection.

May our supreme wish be that the reigning Emperor,
equal in longevity to Heaven,
enjoy an everlasting and boundless reign,
laying down arms to cultivate culture,
so that the era of warfare may forever cease.
May the myriad people sing in praise of his virtuous rule,
and the four quarters rejoice in the Great Peace.
May yin and yang flow smoothly,
and the seasons bring abundant harvests.

Next, may our wish be that the faithful devotee [Name],
seeking repentance,
have their transgressions erased from the Black Registers for all eternity,
and their name inscribed in the Azure Records for eternal life.
May all places be blessed with primordial fortune,
and all people dwell in peace and harmony.
May the nine generations of ancestors ascend as immortals,
and the ten directions together rejoice.

May all sentient beings of every kind
share in the bounty of fulfillment’s grace;
may the souls lost in the long night’s darkness
all bathe in the transforming light of transcendence.

For this supreme cause,
we invoke the East’s Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,
the Azure Spirit Primal Elder Heavenly Worthy,
the Eastern Flower Upper Minister Heavenly Worthy,
and the Boundless Life-Bestowing Heavenly Worthy—
their merits unfathomable, their virtues beyond thought.

Here ends the *Great Life-Repentance Sutra of the Eastern Peak*.
