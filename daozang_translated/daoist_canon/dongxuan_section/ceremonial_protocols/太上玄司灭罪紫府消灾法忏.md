*The Supreme Mysterious Controller’s Rite of Extinguishing Transgressions and Dispelling Calamities from the Purple Mansion*

The ritual proceeds according to protocol; the incense serves as the token of sincere communion, while the heart is the gateway to the study of the Dao.

Humankind is endowed by Heaven and Earth with life and completion, just as the sages respond to earnest devotion with manifest grace.

Today, with reverence, we offer true incense and devoutly invoke:
The Three Clarities and Supreme Saints,
The Ten Poles and Lofty Perfected,
The Nine Heavens’ Responsive Origin, Thunder’s Universal Transformation, Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation,
The Palace of the Sun’s Most Perfected Great Sage, the Great Yang Emperor-Lord,
The Palace of the Moon’s Most Perfected Great Sage, the Great Yin Sovereign,
The Five Directions’ Five Powers Star Lords,
The Four Qi and Four Luminaries Star Lords,
The Southern Dipper’s Six Controllers of Longevity and Life-Giving Star Lords,
The Central Heaven’s Great Sage, the Northern Dipper’s Nine August Thearch Star Lords,
The Three Terraces and Canopy Star Lords,
The Twenty-Eight Constellations’ Star Lords,
The Twelve Palaces’ Divine Star Lords,
The Dipper’s Star Lords of the Holding Ram and Rāhu, the Two Immortal Envoys,
The Heavenly Stem’s Great Sage, the Purple Court’s Marshal, the Radiant Star Lord of the Astral Stride.

[The supplicant’s name] above is governed by:
The natal Star Official of their birth,
The Greater and Lesser Star Officials of their destiny,
The Star Luminaries of their life palace in their celestial revolutions,
The Perfected of the Purple Mansion and the hundred numinous hosts,
The Year God and the Dipper’s Directing Envoy.

May the ritual altar’s descent witness and inspect your majestic numen.
We rely entirely upon the true incense to universally offer homage.

Your humble servant now respectfully petitions, presenting the sincerest of red-hearted devotion, all fully set forth in the memorial text. By means of this morning’s rites of repentance, we reverently beseech the radiance of your grace to deign to cast your merciful gaze upon us.

We reflect that the Jade Edicts of Dragon City and the Jeweled Chapters of Phoenix Park—when recited, they may absolve transgressions and expiate faults; when revered, they may dispel calamities and avert misfortunes. Thus we have prepared incense and candles, arrayed banners and flowers, established a pure and sacred altar, and faced the sacred image of the Primordial Venerable.

A hundred thoughts have become obstructive karma; with a single heart, we have acted in greed and gluttony, ever indulging the six senses. The accumulated misfortunes of days past have swiftly coalesced, for we have not contemplated the Three Goodnesses. Now the ripened evils of this time have taken form, and we shall exhaust all recourse in supplication.

To perform this rite of expiation and thanksgiving, we honor the one hundred fifty august titles of the Heavenly Worthies, aligning with the thirty-twofold golden portals of the Celestial Court’s wisdom. When the Jeweled Treasury opens, the divine sounds of the Ten Caverns suddenly resound; where the golden bells are struck, the precious palaces of the Nine Purities silently connect.

We prostrate ourselves, beseeching the Supreme Primordial Venerable and the Most Sagely of the Central Heaven: may you condescend to accept our earnest sincerity and bestow the grace of your inspection. May the offenses and transgressions committed at dawn and dusk, the misfortunes that may befall under the cyclical signs of geng and jia, all be absolved and transformed.

May the names inscribed in the Black Registers of the Northern Capital be secretly amended through cultivation; may the commands of the cinnabar talismans from the Central Marchmount be followed, with goodness increasing day by day. Disasters shall melt away like ice. With utmost sincerity, we personally perform this reverent rite, each person offering respectful devotion.

The rites of reverence now complete, we bow in body to repent and give thanks.
We humbly consider that in turning toward the vow, only reverence and sincerity avail.
To remove the karmic roots of the Three Poisons, one must earnestly maintain the single thought of goodness.
Thus, relying on the teachings of the scriptures, we lay bare our hearts.
We know that transgressions can be repented, and misfortunes can be eradicated.
We hope to be allowed to repent before Fengdu, erasing the records of sins and evils;
and to humbly present our prayers to Mount Tai, removing the registers of faults and grievances.
All the errors and missteps of our lives, and all the harms—whether by day or night—arising from the myriad conditions,
are wholly gathered into this single repentance.
Silently, we strike the rhythm of the Western Fullness, gazing afar toward the Southern Culmen’s palace.
We prostrate ourselves, praying that heavenly compassion may be moved to pardon and forgive,
and that the true numina may be commanded to turn their wise regard.
When the Dark Bureau of Sin examines our records, may our sins melt like ice;
when the Purple Mansion enacts its judgments, may our calamities scatter like mist.
Relying on the exalted virtue of the Most High, may our earnest prayers be answered.
Should any hindrances cling to body or mind, may all be cleansed through refuge.
We bow our heads to the Supreme Void Emperor, the Most High, the True and Perfect Three Treasures.

The *Rites of the Most High’s Dark Bureau for Eradicating Sins and the Purple Mansion for Dispelling Disasters* now conclude.
