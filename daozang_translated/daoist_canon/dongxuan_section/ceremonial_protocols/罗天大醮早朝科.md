### **Morning Rites of the Grand Luotian Jiao**

**The Master and Attendants Recite the Invocation as Prescribed:**

The azure void reflects in emptiness, the sun’s radiance returns to its numinous source.
Divine tigers repel evil, flying immortals stream forth with ringing bells.
They crush deceit and diminish trials, binding the myriad demons in submission.
The Nine Subtleties restore the Dao, the Eight Potencies seize their essences.
A thousand perfected ones review the records, the Three Origins purge all defilement.
To the left, the Yellow Center is summoned with a whistle; to the right, the Six Dings are spurred into motion.
Seven revolutions, eight unions—revolving through the celestial scriptures.
The sagely transformation stands majestic; the Three Ways proceed in harmony.
Auspicious clouds flow and spread, merging with the Yellow Court of the luminous scene.

**Strike the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi*, Supreme Lord Lao:
Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the left and right attendants,
the left and right golden lads bearing incense, the jade maidens transmitting words and scattering flowers,
and the thirty-six officers of the Five Thearchs, the talisman attendants, and the incense officials of the cyclical days.
Let them emerge—adorned in solemn attire, crowned and sashed with trailing tassels.
Notify the local earth deities and the divine guardians of this sacred precinct:
This servant now ascends the altar at dawn to perform the Dao, paying homage to the imperial perfected ones.
Respectfully submit this petition for the intentions herein, with all sincerity duly inscribed.
May the supreme and perfected *qi* of the Dao, the numinous and auspicious radiance of the *Lingbao*,
descend and infuse this servant’s body, that the sincerity of this invocation
may swiftly ascend to the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Great Dao,
the Three Clarities’ exalted sages, and the August Jade Emperor of the Golden Gates of the Supreme Heaven.

**Recite the Dharma Titles**

The assembled officiants and altar attendants, in shared devotion, reverently address:
The Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Void and Spontaneous,
the Supreme Lord of the Boundless Dao,
the Most High Lord Lao,
the August Jade Emperor,
the great holy hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,
the perfected lords and venerable masters,
the thirty-two Heavenly Lords,
the Jade Clarity Emperor,
the Great Emperor of the Jade Thearch,
the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen,
the Western Numinosity and Northern Perfection,
the Lord of the Dao of the Luminous August Ming of the *Lingbao* in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Golden Gates and Seven-Jewel Jeweled Terrace of the Mysterious Capital,
the thirty-six divisions of the revered scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
the Supreme Ministers and Prime Counselors,
the Supreme Protectors and Grand Tutors,
the Twenty-Four Perfected of the *Taiping* Lower Teaching,
the King of Total Perfection of the Western City,
the Perfected of the Great Unity,
the Lord of Life of the Eastern Marchmount’s Upper Minister,
the Two Perfected of Determined Records and Life-Preservation,
the divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens,
and all the divine officials and perfected spirits of the Three Realms—
we humbly beseech your vast compassion to turn and respond to this invocation.

**Prostrate Reflection:**

This servant has long dwelt within the Dharma gate yet remains unenlightened to its profound mysteries,
struggling to uphold the precepts while fortunate to preserve this vestment.
Yearning to advance in the Dao to nurture the spirit, I diligently cultivate yang virtue...

Vowing to ferry beings across and succor all things, I humbly accumulate yin merit. Whatever petitions arise, how could they be suppressed? When intention takes form, emotion stirs within. The officiant’s heart-words shall now be reverently proclaimed.

**Proclamation of Words:**
As the words declare, the sincerity is manifest, yet I dare to trouble the mysterious compassion, deepening my reverent awe.

I have heard: the three *qi* in their pure essence, the five phases in their radiant substance—at the dawn of clear and turbid commingling, before things took shape; at the first division of round and square, latent patterns unfolded in splendor. Swirling and intertwining, neither mist nor smoke; billowing and floating, now hidden, now revealed. Divine winds stir and surge, lifting the resounding music of the empty void; wondrous *qi* refines and molds, weaving and shaping the soaring script of the Dark Mystery. Our Most High fixed attention upon creation’s workings, commanding the August Person to take up brush and transmit its likeness. What the Five Numinous Ones contained became the texts of the Five Directions; what the Eight Convergences gathered became the seal-script of the Eight Heavens. The Yellow Register and White Tablets, the Red Writ and Jade Chapters—these join the luminous layers of the heavens, circumscribe the Great Ultimate, initiate what was not yet existent, transform humans and devas, conceal themselves in wordlessness, and sustain the growth of all things. Though the wondrous models of the Nine Altars differ in form, the mysterious statutes of the Three Registers share a single name and reality.

Now, the officiant so-and-so, blessed with abundant karmic affinity and steadfast in faith, possesses a destiny just flourishing and resources sufficient for all needs. Offering sincere devotion and turning in homage, he extends his aspirations to seek grace. The ritual offerings are arrayed, the sacred precinct solemnly prepared.

At this moment, empty hymns resound as auspicious signs open the azure heavens; incense wafts through the grotto-gates as propitious vapors gather beneath the canopy of the black-haired people. Nine-jointed chariots guide the soaring aerial carriages; threefold blossoms float above the altar of luminous traces. Entering stillness to audience the Origin, true light pervades all; seizing the moment to contemplate the wondrous, inner visions radiate brilliance. The response to sincerity is certain, and blessings manifest clearly.

At this pure dawn of the Dao-ritual, the assembly of dharma-adepts now offers the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to the realm of the Three Clarities. We, your servants, prostrate body, spirit, and life, bowing our heads to the earth. Reverently relying upon the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High, we dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense to the present emperor. We humbly pray that he may greatly receive the radiant mandate and distantly preserve his grand enterprise. Unshaken and uncollapsed, may his august longevity rise like a mountain forever; in countless ages, may his blessings flow like a sea ever deepening. As the sun ascends, may the rivers and mountains of the nine provinces be fully illumined; as the sky covers all, may the winds and rains of the four seasons never fail. May the people delight in peace, and all things be free from harm.

Now, we burn this incense in reverent devotion to the virtue of the Dao-Venerable, the Great Sage, and the host of Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may he preserve the heavens and endure forever.

At this pure dawn of the Dao-ritual, the assembly of dharma-adepts now offers the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to the realm of the Three Clarities. We, your servants, prostrate body, spirit, and life, bowing our heads to the earth. Reverently relying upon the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High, we dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense for the officiant’s ancestors, departed kin, and all his deceased family. We humbly pray that they may gaze upon the radiance of the Morning Star and emerge from the gates of the Yellow Springs; that the empty hymns of the azure heavens may resound, and they soar once more through celestial realms. May the characters of their black ledgers of sin be erased, and their names inscribed in the jade registers of the Perfected. Freed from the bonds of suffering, may they be born in the Land of Divine Joy. On the ninefold yang shores of the Dao, may they don the winds of immortality; upon the eightfold luminous steps of the Realized, may they behold and rely upon the jade countenance.

Now, we burn this incense in reverent devotion to the virtue of the Sutra-Venerable, the Great Sage, and the host of Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless.

At this pure dawn of the Dao-ritual, the assembly of dharma-adepts now offers the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to the realm of the Three Clarities. We, your servants, prostrate body, spirit, and life, bowing our heads to the earth. Reverently relying upon the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High, we dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense for the officiant so-and-so and all his household. We humbly pray that the radiant sun of auspicious splendor may illumine his body’s palace, and the gentle morning breeze may open the flourishing halls of his destiny. May his hundred channels flow smoothly, preserving the four great elements without peril; may his single *qi* meander harmoniously, governing the five spirits in shared rule. May his virtue’s fragrance flow through orchid and valerian, and his years rival the flourishing of the pine and cedar. May a hundred blessings converge, and a thousand transgressions be forever absolved.

Now, we burn this incense in reverent devotion to the virtue of the Master-Venerable, the Great Sage, and the host of Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may they merge with the Realized in truth.

**Chanting the Directions**
**Confession**

**Invocation of the Commanding Spirits**
**Threefold Invocation Hymn**
**Threefold Prostration**
**Reverent Recitation of the Sacred Titles**

Together with the officiating masters and all assembled, we humbly and sincerely address the Three Realms’ Most August, the Ten Directions’ Lofty Sages, the Heavenly Perfected and Celestial Lords of the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, the Ten Directions’ Master-Venerables and Sacred Hosts, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all majestic spirits:

We have heard that sincerity, when felt, must return to the Dao; devotion, when expressed in faith, can reach Heaven. For if there is scripture at the beginning, there must be manifest efficacy at the end. We, unworthy and dull, have presumptuously dwelt in the mysteries, long fed on sacred teachings yet lacking discernment. We dimly grasp the boundless nature of the celestial mind while pitying the world’s illusions and bewilderment by its splendor. Helpless in our self-delusion, we can scarcely stand alone. Yet by the grace of an ancient karmic bond, we have been granted the scriptural rites. Though our efforts are feeble, how can we escape the reproach of spirits?

We recall that the patron of this retreat, so-and-so, has reverently observed the celestial precepts, served the Celestial Emperor with utmost sincerity, turned thought toward the divine, and withdrawn the senses to reflect inward. Aspiring to the immortal wind without distance, he has diligently cultivated the Dao’s wonders. Thus, he has initiated the *qi*-cultivation, prepared the fast and offering, recited scriptures, and performed the Dao-circling. Burning incense and scattering flowers, he gazes upon the jeweled throne of the Jasper Terrace; auspicious smoke unfurls in radiant hues, evoking the luminous perfection of the Dharma-seat. The propitious sun ascends in splendor, seeking to move the Upper Prime and establish unbroken communion. Confessing transgressions and seeking absolution, he safeguards life and prolongs existence, breaks the wheel of suffering, and fosters the growth of good karma.

We implore the Most Sacred of the Azure Empyrean, the Lofty Perfected of the Crimson Towers. Your feathered guards array in perfect order, encompassing the earth below; your banners and standards shimmer, illuminating the vast heavens. Your refined music ascends to the Three Heavens, and your divine tones resound to the eight limits. You awaken the suffering realms of darkness and nourish the wellsprings of all life. You rescue the sentient, uplifting those yet to cross over.

May the imperial destiny endure through the ages, earth abiding and heaven eternal; may ministers and subjects fulfill their duties, clouds drifting and rain descending. May no one be left forsaken, and all things partake of spring. May the four seas share in blessings, and the five weapons remain sheathed. May the patron of this retreat flourish in sublime favor, ever bathed in the true wind. May his office and rank ascend with the sun, and his lifespan rival heaven’s duration. May his household prosper in timely harmony, and his virtue’s star illumine his destiny. May the Dao’s *qi* refine him, his spirit-enclosure remain pure, a hundred spirits guard him, and ten thousand sages support him. May his family live in perfect accord, and his kin thrive. May the nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages ascend by wondrous merit; may the five sufferings and three paths be cleansed by good causes and flourish. By the power of this single sincerity, a hundred evils dissolve, ten thousand virtues gather like clouds, and a thousand blessings converge.

We humbly present this prayer, that the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy may be manifest above, and our devotion in surrender below may be fulfilled.

**Vows**
First, may the divine radiance descend and illumine.
Second, may the moon of the Dao shine forth.
Third, may grace extend to the nine earths.
Fourth, may sincerity reach the nine heavens.
Fifth, may the true spirits assemble.
Sixth, may the Dao’s *qi* pervade all.
Seventh, may the heavens open wide.
Eighth, may hells be shattered and destroyed.
Ninth, may the mysterious power be universally bestowed.
Tenth, may we ride the clouds and soar through empty space.
Eleventh, may all under heaven embrace virtue.
Twelfth, may the Dao transform without action.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**
**Meditation on the Spirits while Burning Incense**

The Incense Officials and Envoys, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all the attendant spirit-officials of the incense—may they now cause the place where I earlier ascended the altar at dawn to perform the Daoist rites to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar-green mushroom blossoms, and the assembled host of the hundred spirits and perfected beings, all gathered here before the incense burner. May it be wished that the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid banquet, convey the sincerity of my earlier petition, and swiftly transmit it directly to the Most Perfect and Boundless Dao of the Utmost Truth, the Three Clarities’ August Sages, and the Golden Portal Jade Emperor, Supreme Sovereign of the Vast Heaven. The dawn rites of the Great Offering to the Heavenly Net are now concluded.
