### *Evening Audience Ritual from the Jade Register’s Ritual for Salvation*

The ritual proceeds according to form. All pay homage to the master and visualize as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Divine Incantation:**
The Five Stars blaze on high, auspicious *qi* drifts and floats.
The Primordial Beginning gathers the spirits; Heaven and Earth intermingle.
Jade talismans and precious seals command the subtle and the hidden.
Fire is cast, might is displayed—no treachery or evil lingers.
The Ten Thousand Demons tremble and submit; chaos and corruption dissolve.
Monstrosities are crushed, wickedness erased; the *qi* of the Dao circulates freely.
Divine radiance illuminates the night; shadows and darkness are wholly withdrawn.
The myriad spirits descend in reverence, riding the winds on fans of light.
All beings attain fulfillment; grace pervades the divine lands.
Harmony unites with the Dao—true indeed!

**Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.**

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Three *Qi*, Supreme Lord of the Dao, Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within your servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Dragon-Riders bearing incense, the Golden Lads attending the fragrance, the Jade Maidens scattering flowers, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman-Officers and Day-Guarding Incense Spirits—thirty-six of each.

Let them emerge, clad in solemn attire, their robes and sashes adorned with hanging tassels.
Summon the Land Spirit of the Mysterious Altar and the local deities of the sacred precinct.

This evening, your servant ascends the altar to perform the Daoist rites, reverently submitting this petition to express the sincerest devotion of my heart. May the luminous *qi* of the Supreme Ten Directions’ Perfected Ones and the radiant light of the Numinous Treasure descend, flowing into the bodies of your servants, that the sincerity of this offering may swiftly reach the presence of the Most High Limitless Dao’s Three Pure Ones and Supreme Saints, the Jade Emperor of the Golden Gate in the Vast Heaven, the Merciful Sovereign of the Eastern Ultimate and Azure Mystery Emperor, the Celestial Thearchs of the Purple Tenuity and Northern Culmen, the Heavenly Thearch of the Purple Tenuity, the August Earthly Deity of the Rear Land, the Great Emperor of Eastern Azure Radiance, the Great Emperor of Southern Culmination and Longevity, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Thearch of the Void, the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity, the Thearch of the Lesser Tenuity, the Perfected Sovereign of the Golden Gate in the Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace of the Jade Capital in the Mysterious Metropolis, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmination, Western Numinosity, and Northern Perfection, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the host of Great Saints who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Greatly Compassionate and Greatly Merciful Savior Perfected Ones, the Salvation Perfected Ones, the Greatly Benevolent Perfected Ones, the Life-Registering Perfected Ones, the Universally Saving Perfected Ones, the Dharma-Liberating Perfected Ones of the Fragrant Grove Assembly, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens, the Perfected Lords of the Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure Scriptures and Registers, the Perfected Ladies of the Orthodox Unity Lineage’s Three Female Masters, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all true numina.

May your vast compassion deign to cast its luminous gaze upon us.

Your servant has heard that in the formless and fathomless, the ancestral *qi* wondrously congealed within primordial chaos; through the formation of shapes and images, the true essence shimmered forth in the vast expanse. By the Five Great Ones, the cosmic pattern was unfurled; upon the Three Spirits, the ultimate was established. The Dao followed the Primordial Beginning, its brilliance illumining the midst of the Cavernous Auxiliary; the teachings were expounded by the August Void, transforming and nurturing all within the earth and heavens. There is no scripture that fails to deliver, and all who are moved shall be answered.

Your servants now dwell in an enlightened age, fortuitously encountering this auspicious gathering. We bear the jade tablets of the Nine Pures and wear the jeweled texts of the Three Caverns. Though we have bound ourselves in fellowship within the cloud-sealed chambers, we have not yet matched the lofty strides of the perfected. Following the dusty paths of the world, we have failed to awaken to the Mysterious Principle. Only by the guidance of our masters’ treasure have we been led, and by the imperial grace have we been illuminated. May the profound reckoning be lenient, for we still serve the true vehicle. The golden statutes resound with benevolent winds, making the salvation of beings our urgent task; the jade laws uphold the transformative sun, placing the deliverance of creatures first. For all who take refuge, how dare we neglect this petition?

Your servant reverently receives the sacred edict, venerating and cultivating the jade registers, devoutly offering them for the spirit of [Name], strictly adhering to the words of the ritual. We purify the Mysterious Altar to conduct the rites, respectfully ascending the fast in accordance with the jade registers. We present the jade tablets to the Ten Splendors and scatter golden flowers across the Five Realms. May your sagely gaze extend and your blessings multiply. Command the earthly deities to protect, escort, and welcome with joy; may [the spirit] transcend the immortal realms and attain the heavens of carefree bliss. May fortune and prosperity bless the nation and grace the world.

On this evening, as we ascend the altar to perform the Daoist rites, we, the ritual assembly, now offer the first pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense rise to the heavens, directly ascending to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

Your servants prostrate body, spirit, and life, bowing our heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones and the host of saints in the Ten Directions. May the merit of this incense aid in the deliverance of [Name]. Humbly we pray that their spirit may wander the Purple Culmen, drifting through the Mysterious Void. Sheltered beneath the mushroom canopy, may their true nature congeal, secretly sustaining the sacred lineage; treading upon the lotus dais, may they stride freely, bestowing blessings upon their ancestral line. Now, as we burn this incense, we take refuge in the great virtues of our masters and the host of perfected saints. After attaining the Dao, may they abide eternally, harmonizing with the Dao—true indeed!

On this evening, as we ascend the altar to perform the Daoist rites, we, the ritual assembly, now offer the second pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense rise to the heavens, directly ascending to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.

Your servants prostrate body, spirit, and life, bowing our heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones and the host of saints in the Ten Directions. May the merit of this incense aid in the deliverance of [Name]. Humbly we pray that they may ascend the immortal ranks, attaining the wondrous realm of the perfected. Strolling the jasper terraces and feasting in joy, may they journey to the jeweled gardens in carefree delight. May their blessed fruits arise naturally, their form and spirit both wondrous. May they shelter their ancestral line for a hundred generations and assist the sacred lineage for ten thousand years. Now, as we burn this incense, we take refuge in the great virtues of our masters and the host of perfected saints. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao—true indeed!

On this evening, as we ascend the altar to perform the Daoist rites, we, the ritual assembly, now offer the third pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense rise to the heavens, directly ascending to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.

Your servants prostrate body, spirit, and life, bowing our heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones and the host of saints in the Ten Directions. May the merit of this incense aid in the deliverance of [Name]. Humbly we pray that the source of their wisdom may shine brightly and the sea of their awakening grow clear. May they bathe in the courtyard of flowing fire and clouds, their steps guided by the celestial canopy. May they lodge in the halls of dawn’s rosy radiance, ascending the lofty paths of heaven. May their ancestors in the great ancestral temple all ascend to celestial ranks; may your servants, our three masters and five companions, and all who study the true teachings across generations, observe the wondrous mystery of the numinous origin and ascend to perfection in the formless. May they ride the crane-drawn chariots to the jasper capital, delighting in the flavor of the Dao; may they soar in the phoenix-borne carriages to the Purple Gate, feasting on the sounds of the Dharma. May they forever realize the non-action and eternally depart from the defiled. May the spirits of the Nine Dark Realms all be transformed and refined. Now, as we burn this incense, we take refuge in the great virtues of our masters and the host of perfected saints. After attaining the Dao, may they abide eternally, harmonizing with the Dao—true indeed!

The repentance and three bows are as before.

Your servants, [Name] and the assembly of officiants, reverently and earnestly submit this petition to the Most High Limitless Dao’s Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the host of Great Saints who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center and Heavenly Master, the Supreme Ministers, Supreme Chancellors, Supreme Protectors, Supreme Tutors, the Four Directors and Five Thearchs, the Twelve Ministers, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all true numina.

With reverence, we beseech Your vast compassion to cast its luminous gaze upon us.

We have heard that the Pure Tenuity spreads its transforming influence, unfolding the Seven Divisions to govern the heavens; the Vermilion Clarity unfolds its chart, stabilizing the Five Scriptures to nurture all beings. The myriad sages transmit the registers of salvation for the living, while the Three Origins inaugurate the grace of extended radiance. From antiquity to the present, this blessed continuity has brought heaven and humanity to rejoicing.

Thus, in this fast, we honor the Jade Registers, faithfully adhering to the precepts of the sacred scriptures; we invoke the grace of the Azure Mystery, upholding the protection of the divine chariot’s blessings. Earnestly we pray that [Name]’s spirit may soar upon the Jade Ford at the Eastern Well, clarifying the blossom of the heart; may it display golden splendor in the Southern Cinnabar, refining and forging nature and consciousness. May it ascend to the divine at the Purple Ultimate, eternally bestowing blessings upon the imperial house.

Above, may the celestial chart shine in serene clarity, and the earthly records rest in tranquil peace. May the warp and weft of the cosmos reveal their harmony, and wind and cloud fall silent. May the five weapons be sheathed, and the myriad states bathe in the wind of benevolence and longevity; may the hundred grains flourish abundantly, and the four seas attain the zenith of sagely governance. May the talismans and scriptures gleam with auspicious brilliance, and literary models extend to the farthest borders.

May forests and valleys become havens for the perfected, attaining the wonders of the six penetrations; may mist and clouds savor the Dao, swiftly fulfilling the perfection of the ten thousand practices. In the hidden depths of the unseen, whether flying, swimming, moving, or growing—all shall equally receive the transforming blessings, transcending the mechanisms of karmic rebirth.

May all sentient beings together ascend the shore of the Dao.
Thus shall the great transforming compassion of the Most High Heavenly Worthy be manifest above, and the sincerity of our reverent submission be answered below.

We respectfully submit this petition for Your hearing.

**Vow and Invocation**
Preserve the spirit and offer incense.

Fragrant Palace Attendants, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all spirit-officials of incense—may this place where your servant has ascended the altar in the evening audience to perform the Dao be naturally suffused with the golden-fluid elixir and the radiance of cinnabar-green essence. May the hundred numinous perfected gather here before the incense burner. Through the resonance of sincere intent, may such-and-such a spirit ascend and be delivered, attaining the fruit of celestial perfection and universally bestowing grace upon family and realm.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke, conveying the sincerity of your servant’s petition with swift dispatch to the Most High and Perfect Dao of the Three Clarities, the August Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven, and the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate, the Azure Mystery Emperor, before their Way.

**Exiting the Hall Hymn**
The evening rite of the *Jade Register* for deliverance and support is now complete.
