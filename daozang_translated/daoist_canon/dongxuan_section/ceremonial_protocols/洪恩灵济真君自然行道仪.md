**The Natural Ritual of the Dao for the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace and Numinous Aid**

The ritual proceeds according to form.
All pay homage, the master meditates as prescribed.

Golden perfection, green radiance,
illumine the Three Heavens.
Crimson clouds soar through the cinnabar skies,
as all heavens rein in their chariots.
Dawn’s light unfolds the day,
dispelling shadows and gloom.
The Nine Subtleties shake the void,
the Five Stars wheel in their courses.
Myriad immortals respond to the resonance,
naturally wondrous and mysterious.
In the distant dark, their forms disperse,
dividing into a hundred thousand manifestations.
The luminous Pearl of the Dao shines resplendent,
auspicious signs descend upon the altar’s heavens.
Revealing the hidden, bestowing grace,
they harmonize with the Three Fields of Cinnabar.
*Response:* In unity with the Dao, they merge with perfection.

**The Dharma Drum is struck twenty-four times.**

Great Supreme, Primordial Lord of the Five Numinous Powers,
Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within our bodies
the Three and Five Merit Officials,
the Attendants of the Left and Right Fragrant Palaces,
the Golden Lads of Incense,
the Jade Maidens of Transmission,
the Incense Officials of the Day,
the Merit Officials,
the Three Qi True Spirits—
hasten to report to the Five Great Marshals of the Borderlands:
Wei, Zhao, Diao, Yue, and Xu,
the Heavenly Soldiers and Mighties,
the Divine Officials of the Left and Right.

We now ascend the altar to perform the ritual,
reverently obeying the sacred decree,
solemnly conducting this fast and offering,
praying in gratitude for vast grace.
Our sincere petitions have been recorded and presented.
May the true, life-generating qi descend,
flowing into our bodies,
so that the words we now utter
swiftly reach the presence of
the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens,
the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens.

**Invoking the Dharma Titles**

We, your humble servants, [Name] and the assembled altar officials,
with utmost sincerity, jointly proclaim:

To the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens,
To the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens,
To the Sacred Father, the True Lord of Loyal Valor and Radiant Brilliance,
To the Sacred Mother, the Immortal Consort of Benevolent Longevity and Gentle Virtue,
To the Sacred Consort, the Lady of Jing State, the Immortal Consort of Harmonious Aid, Benevolent Constancy, and Responsive Perfection,
To the Lady of Wei State, the Immortal Consort of Kindly Aid, Reverent Tranquility, and Serene Grace,
To the Sacred Brothers, Sacred Sisters-in-Law, Sacred Uncles, Sacred Sons-in-Law, Sacred Sons, Sacred Daughters, Sacred Nephews, Sacred Grandsons,
To the Assembled Ladies,
To the Sacred Kin of the Entire Palace,
To the Five Great Marshals of the Borderlands: Wei, Zhao, and Diao,
To the Two Marshals Yue and Xu,
To the Spirit of the Year Star,
To the City Gods and Local Deities,
To the Earth Gods of this Palace,
To the Divine Officers of the Registers,
To the Host of Sages of the Offering Altar,
To all responsive and mighty numina—
we humbly beseech your sagely compassion,
to deign to look upon us with penetrating insight.

We have heard that at the dawn of kalpas, in primordial chaos,
the wondrous Dao embraced all without form.
When qi was pure and lofty, serene and clear,
it was called the Root of Heaven, establishing the ultimate pole.
From the vastness of the One Primordial,
the myriad patterns unfolded.
Sun and moon shone brightly,
resplendent through ancient and modern times.
Spirits and deities manifested in glory,
majestic above and below.
Flowing humility dispels excess without error,
blessing the good and punishing the wanton without fail.
According to the resplendent jade texts,
the treasure scrolls are opened and proclaimed.
With eyes fixed, we preserve it,
drawing from courtly rites to offer homage.
With hearts undivided,
we ride the morning qi to clarity and brightness.
Adorned with the echo of pure wind,
we vibrate the resonant tones to the eight directions.
Fragrant mists rise,
weaving auspicious qi through the layered heavens.
Crimson chariots in splendid array,
golden tablets and feathered robes graceful and elegant.
A hundred spirits receive their offices,
the Three Realms attend the imperial carriage.

Today, as we conduct this ritual,
ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
we, the assembled Dharma hosts,
now offer the first pinch of incense.
*Response:* The incense reaches the Palace of Numinous Aid,
pervading the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens to form a canopy of blossoms,
offered to the manifestly numinous and universally aiding Venerable Lord of Vast Grace.

May this fragrant smoke
be offered to the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens,
and to the true immortals and sacred hosts of the Palace of Numinous Aid.

We devote our bodies and lives,
reverently relying on the True Lords and sacred hosts.
Through the merit of this pinch of incense,
we humbly invoke the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens,
the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens—
their virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth,
their merit pervades creation.
Through wondrous and marvelous efficacy,
they bestow numinous responses to the eight directions.
Upright and enlightened,
they uphold the imperial enterprise for a hundred million years.
Their resplendent writings,
like rain and dew, nourish all.
Today, we burn this incense,
returning to rely on the great sagely virtue of the True Lords and sacred hosts.
After attaining the Dao,
may they preserve Heaven and endure forever.
*Response:* In unity with the Dao, they merge with perfection.

The Great Ming arises in the east,
we serve with utmost reverence.
Radiant and glorious, riding the light,
they succor the hidden and manifest, ascending at dawn.
Today, as we conduct this ritual,
ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
we, the assembled Dharma hosts,
now offer the second pinch of incense.
*Response:* The incense reaches the Palace of Numinous Aid,
pervading the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens to form a canopy of treasures,
offered to the luminously manifest and universally aiding Venerable Lord of Vast Grace.

May this fragrant smoke
be offered to the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens,
and to the true immortals and sacred hosts of the Palace of Numinous Aid.

We devote our bodies and lives,
reverently relying on the True Lords and sacred hosts.
Through the merit of this pinch of incense,
we pray for the August Emperor,
humbly wishing him ten thousand years of longevity,
his brightness equaling the Two Luminaries,
unified in culture and governance,
with chariots and writings extending to the eight directions.
May he be sagely and divine,
with rites and music flourishing through a thousand ages.
May the weapons of the four frontiers be stilled,
may the myriad regions enjoy abundant harvests.
May blessings protect the Crown Prince,
extending his sagely years for a thousand autumns.
May the imperial destiny be exalted,
its great foundation enduring for ten thousand generations.
May we, your servants, assist in the harmony and prosperity,
as all within the borders receive auspicious favor.
May the three seasons bring no harm,
may the four seas remain eternally clear.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense,
returning body and life to the virtue of the Perfected Saints and the Great Sagely Host,
who, having attained the Dao,
preserve heaven’s enduring existence,
harmonizing: in unity with the Dao and the True.

With clarity and brightness at dawn,
we face and ascend to heaven,
morning radiance illuminating the courtly ranks,
sunlight unfolding within night’s ravines.
On this day of devotion,
we ascend the altar and perform the Dao,
offering these three pinches of incense,
harmonizing: may the incense reach the Palace of Numinous Aid,
pervading the nine celestial palaces as clouds form a canopy,
to make offering to the Perfected Immortals and Sagely Host of the Palace of Numinous Aid.
May this fragrant smoke
make offering to the August Emperor of the Golden Gates of the Nine Heavens,
the August Emperor of the Jade Gates of the Nine Heavens,
and the Perfected Immortals and Sagely Host within the Palace of Numinous Aid.

We, your servants, return body and life,
reverently relying upon the Perfected Lords and Sagely Host.
May the merit of this incense offering
flow to the Crown Prince, the imperial screens,
the chief ministers and officials,
the people of the realm,
and all beings within the world.

We humbly pray that the revolving constellations shine forth,
disaster stars swiftly retreat from the palace walls.
May auspicious portents align with the celestial balance,
favorable stars descend upon the stations of destiny.
May all look up to the radiant transformation,
ever gazing upon the majestic countenance.
May the people be united in kindness,
the realm and its households embodying great peace.
May teachings and doctrines spread and flourish,
the Dao’s transformative power shine ever brighter.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense,
returning body and life to the virtue of the Perfected Saints and the Great Sagely Host,
who, having attained the Dao,
forever preserve eternal life,
harmonizing: in unity with the Dao and the True.

*Invocation of the Directions*
*Repentance of the Directions*

**Triple Invocation Hymn, Triple Reverence, Reaffirmation of the Sacred Titles**

We, your humble servants, [Name] and the assembled officiants of this altar, with utmost sincerity, reverently invoke the sacred ranks once more.

We have heard that to assist the myriad immortals is to flourish in profound subtlety, and to perform a single good deed is to summon blessings as swiftly as echo follows sound. The radiance of the Dao’s transformative power shines resplendent; the descent of the divine spirits’ gaze overflows with majesty. What is felt is met with response; no plea goes unanswered.

By the sacred decree, we reverently conduct the Golden Register rites, manifesting gratitude for the gods’ mighty works. We, your servants, humbly measure the purity of our long-held devotion and look up to repay the sustaining power of the Dao. Like the great luminous tree of dawn, we scatter the morning court’s rising sun; like the pine blossoms’ offering, we waft fragrant winds across the altar’s expanse.

Our reverent devotion in sacrifice burns fervently; our awe arises from the depths of sincerity. Arrayed before the imperial throne, we wondrously unfold the immortal teachings. The three karmas and six senses remain uncleansed of lifetimes’ transgressions; the nine luminaries and ten poles merely reflect the radiance of the host of sages. We but seek absolution for our faults and hope that grace may flow abundantly.

Above, we pray for the empire’s enduring stability and the sovereign’s boundless longevity. May the myriad lands sing of prosperous fortune, and the four seas rejoice in governance without strife. May weapons of war be stilled, and the harvests overflow. Thus may all beings—whether moving or still, great or small, high or low—equally bathe in the nurturing growth of heaven and earth, all relying on creation’s power for their existence.

May those who wear starry crowns and jade hairpins delight in their forest and stream retreats; may those who till fields and dig wells rejoice in the songs of crossroads and fields. May the teachings flourish and the scriptures spread, so that above, the true lords’ great compassion is made manifest, and below, your servants’ devotion in submission is fulfilled.

We humbly present this invocation. Our vows are made.

May the Fragrance Burner, the Envoys of the Incense Bureau, the Divine Lords of Left and Right, and all attendant spirit-officials of the incense cause golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms to spontaneously arise in the place of this morning’s audience. May the hundred numinous spirits and assembled perfected ones gather here before this incense burner. May our sincere devotion ascend on high, bringing peace to household and state. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the rising incense smoke, conveying the words we have just presented, swiftly and directly to the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, before the August Presence of the Vast Grace Perfected Lord, the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, before the August Presence of the Vast Grace Perfected Lord. May the Vast Grace Numinous Aid Perfected Lord naturally complete the ritual of the Dao.
