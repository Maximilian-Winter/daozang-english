### *The Rite of Morning Audience for Assembling Blessings of the Venerable Sovereign of Vast Grace and Numinous Aid*

The ritual proceeds according to form.
Each pays reverence; the master visualizes as prescribed.

Golden perfection records the rosy clouds, resplendent across the Three Heavens.
Crimson auroras soar through the cinnabar skies, where all heavens guide their chariots.
Dawn’s radiance awakens the day, dispelling all shadows of yin.
The Nine Subtleties shake the void; the Five Stars wheel in their courses.
Myriad immortals respond to the resonance, spontaneously wondrous and mysterious.
In the profound and obscure, their forms disperse, dividing into hundreds and thousands.
The luminous Pearl of the Dao shines forth; auspicious omens descend upon the altar’s heavens.
Manifesting hidden blessings, they merge with the Three Fields of Radiance.

**Response:** In harmony with the Dao, united with the True.

*Sound the ritual drum twenty-four times.*

Reverently we gaze upward, beseeching the Sacred Compassion to condescend and cast its penetrating gaze.

This servant has heard:
That which gives birth to Heaven and Earth is the primordial origin of the undifferentiated Qi.

The Bureaus of Yin and Yang, wondrously dispersing the myriad differentiated forms.
They array the sun, moon, and stars in the workings of Qian, establish mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks in the weave of Kun.
All things take shape, yet of these, humans are most noble.
Every kind nurtured into being relies wholly on the benevolence of transformation and nurturance.

This servant, by the name of [X], has long been bound by karmic affinity and thus gained intimacy with the true teachings.
Adorned with starry pins and feathered robes, I have been steeped in the profound grace of rain and dew.
Entrusted with duties and performing rites, I have partaken in the subtle transformations of the Dark Prime’s embroidered splendor.

For every prayer and petition, I humbly beseech responsive communion.

By imperial decree, we reverently undertake this pure jiao offering to gather blessings for the state and the household.
This morning, as we perform the Dao rites, we, the assembled dharma hosts, now raise the first pinch of incense, chanting in unison:

*May this incense reach the Palace of Numinous Aid,
pervade the Nine Heavens’ golden towers to form a canopy of blossoms,
and offer sustenance to the Illustrious Lord of Vast Grace and Universal Salvation.*

May the smoke of this incense serve as offering
to the Lord of Vast Grace of the Nine Heavens’ golden towers,
and to the perfected immortals and sacred hosts of the Palace of Numinous Aid.

We, your servants, surrender body, spirit, and life to the Lord and the assembled sages.
Through the merit of this pinch of incense,
we reverently pray for the August Emperor, His Majesty.

May his Dao harmonize with that of Tang and Yu, his achievements equal those of Xuan and Hao.
May he govern with effortless grace, his chariots and script unifying all under heaven.
May he face the screen and receive the court at dawn, jade and silk arriving from distant shores.
May fortune and longevity forever attend his sacred person,
and loyal ministers capably assist his imperial designs.

Now, therefore, we kindle this incense,
surrendering to the virtue and power of the Perfected Lords, the Great Sage Hosts, and the Most True,
that after attaining the Dao, they may preserve heaven and endure eternally.
*In harmony: With the Dao, united in truth.*

At this dawn rite of the Dao, we invoke the Dharma assembly,
offering this second pinch of incense.
*In harmony: The incense ascends to the Palace of Numinous Aid,
pervading the Nine Heavens’ jade towers to form a canopy of treasures,
as offering to the Lord of Manifest Numinosity and Vast Grace.*

May the smoke of this incense serve as offering
to the Lord of Vast Grace of the Nine Heavens’ jade towers,
and to the perfected immortals and sacred hosts of the Palace of Numinous Aid.

We, your servants, surrender body, spirit, and life to the Lord and the assembled sages.
Through the merit of this pinch of incense,
we reverently pray that its blessings flow to the Four Peaks and Nine Governors,
to the myriad officials and all ministers,
who with refined virtue assist the turning of the times,
and with ordered grace share in benevolent rule.
May they reverently illuminate and aid the One Sovereign,
presenting counsel and sustaining all governance.

We humbly invoke the Perfected Lord,
who harmonizes with and augments the mysterious workings,
upholding the sagely transformation.
May he magnify the imperial court’s grandeur,
that its glory endure for a hundred million myriad years.
May the luminous numinous Dao be manifest,
and the dual forces of yin and yang unite in virtue.

Now, therefore, we kindle this incense,
surrendering to the virtue and power of the Perfected Lords, the Great Sage Hosts, and the Most True,
that after attaining the Dao, they may forever preserve enduring peace.
*In harmony: With the Dao, united in truth.*

At this dawn rite of the Dao, we invoke the Dharma assembly,
offering this third pinch of incense.
*In harmony: The incense ascends to the Palace of Numinous Aid,
pervading the Nine Heavens’ palatial towers to form a canopy of clouds,
as offering to the perfected immortals and sacred hosts of the Palace of Numinous Aid.*

May the smoke of this incense serve as offering
to the Sacred Father and Sacred Mother, the Immortal Consorts and their retinue,
and to the perfected immortals and sacred hosts of the Palace of Numinous Aid.

We, your servants, surrender body, spirit, and life to the Lord and the assembled sages.
Through the merit of this pinch of incense,
we reverently pray that its blessings flow to the Nine Provinces and Four Seas,
to all the people under heaven,
that every household be filled and wives and children dwell in peace,
that the five grains ripen and the people flourish.

We humbly invoke the Sacred Father and Sacred Mother, the Immortal Consorts and their retinue,
and all the sacred hosts of the Hall of Life-Registration.
May the Nine Heavens resound with celebration,
and the Five Emperors oversee life’s unfolding.
May the essence of the Three Qi’s radiance suffuse all,
and the purest essence of heaven and earth unite in harmony.
Rooting life and nurturing growth,
may they witness the sincerity of the people’s earnest prayers.
Summoning the spirits and commanding the winds,
may they grant every household the beauty of unbroken lineage and continuous progeny.
All who turn in devotion shall have their prayers answered.

Now, therefore, we kindle this incense,
surrendering to the virtue and power of the Perfected Lords, the Great Sage Hosts, and the Most True,
that after attaining the Dao, they may forever preserve enduring life.
*In harmony: With the Dao, united in truth.*

*Chanting the directions*
*Confession*

To the One and Two we invoke, with the Three Rituals we honor,
Reverently proclaiming once more the sacred ranks—
We, the assembled officiants and all present before the altar,
with utmost sincerity and solemnity, now humbly address the august thrones.

We have heard that the Nine Qi intertwine and bind,
knitting the root of life at the Purple Portal.
The Three Origins nurture and sustain,
congealing the stem of destiny within the Yellow Chamber.
Thus, the embryonic soul and spirit,
the completeness of life’s mandate,
rely upon the blending of red and white, blue and yellow, black.
With reverent assent and obedience,
we align with the wondrous signs that shake heaven and earth.
With devout chanting and reverence,
we harmonize with the mystery of yin embracing yang.
Though form is bestowed within the central realm,
qi is truly received from the Primordial One.

We, your servants, uphold the celestial mandate,
acting on behalf of the people below.
We perform the fast, recite the scriptures,
burn incense, and practice the Dao.
May numinous blessings shine afar and near,
and luminous fortune gather for the nation and its households.

We humbly implore the vast outpouring of boundless grace,
the generous bestowal of the mysterious creation.
For all the supplications of the people,
only the great virtue remains impartial.
May the living receive the glory of lineage and progeny,
and the departed be spared the lament of Ruo’ao.
May the Three Luminaries shine resplendent,
the Four Qi radiant and clear,
wind and rain harmoniously balanced,
and the people joyfully nurtured.

Thus, may the enlightened governance of the Perfected Lords and their great compassion be manifest above,
while below, our devotion in surrender finds its answer.

We respectfully present this petition for your hearing.

**Twelve Vows**
**Invoking the Spirit, Burning Incense**

Incense Officials and Envoys,
Left and Right Divine Lords,
Attendant Incense Spirits—
At this place of early audience,
may golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms spontaneously arise.
May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones
converge here before this incense burner.
May our sincerity ascend on high,
bringing peace to the nation and its households.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions
attend the fragrant smoke,
conveying our words of invocation
swiftly to the Golden Gates of the Nine Heavens,
before the august presence of the Vast Grace Perfected Lords of the Nine Heavens,
the Vast Grace Perfected Lords of the Jade Gates of the Nine Heavens.
