**Fascicle Two of the Repentance Ritual of the Most High Numinous Treasure Ten Directions Responsive Titles Celestial Worthy**

At that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, having heard the Most High expound the karmic causes of good and evil, and the matters of retribution being settled, bowed in reverence and praise. With utmost sincerity and earnestness, he addressed the Most High again, saying:

"Sentient beings, deluded and ignorant, are enmeshed in the snares of the world and cannot awaken. They remain trapped in the cycle of sin, drifting through birth and death, ever abiding in suffering. Gazing up to the Merciful Worthy, they yearn for enlightenment, that in future lives as men and women, they may turn their hearts to the good Dao and not fall into the Three Wretched Realms."

The Most High replied:

"All sentient beings, casting off one body to receive another, have for kalpas beyond measure allowed their bodies, minds, thoughts, and intentions—along with their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths—to accumulate manifold sins. Deluded and ensnared by sensory contact, they commit transgressions both inwardly and outwardly. The six senses arise in turn, each begetting the next. The roots of sin grow ever deeper, and with every thought, they commit boundless wrongs—sins as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges. These ingrained habits, long accumulated, reside within the body. From past causes to present ones, from kalpa to kalpa, they cannot be reckoned. Yet with a single thought of turning the heart, all may be purified.

It is like a bright mirror, its surface obscured by dust and grime, all manner of impurities gathered to cloud its clarity, leaving it dimmed within and without. But should it one day encounter a skilled craftsman who wipes, polishes, and washes it, its inner and outer surfaces will gleam with radiance, illuminating all near and far, restored to its original brightness. Why is this so? Because its nature was originally pure.

Sentient beings are likewise: their spirits are fundamentally pure, free from all defilement. Yet after receiving form, they gradually become stained by the dust of inner and outer impurities, accumulating transgressions. The six roots, six desires, six emotions, six entrances, six defilements, six thieves, six dusts, and six consciousnesses discriminate between right and wrong, recklessly committing foul and corrupt acts. Darkness spreads within and without, and their true nature is lost. Adrift in the cycle of death and rebirth, they perpetually generate the causes of sin. When retribution and karmic conditions converge, they enter hell, suffering myriad torments, sinking for ten thousand kalpas.

Out of compassion, I take pity on sentient beings. Thus, from kalpa to kalpa, I manifest in the world—now as a sage, now as an ordinary being—assuming various responsive forms to teach and transform them. I propagate scriptures and precepts, awakening and delivering them, that they may escape suffering. Yet sentient beings, lacking good fortune, fail to awaken. Even the sages, immortals, and perfected beings of the heavens constantly desire that people cleanse evil and cultivate good, for then benevolent spirits will protect and guard them. If sins remain bound to the body and one does not repent, malevolent spirits will bring calamity, and they will suffer in birth and death.

All sentient beings know only to adorn their faces, clothing, hands, and feet outwardly, yet do not know to cleanse their bodies and minds inwardly to dissolve the bonds of sin. If, like the face, hands, feet, and clothing, they diligently purify themselves, then good will surely find its place, and what fault could reach them? Now, I shall distinguish these matters further, and each should repent accordingly."

**Chapter on Repentance for Killing Living Beings**

The Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying:

"All sentient beings, past and present, unmindful of compassion, kill and harm living beings, devouring them insatiably. Whether for parents, themselves, their children, grandchildren, or kinfolk, or for following omens of good and ill fortune, gathering in villages and hamlets, they kill living beings beyond count. Whether for offering sacrifices to ancestors, praying to the earth gods, or celebrating at the hearth, they kill living beings without measure.

They kill cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, donkeys, horses, chickens, and other domesticated creatures; or deer, foxes, hares, tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves, and other beasts of the mountains and wilds; or geese, ducks, crows, magpies, turtledoves, kites, owls, teals, egrets, and other flying birds; or insects, snakes, vipers, scorpions, wasps, centipedes, millipedes, crickets, ants, and the like; or soft-shelled turtles, terrapins, tortoises, alligators, fish, shrimp, sturgeon, crabs, snails, clams, frogs, and other aquatic creatures; or dung beetles, midges, moths, caterpillars, earthworms, and other small insects; or mosquitoes, fleas, lice, mayflies, and other ephemeral creatures.

They fly hawks and unleash hounds, exhausting forests and draining marshes to kill living beings; or set nets and spread snares, or set fires to mountains to kill living beings; or wield bows and arrows, knives and staves to kill living beings; or, whether sitting, lying, walking, or standing, crush living beings with their hands or trample them underfoot; or build houses and construct walls, killing living beings; or plow fields and sow crops, digging pits and excavating earth, killing living beings; or cut grass and level ground, gather firewood and fell trees, killing living beings; or pluck flowers and pick fruit, raise silkworms and dry cocoons, killing living beings; or light lamps and kindle fires, turning their backs to the light and facing the dark, killing living beings; or divert water into burrows or pour boiling water on the ground, killing living beings; or drink water, eat rice, wash their hair, or bathe their bodies, killing living beings; or rip open wombs and break eggs, severing sinews and shattering bones, killing living beings; or open their mouths, form intentions, stretch out their hands, or move their feet, killing living beings; or before the Celestial Worthies, the great Dao, the true scriptures, and wondrous dharma, or all the sages, kill living beings; or under the three luminaries of heaven and earth, kill living beings; or on the Three Primes, Eight Festivals, Ten Straightfast Days, or during fasts, or in wind, rain, darkness, and gloom, kill living beings; or within sacred altars, numinous temples, or upon the seats of dharma assemblies, kill living beings; or in anger, sorrow, joy, or revelry, kill living beings; or when compounding medicines to heal the sick, kill living beings; or when life ends in their hands or death comes by the blade; or in military campaigns; or for vengeance; or relying on power and might."

Or relying on wealth and power; or severing heads and limbs, flaying skin and fur, searing with fierce fire, boiling in scalding water; or forcibly separating mother and child, cutting off gestation; or attacking the root of life, causing annihilation; or killing through terror, poison, or curses; or self-killing, instructing others to kill, intentional killing, accidental killing, killing by speech, killing by intention, killing by thought, killing by witnessing, killing by relaying orders. Such deeds, concealed within, remain unconfessed; without repentance, they bind one for kalpas unending. With reverent devotion, I sincerely bow in faith.

From kalpas immeasurable, I, so-and-so, have cast off bodies and received bodies; I may have committed the sins of killing described above, or my ancestors, parents, children, descendants, and kin may have committed such sins of killing, extending to the present. Today, I rely upon the grace of great compassion to attain thorough repentance, resolve karmic entanglements, and increase good affinities. May all the slain—feathered flocks, furred herds, and creeping creatures—by virtue of this extraordinary merit, each be transformed, liberated, and attain carefree transcendence.

I prostrate to the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, the True and Perfect.

**Chapter on the Repentance of the Three Karmas**

The Most High addressed the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, saying: All sentient beings, sunk in evil destinies without means of liberation, do so because of the three karmas of body, mind, and speech.

First, the sins of bodily karma: failing to reflect upon one’s own body, which receives the nurturing of the Two Modes, the illumination of the Three Luminaries, the sustenance of the Four Seasons, and the generation of the Five Agents, yet remains unaware of gratitude, reverence, or awe. Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which receives the nurture of parents, the instruction of teachers, yet does not uphold filial devotion. Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which receives the protection and transformation of kings and great ministers, yet does not cultivate loyalty and respect. Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which is recorded in the registers of sin and merit by all the sages, yet does not believe in the retribution of good and evil, assuming all is naturally enduring, remaining unaware, unafraid, unrepentant, unguarded, and careless—only craving refinement, indulging in evil influences, committing boundless killings, thefts, and sexual misconduct, violating norms and disrupting order, drinking to excess and acting wantonly.

Second, the sins of mental karma: the fire of ignorance burns ceaselessly. The six senses and three delusions race without restraint; from this arise all evils. Or conceiving the thought of stealing from the lofty sages, the sacred scriptures, secret registers, numinous shrines, pure precincts, gardens, flowers, fruits, and offerings to the Dharma. Or conceiving the thought of stealing from the state treasuries, the wise and the noble, as well as the lowly and foolish, all manner of things. Any object, if coveted in a single thought, constitutes theft. False imaginings of good and evil arise within; retribution for good and evil manifests without. Or conceiving thoughts of defying the Three Luminaries, belittling the multitude of sages. Or conceiving schemes in secret, plotting to wrong the virtuous. Or conceiving the thought of killing living beings, willfully harming creatures. Or conceiving deceitful, cunning, and treacherous thoughts, engaging in villainy and slander. Or conceiving envy toward those superior to oneself, harboring jealousy and self-importance. Or conceiving the thought of teaching others to do evil, causing them to transgress righteousness. Or conceiving the thought of ruining others’ successes, obstructing their good deeds. Or conceiving the thought of separating others from their kin, severing their bonds of affection.

Or conceiving the thought of violating scriptures and defying the Dharma, breaking fasts and transgressing precepts. Or beholding all forms and appearances, conceiving desires of every kind. Or toward all beings, sacred and profane, conceiving thoughts of ignorance and folly. Or conceiving the thought of turning from truth toward falsehood, believing in perverse and inverted views. Or conceiving the thought of obstinately clinging to one’s own ignorance and baseness, refusing to follow virtuous transformation. Or conceiving the thought of harming others to benefit oneself, injuring them to enrich oneself. Or conceiving thoughts of anger, hatred, stinginess, and greed, or of frivolity and mockery. Or conceiving the thought of remembering a single fault in another while forgetting their past kindness and righteousness. Or conceiving the thought of harming others with venomous words, or bringing calamity through fair speech. Or conceiving the thought of reckless fantasies and dreams, indulging in dissipation and impropriety. Or conceiving the thought of speaking one way while thinking another, praising to the face and slandering behind the back. Or conceiving the thought of seeking refuge in haste, then retreating without turning back.

All such thoughts, lacking the mind of equanimity, arise daily in the lives of beings.

Third are the sins of verbal karma. All men and women accumulate verbal transgressions as deep as kalpas. Or consuming the five pungent flavors and meat, filling and nourishing the body without shame or satiety, indulging all day in harsh speech, divisive words, deceit, and false accusations. Or toward the Most Perfect Great Dao, the Three Luminaries of Heaven and Earth, the precious scriptures and wondrous Dharma, the worthy and the elders, teachers and parents, the high and the low, the poor and the rich, the spirits in darkness and in light—uttering flowery and ornate words, never truthful or sincere. All curses and imprecations, slanderous and abusive speech, scolding the wind and cursing the rain, berating superiors and inferiors, mocking the foolish and the wise, responding to good with evil, fostering enmity and strife, speaking perversely to humiliate others, using clever words to delude the multitude, judging good and evil, sowing discord among kin and friends, passing off falsehood as truth, turning emptiness into substance, dwelling on others’ faults, extolling one’s own virtues, amplifying others’ grievances to advance oneself, boasting and deceiving, suppressing the good and upright.

Though reciting scriptures and teachings, inwardly harboring arrogance and falsehood, never truly taking refuge, yet claiming merit for oneself. When the Most Divine, all-hearing and upright, does not respond to flattery or supplication, one then generates slander and defamation. The sins of the three karmas arise in every moment, unceasing and unrecognized. Layer upon layer, they weigh down the boat; accumulating evil, one falls into ruin. Today, turning in sincerity, may all be repented.

We take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the Great Perfected Sages.

From kalpas without measure until this day, I, so-and-so, have cast off bodies and received bodies, and the sins of the three karmas I have committed are boundless and immeasurable, concealed within this form. Or perhaps the sins committed by my ancestors, and those for which I, so-and-so, now suffer retribution—relying on the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthies, may they deign to deliver and uplift me, dissolving the roots of the three karmas and purifying the six senses. May I be spared the punishments of the Nine Dark Realms: the body flayed by wind-knives, the heart pierced by iron halberds, molten bronze poured into the mouth, the tongue torn out. May I be delivered and liberated.

We prostrate ourselves before the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, the True and Perfect.

**Chapter on Releasing Enmity**

The Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: Of all the sufferings of sinking into evil destinies and the bitter toils of birth and death, none is so difficult to escape, nor so deeply entangled in mutual retribution, as the sin of enmity. All beings in the world of abandoning the worthy and forsaking the good have yet to awaken to the good Dao. All day long, they diligently increase their karmic deeds, unaware that harboring enmity brings no benefit to themselves. They merely see matters before their eyes and give rise to ignorance. Or they inwardly nurse grievances, vainly disturbing the heart’s core.

Little do they know that the gods who govern fate and oversee all within heaven and earth and the void, along with the spirits within the human body who record transgressions, record their resentments and submit them to the Celestial Palace, where their offenses are determined. Delivered to the courts of the netherworld, once they enter evil destinies, they endure every kind of suffering. Reborn among humans, they again become enemies. Age after age, life after life, without end—all is self-created and self-endured, as inseparable as form and shadow. How could one escape?

Thus, the perfected ones, in great matters, relinquish rank and even life itself; in small matters, they forsake adornments and sever attachments, strictly upholding emptiness and stillness, refraining from contention between self and others—all precisely to eliminate this enmity. Moreover, among one’s closest kin, where filial devotion and deep affection should naturally abound, discord instead prevails in many cases. This is all due to the weight of enmity from past lives, which causes such conditions in this present existence.

Those who serve as teachers, revered parents, elders, or superiors often impose expectations of service and repayment, and if these are not met, resentment arises. Those who are children, descendants, or family members often expect kindness, love, and nurturance, and if these fall short, resentment is born. Without expectations, how could resentment exist?

Resentment may arise toward heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries, and the exalted perfected sages; toward wind and rain, thunder and lightning, bitter cold and scorching heat; toward rulers, parents, teachers, and elders, or the six relations of kin; toward fields and gardens, homes and dwellings, the five grains and five flavors; toward hemp and silk, fine fabrics, fruits and vegetables; toward friends and associates, in struggles for fame and profit; in buying and selling, where prices are low on purchase and high on sale; in public and private disputes, with cunning words and twisted arguments.

With sincere heart, we pay homage to the Numinous Primordial Heavenly Worthy.
With sincere heart, we pay homage to the Treasure Radiance Heavenly Worthy.
With sincere heart, we pay homage to the Fragrant Virtue Heavenly Worthy.

We take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the great perfected sages.

From kalpas without beginning until this day, I, so-and-so, have cast off this body and taken on another, and the offenses of the three karmic actions I have committed are measureless and boundless, concealed within me. Moreover, the sins committed by my ancestors, as well as those for which I, so-and-so, now suffer retribution—relying upon the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthies, I pray that they may extend their deliverance, that the three karmic actions may be absolved at their source, and that the six senses may be purified. May I be delivered from the punishments of the Nine Hells below: the wind-knives that flay the body, the iron halberds that pierce the heart, the molten bronze poured into the mouth, and the tearing out of the tongue. May I be delivered and liberated.

We prostrate ourselves before the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, the True and Perfect.

Little do they know that the gods who govern fate and oversee all within heaven and earth and the void, along with the spirits within the human body who record transgressions, record their resentments and submit them to the Celestial Palace, where their offenses are determined...

Wind and rain, thunder and lightning, severe cold and scorching heat—all give rise to enmity. Lords and parents, teachers and elders, the six relations and kin—all give rise to enmity. Fields and gardens, homes and dwellings, the five grains and five flavors—all give rise to enmity. Hemp and silk, brocade and fine cloth, fruits and vegetables—all give rise to enmity. Friends and companions, contending for fame and profit—all give rise to enmity. Trading and bartering, buying cheap and selling dear—all give rise to enmity. Public and private litigation, crafty arguments and twisted words—through repentance and confession, the aforementioned enmities may be extinguished. The sins of enmity shall all be dissolved. Let each reflect and examine, that future matters may be amended. Cease from further transgressions, and be spared from endless cycles of karmic retribution, life after life. Whether sinking or stagnating, whether as human or celestial, the roots of evil shall be forever severed, and one shall roam free and at ease, no longer entangled. Reverently bow to the Ten Directions’ Most High, Perfect, and True Three Treasures.

Here ends the second scroll of *The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Ten Directions’ Responsive Invocation of the Heavenly Worthy’s Repentance Ritual*.
Here begins the tenth scroll of *The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Ten Directions’ Responsive Invocation of the Heavenly Worthy’s Repentance Ritual*: "The Chapter on Teachers, Lords, and Parents."

The Supreme One addressed the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, saying: All sentient beings receive transformation and nurturance from the great Dao of Heaven and Earth, entrusting their forms to their parents. Their parents carry them in their arms, nurse them at the breast, and endure cold and heat, darkness and light, sparing no effort in their upbringing. Yet when they grow, they become stained by evil destinies, indulging in lust, craving, and desire, swayed by joy and anger, sorrow and vexation. The three karmic actions and ten evils, the six senses and six dusts, the six entrances and six consciousnesses, the six roots and six thieves—gradually, they become inwardly and outwardly defiled, accumulating transgressions and burdens. They sink into worlds that forsake the worthy and mingle with the wicked, drowning in the dark prison of the river of love and death. Though they possess human form, in the myriad torments of hell, they differ not from birds and beasts. If not for a teacher to shatter their doubts and dissolve their obstructions, to dispel their attachments and remove their delusions, to reveal the great Dharma of the Three Vehicles, the myriad wondrous precepts, the scriptures and registers, talismans and charts, the rituals of repentance and merit, the secret formulas of longevity, and the feathered texts of deliverance—guiding them step by step, restraining and cultivating their practice, from near to far, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness, forming boundless karmic ties, and liberating their burdened bodies—then how could they ascend to offer blessings to the seven generations of ancestors and descend to aid all beings? Thus, teachers possess the grace of delivering the world, and parents possess the power of giving life. Their grace and power are towering and vast, boundless and immeasurable. Rightly should one reflect upon them, reverently obey, and cherish filial devotion.

Yet how base and shallow are sentient beings, bringing ruin upon themselves! In serving their teachers, lords, and parents, they lack gentleness, compliance, reverence, and care, nor do they offer filial devotion and love. From beginning to end, they are disobedient and unceasing. Their every action breeds resentment, and all becomes transgression. They feel no shame for failing to repay the grace of deliverance, nor do they rise to requite the debt of birth. If they persist in such evils, their sins grow heavier still. Without repentance and redirection, how can the source of their offenses be cleansed?

Today, so-and-so awakens, repents, and confesses: From beginningless time until this present life, whether abandoning the body to receive the Dharma, seeking the Dao and following a teacher, acting for oneself or others, or widely transmitting the scriptures and precepts—there has been no intent to honor the teacher, nor has there been faith and devotion. Broken vows and violated precepts have accumulated faults and multiplied transgressions. Or toward parents, the heart of reverence, filial devotion, and nurturance has been lost, and the grace of birth and nursing forgotten. The sins described above are boundless and immeasurable, binding one in the unseen realm and summoning karmic retribution. Yet by relying on the vast and divine majesty and the infinite power of compassion, they may be cleansed through repentance, all sins dissolved, and the roots of goodness strengthened. If the deceased are reborn among humans, may their affinity with the Dao be firm, their awakening to the true vehicle swift, and may they always dwell in peace, never falling into evil destinies. With wholehearted devotion, earnest resolve, and sincere reverence, they offer themselves to their teachers, lords, and parents, and with faith, they pay homage to the Ten Directions’ Greatly Compassionate and Supreme Worthy.

With devoted faith, they pay homage to the Great Sage, Perfectly True, Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

So-and-so today arouses the supreme intention for the Dao, relying on the power of great compassion, and in accordance with the invocation, so be it.

It is earnestly hoped that in past and present lives, the masters who transmitted the Dao, whether already divine or not yet sagely, whether already enlightened or not yet enlightened, may their Dao-heart remain firm, unshaken by ten thousand trials, swiftly entering the Great Vehicle to realize the eternal Dao, neither born nor extinguished, neither sinking nor decaying.

It is further hoped that in past kalpas and the present life, the seven generations of parents, whether sunken or stagnant, whether already reborn or not yet reborn, may ascend into the Dharma-gate.
May all evil and myriad karmic conditions be simultaneously liberated, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness, uniting with the Dao to become perfected.
They bow their heads to the Orthodox and True Three Treasures of the Ten Directions.

**The Hells Chapter**
At that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct bowed his head and addressed the Most High, saying: "The wondrous discourses of all chapters have been heard and understood. Yet I have not learned how many kinds of hells there are, and how their severity varies."

The Most High replied: "Since cultivation has distinctions, how could the hells lack degrees of severity? When a person dies, the Earth Bureau reports to the Heavenly Emperor-Kings of the Upper Realms and the Three Primordials and Four Offices, who determine the register of sins and assign their corresponding severity."

Again, he bowed his head and respectfully inquired: "Do all the dead pass through hell?"
The Most High answered: "Those who have accumulated good deeds and possess merit have their names already recorded in the registers of heaven, and their forms are transformed to receive blessed rebirth. How could they pass through hell again? Only those who have accumulated evil, after their lives end, must face retribution. Some enter the Fengdu or Mount Tai’s twenty-six hells; some enter the Nine Dark or Eighteen Hells; some enter the Eastern Wind and Thunder Hell; some enter the Southern Fire and Obstruction Hell; some enter the Western Metal Blade Hell; some enter the Northern Cold Ice Hell; some enter the Northeastern Whipping and Beating Hell; some enter the Southeastern Scorching Hell; some enter the Southwestern Hot Iron Bed Hell; some enter the Northwestern Cauldron Boiling Hell; some enter the Central Axe and Halberd Hell; some enter the Lower Dung and Filth Hell; some enter the Heaven-Watching Hell; some enter the Level Heaven Hell; some enter the Spontaneous Hell; some enter the Nine Level Hells; some enter the Azure Edict Hell; some enter the Dark Heaven Hell; some enter the Nine Orthodox Hells; some enter the Dark Sands Hell; some enter the August Heaven Hell; some enter the Prohibition and Punishment Hell; some enter the Northern Dark Hell; some enter the Statutes and Decrees Hell; some enter the Avīci Hell; some enter the Female Azure Hell; some enter the Heavenly Unity Hell; some enter the Supreme Dark and Mysterious Hell; some enter the Five Marchmounts’ Hells; some enter the Four Seas and Nine Rivers’ Prisons.

In such hells as these, the dark prisons are bitterly confining, the long nights are freezing, fierce flames and flying winds, swift thunder and startling quakes, sharp blades and sword-spears, iron rods and metal hammers, copper pillars and iron beds—embracing or lying upon them, poisonous birds and ferocious beasts with frost fangs and snow teeth, mutually inflicting torture. Even unto the myriad streams of the Ash River, the thousand-fathom poisonous waves, soaking within them, the pain is boundless. Fierce wardens drive them on, punishing divine soldiers, hundreds of millions in number, subjecting them to every kind of torture. In a single day, they die ten thousand deaths and are reborn ten thousand times. At such a time, how could regret avail? After enduring for a kalpa, their sins exhausted, they are reborn. Some become donkeys, oxen, mules, or horses, ridden by humans; some become feathered, scaled, or shelled creatures, slaughtered by humans. After enduring this retribution, they may regain human form, yet remain foolish, ugly, and incomplete in spirit. Dwelling only in lowly conditions, with limbs maimed, eyes blind, ears deaf, mute, or afflicted with madness, illness, hunger, cold, and starvation, lacking clothing and food, subjected to punishments and laws, they constantly dwell in suffering, barely distinct from beasts, never at peace. All this arises from past karma—how could they escape it? Without repentance, how could they be freed?

Therefore, with single-minded devotion, prostrate and earnest, they dedicate this to their masters, parents, ancestors, and kin, and further to so-and-so, extending to all sentient beings, repenting of hellish sins and paying homage to the Great Compassionate Supreme Worthy.

Take refuge in the Most Supreme Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, and all the Great Perfected Sages.
I, so-and-so, together with my masters, parents, clan relatives, and all sentient beings—from beginningless time until this day—have never awakened, and have accumulated transgressions through our actions. I fear that after the end of this life, we may enter these great hells, endure such retribution, and know no peace.

May all these transgressions be wholly dissolved from this single repentance, may we never pass through the realms of suffering, and may our good affinities grow. May the deceased be reborn, their dark prisons dismissed, and may they naturally attain bliss, forever departing from the evil destinies.

I bow my head to the Orthodox Three Treasures of the Ten Directions.

**Chapter on Vows**

The Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Practice, saying: "The wondrous principles I have just expounded—each concerning sin and merit—have their respective distinctions. Each practice of cultivation reveals its essential path; each Dharma-gate is universally opened."

Thus have I spoken for the sake of all beings—words direct and principles manifest, text flowing and meaning coherent—so that delusion may be dispelled, doubt shattered, and the mundane transcended to enter sagehood. All this lies solely in this path: single-minded sincerity to attain awakening.

Yet I ever contemplate how all beings fail to broadly generate great vows. With every thought, they should succor others; with each念, deliver people. Whether human or celestial, all should arise in equality. As for body, mind, speech, and intention—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and faculties—let them ever remain pure, steadfast, and unyielding. In movement, repose, waking, and rest, let them all be practiced. Diminish self for the benefit of others; place others before oneself. Accumulate merit in the body, ever engaging in purification and repentance. Once the roots of transgression are eradicated, the sprouts of goodness daily arise—how wondrous indeed!

I reverently bow to the Compassionate Honored One, then generate great vows.

Having completed these reverent bows to the Heavenly Worthies of Great Compassion in the Ten Directions—one thousand two hundred in all—and to the Perfected Ones of Great Compassion—one hundred twenty in all—I once more prostrate and take refuge.

Through this boundless merit and infinite true instruction, I, so-and-so, today generate the unsurpassed Dao-mind, dedicating it to my teacher, parents, clan, and kin, as well as to the three evil destinies, five sufferings, nine dark prisons, and six paths—even to the flying, crawling, wriggling, and all sentient beings. I generate this great vow:

May the Great Dao flourish and transform, the Dharma-teachings circulate widely, and all living beings hear and behold them, awaken to the Dao, attain perfection, and obtain manifold blessings.
May Heaven and Earth endure long, their shelter and support boundless; may the sun, moon, and stars illumine without end, their cycles harmonious and revolutions unceasing.

May all flying, crawling, and wriggling beings each generate spiritual nature.
May faithful men and women’s Dao-minds be steadfast, entering the Dharma-gate, women transforming into male forms, intelligent and self-mastered.
May those who dwell in mountains or hide in markets, who study the Dao and seek immortality, keep their true minds ever firm and swiftly enter the Great Vehicle.
May those afflicted with chronic illnesses and grievous ailments attain peace and tranquility; may the mute, deaf, and blind gain intelligence and clarity; may the crippled and lame stretch and rest at ease.
May all three karmic actions, life after life, awaken to realization, never generating evil roots, and avoid falling into realms of suffering.
May all entangled in enmity, hatred, and resentment be released; may the foolish attain wisdom, the miserly learn to give and benefit, the arrogant generate reverence, the generous remain unwavering in thought, and those who perform good deeds swiftly accomplish them.

Moreover, may all beings awaken to their emotions and intentions, emerging from the shadows of the aggregates.
Abandon base and malevolent emotions, and generate vast and magnanimous emotions.
Abandon sorrowful and afflicted emotions, and generate serene and untroubled emotions.
Abandon craving and desirous emotions, and generate pure and true emotions.
Abandon deceitful and perverse emotions, and generate upright and authentic emotions.

Moreover, may all beings awaken to their speech, emerging from insatiability.
Abandon the mouth of gluttony and taste, and obtain the mouth that constantly recites true scriptures.
Abandon the mouth that destroys goodness and promotes evil, and obtain the mouth that expounds true meaning.
Abandon the mouth of divisive speech and strife, and obtain the mouth of compassion and equanimity.
Abandon the mouth of curses and slander, and obtain the mouth of praise and hymns.

Moreover, may all beings abandon the eyes of desire and obtain the eyes of wisdom.
Abandon the eyes of anger and hatred, and generate the eyes of compassion.

Moreover, may all beings abandon the ears that hear evil and obtain the ears that draw near to goodness.

Abandon the impure ears, and obtain the ears that truly receive the Dharma.

Moreover, may all beings’ noses abandon杂息 and constantly receive the qi of celestial offerings, fragrant flowers, and wondrous blossoms.

Moreover, may all beings abandon all perverse, evil, and reckless thoughts—false and improper imaginings—and constantly attain refined, upright, and single-minded thoughts.

Moreover, may all beings be free from illness and affliction, free from the cycles of rebirth and transformation, free from hunger and thirst, free from calamity and misfortune, free from cold and heat, free from distress and suffering, and constantly abide in peace and bliss.

Moreover, may all entangled in grievance, debt of life, debt of wealth, debt of benevolence, and debt of righteousness forever sever their bonds and each attain liberation.

Moreover, may all shackles, fetters, and prisons, all dangers, hardships, and distress, be completely dissolved.

Moreover, may all evil persons arouse the mind of goodness, and may all three disasters be forever extinguished.

May the ten-directional hells transform into the ten utmost pure lands, and may all great hells become boundless jeweled realms.
May the tremors of hell transform into celestial music, and may the raging fires of hell become cool breezes.
May the icy cold of hell turn into the warmth of spring, and may the cauldrons of hell become lotus ponds.
May the boiling waters of hell transform into Dharma waters, and may the knife mountains of hell become lotus peaks.
May the spears and halberds of hell turn into banners and standards, and may the fire chariots of hell become jeweled carriages.
May the ash rivers of hell transform into jade pools, and may the suffering wheels of hell become Dharma wheels.
May the karmic winds of hell turn into pure breezes, and may the filth of hell become fragrant mountains.
May the hells of swallowing fire and eating coals transform into ambrosia entering the heart, and may the crushing rocks become cloud ladders leading to the Dao.
May all the suffering places of hell become realms of bliss.
Upon the river of desire, may rosy clouds form bridges; within the sea of suffering, may clouds serve as boats and oars.
May the records of hellish sins be entirely abolished, and may all suffering beings attain liberation at once.
May the hellish ghost officials ascend as immortals, and may the hellish ghosts and spirits ascend as celestial companions.

Moreover, may so-and-so, life after life, receive and relinquish the body.
May this vow be firmly established and unwavering.
Though heaven and earth may end, this vow shall have no end.
Though kalpas may be exhausted, this vow shall not be exhausted.
Though mountains and valleys may shift, this vow shall not shift.
Though rivers and streams may dry up, this vow shall not dry up.
May humans and gods together revere it, and may the living and the dead alike rely upon it.
Together may they assemble in truth and authenticity, and accomplish the supreme Dao.

At that time, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected One, having heard these causes and conditions, bowed in reverence and uttered this verse:

The Most Sagely One reveals the secret essence,
Delivering all humans and gods.
The great vow is inexhaustible through kalpas,
Its merit profound beyond profundity.
In life and death, all find joy,
And demon kings naturally preserve their integrity.
Neither this nor that—yet together
They accomplish the supreme immortals.

When the Most High Lord of the Dao had finished expounding the scripture, celestial music resounded, and the perfected sages, with their retinues, returned to the upper palace. The ten directions became serene and still. Thereupon, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected One, the Heavenly Thearchs, and all the perfected multitudes rejoiced, bowed in reverence, and vowed to uphold and propagate it for the salvation of all. Each inscribed it in dragon script and phoenix seal, encased in golden caskets and jade wrappings, and titled it: *The Most High Numinous Treasure Repentance Sutra of the Ten Directional Response and Appellation of the Heavenly Worthy*. They bowed in reverence to the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, True and Authentic.

Thus concludes the tenth fascicle of *The Most High Numinous Treasure Repentance Sutra of the Ten Directional Response and Appellation of the Heavenly Worthy*.
