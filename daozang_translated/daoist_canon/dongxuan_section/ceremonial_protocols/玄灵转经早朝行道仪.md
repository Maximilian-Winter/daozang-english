### *Ritual of Circulating the Mysterious Numinous Scripture at Dawn*
The ritual proceeds according to form.
All pay homage to the master, contemplating as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Divine Incantation:**
The supreme scenes of the Nine Heavens transform and give birth to radiant splendor.
Shimmering across the vast firmament, they illuminate the Purple Tenuity of true numina.
Ascending to the Central August, the hundred spirits descend in return.
Dispersing the roots of suffering, the eight adversities are dispelled.
The seven ancestors ascend together, their blessed fortune towering and majestic.
May we, the divine immortals, soar in the Eightfold Luminous Fast.

**Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.**

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi* of the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,
Summon forth from within this servant’s body:
The Three and Five Merit Officers,
The Attendants of the Left and Right,
The Dragon-Riders bearing incense of the Left and Right Courier Posts,
The Golden Lads attending incense,
The Jade Maidens transmitting words and scattering flowers,
The Incense Officials of the Five Thearchs on duty for the day—
Each in a company of thirty-six.
Let them emerge, clad in solemn attire and resplendent robes,
Their caps and sashes adorned with pendent tassels.

All divine numina.

We humbly beseech your vast compassion to deign to turn and peer with penetrating vision.

This servant has heard: when the Three Luminaries open their brightness, the Nine Stars bequeath their splendor.

The Earth Deities uphold the jade-disk throne, as the Dao’s unfolding destiny shines forth;
The Heavenly Masters attend the golden-gated august presence, as scriptures and texts radiate brilliance.
They serve as boats and bridges to ferry men and women, and govern tongues to command the divine numina.
Of all who dwell within the geomantic realm, none stand beyond the crucible of transformation.

We, your servants, have stored blessings through past karmic affinity, and our names are inscribed in the registers of the Perfected.
We have studied the *Hetu* and the *Huoluo* texts,
and bear the talismans of the Three-and-Five Jade Celestial Mechanism.
We strive in merit and conduct, humbly aiding the work of generation and completion.

Today, in reverent compliance with the sagely decree, we undertake the veneration of the Golden Register.
We, your servants, have diligently followed the scriptural instructions and established the numinous altar from of old.
Modeling earth upon heaven, we gaze toward the Purple Palace and bow our heads;
Prolonging life and augmenting destiny, we inscribe our hearts upon the cinnabar tablets.
May the grace of rain and dew be bestowed, that the sequence of yin and yang may be harmonized.

This morning, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, we, the assembled ritualists, now offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Most Perfect and Supreme Dao-Treasure:
The Great Primal Heavenly Worthy of the Great Luo of the Unsurpassed Dao,
The Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace,
The Two Emperors of the Jade Dipper,
The Nine August Star Lords,
and the Perfected and Sages of the Heavenly Palace of Pure Tenuity.

We, your servants, take refuge in body, spirit, and life, prostrating ourselves with heads to the earth,
and reverently depend upon the Three August Ones of the Most High and the sacred hosts of the Ten Directions.
May the merit of this incense be dedicated to the August Emperor, our Sovereign.
We humbly pray that heaven and earth display their splendor, and the Yellow and Luo Rivers radiate their auspicious signs.
Red geese and white unicorns, through a thousand ages, record the jade charts’ omens;
Golden branches and jade leaves, for ten thousand years, unfold the treasure calendar’s felicity.
May the sagely longevity equal that of heaven, and the imperial sun shine resplendently.

Thus we now burn incense, from our refuge in the Great Sacred Host of Master Teachers,
to the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones.
After attaining the Dao, may they preserve heaven’s enduring existence,
and harmonize with the Dao in perfect unity.

This morning, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, we, the assembled ritualists, now offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Most Perfect and Supreme Scripture-Treasure:
The Jade Tenuity Dao Lord of the Heavenly Palace,
The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,
The Great Emperor of the North Culmen of the Purple Tenuity’s Central Palace,
The Star Lord of Our Fundamental Destiny and Life-Span,
The Star Governor Illuminating the Throne,
and the Perfected and Sages of the Heavenly Palace of Yu-Yu.

We, your servants, take refuge in body, spirit, and life, prostrating ourselves with heads to the earth,
and reverently depend upon the Three August Ones of the Most High and the sacred hosts of the Ten Directions.
May the merit of this incense be respectfully dedicated to His Highness the Imperial Heir.
We humbly pray that the true wind may spread, and the sun of wisdom shine brightly.
May the Azure Han pour forth auspiciousness, and the realm of longevity open in the constellations of Winnowing Basket and Wings;
May the Purple Pivot extend its blessings, and clouds of fortune gather around the orchid and iris.
Thus we now burn incense, from our refuge in the Great Sacred Host of Master Teachers,
to the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones.
After attaining the Dao, may they preserve heaven’s enduring existence,
and harmonize with the Dao in perfect unity.

This morning, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, we, the assembled ritualists, now offer the third pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Most Perfect and Supreme Master-Treasure:
The Five Numinous Primal Elders,
The Heavenly Worthy of Virtue and Power,
The Old Man of the Southern Culmen, Star Lord of Longevity and Virtue,
The Star Lord of Blessing and Virtue of the Supreme Purity,
The Star Lord of Emolument and Virtue of the Supreme Purity,
and the Perfected and Sages of the Heavenly Palace of Great Redness.

We, your servants, take refuge in body, spirit, and life, prostrating ourselves with heads to the earth,
and reverently depend upon the Three August Ones of the Most High and the sacred hosts of the Ten Directions.
May the merit of this incense be dedicated to the return and flow of grace upon our Three Masters, Four Companions,
and fellow disciples of the same school.
We pray that our nature-sky may be serene and limpid, and our mind-ground empty and luminous.
May the golden blossoms of the fixed registers dispel the eighty-four thousand dusts of toil;
May the jade slips of inscribed names fulfill the one thousand two hundred precepts in perfect roundness.
Thus we now burn incense, from our refuge in the Great Sacred Host of Master Teachers,
to the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones.
After attaining the Dao, may they eternally preserve enduring existence,
and harmonize with the Dao in perfect unity.

The Seven Primes shelter and protect, Heavenly Worthies.

**Invocation of the Sutra**

We, your humble servants, have heard that the life-mandate sutra and its esoteric instructions form the supreme Dharma-bridge. It is the true essence of the Three Caverns, the right path for all living beings. Thus, those who open and recite it are reborn among humankind, endowed with exceptional intelligence and clarity; those who uphold and chant it make it their eternal treasure, gaining blessings and longevity worthy of praise.

We, unworthy and base, rejoice in encountering this transformative cultivation. Bearing the descending *qi* of the Seven Stars, moved by the concentrated essence bestowed by the Two Poles, we hold fast to the mandate of life to preserve our Heaven-appointed years—all of which depends on the sovereign powers. Yet in preparing this offering feast and tending the incense fire, we dare not indulge in careless folly. Reverently heeding the sacred edict, we honor and perform the Golden Register rites.

Thrice daily we practice the Dao, proclaiming its mysteries in accordance with the secret scriptures; nine times we recite the sutra, chanting and intoning its cavernous verses. The Mysterious Altar unfolds its affairs, the Purple Pole dispenses its grace. May we rely in secret upon the One Vehicle to augment and extend our myriad years.

We humbly pray that the numinous spirits shine resplendent, the Dipper and Pole Star radiate their brilliance. Overseeing this single offering of incense, may you bestow the ninefold radiance of your candlelight. May one man’s felicity bring eternal clarity to the Four Seas; may the protection of the ten thousand sages inspire reverence among the thousand perfected. May we reach the realm of flourishing life, entering and departing the land of blessings.

With bowed heads, we take refuge, each with utmost reverence.

**The Three Refuges**
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the sutras of the Ten Directions—may all beings awaken to understanding, receive, uphold, read, and recite them.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Dao of the Ten Directions—may all beings turn their minds toward it, offering sincere reverence.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the masters of the Ten Directions—may all beings ascend the Dharma-bridge without obstruction.

**Hymn of Past Lives**
Past lives are indeed real,
Yet the feeble dismiss them as nonexistent.
All crave what lies before their eyes,
Dismissing what passes beyond their gaze as false.
The great sages illuminate the Dao’s teachings,
Grieving for the stubborn and ignorant.
Tenderly they recall the suffering of their disciples,
Diligently they labor for our concerns.

We, your humble servants, respectfully follow the sutra’s words: the Northern Aster stands above, encircled by the host of stars, serving as the pivot of creation and the lord of human spirits. It possesses the power to dispel calamities and transcend adversity, the merit to prolong life and augment destiny. From emperors above to commoners below, though ranks differ, the mandate of life knows no distinction.

Today, reverently heeding the sacred edict, we honor and perform the Golden Register rites for longevity and felicity. We, your humble servants, lead the pure assembly of this altar in reciting *The Wondrous Numinous Northern Dipper Life-Mandate Longevity Sutra of the Most High* once each, offering prayers to the Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the First Grand Marshal of the Celestial Bureau—Lord Tianying Tanlang Yuchen of the Jade Dawn. We beseech you to erase the Nine Purples of the Southern Fire, the misfortunes of the Quail’s Fire domain, and all adversities.

We look up in hope of your compassion, praying for your gracious assent. Overwhelmed by the utmost urgency, we perform these sutra rites.

**Seating Hymn**
*Title of the Sutra*
*After the Recitation*
**Dismounting Hymn**

We, your humble servants, have just now led the pure assembly in ascending the altar to perform the Dao. We have offered prayers for the eternal peace of the Sacred One’s longevity and completed the recitation of *The Wondrous Numinous Northern Dipper Life-Mandate Longevity Sutra of the Most High* once each, now fully accomplished. Reverently we hope that felicity and longevity will sustain life, and that virtuous fruits will gather upon the self. Each person moves with sincerity, circling in hymns of praise.

*Step into the Void*, proceed to the southern quarter, offer incense, and circle back to position.
**Numinous Response of the Mysterious Spirit, Heavenly Worthy**

We, your humble servants, respectfully follow the sutra’s teaching: on the day of one’s life-mandate, to perform the fast and establish the jiao, to invoke the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, the Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus, and the Four Offices, to present blessings and dispel calamities, to submit memorials and entreat wishes—such merit and power are profound and cannot be fully expressed.

Today, reverently heeding the sacred edict, we honor and perform the Golden Register rites for longevity and felicity.

We beseech you to erase the Eight Whites of the Northeastern Gen position, the misfortunes of the Starry Chronicle’s Wood domain, and all adversities.

We humbly pray that the blessings of fortune and longevity be bestowed upon the life-mandate, and that the fruits of goodness gather upon each person. With utmost sincerity, we circumambulate in hymns of praise.

Proceeding in the *Step of Emptiness*, we are guided to the northeastern quarter, where incense is offered. We circumambulate and return to our positions.

**Great Compassionate Longevity Heavenly Worthy**

We, your humble servants, reverently follow the sutra’s teaching: when peril or adversity arises, how may one seek deliverance? One must urgently petition the Northern Dipper, offer rites of gratitude to the Perfected Lords, and recite the true sutra, acknowledging the Perfected Lord of one’s life-mandate, only then may one attain peace and prosperity, leading to health and honor.

Today, reverently heeding the sacred edict, we honor and perform the Golden Register rites for longevity and felicity.

We beseech you to erase the adversities of the Western Dui position, the Great Liang domain, and all misfortunes.

We look up in hope of your compassion, praying for your gracious assent. Overwhelmed by the utmost urgency, we perform these sutra rites.

**Three Hearings of the Sutra**
After hearing the sutra, may heaven endure and earth abide, seas be calm and rivers clear.
After hearing the sutra, may the Sacred Longevity be eternally at peace, and the imperial domain remain unshaken.
After hearing the sutra, may the golden branches flourish, and the precious lineage extend in boundless glory.

**Vows**
Concentrating the spirit, we burn incense. May the Incense Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of incense cause this place where we have this morning performed the sutra recitation and Dao rituals to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. May our sincere devotion move the divine, and may great blessings be silently bestowed. May the Sacred Longevity be eternally at peace, and the imperial domain endure forever.

May the immortal youths of the ten directions and jade maidens in attendance swiftly convey the sincerity of our supplications through the orchid-scented smoke, directly reaching the presence of the Utmost True, Boundless, and Great Dao—the Three Clarities, the Supreme Saints, the Purple Tenuity, the Northern Pole, the Great Emperor, and the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper.

**Exiting the Hall Hymn**
The rites for the recitation of the *Wondrous Numinous Sutra* and the morning performance of the Dao are now complete.
