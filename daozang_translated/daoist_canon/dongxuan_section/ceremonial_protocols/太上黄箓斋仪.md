**Fascicle One of The Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual**
Compiled by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting

**Ritual for Circumambulation at Dawn on the First Day**

According to the old ritual, the fast’s sponsor was required to submit a petition daily, following the method of announcing the fast. However, since a petition was already submitted at the fast’s initial establishment, daily repetition would be excessive in observance. Thus, it shall be done only once, and all subsequent petitions shall cease.

The assembled officials arrange their positions, banners, tablets, and incense altars, standing in solemn order before the Mystic Master. Once settled, the cantor intones:

*"All participants in the Daoist hall, each turn your minds to take refuge in the Three Treasures and all revered ones—"*

The *Huaxia Hymn* is chanted, leading to the *Huaxia Hymn at the Earth Gate*. The *Scripture of the Jade Casket Revealing Perfection* is recited. Now, only the eighteen empty sounds are used.

**Hymn for Opening the Hall**
With diligence we uphold the fast and precepts,
Reciting scriptures to restrain the six passions.
Thus we ride the void in flight,
Radiant, ascending to Jade Clarity.
With focused mind we honor the scriptural teachings,
Refining the five spirits through exhaled nectar.
Our merit crowns the heavens,
Turning the wheel to ascend as immortals.

The *Entering the Gate Spell* is recited, proceeding to the left of the Earth Gate. The Dharma Master recites the esoteric incantation:

*"Officers of the Four Luminaries, Messengers Who Convey to Perfection, Jade Lads Who Transmit Words, Jade Maidens Who Serve in Stillness—convey my words to the presiding deities of the Daoist chamber. May the qi of the Upper Prime enter my body."*

The *Huaxia Hymn* is chanted, leading into the altar. Ascending the Heavenly Gate, the procession begins with the incense offering to the ten directions, starting in the east. Upon reaching the imperial table, incense is offered thrice.

**Esoteric Incantation for Offering Incense**

Amidst jade radiance scattering light, each pays homage and visualizes as prescribed. The Dharma Master closes his eyes and envisions the Supreme Three Honored Ones descending through the void, flanked by dragon and tiger, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. The revered spirits of the Three Realms and the assembled perfected attendants array themselves at their seats. Thereupon, on behalf of the disciples, he presents the intent of the fast.

Next, he visualizes the Scripture Master attending to the right of the Supreme Ones, bowing thrice in his heart, wishing that the master attain the Dao of immortality and that his own body ascend and be delivered. Then he visualizes the Register Master, followed by the Ordination Master, with wishes as before.

For the night rite, he next envisions azure qi suffusing the fast hall, with green dragons and lions guarding front and rear. Immortal lads and jade maidens, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the five Thearchs’ troops and horses, nine hundred million riders, overseers of the fast’s affairs, and the officials of the Three Realms array themselves to left and right.

Then he envisions azure qi issuing from the master’s liver like clouds ascending. Within the azure qi are green dragons and lions. Heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, and the Five Thearchs of the five directions, with their troops and horses, envelop the bodies of the fast’s host and his household. Again, he visualizes the five viscera and the Five Marchmounts’ Five Thearchs, as in the initial night rite.

**Incantation for Guarding the Spirits**
*"Golden Perfected and verdant auroras
illumine and reflect the Three Heavens.
Flying clouds in the cinnabar firmament,
all heavens command their chariots.
Morning brilliance dawns,
dark shadows dissolve entirely.
Ninefold subtleties shake the void,
five stars revolve in cycles.
Myriad immortals respond to the resonance,
naturally wondrous and mysterious.
In the distant obscurity, radiance scatters,
shapes divide into billions.
Veiled in luminous splendor,
auspiciousness descends upon the altar’s heaven.
The living and the dead receive grace,
bathed and refined in the golden spring.
Demon kings tremble in fear,
converging their light upon the Three Fields."*

The Dharma drum is sounded twenty-four times.
The incense burner is opened.

**Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Origin, Three Qi of the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officials, Left and Right Attendant Envoys, Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-six each—to emerge. Now summon here the local earth deities and true officials of this domain to swiftly open the passes and present themselves. We now burn incense in proper ritual, dedicating this to so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for state and family, conducting the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat for so many days and nights. May the life-breath of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected descend and flow into our bodies, that our petitions swiftly ascend before the Jade Thearch of the Supreme Dao of the Utmost Limit, the Most High Lord of the Dao. Each person bows three times.**

All officials kneel. The Dharma Master sounds the Dharma drum twenty-four times. The officers and soldiers emerge to present the petition.

**We reverently summon forth from within our bodies the true officials and merit officials of our five viscera. From the Supreme Three Heavens, the Enforcers of the Dharma and Agents of Transformation, the Yin-Yang Merit Officials, the Salvific Dao Officers who dispel calamities, and the Lords who disperse misfortune and resolve adversity—twelve each—to emerge. From within our bodies, the governing officials: the Great General of such-and-such jurisdiction, builder of standards and overseer of merits; the Vanguard Merit Officers and Rear Guard Execution Officers; the Post Station Commandant and Post Station Deputy; the Fourfold Merit Overseers and Audience Attendants. From within our bodies, the Transcendent Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Officers, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—two each—to emerge. Let all who emerge don their solemn attire, adorned with caps and pendent tassels, arraying their majestic dignity.**

The Direct Merit Officials wear the Heaven-Piercing Crown and black silk unlined robes. The Orthodox Unity Merit Officials wear the Vermilion Yang Cap and crimson ceremonial robes. The Healing Merit Officials wear the Nine Virtues Crown, multicolored sashes, unlined robes, tiger-tally belts, and hold jade tablets.

The Direct Merit Officials stand at the four directions. The Orthodox Unity Merit Official stands at the center. The Healing Merit Officials guard and protect our bodies.

The Left Attendant Envoys bear standards at the fore. The Right Attendant Envoys hold banners at the rear. The Yang Spirit-Deciding Officers stand to the left; the Yin Spirit Officers stand to the right. The Upper Merit Officials stand above; the Middle Merit Officials stand within our bodies. The Qi-Urging Merit Officials hasten the Ten Directions. The Upper Envoys gaze afar toward the heavens. The Middle Envoys survey the eight directions. The Capital Envoys encircle our bodies.

The Tiger-Strong Attendants, the Sentry Officers, the Capital Commanders, the Heavenly Might Warriors, the Heavenly Couriers, the Armored Soldiers, the Qi-Gathering and Qi-Consuming Officers, the Spirit-Gathering and Spirit-Consuming Officers, the Ghost-Gathering and Ghost-Consuming Officers, the Malevolence-Gathering and Malevolence-Consuming Officers, the Essence-Gathering and Essence-Consuming Officers, the Toxin-Gathering and Toxin-Consuming Officers, the Talisman-Subduing and Shrine-Destroying Officers, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, the Memorial-Presenting Officers, the Flying Dragon Riders, and others—all assemble before, behind, to the left, and right of us.

The Merit Officials and Envoys, having completed their solemn preparations, array their processional regalia. They open the passes and present the petitions to the divine retinue of the Numinous Treasure, the Transcendent Overseers of the Retreat, the Officers of the Heavenly Master’s Twenty-Four Dioceses, the Thirty-Six Sacred Abodes, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Three Hundred Sixty Famous Mountains, Kunlun and the other celestial palaces, the thirty-six thousand deities, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Northern Asterism, the officials of the Three Realms of Heaven and Earth, their generals, officers, and soldiers.

The Dao’s Two Mysteries, Three Origins, Four Beginnings, the Four Directions, the winds and qi, the qi-infusing officers of the celestial stems and earthly branches, the Summoning Lords, the Nine Yi and Hu Elders of the East, the Eight Man and Yue Elders of the South, the Six Rong and Di Elders of the West, the Five Di and Qiang Elders of the North, the Three Qin and Cang Elders of the Center, the Lords of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the marsh and pond deities, the spirits of all temples, the masters of high mountains, forests, valleys, and groves, the Twelve Stream Matriarchs, the root-source and primordial earth deities, the lords of the altars and granaries—all at once don their solemn attire and, with the Merit Officials, Envoys, and Flying Dragon Riders from within our bodies, ascend to present their petitions before the Supreme Dao of the Utmost Limit, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Venerable One, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Utmost Limit Great Dao, the Hosts of Sagely Virtues, the Heavenly Worthies, the Perfected, the Supreme Thearchs, the Heavenly Thearchs, the Heavenly Master Lords, the Numinous Treasure Retreat-Overseeing Great Dharma Masters, and all the divine officials.

**We, born and raised in the floating world of dust, are mired in its clamor. The three karmic bonds entangle us; the six emotions drift like waves.**

By gracious encounter with the supreme transformation, we have met true masters. They opened the gates of the Three Clarities’ myriad wonders and expounded the principles of the Eight Radiant Immortals’ longevity. They clarified the sea of desires and dredged the river of love to its depths. We gird ourselves with the Dragon Script and hold fast to the divine registers, propagating the Dao and extolling the Dharma, aiding the state and delivering people. In saving beings and establishing merit, purification and abstinence are the foundation.

Now there is the official so-and-so, who, mindful of the state above and the unseen realms beside, seeks blessings and entreats grace, turning his heart toward the Ten Ultimates. He requests the performance of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite. We have heard that the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, the ranks of numinous immortals, the supreme wondrous Dharma, and the Yellow Register sacred altar communicate with the sagely and summon the perfected, modeling heaven and earth. They safeguard the state and family, so that lord and ministers receive the grace of protection; they deliver the living and the dead, so that all in life and death bear the power of preservation. When the Nine Dragons’ talismanic commands are opened, the hells become tranquil; when the Five Thearchs’ majestic spirits are summoned, the celestial charts shine bright and serene. Their merit surpasses all Dharmas, and their beneficence pervades all beings.

Thus, in accordance with the mysterious statutes, we present the ritual tokens: incense, flowers, oil, candles, brocade, and golden dragons, pledging faith to the ten directions and allying our hearts with the three realms. We, upholding the sagely teachings and humbly serving in the mysterious offices, are duty-bound to report all prayers and petitions. Today, we purify our minds and compose our thoughts, bathing in clarity and emptiness. We establish and perform the Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite, offering repentance and gratitude beneath the Three Luminaries for so many days and nights. We surrender our lives to the Utmost Perfected, to deliver so-and-so’s living and deceased kin, freeing them from suffering and ascending to bliss, reconciling grievances and dissolving karmic hindrances, dispelling calamities and dissolving disasters.

We reverently summon the celestial immortals’ armies of the Three Caverns, the flying immortals’ armies, the terrestrial immortals’ armies, the perfected ones’ armies, the divine beings’ armies, the sun, moon, and stellar constellations’ armies, the Nine Palaces and Five Thearchs’ armies, the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ armies—each numbering nine hundred million myriad riders. We summon the thirty-two overseers of the purification rite, the thirty-two golden lads attending incense, the thirty-two jade maidens scattering flowers, the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans, and the messengers who transmit words and memorials. We summon the thirty-two Flying Dragon Riders and the like. Together, they descend to oversee the purification site, secure the state’s fortune, protect all beings, and deliver the myriad generations of so-and-so’s ancestors. May the suffering souls of the unseen realms sever all evil karmic ties, enter the light, forever escape the three evil destinies, transcend the five sufferings, and surrender their lives to the boundless worlds of the ten directions, to the assemblies of great sages who have attained the Dao, and to the Utmost Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones. We beseech the dissolution of calamities and the removal of disasters, the prolongation of life and the preservation of destiny, passage through the three calamities and eight difficulties amid all evils, the protection of the state and the pacification of the family, and universal benefit to all sentient beings.

Once the Daoist rites are completed, those who have rendered meritorious service may report to the immortal palaces. The Merit Officials and Flying Dragon Riders shall separately memorialize and transmit these matters in due course. When the list of petitions is concluded, they shall return to our bodies and resume their places in the palaces. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before, in accordance with precedent.

We strike our teeth three times, swallow our saliva twice, and conclude the *Ritual of the Supreme Ultimate’s Purification Rite*.

Each proclaims his Dharma rank, and all the officials secretly recite their own Dharma ranks:

Disciple of the Three Luminaries of the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Capital and Great Cavern, Supreme Master of the Three Caverns, Master Practitioner of the Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite, Master of the Sacred Peak so-and-so, Perfected Lord of the Thearch so-and-so, your subject so-and-so, together in sincerity, reverently memorializes the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Utmost Limit Great Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch on High, the assemblies of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the Utmost Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the thirty-two Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Supreme Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity, Supreme Palace, Numinous Treasure, Utmost Perfected, Radiant August Dao Lord, the thirty-six divisions of venerable scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the officials and retinues of the three realms, and all true numina.

We, having accrued good causes over kalpas, were born into this great transformation. The mysterious and true awakened and delivered us, allowing us to dwell within the mysterious gate. Our three masters pledged and transmitted the Three Treasures’ true scriptures, with the Dharma duty to deliver ninety-nine thousand beings. Though we have ascended to the Utmost Perfected, our merit is slight and our virtue meager, and we have not yet attained immortality. Bearing transgressions and treading errors, we linger in the dusty world. Yet from the moment we received the Dharma, we pledged before the three realms to deliver beings and save creatures, making merit our priority. For all who take refuge, we are duty-bound to report.

Now, in obedience to the edict, how dare we not make this known above?

We read the words:

As the petition states, the devotion is truly sincere. The purification master, having inherited blessings from past lives and risen in human rank, serves the state and family, aspiring to exalted fortune. Reflecting on his myriad generations of ancestors and the divine spirits of ten lifetimes—who, in their time in the world, accumulated transgressions and faults, wandering the long night of rebirth without means of deliverance—he desires to repay their boundless grace, which is as vast as the heavens.

We have heard that the Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being nurtures all beings. The Supreme Dharma King and the great sages of the heavens extend their compassionate grace, inaugurating the statutes of the Yellow Register. Repenting before the ten heavens and baring our hearts to the eight directions, our red sincerity turns toward them, and ten thousand sins are absolved. Reverently following the mysterious statutes, we present the golden dragon brocade as the token of our destined life, along with incense, flowers, oil, and candles, to manifest our faith and sincerity. We beseech the deliverance of the living and the dead, praying for mysterious protection.

We purify our spirits and compose our thoughts, cleansing our minds and darkening our hearts. In accordance with the Yellow Register’s simple texts and the numinous immortals’ statutes, we deliver the living and the deceased, establishing the sacred altar. The four quarters and eight directions model heaven and earth. We establish the purification rite and perform the Dao, burning incense and lighting lamps. We reveal the luminous texts of the Jade Treasury, breaking the suffering of the dark night’s underworld gates. We remove the net of sins and rescue those lost in the ford.

Today, at this dawn of the purification rite, we first offer incense, making offerings to the Utmost Perfected and the supreme Dao Treasure. We surrender our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. We prostrate ourselves, surrendering our lives to the Three Honored Ones on High. By this merit, we dedicate blessings to the purification master so-and-so’s myriad generations of ancestors and all divine spirits, liberating them from the three evil destinies and transcending the six paths of rebirth.

We deliver the roots of suffering across the ten directions of the world, guiding beings out of the dark and desolate realms of fire and ash. Our shadows rest in the Jade City, our spirits roam the Purple Palaces. The Jeweled Grove spreads its canopy, and the fragrance of merit and cultivation pervades. May we swiftly enter the wellspring of wisdom and accomplish the immortal Dao.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master and the virtues of the Utmost Perfected. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into formlessness, merging with the Dao in truth.

Second pinch of incense: we offer it to the Utmost Perfected and the supreme Sutra Treasury. We surrender our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. We prostrate ourselves, surrendering our lives to the Three Honored Ones on High. By this merit, we dedicate blessings to the ancestral lineage of the purification master, the former sages, and the revered spirits of the altars and state. May the phoenix’s reign endure and the dragon’s chart remain eternal. May the emperor’s sacred person receive protection, and the dynastic fortune be prolonged. May transformation embrace Hua and Yi, and merit surpass that of the ancient sage-kings. May the empress’s earthly virtue shine with maternal grace. May the crown prince and princes inherit the celestial mandate, and the dukes, ministers, and officials, both within and beyond the court, adorn the imperial way and expand the great enterprise. May the myriad subjects each preserve their proper place, dwelling in filial piety at home and serving with loyalty to the state. May the nine regions share a common path, and the four seas unite in culture. May the fields yield timely harvests, and no demonic calamities arise. May all under heaven sing in harmony.

May the disciples of the Dao, dwelling in forests and marshes, proclaim the Dao and praise the Dharma with courage, diligence, and vigor. May they attain the One and the Primal Truth, penetrate the mysterious, and merge with the Dao.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master and the virtues of the Utmost Perfected. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into formlessness, merging with the Dao in truth.

Third pinch of incense: we offer it to the Utmost Perfected and the supreme Teacher Treasure. We surrender our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. We prostrate ourselves, surrendering our lives to the Three Honored Ones on High. By this merit, we dedicate blessings to the purification master’s own kin and relations. May each enjoy peace of spirit and ease of body, their sins extinguished and disasters dispelled. May no sorrows or afflictions assail them, and may their dreams and waking hours be true. May their mortal forms be transformed, their appearances perfected. May their shortened years be extended, and their lives endure. May they diminish selfishness and desire, aligning their conduct with nature. May the noble remain humble, and the wealthy know contentment. May the six relations and nine clans dwell together in harmony and goodness, their hearts united in righteousness, all sharing in blessed fortune.

May all beings—those that fly and swim, those with consciousness and perception—along with the nine dark realms, the five paths, the six destinies, and the three evil destinies, be freed from suffering and reborn in heaven. May enmities be resolved and grievances released. May they escape the three disasters, the ten thousand calamities, punishments, and misfortunes. May merit flourish and virtuous deeds shine forth.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master and the virtues of the Utmost Perfected. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into formlessness, merging with the Dao in truth.

The ritual of repentance follows the directions—twenty directions in sequence, or the fivefold general repentance, as detailed in the lower scroll. Each visualizes the nine-colored circular radiance, swallows saliva, and recites the secret demon-quelling incantation.

The Dharma Master stands at the Ghost Gate, the Precentor at the Heavenly Gate. The Dharma Master visualizes the sun and moon and the nine-colored circular light behind his neck, illuminating all within and without, as in the *Visualization of the Spirits* diagram. Upon completing the mudra, he strikes his teeth three times and recites the secret incantation:

*"The Yellow Center commands qi to sever demonic lineages,
Scrutinizing and subduing strong spirits, cutting off the old fiend.
The Supreme has decreed from the Supreme Chamber—
Hasten! Summon the Northern Emperor to the Jade Palace.
Receive the mighty command to proclaim to the Demon Kings,
The Five Emperors flourish with life’s vital force.
The secret jade texts are now fully revealed—
The Three Heavens revolve in brightness, the Six Heavens reach their end.
How wise! How wise!"*

This incantation must be recited in secret, inaudible even to oneself. To violate this is to incur fault. Be cautious! Be cautious!

Circling in the *Step of Emptiness*,
Treading the cloud-net in spiraling motion, riding the void to walk the dark warp.
Chanting and intoning the honored *Emperor Unity*,
A hundred passages naturally harmonize.
Bowing to command the lads of the Eight Seas,
Looking up to escort the lofty immortals.
The heavens scatter incense and blossoms,
A numinous wind arises, serene.
Long-held vows settle the root of destiny,
Thus attaining lofty eminence.
Rejoicing before the *Most High*,
Even ten thousand kalpas are but a beginning.

Again—
The towering *Dark Capital Mountain*,
Where the ten directions revere the *August Unity*.
The soaring *Celestial Treasure Terrace*,
Radiance and flame flowing like the sun.
Resplendent jade groves in brilliance,
Vermilion fruits gleaming in splendor.
Ever mindful to consume primordial essence,
Refining fluids to solidify form and substance.
Golden light scatters through the *Purple Tenuity*,
Profound and serene, the *Great Vehicle* in ease.

Again—
Looking up to visualize the *Most High*,
Flowering light flourishing in the cinnabar field.
Gazing left to lift the *Gloom-Dispeller*,
Gazing right to escort the *Essence-Binder*.
The *Six Perfections* observe the *Brahma-conduct*,
Virtue and power renew with the sun.
Long-accumulated merit responds to past causes,
Hearing the scriptures as if meeting kin.
Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent,
Delighting in reciting the subtle texts.
The *Primordial Harmony* of emptiness and peace,
Exhaling and inhaling the flowing rosy mist.
*Womb-breathing* stills the hundred passages,
In profound solitude, mastering the three expedients.
The *Mud-Pill Palace* becomes a luminous mirror,
Thus attaining the *Golden Flower Immortal*.
The *Demon Kings* respectfully receive the task,
Thus able to ascend and attend the heavens.
All begins with purification and abstinence,
Accumulating merit to bind past affinities.
Soaring flight through the Great Void,
Escorting the loftiest adepts.

*Three Invocations*—
Taking the Dharma as wife,
Cherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.
Holding precepts to restrain the six senses,
Mindful of the Dao to dispel desires.
In purity, the upright qi abides,
Serene, the spirit in silent stillness.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
Lifetimes enjoying great fortune.

*Three Bows*—
We, with devoted hearts, prostrate and bow to the *Most High Boundless Dao*.
We, with devoted hearts, prostrate and bow to the thirty-six revered scriptures.
We, with devoted hearts, prostrate and bow to the *Great Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery*.

*Reiterating the Dharma Rank*—
We, [your] humble servants, [names] in unison and sincerity, humbly address and invoke the *Most High Boundless Dao*, the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*; the *Most High Lord of the Dao*; the *Most High Lord Lao*; the *Boundless Dao* of the ten directions and the *Virtuous Host of Sages*; the *Celestial Worthies* and *Perfected*; the *Supreme Emperors* and *Celestial Emperors*; the thirty-six revered scriptures; the *Great Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery*; the *High Ministers* and *Prime Ministers*; the *Four Offices* and *Five Emperors*; the officials and retinues of the Three Realms; and all true numina.

We, molded by the Two Modes, planted causes over myriad kalpas.
Presumptuously receiving the transformative influence of the Dao, yet still unenlightened to the *Ultimate Perfection*.

Yet we, though devoted to revering the mysterious scriptures and venerating the hidden mysteries, have failed to extend our merit to the moving and the growing, while our transgressions have already amassed like hills and forests. Ever fearful that our allotted span may end, we shall face judgment in the dark night. Yet on this day of covenant, we hold salvation as foremost, proclaiming the Dao to deliver beings and assisting the state in its transformative work. We humbly offer our meager service, that it may accord with the boundless compassion of the Primordial.

Now the patron of this retreat, submitting to the *Perfected of the Highest*, devoutly reveres the *Great Dao*. Above, they pray for the enduring fortune of the state; below, they extend their care to both the living and the departed. They seek to repay the nurturing grace of sovereign and kin, and to contemplate the sufferings of those trapped in the cycles of the dark night. Bearing their vows and pledges, they have established this sacred precinct, to atone for past faults and to invoke blessings for the future. With earnest and sincere supplication, how dare we not make this known above?

Thus, we lead and exhort our fellow practitioners, adhering strictly to the ritual codes. We arrange the altar, array the scriptures, and model the sacred space upon heaven. Pouring forth our sincerity to the *Supreme Mystery*, we still our minds before the *Most Holy*. We prostrate ourselves, hoping that the *Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being*, the *Lofty and Boundless Honored One*, will look upon our earnest devotion with compassion and bestow the profound blessings of the *Mysterious*. May the *Four Offices and Five Emperors*, the *Mighty Spirits of the Three Realms*, descend with their transformative power, dispelling the mists and clouds to bring blessings; may they manifest their luminous might, attending our prayers and repentance in unison.

May the gates of the netherworld’s long night be opened, and the sufferings of the imprisoned souls in the dark prisons be released. May they depart the shadowy realms, ascend the celestial thoroughfares, awaken to the Dharma, hear the scriptures, and through contemplation of the *Mysterious*, realize the Dao.

May the patron’s household—nine generations of kin, both departed and living—see their three karmic offenses dissolved and their six sensory obstructions extinguished. May the celestial nets and earthly snares not bring calamity to their three destinies; may the dark stars and bright constellations forever still the misfortunes of the five phases. May the divine and true protect them, increasing their fortune and longevity.

Above, may the state’s prosperity know no bounds, and the imperial reign endure forever. May the sacred person of the sovereign enjoy boundless longevity, towering like the mountains; may their sagely grace flow abundantly, vast as the deep seas. May all regions submit in harmony, and the eight directions shine with clarity. May the three luminaries follow their courses in the primordial heavens, and the hundred grains flourish throughout the land. May borders know no war, and customs resound with songs of praise. May the world attain great peace, and all beings fulfill their natures. May this extend to all, whether hidden or manifest, sinking or submerged, that together they may ascend the steps of the true and reach the shore of blessings.

May the *Heavenly Worthy’s* choice to broadly deliver accord with our humble submission, and may our sincerity in devotion be met below. We respectfully make this known.

We now invoke:
First, the harmonious union of heaven and earth;
Second, the steadfast brightness of sun and moon;
Third, the orderly succession of yin and yang;
Fourth, the peace of the realm;
Fifth, the flourishing fortune of the emperor;
Sixth, the loyalty and integrity of ministers;
Seventh, the well-being of the myriad people;
Eighth, the abundance of the hundred grains;
Ninth, the liberation of the suffering in the dark paths;
Tenth, the flourishing of the Great Dao.

We replenish the incense burner.
O *Incense Official Messengers*, *Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger*, and all *Spirit Officials* attendant upon the incense, may this place where we perform the Dao naturally generate golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected gather here before the incense burner. O jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, attend the fragrant smoke and convey our supplications, transmitting them directly to the presence of the *Most True and Boundless Dao*, the *Jade Emperor* upon his throne.

We bow three times.
*Exiting the Hall Chant*

To repay the kindness and virtue of past lives,
the Dao-heart arises transcendent.
The body ascends to the Immortal Capital,
and the seven ancestors all attain liberation.

*Exiting the Chamber*
The Dharma Master recites the spell at the Earth Gate, strikes the teeth thrice, and intones:
"Emerging from yin into yang,
the myriad spirits open wide."
When the gates’ affairs are complete,
pray close the Imperial Chamber.
The Jade Maidens in attendance
illumine and prepare the divine palace.
Then exit the chamber,
the right armrest first.

*Turning to the Master*
*Supervising the Fast and Rectifying Errors*
When the court rites conclude,
all officials bow universally.

*The First Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites Concludes*
*The Second Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites*
*Compiled by Master Du Guangting of Tang’s Guangcheng*

**Midday Procession of the Dao**
*Entering the Chamber*
Each bows to the Master,
visualizing as prescribed.

*Guardian Spirits*
The hymn resounds through the empty void,
the Celestial Lord guards the altar.
The Five Emperors review the records,
receiving talismans from the Three Officials.
The four gates are secured,
binding demons and expelling treachery.
Flying bells and cast fire
purify and burn away defilement.
The body bears the Golden Script,
refining the elixir and the mushroom countenance.
Mysterious emptiness unites with purity,
the heart stirs the Three Passes.
Riding dragons and mounting cranes,
controlling horned serpents and riding simurghs.
The stars guard their stations,
a thousand demons dare not intrude.
The Dao-qi abides eternally,
the myriad immortals forever at peace.

*Sounding the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times*
O Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao:
Summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the thirty-six Fragrant Officials of the Five Emperors and the Direct Day—let them emerge.
Now summon the local Earth Gods and Territorial True Officials to swiftly open the gates.
We now burn incense and offer it on behalf of so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for state and family, having established the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast for so many days and nights.
May we receive the life-qi of the Supreme Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones, flowing down into our bodies, that our supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Most True and Boundless Dao, the Jade Emperor upon his throne.

*Each declares their Dharma rank:*
Disciples of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Purity, we, so-and-so, with one heart offer this to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Great Saintly Ancestor, the Highest Lord of the Golden Portal of the Mysterious Origin Heavenly Emperor, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder, the Most High Mysterious Elder, the Great Sage Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Lords and Elders, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Void Emperor, the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern True, the Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Portal, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity, Supreme Palace, Numinous Treasure, Supreme Clarity, Radiant Sovereign Dao Lord, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the officials of the Three Realms, and all true numina.

We have heard that the Perfect Dao is all-pervading,
the celestial perfected broadly save.
They bestow teachings beyond the subtle and profound,
fusing spirit before the workings of creation.

Encompassing the ten thousand existents to shape and mold,
guiding the Three Vehicles to initiate and instruct.
The sages bequeath their models,
the superior scholars diligently cultivate.
Assisting the state in transforming the people,
compassion is their foundation.
Your servant has relied upon the wondrous and subtle,
presumptuously bearing the true and orthodox.
Though faults accumulate like hills and mountains,
merits remain no more than dust or dew.
Truly, one ought to reflect and examine,
to discipline and cultivate oneself.
Yet at the outset of receiving the Dharma,
at the beginning of the covenant’s proclamation,
the Mysterious Regulations stipulate:
salvation of beings comes first.
All that is invoked and entreated
should properly be reported above.
Moreover, in following the imperial decree,
how dare I not make this known on high?

Reading the decree:
In accordance with the imperial command,
earnestly and reverently cultivating devotion.
For the state and for the family,
encompassing both the living and the deceased.
Respectfully following the ritual statutes,
devoutly establishing the altar.
Lighting lamps and burning incense,
reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-circumambulation.
Hoping that through sincere devotion,
we may attain resonance and communion.

Now, at the midpoint of the Dao-circumambulation,
as the first incense is offered,
we return body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.
Your servants prostrate ourselves,
returning life to the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High.
May these merits first benefit the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain.
May the august spirits repose in tranquility,
as jade-pure auspiciousness flows from the Jade Clarity.
May the precious mandate of the Two Modes endure,
and the myriad states flourish in eternal harmony.
May the emperor who pays homage to the ancestral court
succeed the sagely Yu and Tang,
following in the footsteps of Xuan and Huang.
May his longevity extend to the Northern Culmen,
his reign endure as long as the boundless heavens.
May the empress, imperial consorts, and princes
assist in perfecting his enlightened transformation.
May worthy ministers and sagacious aides
uphold and protect his grand designs.
May weapons be sheathed and sashes hang long,
as the Dao’s fortune flourishes and prospers.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master and Venerable Ones, whose virtue is most perfect. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into the formless, merging with the Dao in truth.

At this midpoint of the ritual procession, offering this second pinch of incense, we dedicate body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao. With heads bowed to the earth, we take refuge in the Most High Venerable Scriptures. May these merits flow to the ancestral spirits of the nine generations of the patron’s household, and to the sevenfold hidden consciousness of the departed. May they transcend the nether courts and wander the azure heavens; ascend beyond the cold halls and shed their forms in the cinnabar mounds.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master and Venerable Ones, whose virtue is most perfect. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into the formless, merging with the Dao in truth.

As the sun declines in the ritual procession, offering this third pinch of incense, we dedicate body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao. With heads bowed to the earth, we take refuge in the Three Masters Most High. May these merits extend to all beings, universally reaching those with consciousness. May all transcend dullness and ignorance, each attaining union with the true and correct. May the ninefold kin of the patron’s household renew their blessed fortune and bear the divine efficacy. May longevity and prosperity flourish within, while calamities and misfortunes cease without. May the three paths and nine nights, the six destinies and four modes of birth, together bathe in the mysterious grace and universally receive the true protection.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master and Venerable Ones, whose virtue is most perfect. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into the formless, merging with the Dao in truth.

We now perform the rites of the directions and make confession.

**Procession of the Void**

Treading the cloud-net in circling steps, we ride the void to walk the mystic record.
Chanting and intoning the honor of the One Emperor,
the hundred passages regulate themselves.
Below, we command the lads of the Eight Seas;
above, we escort the lofty immortals.
The heavens scatter fragrant blossoms,
and a numinous wind arises, serene.
The root of destiny is fixed by past vows,
thus we ascend to high emulation.
Rejoicing before the Most High,
even ten thousand kalpas are but the beginning.

**Threefold Invocation**
**Three Bows**

We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the Most High and Boundless Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Titles**

Disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, your servants [Names] once more proclaim and address:
the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Perfected and True;
the Most Exalted Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures, the Celestial Worthies;
the Perfected Thearchs and Heavenly Emperors;
the Jade Assistants, Supreme Ministers, and the Perfected of the Four Poles;
the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
and all the true numina within and beyond the Three Realms.

We, who have planted causes through kalpas uncounted and transmitted blessings through ages untold,
have by great fortune encountered the wondrous transformation and been privileged to enter the Dharma-gate.
We have perused the true scriptures and delved into the sacred intent.
We have learned that to invoke the Perfected and summon the Sages, one must establish merit—
assisting the state and aiding the times, as is fitting, by propagating the transformation.
We proclaim the essential Dao and extol the mystic ordinances,
observing purification to reach the true numina, and cultivating sincerity to pray for blessings and protection.

Now, the patron [Name], resolved in devotion and cultivation,
hopes to attract auspicious omens. We pour forth our earnest pleas before the Mystic Altar,
with minds stilled in the Purple Palace.
May the Heavenly Worthies, the Great Sages, and the host of Perfected Ones above
receive our reverence and bestow blessings in abundance.
May the imperial plan endure, the sagely reign extend far;
may cultural patterns unite and all vessels converge.
May the stars and constellations keep their measure, wind and rain come in season.
May weapons of war not rise, and blessings and felicity gather in full.
May the chief ministers and worthy aides, extending to the eight directions, enjoy long lives;
may the inner screens and outer bulwarks, together with the Nine Rivers, channel forth fortune.
May the radiance of the Shun-sun shine forth, clouds ascend the Yao-steps.
May rain and dew bathe the nine lands, and auspicious favor spread to the ten thousand states.
May the patron’s household, both seen and unseen, receive grace, the living and the dead all find peace.
May the jade calendar be opened to add years, the golden register continued to record good deeds.
May the six relations dwell in harmony, all excellences converge.
Extending below to the Three Paths, and encompassing all beings,
in the realm of the long night’s cold court, within the Fengdu hells,
may they behold the compassionate light of the Most High and bathe in the Dharma-power of the Heavenly Perfected.
May all together receive deliverance and emerge from darkness and sinking.
May the moving and crawling beings, the flying and hidden creatures of diverse natures,
have the Dao-wind spread afar and the beneficent rain universally moisten.
May all attain peace and tranquility, and ascend to the realm of longevity.
Above, may the Heavenly Worthies’ vast salvific work be made manifest;
below, may our servants’ devotion in taking refuge be answered.

The dharma drum sounds twenty-four times.

**Invocation of the Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, the Most High Lord Lao**

The Most High Lord Lao of the Three Qi of the Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens summons forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Incense Officials of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Days—thirty-six of each—commanding them to emerge. Let the local earth deities and domain spirits, the true officials and upright gods of this place, swiftly unseal the passes and present themselves.

We now burn incense in this very moment, offering it on behalf of such-and-such an official, such-and-such a person, for the state and for the family, as we undertake the Most High Yellow Register Grand Fast for so many days and nights. Today, on the first day, at twilight, we ascend the altar, burn incense, and perform the Dao-procession. May we receive the life-generating qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions’ Upright Perfected Ones, descending and flowing into our bodies, so that the sincerity of our petition may swiftly reach the presence of the August Heavenly Jade Emperor of the Boundless Dao of the Utmost True.

Each declares their dharma rank:

Disciples of the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital, we, your servants, with one heart offer this petition to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Commencement of the Void and Spontaneous, the Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor on High, the Great Sage Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the True Lords and Masters of the Myriad Realms, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Lords, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven-Treasured Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, the Perfected August Sovereign of Numinous Treasure, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, the True Lord of Life and Destiny, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Culmen, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lesser Teaching, the divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the named mountains and grotto-heavens, and all responsive and perceptive true numina of the Three Realms.

By fortunate karmic causes, we have personally encountered the transformation of the Dao. Through the guidance of master and disciple, we have gained entry into the dharma gate.

Clutching scriptures and talismans, we uphold and cultivate precepts and registers.
Yet unable to concentrate the spirit, we nurture our resolve in forests and valleys.
Mists and rosy clouds drift by, time lingers in stillness.
In the bustle of court and market, we secretly seek the sutras’ purport, taking salvation of beings as foremost.
For all who turn their hearts in devotion, it is fitting to report in memorial.
We, mere vessels of your edict, dare not but make this known above.

Reading the petition:
As the words declare, the sentiment and principle are sincere and earnest.
Turning hearts toward the Ten Poles, we bow our heads to the myriad heavens.
Hoping to establish an altar for purification, to exalt blessings and felicity.
We, your servants, humbly join hands and follow the prescribed rites and rituals.
We initiate the Daoist sanctuary, inviting the descent of perfected sages and sacred beings.
Devoted to the performance of the Yellow Register Wondrous Purification, each of us directs our cinnabar hearts upward, beseeching the mysterious protection of the Dao.

On this day, as the setting sun moves and the Dao is practiced, we now perform the first offering of incense, dedicating body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.
We prostrate our heads to the earth, surrendering our lives to the Three August Ones on High.
May these merits and virtues ascend to benefit the ancestral temples and forebears.
May the present emperor’s jade chart endure as long as the earth, his precious throne as long as the heavens.
May sun and moon shine with equal brightness, mountains and rivers enjoy equal longevity.
May the heir apparent, consorts, and empresses be sagely and divine;
may the myriad officials and ministers be both cultured and martial.
May weapons of war forever fall silent, and pernicious evils never arise.
May the Four Seas be at peace, and the ten thousand regions come to offer tribute.

Now we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masters, in their perfect and true virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, uniting with the Dao in truth.

As the sun sets and the Dao is practiced, we now perform the second offering of incense, dedicating body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao. We prostrate our heads to the earth, surrendering our lives to the Most August Sacred Scriptures. May these merits and virtues flow to the ancestral spirits of the ritual sponsor’s family—seven generations of hidden souls and nine lineages of lingering consciousness. May they ascend to the realm of the living spirits and refine their souls in the Southern Palace. May they bear the transformative power of yang’s radiance and attain the wondrous subtlety of yin’s lingering form. May the divine elixir bathe and cleanse them, and may the Dao’s qi nourish and suffuse them. May those now living receive blessings and protection, wandering carefree and at ease.

Now we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masters, in their perfect and true virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, uniting with the Dao in truth.

As the sun sets and the Dao is practiced, we now perform the third offering of incense, dedicating body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao. We prostrate our heads to the earth, surrendering our lives to the Three August Masters. May these merits and virtues flow to all sentient beings under heaven and all living creatures on earth. May all together be bathed in the fragrance of cultivation and each attain their rightful place. May the ritual sponsor’s own family and kin be untroubled by calamity or decline, their transgressions and faults dissolving of themselves. May their official emoluments and lifespan be prolonged, and may fortune and felicity gather abundantly.

Now we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masters, in their perfect and true virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, uniting with the Dao in truth.

We now perform the rites and offer repentance.

**Step-Void Hymn**
O towering and majestic, the Dark Capital Mountain,
The One revered by the ten directions.
Far-reaching, the Terrace of Heavenly Treasure,
Its radiance illumines the flowing sun.
Resplendent, the jade-forest blossoms,
Vivid and lustrous, the pearl-like fruits.
Ever do we ingest the primordial essence,
Refining the fluids to solidify form and substance.
Golden light scatters through the Purple Tenuity,
Profound and serene, the Great Vehicle soars free.

**Triple Invocation, Triple Prostration**
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
Paying homage to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
Paying homage to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
Paying homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery.

**Reaffirming Dharma Ranks**
We, disciples of the Dark Capital of Supreme Purity, your servants [Name],
Now reverently reaffirm our supplication to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning;

And to all true numina who respond to karmic conditions and heed our invocation.

We, your servants, have accumulated good karmic affinities over kalpas,
And now encounter this blessed assembly.
We have taken form in the Middle Land,
Receiving the endowment of Supreme Harmony.
The Three Caverns have proclaimed their teachings,
And the true scriptures have descended to transform.
We have studied the profound mysteries,
And received the sacred writs to cultivate—yet our practice remains imperfect.
Our meritorious deeds have not yet manifested,
Though we aspire to magnify the divine transformation,
To assist the state and establish merit,
To succor beings and deliver people.
Thus do we fulfill the profound intent.
The ritual sponsor [Name], turning his heart to the supreme Dao,
Bows his head before the numinous altar.
With sincere devotion,
He seeks to commune with the Three Realms.
Bearing the tokens of Dharma faith,
He reverently establishes this Daoist sanctuary.
We, your servants, now lead the Dharma assembly,
Mutually encouraging one another.
We purify our bodies and enter the sacred precinct,
Focusing our thoughts on the Dark Mystery.
Following the luminous regulations,
We recite the scriptures and perform the Dao.
With utmost reverence and sincerity,
We pray for responsive communion.

We humbly beseech the host of worthies of the Three Realms
To turn their light and shine upon us.
May the great sages of the ten directions
Together descend in their radiant chariots.
Deign to regard our sincere devotion,
And graciously bestow your blessed favor.
Command the Four Controllers and Five Emperors,
The Nine Bureaus and Three Officials,
The host of heavenly and earthly perfected,
To bear witness to these merits and virtues.

First, may the ancestral temples of the sagely dynasty
And the numinous spirits of the altars of soil and grain
Be preserved and protected,
Their great enterprise enduring, their reign prolonged.
May the myriad regions turn toward transformation,
The eight directions unite in harmony.
May wind and rain come in due season,
And weapons of war be stilled.

Next, for the ritual sponsor [Name]’s family,
May the nine generations and seven lineages
Ascend beyond the Crimson Mound.
May all inner and outer kin
Have their names inscribed on the cinnabar tablets.
May misfortunes and calamities disperse like mist,
And blessings and goodness gather like clouds.
May their lifespan and emoluments be renewed and increased,
While misfortune and decline cease entirely.
May their gates know no untimely death,
And their household enjoy auspicious omens.
May their descendants inherit the winds of loyalty and filial piety,
And all within and without enjoy the blessings of peace and prosperity.
May all categories of beings,
Even those in the Three Wretched Realms,
Together rely on this profound grace,
And ascend to the shore of felicity.

May we, your servants, perfect the Six Perfections,
And fulfill the practices of the Three Vehicles.
May we realize the Dao and ascend to perfection,
Broadly delivering all classes of beings.
May the heavenly bureaus and earthly offices,
The hidden functionaries and yin officials,
Together propagate the winds of purity and stillness,
And forever assist the teachings of non-action.
Above, may the vast blessings of the Heavenly Worthies be made manifest;
Below, may they correspond to our servants’ sincerity in taking refuge.
We reverently submit this petition for your hearing.

**Vows**
First vow: May the Great Dao flow freely, and all under heaven cherish virtue.

**Replenishing the Censer**
Fragrant Official Messengers,
The Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger,
And all the spirit officials attending the incense,
Now cause this place where we perform the Dao
To naturally produce golden fluid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.
May the hundred numinous perfected
Gather here before the incense burner.
May our entire household, living and deceased, receive blessings and grace.
May the jade lads and jade maidens of the ten directions
Attend the fragrant smoke,
And transmit our recent supplications
Directly to the perfected and boundless Great Dao,
Before the Jade Thearch’s august presence.

Second Day: Dawn Dao Procession**

**Entering the Chamber**
Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

The Five Stars cast their empty radiance,
Illuminating the divine courtyard with splendor.
Encompassing the formless,
They harmonize the qi of all spirits.
Concealed in profound stillness,
They traverse the Five Classics.
Displaying majesty, they outshine the sun,
Commanding the forces of jiǎ and dīng.
Dispelling demons and averting misfortune,
They purge filth and dissolve baleful vapors.
The myriad demons tremble in fear,
Dragons and tigers take flight in haste.
Purple clouds interweave and enfold,
The ten thousand qi converge as one.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
The Most High Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin, Three Qi Supreme Lord Lao,
Summon forth from within our bodies:
The Three and Five Merit Officers,
The Attendant Official Messengers of Left and Right,
The Incense-Bearing Golden Lads,
The Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens,
The Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—
Each in thirty-six ranks—emerge.
Now summon the local earth gods and territorial deities,
The true officials and orthodox spirits,
To swiftly depart and submit their reports.
We now burn incense and, on behalf of so-and-so,
For state and household,
Conduct this Supreme Alliance with the Perfected, the Great Yellow Register Retreat,
For such-and-such a number of days and nights.
As we ascend the altar to perform the Dao,
May we receive the life-qi of the Supreme Ten Directions’ Orthodox Perfected,
Flowing into our bodies,
So that our supplications may swiftly reach
The perfected and boundless Great Dao,
Before the Jade Thearch’s august presence.

**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**
We, the disciples of the Mysterious Capital, humbly and with one heart,
Supplicate the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Origin Heavenly Worthy,
The Boundless Great Dao, Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,
The Great Sage Ancestor, Supreme High Lord of the Golden Porte,
The Mysterious Origin Heavenly Thearch-Emperor,
The Supreme Lord Lao,
The August Jade Thearch,
The great holy multitudes of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,
The perfected lords and venerable masters,
The thirty-six Heavenly Lords,
The Jade Void Thearch,
The Jade Emperor and Supreme Emperor,
The Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numen, Northern Perfected,
The Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Porte,
The Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace,
The Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace,
The Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord,
The thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
The twenty-four Perfected of the *Great Peace’s* Lower Teaching,
The Eastern Marchmount’s Upper Minister, Controller of Destiny Perfected Lord,
The Western Culmen’s Sovereign of All Perfected, King Lord,
The perfected immortals of the named mountains and grotto-heavens,
And all responsive and efficacious numina of the Three Realms.
Through accumulated kalpas and cosmic cycles,
We have served as bridges across the ten thousand eons.
Having encountered the supremely perfected,
We have presumptuously heard the Great Dao.

Bearing the secret tablets of the Nine Heavens, we are ranked among the Upper Clarity’s ranks;
Holding the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, our names are inscribed in the Eastern Culmen.
Yet we have failed to purify our hearts to vacant whiteness, or conceal our traces in cliffs and peaks.
Conforming to the world, we blend our light, drifting between land and sea.
Above, we violate the true instructions; beside, we transgress the luminous statutes.
Still, on this day of receiving the Dharma, we make oath before the Three Realms:
Vowing to aid all beings and assist the state in establishing merit.
Whatever we declare, in principle should be reported.
Now, obeying the edict’s command, we dare present it for the throne’s hearing.

Reading the Petition
As the words declare, their meaning demands reverent observance.
Looking up, we consider the state, extending to sovereign and kin.
To requite boundless grace, we rely upon the profound teaching of the Mysterious.
Following the luminous Perfected’s ranks, we cultivate the Yellow Register’s canons.
We stabilize dragon-banners at the Mysterious Altar, scatter incense and blossoms in the Purple Palace.
We, your servants, adhere to the scriptures’ decrees, rectifying and solemnizing the Dharma’s flow.
Purifying thoughts and clarifying spirits, we perform the fast’s vigil.
This pure dawn, proceeding in the Dao’s rites, we move the first pinch of incense upward, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Most High Three Honored Ones.
May this merit ascend to benefit the ancestral temples’ successive sages, the altars’ august numina,
Attaining rank in the Nine Clarities and bestowing blessings upon the myriad states.
May the emperor’s light prolong the phoenix-era, firmly securing the dragon-chart.
Spreading the correct calendar through the Nine Enclosures, unifying chariots and scripts to the Eight Poles.
Outer vassals and inner screens, his virtue’s transformation shines resplendent.
The hundred offices and all officials, their illustrious splendor manifests.
The Three Luminaries shine serene, the Two Symbols harmonize in peace.
Valley-recluses and cliff-dwellers, teachers, revered parents—
May the Six Penetrations be early perfected, the myriad practices swiftly rounded.
Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the Perfected’s virtue,
Who, after attaining the Dao, ascend into formlessness, uniting with the Dao in truth.

This pure dawn, proceeding in the Dao’s rites, we move the second pinch of incense upward,
Surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.
We, your servants, bow our heads to the earth, surrendering our lives to the Most High Venerable Scriptures.
May this merit extend to bless our family’s ninefold ancestors and sevenfold lineage, their numinous forms through kalpas uncounted.
Releasing the black writ of sins, ascending as spirits to cinnabar and halcyon realms.
Guarded by the Three Immortals, transcending the dark courts of night;
Witnessed by the Five Emperors, directly entering the cool and clear realm.
Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the Perfected’s virtue,
Who, after attaining the Dao, ascend into formlessness, uniting with the Dao in truth.

This pure dawn, proceeding in the Dao’s rites, we move the third pinch of incense upward,
Surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.
We, your servants, bow our heads to the earth, surrendering our lives to the Most High Three Honored Ones.
May this merit flow to our family’s sixfold affines and ninefold kin.
May their fortune-tree flourish eternally, their virtue-star shine forever.
May the divine lords deign to look down, dissolving kalpas of karmic transgressions;
May the sagely power aid from all sides, untying boundless calamities.
May the numinous elixir secretly protect, the profound Dao silently accord.
Extending to all beings, reaching the six destinies—
May the dark springs depart from suffering, the long night open to light.
May the wriggling and flying, the sinking and soaring, universally partake in vast fortune.
Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the Perfected’s virtue,
Who, after attaining the Dao, ascend into formlessness, uniting with the Dao in truth.

**Pacing the Void**

Bowing low and raising high, we hold the Most High in mind,
Radiant splendor blooms within the cinnabar field.
To the left, we lift the dark and guarded,
To the right, we grasp the bound and luminous.
The Six Perfections crown the Brahman conduct,
Virtue and the Dao follow where the sun abides.
Accumulated blessings from past lives respond,
Hearing the scriptures as if meeting kin most dear.
Heaven-endowed with talent surpassing the world,
Joyfully reciting the subtle and profound chapters.
In emptiness and great harmony, qi flows,
Exhaling and inhaling the essence of streaming clouds.
Fetal breathing stills the hundred passages,
In solitude, we fathom the Three Chapters.
Mud and the Nine Caverns reveal bright visions,
Thus attaining the Golden Flower Immortal.
The Demon Kings respectfully receive their charge,
And so ascend to the heavens above.
All begins with fasting and precepts,
Piling merit to bind past-life affinities.
Soaring through the Great Void,
Lifting and guiding the loftiest ones.

**Threefold Invocation**
**Threefold Prostration**
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Reverently Reciting the Dharma Titles**
Disciples of the Mysterious Capital of the Upper Clarity, we, your humble servants, reverently and earnestly proclaim before the Most High, Boundless Great Dao—the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, and all true numina of the ten directions, three realms, famous mountains, and grotto-heavens.

We have heard that the Great Dao precedes heaven,
Utterly real, vast and distant.
It is the origin of creation, the potter of yin and yang.
When it condenses spirit, it is profound stillness and emptiness;
When it applies its function, it encompasses the vast and great.
The Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus and Four Offices,
Uphold the mysterious transformation to give life and completion,
Receiving the divine statutes to examine and tally.
Fortune and misfortune, sin and blessing—
Not even the tiniest is overlooked.

The patron of this retreat, so-and-so,
From the first condensation of qi in the primordial heavens,
Has accumulated karmic causes through kalpas immeasurable.
Bearing the movement of nature’s course,
Receiving the workings of creation’s power,
We reflect with reverence upon the nine generations and seven lineages,
The myriad ancestors and ten thousand progenitors.
Their forms have long been molded,
Their accumulated transgressions run deep.
Extending to this very body, kin, and affines,
From time without beginning to this very day,
The transgressions and faults bound are
Boundless and immeasurable.
The living and the dead bear their offenses,
In life and death, they err and stray.
The bitter roots of past-life adversaries
Have yet to be dissolved and swept away.

Now, in accordance with the *Scripture on Karmic Retribution and Liberation Spoken by the Flying Heavenly Divine Persons* and the *Text on Salvation and Deliverance*,
We prepare golden dragon-patterned silks, incense, flowers, and ritual offerings,
Purify our minds and refine our conduct,
Establishing this sacred precinct.
We repent before the Mysterious Perfected,
Redeeming and ransoming our sins and faults.

We humbly pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in compassion, will protect and aid,
That the Great Sages will deign to shine their light.
Commanding the Earthly Offices,
They will open the path to deliver the souls and spirits,
Leading them out from the abode of the long night,
Freeing them from the midst of the Nine Dark Springs.
Adorned in the celestial regalia,
Their names erased from the ghostly registers,
They will ascend beyond the nether realms,
Bathe in the numinous streams,
And attain the carefree realms of the heavenly halls.
Their baleful destinies severed,
Fortune and benefit will manifest.
The patron’s family, both inner and outer kin,
Will together partake in this radiant protection.
Disasters and misfortunes will cease,
Auspicious omens will ever arrive.
The Great Dao will descend with its numinous power,
The heavens will bestow their aid.
No demonic forces will arise,
No evils will assail.
The nation’s destiny will extend and flourish,
The imperial enterprise will broaden and expand.
The sagely body will receive blessings,
The four seas will rest in peace.
The celestial vault will shine clear,
The divine winds will be still and silent.
Weapons will be laid down,
All people will delight in well-being.
The harvests will be bountiful,
The realm will know no strife.
The flying and sinking will follow their nature,
The dark night will be illuminated.
Extending to the ten directions,
Pervading the three realms,
All under heaven will be wholly saved,
All will receive grace.

May the blessings of the Heavenly Worthy and Great Sages above be made manifest,
And may the sincerity of our refuge below be answered.
We reverently proclaim this to be heard.

**Returning to the Brazier**

May the Fragrant Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all the attendant Fragrant Spirits ensure that wherever I practice the Dao, golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs naturally arise. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here, before the incense burner and the fragrant flame. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, transmitting and presenting my supplications, swiftly reaching the presence of the Most High, the Limitless, the Great Dao, the Three Clarities, the Supreme Saints, and the Jade Emperor.

**Second Day: Midday Procession of the Dao**
*Entering the Chamber*
Each pays homage to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

The Yellow Center guards with qi, severing the roots of demonic clans.
Suppressing the sources of evil,
Cutting off the traces of demons.
By the talismanic command of the Most High,
Divine power is summoned and controlled.
The myriad spirits are thus subdued,
Repelling misfortune and eliminating calamity.
The three wheels of royal qi,
Circulate the true wind.
The purple portal cradles jade,
Bestowing boundless deliverance.
To the left, the Azure Waist is commanded;
To the right, the Mushroom Youth is summoned.
Riding the whirlwind and soaring light,
Mastering the nine voids.
The Mysterious Altar responds to the moment,
Mounting the qi in emptiness.
The ten thousand perfected descend in unison,
Delivering boundless salvation.

*Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times*

O Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin of the Three Qi, Most High Lord Lao: summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Left and Right Fragrant Bearers, the Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Youths attending incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, the Direct-Day Fragrant Officials—thirty-six each. Summon forth the local earth gods and territorial deities, the true officials and orthodox spirits, to swiftly emerge, prepare their attire, and open the gates. As we now burn incense, we dedicate it to so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for the state and for the family, in the performance of the Most High Yellow Register Great Retreat for so many days and nights. Today, on the second day at midday, we ascend the altar, pay homage to the perfected, and practice the Dao. May we receive the life-generating qi of the Most High and the ten directions’ true perfected ones, flowing into our bodies, so that our supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, the Limitless, the Great Dao, the Jade Emperor.

Each declares their dharma rank:

We, disciples of the Mysterious Capital, humbly and with one heart, reverently supplicate the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Non-Being and Spontaneous Origin, the Limitless Great Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the ten directions’ great saintly perfected ones who have attained the Dao, the myriad true lords and venerable masters, the thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Culmination, the Eastern Minister of Destiny, the Supreme Primordial Perfected One, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace Lower Teaching, the numinous palaces of the Five Marchmounts, the perfected immortals of the renowned mountains and grotto-heavens, the responsive and perceptive spirits of the Three Realms, and all true numina.

We, by fortunate coincidence, meet this blessed occasion, our good karma accumulated from past encounters. The Three Honored Ones spread the transformation of non-action; the Four Luminaries open the gate of broad salvation. Thus, with mortal forms, we rely on the wondrous dharma of our lineage. We unfold the precious writs of the ninefold radiance, gaze upon the jade chapters of the Three Caverns. Though inwardly we measure our meager capacities, surely we are unworthy. Only through the fast and precepts do we hope to establish modest merit, aiding the state and delivering people, fulfilling the mysterious intent. In all our endeavors, how dare we not report them above?

*Reading the Petition*
Following the words of the petition, we sincerely submit to the Mysterious Culmination. For the state and for the family, we request blessings and pray for grace.

Disciple so-and-so reflects: my nature is endowed with the three numina, my spirit molded by the four greats. In the River of Love, my nature is drowned; in the Sea of Desire, my sincerity races. Illusory realms are easily confused; the mountain of blessings is hard to construct. Faults and transgressions accumulate, deepening with the years. I have heard that the wondrous retreat of the Yellow Register is a secret rite of the Mysterious Capital. Above, it delivers billions of ancestors, severing the roots of evil karma and sinful retribution; below, it rescues the nine nights and three paths, the destitute souls and hidden spirits. It dissolves calamitous knots, opens deliverance for heaven and humanity. Wherever its blessings extend, families and states enjoy eternal peace. Thus, with solemn reverence and earnest sincerity, I prepare fragrant flowers, offerings, patterned silks, golden dragons, lamps, and candles, establishing the retreat and practicing the Dao, praying for the descent of the perfected. Universally for the living and the dead, I turn my heart and plead for destiny.

Today, at midday, practicing the Dao, we, the assembled dharma practitioners, offer this first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering to the Most High and True Dao Treasure. We dedicate our bodies, lives, and destinies, prostrating ourselves, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High. May this merit, above, benefit the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral temples. May they merge with the three realms, ascend the nine heavens, secretly assist the great foundation, and safeguard the great enterprise. May the emperor’s longevity equal the sun and moon, his transformation harmonize the three origins. May his chariots and standards reach the eight extremities, his dominion embrace the ten thousand states. May the heir apparent, the regional lords, and the imperial aides assist the imperial plan. May the worthy ministers and meritorious officials protect and govern the royal house. May auspicious clouds spread their radiance, and the dharma rain nourish all. May the four companions and three masters, the mountain-dwelling fellow practitioners, together attain the fruit of perfection, all ascend the immortal ranks.

Thus, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great saintly host of the perfected and true. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, in harmony and union with the Dao in truth.

Today, at midday, practicing the Dao, we offer this second pinch of incense. We dedicate our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao, prostrating ourselves, taking refuge in the Most High Revered Scriptures. May this merit bless the nine generations of ancestors in the hidden chambers and the seven lineages of spiritual consciousness. May the vast radiance shine downward, leading them from the dark springs’ gates; may the mysterious grace spread widely, releasing them from the net of scorching toil. May the Three Officials erase their records, and the Five Paths generate their spirits. May they hear the true dharma in the Purple Tenuity, pay homage to the perfected in the Azure Vault. May they wear the talismans of the numinous writs, transcend the cold courts of the night prisons. May the six destinies and three paths together reach the realm of blessings.

Thus, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great saintly host of the perfected and true. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless.

With the Dao uniting in perfected truth,
we now perform the midway rite of pacing the Dao.
Burning this third pinch of incense,
we offer body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao,
prostrating ourselves in reverence to the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High.

May this merit flow to the nine affinities and six clans of such-and-such a household,
to all inner and outer kin.
May their forms harmonize with primordial harmony,
their spirits merge with the wondrous Dao.
Gold steadfast and jade lustrous,
may their blessings increase and their radiance grow;
mirrors bright and dust cleared,
may their lifespans extend and stretch afar.
Disasters disperse like vanishing mist,
goodness arrives like gathering clouds.
From the moving and still to the flying and sinking,
within the realm and beyond its bounds,
may all alike receive vast fortune,
all bathe in the mysterious workings.

Thus we now burn incense,
taking refuge in the great saintly host of the perfected and true.
After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless,
with the Dao uniting in perfected truth.

The rites proceed:
Repentance,
Pacing the Void,
Reining the reins to traverse the ten directions,
resting in turn upon the slopes of the darkly luminous.
Gazing upward at the Terrace of Kalpas,
looking downward at the Purple Cloud Net.
Wandering freely in the Capital of the Most High,
together we sit upon lotus blossoms.
Through accumulated study, one becomes a perfected person,
serene in harmony of nourishing qi.
Forever enjoying boundless life,
why count even ten thousand cedars as many?

Threefold invocation,
Threefold prostration.

We, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

Once more proclaiming our rank:
Disciples of the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital, we humbly and with one heart address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin; the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Boundless Great Dao and the Host of Virtuous Saints and Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions; the Heavenly Emperors and Celestial Thearchs; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers, the Four Offices and Five Emperors; the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace Lower Teaching; the King of Total Perfection of the Western Ultimate; the Divine Officials of the Five Marchmounts, the Grotto-Heavens of the Famous Mountains, and all responsive and perceptive perfected numina of the Three Realms.

We prostrate ourselves, having heard that the Primordial August One established the teaching, and the Supreme Dao transmitted its texts. The Azure Scriptures spread afar, rescuing the four deluded from the six destinies; the Vermilion Writings broadly expounded, bestowing abundant blessings upon the Nine Dark Realms. The living and the dead alike receive grace, the benighted and the enlightened together know peace.

We, above, consider the nine mystic generations and seven ancestral lines, the karmic bonds of kalpas past, extending to lord and kin, and reaching to family and state. Reflecting upon the radiant favor, we grandly open the vast interior. We take refuge at the Mysterious Altar, offering sincerity to the Purple Palace. We request to perform the fast and vigil, to convey our earnest prayers.

Following the ranked texts and observing the precepts and forms, we array the positions of the stars, emulating the round vault above; we open the altar’s gates of sun and moon, aligning with the true pattern at the sides. Incense, flowers, lamps, and candles attest to our faith and convey our sincerity. Dragon jades and patterned silks express the heart and display our rites. With concentrated thought and focused visualization, we hope to attain resonance and communion.

We pray that the Supreme Dharma King will shine forth his compassionate light to illumine below; that the Great Sage of the Mysterious Capital will extend his beneficent influence to descend afar. May he command the flying heavenly spirit-kings to proclaim the covenant to the Three Realms; may he open the palaces of the Cold Court to release the hidden souls. May the numinous essences of generations past all receive deliverance and elevation. Bathed in the divine fluid, may they ascend beyond the Southern Palace. Hearing the Dharma-sound, may they transform and be born in the immortal realms.

Above, we pray for the eternal life of the sagely lord, for the imperial enterprise to know no bounds. May the waves of the Eight Seas all become imperial grace; may the mountains and rivers of the Nine Enclosures all become royal domains. May the tracks of chariots be wholly unified, the celestial motions all harmonious. May the Eight Winds blow gently, the Five Grains ripen abundantly. May weapons of war not be raised, beacon fires forever stilled. May the people know no disease, and customs abound in auspicious signs. May our family, kin, and clan all partake of vast fortune. May the Three Paths and Nine Nights, the moving and the still, the floating and the hidden, all receive the compassion of the wondrous Dao, and together attain the fruits of spontaneity.

Above, may the Heavenly Worthies manifest their great compassion; below, may our sincere prayers be answered. We humbly present this petition for your hearing.

We make our vows:

First vow: May the Great Dao be serene and empty, tranquil and still, abiding in clarity. May it broadly open the Dharma-gates to instruct the stubborn. May all receive its beneficent influence and cultivate with diligent austerity. May we, with our fellow students, universally ascend to the void, preserving ourselves with Heaven, and abiding forever without care.

Second vow: May the various heavens congeal qi and become clear. May the high void broadly cover, preserving the true and securing the numinous.

When hidden, they are without action; when dispersed, they fill the heavens. May immortals and transcendents dwell together, forming friendships with the host of perfected. May beneficence flow to all, loving the state and cherishing the people. May all beings be universally saved, humanity enduring kalpas together.

Tenth vow: May the rivers and seas be vast and boundless. May they contain and embrace, expansive and broad, nurturing even the smallest. May their depths be profound and their kindness gentle, moistening all that wriggles and breathes. May Heaven and humanity protect and bless, their years enduring like kalpic stone.

Eleventh vow: May the emperor’s state daily flourish. May the Four Quarters be peaceful and harmonious, weapons of war not raised. May Heaven and humanity sing in praise, auspicious responses arriving in flight. May teachings be widely disseminated, majestic transformations overflowing. May the myriad people rejoice, eternal joy without end.

Twelfth vow: May the crawling and flying, the moving and stirring, those already born and those yet to be born, all receive safety and universally attain life. May all see the primordial qi and receive the forms of yang. May grasses and trees, fruits and forests endure winter without withering. May all be delivered and saved, none not flourishing and radiant.

Harmonizing with the Dao, uniting in perfected truth.

The incense is offered again.

Fragrant Official Messengers, the Lords of Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all Attendant Fragrance Spirits: may this place where your servant ascends the altar to perform the Dao naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here, where incense and flame illuminate the altar’s censer.

May the disciple of the fast, so-and-so, whether living or deceased, receive blessings; may the hidden and manifest be graced with favor. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, conveying all that your servant has just petitioned directly to the August Jade Emperor of the Utmost Real and Boundless Dao.

The Twenty-Four Rolls of the Dharma Drum Resound

From the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin of the Three Qi, the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attending Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Scribes, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Six Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense—each in their thirty-sixfold ranks. Summon now the local earth deities and domain guardians, the true officials and correct spirits, to swiftly emerge and open the passes.

We now burn incense in proper ritual, dedicating this to so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for state and family, as we undertake the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast for so many days and nights. On this second day, at twilight, we ascend the altar, burn incense, and perform the Dao-procession. May the life-generating qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions and Correct Perfected Ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Jade Thearch, the August Emperor of the Supreme Dao of the Utmost Real and Infinite.

Each proclaims their dharma-rank:

Disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, we, so-and-so, humbly and with one mind, reverently address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Infinite Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Great Sagely Ancestor, the Highest Great Dao, the Golden Watchtower, the Mysterious Origin, the Heavenly Thearch of the August Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Great Sages of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, the Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous, the Northern Perfected, the Mystic Capital, the Golden Watchtower, the Seven-Treasure Mystic Terrace, the Purple Tenuity, the Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure, the Perfected and Radiant August Dao Lord, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center, the Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, the Director of Destinies Perfected Lord, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Culmen, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching, the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Departments, the True Officials of the Five Marchmounts, the Grottoes and Caverns of the Numinous Mountains, the responsive and perceptive deities of the Three Realms, and all the mysterious bureaus.

We have long been endowed with the true vehicle and born in an age of Dao-transformations. The Vermilion Writs govern fate; the Mysterious Teaching spreads widely. We have presumptuously received the grace of masters and transmitted the secret registers. Yet we have not been able to lodge our spirits in the famous peaks, fix our thoughts on the Central Void, or befriend the Supreme Perfected. Thus, while we vow to deliver the departed according to the mysterious statutes, our first duty is to aid the state, expound the Dharma to save people, and establish merit as our foundation. In all our petitions, how dare we not make this known above?

Recitation of the Words

Following the recited words, we truly and earnestly pray. May this benefit the state and family, universally extending to the living and the dead. We reverently invoke the imperial altar, looking up to implore the mysterious blessings.

We, in accordance with the Purple Yang Jade Writs and the Yellow Register’s precious texts, the karmic conditions of sin and fortune, and the deliverance statutes, present silk as ritual sincerity, dragon jades, incense, and flowers, offering our sincere hearts as we perform the fast and vigil. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the Great Sages of the Ten Directions and the Most High’s host of venerables will condescend to descend their majestic radiance and graciously turn their wise gaze. May they broadly bestow blessings and favor, fulfilling our heartfelt sincerity.

On this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits be dedicated to the ancestral temples and the august spirits of the altars of soil and grain, ascending to the Great Clarity, roaming the Purple Watchtower. May the emperor’s august brilliance, together with the encompassing of heaven and earth, equally honor transformations, pervade the boundless, and extend benevolence to all without exception. May the empress, inner officials, and the six palaces be suffused with goodness. May the crown prince and the various princes have blessings extending for ten thousand generations. May the myriad officials, ministers, the Four Companions, and the Three Masters all enter non-action and fully attain the fruits of the Real.

Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely host of masters and the virtues of the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

On this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.

We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Most High’s Venerable Scriptures. May these merits bring blessings to such-and-such a family, the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, the departed spirits. May the transgressions of kalpas be washed away, receiving the registers of the Three Caverns; may the karmic retributions of accumulated lives be dissolved, escaping the ninefold darknesses of suffering. May their essences be refined in the Southern Palace, their spirits ascend to the upper realms.

Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely host of masters and the virtues of the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

On this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.

We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits bring blessings to such-and-such a family, the six relations and five clans, the inner and outer kin. May good fortune be ever renewed, and calamities and misfortunes naturally cease. May the Valley Spirit embrace the wondrous, and the Supreme Dao bestow its grace. In all actions and thoughts, may they all receive primordial auspiciousness. Then may the three paths and six destinies, all sentient beings, have the waves of the sea of suffering stilled and the flames of the furnace of craving quelled. May the true wind spread widely, and the rain of kindness universally moisten. May all fully realize the stages of the Dao and attain the fruits of the Real.

Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely host of masters and the virtues of the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

Salutation to the Directions

Repentance

**Pacing the Void**

The Great Dao’s Master is profound and quiescent,
Ascended immortals and friends, Wu Ying.
The Noble Scion transmits the numinous talisman,
The Great One bears the Cavern Scripture.
The śarīra radiates golden splendor,
The dragon chariot swiftly arrives to welcome.
The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon the cloud-borne carriage,
Soaring lightly through the void.
Incense and flowers drift like flying snow,
Mystic vapors flourish upon the dark beams.

**Three Invocations, Three Bows**

We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,

The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
The Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
The High Ministers and Prime Ministers;
The Four Officiants and Five Emperors;
The Perfected Immortals who attained the Dao in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens;
All responsive and perceptive spirits of the Three Realms.

We, your servants, have heard that the Compassionate Worthy of the Golden Portal and the August Sage of the Jade Capital,
First spread transformation amidst primordial chaos,
And after countless kalpas, welcomed the true.
Opening the ninety thousand Dharma gates, a ladder for all beings;
Revealing the profound purport of the Three Vehicles, drawing forth the benighted and lost.

We, your servants, contemplate the true essence and open our hearts to the sacred canon,
Aspiring to propagate the sagely intent to bless all sentient beings.
Your disciples [names] reflect with reverence upon the nine generations of ancestral spirits in darkness,
And the six relations bound in deluded consciousness.
From past kalpas to this present life,
We have indulged the six emotions and pursued the three karmic actions,
Violating the wondrous teachings of the Five Constants,
Accumulating deep transgressions in the Four Great Elements.
Our sins inscribed in the Black Book,
Our spirits confined in the nether courts.
Wind-blades and water-fires examine past wrongs,
Frost and ice in the night courts detain us in evil destinies.
For countless kalpas, we have not beheld the light,
Wandering in the abyssal springs, enduring every suffering.
Without the great sagely aid, there is no means of deliverance.

Of old, the Heavenly Worthy, in vast compassion, took pity on all beings.
Expounding the Dharma through the Eight Gates, the Eight Sufferings were thereby dispelled;
Radiating the Ninefold Light, the Nine Nether Realms were thereby opened and prospered.
Emboldened by this intent, we dare to pour forth our sincere devotion,
Earnestly beseeching the imperial altar, secretly imploring the mystic grace.
Burning incense and practicing the Dao, we repent our sins and beg for mercy.

We humbly pray that the sagely gaze may descend and the divine radiance universally illumine,
That all may be cleansed and behold the luminous splendor.
May ten thousand sins be purged, and we bathe in the gardens of Vermilion Mound;
May the five spirits undergo refinement, and we roam freely in the heavens of Cinnabar and Huo.
May blessings and benefits be manifest in the present,
And all attain purity and auspiciousness.
May the karmic hindrances of [name] be eradicated,
And virtuous deeds flourish.
May wisdom be complete and perfect,
Body and mind purified.
May our names be inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace,
And our years increased in the Azure Register.
May all our relations equally partake of the Dharma’s nectar.

Above, we pray that the jade charts of imperial enterprise surpass the Three and Five in majesty;
That the sagely sovereign of the Golden Portal transmit boundless blessings through myriad generations.
May the flames of border beacons be extinguished,
And distant frontiers return to benevolence.
May the hundred grains flourish in abundance,
And the Three Luminaries shine brightly.
May propitious clouds and auspicious dew envelop heaven and earth in omens;
May steeds of blessing and chariots of jade emerge from mountains and rivers in celebration.

Extending to all beings and creatures,
The nether gates and dark passes,
All forms of life, whether moving or still,
And all destinies, whether flying or sinking,
From the Nine Abysses below to the myriad heavens above,
May all equally receive the vast compassion and together ascend to ultimate bliss.

Above, the boundless grace of the Heavenly Worthy is made manifest;
Below, it accords with the sincere devotion of your servants.
We reverently present this petition.

**Vows**

First, may the Great Dao flow freely, and all under heaven embrace virtue.
Second, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.
Third, may the sorrowful souls of the Nine Nights all attain liberation.
Fourth, may the orphaned and unattached spirits all receive rebirth.
Fifth, may the world know great peace, and the five grains ripen in abundance.
Sixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.
Seventh, may the four seas be united, and enmity and kinship be reconciled.
Eighth, may those in hidden wombs and eggs all be born and grow.
Ninth, may chronic and recent illnesses swiftly be healed.
Tenth, may the destitute and exposed be clothed and fed.

**Replenishing the Censer**

Incense Officials and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Attending Incense Spirits,
At this place where your servants practice the Dao and ascend the altar,
May golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise.
May the hundred numinous Perfected gather here,
Before the incense burner.
May your disciples, living and deceased, receive blessings,
And the state and family be graced with favor.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions,
Guard the incense smoke and transmit the petitions just presented,
Directly to the presence of the Most True, Boundless Great Dao, the Jade Thearch and Supreme Emperor.

**Third Day at Dawn: Circumambulating the Dao**

**Entering the Chamber**
Each performs the rites, visualizing the masters as prescribed.
**Invoking the Protective Spirits**

Celestial scriptures spread in array, gazing down upon the Grand Tenuity.
Primal transformation gives rise to all,
Nine-fold coils of numinous smoke.
Eight luminaries and six revolutions,
Sustained by the sagely course.
To the left, the Vermilion Quarter receives the guests;
To the right, the Imperial Gates swing open.
Eastern Florescence and Southern Palace,
Refine and purge all that is false.
The wheeling sun casts its gaze,
The turning moon radiates its glow.
Today is a day of great celebration,
Myriad Ways converge as one.
The true *qi* of the numinous altar
Preserves Heaven from decline.
Proclaimed throughout the Three Realms,
Swift as dragons borne on the wind.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

O Most Supreme Three Heavens, Primal Origin, Three *Qi* of the Great Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,
Summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers,
The Left and Right Envoys,
The Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers,
The Golden Lads Attending Incense,
The Jade Maidens Transmitting Words,
The Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants,
The Incense Officials of the Day—
Each thirty-six in number—emerge.
Now summon the local earth deities and territorial spirits,
The true officials and rightful gods,
To swiftly prepare and open the gates.

We now burn incense,
Offering it on behalf of so-and-so, for the state and the family,
As we undertake the supreme *Yellow Register* grand fast for so many days and nights.
On this third day at dawn, we ascend the altar,
Burn incense, and circumambulate the Dao.
May the primal *qi* of the Most High’s ten directions and true Perfected
Descend and flow into our bodies,
That our petitions swiftly reach the presence of the Most True, Boundless Great Dao,
The Jade Thearch and Supreme Emperor.

**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**

Disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital,
With one heart, we reverently address the Void and Spontaneous,

The Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching,
The numinous palaces of the Five Marchmounts,
The grotto-heavens of the famous mountains,
The realized immortals and divine transcendents,
The true numina of the Three Realms.

We prostrate ourselves, having heard:
The Great Vastness merges in unity,
The Most True settles in stillness.
The Primal Honored One nurtures transformation,
The Great Dao governs Heaven.
Exalting the mysterious workings that do not act,
Unlocking the secret bolt of long life.
Principles emerge in the realm of response and welcome,
Teachings endure since eons past.
Universally delivering all beings,
Greatly propagating numinous transformation.

We, your disciples, have long relied on fortune’s favor,
Born with a foundation of tranquility.
Having received the numinous writs,
We uphold and follow the wondrous decrees.
Establishing merit and practicing the teachings,
We prioritize aiding the state.
Whatever we pray for,
It is fitting to present in petition.
Now, following the edict,
We dare to make this known.

**Reading the Petition**

As the words declare,
We deeply cultivate and offer.
Reverently for the state and family,
Universally for the living and deceased,
We bow our heads to the Mystic Void,
Our hearts earnest and sincere.
May what ought to be drawn forth
Be conveyed to fulfill our prayers.

Thus, we dare to follow the mystic statutes,
Establishing the *Yellow Register* fast.
Adopting the ranks of the Lower Primordial,
Unfolding the sacred texts of the Upper Sages.
Refining and bathing body and spirit,
Diligently observing the fast.
On this dawn of circumambulating the Dao,
We invite the Dharma assembly
To offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly to offer reverence to the Most Supreme, Most True Treasure of the Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives,
Prostrating ourselves,
Looking up to the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.
May these merits
Ascend to aid the august spirits of our ancestral temples,
Attaining the ranks of the Great Void,
Dwelling in the Mystic Culmination.
May the Emperor’s purple chambers continue sagely rule,
His cinnabar palace face the Primal Origin.
Welcoming the lords of the realm in the land of Hua,
Embracing the myriad regions in benevolence and longevity.
May the Empress manifest the Four Virtues,
Safeguarding the Six Palaces.
May the mountains and rivers form the Son of Heaven’s domain,
The bedrock secure the state of the dynastic ministers.
May the dukes, marquises, ministers, and assistants,
The officials within and without,
All affairs be true,
All beings receive blessings.

For this, we burn incense,
Taking refuge in the Great Sages, the Perfected,
Whose virtue, after attaining the Dao,
Ascends to merge with the formless,
Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

On this dawn of circumambulating the Dao,
We invite the Dharma assembly
To offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly to offer reverence to the Most Supreme, Most True Treasure of the Scriptures.

We dedicate our bodies and lives,
Prostrating ourselves,
Looking up to the Venerable Scriptures of the Most High.
May these merits
Flow to the nine generations of our family’s hidden souls,
The six relations’ lingering consciousness.
In the Northern Palace, release the *po* souls;
In the Southern Palace, refine the spirit.
Bathe in the Pool of Flowing Fire,
Ranked in the Hall of Flying Fragrance.
Reborn in the Pure Land,
Transformed in the Jasper Capital.

For this, we burn incense,
Taking refuge in the Great Sages, the Perfected,
Whose virtue, after attaining the Dao,
Ascends to merge with the formless,
Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

On this dawn of circumambulating the Dao,
We invite the Dharma assembly
To offer the third pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly to offer reverence to the Most Supreme, Most True Treasure of the Masters.

We dedicate our bodies and lives,
Prostrating ourselves,
Looking up to the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.
May these merits
Bestow blessings upon the state and family.
May our kin and relatives
All receive abundant grace.
Bathed in the numinous stream to nurture longevity,
Rinsed with jasper nectar to calm the spirit.
May myriad virtues converge,
A hundred numina together guard.
Encompassing all ranks,
Universally reaching the four kinds of beings.
Wherever the sagely grace touches,
May all ascend to the true Dao.

For this, we burn incense,
Taking refuge in the Great Sages, the Perfected,
Whose virtue, after attaining the Dao,
Ascends to merge with the formless,
Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

**Worshiping the Directions**
**Confession**

**Pacing the Void**

We bow our heads to the Golden Gates,
Hand in hand we roam the Jade Capital.
The soaring trees encircle the Garden of Rounded Light,
The Seven Treasures’ Grove shines resplendent.
Three hundred celestial beasts by name,
Lions vast as ten thousand *xun*.
Flying dragons pace and chant,
Divine phoenixes sing in measured harmony.
A numinous breeze fans wondrous blossoms,
Pure fragrance scatters upon our robes.
Without the talent of lofty immortals,
How could we indulge such a heart?

**Three Invocations**
**Three Bows**

We, your servants, with utmost sincerity prostrate ourselves in reverence,
To the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity prostrate ourselves in reverence,
To the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity prostrate ourselves in reverence,
To the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reverently Reciting the Dignities**

We, disciples of the Supreme Mystery and Mystic Capital, your servants [names],
do hereby solemnly and earnestly invoke:
The Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning,
The Supreme Great Dao Lord,
The Supreme Lord Lao,
The Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and Virtue,
The Most Perfect Celestial Emperor,
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm,
The High Ministers and Prime Chancellors,
The Four Offices and Five Emperors,
The Responsive and Perceptive of the Three Realms,
And all true numina.

We have heard:
There is a thing formed in chaos,
Preceding heaven and earth in its traces;
Its ceaseless circulation illumines alongside sun and moon.
It drums the six *qi* in the Void,
Fans the eight winds across the vast expanse.
It engenders and completes all beings,
Nurtures and enfolds all living things.
From ancient times to the present,
It has stabilized households and succored states.
We, inheriting the transformative power of the Dao,
Have long borne its profound merit.
Seeking to repay ruler and kin,
Nothing precedes this fast and vigil.

We reflect with reverence:
The countless past lives,
And present karmic bonds of our kin,
Have accumulated transgressions before the Three Officials,
And amassed faults in the Nine Realms.
Unpardoned, they remain bound in dark confinement.
Following the canonical rites,
We refine our sincerity to venerate this blessing.

We humbly pray:
May the perfected immortals gather in abundance,
May numinous grace extend afar.
May the Five Emperors, Four Offices,
Three Officials, and Nine Bureaus,
Their majestic radiance descending to illuminate,
Open the path to deliver our divine forms.
For all past and present transgressions,
In body, speech, and mind,
By this blessed aid,
May they all be washed away.

Our highest愿:
May the august spirits of our ancestral temples
Ascend to the Azure Heavens.
May the sagely body be harmonious and at ease,
The imperial Dao resplendent and clear.
May the written script and axle-widths unite,
China and the barbarians dwell in tranquility.
May frontier beacons remain unlit,
Border watchtowers free from peril.
May the hundred grains flourish,
The Three Luminaries shine bright and serene.
May outer vassals and inner screens,
Loyal ministers and meritorious officials,
All assist in fostering harmony,
Eternally glorifying the sagely destiny.

Then may the Nine Dark Springs,
The Six Paths and Three Ways,
All crawling, flying, sinking, and floating beings,
Ascend to the realm of the Dao.
Above, may the radiant Celestial Worthy’s vast compassion be manifest;
Below, may our sincerity in taking refuge be fulfilled.

We reverently make this petition known.

**Generating the Resolve**

First resolve: For the Dao,
The four great elements unite in virtue.
May the donor’s seven generations of parents
Be spared from falling into sorrow and suffering,
Ascend to the Heavenly Halls,
And enjoy sustenance by nature.

Second resolve: For the emperor and sovereign,
May the transformative power of the Dao flourish.
May academies and schools thrive,
The imperial teachings expand.
May majestic decorum be revered,
The world gaze in awe.
May the people proclaim great peace,
The four barbarians submit.
May evil and malevolence vanish of themselves,
Sages and worthies arise daily.

Third resolve: For the Dharma Master,
May great merit be established.
May teachings be clear and far-reaching,
All attain the flight of immortals.

Fourth resolve: For fellow aspirants,
May they swiftly attain the immortal Dao,
And mutually guide one another.

Fifth resolve: For the harmony of the nine relations,
May they esteem benevolence and righteousness,
Value the Dao and scorn wealth,
Their conduct a model for all.

Sixth resolve: To diminish the self,
To bestow alms upon Daoist priests and the hungry and cold.
May all people under heaven
Each find their rightful place.

Seventh resolve: For crawling and creeping beings,
May all sentient beings
Be perfected and accomplished.

Eighth resolve: To pardon past lives’ karmic retributions in this present existence,
To establish merit and redress transgressions.

Ninth resolve: For the prosperity of family and state,
May ancestral temples have descendants,
The world produce worthy talent.

Tenth resolve: To honor and receive the scriptural masters,
Never daring to slacken in equanimity.
With one heart, broadly deliver all,
Attain the rank of superior immortals,
Ascend to heaven in broad daylight,
Pay homage to the Supreme,
Eternally become perfected beings,
Riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages.
Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

**Returning to the Censer**

The Incense Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all the Attending Incense Spirits—may they cause the places where I perform the Dao to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred spirits and assembled perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. Humbly I pray that the living and the dead, the household and the state, receive blessings, and that the ten directions be suffused with grace.

May the jade lads and maidens attend the incense smoke, conveying and presenting all that I have just petitioned, directly to the presence of the Most Perfect, Boundless, and Great Dao—the Jade Emperor Supreme.

**Third Day: Midday Procession of the Dao**

[Entering the chamber]
Each pays homage to the master, contemplating the visualization as prescribed.

**Guarding the Spirits**
The Primordial Sovereign of the Void, gathering qi, abides at the center.
The Three Realms stretch into profound obscurity,
Giving rise to the vault of heaven.
Seven revolutions and nine voids,
Merging with the whirling winds.
Transforming into ten thousand spirits,
Heaven and earth open and connect.
On this auspicious day, the procession of the Dao proceeds,
Myriad demons pay reverent homage.
The radiance of dawn shines brightly,
Silently enacting the primal work.

Holding the staff and raising the banner,
Scattering flowers into the vast sky.
The ten directions universally rejoice,
The kalpas’ turning knows no end.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

The Most High Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth from within us, our thirty-six attendants of the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right official messengers, the left and right incense-bearing dragon-riding couriers, the Golden Lads attending incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words, and the thirty-six incense officials of the Five Thearchs’ direct registers and appointed days. Let the local earth deities and territorial true officials swiftly emerge to open the passes.

We now, in this very moment, burn incense and perform the Dao-procession, dedicating it to such-and-such an official or such-and-such a person, for the state and for the household, in the offering of the Most High Yellow Register Grand Fast for so many days and nights. On this third day’s midday ascent to the altar to pay homage to the Perfected and perform the Dao-procession, may we receive the life-generating qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions’ true and correct Perfected, descending into our bodies, that our prayers swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the Jade Thearch of the Supreme Dao, the Limitless Great Dao.

Each declares their dharma-rank:

Disciples of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Purity, we, so-and-so and others, reverently and with unified sincerity, address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous, the Limitless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Highest August Thearch of the Golden Watchtower, the Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Sovereign, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Highest Jade Thearch, the great holy and perfected hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Lords, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, the Golden Watchtower and Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Perfected Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the thirty-six divisions of the venerable scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the True Lord of Life and Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Ultimate, the twenty-four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lesser Teaching, the numinous palaces of the Five Marchmounts, the grotto-heavens of the famous mountains, and the perfected transcendents of the Three Realms who respond to invocations.

We prostrate and have heard: the Supreme Dao is profoundly empty, its mysterious workings congeal in stillness. It embraces the ten thousand images, nurtures the hundred spirits. Its grace extends to the living and the dead, its benevolence embraces household and state. By the kindness of masters and companions, we have received transmission of the utmost Perfected. We ought to assist the state in establishing merit, delivering people and rescuing beings. In all our prayers and supplications, how dare we not make this known above?

**Reading the Petition**
In accordance with the petition’s intent, we earnestly cultivate reverence. We repay the nurturing kindness of heaven and earth, reciprocate the beneficent gifts of the state. Above, we dedicate this to the nine generations; broadly, we extend it to all beings. We offer jade disks to express our sincerity, prepare incense and flowers to demonstrate our faith. Our minds are solely devoted and pure, hoping to attain resonance and communion.

We reverently follow the Yellow Register’s scriptural texts and the numinous transcendents’ ritual codes. We concentrate our spirits at the cinnabar watchtower, contemplate the Purple Tenuity in profound meditation. We arrange the altar’s array, turn our hearts to entreat the mandate. We humbly pray that the ninefold radiance may shine from afar, that the ten thousand sages may bestow their compassion. May they take pity on and witness our sincere devotion, broadly bestowing vast blessings.

On this midday performance of the Dao-procession, we, the assembly of dharma-practitioners, now offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the sky, directly offering reverence to the Most High and Utmost Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Venerables of the Supreme. May this merit, above, benefit the august spirits of the nine ancestral temples and the ancestral sages of the imperial lineage. May they ascend to the Jade Watchtower of Primordial Purity, shed their forms in the Jasper Palace. May the Emperor’s virtue extend to the eight seas, his longevity equal the Five Marchmounts. May his precious chart grow ever more secure, his jade calendar ever more prolonged. May the consorts and six palaces receive the splendor of Hua and divine protection. May the princes and crown princes be blessed with extended years. May the marquises, earls, dukes, ministers, and worthy assistants assist in perfecting the sagely transformation, aiding and supporting the imperial enterprise.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Master Venerables, whose virtue is most perfect. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

At this midpoint of the ritual, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this second pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly ascending to make offering to the Supreme and Most Perfect Sutra-Treasure. We prostrate ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Venerables of the Supreme. May this merit flow back to the nine generations of ancestors and all departed spirits of such-and-such a family. May their records of transgression be stricken from the registers of Fengdu, their souls refined in the Southern Flame. Calamities dissolve across kalpas, forever transcending the realm of the Five Sufferings; sins vanish without end, opening the path to deliverance from the Four Delusions. Those who suffer in the cold courts of night shall all behold the radiant light.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Master Venerables, whose virtue is most perfect. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

At this midpoint of the ritual, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly ascending to make offering to the Supreme and Most Perfect Master-Treasure. We prostrate ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Venerables of the Supreme. May this merit confer blessings upon such-and-such a family and all their kin. May their years be inscribed on the Tortoise Terrace, their longevity extended in the Phoenix Register. The clouds of the Five Turbidities disperse, the mists of the Four Demons vanish. Blessings extend without limit, misfortunes cease before they take form. May it extend to all beings, encompassing every sentient existence. May all escape the fruits of samsara, ascending together to the realm of wealth and longevity.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Master Venerables, whose virtue is most perfect. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

We complete the rites and make our repentance.

**The Hymn of Pacing the Void**

We array our Nine-Dragon Chariot,
Riding the void in carefree flight.
The Eight Heavens lie like palm and fingers,
The Six Directions—how could they be distant?
The host of perfected ones chant the Mystic Profound,
The Most High sings the pure hymn.
Incense and blossoms scatter on the wind,
Jade tones ascend to form the Purple Empyrean.
The Five Sufferings shatter in an instant,
The Eight Difficulties dissolve like sparse scripture.
Wondrous is the Garden of Numinous Treasure,
Raising this great Dharma Bridge.

**Three Invocations, Three Bows**
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Supreme Boundless Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Declaring Rank and Title**
The disciple of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, your servant [Name], together with others of like devotion, humbly and with one heart petitions the Supreme Boundless Dao, the Three Supreme Ones, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, the Prime Ministers and High Chancellors, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all revered spirits.

We have been bathed in the Mystic Merit,
Reverently receiving the transformation of the Dao.
Master and disciple open the path to salvation,
Imbibing and bearing the precious texts.
The Jade Scriptures of the Three Caverns,
The Secret Registers of the Nine Clarities—
The principles of delivering the world and long life,
The writings of ascending to heaven and enduring vision.
We ought to raise our aspirations to misty cliffs,
To nest our spirits in numinous valleys.
We vow to soar aloft,
Renouncing the dust’s confusion to tread the lofty path,
Yet we have not been able to purify our hearts in the Grotto Palaces,
To conceal our light among the forests and springs.
Our actions touch upon transgressions,
As though treading thin ice while pledging our first vows,
Bound to deliver others.
We assist the state and establish merit,
Upholding the Mystic Teachings above.
For every prayer and aspiration,
We now dare to lay bare our plea.

[Name] seeks to repay the profound kindness of sovereign and parents,
And hopes for the nation’s and family’s purity and peace.
With sincere devotion, we await the descent of great blessings.
Lamps, candles, incense, and blossoms
Express our sincerity to the Three Realms.
Silken offerings and Dharma tokens
Convey our pleas to the myriad heavens.
We implore the Great Sages and Lofty Ones
To turn their compassionate gaze upon us.
Command the Three Officials, Five Emperors,
Nine Bureaus, and Four Offices
To unlock the hidden gates of springs and dark prisons,
To absolve the long-suffering souls of the Yellow Springs.
Let the nine generations of ancestral spirits
All emerge from the depths of darkness,
Bathed in the numinous streams,
Roaming freely upon the celestial paths.
May the Ten Immortals draw them forth,
The host of sages serve as their bridge.
Awakening to the Dao, hearing the scriptures,
They shall forever transcend birth and death.
May [Name]’s family, kin, and relations
Enjoy boundless blessings.
All who receive this beneficent grace
Shall be blessed with primal fortune.
May heaven spare them from exile and conscription,
May their oaths remain unbroken as ice.
May ghostly calamities cease their flow,
May earth annul their ledgers of judgment.
In the hells of Mount Feng,
At the gates of Mount Tai’s Yellow Springs,
May lawsuits not arise,
May blessings and descendants know peace.
Above, may wind and rain be bright and clear,
Sun and moon steadfast in their splendor.
May heaven display auspicious stars,
May people be free from plague and blight.
May the sagely reign endure,
The great enterprise flourish.
May the hundred grains ripen in abundance,
The five weapons be stilled.
May the times be harmonious, customs prosperous,
Nation wealthy, family at peace.
In the Nine Nights and Three Paths,
All sentient beings
Shall receive the wondrous teachings,
Together attaining the formless.
Above, may the Heavenly Worthy’s vast salvation be manifest,
Below, may our humble devotion be answered.

**Petitioning the Vows**

First vow: May the Great Dao
Abide in tranquil emptiness,
Dwelling in serene stillness,
Clearing all to reside in purity.
May it widely open the gates of Dharma,
Instructing the stubborn and foolish.
All shall receive its beneficent grace,
Cultivating diligently with devotion.
May all fellow students
Together ascend to the void,
Preserving harmony with heaven,
Abiding forever without sorrow.

Second vow: May the myriad heavens
Congeal qi in clarity,
Vast and boundless in their embrace,
Preserving the true and securing the numinous.
May the climate be harmonious,
The four seasons balanced in peace.

The world universally at peace.
May all be broadly delivered,
The beneficence reach all beings.

Unshaken through kalpas uncounted.

Third vow: May the earth
Bear its boundless load,
Stable and unshaken,
Seas and abysses uncollapsed.

The multitudes flourishing in accord.
Nurturing life, comforting the dead,
Its grace extending to the ten directions.
May crops and plants thrive,

Entering the chamber
Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed

Guardian Spirits
The Seven Spirits of Mysterious Yin, the Nine Qi uniting in form,
Soul-essence and spirit-brilliance, the Two Radiant Ones revolving in their cycles.
Flying light blazes resplendent, everlasting splendor unfading;
Sun and moon pour forth their radiance, converging in blossoming glory.
The Great Brahma’s influence spreads wide, fire-bells soaring in flight.
Demon-kings receive their charge, journeying to the imperial capital in audience.
All beings universally succored, vast kindness extended to the hidden and dark.
Jade scriptures proclaimed, myriad joys ascending in exultation.
The Dharma drum resounds twenty-four times.

The Most High Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin and Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao,
Summon forth from within us, our attendants:
The Three and Five Merit Officials, Left and Right Envoys,
Left and Right Incense-Bearers, Dragon-Messenger Couriers,
Incense-Attending Golden Youths, Jade Maidens of Transmission,
True Talismans of the Five Thearchs, and the Day-Officers of Incense—
thirty-six of each, emerge.
At this moment, summon the local earth deities and territorial spirits,
the true officials and proper divinities, to swiftly depart and present their reports.
We now, in this act of burning incense, dedicate ourselves on behalf of Official So-and-So and Person So-and-So,
for state and family, in the performance of the Most High Yellow Register Grand Retreat for such-and-such days and nights.
On this third day, at twilight, ascending the altar to pay homage to the Perfected and perform the Dao,
we pray that the life-qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions’ True Perfected may descend and flow into our bodies,
that our petitions may swiftly reach the presence of the Peerless Great Dao, the Jade Emperor, the Supreme Lord of the Most High.

Each declares their dharma rank:
Disciples of the Upper Clarity Mysterious Capital, we, your subjects,
humbly and with one heart, reverently address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
the Peerless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,

and all responsive and perceptive Perfected of the Three Realms.

We have heard that the vast and subtle Great Dao
embraces the Three Realms to congeal the Perfected;
the boundless and profound Mysterious Wind
crowns the myriad dharmas to bestow transformation.
By good fortune, we have received blessed favor and obtained the precious scriptures:
Dragon Script of the Three Realms, Phoenix Seal of the Eight Heavens.
We command and summon, invoking the Perfected and descending the numinous.
Yet we have not been able to retreat to secluded groves, renew ourselves, and ascend in deliverance;
thus, we should proclaim and expound the wondrous teachings, spreading the Dharma’s sound.
Above, we assist the emperor, universally blessing the seas and lands.
In all our aspirations, dare we not make this known above?

Reading the Petition:
In accordance with the petition’s words, its meaning profound, we reverently offer it.
Above, for state and family, we pray for the descent of blessings and auspiciousness.
Presenting the petition with sincerity, we lay bare our hearts to entreat the mandate.
Exhausting our cinnabar sincerity in the lower realm, we look up to the myriad sages in the upper mystery.

We, leading the Dharma assembly, follow the scriptures’ intent,
purifying our spirits and quieting our thoughts, focusing our minds on the subtle and imperceptible.
We have established the retreat altar, turning the scriptures and performing the Dao.
At this twilight performance of the Dao, we invite the Dharma assembly
to offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most High Perfected Treasure of the Dao.
We surrender our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground,
looking up to the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.

May they repose in the Mysterious Capital, their blessings flowing to the imperial pole.
May the jade charts endure forever, the great treasure flourish abundantly.
May the emperor’s sagely virtue abide in the imperial residence, as enduring as heaven and earth.
May his years surpass the Song and Hua mountains, his beneficence vast as the deep blue sea.

the various princes transmit the glory of the ten thousand chariots.
May court and countryside be loyal and steadfast, the frontier walls harmonious.
May the myriad officials and hundred ministers assist and support the grand foundation.
May all within the seas and lands together ascend the realm of longevity.

At this moment, we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Perfected and Sages of our masters and teachers,
their virtue of having attained the Dao and ascended into the formless.
May we harmonize with the Dao and unite with the Perfected.

At this twilight performance of the Dao, we invite the Dharma assembly
to offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most High Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.
We surrender our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground,
looking up to the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.

and all the hidden and obscure spirits.
May they tread upon lotus pedestals, roam the divine immortal palaces.

may the Five Thearchs’ supervisory covenants inscribe their names in the jade tablets of life.
May they soar through the Three Realms, revolve through the Ten Floras.

At this twilight performance of the Dao, we invite the Dharma assembly

their virtue of having attained the Dao and ascended into the formless.

Homage to the Directions
Repentance

**Triple Invocation, Triple Bow**

To the Heavenly True Unity Palace of the Celestial Perfected,
radiant and resplendent in its crown of glory.
The Wheel of the Dharma turns in luminous order,
spiraling through empty space to enter the formless.
The August Sovereign strokes the clouds with pride,
while the host of Perfected recite the Cavern Scriptures.
Lofty Immortals stand in solemn praise,
preserving purity through endless kalpas.

We prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**

Disciples of the Supreme Mystery Metropolis, your servants [names],
with reverent sincerity, humbly re-invoke and supplicate:
the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning;
the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;
the Supreme Lord Lao;
the Venerable Celestial Worthies of the Dao and its Power;
the Most True Great Emperor;
the Heavenly Thearch;
the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
the Jade Assistants and High Ministers;
the True Kings of the Four Poles;
the Five Emperors of the Three Realms;
the Grotto-Palaces of the Sacred Mountains;
all responsive and manifesting Perfected Spirits who answer according to karmic conditions.

By past good affinity, we have turned the wheel within the realm of the Dao.
Reverently receiving the Supreme Way, we have studied and embraced the Mystic Scriptures.
At the opening of the Primordial Charts, the numinous texts unfolded their teachings,
their blessings flowing to the ten thousand kinds, their spiritual signs manifesting in the five directions.
We have crossed the Mystic Ford, gazing upward to explore the profound mysteries.
Yet the celestial writ remains secret and weighty, its cultivation deep and subtle.
It is fitting to dwell in secluded mounds, refining the body in remote crags.
Yet we linger within the world, drifting through the dusty realm.
We aspire to establish meritorious deeds, repaying the celestial blessings,
aiding the people and assisting the state, bestowing fortune upon all beings.

Your disciples, reflecting upon past causes,
stretching back through accumulated kalpas—
the nine generations and seven ancestors,
all manner of karmic kin—
have accrued inner defilements through the three karmas,
and outer entanglements through the six senses.
The five sounds assail the ears,
the ten thousand things agitate the heart.
The nose delights in fragrance, the mouth savors fine delicacies,
the body indulges in splendor, the nature sinks into extravagance.
The eyes cling to forms, the mind strays into deviant realms.
The six dusts and six desires obstruct the gate of purity;
the ten sufferings and ten fetters sever the subtle root of the Dao.
Through these manifold transgressions, we remain mired in the three evil destinies.
Faults congeal into dense darkness, souls confined in endless night,
yet to receive pardon, still bound within the gates of darkness.

We have heard that the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning,
in great compassion, broadly delivers all.
His radiance pervades the three realms,
his gaze surveys the eight gates.
Witnessing the causes of sin and blessing,
he extends the statutes of salvation.
Thus, we present the Dharma tokens, establishing this sacred altar,
repenting of sins and praying for grace,
following the ranks of the numinous immortals;
reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao,
in accordance with the sacred writ of the Supreme Sages.
We pour forth our sincerity before the imperial altar,
focusing our minds upon the Mystic Ultimate.

We humbly beseech the Most True Great Sages,
the Supreme Dharma Kings,
to emit the five-colored divine light,
illuminating the nine dark hells.
To send down the nine-dragon talismanic decrees,
commanding the Three Officials
to deliver and rescue sinful souls,
freeing them from eternal night.
For the nine generations and seven ancestors of [name]’s family,
may they transcend the gates of the Yellow Springs.
May all karmic adversaries and roots of sin,
boundless and immeasurable,
those drifting in the three evil destinies,
those revolving in the six paths of rebirth,
all past retributions and present conditions,
be cleansed and purified.
May the nine kinds of kin and relations
together enjoy the causes of fortune.
May accumulated transgressions and infinite offenses
be dissolved and released,
all emerging from the bonds of desire.
May unmanifested disasters be dispelled,
and future blessings descend.
May longevity extend and blessings endure,
misfortunes vanish and calamities be removed.

Above, may the imperial enterprise flourish,
the royal domain endure for ages.
May mountains equal the Sage’s longevity,
the sun match the Sovereign’s wisdom.
May the six qi harmonize and the hundred grains ripen,
the Jade Candle be regulated and the Golden Mirror shine clear.
May ritual splendor illuminate all,
seas and mountains be tranquil.
May the Hua and Xia be at peace,
the stars and planets follow their courses.
May mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams,
all officials within and without,
protect the state and pacify the people,
prolonging prosperity and great fortune.

Above, may the great mercy of the Heavenly Venerable be manifest;
below, may the sincerity of our refuge and devotion be fulfilled.
We respectfully present this supplication.

**Vows**

First, may the Great Dao flow freely, all under heaven cherishing its virtue.
Second, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.
Third, may the sorrowful souls of the nine nights all attain liberation.
Fourth, may the orphaned souls without refuge all receive rebirth.
Fifth, may the world know great peace, the five grains abundant harvest.
Sixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.
Seventh, may the four seas be united, enmity and kinship reconciled.
Eighth, may those in hidden wombs and eggs all be born and grow.
Ninth, may chronic and acute illnesses swiftly be cured.
Tenth, may the destitute and exposed be clothed and fed.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**

Incense Official Messengers,
the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
Attendant Incense Spirits,
at this place where we practice the Dao,
may golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise.
May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected
gather here before this incense burner.
May the disciples who perform this fast,
whether living or deceased,
and their families and states,
all receive blessings.
May the jade youths and maidens of the ten directions
guard the incense smoke,
transmitting and presenting our supplications
swiftly to the Celestial Venerable of the Boundless Great Dao,
before the Jade Emperor’s throne.

Each performs the rites, visualizing and contemplating as prescribed.

**Invoking the Guardian Spirits**

Azure yang shines in emptiness,
the sun’s radiance revolves with numinous power.
Divine tigers repel evil,
flying immortals and chiming bells stream through the air.
Crushing treachery and vanquishing trials,
the myriad demons bind their forms.
Ninefold subtle lights return to the Dao,
eightfold might seizes essence.
A thousand Perfected audit the records,
the Three Origins purge and purify.
The Left howls the Central Yellow,
the Right commands the Six Dings.
Seven cycles and eight unions,
revolving through the celestial scriptures.
The sagely transformation towers sublime,
the Three Ways proceed in harmony.
Auspicious clouds spread and diffuse,
merging with the Yellow Court’s luminous scene.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

The Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summons forth from within this disciple’s body:
the Three and Five Merit Officials,
the Left and Right Attendant Messengers,
the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths,
the Word-Transmitting and Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,
and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Incense Officials of the Day—
thirty-two of each, to emerge.
As they emerge, let them solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar’s Celestial Thearchs and Divine Lords,
calling forth the local earth gods and domain spirits, the Perfected Officials and True Deities of this place.
On this day, we offer our intentions for the Jade Gate’s grace,
presenting our reverent petitions inscribed in cinnabar.
May we receive the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure,
descending to flow into our bodies.
Then shall purple essence surge and flourish,
the Jade Towers blaze with light.
The Five Elders assist the root,
the Ten Thousand Thearchs gather the true.
The body becomes a luminous pearl,
riding the light to mount the celestial throne.
Golden radiance blazes resplendent,
commanding qi to ascend to the Upper Clarity.
May our supplications swiftly reach
the Most High Boundless Great Dao’s formless, nameless,
void and spontaneous Golden Gates and Jade Steps.

**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**

Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of the Upper Clarity,
Most High Three Caverns Dharma Masters,
conducting the Great Yellow Register Fast for the Crown Prince’s Birth Rites,
we, the [Mountain] Peak Masters, the [Celestial] Thearch Perfected Ones, your servants [Names],
with unified sincerity, reverently address:
the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin,
the Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord,
the Supreme Great Dao, Golden Gates Mysterious Origin Heavenly Thearch, the Most High Lord Lao,
the August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven,
the Great Sage Perfected Ones and True Lords who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions,
the Thirty-Six Celestial Thearchs,
the Jade Void Thearch,
the Jade Thearch and Great Thearch,
the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numen, Northern Perfection,
the Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Gates, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace,
the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace,
the Numinous Treasure’s Most True Radiant August Dao Lord,
the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
the Southern Lord of Compassionate Life,
the Lord Immortal of Literary Prosperity,
the Longevity-Extending Registrar, Lord Han the Venerable,
the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching,
the responsive and perceptive deities of the Three Realms,
and all true numina.

We, your servants, humbly recall:
before the myriad transformations,
the Great Dao was the source of all beginnings.
It bore the womb of sun and moon,
nurturing the cosmos of heaven and earth.

The Three Sequences are now divided, the Four Elements duly ordered.
At the founding of this realm and nation, all lands and seas are governed.
None is more revered than the August Emperor, who aligns with Heaven to establish the ultimate pole.
He rectifies the positions of ruler and minister, and clarifies the rites of primogeniture.
Thus, through successive generations, the foundation is inherited and brilliance continued.
The weight of the noble heir’s mandate is honored, gazed upon by the myriad states;
All draw essence from the Three Luminaries, congealing the splendor of the Two Images.
Manifesting distinction through the Jade Light, riding the Pivot Lightning to command numinous power.
On this auspicious occasion, we duly offer reverent prayers.
Moreover, in compliance with the imperial edict, how dare we not report above?

The Emperor’s Blue Petition is now respectfully proclaimed and presented.
As the words declare, our devotion in cultivation is profound.

We, your servants, adhere to the Mysterious Teachings and lead the Dharma assembly.
Burning incense and lighting lamps, we examine the registers of extended life;
Reciting scriptures and pacing the Dao, we follow the ritual texts of the Numinous Treasure.
Focusing our thoughts on the Upper Clarity, we reverently honor the lower realms.

At this pure dawn, as we perform the Dao-pacing rite, the Dharma assembly and I
offer this first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most True and Supreme Dao Treasure.

We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves,
and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May these merits flow to the august numina of the altars of soil and grain,
to the ancestral temples and successive sages,
as their spirits roam the Great Vastness and ascend to the Nine Clarities.
May they ascend the Golden Gates to partake in the Mysterious,
and mount the Jade Clarity to unite with the Dao.
May auspicious blessings be eternally bestowed to firmly secure the state and household.
May the imperial mandate endure far and long, boundless as Heaven.

Thus, we now burn incense, personally submitting to the Great Sage Assembly,
the Perfected and Attained, whose virtue after enlightenment
ascended into the Formless, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao.

At this pure dawn, as we perform the Dao-pacing rite, the Dharma assembly and I
offer this second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most True and Supreme Scripture Treasure.

We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves,
and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May these merits flow to the Emperor.

We humbly pray that the sagely reign be everlasting, and the celestial longevity vast.
Governing with effortless grace from the cinnabar throne, may he equal the heights of Xuanyuan and Fuxi;
Adorning the pearled tassels with non-action, may he surpass the eras of Tang and Yu.
His heart embraces the Eight Directions, his rule unifies the Nine Distances.
May empresses, consorts, princes, and ministers assist in his sagely plans.
May the myriad officials and common folk radiantly propagate his illustrious transformation.

Now therefore we kindle incense, surrendering ourselves to the Great Sage Assembly of the Most True and Venerable Masters. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with truth.

On this pure dawn as we perform the Dao rites, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most True and Supreme Master Treasure.

We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves,
and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May these merits flow to the Crown Prince.

We humbly pray that the eastern quarter shine with increased radiance, and the thunder palace bear forth splendor. May he observe the unfolding of auspicious signs at the breaking of the shell, and gather blessings as the jade mountains rise. May he secure the great enterprise and forever assist in the sagely plans. May his longevity stretch boundless as the seas of Shun, and his blessings extend farther than the zhuangchun tree. Thereafter, may his kindness pervade the hidden and manifest, his benevolence encompass the world. May all beings—moving and still, flying and submerged—together enjoy upright fortune.

Now therefore we kindle incense, surrendering ourselves to the Great Sage Assembly of the Most True and Venerable Masters. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with truth. We perform the rites of the directions and repent our transgressions.

We, your humble servants, prostrate ourselves and have heard that the Most High and Venerable Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions, boundless in majesty, condenses and upholds the Supreme Mystery, bestowing blessings upon the earth below. The Five Elder Thearchs unfold the registers of truth to deliver humankind; the Four Pole Perfected Kings descend with sacred ordinances to succor all beings. Throughout the realm and the state, all receive felicity and auspiciousness. Now, on this propitious day of the imperial heir’s wondrous birth, we perform these rites with utmost reverence. We fix our minds upon the Three Realms and lift our thoughts toward the Tenfold Splendor.

We humbly besevere that the myriad sages manifest their radiance, bestowing extraordinary blessings upon the imperial throne; that the thousand perfected ones extend their numinous influence, bringing great fulfillment to the Eastern Palace. May his years equal the vastness of the four seas, and his blessings rival the height of Mount Song. May he be granted celestial longevity, forever securing the dragon chart. May the five planets follow their constant courses, and the three luminaries shine with brilliance. May the hidden and manifest alike be bathed in the profound grace. Having attained the Dao, may he ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with truth.

*Three Invocations*
May the Dharma be his spouse, cherishing the scriptures as pearls and jade.
May he uphold the precepts to restrain the six senses, contemplating the Dao to dispel desires.
With purity and upright qi settled, his spirit serene and silent,
May heavenly demons all revere and protect him, enjoying great fortune life after life.

*Three Prostrations*
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Most High and Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

*Reverent Recitation of Dignities*
Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mystic Capital, Supreme Masters of the Three Caverns, conducting the Huanglu Grand Fast for the Rite of the Imperial Heir’s Birth—we, Ministers of the Sacred Peaks, Perfected Lords of the Five Emperors, most reverently and repeatedly invoke the Most High and Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning; the Most High Great Dao Lord; the Most High Lord Lao; the Venerable and Perfected of the Ten Directions and Boundless Great Dao and Virtue; the Celestial Thearchs and Heavenly Emperors; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the Supreme Ministers and Prime Ministers, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all venerable numina.

By the convergence of our karmic fortune, we have been bathed in the profound transformation of the Dao. The true scriptures govern the age, and the Great Dao is proclaimed and practiced.

Thus, though dust-mote humble, we partake in the cultivation of the wondrous Dharma. The precious talismans of the Nine Heavens, the jade chapters of the Three Caverns, phoenix-script on jasper tablets, dragon-writ on jade decrees—we delve deeply into their true mysteries and follow them with reverent adherence. In this, we aid the state and succor the age, establishing merit and propagating transformation. All who practice and uphold these rites may ascend to present their offerings.

On this auspicious day of the Crown Prince’s propitious birth, a gathering to pray for blessings and the descent of felicity, the celestial radiance shines bright, the solar emblem glows resplendent. As the scribes of Lu inquired of names, so the gates of Yao bore dreams of concord. Nurturing virtue by inheriting the resplendent flame, he stands as the steadfast exemplar for all nations. In this propitious season, we purify ourselves with solemn fast and devotion, our minds fixed upon the Three Realms, our thoughts cleansed in the profound mystery. We burn incense, kindle lamps, recite scriptures, and circumambulate the Dao, hoping that through our earnest devotion, our prayers may ascend to the august numina.

We prostrate ourselves, beseeching the Three Supreme Venerables and the Great Saints of the Ten Directions to cast their merciful gaze upon us and perceive the sincerity of our hearts. May they bestow great blessings upon the ancestral temple and secure the grand designs of the state. May the realm enjoy peace, and the sacred person of the Emperor be eternally blessed. May the Emperor’s Northern Culmen bring prosperity, and the Eastern Sea pour forth fortune. May the imperial consorts and inner ministers, the six palaces, support the imperial residence with reverence; may the chief ministers and all officials illuminate the royal governance with brilliance. May the Crown Prince, like the double sun, radiate with increasing splendor, his virtuous brilliance surpassing that of Shun; may the Lesser Sea be vast and profound, embracing the boundless destiny of the sky of Yao. May the sacred lineage flourish and the foundations of the state be firmly established.

Thereafter, may the Seven Luminaries shine in full clarity, the Eight Winds harmonize in perfect balance. May weapons be sheathed and banners furled, seas and mountains enjoy tranquility. May the darkest passes be illumined with light, and all destinies delight in the joy of the Dao’s transformation. May people return to the Way and virtue, customs be steeped in harmony and peace. May all realms, within and beyond, together attain boundless felicity. Above, may the radiant grace of the Heavenly Venerable be manifest; below, may it fulfill the sincerity of our devotion in offering this prayer.

With reverence, we invoke:

First invocation: For the Dao, the Four Great Elements unite in virtue. May the seven generations of parents be spared from suffering and sorrow, ascend to the celestial halls, and enjoy sustenance by nature’s bounty.

Second invocation: For the Emperor and rulers of states, may the Dao’s transformation flourish. May academies teem with scholars, the imperial teachings expand in grandeur. May their majestic demeanor inspire awe, witnessed by all under heaven. May the people proclaim great peace, the four barbarians submit in reverence. May evil and malevolence vanish of themselves, and sages and worthies arise daily.

Third invocation: For the Dharma Masters, may their merit and virtue be greatly established, their teachings and transformations be luminous and far-reaching. May they all attain the flight of immortals.

The incense is offered anew.

Fragrant Bureau Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attendant Fragrant Spirits, may this place where I present my petition naturally birth golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected Ones gather here, assembling before the grotto censer. May my body radiate golden splendor, severing the roots of the womb.

**Guardian of the Numinous**
Cinnabar numen, vermilion fire, blazing auroras stir the winds. The crimson wheel turns with刚 vigor, the celestial light of the eight directions surges. Its might bursts forth, enveloping all, transforming myriad realms. Molten gold scatters, and demonic traces vanish. It repels evil and shatters malevolence, illuminating primordial merit. The golden talisman summons and commands, treading clouds and spurring dragons. Songs of celebration resound, scattering flowers into the vast sky. The divine transformation operates in hidden motion, bringing peace and prosperity to the four extremities. Prostrating before the Emperor, none dare be irreverent.

*Strike the Dharma drum twenty-four times*

The Supreme Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Dao summons forth from within us the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Golden Youths attending incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words and scattering flowers, and the thirty-two Fragrant Bureau Officers of the Five Thearchs’ direct retinue for this day. Let them emerge, adorned and prepared, to open the gates of the Mysterious Altar and summon the local earth deities and true officials of this realm. Today, we offer this prayer for the Jade Threshold, presenting our cinnabar petitions. May the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend, flowing into our bodies. May the purple essence surge forth, the Jade Threshold shine brightly, the Five Elders nurture our roots, and the myriad emperors gather our true essence. May our bodies reflect the luminous pearl, riding the light to the imperial court. May the golden radiance blaze resplendently, guiding our qi to the Upper Clarity. May the words we have uttered swiftly reach the Jade Threshold of the Supreme Vast Dao, the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous.

*Each declares their dharma rank*

Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Grotto of the Mysterious Capital, Supreme Masters of the Three Caverns, officiating the grand Yellow Register Fast for the birth rites of the Crown Prince, we, the Perfected of [such-and-such] Peak, the True Man [so-and-so], together with utmost sincerity, humbly address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Vast Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Emperor of the Golden Threshold of the Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Sovereign, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Great Sage Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Lords and Elders of the Thirty-Six Heavens, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Jade Emperor and Supreme Emperor, the Eastern Flowery, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital, Golden Threshold, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, and Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the thirty-six divisions of venerable scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Southern Lord of Compassionate Life, the Lord of Immortal Governance Wen Chang, the Longevity Registrar Han the Elder, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teachings, and the Three Realms’ Venerable Spirits of Salvation and Life Preservation.

We have heard that the two qi merge in harmony, and the three numina transform and nurture. They bestow divine efficacy upon the wondrous origin, and the Dao’s functions are apportioned from the imperial ancestors. Heaven and earth are thus formed, and the sun and moon thereby illuminate. Myriad distinctions stand in array, unified by emperors and kings; the nine regions are extended, revered by the primordial sovereigns. They emulate heaven to establish their position, inheriting the sagely and continuing the foundation. The four seas gaze upon them, and all directions look up to them. We, your servants, deeply revere the state and earnestly seek the true. Daring to seize this auspicious occasion of the sagely birth, we reverently prepare this assembly of offerings. Moreover, obeying the imperial decree, how dare we not make this known above?

*The imperial prayer is to be solemnly proclaimed.*

*Reading the prayer*
As the words of the prayer declare, we devote ourselves to cultivation with utmost sincerity. Thus, we focus our minds upon the Mysterious Ultimate, directing our thoughts to the Pure Capital. We unfold the ordinances of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Treasure and follow the ranks of the Five Elders’ longevity. We recite scriptures, perform the Dao, light lamps, and burn incense. Together, we exhaust our sincerity, reverently seeking luminous protection.

At this midpoint of the procession, we, the assembled Dharma practitioners, now offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We surrender our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, and with heads bowed to the ground, we rely upon the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the august spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral temples of former sages. May the divine transcend the Purple Culmen, and auspicious omens gather upon the grand design. May the Emperor’s merit rival that of the legendary sovereigns, his benevolence encompassing Shun and Yu. May his longevity equal the Northern Culmen, his blessings vast as the Eastern Sea. May the empress, imperial consorts, and princes uphold the sagely plans to bring peace to the six directions; may worthy ministers and virtuous aides proclaim the imperial grace to nurture all beings. May civil virtue and martial prowess shine forth, illuminating the ten thousand states.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masterly Worthies, in their virtue most true. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with truth.

At this midpoint of the ritual procession, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this second pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, ascending directly to make offering to the supreme, most true Treasure of Scriptures. We prostrate ourselves, bodies and lives surrendered, heads bowed to the ground, and rely upon the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the Crown Prince. We humbly beseech the Great Emperor of the Jasper Palace and the Primordial Honored One of the Golden Portals: may phoenix-script bestow the talisman of extended life, and may dragon-gorges inscribe the rank of longevity. May we follow the perfected immortals upon the watchtower peaks and join the sleeves of transcendents upon Mount Song. May he forever assist in the sagely design and secure the foundation of the state.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masterly Worthies, in their virtue most true. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into primordial form, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with truth.

At this midpoint of the ritual procession, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, ascending directly to make offering to the supreme, most true Treasure of Masters. We prostrate ourselves, bodies and lives surrendered, heads bowed to the ground, and rely upon the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the Three Realms and Ten Directions, to all heavens and earths, to the true immortals who govern, and to the spirits who oversee rivers and mountains. We humbly beseech that the Three Luminaries above be rightly aligned and that the myriad beings below flourish; that the eight winds be harmonized to nurture and sustain, and the six qi be ordered to shape and perfect. May we rectify customs and succor the people, deliver the hidden and pacify the state. May the blades of war be sheathed, frost-tipped spears spared the toil of repelling foes; may grain and harvests overflow, red cauldrons brimming with the auspicious glow of flowing light. May the wind of the Dao spread afar, its beneficent grace boundless.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masterly Worthies, in their virtue most true. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with truth.

The rites are complete; we repent.

Threefold Invocation, Thrice Bowing—
How flourishing the state and household stand,
How thronging the scriptures and Dao arise!
Heaven and humankind share one intent,
In misty ascent they enter the Great Vehicle.
From the heart we establish the field of blessings,
And the Wheel of Dharma ascends, vast and boundless.
Seven generations ascend to celestial halls,
While this body soars in broad daylight.

We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Reiterating the Dharma Ranks—
We, your humble servants, [Names] and others, respectfully and solemnly invoke:
The Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning;
The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;
The Supreme Lord Lao;
The Boundless Hosts of Dao and Virtue in the Ten Directions;
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
The Heavenly Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
The High Ministers and Prime Chancellors, the Four Administrations and Five Emperors;
The Masters of Immortality, Keepers of the Registers, and the Hosts of Everlasting Life;
All the responsive and perceptive true numina of the Three Realms.

By virtue of past karmic causes, we have been privileged to partake in the mysterious transformation.
We have unfurled the profound mysteries of the Three Caverns and the Three Clarities,
Beholding the origin that gives birth to heaven and earth.
Serene and nameless, it operates alone in boundless vastness.
From the wondrous non-being, it divides into wondrous being—
Those who attain it share the numinosity of heaven and earth.
Through the cultivation of truth, one aligns with the utmost real—
Those who perfect it abide in the realm of the subtle and formless, ever soaring.
Thus, the golden tablets and jade scrolls, hidden within the celestial palaces,
Bestow blessings and deliver humankind, descending upon the mortal world.
They safeguard the nation’s destiny and assist the imperial throne,
Vast and unfathomable, revered through ages past and present.

We, your servants, humbly serve our lord and are earnestly devoted to our time.
At this propitious moment when the Azure Palace brings forth brilliance,
We follow the vermilion writs and the methods of invoking the true.
We gaze earnestly toward the starry Han and pray to the vaulted heavens.
Incense altars waft with phoenix smoke, scriptures chanted in dragon-script.
With hands joined and heads bowed, we hope the myriad sages will silently respond;
With utmost sincerity and reverence, we await the reflection of the heavens.
May copious blessings flow forth, securely anchoring the precious chart.
May the numinous spirits of the altars and states ascend to the sunlit palaces;
May the ancestral spirits of the lineage mount the radiant jade halls.
May the Emperor’s virtue equal that of Fuxi and Shaohao,
Following in the footsteps of the Divine Farmer and the Yellow Emperor.
May he tower over the peaks of Kun’ao, sharing their blessings,
And expand the Peng Sea, prolonging his years.
May the Empress, consorts, and princes safeguard the great treasure.
May the civil and military ranks assist and illuminate the grand foundation.
May the Crown Prince, with sagacious virtue and reverent brilliance,
His heroic bearing solemn and majestic,
Surpass the filial piety of the Zhou heir and the humility of the Han deputy.
May his longevity endure like Mount Song,
Supporting the Morning Star for a hundred million years;
May his fortune run deep as the abyssal seas,
Expanding the Lesser Sea for a thousand ages.
May the Two Symbols shine in harmony,
The Three Luminaries upright and true.
May the balmy winds enter the pitch pipes,
The harmonious qi regulate the seasons.
May agricultural labors amass in granaries,
And the people’s customs all ascend to benevolence and longevity.
May the Three Disciplines and Nine Nights,
All beings—flying, crawling, moving, still—
Share equally in the vast and boundless grace,
All attaining the fruit of true rectitude.
Above, may it manifest the great compassion of the Heavenly Venerable;
Below, may it fulfill our servants’ sincerity in taking refuge.

We respectfully present this invocation.

The Most High Mysterious Origin, Supreme Lord of the Dao, summons forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Word and Flower, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officers—thirty-two of each—forth they come. As they emerge, they array themselves in solemn attire and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar to the Heavenly Thearch and Divine Lord. They shall summon the local earth gods and territorial true officials.

Today, in reverent offering for the intent of supplication and grace at the Jade Palace, we present our cinnabar script. May the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies. Thus shall the purple essence surge and flourish, the Jade Palace shine resplendent. The Five Elders shall nurture the root, the Ten Thousand Thearchs gather the true. Our forms shall mirror the luminous pearl, riding the light and harnessing the imperial chariot. Golden radiance blazes forth, guiding the qi to ascend to the Upper Clarity. May our entreaties swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Portal and Jade Steps of the Great Dao.

Each declares their dharma rank:
Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of the Upper Clarity, Supreme Masters of the Three Caverns, we, the Yellow Register Grand Fast Masters of the Descendant’s Birth Rites of [such-and-such] Peak, Master [Name], and the Perfected Minister [Name], with one heart, reverently address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Honored One, the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Highest Great Dao, the Golden Portal Mysterious Origin Heavenly Thearch Emperor, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Great Sage Perfected Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the True Lords and Elders, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Jade Emperor and Great Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern True, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Portal, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity, Upper Palace, Numinous Treasure, Perfected Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Southern Lord of Life, the Lord Immortal of Literary Florescence, the Longevity Registrar and Minister of Destiny, Lord Elder Han, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Peaceful Lesser Teaching, and all responsive and efficacious true numina of the Three Realms.

We prostrate ourselves and have heard: the Great Void is without form, and the Dao is the root of the ten thousand forms; the ten thousand forms receive life, and the Dao is the foundation of their mutual generation. Thus do the Mysterious and Yellow unfold in order, their light and brilliance manifest and proclaimed. The sun’s palace and moon’s city stand high above the Nine Clarities; the utmost true and primordial sages dwell steadfast within the Eight Luminaries. They nurture the vast and benefit the heavens and humans, spreading divine merit to guard the states and kingdoms. Therefore, the five sacred and profound chapters reward the Five Thearchs and expand the Five Directions; the Three Caverns, vast and deep, emerge from the Three Clarities to bless the Three Realms. Lofty beyond measure, revered through kalpas uncounted.

We have long revered the mysterious scriptures and early partaken of the true and wondrous. We aspire to rely on the power of the Dao to respond to this flourishing era. On this day of resplendent radiance, we pray for the myriad sages to bestow auspicious blessings. Moreover, in accordance with the imperial edict, how dare we not make this known above? The emperor’s blue-green memorial shall now be respectfully proclaimed.

The memorial is read.
As the words of the memorial dictate, it is fitting to present this petition. Thus do we follow the profound and secret model, opening the courtyard of myriad blessings. We burn incense and light lamps, recite scriptures, and perform the Dao. The household spirits remain tranquil, our aspirations lofty and subtle. Together we cultivate sincere devotion, seeking auspicious protection.

Today, as we perform the evening circumambulation, the assembled ritualists offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme, Utmost True Treasure of the Dao.

We surrender our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, heads to the earth, and reverently rely upon the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May this merit flow to the august spirits of the ancestral temple and the illustrious ancestors of successive generations. May the Eight Radiant Jade Chariots ascend the azure heavens to attain perfection; may the myriad luminous whirlwinds traverse the crimson empyrean to realize the Dao. May the Purple Palace gather our spirits, bestowing protection upon the imperial domain. May it transcend the Six Directions in non-action, surpassing the eras of Fu Xi and Shen Nong to perpetuate the imperial blessings.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the great sagely hosts, the virtues of the utmost true, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless. Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

Today, as we perform the evening circumambulation, the assembled ritualists offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme, Utmost True Treasure of the Scriptures.

We humbly pray that blessings fill the Eight Seas, gathering myriad auspices to pay homage; that longevity towers like the Five Peaks, assembling a thousand blessings to support the imperial pole. May he receive the glory of the Zhou within his arts, and encompass the vastness of the Xia and Shang within his grasp. May the empress and consorts of the Six Palaces uphold his sagely virtue; may the myriad princes and hundred ministers assist and augment the heavenly blessings. May the ten thousand states live in harmony, the five weapons sheathed and still. May the Three Nurturers flourish abundantly, and all ranks and positions expand in glory.

We humbly pray that the Eastern Palace receive protection, and the imperial pole bequeath blessings. May the Dragon Tower’s brilliance increase like the radiance of rain, and the halberd’s splendor double the auspicious light. May fortune exalt him to the heights of Kunlun, and longevity extend like the age of the camphor tree. May his filial virtue and loyal conduct illuminate the ten thousand regions.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the great sagely hosts, the virtues of the utmost true, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless. Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

The directions are saluted.
Repentance.

Three Invocations, Three Bows

The Great Dao pervades the profound void,
With mindfulness, none fails to align.
Refining the essence to join the immortals,
Thus forming the vajra body.
Transcending the three realms’ tribulations,
Dissolving the five hells’ sufferings.
All return to the Supreme Scriptures—
In stillness, we bow our heads in reverence.

We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Reverently addressing the sacred ranks:
We, your humble servants, now solemnly invoke the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the boundless hosts of sagely and virtuous beings of the Ten Directions; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Heavenly Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the Supreme Ministers and Prime Counsellors; the True Kings of the Four Poles; the Great Sage of Longevity; the Lords of Immortal Multitudes; the Registrars of the Southern Palace; and the revered spirits of the Three Realms.

We humbly recall: the Primordial Jade Calendar of the Mystic Void, the Golden Scriptures of the Great Existence. At the dawn of radiant enlightenment, upon the vast expanse of supreme nothingness, the divine winds gathered in subtlety, and the true Dao fused with essence. There emerged the chapters of *Eternal Life and Salvation of the World*, containing the essentials of soaring ascent and transcendence. The Dharma’s resonance first resounded, transmitted through forty thousand kalpas; the Crimson Palace repeatedly proclaimed it, revered by five hundred million heavens. Thus, the Nine August Masters received it, practicing and venerating it through the ages, aiding the state and pacifying the realm, bestowing auspicious blessings and conferring fortune.

We, aspiring to truth and holding the Dao in reverence, unfold the primordial. We pray for boundless blessings, awaiting the communion of sincere devotion. On this propitious day of stellar brilliance, we follow the rites of supplication to invoke felicity. Lighting lamps and burning incense, we recite the scriptures and circumambulate the Dao. With minds fixed upon the Ten Poles, we send forth our earnest pleas to the heavens. We beseech the myriad sages to incline their radiance, and the hosts of venerables to extend their grace. May their discerning gaze bestow favor, and the Purple Palace grant blessings.

May the imperial dynasty’s altars flourish and endure, the ancestral temples stand secure. May the grand foundation be firmly established, enduring through eternal kalpas. May the Emperor’s longevity surpass Penglai, his fortune equal the boundless heavens. May his reign mirror the calendars of Yao and Shun, endless as the sun and moon; may his domain encompass the traces of Yu and the enclosures of Zhou, bringing harmony to Hua and Yi alike. May the imperial consorts and princes assist in upholding the imperial way. May all within the four seas and under heaven receive and propagate his sagely grace. May distant courts submit in reverence, and remote lands become tributary guests. May the years yield abundant harvests, and the people attain peace and joy.

May the imperial heir apparent be cultured, gentle, and kind, radiating benevolence and harmony. May his loyalty and filial piety shine in the southern quarter, his virtue admired by all; may his humility and reverence flourish in the eastern realm, his noble example inspiring the nine domains. May he forever assist in the sagely enterprise, ensuring the prosperity of the great treasure. Extending to all, whether manifest or hidden, high or low, may all ascend to the garden of benevolence and longevity, and together partake in the era of harmony and prosperity.

Above, may the radiant Celestial Worthy’s boundless grace be manifest; below, may it fulfill our humble servants’ sincerity in taking refuge.

Respectfully invoked.

First vow: May the Great Dao flow freely, and all under heaven embrace virtue.
Second vow: May all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.
Third vow: May the sorrowful souls of the nine nights attain liberation at once.

May the hosts of a hundred spirits and immortals gather here before the mystic altar. May our bodies radiate golden splendor, severing the roots of the womb’s bonds. May the seven mysteries be uplifted, and the hundred passages perfected for immortality. May the registers of death be erased, and our seats established in the mud-pill palace. May our names be recorded in the Eastern Flowery Realm, and our spirits ascend to the void’s mystery. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, conveying our supplications swiftly to the Celestial Worthy of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, before the Golden Portal and Jade Steps.

**Guardian Spirits Invocation**
Azure yang illumines the void, the sun’s radiance revolves in numinous splendor.
Divine tigers repel evil, flying celestials stream with ringing bells.
Crush treachery and annihilate trials—ten thousand demons bind their forms.
Ninefold subtleties turn the Dao’s course; eightfold majesties seize essences.
A thousand perfected audit the registers; the Three Primes scour and purify.
To the left, the Central Yellow roars; to the right, the Six Dings are spurred.
Seven revolutions, eight unions—revolving through the celestial canon.
Sacred transformations towering, the Three Ways proceed in harmony.
Auspicious clouds flow and spread, merging with the Yellow Court’s luminous scene.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
The Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao Lord, summons forth from this minister’s body:
The Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Envoys of Left and Right,
The Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Petal-Scattering Jade Maidens,
The Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, the Day-Officers of Incense—
Each thirty-two in number—emerge.
Emerging, they solemnly attire and open the gates of the Mystic Altar’s Heavenly Emperor Divine Lords,
Summoning the local earth gods and territorial true officials.
On this day, we offer prayers for the intent of supplication and grace at the Jade Portal,
Presenting the cinnabar scriptures.
May the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure’s wondrous light descend,
Flowing into our bodies, causing purple essence to flourish and the Jade Pass to brighten.
May the Five Elders assist our roots, the Ten Thousand Thearchs seize our true nature.
Our forms round as pearls reflecting light, riding the luminous chariot to the celestial court.
Golden splendor blazes resplendent, guiding qi to ascend to the Upper Clarity.
May our supplications swiftly reach the Celestial Worthy of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao,
The Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous,
Before the Golden Portal and Jade Steps of the Nine Celestial Thearchs’ Divine Palace.

**Proclaiming the Dharma Titles**
Disciple of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of the Upper Clarity,
Supreme Master of the Three Caverns,
Practitioner of the Great Yellow Register Fast for Disaster-Dispelling Rites,
This Mountain’s Master, This Thearch’s Perfected Minister [Name],
With utmost sincerity, jointly reverently addresses the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous,
The Supreme Boundless Great Dao Lord of the Most High Dao,
The Supreme August Thearch of the Golden Portal and Mysterious Origin,
The Most High Jade Emperor,
The Great Sage Perfected Hosts of the Ten Directions Who Have Attained the Dao,
The Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperor Lords,
The Jade Clarity Thearch,
The Jade Emperor Great Thearch,
The Eastern Flowery, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected,
The Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Portal, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace,
The Purple Tenuity Upper Palace’s Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord,
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
All divine officials and true numina of the Three Realms.

We, your ministers, have heard that the Dao’s efficacy is boundless,
Its dark compassion descending to succor.
It extends blessings and bestows fortune, aiding the state and delivering the people.
The Five Talismans proclaim the majesty of its command;
The Three Caverns expand the power of its protection.
It dispels disasters and resolves calamities, erases sins and prolongs life.
Through countless kalpas it endures; from ancient times to the present, all revere it.
Thus the dragon-script and phoenix-charms, the River Chart’s texts of pardon for transgressions;
The green registers and vermilion records, the Supreme Unity’s repentance rites for averting calamities.
Exerting utmost sincerity in the lower realms, we harmonize with the luminous responses of the Upper Clarity.
Only goodness is followed; every prayer is answered.
Moreover, in accordance with the imperial decree, how dare we not report above?

**The Emperor’s Green Petition**
To be solemnly proclaimed.
As stated in the petition, it is fitting to memorialize.
The Emperor, receiving Heaven’s mandate to spread transformation and embodying the Dao to govern the people,
Fears even a single being may suffer misfortune, desiring all directions to attain peace.
He widely opens the realm of longevity to embrace all living beings.
As [Official Title] is afflicted by baleful influences, we seek their dissolution.
We prepare fragrant flowers to perform rites, presenting dragon-brocade to convey our hearts.
Gazing reverently toward the Mysterious Pass, we earnestly pray for vast blessings.

**This dawn’s Dao-procession, the assembled dharma hosts,**
Offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.
We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating our heads to the earth,
Reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.
May this merit flow to our ancestral lineage and all the sagely hosts,
To the altars of soil and grain and the august numina.
May we receive luminous blessings to ascend and attain perfection, ascending to the Golden Portal;
May we manifest wondrous auspices to protect the state, firmly securing the jade chart below.
Riding simurghs and cranes in carefree wandering, may we endure as long as Heaven and Earth.

Thus we burn incense, from our return to the masters, the great sages, the host of perfected,
To the virtues of those who have attained the Dao and ascended into the formless,
Harmonizing and uniting with the Dao’s true nature.

**This dawn’s Dao-procession, the assembled dharma hosts,**
Offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.
We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating our heads to the earth,
Reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.
May this merit flow to the Emperor.
We humbly hope the eight seas remain vast and boundless, enduring with the phoenix-era;
The myriad peaks stand towering and majestic, as steadfast as the dragon’s dignity.
May his years equal the pine and cypress, his days as bright as the sun of Shun.
May the Empress, consorts, and concubines spread their virtuous ways across the ten thousand realms;
May the princes and heirs to the throne uphold their sagely virtues for a thousand ages.
May the hundred offices follow proper order, all officials govern with competence.

Now we therefore burn incense, devoting ourselves to the Great Sage Host of Masterly Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true, and who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness. Harmony unites with the true Dao.

At this pure dawn, performing the Dao-rites, we invite the assembly of dharma-practitioners to offer this three-pinch incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating our heads to the earth, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High. May this merit flow to the heavens above and the earth below, to the Three Realms and the ten directions.

May the qi of the Dao nourish and suffuse, illuminating the myriad spirits with peace. May the Mysterious Wind long nurture, and all beings dwell in tranquility. May the Nine Dark Realms cease their gloomy sorrows, and the Six Paths end the suffering of rebirth. May the hidden power of this official’s spiritual merit and the far-reaching grace of kindness pervade all. Calamities, misfortunes, and enmities shall be washed away by repentance and prayer; longevity and blessings shall be renewed through fasting and gratitude.

May the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and the six relations receive protection. May all beings who embrace life and receive transformation together bathe in the Mysterious Grace.

Now we therefore burn incense, devoting ourselves to the Great Sage Host of Masterly Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true, and who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness. Harmony unites with the true Dao.

We perform the rites, repent, and confess.

Three Invocations:
May the Dharma be taken as one’s wife,
And scriptures cherished like pearls and jade.
Holding precepts to restrain the six passions,
Mindful of the Dao to dispel desires.
Serene and pure, the upright qi abides;
Empty and still, the spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
And through all lives, great blessings are enjoyed.

Three Prostrations:
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

Reiterating the Dharma Titles:
Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital, Supreme Masters of the Three Caverns, conducting the Yellow Register Great Fast for Disaster Dispelling Rituals—your servant, the Perfected Lord of Such-and-Such Peak, So-and-So Emperor, humbly and respectfully reaffirms and presents this petition to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Boundless Great Dao and Host of Sages of Virtue in the Ten Directions; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Heavenly Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the High Ministers, High Chancellors, High Protectors, High Tutors; the Officials of the Four Offices, Five Emperors, Sun, and One Realm; and all the Venerable Spirits.

We, your servants, prostrate and hear:
The clear and turbid were planted and formed,
The round and square fixed in their places.
The divine work gives life and transforms,
Blowing through the myriad things without end.

The Daoist wind is drummed forth, the numinous moisture bathes all,
Perfected through wondrous transformation, governed by the sage.
Thus can the mechanisms of all under heaven be unified,
And the affairs of all under heaven be accomplished as one.
Matching the Two Modes in greatness, emerging from the myriad beings to occupy the honored place.
With merit unpossessed, they shine as brightly as sun and moon;
In magnifying the Dao through non-action, they endure as long as heaven and earth.
Moreover, with unified enfeoffment and the Six Harmonies as home,
Benevolent nurturance is surely equitable, and great iron knows no barriers.
The Emperor, in sincerity and care, governs by embodying the Dao.
He opens the courtyard of benevolence and longevity, weaving the transformation of Huaxu.
Yet now, as certain officials are beset by calamity and misfortune,
His celestial compassion is deeply stirred.
He issues virtuous decrees and reverently conducts the assembly of blessings,
Preparing the tenfold splendor of sincere offerings,
Unfurling the ritual canons of the Three Caverns.
Seated in the Hall of Audience, he meditates in profound stillness,
Gazing toward the Jade Void and bowing in reverence,
Hoping to rely on purity and cleanliness to achieve resonance and communion.

We, your servants, having long studied the luminous statutes and reverently followed the mysterious decree,
Have arrayed the altar and set forth the sacred texts, modeling earth and emulating heaven.
With the Emperor’s offerings—golden dragon-patterned silks, incense, flowers, oil, and candles—
We follow the standards of the Cavernous Mystery to perform the supreme and wondrous fast.
We ascend petitions to the Ten Heavens and pledge oaths to the Three Realms.
Humbly we pray that the host of sages of the Jade Purity and the boundless exalted ones
May look down with favor upon our earnest devotion and greatly extend their grace and forgiveness.
They shall command the Four Offices, Five Emperors, Northern Culmen, and Southern Palace
To receive the luminous edicts of the Four Poles and uphold the mandates of the Nine Dragons.
For these officials, within the celestial bureaus and earthly administrations,
Among the talismanic charts and registers of destiny,
May they untangle grievances, harmonize debts and disputes,
Absolve transgressions, and wash away faults.
May they dispel the disasters of stellar conjunctions and the misfortunes of inauspicious years,
Eradicating the accumulated sins of past lives without measure.
Through this repentance and prayer, may all be cleansed and dissolved,
So that the Nine Ancestral Realms receive blessings and the entire clan be graced with honor.
May their years be long and distant, their ranks and emoluments ever-increasing.
May a thousand calamities cease and ten thousand virtues be perfected.
Thus shall the transforming grace of the Heavenly Worthy be manifest,
And the earnest wishes of the sagely sovereign be fulfilled.

We further beseech that the imperial destiny be ever-prosperous,
The sagely lifespan prolonged and vast.
May all within the realm universally partake of the fruits of the Dao.
May the Two Modes shine in peace, the Three Radiances gleam in splendor.
May the Nine Grains flourish in abundance, the Five Armies sheathe their weapons.
May dragon spirits stand guard, and pestilence be kept at bay.
May the sighs of the suffering cease, and the fields resound with songs of joy.
May all beings, winged or crawling, fulfill their natures,
And all things, moving or still, flourish in glory.
May the Nine Nights reveal their light, and the Three Paths close their gates.
May the boundless responses of the Great Dao be witnessed,
And the sagely and enlightened prayers be answered.
May all, near and far, ascend the shore of blessings.
Above, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be made clear;
Below, may the sincerity of our devotion be matched.
Respectfully we present this petition for your hearing.

We now raise our thoughts:
First thought: For the Dao, the Four Great Elements unite in virtue.
May the seven generations of parents be freed from suffering and sorrow,
Ascend to the heavenly halls, and enjoy natural sustenance.

Second thought: For the Emperor and lords of the realm,
May the Daoist transformation flourish,
The schools thrive in abundance, and the imperial teachings expand in grandeur.
May their majesty and decorum be revered by all under heaven.
May the people proclaim great peace, and the four barbarians submit in awe.
May evil and malevolence vanish of themselves, and sages and worthies arise daily.

Third thought: For the Dharma Masters,
May their merit and virtue be greatly established,
Their teachings enlightened and far-reaching,
And all attain the flight of immortality.

Fourth thought: For fellow students of the Dao,
May they swiftly attain the immortal way and mutually enlighten one another.

Fifth thought: For the harmony of the nine relations,
May they esteem virtue and renounce wealth,
Their conduct a model for all things.

Sixth thought: For self-denial,
May alms be given to Daoist priests and the hungry and cold.
May all people under heaven find their rightful place.

Seventh thought: For the crawling and creeping, all sentient beings,
May all be perfected and accomplished.

Eighth thought: For the absolution of past-life and present sins,
May merits be established to atone for transgressions.

Ninth thought: For the prosperity of family and state,
May ancestral temples be maintained and worthy talents arise in every generation.

Tenth thought: For the reverence of scriptural masters,
May none grow lax or unequal in their devotion.
With a single mind and boundless compassion,
May they attain the rank of immortals,
Ascend to heaven in broad daylight,
And pay homage to the Most High.
Seeking to become perfected beings,
Riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages,
In harmony with the Dao, they shall merge with the true.

May the Fragrant Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attending Fragrant Spirit-Officials cause this place where I present my memorial to spontaneously yield golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here, assembling before the alchemical furnace. May my body radiate golden splendor, severing the roots of the womb’s bonds. May the Seven Mysteries be uprooted, and the hundred passages be readied for immortality. May the register of death be erased, and may I sit in tranquil repose within the Mud-Pill Palace. May the Eastern Flowery Realm record my name, and may my spirit ascend to the Void Mystery.

May the jade maidens and jade youths of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, conveying the words I have just uttered swiftly to the presence of the Most High, the Boundless Dao—formless and nameless, the Void and Spontaneous—before the Golden Portal and Jade Throne of the Nine Celestial Thearchs of the Divine Empyrean.

*Exiting the chamber*
Here ends the thirteenth scroll of the *Ritual of the Yellow Register Fast*.
Beginning the fourteenth scroll of the *Ritual of the Yellow Register Fast*, compiled by Tang Master of Vast Accomplishment, Du Guangting.
By special decree, for the sake of this subordinate to dispel calamities and perform the Dao-midway rites.

*Entering the chamber*
Each pays homage to the master, contemplating as prescribed.
*Guardian Spirits*
Cinnabar numen, vermilion fire, flaming auroras, and surging winds. The crimson wheel turns with unyielding force,

Swift as spirit in response, tireless across all directions.
Cinnabar sincerity ascends unobstructed, undivided by high or low;
Mysterious grace descends in full, unspared to great or small.
Moreover, matched with Heaven’s sagely mandate, the Dao’s governance extends like trailing robes.
Virtue/power penetrates the divine luminaries, merit rivals Creation’s work.
Extending kindness and bestowing favors, level as sweet dew and rain;
Issuing commands and displaying might, resounding with thunder’s force.
With racing heart and focused intent, one must align with Heaven’s blessing.
As this official treads through calamity and obscurity, he humbly seeks dissolution and release.
In profound reverence for the Mysterious Ultimate, he bows his head to the Pure Capital.
Thus unfolds the rites of fasting and proclamation, awaiting the fulfillment of felicitous omens.
Incense and flowers, dragon-hued radiance—all prepared according to the luminous statutes.
Petitions are arrayed, sealed words ready for submission.
Reverently heeding the enlightened decree, how dare he not make this known above?

*The Emperor’s Blue Petition*
Duly proclaimed as written, the sincere prayer is borne aloft.

We, your servants, with the ritual offerings entrusted by the Emperor, reverently establish the altar.
Sun domains and moon gates—positions set to mirror the Ten Flowers;
Dragon scripts and phoenix seals—Heavenly Books of the Eight Assemblies displayed.
Thus may baleful vapors be swept away, obstructions dispelled.
Auspicious blessings widely extended, to still the darkness of ignorance.

*At this midpoint of the Dao-procession*
The ritual assembly is summoned, and the first pinch of incense is offered.
May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer sustenance to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.
We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrate in full submission, gazing upward to the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May this merit flow to the august dignity of the altars of state, the ancestral temples, and the sagely forebears.
Ascending to the Jade Gates of Perfection, shedding their forms in the Jasper Palaces.
Harnessing eight phoenixes upon cloud thoroughfares, driving six dragons along stellar paths.
Gazing up to the myriad sages, bowing down to the thousand perfected.
Bestowing vast blessings upon divine descendants, inaugurating distant ages for the jeweled throne.

*Now, burning incense*
We take refuge in the Great Sagely Host of Masters, the Perfected and Virtuous Ones,
Who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless.
Harmonized with the Dao, merged with the True.

*At this midpoint of the Dao-procession*
The ritual assembly is summoned, and the second pinch of incense is offered.
May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer sustenance to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.
We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrate in full submission, gazing upward to the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May this merit flow to the Emperor.
We humbly pray that his sagacity surpass that of Xuanyuan and the radiant Fuxi,
That through the sprouting of grasses upon the palace steps, the cycles of light and dark be revealed;
That the divine ram guard the screen, silently expelling the wicked and treacherous.
May the mountain of fortune rise ever higher, the peak of longevity grow ever steeper.
For the Empress, consorts, and palace ladies—may the six palaces proclaim their assisting virtue;
For the Crown Prince and the various princes—may ancestral protection manifest their enduring prosperity.
May the court abound with talent, the countryside know no fugitives.
Envoys from distant lands, like bees swarming peaks or snails tracing trails, ascend by ladder and boat to offer tribute;
Divine beasts and celestial incense-bearers take flight to grace the court.
May the myriad realms share a single script, the nine regions submit to transformation.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense and take refuge in the Master, the Venerable Assembly, and the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the true Dao.

On this day, at the midpoint of the ritual, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this triple-pinched incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, ascending directly to make offering to the Supreme Perfected Master.

We prostrate ourselves, body and life, touching our heads to the earth, and take refuge in the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow forth to [Name of Official], extending his salary and years, calming misfortune and decline.

In the Southern Palace, the vermilion register shall inscribe his name anew; in the Northern Bureau, the black writ shall erase all records of transgression. The Nine Mysteries shall open the path to deliverance, and the fragrance of manifold blessings shall suffuse him.

Extending to the three realms—both hidden and manifest—and the ten directions, vast and boundless, may the Dao’s influence spread afar, and the power of the Sages universally bestow grace. May all be freed from the brevity of life’s span and fully attain the joy of longevity.

May the gates of the Yellow Springs shine bright, the dark prisons fall silent, and all who receive this blessed favor ascend to the realm of the Dao.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense and take refuge in the Master, the Venerable Assembly, and the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the true Dao.

The rite is complete; we repent.

Three Invocations, Three Bows

Prosperous is the realm, flourishing the state;
Majestic the scriptures, the Dao’s teachings rise.
Heaven and humankind share one aspiration,
In misty vastness, they enter the Great Vehicle.
From the heart, the field of blessings is established,
The Wheel of Dharma ascends, boundless and grand.
Seven generations ascend to celestial halls,
While this body soars in the light of day.

We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Reiterating the Dharma Titles:
Disciple of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mystic Capital, Supreme Master of the Three Caverns,
Your servant [Name] respectfully invokes once more the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning;
The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;
The Supreme Lord Lao;
The hosts of sagely and virtuous beings of the Boundless Dao and Power in the ten directions;
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
The Heavenly Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
The High Ministers, High Chancellors, High Protectors, High Tutors;
The Four Directors and Five Emperors;
All the divine officials and revered spirits of the Three Realms.

We, your servants, have heard that the Dao’s workings unfold,
And the true scriptures spread their transforming influence.
The luminous precepts and wondrous teachings
Awaken those in the heavens and the human realm;
The sacred registers and marvelous texts
Are proclaimed to those in darkness and stagnation.
Thus, the Three Vehicles and Three Caverns
Guide the lost and grieving to return;
The dragon scripts and phoenix writings
Assist the state and bring forth blessings.
With profound sincerity and responsive resonance,
The empty chamber connects to the true.
All rests in utmost devotion,
To honor and receive divine grace.

Reverently considering the Great Dao,
It silently aids the Emperor’s work.
The Emperor, in his official capacity, encounters obscurity and adversity,
Yet his compassionate concern runs deep.
To dispel and resolve these, he seeks to preserve purity and peace.
Offering dragon jades, incense, flowers, and patterned silks as ritual tokens,
He establishes a fast and erects an altar.
We, your servants, undeservingly hold office in the Mystic Bureau,
And reverently receive the enlightened command.
Following the ritual codes and forms,
We earnestly invoke the true spirits.
Burning incense and lighting lamps,
We illuminate the darkest nights.
Above, they shine upon the halls of blessings;
Below, they open the courts of the unseen and benighted.
For [Name], we repent and offer gratitude for the living and the dead,
Reconciling karmic adversaries.
For so many days and nights,
We perform the Dao and recite the scriptures.
We repent for the nine generations and seven lineages,
For past lives and the present existence.
For transgressions in the unseen and manifest realms,
For faults and flaws in life and death.
For malevolent karmic ties and the roots of sin,
For past debts and ancient enmities.
For the nine palaces and eight trigrams,
For the three destinies and five phases.
For the dark and bright stars,
For boundless calamities and misfortunes.
Through this prayer and repentance,
We beseech their complete eradication.
May the ancestral spirits ascend,
And accumulated faults be pardoned.
May misfortune dissolve with repentance,
And fortune follow wishes to arrive.
May a hundred blessings suffuse,
And a thousand disasters be cleansed.
May official emoluments and blessings be renewed,
And years of life extended.
Ever serving the sagely court,
Above, repaying the Emperor’s grace;
Below, may the two forces maintain their purity,
And the three luminaries radiate splendor.
May the five planets follow their courses,
And the eight winds harmonize.
May the precious chart stand firm,
And the sagely reign endure.
Surpassing the ways of emperors and kings,
Pacifying the nine regions and purifying the myriad states.
May the six palaces and hundred offices
Proclaim virtue within and beyond.
May the Crown Prince and the various princes
Assist with wisdom and sagacity.
May the years be free of pestilence,
And the people sing in praise.
May the world know great peace,
And all beings fulfill their nature.
In the depths of the darkest nights,
Whether moving or still, flying or sinking,
May all share in the merit of this repentance and gratitude,
And together awaken to the Dao of mystic communion.
Above, may the Heavenly Venerable’s vast grace of deliverance be manifest;
Below, may our repentance and gratitude be sincere.
Respectfully, we make this invocation known.

In the court of the Nine Celestial Thearchs of Divine Empyrean.

**Strike the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

The Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao Lord,
Summons forth from within this minister’s body:
The Three-and-Five Merit Scribes,
The Attendant Officials of Left and Right,
The Incense-Bearing Golden Lads,
The Petition-Conveying, Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,
The Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman-Officers,
The Incense-Officers of the Day—
Each in their thirty-two ranks, emerge.
As they depart, arrayed in solemn vestments,
They unlock the gates of the Mystic Altar’s Heavenly Thearchs,
And summon the local earth gods, territorial spirits,
And true officials of this realm.
On this day, in service of the intent to beseech grace at the Jade Threshold,
We present our prostrations before the Cinnabar Writs.
May the numinous light of the Jade Purity’s Dao-*qi* and Numinous Treasure
Descend and flow into our bodies,
That purple essence may flourish in abundance,
And the Jade Pass be opened and illumined.
May the Five Elders fortify our roots,
The Ten Thousand Thearchs guard our true nature.
Our bodies, like pearls, reflect the round,
Riding the light as we mount the celestial court.
Golden radiance blazes resplendent,
As we harness the *qi* to ascend to the Upper Clarity.
May the words we have uttered
Swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme,
The Boundless Dao of the Formless and Nameless,
The Void and Spontaneous,
Before the Jade Threshold of the Golden Portals,
In the court of the Nine Celestial Thearchs of Divine Empyrean.

**Each Declare Their Dharma Rank**

We, disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Supreme Clarity’s Mystic Capital and Grand Grotto,
Supreme Masters of the Three Caverns,
Conducting the great *Yellow Register Fast* for disaster-dispelling rites,
The Master of [such-and-such] Peak, the Perfected of [such-and-such] Thearch, your ministers [Names],
With one heart, reverently address the
Void and Spontaneous Primal Beginning Heavenly Worthy,
The Boundless Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord,
The Supreme Great Dao, the Golden Portals Mysterious Origin Heavenly Thearch, the Great Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao,
The Jade Thearch of the August Heaven,
The Ten Directions’ Attained Great Sage Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters,
The Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs,
The Jade Clarity Thearch,
The Jade Emperor and Great Emperor,
The Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern True, and Mystic Capital’s Jade Capital, Golden Portals, Seven Treasures, and Mystic Terrace,
The officials and retinues of the Three Realms,
And all true numina.

We, your ministers, by long-standing karmic affinity,
Have been blessed to encounter the mysterious transformation.
The Three Caverns spread the teachings of vast compassion,
Bestowing universal blessings upon humans and heavens.

The Four Luminaries unfold the rites of vast salvation,
Manifesting blessings for state and realm.
Thus do jade scriptures expound profound mysteries,
And golden tablets enumerate merits.
Where there is devotion, there is response;
Where there is prayer, there is answer.
Moreover, this matter bears the Mandate of the Thearch,
And the thoughts of the imperial heart.
The grace between sovereign and subject is profound,
The sincerity for blessings and protection is earnest.
Therefore, we dare to consult the canons of the Cavernous Mystery,
Follow the ritual texts of the Numinous Treasure,
Lead the assembly in the Dharma current,
And diligently perform the fast and vigil.
Reverently upholding the imperial decree,
We dare not but make this known above.

The Emperor’s blue-green memorial shall now be respectfully proclaimed.
As the words declare, so shall the matter be reported.

The Emperor, by virtue of his Five Phases’ waxing and waning,
Faces a time of obstruction and adversity;
The Three Destiny’s revolutions bear the principle of rise and decline.
Encountering this inauspicious conjunction,
His sagely compassion is deeply moved.
With the incense and flowers of the inner treasury,
And the rites and ranks of the Supreme Clarity,
He establishes the fast to invoke blessings,
Reverently opening the altar precincts.
Pledging his heart with the brocade of the dragon’s essence,
And conveying his entreaty with the orchid’s burning stalk.
May the eight simurghs and ten cranes hasten to attend,
And the phoenix chimes and dragon smoke ascend unhurriedly on high.

At this hour of the setting sun, as the Dao is practiced,
The Dharma assembly now offers the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke rise to the heavens,
Directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme, Perfect, and True Treasure of the Dao.

We, your ministers, surrender body and life,
Prostrate ourselves in full submission,
And look up in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones.
May these merits flow to the ancestral temples and altars of the sagely dynasty,
To the numinous spirits of the soil and grain,
To the tranquil vastness of the Great Void,
And the numinous palaces of cinnabar.
May feathered banners and jade canopies attend the myriad sages in audience at the Origin;
May jade leaves and golden branches transcend a thousand ages to receive blessings.
May the imperial destiny flourish like the Zhou,
And the realm expand like the lands of Yao.
May the eight directions know peace,
And all beings enjoy perpetual prosperity.

Thus do we now burn incense,
Taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of Venerable Masters,
In the virtue of the Perfected and True,
Who, having attained the Dao,
Ascend into the formless,
Harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

At this hour of the setting sun, as the Dao is practiced,
The Dharma assembly now offers the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke rise to the heavens,
Directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme, Perfect, and True Treasure of the Scriptures.

We, your ministers, surrender body and life,
Prostrate ourselves in full submission,
And look up in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones.
May these merits flow to the Emperor.
We humbly pray that the numinous talismans of the Primordial One be activated,
And the might of the Jade Dipper assembled;
That the cinnabar registers and precious charts summon the hosts of the Jasper Palace.
May the imperial destiny be exalted,
And the sagely years prolonged,
Abiding in peace with the Pole Star,
Shining in radiance with the sun’s splendor.

May the Empress, arrayed beside the Tortoise Terrace,
Enjoy the longevity of the crane.
May the Crown Prince and the various princes,
Embrace great felicity and serve the sagely;
May the six palaces and hundred officials,
Uphold the imperial pole and receive glory.
May all realms know well-being,
And the entire heavens share in blessings.

Thus do we now burn incense,
Taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of Venerable Masters,
In the virtue of the Perfected and True,
Who, having attained the Dao,
Ascend into the formless,
Harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

At this hour of the setting sun, as the Dao is practiced,
The Dharma assembly now offers the third pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke rise to the heavens,
Directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme, Perfect, and True Treasure of the Masters.

We, your ministers, surrender body and life,
Prostrate ourselves in full submission,
And look up in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones.
May these merits flow to the Ten Poles and Nine Netherworlds,
To all heavens and all earths.
Where the mysterious wind blows,
Where the Dao’s transformation extends,
May the hidden and manifest alike flourish,
And humans and heavens share in blessings.

May the official’s nine ancestors and seven generations,
Ride the grace of goodness to ascend as Perfected;
May his outer kin and inner relatives,
Receive the divine efficacy and align with the Dao.
May accumulated transgressions be dissolved,
And all calamities dispelled.
May his years and emoluments be long,
And blessings and goodness gather in abundance.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masters, in their Perfect and True virtue. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into the formless. In harmony, we unite with the True Dao.

**Ritual of the Four Directions**
**Confession**
**Threefold Invocation**

The Great Dao abides in the Mysterious Void,
All thoughts find resonance without fail.
Refining the body to enter the Immortal Real,
We attain the adamantine form.
Transcending the Three Realms’ trials,
The Five Pains of hell are dissolved.
All returns to the Supreme Scriptures;
In silent devotion, we bow in reverence.

**Threefold Prostration**
We, your ministers, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao.
We, your ministers, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your ministers, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Reaffirmation of Dharma Titles**
We, your ministers, humbly reaffirm our address to the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Venerable and Perfect Host of the Boundless Dao and Virtue in the Ten Directions; the Celestial Thearchs and Heavenly Emperors; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Heavenly Master and Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Jade Assistants and High Ministers; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all divine officials and numinous spirits of the Three Realms.

We, your ministers, prostrate ourselves and declare:
The transformations of the Dao are subtle and profound, exalted above the Nine Purities;
Its divine efficacy shines forth, flowing through the Eight Extremities.
Like echo and shadow, they correspond;
Through resonance and response, all are answered.
When mortal sentiments ascend, the mysterious blessings must flow.
How much more when issuing from the imperial heart,
Manifest in the sovereign’s thoughts?
We await the blessings that follow the moment,
To manifest the true resonance of the divine.
The Host of the Great Dao and Venerable Ones
Will surely bestow their gracious favor.

The Emperor, through this official, has received the dual images of spirit and matter,
And coalesced the qi of the Three Powers.
Yin and yang differ in ascent and descent;
Fortune and misfortune follow the principles of change.
Facing this time of adversity,
He commands with solemn urgency.
Thus, we are bidden to present our utmost sincerity,
To offer this fast and make our supplication.
The blue memorial ascends to the throne,
And the heavens respond with their protective benevolence;
The vermilion petition rises to be heard,
And the myriad sages descend with their radiant blessings.
We command the Four Directors and Five Emperors,
And summon the Three Realms and Ten Directions.
Open the Upper Palace of Purple Yang,
And descend the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate.

For this official, dissolve past karmic debts and deep transgressions,
Erase the records of sin and guilt,
And remove the registers of suffering and delay.
Bestow the blessing of longevity,
And reverse the decree of brevity.
The Three Lifespans and Five Phases,
The celestial patterns and earthly records—
All calamities and misfortunes,
Are hereby dispelled.
May his emoluments be renewed,
And his years and lifespan increased.
May his spirit and qi flourish,
And all decline and fault be eradicated.
May his nine ancestors and seven generations
Ascend to heaven and receive blessings.

Above, may the Heavenly Origin shine brightly,
And the earthly foundation remain secure.
May the Three Luminaries be resplendent as jade and pearls,
And the Eight Directions be free of malevolent winds and pestilent qi.
May the sacred chart stand firm,
And the sage’s longevity be vast.
May the Generals of the Square Eyes hurl their fire bells to sweep away mists and vapors;
May the Long-Browed Censors wield their purple brushes to record auspicious omens.
May the Empress and imperial consorts
Ever receive radiant protection;
May the princes and crown princes
Together tread upon extraordinary blessings.
May the enlightened court abound with upright ministers,
And the frontier regions know no beacon fires of war.
May the Jade Candle be harmonious,
And the Jade Storehouses overflow.
May the myriad people rejoice in well-being,
And the realm be tranquil and serene.

Extending to the lords of yin and yang,
The dragon spirits of rivers and mountains—
May they assist in the flourishing age,
And manifest the transformations of the Dao.
The Three Paths and Nine Nights,
The Six Realms of diverse destinies—
May all together receive the merit of this fast,
And attain the shore of blessings.

May the great compassion of the Heavenly Venerable
Fully respond to the Emperor’s reverent devotion.

**Supplication**
We humbly present our address.

**Vows**
First, may Heaven and Earth be bright and pure.
Second, may the cosmic signs be clear and mysterious.
Third, may the sagely ruler enjoy myriad years.
Fourth, may his transformative influence reach the Eight Boundaries.
Fifth, may sweet dew descend from heaven.
Sixth, may the earth emit auspicious vapors.
Seventh, may the four seasons follow their proper course.
Eighth, may the myriad beings thrive in wholeness.
Ninth, may families abound in filial piety and fraternal duty.
Tenth, may the state flourish with talent and virtue.
Eleventh, may the merit of this fast spread widely.
Twelfth, may auspicious signs daily increase.

**Replenishing the Censer**
Incense Officials, Envoys, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all Attending Numinous Officials—
At this place where we face the Origin,
May golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise.
May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones
Gather here before the censer in the cavernous chamber.
May our bodies radiate golden splendor,
Severing the roots of the womb’s bonds,
Uplifting the seven generations,
And preparing the hundred passages for immortality.
May the registers of death be dissolved,
And the Mud Pill Palace be seated in darkness.
May the Eastern Florescence record our names,
And the luminous tally ascend to the Mysterious Void.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the Ten Directions
Receive the incense smoke,
And swiftly convey our supplications
To the Celestial Venerable of the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao,
Before the Throne of the Formless and Nameless,
The Spontaneous and Natural,
In the Golden Towers and Jade Palaces,
In the presence of the Nine Celestial Thearchs of the Divine Empyrean.

Each pays homage to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

**Guardian Spirits**
Azure radiance illumines the void, the sun’s essence revolves in numinous splendor.
Divine tigers repel evil, flying immortals ring celestial bells.
Rebellious spirits are crushed, myriad demons bound in submission.
Ninefold subtle Dao turns back, eightfold might seizes their essence.
A thousand perfected ones review the records, the Three Primes purge all defilement.
To the left, the Central Yellow is invoked; to the right, the Six Dings are summoned.
Seven cycles, eight unions—revolving through the celestial scriptures.
The sagely transformation towers sublime, the Three Ways flow in harmony.
Auspicious clouds spread forth, merging with the luminous Yellow Court.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

O Most Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Dao:
Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right attendant messengers, the incense-bearing Golden Lads, the word-transmitting and flower-scattering Jade Maidens, and the thirty-two Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs on duty this day. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to open the gates of the Mysterious Altar’s Celestial Thearchs. Let them swiftly summon the local earth deities and territorial true officials to ascend and open the gates.

This servant now humbly offers this morning’s Daoist observances for the petitioner’s intent, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend, flowing into our bodies. May the Mysterious Altar be purified, inner and outer realms perfected as true, the heavens freed from impurity, and the earth cleansed of demonic dust. Let the chiming of jade resound, the Ten Directions grow solemn and clear. May the myriad demons not intrude, and our sincere prayers ascend unobstructed. Let this servant’s supplications swiftly reach the imperial throne of the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao, the Most Perfect Jade Thearch of the August Heaven.

**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**

With unified sincerity, we, disciples of the Mysterious Capital, humbly petition the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Spontaneous and Natural, the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the August Thearch of the Golden Towers and Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Emperor, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the perfected and sagely hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Worthies who respond to conditions and deliver from suffering, the thirty-six Celestial Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Jade Thearch and Supreme Thearch, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Towers, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Illuminated August Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Realm, and all responsive numina of the Three Realms.

We prostrate ourselves, having heard that the Perfect Dao extends its compassion, its mysterious efficacy aiding all beings. It unfolds its luminous transformation, shielding and succoring both the manifest and the hidden.

Thus do the flying celestial transcendents receive the teachings of the Jade Coffer’s Illuminated Perfected; the youths of supreme wisdom entreat the rites of the Jade Altar’s Three Registers. Proclaiming the Dharma’s resonance, they open deliverance for all ranks. Their benevolence encompasses state and household, their grace suffuses past and present.

The Emperor, mindful of meritorious worthies, pities the suffering of the dark and silent realms. The [deceased] official, grieving beyond the gates of the nether springs, cherishes remembrance in the hidden earth. We, in reverent cultivation of supreme merit, array the altar precincts, hoping to invoke the compassion of the Most Sagely and relieve the torments of the underworld’s barriers. Moreover, in obedience to the imperial edict, how dare we not make this known above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the petition states, it is fitting to submit this plea.

We, your servants, reverently follow the wondrous decrees of the Nine Heavens and the scriptures of the Three Registers. Modeling our rites upon the patterns of Heaven and Earth, we present the liturgy of repentance and supplication. Above, we reach the Three Realms; below, we extend to the Nine Netherworlds. We burn incense and kindle lamps, recite scriptures and circumambulate the Dao. Silver braziers scatter radiance, hoping to illumine the endless night’s gloom; immortal hymns flow in melody, awaiting the descent of blessings from Heaven.

**This morning’s ritual procession now begins.**
The Dharma assembly, having invoked the first pinch of incense, declares:
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Dao-Treasure.

We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits flow to the august spirits of the altars of state, the ancestral line of sagely forebears, that they may ascend to the ranks of the Perfected and wander in the gardens of felicity. May they protect and bless the imperial domain, prolonging its reign for distant ages. May Heaven and Earth endure together, seas and mountains ever at peace.

Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Host of Perfected Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.

**This morning’s ritual procession now begins.**
The Dharma assembly, having invoked the second pinch of incense, declares:
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Scripture-Treasure.

We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits flow to the Emperor. We humbly pray that the azure waves of the vast sea may compare to his sagely longevity without end; that the myriad peaks and lands may stand firm with the imperial enterprise. May the empress, consorts, and attendants ever enjoy auspicious blessings; may the crown prince and princes perpetually renew their felicitous destiny. May civil ministers and military officers, all officials within and without, unite in loyal devotion, fostering a reign of benevolence, longevity, harmony, and prosperity. May the celestial element be serene and bright, the terrestrial order tranquil and secure. May grain harvests ever be abundant, weapons forever stilled. May blessings extend to all quarters, universally reaching all beings. Wherever the power of the Dao prevails, may the exalted and the lowly alike know peace.

Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Host of Perfected Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.

**This morning’s ritual procession now begins.**
The Dharma assembly, having invoked the third pinch of incense, declares:
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Master-Treasure.

We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits flow to the [deceased] official in the nether realms at this very moment. We humbly pray that the merit of this fast may ascend above, and the power of the Sagely One descend below. May the jade coffer’s sacred texts be opened, the Nine Dragons’ talismanic decrees be issued. May his numinous consciousness transcend and ascend directly to the Southern Palace. Passing through the courtyard of fire, may he refine and purge all impurities; entering the hall of luminous rosy clouds, may he don the radiant vestments of yang’s splendor. May he be elevated to the blessed realms, his name stricken from the ghostly registers. May the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages be transformed and reborn in Heaven; may the five clans and six relations receive blessings and protection. May grievances be cleansed, debts and disputes resolved. May the six destinies and three paths all partake of boundless fortune.

Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Host of Perfected Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.

**Completing the Rites**
**Confession**

**Threefold Invocation**
May the Dharma be cherished as a wife,
the scriptures loved as pearls and jade.
Holding fast to precepts to restrain the six passions,
mindful of the Dao to dispel all desires.
In purity, the upright qi abides;
in serenity, the spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and guard,
life after life receiving boundless fortune.

**Threefold Prostration**
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
paying homage to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
paying homage to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
paying homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Reaffirming Dharma Ranks**
We, your disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Capital, humbly reaffirm our devotion and reverently address:
the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin;
the Supreme Great Dao Lord;
the Supreme Lord Lao;
the Ten Directions’ Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerables;
the Heavenly Venerable Who Responds to Conditions and Delivers from Suffering;
the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
the Heavenly Master Lord, Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;
the High Ministers and Prime Ministers;
the Four Offices and Five Emperors;
and all responsive and efficacious numinous beings within and beyond the Three Realms.

We, your servants, have heard that:
the two qi mold and refine,
the Five Phases engender and transform.
Yin and yang interdepend and alternate,
good and evil shift and transmute.

Within the snares of the worldly net, amid the mechanisms of transformation—
the six passions stir and disturb,
the three karmas entangle and constrain.
Sinking and drifting, adrift and submerged,
such has been the unceasing plight from ancient times to the present.

Unless one is endowed with the qi of the Dao from birth,
or heaven-bestowed with immortal talent,
one cannot shatter the chariot of misfortune by ascending the ranks of blessings,
nor traverse the cloud-lined thoroughfare to transcend the earthly realm.
In this fleeting, floating world,
who can escape the wheel of rebirth?

This official, since his birth into this life and through countless kalpas past,
has accumulated transgressions,
his sins amassing like a string of beads.

As a military officer, he may have drilled troops and commanded armies,
punished the wicked and suppressed rebels,
or in the midst of mowing down and eradicating,
found jade and stone indistinguishable.
Though his service to the times may have been tied to establishing merit,
his reliance on killing and his pursuit of victory
have inevitably incurred guilt.

Moreover, in the course of feasts and rewards,
there must be slaughter and roasting.
In enforcing the laws to punish the wicked,
there must be the execution of penal codes.
Thus, in cases of accidental or mistaken killing,
transgressions and violations are unavoidable.

Or when soldiers march through camps and fortifications,
encroaching upon and desecrating ancient tombs,
offending and provoking dragon spirits,
digging and excavating hills and plains,
defiling and polluting springs and streams,
trampling sacred lands,
and defiling numinous traces—
these acts may stem from unresolved past debts
or unredressed former grievances.

Or when, in the course of official duties,
he has wielded authority with personal bias,
his judgments in life bearing the stain of guilt,
and in death facing karmic retribution—
in the dark, hidden prisons of the underworld,
there is no means of repentance or redemption.

As a civil official, when administering affairs,
he may have acted willfully and indulged his inclinations,
weighing punishments and discerning cases
without regard for compassion or mercy,
enforcing the law and upholding regulations
without thought of pardon or leniency.
In matters of granting or withholding, encouraging or discouraging,
he may have erred in balancing severity and leniency.
In levying and collecting taxes,
he may have harmed through harshness and urgency,
provoking the resentment of people and the grievance of all things.
These offenses, once firmly established,
may stem from past debts or former grievances,
or from defying heaven and betraying earth,
yet he has never offered repentance or atonement.
Accumulated in the courts of the underworld,
since the time of his death,
karmic retribution has befallen him,
with no means of deliverance or redemption.

The Emperor, mindful of his past merits
and grieving for his journey to the netherworld,
has examined the standards of the Purple Yang,
and unfolded the statutes of repentance and deliverance.
He has solemnly established the magnificent altar,
and reverently implored the boundless grace of the heavens.

We humbly beseech the host of saints and sages of the myriad heavens,
and the Three Supreme Venerables,
to turn their limitless mercy
and bestow the great compassion of their grace.
May they command the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,
the Five Emperors and Four Offices,
the Thirty-Six Prisons of Mount Tai and Fengdu,
to reconcile grievances and dissolve karmic retribution,
to erase and cast away the records of sins.
By the edict of great pardon,
may he be released from the depths of darkness,
receive transformation in the Southern Palace,
and be born upon the path of blessings.
May nine generations and seven lineages
together partake in this radiant protection.

May all beings in the Three Paths and Six Realms,
of every rank and kind,
whether moving or still, flying or submerged,
ascend to the shore of blessings.
May the Three Luminaries display auspicious signs,
and the Four Seasons attain perfect harmony.
May the sacred lifespan be long and enduring,
and the nation’s fortune prosperous and eternal.
May weapons be laid to rest,
and plagues and poisons vanish.
May the hundred grains ever flourish,
and all under heaven enjoy peace and prosperity.

Thus, the great compassion of the Most High Heavenly Venerable
shall be manifest above,
and the sincerity of our devotion in seeking refuge
shall be fulfilled below.

We reverently present this petition for your hearing.

**Invocation of Intentions**

First intention: For the four great elements of the Dao,
and the host of the retreat’s virtuous patrons—

May all people under heaven
each find their rightful place.

all sentient beings—

and this life’s karmic retribution—
may merits be established to compensate for transgressions.

may the ancestral temple be maintained,
and worthy talents be born in every generation.

Tenth intention: For the reverence of scripture masters—
may they never falter in diligence,
and with a mind of perfect equality,

and attain transcendence as immortals.
May they ascend to heaven in broad daylight,
and pay homage to the Most High.
May they forever become perfected beings,
riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages,
in harmony and union with the true Dao.

**Replenishing the Crucible**

Fragrant Office Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Fragrance Spirits—may they cause this place of my audience with the Primordial to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and jade blossoms. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. May I, in learning the Dao, attain the Dao; in learning immortality, attain immortality. May the patron of this retreat receive blessings, and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, attending the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly convey all that I have just petitioned directly to the Most High, the Boundless Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate before the Celestial Throne.

**Guardian Spirits**
Cinnabar numina, vermilion flames—
radiant clouds ignite the winds.
The crimson wheel turns with刚 force,
celestial light surging through the eight directions.
Its might bursts forth, encompassing all,
transforming myriad realms.
Molten gold scatters, demons vanish without trace.
Evil is dispelled, malevolence shattered—
illuminating the primal work.
Golden talismans summon and command,
treading clouds, spurring dragons.
Songs of celebration resound,
flowers scatter across the vast heavens.
Spirits transmute in hidden motion,
the four extremities secure and prosperous.
Prostrate before the Celestial Throne,
none dare be irreverent.

*Strike the Dharma Drum twenty-four times*

The Most High Lord of the Dao of the Three Heavens, the Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin—
summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Golden Youths Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Transmitting Words, and the Fragrance Officials of the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans and Direct Days—thirty-two each—to emerge.
Let them, in solemn array, report to the Divine Lords of the Mysterious Altar of the Celestial Emperor, and urgently command the local earth deities and true officials of this realm to ascend and make their report.

I now, on behalf of the intent of this rite, perform the audience with the Primordial. May I beseech the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure to descend, flowing into our bodies, thereby rendering the Mysterious Altar pure and both inner and outer realms perfected as true. May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth purged of demonic dust. May the jade chimes resound, the ten directions solemn and clear. May the myriad demons not intrude, and our sincerity ascend unobstructed. May all that I have petitioned swiftly reach the Celestial Throne of the Most High, the Boundless Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate.

*Each declares their Dharma rank*

Supreme Clarity, Mysterious Capital Disciples, your humble servants [Names] and all others, with unified sincerity, reverently petition the Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Highest Lord of the Golden Portals of the Mysterious Origin, the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heavens, the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering, the Perfectly True Lords and Venerable Ones, the Thirty-Six Celestial Emperors, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numen, Northern Perfected, the Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Portals, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Perfectly True Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all responsive numina of the Three Realms.

Your humble servants have heard that the Perfect Dao illumines the primordial, establishing transformation before Heaven. Though round and square differ in endowment, the hidden and manifest follow distinct paths.

The establishment of standards is no mere lure for goodness, nor the display of punishments a deterrent to those who would ascend through merit. The host of numinous sovereigns and administrators, arrayed in their offices and duties, leave nothing unattended, no matter how vast or minute, no detail too trifling to address. Thus is it intended that within the Three Realms and among all beings, each may strive to cultivate the heart and cease from evil, forsaking wrongdoing entirely. The scriptural teachings descend as guidance, demonstrating the rites of repentance and prayer. Illustrious maxims are clearly recorded, observed and revered from ancient times to the present.

We, your humble servants, have been graced by wondrous transformation and entrusted with offices of the Mysterious. Our aspiration is to aid the state in achieving merit and to deliver beings while benefiting all things. Now, having received these sacred instructions, how dare we not bring them before the throne?

We read the imperial words: The Emperor, reverently gazing upon the Mysterious Compassion, holds the Daoist canons in deepest awe. Moved by concern for the unseen and the obscure, he seeks to bestow auspicious blessings. Examining the statutes for the promotion of the truly worthy and consulting the ranks of repentance recorded in the *Yellow Register*, he ensures the peace of departed spirits. Thus, edicts are issued, silk and coin bestowed in solemn abundance, incense and flowers offered to purify and sanctify.

We, your humble servants, in strict adherence to the Mysterious Decree, array the imperial altar. To the four quarters and eight directions, we model Heaven and emulate Earth. We present our sincere words to the Three Realms, offering prayers of gratitude to the hosts of Heaven. May our crimson hearts be wholly poured forth to secure boundless fortune.

Today, at the midpoint of the ritual, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Perfectly True Treasure of the Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, gazing upward to the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits ascend to support the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain, their dignity enduring as long as Heaven’s pattern; may the ancestral temples and former sages share in the constancy of the Dao’s transformation. May the radiance of the Ten Flowers of Splendor shine forth, and the ascent to Perfection bring eternal joy. May great treasures of blessings descend, and vast foundations of fortune flow. May the prosperity surpass that of the Zhou and Han, and the duration of rule extend beyond that of the Xia and Shang.

Now, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Masters, the host of Perfectly True Ones, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascended beyond form. Harmonious and united with the Dao, they are truly Realized.

Today, at the midpoint of the ritual, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Perfectly True Treasure of the Scriptures.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, gazing upward to the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the Emperor. We humbly pray that the sun’s brilliance may rise and spread, broadening his wisdom and clarity; that the Pole Star may soar in splendor, exalting his sacred longevity. May his virtue and power surpass that of Fuxi and the Flame Emperor, and his benevolence and sagacity crown the achievements of the Great Yu and Shaohao. May the myriad states rest in his heart, and the nine regions follow his transformation. May the Empress, consorts, and attendants reverently uphold the compassion of Yao; may the Crown Prince and the various princes radiantly disseminate the grace of Shun. May the dukes, ministers, civil and military officials, each fulfill their loyal and steadfast duties, eternally sustaining the flourishing destiny of the realm.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense in reverent homage to the Great Sage Masters, the hosts of perfected virtue, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless—harmonized with the Dao, united with true reality.

At this moment, as we divide the ritual path, we invoke the assembly of the Dharma to offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke rise through the heavens, ascending directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Masters. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in full submission, gazing upward to the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits flow to the official [Name] in the netherworld at this very hour.

May the hosts of the Three Clarities open the gates of the sun to stream forth radiance; may the exalted Eight Scenic Lords spread their cloud-borne chariots to bestow blessings. May the spirit be bathed and the soul refined, the form and hun cleansed. May transgressions be washed away, karmic debts and grievances pacified. May the departed ancestors and descendants alike be suffused in this fragrant cultivation.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense in reverent homage to the Great Sage Masters, the hosts of perfected virtue, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless—harmonized with the Dao, united with true reality.

**Ritual of Repentance**
*Three Invocations*
Prosperous is the realm, flourishing the state,
Majestic the scriptures, thriving the Dao.
Heaven and humanity share a single vow,
In subtle ascent, they enter the Great Vehicle.
By the heart’s intent, the field of merit is established,
The Dharma-wheel rises in boundless ascent.
May the seven generations ascend to celestial halls,
And my own form soar in the light of day.

*Three Bows*
We, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Supreme Boundless Dao.
We, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.
We, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reverent Recitation of Dignities**
The disciple of the Mystic Capital of Supreme Clarity, your humble servant [Name], now respectfully and repeatedly petitions:
The Supreme Boundless Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning;
The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;
The Supreme Lord Lao;
The Perfected, Spontaneous, Numinous Treasure Celestial Venerable;
The Celestial Venerable Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering;
The Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures;
The Celestial Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
The High Ministers and Prime Aides, the Four Directors and Five Emperors,
And all the divine officials and venerable spirits of the Three Realms.

We, your humble servants, have heard that the myriad sages extend their compassion, and the Nine Heavens bestow their grace. They pity those exiled to the Three Wretched Paths and lament the drifting multitudes of the Six Realms.

A single lapse in vital essence severs one forever from the realm of the worthy.
Through endless nights unbroken, ten thousand kalpas stretch without end.
Thus, as the Celestial Venerable surveys the Eight Gates, He reveals the scriptures of salvation for the living;
Moved by compassion for the Three Realms, the Lord of the Dao proclaims the ordinances for deliverance from death.
That all may together ascend the courts of fortune and transcend the sea of desire.
The true scriptures and their wondrous purport rectify the state and transform the people.
The Emperor, mindful of the departed souls, publicly issues his sacred edict.
In accordance with the statutes of the Three Clarities, he opens the altar of the Nine Memorials.
With oil lamps, candles, incense, and flowers, he offers his sincerity to the host of sages.
With silk and ritual tokens, he presents his supplications to the myriad heavens.
Burning incense, kindling lamps, reciting scriptures, and pacing the Dao,
He purifies his heart and cleanses his thoughts, prostrating himself to entreat the Perfected.
He hopes that the divine radiance of the Eight Luminaries will descend to illuminate the dark prisons of the netherworld,
And that the talismanic commands of the Nine Dragons will swiftly arrive at the courts of accumulated night.
To deliver the souls in ceremony, raising them from the winding springs of the Yellow Springs.
To absolve and release [Name] Official, for transgressions across past lives and the present existence,
For boundless kalpas of accumulated faults and grievous errors, for past enmities and debts owed,
Whether committed by oneself or bequeathed by ancestors,
The offenses are manifold, beyond memory or reckoning.
Some defy Heaven and Earth, betraying the divine spirits;
Some harm others or injure creatures.
In death, they suffer retribution, enduring it for years on end.
Without the mysterious power of the Dao, there is no means of release.
Now, by the merit of this great fast and the cause of repentance and deliverance,
May the ten thousand sins and thousand transgressions all be eradicated and washed away.
May the divine souls be purified and serene, their sins and afflictions dissolved and pacified.
May they depart suffering, escape premature death, and attain realization of the Dao alongside the Perfected.
Moreover, for the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of the departed,
May they together bathe in this sublime merit and ascend the path of fortune.
May auspicious protection and blessings extend to the living.
Above, may the Two Images be clear and tranquil, the Three Luminaries harmonious and bright.
May wind and clouds follow their proper order, and malevolent forces sink and vanish.
May the imperial reign be boundless, and the Sacred Personage enjoy ten thousand years of life.
May the three agricultural seasons yield abundant harvests, with sprouting grain and ripening ears;
May the four seas be linked by ships and roads, with tribute of celestial beasts and rare fragrances.
May the empress, consorts, and imperial concubines, the crown prince and the various princes,
Support and assist the purple court, safeguarding the imperial ultimate.
May the dukes, ministers, and aides, the loyal and virtuous civil and military officials,
Assist the ninefold throne and harmonize the eight directions.
May weapons be sheathed and silenced, and the myriad peoples enjoy peace and prosperity.
Extending to the dragons of water and land, and all creatures that fly or dwell below,
May the merit of this fast reach them, and its beneficence spread far and wide.
Throughout the seas and the world within, may all attain the realm of longevity.
Above, may the great compassion of the Radiant Celestial Venerable be manifest;
Below, may the sincerity of our repentance and gratitude be fulfilled.

We humbly present this entreaty.

**Guardian Spirits Invocation**
The Five Stars shine brightly on high, auspicious qi soars and floats.
The Primordial Origin gathers the spirits, Heaven and Earth unite in full cycle.
Jade talismans and precious seals command the subtle and hidden.
Fire is cast and might displayed—no treachery or evil lingers.
The ten thousand demons tremble and submit, malevolent blooms disperse and vanish.
Monsters are crushed, wickedness felled, as the Dao’s qi flows as one.
Divine radiance illumines the night, shadows and darkness wholly withdrawn.
The myriad immortals descend in state, riding the winds on spreading light.
All beings attain fulfillment, grace pervades the divine realm.
The dharma drum resounds twenty-four times.

The Most High Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Origin, the Three Qi’s Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Fragrance Officials of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Days—thirty-two of each—forthwith to emerge. Emerging, they solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar’s Heavenly Thearch Divine Lords, and at once summon the local earth gods and territorial true officials to swiftly ascend and open the gates. This servant now, on behalf of the intent herein, conducts this evening’s audience and performs the Dao-ritual, praying that the Jade Purity’s Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure’s wondrous radiance descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and company, thereby rendering the Mysterious Altar pure and untainted, within and without perfected in truth.

Heaven is free of foul vapors, Earth purged of demonic dust. Jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear. The ten thousand demons dare not intrude, true sincerity ascends unobstructed. May this servant’s petition swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Most Perfect Jade Thearch Emperor on High.

Each declares their dharma-rank: Disciples of the Upper Clarity Mysterious Capital, this servant so-and-so and company, with reverent sincerity jointly petition the Void-and-Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable One, the Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Highest Great Dao’s Golden Portal Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Thearch Emperor, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the myriad perfected great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the Most Perfect Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable One, the Heavenly Venerable One Who Responds to Conditions and Comes to Save from Suffering, the Most Perfect Lords and Elders, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearch Lords, the Jade Void Thearch, the Jade Emperor and Supreme Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Portal, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Upper Palace’s Numinous Treasure Most Perfect Illuminated August Dao Lord, the Thirty-Six Divisions’ Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Lords of the Three Origins, and the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water.

Examine and assess transgressions and blessings, respond to the true numina of karmic resonance. This servant and company prostrate and hear: good and evil bear no form, but arise solely from human initiative.

Response and retribution never err, as echo follows sound. Past and present cycle endlessly, fortune and misfortune strike in turn. Thus the Northern Palace presides over death, the Southern Prosperity governs life. The numinous luminaries of Heaven and Earth weigh merit and record transgressions. Their vast loom weaves all things, leaving not even the slightest thread unaccounted. How could one fail to tremble and take heed, striving in reverence to uphold the Mysterious Precepts?

Therefore, the Most Perfect Great Dao and the Supreme Dharma King have bequeathed the ritual of repentance and gratitude through the precious scriptures, and the golden tablets bear the intent of confession and supplication. With a single heart, one confesses and repents, and ten thousand sins are absolved and dissolved.

The Emperor mourns the departed souls, grieving for those lost in the dark night. He seeks to extend surpassing blessings to rescue those beyond the Yellow Springs. Imperial edicts descend, and reverent fasts are observed. Now, in obedience to the imperial decree, how dare we not make this known above?

Reciting the words—
Following the text as spoken, its meaning runs deep with deliverance. We, your servants, consult the *Purple Yang Jade Tablets* and the *Yellow Register Scriptures*, modeling Earth upon Heaven, arraying the altar and setting forth the sacred texts. Solemnly we establish the Ten Radiant Positions and arrange the rites of the Four Poles. We prepare the ritual offerings of patterned silks, incense, flowers, oil, and candles, turning the scriptures and pacing the Dao, confessing and offering repentance to the myriad heavens.

May the true sages turn their radiance back upon us, bestowing blessings universally upon both the living and the dead. On this day, as the sun sets and the ritual procession begins, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now raise the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Dao.

We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow back to our ancestral halls and the august spirits of the altars and soil. May the imperial lineage of Tang ascend in luminous purity, bestowing auspicious heirs. May the phoenix calendar extend its grandeur, enduring with Heaven and Earth without end. May the celestial origins shine brightly, and the earthly records remain at peace. May all nations gather in harmony, and all beings fulfill their nature.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master, in the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

As the sun sets and the ritual procession begins, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now raise the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Scriptures. We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow back to the Emperor. We humbly pray that his sagely radiance may gaze afar, his profound grace extend widely. Seated in the dark pavilion to concentrate the spirit, may he contemplate again the sacred registers; bending over the great rivers to display his brilliance, may he once more receive the precious charts. May the land’s vast foundations endure, and the mountains equal the Emperor’s sacred longevity. May the empress, consorts, and concubines assist in the vermilion court. May the crown prince and the various princes illuminate and propagate the grand transformation. May the civil and military ministers, the inner protectors and outer guardians, see their blessings renewed and their illustrious splendor flourish. May the three frontiers remain tranquil, forever free from the toils of border defenses; may the eight directions enjoy peace, ever receiving tribute from afar. May weapons be stilled, pestilence vanish. May floods and droughts never encroach, and the dragon spirits rejoice. May no malevolent omens arise, and the harvests be bountiful. May all sentient beings together enjoy supreme fortune.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master, in the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

As the sun sets and the ritual procession begins, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now raise the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Master. We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow back to the official [Name] in the netherworld at this very moment. We humbly pray that our sincere devotion may ascend, and the mysterious grace descend. May the Three Realms’ Primordial Honored Ones radiate divine light to illuminate; may the Sagely Ones of the heavens above bestow abundant blessings to nurture. May the nine springs open the paths of darkness, and the six destinies cease the sufferings of rebirth. May souls be refined and cleansed, grievances and debts reconciled. May sins and afflictions all dissolve, and blessings and auspiciousness gather abundantly. Extending to the three wretched realms and the seven generations of departed spirits, may all together bathe in this sublime merit and together attain the Dao’s fruition.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master, in the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

The rites are now complete; we make our repentance.

**Threefold Invocation**

The Great Dao pervades the Mysterious Void,
With devotion, none fails to align.
Refining the essence, one enters the Immortal True,
And attains the Vajra body.
Transcending the Three Realms’ trials,
The Five Sufferings of Hell dissolve.
All return to the Supreme Scriptures;
In stillness, we bow in reverence.

**Threefold Prostration**

We, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Rank**

We, disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Capital, your servants [Name] and others, with utmost sincerity, jointly invoke:
The Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;
The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;
The Supreme Lord Lao;
The Most Perfect, Spontaneous, Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;
The Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering;
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
The Heavenly Master and Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Realm;
The Supreme Ministers and Prime Ministers;
The Five Elderly Lords of the Supreme;
The Lords of the Three Primes;
The Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water;
And all the responsive and efficacious venerable spirits of the Three Realms.

We, your servants, have heard that the Great Sages unfolded the cosmic plan, and the Primordial Sovereign guided the course of destiny. The celestial gates nurture all life, while the earthly records shape all things. Among all beings, humans are the most spiritually endowed, standing above all other creatures. Yet as yin and yang alternate, the nature and consciousness of beings ebb and flow. In conduct, there arise distinctions of good and evil; in movement and stillness, outcomes of fortune and misfortune are determined. Through sin and blessing, one ascends or descends; through life and death, one is separated or united. Therefore, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the Heavenly Great Sage, in their boundless compassion, issued the decree of salvation and opened the gate of protection. They commanded the Five Emperors and Four Controllers to extend their mechanisms of deliverance, and the hosts of the Three Primes and all the Sages to respond and govern. The Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water revealed the principles of judgment, while the clerks of the yin and yang bureaus proclaimed the rites of retribution. Their intent was to enable all to ascend the steps of blessing and together transcend the net of sin. Yet the deluded remain hard to awaken, and the turbid hard to purify. Transgressions and errors accumulate without end.

This official, from past lives to the present, through countless kalpas, has undergone the revolutions of rebirth. Whether through the constructions of the six senses or the deeds of the three karmas, the offenses are manifold and beyond recollection. At times, leading armies and commanding multitudes, he waged campaigns in all directions. At others, upholding the law and maintaining order, he regulated and restrained others. Sometimes punishing the wicked and suppressing the violent, he wielded the axe to assert authority. Or protecting the weak and curbing the strong, he dispensed rewards and meted out punishments. At times, undertaking construction and earthworks, he offended the dragon spirits. Or hosting banquets and feasting guests, he slaughtered living beings. Sometimes angling for the hidden or fowling the roosting, he galloped in the hunt. Or adjudicating legal codes, he judged cases with partiality. At times, swayed by love and hate, joy and anger, he indulged his whims. The sorrows of the living and the grievances of the dead accumulated as unrepented sins in the dark underworld. The Three Officials record the names of the guilty, and the Five Emperors tally the accounts of retribution. In the shadowy night prisons, to whom can one turn for deliverance?

The Emperor, moved by compassion for the suffering souls, wishes to elevate and deliver them. Following the regulations and standards, he has solemnly established the altar. Divine lamps scatter their radiance through the Nine Netherworlds, and incense wafts its fragrance across the Three Realms. We universally repent sins before all the heavens and pray for grace throughout the Ten Directions. We humbly beseech the Supreme Sages and High Worthies to shine their merciful light in pity; may the Three Officials and Five Emperors let their vast blessings flow abundantly. Bestow boundless grace and magnify the great acts of compassion. May all sins, without exception, be washed away. Even those in the Four Extremes and the Ten Immortals shall be discerned and illuminated. Draw them forth from the depths of the Dark Prison and guide them to the Courts of Flowing Fire. Purify their forms and souls, and bathe their spirits. May they ascend to the Realm of Eternal Joy and soar to the Upper Palaces. Realize the Dao and partake in the True, forever escaping the dark night.

May all past grievances and debts be resolved with devotion. May accumulated sins and residual calamities dissolve in an instant. May descendants enjoy blessings, and may distant ancestors ascend. May all beings—whether moving or still, flying or submerged—within the suffering realms touched by this ritual’s merit, together partake in auspicious fortune.

**Supreme Vows**

May the sun and moon shine with steadfast clarity, and may Heaven and Earth stand firm in peace. May the stars and constellations be auspicious, and may wind and rain be timely. May the great enterprise flourish, and may the Sacred Person enjoy myriad years. May the imperial lineage, like the branches of Heaven, forever shade the Eight Extremes; may civil virtue and martial prowess encompass the Nine Provinces in transformation. May weapons be sheathed, and may the harvests be abundant. Within and beyond the realm, may all attain benevolence and longevity.

Above, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be manifest; below, may the sincerity of our devotion be fulfilled.

**Vows**

First, may the Great Dao spread and flow, and may all under Heaven embrace virtue.
Second, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.
Third, may the sorrowful souls of the Nine Nights all attain liberation.
Fourth, may the lonely and unattached spirits all receive rebirth.
Fifth, may the world know great peace, and may the five grains be abundant.
Sixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, may rulers be benevolent and fathers kind.
Seventh, may the Four Seas be united, and may the six relations be harmonious.
Eighth, may the hidden in wombs and the sheltered in eggs all attain birth and growth.
Ninth, may chronic and acute illnesses swiftly be cured.
Tenth, may the destitute and exposed among the living be clothed and fed.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**

Incense Official Messengers, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all the Attendant Spirit Officials: At this place where we face the Origin, may the golden liquid elixir and the azure mushroom naturally arise. May the hosts of the Hundred Spirits and all the Perfected gather here before the incense burner and the altar of fragrant fire. May we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May the patrons of this ritual receive blessings, and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the Ten Directions, guarding the orchid incense, swiftly transmit our recent invocations directly to the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Most Perfect Jade Emperor.

**Entering the Chamber**
Each bows to the masters, visualizing as prescribed.

**Guardian Spirits Invocation**
Azure yang illumines the void, radiance returning to the numinous.
Divine tigers repel evil,
Flying immortals stream with bells.
Crush treachery, annihilate trials—
Ten thousand demons bind their forms.
Ninefold subtleties revolve the Dao,
Eightfold mights seize essences.
A thousand Perfected audit records,
The Three Origins purge all defilement.
To the left, the Central Yellow roars;
To the right, the Six Dings are commanded.
Seven revolutions, eight unions—
Traversing the celestial scriptures.
Majestic transformations tower,
The Three Ways proceed in harmony.
Auspicious clouds flow forth,
Merging with the Yellow Court’s luminous scene.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
O Most Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi*’s Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within this minister’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two each—to emerge.
Let them, in solemn array, report to the Mysterious Altar’s Celestial Thearch and Divine Lords, urgently commanding this land’s local deities and true officials to ascend and receive the report.
This minister now, on behalf of the stated intent, performs the dawn’s *qi*-uniting and Dao-pursuing rites. May the Jade Clarity’s Dao *qi* and Numinous Treasure’s wondrous radiance descend, flowing into our bodies.
Thus shall the Mysterious Altar be purified, inner and outer made true.
Heaven freed of miasmic filth,
Earth cut off from demonic dust.
Jade chimes resound—
The Ten Directions grow solemn and clear.
No myriad demons shall intrude,
True sincerity ascends.
May this minister’s petition swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Most Perfect Jade Emperor.

**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**
We, disciples of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Clarity, jointly and sincerely petition the Self-So, Natural Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Boundless Great Dao’s Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Lofty Great Dao’s Golden Watchtower Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Thearch, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the Ten Directions’ Attained Great Sage Perfected Lords and Masters, the Thirty-Six Celestial Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace’s Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the Thirty-Six Divisions’ Venerable Scriptures, the Mysterious Center’s Great Dharma Masters, and all responsive and perceptive true numina of the Three Realms.
We prostrate and hear: the Great Dao’s proclamation spreads, the Three Powers establish their stations. Emperors set the ultimate standard, the Four Great Ones share equal reverence.

Thus are states inaugurated and lands governed, the multitudes shepherded and all beings tended. With regal tassels draped and screens of state behind, the sovereign presides over the myriad regions. Though sagely rule emulates Heaven, it must draw upon unseen aid; when times are harmonious and customs prosperous, it is truly by the work of numinous power. Therefore, we reverently observe the constant rites of suburban sacrifice and prepare the grand ceremonies of auspicious purification. Bearing Heaven and serving Earth, we manifestly honor the Supreme Mystery.

Now, as calamitous fate converges and adversity takes shape, we must pray for auspicious blessings to usher in peace and prosperity. So-and-so, such-and-such an official, deeply concerned for the sovereign and earnestly devoted to governing the realm, devoutly conducts purification rites and vigil, hoping to move the true numina. We, unworthy as we are in our offices of the Mysterious Bureau, deem it our duty to submit this memorial. Humbly receiving the imperial decree, how dare we not make this known above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the petition states, the matter concerns the altars of state and the fate of the realm. We feel the virtue of nurturing completion and bear the grace of encompassing sustenance. Without knocking at the Gate of Mystery, one cannot hope for radiant protection. Therefore, with solemn reverence and earnest devotion, we establish the imperial altar. Our hearts soar toward the Azure Vault, our prayers ascend to the Pure Capital.

At this dawn’s ritual, the assembly of Dharma-initiates and we raise the first incense pinch. May this fragrant smoke ascend to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfect Dao Treasure. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and look up in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High. May this merit flow to the august numina of the altars of state and the ancestral shrines of former sages, merging with the Mysterious Ultimate and feasting in the Cinnabar Terrace of Effulgent Light. In the Golden Watchtower and Jade Capital, we present the sagely designs to the Primordial Beginning; in the Jeweled Charts and Sacred Records, we extend great blessings to the divine descendants. When transformation prevails, seas will be calm and rivers clear; as blessings flow, Heaven will endure and Earth will last.

Now, we burn incense in devotion to the Great Sage Assembly of Master and Honored Ones, the virtue of the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into formlessness, harmonizing with the true Dao.

At this dawn’s ritual, the assembly of Dharma-initiates and we raise the second incense pinch. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfect Scripture Treasure. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and look up in devotion to the Most High Venerable Scriptures. May this merit, above all, wish the emperor’s auspicious radiance to coalesce at the imperial throne and blessings to gather upon his sagely person. May he shine with the brightness of sun and moon, illuminating the ten thousand dwellings; may he emulate the virtue of Heaven and Earth, nurturing and sheltering all living beings. May the empress, consorts, and concubines gloriously uphold the great treasure; may the heir apparent and imperial princes harmoniously assist in the grand enterprise. May the ministers, officials, meritorious generals, and wise counselors—both civil and martial—together bring peace to the realm and its seas.

This day we kindle incense, surrendering body and life to the Great Sage Host of Venerable Masters, whose perfect virtue, having attained the Dao, preserves Heaven’s eternal abiding.

Harmony unites with the true Dao.

At this pure dawn of ritual practice, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this three-pinch incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly upholding the Most High and Perfect Treasure of Masters. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and look up in devotion to the Three Supreme Masters. May this merit flow forth to the heavens above and below, to the Three Realms and Ten Directions, to the divine hosts of the Great Dao and all the sagely beings of the heavens.

We humbly pray for the stabilization and pacification of the imperial destiny, that the sagely dynasty be blessed with trust and protection. May their majesty shine with the awe of snow, frost, thunder, and lightning, rightly governing the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. May all things be nurtured and brought to fruition, while malevolent spirits and pernicious demons are vanquished. May calamities be swept away and the imperial lineage prolonged.

May the Five Sacred Peaks stand tall, the Eight Pillars remain steadfast. Ever encircling the imperial throne, may they eternally uphold the imperial pole. May the Nine Mysteries ascend and be delivered, and all beings revive in clarity. May the myriad multitudes enjoy peace and well-being, and weapons of war be stilled. May all creatures—whether soaring or sinking, endowed with consciousness—together partake in prosperity and uprightness.

This day we kindle incense, surrendering body and life to the Great Sage Host of Venerable Masters, whose perfect virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless.

Harmony unites with the true Dao.

The rite is complete. We repent.

The "Threefold Invocation Hymn"

To take the Dharma as one’s wife,
To cherish the sutras as pearls and jade.
By upholding precepts, the six passions are restrained;
Through mindfulness of the Dao, desires are dispelled.
In purity, the true qi abides;
In serenity, the spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
And through every life, great blessings are received.

The Threefold Prostration
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks
We, your disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, servants [Name] and others, with deepest sincerity, once more reverently invoke:
The Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;
The Most High Lord of the Great Dao;
The Most High Lord Lao;
The Perfect and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
The Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
The High Ministers and Prime Chancellors, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, and all the divine officials and spirits of the Three Realms.

We, your servants, humbly recall:
The Three Venerables established the teachings, prioritizing sincerity and resonance;
The Supreme Sages transmitted the precepts, holding solemnity and reverence as their foundation.

Should we express our unadorned sincerity, it shall surely reach the august spirits.

We reflect that from the inception of creation to this very day, the sovereign cannot spread transformation without the people, nor can the people attain tranquility without the sovereign. The sovereign aligns with Heaven, and the king establishes the ultimate standard. How could they not draw upon the power of creation and rely upon divine efficacy? Only then can they transmit glory through generations and perpetuate blessings across the ages.

Since the primordial past, states and households have endured. Those who faithfully adhere to the principles of purity and quiescence are graced by the profound blessings of the Mysterious Origin. The Emperor, upholding Heaven’s mandate and grasping the cosmic order, has assumed the throne in accordance with destiny. Reverent, frugal, benevolent, and harmonious, he labors diligently over all affairs of state, ever more vigilant with each passing day. Yet even as he governs with ceaseless diligence, darkness and adversity still afflict the realm. Without recourse to the Supreme Dao, how could peace and deliverance be achieved?

The official [Name], long renowned for his great merit, redoubles his earnest devotion. Devoted to the sovereign and the state, he knows no rest. Thus, with utmost reverence, he prepares fragrant flowers, abundant offerings, and solemn pledges of faith. Laying bare his heart before the Three Realms, he bows in homage to the heavens. He exhausts his luminous sincerity, humbly beseeching auspicious protection.

May his crimson petition ascend, and the profound grace of the Mysterious descend. May the awe-inspiring power of transformation be bestowed, preserving the Emperor’s distant and enduring reign. Let the decree command the Nine Heavens, and the celestial hosts patrol the Eight Extremities. May wind and thunder sweep away the miasmic vapors, clearing the cosmos, and annihilate calamities to secure the altars of state. Let treacherous omens be purged, the sun and moon shine with steadfast clarity, and comets and baleful stars be driven away. May weapons of war melt like ice, rebellious ministers and their factions reform their hearts, and epidemic plagues and malevolent spirits vanish like clouds dispersed by lightning.

May the Hua and Yi peoples alike joyfully follow the winds of virtue, and the entire realm delight in the radiance of sagely governance. May the official [Name] enjoy emoluments as lofty as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and years as enduring as the pine and cassia. May he forever uphold loyalty and filial piety in service to his sovereign and parents. May the Emperor’s sagely longevity rise like the North Star and Mount Tai, his illustrious reign extend as far as the heavens and earth endure. May all beings, seen and unseen, ascend to the realm of longevity.

Thus, the transformative compassion of the Most High Heavenly Worthy is made manifest, and the sincerity of your servants’ devotion is answered.

With reverence, we make this declaration.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**

To the Incense Officials and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attendant Incense Spirits: May this

By this the high and low are fixed, and kingdoms rise.
The sovereign is the head, governing both the unseen and the manifest.
Exercising the power of yin and yang to nurture all things,
holding the reins of joy and sorrow for the myriad people.
Accordant with Heaven, embodying the Dao, sheltering the realm entire.
Yet should the times grow dark and murky, and all things suffer adversity,
if even one man remains unblessed, the multitude shares in sorrow.

We, the officials [Name] and [Name], earnestly seek to rectify the age,
our hearts deeply devoted to praying for blessings.
We now beseech auspicious favor to aid and sustain the sacred dynasty.
As our duty lies in propagating and magnifying the Dao, we must submit this petition.
Having received the imperial command, how dare we not make it known?

**Reading the Petition**
As the words herein bear profound meaning of vast salvation,
we now follow the mystic rites and solemnly open the imperial altar.
We prepare the ceremonies for the descent of the perfected and the advent of the sagely,
examining the forms of the Three Registers and the Nine Purities.
With fragrant flowers we offer our sincerity, and with tokens of faith we convey our devotion.
We pour forth our crimson sincerity in the mortal realm, awaiting the mysterious blessings of the celestial palace.

At this moment, as the Dao is practiced in the midst of the ritual,
we, the assembled ritualists, now raise the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May these merits flow to the august spirits of the altars of state and the ancestral temples,
ascending to the Three Realms, treading the Ten Flowers.
Bestowing great blessings to enrich the grand design,
granting extraordinary omens to prosper the sacred lineage.
In the lands of fire-mice and ice-silkworms, may no corner lack the imperial calendar;
among the ministers of Cock Forest and Child Tree, may songs of praise resound in harmony.
Surpassing the millennial reigns of old, exceeding the boundaries of Yu’s domain.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Hosts, the Perfected Ones,
who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless.
Harmonized and united with the true Dao.

At this moment, as the Dao is practiced in the midst of the ritual,
we, the assembled ritualists, now raise the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May these merits ascend as prayers for the Emperor.
We humbly hope that blessings flow to the mysterious extremity, and grace suffuses the purple imperial chambers.
May the eight seas settle into tranquil waves, their vastness equaling the sovereign’s benevolence.
May the ten mountains rise in verdant splendor, their heights matching the sagely years.
Harmonizing the jade candle of the four seasons, spreading jeweled branches through ten thousand generations.
May the empress, consorts, and imperial concubines, the crown prince and the various princes,
all receive vast blessings and together uphold the imperial throne.
May the civil ranks and military posts, the worthy ministers and meritorious officials,

who, having attained the Dao, preserve the heavens and endure forever.
Harmonized and united with the true Dao.

we, the assembled ritualists, now raise the third pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Masters of the Most High.
May these merits flow to the boundless expanse, within the domains of the Dao,
to the utmost Three Purities above, and the deepest Nine Ramparts below,
to the lords of yin and yang, the administrators of Heaven and Earth.
May the vast compassion of the Heavenly Worthies extend their salvation,

Washing away pestilence and calamity, eradicating disasters and misfortunes.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Hosts, the Perfected Ones,
who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless.
Harmonized and united with the true Dao.

**Ritual Concludes**
**Confession**

**Threefold Invocation Hymn**
Abundant flourishes the house and state,
Majestic thrives the Dao’s transmission.
Heaven and humankind share one aspiration,
In subtle vastness entering the Great Vehicle.
From the heart’s resolve the field of blessings is established,
The Dharma-wheel ascends in boundless ascent.
Seven generations ascend to celestial halls,
My own body soars in the white sun’s radiance.

**Threefold Prostration**
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Reaffirmation of Dharma Titles**
Disciple of the Supreme Mystery and Mysterious Capital, your servant [Name],
with due reverence, once more addresses and invokes:
the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Origin;
the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao;
the Perfect and Most High Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;
the High Ministers and Prime Chancellors, the Four Directors and Five Emperors,
all divine officials and spirits of the Three Realms.

By karmic conditions of former lives, we have personally encountered the turning of the Dao’s fortune.
Jade tablets and golden writs descend from the celestial gates,
tortoise-shell registers and tiger tallies circulate through the world’s domains.
Through the transmission of master and disciple, we have received and cultivated the teachings.
Yet our bodies dwell far from cloudy springs, our traces lost in the dusty sea.
Our merits have not yet aided the state, our Dao has not yet attained ascension.
We can but rouse our cinnabar resolve, hoping to repay the mysterious creation.

Moreover, in establishing merit and propagating the teachings, aiding the state takes precedence.
In all sincere supplications, how dare we fail to comply?
Officials [Name] and [Name], encountering times of calamity and adversity,
grieve for the nation in their hearts.
With devout preparation of offerings and utmost sincerity, they diligently perform the fast and vigil.
Following the decrees of the Supreme Ultimate and Ninefold Purity,
adhering to the texts of the Golden Clarity and Three Caverns,
they burn incense, light lamps, recite scriptures, and perform the Dao-circuits.

We humbly consider that the Great Teaching of Non-Action takes luminous response as foremost;
the unfathomable divine efficacy takes utmost sincerity as its foundation.
Exhausting sincerity in the earthly realm, it must evoke response from the Supreme Mystery.
We prostrate ourselves in reverence before the Three Supreme Worthies,
the hosts of saints in the ten directions,
the deities of all heavens and earths,
the responsive and efficacious divine spirits.
May they open the grace of great pardon, bestow boundless blessings.
Release and absolve the ancestral temples and former sages,
extending to the imperial person,
the accumulated transgressions and deep faults,
the limitless errors and offenses.
May the divine source be serene and pure, the Dao’s kindness luminous and radiant.
May the earth’s records and heaven’s origins halt the reckoning of disasters and blessings;
may the eight vast realms and ten thousand states spread the winds of harmony and joy.
May the two images be at peace, the three luminaries bright and clear.
May weapons be sheathed and stilled, pestilence and poison dissolved and submerged.
May fierce and violent beings be vanquished, dragons and spirits reconciled in harmony.
May the celestial armies and their mounts punish and eradicate wicked demons.
May the rebellious factions and malevolent followers be annihilated in due time.
May wind and rain be harmonious and timely, crops and grains abundant and flourishing.
May all creatures of diverse forms, flying and submerged beings of varied endowments,
the suffering souls of the three paths, the imprisoned spirits of the six destinies,
by the condition of this confession and supplication, attain their desire for freedom.
May they not be afflicted by plagues, ever preserving safety and integrity.
May the eight seas be free from perilous waves, the ten thousand streams flow in perfect accord.
May the manifest and hidden alike universally witness the advent of Great Peace.
May all living beings together attain the transformation of the Dao.

Above, may the Heavenly Worthy’s vast salvific blessings be made manifest;
below, may they correspond to the sincerity of we, your servants, who take refuge in the mandate.
We respectfully present this invocation for your hearing.

Entering the chamber.
Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

Guarding the Spirits:
The five stars shine brightly, auspicious qi soars and floats.
The Primordial Origin gathers the gods, heaven and earth unite in harmony.
Jade talismans and precious seals command the subtle and hidden.

The dharma drum is sounded twenty-four times.

The Most High Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Origin, the Three Qi’s Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-two each in number—to emerge. As they emerge, let them solemnly prepare and report to the Divine Lord of the Mysterious Altar of the Heavenly Thearch. Let the local earth gods and territorial true officials of this realm be urgently summoned to ascend and report.

This servant now reverently acts on behalf of [the sponsor’s] intent, burning incense and performing the Dao rites, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Purity’s Dao qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and all present. Thereby, may the Mysterious Altar be purified, and inner and outer realms become true. May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth rid of demonic dust. May the chiming of jade resound, and the ten directions be solemnly cleansed. May the ten thousand demons not intrude, and true sincerity ascend unobstructed. May this servant’s petition swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Most Perfect Jade Thearch of the August Heaven.

Each proclaims their dharma rank:
The disciples of the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Capital, this servant and others, with unified sincerity, reverently address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Highest Great Dao’s Golden Portal Mysterious Primordial August Thearch, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Lords, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital, Golden Portal, Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity’s Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Most Perfect Illuminated August Lord of the Dao, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all true numina of the three realms’ official retinues.

This servant has heard that when the three systems first divided and the myriad states spread like a chessboard, without emperors and kings, there would be none to govern and pacify; without the Dao and virtue, there would be none to secure and stabilize.

The Three Sovereigns embodied the Dao, ruling as lords over the Five Emperors, proclaiming virtue to perfect transformation. Thus the people cherished simplicity and sincerity, and customs attained pure harmony. The six qi were balanced and harmonious, the four seasons peaceful and prosperous. Thereafter, yin and yang fell into discord, the nine and six clashed in opposition. The Flame and Yellow Emperors saw the rise of military campaigns; Yao and Tang encountered the calamities of flood and drought. They relied upon the abundance of virtue, and leaned upon the numinous power of the gods. The myriad spirits of heaven and earth all lent their hidden assistance. When encountering adversity, it is fitting to pray to the true numina. Following the rites of reverent offering, may boundless blessings descend. Moreover, in accordance with the imperial decree, how dare we not report this above? The prayer is read.

According to the words of the prayer, the ritual concerns the state and the household. Official So-and-so, with utmost sincerity, aids and supports, yearning in reverence for the august numina. Presenting offerings of faith, he devoutly performs the fast and vigil. In accordance with the Three Primordials’ rank and the Numinous Treasure’s luminous statutes, he burns incense, lights lamps, recites scriptures, and performs the Dao-circumambulation. Traversing the myriad heavens to offer thanks, he circumambulates the ten thousand sages in homage. May it reach the Supreme Mystery, widely bestowing auspicious blessings.

Tonight, during the evening audience and Dao-circumambulation, the dharma assembly is invited to offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Dao. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up in reliance upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the august numina of the altars of soil and grain, the ancestral temples and former sages, ascending their spirits to the Purple Palaces, bestowing blessings upon the imperial domain. May they befriend the Five Emperors in the Jasper Palace, freely roaming in ease; may they bequeath a thousand auspicious signs to the imperial heirs, flourishing without end.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Assembly of the Master and the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

Tonight, during the evening audience and Dao-circumambulation, the dharma assembly is invited to offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Scriptures. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up in reliance upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits extend upward to bless the Emperor. We humbly pray that the precious calendar of the Nine Heavens may augment the sagely longevity without bound; that the jasper waves of the Eight Seas may widely expand boundless prosperity. May his brilliance surpass the sun and moon, illuminating all without partiality. May his virtue parallel the Two Modes, embracing and nurturing all things. May the Empress, consorts, and concubines spread their gentle virtue throughout the nine regions; may the Crown Prince and the various princes radiate their illustrious splendor through ten thousand generations. May the civil and military ministers, the officials within and without, propagate and disseminate the imperial designs, vigorously promoting the grand transformation. Extending to the distant frontiers and foreign lands, may all realms constantly enjoy harmony and peace, attaining the perfection of the Dao.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Assembly of the Master and the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao preserved the heavens and endured eternally, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

Tonight, during the evening audience and Dao-circumambulation, the dharma assembly is invited to offer the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Master. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up in reliance upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits extend throughout the Three Realms, universally reaching all directions. Together may they spread the mysterious merit, jointly proclaiming the vast blessings. Invoking the upright qi of the Three Heavens, may they cleanse and eliminate the treacherous and malevolent; summoning the divine soldiers of the Eight Poles, may they annihilate and pacify demonic afflictions. May the great enterprise flourish, the grand foundation be firmly established. May Official So-and-so be divinely aided with auspicious blessings, his heavenly endowment of longevity enduring. May he forever revere loyalty and filial piety, constantly serving the sagely brilliance.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Assembly of the Master and the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

The rites are concluded.
Confession and repentance.

**Threefold Invocation Hymn**
The Great Dao pervades the mysterious void,
With thought, none fails to harmonize.
Refining the form to enter immortality,
Thus attaining the adamantine body.
Transcending the three realms’ tribulations,
Hell’s five sufferings are dissolved.
All return to the Supreme Scriptures—
In stillness, we bow in reverence.

**Threefold Prostration**
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Reaffirmation of Dharma Ranks**
Disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Capital, your servants [Name] et al., now reverently reaffirm our supplication to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Origin; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Perfected and Utmost Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the High Ministers and Prime Chancellors; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all divine officials and venerated spirits of the Three Realms.

We, your servants, have heard that the sagely sovereign, robed in grace, governs the multitudes of the realm. Upholding Heaven’s transformative mandate, embodying the Dao to rule the seasons, he must manifest reverence for the Supreme Mystery to secure radiant blessings, and foster harmony in the lands below to perpetuate the grand design. Thus, the Dao of Heaven subtly sustains, while divine spirits secretly assist. Heaven and humanity interact in resonance, and the seas and lands enjoy tranquility.

Recently, as the cyclical nine and six converge, yin and yang fall into discord. Calamities arise in the course of destiny, causing inner and outer realms to share in sorrow. Official So-and-so, deeply committed to governing the state and earnestly devoted to serving the sovereign, seeks to amplify supreme blessings and reverently serve the sagely court. He has examined and adhered to canonical rites, meticulously upholding the Dharma’s sanctity. His heart races toward the Three Realms, his thoughts fixed upon the myriad heavens. Reverently establishing the altar, he devoutly conducts the fast and vigil.

We, your servants, purify our hearts and still our thoughts, bathing in clarity and emptiness. We burn incense and light lamps, recite scriptures, and circumambulate the Dao. Our sincere words ascend to the Ten Poles, our prayers for protection directed to the Three Clarities. We humbly beseech the Supreme Dharma King and the assembly of Perfected Sages: gazing down from jade pavilions, may you bestow vast blessings to universally bestow grace. Rectify the celestial origins, harmonize the earthly principles. Let the Three Luminaries shine brightly, the Five Planets follow their courses. Comets and baleful stars conceal their forms, while auspicious stars manifest their blessings. The eight winds align in sequence, the six qi balance in harmony. Drought and flood are averted, disasters and malevolent forces eradicated. Mountains and rivers remain serene, fierce beasts retreat and vanish. Customs become pure and virtuous, creatures free from plague. Ghosts and demons flee without trace, evil and perverse forces are crushed and destroyed. Barbarians submit in reverence, borderlands enjoy peace. Treacherous ministers and rebellious sons offer loyalty and devotion. Beacons remain unlit, weapons fall silent. The imperial enterprise flourishes, the sagely lifespan endures. The court abounds in loyal and worthy officials, the countryside harbors no neglected talents. The six palaces and hundred ministers together propagate the wind of virtue and power; the crown prince and various kings jointly support the vast and grand enterprise. Ships and caravans gather in full, harvests are ever abundant. May Official So-and-so be truly blessed with auspicious fortune, his official emoluments and state sacrifices renewed.

May even those in the dark springs and cold underworld, the six destinies and three paths, be illuminated by the radiance of wisdom, forever dispelling gloom and obscurity. May the divine wind cleanse impurities, attaining perfect coolness and purity. May all crawling, flying, sinking, and soaring beings ascend to the Dharma realm. Above, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be manifest; below, may the sincerity of our repentance and gratitude be fulfilled.

We respectfully present this supplication for your hearing.

**Vows**
First vow: May the Great Dao flow universally, and all under Heaven embrace virtue.
Second vow: May all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.
Third vow: May the souls in the nine nights of darkness attain liberation at once.
Fourth vow: May the lonely and unsupported spirits all receive rebirth.
Fifth vow: May the world enjoy great peace and the five grains abundant harvests.
Sixth vow: May ministers be loyal and sons filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.
Seventh vow: May the four seas be united, and enmities and affections reconciled.
Eighth vow: May those in hidden wombs and eggs all attain birth and completion.
Ninth vow: May chronic and recent illnesses swiftly be healed.
Tenth vow: May orphaned and destitute beings enjoy ample clothing and food.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**
Incense Official Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits, and all divine officials: at the place where we conduct the Dao, may golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise. May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected Ones gather here before the incense burner and sacred flame. May we, your servants, who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May the nation receive blessings, and both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, attending the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly transmit our recent supplications directly to the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Utmost Perfected Jade Emperor.

Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

**Invoking the Protective Spirits**
Azure radiance illumines the void, sunlight revolves with numinous power.
Divine tigers repel evil,
Flying immortals stream with ringing bells.
Crushing treachery and dispelling trials,
All demons bind their forms.
Ninefold subtle lights return the Dao,
Eightfold might seizes essence.
A thousand Perfected Ones verify records,
The Three Primes purify all.
To the left, the Central Yellow roars;
To the right, the Six Dings are commanded.
Seven cycles, eight unions,
Revolving through the celestial scriptures.
The sagely transformation towers sublime,
The Three Ways proceed in harmony.
Auspicious clouds flow and spread,
Merging with the Yellow Court of the luminous scene.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
O Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi* of the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, and the Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two of each—to emerge.
Let them solemnly prepare and report to the Divine Lords of the Mysterious Altar of the Celestial Emperor. Summon this land’s local earth deities and true officials to swiftly ascend and make their report.
Your servant now acts on behalf of the intent herein, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao *qi* and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into the bodies of your servants, thereby purifying the Mysterious Altar within and without, making all real.
May the heavens be free of defilement,
The earth rid of demonic dust.
Jade chimes resound,
The ten directions grow solemn and clear.
Let no demon intrude,
Let true sincerity ascend.
May the supplications of your servant swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Self-So and Spontaneous Golden Gate and Jade Steps of the Celestial Emperor.

**Declaring the Dharma Positions**
Your servants, [Names], with utmost sincerity jointly address the Self-So and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Boundless Great Dao’s Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the host of Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the Thirty-Six Celestial Emperors, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Flowery, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern Perfected Lords of the Mysterious Capital, the Golden Gate and Jade Steps of the Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Perfected Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Five Primordial Emperors, the Nine Lands’ Jade Emperors, and all responsive and perceptive true numina of yin and yang.

Your servants have heard that the Heavenly Venerable conceived and transformed the Great Dao, bestowing the merit of the Two *Qi*.
Shaping the myriad numina,
It provided the origin and perfected purity.
Above, it bound the suspended sun and moon,
Arranging the stars and constellations across the four turbid realms;
Below, it congealed and spread the mountains and rivers,
Merging the seas and watercourses.
Thus, the hundred spirits received their offices,
Fixing the boundaries of the four directions.
The Five Emperors governed their divisions,
Each securing their proper place.
Even the Purple Capital’s hundred towers and ninefold walls,
The commanderies, cities, and moats,
The human dwellings and abodes—
All possess their dharma images,
Corresponding to Heaven and Earth.
Relying on the merit of pacification and stabilization,
They harmonize with the blessings of governance and peace.
Your servants, charged with propagating the teachings and assisting the state in establishing merit,
In all matters of prayer, properly submit reports.
How much more so when following imperial decrees—
Dare we not make this known above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the words state, our sincerity is earnest and sincere.
May it, through the power of concentrated devotion, ascend to the true numina.

Your servants, leading the Dharma assembly and adhering to the ritual codes,
Arrange the altar and array the scriptures,
Modeling earth after heaven.
We adorn the ten directions with dragon banners,
Presenting our sincere words to the Three Realms.
At this morning’s Dao practice, we, the Dharma assembly, now offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.
Your servants surrender body and life,
Prostrating body and head,
Reverently relying on the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May this merit flow to the Emperor.
We humbly pray that the five mountains stabilize the earth,
Eternally matching the grand design;
The eight seas float the heavens,
Ever equaling the phoenix’s reign.
May the imperial fortune surpass that of Zhou and Han,
The sagely virtue exceed that of Fuxi and Shennong.
May the empress and crown prince
Illumine their wise virtue;
The princes and princesses
Harmonize with auspicious signs.
May the nine regions unite under one chariot,
The myriad lands gather through ships and bridges.
For this reason, we now burn incense,
Returning to the great sagely host of our masters and venerables,
The virtue of the Perfected Ones.
After attaining the Dao,
We shall ascend into the formless,
Harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as real.

The six relations and five clans
Together realize the immortal ranks.

Evil and demonic forces not arise.
For this reason, we now burn incense,

**Bowing to the Directions**
**Confession**

Let each contemplate the nine-colored perfect image, swallow the saliva, and recite the secret incantation to command demons.
Step into the void, circumambulate,
Prostrate and bow to the Most High,
Burn incense and return to emptiness.
Luminous radiance follows my return,
The Dharma-wheel likewise turns thrice.
Mysterious vows arise in the four directions,
Blessings extend to kings and lords.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven,
Resplendent, their glory unfurls.
Chanting and singing crown the vast desert,
Heavenly music delights my joy.
Together we offer fragrant incense to the supreme virtue,
Lesser immortals cannot compare.
Wondrous thoughts illumine profound awakening,
In throngs they ride the void in flight.
Circumambulating, treading the cloud-net,
Mounting the void, pacing the mysterious register.
Chanting the hymns of the Supreme Unity,
A hundred passages naturally harmonize.
Below, I command the youths of the Eight Seas;
Above, I escort the lofty immortals.
All heavens scatter flowers of incense,
A serene numinous wind arises.
Long-held vows secure the root of destiny,
Thus attaining lofty eminence.
Rejoicing before the Most High,
Even ten thousand kalpas are but a beginning.
The towering Mysterious Capital Mountain,
Revered by the ten directions as the One Sovereign.
The soaring Heavenly Treasure Terrace,
Its radiance flames like the flowing sun.
Resplendent jade-forest blossoms,
Vermilion fruits gleam in brilliance.
Ever mindful to consume primordial essence,
Refine the fluid to solidify form and substance.
Golden light scatters in the Purple Tenuity,
Graceful and free, the Great Vehicle soars.

**Three Bows**
Your servants prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Most High and Boundless Dao.
Your servants prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
Your servants prostrate with utmost sincerity,
Bowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**
Your servants, [Names], in all humility reaffirm and address:
The Most High and Boundless Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning,
The Most High Lord of the Dao,
The Celestial Venerables of the Boundless Dao in the Ten Directions,
The Perfect Great Emperor and Heavenly Thearch,
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
The Heavenly Master and Lord of the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center,
The Supreme Ministers and Prime Ministers, the Four Offices and Five Emperors,
The responsive and perceptive spirits of Heaven and Earth, and all true numina.

Your servants have heard:
Before the Dao’s transformation divided, it was the primordial body of the Undifferentiated;
The mysterious workings do not govern, entrusting the True Unity to non-action.
Thereupon, the two images divided and the numinous arose,
The three powers established their positions.
Purity and turbidity matched the qualities of Qian and Kun,
Obscurity and brightness manifested the distinction of day and night.
The spirits of yin and yang each administered their offices.
Thus, we constructed these halls to replace the layered nests.
Having taken the celestial gates as our model,
We thereby presided over the tally of hidden merits.
Thus, Qian Heaven and Dui Marsh each have their overseeing governance;
Li Fire and Xun Wind mutually reveal decline and prosperity.
To follow them is to surely accord with uprightness and fortune;
To oppose them is to invite regret and blame.
From ancient times to the present, all have followed this Way.

The fast’s sponsor, [Name], having chosen this site for construction,
Feared transgressions and violations.
The ways of spirits are difficult to fathom,
Common understanding cannot plumb them.
Now that the work of earth and timber is complete,
We shall perform the rites of incense and lamps.
We confess our sins and seek grace,
Dispelling calamities and repenting transgressions.
Greatly expanding the fast’s offerings,
We reach upward to the Perfected.
For this reason, we array the Dharma altar,
Adhering to the ritual codes.
Orchid lamps scatter their light,
Illuminating the Nine Netherworlds below.
Fragrant stalks congeal their smoke,
Communicating with the Three Realms above.
Turning scriptures and practicing the Dao,
We universally perform repentance and prayer.
Perhaps we have offended numinous spirits,
Or harmed the earthly courts.
Perhaps we have taken lives or defiled sacred traces,
Or disturbed dragon deities, violating various prohibitions.
Perhaps through forced labor, we have incurred resentment,
Or by relocating without choosing an auspicious site,
Accumulated transgressions and faults,
Thereby binding ourselves in calamity’s coils.
Perhaps within the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams,
Or within the Ten Stems and Twelve Branches,
We have violated the punishments of yin and yang,
Or the seventy-two spirits.
Below, this is reported to the Earthly Offices;
Above, it is declared to the Heavenly Courts.
Relying on this repentance and confession,
We beseech the sweeping away of all offenses.
May the fast’s blessings universally extend,
Its virtuous merit widely spread,
Descending the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands,
Proclaiming to all heavens;
Wielding the majestic power of the Three Treasures,
Commanding the Three Realms.
Rescuing these nightly courts,
Opening all radiant illuminations.
Stabilizing the imperial enterprise within the Ninefold Palace,
Disseminating mysterious blessings to the myriad states.
The five weapons laid to rest,
The hundred grains abundantly harvested.
The fast’s sponsor, [Name], and their household,
Living and deceased, are at peace;
Their clan and kin flourish in prosperity.
Children and grandchildren are loyal and filial,
Their posterity and descendants multiply in splendor.
Sins are expunged from the records of the netherworld,
Their names inscribed among the immortals in the true realm.
The offices of yin and yang,
The inner and outer spirits,
Protect the Dharma and pacify people,
Aid people and benefit beings.
Together they propagate the Dao’s transformation,
Assisting the upright and repelling the perverse.
Extending to the hidden and the manifest,
All together attain the wondrous Dao.
Above, we manifest the Celestial Venerable’s vast salvific grace;
Below, we fulfill your servants’ sincerity in surrendering our lives.

**Initiating the Vows**
First vow: For the sake of the Dao’s four great elements,
Uniting in virtue with the fast’s sponsor.
Seven generations of parents,
Freed from falling into sorrow and suffering,
Ascend to heaven,
Clothed and fed by nature.

Second vow: May the emperor and lords of states,
See the Dao’s transformation flourish and prosper.
Schools and academies teem,
The imperial teachings expand.

Evil and perversity self-destruct,
Sages and worthies daily arise.

Third vow: May the Dharma master,
Establish great merit and virtue.
Teachings clearly propagated,
All together attain flying immortality.

Fourth vow: May fellow practitioners of the Dao,
Swiftly attain immortality,
Mutually guiding and delivering one another.

Esteeming benevolence and righteousness.

Sixth vow: May those who diminish themselves in giving,
To Daoists and the hungry and cold,
And all people under heaven,
Each attain their rightful place.

Seventh vow: May crawling and creeping creatures,
All sentient beings,

Never daring to slacken in the middle,
With equanimity and single-mindedness,
Universally deliver all beings,
Attaining the rank of superior immortals.
Ascend to heaven in broad daylight,
Bow before the Most High,
Forever becoming Perfected Ones,
Riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages.
Harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as real.

**Closing the Censer**

**Incense Official Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attendant Incense Spirits,**
may this place where I offer incense
naturally produce golden liquid elixirs, cinnabar mushrooms, and azure lingzhi blossoms.
May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected Ones
gather here before the incense burner.
May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao;
in seeking immortality, attain immortality.
May the ritual sponsor receive blessings,
and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor.

**Ten Directions’ Immortal Boys and Jade Maidens,**
attend the orchid-scented smoke,
convey my entreaties swiftly,
directly to the Throne of the Supreme Vast Dao—
the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Portal Jade Palace.

**Entering the Chamber**
Each bows to the master, contemplating as prescribed.

**Guardian Spirits**
Cinnabar spirits and vermilion fire,
flaming auroras and surging winds.
The crimson wheel turns with刚 force,
heaven’s light radiating in eight directions.
Bursting might envelops all,
transforming myriad realms.
Molten gold scatters, demons vanish without trace.
Evil dispelled, malevolence shattered,
illuminating primordial merit.
Golden talismans summon and command,
treading clouds and riding dragons.
Chants and songs celebrate the assembly,
flowers scattered across the vast sky.
Spirits work in hidden motion,
the four extremities secure and prosperous.
Prostrate before the Emperor,
none dare be disrespectful.

**Strike the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
O Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Dao Lord,
summon forth from within my body
the Three and Five Merit Officers,
Left and Right Attendant Messengers,
Incense-Bearing Golden Boys,
Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens,
Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans,
and Daily Incense Officials—
thirty-two each—
to emerge.
Let them, in solemn attire, open the gates and report to the Heavenly Thearchs of the Mysterious Altar.
Summon this land’s earth gods and territorial deities,
true officials and righteous spirits,
to swiftly ascend and report.

I now offer this prayer:
May the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao Qi and Numinous Treasure descend,
flowing into our bodies,
rendering the Mysterious Altar pure,
both within and without, perfected.
May the heavens be free of defilement,
the earth cleansed of demonic dust.
Jade chimes resound, the ten directions solemn and clear.
No demon dares intrude;
sincerity ascends.
May my entreaties swiftly reach
the Throne of the Supreme Vast Dao—
the Void and Spontaneous Golden Portal Jade Palace.

**Each States Their Dharma Rank**
We, your humble servants, [Names] and others,
with utmost sincerity, jointly address
the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous,
the Supreme Vast Dao, the Supreme Dao Lord,
the Supreme Lord Lao,
the Supreme Mysterious Elder,

and all true spirits.

We have long been favored with profound blessings,
personally encountering the transformative power of the Dao.
The five scriptures scatter their radiance,
the three caverns shine forth.
Expounding the profound principle of the Double Mystery,
unfolding divine efficacy in wondrous application.
We have gained access to secret depths,
able to receive and cultivate.
Yet from the outset of our covenants,
establishing merit has been our foundation.
For all who turn toward the Dao,
how dare we not make this known above?

**Reading the Petition**
In accordance with the petition’s intent,
we earnestly cultivate and revere.
We, unworthy as we are of our roles in the Mysterious Regulations,
are duty-bound to open the path to salvation.
The ritual sponsor, [Name], has recently undertaken construction,
raising earth and timber.
Fearing offense to the true spirits,
he wishes to present prayers and repentance.
Thus, we follow the protocols of the Three Clarities,
unfold the rites of the Nine Memorials.
With faith, we present this petition,
requesting to perform the retreat vigil.
Hoping, through this memorial,
to reach the Perfected Ones above.

**This Noon’s Circulation of the Dao**
We, the Dharma assembly,
now offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.
We dedicate our bodies and lives,
prostrating ourselves,
relying upon the Supreme Three Worthies.
May these merits
ascend to the august spirits of our ancestral temples,
the illustrious sages of past generations.
May they ascend to the sagely ranks,
and below, bless the imperial lineage.
May the Emperor’s virtue continue that of Fuxi and Shennong,
his brilliance equaling sun and moon.
Holding the golden mirror, he governs the four seas;
adjusting the jade candle, he nurtures the ten thousand regions.
At court, loyal and worthy ministers;
in the countryside, none left behind.
Thus, we now burn incense,
returning to the great sagely hosts of our masters,
the virtues of the Perfected Ones.
After attaining the Dao,
may we ascend into the formless,
harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as real.

**Bowing to the Directions**

**Confession**

Each reflects upon the nine-hued perfect image,
swallows saliva, and recites the demon-subduing esoteric incantation.
Pacing the void, circumambulating,
bowing and rising, we visualize the Supreme,
where blossoming radiance adorns the cinnabar path.
Turning left, we grasp the Dark Essence;
glancing right, we hold the Bright Pearl.
The Six Perfections crown the pure practice,
while virtue and power renew with the sun.
Lifetimes of accumulated merit respond,
and hearing the scriptures feels like meeting kin.
Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent,
we joyfully chant the subtle and profound texts.
In emptiness, the Great Harmony’s qi,
we exhale and inhale the essence of streaming clouds.
Fetal breathing stills the hundred channels,
in profound solitude, we master the Three Conveniences.
The Mud Pill Palace gleams with luminous radiance,
and we attain the Golden Flower Immortals.
The Demon Kings respectfully receive their charge,
thus enabling our ascent to the heavens.
All begins with fasting and precepts,
layered merit forging karmic ties of old.
Soaring through the Great Void,
we uplift the loftiest adepts.
Guiding the reins to the ten directions,
we pause to rest on the dark radiance’s slope.
Gazing up at the Kalpa Terrace,
looking down upon the purple cloud net.
Carefree in the Supreme Capital,
we sit together upon lotus blossoms.
Through accumulated study, we become Perfected Ones,
serene, with harmonized defense and nourishment.
Forever enjoying boundless life,
why count the myriad aeons?
The Great Dao’s master is profound stillness,
ascending immortals befriend the peerless.
The Noble Scion bestows the numinous talisman,
the Supreme holds the Cavern Scripture.
The relics gleam with golden splendor,
the dragon chariot swiftly arrives to welcome.
The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon the cloud carriage,
floating, soaring through the void.
Fragrant flowers fall like snow,
mist and haze flourish upon the dark beams.

**Three Bows**

We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**

We, your humble servants [Names], respectfully reaffirm our address to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;
the Supreme Dao Lord;
the Supreme Lord Lao;
the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and Virtuous Hosts;
the Perfected Great Emperors and Celestial Emperors;
the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
the Earthly Mansion’s Supreme August One;
the Five Emperors of the Great Beginning;
and the Responsive Numinous Spirits of the Central Yellow and Earthly Branches.

We prostrate ourselves, having heard:
When the Great Dao divided,
the sages established teachings.
Drawing from the *Yijing*’s images,
they modeled themselves upon the Supreme Mystery.

Having established the norms for constructing halls and beams, they replaced the ancient nests and caves. To benefit all under Heaven and shelter the multitudes of beings, they commanded the deities of Heaven and Earth, the marshals of yin and yang. They divided ranks and arranged hierarchies, each with its proper charge. From ancient times to the present, these have been reverently observed, and no deviation has marred fortune or misfortune.

The patron of this retreat, [Name], having recently undertaken construction and renovation, fears that excavation may disturb sacred traces or encroach upon the abodes of spirits; that it may offend the qi of repose and prosperity or transgress the directions of taboo. Thus, an altar has been prepared to offer repentance and supplication.

We, your servants, consulting the *Hetu*’s graded standards and unfolding the ritual canons of the Three Caverns, lead the Dharma assembly in earnestly conducting this retreat. We prostrate ourselves beneath the Three Luminaries and lay bare our hearts before the myriad sages. We repent our transgressions and faults, beseeching grace and pardon. May our sincere devotion move the true numina to descend.

We respectfully invoke for the disciple [Name]:
**Cangming Jiubai Jun**, **Anque Tianxuan Jun**, **Tianxiu Tianyang Jun**, **Jiehuan Dunyuan Jun**, **Chisha Tianguan Jun**, **Xianguan Jiping Jun**, and **Shiyang Shanzhi Jun**;
**Qinglong Daoyuan Jun**, who presides over the peace of dwellings and the prosperity of residences, dispels calamities and averts anomalies, subdues pernicious qi, and suppresses wayward spirits;
who breaks the edge of poisonous curses and extinguishes inauspicious omens.

We further invoke:
**Hanming Dihuang Jun**, **Wushang Jianqi Jun**, the **Furnace and Fire Jade Maidens**, and the **Vanguard Inspectors of the Great Hosts**, who govern the collection of ghosts dwelling in wells and hearths within the residence.

We also invoke:
**Yang Fangping Shijun**, who governs the collection of qi from mounds and tombs beneath the earth and the deities of taboo, ensuring the free flow of upright qi and the suppression of malevolent forces. May the dwelling abide in purity and peace, ever secure in well-being; may the household enjoy auspicious omens and the gate know no untimely misfortune.

May the six relations be blessed with fortune, and the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven.
May longevity and prosperity be extended, and transgressions and faults dissolved.
May grievances and enmities be reconciled, and legal entanglements sink into oblivion.
May inner and outer realms know purity and peace, and all movements and stillness be luminously unimpeded.

Above, may the sagely enterprise endure long, and the imperial destiny stretch far into the distance.
May the myriad states rest in harmony, and the eight directions submit to transformation.
May heaven be clear and earth bright, the nation prosperous and the people joyful.
May auspicious omens and felicitous signs be recorded day by day and month by month.
May wind and clouds bestow their blessings, and seas and mountains relax in ease.

Extending even to the six destinies and nine nether realms, to all sentient beings with consciousness,
may they all partake in vast fortune and each attain carefree bliss.
May the dragon spirits of the dwelling and the yin-yang officials of their ranks
be rewarded for their merits and stationed securely in their domains.
From the hidden to the manifest, may all universally attain flourishing peace.

Above, may the radiant Heavenly Worthy grant great mercy;
below, may the sincerity of this assembly’s devotion be answered.
We reverently make this declaration known.

We now offer our vows:

**The Most Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three Qi’s Most High Dao Lord** summons forth from within this servant’s body the **Three-Five Merit Officers**, the **Left and Right Attendant Envoys**, the **Incense-Bearing Golden Youth**, the **Message-Transmitting Jade Maiden**, and the **Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Incense Officials of the Day**, each thirty-two in number, to emerge. As they emerge, they solemnly prepare and open the gates of the **Mysterious Altar’s Heavenly Thearch Divine Lords**, commanding the **Local Earth Gods and Domain Spirits**, the **True Officials and Righteous Deities** of this place, to swiftly ascend and open the gates. This servant now reverently acts on behalf of the intent herein, praying that the **Jade Purity’s Dao Qi and Numinous Treasure’s Wondrous Light** descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and all present, thereby rendering the **Mysterious Altar pure and still**, both within and without perfected in truth.

May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth purged of demonic dust. May the chiming of jade resound, the ten directions solemn and clear. May the ten thousand demons not intrude, and true sincerity ascend above. May this servant’s petition swiftly reach the **Most High and Boundless Great Dao’s Golden Portal and Jade Steps of the Supreme Emperor**.

Each proclaims their dharma rank:
**Servants of such-and-such rank**, we humbly and with one mind reverently petition the **Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Boundless Great Dao**, the **Most High Great Dao Lord**, the **Great Sage Ancestor, Supreme and Lofty Great Dao’s Golden Portal and Mysterious Primordial Heavenly August Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao**, the **Supreme Jade Thearch**, the **Great Sage Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao**, the **Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearch Lords**, the **Jade Void Highest Emperor**, the **Jade Thearch Great Emperor**, the **Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital and Golden Portal’s Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace and Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace’s Numinous Treasure’s Most True Radiant August Dao Lord**, the **Thirty-Six Divisions’ Venerable Scriptures**, the **Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center**, the **Earth Mansion’s Supreme Thearch**, the **Nine Earths’ Five Thearchs**, and the **Central Yellow’s Wu-Ji Responsive True Spirits**.

This servant and all present prostrate ourselves, having heard that the **Most High has transmitted the texts**, the **Primordial August One established the teachings**, **fashioning and harmonizing the ten thousand existences**, **nurturing and sustaining all regions**.

The **Three Caverns’ Jade Scriptures** descend from the **Ninefold Purity** to unfold their mysteries; the **Great Saints of the Myriad Heavens** propagate the **Supreme Dao** to deliver humankind. Assisting the state is foremost, compassionate salvation the foundation. Should there be any petition, how dare we not report it above?

**Reading the Petition**
We, your servants, having examined the sincerity of the petition, find it proper to submit for imperial consideration. The **fast-master** [Name], regarding his dwelling, has undertaken repairs and renovations, yet fears transgressing against the divine or violating taboos. Earnestly he offers repentance and purification to atone for faults and flaws. Thus, in accordance with canonical rites, he reverently establishes the altar, unfolds the **Mysterious Capital’s Jade Tome**, and follows the **Yellow Register’s** scriptural texts. Modeling earth upon heaven, he conducts the fast and performs the Dao.

Tonight, at the evening audience, as the ritual proceeds, we, the **Dharma assembly**, now present the **first pinch of incense**. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the **Most High, Perfect, and True Dao-Treasure**. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the **Three Honored Ones of the Most High**. May this merit flow to the ancestral spirits of the imperial lineage and the luminous ranks of former sages. May the Emperor ascend to the highest realms, securely establishing his grand destiny. May it illuminate all directions like the sun and moon, nurturing all beings like the three luminaries. May the Crown Prince, consorts, and empresses radiantly assist in this flourishing. May civil and military officials aid in the perfection of sagely transformation.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the **Great Saints, the Perfected**, and the virtue of those who, having attained the Dao, ascend beyond form, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

Tonight, at the evening audience, as the ritual proceeds, we, the **Dharma assembly**, now present the **second pinch of incense**. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the **Most High, Perfect, and True Scripture-Treasure**. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the **Three Honored Ones of the Most High**. May this merit flow to the household of the **fast-master** [Name]. May the nine generations of departed spirits wander the azure heavens; may the six relations of kin attain ranks in the immortal realms. Within his dwelling, may the dragon deities and divine officers securely occupy their stations. May malevolent forces be purged, harmony achieved, and eternal peace and auspiciousness prevail.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the **Great Saints, the Perfected**, and the virtue of those who, having attained the Dao, ascend beyond form, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

Tonight, at the evening audience, as the ritual proceeds, we, the **Dharma assembly**, now present the **third pinch of incense**. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the **Most High, Perfect, and True Master-Treasure**. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the **Three Honored Ones of the Most High**. May this merit flow to all under heaven, to all sentient beings. May it universally extend to the hidden and manifest, equally bestowing blessings and protection. May the household of the **fast-master** [Name] see misfortune cease and fortune prolonged. May all rightly inherit the winds of virtue and together realize the fruits of true immortality.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the **Great Saints, the Perfected**, and the virtue of those who, having attained the Dao, ascend beyond form, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

**Ritual Directions**
**Confession**

**Procession of the Void**

We circumambulate, encircling—
heads bowed in homage to the Golden Gates,
craning necks to roam the Jade Capital.
The *qian*-tree stands in the Garden of Rounded Radiance,
resplendent, the Seven Jeweled Grove aflame.
Three hundred celestial beasts bear names,
lions vast as ten thousand *xun*.
Flying dragons chant in lingering song,
divine phoenixes cry in measured harmony.
A numinous breeze fans wondrous blossoms,
pure fragrance scattering upon mortal robes.
Without the talent of lofty immortals,
how could one indulge such a heart?

We array our Nine-Dragon Chariot,
mounting the void to roam free.
The Eight Heavens lie like a palm’s span,
the Six Directions—how could they be distant?
The host of perfected chant the *Dongxuan*,
the Most High intones pure hymns.
Incense and flowers scatter upon the wind,
jade tones form in the Purple Empyrean.
The Five Sufferings burst forth at once,
the Eight Perils dissolve into scriptural emptiness.
Wondrous, the precincts of the Numinous Treasure—
here arises the great Dharma Bridge.
The Palace of the Celestial Thearch Unity,
luminous, crowned with radiant numen.
The Wheel of the Dharma’s net flows and shines,
spiraling into formlessness through the void.
The August Sovereign plucks the cloud-zither,
the host of perfected chant the *Dongjing*.
Lofty immortals stand in solemn praise,
through kalpas preserving purity and integrity.

**Three Prostrations**
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in homage,
to the **Most High, Boundless Great Dao**.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in homage,
to the **Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures**.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in homage,
to the **Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center**.

**Reaffirmation of Dharma Rank**
We, your servants of proper rank, [Names], reverently reaffirm our address,
supplicating the **Most High, Boundless Great Dao, Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin**,
the **Most High Great Dao Lord**,
the **Most High Lord Lao**,
the **Boundless Great Dao and Virtue’s Host of Sagely Heavenly Worthies, Perfected Great Emperors, and Celestial Thearchs of the Ten Directions**,
the **Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures**,
the **Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center**,
the **Jade Thearch of the Nine Lands**,
the **Five Primordial Emperors of the Great Beginning**,
the **Twelve Perfected Lords of the Central Yellow and Earthly Branches**,
and all responsive numina of the Three Realms.

We, having been privileged to serve the Perfected,
have partaken in the cultivation of secret wonders.
Yet no merit surpasses that of moving and nourishing,
nor has transformation fully pervaded living beings.
Ever mindful of aiding the state and transforming people,
we propagate the Dao and extol the Dharma,
upholding the profound mysteries to broadly succor humans and devas.

The **fast-master** [Name], in renovating his dwelling,
has initiated construction and labor.
Perhaps in hauling timber or moving stone,
he startled or disturbed dragon spirits.
Perhaps in raising low or lowering high,
he violated prohibitions and taboos.
Perhaps the land of his dwelling
holds ancient traces or numinous ruins.
Perhaps the site of excavation
contains abandoned shrines or crumbling ramparts.
Perhaps he has defiled immortal precincts
or encroached upon renowned sites.
Perhaps he has failed to suit the Five Surnames’ harmony
or contravened the Two Dwellings’ advantage.
Through these renovations,
misfortune and calamity have arisen.
Reverently establishing the altar,
we now present our prayers and confessions.

Following the **Celestial Master’s Grades and Ranks**,
in accordance with the **Orthodox Unity Dharma Texts**,
we invoke the **Twelve Divisions of Heavenly Officials, Generals, Officers, and Soldiers of the Salvation-from-Ruin Bureau**,
to expel residual qi and purify pernicious influences.
Banish the earth’s wood-and-stone spirits,
along with wandering corpses and malevolent ghosts.
Dissolve the harm of the Earth Lord’s encroachment,
dispel the disasters of the Five Directions’ prohibitions.
May all inauspicious specters
be utterly eradicated.
Let auspicious mists gather,
and misfortunes melt like ice.

We humbly pray the **Most High and Host of Worthies**
to deign to gaze upon us with compassion,
sending forth true qi to overshadow and protect this place.
Command the proper spirits to secure and stabilize their positions,
ever upholding purity and fortune,
eternally preserving peace and well-being.

May the **imperial Dao flourish and prosper**,
the **august winds spread far**.
May the **Three Frontiers know peace**,
the **Eight Seas remain waveless**.
May **epidemics and poisons not intrude**,
the **stars and constellations align with their measures**.
Even to the **nightly treasuries of the Yellow Springs**,
may light ever be beheld.
May all **creeping and living beings**
not lose their proper place.

May the **fast-master** [Name]’s **Seven Ancestral Spirits** attain ranks and ascend to heaven.
May his descendants transmit the norms of loyalty and filial piety,
and near and far enjoy the blessings of peace and security.
May dragon spirits secretly guard him,
his every movement harmonious and tranquil.
May all bathe in the **mysterious merit**,
together ascending to the realm of the Perfected.
Above, may the **Heavenly Worthy’s merciful grace** be manifest;
below, may our **repentant sincerity** be answered.

**Vows**
First, may heaven and earth be bright and pure.
Second, may the atmosphere be clear and mysterious.
Third, may the Sage enjoy myriad years.
Fourth, may transformation pervade the Eight Extremities.
Fifth, may heaven bestow sweet dew.
Sixth, may earth emit auspicious mists.
Seventh, may the four seasons follow their courses.
Eighth, may the myriad beings thrive in wholeness.
Ninth, may households abound in filial piety and fraternity.
Tenth, may the state teem with talent and worthies.
Eleventh, may the merit of this fast spread widely.
Twelfth, may good omens daily increase.

Harmonizing with the Dao in truth.
**Returning the incense.**

**Incense Officials, Envoys, and Attendant Spirits**

May the **Incense Official Envoys**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, and all **Attendant Spirit-Officials of the Incense** ensure that where this servant’s incense rises, golden elixir, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs spontaneously flourish. May the **Hundred Spirits and Perfected Beings** gather here before the incense burner. May this servant, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the **fast’s sponsor** receive blessings, and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor.

May the **Jade Maidens and Immortal Youths of the Ten Directions**, attending the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly convey this servant’s words directly to the **Jade Throne of the Supreme Vast Dao, the Peerless Great Way, in the Golden Palace**.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

**Supreme Three Heavens, Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin, Supreme Dao Lord**, summon forth from within this servant’s body the **Three and Five Merit Officers**, the **Left and Right Envoys**, the **Incense-Bearing Golden Youths**, the **Jade Maidens of Transmission**, and the **Incense Officials of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendance**, thirty-two each, to emerge.

Let them, in solemn array, report to the **Celestial Thearchs and Divine Lords of the Mysterious Altar**, and urgently summon the **Local Earth Gods and True Officials of this realm** to ascend and make their report.

This servant now humbly offers prayers for the intended purpose, beseeching the **Lingbao Wondrous Light of the Jade Clarity’s Dao Qi** to descend and flow into the bodies of this assembly, rendering the **Mysterious Altar** pure and the inner and outer realms perfected. May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth devoid of inauspicious dust. May the chiming of jade resound, and the Ten Directions be solemnly reverent. May the myriad demons not intrude, and true sincerity ascend. May this servant’s words swiftly reach the **Jade Throne of the Supreme Vast Dao, the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, in the Golden Palace**.

**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**

We, your humble servants, [names] and all present, with one heart offer this petition to the **Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin**, the **Peerless Great Dao, Supreme Great Dao Lord**, the **Supreme Lord Lao**, the **August Jade Emperor**, the **Perfected and Sages of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao**, the **Thirty-Six Celestial Thearchs**, the **Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor**, the **Great Emperor of the Jade Thearch**, the **Eastern Flower, Southern Ultimate, Western Numinous, Northern True, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Palace, Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, Lingbao Perfected and Radiant August Dao Lord**, the **Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures**, the **Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center**, the **Nine Lands’ Jade Emperors**, the **Four Offices and Five Thearchs**, and all responsive and perceptive true spirits of the Three Realms.

We have heard that at the inception of heaven and earth, the transformations of yin and yang gave rise to all things. They fashioned the myriad forms and governed the myriad regions, all bearing the ungoverned work of the Dao and harmonizing with the principle of non-action. Yet when the Great Dao receded, pure transformation ceased to flow. Dwellings replaced nests and caves, and the omens of extravagance arose from earth and wood. Thus, both the manifest and hidden realms transgressed divine prohibitions. Therefore, the rites of repentance and gratitude were established, eliciting the wondrous response of resonance.

For this reason, the **Three Honored Ones** expounded the teachings, and the **Ten Thousand Sages** suspended the statutes. The **Five Talismans** revealed the mechanisms of exorcism and pacification; the **Three Treasures** opened the instructions of repentance and prayer. This servant, having been permitted to partake in the true teachings, has presumptuously assumed this office. It is fitting to assist the state, establish merit, rescue the perilous, and aid the common folk. Whatever words are herein contained, we dare to present them fully.

**Reading the Petition**
In accordance with the words of the petition, it is fitting to make this report.

Disciples of such-and-such, considering the unsuitability of our dwelling’s construction, contemplate establishing the merit of a purification rite to express expiation and gratitude. Reverently following the statutes and canons, we erect an altar and precinct. We burn incense, kindle lamps, recite scriptures, and circumambulate the Dao. May our petition ascend, thereby eliciting wondrous resonance.

On this day, as such-and-such officiates the circumambulation, we, the assembled ritualists, offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Most Perfect Dao-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, and look up in reliance upon the Most High Three Honored Ones. May this merit flow to the ancestral temples and altars of the sacred dynasty, to the numinous spirits of the soil and grain. May its radiance ascend to the Ninefold Purity and its blessings extend to the myriad realms. May it safeguard the flourishing fortune of the realm and subtly assist the sagely designs. May the Emperor’s virtue embrace the Two Modes and his illumination equal the Two Luminaries. May no one be left destitute in the wilds, and may the court abound in loyalty and integrity. May the Empress and consorts inherit winds of well-being, and may the inner and outer realms together partake of the transformation of peace.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Most Perfect and True, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.

On this day, as such-and-such officiates the circumambulation, we, the assembled ritualists, offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Most Perfect Scripture-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, and look up in reliance upon the Most High Three Honored Ones. May this merit flow to the household of disciple so-and-so. May the nine generations and seven lineages, the myriad ancestors and ten thousand forebears, transcend the dark night and ascend to behold the light. May they refine their essences in the Southern Palace and be born into the celestial realms. Moreover, may all beings in the three wretched destinies and six paths of rebirth, though differing in kind, together bathe in the fragrance of cultivation and ascend the path of fortune.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Most Perfect and True, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.

On this day, as such-and-such officiates the circumambulation, we, the assembled ritualists, offer the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Most Perfect Master-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, and look up in reliance upon the Most High Three Honored Ones. May this merit flow to the household of the purification rite’s sponsor, so-and-so. May the six affinities and five clans, all kin and relations, avert future calamities, absolve past transgressions, renew their blessed destiny, and prolong their years. May their dwellings be fittingly situated and the dragon spirits securely pacified. Thereafter, may all beings—whether soaring or sinking, animate or inanimate—together receive the mysterious grace and universally partake of the vast beneficence.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Most Perfect and True, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.

**Paying Homage to the Quarters**
**Repentance**

**Threefold Invocation Hymn**
The Law is taken as wife,
the scriptures cherished as pearls and jade.
Holding fast to precepts to restrain the six passions,
mindful of the Dao to dispel desires.
In purity, the upright qi abides;
in serenity, the spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
life after life receiving great fortune.
The household and state flourish in abundance,
the scriptures and Dao thrive in splendor.
Heaven and humankind share this aspiration,
floating into the Great Vehicle.
By the heart’s resolve, the field of merit is established;
the Wheel of Dharma ascends in boundless ascent.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven,
while this body soars in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the mysterious void—
with thought, nothing fails to align.
Refining the substance to enter immortality,
thus attaining the adamantine body.
Transcending the three realms’ tribulations,
the five sufferings of hell are dissolved.
All return to the scriptures of the Most High;
in stillness, we bow in reverence.

**Threefold Prostration**
We prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity,
paying homage to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.
We prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity,
paying homage to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity,
paying homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Reaffirmation of Dharma Titles**
We, your humble servants, so-and-so and others,
now reverently reaffirm our supplication to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao—
the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin,
the Most High Lord of the Great Dao,
the Most High Lord Lao,
the Perfected and Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao,
the Heavenly Emperors and Celestial Thearchs,
the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center,
the Supreme August One of the Earthly Palace,
the Five Emperors of the Underworld,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens,
the Orthodox Unity Perfected,
and all responsive numinous spirits of the three realms’ official retinues.

We have heard that the mysterious transformation is proclaimed and the Dao’s influence spreads afar,
bestowing grace upon the three realms and extending benevolence to all beings.
The covenants of majestic authority uphold the statutes of state assistance,
while the Numinous Treasure reveals the rites of repentance and supplication.
Whatever is sought is met with responsive communion.

Your disciple, so-and-so, dwelling amidst the dust of the world,
has yet to fathom the profound and wondrous,
and in choosing a site for construction, the dwelling is not auspiciously situated.
Fearing offense against the numinous spirits and transgression of taboos,
deviating from the signs of the eight dwellings and five phases,
and failing in the balance of yin-yang and the directions of punishment and virtue,
I am deeply troubled and full of doubt,
and thus wish to offer prayers and expiation.
For this purpose, we solemnly prepare the altar,
meticulously following the canonical rites.
With reverence, we present incense and flowers,
devoutly conducting the purification fast.
We turn our hearts toward the ten poles,
repenting sins before all heavens.
In accordance with the Orthodox Unity Dharma texts and the Celestial Master’s prescribed forms,
we invoke the three and five official retinues, the Heavenly Lords, and their officers and soldiers,
to dispel inauspicious spirits and dissolve disasters and misfortunes.

We humbly beseech on behalf of so-and-so:
the Supreme High Granary Lord,
the Capital Bureau Upright Qi Lord,
the Plain Chariot White Horse Lord,
the Summoning Lord,
the Lord of Qi Circulation and Disaster Relief who guards the dwelling,
the Heavenly Lord of Faults and Transgressions,
the Vast Controller Lord,
the Northern Citadel Edict-Command Transformation-Admonition Deliberation Lord,
the Heavenly Heart Censor and Attendant Pacifying Heaven Lord,
the Supreme Great Harmony Lord,
the Spirit-Gathering Illuminating Lord,
the Upper Prime Earth Lord,
the Great General Covering Heaven Supreme Heavenly Lord,
the Red Heaven Granary Qi Lord,
the Four Hu Lords,
the Earth-Restraining Lord,
the Heavenly Prosperity Lord,
and the Five Great Generals of the Garrisons—
to resolve for this household the three mounds and five graves,
the myriad spirits beneath the earth,
the lunar eclipse’s earthly qi,
the hundred maladies and malevolent reversals,
the depredations of thieves and harm,
and the qi of punishment, killing, and misfortune.
May the five pestilences and hundred diseases,
the spirits of curses and demonic disturbances,
the destructive influences from the four directions,
the military and hunting forces of the five divisions,
the curses of ancestral halls,
the manifold trials and all demonic entities,
the qi of five-phase retaliation,
the lingering and concealed spirits,
the accumulated misfortunes of past lives,
the calamities of the current year,
the twelve punishments and harms,
the internal and external oppressive forces,
and all malevolent spirits be entirely dissolved and dispelled.

Should there be any transport of timber or quarrying of stone,
or any groundbreaking or construction,
offending the true spirits of heaven and earth,
deviating from the true qi of yin and yang,
infringing upon the earthly palace,
or transgressing against the divine luminaries—
though the seen and unseen differ,
and common understanding cannot fathom—
we now repent and seek expiation,
praying for their complete eradication.
May the upright qi be proclaimed and spread,
the dragon spirits securely pacified.
May disasters and misfortunes be extinguished,
and blessings and goodness come forth.
May dwellings be peaceful and secure,
movement and stillness harmonious and tranquil.
May kin and clan alike
be bathed in the blessings of integrity.
May the seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven,
the three paths be purified and serene.
May the nine dark realms cease their accusations,
the long night be illuminated.
May grievances and debts be reconciled,
schemes and plots stilled.
May the lingering corpses and old qi,
the stagnant souls and hidden spirits,
all receive the blessings of this merit,
each attaining liberation and prosperity.
May they abandon the perverse and return to the correct,
aligning with the Dao and communing with the true.
May the imperial destiny be long and enduring,
the vitality of all beings radiant and flourishing.
May all under heaven be fully delivered,
and all creatures partake of glory.

May the vast beneficence of the Illuminating Heavenly Worthy
respond to the sincerity of our repentance and supplication.
We reverently submit this for your consideration.

**Replenishing the Censer**
Incense Official Envoys,

before the incense burner.
May we who study the Dao attain the Dao,
and those who seek immortality attain immortality.
May the sponsor of the fast receive blessings,
and the seen and unseen partake of grace.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions
attend the orchid-scented smoke,
so that the words we have uttered
swiftly reach the Jade Palace beneath the Most High, Boundless Great Dao—
the Void and Spontaneous Golden Gate.

**Exiting the Chamber**

*Morning Dao-Observance for Disaster Dispelling***

**Entering the Chamber**
Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

**Guardian Numinosity**
The Five Stars gleam in empty radiance, illuminating the divine court.
Encompassing the formless, they harmonize the qi of the host of spirits.
Concealed in profound silence, they traverse the Five Classics.
Displaying majesty to outshine the sun, they command the ranks of Jia and Ding.
Repelling demons and averting calamities, they purge filth and dissolve baleful vapors.
The myriad demons tremble in fear; dragons and tigers take flight.
Purple clouds interweave in shelter; the ten thousand qi unite as one.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
Most High Mysterious Prime, Supreme Lord of the Dao, summon forth from within this servant’s body:
the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Officers of the Left and Right,
the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Petition-Conveying and Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,
and the Thirty-Two Fragrance Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Days.
Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to report to the Divine Lords of the Mysterious Altar and Heavenly Thearchs.
Summon now the local Earth Gods and Territorial True Officers,
that they may receive this servant’s intent and prayers:
may the wondrous luminous radiance of the Jade Clarity Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure descend,
flowing into the bodies of this assembly,
so that the words this servant has uttered
swiftly reach the Jade Palace beneath the Most High, Boundless Great Dao—
the Formless and Nameless, Void and Spontaneous Golden Gate.

**Each States Their Dharma Position**
We, your servants [names stated], in solemn unity, reverently address:
the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement,
the Boundless Great Dao, Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,
the Most High Lord Lao,
August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven,
the Perfected and Divine Lords of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao,
the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs,
the Jade Clarity Thearch,
the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor,
the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, and Northern Perfection,
the Golden Gate of the Mysterious Capital and Seven-Jewel Palace of the Jade Metropolis,
the Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace,
the Numinous Treasure Perfected and Radiant August Lord of the Dao,
the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
and all divine officials of the Three Realms.

We humbly observe:
the Two Modes weave the warp of existence; the Five Agents engender transformation.
Fortune and misfortune intertwine; cold and heat alternate in succession.

The cycles of prosperity and decline know no constancy; the gates of calamity and fortune stand ever open.
In their greatest manifestation, Heaven and Earth may conjoin or obstruct, and kalpas shift through transformation.
At the next level, good and evil intertwine in turmoil, stirring dread and peril.
Yet this Supreme Dao encompasses the Void and Non-Being.
Without beginning or end, it attains the wondrous subtlety of the imperceptible;
boundless in compassion and love, it extends the statutes of salvation.
All evils are dispelled; no disaster remains unresolved.
We, your humble servants, have been granted access to the profound mysteries and partaken of the subtle essence of the Dao.
Our resolve is to establish merit and assist in the unfolding of transformation through the ages.
On the day we received the Dharma, we ascended the altar and pledged our vows:
to protect the state and deliver the people, and to widely proclaim the grace of compassion.
For all who turn toward the Dao, how dare we fail to bring this before the divine?
We recite the words, presenting them in utmost sincerity.

We establish the altar and ritual space to dissolve misfortune and transgressions.
Searching the scriptural teachings and adhering to canonical rites,
we invoke the Jade Decrees and True Scriptures, the dragon-script and phoenix-seal,
condensing clouds and coalescing qi to form sacred writ.
We safeguard and stabilize the Emperor, pacifying calamitous destinies,
governing the turning of kalpas, and subduing demonic forces.
Universally delivering all beings, we greatly propagate the divine transformation.

In accordance with this intent, we join in earnest supplication,
burning incense and kindling lamps to beseech blessings.
Now, at this morning audience in the performance of the Dao,
we, the assembled Dharma practitioners, offer the first pinch of incense.
May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in reverence,
and look up to the Three Supreme Ones.
May these merits flow to the august spirits of the state and ancestral temples,
to the divine ancestors of the imperial lineage, and to the numinous vastness of the Great Silence,
where they may repose in the Ninefold Purity.
Roaming the Purple Courts in freedom, ascending the Vermilion Mound in joy,
may they bestow auspicious blessings for countless generations.
For the Emperor and Empress, the imperial consorts and princes,
the dukes, ministers, civil and military officials,
we pray for the stability of the imperial reign and the longevity of the Sacred One.
May the loyal and righteous assist in the sagely enterprise,
the inner and outer domains flourishing in the splendor of imperial rule.
May all quarters know peace, the eight directions be free from peril,
and the winds of the Primordial and Pure spread far,
returning all to the harmonious transformation of the Great Dao.

Now, we burn incense in devotion to the Great Sage Masters,
the Perfected and Divine Ones, whose virtue attained the Dao,
ascending beyond form to merge in harmony with the True.

At this morning audience in the performance of the Dao,
we, the assembled Dharma practitioners, offer the second pinch of incense.
May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Scriptures.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in reverence,
and look up to the Three Supreme Ones.
May these merits flow to our own families,
to the nine generations of ancestors and the sevenfold lineage,
to the lingering spirits and obstructed consciousnesses.
May they be reborn in the Cinnabar Mound, shedding their mortal forms,
their earthly disputes resolved, their posthumous trials ended.
May they roam the celestial realms and dwell in the courts of bliss.

Now, we burn incense in devotion to the Great Sage Masters,
the Perfected and Divine Ones, whose virtue attained the Dao,
ascending beyond form to merge in harmony with the True.

At this morning audience in the performance of the Dao,
we, the assembled Dharma practitioners, offer the third pinch of incense.
May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Masters.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in reverence,
and look up to the Three Supreme Ones.
May these merits flow to all beings under Heaven, to all who possess consciousness,
reaching even the depths of the Yellow Springs and the hidden recesses of the unseen.
May distant blessings suffuse all, and every heart know peace.
May the disciple [Name]’s misfortunes cease, their adversities dissolve,
their longevity and fortune increase, and blessings gather abundantly.

Now, we burn incense in devotion to the Great Sage Masters,
the Perfected and Divine Ones, whose virtue attained the Dao,
ascending beyond form to merge in harmony with the True.

The Rites Conclude
Repentance

Let each meditate upon the nine-hued perfect image, swallow the divine saliva, and intone the secret incantation to command demons. Step into the void, circling the Supreme Ultimate—its height and depth divide, the light and pure ascending to join Heaven.

Should one cultivate the utmost Dao,
the body becomes a true immortal.
Their deeds surpass the three thousand,
their time spans forty thousand years.
The cinnabar terrace opens its treasure scrolls,
the golden mouth transmits the flow.
The Great Brahmā, Lord of the Three Heavens,
the Five Venerable Ones of the Void Sovereign—
even they scarcely glimpse its wondrous subtlety,
how much less can it be captured in words.
The jeweled throne descends upon the golden hall,
the rosy crown illumines the jade pavilion.
Myriad perfected ones attend the imperial court,
their flying sandals treading the roots of clouds.
Misty as fine mist, drifting,
their gossamer robes trail gently.
Exquisite, they ascend with auspicious smoke,
lightly following the soaring phoenix.
Having partaken in the jade chamber’s feast,
they suddenly point toward the grotto-heaven’s return.
Standing at Fusang’s shore,
they race toward the radiance of the Sun Emperor.

**Three Bows**
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Supreme and Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**
We, your humble servants [Name] and others, now reverently reaffirm and address the Supreme and Boundless Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao and the host of sagely ones of virtue; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Chancellors, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, and all divine officials of the Three Realms.

We have heard that the Great Dao sheds its light, spreading harmony and transformation. It shapes and steeps the primordial qi, giving birth to the Three Powers. Yin and yang alternate in their cycles, kalpas rise and fall in their destined turns. Endowed with spirit and nurtured in form, beings take shape and flow into manifestation. Before transcending the mechanism of change, they are bound to signs of prosperity and decline. Without invoking the supreme sages, blessings are hard to bestow.

We reflect upon the jade books of the Three Caverns, the golden tablets of the Nine Heavens—turtle-scripted phoenix scrolls, dragon-sealed tiger tallies. These can stabilize emperors and kings, safeguarding the kalpas; embodying the boundless Dao, they endure with Heaven. Next, they can restore the celestial canon, altering the course of disasters; pacifying families and protecting nations, aiding beings and bringing peace to people. The netherworld receives their deliverance, and the distressed find means of expiation. When fragrant incense ascends, sincere prayers surely reach. When the true register is presented, the august spirits surely witness.

The disciple [Name], fearing misfortune in their fate and deeply troubled, presents offerings and petitions, praying for manifest protection. We, having received the luminous teachings, exhort and guide the Dharma stream. Following the mystic statutes, we undertake this fast to cultivate blessings, invoking the Three Realms and repenting to the Ten Directions. Pouring forth our sincerity, we turn the scriptures and perform the Dao. Lamps divide like crane flames, dispelling darkness with flowing radiance; incense scatters like dragon smoke, piercing the void to convey our faith.

We humbly pray that the Celestial Worthy and the Supreme Ones bestow their compassionate salvation; that the Golden Towers and Jade Capitals, the thousand perfected ones, extend their protective power. May decrees descend upon the Three Realms, universally proclaiming to all heavens. Bestow blessings, extend grace, deliver the living and ferry the dead. Reconcile grievances, dissolve disasters. Let the five phases avoid harmful clashes, and the three luminaries cease inauspicious conjunctions. Above, resolve the afflictions of celestial bodies and the twelve celestial mansions; below, resolve the calamities of mountains and rivers, the nine palaces, and the eight trigrams’ domains.

For accumulated transgressions and deep misfortunes, layered disasters; for past grievances and old debts, unintended killings and mistaken harms; for the three karmas and six emotions, boundless offenses—through this repentance, we beseech their complete eradication.

We pray that the nation’s destiny be prolonged, the sage’s longevity eternal; that the three luminaries shine brightly, the four seasons harmonize. May weapons of war not rise, beacon fires cease their warnings. May evil demons hide, auspicious omens arrive. Floods, fires, droughts, locusts, wars, and plagues—may none assail our borders, and may perfect peace be preserved.

We further pray that the seven generations of ancestors ascend to Heaven, the nine depths of darkness be released from confrontation. May all beings, flying and crawling, fulfill their natures and dwell in peace. May the earthly prisons and yin tribunals, the three paths and six destinies, all ascend to the shore of blessings, bathed in the wind of the Dao.

Above, may the Celestial Worthy’s vast salvific grace be manifest; below, may it match the sincerity of we, your servants, in our devotion. We reverently present this petition.

**Invoking the Ten Resolutions**
First resolve: For the four great elements of the Dao, in harmony with the virtue of the fast’s sponsor. May the seven generations of parents escape suffering and sorrow, ascend to Heaven’s halls, and enjoy natural sustenance.

Second resolve: For the emperor and sovereign, may the Dao’s transformation flourish. May academies thrive, the imperial teachings expand. May their majesty be awe-inspiring, witnessed by all under Heaven. May the people praise great peace, the four barbarians submit. May evil demons perish, sages and worthies be born daily.

Third resolve: For the Dharma masters, may their merit and virtue be greatly established. May their teachings be clear and far-reaching, all attaining immortality.

Fourth resolve: For fellow practitioners. May they swiftly attain the immortal Dao, mutually guiding and delivering one another.

Fifth resolve: For the nine relations to be harmonious, valuing benevolence and righteousness. May they honor the Dao and despise wealth, their conduct a model for all.

Sixth resolve: For self-denial, bestowing alms upon Daoists and the hungry and cold. May all people under Heaven find their rightful place.

Seventh resolve: For crawling and creeping creatures, all sentient beings. May they all receive fulfillment.

Eighth resolve: For pardoning past lives’ debts. May this life’s karmic retribution be resolved through merit, amending past wrongs.

Ninth resolve: For the prosperity of family and nation. May ancestral temples have descendants, and worthy talents be born in every generation.

Tenth resolve: For honoring the scripture masters. May we never falter, maintaining equanimity and single-mindedness. May we broadly deliver all beings, attaining the highest immortality, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, paying homage to the Supreme. May we forever become perfected ones, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages, merging in harmony with the True.

**Returning to the Brazier**

To the Fragrant Office Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit-officials of incense: May the place where I offer this incense spontaneously generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here, assembling before the brazier in the cavernous chamber. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May I encounter those of karmic affinity and realize the fruit of non-action. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions receive this fragrant smoke and swiftly convey the words I have just uttered directly to the August Presence beneath the Jade Towers of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Portal of the Supreme Limitless Dao.

**Guardian of the Numinous**
The Yellow Center commands qi, severing demonic traces.
It suppresses the sources of evil,
restrains and severs demonic tracks.
By the Supreme’s talismanic decree,
divine efficacy is summoned and controlled.
The myriad spirits are thus subdued,
averting calamity and dispelling misfortune.
The Three Wheels of Royal Qi
circulate the True Wind through the cavernous void.
The Purple Portal bestows jade,
conferring boundless deliverance.
To the left, the Azure Waist is commanded;
to the right, the Mushroom Youth is summoned.
Riding the carefree winds of light,
they govern the Nine Empyreans.
The Mystic Altar responds to the moment,
mounting qi in the void’s expanse.
The ten thousand perfected descend universally,
delivering without end.

*Strike the Dharma Drum twenty-four times*

The Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao Lord, summons forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Golden Youths attendant upon incense, the Jade Maidens who scatter flowers and convey words, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two each in number. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to report to the Divine Lords of the Mystic Altar of the Heavenly Thearchs. Let them summon the local earth deities and territorial spirit-officials, that they may, in accordance with the present intent, receive the descent of the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure, flowing into our bodies. Thus shall the Purple Clarity’s luxuriance surge forth, and the Jade Towers blaze with brilliance. The Five Elders shall support the root, and the myriad thearchs shall gather the true. Bodies shall reflect the round pearl’s glow, riding the light to the imperial court. Golden radiance shall blaze resplendently, mounting qi to ascend the Upper Clarity. May the words I have uttered swiftly reach the August Presence beneath the Jade Towers of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Portal of the Supreme Limitless Dao.

*Each states their dharma-rank*

We, your humble servants, [Names] and others, with utmost sincerity jointly address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Supreme Limitless Dao and Most High Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Supreme Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and the Golden Portal of the Mystic Capital, the Seven Treasures, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm, and all the spirit-officials of the Three Realms.

We humbly recall that as the Dao’s workings unfold and the Primordial August One bestows transformation, the true and numinous manifest their blessings, and heaven and earth respond with auspicious signs. The two correct qi are rectified in the Upper Mystery, and the three calamities are stilled in the lower realms. Thus are all things harmonized and at peace, and all living beings receive blessings and protection. The household and state are universally tranquil, and the dark and hidden realms are universally benefited. We have long received the mysterious grace, bathed in its vast blessings. We have studied and borne the precious texts, perused the true canons. Following the Supreme’s great compassionate decree and the Heavenly Worthy’s universal deliverance, we aspire to establish modest merit to aid the great transformation. We deliver beings and rescue creatures, relieving distress and aiding the imperiled. We assist the state and serve the times, hoping to offer our sincere devotion. For all our words and petitions, dare we not make them known above?

*Reading the Petition*
As the words declare, we deeply cultivate and reverently serve.

May we beseech the sagely grace to dissolve calamities and misfortunes. With reverence, we prepare fragrant flowers and present the ritual offerings. Our hearts pledge before the Three Realms, our lives surrender to the hosts of heaven. Following the mysterious canons, we undertake the fast and vigil. We purify our minds, still our thoughts, kindle lamps, and burn incense. We perform the rites of the *Fahe Tu* for expiation and thanksgiving, adhering to the litanies of the Great One for supplication. Our sincerity hastens to the Golden Gates, our contemplation reaches the Jade Capital. May we attain resonance and receive manifest protection.

At this noon audience, as we perform the Dao, the assembly of ritualists now offers the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Dao-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Worthies of the Most High. May these merits flow to the imperial destiny and the august lineage, to the ancestral temples and the sagely succession. May the reign transcend the Three and Five, the Dao surpassing Fuxi and Shennong. May the sovereign roam the Purple Pole in spirit, repose in the Crimson Mound and shed his form. Ascending to the ranks of the perfected above, bestowing blessings upon the august lineage below. May the emperor’s longevity equal the Eight Seas, his radiance illumine the Two Effulgences. May Yao’s clouds broadly cover, Shun’s sun ever brighten. May the six palaces embody the rule of gentleness and compliance, the hundred officials uphold loyalty and steadfastness. May all directions be pure and prosperous, the four seas tranquil and orderly.

Now, as we burn incense, we take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtues of the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

At this noon audience, as we perform the Dao, the assembly of ritualists now offers the second pinch of incense.

May these merits flow to the family of the fast’s sponsor, to their karmic bonds through kalpas, their accumulated generations of kin. May the ninefold darkness of lingering attachments and the sevenfold ancestors’ spiritual forms ascend to the sagely hosts in the heavens, escaping the long night’s entanglements. May their transgressions be forever erased, their immortal ranks attained.

Even in the cold realms of the earth-prison, may all receive deliverance. May the Three Paths and Nine Nights all behold the light. May the world enjoy harmony and well-being, the land know no disasters or pestilence. May those dwelling in mountains and valleys attain the Dao and ascend to perfection.

Now, as we burn incense, we take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtues of the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

*Ritual Concludes*
*Confession and Repentance*

Each visualizes the nine-hued perfect image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret incantation to command demons. Stepping into the void, circling and weaving—
cloud-net steps ascend, celestial winds suddenly blow.
Sleeves flutter past the Dipper’s handle, whisk in hand they bow to the Banner of Stars.
Lions bear cinnabar tassels, qilin lead jade-green chariots.
Soaring through the eight poles, how often do spring branches bloom?
Green wings tower in crimson headbands, azure mists entwine feathered robes.
At dawn they hasten to the knot of solar virtue, by night they arrive at the moon’s radiant gate.
They grasp and play with the fires of the celestial sphere, then conceal and stir the earth’s mechanisms.
The Jade Chamber cannot detain them—they soar back toward the nine heavens.

Long ago in the Hall of Extended Grace, at midnight the Nine August Ones descended.
Six Perfected divided left and right, yellow mist coiled through the galleries.
Within the vast palace, the divine lords were revered; immortal soldiers guarded the Daoist sanctuary.
Now the filial descendant continues this vow, face-to-face with the numinous light in an instant.

**Three Bows**
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Most High Boundless Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Rank**
We, your humble servants, [names], respectfully reaffirm and address the Most High Boundless Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Most High Lord of the Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the boundless hosts of Dao and virtue, all sagely and perfected Celestial Worthies and Great Emperors; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Chancellors; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all divine officials and revered spirits of the Three Realms.

We have heard that when the Most High unfurled the charts, the myriad spirits received blessings.
When the Perfected expounded their grace, all beings flourished in glory.
The proper lodgings were measured by celestial reckoning, and calamities were stilled by earthly records.
Divine winds brought tranquility, and the hidden and manifest revived.

Moved by the urgency of disasters and decline, we earnestly seek purification through repentance.
We present offerings of incense, flowers, and ritual tokens, along with brocade and patterned silks.
We pledge our sincerity and offer our hearts, beseeching heaven to grant life.

Following the ritual codes, we have prepared the altar.
Burning incense and lighting lamps, we illuminate the Three Realms—
above, the boundless realms of the myriad heavens and the halls of eternal joy;
below, the deepest recesses of the nine earths and the darkest prisons of hell.
We deliver and liberate the suffering souls of countless kalpas.
May all karmic grievances of eons be universally absolved.
May the nine lineages receive deliverance and attain purity.

Then, may the disasters of stars, planets, sun, and moon—even the dark luminaries—be resolved above;
and may the afflictions of the nine palaces and regional calamities be eradicated below.
A thousand disasters and ten thousand transgressions, deep faults and grave errors—
through this repentance and prayer, may all be swept away.

**Supreme Vows**
May the Emperor enjoy boundless longevity, his reign enduring and prosperous.
May it be as steadfast as heaven and earth, as enduring as mountains and rivers.

May civil and military officials, near and far, fulfill their duties with integrity.
May the hundred offices be rightly ordered, the nine virtues duly observed.
May heaven be clear and earth serene, the nation prosperous and the people harmonious.
May sun and moon shine doubly bright, clouds and mists display five hues.
May weapons be sheathed, grain and harvests abundant.
May the Yellow River yield its ninefold charts, and mountains resound with ten thousand years.

**For the Disciple**
May the disciple [name] open the deliverance of the nine lineages, his entire clan secure and peaceful.
May he propagate loyalty and filial piety to transmit his household, embody benevolence and harmony to continue his legacy.
May all sentient beings, even those in the hidden and dark realms, each attain their proper place.

**For Ourselves**
May we perfect the six virtues and realize the three expedients.
May we dwell in valleys and cold retreats, attaining the fruit of perfection.
Above, may we manifest the great compassion of the Celestial Worthies;
below, may we fulfill our earnest devotion.

**Petitions**
We humbly present our plea.

**Vows**
First vow: May the Great Dao abide in tranquil emptiness, serene and still, dwelling in clarity.

Again, to the Fragrance Official Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Attendant Fragrance Spirits:
May this place where I offer incense naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs.
May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before the incense burner.
May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality.
May the patron of this retreat receive blessings, and may the hidden and manifest alike be graced with favor.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke,
Conveying the words I have just uttered swiftly to the August Presence beneath the Golden Portal and Jade Steps of the Supreme Non-Ultimate, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Great Dao.

Exiting the chamber.

**Dispelling Disasters and Conducting the Evening Dao Procession**

Entering the chamber. Each pays homage to the master, contemplating as prescribed.

**Guardian Spirits:**
The Golden Perfected descend in emptiness; divine tigers patrol the encampment.
The Jade Emperor dons auroral robes; the hosts of heaven command the numinous.
The Nine Dawns turn their chariots; the myriad demons bind their forms.
Ninefold radiance scatters smoke; divine might seizes essence.
Molten gold hurls flame; a hundred evils dissolve as one.
Divine splendor illumines the night; profound darkness yields to eternal spring.
The sagely Dao flows boundless; the ten directions stand solemn and pure.
Preserving the kalpa’s course, primordial harmony prevails—*yuan heng li zhen*.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

O Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi*, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the left and right envoys, the Incense-Attending Golden Youths, the Message-Conveying Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two each—to emerge.
Let those who emerge adorn themselves and report to the Celestial Thearchs of the Mysterious Altar. Let them urgently summon the local earth deities and true officials of this domain to ascend and make their report.
This servant now acts on behalf of the intent herein, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao *qi* and the wondrous light of the *Lingbao* descend and flow into the bodies of this assembly.
Thus shall the Mysterious Altar be purified, and inner and outer become true.
Let the heavens be free of defilement; let the earth be cleansed of demonic dust.
Let jade chimes resound; let the ten directions stand solemn and pure.
Let the myriad demons not intrude; let true sincerity ascend.
May the words this servant has uttered swiftly reach the August Presence before the Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Utmost True Jade August Thearch.

**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**

We, your humble servants, [names], with utmost sincerity jointly proclaim to the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous, the Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Celestial Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, the Golden Portal and Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the *Lingbao*’s Utmost True Radiant August Dao Lord, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all the true numina of the three realms’ official retinues:

We have heard that when the Five Vastnesses had yet to shine and the Three Numinous Ones first initiated the work of primordial function, the wondrousness of the undifferentiated had already been established.
When the prior earth and prior heaven were divided, the August Dao alone remained neither bright nor dim.
It first emerged among the multitudes of beings, thus endlessly transforming and tirelessly adapting to conditions.
Emperors and kings revered it to attain governance; dynastic fortunes relied on it for great peace.
Blessings return to the good; calamities and disasters naturally cease.
We early glimpsed the true standards and reverently received the numinous ordinances.
We aspire to establish meritorious deeds, aiding people and assisting the state.
Moreover, having received the imperial decree, how dare we not make this known above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the words of the petition state, our sincerity is earnest and our devotion profound.
We reverently uphold the Dharma tokens and solemnly open the altar.
May our transgressions be absolved; may disasters and misfortunes be dispelled.
As we ascend the altar to receive the Dharma and make our initial vows, may the Five Thearchs witness our covenant and the Three Officials attest to our sincerity.
Aiding the state and enacting transformation, salvation shall come first.
Thus do we dare to unfold and consult the mysterious scriptures, proclaiming the compassionate decrees.
Conducting the retreat and practicing the Dao, we emulate earth and model heaven.
We present the brocade of tenfold splendor; we exhaust our sincerity in prayer to the eight directions.
Hoping that through this red petition, our words may ascend to the Mysterious Void.

Tonight, as we conduct the evening Dao procession, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Utmost True *Dao* Treasure.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.
May this merit flow to the august spirits of our ancestral temples, to the enlightened ancestors of successive generations.
May they condense their spirits upon the cloud paths, transcending the constellations’ courses.
May they ride the Dipper’s handle to bestow auspiciousness, ascend the imperial chariot to manifest favor.
May jade charts and divine records align with the eternal heavens and earth.
May their blessings moisten the celestial waves, rivaling the depths of the abyssal seas.
May the emperor’s transformative influence be complete and decisive, his Dao harmonizing with non-action.
May he stand alongside the Three and Five, pointing to Mount Song and Mount Heng as eternal as they.
May his dominion embrace the myriad lands; may his chariot tracks unify all under heaven.
May inner and outer realms be harmonious and peaceful; may the constant norms be properly ordered.

Thus do we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts, the perfected and true virtues, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless.
Harmonizing with the Dao, we attain the true.

Tonight, as we conduct the evening Dao procession, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Utmost True *Scripture* Treasure.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.
May this merit flow to the disciple [name]’s household.
May their numinous essence endure for a hundred million generations; may the ninefold mysteries of the hidden be awakened.
May they transcend and ascend to the Northern Mansion, refining and transforming in the Southern Palace.
May they bathe in the flowing fire to partake in the true; may they enter the luminous clouds to realize the Dao.
May auspicious blessings descend; may all the living be universally graced.
Thus do we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts, the perfected and true virtues, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless.
Harmonizing with the Dao, we attain the true.

Tonight, as we conduct the evening Dao procession, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Utmost True *Master* Treasure.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.
May this merit flow to the disciple [name]’s household, their kin and relatives, the ninefold affines and sixfold clans.
May disasters be dispelled before they manifest; may blessings descend without limit.
May misfortunes be dissolved in purity; may calamities and miseries cease.
May longevity extend and emoluments endure; may misfortune vanish and blessings arise.
May all beings be universally graced; may the multitudes of billions be aided.
May they all tread the path of integrity and auspiciousness, universally partaking in felicity.
May the nine nights be illuminated; may the three paths be bright and clear.
May all under heaven be wholly saved; may all receive favor.
Thus do we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts, the perfected and true virtues, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless.
Harmonizing with the Dao, we attain the true.

**Paying Homage to the Directions**
**Repentance**

**Procession of the Void**

In circling steps, we revolve around the sacred register’s path of true cultivation;
With cinnabar sincerity, we offer our supplications to the heavens above.
Before the icy abyss, the multitudes stand poised;
Through vigilant dawn and dusk, we bring forth peace and well-being.
All things dissolve their afflictions and pestilence;
The three dawns manifest their auspicious signs.
The chant of the *Step of the Void* now resounds;
We further intone the *Profound Mystery’s* verses.
Gently unfolds the land of divine realms;
Majestically stands the altar of myriad wonders.
Crane-robed feathered adepts descend;
Duck-sandaled immortals alight as celestial officials.
Jade goblets pour the primal nectar;
Jasper caskets unveil the great elixir.
With utmost sincerity, how shall we pray?
May the four seas remain forever serene.
Water sprayed subdues the demonic palaces;
Lamps kindled illuminate the nocturnal courts.
The winds of the nine heavens fall silent;
The qi of the four extremities turns crystalline.
We chant and soar through the Vermilion Mound’s domain;
We wheel and glide above the White Jade Capital.
With utmost sincerity, how shall we pray?
May the nation’s fortune endure in eternal peace and glory.

**Threefold Reverence**
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost devotion and bow our heads in homage to the Supreme Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost devotion and bow our heads in homage to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost devotion and bow our heads in homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirmation of Dharma Ranks**
We, your humble servants, [names], now reverently reaffirm our address to:
The Supreme Boundless Dao of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin,
The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,
The Supreme Lord Lao,
The Perfected and Boundless Supreme Dao,
The Host of Sagely and Virtuous Heavenly Venerables,
The Celestial Emperors,
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm,
The High Ministers and Prime Chancellors,
The Four Directors and Five Emperors,
And all the revered numina of the Three Realms who respond to invocation.

We, your servants, receive transformation from the Supreme Mystery,
And are elevated in form within the Middle Land.
We revere and cultivate the supreme Dao,
And partake in the study of the numinous texts.

May we conceal our traces among cliffs and peaks,
And nest our spirits in the void and stillness.
We aspire to ascend and transcend,
To rise high and leave the dusty world behind.

Yet the Dharma permits the building of merit,
And the Dao takes precedence in aiding the state.
We ferry beings across and relieve the suffering,
Rescuing the distressed and upholding the imperiled.
We propagate the Heavenly Venerable’s compassion of salvation and protection,
And reveal the path for the multitudes to take refuge.

In Heaven above and Earth below,
All may attain what is fitting.

Your disciple [name], bound by adverse fate,
Is deeply troubled by peril and distress.
Wishing to present this petition through the proper channels,
I hope to convey my sincere prayers.

I pledge my heart with silk and brocade,
And offer incense and flowers as tokens of faith.
Looking up, I pray for the state and its people,
Extending blessings to both the living and the departed.

I repent and seek grace,
To dissolve calamities and invoke fortune.

Reflecting upon the consequences of past lives,
And the transgressions accumulated over countless kalpas—
Unawakened to the true and real,
Unmindful of precepts and statutes,
I have defied Heaven and violated Earth,
Piling grave errors upon deep faults.
Intentional killing, accidental harm,
New grudges and old debts,
Arising from the six senses,
Committed by the three karmic actions—
Boundless and immeasurable,
Beyond reckoning or recall.

The registers of the Nine Bureaus and Three Officials,
The courts of the Four Directors and Five Emperors—
Where sins are easily accrued,
And meritorious deeds are hard to establish.

The Seven Mysteries and Nine Netherworlds bear records of scrutiny,
While karmic debts from past lives carry registers of lingering misfortune.
Some suffer calamities from celestial omens and stellar transits,
Others face tribulations in their fateful years and cyclical fortunes.
The Nine Palaces bring punishment and severance,
The Eight Trigrams clash and obstruct.
The categories of yin and yang are boundless,
The profound mysteries of the divine Dao are unfathomable.
Thus, disasters and faults arise,
And my resolve to repent and pray is earnest.
I array the altar and invoke the descent of true sages,
Offering hearth incense to convey my sincerity,
Bowing in reverence and baring my heart.
I humbly beseech the exalted saints and venerated hosts to cast their radiant gaze in mercy.
May the thousand disasters and myriad tribulations all be swept away.
Above, I pray for the eternal prosperity of the state,
And the boundless virtue of the sovereign.
May the Five Planets follow their proper courses,
And the Two Luminaries shine with doubled brilliance.
May the passes and cities know no toil of garrison,
And the frontier fortresses be free from beacon fires of alarm.
May the Five Mountains and Eight Seas secure the four quarters,
And the steepest peaks and deepest waters submit to the transforming influence of virtue.
May auspicious clouds drift in vibrant hues,
And sweet dew condense in abundance.
May the year yield a bountiful harvest of fine grain,
And felicitous omens arrive day by day.
May I, your disciple, along with my nine ancestral generations and seven familial lines,
Ride the grace of blessings to roam freely;
May my five clans and six relations
Bathe in the divine favor and enjoy peace and prosperity.
May the borders be tranquil,
And weapons of war laid to rest.
May plagues and poisons vanish,
And malevolent forces be eradicated.
May the Nine Dark Hells of the underworld
Behold the compassionate light of the Most High;
May the sinful souls of the Six Realms
Receive the beneficent power of the Heavenly Perfected.
Together, may they all attain deliverance
And ascend to liberation.
May all beings—moving and still, flying and submerged—
Attain the eternal Dao.
Above, may the great mercy of the Heavenly Worthy be made manifest;
Below, may the sincerity of this disciple and assembly in repentance be fulfilled.
I respectfully present this petition for your hearing.

**Vows**
First, may the Great Dao flow freely, and all under heaven embrace virtue.
Second, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.
Third, may the sorrowful souls of the Nine Nights attain liberation at once.
Fourth, may the orphaned and unattached spirits all receive rebirth.
Fifth, may the world know peace, and the five grains ripen in abundance.
Sixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.
Seventh, may the four seas unite in harmony, and enmity and kinship be reconciled.
Eighth, may those concealed in wombs or encased in eggs all attain birth and growth.
Ninth, may chronic and recent ailments swiftly be healed.
Tenth, may the destitute and orphaned enjoy ample clothing and food.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**
Incense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits—
At this place where I offer incense,
May golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise.
May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones
Gather here before the incense burner.
May I, in seeking the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality.
May the patron of this retreat receive blessings,
And both the living and the departed partake in grace.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions,
Attending the orchid-scented smoke,
Convey my earlier petition
And swiftly deliver it to the Celestial Throne of the Most High, Boundless, Formless, Nameless,
Vacuous, and Spontaneous Great Dao.

**Exiting the Chamber**
Here concludes the twenty-eighth scroll of the *Rites of the Yellow Register Retreat of the Most High*.

**Scroll Twenty-Nine of the *Rites of the Yellow Register Retreat*
Revised by Tang Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting
Morning Dao-Observance for Repentance and Disease-Averting**

**Entering the Chamber**
Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

**Guardian Spirits**
Golden perfected ones and verdant mists
Radiate through the Three Heavens.
Crimson clouds traverse the cinnabar skies,
While the host of heavens reins in their chariots.
Dawn’s splendor dispels the gloom,
And shadows vanish at morning’s glow.
The Ninefold Subtleties shake the void,
As the Five Stars wheel in their courses.
Myriad immortals respond to the resonance,
In the mystery of spontaneity.
From the fathomless depths, light scatters,
And forms divide into billions.
Jeweled pearls gleam with brilliance,
Auspicious signs descend upon the altar’s domain.
The living and the dead receive grace,
Bathed in the refining springs of gold.
Demon kings tremble in fear,
As the Three Fields merge with the luminous.

**Strike the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi* of the Supreme Dao Lord,
Summon forth from within this servant’s body:
The Three and Five Merit Officers,
Left and right attendant messengers,
Incense-bearing golden youths,
Message-conveying jade maidens,
Five Emperors’ direct talismans,
And incense officials of the day—
Each in thirty-two ranks, now emerge.
As they depart, arrayed in solemn vestments,
They unlock the gates of the numinous altar,
Invoking the celestial deities and earthly gods of this land and domain.

This servant now humbly petitions:
May the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity Dao *qi* and Numinous Treasure
Descend and flow into our bodies,
That the words we now utter
Be swiftly conveyed to the Celestial Throne of the Most High, Boundless, Formless, Nameless,
Vacuous, and Spontaneous Great Dao.

**Each States Their Dharma Rank**
We, your humble servants, together in sincerity, reverently address
The Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
The Boundless Great Dao, Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,
The Most High Lord Lao,
The Jade Emperor of the August Heaven,
The perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,
The thirty-six Heavenly Lords,
The Jade Clarity Emperor,
The Great Emperor of the Jade Clarity,
The Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected,
The Golden Portal of the Mystic Capital, the Seven-Treasured Mystic Terrace,
The Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace,
The Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord,
The thirty-six divisions of the revered scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm,
And all the divine officials of the Three Realms.

We prostrate ourselves, having heard:
The movements of *qi* and celestial signs,
The manifest and hidden workings of yin and yang.
Rise and fall follow the cycles of fortune,
While waxing and waning mark the thresholds of blessing and calamity.
How much more so in this dusty world,
Where none escape the crucible of fate?
Yet the Three Worthies expound the teachings,
Bestowing the ordinances to save the living and deliver the dead;
The myriad sages extend their compassion,
Revealing the methods to rescue beings and succor the imperiled.
Their divine transformations widely spread,
Sheltering all living things.
We, having trodden the gateway of the Dharma,
Have early received the merciful instructions.
Thus, we ought to avert disasters and extricate hardships,
Praying for blessings upon the people.
To propagate the teachings and establish merit,
Thereby manifesting the profound mysteries.
Now, in obedience to the edict,
How dare we not make this known above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the words declare, our sincerity is urgent.
May the great protection be extended,
That our devout prayers be conveyed.

The retreat’s patron, [Name],
Has been stained by the six dusts,
Molded by the four great elements.
Water and fire vary in their abundance,
While darkness and light differ in their joy and sorrow.
At times, harmony is disrupted,
Suddenly giving rise to illness and misfortune.
Body and spirit race in panic,
Life and destiny hang in peril.
Only by knocking upon the gates of the true and numinous
May deliverance be hoped for.

We, your servants, reverently follow the ritual codes,
Arranging the altar’s precincts.
We bow our heads to implore grace,
Gazing heavenward to beseech the mandate.
At this early morning observance,
We, the assembled Dharma practitioners,
Now offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives,
Prostrating ourselves to the ground,
Relying upon the Three Worthies of the Most High.
May these merits and virtues
Flow to the emperor, the lord of the realm, and the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain.
May the phoenix’s records and dragon’s charts
Endure with heaven and earth;
May the imperial virtue and sagely influence
Shine as long as the sun and moon.
May wisdom illuminate the ten thousand directions,
And benevolence extend to the eight extremities.
May the heir apparent, the empress, and the consorts,
Along with the ministers within and without,
Together foster harmony and prosperity,
Bringing peace to the realm.
Within the eight limits of the world,
May rulers, ministers, officials, and people
All be overspread by boundless blessings,
And the whole earth bask in radiant peace.

Now therefore we kindle incense,
Taking refuge in the Perfected Virtue of the Great Sage Masters and the Host of the Most Real,
Who, having attained the Dao,
Ascend into the Formless.
Harmony unites with the True Dao.

On this morning audience in the Dao,
We, the ritual assembly, offer this second pinch of incense.
May its fragrant smoke ascend through the heavens,
Directly to present offerings to the Most High and Perfect Scriptural Treasure.
We prostrate ourselves, body and life,
Bowing our heads to the ground,
Relying upon the Three Worthies of the Most High.
May these merits and virtues
Flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so.
May the nine generations and seven lineages,
The hundred thousand myriad ancestors,
Kin and affinal relations,
And the departed spirits of the departed,
By the mysterious power of the Yellow Register,
Ascend to the Vermilion Mound’s immortal realm.
May their yang radiance refine their forms,
As fire tempers essence.
May their names be stricken from the Black Ledger,
And their registers inscribed in the Azure Palace.
In the carefree realm of the Real,
May they forever cast off the calamities of lingering afflictions;
May those yet living receive blessings,
And enjoy the fortune of peace and integrity.

Now therefore we kindle incense,
Taking refuge in the Perfected Virtue of the Great Sage Masters and the Host of the Most Real,
Who, having attained the Dao,
Ascend into the Formless.
Harmony unites with the True Dao.

On this morning audience in the Dao,
We, the ritual assembly, offer this third pinch of incense.
May its fragrant smoke ascend through the heavens,
Directly to present offerings to the Most High and Perfect Masterly Treasure.
We prostrate ourselves, body and life,
Bowing our heads to the ground,
Relying upon the Three Worthies of the Most High.
May these merits and virtues
Flow to the patron of this retreat, so-and-so,
That the disasters clinging to his person be dispelled,
And his misfortunes be stilled.
May illness and infirmity be healed,
And enmities be reconciled.
May the Lord of Life of Southern Prosperity
Open the Register of Life to prolong his years;
May the Imperial Lord of the Northern Office
Erase his name from the Black Book of Death.
May his hun-soul and shen-spirit be purified and rectified,
And his myriad qi endure forever.
May his kin and affinal relations
Together partake in this sublime blessing.
Whether soaring or sinking, of different natures or forms,
May all moving creatures
Bathe in this mysterious grace,
And together attain integrity and felicity.

Now therefore we kindle incense,
Taking refuge in the Perfected Virtue of the Great Sage Masters and the Host of the Most Real,
Who, having attained the Dao,
Ascend into the Formless.
Harmony unites with the True Dao.

The rites are complete;
We repent our transgressions.

Each visualizes the nine-hued spherical image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret incantation to command demons—thrice intoned:

*"I take the Dharma as my wife,
Cherish the sutras as pearls and jade.
Holding precepts to restrain the six senses,
Mindful of the Dao to dispel desires.
In purity, the true qi settles;
In serenity, the spirit grows still.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect—
Lifetimes of boundless fortune unfold.
Prosperous are the households and states,
Flourishing the scriptures and the Dao.
Heaven and humankind share this vow,
Ethereally entering the Great Vehicle.
By the heart’s resolve, the field of merit is sown;
The Dharma-wheel ascends in endless motion.
Seven generations ascend to celestial halls,
While this body soars in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the mysterious void—
With thought, nothing fails to align.
Refining the form to join the immortals,
Thus attaining the vajra-body.
Transcending the three realms’ tribulations,
The five hells’ sufferings are dissolved.
All return to the Most High’s sutras—
In stillness, we bow in reverence."*

Thrice we bow:
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Reaffirming the Dharma ranks:
We, your humble servants, [Names] and others, with unified devotion, reverently address the Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Boundless Great Dao and Virtue’s host of sages across the ten directions; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; and all the true numina of the three realms’ official retinues.

Having received the mystic ordinances and reverently upheld the compassionate teachings, we aid the times and assist the state, propagating the Dao to pacify the people.

Yet our traces mingle with the marketplace and court, our merits as light as dust and dew. Ever deepening our vigilance and fear, we dare not rest in ease. Yet the Dharma demands propagation, and duty calls first to deliverance and salvation.

Now the patron of this retreat, [Name], pressed by calamitous celestial omens and assailed by illness and distress, grieves as if life were a flickering candle, his very existence imperiled. Today, he lays bare his heart to plead for life, prostrating at the gate of the Dharma. We, your servants, accordingly follow the luminous ordinances, conducting this retreat and performing the Dao. We inscribe the petitions, enumerate the transgressions, and offer repentance for both the living and the dead.

We fear that through nine generations, karmic misfortunes have flowed and accumulated; that in past lives and former ages, grievances have knotted and congealed. Perhaps in resolve or thought, he has transgressed against hidden virtue; or in emotion or intent, failed to align with the numinous. Past faults and former errors, hidden sins and manifest transgressions—all these causes and conditions, layer upon layer, have woven this disaster and peril.

We further fear that in the three destinies and five phases, the nine palaces and eight trigrams, the celestial patterns and stellar constellations, the revolutions of fate and the cycles of years, baleful influences have descended, and stars have cast their baleful light. Perhaps his life’s allotment is meager, his fortune weak; or he has incurred old slayings, unintended harms, new grievances, or past debts. Or perhaps the qi of the five pestilences and hundred poisons, or the followers of malevolent spirits and demonic attachments, have assailed him—externally penetrating his skin and flesh, internally invading his viscera and bowels—giving rise to this grave illness, which has yet to be cured or dispelled.

We humbly beseech the Most High to bestow mercy, and the Three Luminaries to absolve his sins. May all karmic enmities be dissolved, all disasters and misfortunes harmonized and released. For sins without limit across past lives and this present existence, we now offer repentance and supplication, praying that all be forgiven and erased. May his true qi flow freely, his numinous fluids spread and moisten. May the hundred afflictions be purged, the six palaces attain peace. May his allotted blessings increase in abundance, his years extend in longevity. May his entire household enjoy fortune, and both inner and outer realms be graced with prosperity.

Above, we pray for the tranquility of the altars of soil and grain, and the eternal life of the emperor. May wind and rain be timely and harmonious, the years abundant, and the times prosperous. May all sentient beings with consciousness ascend to the realm of longevity.

May the great compassion of the Most High Heavenly Venerable shine above, and may our sincerity in prayer and repentance be met below. We reverently present this petition for your hearing.

**Invocation of Intentions**

First intention: For the Dao, the four great elements unite in virtue. May the patron’s seven generations of parents be freed from sorrow and suffering, ascend to the heavenly halls, and enjoy sustenance as natural as the Dao itself.

Second intention: For the emperor and sovereign, may the transformative power of the Dao flourish and prosper. May the schools and academies thrive, the imperial teachings expand in grandeur. May their majesty and dignity be revered by all under heaven. May the people praise the era as one of great peace, and the four barbarians submit in awe. May evil and malevolence vanish of their own accord, and worthy individuals arise daily.

Third intention: For the Dharma Master, may great merit and virtue be established. May their teachings be luminous and far-reaching, and may they together attain the flight of immortals.

Fourth intention: For fellow aspirants and disciples, may they swiftly attain the Dao of immortality and mutually guide one another to liberation.

Fifth intention: For the nine relations, may harmony prevail. May they esteem benevolence and righteousness, honor the Dao and disdain wealth, and serve as models for all beings.

Sixth intention: For selfless giving, may offerings be made to Daoist masters and those who suffer from hunger and cold. May all people under heaven find their rightful place.

Seventh intention: For all creatures that creep and crawl, may every sentient being attain fulfillment and completion.

Eighth intention: For the absolution of past lives’ sins and present-life karmic retributions, may merits be established to redress transgressions.

Ninth intention: For the prosperity of family and state, may ancestral temples be tended by worthy descendants, and generations give rise to sages and talents.

Tenth intention: For reverence toward the master and scriptures, may we never falter in diligence, maintaining a mind of equanimity. May all beings be broadly delivered, and may we together attain the rank of immortals, ascending to heaven in broad daylight to pay homage to the Most High. May we forever become perfected beings, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages, harmonizing with the Dao to become true. **The incense burner is sealed.**

To the Incense Official Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Incense Spirits: May the place where this incense is offered naturally give rise to golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. May this disciple study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality. May the patron receive blessings, and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, who attend the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly convey the words just uttered to the August Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Supreme Dao of Boundless Vastness.

Each pays homage to the master, contemplating as prescribed.

**Guardian of the Numinous**
Chanting the empty and cavernous, the Lord of the Altar stands guard.
The Five Emperors review records, receiving talismans from the Three Officials.
The four gates are secured, binding demons and expelling treachery.
Flaming bells are cast, impurities burned, and remnants purged.
The body bears the golden script, refining the elixir and rejuvenating the countenance.
Merging with the mysterious and plain, the heart stirs the three barriers.
Riding lions and cranes, mounting dragons and phoenixes.
The stars guard their stations, a thousand demons dare not intrude.
The Dao and qi endure, the myriad immortals rest in peace.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
O Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin, Supreme Dao Lord: Summon forth from within this disciple’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attending Messengers, the Golden Youths of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Two Incense Officials of the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans and Daily Spirits. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to report to the Divine Lords of the Mysterious Altar and the Heavenly Emperor. Let them now invoke the local earth deities and true officials of this domain.

This disciple now offers prayers with utmost sincerity: May the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity’s Dao qi and Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies. May the altar within and without be purified and made true. May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth cleansed of demonic dust. May the jade chimes resound, the ten directions be solemn and clear. May the myriad demons not intrude, and may true sincerity ascend. May the words just uttered swiftly reach the August Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Supreme Dao of Boundless Vastness.

**Each declares their dharma rank**
We, your humble disciples of such-and-such rank, together with utmost sincerity, reverently address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord of the Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, the great sage hosts and perfected lords of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Flower, Southern Ultimate, Western Numinous, and Northern True Lords of the Mysterious Capital, the Golden Portal, the Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all responsive and perceptive numinous beings of the three realms.

We prostrate ourselves, having heard that the wondrous and marvelous origin, vast and transformative, preceded the emperors; the supreme and ultimate honored one, whose mysterious merit extends beyond all things. Though yin and yang rise and fall, and kalpas begin and end, it remains serene and constant, majestic and self-sustaining. Thus, the three thousand luminous realms all submit to its divine grace; the five hundred million celestial gates together attain its Dao transformation.

As fortune and misfortune alternate, and blessings and calamities shift, all may be dispelled by its sagely power, washed clean by its numinous grace. It rescues the imperiled, saves all beings, assists the state, and transforms the people. For ten thousand ages, it has been revered, its responses unfailing.

Now, bearing our petitions and presenting our pleas, we humbly seek its favor. Whatever we pray for, by principle, should be reported. Having received these words, how dare we not make them known above?

**Reading the Petition**
In accordance with the sincerity of these words, deeply do we knock and pray. Disciple So-and-so, afflicted by the interplay of yin and yang, harmed by cold and heat, bows in reverence, baring his heart, earnestly seeking protection.

We, your disciples, reflect that the Heavenly Worthy, ever compassionate, constantly saves all beings. Raising the Dharma raft to ferry across the sea of delusion, suspending the jewel to gather all beings. Proclaiming the precepts and expounding the teachings, warding off distress and aiding the imperiled.

Thus, we purify our thoughts and cleanse our hearts, performing the retreat and practicing the Dao. We pray that your sagely power may dispel calamities and obscurations.

Today, at the noon audience, we conduct the Dao ritual. The Dharma assembly now offers the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most High and Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, reverently relying upon the Three Honored Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow to the august spirits of the altars and ancestors, to the former sages of our lineage. May they ascend to the eight luminous realms, merge with the nine purities. Gazing upon the great void, may they bestow blessings upon the great enterprise.

May the emperor embody the virtue of Yao, establishing the ultimate, succeeding Yu and inheriting the mandate. May he illumine the golden mirror in the purple court, turning the jade balance in the azure heavens. May the star of longevity shine ever brighter, the mountain of fortune grow ever loftier. May the empress and consorts assist in transforming the six palaces, and the ministers and aides secure the myriad domains. May radiance spread through the realm of the Dao, and harmony be perfectly achieved through non-action.

For this, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts and perfected virtues of our masters. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

Today, at the noon audience, we conduct the Dao ritual. The Dharma assembly now offers the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most High and Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, reverently relying upon the Three Honored Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow to the household of disciple So-and-so. May the nine generations and seven lineages, the myriad ancestors and hundredfold forebears, depart from the courts of the dark netherworld, leave the courts of eternal night. May their karmic nets be dissolved, their blessings and auspices gather abundantly. Even those in the springs’ sealed chambers and the flying and moving beings of other realms—may all receive the blessings of good fortune and be universally delivered.

For this, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts and perfected virtues of our masters. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action. We harmonize with the Dao to become true.

Today, at the noon audience, we conduct the Dao ritual. The Dharma assembly now offers the third pinch of incense.

May this incense smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Master-Treasures. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the earth, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits and virtues flow to the disciple So-and-so’s person. May calamities be washed away, and misfortunes be dissolved. Past grievances and old debts, through repentance and prayer, be wholly eradicated; deep-seated transgressions and hidden blemishes, through the fragrance of cultivation, be purified. May malevolent forces be stilled, and years of fortune be prolonged.

For this, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts and perfected virtues of our masters. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action. We harmonize with the Dao to become true.

We bow in ritual, repent, and reflect. Envisioning the nine-colored perfect image, we swallow saliva and recite the secret incantation against demons. Stepping in emptiness, we circumambulate:

The azure canopy of Primordial Qi unfurls,
Golden incense forms pearl-like smoke.
The flying dawn gathers reins as one,
Bowing before the Jade Emperor’s presence.
His heart vast and at ease, he bestows upon us the *Tai Ling Pian*.
This is the indestructible Dao,
By which the myriad heavens uphold our authority.
We traverse the hollow void,
While lower immortals grope in its depths.
The One Qi transforms the primordial origin,
Vastly preceding the Two Modes.
Precious ramparts race golden steeds,
True incense sprays from jade lotuses.
Soaring through space, we rein in dragon steeds,
While Brahmanic chants guide the divine chariot.
Through endless kalpas of eternal spring,
We soar in the formless heavens.
The mysteries of the Initial Perfected are hard to fathom,
Thus we admonish the immortals within the precepts.
The exalted Perfected illuminate virtue and the Dao,
Bequeathing to the world the *Five Thousand Words*.
Though our explanations are meager and shallow,
We exhaust our sincerity to fathom the wondrous origin.
Rainbow banners adorn the sacred canons,
Feathered hymns resound through cloud-borne chariots.
Auspicious cranes hover in the sky,
Propitious winds dispel summer’s heat.
The vault of heaven responds to these sounds,
Bestowing a reign of countless years.

We perform the Three Bows:
With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Reaffirming our ranks, we, the humble disciples So-and-so, respectfully re-present our supplication to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement; the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Aides; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; the Right and Left Perfected Ones of the Orthodox Unity; the Supreme Perfected Purple Void Primordial Lady of the Southern Peak; and all the divine officials and hosts of the Three Realms.

We humbly recall: when the Heavenly Origin established the supreme pole and the Earthly Principle marked the pivot, riding the wondrous Dao to differentiate forms and fixing the Two Modes to set forth images, their vast embrace knew no bounds, their sheltering power was inexhaustible. Yet the cycles of nine and six bring changes of ascent and descent; the alternations of decline and prosperity mark the passage of kalpas. How much more so for human kind—how could they be free from decline and decay?

Disciple So-and-so, dwelling in the worldly net and stained by the dusty realm, is constrained by qi and phenomena, struck by fortune and misfortune. Thus, he is entangled in illness and misfortune, ever more deeply beset by worry and peril. We fear that in past lives and this existence, karmic blemishes remain unwashed, old grievances and accumulated transgressions, debts and disputes, are yet unresolved. Perhaps through intentional killing or accidental harm, he has incurred misfortune and blame. Or through the stars and his natal destiny, he has suffered evil and calamity. His form and fate are humble and fragile—there is nowhere to turn for repentance and prayer.

Therefore, we lay bare our hearts to the Great Dao, prostrating ourselves before the Mystic Code. We establish the altar and humbly offer repentance and gratitude. Following the rank and protocol of the Heavenly Master, we initiate the first ritual document. In accordance with the Purple Void Primordial Lady’s method of repentance for calamities, we now petition on behalf of So-and-so:

We summon the Heavenly Prosperity Lord and one hundred thousand Yellow-Clad Soldiers to gather and remove all inauspicious influences, the twelve criminal and deadly qi, from within and without the disciple’s household.

We further summon the Southern Palace Heavenly Bright Lord and the Northern Star Six Mechanisms Lord to collect the five pestilences, hundred poisons, and hundred illnesses.

We summon the Feng-Li Lord and the Red Plain Lord to eliminate the disciple’s ailments of the heart, abdomen, and urinary obstructions.

We summon the Heavenly Official Five Balances Lord, the Earthly Official Five Balances Lord, the Nine Rivers Northern Sea Lord, the Kingly Law Lord, the Nine Assemblies Lord, the Great Official Yang Order Lord, the Southern Superior Lord, the Momentary Lord, and the Stone Immortal Lord to expel all inner and outer demonic afflictions causing illness.

We summon the Heaven-Covering Great General and the Upper Prime Officer Lord to capture and subdue all malevolent deceased spirits, averting misfortune and inviting blessings.

We summon the Earth-Restraining Lord and the Four Hu Lords to dispel the calamities of the disciple’s current year and natal destiny, severing the qi of deceased spirits’ influences.

We summon the Qi-Moving Calamity-Dissolving Lord, the Supreme High Granary Lord, the Supreme Heavenly Lord, and the Level Heaven Lord to dissolve and remove the ghosts of death, mourning, punishment, harm, and the five graves.

We summon the Numinous Plain Heavenly Essence Lord, the Red Heaven Qi-Consuming Lord, and the Spirit-Gathering Upper Bright Lord to sever the disciple’s nightmares, malevolent ghosts, and the qi of lingering illnesses.

May the twenty-four divisions of heavenly officials and soldiers descend in timely fashion to punish evil, extinguish malevolence, and subdue inauspicious influences. May true qi secretly aid him, granting peace and well-being. May his dreams and waking be upright, his lifespan prolonged. May his nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and his six relations receive blessings. May dragon spirits guard and protect him, his dwelling secure and tranquil.

Above, we pray that the imperial Dao shines resplendently, the Heavenly Origin be bright and serene. May weapons of war be forever stilled, wind and rain arrive in due season. May grain and crops be abundant, the hidden and manifest realms harmonious. May all beings be universally included, even those in the darkest chambers. May all together bathe in the profound grace and together attain the realm of blessings. May the luminous Heavenly Worthy’s vast compassion respond to our humble repentance and supplication.

We respectfully present this entreaty.

We now make our vows:

First, may the Great Dao be serene and empty, tranquil and still, dwelling in clarity and purity. May it widely open the gates of the Dharma, instructing the stubborn and foolish. May all receive its beneficent grace and cultivate with diligence. May we, together with our fellow students, universally ascend to the void, preserving our union with heaven, abiding forever without care.

Second, may the myriad heavens condense their qi and become clear. May the high void broadly shelter, preserving the true and securing the numinous. May the climate be harmonious, the four seasons balanced. May the nation be secure, the people prosperous, and all under heaven be at peace. May all beings be universally aided, and its beneficence extend to all life. May the heavens be preserved for countless kalpas, never to collapse.

Third, may the earth bear and sustain without end.

May the earth remain stable and unshaken, the seas calm and uncollapsed. May it safeguard and secure the state and family, and the myriad people flourish in harmony. May it nurture life and grant peaceful death, its beneficence extending to the ten directions. May crops and grains flourish, and daily sustenance abound. May all receive its abundant support, and the myriad beings follow in accord.

Fourth, may the sun and moon, the two luminaries, stand high and bright. May they know no sudden eclipses, their waxing and waning serene and clear. May their light illumine all heavens, dissolving the deepest darkness. May they preserve the kalpas’ course, and the world’s destiny be at peace. May their moistening grace universally extend, showering blessings upon all beings.

Fifth, may the stars and constellations shine with the same radiance as the sun. May their revolving brilliance illuminate, casting clear light in the ten directions. May each abide in its proper place, their paths straight and true. May they safeguard and secure the state and family, sparing them from harm and disaster. May the four seas be at peace as one, and all under heaven flourish.

Sixth, may the four seasons follow their appointed cycles. May their climates be harmonious and balanced, free from calamity and misfortune. May pestilence and plague be eradicated, and all under heaven dwell in peace. May the five grains ripen in abundance, the nation prosper, and the people rejoice.

Seventh, may floating clouds condense their qi and gather their mists. May they soar high and clear in the heavens, casting their shadow over the profound and mysterious. When concealed, they act without contrivance; when dispersed, they fill the sky. May immortals and transcendents dwell together, befriending the host of perfected beings. May their beneficence flow to all, fostering the nation and cherishing the people. May they universally aid all beings, and humanity endure as long as the kalpas.

Eighth, may wind and rain flow and shower without end. May they universally bestow their bounty, nurturing growth and flourishing. May the myriad things thrive, the nation’s stores be full, and the people abundant.

Ninth, may the Five Peaks each abide in their proper place. May they tower majestically, ever serving as immortal palaces. May they secure the nation’s destiny, preserving heaven without end. May they protect and deliver all beings, none who do not look to them in reverence.

Tenth, may the rivers and seas stretch boundlessly. May they contain and embrace all with vastness, nurturing even the smallest of things. May their depths be profound and their kindness gentle, moistening all that wriggles and breathes. May heaven and humanity receive blessings, their years enduring like the kalpas’ stone.

Eleventh, may the emperor and the kingdom prosper day by day. May the four frontiers be at peace, and weapons of war not be raised. May heaven and humanity sing in praise, and auspicious omens come soaring. May teachings be widely spread, and virtuous transformation overflow. May the myriad people rejoice, and boundless joy never end.

Twelfth, may all creatures—those that fly, crawl, and move, whether born or yet unborn—universally receive safety. May all attain life and growth. May they all behold the primordial qi and receive the form of yang. May grasses, trees, fruits, and forests endure winter without withering. May all be delivered and aided, none that do not flourish in fresh splendor. May harmony unite with the Dao and merge with the true. The furnace is restored.

May the Fragrant Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all spirit-officials attendant upon the incense ensure that where I offer this fragrance, golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise. May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here before the incense burner. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the patron of this retreat receive blessings, and may the living and the departed alike be touched by grace.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly conveying my supplications directly to the Throne of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Dao—formless, nameless, empty, and spontaneous—in the Golden Palace of Jade. The door is opened.

*Repentance and Exorcism for Illness, Circumambulation at Dusk*

The door is entered. Each pays homage to the master and contemplates as prescribed.

The radiance of the guardian spirits shines brightly, auspicious qi swirls in coils. The Dipper and the Ladle gleam with pure light, the halls of mushrooms stand serene. Jade pupils and golden perfected ones, the precious altar is wholly yang. Night is transformed into day, the hour is turned back to before noon. Mount Taihua streams with color, the cinnabar phoenix soars upon the axle. Demons are stilled, treachery is extinguished, one strides high through the mist of blessings. Heavenly perfected ones gather together, all arriving before the Emperor. The dharma drum is sounded twenty-four times.

The Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, First Three Qi, Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two of each—let them emerge. As they emerge, let them solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar to the Heavenly Thearch and Divine Lords, and summon the local earth gods and territorial true officials. This servant now, acting on behalf of the intent herein, prays that the wondrous light of the Jade Purity Dao Qi and Numinous Treasure may descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and company, thereby rendering the Mysterious Altar pure and transforming both inner and outer into truth. Let the heavens be free of defilement, the earth purged of demonic dust. Let the chiming of jade resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear. Let the myriad demons not intrude, true sincerity ascend above. May the words this servant utters swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Gate Jade Steps of the Great Dao.

Each declares their dharma rank:
In reverent unity, we, your servants, humbly address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Great Dao Supreme Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Gate, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity, Upper Palace, Numinous Treasure, Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all the true numina of the Three Realms.

We, your servants, have heard that the undifferentiated gives rise to form, the True One congeals into light. Heaven and earth rely upon it for their inception, yin and yang operate through it for generation and transformation. Flourishing and decline alternate, good and evil intertwine. The sun and moon have their times of waning and decline, cold and heat have their cycles of advance and retreat. Only this Great Dao pervades the hidden and manifest. It extends blessings and bestows grace, broadly aiding all existence. We, your servants, early explored the true instructions and obtained a glimpse of the numinous charts. The Three Caverns’ jade cases contain rites of prayer and exorcism; the Nine Heavens’ golden tablets transmit texts of salvation and protection. For forty thousand kalpas they have been expounded, by five hundred million heavens they are revered. They subdue demonic evil and summon demonic spirits. They assist the state in establishing merit, deliver beings and save things. When there is something to be prayed for, how dare we not make it known above?

Recitation of the Petition:
Following the words of the petition, we are truly sincere and earnest. Disciple So-and-so, with disasters yet unceased and illnesses yet unalleviated, surrenders his life to the various heavens and lays bare his heart to the Great Dao. He requests to perform the fast and vigil, to invite the descent of numinous power. Thus, with cinnabar sincerity, he together hopes for mysterious protection. Tonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the first pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to the Emperor and the august personages of the nine ancestral temples. May they ascend in splendor to the Three Purities, bestowing auspiciousness upon the myriad states. May the great foundation be firmly established, the phoenix calendar eternally flourishing. May the Crown Prince and various princes steadfastly support the great enterprise. May the empresses, consorts, and all officials assist in the sagely plans. May the tracks of carts be as one, the ladders and ships all gather. For this reason, we now burn incense and personally take refuge in the Great Sage Hosts, the Perfected and Virtuous Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as truth.

Tonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the second pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.

We, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this fast, the household of So-and-so. May the nine ancestors and seven generations, the obscured and lingering spirits, transcend the earthly dust and ascend to the celestial thoroughfares. May litigation be stilled at the gates of darkness, blessings and auspiciousness flow to future descendants. May the Nine Yous and earthly prisons all behold the light of compassion. May the beings of the six destinies together ascend to the realm of goodness. For this reason, we now burn incense and personally take refuge in the Great Sage Hosts, the Perfected and Virtuous Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as truth.

Tonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the third pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.

We, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to disciple So-and-so’s person. May karmic debts be pacified, disasters and calamities dissolved. May inauspicious declines melt like ice, illnesses and misfortunes disperse like clouds. May the Southern Dipper extend life, the Eastern Palace register blessings. May all kin and dependents, universally including humans and heavens, together enjoy the good merit and all attain the realm of the Dao.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense and surrender ourselves in refuge to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters, whose virtue is most true. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into the realm of non-action, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the Real.

We bow in the four directions, repent, and pace the void. As we circumambulate, our steps trace the celestial net; the heavenly winds blow swiftly upon us. Our fluttering robes rise to the handle of the Dipper, while we hold the fly-whisk and bow to the Banner of the Three Stars. Lions bear vermilion tassels, and qilins lead jade-green chariots. Flying through the eight extremities, how often have we seen the spring branches burst forth? Verdant temples crown crimson headbands, and azure mists entwine our feathered robes. At dawn we hasten to the Hall of Solar Virtue; by night we arrive at the Gate of Lunar Splendor. We strike and play with the fires of the celestial sphere, and the soaking rains awaken the earth’s mechanisms. The Jade Chamber cannot retain us—we soar instead toward the ninefold heavens.

Once, in the Hall of Extended Grace, at midnight, the Nine August Ones descended. The Six Perfected divided left and right, while yellow mists coiled around the balustrades. Within the vast palace, the divine lords were revered, and celestial soldiers guarded the Dao sanctuary. Today, as filial descendants, we continue this resolve, standing but a foot’s span from the numinous radiance.

With threefold prostration, we, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Supreme, Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.
We, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Reverently addressing the ranks of the Dharma, we, your servants, So-and-so and others, humbly reaffirm our supplication to the Supreme, Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate, the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Venerable Perfected of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Dao and Virtue; the Celestial Thearchs and Great Emperors; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all the divine officials and numinous spirits of the Three Realms.

We bear the precious script upon our persons, ever ashamed of the divine grace bestowed. Privately delving into the profound mysteries, our aspiration lies in spreading the light of yang. We seek to establish merit through transformation, broadly benefiting all beings. Disciple So-and-so, beset by inauspicious fate and afflicted by illness, presents this petition with utmost sincerity, praying for blessings. We request the elevation of this fast and the invocation of the true numina. Thus, we respectfully follow the canonical rites, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao.

First, we repent for disciple So-and-so’s transgressions, both past and present, which are deep and grievous. Some offend the benevolence of heaven and earth’s nurturing embrace; others betray the virtue of the sun and moon’s illumination. We have violated the nature of the two qi and five phases, harmed the harmony of the three luminaries and six regulations. Unresolved karmic debts from the past compound with newly accrued sins. We have caused harm through error and killing, indulging our wills and following our hearts. Ignorant of causes and conditions, heedless of prohibitions and taboos, moved by the six emotions, and acting through the three karmas, we have transgressed against the unseen and the manifest, contravened the teachings of the scriptures. Thus, we incur these retributions and construct these calamities.

We further fear having offended the dragon spirits by initiating construction on earth and wood, violating geomantic principles and contravening celestial timing. We dread the influences of the stellar lodges and the afflictions of yearly cycles, the clashes of the Nine Palaces and the conflicts of the Eight Trigrams. Obstruction runs deep, and our anxieties are acute. Therefore, we now perform this fast and practice the Dao, repenting for our transgressions. We kindle incense, recite scriptures, and pray to heaven to petition for life. May all calamities, sins, and faults be repented and eradicated. May the Great Unity extend life, and the Three Primes avert death. May the Jade Lads dispense medicine, and the Five Emperors bestow talismans. May the six viscera be harmonized, and the hundred passages flow freely. May longevity be prolonged and emolument endure, misfortune vanish and fortune arise.

We further pray that the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and the six relations receive protection. May those who soar and those who sink fulfill their natures, and all beings, moving and still, be secure. Above, we wish for the imperial enterprise to flourish, heaven to endure and earth to last. May martial prowess be stilled, and civil virtue be consummated. May the sun’s wisdom shine doubly bright, and rivers float with sagely grace. May linked pearls and conjoined jades once more be seen in the dark heavens; may the Eight Trigrams and Nine Categories be re-revealed in the limpid Luo. May the three agricultural seasons proceed in order, and the nine grains know no fault. May drought and flood not arise, and pestilence not occur. May weapons be forever sheathed, and wind and rain come in due season.

Extending to the hidden paths, may all sentient beings be universally included. May the ministers of yin and yang, the officials of mountains and rivers, propagate the Dao and pacify the people, punish the perverse and protect the upright. May all ascend the shore of fortune and together attain the stages of the Dao.

May the vast compassion of the Heavenly Venerable above be manifest, and may the sincere devotion of your servants below be answered.

We make our vows:
First, may heaven and earth be bright and pure.
Second, may the atmosphere be clear and mysterious.
Third, may the sage live ten thousand years.
Fourth, may transformation reach the eight boundaries.
Fifth, may heaven bestow sweet dew.
Sixth, may earth emit auspicious mists.
Seventh, may the four seasons follow their course.
Eighth, may the myriad things be born whole.
Ninth, may families abound in filial piety and fraternal duty.
Tenth, may the state teem with talent and worthies.
Eleventh, may the officiants of this rite obtain blessings.
Twelfth, may those who study the Dao attain immortality.

We replenish the incense burner. May the Incense Officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and the various spirit officials of the incense attend to where we present this incense, naturally generating golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred numinous perfected gather here before the incense burner. May we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May the sponsor of this fast receive blessings, and the living and deceased partake of grace. May the words we have uttered swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Dao, the Celestial Venerable of the Origin, in the Golden Portal and Jade Steps of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous.

The ritual concludes.

**Guardian Spirits**
The Golden Perfected and Green Radiance illumine the Three Heavens.
Crimson clouds traverse the cinnabar skies, as the host of heavens reins their chariots.
Dawn’s splendor dispels the shadows of yin, all darkness cast away.
The Ninefold Subtlety shakes the void, the Five Stars wheel in revolution.
Myriad immortals respond to the resonance, spontaneously wondrous and mysterious.
In the profound obscurity, light scatters—forms divide into billions.
Jeweled pearls radiate brilliance, auspicious signs descend upon the altar’s northwest.
The living and dead receive grace, bathed and refined in the golden spring.
The Demon Kings tremble in fear, their shadows merging with the Three Fields.

*Strike the Dharma Drum twenty-four times*

O Supreme Mysterious Origin, Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body:
the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys,
the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens who transmit words and scatter flowers,
and the Thirty-Two Incense Officials of the Five Emperors, the Direct Talismans, and the Day-Officials.
Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to open the gates of the Mysterious Altar’s Celestial Emperor and Divine Lords.
Summon the local earth deities and territorial true officials of this place.
May the numinous treasure-light of Jade Purity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous radiance descend,
flowing into our bodies, so that our supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Dao—
the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous—before the Golden Portal and Jade Steps.

*Each states their dharma rank*

We, your humble servants, together with utmost sincerity, reverently address the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin,
the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,
the Supreme Lord Lao,
the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven,
the perfected and divine lords and venerable sages of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,
the thirty-six Celestial Lords,
the Jade Purity Emperor,
the Jade Emperor the Great Emperor,
the Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital and Golden Portal,
the Seven-Treasured Mysterious Terrace and Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace,
the Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord,
the Five Elderly Emperors,
the Lords of the Three Primordials,
the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
the thirty-six revered scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
and all the true numina of the three realms’ official retinues.

We have heard that before heaven and earth existed, the Primordial Origin spread the transformation of non-action;
at the dawn of the primordial chaos, the Perfected Ones bequeathed the statutes of vast salvation.
Thus, the configurations of qi were divided among the Three Primordials,
and boundless compassion was disseminated to the myriad beings.
The Three Officials were commanded to examine and assess,
while the Five Emperors were entrusted to govern.
Punishment and reward are impartial, grace and blessings extend afar.

We, having long received the shelter of the Dao, now encounter this auspicious conjunction of the mysterious.
We have studied the precious texts and perused the numinous mysteries,
resolved to propagate the great transformation and aid the state and its people.
On the eight festivals and Three Primordials, establishing merit is fundamental.
Now, as this Primordial’s seasonal rite arrives, on this propitious day of fasting and purification,
we offer thanks for transgressions and pray for grace—it is fitting to present our devout entreaties.
Moreover, as we uphold the imperial edict, how dare we not make this known above?

*Read the petition*

In accordance with the petition’s words, our resolve to cultivate and serve runs deep.
Moreover, as this season’s rite arrives, we reverently perform the numinous scriptures.
The Luminous Statutes of the Supreme Ultimate record the ledgers of faults in the Nine Bureaus;
the canonical standards of the Mysterious Capital designate the Three Primordials as the great period of amnesty.
The merit of the fast extends afar to the living and deceased,
while its beneficent influence flows broadly to family and state.

We, having joined together, have established the altar.
With lamps, candles, incense, and flowers, we pledge our hearts to the three realms.
With silk and ritual offerings, we present our petitions to the myriad heavens.
We hope that the Great Dao will achieve perfect communion,
gazing upon our sincerity to bestow blessings;
that the Perfected Ones will respond in mystery,
following our repentance to shed their radiance.

May the flying celestial beings bear the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands,
traversing the three realms to notify the four bureaus.
May they record the merit of this fast and attest to our earnest prayers.

Now, at this morning’s Dao procession, we, the assembly of ritualists,
kindle this first pinch of incense.
May its fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves,
looking up to rely on the Three Supreme Ones.
May this merit flow to the august spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral sages of the ancestral temples.
May they ascend to the Golden Portal of Perfection and wander in the Jade Capital.
May they attend the Sacred Ancestor in the Upper Palace and bestow blessings upon the precious descendants.

May the Emperor’s lifespan rival Penglai’s immortals, his achievements match those of Shun and Yu.
May he harmonize the jade candle to pacify Hua and Yi,
and solemnize the pearl’s orbit to still heaven and earth.
May the six palaces’ consorts and empresses possess inner virtue, reverent and enlightened.
May the Crown Prince and various princes flourish like jade branches.
May the civil and military ranks alike incline their hearts toward loyalty and filial piety;
may the four seas and ten thousand directions together blend under the transformative power of unified governance.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

On this morning audience, as we perform the Dao rites, we invite the dharma assembly to offer this first pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to present offerings to the supreme and most true scriptural treasures. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this retreat, such-and-such household—may their nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of kin, their three masters and four companions, depart the dark night and ascend to behold the radiant light. May they bathe in the Pool of Flowing Fire and rest beneath the shade of the Hall of Bright Clouds. May they transcend to the highest realms, and may blessings and protection extend to the living.

May all within the Three Wretched Paths and Five Courses, the Six Realms and Nine Hells, have their names stricken from the ledgers of sin and their records of judgment erased. May they forever escape the depths of suffering and all be delivered.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

On this morning audience, as we perform the Dao rites, we invite the dharma assembly to offer this second pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to present offerings to the supreme and most true master treasures. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this retreat, such-and-such household—may their past transgressions dissolve, their calamities and misfortunes cease. May their lifespan be recorded in the Southern Palace and extended by the Eastern Dipper. May their family and kin all prosper, and auspicious signs gather in abundance.

Thereafter, may all sentient beings, whether moving or still, flying or submerged, equally receive the grace of this amnesty and together ascend to the realm of carefree wandering.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

We now perform the rites of repentance and confession.

Each visualizes the nine-hued perfect image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret demon-commanding incantation. Treading the void in dance, circling in reverence, they prostrate to the Supreme, burn incense, and return to the formless. Radiant light follows their turn, and the Dharma-wheel likewise completes three revolutions. Mystic vows arise in the four quarters, and numinous blessings extend to kings and lords. Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, their splendor spreading in glorious display. Their songs resound beyond the vast desert, and celestial music delights their joy. Together they offer fragrant virtue to the Supreme, with whom even the lower immortals cannot compare. Wondrous thoughts illumine dark enlightenment, and in throngs they ride the void in wandering. Circling, they tread the cloud-net, mounting the void to walk the dark principle. Chanting the hymns of the Lord of Unity, a hundred channels naturally harmonize. Below, they command the lads of the eight seas; above, they escort the lofty immortals. The hosts of heaven scatter flowers of incense, and a serene numinous wind arises. Long-held vows fix the root of destiny, thus attaining the highest eminence. Rejoicing before the Supreme, even ten thousand kalpas would not mark its beginning. Towering is the Dark Capital Mountain, where the ten directions revere the August One. Lofty is the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, its radiance streaming like the sun’s flame. Resplendent are the jade-forest blossoms, their crimson fruits gleaming bright. Ever mindful to feast on primordial essence, refining the fluids to secure bodily form. Golden light scatters through the Purple Tenuity, profound and serene, the Great Vehicle glides free.

**Three Bows**
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**
We, your humble servants, such-and-such and others, now respectfully reaffirm our address to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, the Three Master Lords, the High Ministers and High Chancellors, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, and all the divine officials of the Three Realms.

We, your servants, dust-bound and of humble merit, have accumulated good fortune over lifetimes to encounter this assembly. The mystic wind spreads universally, and the true teaching is proclaimed afar. Precious talismans and jade-scriptures descend from the Three Clarities to unfold transformation; dragon-writ and phoenix-edicts encompass the myriad sages in transmitting truth. Reverently receiving the guidance of our masters, we have all been graced with their instruction. Yet we have not been able to cultivate diligently nor preserve our ascent to flight. Only by establishing merit, delivering people, and aiding beings can we repay the virtue of the Perfect Dao in shaping all things and requite the benevolence of heaven and earth in covering and supporting all. Whatever beings turn their hearts toward it should be duly reported.

The patron of this retreat, such-and-such, has learned that the Three Primes possess their ranks, and the Supreme Sages have bequeathed their texts. This is the season when the Celestial Prime renews its mandate, the day when the Three Palaces of the Emperor issue their amnesty. Both the hidden and the manifest receive protection, and all that moves or grows is touched by grace. Privately reflecting that to repay one’s lord and parents, nothing precedes the building of blessings; to serve one’s family and country, nothing surpasses the merit of this retreat. Thus we prostrate at the numinous altar, turning our hearts to the Supreme Sages. Bearing the tokens of the Dharma, we have reverently established this ritual precinct. Jade pendants and pearl banners mingle with sacred regalia in dazzling splendor; whale-bell and phoenix-chime lead the immortal chants in ethereal measure. The Perfected and Sages draw near from afar, and our sincerity is lifted upward. We humbly pray that the great treasure of your numinous influence may bless and protect the imperial enterprise. May the phoenix calendar be subtly extended, and the dragon majesty firmly secured. May the emperor’s sagacity surpass that of Fuxi and Huangdi, his benevolence equal that of Yao and Shun. May the myriad dwellings rest in harmony, and the nine regions submit to transformation. May the three frontiers be pacified, forever free from the toil of beacon fires; may the eight extremities shine in clarity, ever open to tribute from afar. May the imperial enterprise of Great Peace outshine all rivals. May the stars follow their courses in the nine heavens, and wind and rain be balanced through the four seasons. May weapons, disease, and epidemics not afflict the common people; may floods, droughts, fires, and locusts not arise within the kingdom’s borders.

Next, we pray for the household of the patron of this retreat: may the nine lineages be delivered, and the five clans live in harmony. May their name be inscribed in the south for accumulated goodness, and their record of transgressions erased in the northern bureau. May calamities not arise, and blessings be ever renewed. May their official emoluments be increased in the heavenly palace, and their lifespan extended in the immortal precincts. Thereafter, may the frozen courts of the long night and the riverine realms of Fengdu be transformed. May dark prisons become pure and tranquil abodes, and hells be converted into realms of formlessness. May all beings fulfill their natures, and every kind awaken. May heaven endure and earth abide, ever advancing in the Dao’s transformation. Above, may the radiant grace of the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Salvation be manifest; below, may the sincerity of we, your servants, in turning toward the Dao be answered.

Respectfully we make this address known.

**Initiating the Vows**
First vow: for the four great elements of the Dao to unite in virtue with the patron of this retreat. May the seven generations of parents escape suffering and sorrow, ascend to heaven, and enjoy natural sustenance.

Second vow: for the emperor and lords of the realm, that the Dao’s transformation flourish. May schools and academies thrive, and the imperial teaching expand. May their majesty and decorum be revered, and all under heaven look upon them. May the people praise Great Peace, and the four barbarians submit. May evil and perversity vanish of themselves, and sages and worthies arise naturally.

Third vow: for the Dharma Master, that great merit be established. May their teaching and transformation be clear and far-reaching, and all attain flight as immortals.

Fourth vow: for fellow students of the Dao. May they swiftly attain the immortal way and mutually aid one another in deliverance.

Fifth vow: for the nine relations to live in harmony, esteeming benevolence and righteousness. May they value the Dao and scorn wealth, their conduct a model for all beings.

Sixth vow: to diminish oneself and bestow alms upon Daoist masters and those who suffer hunger and cold. May all people under heaven find their proper place.

Seventh vow: for creeping and crawling beings. May all sentient beings equally achieve fulfillment.

Eighth vow: to pardon past transgressions. May the sins of this life be redressed by establishing merit to compensate for faults.

Ninth vow: for the flourishing of the household. May the ancestral temple have descendants, and worthy talent arise in every generation.

Tenth vow: to honor and receive the scripture masters, never daring to grow remiss, but maintaining a single, equal mind. May all beings be broadly delivered, and all attain the rank of immortal. May they ascend to heaven in broad daylight, pay homage to the Supreme, and forever become Perfected Ones, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages. Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

The incense is replenished.

Incense Official Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Incense Spirit-Officials—may they cause the place where this servant burns incense to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous Perfected Ones gather here, assembling before the grotto-altar and incense burner. May this servant, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions receive the rising incense smoke and swiftly convey the words this servant has just uttered directly to the August Jade Court of the Supreme, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Dao.

Chanting the *Empty Cavern* hymns, the Thearch visualizes the altar.
The Five Emperors review records,
Receiving talismans from the Three Officials.
Four gates are guarded,
Demons bound and traitors expelled.
Fiery bells cast forth,
Banishing filth and burning remnants.
The body bears the golden scripture,
Refining the elixir to rejuvenate the countenance.
Mysterious void and plain harmony,
The heart moves the Three Passes.
Riding lions and mounting cranes,
Commanding dragons and mounting simurghs.
Ten thousand stars guard the abode,
A thousand demons dare not intrude.
The Dao-qi endures,
Myriad immortals rest in peace.

*Strike the dharma drum twenty-four times*

The Supreme Dark Prime, Most High Dao Lord, summons forth from within this servant’s body:
The Three and Five Merit Officers,
Left and Right Attending Messengers,
Incense-Bearing Golden Youths,
Message-Conveying Petal-Scattering Jade Maidens,
Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman-Holders,
Direct-Day Incense Spirits—
thirty-two of each—emerge.
Emerging, they solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mystic Altar’s Heavenly Thearch Spirit Lords, calling forth the local earth gods, domain spirits, and true officials of this place.
On this occasion, with utmost sincerity, may the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend, flowing into the bodies of this servant and all present, swiftly conveying the words this servant has uttered directly to the August Jade Court of the Supreme, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Dao.

*Each declares their dharma rank*

We, your servants, [names], together with one heart, reverently address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Boundless Supreme Dao Lord, the Great Sage Ancestor, Highest Supreme Dao, Golden Court Mysterious Prime Heavenly August Emperor, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder, the Dark Prime Supreme Elder;
The perfected and sagely lords and elders of the ten directions who have already attained the Dao;
The thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs;
The Jade Clarity Highest Emperor;
The Jade Emperor;
The Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mystic Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Court, Seven-Jewel Mystic Terrace, Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord;
The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;
The officials and all true numina of the Three Realms—

We, by former vast causes, have been able to receive the mysterious transformation, bearing the great Dharma and wearing the precious scriptures. Truly, we should lift our traces to the cloudy groves, nest our spirits in the tranquil vastness, shake our robes free of the vulgar, and pursue friendship with the highest Perfected. Yet the Great Sages have bestowed their regulations, and the Primordial August One has spread the teachings. First, we must aid the state and proclaim transformation, succoring beings and pacifying the people, propagating the Dao and establishing merit, broadly covering all kinds. For every prayer and supplication, how dare we not report it above?

*Reading the petition*
According to the words of the petition, it is fitting to submit this report.
The retreat master, [name], above reveres the ancestral temples, below extends to all beings. Hoping to establish good merit and broadly propagate excellent blessings, especially as this is the auspicious season of the [specific] Primordial Festival, a day of purification and retreat. The Jade Emperor presides above, and the ten thousand sages review merit in the Three Realms. The living and the dead share in blessings, not a hair’s breadth omitted. Thus, we perform this rite of prayer and supplication to express the sincerity of human servants. Holding the Dharma tokens, we have reverently established the altar. We, your servants, relying on the canonical rites, concentrate our spirits and purify our thoughts, directing our hearts to the Crimson Palace and bowing our hands to the Pure Capital. We hope that feathered canopies and cloud chariots will descend in semblance, that the highest Perfected and august Sages will vaguely manifest their presence, bestowing blessings across seas and mountains, encompassing the hidden and the manifest with their protection.

Today, at the noon audience, we, the Dharma assembly, perform the first offering of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao. We, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High. May this merit, above, benefit the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral temples, causing them to ascend to the Azure Heavens and bestow blessings upon the imperial domain.

May the Emperor’s virtue equal that of Fuxi and Shennong, his merit match that of the Yellow Emperor and Emperor Yan. May the mountain of his longevity grow ever higher, the sun of his sagacity shine ever brighter. May the tracks of chariots unite, weapons be stilled, the stars and planets move in harmony, wind and rain come in season. May the Crown Prince and the various kings inherit the celestial mandate and continue the sagely line. May the Empress, consorts, princesses, the hundred officials, and all ministers daily receive new blessings, their illustrious glory flourishing. Thereafter, may civil arts embrace distant customs, martial arts pacify perilous crises. Within the seas and the realm, may all ascend to the realm of longevity.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master, in the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

At this noon audience, as we perform the Daoist rites and invoke the Dharma assembly, we offer this two-pinch incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, ascending directly to make offering to the supreme and most true scriptural treasures.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits flow back to the winding springs of the cold courts, to the eternal night of Fengdu. May all the hidden spirits of the nether palaces and earthly prisons—along with the nine generations and seven lineages of the ritual sponsor’s family, their countless ancestors and myriad forebears—emerge from the depths of darkness and ascend to the courts of the Great Ultimate. May their names be stricken from the ledgers of sin in the Northern Bureau, and may they wander in the purified realms of the gods; may their lives be inscribed in the Southern Palace’s registers of the living, and may they attain the ranks of immortality.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master, in the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

At this noon audience, as we perform the Daoist rites and invoke the Dharma assembly, we offer this three-pinch incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, ascending directly to make offering to the supreme and most true Master’s treasures.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits flow throughout the heavens and earth, within the transformative power of the Dao. May all bathe in the mysterious workings of the Dao and together receive the blessings of the Perfected Ones. May the ritual sponsor’s calamities and misfortunes be extinguished, their transgressions and faults dissolved. May the true spirits of the Three Realms secretly augment their blessings, and may the nine elixirs’ secret wonders eternally preserve their years. May inner and outer realms alike know peace, and may the living and the dead together enjoy prosperity.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master, in the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

We perform the rites and offer repentance.

Each visualizes the nine-colored spherical image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret incantation to command demons. Stepping in the void, circling in procession, bowing and rising while contemplating the Most High, the radiant splendor flourishes in the cinnabar field. Glancing left, one uplifts the somber essence; gazing right, one grasps the resplendent brilliance. The Six Perfections crown the pure conduct, and virtue and the Dao renew with each dawn. Accumulated blessings from past lives respond, and hearing the scriptures feels as intimate as kin. Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent, joyfully reciting the subtle and profound texts, one breathes the qi of supreme harmony, exhaling and inhaling the essence of flowing clouds. Embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages, and in profound emptiness, one masters the three conveniences. The Niwan Palace shines with luminous splendor, and thus one becomes an immortal of golden radiance. The Demon Kings respectfully receive their charge, enabling ascent to the heavens. All begins with fasting and precepts, accumulating merit to bind past-life affinities. Soaring through the great void, one uplifts the loftiest beings, guiding the reins to traverse the ten directions, resting upon the slopes of the darkly radiant peaks. Gazing up at the Terrace of Kalpas, looking down upon the purple cloud net, one roams the Most High’s capital, sitting together upon lotus blossoms. Through accumulated study, one becomes a Perfected Person, serene and harmonious in vital essence. Endlessly enjoying boundless longevity, why count the myriad cedars? The great Dao’s master is profound stillness, and the immortal companion is the peerless hero. The noble scion bestows the spirit talisman, while the Great One bears the cavernous scriptures. The relics gleam with golden form, and the dragon chariot swiftly arrives to welcome. The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon the cloud carriage, soaring lightly through the void. Fragrant blossoms fall like snow, and misty vapors flourish upon the darkly radiant beams.

**Three Bows**
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High Boundless Great Dao.
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**
We, your humble servants, so-and-so and others, respectfully reaffirm and address the Most High Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Supreme Mysterious Ancient; the Perfect, Boundless Great Dao and the Host of Sagely Worthies; the Heavenly Worthies and Perfected Ones; the Great Emperors and Heavenly Thearchs; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Three Masters; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all the divine officials and true spirits of the Three Realms.

We reflect upon our lowly and humble station, yet bathed in the mysterious wind of the Dao. Elevated in the ranks of the Dao, our names are listed among the true teachings. We have glimpsed the profundities of the Three Caverns and Five Scriptures, perused the dragon-bound and phoenix-scribed texts. Yet we have not hidden our traces or concealed our names in secluded forests and remote valleys, aspiring to ascension and eternal adherence to the numinous regulations. At the outset of receiving the Dharma, we made a pact with the Three Officials: our duty is first to succor beings, assisting the state and transforming the times. Establishing the teachings and accomplishing merit, we exhaust our sincerity and integrity.

Now, the ritual sponsor so-and-so petitions with earnest devotion, for the state and for the people, offering heartfelt loyalty and presenting incense and flowers as tokens of faith. We request the exalted fast and Dharma to repay the sovereign and parents. Moreover, the Three Primes are the season of great amnesty, when the living and the dead receive blessings; the Three Radiances mark the days of great illumination, when the hidden and the manifest are enlightened. In the Upper Palace of the Dark Capital, the Golden Gates of the Purple Tenuity, the myriad heavens hold their courtly feasts, and the host of sages turn their chariots. Absolving transgressions and elevating merit are fitting for this auspicious occasion. Dispelling calamities and invoking blessings, we pray for flourishing times.

We, in accordance with the canonical statutes, reverently perform the fast and vigil. Establishing the altar and practicing the Dao, we model earth after heaven. Burning incense and lighting lamps, we illuminate the dark night. The fragrant smoke ascends to the heavens, awaiting the true sages’ distant descent. May our sincerity reach them, and may we receive their abundant grace.

We humbly pray that the Three Clarities’ sagely worthies and the eight poles’ lofty venerables deign to lend their majestic radiance, bringing peace to the state’s fortunes. May they secure and pacify the altars of soil and grain, purifying and ordering the realm. May the emperor’s dual brilliances shine equally, his longevity matching the mountains. May he dredge the vast sources without end, bearing the vermilion screen with effortless governance. May the eight seas and nine continents see the cessation of weapons, and the three frontiers and six directions know no alarm from blades or arrows. May he rival the Three and Five in eminence, surpassing the sagacity of Fuxi and Shennong. May the winds of the Winnowing Basket and rains of the Net bring harmony, ensuring abundant harvests; may the sun of Shun and clouds of Yao shine resplendently, bringing peace to the myriad regions. May the crown prince embody the image of brightness and separation, and the various princes stand firm as bedrock. Within the six palaces, virtue is surely cultivated; among the hundred ministers, loyal counsel is clearly manifest. Climbing mountains and crossing seas, all follow the sagacious decrees. From distant lands and foreign domains, all converge under the Dao’s transformation. May the frontiers be tranquil and orderly, and near and far rejoice in well-being. May pestilence not arise, and calamitous omens vanish of themselves.

Then, may the long-night abodes of the Nine Darks and the realms of the Three Paths and Six Destinies see the deliverance of the nine generations of ancestors and the three masters. May the ritual sponsor so-and-so’s accumulated transgressions from past lives be cleansed and dissolved through repentance; may the thousand disasters and myriad afflictions be washed away by the true spirits. Renewed in fortune and lifespan, may they eternally enjoy benefit and integrity. May their inner and outer kin all attain supreme auspiciousness. May those who soar and those who sink fulfill their natures, and may all creatures be secure. Within heaven and earth, may no being lose its place. May the Heavenly Worthy’s vast compassion above respond to our devoted sincerity below.

**Petitions**
First, we pray that the Great Dao remain serene and empty, tranquil and still, dwelling in clarity. May it widely open the Dharma gates, instructing the stubborn and ignorant. May all receive its beneficent grace, cultivating diligently and austerely. May we, together with our fellow students, universally ascend to the void, preserving ourselves with heaven and abiding forever without care.

Second, we pray that the various heavens condense their qi and clarify their essence, vast and lofty in their coverage, preserving the true and securing the numinous. May the climate be harmonious, the four seasons balanced. May the state be secure and the people prosperous, the world at peace. May all be broadly succored, and beneficence reach all beings. May heaven be preserved eternally, enduring for countless kalpas without collapse.

Third, we pray that the earth endure in its covering and bearing without end, stable and unshaken, the seas not engulfing or collapsing. May it secure and protect the state and families, and the multitudes of people flourish. May it nurture the living and pacify the dead, its beneficence encompassing the ten directions. May crops and plants flourish, and enterprises daily prosper. May all receive its abundant support, and the myriad things follow accordingly.

Fourth, we pray that the sun and moon, the two luminaries, shine brightly, without eclipses or disturbances, their waxing and waning serene and clear. May their light illuminate the heavens, dispelling all darkness. May they safeguard the kalpas and ensure peaceful reigns. May they universally bestow moisture and grace, showering blessings upon all beings.

Fifth, we pray that the stars and constellations shine with brilliance equal to the sun and moon. Turning like candles in the night, may they brightly illuminate the ten directions. May each remain in its proper place, their celestial paths straight and true. May they safeguard and secure the state and families, free from harm or calamity. May the four seas be tranquil and unified, and all under heaven flourish and prosper.

Sixth, we pray that the four seasons progress in due order. May their climates be harmonious and balanced, free from disaster or affliction. May pestilence and poison vanish, and all under heaven enjoy peace and stability. May the five grains ripen in abundance, the state prosper, and the people rejoice.

Seventh, we pray that floating clouds gather qi and amass mist. Soaring high and clear in the heavens, may they shade and cover the profound and mysterious. When concealed, they remain in non-action; when dispersed, they fill the sky. May immortals and transcendent beings dwell together, forming friendships with the multitude of perfected ones. May their beneficence flow to all, fostering the state and cherishing the people. May they universally succor all beings, and humanity endure as long as the kalpas.

Eighth, we pray that wind and rain flow and descend without end. May they universally bestow their release, nurturing growth and flourishing. May the myriad things thrive, the state’s stores be abundant, and the people prosper.

Ninth, we pray that the Five Peaks each remain in their proper place, towering and encompassing, ever serving as palaces of the immortals. May they secure and stabilize the state’s destiny, preserving heaven without end. May they protect and deliver all beings, none who do not revere and honor them.

Tenth, we pray that rivers and seas flow boundlessly, vast and without limit. Embracing and containing with magnanimity, may they nurture even the smallest of things. Profound and gentle in their kindness, may they moisten and sustain all that wriggles and breathes. May heaven and humanity receive blessings, their years enduring like the kalpas and stone.

Eleventh, we pray that the emperor and the kingdom’s lands daily prosper. May the four frontiers be peaceful and harmonious, weapons and warfare unraised. May heaven and humanity sing in praise, auspicious omens descending in flight. May teachings be disseminated with solemnity, and virtuous transformation spread far and wide. May the multitudes rejoice in celebration, their joy unending.

Twelfth, we pray that all creatures—those that soar, crawl, or stir, whether born or yet unborn—may universally receive safety and security, attaining life and growth. May they all behold the primordial qi, receiving the forms of yang. May grasses, trees, fruits, and forests endure winter without withering. May all be delivered and uplifted, none that do not flourish in fresh splendor. May harmony unite with the Dao in truth, returning to the crucible.

May the Fragrant Office Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit-officials of incense cause the places where I offer incense to spontaneously generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here, assembling before the crucible. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the rising incense smoke, swiftly conveying the words I have just uttered directly to the August Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Supreme Boundless Dao—formless, nameless, void, and spontaneous.

The guardian spirits’ radiance shines bright, auspicious qi swirling in coils. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper gleam with limpid light, the halls of mushrooms serene. Jade pupils and golden perfected ones, the precious altar pure yang. Night transformed into day, the hour returned to before noon. Mount Tai’s hues flow in splendor, the vermilion phoenix soars in flight. Demons stilled, treachery extinguished, one strides high through auspicious mist. Heavenly perfected gather in full, all arriving before the Emperor.

*Strike the dharma drum twenty-four times*

The Supreme Dao Lord of the Mysterious Origin summons forth from within my body the Three-and-Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Incense-Attending Golden Youths, the Word-Conveying Petal-Scattering Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two each. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to open the gates of the mysterious altar and invoke the local earth deities and true officials of this realm. On this day, we humbly pray that the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure may descend and flow into our bodies. Immediately, let golden radiance blaze forth, bearing the qi of Upper Clarity aloft. May the words we have uttered swiftly reach the August Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Supreme Boundless Dao—formless, nameless, void, and spontaneous.

*Each declares their dharma rank*

We, your humble servants, [Names] and others, with sincere devotion jointly prostrate and address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Dao and Supreme Dao Lord, the Great Sacred Ancestor and Highest August Dao Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Mysterious Origin, the Heavenly Emperor of the Jade Clarity, the Supreme Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Clarity Thearch, the Great Jade Thearch, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, the Golden Portal and Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, and the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the thirty-six revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all the divine officials of the Three Realms.

We have heard that the wondrous Dao of non-action encompasses the myriad methods in its supremacy; the true lineage of purity and quiescence governs the Three Primes to nurture beings. Its divine transformations greatly flourish, universally delivering the multitudes. Thus, the officials of heaven, earth, and water oversee the clarity of transgressions and blessings; the clerks of yin and yang assess fortune and misfortune. The flying celestials recite the jade-casket texts, while the highest sages request the jade-case registers. From families to states, all are permitted to repent and pray. Whether manifest or hidden, all are surely enabled to attain liberation.

We have long received the mysterious teachings and been entrusted with the luminous statutes. Our aspiration lies in establishing merit and disseminating true transformation. In all matters requiring supplication, how dare we not make this known above?

*Reading the petition*

As the words declare, our resolve runs deep in devotion. Moreover, at this season of the rite, we ought to offer our sincerest prayers. This is indeed the time when the heavens hold their courtly feasts, and grace flows through all ranks; it is the assembly where the ten thousand sages proclaim their compassion, and mercy extends to the ten directions. Thus, we reverently knock upon the mysterious gate and diligently perform the Yellow Register rites. Universally, we repent and deliver both the living and the dead, guiding all families and states to take refuge. Together, we exert our cinnabar sincerity, looking upward in hope of vast blessings.

Tonight, as we perform the circumambulation and invoke the dharma assembly, we first offer this pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Worthies. May the merit of this act flow to the august spirits of the nine ancestral temples and the successive generations of sagely ancestors, allowing their spirits to wander the Great Vastness and behold the wondrous Upper Clarity. May it extend blessings to future generations and gather great felicity for the imperial enterprise. May the Emperor’s transformation equal that of the Three Sovereigns and Five Thearchs, his longevity surpassing billions and thousands. May he grasp the Great Image to govern heaven and embody the soaring dragon to establish the ultimate. May the Crown Prince, the Empress, and the imperial consorts assist in the sagely governance; may the loyal ministers and upright officials safeguard the prosperous fortune.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masters, in their perfect virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless. Harmonious, they unite with the true Dao.

On this evening audience in the performance of the Dao, we invoke the ritual assembly and offer this second pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to make offering to the supreme, most perfect Treasure of Scriptures. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to reverently rely upon the Three Supreme Worthies. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so. May their karmic bonds of kalpas past and the spirits of nine generations ascend to the Purple Palace of Perfection and refine their luminous forms in the Vermilion Numinosity. May they ride the swift winds and wear the constellations as a crown, reach the Celestial Capital and depart the gates of earth. May their blessings flow without end, their felicity and benefit manifest in the present.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masters, in their perfect virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless. Harmonious, they unite with the true Dao.

On this evening audience in the performance of the Dao, we invoke the ritual assembly and offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to make offering to the supreme, most perfect Treasure of Masters. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to reverently rely upon the Three Supreme Worthies. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so. May their five clans and six relations alike be moistened by radiant protection. May calamities spontaneously cease and karmic entanglements dissolve entirely. May the Four Seas and Nine Provinces together bathe in the transformation of harmony and peace; may all sentient beings receive the breeze of purity and stillness. May the gates of the nightly palaces and the springs of the underworld all be opened and delivered. May those that fly, those that hide, those that creep, and those that move all attain safety.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of Masters, in their perfect virtue. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

We bow in reverence, repent, and pace the void,
circling in procession to bow our heads before the Golden Gates,
hand in hand we roam the Jade Capital.
The soaring trees adorn the Garden of Rounded Light,
resplendent with the Seven Jeweled Grove.
Three hundred celestial beasts in their ranks,
lions vast as ten thousand *xun* in stature.
Flying dragons chant in lingering song,
divine phoenixes cry in measured harmony.
A sacred breeze fans wondrous blossoms,
pure fragrance scattering upon our robes.
Without the talent of lofty immortals,
how could one indulge such a heart?

We adorn our Nine-Dragon Chariot,
mounting the void to roam freely.
The Eight Heavens lie like the palm of a hand,
the Six Directions—how could they be distant?
The assembled perfected chant the *Dongxuan*,
the Most High sings a pure hymn.
Incense and blossoms scatter upon the wind,
jade tones rise into the Purple Empyrean.
The Five Sufferings burst forth at once,
the Eight Difficulties follow the scriptures’ emptiness.
Wondrous is the Garden of Numinous Treasure,
where this great Dharma Bridge is raised.
The Palace of Celestial Perfected Unity,
radiant with luminous majesty.
The Wheel of Dharma’s net shines in flowing splendor,
spiraling through the void into formlessness.
The August Sovereign of the Void plucks the cloud-zither,
the assembled perfected chant the *Dongjing*.
Lofty immortals, solemn in gesture, offer praise,
preserving integrity through kalpas untold.

Thrice we bow—we, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity—
to the Most High, Boundless Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity—
to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity—
to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Again, we declare our ranks:
We, your humble servants, so-and-so and others,
respectfully reaffirm our supplication to the Most High, Boundless Dao,
the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Origin;
the Most High Lord of the Dao;
the Most High Lord Lao;
the Boundless Dao and Virtue’s Assembly of Sagely Worthies,
Celestial Venerables, and Perfected Ones;
the Great Emperor of Heaven;
the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
the Supreme Ministers and Prime Chancellors;
the Four Directors and Five Emperors;
and all the divine officials and honored spirits of the Three Realms.

We, dull of understanding in the profound mystery,
have been granted participation in the most wondrous.
Following the teachings of frugal compassion,
we unfold the precepts of salvation and deliverance.

Having poured forth our sincere devotion,
we gaze upward to extol the vast transformation.

We have heard that in the Jasper Capital and Golden Towers,
the assembly of supreme sages and venerables
observes the suffering realms through the Eight Gates,
and sets forth the compassionate vessel across the Three Realms.
They protect and sustain all beings,
rescuing and delivering the multitudes.

Thus, they command the Three Officials to govern the Three Primes,
and extend the Nine Radiance to illumine the Nine Nights.
They quell calamities and bestow blessings upon states and households,
dispelling gloom and darkness in the hidden depths.
The sagely grace is all-pervading,
and the divine efficacy is widely manifested.

Now, as the turning of the celestial cycles brings forth the season of great amnesty and grace,
we prepare incense and lamps,
and present offerings in solemn fast.
Following the pattern of Heaven and Earth,
we grandly establish the imperial altar;
continuing the brilliance of the Three Luminaries of the stars,
we reverently pray for the mysterious favor.

For nine watches, we purify and cleanse;
for three days, we cultivate utmost sincerity.
We hope that the Great Emperor will turn his radiance toward us,
and that the Primordial Venerable will deign to look upon us.
May divine light manifest in seventy-two hues,
and auspicious splendor condense across the thirty-six heavens.
Responding to our devotion, may omens appear;
answering our supplication, may blessings be bestowed.

Above, may the imperial destiny be upheld,
enduring with Heaven and Earth in eternal constancy;
may the sagely court be blessed,
shining in equal brilliance with the sun and moon.
May the imperial lineage flourish,
and the great enterprise prosper.
May the cultural norms unite all directions,
and weapons of war be stilled throughout the Six Directions.
May worthy ministers and loyal aides,
with civil virtue and martial prowess,
assist in the imperial enterprise,
and widely proclaim the luminous transformation.
May no worthy remain hidden in the wilds,
and may the court abound in loyal and virtuous officials.
May the nine grains flourish in abundance,
and the five weapons be sheathed.
May the harms of floods, droughts, bandits, and invasions cease,
and may there be no fear of famine, misfortune, or pestilence.
May the myriad people live in peace,
and the six qi harmonize.
May the Nine Springs and earthly prisons,
once shrouded in darkness, behold the light;
may the imprisoned and destitute souls,
freed from the bonds of sin, ascend to the shore of bliss.
May dragons and spirits live in harmony,
and the lands and domains be at ease.
May auspicious signs and propitious omens
be recorded day by day and month by month.

We, your disciples, though dull of understanding in the Nine Mysteries,
aspire to verify the fruit and ascend to perfection.
May our five clans and six relations
enjoy extended life and eternal longevity.
May those who soar and those who sink fulfill their nature,
and all things, moving and still, find their proper place.
Together, may we bathe in the mysterious efficacy,
and fully ascend the wondrous Dao.

Above, may the compassionate grace of the Heavenly Worthy be made manifest;
below, may the sincerity of your servants’ devotion be duly answered.

We respectfully present this supplication for your attention.

**Vows**

First, may the Great Dao flow freely, and all under Heaven embrace virtue.
Second, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.
Third, may the sorrowful souls of the Nine Nights all attain liberation.
Fourth, may the lonely and unsheltered souls all receive rebirth.
Fifth, may the world know great peace, and the five grains ripen in abundance.
Sixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.
Seventh, may the Four Seas be united, and enmities be resolved.
Eighth, may those hidden in wombs and eggs all be born and grow.
Ninth, may chronic and acute illnesses swiftly be healed.
Tenth, may the destitute and exposed multitudes be clothed and fed.

**Replenishing the Censer**

Incense Officials, Envoys, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger,
and all the spirit officials attendant upon the incense,
may the place where your servants offer incense
naturally give rise to golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.
May the hundred numinous perfected ones
gather here before the censer in the grotto.
May your servants’ bodies radiate golden splendor,
and may the roots of the womb be severed.
May the Seven Mysteries be uprooted,
and the hundred passages be prepared for immortality.
May the registers of death be erased,
and may we recline in the Mud-Pill Palace.
May the Eastern Florescence record our names,
and may we ride the luminous emptiness.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions,
attending the incense smoke,
convey the words we have just presented,
and swiftly deliver them to the Golden Portal and Jade Steps
of the Most High, Boundless Dao—formless, nameless,
empty, and self-so.

**Guardian Invocation**
Cinnabar spirits, vermilion flames—
radiant clouds ignite the winds.
The crimson wheel turns with unyielding force,
heaven’s light surging through the eight directions.
Bursting might envelops all,
transforming the ten thousand realms.
Molten gold scatters, demons vanish without trace.
Banishing deceit, shattering evil,
brilliant splendor reveals primal merit.
Golden talismans command and restrain;
we tread clouds, ride dragons.
Songs of celebration resound,
flowers scatter across the vast sky.
Divine transformation governs the unseen,
the four extremities rest in peace.
Before the August Emperor, none dare be disrespectful.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Dao—
summon forth from within this servant’s body:
the Three and Five Merit Officers,
left and right attending messengers,
incense-bearing Golden Youths,
message-conveying Jade Maidens,
Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman Officers,
and Daily Incense Officials—
thirty-two of each, emerge.
As they depart, arrayed in solemn attire,
open the gates of the Mystic Altar’s Heavenly Emperor Divine Lords.
Summon now this land’s local deities and true officials,
to swiftly ascend and open the gates.
This servant, acting on behalf of the petitioner,
now presents this invocation,
praying that the numinous radiance of Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure’s wondrous light descend,
flowing into our bodies.
Thus shall the Mystic Altar be purified,
inner and outer realms perfected as true.
Heaven freed from impurity,
earth cleansed of demonic dust.
Jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow solemn.
No demon dares intrude;
sincerity ascends unobstructed.
May this servant’s petition swiftly reach
the august presence of the Most High, Boundless Dao—
the Perfectly True Jade Emperor.

**Declaring Dharma Titles**
From the Upper Clarity Mystic Capital, we, the Mountain Masters of [Name] Peak, servants [Names],
with one heart, reverently address:
the Self-So, Boundless Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
the Boundless Great Dao, Supreme Jade Dawn Dao Lord,
the Most High Lord Lao,
the Supreme Mysterious Elder,
the perfected great sages of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,
the Lords of the Thirty-Six Heavens,
the Jade Void Emperor,
the Jade Emperor the Great Emperor,
the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern True,
the Mystic Capital Jade Capital Golden Portal Seven-Treasure Mystic Terrace Purple Tenuity Upper Palace,
the Numinous Treasure Perfectly True Radiant August Dao Lord,
the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm,
and all divine officials of the Three Realms.
We, having planted good causes in past lives,
now encounter the mysterious transformation.
Born into the multitude of beings,
we deliver and uplift the sunken and suffering.

By grace of our masters’ guidance, we bear the secret registers of the Three Clarities; through reverent reception of the Mystic Decree, we chant the true scriptures of the Three Caverns. Ranked among the immortal orders, our names ascend the jade tablets. Yet we have not yet refined spirit and burnished bone, nor severed traces to attain the empty breast. In vain do we abide at the Gate of All Wonders, often transgressing the statutes of the Luminous Perfected. Formerly, on the day we received the Dharma, we pledged alliance to the Five Emperors and swore oaths to the Three Officials—to deliver and uplift heaven and humanity, to aid and assist family and state. Whatever prayers are offered, by principle they must be declared. Today, our earnest sincerity is too profound to suppress. Having received the petition’s intent, how dare we not report it above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the petition humbly states, its principles succor the hidden and the manifest. The patron of this retreat, through kalpas of accumulated merit and virtues surpassing all heavens, reveres the great transformation of the spontaneous and worships the Primordial Honored One of the Boundless. They assist the state and guide the sovereign, cherishing kin and serving elders. Embracing the profound intent of deliverance and uplift, they pity the sunken souls of the hidden depths. Moved by compassion, their hearts grieve and their aspirations pour forth. Following the sagely teachings, they repay great kindness. Unfolding the canons of the Yellow Register, they open the ranks of the Mystic Altar. With solemn adornment and reverent offerings of incense and flowers, they invoke the spirits of the Three Officials and Five Emperors, and pay homage to the sages of the Golden Portal and Jade Chambers.

We, in accordance with the scriptures and in observance of the precepts, purify our thoughts and concentrate our spirits, cleansing our minds and fixing our devotion. Today, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Dao.

We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits, above, benefit the ancestral temples and imperial altars of the august house, their numinous might harmonizing with the effortless and their achievements manifesting in perfect fulfillment. May the dragon’s chart of the emperor endure forever, the phoenix’s reign flourish evermore. May the realm be unified in culture and governance, harmonious as seas and mountains. May the myriad people rely on this, all affairs be upright. May virtuous transformation shine forth, generations flourish abundantly. May the ten thousand regions be tranquil, the nine luminaries radiant and exalted.

Those who withdraw to cultivate perfection, their teachers and parents, all may roam the eight poles and swiftly ascend the Three Clarities. For this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless.

Today, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Scriptures.

We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits confer blessings upon the patron of this retreat. May the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, the departed spirits, have their names stricken from the registers of doom and their merits inscribed in the tablets of record. May they ascend as perfected beings to serene realms, their blessings flowing to descendants. Abiding long in the steadfastness of the One, may their names be exalted in posterity; eternally cherishing the Three Treasures, may their teachings be handed down to future generations.

For this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing with the true Dao.

Today, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Masters.

We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits extend grace to all beings, bestowing blessings upon the myriad people. May all attain fulfillment in life and growth, each equally sharing in benefit and relief. Extending to the drifting souls of travelers and the wandering spirits of the waves—those who have suffered the deep calamities of the eight difficulties and escaped the extreme torments of the nine dark realms—may their names, not yet erased from the black registers nor recorded in the cinnabar books, all receive the compassionate favor of the Honored Ones. Command the Heavenly Officials to record them in full, instruct the Earth Prisons to gather them completely. May they all come to the altar feast and partake in deliverance and salvation. May they forever depart from evil destinies, all plant the roots of goodness. Sheltered in the heavens and among humanity, may they be reborn in bliss.

For this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected. Their virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing with the true Dao.

**Repentance**
Threefold Invocation.

Amidst the flourishing of states and households,
The Way of scriptures thrives in solemn splendor.
Heaven and humankind share a single aspiration,
Ascending into the vastness of the Great Vehicle.
By the heart’s intent, the field of blessings is established,
And the Wheel of Dharma rises in boundless ascent.
May the seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,
While my own form soars in the light of day.

**Threefold Prostration**
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Supreme Primordial Dao of the Utmost Pole.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,
To the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**
We, the disciples of the Upper Clarity and Mystic Capital, the Masters of [such-and-such] Peak, once more invoke:
The Supreme Primordial Dao of the Limitless, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning;
The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;
The Supreme Lord Lao;
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
The Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
And all the perfected and numinous beings within and beyond the Three Realms, in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens.

We, your servants, have heard that the Supreme Mystery acts,
Receiving the non-acting to become acting;
The Most Sagely is without partiality,
Giving life to beings yet remaining without attachment.
It nurtures and shapes all things,
Halting poison and fostering growth.
Its use is inexhaustible, its divine power ungoverned.
It proclaims the work of vast opening,
And magnifies the gate of deliverance and salvation.
The net is cast wide, its great trust silent and profound.

Now, the master of this fast, [so-and-so], perceiving the subtle and pondering the distant,
Knocks upon the silent to seek the mysterious, spanning kalpas before Heaven.
The ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears,
Their forms dispersed and qi scattered,
Have left residual karmic afflictions,
Extending even to his own person.
Reaching to kin and dependents,
They cycle through birth and death,
Creating transgressions and faults.
Looking up, he relies on the texts of repentance and cleansing,
Hoping for the favor of purification and absolution.
Admiring the principle of deliverance by the Mystic Venerable,
He solemnly observes the rites with reverence;
Following the statutes of salvation by the Supreme Sages,
He strictly upholds the fast and precepts.
With golden dragon talismans and offerings of faith,
He approaches the sacred thrones to pay homage to the Perfected.
Reciting the numinous scriptures, he devoutly prays for the sages’ protection.

Further considering the officiants of this fast,
Who hold positions of governance and oversee regions,
The weal and woe of the people rest upon them,
And the creation of blessings depends entirely on their prayers and supplications.
Weary from the toils of the rite, their myriad concerns,
They bind their hearts in earnest devotion.
They think of the meritorious and worthy,
Extending to the masses.
Some established merit in service to the state,
Perishing in royal affairs;
Some, facing peril, forgot their families,
Dying in foreign lands far from home;
Some, as merchants or traders, amassed wealth at the cost of their lives;
Some, as officials, compromised integrity, taking bribes and losing their lives;
Some succumbed to epidemics;
Some were caught in rebellion and plunder.
Those beyond pardon were executed,
Leaving them childless and without heirs,
Their tonsured remains burned,
Their yin souls without refuge, their yang souls without support.
Deprived of offerings in spring and autumn,
Their messages carried only by crows and magpies.
Gathered, they become disasters of drought and flood;
Scattered, they become pests of locusts and caterpillars.
Though their merit was great, it went unrecognized,
With no means to be enshrined and venerated;
Though their crimes were grave, they may yet repent,
Seeking refuge to amend their ways.
All sink into the Five Sufferings,
All stagnate in the Nine Dark Realms.
Without the grace of the Mystic Ones,
They cannot escape the netherworld.

We humbly beseech the Merciful and Sagely True Lord of the Northern Culmen,
To command the spirits of mountains, rivers, and earth,
The lords of altars, temples, and city gods,
To pursue, summon, and guide them,
Searching far and wide.
May they all come to the numinous altar,
To listen and receive.
May they all renounce the ghostly registers,
And don the celestial regalia.
Bathed in the waves of grace,
May they transcend to the fruits of sageliness.
Ascending to the Golden Gates in carefree ease,
They shall offer praise in the Jade Capital.
With the sages’ boundless favor,
And the gods’ power to uplift,
May they be reborn within the Middle Kingdom,
Surely entering the gates of supreme goodness.

Thus, we pray that the master of this fast may extend blessings to kin and allies,
Honor spreading to the loyal and filial.
May calamities be utterly extinguished,
And auspicious qi converge as one.
May the earth’s vitality flourish,
And Heaven’s patterns shine in mystery.
May baleful stars withdraw their radiance,
And propitious qi surge with light.
May the Mystic Transformation expand,
And the imperial domain flourish.
May rivers run clear and seas be calm,
Rain fall in season and winds be gentle.
May the hundred grains burgeon in abundance,
And the five weapons be stilled.
May the myriad people enjoy wealth and joy,
And the Nine Virtues shine forth.
May all things thrive,
And all creatures fulfill their natures.

Above, may the Celestial Worthies’ compassionate grace descend;
Below, may our sincerity in devotion be answered.

**Respectfully presented for your attention.**

And the state be rich, the people joyful.

Seventh, we vow that floating clouds,
Formed of gathered qi and mist,
May drift high and clear in the sky,
Shading the mysterious and profound.
When concealed, they are non-acting;
When dispersed, they fill the heavens.
May immortals and sages dwell together,
Forming friendships with the host of Perfected.
May their blessings flow to all,
Reviving the state and cherishing the people,
Delivering the multitudes,
And sharing the kalpas’ span.

Eighth, we vow that wind and rain,
Flowing and showering without end,
May be universally bestowed,
Nurturing growth.
May all things flourish,
And the state’s stores and people’s wealth abound.

Ninth, we vow that the Five Peaks,
Each secure in its place,
Towering and vast in their embrace,
May long serve as palaces of immortals.

Tenth, we vow that the nation’s mandate be firmly secured,
Preserving Heaven’s boundless end.
May all be guided and protected,
None who do not look up in reverence.

Eleventh, we vow that rivers and seas,
Vast and boundless,
Embrace and encompass all,
Nurturing even the smallest life.
Deep and gentle, their kindness flows,
Moistening all that wriggles and breathes.
May Heaven and humanity receive blessings,
Their years enduring like kalpas and stone.

Twelfth, we vow that the Emperor’s reign,
And the land’s prosperity, daily increase.
May the Four Guardians be at peace,
Weapons of war never raised.
May Heaven and humanity sing in praise,
Auspicious omens descend in flight.
Teachings spread in abundance,
Virtue and transformation overflow.
May the myriad people rejoice,
Their joy unending.

Thirteenth, we vow that all creatures,
Born or unborn, moving or still,
May universally receive safety,
And attain life and growth.
May all behold the primordial qi,
And receive the form of yang.
May grasses, trees, fruits, and forests,
Not wither through winter.
May all be delivered and uplifted,
None that do not flourish in fresh glory.
Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.

May the Fragrant Palace Attendants, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all spirit officials of the incense altar,
Cause this place where I establish the fast to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs.
May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected gather here,
Before the incense burner.
May I, who study the Dao, attain the Dao;
Who seek immortality, attain immortality.
May the fast’s sponsor receive blessings,
And the hidden and manifest be graced with favor.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions,
Attending the orchid-scented smoke,
Convey my recent petitions,
Swiftly and directly to the presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao,
The Perfect and True Jade Sovereign of the August Heaven.

**Entering the Chamber**
Each bows to the master, contemplating as prescribed.

**Invoking the Protective Spirits**
The Five Stars shine brightly, auspicious qi soars and drifts.
The Primordial Beginning gathers the spirits, heaven and earth unite in harmony.
Jade talismans and precious seals summon the hidden and obscure.
Fire is cast and might displayed—no treachery or evil lingers.
The myriad demons tremble and submit, their malevolent blossoms wither away.
Monsters are crushed, evil vanquished; the qi of the Dao flows as one.
Divine radiance illuminates the night, all yin shadows are gathered in.
The ten thousand immortals descend in state, riding the winds upon the fading light.
All beings attain fulfillment, grace pervades the divine realm.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
O Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Lord of the Dao,
Summon forth from within this servant’s body:
The Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys,
The Golden Youths of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission,
The Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, the Incense Officials of the Day—
Each thirty-two in number—emerge.
Let them, in solemn array, report to the Celestial Thearchs of the Mysterious Altar.
Bid the local earth gods and territorial deities of this place,
The true officials and righteous spirits, hasten to receive this report.
This servant now acts on behalf of the sponsor’s intent,
Conducting the evening ritual procession.
May the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend,
Flowing into the bodies of this assembly.
Thus shall the Mysterious Altar be purified, within and without made true.
Let the heavens be free of defilement, the earth rid of demonic dust.
The chiming of jade resounds, the ten directions grow solemn and clear.
No demon dares intrude; true sincerity ascends.
May this servant’s petitions swiftly and directly reach
The presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao,
The Perfect and True Jade Sovereign of the August Heaven.

**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**
We, the disciples of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Clarity, the Masters of [Name] Peak,
With one heart, reverently address the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Void and Spontaneity,
The Boundless Great Dao, the Jade Dawn Lord of the Most High,
The Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Mysterious Elder,
The perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,
The thirty-six Celestial Thearchs,
The Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor,
The Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection,
The Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven-Treasure Mysterious Terrace,
The Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Perfect and Radiant August Lord of the Dao,
The thirty-six divisions of the sacred scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
And all the divine officials of the Three Realms.
We, who have planted good causes in past lives,
Have encountered the mysterious transformation.
We give life to all beings, deliver the submerged and suffering.
By the grace of our masters, we bear the secret registers of the Three Clarities,
Receive the profound decrees, and chant the true scriptures of the Three Caverns.
Ranked among the immortal grades, our names ascend the jade tablets.
Yet we have not yet refined our spirits to crystal bones,
Nor severed our traces to embrace the empty breast.
Vainly do we rely on the gate of the myriad wonders,
Often transgressing the laws of the luminous perfected.
On the day we received the Dharma, we pledged our oaths to the Five Thearchs,
Vowed our vows to the Three Officials.
To deliver heaven and humanity, to magnify the state and family.
For every prayer and plea, it is fitting to make solemn declaration.
Today, we present our earnest sincerity—how could it be suppressed?
The words we bear, how dare we not make known above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the petition humbly states, it is fitting to deliver both the hidden and manifest.
We recall that the sponsor, [Name],
Through kalpas of accumulated merit and virtues surpassing the heavens,
Reveres the transformation of the spontaneous Dao,
Honors the Primordial Venerable of the Boundless.
Assists the state and guides the sovereign, cherishes kin and serves elders.
Embraces the profound intent of salvation and deliverance,
Pities the suffering souls submerged in darkness.
Moved by compassion, their heart is grieved, their resolve expressed.
Following the sagely teachings, they seek to repay great kindness.
Unfolding the canonical chapters of the Yellow Register,
Opening the steps of the Mysterious Altar.
Adorning the altar with solemn splendor, reverently offering incense and flowers.
Invoking the spirits of the Three Officials and Five Thearchs,
Paying homage to the sages of the Golden Watchtower and Jade Chamber.
We, in accordance with the scriptures, perform the rites with strict observance of the precepts.
Purifying our thoughts, concentrating our spirits, cleansing our hearts, and focusing our minds.
Today, in this evening ritual procession,
We, the assembly of Dharma practitioners, now offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly offering reverence to the Most High and Perfect Treasure of the Dao.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves,
Reverently relying on the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May this merit extend upward to the imperial house, the ancestral temples, and the majestic spirits of the nine shrines.
May virtue harmonize with non-action, merit be proclaimed without limit.
May the emperor’s dragon chart be ever firm, the phoenix calendar ever prosperous.
May the realm be unified in culture and governance, harmonious as seas and mountains.
May the myriad people rely on this, all affairs be upright.
May virtuous transformation shine forth, generations flourish.
May the ten thousand regions be tranquil, the nine luminaries brightly radiant.
May those who retreat to cultivate perfection, masters and parents alike,
All roam the eight directions, swiftly ascend the Three Clarities.
Now, we burn incense and take refuge in the great sagely hosts,
The perfected and true virtues.
After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless.
In harmony with the Dao, we become true.

For this evening ritual procession,
We, the assembly of Dharma practitioners, now offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly offering reverence to the Most High and Perfect Treasure of the Scriptures.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves,
Reverently relying on the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May this merit extend blessings to the ritual officers.
To the nine ancestors and seven generations, the departed spirits.
May their names be erased from the registers of doom,
Their merits recorded in the tablets of commemoration.
May they ascend to the immortal realms, their blessings flow to descendants.
Ever abiding in the steadfastness of the One,
Their names proclaimed in posterity;
Forever cherishing the Three Treasures,
Following the teachings of the ancient perfected.
Now, we burn incense and take refuge in the great sagely hosts,
The perfected and true virtues.
After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless.
In harmony with the Dao, we become true.

For this evening ritual procession,
We, the assembly of Dharma practitioners, now offer the third pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly offering reverence to the Most High and Perfect Treasure of the Masters.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves,
Reverently relying on the Three Venerables of the Most High.
May this merit extend grace to all beings, blessings to the myriad people.
May all attain fulfillment in life, each receive aid and benefit.
Extending even to the drifting souls of the homeless,
The wandering spirits adrift on the waves.
Those who have suffered the eight calamities’ deep misfortunes,
Delivered from the nine yin’s extreme torments.
May their names be removed from the black registers,
Their merits inscribed in the cinnabar records.

May all reverently pray that the Merciful Venerables descend and bestow their numinous blessings,
Commanding the Heavenly Officials to compile the records in full,
Instructing the Earthly Courts to complete their reception.
May all come to the altar’s feast,
Each partaking in salvation and deliverance.
Forever departing from evil destinies,
All planting the roots of goodness.
Sheltered beneath the realms of humans and heavens,
They shall receive rebirth in joy.
Thus we now burn incense,
Reverently relying on the Masters, the Great Sages,
The virtue of the Most Perfect,
Who after attaining the Dao,
Ascended into the formless,
Harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

*Repentance*
Thrice Invoked

The Great Dao pervades the mysterious void,
With mindfulness, none fails to align.
Refining the essence to enter immortality,
Thus forming the vajra body.
Transcending the three realms’ tribulations,
The five hells’ sufferings dissolved.
All return to the Most High’s scriptures,
In silent contemplation, we bow in reverence.

*Three Bows*
We, the assembly, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.
We, the assembly, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, the assembly, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

*Reiterating the Dharma Titles*
We, the disciples of the Supreme Mystery Capital, the Masters of [such-and-such] Peak, once more invoke:
The Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin;
The Most High Jade Dawn Dao Lord;
The Most High Lord Lao;
The Ten Directions’ Most Perfect Great Sages;
The Supreme Heavenly Venerable;
The Heavenly Thearchs and Celestial Emperors;
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;
The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;
The responsive and perceptive deities of the three realms,
And all true numina.
We, though humble and unworthy,
Have been permitted to partake in the Great Dao.
Through the alliance of the Three Masters,
And the true scriptures of the Three Treasures.

We offer reverent worship, seeking the fulfillment of our vows.
Burdened by profound grace, our hearts swell with joy and trepidation.
From the day we received the Dharma, we pledged to propagate the true teachings and deliver both the living and the departed.
Whatever we present here is rightfully submitted for your consideration.
The officiant, disciple [Name], holds a position of weighty responsibility.
Assisting the Dao in establishing merit, they magnify goodness and uphold the Dharma.
Yet we observe that in recent years, within these borders,
the people have suffered misfortune and calamity.
Though there has been no drought or flood, the qi remains disordered.
Poverty, sickness, and plague afflict the weak, leaving them starved and destitute.
The multitudes languish, stricken by unseen harm;
the trembling masses perish in distress.
Thus, bodies remain unpreserved, lives incomplete.
The old and young alike fall prey to illness, death heaped upon death.
For mortals in this world, life is but a fleeting moment—
swift as lightning, rapid as the wind, scarcely held secure.
The causes of death are manifold:
Some serve their lords with selfless devotion, repaying their sovereigns with loyalty,
dying in battle, heedless of survival.
Others, driven by greed, perish in pursuit of wealth.
Some chase fame and office, only to meet their end in the quest for glory.
Others, of cruel and deceitful nature,
show no kindness to creatures, no mercy to people.
Their hearts harbor perversity, their tempers flare unchecked.
When illness strikes, none tend to them;
once afflicted, they swiftly succumb.
Or, pressed by hunger and cold, assailed within and without,
they perish by the roadside, unclaimed by any.
Some are dragged by swine or pulled by dogs;
others are gnawed by rats or devoured by insects,
dying in torment on the road, their corpses filling ditches.
Some lie exposed to wind and sun,
washed by rain, eroded by frost,
their flesh unseen, their bones left bare.
Some lack limbs, others lack heads or feet,
their bodies scattered, a piteous sight.
Now, we gather their remains, burying them together,
regardless of gender or age.
We spare them from exposure, ensuring all are covered and concealed.
Moreover, in the great teachings, compassion is fundamental.
The first duty is to shelter the dead, a principle that moves us to sorrow.
The sages of old, the Confucian masters, established rites:
planting pines upon burial mounds to guard against earth’s encroachment,
burying bones and flesh to spare the living from lament.
Thus, they sought harmony for the living and safety for the dead.
Is this fate’s decree, or the dictates of right principle?
Our hearts ache with grief, our outward gaze brims with pity.
Therefore, we come to this place, preparing the Daoist fast and offering.
We humbly present our repentance and gratitude, that it may ascend to the Thirty-Six Heavens;
we broadly proclaim our refuge, that it may resound through the Ten Directions.
We prostrate ourselves, beseeching the Perfected Sages and the Most High Venerables,
to command the Offices of the Three Officials and Five Emperors,
and proclaim to the Six Realms and Nine Dark Realms:
bestow abundant grace, bring all to peace and stability.
Pardon the transgressions of the living and the dead,
release them from the torments of judgment and suffering.
Bathe them in celestial blessings, cleanse the shades of the underworld.
Refine and deliver their forms and souls, freeing them from sin and affliction.
May the living receive aid and protection;
may the dead attain rebirth.
The officiant, [Name], undertakes this burial,
creating a shared tomb for all.
May each rest in their proper place, all find their due.
May they swiftly attain rebirth, unobstructed by lingering ties.

We further pray for harmonious seasons and balanced qi,
for the prosperity of all beings and the peace of the age.
May the vast night realms ever offer the chance for redemption;
may the distant heavens fulfill the vow of tranquility.
Above, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Venerables be manifest;
below, may our sincerity in devotion be answered.

We humbly submit this entreaty.

**Vows**
First, may the Great Dao spread far and wide, and all under heaven embrace its virtue.
Second, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.
Third, may the souls of the Nine Nights be liberated at once.
Fourth, may the lonely and forsaken all find rebirth.
Fifth, may the world know peace and the five grains flourish.
Sixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.
Seventh, may the four seas unite, and enemies and kin be reconciled.
Eighth, may those in hidden wombs and eggs all be born and thrive.
Ninth, may chronic and acute illnesses swiftly heal.
Tenth, may the destitute and exposed be clothed and fed.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**
Incense Officials, Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Spirit Officials,
now let golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise in this place of audience.
May the hosts of spirits and Perfected gather here before the incense burner.
May we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality achieve it.
May the officiant gain blessings, and both the living and the dead receive grace.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths who attend the fragrant smoke
convey our entreaty swiftly to the presence of the Most High, Boundless Great Dao,
the Perfected Jade Thearch.

**Exiting the Chamber**
Here concludes the thirty-sixth scroll of the *Rites of the Yellow Register Fast of the Most High*.

**The Thirty-Seventh Scroll of the *Rites of the Yellow Register Fast of the Most High***
*Compiled by Tang Dynasty Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting*

**Morning Transfer and Liberation Rite – Entering the Chamber**
Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

**Guardian Spirits**
Azure yang shines in emptiness, the sun’s radiance revolves with numinous power.
Divine tigers repel evil, flying immortals stream with ringing bells.
Crush treachery and dispel trials, bind the myriad demons in submission.
Ninefold subtlety returns to the Dao, eightfold might seizes essence.
A thousand Perfected audit the records, the Three Primes purge and purify.
To the left, the Central Yellow is invoked; to the right, the Six Dings are summoned.
Seven revolutions, eight unions, circling the celestial scriptures.
The sagely transformation towers sublime, the Three Ways proceed in harmony.
Auspicious clouds spread and diffuse, merging with the luminous Yellow Court.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
The Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summons forth from within this servant’s body:
the Three and Five Merit Officers, Left and Right Envoys, Attendant Incense Golden Lads,
Message-Conveying Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and Daily Incense Officials—
thirty-two of each—emerge.
Emerging, they solemnly attire and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar’s Heavenly Thearch Spirit Lords,
invoking this land’s local deities and true officials.
On this day, in accordance with the intent of the rite, we perform the fast and practice the Dao,
repenting transgressions and praying for grace.
May the numinous treasure’s wondrous light of Jade Clarity’s Dao qi descend,
flowing into our bodies.
Then shall purple clarity surge thickly, the Jade Towers blaze with brilliance.
The Five Thearchs assist the roots, the myriad spirits gather the true.
The body becomes a luminous pearl, riding the light and harnessing the celestial.
Golden radiance blazes resplendent, ascending with qi to the Upper Clarity.
May our entreaty swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, Boundless Great Dao,
before the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Golden Towers and Jade Steps.

**Each States Their Dharma Rank**
We, the assembled officiants and altar attendants, humbly and sincerely address together:
the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable,
the Boundless Great Dao, Most High Great Dao Lord,
the Most High Lord Lao, Supreme Mysterious Elder,
the Ten Directions’ Responding-to-Sounds Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Venerables,
the Great Sage Perfected and True Lords and Masters,
the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs,
the Jade Clarity Thearch, the Jade Emperor Great Thearch,
the Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern True, and Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Golden Towers Seven Treasures Dark Terrace Purple Tenuity Upper Palace Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord,
the Thirty-Six Divisions’ Venerable Scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Realm,
and all the true spirits of the Three Realms’ palaces.

We have heard that the Great Dao bestows its texts, the Primordial Venerable expounds its teachings,
saving the living and delivering the dead, aiding the state and pacifying the people.
Universally reaching the hidden and manifest, all attain its sheltering blessings.
We, having long received the mysterious instructions and been entrusted with our offices,
ought to broaden the winds of compassion to succor all beings.
Moreover, bearing the imperial decree, how dare we not make this known above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the petition states, it is fitting to open the path to deliverance.
With disciple so-and-so’s sincere devotion and earnest repentance,
we pray for the opening of the amnesty’s term, to liberate those suffering in the dark prisons.
Silk and ritual offerings ascend to the various heavens;
oil, candles, incense, and flowers pledge our hearts to the Three Realms.
Through this pure offering, may it ascend to the true spirits.

**Morning Dao Practice – First Pinch of Incense**
Now, at this morning’s Dao practice, we, the dharma assembly, offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke rise to the heavens, directly ascending to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating body and head, reverently relying on the Most High Three Venerables.
May these merits flow to the state’s august spirits and ancestral sages.
May the divine merge with the Great Vast, abiding serenely beneath the mushroom canopy;
may the wondrous be observed in the Upper Clarity, treading the lotus dais in free strides.
Prolong the phoenix’s auspicious reign, extend the great plan’s blessings.
May the emperor’s grace spread like the vast sea, his longevity equal the mountains.
May the myriad lands be linked by bridges and boats, all beings enveloped in compassion and kindness.
Loyal ministers and upright officials together uphold the glorious destiny;
civil achievements and martial virtues spread throughout the realm.
Parents, teachers, and masters—those dwelling in forests and valleys—
their merits inscribed on jade tablets, attaining ranks on the immortal’s ladder.
Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely and true virtues of the master and assembly,
that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless,
harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

**Second Pinch of Incense**
Now, at this morning’s Dao practice, we, the dharma assembly, offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke rise to the heavens, directly ascending to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating body and head, reverently relying on the Most High Three Venerables.
May these merits flow to the family of the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so.
Nine ancestors and seven generations, and the departed spirits’ consciousnesses—
loosen the dark entanglements of the earthly registers, still the offenses in the yin palaces.
Release the trials of the Three Ways, reconcile enmities across the Six Paths.
Transcend the hells, ascend into the halls of fortune.
Listen to the dharma, hear the scriptures, join the Perfected, and realize the Dao.
In the Nine Darks’ long night, all behold the light;
creeping, flying, sinking, and floating beings all share in vast blessings.
Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely and true virtues of the master and assembly,
that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless,
harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

**Third Pinch of Incense**
Now, at this morning’s Dao practice, we, the dharma assembly, offer the third pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke rise to the heavens, directly ascending to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.
We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating body and head, reverently relying on the Most High Three Venerables.
May these merits flow to the family of the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so,
forever stilling calamities, eternally attaining fortune and longevity.
Auspicious signs gather in abundance, kinfolk prosper in harmony.
Universally reaching all beings, together they ascend to the realm of longevity.
Thus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely and true virtues of the master and assembly,
that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless,
harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

**Bowing to the Directions**
**Repentance**

Each visualizes the nine-colored circular image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret incantation to command demons.
**Stepping the Void, Circumambulating**
The Great Ultimate divides into height and depth, the light and pure ascending to belong to Heaven.
Should one cultivate the utmost Dao, the body becomes a true immortal.
The practice overflows the three thousand count, the time spans forty thousand years.
The cinnabar terrace opens its treasure scrolls, the golden mouth transmits the flow.
The Great Brahmā, Lord of the Three Heavens, the Five Venerable Elders of the Void Sovereign—
even they scarcely glimpse the profound subtlety, how much less can it enter into words.
The jeweled throne descends upon the golden hall, the rosy coronet illumines the jade portico.
Myriad perfected ones attend the Emperor’s court, flying sandals tread upon the roots of clouds.
Misty as fine mist, drifting in gossamer robes,
exquisitely ascending with auspicious smoke, lightly following the soaring colored phoenix.
Having attended the banquet in the jasper chamber, suddenly they point toward the return to the grotto-heaven.
Standing by the Fusang shore, they swiftly ascend into the radiance of the Sun Emperor.

**Three Bows**
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Sections of Venerable Scriptures.
We, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**
We, the humble servants so-and-so and others, reverently reaffirm our sincerity and humbly address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;
the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and the hosts of sagely and true virtues;
the Heavenly Worthies and Perfected Ones; the Great Thearchs and Heavenly Emperors; the Heavenly Master Lords;
the High Ministers and High Chancellors; the Four Offices and Five Emperors; the Thirty-Six Sections of Venerable Scriptures;
the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; and all the honored spirits of the Three Realms’ official retinues.

We have gained access to the Dharma gate and participated in the cultivation of secret subtleties.
The jade caskets of treasure scrolls, the true instructions and numinous teachings—
we have been able to follow and practice them, widely propagating their divine transformations.
Prostrating, we trace the profound intent and rely upon the scriptures and diagrams.
Establishing teachings and founding merit, salvation of beings is the root.
Thus the Jade Dawn Great Sage, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
has extended the bridge of ten thousand practices and opened the eight gates of deliverance.
The departed souls of the Yellow Springs, the bound spirits of the endless night—
they are moistened by beneficent dew to become cool and refreshed, illumined by compassionate light to transcend and be saved.
Though moved beyond measure of kalpas, all are preserved in safety.

The fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, grieves deeply for the departed soul and aspires to its deliverance and ascent.
Fearing that since its birth and from time without beginning,
the six desires and ten entanglements have indulged in transgressions and faults;
the six emotions and three karmas have accumulated offenses and errors through kalpas;
unawakened to the true and correct, unaware of prohibitions and taboos;
riding the wrong and treading the evil, day by day and month by month deepening the burden—
it has offended the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth, violated the offices of yin and yang.
Its name is inscribed in the earthly registers, its soul imprisoned in the dark prison.
It does not behold the light, nor has it any means of deliverance.
Therefore, binding the body and dedicating the life, it repents and confesses its faults and flaws.
We have arrayed the altar precincts, following the ritual codes and forms.
Silk and ritual offerings, oil lamps, candles, incense, and flowers—
earnestly and sincerely, we look up in hope of communion and response.
Prostrating, we implore the Perfected Ones and Lofty Sages, the honored spirits of the Ten Poles,
to open boundless grace and descend the great compassionate blessings.
We pray that they command the flying divine persons of the ten-directional worlds,
in accordance with the registers of the Three Scriptures, to proclaim the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandates,
opening and releasing the soul-spirits in Mount Tai, Fengdu, the Thirty-Six Prisons,
and the Earth Offices of the Five Marchmounts.
May they dissolve and dispel the karmic adversities,
emerge from the darkest depths, and enter the court of blessings and goodness.
Refined by the Great Harmony, bathed in numinous blessings,
their sins and evils are washed away, their forms and souls purified and tempered.
They bathe in the Palace of Cinnabar and Fire, pass through the Offices of the Yang Grottoes,
depart from sorrow and affliction, and behold and hear the Dharma sounds.
May they swiftly ascend the stages of the Dao, benefiting and pacifying the living.
May the entire household enjoy blessings, and the kinfolk be peaceful and secure.
May it extend universally to the hidden and manifest, broadly encompassing the moving and growing.
Together they may fear the wondrous joy and all accord with non-action.
Where the sagely power extends, all under Heaven are wholly saved.
Above, it manifests the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassionate blessings;
below, it fulfills our repentance and confession.
We humbly make this known.

**Invoking the Ten Thoughts**
First thought: For the four great elements of the Dao, in harmony with the virtue of the fast’s sponsor,
may the seven generations of parents be spared from falling into sorrow and suffering,
ascend to the Heavenly Palace, and have clothing and food naturally provided.

Second thought: For the emperor and the lord of the state, may the Dao’s transformation flourish and prosper.
May the schools and academies be thriving, the imperial teachings vast and expansive.
May the majestic deportment be reverent and solemn, universally regarded by all under Heaven.
May the people praise the Great Peace, and the four barbarians submit in reverence.
May evil and perversity self-destruct, and sages and worthies naturally arise.

Third thought: For the Dharma Master, may great merit be established.
May the teachings be clear and far-reaching, and all attain the flight of immortals.

Fourth thought: For fellow practitioners of the same aspiration,
may they swiftly attain the immortal Dao and mutually enlighten and deliver one another.

Fifth thought: For the nine relations to be harmonious, esteeming benevolence and righteousness.
May they honor the Dao and despise wealth, their conduct a model for all beings.

Sixth thought: For self-denial, bestowing alms upon Daoist masters and the hungry and cold.
May all the people under Heaven each attain their rightful place.

Seventh thought: For the crawling and creeping, all sentient beings,
may they all receive accomplishment.

Eighth thought: For pardoning past lives’ karmic retributions in this present existence,
may they establish merit to compensate for transgressions.

Ninth thought: For the flourishing of the household,
may the ancestral temples have descendants, and worthy talents arise in every generation.

Tenth thought: For reverently receiving the scripture masters, never daring to slacken in equanimity,
with one mind broadly delivering all, may they swiftly attain the ascent to immortality.
Ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, they may pay homage to the Supreme.
Forever becoming perfected persons, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages,
harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

**Returning the Incense Burner**

Fragrant Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attendant Fragrant Spirits, may they cause this place of my audience with the Primordial to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here, assembling before the grotto’s incense burner. May they illumine my body with golden radiance, severing the roots of the womb’s bonds. May the Seven Mysteries be uprooted, and the hundred passages perfected in immortality. May the register of death be dissolved, and may I sit in repose at the Mud-Pill Palace. May the Eastern Florescence record my name, and may I be inscribed in the Register of the Void and Profound. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, conveying the words I have just uttered swiftly to the August Presence of the Supreme, the Boundless Dao, the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, before the Golden Portal and Jade Throne.

**Advancing and Withdrawing During the Procession of the Dao**
Entering the chamber, each bows to the master and contemplates as prescribed.

**Guardian Spirits**
Cinnabar numina and vermilion flames, blazing auroras and surging winds. The crimson wheel turns with刚 vigor, the celestial light radiating through the eight directions. Its might bursts forth, enveloping all, transforming myriad realms. Molten gold scatters and falls, while demonic hordes vanish without trace. It repels evil and shatters malevolence, illuminating the primordial merit. The golden talismans summon and command, treading clouds and spurring dragons. Songs of celebration resound, scattering flowers across the vast heavens. The numinous transformation operates in hidden motion, bringing peace and prosperity to the four extremities. Prostrating before the August Emperor, none dare be irreverent.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**
The Supreme Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Dao summons forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Messengers, the Golden Youths of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmitted Words and Scattered Flowers, and the Fragrant Officials of the Five Emperors and the Direct Day, thirty-two each, to emerge. Those who emerge shall solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar to the Celestial Divine Lords, and summon the local earth deities and true officials of this realm. As I now proceed with the Dao, I reverently memorialize the intent of this rite, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into my body. May what I have memorialized swiftly reach the August Presence of the Supreme, the Boundless Dao, the Void and Spontaneous, before the Golden Portal and Jade Throne.

**Declaring Dharma Ranks**
We, your humble servants of such-and-such ranks, together with utmost sincerity, reverently memorialize the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor on High, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the Lords and Elders of the myriad true beings, the thirty-six Celestial Emperors, the Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numen, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Metropolis, Golden Portal, Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the thirty-six revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all the true numina of the three realms’ official retinues. We, having long been favored by the mysterious destiny and gained access to the Dharma gate, have glimpsed the numinous chapters and followed the precepts and canons.

May we dwell in mountain vales and secluded grottoes, vanish our traces by numinous springs. Casting off the clamor of the dusty world, we refine ourselves in secret wonders. Yet the true and merciful nurture all beings as their first priority; the Great Dao delivers humanity by establishing merit as its foundation. Thus we humbly petition for salvation, universally extending to both the hidden and the manifest. Though the dead may plead for deliverance, their karmic bonds are not easily severed. Now, in accordance with the sacred decree, how dare we not make this known above?

Having recited the petition and verified its words, we find the supplicant’s aspiration lies in liberation and salvation. In this long night of the unseen, compassion and sorrow are our duty. We reflect that the Great Image divides its form to endow life and nurture essence. Riding harmony and yielding to fate, we embody earth and emulate heaven. Yet the void and purity are difficult to preserve, and the mechanisms of karma easily lead astray. Consciousness drifts with the dust, illusory realms shift and change. Transgressions and errors abound, the tally of sins is immeasurable. Sunk in the eternal night of the underworld, redemption seems impossible across countless kalpas. Only through devoted cultivation may we hope for ascent and deliverance.

Therefore, we lay bare our hearts before the Three Caverns and surrender our lives to the hosts of heaven. The Yellow Register unfolds its rites of repentance and deliverance; the Mysterious Capital possesses the ranks for the transference of spirits. With utmost sincerity and purity, we seek to atone for our faults and transgressions. Each of us directs the cinnabar heart, praying for auspicious blessings.

Today, at the midpoint of the ritual circuit, the assembly of Dharma practitioners raises the first incense offering. May the smoke of this incense ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the revered spirits of the state altars and the ancestral sages of our lineage. May they ascend and wander in the true realms, transcend and attain the ranks of immortality. May they feast in the Southern Palace and bestow blessings upon the Northern Gate. May the imperial destiny endure forever, the sagely lifespan extend boundlessly. May the sound of their teachings spread across the eight seas, uniting the chariots and writings of the ten thousand nations.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sagely Host of Master and Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

At this midpoint of the ritual, we, the assembly of the Dharma, raise the second incense offering. May the smoke of this incense ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.

We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so.

May the nine generations and seven lineages, the myriad ancestors of countless generations, emerge from the realm of dark yin and ascend to the land of purity. May they receive blessings in the Vermilion Mound, refine their spirits in the Elixir of Cinnabar. May the departed souls and shadowed consciousnesses wash away their long-standing stains. May their names fall from the ledgers of sin and be inscribed in the Azure Palace. May they transcend the苦 realms, be released from the prisons of darkness. May they ascend to the Court of Eternal Joy and attain the fruit of non-action.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sagely Host of Master and Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

At this midpoint of the ritual, we, the assembly of the Dharma, raise the third incense offering. May the smoke of this incense ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.

We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so.

May their kin and karmic relations together partake in this sublime fortune. May their official emoluments endure and their lifespans extend, their sins be eradicated and their calamities dispelled. May this broadly extend to all beings, reaching even the most distant and conscious. May all together ascend to the realm of longevity and bathe in the mysterious compassion.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sagely Host of Master and Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

The rites are complete; we repent.

Let each visualize the nine-hued perfect image, swallow the saliva, and intone the secret incantation to command demons. Stepping into the void, circling and revolving—
our cloud-steps ascend the celestial net,
where the heavenly winds blow with a sudden rush.
Robes flutter, brushing the Dipper’s handle;
we hold jade tablets and bow to the Banner of Three Stars.
Lions bear vermilion tassels in their jaws,
while qilin lead jade-green chariots.
In flight we traverse the eight directions,
how often have we seen spring branches bloom?
Dark locks rise beneath scarlet headbands,
azure mists weave through feathered robes.
At dawn we hasten to the Palace of Yang Virtue,
by night we arrive at the Moon’s Radiant Gate.
We grasp and play with the fires of the celestial sphere,
then conceal and withdraw like Lu Ji’s steed.
The Jade Chamber cannot retain us—
we soar back toward the ninefold heavens.
Water is sprayed to subdue demonic palaces,
lamps are lit to illuminate the nocturnal courts.
The winds of the nine heavens fall silent,
the qi of the four poles clarifies.
We chant and sing in the Vermilion Mound,
soaring through the White Jade Capital.
How shall we offer our utmost sincerity?
May the nation’s blessings endure in eternal peace.

Threefold prostration:
We, your servants, reverently bow our heads to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, reverently bow our heads to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, reverently bow our heads to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

Reaffirming the sacred ranks:
We, your humble servant so-and-so, now respectfully readdress and supplicate the Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the boundless hosts of Dao and virtue in the ten directions; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Officers, the Four Administrations and Five Emperors, and all divine officials and numinous beings of the Three Realms.

We have heard that the Most Sagely One, in compassion, opened the eight gates to deliver the suffering; the true scriptures unfolded transformations, spreading the Three Caverns to ferry humankind. Their grace extends to the hidden and the manifest, their blessings pervade heaven and earth. Having encountered this decree, we now exhaust our sincerity, establishing merit to propagate the Dao and uphold its luminous teachings.

The patron of this retreat, so-and-so, for the sake of the departed soul—whose form was shaped in remote antiquity, whose qi was received from the primordial heavens—from beginningless time until this day, has followed the turning of karmic conditions, deluded within the dream-realm. The six senses stirred dust, the ten fetters obscured the nature. Easily were sins born, swiftly did transgressions accumulate. Some offenses violated the true numina, others transgressed prohibitions and taboos, offending the heavenly Dao above and disrupting the earthly shades below. There were instances of intentional killing or accidental harm, greed for wealth that harmed righteousness. They lacked the virtue of compassion and yielding, disrupted the harmony of ritual and music. They encroached upon and harmed living beings, damaged and destroyed creatures’ lives. Their sins bound the courts of the Three Officials, their names filled the registers of the Five Emperors. Since the body’s dissolution, they have faced karmic retribution—some detained in the dark prisons, others adrift in alien destinies. Endlessly they wander in the long night, with no means of deliverance.

Thus, we gather our hearts in prayer, pouring out our pleas to heaven. We present patterned silks to fulfill the rites of supplication, prepare dragon-brocade tokens to convey the pledges for the soul’s ascent. We kindle the Nine Dark Lamps to illuminate the long night, perform the rites to the ten directions’ sagely titles to open the path through dense darkness. Above, we report to the various heavens; below, we notify the various earths, extending to the realms of the Five Peaks and Fengdu, the paths of the three evil destinies and six destinies. May the dew of compassion quench their scorching toil, may the winds of mercy dispel their burning afflictions. May enmities be reconciled, debts and disputes resolved. May the black ledgers on Mount Fengdu be burned, the red records on the Southern Culmen inscribed. May a thousand transgressions and ten thousand errors all be expunged. May they be refined in the Court of Flowing Fire, their souls purified in the Palace of Lesser Yin. Ascending to the ranks of immortals, they shall ride the celestial thoroughfares. Thus, may the Three Luminaries shine upon the Two Modes, may the Five Weapons be sheathed and the Hundred Grains flourish. May the celestial mandate abound, the sagely lifespan extend. May the dragon spirits endure, secretly aiding wind and rain. May all living beings be harmoniously nurtured, all in the patron’s household—living and deceased—receive blessings, their kin prosper. May the dark courts and nether ferries together attain true fruition. Above, may this manifest the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy; below, may it fulfill our devotion in taking refuge.

Respectfully submitted for your attention.

The Primordial One gathers the spirits, Heaven and Earth unite in harmony.
Jade talismans and precious seals summon the subtle and hidden.
Fire is cast, might is displayed—no treachery or evil lingers.

We, your servants, have been blessed to ascend this sacred path, encountering the turning of the Dao’s fortune.
Golden scriptures expound the teachings, jade tablets reveal the charts.
We wear the numinous texts and uphold the wondrous instructions.
We reflect that the August Void established the ultimate, the Supreme suspended the ordinances.
Grace extends to the hidden and manifest, mercy suffuses the living and the dead.
In the Northern Feng nightly courts, divine light bestows the compassion of illumination;
In the Southern Huo immortal precincts, true standards display the ranks of transcendence.
From kalpas beyond measure to this very hour,
Numinous blessings wash away the dust of toil, the Dharma boat ferries the drowned and lost.
Rescuing the living, delivering the dead, aiding the state and benefiting the people.
The wondrous pivot and mystic axis bring protection to humans and heavens.

We, your servants, aspire to propagate the profound and abstruse, to transfer and protect the living and the departed.
Whatever is prayed for, by principle, should be reported.
Moreover, as we receive these sacred commands, how dare we not make them known above?

**Reading the Petition**
As the petition states, the matters at hand are vast in their salvation.
The fast’s sponsor, [Name], sincerely cultivates and reverently upholds, earnestly seeking to honor the departed.
To rescue the courts of the night’s darkness, to grieve the suffering of the nether springs.
With devout sincerity in this fast and offering, may resonance be attained.

We, your servants, follow the Numinous Treasure’s revered scriptures and the Perfected’s highest ranks.
We open the jade caskets and numinous coffers to deliver the night’s darkness and the drowned.
Relying on the flying heavenly divine beings, we proclaim the karmic bonds of sin and fortune;
Facing the revealed ordinances of deliverance, we establish the altar grounds.
Silken candles and fragrant flowers express the sincerity of our hearts.
We present the petition and transmit the requests, reporting to the myriad heavens.
We hope that blessings will cover the yin and the hidden, grace will extend to families and the state.

With this falling twilight, as the Dao is practiced, we, the assembled Dharma hosts, now offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full devotion, reverently relying on the Supreme Three Worthies.
May these merits flow to the ancestral temples and former spirits, transcending the three realms.
May the emperor and lords of the realm emulate the virtue of the Two Modes.
May the phoenix calendar extend its vastness, the dragon charts endure eternally.
May the celestial origin be bright and serene, the earthly records secure and peaceful.
May wind and rain come in due season, all living beings enjoy health and prosperity.

Now, therefore, we kindle this incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Hosts of Master and Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with reality.

As twilight lingers and the Dao is practiced, we, the assembled Dharma hosts, now offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Sutra Treasure of the Dao.

May those sunk in the six destinies, those suffering in the three paths, find release from the ledgers of karmic transgression, their sins erased in the courts of the unseen. May their souls be refined in the Cavern of Yang, their spirits born anew through the Elixir of Cinnabar. May the icy springs of the Night Palace know no labor of retribution; may the gates of hell and the dark passes transform into realms of cool purity.

May the far-reaching power of the sages bathe them, that they may hear the sutras and awaken to the Dao.

The rites are complete; we now offer repentance.

**Threefold Invocation Hymn**

The Law is my bride, the sutras my pearls and jade.
I hold the precepts to curb the six passions,
mindful of the Dao to cast off desire.
In stillness, the upright qi abides;
in serenity, the spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and guard—
life after life, they receive great fortune.
The household and kingdom flourish in splendor,
the Dao and its teachings thrive in majesty.
Heaven and humankind share this vow,
soaring into the Great Vehicle.
By the heart’s resolve, the field of merit is sown;
the Wheel of Dharma ascends in boundless motion.
Seven generations of ancestors rise to heaven,
while this body soars in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the profound void—
with thought, none fails to harmonize.
Refining the form to join the immortals,
one attains the adamantine body.
Transcending the three realms’ trials,
the five hells’ torments are dissolved.
All return to the Supreme Scriptures;
in silent devotion, we bow in reverence.

**Threefold Prostration**
We, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity,
paying homage to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity,
paying homage to the thirty-six revered scriptures.
We, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity,
paying homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirmation of Dharma Ranks**
We, your humble servants, [Names], now reverently address
the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;
the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;
the Supreme Lord Lao;
the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao, the Host of Virtuous and Perfected Heavenly Worthies;
the Great Thearchs and Heavenly Emperors;
the Heavenly Masters and Lords;
the Supreme Ministers and Prime Ministers;
the Four Offices and Five Emperors;
the thirty-six revered scriptures;
the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;
and all responsive and perceptive numinous spirits of the three realms.

We, though base and insignificant, have been permitted to partake in the Great Dharma.
The Three Vehicles unfold their transformations,
the supreme Dao radiates its light.
Dragon-script and phoenix-writ,
celestial chapters and jade precepts—
all have we received and pledged to uphold.
Yet we have not hidden in secluded forests,
nor dwelled in realms beyond the world,
aspiring to ascend on high,
renouncing the dusty realm.
Instead, we drift with the mundane,
mingling with the common throng.
Transgressions accumulate unceasingly,
devotion falters in constancy.
Still, we strive to propagate the teachings’ rites,
to expound the wondrous instructions,
to ferry beings and deliver creatures,
to aid the state and establish merit.
We offer our sincere devotion,
hoping to assist the mysterious transformation,
that all may enter the Dharma-gate,
opening blessings for the living and the dead,
safeguarding the hidden and the manifest.

Now, the patron of this rite, [Name], has set forth their vows and pledges,
presenting their sincerity as offering.
Following the canonical rites,
we undertake this fast and vigil.
Beneath the Three Luminaries, we humbly plead;
before the myriad sages, we prostrate in devotion.
We kindle the Nine Dark Lamps,
illuminating the three paths’ sins and sufferings,
dispelling their gloom,
ushering in radiant light.
We perform the Dao, recite the scriptures,
and repent with utmost sincerity.

We reflect that the departed spirits,
through countless kalpas,
have cast off bodies and assumed new forms,
cycling through rebirth.
Some are born in heaven,
some descend among humankind,
some dwell in the Central Kingdom,
others in distant lands.
Some are noble, some base,
some rich, some poor.
Some fail to awaken to good causes,
some never encounter the true Dharma.
Some cling to falsehoods, scorning the true;
some envy the worthy, slandering the good.
Some tread crooked paths, coveting gain;
some sever human bonds, forsaking love.
Some harm living creatures,
offering wanton sacrifices and taking life.
Some endanger others for their own safety,
harming others for personal gain.
The ten evils and three karmic deeds
plant the roots of sin.
Indulging desire, unrestrained,
they wallow in excess.
Some angle in rivers or hunt at night,
burn forests or drain mountains.
Some impose unjust punishments,
inflicting harm against reason.
Some, as ministers, are disloyal;
some defile the Three Luminaries,
cursing thunder and rain.
Some disrespect heaven and earth,
fearing no divine judgment.
The sins they commit
are beyond measure.
Some bear unresolved grudges,
unsettled debts from past lives.
Unresolved retributions,
deep afflictions unrepented—
after death, they drift into the Three Offices,
enduring agony,
their souls imprisoned in darkness.
Beneath the Yellow Springs,
within hell’s depths,
they sink into eternal night,
the path of life severed.
For eons, they suffer,
with no means of deliverance.
Some endure confinement,
some face interrogation and torture.
They bear mountains, haul stones,
draw from the boundless sea.
Driven by lightning, chased by thunder,
they toil without rest.
In darkness, they receive their due—
when will they return?
Without the Great Dao’s mercy,
the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion,
this torment would know no end,
no path to repentance and liberation.

Now, with a single thought of utmost sincerity,
we purify our hearts and turn toward the Dao.
May all boundless suffering
be pardoned and absolved.
We humbly pray that the departed,
through countless kalpas and generations,
may receive this sublime merit,
all ascending to heaven.
May their tombs remain secure,
lawsuits cease.
May the Nine Springs’ torments end,
the dark night brighten.
May the six paths and four births,
all beings with consciousness,
together reach the shore of fortune,
attaining the true and real.

May the Dao’s transformation flourish,
the Two Modes remain steadfast.
May the Three Luminaries shine brightly,
the imperial enterprise prosper afar.
May cultural unity prevail,
warfare and strife cease.
May weapons, plagues, floods, fires, droughts, and locusts
no longer afflict the people,
no longer invade the realm.
May the people enjoy wealth and longevity,
the world know peace and harmony.
May the patron’s household and kin
ever receive the mysterious protection,
a thousand disasters dispelled,
ten thousand virtues nurtured.
May all prayers and supplications
be answered and conveyed,
all repentances and thanksgivings
be felt and reciprocated.
Above, may the Heavenly Worthy’s compassionate grace descend;
below, may our repentant sincerity be met.

**Vows**
First, may the Great Dao spread far and wide,
all under heaven embracing its virtue.
Second, may all sentient beings
awaken to the Dao.
Third, may the sorrowful souls of the Nine Nights
find liberation at once.
Fourth, may the lonely, unattached spirits
all receive rebirth.
Fifth, may the world know peace,
the five grains ripen in abundance.
Sixth, may ministers be loyal, children filial,
rulers benevolent, fathers kind.
Seventh, may the four seas unite,
enemies and kin reconcile.
Eighth, may the hidden and the unborn
all come to life and thrive.
Ninth, may chronic and acute illnesses
swiftly heal.
Tenth, may the destitute and orphaned
abound in clothing and food.

**Reigniting the Incense Burner**
Incense Officials and Envoys,
Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
Attendant Incense Spirits—
may this place of our Daoist practice
naturally yield golden elixir, cinnabar,
and azure mushrooms.

May the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings
gather here in assembly,
before the grotto’s incense burner.
May I, who study the Dao, attain the Dao;
may I, who seek immortality, attain immortality.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions
receive this fragrant smoke,
and swiftly convey the words I have just uttered
directly to the Jade Throne of the Supreme Vast Dao,
before the Golden Gates of the Infinite.

*Entering the Chamber*
Circling the altar, beginning from the East, the five directions are honored with incense.
Incense is offered at the Master’s table.
Incense is offered with the secret mantra.
Incense is offered at each station.
Each bows to the Master, visualizing as prescribed.

*Guarding the Spirits*
At dawn’s radiant clarity, purple mist rides the sky.

On this auspicious day, the ritual proceeds,

Jade blossoms unfurl, rainbow banners swirl.
Heavenly light descends in gaze,

All beings receive universal deliverance,
boundless blessings flow without end.

*Striking the Dharma Drum twenty-four times*

Supreme Mysterious Origin, Supreme Lord of the Dao,
summon forth from within this servant’s body:
the Three and Five Merit Officers,
the Left and Right Envoys,
the Golden Lads who attend incense,
the Jade Maidens who transmit words,
the Five Thearchs’ Direct Messengers,
and the Incense Officials of the Day—
thirty-two of each—
to emerge in full regalia.
Let them swiftly report to the local earth gods and territorial deities,
the true officials and rightful spirits of this place,
that I now, on behalf of the petitioner’s intent,
pray for the descent of the wondrous qi of the Lingbao’s spontaneous divine vitality,
to flow into our bodies,
so that the words I have uttered
may swiftly reach the Jade Throne of the Supreme Vast Dao,
before the Golden Gates of the Void and Spontaneous.

*Each declares their dharma rank*

Your humble servant, [Name], in full sincerity, together with all present, respectfully petitions:
the Spontaneous and Vast Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning,
the Supreme Lord of the Infinite Dao,
the Supreme Lord Lao,
the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven,
the host of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions,
the perfected lords and venerable masters,
the thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs,
the Jade Clarity Thearch,
the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital,
the Golden Waves of the Seven Treasures,
the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace,
the Lingbao Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness,
the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
and all the true spirits of the three realms’ officialdom.

We prostrate ourselves and recall:
when the great transformation first divided,
all beings received their endowment.
Yin and yang rise and fall,
determining life and death;
rewards and punishments, seen and unseen,
manifest sin and fortune.
From ancient times to the present, nothing has erred;
great and small alike are justly measured.
The supreme Dao proclaims its compassionate salvific decrees,
while the Lingbao scriptures prescribe rites of repentance and prayer.
Relying on this retreat’s offerings,
we seek to deliver the dim and benighted.
Having been entrusted with this office,
we have glimpsed the profound mysteries.
Whatever we now declare,
how dare we not make known above?

*Reading the Petition*
As the words of the petition state, we devote ourselves deeply to cultivation and reverence.

We turn our thoughts to the myriad generations of ancestors—both inner and outer kin—and to all departed spirits, bound through kalpas past. Some bear sins beyond absolution, grievous transgressions without measure, knotted fast and never undone. They may dwell in the ten directions of the cosmos, within the Five Peaks or the Nine Netherworlds, or under the governance of the Water Palace or Earth Bureau, confined in the dark courts of night, where wretched souls and suffering shades are held fast in the depths of the Yellow Springs. There, they endure the torments of water, fire, wind, and blade, day and night, their forms and spirits broken, their pain unbearable. Their afflictions extend to descendants, calamity flowing to later generations. In the endless dark of the netherworld, there is no path to liberation. Following the scriptural ordinances, we humbly seek their deliverance. Through the earnest observance of this retreat and the rites of repentance, we beseech mercy, offering our sincere devotion and praying for the gaze of the Mysterious One.

At this moment, as [Name] conducts the ritual and the assembly of the dharma invokes the first offering of incense, may this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in reverence, and turn in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to [Name]’s family—thirty-six generations, nine ancestors, seven lineages—and to all departed spirits and hidden souls. May the radiance of the divine descend to illuminate the ninefold darkness, and may the power of the Dao suffuse all, ending the trials in every prison. May enmities dissolve, sins be absolved, souls bathed in the Pool of Flowing Fire, and rebirth granted within the Palace of Southern Florescence. May celestial robes adorn their forms and the dew of wisdom purify their hearts. May they forever sever evil ties and forever ascend to the realm of blessings.

Now, as incense is kindled, we take refuge in the great sagely assembly, the perfected virtues of the Most High, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.

As [Name] conducts the ritual and the assembly of the dharma invokes the second offering of incense, may this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in reverence, and turn in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to the state, to the august rites of the Nine Temples, and to the ancestral sages of the imperial line. May their spirits gather in the Crimson Towers, bestowing blessings upon the grand design. May the emperor’s virtue align with the Three Absences, his benevolence spread to the Nine Realms. May the realm enjoy peace, wind and rain be harmonious. May his reign surpass that of the Zhou in longevity, and his transformative influence shine as brightly as the Han’s. May weapons remain sheathed, and all within the four seas thrive in tranquility.

Now, as incense is kindled, we take refuge in the great sagely assembly, the perfected virtues of the Most High, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.

As [Name] conducts the ritual and the assembly of the dharma invokes the third offering of incense, may this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in reverence, and turn in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act bring fortune to [Name]’s family, that they may forever enjoy blessings and auspiciousness, all attaining purity and good fortune. May disasters vanish before they arise, sins be extinguished without limit. May the nine clans and six relations together receive the mysterious protection. Extending to all beings—whether soaring or creeping, animate or inanimate, sentient or insentient—and to those in the dark paths of hell, the four modes of birth, and the six destinies, may the wind of the Dao spread afar, and the sagely grace suffuse all. May all awaken to Non-Action and ascend through every rank.

Now, as incense is kindled, we take refuge in the great sagely assembly, the perfected virtues of the Most High, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.

The rites are now complete.

To the East, we wholeheartedly take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the East, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Eastern Realm. With three bows, we reverently repent and offer thanks. After this repentance, we now kindle incense, dedicating it to so-and-so’s establishment of the wondrous retreat for the *Lingbao* Rite of Deliverance from Torment, wherein we recite scriptures and perform the Dao-circumambulation, repenting for the boundless sins of our countless ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.

These sins may include: straying from the true Dao, flattery and deceit without end; envy of the worthy and capable, defiling and disrupting the divine Dao; cruelty and violence without measure, slaughter driven by whim; betrayal of oaths and covenants, plotting with curses and hexes. Such transgressions have congealed and accumulated like mountains, their weight crushing, their punishments profound. Yet they remain unforgiven. The souls of the guilty are seized and struck, confined within the Wooden Bureau’s Eastern Peak’s Punishment and Torture Prison, subjected to the torments of copper pillars, iron beds, and golden hammers. Day and night, they endure agony, their suffering unrelenting, their rest and sustenance denied. They afflict the living with lawsuits, pleading for deliverance. Yet in the endless dark of night, no release is found.

Now, through this Dao-circumambulation and retreat, we pray for mercy and repentance to cleanse these sins. We humbly implore the great compassion to grant forgiveness, the power of the Dao to bestow its light. May a decree descend within the Eastern Bureau, at the gates of the Torture Office. May the torments of the living and dead be dissolved, their souls delivered and uplifted, receiving blessings in the Heavenly Halls. May the living ascend to the divine realms above, and the dark and light realms alike know peace. Bearing the mysterious grace, having attained the Dao, may they ascend into Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.

To the South, we wholeheartedly take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the South, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southern Realm. With three bows, we reverently repent and offer thanks. We now kindle incense, dedicating it to so-and-so’s establishment of the wondrous retreat for the *Lingbao* Rite of Deliverance from Torment, wherein we recite scriptures and perform the Dao-circumambulation, repenting for the boundless sins of our countless ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations, nine lineages, and seven branches—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.

These sins may include: inflicting cruelty and harm at will, slaughtering the innocent; breaking oaths and covenants, casting hexes upon beings.

Indulging in depravity and wantonness, violating and oppressing the chaste and upright. Defying the steps of goodness, creating sinful karma. Offending Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and all divine spirits. Their punishments are severe, their calamities profound, yet they have not received pardon. Their souls are seized and struck, confined within the Fire Bureau’s Southern Marchmount’s Punishment-Pounding Hell, enduring the torment of furnace and charcoal, scorched and broken by cruel punishments. Day and night, they are tortured and flogged, their pain and poison unbearable. The misfortune extends to their descendants, flowing endlessly without cease. In the boundless dark of the long night, there is no means of deliverance. Today, through repentance and the washing of hearts, through the establishment of the retreat and the performance of the Dao-circumambulation, we humbly implore the Three Worthies to witness and protect, the Great Saints to bestow compassion. We beseech the Fire Bureau of the Southern Palace and the wardens of the Punishment-Pounding Gate to absolve their accumulated sins and release the imprisoned souls. May they emerge from the Hell of Mount Huo, reborn within the Crimson Palace of Cavernous Yang. May their descendants receive blessings, forever bearing the grace of the divine. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into Non-Action, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

To the West,
we take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the West, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Western Realm. With three bows, we reverently repent and offer thanks. We now kindle incense, dedicating it to so-and-so’s establishment of the wondrous retreat for the *Lingbao* Rite of Deliverance from Torment, wherein we recite scriptures and perform the Dao-circumambulation, repenting for the boundless sins of our countless ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.

These sins may include: acting contrary to kindness and nurture, lacking benevolence and humanity, lacking loyalty and filial piety. Harming the good and upright, offending and defying the divine spirits.

Violating the Five Constants, indulging in all manner of evil. Engaging in curses and malevolent prayers, committing wanton and groundless acts. Their transgressions are grave, their calamities profound, yet they have not received absolution. Their souls and spirits are bound and confined within the Golden Bureau’s Hua Mountain Grinding Prison, enduring the torments of sword trees, blade mountains, and the sufferings of wind and thunder. Day and night, they are tortured and afflicted, their pain and poison unrelenting. Their grievances entangle their descendants, their misfortunes flowing into the present. In the endless darkness of the long night, there is no means of deliverance. Today, through repentance and supplication for mercy, we establish the wondrous retreat and perform the Dao-circumambulation. We humbly beseech the Great Compassion to bestow nurturing grace, that the myriad sages may turn their radiant light. We implore that a decree be issued within the Western Bureau, beneath the gates of the Grinding Officials. May the imprisoned and suffering be delivered, their souls and spirits absolved. May they be entrusted to the divine courtyards, reborn in the Pure Realms. May the living enjoy peace and prosperity, forever bearing the profound favor. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into non-action, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the True.

To the North:
With utmost sincerity, we reverently submit ourselves to the Boundless Great Dao of the North, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northern Realm. With three bows, we reverently repent and offer thanks. We now kindle incense, dedicating it to so-and-so’s establishment of the wondrous retreat for the *Lingbao* Rite of Deliverance from Torment, wherein we recite scriptures and perform the Dao-circumambulation, repenting for the boundless sins of our countless ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.

These sins may include: defying the heavenly Dao above, offending the earthly authorities below. Defiling the Three Luminaries, belittling the Four Great Elements. Harboring resentment against wind and rain, enlisting ghosts and spirits. Casting curses and hexes upon others, inflicting harm upon living beings. Their souls and spirits are arraigned and confined within the Water Bureau’s Zhen Mountain Grinding Prison, enduring the sufferings of freezing ice, nightly courts, and icy rivers. Their flesh and skin split from the cold, their pain and poison unbearable. They entreat the living, seeking deliverance and salvation. In the endless darkness of the long night, there is no means of release.

With this present Dao-procession and fast, we reverently confess and repent. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Honored and Great Sage to bestow boundless grace. May proclamation be issued within the Northern Bureau, beneath the gates of the Judgment Officers. May their offenses be pardoned, their suffering souls delivered and uplifted. May they depart the long night’s icy courts, escape the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. May they ascend to the Pure Realm, receiving blessings and protection for the living. May their clans and kin find peace, the living and dead alike prosper. Having fulfilled these vows, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious favor. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with truth.

In the northeast direction, we, your servants, wholeheartedly submit and entrust ourselves to the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the northeast quarter. We perform the Three Bows, each with reverent confession and repentance.

We now burn incense and dedicate this Numinous Treasure Expiation Fast for Deliverance from Judgment, reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-procession, confessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.

These sins may include: as children, failing in filial piety; as subjects, failing in loyalty; as fathers, lacking compassion; as rulers, lacking the Way. Envying the worthy, resenting the good, forsaking uprightness to embrace perversity.

Words at odds with the heart, self-deception before one’s own form and shadow. The Five Heinous Crimes committed in full, every evil act performed. Wrongfully harming the innocent, unjustly killing without cause. From life to death, grievances pierce the heavens above. Cursing the divine, invoking malevolent spells, resorting to sorcery and witchcraft. Calamity deep and transgressions grave—condemned to the Earth Bureau’s Lower Yuan, within the crushing prisons of judgment. Tortures of ten thousand kinds, body and soul broken and withered. In the endless dark of night, no means of deliverance to be found.

Now, in repentance we beg for mercy, establishing this fast and performing the Dao-procession. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the Ten Heavens will grant pardon, the Three Saints bestow grace. May a decree descend to the Earthly Mansion, to the gates of the Judgment Officials. May karmic retribution be dissolved, souls and spirits absolved. Freed from the realm of bondage, released from the suffering of heavy fetters. Bathed in the divine cinnabar and radiant fire, ascending the Scarlet Mound. Litigation forever dispelled, descendants at peace and prosperous. The living and the dead alike share in this blessing, looking up to receive the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into the realm of Non-Action.

In harmony with the Dao, united with true reality.

Southeast Quarter
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the southeast quarter. We perform the Three Bows, each with reverent confession and repentance.

We now burn incense and dedicate this Numinous Treasure Expiation Fast for Deliverance from Judgment, reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-procession, confessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.

These sins may include: secretly acting with violence, wantonly oppressing others; scorning the orphaned and destitute, despising the aged and infirm.

Revealing others’ faults while concealing their good deeds. Disrupting the proper order of kinship, suppressing the orphaned and weak. Scheming through unrighteous means, slandering sages and worthies. Undermining others’ accomplishments, envying those who surpass oneself. Inflicting harm and killing without just cause, acting wantonly as one pleases. Invoking Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars as witnesses—such sins run deep, and their retribution is severe. The souls are cast into the prisons of the Earth Bureau, where they endure the torments of water, fire, wind, and blade, day and night, without respite. The punishments are meted out in succession, with no means of deliverance.

Now, through this repentance and expiation, we perform the fast and Dao-procession. We prostrate ourselves in hope that the Perfected Saints of the Ten Directions and the August Lords of the Five Quarters will decree to the prisons of the southeast quarter, to the courts of the Judgment Officials, that the imprisoned souls be redeemed, their forms and spirits cleansed. May their accumulated sins be absolved, their long-standing calamities eradicated. May the living be guided onto the path of blessedness, receiving protection and favor. May misfortunes vanish into the Nine Yin, and disasters sink beneath the Four Boundaries. May both the living and the dead share in this felicity, forever bearing the profound grace of the Dao.

After attaining the Dao, they ascend into non-action, united with true reality.

Southwest Quarter
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the southwest quarter. We perform the Three Bows, each with reverent confession and repentance.

We now burn incense and dedicate this Numinous Treasure Expiation Fast for Deliverance from Judgment, reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-procession, confessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.

These sins may include: uttering deceitful and frivolous words, feigning falsehoods; deceiving both the wise and the foolish, insulting true sages.

Bullying the weak while submitting to the strong, insatiably greedy and sacrilegious.
Or contending for profit and wealth, mutually harming one another.
Or seeking glory and lusting after beauty, violating and oppressing the chaste and virtuous.
Swearing oaths and forging pacts, invoking spirits and summoning ghosts.
Thereby incurring karmic retribution, accumulating in the netherworld.
Souls are struck within the courts of Earth Prison, beneath the gates of the Judgment Officers.
Bound in layered pits, they never behold the light.
Subjected to interrogation and torture, they suffer endlessly without relief.
Now, by performing this fast and Dao-procession, we confess sins and beseech mercy.
We humbly implore the Most High Sages and Perfected Ones, in great compassion and forgiveness,
to let their divine radiance descend and illuminate the underworld.
We petition the Judgment Halls of the Southwest Quarter, the gates of the Judgment Officers,
to release the imprisoned souls and deliver them to the Pure Realms above.
May blessings extend afar, bringing peace to both the living and the dead.
Should our prayers be answered, we shall ever bear the profound grace of the Dao.
After attaining the Way, we shall ascend into non-action, united with true reality.

We now burn incense and dedicate this Numinous Treasure Expiation Fast for Deliverance from Judgment, reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-procession, confessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.

Deep calamities and heavy judgments remain unresolved through countless kalpas.
In the six destinies and three evil paths, they endure all manner of retribution.
Souls are seized and struck within the Earth Prison’s Judgment Halls, suffering unbearable torment, their afflictions extending to descendants.
Mutually flowing and perpetuating, their suffering spans eons without end.
Now, by confessing sins and establishing this fast, we beseech compassionate forgiveness.
We humbly implore the assembled Venerable Ones and Most High Sages to universally bestow their merciful radiance,
releasing the destitute souls and delivering them from dark suffering.
We petition the Judgment Halls of the Northwest Quarter, the gates of the Judgment Officers,
to wash away deep transgressions and dissolve accumulated grievances,
reconciling karmic enmity and delivering both the living and the dead.

We now burn incense and dedicate this Numinous Treasure Expiation Fast for Deliverance from Judgment, reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-procession, confessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.
Or offending the true Dao, defiling and disrespecting the Three Luminaries.
Baring the sacred before the gods, cursing and raging at thunder and rain.

Deceiving and deluding the true sages, unafraid of the unseen and manifest.
The Nine Bureaus bind their forms, the Three Offices raise their indictments.
Souls and spirits are seized and bound, within the Three Paths and Nine Dark Prisons of the grinding hells.
Dragged through the Cold Courts, shut in eternal night.
For countless eons in darkness, never beholding light.
Flowing into descendants, drawing in the living and the dead.
Mutually entangled and obstructed, with no means of cleansing.
Now, by performing the Dao-procession and establishing this fast, we lay bare our hearts in confession and repentance.
We humbly implore the Three Venerable Great Sages, the host of celestial perfected, the Three Luminaries and constellations, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors.
Together, may they bestow vast grace, universally descending great mercy.
Proclaiming to the hells of the lower quarter, to the courts of the Judgment Officials:
Absolve accumulated sins, deliver suffering souls.
Ascend into the Hall of Blessings, hear the scriptures and awaken to the Dao.
Living and dead alike at peace, all litigations forever dissolved.
All sentient beings together ascend the shore of fortune.
By this supplication, we receive the boundless grace.
United with true reality, we ascend into non-action.

**Lower Quarter**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the lower quarter. We perform the Three Bows, each with reverent confession and repentance.

We now burn incense and dedicate this Numinous Treasure Expiation Fast for Deliverance from Judgment, reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-procession, confessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.
Or falsely assuming the role of master, carving up the land, hills, ridges, and royal veins of the plains, damaging graves and temples.
Restraining and obstructing the spirits, blocking water sources, damming mountains and filling valleys.
Destroying city walls and altars of soil and grain, offending the lords and local officials.
Unafraid of the divine, wantonly committing transgressions.
Souls and spirits are struck and seized, within the Nine Dark Hells of the lower world.
Drawing from the River of Eternal Night to irrigate the Four Seas.
Bearing mountains and transporting stones, condemned to myriad labors.

The pain is boundless, enduring without end.
It extends upward to past lives, downward to descendants.
Karmic retribution remains unresolved, calamities weigh heavy with stern reckoning.

Now, by establishing this fast and performing the Dao-procession, we confess and uproot the roots of sin.
We humbly implore the Most Sacred Host of Venerables to open the streams of compassionate salvation.
We proclaim to the Nine Earths and Five Peaks, the Four Waterways and mountains and rivers,
to Mount Tai and the Dai Zong, to the Fengdu Underworld and the lower realms’ prisons of punishment,
to the courts of the infernal judges:
Absolve the accumulated sins of countless lives and kalpas.
Deliver the destitute souls, free them from dark suffering.
Let them wander in the true realm, dwell peacefully in the courts of fortune.
May descendants flourish, the living and dead share in blessings.
Should our plea be granted, we shall look up in profound gratitude for boundless grace.
After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the realm of Non-Action,
harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

To the Ten Directions, we wholeheartedly submit and entrust ourselves:
To the Perfected Great Sages of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao,
to the Most True Lords and Venerable Masters,
to the Divine Immortals of the Ten Lands and all spirit-officials—
we offer the Three Bows, each with utmost sincerity, confessing and giving thanks.

We, the assembled, dedicate body and spirit, submitting ourselves in devotion.
Now, by burning incense and performing the Dao-procession,
we establish the Supreme Lingbao Fast of Deliverance from Punishment for so-and-so,
confessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—
and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.
Some have offended the Great Sages of the Heavens, the Host of the Great Dao,
the Three Luminaries and Five Phases, the Sacred Host of the Void,
the spirits of wind, clouds, thunder, and rain, and all divine beings.
Some have violated the Five Peaks and myriad mountains, the Thirty-Six Earths,
the hills and water palaces, the officials of the underworld.
Some have defied sages and worthies, transgressed against benevolence and righteousness.
Some have desecrated ancient and modern sacred sites, contravened the Four Great Elements and Five Constants.
Each action has bound karmic causes, each has incurred retribution.
The Ten Evils have been fully committed, the Five Heinous Crimes repeatedly performed.
In life, no virtuous deeds; in death, only evil consequences.
Sunk in the Five Sufferings, dragged through the Three Wretched Paths.
Exiled souls endure hard labor, never granted pardon.

Now, by establishing this fast and performing the Dao-procession, we confess and uproot the roots of sin.
We humbly implore the Three Supreme Ones to open the streams of great compassion,
to send down the Mandate of the Nine Dragons.
We proclaim to all realms and the infernal courts of the judges:
Release the souls from eternal night.
Bathe them in the Crimson Mound’s courts, clothe them in the robes of the Cavern Yang’s palace.
Let them be born on the shores of blessed fortune, bestowing grace upon descendants.
May auspicious blessings draw near, the living and dead dwell in peace.
Should our plea be granted, we shall look up in profound gratitude for mysterious grace.
After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the realm of Non-Action,
harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

Each shall meditate on the Nine-Colored Perfect Image,
swallow the saliva, recite the secret demon-subduing incantation,
pace the void, circumambulate.
The Supreme Ultimate divides into height and depth,
the light and pure ascend to belong to Heaven.

One who cultivates the Perfect Dao,
the body becomes a true immortal.
Their deeds surpass the three thousand,
their time spans forty thousand years.
The cinnabar terrace opens its treasure scrolls,
the golden mouth transmits the flow.
The Great Brahmā, Lord of the Three Heavens,
the Void Sovereign, the Five Venerable Ones—
even they cannot fathom its subtlety,
how then could it be captured in words?
The jeweled throne descends in the golden hall,
the rosy coronet illumines the jade pavilion.
Myriad perfected ones pay homage at the imperial court,
their flying sandals treading the roots of clouds.
The melodies of Hua and Xia resound afar,
the cadence of human voices rises and falls.
In emptiness they return to virtue and power,
their turns and twists harmonizing with the celestial tones.
The halls are steeped in sandalwood’s fragrance,
the towers cool beneath the moon’s dew.
How shall utmost sincerity be offered in prayer?
May the harvests forever flourish in abundance.

**Threefold Reverence**
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.
We, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,
bowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.

**Reaffirming the Dharma Titles**
We, your humble servants, [names], reverently reaffirm our sincerity and humbly address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the Most High Dao Lord, and the Most High Lord Lao.
We, of lowly and insignificant station,
have received and upheld the precepts and ordinances.
Following the sacred decree,
our duty lies in delivering sentient beings.
We rescue and liberate the living and the dead,
that all may dwell in peace.
Whatever we declare,
we dare not withhold from your august hearing.

Now, there is [name], an official and devout believer,
who lays bare his sincerity and reveals his earnest plea.
He requests to perform a fast and vigil,
to repent of sins and beseech grace.
In accordance with the canons and ritual forms,
we have examined the mystic protocols.
We have heard that when ancestors do good,
blessings extend to their descendants;
when they do evil,
calamities flow to later generations.
The retribution of sin and fortune
follows like a shadow.
Without thorough repentance and prayer,
there is no means of cleansing.

The nine generations and seven ancestors of [name]’s family,
the recently departed and those long gone—
through countless kalpas,
they may have committed various transgressions:
violating the one hundred eighty prohibitions of the Three Primes,
or the fourteen categories of offenses in the Jade Treasury,
arising from the six senses,
the three karmas,
the ten evils,
and myriad wrongs,
all accumulated in the nether courts.

Perhaps their eyes were ensnared by the five colors,
unable to perceive the true and real;
their ears clung to the five sounds,
unable to hear the supreme principle;
their mouths craved the five flavors,
consuming and harming life;
their bodies were bound by the five entanglements,
tainted by desire and harming their nature.

Perhaps they offended the celestial Dao above,
violating the sun, moon, and stars;
or transgressed against the earthly darkness below,
and the mountains, rivers, hills, and temples;
or disrupted human affairs in the middle,
undermining the harmony of benevolence and righteousness.

As children and subjects, they were disloyal and unfilial;
as rulers and fathers, they were unprincipled and unkind.
Their words belied their hearts,
they envied the worthy and resented the good.
They harmed others and seized their possessions,
bullied the orphaned and impoverished.
They estranged kin and befriended the distant,
revered the perverse and turned from the upright.
They exploited wealth and usurped merit,
drained marshes and burned forests,
angled for the hidden and shot the roosting.
They flew hawks and coursed hounds,
slaughtering without end.

Or perhaps they caused strife among the nine clans,
violence among the six relations.
Their words lacked propriety and deference,
their actions were always invasive and deceitful.
As officials, they coveted wealth,
oppressed their superiors and tyrannized their subordinates,
seeking prestige through cruelty.
They flogged the innocent,
executed the guiltless.

Or they made oaths and curses,
invoking gods and spirits;
or undertook construction projects,
damaging graves and temples.
They followed their whims and indulged their desires,
entangling themselves in deep sin and calamity.
Their souls are bound to the three paths,
confined in eternal night.
They endure a thousand torments and ten thousand trials,
their suffering spanning countless kalpas.
The distant heavens are dim,
the bridge of the Dharma broken.
The dark hells below offer no escape,
thus bringing misfortune upon the living
and disasters upon their descendants.
Their endeavors falter,
their movements meet with misfortune.

Now, we pour out our hearts in earnest plea,
returning in repentance and prayer.
We implore the Three Treasures,
prostrating before all the heavens.
We humbly beseech the Great Sage to bestow mercy,
to universally grant pardon and forgiveness.
May the edict be issued to the Four Controllers, the Five Emperors,
and the mighty deities of the Three Realms,
to proclaim below to the Nine Dark Realms of the netherworld,
the judges and their subordinates,
to absolve and pardon the countless ancestors and myriad souls.
Release their sins and remove their transgressions,
reconcile grievances and dissolve faults.
Open the heavy prisons and dark dungeons,
liberate the suffering souls.
The sword trees lose their blades,
the knife mountains lay down their edges.
The frigid realms and eternal night
are filled with light.
Their refined essences ascend to the Southern Cinnabar,
their spirits rise to the Azure Vault.
They roam the Eight Scenic Realms,
ride the Ten Heavens.
The officials of the netherworld are promoted to Great Perfected,
soaring to the Golden Gates.
The calamities of [name]’s family cease,
blessings and grace draw near.
They ascend the steps of longevity and fortune,
enjoying the rewards of peace and integrity.

May all sentient beings of the four births and six destinies,
the conscious and the feeling,
through this merit,
together ascend the shore of the Dao.
May the three luminaries shine in mystery,
the six qi harmonize.
May the imperial reign be long,
and the world dwell in peace.
Above, may the great compassion of the Celestial Venerable be manifest;
below, may the sincerity of our repentance be answered.

**Vows**
First, may heaven and earth be bright and pure.
Second, may the atmosphere be clear and mysterious.
Third, may the sage enjoy ten thousand years of life.

**Reactivating the Incense Burner**
Incense Official Messengers,
Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense—
may this place where we offer incense
naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.
May the hundred spirits and myriad perfected ones
gather here before the incense burner.
May we who study the Dao attain the Dao,
those who seek immortality become immortals.
May the officiant receive blessings,
the living and the dead partake in grace.
May the words we have declared
swiftly reach the august presence of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao,
the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning,
in the Golden Gates and Jade Palace of the Void and Spontaneity.

**Verbal Petition**
We, your humble servants [names],
prostrate and humbly address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao,
the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning,
the Most High Great Dao Lord,
the Most High Lord Lao,
the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures,
the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm,
and all the spirit officials of the Numinous Treasure.
Having received the Orthodox and True,
we participate in the cultivation of secret wonders.
We aspire to expand the blessings of the fast,
to deliver living beings.

On the [day] of the [month],
for [name], on account of [matter],
we have conducted the Great Fast of the Numinous Treasure for Liberation from Torment,
repenting for the living and the dead,
dissolving grievances and torments.

**Incense Offering and Lamp Lighting**
We kindle incense and light lamps,
illuminating all heavens.
We chant the numinous sounds,
circumambulate in the Dao, and perform rites of repentance.
We liberate the bound spirits of countless generations of ancestors,
the imprisoned and exiled souls of the condemned.
We beseech deliverance from the Ten Sufferings and Eight Adversities,
guiding them to plant the roots of faith.
For so many days, so many nights,
we have circumambulated and recited the scriptures.

Now that the merit is complete and the affairs concluded,
we reverently dismantle the fast’s altar.
We summon the divine hosts—
the cavalry and mounts,
the spirit officials of the Numinous Treasure,
the inspectors and guardians of the fast,
and all those who diligently monitored and protected the rites—
to ascend to the True Palaces,
to be promoted as superior immortals,
and to receive ranks among the celestial hierarchy.

May we, your servants,
having fulfilled our merit and completed our practices,
ascend in radiance to the Nine Heavens.
May the sun and moon shine together,
may the Three Treasures gleam as one.
We humbly implore the Most High Saints
to witness and reflect upon our sincere hearts.

Should we, your servants,
in our movements or pauses,
have transgressed the statutes or failed to conform to the rites,
we beg forgiveness for these unwitting offenses.
May the Fivefold True Officials
be promoted and rewarded according to their merit.
Upon the completion of their duties,
may they ascend together with us.

We reverently submit this petition,
awaiting your august response.
With utmost reverence and awe,
we prostrate again and make this known.

Your humble servants, [names],
of [prefecture], [county], [abbey],
respectfully address
the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao of the Three Heavens of Primordial Beginning,
the Most High Lord Lao,
the Celestial Venerable,
the Heavenly Thearch,
the Nine Elder Immortal Lords of the Grotto-Heavens,
the Ninefold Qi Venerable,
the myriad layers of Dao-qi,
the Twelve Hundred Official Lords,
and the Jade Sovereign of the Great Clarity.

On the [day] of the [month] in the year of [cyclical sign],
at [location],
we humbly submit this petition.

Upon the conclusion of the rites,
we dismiss the Three Masters and others,
in accordance with the Numinous Treasure liturgy.

If the circumambulation spans only a single session,
no prior petition is required.
If it extends for a day and two nights or longer,
then, following the Numinous Treasure statutes,
petition the fast’s officers,
proclaim the prohibitions,
and expound the precepts.
After the merit-recitation,
restore the precepts and resume duties.
All matters must be conducted strictly according to the rites,
without careless deviation.

**End of Scroll Forty of the *Yellow Register Fast Rites***
**Beginning of Scroll Forty-One of the *Yellow Register Fast Rites***

**Collected by Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty**

**On Repentance**

To conduct the Dao and establish the fast, order is fundamental. Even slight disorder disrupts the proper form. When perception falters, ritual deportment and musical offerings falter in their reverence. Not only does this invite censure from the celestial courts, but it also risks ridicule from fellow practitioners.

Should wind and rain approach during rites at the open altar, or in the swelter of summer or the biting cold of winter; if dawn or dusk arrives untimely, or unexpected disturbances arise—halting the proceedings abruptly would cause panic and disorder, while adhering strictly to the statutes would delay and inconvenience. In such cases, the chief cantor may lead the assembly in *stepping the void* before the altar, invoking the divine. If the disturbance is severe, simplify the rites to their essence: the *Three Petitions* and *Great Thanksgiving* will suffice. Adapt to the moment, lest rigidity become one’s undoing.

**Twenty Directions’ General Repentance**

The assembled officers face north as the chief cantor intones:
*"We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Poles’ Heavenly Lords, the Three Luminaries and Five Peaks, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures, and all divine immortals and spirit-officials."*

After bowing, each repents with reverence. As the cantor invokes each direction, all bow once:
*"We humbly recall: the Dao acts through non-action, and virtue governs without dominion. It encompasses the myriad dharmas as the greatest within the realm and spans the nine schools to open the gate of all mysteries. The principles of good and evil are distinct, and the statutes of sin and blessing clearly manifest. Thus, the Vermilion Register of the Southern Palace records ascent as the reward for goodness, while the Black Book of the Northern Bureau inscribes death as the reckoning for transgression. These serve to punish and encourage, rescuing the benighted. Only after clarifying the origins of the teaching can one align with the intent of non-action.*

*Now, on behalf of the sponsor of this Great Yellow Register Fast, the official [Name], who cherishes loyalty and filial piety, and whose gratitude to sovereign and kin runs deep, we initiate this rite of incense and devotion to repay the kindness of nurture. With fragrant offerings, ritual gifts, dragon-jade, and patterned silks, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the perfected deities of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the True Lords of the Sacred Mountains and Grotto-Heavens, the Five Peaks, the Water Palaces’ revered spirits, the Three Treasures’ officials, the Ten Directions and Three Realms, and all true numina. We beseech the grace of celebration and bestowal, the descent of great compassion’s blessings.*

*May the sponsor’s [Name] household—ancestors of a hundred thousand generations, the wandering souls in the cold courts of eternal night—all be liberated. May the three affinal and five consanguineous kin, all relations and dependents, have their misfortunes erased from the Nine Yin and their blessings born in the Three Luminaries. May calamities cease, and longevity extend. May the Emperor’s sagacity surpass that of Fuxi and Shennong, his years equaling heaven and earth. May the Crown Prince and regional lords long assist in this flourishing era. May the Empress, consorts, and concubines forever uphold the sacred enterprise. May the myriad officials and feudal lords devote themselves to its support. May the four seas and ten thousand lands be transformed by unified culture. May weapons fall silent and wind and rain follow their course. May the sun and moon retain their purity, and the stars their proper motion. May Fengdu’s judgments be stayed, and all creatures dwell in safety. May we all embody the lineage of clarity and stillness, and together realize the Dao of the subtle and formless. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true."*

**Twenty Directions’ Sequential Repentance**

The assembled officers move left, stand facing east, and the chief cantor intones:
*"We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Eastern Direction’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm."*

After bowing, each repents with reverence.
*"Eastern Direction..."*

We, your humble servants, have heard that when the Lesser Yang establishes its position, it first opens the Azure Vault’s palace; when the virtue of Wood governs the direction, it unfolds the Blue Origin’s precinct. Issuing the spring mandate, all blossoms receive their beginning; emerging from the domain of Zhen, the imperial enterprise endures in prosperity. We should rely upon the nurturing benevolence of the Dao and exhaust our sincerest devotion in refuge.

Now, with reverence, we present the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, who bears the virtue of life-bestowing grace and feels the profound favor of Heaven and Earth’s shelter. In gratitude for past transgressions and to beseech blessings, he has established this retreat and practiced the Dao. We humbly offer a bolt of blue-green silk and a golden dragon, dedicating them to the Eastern Direction’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm.

We reflect that when the supreme Dao flows forth its compassion, all blossoms find peace; when the warmth of Yang spreads its transformation, all creatures shine in harmony. First, we pray for the extension of the imperial destiny and the well-being of the sagely person. Beyond the Fusang and Penglai Isles, may the world’s chariots share a single track; in the lands of Dongming and Sushen, may auspicious tributes be offered. Next, for the chief patron’s nine generations of lingering attachments, whose transgressions are recorded in the ledgers of Mount Tai, and for his five clans of kin, whose names are inscribed among the immortals of the Eastern Dipper: may misfortunes cease, and the span of fortune and longevity be prolonged. May past faults dissolve of themselves, and blessings of goodness gather abundantly. May all beings, seen and unseen, together bathe in the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

**Southern Direction**

We, your humble servants, have heard that when the Vermilion Heaven first opens, crimson clouds gather in the courtyard of flowing fire; when the Red Emperor establishes his capital, the scarlet qi solemnly adorns the palace of radiant rosy clouds. Spreading the numinous Yang to illumine the nine provinces, proclaiming the virtue of Fire to shine upon the depths of darkness, we rely upon the benevolence of nurturing growth and should offer our most earnest prayers.

Now, with reverence, we present the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, who contemplates the welfare of both family and state, extending to ruler and kin. In gratitude for past transgressions and to beseech blessings, he has established this retreat and practiced the Dao. We humbly offer a bolt of crimson silk and a golden dragon, dedicating them to the Southern Direction’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Southern Realm.

We reflect that when the virtue of Yang shines its illumination, no darkness remains unlit; when the supreme truth responds to beings, every feeling finds its answer. First, we pray for the sagely person’s supreme fortune and the flourishing of the great enterprise. May the red crow manifest its auspiciousness, and the vermilion phoenix arrive in ceremony. May border cities know no alarms of beacon fires, and distant lands present tribute by land and sea. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine generations and seven ancestors refining their essences in the Vermilion Mound, and his five clans and six relations whose names are inscribed on the cinnabar registers—may misfortunes cease, and past faults dissolve of themselves. May the span of fortune and longevity be prolonged, and blessings of goodness gather abundantly. May all creatures, sentient and insentient, together bathe in the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

**Western Direction**

We, your humble servants, have heard that the Great Emperor of the Golden Direction governs the jade towers to unfold the celestial plan, and the Heavenly Lord of Pristine Virtue resides in the gem-studded palace to expound the teachings. The rightmost reaches command the floating peaks of Mount Fu Luo, while the Western March divides the Supreme Wondrous Capital. We revere the majesty of autumn’s stern power, the hope of all creation.

Now, with utmost reverence, the chief patron of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, holds profound devotion to family and state, and weighty duty to sovereign and kin. To atone for transgressions and pray for blessings, he has established this retreat and practiced the Dao. We humbly present a bolt of plain-woven silk and a golden dragon, dedicating them to the Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Direction, the Heavenly Lords of the Seven Qi, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Western Quarter.

We note that the jade tablets have set forth the law, with deliverance as their foremost principle, and the golden perfection flows forth in grace, with nurturing compassion as its essence. First, we pray for blessings upon the sagely court, preserving the peace of the imperial throne. May the jade-sealed celestial records extend the imperial enterprise without end, and the white phoenix and pale unicorn manifest auspicious omens for eternity. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine generations of departed souls ascending to the hidden palaces of mystery, and his living kin whose names are inscribed in the Western Na’s realm—may disasters vanish before they arise, and new blessings descend. May all beings, moving and still, receive grace, and both the living and the dead know peace. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

**Northern Direction**

We, your humble servants, have heard that the fivefold qi, swirling and coalescing, congeals into the vastness of the Guanghan Palace, and the boundless yin, vast and distant, shapes the silent realm. Manifesting singular virtue to succor the ten thousand regions, and spreading supreme goodness to unfold the myriad wonders, we rely upon the mysterious transformation and present the sincerity of this retreat.

Now, with utmost reverence, the chief patron of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, holds weighty duty to sovereign and kin, and profound devotion to family and state. To establish this retreat, practice the Dao, atone for transgressions, and pray for blessings, we humbly present a bolt of dark-woven silk and a golden dragon, dedicating them to the Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northern Direction, the Heavenly Lords of the Five Qi, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northern Quarter.

We note that the mysterious virtue is impartial, circulating through the myriad lands, and its supreme merit extends afar, nurturing the six voids. We pray first that the sagely plan be upheld and the celestial longevity prolonged, as boundless as the deep sea and as enduring as the Northern Culmen. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine ancestors and seven departed kin—may they forever depart the dark prisons, leave the borders of Feng Du, and ascend to the vast palaces of the boundless. May his living kin be recorded in the mysterious registers. May calamities be eradicated and past faults silently dissolve. May fortune and longevity be renewed, and blessings and good fortune gather abundantly. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

**Northeastern Direction**

**Northeastern Direction**

We prostrate ourselves and hear: the verdant peaks of Mount Gen rise in emerald splendor, its flowing waters carrying the lingering ripples of Kan; the celestial vault floats in azure clarity, where the auspicious qi of Zhen Wood first stirs. Here, the supreme transformation is exalted in the realm of primordial vastness, and the divine breeze is fanned within the Purple Ultimate’s court. We gaze upward to the sagely virtue that brings forth life, awaiting the divine work that opens deliverance.

Now, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, holds foremost the state and family, extending to lord and kin. In repentance of transgressions and prayer for blessings, he establishes this retreat and practices the Dao. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Qi of Brahma Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northeastern Quarter.

We humbly observe: as harmonious warmth spreads, all beings—whether soaring or sinking—attain peace. The true essence moves alone, and numinous transformation knows no bounds. First, we pray that blessings extend to the ancestral line, aligning with the Two Modes to secure the altars of state; that the sagely sovereign’s glory be transmitted, equaling the Two Luminaries to illumine the ten thousand regions. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine generations and seven departed kin—may they shed their forms in the realm of empty song; may his six relations and five clans inscribe their names in the Palace of Bright Valley. May his lifespan be prolonged within, and calamities cease without. May the hidden and manifest rejoice together, and all creatures partake in glory. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

**Southeastern Direction**

We prostrate ourselves and hear: beneath the cinnabar towers, the qi of Brahma coalesces to form palaces; within the crimson courtyards, the winds of Xun stir to nurture all things. Here, the hundred valleys pay homage as to their source, and the three mountains display wondrous transformations. The permeating virtue knows no bounds, matching the mysterious work that does not act.

Now, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, holds deep loyalty to state and family, and profound duty to lord and kin. In repentance of transgressions and prayer for blessings, he establishes this retreat and practices the Dao. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Qi of Brahma Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southeastern Quarter.

We humbly observe: the great Dao’s vast compassion spreads its grace universally. It condenses the utmost truth to descend and aid, bestowing numinous blessings without omission.

We now humbly pray that the patron’s grand destiny of supreme fortune may rival the boundless vastness of the ocean’s depths, and that his sacred longevity may equal the towering heights of Penglai’s immortal peaks. May his nine generations of ancestors, their divine forms released, be freed from the dark gates of the earthly realm; and may his living kin, their names inscribed in the celestial registers, stand among the ranks of immortals. May past transgressions dissolve of themselves, and misfortunes forever cease. Before calamity even stirs, let blessings descend anew. May all living beings, both moving and still, universally receive the shelter of the Dao’s shade. After attaining the Way, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with true reality.

To the Southwest, we, your servants, humbly observe: the two symbols divide their numinous power, weaving the hidden mechanisms of the Kun wilds; the doubled yin settles into its place, condensing utmost stillness at the earth’s axis. Facing the sun’s domain, it asserts its might; controlling the moon’s gate, it establishes its pole. All creatures draw sustenance from it to grow and flourish, while the myriad dharmas embody it to attain stillness and peace.

Now, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, for state and family, establishes this retreat and practices the Dao. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest, the Qi of Brahma Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southwestern Quarter.

We humbly observe: though the most sagely and exalted perfected ones elude pursuit, the treasury of blessings they bestow responds unfailingly to sincere prayer and devotion.

We humbly beseech the sacred chart of blessings to safeguard the great enterprise, that the Nine Enclosures be serene and still, the Six Harmonies flourish in peace.

Next, we pray for the retreat’s patron, so-and-so’s household: may the nine generations and seven lineages be freed from the earthly bureau’s ledgers of judgment; may the bound spirits and stagnant consciousnesses wander freely upon the cloud-sands’ path. May the living kin be inscribed in the immortal registry; may calamities and declines cease, and official emoluments and lifespan be prolonged. May all living beings share equally in blessings and protection. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the true.

In the Northwestern Quarter:
We humbly observe: the Jade Emperor, his crown pendants congealed in stillness, governs from the Heavenly Gate to spread transformation; the Golden Numinous One, dwelling in his celestial seat, encompasses the Qian and Lu hexagrams to lay the foundation. The host of stars hangs the pattern of the Pole Star’s reverence, while the myriad phenomena embody the movement of primal flourishing. Truly, they oversee transgressions and blessings, governing all living beings.

Now, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, burdened with profound gratitude for sovereign and kin, and deep sincerity for family and state, establishes this retreat to practice the Dao, repenting transgressions and praying for blessings. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest, the Qi of Brahma Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northwestern Quarter.

We humbly note: the Dao of Heaven shines brightly, circulating without cease. The numinous immortals, in hidden assistance, bestow their protection without omission.

May it specially beseech the sagely court above to consolidate the myriad achievements, perpetuate the imperial enterprise, and eternally bring about harmonious prosperity. May it further beseech that the household of Retreat Patron so-and-so—across nine generations and seven mysteries, with the six relations’ lingering attachments—find their spirits dwelling in Kunlun and Penglai, their steps soaring through mist and clouds. May their present clan and kin know no calamity or decline, their emoluments endure and lives lengthen, misfortune vanish and blessings arise. May all creatures possessing consciousness be preserved in primordial auspiciousness. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the true.

Above, we humbly note: the singular qi surges and merges, circulating through the Great Void to form images; the Two Modes shine resplendently, opening the vast expanse without bound. The five hundred million heavens are divided, the three thousand realms arrayed. Wind and thunder, cold and heat—how can one speak of their equal distribution across the four seasons? Solemnity and growth, killing and creation—all follow the Six Voids yet remain ungoverned. Now, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, bearing the vast encompassing compassion and moved by the virtue of nurturing completion, establishes this retreat to practice the Dao, repenting transgressions and praying for blessings. With reverence, he presents one bolt of azure-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Lords, the Perfected of Jade Capital and Mystic Capital’s Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, the divine immortals and jade maidens, and the spirit officials of the Upper Realm’s boundless worlds. We humbly observe: the mysterious transformation pervades all, illuminating even the unseen; the celestial perfected broadly succor, responding unfailingly to all who are moved.

May this specially beseech the augmentation of blessings for the imperial court, that the celestial mandate flourish abundantly. May the imperial Dao be proclaimed and disseminated, bringing peace and tranquility to all regions. Next, may the retreat’s sponsor, so-and-so, and his family—his nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of kin—have their souls elevated to the celestial palaces. May his living relatives ascend the ranks of the immortals. May their longevity and prosperity increase and flourish, while misfortunes and calamities cease and vanish. May those in the three paths and nine nights alike bathe in the mysterious perfection.

We, the humble servants below, have heard: the numinous spirits established their positions, and the vast earth shaped its forms. It spans the eight directions without bound, dividing the nine domains without limit. All regions rely upon it for sustenance, and the myriad beings depend on it for birth and transformation.

Now, the sponsor of this Grand Retreat of the Yellow Register, so-and-so, deeply devoted to sovereign and kin, and profoundly bound by duty to family and state, establishes this retreat to practice the Dao, repenting transgressions and praying for blessings. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, the August Sovereign of the Nine Lands, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, the Twelve Immortal Lords, the Perfected of the Nine Palaces, the divine immortals and jade maidens, and the spirit officials of the Lower Realm’s boundless worlds. We humbly observe: the supreme sages bestow their scriptures, universally bestowing fortune upon both the seen and unseen; the perfected expound their teachings, extending their grace to all under heaven.

May the Auspicious Emperor’s Palace descend with blessings, and the Heavenly Gates of Fortune extend their grace. May it align with the earth’s expanse to endure forever, and harmonize with the profound depths without depletion.

Next, we pray for the ancestral spirits of the retreat’s sponsor, [Name], that they transcend the nether realms and depart the shades of the underworld. May the living kin dwell securely in the land of blessings, their emoluments and longevity prolonged, calamities and misfortunes extinguished. May all sentient beings, even the lowliest creatures, bathe in the mysterious power. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

**Palace of the Sun**
We, your humble servants, have heard: the radiant sun unfurls its splendor, and the yang brilliance surges forth. At dawn, it ascends from the wastes of Yang Valley; at dusk, it withdraws to the shores of Yu Springs. Its nine rays scatter low, casting light along the Yellow Path; its five hues subtly divide, ascending the azure void to present auspicious omens. Having received the virtue of its oversight, we earnestly contemplate the rites of reverent repayment.

Now, the sponsor of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, [Name], acting for state and family, presents ritual offerings with devotion. Establishing the retreat to practice the Dao, he repents transgressions and prays for blessings. With utmost sincerity, we turn toward and revere the August Perfected and Great Sage of the Sun Palace, the August Sovereign of the Solar Orb, the Illuminated August Perfected, the Cinnabar Cloud Jade Maidens, the Vermilion Radiance Cavern’s Luminous Child of Great Light, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Sun Palace.

We especially pray for the sovereign’s sacred person to receive illumination, that the precious mandate may shine forth. Above, may it equal the dual luminaries; below, may it illuminate the ten thousand directions. Next, we pray for the household of the retreat’s sponsor, [Name], that the living and deceased alike receive grace, and disasters and misfortunes be stilled. May they forever revere the impartial radiance and eternally follow the winds of the Dao-endowed. May their bodies attain luminosity, sharing the same brilliance as the Great Sun. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

**Palace of the Moon**
We, your humble servants, have heard: the supreme yin suspends its image, and the Jade Hare congeals its splendor. Following the nine paths, its radiance flows; waxing and waning adhere to measure. Dividing into ten branches, its light scatters impartially. Having received the grace of its oversight, we earnestly contemplate the rites of reverent repayment.

Now, the sponsor of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, [Name], acting for state and family, presents ritual offerings with devotion. Establishing the retreat to practice the Dao, he repents transgressions and prays for blessings. With utmost sincerity, we turn toward and revere the August Perfected and Great Sage of the Moon Palace, the August Sovereign of the Lunar Orb, the Unadorned August Perfected, the Scattered Radiance Jade Maidens, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Moon Palace.

We especially pray for the ancestral line to receive fortune, that the blessings of the mandate may endure. May heaven and earth stand equally firm, and sun and moon shine with equal brightness. For the household of the retreat’s sponsor, [Name], may emoluments and longevity be renewed, and the living and deceased alike know peace. May disasters and declines not arise, and transgressions and faults dissolve of themselves. May their bodies attain luminosity, sharing the same brilliance as the Great Yin. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

**Palace of the Stars**

We, your humble servants, have heard that the Two Radiant Ones divide their brilliance, while the host of stars array their luminosity. The Three Terraces and Five Wefts trail their light across the azure vault; the Seven Regulators and Three Palaces spread their forms through the Great Purity. They govern the seas and mountains, command all living beings, and by their gracious illumination, we are moved to offer rites of bright requital.

Now we reverently present the sponsor of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, [Name], who bears the ritual offerings for state and family, seeking to atone for transgressions and pray for blessings. With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the starry deities of the heavens: the Jade Celestial Pivot and the Northern Apex, the Five Planets and the Northern Dipper, the Nine Stars and Three Terraces, the Twenty-Eight Lunar Lodges, and all the great spirits, perfected ones, and divine immortals residing within the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial sphere. We especially beseech their hidden support for the great enterprise and their subtle aid to the sagely court. May the Pole Star stand in equal majesty, and auspicious stars manifest their portents. For the household of the retreat’s sponsor, [Name], may the Nine Ancestral Generations be delivered, and the entire clan know peace. May emoluments and longevity be prolonged, and misfortunes and calamities cease. May they enjoy propitious blessings and know no ill omens under heaven’s gaze. May their bodies attain luminosity, sharing the same brilliance as the Star Palace. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

**Eastern Marchmount**
We, your humble servants, have heard that the Five Peaks hold their fixed positions, with Mount Tai foremost in honor. Its verdant hues congeal into mist, its cloud pavilions soar beyond the heavens; its layered peaks rise in succession, its Sun-Contemplating Terrace overlooks the sea’s edge.

**Southern Marchmount**

We, your humble servants, have heard that the Fire Phase establishes the supreme pole, and the Crimson Thearch divides his capital.

As it governs the realm of perfected sages, it also oversees the registers of life and death. With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the Crimson Thearch Perfected Sovereign of the Southern Marchmount Hengshan, the Flying Immortals, the Perfected Ones of the renowned grotto-heavens, and all the divine immortals and spirit officials of the sacred peaks.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the White Thearch Perfected Sovereign of the Western Marchmount Huashan, the Flying Immortals, the Perfected Ones of the renowned grotto-heavens, and all the divine immortals and spirit officials of the sacred peaks.

We, your humble servants, have heard that the august marchmount spans the sky, blocking the northern wilds to eclipse the sun; the clustered peaks accumulate their beauty, supporting heaven from the northern continent. It devours the lands of the northern deserts and towers over the plains of You and Yan. It contains thunder and rain, and governs the registers of life and death.

Here is the translation:

We, your humble servants, have heard that as the revered of the four wilds and the chief of all mountains, the lofty Songshan stands supreme among the marchmounts, its towering heights reaching heaven. With thirty-six peaks rising and falling, its verdant hues span Gong and Luo; stretching for myriad miles, its azure expanse upholds the vault of heaven. It governs the lives of beings and oversees the judgment of sins and blessings.

**Water Palace**
We, your humble servants, have heard that the highest virtue lies in merit, governing the Kan Palace to accumulate power; the most yielding nature flows through the Xun Sea to still its waves. It draws its numen from the primordial chaos and extends its sageliness beyond heaven and earth. Floating the sky and bathing the sun, its boundless source defies measure; spanning the earth and steaming clouds, its vast expanse eludes comprehension. Below, it opens the dragon gods’ palace and divides the bureaus of sin and blessing. Its governance is impartial, sustaining both the hidden and the manifest.

After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.

**Sacred Scriptures**
We, your humble servants, have heard that the Great Dao divides its light, first expounding the wordless teaching; the Heavenly Worthy spreads transformation, gradually bestowing the written works. Thus, qi coalesces into chapters, and clouds congeal into seals. Each character spans a zhang, radiating eight-cornered numinous rays; their traces scatter across the heavens, harmonizing with the five assemblies’ tones. The twelve hundred precepts, twelve thousand rules of deportment, thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures, and three thousand six hundred canons and statutes—cultivating them leads to immortality and transcendence as a divine immortal; upholding them aids the state, guides the sovereign, pacifies the people, and benefits all beings. They encompass all methods and universally deliver sentient beings.

Now, the sponsor of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, [Name], acting for family and state, repents transgressions and seeks grace. With utmost sincerity, they take refuge in the Most True and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures, the natural scriptural precepts, the orthodox Dharma of the ten directions, the secret treasuries of all heavens, the true writs and precious talismans, the scripture-attending divine lords, ministers, and officials, and all the divine bureaus of ritual and dharma protection. We humbly pray that blessings descend from the nine heavens, bestowing prosperity upon all nations. May the sacred body be harmonious and flourishing, and the precious mandate enduring. For the sponsor’s family, may the nine generations of ancestral spirits be inscribed on the cinnabar tablets; may their six relations and kin be ranked in the purple registers.

The sponsor, [Name], seeks to requite the mysterious workings of creation and offers up sincere devotion. We arrange the altar and follow the prescribed rites.

After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with reality.

**Northeast Quarter**
We your servants have heard that the workings of creation follow cycles, beginning and ending in the *Gen* domain. All species take form therein, blending with the numinous. Movement and stillness follow the seasons; transformation responds to resonance. The sponsor, reflecting on the illumination and nurturance of the Dao, seeks to atone for transgressions.

**Southwest Quarter**
We your servants have heard that the Yellow Center initiates destiny, and its vast profundity divides into forms...

All living things, both moving and still, draw sustenance for their existence, and thus the myriad kinds are distinguished. The long rivers stretch boundlessly, their distant shores beyond the reach of the four extremities; the vast wilds stretch endlessly, their farthest bounds beyond the eight wastes. Now the great *Huanglu* precept-holder, so-and-so, desiring to repay the grace of nurturance and to atone for transgressions, has prepared offerings for the perfumed rites, following the prescribed forms. Humbly presenting a bolt of yellow-patterned silk and a golden dragon, we pay homage to the Vast Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest, the Celestial Lords of *Fan-qi*, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southwest Quarter.

After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with reality.

**Northwest Quarter**
We your servants have heard that the august symbol of *Qian* is exalted, giving rise to the transformations of all things. It preserves the essence of firm strength and accords with the square of Great Harmony. Its four virtues circulate universally, rectifying the nature and destiny of humans and spirits; its six dragons soar and rest, enabling the transformations of yin and yang. Now the great *Huanglu* precept-holder, so-and-so, bearing the grace of nurturance and moved by the gift of shaping and molding, reflects upon past lives and the present existence, where transgressions have accumulated in cycles. Resolving to undertake the burning of incense and the cultivation of rites, he hopes to receive purification. Humbly presenting a bolt of yellow-patterned silk and a golden dragon, we pay homage to the Vast Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest, the Celestial Lords of *Fan-qi*, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northwest Quarter.

May his kin and relations all receive purity and auspiciousness. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

**Upper Realm**
We, your humble servants, have heard that the Great Void is boundless and vast, the celestial patterns lofty and sublime. Below lie the Twenty-Eight Heavens, above encompass the Thirty-Five Divisions. The stars revolve in illumination, the sun and moon stream forth their radiance. They are stirred by thunder and nourished by clouds and rain. Crowned by the Great Veil, they broadly overspread, reaching the empty vastness in their high oversight.

After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

**Lower Realm**
We, your humble servants, have heard that the depths congeal into form, descending into the utmost yin. The Four Seas cannot compare to their depth, nor can the Nine Marshes rival their profundity.

We pray that the ninefold spirits of the precept-holder’s household may ascend to the Vermilion Palace, that his worldly kin may have their names inscribed in the Crimson Register. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

**Palace of the Sun**

We humbly recall that the Great Sun repays virtue, shining with impartial radiance. It enters Yu Valley to conceal its brilliance and emerges from Xian Pool to cast forth its splendor. Soaring beyond the Eight Voids, it blazes resplendent within the Six Directions. Now veiled in the somber hues of autumn, now lingering in the tender shades of spring. The precept-holder, bearing the Sun’s impartial illumination, seeks to honor its grace with utmost sincerity.

With wholehearted devotion, we reverently invoke the August Sovereign of the Sun Palace, the Illustrious Perfected of Radiance, the Cinnabar Cloud Jade Maidens, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Sun Palace. We reflect that the true numina are lofty and pure, while the human path is humble and lowly.

We beseech your pardon and forgiveness, that we may renew ourselves from this day forth. May our bodies attain luminosity, sharing the same radiance as the Great Sun. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

**Palace of the Moon**
We humbly recall that the Great Yin manifests its image, waxing and waning in constancy. Revolving through the Great Void, it illumines the cosmos. Its encircling glow now divides on the nights of the sixteenth and seventeenth, its jade-like radiance nearing fullness at the fifteenth hour. By this alternation of darkness and light, the rhythms of the seasons are fixed.

Now the precept-holder of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, bearing the Moon’s impartial gaze, seeks to honor its grace with utmost sincerity.

After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

**Palace of the Stars**

We humbly acknowledge that yin and yang divide their illumination, and the stellar paths follow in sequence. The twelve celestial palaces take their measure from the Central Dipper; the twenty-eight lunar lodges fix their pivot upon the Northern Axiom. Thus the Jade Hare ascends in radiance, the Golden Steed withdraws its brilliance. Together they blaze beneath the vaulted canopy, each shimmering within the celestial net. Through them, the animate and inanimate are distinguished, and all living beings receive their allotment.

With reverence, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, having received the grace of their illumination, now offer our utmost sincerity in repayment. In all our movements and dwellings, how could we be free from the dust of transgression? With wholehearted devotion, we invoke the starry hosts of the heavens, the Jade Armillary of the Northern Axiom, the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Degree Star Lords of the celestial circuit, and the perfected immortals and spirit officials dwelling among the stars.

We humbly acknowledge that autumn in the west embodies the flourishing power of metal, and Mount Hua’s towering heights rise to boundless grandeur. Its cliffs, carved as if by blade, soar ten thousand ren. Clusters of lotus blossoms cling to the void at the summit of emerald mists; the immortal’s palm cradles the sun amid the white clouds. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, now invoke the August Sovereign of Mount Hua, the White Emperor of the Western Marchmount, and the divine immortals and spirit officials.

We humbly acknowledge that the north embodies the flourishing power of water, and Mount Heng stands as guardian of that quarter. It overlooks the precarious realm of Xu and Wei, spanning the vast wilds of You and Ji. A thousand cliffs vie in their soaring heights, exhaling clouds and rain into the misty void; ten thousand ravines race in their descent, harboring ethereal mists in lush verdancy. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, now invoke the August Sovereign of Mount Heng, the Black Emperor of the Northern Marchmount, and the divine immortals and spirit officials. Mindful of the dust and defilement that may offend the true numina, we humbly seek to confess our faults from the outset, praying for your blessing and protection.

Harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.

**Central Marchmount**
We humbly acknowledge that among the Five Phases, the power of earth holds preeminence. Above, it aligns with the celestial pole; below, it guards the mighty capital. In its orientation, cloud-wreathed ravines unfold in a thousand layers; in its sheer ascent, mist-veiled peaks rise ten thousand zhang. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, now invoke the August Sovereign of Mount Song, the Yellow Emperor of the Central Marchmount, and the divine immortals and spirit officials.

**Water Palace**
We humbly acknowledge that the great rivers surge and swell, the celestial Han flows in flight. Their unfathomable waves race onward, their boundless vastness knows no shore. Leviathans and whales find their swimming grounds, tortoises and dragons their hidden lairs. They stir the tides to follow yin’s ebb and harm, they raise mists and clouds to aid heaven and earth. Their power to moisten below is most expansive, their virtue of supreme goodness is where all归. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, now invoke the August Sovereign of the Water Palace, the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Water Emperors of the Three Rivers and Four Plums, the Nine Jiang, the Twelve River Sources, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Water Palace.

**Sacred Scriptures**
We humbly acknowledge that the Dao’s workings are proclaimed and propagated, the Great Sage leaves traces behind. Golden writings and jade characters, phoenix scripts and dragon seals. Sacred registers and numinous diagrams, divine formulas and secret incantations. Cultivate them, and one easily transforms the mortal heart to ascend the sagely Dao; practice them, and one discards worldly filth to tread the cloud thoroughfares. The precepts and laws are strict and clear, not bestowed upon the unworthy. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Fast, now invoke the Most High and Venerable, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures, the True Writings and Sacred Talismans, the Secret Treasures of the Myriad Heavens, the Orthodox Dharma of the Ten Directions, the Guardian Deities of the Scriptures, and all numinous officials.

May the myriad sages bestow auspicious omens, and the thousand perfected confer blessings. The living and the dead alike shall prosper, their emoluments and longevity extended. Through nine nights and three paths, all shall partake of the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.

We humbly recall that the celestial bodies hang in brilliance, illuminating the earth below. The Three Luminaries bestow their radiance, and all beings take form. The Solar Emperor and Lunar Sovereign oversee the registers of life and death, while the Stellar Palaces and Dipper Pivot jointly govern the records of sin and fortune.
Now, we, the sponsors of this grand Yellow Register Fast, certain officials and persons, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the Perfected Great Sages of the Sun, Moon, and Stellar Palaces, and the Divine Officials of the Three Luminaries’ Immortal Hosts.
We specially beseech the bestowal of their great abundance and the diffusion of their impartial virtue. May the imperial enterprise flourish and blessings descend upon the sagely court. May longevity be extended without bound, and universal peace achieved across the ten thousand realms.
Next, we pray for the nine generations of the sponsor’s family to be delivered, and a hundred blessings to converge. May their emoluments and years be renewed, and disasters and misfortunes forever cease. Through the three paths and nine nights, may their consciousness connect with the radiance of conjoined pearls and jade disks. May all moving and quiescent beings, all containing spirit, receive the gift of illumination and life.
After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.

**The Five Peaks**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the True Lords of the Five Peaks, and the Divine Officials of the Grotto-Heavens and Sacred Mountains Who Have Attained the Dao.
*Three prostrations, each with reverent repentance and gratitude.*

We humbly recall that when the Two Modes parted, the Five Peaks divided their majesty. Below, they stabilize the earth; above, they support the celestial canopy. The sacred mountains and numinous grottoes govern spirits and gods. The underworld bureaus and immortal courts administer sin and fortune.
Now, we, the sponsors of this grand Yellow Register Fast, certain officials and persons, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the True Lords of the Five Peaks, and the Divine Officials of the Grotto-Heavens and Sacred Mountains Who Have Attained the Dao.
We specially beseech their illumination of our sincere devotion and the descent of vast blessings. First, may the imperial destiny be strengthened and the imperial plan secretly protected. May the phoenix’s reign endure for myriad millennia, and the crane’s years equal those of Mount Song and Mount Hua.
Next, may the nine generations and seven ancestors of the sponsor’s family, whose consciousness lingers in dark prisons, have their records expunged from Mount Tai’s ledgers and find the path to freedom in the immortal grottoes. May the living kin—both inner and outer relations—have their emoluments and longevity increased, and misfortunes and disasters eradicated. May their sinful records be stricken from the Five Peaks, and their names inscribed in the immortal registers of the Nine Heavens. May all moving and quiescent beings together attain liberation.
After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.

**The Water Realms**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang, and the Divine Officials of the Twelve River Sources’ Water Realms.
*Three prostrations, each with reverent repentance and gratitude.*

We humbly recall that the Eight Seas support the heavens, floating the Ten Continents beyond the world, while the Nine Jiang harness the sun, dividing the Six Directions within the earthly realm. The cosmos relies on their power of conveyance, and all beings depend on their nurturing virtue. They conceal grotto-heavens within, governing all living beings. Having charge over the sources of sin and fortune, they should be entreated with utmost devotion.
Now, we, the sponsors of this grand Yellow Register Fast, certain officials and persons, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang, and the Divine Officials of the Twelve River Sources’ Water Realms.
We specially beseech the unfolding of their supreme benevolence and the diffusion of their numinous and enduring grace. May auspicious omens be received at the imperial palace, and the River Chart be restored. May the imperial person’s longevity be increased, and the seas and mountains be pacified. May terrifying waves subside, and all classes of beings enjoy peace.
Next, we pray for the nine ancestors and seven generations of the sponsor’s family to be reborn in heaven and attain the Dao. May they depart the dark courts of the Yellow Springs and ascend to the square isles and round peaks of the immortal realms. May the living kin together partake of splendid blessings. May fortune and prosperity descend, and disasters and transgressions be cleansed. May all virtues daily renew, and all beings together prosper.
After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.

**The Sacred Scriptures**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Three Supreme Worthies of the Most High, the Hosts of Sages of the Ten Directions, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures, and the True Writings and Sacred Talismans.
*Three prostrations, each with reverent repentance and gratitude.*

We humbly acknowledge that before heaven and earth arose, at the very beginning of primordial chaos, the Jade Capital and Golden Towers had already spread the great wind of the Dao; the dragon-script and phoenix-characters had long expounded the profound teachings of the Twofold Mystery. First transmitted in the heavens, they gradually descended to the human realm. There are charts for attaining long life and immortality, and instructions for benefiting beings and pacifying the people. Emperors and kings have revered them to propagate transformation; perfected scholars have cultivated them to ascend to heaven. They are the root-source of the ten thousand methods and the fundamental origin of the nine schools. It is fitting to receive and uphold them, that auspicious blessings may descend.

Now, with utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Great Register Retreat, the officials of such-and-such rank, take refuge in the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures and the True Writings and Sacred Talismans. We specially beseech the opening of great mercy and the bestowal of boundless fortune. May the sacred destiny be eternally upheld, and the grand design subtly assisted. May the ninefold palace enjoy the peace of seas and mountains, and the myriad states be harmonized under the transforming power of unified culture.

We further beseech that the three masters and nine generations of ancestors of the sponsor’s family be inscribed with virtuous names on the cinnabar registers, and that the living kin be cleansed of their transgressions recorded in the black books. May secret instructions be secretly transmitted, and the immortal ranks be silently attained. May emolument and longevity be renewed, and misfortunes and calamities forever cease. May all beings, whether soaring or sinking, plant or animal, together bathe in the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.

**Rite for Pacifying the Dwelling and Circulating the Dao**

The assembled officials first take their positions before the Mysterious Master and stand in formation. They chant the *Dao*, enter the chamber, and circumambulate, beginning with the offering of incense to the Five Directions in the east. They then present incense at the imperial altar and at their respective stations, each bowing to the Master while visualizing as prescribed.

*Guardian Spirits*, radiant and luminous at dawn,
Purple mists ascend through empty space.
Stellar altars gleam resplendent,
Transforming into cloud-palaces.
The solar essence and lunar spirit,
Winged between *Li* and *Kan*.
Golden Perfected issue their commands,
Dragons and tigers dispel Fengdu’s shades.
On this auspicious day, the rite proceeds,
Eight Mighty Ones drum in attendance.
Jade blossoms unfold, rainbow banners swirl,
Heavenly light descends, the Dao’s *qi* flourishes.
All beings receive universal deliverance,
Joy flows without end.

**Twenty-four strikes of the ritual drum.**

O Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three *Qi* of the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao: Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Officials of Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youth, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maiden, and the Thirty-Two Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs and the Direct Day. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to open the gates of the Mysterious Altar and invoke the Celestial Lords and Divine Sovereigns. May the deities of this land and its boundaries, the true officials and upright spirits, attend in mind.

We pray that the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-*qi* and Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies, that our petitions swiftly ascend to the presence of the Supreme, Boundless, and Great Dao—before the Jade Threshold of the Formless and Spontaneous Golden Gate.

**Each declares their ritual rank:**

We, your humble servants, in unison and sincerity, reverently address the Formless and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, the Great Sage Assemblies and Perfected Lords of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Great Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Seven Jeweled Mysterious Terrace of the Jade Capital and Golden Gates in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the officials of the Three Realms, the Perfected Immortals of the Grotto-Heavens, the Five Primordial Thearchs, the Numinous Treasure’s Mighty Spirits, and all true numina above and below.

We have heard that the Great Dao fuses with the true, and the Primordial August One governs the course of destiny. The Five Scriptures unfold the teachings, and the Three Caverns proclaim their practice. The Heavenly Worthy bestows the ordinances of boundless deliverance; the Supreme One spreads limitless grace. All beings are shaped and refined, all lives rescued and uplifted. We, having accumulated good causes over countless kalpas, have been bathed in the mysterious transformation. Dragon scripts and phoenix records, jade tablets and jasper scrolls—we have been privileged to receive and cultivate them, seeking ascent and deliverance. Yet at the outset of our vows, we pledge salvation as our foremost duty. No petition may be withheld or denied. How much more so when commanded by sacred decree—dare we not make this known above?

**The petition is read.**

As the words express, our sincerity is earnest and our devotion profound. It is fitting that deliverance be granted, that the mysterious compassion be fulfilled.

We reflect that before the Five Ultimates, the Three Spirits divided their transformations. In the lower antiquity, customs remained uncorrupted. Dwellings were carved into cliffs and nests built in trees; all embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue. Each found contentment in their place, harmonizing in effortless non-action. But when the myriad signs of yin and yang appeared, and the symbols of beams and rafters arose, fortune and misfortune, good and evil, intertwined in mutual succession. Those who followed the natural order enjoyed generations of blessings; those who defied it suffered calamities and afflictions. The sages, moved by compassion, made salvation their heart’s work. Through repentance of sins and prayer for grace, they exalted the rectitude of the retreat. We now humbly join together, adhering to the canonical rites. We establish the altar and seek blessings and protection.

Today, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the august spirits of the altars of state and the ancestral shrines. May the Celestial Capital gleam with radiant purity, and the Purple Culmen extend its blessings. May fortune grace the imperial residence, and felicity transmit the imperial enterprise. May it stand as firm as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and shine as brightly as the sun and moon. May the Crown Prince and the various princes inherit and uphold the sagely enterprise. May worthy ministers and good counselors ably assist in planning and strategy. May the myriad states come as if by bridge and boat, and all beings enjoy peace and prosperity.

For this purpose, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assemblies, the virtues of the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

Today, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the nine ancestors and seven generations of the sponsor’s family, and to the departed spirits in the hidden realms. May they dwell in the Crimson Garden and refine their souls on the Cinnabar Terrace. May they don the *qi* of immortality and ascend to the cloudy peaks, entrusting themselves to transformation. May fortune bless their descendants, and grace extend to both the living and the dead. May they ever bear the mysterious felicity and constantly receive primal auspiciousness.

For this purpose, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assemblies, the virtues of the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

Today, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.

We dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the sponsor’s household, their kin and relatives, bringing them shared blessings. May their fortune extend and their lives endure; may misfortunes vanish and calamities dissolve. May the dragon spirits of the dwelling, the yin and yang officers, and the terrestrial officials receive promotions in rank and rewards for merit, their titles and honors augmented. May they bring auspicious protection to the central palace and dispel disasters and misfortunes from the outer realms.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of Masters, whose supreme virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into formlessness. Harmony unites with the true Dao.

*Step into emptiness, circumambulate afar, and perform the Three Reverences.*

We, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
We, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures.
We, your servants, bow in utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center.

*Reiterating the dharma ranks:*

We, your servants, so-and-so and others, humbly reaffirm our entreaty to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy; the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the great sagely hosts who have attained the Dao in the ten directions; the Heavenly Thearchs and Celestial Emperors; the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center; the Supreme August of the Earthly Mansion; the Five Emperors of the Underworld; the Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens; the Orthodox Unity Perfected; the officials of the Three and Five, and all responsive numinous spirits.

We have heard that the mysterious transformation is proclaimed and the Dao’s influence spreads, bestowing grace upon the Three Realms and extending kindness to all beings. The covenantal might suspends the statutes that aid the state, and the Numinous Treasure sets forth the forms of repentance and entreaty. Whatever is sought is surely attained through resonance.

Your disciple, so-and-so, dwells amidst the dust of the world and has not yet fathomed the subtle and wondrous. Yet in choosing this site for construction, the dwelling may not be auspicious. We fear we have offended the true spirits and violated prohibitions, contravening the signs of the Eight Dwellings and Five Phases, and failing in the directions of yin, yang, punishment, and virtue. Overcome with anxiety and doubt, we now present our repentance and thanksgiving.

Thus, we solemnly prepare the altar and meticulously follow the canonical rites. With reverence, we offer incense and flowers, devoutly performing the fast. We turn our hearts to the Ten Poles, repenting our sins before all heavens. In accordance with the Orthodox Unity scriptures and the Heavenly Master’s prescribed forms, we invoke the officials of the Three and Five, the celestial lords and their officers, to dispel inauspicious influences and dissolve disasters and calamities.

We humbly request on behalf of so-and-so the presence of the Supreme High Granary Lord, the Director of the Central Qi, the Lord of the White Chariot and White Horse, the Lord of Summoning and Investigation, the Lord of Qi Circulation and Disaster Resolution who guards the dwelling, the Celestial Lord of Faults and Transgressions, the Vast Controller, the Northern City Lord of Harmonious Fate and Transformative Counsel, the Celestial Heart Censor and Attendant who pacifies the heavens, the Supreme Great Harmony Lord, the Lord of Spirit Gathering and Supreme Clarity, the Upper Prime Earth Lord, the Heaven-Covering Great General and Supreme Heavenly Lord, the Red Heaven Granary Qi Lord, the Four Hu Lords, the Earth-Restraining Lord, the Heavenly Prosperity Lord, and the Five Guardians and Great Generals.

May they, on behalf of so-and-so’s household, dissolve the influences of the Three Mounds and Five Graves, the myriad spirits of the underworld, the earthly qi consumed by lunar eclipses, the hundred diseases and malevolent transgressions, the depredations of thieves and harmful losses, the qi of punishment and inauspicious calamities, the five epidemics and hundred illnesses, the spirits of curses and malevolent prayers, the destructive emanations from the four directions, the military incursions of the Five Divisions, the curses of household shrines, the various trials and all demonic entities, as well as the qi of the Five Phases’ retribution and the lingering, hidden spirits.

May the accumulated misfortunes of past generations and the disasters of the current year, the twelve punishments and harms, and all boundaries within and without be entirely dissolved. May all inauspicious spirits be dispelled.

Should there be any quarrying of timber or moving of stones, any groundbreaking or construction that offends the true spirits of heaven and earth, disrupts the true qi of yin and yang, encroaches upon the Earthly Mansion, or violates the numinous spirits—though the realms of the unseen and visible differ, and mortal understanding is limited—we now repent and offer thanks, beseeching that all be dissolved.

May the true qi be proclaimed and spread, the dragon spirits stand guard. May disasters and calamities be eradicated, and blessings and goodness come forth. May the dwelling be secure and tranquil, all movements harmonious and peaceful. May kin and clan alike be bathed in upright benefit. May the seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, the three paths be purified and serene. May the Nine Darks cease their accusations, and the long night be illuminated. May grievances and debts be resolved, schemes and plots stilled. May the lingering dead and stagnant qi, the bound souls and hidden spirits, all receive blessings and each be delivered. May they abandon evil and return to the correct, attune to the Dao and commune with the true.

May the imperial reign be long and distant, the vitality of the people bright and flourishing. May all under heaven be wholly saved, and every moving thing partake in glory. Above, may the vast grace of the Illuminated Heavenly Worthy be manifest; below, may our repentant sincerity be answered.

*Making vows:*

First, may heaven and earth be bright and pure;
Second, may the atmosphere be clear and mysterious;
Third, may the sage live ten thousand years;
Fourth, may transformation reach the eight limits;
Fifth, may heaven bestow sweet dew;
Sixth, may earth emit auspicious mist;
Seventh, may the four seasons follow their courses;
Eighth, may all things grow whole;
Ninth, may households abound in filial piety and fraternal duty;
Tenth, may the state teem with talent and worthies;
Eleventh, may the merit of the fast spread widely;
Twelfth, may good omens daily increase.

*Replenishing the incense burner:*

Incense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits—may the place where we offer incense naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected gather here before the incense burner. May we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality become immortals. May the fast’s sponsor receive blessings, and both the seen and unseen partake in grace.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly conveying our entreaty to the Golden Portal of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.

We humbly consider that in the construction and renovation of our dwellings, we may have offended the divine spirits, harmed the earth’s veins, and disturbed the springs and sources.

We have transgressed the prohibitions, disturbing the Dragon Spirits. Or by the clash of the Five Phases, the Four Destructive Forces have encroached. Strange dreams arise in confusion, and our dwelling knows no peace. Today, therefore, we burn incense and perform the Dao rites, offering repentance and seeking grace. We humbly pray that our transgressions be swept away, grievances be reconciled, the living and the dead be blessed with prosperity, and our kin be granted safety. May the Dragon Spirits return to their rightful places, and our lifespan and fortune be extended. May the Three Paths receive blessings, and all beings—moving and still—share in glory.

Faults have accumulated within the Water Realms, entangling us across generations, yet remaining unresolved. Today, therefore, we burn incense and perform the Dao rites, seeking forgiveness and grace. We humbly pray that the august spirits look upon us with mercy, washing away our transgressions. May all offenses be dissolved, the living and the dead prosper, our kin be at peace, misfortune be transcended, and our lifespan and fortune be extended.

Such transgressions have accumulated faults within the Treasury of the Three Treasures, yet remain unforgiven. Today, therefore, we burn incense and perform the Dao rites, seeking forgiveness and grace. We humbly pray that the myriad sages illuminate our path, and the august ones grant us pardon. May all offenses be dissolved, blessings and goodness come forth, and our lifespan and fortune be enriched. May the living and the dead prosper, our kin be at peace, all beings receive grace, the Dragon Spirits return to their posts, the Six Paths be aided, and the Three Paths be reached.

*Concluding the Forty-Fifth Scroll of the* **Yellow Register Fast Rites of the Most High**
*Beginning the Forty-Sixth Scroll of the* **Yellow Register Fast Rites of the Most High**

**Compiled by Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty**
**Fivefold Repentance Rite for Grace and Auspicious Signs**

When ascending the altar during extreme cold, intense heat, or inclement weather—lest one’s demeanor be deemed improper—this repentance rite may be employed for simplicity.

**First: General Repentance to the Ten Directions**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the **Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy** of the Ten Boundless Directions, the **Perfected Saints Who Have Attained the Dao**, the **Supreme Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones**, and the **Divine Officials of the Ten Realms’ Immortal Hosts**.

**Three Bows**—each performed with reverent repentance.

**Repentance**
We humbly acknowledge that the **Dao/Way** transforms without limit, manifesting responses in accord with the moment; that sincerity evokes resonance, and the numinous Perfected bestow the merit of answering prayers. Profound indeed is the **Mystery upon Mystery**, subtly returning radiant blessings. We now offer solemn thanks to reciprocate this grace.

The Emperor, extending the **Great Dao** in compassion and receiving the protection of the **True Immortals**, devoutly presents purity and reverence to repay the **Mysterious Favor**. For three days and nights, we reverently conduct this **Supreme Yellow Register Daoist Altar**, offering incense, flowers, ritual gifts, oil lamps, and patterned silks. We take refuge in the **Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Ultimate**, the **Heavenly Lords of the Ten Poles**, and the **Divine Officials of the Ten Realms’ Immortal Hosts**.

May the **Myriad Saints** incline their radiance, and the **Three Venerables** descend their gaze. May auspicious blessings grace the ancestral temples, and longevity extend to the imperial domain. May the land expand beyond Yu’s borders, and the dynasty’s fortune surpass the Zhou’s divination. May the Emperor’s **Dao/Way** outshine the light of **Xuan Yuan** and **Fu Xi**, his virtue surpassing theirs. May he share equal honor with the sun and moon, and equal longevity with **Mount Penglai**. May the Empress, consorts, and concubines illuminate the imperial residence; may the Crown Prince and princes secure the great enterprise. May Hua and Yi alike flourish, and the myriad peoples rejoice in well-being. May celestial patterns remain constant, winds and rains harmonious. May weapons fall silent, and harvests abound. Extending to the denizens of water and land, the **Three Paths and Six Realms**, may all attain the realm of longevity and together delight in harmony. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

**The Three Luminaries**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the **Perfected Great Saints of the Sun, Moon, and Star Palaces**, and the **Divine Officials of the Three Luminaries’ Immortal Hosts**.

**Three Bows**—each performed with reverent repentance.

We humbly acknowledge that the **Two Images** divided their splendor, and the **Three Luminaries** cast their radiance. The sun’s palace and moon’s domain govern day and night with constancy; the **Five Planets and Six Mansions** oversee illumination without fail. They manifest karmic consequences, governing humans and heavens. The Emperor, bestowing the **Great Dao’s** grace and invoking divine response through numinous merit, seeks to exalt the blessings of purity in repayment to the **True Spirits**. With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **Perfected Great Saints of the Sun, Moon, and Star Palaces**, and the **Divine Officials of the Three Luminaries’ Immortal Hosts**.

May boundless pardon and impartial favor be proclaimed. May auspicious omens fill the imperial palace, and the dynasty’s fortune endure. May it surpass the **Ji** and **Zhou**, and extend the glory of the **Han**. May the Emperor’s civilizing influence equal the **Ascendant Peace**, and his grand design rival **Yao** and **Yu**. May his lifespan match the **Five Peaks**, his virtue equal the **Three Antiquities**. May the six palaces and hundred ministers perpetually enhance his governance; may the eight frontiers and nine domains all enjoy stability and prosperity. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

**The Five Peaks**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the **True Lords of the Five Peaks**, the **Perfected Immortals of the Famous Mountains and Grotto-Heavens**, and their **Divine Officials**.

**Three Bows**—each performed with reverent repentance.

We humbly acknowledge that the **Nine Lands** are thus divided, and the **Five Peaks** stand as guardians. They uphold the **Pivot of Heaven** above, arrayed among the stars; they press upon the **Axis of Earth** below, encircling rivers and streams. They govern good and evil, overseeing life and death. The Emperor, bestowing the **Great Dao’s** grace and invoking divine response through numinous merit, seeks to magnify the blessings of purity in repayment to the **True Spirits**. With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **True Lords of the Five Peaks**, the **Perfected Immortals of the Famous Mountains and Grotto-Heavens**, and their **Divine Officials**.

May their **Mysterious Gaze** extend afar, and their **Vast Grace** be universally bestowed. May the ancestral temples and former sages receive radiant blessings to ascend as Perfected; may the altars of soil and grain and their revered spirits enjoy enduring auspicious fortune. May the Emperor’s wisdom equal the **Two Luminaries**, his lifespan match the **Lofty Peaks**. May he surpass the **Mysterious Antiquity** in non-action, governing all directions with transformation. May the Empress, consorts, Crown Prince, and princes inscribe their names in the **Cinnabar Registers of Immortals**, enjoying the longevity of the **Pure Capital**. May all under heaven with awareness, and all within the realm with life, universally attain the fruits of blessing, both hidden and manifest. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

**The Water Realms**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the **Great Emperor of Fusang**, the **Divine King of Yang Valley**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang**, the **Divine Officials of the Twelve River Sources’ Water Realms**, and their **Immortal Hosts**.

**Three Bows**—each performed with reverent repentance.

We humbly acknowledge that the **Three Powers** are thus established, and the **Xun** winds flow into the boundless sea; that the **Seven Virtues** are manifest, and the **Kan** palace is vast. They embrace the myriad streams, cradling the **Nine Heavens**. They govern living beings and oversee karmic consequences. The Emperor, concentrating his spirit upon the **Three Realms** and directing his thoughts to the **Nine Purities**, invokes the **Great Dao’s** grace and divine response through numinous merit. Seeking to magnify the blessings of purity, he repays the **True Spirits**. With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **Great Emperor of Fusang**, the **Divine King of Yang Valley**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang**, the **Divine Officials of the Twelve River Sources’ Water Realms**, and their **Immortal Hosts**.

May extraordinary auspices be widely bestowed, and vast currents bring radiant protection. May the ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, together with the **Eight Seas**, remain eternally at peace; may the sacred longevity of the imperial domain stand as firm as the **Ten Mountains**. May the six palaces’ consorts and concubines, and the hundred officials, flourish in loyalty and integrity, perpetually receiving blessed fortune. May the Eastern Palace and princely residences, the inner screens and outer defenses, all propagate the **Wind of Dao and Virtue**, eternally enjoying the transformation of **Ascendant Peace**. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

**The Sacred Scriptures**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the **Thirty-Six Divisions of the Supreme Scriptures**, the **True Writs and Sacred Talismans**.

**Three Bows**—each performed with reverent repentance.

We humbly acknowledge that before the **Kalpas of Eons**, the **Supreme Perfected** propagated transformation. They revealed the **Root of Non-Speech** through tranquility, and accomplished the **Non-Governing** through subtlety. When the **Two Images** first took form, diverse paths emerged. The **Eight Assemblies’** texts were established, and the **Six Forms’** functions vied in application.

The **Jade Slips and Jade Cases**, treasured in secrecy above the **Nine Pures**; the **Tortoise Script and Dragon Seal**, proclaimed and circulated throughout the ten thousand realms. They govern humanity and heaven, overseeing the bright and the hidden, the manifest and the obscure.

Now, the Emperor, by heaven-endowed sagacity, grasps the celestial reckoning and unfurls the primordial. Bearing the grace bestowed by the **Great Dao**, moved by the luminous manifestation of divine merit, he aspires to exalt the **Fast of Blessings**, repaying the profound favor from on high.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **Supreme Perfected, Thirty-Six Divisions of the Most Revered Scriptures**, the **True Writs and Sacred Talismans**.

We humbly pray that the Emperor’s longevity equal the **Mountains of Heng and Hua**, his brilliance match the **Sun and Moon’s** radiance. May his divine merit surpass the **Divine Works of Lianlu**, his sagely virtue crown that of **Yao and Tang**. May the Empress, consorts, and princesses, the Crown Prince and the various princes, jointly assist in the flourishing era, extending the grand and precious mandate. May the dukes, ministers, and officials, the people of the Hua and Yi, together ascend the court of **Humaneness and Longevity**, and share in the transformation of **Ascendant Peace**.

May the **Three Paths and Nine Nights**, all beings—whether moving or still, flying or submerged—all rest in the mysterious merit, and together ascend into the **Realm of the Dao**. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

**The Forty-Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites** begins.

**Compiled by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting**
**Fivefold Confession of Ministers Serving the State**

**The Ten Directions**
We, your ministers, wholeheartedly take refuge in the **Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy** of the Ten Directions, the **Perfected Great Sages** who have attained the Dao, the **Most Real Lords and Elders**, and the **Divine Officials of the Ten Realms**. With three bows, we each sincerely confess and repent.

We have heard that the **Ten Poles of the Heavens** and the **Three Thousand Dao Realms** encircle the Great Void within, encompassing the courts of the **Three Realms**. They manifest wondrous transformation in the **Upper Mystery** and bestow numinous grace upon the **Lower Lands**. How vast is this radiant fortune, faithfully protecting the state and its households!

Today, we humbly offer the **Great Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [such-and-such] official, dedicating it to the Emperor. Following the **Mysterious Pattern**, we array the imperial altar, beseeching blessings and grace, performing the fast and practicing the Dao. With reverence, we present incense, flowers, dragon-brocade offerings, and pledges of sincerity, taking refuge in the **Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy** of the Ten Directions, the **Perfected Great Sages** who have attained the Dao, the **Most Real Lords and Elders**, and the **Divine Officials of the Ten Realms**. Now, we establish this fast, burning incense and kindling lamps to brightly illuminate the myriad heavens.

May these merits flow to the **August Spirits of the Altars of Soil and Grain**, the **Ancestral Shrines**, and the **Former Sages**. May the **Nine Radiant Cranes and Canopies** ascend to the **Three Realms** in carefree wandering; may the **Eight-Feathered Dragon Chariots** roam the **Ten Heavens** in boundless freedom. May vast blessings and mighty fortune secretly protect the **Sacred Chart**. May the Emperor embody the Dao and concentrate his regalia, his virtue like Heaven spreading transformation. Riding the **Flying Dragon** to govern all things, may the mountains solidify his grand foundation; wielding the **Great Image** to uphold Heaven, may his sacred longevity equal the peaks.

May the Empress, consorts, and princesses gently assist in the imperial plans. May the Crown Prince and the various princes filially support the imperial throne. May the civil and military officials, both central and regional, propagate the winds of **Peace and Dao-Virtue**, perfecting the principles of **Ritual and Music in Harmonious Prosperity**. May the seasons regulate the **Five Candles**, and the years yield **Jade-like Stores**. May the **Hundred Offices** follow their proper order, and the **Five Armies** remain ever at rest. May the **Dragon Spirits** stand guard, and pestilence and poison dissolve. May the **Four Numinous Beasts** present auspicious omens, and the **Seven Regulators** follow their constant courses in perfect measure.

Extending to all—whether hidden or manifest, flying or submerged—may all receive the benevolence of his governance and together emulate the customs of **Huaxu**. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

**The Three Luminaries**
We, your ministers, wholeheartedly take refuge in the **Most Real Great Sages** of the **Palaces of the Sun, Moon, and Stars**, and the **Divine Officials of the Three Luminaries**. With three bows, we each sincerely confess and give thanks.

We have heard that when Heaven and Earth divided their numina, Yin and Yang formed their images. The positions of the **Sun, Moon, and Stars** were established, determining the distinctions of dusk and dawn, concealment and visibility. The **Seven Governors and Three Palaces** faithfully hold the essentials of life and death; the **Wenchang and Dipper Poles** still wield the authority over sin and fortune. It is fitting to exhaust our reverence in cultivation to aid the state and nation.

Today, we humbly offer the **Great Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [such-and-such] official, dedicating it to the Emperor, presenting ritual pledges. We array the altar, beseeching blessings and grace, performing the fast and practicing the Dao, taking refuge in the **Most Real Great Sages** of the **Palaces of the Sun, Moon, and Stars**, and the **Divine Officials of the Three Luminaries**. Now, we establish this fast, burning incense and kindling lamps to brightly illuminate the myriad heavens.

May these merits flow to the **August Spirits of the Altars of Soil and Grain**, the **Ancestral Shrines**, and the **Former Sages**. May **Rainbow Banners and Feathered Streamers** transcend to the **Palace of the Southern Culmen**; may they **Verify and Penetrate the Mysterious Real**, roaming and feasting in the **Upper Clarity**. May hidden blessings and mighty gifts faithfully protect the imperial foundation.

May the Emperor’s luminous spirit equal the honored, his **Mysterious Pivot** prolonging his years. Riding the **Imperial Chariot** to administer governance, may he grasp the **Jade Axle** to regulate the seasons. May the Empress and consorts illuminate the **Virtuous Standards** among the women’s quarters; may the various princes and the Crown Prince deepen the **Numinous Streams** at the **Starry Ford**. May the chief ministers remain loyal and steadfast, the **Fiefdom Walls** harmonious and peaceful. May the **Hundred Institutions** forever flourish, bringing peace to the **Myriad Regions**. May they swiftly spread the **Virtuous Teachings** and receive **Tribute of Gems** in abundance. May the **Three Luminaries** maintain their order, the **Five Wefts** commit no errors. May the years yield **Bountiful Harvests**, and the people attain **Health and Joy**.

Extending to all—whether flying or submerged, sentient or insentient—may all, whether hidden or manifest, together ascend to the **Realm of Longevity**. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

**The Five Peaks**
We, your ministers, wholeheartedly take refuge in the **True Lords of the Five Peaks**, the **Flying Immortals**, the **Perfected**, and the **Divine Officials of the Named Mountains and Grotto-Heavens** who have attained the Dao. With three bows, we each sincerely confess and repent.

We have heard that when **Hundun** was split open, the **Myriad Peaks** took shape. They support the **Azure Vault** in their ascent and press down upon the **Yellow Chariot** in their descent. The greatest, like **Changli**, stretch across vast wilds, housing the mists and clouds beyond the seas; the next, like **Heng and Hua**, tower as cloud-pavilions, gathering the finest essences of the world. They are the abodes of **Immortals** and the reliance of states and nations. We now present the rites of **Incense and Prayer** to broaden the blessings of **Radiant Fortune**.

Today, we humbly offer the **Great Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [such-and-such] official, dedicating it to the Emperor, presenting ritual pledges and arraying the altar. Beseeching blessings and grace, we perform the fast and practice the Dao, taking refuge in the **True Lords of the Five Peaks**, the **Flying Immortals**, the **Perfected**, and the **Divine Officials of the Named Mountains and Grotto-Heavens** who have attained the Dao. Now, we establish this fast, burning incense and kindling lamps to mystically illuminate the myriad heavens.

May these merits flow to the **August Spirits of the Altars of Soil and Grain**, the **Ancestral Shrines**, and the **Former Sages**. May they transcend the fruits of the **Seven Stages of Cultivation** and verify the **Flying Ascent of the Three Heavens**. May they refine their spirits in the **Courts of Flowing Fire** and ride the **Palaces of Radiant Clouds**.

May boundless fortune forever flourish, reverently aiding the **Dragon Chart**. May the Emperor’s **Five Peaks** be equally tranquil, his longevity matching the **Three Isles**. May his brightness rival the **Sun and Moon of Yao’s Heaven**, and his domain expand the **Frontiers of Yu’s Realm**. May his **Frugal Virtue** surpass that of **Fenqiu**, and his **Benevolent Warmth** exceed that of **Jie’s Net**. May the Empress, consorts, and attendants assist the **Purple Throne**. May the Crown Prince and the various princes propagate the **Radiant Transformation**. May the ministers and officials proclaim the **Supreme Dao in Non-Action**; may the **Myriad Peoples of Hua and Yi** delight in **Great Peace** and fulfill their natures.

May the **Heavenly Lights** be clear and upright, the **Earthly Records** entirely at rest. May the **Nine Grains** be ever abundant, the **Five Armies** forever at rest. Whether in the **Hidden Gates of Night** or among **Exotic Beings of Distinct Kinds**, may all receive the compassion of the **Wondrous Dao** and fully enter the **Realm of Longevity**. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

To the **Water Realms**, we, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and submit to the **Great Emperor of Fusang**, the **Divine King of Yang Valley**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang**, and the **Twelve River Sources**, along with the **Divine Immortals and Spirit Officials of the Water Realms**. With triple reverence, we each offer sincere repentance and gratitude.

We humbly acknowledge that, embodying the **Dao** and drawing upon the numinous, the **power of Water** is indeed paramount. Receiving the **Primordial Yang** to nurture and transform, it pervades all forms; originating from the **First Qi** to generate and complete, it encompasses all beings. Thus, the **Nine Seas and Eight Oceans** display the majesty of floating heaven and nourishing the sun; even a single leaf or slender stem bears the grace of moistening blessings and bestowed glory. Through its **mysterious merit and wondrous efficacy**, it brings fortune to the state and the household.

Today, we reverently conduct the **Grand Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [Title] the Emperor, adhering to the **mystic rites** and establishing the **imperial altar**. We beseech blessings and grace, performing the fast and practicing the **Dao**. We prostrate and submit to the **Great Emperor of Fusang**, the **Divine King of Yang Valley**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang**, and the **Twelve River Sources**, along with the **Divine Immortals and Spirit Officials of the Water Realms**. For this fast, we now kindle incense and light lamps, illuminating all heavens.

May these **merits and virtues** flow to the **august spirits of the altars and temples**, the **ancestral sages of the imperial lineage**, who wander the boundless and unite with the **subtle and formless**. May they receive **secret instructions** on the **Mystic Continent** and obtain the **divine pearl** from the **Red Waters**.

May the Emperor’s **azure waves bestow fortune**, and the **blue seas grant equal years**. May all regions rejoice in the **vast and boundless grace**, and the **ten thousand states** follow the **tributary currents**. May the Empress, consorts, and attendants spread **sagely favor** within the **Jade Palace**; may the Crown Prince and the various princes dredge the **source of the Silver River**. May the ministers and officials, both civil and military, extend the **nurturing and embellishing principles**, and broaden the **serene and clarifying transformation**. May the **Nine Rivers** offer strategies, and the **Warm Luo** reveal its chart. May Heaven and Earth manifest auspicious signs, and the **black-haired people** receive blessings. May all beings, near and far, even those in the **hidden depths**, together attain the **wind of virtue and Dao**, and forever enjoy the **gift of peace and stability**. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

---

To the **Scriptures**, we, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and submit to the **Most True and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures**, the **True Writ and Treasure Talismans**. With triple reverence, we each offer sincere repentance and gratitude.

We humbly acknowledge that the **Dao in Non-Action** is the root, and the **true lineage** is emptiness and quiescence. Its **wondrous nourishment** is wordless, its **subtle and imperceptible** nature beyond measure. Thus, it initiates the **vast and expansive teaching**, revealing the **secret and profound merit**. Here, the **Eight Assemblies of Numinous Writ** and the **Nine-Ray Cloud Script** take form: dragons coil and phoenixes dance, first congealing within the **Great Vastness**; jade tablets and jasper scrolls are then inscribed within the **layered terraces**. The **thirty-six divisions** are vast, and the **myriad thousands of categories** are numerous. Their principles flow through the **profound and mysterious**, and their meanings encompass all wonders. They are revered by humans and heavens, and followed by states and nations. They **illuminate the imperial Dao and assist the royal enterprise**, dispersing the **Nine Schools** to bring peace to the **ten thousand realms**.

We now reverently conduct the **Grand Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [Title] the Emperor, adhering to the **ritual codes** and venerably establishing the **altar**. We beseech blessings and grace, performing the fast and practicing the **Dao**. We prostrate and submit to the **Most True and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures**, the **True Writ and Treasure Talismans**, the **secret treasuries of all heavens**, the **orthodox Dharma of the ten directions**, the **guardian scriptures**, and all **spirit officials**. For this fast, we now kindle incense and light lamps, illuminating all heavens.

May these **merits and virtues** flow to the **august spirits of the altars and temples**, the **ancestral sages of the imperial lineage**, who **join the True on the Purple Ultimate** and **shed their forms in the Vast Capital**. May they **bestow protection upon the imperial line**, and **flow blessings through ten thousand generations**.

May the Emperor **communicate with the true and contract the Dao**, his reign enduring as **Heaven and Earth**. May he **unify the ten thousand states under one chariot and script**, and **harmonize Great Unity to pacify seas and mountains**. May the Empress, consorts, and attendants **enjoy blessings in the Purple Court**; may the Crown Prince and the various princes **inherit the auspicious imperial standard**. May the loyal and meritorious officials **constantly exert themselves in assisting and advising**; may the **myriad living beings** **secure the flourishing and peaceful era**. May the **Heavenly Principle follow its course**, and the **auspicious stars and radiant sun** be witnessed; may the **Earthly Records be peaceful and stable**, and the **Nine Grains and Eight Silkworms** manifest their wonders. May the **hidden and manifest** together prosper, and all **movement and stillness** be at peace. May those within the **seas and the realm** together attain the **transformation of the Dao**.

After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.

**Compiled by Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty: Methods for Expiation and Repentance**
**General Repentance**

We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so, who follows the rites of expiation and examination, conducts the fast, and practices the Dao, repenting for the boundless transgressions committed by thirty-six generations of ancestors, from the myriad past forebears to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These offenses, accumulated through the ages, have:

**Offended above** the great sages of the myriad heavens, the host of honored ones of the Great Dao, the Three Luminaries and Five Phases, the deities governing the void, wind, clouds, thunder, and rain.
**Offended below** the Five Marchmounts and all mountains, the thirty-six earthly realms, the mounds and water palaces, and the underworld officials.
**Offended within** the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, the yin-yang bureaus, the ancient and modern numinous sages, and the worthies of former ages.

They have violated the Five Constants and transgressed against the Four Great Elements. Their names are inscribed in the ledgers of sin, and calamities are bound at the gates of darkness. Their lifespans were cut short, failing to fulfill Heaven’s allotted span. After their bodies perished, they remained detained in the earthly courts, confined as suffering souls in the deepest prisons. They have endured every torment, undergone every trial, shuttled through the Three Wretched Paths, and drifted through the Five Destinies. Subjected to cruel punishments and exhausting labors, their forms are broken and emaciated beyond endurance. Their offenses and misfortunes linger unending, with no hope of absolution.

Today, in accordance with the ranks of the transcendent immortals, we repent our sins and seek mercy. We burn incense, light lamps, conduct the fast, and practice the Dao, surrendering our lives to the Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, the perfected great sages who have attained the Dao, the true lords and venerable ones, and the divine officials of the ten celestial realms.

We humbly implore the Three Honored Ones and the great sages of the myriad heavens to open the fount of great compassion and bestow boundless grace. May they command the flying celestial beings to bear the Nine Dragon Talismanic Decrees, proclaiming to the courts of the Ten Directions and the officials of the underworld hells: absolve the boundless sins accumulated through the ages. Open the Nine Dark Hells and release the souls of the long night. Bathe them in the Crimson Mound’s courts, clothe them in the regalia of the Cavernous Yang’s precincts. May they be reborn in the blessed realms of the divine, and may blessings flow to their descendants. May auspicious protection ever attend them, and may the living and the dead alike find peace. May this uphold the nation’s fortune and extend to all beings. May all attain the mysterious bliss and forever ascend to the true ranks. After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the true.

**East**
We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so, who conducts the great fast of expiation and examination, recites the scriptures, and practices the Dao, surrendering our lives to the Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine officials of the eastern celestial realm. We repent for the boundless transgressions committed by so-and-so’s thirty-six generations of ancestors, from the myriad past forebears to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These sins, accumulated through the ages, include:

Acts contrary to kindness and nurturance, lacking benevolence and humanity; disloyalty to lords and teachers, failing in filial piety; harming the good and upright, offending the divine; violating the Five Constants and indulging in all manner of evil; curses and malevolent prayers, killing the innocent. Their punishments are severe, their calamities profound, yet they have not received absolution. Their souls are seized and beaten, confined in the Wood Bureau’s Eastern Marchmount’s pounding hell, suffering the torments of sword trees, blade mountains, wind, and thunder. Day and night, they endure excruciating trials beyond endurance. Their misfortunes afflict their descendants, and their woes flow endlessly to later generations. In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.

Today, we repent, seek mercy, conduct the fast, and practice the Dao. We humbly implore the great compassion to show mercy, and the myriad sages to turn their radiance toward us. May they proclaim to the courts of the Eastern Bureau and the officials of the underworld: untangle the knots of enmity, absolve the souls of their sins. May they be entrusted to the courts of blessings, ascend to the pure realms. May the living enjoy peace and prosperity, forever bearing the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the true.

**South**
We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so, who conducts the supreme wondrous fast of expiation and examination, recites the scriptures, and practices the Dao, surrendering our lives to the Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the South, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine officials of the southern celestial realm. We repent for the boundless transgressions committed by so-and-so’s thirty-six generations of ancestors, from the myriad past forebears to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These sins, accumulated through the ages, include:

Following cruel impulses to kill the innocent; making vows and pacts to inflict harm upon beings; lewd and improper conduct, oppressing the chaste and good; transgressing rites and decorum, indulging in evil deeds; offending Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and all divine beings. Their punishments are severe, their calamities profound, yet they have not received absolution. Their souls are seized and beaten, confined in the Fire Bureau’s Southern Marchmount’s pounding hell, suffering the torments of furnace and charcoal, their forms burned and broken. Day and night, they endure excruciating trials beyond endurance. Their misfortunes afflict their descendants, flowing endlessly onward. In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.

Today, we repent, seek mercy, conduct the fast, and practice the Dao. We humbly hope the Three Honored Ones will look upon us with mercy, and the host of sages will cast their radiance upon us. May they proclaim to the Fire Bureau’s Southern Marchmount’s pounding hell: absolve the accumulated sins, pardon the souls of the dark. May they emerge from the Huo Mountain hells and ascend to the Crimson Cavern’s Yang Palace. May the living receive protection, forever bearing the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the true.

**West**

We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so who performs the Supreme Wondrous Fast for Liberation from Torment, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the West, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Western Quarter. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so across thirty-six generations, from countless ancestors to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These sins may include: failing to yield with righteousness, flattery and deceit without cause; envying the worthy and able, defiling and disrupting the divine Dao; cruelty without measure, slaughter driven by whim; breaking vows and violating covenants, scheming with curses and hexes. The misfortunes and transgressions congeal like mountains, the punishments severe and the trials profound, yet no absolution has been granted. The souls are bound and detained in the Metal Bureau’s Hua Mountain hells, enduring the torments of copper pillars, iron beds, and golden hammers. Day and night, they suffer unrelenting agony, with no respite in eating or resting. Their grievances entangle the living, lingering unresolved. In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.

Today, we practice the Dao and conduct the fast, beseeching mercy and repenting for liberation. We humbly hope the Heavenly Worthy will show compassion, and the Great Dao will cast its radiance upon us. May they proclaim to the Western Bureau’s halls and the courts of the torment officials: dissolve the accumulated misfortunes, release the bound souls. May they ascend to the Heavenly Paradise, reborn in the realm of immortals. May the living and the dead alike find peace, forever bearing the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the true.

**North**

We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so who performs the Supreme Wondrous Fast for Liberation from Torment, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the North, the Five Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northern Quarter. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so across thirty-six generations, from countless ancestors to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These sins may include: defying the Heavenly Dao above and offending the Earthly Offices below; polluting the Three Luminaries and belittling the Four Great Elements; resenting wind and rain, invoking ghosts and spirits; inflicting harm upon others, destroying living things. The souls are bound and arraigned in the Water Bureau’s Heng Mountain hells, suffering the agonies of freezing ice, night gardens, and icy rivers. Their flesh splits from the cold, myriad pains piercing their bodies. The misfortunes extend to their descendants, the calamities flowing unceasing. In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.

Today, we practice the Dao and conduct the fast, beseeching mercy and repenting for our transgressions. We humbly hope the hosts of heaven will look upon us with favor, and the myriad sages will bestow their grace. May they command the Northern Bureau’s halls and the courts of the torment officials: absolve the sins and transgressions, liberate the suffering souls. May they depart the frozen gardens of endless night, escape the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. May they ascend to the pure realms of the spirits, and the living receive blessings and protection. May their clans and kin find peace, the living and the dead alike secure. Having received what we sought, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the true.

**Northeast**

We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so who performs the Supreme Wondrous Fast for Liberation from Torment, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, the Qi of Purity Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northeastern Quarter. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so across thirty-six generations, from countless ancestors to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These sins may include: as children, failing in filial piety; as subjects, failing in loyalty; as fathers, lacking compassion; as rulers, lacking the Dao; envying the worthy and resenting the good; turning from uprightness to embrace depravity; speaking falsely while harboring deceit, self-deception even in solitude; committing the Five Heinous Crimes and perpetrating every evil; wrongfully harming the innocent, killing without just cause. From life to death, their grievances pierce the heavens. They curse the divine, employ hexes and sorcery. The misfortunes run deep, the punishments severe, their souls tormented in the earthly prisons and pounding hells. They endure myriad trials, their bodies and souls broken and exhausted. In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.

Today, we repent for our sins and seek mercy, conducting the fast and practicing the Dao. We humbly hope the Ten Heavens will grant absolution, and the myriad sages will open the gates of mercy. May they command the Northeastern Quarter’s pounding hells and the courts of the torment officials: dissolve the karmic retributions, pardon the imprisoned souls. May they depart the land of dark confinement, escape the suffering of heavy fetters. Bathed in the divine cinnabar of Huo Mountain, may they soar to the Crimson Numinous realm. May their grievances be forever resolved, their descendants secure and at peace. Having received what we sought, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the true.

**Southeast**

We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so who performs the Supreme Wondrous Fast for Liberation from Torment, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, the Qi of Purity Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southeastern Quarter. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s family across countless generations, from ancestors to the departed spirits and all kith and kin, and across thirty-six lifetimes. These sins may include: wanton violence and oppression; bullying and tormenting others; scorning the orphaned and destitute, despising the elderly and infirm; exposing others’ faults while concealing their virtues; sowing discord among kin, suppressing the poor and weak; scheming through unrighteous means, slandering the worthy and good; undermining others’ achievements, envying those who surpass them; killing without just cause, indulging in cruelty without restraint. They invoke the heavens and earth, the sun, moon, and stars as witnesses to their crimes. The sins run deep, the punishments severe, their souls bound in the earthly prisons and courts of torment. They endure the trials of water, fire, wind, and blades, day and night without respite. The misfortunes extend endlessly, with no means of deliverance.

Today, we repent and seek mercy, conducting the fast and practicing the Dao. We humbly hope the Ten Directions’ Great Sages and the Five Emperors’ August Worthies will command the Southeastern Quarter’s pounding hells and the courts of the torment officials: redeem the imprisoned souls, cleanse their bodies and spirits. May their myriad sins be absolved, their accumulated misfortunes eradicated. May their grievances be resolved, their debts and disputes settled in peace. May the living receive blessings, and the spirits ascend to the pure realms.

May the hidden and the manifest alike receive protection, forever bearing the profound grace.

After attaining the Dao, they ascend into the formless,
harmony merging with the true Dao.

To the Southwest Quarter:
We now burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so’s performance of the Supreme Fast for Deliverance from Torment. We recite scriptures and practice the Dao, reverently submitting to the Southwest’s Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Celestial Lords of Pristine Qi, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southwest Realm. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In their lifetimes, they may have spoken ornately without substance, feigned truth with deceit, deceived the wise and foolish alike, or insulted true sages. They may have sided with the strong to oppress the weak, or indulged in greed and malice without restraint. They may have contended for profit and wealth, seized reputations and ranks, or schemed to harm and poison the loyal and good. They may have endangered others to secure their own safety, killed living beings for personal gain, or plundered wealth without pity for the orphaned and destitute. They may have sworn oaths and formed pacts, invoking gods and ghosts, thereby incurring karmic retribution that now lingers in the hidden realms. Their souls are bound in the earthly prisons and courts of torment, confined in dark cells, deprived of light. They endure ceaseless trials, suffering without end. Today, we conduct the fast and practice the Dao, repenting and seeking mercy. We humbly hope the Most High Sages and August Perfected Ones, in their great compassion and forgiveness, will cast their divine light downward to illuminate the darkness. May they command the Southwest Quarter’s pounding hells and the courts of the torment officials: deliver the imprisoned souls, that they may be reborn in the courts of blessing. May all receive grace, the living and the dead alike finding peace. Should our prayers be answered, we shall forever bear the profound grace.

After attaining the Dao, they ascend into the formless,
harmony merging with the true Dao.

To the Northwest Quarter:
We now burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so’s performance of the Supreme Fast for Deliverance from Torment. We recite scriptures and practice the Dao, reverently submitting to the Northwest’s Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Celestial Lords of Pristine Qi, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northwest Realm. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. Their transgressions run deep, their torments severe, their offenses spanning kalpas without resolution. They suffer retribution across the six destinies and three evil paths, their souls beaten and bound in the earthly prisons and pounding hells. The pain is unbearable, extending to their descendants, the misfortunes flowing endlessly across kalpas. Today, we repent and seek mercy, conducting the fast and practicing the Dao. We humbly beseech the assembled August Sages and Most High Worthies to bestow their compassionate light, absolving the imprisoned souls and delivering them from hidden suffering. May they command the Northwest Quarter’s pounding hells and the courts of the torment officials: resolve grievances, settle disputes, and eradicate all accumulated transgressions. May the living and the dead alike be delivered, their households and nations receiving grace.

After attaining the Dao, they ascend into the formless,
harmony merging with the true Dao.

To the Upper Quarter:
We now burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so’s performance of the Supreme Fast for Deliverance from Torment. We recite scriptures and practice the Dao, reverently submitting to the Upper Quarter’s Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Thirty-Six Celestial Lords, the Lords of Pristine Qi of the Jade Capital, Mystic Metropolis, Purple Tenuity, Golden Gates, the Three Clarities, and the Three Realms, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Upper Realm. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In their lifetimes, they may have defied the heavenly Dao, defiled the Three Luminaries, exposed the divine to the elements, or raged against thunder and rain. They may have deceived both the hidden and the manifest, showing no fear of true spirits. The Nine Offices have imposed punishments, the Three Bureaus have meted out trials. Their souls are beaten and bound in the eternal night of the Nine Dark Prisons. They drift through the cold courts, confined in dark cells, lost in endless kalpas without light. Their misfortunes flow to their descendants, entangling both the living and the dead in mutual accusations, with no means of cleansing. Today, we repent and seek mercy, conducting the fast and practicing the Dao. We humbly beseech the Three Clarities, the myriad sages, the Most High Perfected Ones, the Celestial Lords, the Four Controllers, the Five Emperors, the Three Luminaries, the constellations, and the true spirits of the Three Realms to bestow their vast compassion and witness our sincere devotion. May they command the courts of the torment officials and the earthly prisons: deliver the souls, absolve their crimes, resolve grievances, and free them from suffering to be reborn in heaven. May they ascend to the halls of blessing, hear the scriptures, and awaken to the Dao. May they forever transcend life and death, entering the realm of non-action. May disputes be settled, the living and the dead alike finding peace. Should our prayers be answered, we shall forever bear the profound grace.

After attaining the Dao, they ascend into the formless,
harmony merging with the true Dao.

To the Lower Quarter:
We now burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so’s performance of the Supreme Fast for Deliverance from Torment. We recite scriptures and practice the Dao, reverently submitting to the Lower Quarter’s Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Nine Mound Earthly Sovereigns, the Four Controllers, the Five Emperors, the Twelve Immortal Lords, the Nine Palace Perfected Ones, the divine immortals, jade maidens, and the spirit officials of the Lower Realm. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In their lifetimes, they may have falsely claimed mastery of the Dao, carved up lands, hills, ridges, plains, and waterways. They may have destroyed tombs and temples, suppressed divine spirits, blocked water sources, or dammed mountains and valleys. They may have razed city walls, altars, and shrines, or offended the earthly officials of marquisates and principalities. They showed no fear of the divine, indulging in evil without restraint. Their souls are beaten and bound in the Lower Realm’s Nine Dark Prisons. They draw water from the eternal night’s river to irrigate the Four Waterways, or bear mountains and carry stones, condemned to endless labor.

Their suffering is bound as an infant’s, endless through all time. It extends upward to past lives, downward to descendants. Retribution remains unfulfilled, calamity deepens, and punishment grows heavier. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and uproot the roots of sin. We prostrate ourselves, beseeching the august assembly of saints to open their mercy and grant pardon. We implore the underworld officials of Fengdu, the Nine Dark Prisons, and the halls of judgment to absolve the boundless karmic causes of past kalpas. May the destitute souls be delivered, freed from the depths of darkness, to roam the true realms and dwell in the land of blessings. May descendants enjoy peace and prosperity, and may the living and the dead alike find serenity. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

The Three Luminaries:
We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the palaces of the sun, moon, and stars, the perfected and great sages, the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Three Luminaries. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have been unrighteous rulers, disloyal ministers, unkind fathers, or unfilial sons. They violated the celestial patterns and earthly principles, as well as the sun, moon, and stars, accumulating deep stains of evil. Their hidden sins and manifest transgressions were inscribed in the ledgers of wickedness. Upon death, their souls were seized by ghostly officials and confined in the eternal night’s halls of judgment. Beaten and bound in heavy fetters, they had no means of expiation. Now, through repentance and the seeking of grace, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we prostrate ourselves, hoping the great sages of the heavens and the august assembly of the Three Luminaries will command the underworld prisons and halls of judgment to absolve their accumulated sins and reconcile their enmities. May their debts and disputes be settled, and may the living and the dead find peace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

The Five Peaks:
We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the True Lords of the Five Peaks, the grotto-heavens of the famous mountains, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials who have attained the Dao. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have recklessly provoked offenses, defying the divine. They violated the famous mountains and great rivers, the sacred sites and blessed lands, the lords of hills and plains, and the hidden officials and spirit-offices. Their sins coiled endlessly, never pardoned. Their souls were seized and bound in the earthly prisons of the Five Peaks. Their suffering was complete, endless through all time. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and seek grace. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the myriad sages will extend their compassion and the heavens will witness and protect. We implore the officials of the Five Peaks’ prisons and halls of judgment to dissolve their enmities, wash away their sins, and eradicate all evil. May the Nine Dark Prisons be illuminated, and may our plea be granted, bearing the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

The Water Realms:
We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the water emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Twelve River Sources and Water Realms. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have slighted the true spirits, disrespected the divine, defiled the springs, or harmed the rivers and marshes. Their transgressions became manifold, binding them in the nether courts. Their souls were seized and beaten, confined in the Water Realms’ prisons under the halls of judgment. They endured every torment, their suffering unbearable, hauling and drawing the dark waves to irrigate the Four Waterways. Through the icy rivers and freezing nights, their bodies cracked. They saw no light, with no means of deliverance. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and seek grace. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the myriad sages will witness our plea and the Three August Ones will grant pardon. We implore the officials of the Water Realms’ prisons and halls of judgment to untie their enmities, absolve their sins, and erase their transgressions. May they depart the land of darkness and ascend to the realm of purity. May their souls be refined, attaining ranks to be born in heaven. May their sins be forever erased, and their descendants enjoy peace and prosperity. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

The Sacred Scriptures:
We now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the thirty-six divisions of the most perfected and supreme sacred scriptures, the true writs and precious talismans, the secret treasuries of the heavens, the true Dharma of the ten directions, and all spirit-officials who guard the scriptures. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In past kalpas and future kalpas, across a hundred million lives, through the deeds of the three karmas and the creations of the six senses, their hidden sins and manifest transgressions were heavy in judgment and deep in punishment. They may have slighted or desecrated texts, defiled sacred writs, slandered the holy scriptures, or leaked secret texts. Their calamities coiled endlessly, never repented. Their souls were seized and beaten, confined in the Nine Dark Prisons. They endured torture and were bound in dark fetters. Through the eternal night, they had no means of deliverance. Now, through repentance and the seeking of grace, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we prostrate ourselves, hoping the spirit-officials will memorialize the throne and extend their merciful blessings. We implore the officials of the underworld prisons and halls of judgment to dissolve their karmic retributions and reconcile their enmities. May they transcend the gates of the Yellow Springs and ascend the path of blessings. May their descendants be secure and prosperous, and may the Nine Nights and Three Paths alike receive radiant protection. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

**Reporting Merits and Presenting Memorials**

When the days of the fast are complete, either at midnight of the final day or at dawn the following morning, the assembled officials shall arrange themselves in ranks before the Mystic Master. Once the formation is set, they shall chant the *Dao* and enter the chamber. Each shall bow to the Master, maintaining visualization as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Five Stars’ Protective Radiance**
The Five Stars array their illumination, resplendent across the five directions.
The Water Star averts calamity,
The Wood Power brings prosperity.
Mars dispels misfortune,
Venus repels warfare.
[Missing character] The Earth Star’s fourfold governance ensures the state’s flourishing.
Inscribed upon jade tablets, names recorded in the Celestial Palace,
They ride the whirlwind, wielding light, soaring through the Great Void.
Emerging from and entering the unseen, they wander and feast in the ten directions.
Five-colored clouds overspread them, summoning spirits and commanding winds.
They dispatch the myriad numina, upholding the Transcendent Elder above.

**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

O Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, First Three *Qi*, Supreme Dao Lord, we summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Two Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Register for this day. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn vestments, to open the gates of the Mystic Altar’s Celestial Thearchs. Let the local earth gods and territorial true officials swiftly ascend to receive this summons.

We now reverently offer incense on behalf of the petitioner’s intent, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao *qi* and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies. May the Mystic Altar be purified, within and without, to attain perfection. May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth purged of demonic dust. May the jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow hushed and clear. May the myriad demons not intrude, and our sincerity ascend unobstructed. May our plea swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, Boundless, Perfect, and True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao.

**Each declares their dharma rank:**
Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mystic Capital, conducting the Great Yellow Register Fast, reporting merits and presenting memorials, performing the rite of offering and casting the dragon tablets, and concluding the return-to-palace liturgy.

We now burn incense, dedicating these merits above for the ancestral spirits of the imperial ancestral temple, the reigning emperor, the civil and military officials, the ministers and all functionaries, as well as for the petitioner’s nine generations and seven degrees of kin, living family members, our own three masters and nine ancestors, all people under heaven, every sentient being, and those lost in the dark paths of the unseen realms. We surrender body, spirit, and destiny to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.

We beseech forgiveness for the heavy sins of past lives and this existence, deliverance from the Three Evil Paths, and relief from the ten sufferings, eight adversities, and nine calamities. May our bodies attain the true Dao and traverse the empty sky. May we ascend to heaven in broad daylight, awaiting attendance upon the Dao Lord. May we roam freely in the Supreme Golden Palaces of the Seven Treasures’ spontaneous halls, forever harmonizing with the Dao.

May our mystical entreaty ascend before the Perfect and Boundless True Dao.

**Homage to the Ten Directions**
**Confession of Transgressions**

**Threefold Invocation Hymn**

The Law is my beloved wife,
the scriptures treasured as jade bright.
Holding fast the precepts, I restrain the six passions;
mindful of the Dao, I cast aside all desire.
Serene and pure, my upright qi abides;
tranquil and still, my spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and guard me,
life after life I receive boundless fortune.
My household and kingdom flourish in abundance,
the scriptures and Dao thrive in majestic splendor.
Heaven and humankind share this one aspiration,
soaring aloft in the vastness of the Great Vehicle.
From the heart I establish my field of merit,
as the Wheel of Dharma ascends in gentle ascent.
My seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,
while my own body soars in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the mysterious void—
with thought, nothing fails to align.
Refining my form, I enter the immortal truth,
and attain the adamantine body.
I transcend the trials of the Three Realms,
the five torments of hell are released.
All return to the scriptures of the Most High;
in silent contemplation, I bow in reverence.

**Threefold Prostration**
With utmost sincerity, I bow in reverence to the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High.
With utmost sincerity, I bow in reverence to the thirty-six revered scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, I bow in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Ritual Circumambulation**
Gathering the true writ, from the east, south, west, north, and center, each at their respective altars, incense is lit to fumigate the true writ. All officials chant the true writ in unison, and the disciple holds the true writ over the incense to fumigate it.

The Dharma Master strikes his teeth twelve times and recites the incantation:
*"Primordial Beginning of the Upper Heavens,
the Three Luminaries shine in lofty brilliance.
Turning light to illuminate,
the four directions gleam in clarity.
Guiding the flow of destiny,
sparking yang like streaming stars.
The five phases clash in discord,
the three constellations lose their peace.
The Five Celestial Palaces gather the stars,
the Seven Luminaries radiate their numen.
True Lord, Great Chief,
whose hidden name is Jade Essence.
The Lady, Heavenly Consort,
is called Nurturer of Infants.
Together they govern the Mysterious Pass,
revolving all heavens.
Now, with certain calamities,
ominous portents have been mystically revealed.
I present this true writ,
inscribed in red, to ascend above.
Disheveling my hair, I confess my transgressions,
baring my crimson sincerity.
I beseech your mysterious scrutiny,
to restore the celestial scriptures.
Let qi not flow amiss,
let disasters not arise untimely.
Burning the sacred writ,
its smoke scatters in the Jade Court.
The Upper Radiance oversees and delivers,
proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
Qi purifies the Three Passes,
disasters vanish in the Nine Nether realms.
Yin and yang harmonize,
the land enjoys great peace.
I entreat the Golden Dragon,
to swiftly transmit this by wind and fire."*

This incantation derives from the *Red Writ of Jade Secrets*. During the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, when performing the Yellow Register rites or rituals of deliverance, inscribe the text of the Year Star’s assistance to the liver, and use this incantation. If exorcising demonic epidemics, inscribe the Eastern Mountain Divine Incantation, which has its own separate incantation. To avert the hundred-and-six great calamities, inscribe the text to subdue the Eastern River. For scholars cultivating the self, inscribe the Nine Qi of the East. If stars or constellations stray from their courses and the Nine Luminaries bring disaster, follow this incantation.

The *Jade Secrets* state: *"In all prayers and exorcisms, if one does not first strike the teeth before reciting the incantation, external demons will intrude, and the gates of response will remain unopened."* It further states: *"If the baleful star is in the east, expose the writ for nine days, and the Golden Dragon will pacify it. For seven days in the west, three in the south, five in the north, and twelve in the center—all follow the qi and numerology of the Great Dao. The baleful star in the east refers to its presence among the Horn and Neck constellations; the rest may be inferred accordingly."* Conclude by burning this true writ along with the memorial.

Amidst the dispersing azure smoke of incense.

Upon the conclusion of the incantation, all officials bow again, each following this precedent.

Solemnly invoking their dharma-positions, the disciples of the Upper Clarity and Mystic Capital, your servants [Name] and others, reverently and repeatedly address the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao—the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Supreme Mystic Elder; the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Celestial Venerables; the Great Sage Assemblies who have attained the Dao; the Perfected Lords and Masters; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center; the Celestial Master Lord; the Supreme Ministers and Prime Councilors; the Four Offices and Five Emperors; the Eastern Marchmount’s Minister of Fate and True Lord of Life; the Western Ultimate’s Sovereign of All Perfected Ones; the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching; the Numinous Palaces of the Five Marchmounts; the Grotto-Realms of Famous Mountains; and all responsive and efficacious numina of the Three Realms.

By karmic affinity with the Dao, your servants have personally encountered the true transformation. The Celestial Venerable expounded the Dharma, and the Three Caverns proclaimed its practice. Sacred instructions and numinous charts bring salvation to households and peace to the realm. Having been granted participation in the wondrous and true, we were permitted to receive and cultivate it. Yet first, we must establish merit to universally benefit both the hidden and the manifest. It is fitting to magnify the sagely teachings and broadly deliver heaven and humanity. None who sincerely submit shall be rejected or forsaken. Now, in obedience to the edict, how dare we not report above?

Reading the memorial:
Following the memorial’s sincerity, we have joined together in mutual support. Consulting the codes of the numinous immortals and perusing the texts of the Yellow Register, we act on behalf of [Name] at the [Name] Abbey in [State and County], establishing the ritual forms of the Mystic Rite and modeling the Two Modes. We present the lamps, candles, incense, flowers, golden dragons, and silken banners—pledges of our destined lives—to attest and verify our cinnabar sincerity. Beginning at the midnight hour of [Day], we initiate the fast. Burning incense and pacing the Dao, we repent and give thanks to the Mystic Perfected. Kindling lamps to continue the light, we illuminate the Three Realms, reaching downward through the Nine Earths and upward to all heavens. We deliver the living and rescue the dead, universally benefiting household and state. For [Number] days and nights, we pace the Dao and recite the scriptures. At the eleventh hour of [Day], the merit is perfected and the task accomplished. The lotus lamps dim their flames, and the jade chimes gather their sound. The immortal chariots return to the Upper Mysteries, and the Dharma’s flow disperses through the lower realms. Golden dragons ascend in radiance to report the fast’s merit. The sagely grace extends compassion, opening deliverance to the hidden and the lost. Rewarding merit and bestowing honors, it universally reaches the numinous offices.

Within our bodies, the inner and outer Perfected Officials we bear, the soldiers and scribes of the Three Caverns, the stellar lodges and Nine Palaces, the Five Emperors, the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the troops and cavalry, the attendant incense-bearing Golden Lads, the flower-scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans who transmit and report, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry—all have labored with merit. Now, they shall be separately honored. On yellow silk and vermilion memorials, their merits are proclaimed and promotions recommended.

Your servants’ mastery of the Dharma remains incomplete, constrained by the measures of reverence and humility.

Advancing or halting in violation of statutes, failing to conform to ritual propriety—we fear being impeached by the Four Offices or seized by the Five Emperors. For a thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults, we beseech pardon and forgiveness. Though our ignorance remains unenlightened, may no punishment be visited upon us.

At the commencement of this retreat, we reverently invited the Wisdom of the Highest Grade and performed the Ten Precepts Dharma rites, which now being concluded, we escort them back to the Heavenly Palace. The retreat we have conducted is now complete in merit and accomplishment. To further clarify these merits, we present a memorial on yellow silk with vermilion script.

Upon our jade table, we request the inspection of the memorial text. The text is inscribed on five feet of fine yellow silk, with vermilion borders and vermilion script, each line containing twenty-four characters. No "living" character appears at the bottom of a line, nor any "dead" character at the top. The first line records the Dharma rank in full, concluding with the phrase "bowing my head." The opening address occupies its own line. "The Most High and Boundless Dao Lord" appears on the third line. After "the memorial is hereby presented," omit the supplicant’s surname for three lines. After the sacred title, again omit the surname for three lines. The date follows, separated from the sacred title by three lines. All must adhere strictly to the prescribed format, with no emendations—lest corrections incur reprimand, a matter of utmost gravity.

**Reading the Memorial**
Take the memorial from the incense burner, fumigate it, and begin reading. At the mention of the Dharma rank, bow twice, then resume the kneeling posture. Maintain a harmonious voice and upright qi. When the disciple’s name is read, bow twice again. From the phrase "your servant, in trembling awe," bow twice more. At the date and place, bow once more, then bow twice again. When finished, spread the memorial upon the jade table, aligning it directly before the Celestial Presence. Secure it with a dragon-headed writing knife to the left of the sacred title and a vermilion brush to the right, then resume the kneeling posture. Light three pinches of incense, strike the teeth three times, and dispatch the memorial, issuing the decree:

We solemnly dispatch the Perfected Officials of the Five Constituents within our bodies, each accompanied by one minor clerk and twelve scribal assistants. We further command the Merit Officers, the Flying Dragon Cavalry, and the Courier Envoys to attire themselves in full regalia—crowns, sashes, pendants, inkstones, brushes, and girded swords—to prepare the records. Without delay, they shall bear this yellow-silk vermilion memorial to the Heavenly Bureaus and present it in audience. Should any errors occur—omissions, misplaced characters, disordered phrases, or improper sequencing—the transmitting scribes, attendant clerks, and their dragon-headed writing knives and long-haired brushes shall correct them on the spot. Let no supervising official have cause to return it.

Holding the breath, ascend the memorial directly to the presence of the Most High and Boundless Dao Lord of the Three Heavens. Proceed without delay. The Left Lord shall pass through the gates, the Right Clerk shall announce in proper order. Each official shall proceed according to rank. May what we have requested descend, what we have summoned arrive, what we have healed be cured, what we have condemned be destroyed, what we have proclaimed be transmitted, what we have promoted advance, what we have wished be fulfilled, and what we have sought be obtained. Should any subordinate official dare obstruct or intercept this memorial, preventing its ascent, they shall be seized and delivered to the nearest prison, their crimes adjudicated according to celestial law to uphold the heavenly statutes.

We prostrate ourselves, awaiting the response of mysterious grace.

The Dharma Master, standing behind the table, closes his eyes and faces the Heavenly Gate, bowing deeply in visualization. The officials and soldiers within his body, along with the Generals of the Three Primes and the Merit Officers with their mounts, array themselves before and behind him. His body ascends in a feathered carriage, a dragon-drawn chariot, rising gently within the purple qi to the gate of the Three Heavens. First, he pays homage to the Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens, then enters the left gate of the Mysterious Capital Palace. After presenting the memorial, he bears the case directly into the Three Heavens Gate. Twelve attendants—those bearing the memorial, presenting it, and awaiting its review—stand in readiness. Upon completion, he exits the Three Heavens Gate, mounts his feathered carriage with his retinue, and returns. The passage through the heavenly palaces and celestial roads follows the same sequence as the memorial rites of the Three and Five Heavens—details of which are not repeated here.

Next, the inner officials strike their teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:
The memorial having been presented, the Merit Officers, Courier Envoys, and Perfected Officials of the Three and Five Heavens who emerged from our body shall now return—entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left returning to the left, those on the right to the right. The Directing Merit Officers and overseers shall resume their original positions, ensuring no confusion. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before.

Strike the teeth twice, swallow the saliva twice. Visualize the officials of the Three and Five Heavens memorial rites returning to their places within the body. Bow twice, then roll the memorial into its case, sealing it with the true writ. Place it upon the incense table. The Cavern Tablet Officer shall bear it, the Retreat Supervisor shall escort it, with banners and regalia leading the way, the disciples following. At the Heavenly Gate, it is burned.

The Dharma Master, from his position, faces the Heavenly Gate and visualizes the Perfected Officials bearing the true-writ memorial ascending with the azure smoke and vermilion flames into the Heavenly Gate.

**Burning the Memorial with Invocation**
Beings are beset by obstacles and hardships,
The Great Dao shows profound compassion.
Salvation and deliverance abide in precepts and rites,
All are enabled to repent their karmic entanglements.
Transgressions are recorded in the earthly prisons,
Offenses have reached the ears of Heaven.
We confess our faults and pray for true protection,
Our sincerity reverently directed to the sages.
Devoutly we worship the Three Treasures,
Praying to present our memorial for longevity.
The burning words ascend to the upper realms,
Names presented before the Jade Emperor.

Light three pinches of incense, hold the Mountain Memorial Text, strike the teeth nine times, fumigate the text thrice, then read:

We, the humble Dharma disciple [official title, name, age], born under the governance of [Celestial Emperor], named in the register of [Marchmount], now residing in [prefecture, county, village], respectfully conduct this Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights at [prefecture, county, temple, abode] for the sake of the state, the household, the living and deceased kin, and [specific intention]. The Daoist rites now concluded, we cast this memorial upon the Sacred Mountain. May the divine and immortal ones, the perfected of the Five Marchmounts, most numinous and efficacious, erase our names from the ledgers of sin and inscribe them in the Nine Heavens. We beseech the Sacred Mountain to dispatch a golden dragon courier.

In the reign year [name], the [year] of the [Celestial Stem-Branch], the [month], the [day] of the [lunar phase], the Three Caverns Dharma Master [name], at the [Sacred Mountain Cavern Abode], hereby concludes this proclamation.

All officials bow twice again. The disciples are then instructed to hold the memorial tablet above the incense smoke, while the Dharma Master strikes his teeth nine times and recites the incantation:

"Mystic and luminous, the Primordial Beginning oversees the true.
The Five Elders of the Supreme Emperor, crimson script on vermilion writ.
Heaven and Earth’s origin, governing the Three Luminaries.
Gathering qi to summon the assembly, hastening the ascent of immortals.
The exalted talisman’s decree, proclaimed throughout the ten directions.
Sun, moon, and stars; the Five Marchmounts and sacred peaks.
Above in the heavens, below on the earth, the great spirits of the unseen.
Overseeing life and the Register of Destiny, the Southern Three Gates.
Receive the jade tablet, inscribe names in the cinnabar scroll.
Erase the records of transgression, elevate them as imperial retainers.
So-and-so (name) entrusts himself to the supreme Dao, establishing merit through this retreat.
Redeeming the nine generations of ancestors, all suffering souls.
The Daoist rites now concluded, we respectfully approach the Sacred Mountain.
We beseech the casting of this jade tablet, the erasure of sinful names,
that all may attain liberation, without enmity or kinship.
Departing the Three Evil Realms, souls ascend to the Nine Heavens.
Deliverance in life and death, eternal existence through kalpas.
Today’s supplication is heard by the myriad perfected.
We entreat the dragon tablet to seal the pact with the true officials.
May our plea be conveyed by the golden dragon courier."

As the officials bow twice, all repeat the invocation aloud. The phrase *"golden dragon courier"* and the four-character memorial tablet inscription are each recited three times.

The tablet is made of *hu* wood, twelve inches in length, two inches and four *fen* in width, and two *fen* in thickness. It is bordered in vermilion, divided into five columns: four for the memorial text and one for the date. The text is written meticulously in red, without corrections or emendations.

Each tablet is borne by a dragon, three inches and six *fen* in length. For the Son of Heaven, the dragon is of gold; for dukes and marquises, of secondary gold; for scholars and commoners, silver gilded with gold suffices.

Upon completion of the incantation, the mountain and water tablets are sealed with blue paper, bound with silk, and stamped with the seal of the Nine Elders’ Immortal Capital. The earth tablet is sealed with yellow paper and green thread.

According to ancient ritual, a jade *bi* head is placed within the Dragon-Casting Ceremony, marking the sealed tablet. The Dharma Master respectfully presents it to the designated cavern abode:
- For mountains: *[Name] Mountain Cavern Abode*
- For waters: *[Name] Spring Water Palace*
- For earth: *[Name] Sacred Altar Earth Palace*

The Three Caverns Dharma Master [Name] seals the proclamation.

**Reading of the Water Tablet Proclamation:**
"Now, with reverence, [prefecture, county, village], official so-and-so (name), aged [number], humbly conducts this Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights at [location] for the sake of the state, the household, and all living and deceased kin. We pray for blessings, grace, and the augmentation of fortune and longevity.

The Daoist rites now concluded, we cast this memorial upon the Water Palace. May the divine and immortal ones, the Three Origins in unity, the Water Emperors of the Nine Palaces, the Twelve River Sources, the Jiang, Hai, Huai, and Ji rivers, and the great spirits of the unseen, erase our names from the ledgers of sin and inscribe them in the Nine Heavens. We beseech the Water Palace to dispatch a golden dragon courier.

In the reign year [name], the [year] of the [Celestial Stem-Branch], the [month], the [day], the Three Caverns Dharma Master [name], at the [location] Sacred Spring Water Palace, hereby concludes this proclamation."

The disciples are then instructed to hold the tablet above the incense smoke, while the Dharma Master strikes his teeth twelve times and recites the incantation:

"Primordial Beginning, Five Elders, Supreme Emperor, exalted and revered,
the perfected of the ten directions, the numinous immortals of Mount Taihua,
crimson writ proclaiming the decree—no hidden realm remains unheard.
Ascending the Nine Heavens, we beseech the descent of the jade script.
Sun, moon, and Three Stars; the Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins.
We petition the Five Marchmounts, the sacred peaks of the four directions.
Below, we address the rivers and seas, the Twelve Fountainheads.
The Nine River Water Emperors, the great spirits of the unseen,
today’s supplication is laid bare before the myriad wishes.
The disciples conduct this retreat and perform the Daoist rites for all living and deceased.
We redeem the seven generations of ancestors, severing the roots of past transgressions.
We respectfully cast this jade tablet, beseeching its ascent to the heavens.
Inscribe our names in the Water Palace, that the departed may ascend to the heavens.
Deliverance in life and death, heard by the myriad spirits.
We entreat the dragon tablet to pledge our oath to the Water Emperors.
Grant our plea as proclaimed, conveyed by the golden dragon courier."

All officials bow twice again, and the incantation concludes. The sealing and inscription follow the previous method.

**Reading of the Earth Tablet Proclamation:**
"Now, with reverence, [prefecture, county, village], official so-and-so (name), humbly conducts this Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights at [location] for the sake of the state, the household, and all living and deceased kin. We pray for blessings, grace, and the augmentation of fortune and longevity.

The Daoist rites now concluded, we cast this memorial upon the Sacred Altar. The Yellow Thearch of the Nine Earths, the Yellow Spirits of *wu* and *ji*, the Five Emperors of the Earth Palace—we beseech the erasure of sinful names. We petition the Central Palace to inscribe the tablet in the Great Mystery. With golden clasps and white credentials, we entreat the golden dragon courier.

In the reign year [name], the [month], the [day], the Three Caverns Dharma Master [name], at the [location] Sacred Altar Earth Palace, hereby concludes this proclamation."

The disciples are then instructed to hold the tablet above the incense smoke, while the Dharma Master strikes his teeth twelve times and recites the incantation:

"Heaven and Earth unfold, the myriad qi divide and manifest.
The Three Origins in harmony, the ten directions radiant and clear.
The Five Elder Supreme Emperors, governing death and overseeing life.
Crimson script on vermilion writ, the essence of the Primordial Beginning.
Proclaimed throughout the world, the august spirits of the Nine Earths.
Today’s supplication is heard, the myriad immortals decree life.
The disciples conduct this retreat and perform the Daoist rites for all living and deceased.
Our wishes, our immortals—we beseech the casting of jade names.
The Supreme Thearch of the Earth Palace, erase our sinful names.
Present the tablet to the Upper Palace, inscribe it in the Register of Flourishing Clarity.
Bodies ascend in flight, in unity with the numinous of Heaven and Earth.
The nine generations of kin, though bones decay, are renewed in glory.
Souls ascend to the Southern Palace, transformed in the immortal courts.
Today’s decree is heard by the myriad spirits.
We entreat the golden clasp and white tablet to attest our utmost sincerity.
Grant our plea as proclaimed, conveyed by the golden dragon courier."

All officials bow twice again.

---

**Recitation of the Dragon-Casting Hymn:**
"Praying to the true, ascending the Purple Palace,
proclaiming the decree at the Sacred Altar.
Jade maidens chant in Sanskrit resonance,
golden lads offer incense smoke.
Names inscribed, traversing the Nine Earths,
characters arrayed, ascending the Three Heavens.
Eternal life without end,
attaining the exalted immortality of the highest."

All officials bow twice again.

**Yellow Silk Vermilion Memorial Template**

For the right side, use finely woven yellow silk six *chi* in length, taking half its width. Mark red borders and write in red ink, twenty-four characters per line. On the first line, the name and title are written in secret script, ensuring the final *dunshou* character concludes the line precisely. The two characters for "supplication" occupy the second line alone. "The Supreme Peerless Great Dao" begins the third line. From this point, maintain twenty-four characters per line, ensuring the character for "life" does not appear at the bottom, nor the characters for "death," "ghost," or personal names at the top. Follow the prescribed format strictly.

The undersigned, officiating the Yellow Register Grand Fast ritual, [Title] Master of [Sacred Peak] [Name] Emperor Perfected, your subject [Name], prostrates and bows deeply, respectfully addressing:

**Supplication to the Supreme Peerless Great Dao, the Most True and Spontaneous, beneath the Golden Gates of the Celestial Palace.**

Your subjects, in our ignorance, have presumptuously partaken in the Great Dharma. Our merits are but dust and dew, while our transgressions tower like mountains. Overwhelmed with shame and trepidation, our forms and souls lack truth.

Your subjects bow deeply, bow deeply again. We, indeed humble and insignificant, fortunately rely upon the blessings of the Dao. Gratefully encountering its wondrous transformation, we are filled with boundless joy. Though entrusted with the mysteries of the celestial office and charged with the duty of salvation, our nature remains dull and blind. Yet we pledge our utmost sincerity. We pursue the compassionate breeze and embrace its teachings.

The wondrous teachings—seeing righteousness, we think of courage, day and night dwelling in our hearts. In the karmic conditions we encounter, how dare we fail to make this report?

Now there is a disciple of the Great Dao from [such-and-such] prefecture, county, village, [holding such-and-such] office, named [so-and-so], aged [such-and-such] years, born on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month. We bow our heads, prostrate ourselves, and set forth our words in full.

We have heard that the Supreme Orthodox Dharma of the Yellow Register Great Retreat dissolves the sins of past and present lives—those of body, speech, and mind. Above, it benefits the imperial throne; below, it extends to all beings. It safeguards the nation and pacifies the people, averts calamities and repels harm. It augments blessings and prolongs life, dispels misfortune and dissolves disasters. It delivers the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of forebears, all the departed spirits. It rescues the living and the dead, bestowing universal grace.

Respectfully, we present offerings to the ten directions: golden dragons as tokens of faith, life-thread silks, incense, flowers, oil, and candles—all the requisites of devotion. With sincere hearts, we submit our words for your hearing.

Through our practice of the Dao, we confess and repent, acknowledging the transgressions of past lives. We sever misfortune and deliver the living and the dead. Though our words may falter, the principle remains clear and worthy of presentation.

Respectfully, we lead fellow Daoist priests [so-and-so] and others, numbering [such-and-such], in accordance with the Yellow Register liturgy of the Lower Prime, the sacred statutes of the immortals. At the altar of the mysterious sanctuary in [such-and-such] prefecture, [such-and-such] county, [such-and-such] abbey, we establish the rites of the mysterious canon, modeling heaven and earth. With the golden dragons and silken banners presented, we consecrate the ten directions. We beseech heaven and implore earth, rescuing the living and the dead. Together, we exert ourselves, purifying our hearts and calming our thoughts. Covered in ashes, we prostrate ourselves, surrendering to the Most True, to pray for our wishes.

For [such-and-such] days, [such-and-such] nights, [such-and-such] hours of repentance rites, and [such-and-such] hours of scripture recitation, beginning at dawn on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, we establish the retreat and perform the Dao. This continues until the hour of *hai* on the [such-and-such] day, totaling [such-and-such] hours. Upon the completion of our prayers and the fulfillment of our rites, we respectfully conclude the liturgy and dissolve the altar, casting the dragons into the mountains and waters. With cinnabar writings and talismanic petitions, we submit our words to the sacred altar. Prostrate upon the earth, we present a vermilion memorial on yellow silk, to be heard in the Nine Heavens. We reverently await...

The Most High, Boundless Dao, Original Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Most High Venerable One; the Supreme Mysterious Elder; the Celestial Worthies of the Numinous Treasure, spontaneously arisen in the Ten Directions; the assemblies of Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones; the Supreme Thearchs and Heavenly Thearchs; the Heavenly Master Lords; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center—may the radiant grace of these whom we reverently address incline toward our crimson sincerity.

Should our petition be granted and the imperial decree bestowed, may it be proclaimed to the Five Elder Thearchs of the Ten Directions, the True Immortals of the Five Marchmounts, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the True Spirits of the Ten Realms. May they deliver and ferry across the nine generations and seven ancestors of such-and-such a household, whether bound by affinity or not, whether foe or kin, all equally—every shade and soul in darkness. May they all be enabled to emerge from the eternal night, ascending from the Nine Dark Realms into the Southern Palace. May withered bones be crowned and girded, may decayed remains bloom anew, may the wheel of transmigration be exhausted, and may they be transformed and reborn at the Gate of Blessing. May the local earth spirits guard and protect their forms, and when the spirits return to their former state, may they unite with the light and the unseen.

May all transgressions of such-and-such a disciple’s household, from past lives to this present existence, be eradicated and dissolved, all grievances reconciled. May calamities be averted, disasters dispelled, life prolonged, and destiny preserved. May the living and the dead flourish, and kinfolk dwell in peace.

Above, may the Seven Luminaries shine in full splendor, and the Two Modes endure forever. May yin and yang harmonize, and the nine grains yield abundant harvests. May the nation prosper and the people rejoice, and may all under heaven know great peace. May the Six Directions be purified, and the imperial reign prolonged. May pestilence vanish, and auspicious omens appear daily. May primal felicity be preserved, and the grace of the Dao be eternally cherished.

With reverence, we dispatch the celestial hosts summoned for this ritual fast: the celestial immortals’ legions, the perfected ones’ legions, the divine beings’ legions, the earthly immortals’ legions, the sun and moon’s legions, the stellar constellations’ legions, the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors’ legions, the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ legions, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways’ legions—each numbering nine hundred million myriad cavalry. The overseers of the fast’s affairs, the golden youths attending incense, the jade maidens scattering blossoms, the direct envoys of the Five Emperors, the messengers bearing petitions, the flying dragon couriers.

Within our bodies, the inner and outer true immortals we bear, the officials of the Numinous Treasure, the guardian generals of the palace—along with the local earth gods and territorial deities, the divinities of the Three Realms, all those who supervise, protect, and transmit commands, or who have labored diligently in honoring and safeguarding the fast—are now fully arrayed. Following our petition, they ascend to the Mysterious Capital to receive their due rewards and commendations. We beseech that the true officials be promoted in rank, the highest immortals elevated to imperial titles. According to their grades, let them be appointed to offices, their ranks and stations duly ordered, all exalted and advanced in accordance with the rites of the Great Perfected.

We, whose mastery of the Dao remains incomplete, have acted with humility yet transgressed the proper forms; our conduct has violated the statutes, our actions fallen short of ritual decorum. We fear the censure of the Four Offices and the judgment of the Five Emperors. For our thousand faults and myriad sins, we implore pardon and forgiveness. May our ignorance be met with compassion, our offenses spared from punishment.

Within our bodies, the true officials of the five viscera, having fulfilled their duties, return each to their respective bureaus. May we, through our study, attain the Dao; through our seeking, become immortals, ever to be numbered among the Perfected. May we shine with the radiance of the Three Luminaries and endure with the Five Qi.

We entreat the Most High and the assembled venerables to bestow their mercy and favor. Through the flying immortals and direct envoys of the true officials, the Merit Registrars of the Orthodox Unity, the left and right official messengers, the yin-yang divine decree officers, the chariot officers of the red talismans, the couriers of the fierce winds, the flying dragon couriers, the celestial immortal couriers, and the flying immortal couriers—each twenty-four in number—we now act.

With utmost reverence, we, on behalf of so-and-so, have conducted the Great Yellow Register Fast. The rites now concluded, we dissolve the altar, restore the ranks of heaven, and reaffirm the merit and virtue. We present a petition inscribed on yellow silk in vermilion, to be conveyed to the Most High Court of the Supreme Oneness. We, so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in awe and dread, bowing twice in submission, to make this known.

[Your name], of [your state, county, and abbey], respectfully submits this on the [day] of the [month] in the [year] of the reign [title], when the Celestial Gate opens at [hour], at the altar within [abbey].

All who transcribe this petition must refrain from deletions, emendations, errant characters, interpolations, or defacement. Precision and care are required, for even earthly memorials demand meticulous calligraphy—how much more so those presented to the celestial court?

The vow is sealed, the incense reignited.

Fragrant Bureau Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attending Fragrant Spirits—may the places where we perform the Dao naturally yield golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here, before the incense and flame. May the disciples who observe this fast, whether living or deceased, receive blessings; may their families and nations be graced with favor. May the ten directions’ immortal lads and jade maidens attend the fragrant smoke and swiftly convey all that we have petitioned to the Most True, Boundless, and Great Dao—the Three Clarities’ August Saints and the Jade Emperor’s celestial court.

**Guardian Spirits Invoked**
Mengzhang raises the banner; Lingguang wields the halberd.

Grasp the light to dispel specters.
Huangzhong governs all; Gouchen and Tengshe stand guard.
They stabilize the five directions, sweep away filth, and expel evil.
Golden lads bear incense;
Jade maidens scatter blossoms.
Qi congeals into the sun’s radiance; spirits move the moon’s splendor.
The Numinous Treasure merges all; the ten thousand forms stand in array.
The Flowery Pearl gleams in empty whiteness;
The wondrous Dao towers sublime.
All perfected ones oversee the passage—
This is the realm of immortals.

Next, we offer incense, present the hot water, present the tea, present the wine.
Then, kneeling in reverence, we humbly address:
Your servants respectfully invoke the Ten Directions’ Great Saints, the numinous immortals of Heaven and Earth, the Sovereign Lords of Sun and Moon, the Four Controllers and Five Thearchs, the Three Terraces and Northern Dipper, the true officials of mountains and rivers, the host of numinous treasures, the lords of the Three Offices, and all responsive true spirits within and beyond the Three Realms.
We prostrate ourselves, beseeching your boundless compassion to descend and shine your radiance in witness.

Your servants, inheritors of past blessings, have been born into this present life. We have presumptuously received the sacred texts and followed the teachings of the Mysterious Dao. Our merits are lighter than dust and dew, while our transgressions weigh heavier than mountains. Truly, we should restrain ourselves and cultivate self-discipline. Yet the Dao permits salvation and aids the state in establishing merit. As all who turn their hearts toward it cannot be refused, we now have the Great Dao disciple, the official so-and-so, acting for family and state, presenting his faith and submitting his petition. He requests the establishment of a grand Yellow Register Retreat, lasting so many days and nights, to conclude at the hour of the boar on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month. Through this, he seeks to deliver the souls of the dark night, submit memorials to the highest perfected, dispel calamities and dissolve misfortune, pray for blessings and give thanks for grace. May merit be accomplished and obstacles not arise—all relying upon the ritual register’s clerks and soldiers, the inner and outer officials, the host of perfected saints, and all responsive numinous spirits. By your great favor, may his sincere prayers be answered.

In the course of these invocations and submissions, should we have erred in offerings or violated ritual codes, or in any movement or stillness offended the divine and true, we now seek to repay the grace of your protection and entreat the bestowal of future blessings. Thus, as the rites conclude, we humbly prepare this offering feast, beseeching your majestic presence to deign to accept and receive it.

Your servants and disciples, unable to bear the weight of our reverent hope, prostrate ourselves in awe and trepidation, bowing again in homage.
Next, we offer incense, present the hot water.

Next, we offer tea and present wine. Your servants and disciples once more invoke the host of saints and perfected ones, all the officials and attendants.

We have heard that the Three Clarities’ exalted sages, the Five Venerables, the true numina of Heaven and Earth, and the mysterious directors of fate—
generate and complete the cosmos, nurture the ten thousand spirits.
Their embodiment harmonizes with non-action; their merit precedes the covering and bearing of all things.
Their divine efficacy is unfathomable; their virtue/power shines in both hidden and manifest realms.
They secretly protect the state and silently assist all beings.
No disaster remains unresolved; no peril goes unaverted.
Whatever is petitioned, they surely witness and safeguard.

Disciple So-and-so, turning his heart toward the Ten Poles, bows his head to the host of perfected ones,
beseeching that the merit of this retreat be recorded and the covenant of his devotions be attested.
May the ninefold ancestors and seven generations of this disciple ascend into the Vermilion Mound,
where clothing and sustenance arise spontaneously and he roams carefree through the Azure Empyrean.

May your servants and disciples see all misfortunes and calamities dispersed, all transgressions and burdens dissolved.
May true qi flourish within, and numinous officials guard without.
May their years and life be prolonged, their blessings and protection ever renewed.
In all goings and comings, may divine spirits preserve them.
May the Northern Palace release the dead; may the Southern Dipper raise them to new life.
May the local earth deities constantly provide vigilant protection.

Above, we pray for the emperor’s ten-thousand-year reign, for the flourishing of the altars of soil and grain.
May the realm know great peace, and weapons fall silent.
May the long night of the Nine Dark Realms see all reborn in Heaven.
May every being under the sky together ascend to the realm of longevity.

Your servants, still imperfect in their mastery of the Dao, fear transgressing the mysterious statutes.
We worry that our submissions may not reach, that our prayers may not be heard.
We humbly pray that the blue petitions and vermilion memorials swiftly ascend to the Nine Heavens,
that the true writs and numinous scriptures universally succor the hidden and manifest worlds.
May the mysterious wind spread far and wide, and beneficent blessings descend upon the earth below.
May the unseen and seen alike be graced with glory, and the living and dead alike know prosperity.

The rites of invocation and thanksgiving now complete, may the response be swift.
We, dust-bound and humble, dare not detain you long.
May the celestial perfected of the upper realms together ascend to their palaces.
May the numinous officials of the sacred peaks and rivers return each to their proper office.
May the fivefold bodily true officials revert to their celestial precincts.
We entreat that the grace of your ascent be manifestly bestowed.

Your servants and disciples, unable to bear the weight of our earnest prayers, prostrate ourselves in awe and trepidation, bowing again in homage.

We burn incense and scatter fruit.
We sit in quiet repose and intone the incantation.

The Upper Perfected and Supreme Immortals have now returned to their celestial palaces. The attending officials, the local deities of this realm, the Twelve Hour Spirits, the Twenty-Four Officers, and all the upright gods of front and rear, left and right—let them all come and take their seats. May they partake of the offerings and respond to the sincerity of these rites, each returning to their respective domains. May they extol the transformative power of the Dao and assist in rectifying the upright while repelling evil. For so-and-so, may they dispel misfortune and ward off calamity. On the days of the Three Assemblies, their merits shall be duly reported. Should any transgress, the Orthodox Unity’s great law provides clear penalties.

All gods present, return each to your governance. Should there be further prayers and petitions, they shall be duly announced again.

The disciple bows twice.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Gods**

Vast and formless, the empty void,
Yet deeply moved by heartfelt emotion.
Reverence draws forth Heaven’s grace,
Neglect invites demonic intrusion.
Fortune and misfortune rise with fate’s turning,
Adversity and prosperity arise from karmic conditions.
The Dao does not prize pearls or jade,
The gods respond only to utmost sincerity.
With crimson and azure hues, we toil in earnest,
Pouring forth our deepest devotion.
Naturally, the Great Sage is moved,
And all receive the descent of radiant numina.
Holding incense, we state our wishes,
Bowing in hope of auspicious blessings.
The Heavenly Worthy abides in quiescence,
Turn your hearts to reverence the unseen.

Next, proceed with the hymn of precepts, circling thrice to the position of the Precentor.

**The Heavenly Worthy’s Great Compassion**

The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,
Preaches the precepts to deliver all beings.
Virtue and power extend to the unseen and seen,
Karmic retribution moves the gods.
The hosts of heaven come to bow in homage,
The hordes of demons restrain their forms.
The past transcends the Eight Difficulties,
The present safeguards a thousand years of life.
The merit of the fast now draws to a close,
Together we send forth our devout sincerity.
The flowing Sanskrit chant soars like clouds,
Incense smoke mingles with the sound of voices.
Jade phoenixes bear the cinnabar carriage,
Golden dragons draw the emerald palanquin.
In life and death, all find joy,
Families and nations all know peace.

Next, complete the Three Bows of the precepts.

**The Officials Receive Their Duties**

The High Master, Precentor, Fast Supervisor, Scripture Attendants, Incense Attendants, and Lamp Attendants—each according to their station—proceed in order before the Three Treasures, bow once, and kneel. The tablet is presented to the High Master, who rises, performs the Three Bows, and retires to stand in their respective positions. The High Master rises, bows thrice, and returns to their place.

**The Vows**

First, may Heaven and Earth shine in purity;
Second, may the cosmos be clear and mysterious;
Third, may the sagely ruler enjoy myriad years;
Fourth, may transformation reach the Eight Limits;
Fifth, may Heaven bestow sweet dew;
Sixth, may Earth emit auspicious mist;
Seventh, may the four seasons follow their course;
Eighth, may the myriad things flourish in wholeness;
Ninth, may families abound in filial piety and fraternal duty;
Tenth, may the nation flourish with talent and wisdom;
Eleventh, may the merit of this fast spread widely;
Twelfth, may good omens daily increase.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**

Incense Officials and Envoys, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit officials—let them now, at the place where the memorial is presented, naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and jade herbs. May the hosts of a hundred spirits and all the Perfected gather here before the incense burner. May the living and the dead receive blessings, and may families and nations be graced with favor.

The jade maidens and immortal youths of the Ten Directions, who attend the incense smoke, transmit the petitions we have just presented, directly reaching the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.

**Eight Hymns on the Three Paths and Five Sufferings**
*(Circumambulate thrice, as in the Step-in-Void method)*

The Three Powers and the myriad things,
Each relies on the other, each has its spirit.
From beginning to end through the great kalpas,
When fortune is exhausted, Heaven and Earth collapse.
Passing through the Five Paths,
How bitter to die and be reborn again!
Revolving in the Three Realms,
Coming and going with calamity.
Great sages heed this warning,
Enduring the world, severing attachments.
Fools do not believe the Dharma,
Their sins and pains ever cling to them.
I grieve that the world knows no end,
And so I proclaim this anew:
If you wish to escape this suffering,
Take refuge in the Most High’s scriptures.
Sin and fortune do not come from others,
They truly arise from yourself.
Great sages thus seal their lips,
Seeking to extinguish the roots of evil.
Extinguishing thoughts, forgetting all,
They await the great dissolution.
Expounding the Dao to pacify the world,
They will ultimately behold the True.
Lust and jealousy are the chief of misfortunes,
The greatest perils to body and life.
Covetousness and indulgence bring such calamity,
Surely leading to early death.
Knowing evil yet not reforming,
How can this be the Dao’s peace?
Harboring malice while feigning uprightness,
Makes me sigh deeply.
The certainty of past lives is evident,
Yet the weak and dying call it false.
All wish to see it before their eyes,
But when it passes, they dismiss it as fleeting.
Great sages, enlightened by the Dao’s teachings,
Grieve for the stubborn fools.
Tenderly mindful of their suffering,
Earnestly, they cause me concern.
Human life is already spent,
Like a flame in a lamp’s oil.
The Four Great Elements temporarily dwell together,
The Five Aggregates are but provisional.
In the prime of life, one should study diligently,
Seeking to preserve one’s self.
When fortune is exhausted, the body and spirit scatter,
Plunging into the dark hells below.
The Upper Sages fear this,
And so they seek the Dao to escape this suffering.
Learning immortality is urgent,
Upholding precepts to restrain the heart.
When the void and the upright qi reside,
Immortals and sages naturally come.
If you do not believe the Dharma’s words,
Why dwell in the mountains and forests?
Great sages delight in the scriptures and precepts,
Receiving them as treasures for the body.
To study is always bitterly late,
To cultivate the body, one regrets not starting sooner.
By the time one grasps the profound,
In a flash, the years have grown old.
Holding the scroll, chanting to the utmost,
One faces death with pain and sorrow.
Thus, in my youth, I abandoned the world
To study the Dao.

**Hymn for Dismissing the Altar**

The vast emptiness embraces all forms,
The Utmost Dao is profoundly formless.
Harmony conveys the wondrous qi,
Response and feeling reach the heart’s sincerity.
In an instant, it pervades the Eight Extremes,
Relying on its radiance, it descends with the myriad spirits.
Subtle incense presents our pure devotion,
Offering our substance to express our cinnabar sincerity.
From afar, we soar beneath the phoenix canopy,
From afar, we grasp the brocade banner of the phoenix.
The smoke officials stand tall and lush,
The cloud pavilions rise high and majestic.
The jade carriage emerges from the heavens,
The golden dragon enters the Great Purity.
Sweet dew bathes the human world,
Families and nations all know peace.

**Exiting the Altar**

The *Huaxia Hymn* is chanted, leading to the Three Masters’ positions, where all take their places and offer incense.

**Hymn for Taking Leave of the Three Masters**
*(If the Three Masters’ positions are not set, then send them off at the Heavenly Gate.)*

The fast now complete, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious grace.
Bowing in homage, we take leave of the Scripture Master.
The scriptures and Dharma follow the profound and wondrous,
Their reverence all depends on the Master.
All who wish to establish goodness,
Must pay homage and make vows.
With focused qi, merit is easily achieved,
With a careless heart, regrets are hard to undo.

The incense is replenished in the burner.

If one can diligently maintain mindfulness,
Morning and evening, one soars as an immortal.
The fast now complete, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious grace.
Bowing in homage, we take leave of the Register Master.

The Dao holds fasting as paramount,
The Dharma regards audience as constant.
Those who do not revere nor believe,
How can they wander to the Emperor’s realm?
With the right bones, one enters the immortal ranks,
Naturally opening the purple chambers.
The Mysterious Woman ascends the cloud terrace,
Beholding only halls of gold and silver.
Thus we bid farewell to the Three Masters,
Bowing in homage to the August Void.

The fast now complete, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious grace.
Bowing in homage, we take leave of the Ordination Master.

The towering Jade Capital Mountain,
How majestic is the Mysterious Metropolis!
The Perfected walk upon the void,
Brightly dispelling the long night.
The Great Dao is magnified by human effort,
With sincerity of heart, the spirits naturally return.
The fast and Daoist practices now concluded,
We bow and take leave of the Three Masters.

The cloud chariot does not tarry,
The crane carriage cannot be detained.
When next we hold a fast,
We shall once more extend our invitation.

**Dedication**
The merits of the rites just performed
Are first dedicated to the Emperor,
Then to all sentient beings.
Together we rely on the mysterious power,
To accomplish the supreme Dao.

Next, before the Mysterious Master,
We confess our faults and complete the rites.
The disciples offer incense in gratitude,
Bowing to the Central Dharma Master of the Mysterious.
The Six Offices concluded, the *Dujang* and those below
Express thanks to the Dharma Master,
Each performing their obeisance,
As in the rites of the Opening Fast night.
The dispersal follows the usual protocol.

*The Fifty-First Scroll of the* **Yellow Register Fast Rites of the Most High** *concludes.*

*The Fifty-Second Scroll of the* **Yellow Register Fast Rites of the Most High**
*Revised by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting*

**Fangchan for Deliverance from Suffering and Salvation** *(Eastern Direction)*

We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response and Salvation from Suffering of the Eastern Direction, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm.
Thrice we bow in reverence, each with utmost devotion, repenting and offering thanks.

We, your servants, have heard: in the primordial vastness of the singular qi, the Two Modes unfolded. The mystic winds stirred and forged, and the radiant sun first dawned to illumine all. The azure seas lie limpid and deep, the verdant forests lush and dense.

Now, the chief patron of this grand Yellow Register Fast, so-and-so, moved by benevolence and compassion, has raised this intent to succor all beings. We grieve for the souls adrift and long confined, imprisoned in the dungeons of wind and thunder. For ages untold, their trials have endured, their judgments yet unresolved. With reverence, we perform this grand Yellow Register Fast, respectfully presenting green-woven silks and vibrant banners, taking refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Direction, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm.

We humbly beseech the numinous might of the Azure Emperor and the Perfected One of Salvation from Suffering: deliver them from the profound calamities of the ten thousand valleys, bestow the wondrous bliss of the Three Clarities. May they forever depart from all suffering and be reborn in the celestial realms. May the nation and its people enjoy peace, the living and the departed share in blessings and prosperity. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.

**Southern Direction**
We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response and Salvation from Suffering of the Southern Direction, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Southern Realm.
Thrice we bow in reverence, each with utmost devotion, repenting and offering thanks.

We, your humble servants, have heard that the Three Qi manifest in bodily form, and the Five Spirits divide and transform. The cinnabar tablets inscribe the register of those born above, while the Fiery Continent abides as the land of immortality. Radiant as the sun at its zenith, the Star of Longevity shines with resplendent light.

*Beginning the Fifty-Second Scroll of the* Great Register Fast Rites of the Most High.
*Edited by Master Du Guangting of Tang Guangcheng.*

**Scripture Recitation**
In performing the various fasts of the Numinous Treasure of the Great Register, one circumambulates the Dao thrice daily and recites scriptures thrice, totaling six times day and night, to present petitions and prayers for the disciples’ blessings. After the circumambulation, one may rest briefly before ascending the altar separately to recite scriptures and praise the Dao, with the ritual proceedings following the *Golden Register* model.

Upon ascending the altar, the master dons the cap of the Primordial Beginning, a yellow skirt with a purple robe, and a five-colored cloud-and-rosy-light mantle—this is called the ritual vestment. The assembled officials wear their usual attire. The officials stand in order before the master.

The *zhiqing* intones the Dao.
All in the ritual arena, each with concentrated mind, take refuge in the Three Treasures, extinguishing all thoughts.
Entering the chamber,
Approaching the imperial table to offer incense.

Upon offering incense, recite the esoteric incantation:
Jade radiance scatters light, ninefold qi congeals as mist.
Fragrant clouds densely woven, piercing straight to the Nine Heavens.
The Golden Lad attendant of incense, the Jade Maiden transmitter of words—
What this servant petitions, heard before the Celestial Emperor.
What this servant entreats, all granted as spoken.

Today’s purificatory fast proclaimed, the hosts of heaven descend to the hall.
The Three Realms’ Five Emperors, in ranks, ascend to the Upper Clarity.
Holding registers and grasping ledgers, all arrive before the Emperor.

May all beings open their minds to awakening, receiving, upholding, and reciting.
With wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Master-Treasure of the ten directions.
May all beings universally ascend the Dharma-bridge, without hindrance.

The assembly in the ritual arena, holding tablets and concentrating the mind, sit upright in proper form.
The officials, each in their place, sit upright.
Chant praises in proper form.

**Eulogy of Past Lives**
While awaiting the procession of scriptures and the offering of water, the attendant of incense performs the incense rite.
Past lives truly exist, yet the foolish call them nonexistent.
All wish to see with their own eyes, dismissing what passes beyond sight as distant.
The great sages illuminate the Dao’s teachings, grieving for the benighted.
Tenderly they recall the suffering of children, earnestly they cause me sorrow.

**Silent Contemplation in Proper Form**
The master, following proper form, closes the eyes and engages in visualization, naturally proceeding with the scriptures.

When reciting the *Scriptures of Numinous Treasure*, the master should visualize the self seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi.
To the left, the Azure Dragon; to the right, the White Tiger; before, the Vermilion Bird; behind, the Dark Warrior.
The sun, moon, and five planets illuminate the surroundings.
Attendant immortals of the scriptures array themselves within the altar.
A circular radiance, like the sun’s image, appears.
Upon completion, swallow saliva three times, knock the teeth three times, and recite the esoteric incantation:
Silent, silent, to the ultimate source,
Vastly towering, kalpas high, Ah!
Profound and open, the scripture of cavernous mystery—
Who can fathom this depth and distance?
Once entering the Great Vehicle’s path,
Who reckons the kalpas’ multitude?
Neither born nor extinguished,
To be born arises from the lotus.
Surpassing the denizens of the Three Realms,
With compassionate heart, liberating from the world’s snare.
The Perfected One of unsurpassed virtue,
Lifetimes evermore as an immortal family.

When reciting the *Scriptures of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the master should visualize the Most High Lord Lao, the Great Master of the Mysterious Center, Perfected Master Yin, and Perfected Master He of the Riverside.
Upon completion, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times.
First visualize the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird before, the Dark Warrior behind, and the Eight Trigrams tortoise beneath the feet.
Thirty-six lions crouch before the head.
The Seven Stars of the Dipper in the center.
The five viscera generate five qi in spiral patterns, covering the body.
The Three Ones attend the scriptures, each with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders.
Heaven and earth each have eighteen thousand jade maidens and jade lads guarding them.
Recite the esoteric incantation:
Mysterious, mysterious, the ultimate source of the Dao,
The virtue of the highest embodies the primordial vastness.
Though the celestial perfected are distant and wondrous,
They draw near through the Lord of Mud-Pellet Palace.
Palaces and chambers all of seven treasures,
Windows and doors naturally apportioned.
Ever pure and rightly real,
Riding the light, ascending on purple clouds.
Sun and moon illuminate left and right,
Ascending as immortals, preserving eternal years.
Seven ancestors born in the heavens above,
Lifetimes evermore in the gate of Dao and virtue.

When reciting the *Scripture of Salvation*, the master faces east, knocks the teeth thirty-two times to be heard in the thirty-two heavens, and bows in the heart thirty-two times.
Closing the eyes in silent contemplation, visualize the self seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, the interior and exterior dimly suffused.
The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, lions, and white cranes array themselves to the left and right.
Sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber’s interior.

The nape swells with a spherical radiance, its light illuminating the ten directions.
Thus clearly visualized, the secret incantation declares:
*"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three-and-Five Merit Officers, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two of each."*
Unseal and proclaim these words: today is an auspicious celebration, a hall of purity and fasting, where the scripture of boundless salvation is cultivated.
May this servant and those of the cyclical signs, through the recitation of the scripture, receive rebirth.
May these petitions ascend directly to the august presence of the Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens’ Primordial Thearch.
Inhale qi thirty-two times, then face east to recite the scripture.
When reciting the *Upper Clarity* and *Cavern Spirits* scriptures, follow their respective methods: visualize, intone the incantations, and invoke the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.

**Invocation to Open the Scripture**
Bow to the Heavenly Worthy before the Void and Sovereign.

**Request to Recite the Precious Scripture**
Recite the multitude of scriptures.

**Hymn to Conclude the Recitation**
Vast and mysterious, profoundly mysterious.

**Hymn to Rise from the Seat**
For all who have come, create good karmic conditions.
If enlightenment is granted, reverently bear the profound grace.

**The Assembly Rises**
The merit of reciting the scriptures, excerpted from the *Three Caverns’ Regulations*:

Now, the treasured scriptures of the Three Caverns are the supreme models of the myriad heavens.
They weave the qi of soaring mystery into chapters of cloud-script,
their meaning surpassing the unborn, their text enduring through eternal kalpas.
Thus, heaven and earth rely upon them to divide and order,
the sun and moon depend upon them to revolve.
Ghosts and spirits revere them for their transformative power,
humanity upholds them for their liberating guidance.
Those who chant them ascend in form to the crimson clouds;
those who hear them are spiritually reborn in the azure firmament.
None—whether of heaven or humanity, the living or the dead—do not look to them in reliance.
They are the bridge for all beings, the gateway for the host of perfected.

Yet what cannot be spoken of in words is the profound treasury of the Great Vehicle.
There is a great Dao disciple, so-and-so, who, for state and family, delivers and uplifts the living and the dead.
Following the *Numinous Treasure’s* concise texts and examining the ranks of immortals,
he presents patterned silks as tokens of sincerity, along with oil lamps, candles, incense, and flowers.
He performs the grand *Yellow Register* fast for so many days and nights,
circulating the Dao nine times and reciting the scriptures nine times.
When he opens the scroll to expound its mysteries, his voice resounds through the Three Clarities;
when he holds the text to chant its profundities, his sound is heard by five hundred million.

May the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads inscribe fragrant characters in the heavens;
may the Scripture-Keeping Jade Youths present the scriptural texts upon the tablets.
Thus, past transgressions dissolve, and blessings descend upon this very day.
The living and the dead receive the grace of flourishing peace,
while all beings—moving and still—rejoice in the virtue of growth and completion.
Extending to the teeming multitudes and the humblest of creatures,
may all together board the boat of the Six Perfections and reach the shore of the Three Clarities.

**Three Recitations of the Scripture**
After hearing the scripture, may all beings’ myriad sins be extinguished and the sprouts of goodness grow.
After hearing the scripture, may all beings deeply enter the Dharma gate, take refuge, and accept it in faith.
After hearing the scripture, may all beings forever sever delusion and constantly return to the true Dao.

**Circumambulation**
Recite the *Hymns to the Seven Perfected*—three or five verses—following the *Step of the Void* method.
Excerpted from the *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain.*

The Dharma Master strikes his teeth, as the Sovereign resides in the Golden Flower Palace, like an infant in form.
The Supreme Mystery of the Void is the school; the Dao is magnified in its scriptures.
Bowing and rising, one has already attained immortality, enduring kalpas without number.
Majestic is the virtue of the Great Perfected; serene is the cause of non-arising.
Celestial radiance weaves empty structures, riding the void in natural ascent.
Sun and moon blaze forth, peace and harmony endure without end.
In learning immortality, cast aside ornate thoughts; thought upon thought accumulates in succession.
Coming and going disturb my spirit; when the spirit is restless, nothing endures.
Extinguish thoughts and rest in empty stillness; softly enter the silence of the void.
Request the scriptures as if parched with thirst; hold fast to your resolve like metal and stone.
Preserve the child and ascend the mysterious path; the Five Numinous Ones transmit the registers of passage.
Cross me through the practice of the Six Perfections, thus able to unbind the Three Nets.
Purify the fast and worship the Primordial Simplicity; exhale and inhale to nurture the cloud-teeth.
Roam within the Golden Gates; the Jade Capital is my home.
Naturally, the Seven Treasures arise; each person sits upon a lotus.
Above, chew the fruits of the Mystic Capital; below, drink deeply of the melons of the Empty Cavern.
The countenance shines like ten suns; why reckon the multitude of kalpas?
The Dharma drum assembles the celestial immortals; the ringing bell summons the great demons.
A numinous wind fans the fragrant blossoms; resplendent, they unfold the brocade robes.
The Great Perfected plucks the cloud zither; the assembled immortals strum the divine harps.
Elegant songs of the Three Heavens scatter wisdom through the Jade Flower Forest.
The seven ancestors ascend the Hall of Blessings, thereby treading the mysterious tones.
If the blessings of past lives were insufficient, this scripture would remain distant and hard to find.
If faith in the Dao is not wholehearted, the attempt to soar will instead sink.
The Dao of the Supreme is non-action; its magnification lies in the hearts of all beings.
Learning the Dao depends on sincere faith; serve the master as if they were your closest kin.
Draw in the radiance and match the pure void; diligently follow the daily renewal.
Until all people are delivered, I will not deliver myself.
Great vows demand profound recompense; the mysterious virtue must surely be trusted.
Hidden evils and sins run deep; when faced, they turn like a wheel.
Learning the Dao is also arduous; day and night, cultivate the field of blessings.
Planting virtue is like planting a tree; heaping baskets of earth makes a mountain.
If you can delight in the mysterious and esteem it, you will lightly ascend the azure heavens.
Cultivate this Dao of non-action, and you will form bonds with goodness.
The Supreme’s most recondite scripture is called the *Chapter of Wisdom*.
Relief from suffering comes through great talent; transcendence of the worldly comes through true virtue.
The numinous countenance is rare in the world, gleaming like a lotus in the depths.
Each person’s conduct has its root, all stemming from the merit of past lives.
Establish virtue while there is time; make vows, and none will go unanswered.
Good and evil both await their response; the principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.
The worthy uphold the Dharma’s words; the Dao also lies in forgetting both.
To comprehend this is great wisdom, to become a Lord of the Supreme Ultimate.
The jeweled canopy connects to the jade chariot; the command is given to ride the nine dragons.
The Golden Flower holds aloft the *Cavern Scripture*; the immortal youths all bear incense.
Whistling and singing resound through the Mystic Capital; jade chimes strike the jasper bells.
The body rises to the Supreme Clarity, transcending radiance to roam the Purple Empyrean.
Uphold the Dharma’s net and wander the ultimate mystery in freedom.
Ten thousand kalpas are like last night; a thousand springs are like the morning dawn.
Towering, it shades the cloud blossoms; hands grasp the branches of the Treasure Grove.
Fragrant smoke arises naturally; the mysterious steps ascend in a whirlwind.
The numinous banners disperse with the wind; manifold thoughts dissolve in their time.
Extinguish wisdom to magnify the great unity; non-action becomes the pure chant.

All the above is the same as the *Ritual of the Golden Register*.

**Hymn to the Student of Immortality**
Learning immortality is urgent; uphold the precepts to restrain the heart’s passions.
In emptiness and equanimity, the correct qi resides; immortals and sages naturally seek one another.
If you do not believe the Dharma’s words, why dwell in the mountain forests?

**Dedication Hymn**
Before the Mystic Master, scatter offerings as in the usual ritual.

The Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate said: These eight true hymns are the words of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected of the Supreme.
The assembled immortals constantly delight in reciting them; they are not to be divulged to lesser immortals.
Secretly hidden within the Golden Gates and Jade Chambers, they are fitting to transmit to those who cultivate the *Numinous Treasure Retreat*.
They must not be shown to frivolous and ostentatious people. Be cautious, be cautious.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected said: The jade maidens and immortal youths who attend the scriptures, upon hearing these sounds of ritual, hymns, and praises, all rejoice and protect the practitioner’s body.
This great scripture should always be used with these hymns in worship.
Even those who silently recite the scriptures should chant them in their hearts.
These are the secret words of the highest immortals, the wondrous sounds of the cultivators of truth.

From the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Mystic Capital Jade Capital Mountain*, Chapter Three.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The scriptures are my legacy, guiding the foolish and deluded, able to awaken the boundless Dao-mind in all beings.
Intention arises from awakening; through awakening, one becomes true.
All sages in their cultivation ascend to the Dao’s fruit.
Thus, the Primordial Beginning, with one qi, generated and transformed the three qi, dividing them into the Three Heavens.
The first is the Primordial Qi, forming the Clear and Subtle Heaven, called the Jade Clarity Realm, where the Heavenly Treasure Lord manifests.
At the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, I was called the Formless Heavenly Worthy. In this heaven, I revealed the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern-Truth Treasure Scriptures* to teach the nine sages of the heavens.
Alternatively called the *Scripture of the Myriad Heavens’ Mystic Master, Supreme Dharma King*, spanning ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion myriad kalpas.
The second is the Original Qi, forming the Yu Yu Heaven, called the Supreme Clarity Realm, where the Numinous Treasure Lord manifests.
At the beginning of the Yan Kang kalpa, I was called the Nameless Heavenly Worthy. In this heaven, I revealed the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern-Mystery Numinous Treasure True Scriptures* to teach the nine perfected ones of the heavens.
Alternatively called the *Scripture of the Three Realms’ Healing King, Supreme True Worthy*, spanning eighty-eight thousand eight hundred eighty-eight billion myriad kalpas.
The third is the Mysterious Qi, forming the Great Red Heaven, called the Supreme Purity Realm, where the Divine Treasure Lord manifests.
At the beginning of the Red Bright kalpa, I was called the Brahma-Form Heavenly Worthy, also known as the Perfected One Who Observes the World. I revealed the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern-Spirit Treasure Scriptures* to teach the nine immortals of the heavens.
Alternatively called the *Scripture of the Ten Directions’ Guide, Supreme Heavenly Worthy*, spanning seventy-seven thousand seven hundred seventy-seven billion myriad kalpas.
At the Kai Huang era, I was renamed the Void Sovereign.
In the Palace of the Primordial Yang, I expounded the Three Caverns, descending to transform the human realm as the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao Lord, spanning sixty-six thousand six hundred sixty-six billion myriad kalpas.
By the time of the Supreme August, I was called the Primordial Beginning, governing from the Purple Tenuity Palace. I broadly disseminated the scriptures and precepts to save and deliver all beings.

The Three Caverns’ Treasure Scriptures comprise thirty-six divisions, also termed the Three Vehicles. The *Cavern-Real Treasure Scriptures* are called the Great Vehicle; the *Cavern-Mystery Treasure Scriptures*, the Middle Vehicle; and the *Cavern-Spirit Treasure Scriptures*, the Lesser Vehicle. They are bound by the soaring qi of the Mysterious, naturally forming their chapters—jade characters in gold script, dragon patterns in phoenix seal-script. Their great expanse spans one zhang, with eight corners radiating brilliance. They teach and transform the heavens, circulating throughout the world. From beginning to end, through kalpas unending, they perpetually turn the Wheel of the Dao. Some are true, some expedient; some broad, some concise. Adapting to the faculties of beings, they guide cultivation in accord with the age. Though heaven and earth may end their course, the Three Caverns shall never perish. They open the path for all ranks, guiding humans and celestials alike. The Three Realms and Ten Directions all receive their benefit.

At the dawn of each kalpa, the *Cavern-Real* descends to transform the world. People embrace virtue and power, dwelling together in non-action. All uphold the Orthodox and Real, attaining long life and the Dao. Next, the *Cavern-Mystery* descends, and humanity gradually drifts apart. Simplicity scatters, purity thins, and the Dao is lost while virtue is betrayed. Finally, the *Cavern-Spirit* descends, and humanity grows ever more frivolous and insubstantial. They no longer uphold the Orthodox and Real, and their years and lives grow short. From this point onward, the human heart decays. The Three Caverns cease to circulate, and worldly wisdom flourishes day by day. Humans and spirits intermingle, and the kalpa’s span hastens toward its end. Before a hundred years pass, impermanence reigns in every thought. Death follows without cease. Thus, I re-emerge to proclaim and propagate the Three Caverns, disseminating their teachings among humankind. Adapting to the capacities of each age, I expound the scriptures—sometimes great, sometimes small—suited to the needs of beings.

Thus, the original texts of the Primordial Beginning were not fully transmitted below. In the Three Clarities’ upper realms and the Four Brahmā Heavens, the perfected and sages cultivate the Dao, and their texts are complete. Though mountains, rivers, grotto-palaces, seas, and peaks may have their own practices, these are not fully comprehensive. For the scriptures cultivated in each region, the Three Caverns cannot be entirely complete. Therefore, I commanded Laozi to incarnate in the human realm, to save and deliver all beings, and to expound the precepts and regulations. Whether among the Yi or the Xia, whether sage or commoner, throughout the Ten Directions, all are enabled to attain liberation. The wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns is scattered among humankind. I exhort all men and women to diligently cultivate and practice.

Ordinary beings accumulate sins, their karma weighing them down in delusion. Having no affinity with the Dao, they cannot believe or uphold it. They follow only false teachings, worshipping various heterodox spirits, vainly exhausting body and mind, only to descend into hell in the end. Those who believe and practice the Three Caverns all enter the Hall of Blessings. Some ascend in broad daylight, others attain liberation through corpse-transformation, concealing their traces in grotto-palaces and roaming the world. They attain long life, change their names, and endure through kalpas without end. Refining qi and transforming form, they turn spirit to enter the Dao. None can recognize them—their number is boundless.

After my passing, demonic teachings will flourish. The world will uniformly follow them, and people will die young. War, flood, fire, disease, and injury will bring death and harm. Nations will fall, families will perish, and these calamities will follow one after another from dawn to dusk. Treasuries will be exhausted to serve demons and heresies. Falsehood and disorder will daily increase, and the age’s frivolity will spread like a fan. Hunger, cold, and suffering will afflict all, fathers and sons will be scattered and displaced. The world will grow ever more foolish, never to awaken.

I pity you, who have sunk through kalpas uncounted. Thus, I speak these essential words to enlighten the deaf and blind. Yet the wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns comprises two kinds: the first is the True Dharma, the second the Transformative Dharma. The True Dharma transcends all falsity and endures through kalpas without end. The Transformative Dharma, conveyed through written words, changes and perishes with the times.

Within the Transformative Dharma, there are five varieties:
1. The soaring qi of the Mysterious coalesces into cloud-seal script, forming chapters naturally. Their transformations are unfathomable, appearing and vanishing unpredictably. They abide in the upper realms of the Three Clarities, eternally guarding the scriptures. Through kalpas uncounted, they endure, protected by sages and perfected beings.
2. The numinous script spans one zhang, its eight corners radiant. Throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions, in the heavens’ five hundred million realms, they rise and fall with the kalpas, circulating in response to karmic conditions.
3. In the palaces, towers, pavilions, and chambers of the heavens, between gates and doorways, they are inscribed and chanted. They subdue beings and guide their entry and exit in cultivation.
4. Flower-patterned characters and leaf-script, jade tablets and jasper-bound volumes. On the square zhang of Penglai, in the Langfeng and Mysterious Garden, they appear and vanish unpredictably, enduring or perishing with the kalpas. They teach and train immortals, subduing demonic spirits.
5. Written on paper, silk, bamboo, wood, and lacquer, they circulate among humankind, transmitted and chanted. At the kalpa’s dawn, they descend; at its end, they ascend. They protect nations, pacify people, and liberate all ranks.

The scriptures are the words of the Primordial Beginning, teaching and transforming all beings. They enable recognition of the root and origin, past-life karmic conditions, the retribution of sins and blessings, the auspices of good and evil. They reveal the gateways of birth and transformation, the sources of expedient means. Now, turn from evil and follow goodness, preserving and pacifying your nature and life. Attain long life and non-action, returning to the Dao. This is the eternal model. Those who preserve it receive blessings; those who cultivate it become immortals.

From the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Karmic Conditions*.

The Supreme Dao Lord addressed the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master, saying: The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings and precepts, the wondrous texts of the Three Caverns—celestial script in jade characters, cloud-seal and dragon-patterned chapters—though boundless, can be summarized and categorized. Though divided into twelve divisions by type, they adapt to differing faculties. They are:
1. Natural Original Texts
2. Divine Talismans
3. Treasure Instructions
4. Numinous Diagrams
5. Registers and Genealogies
6. Precepts and Vinaya
7. Ritual Propriety
8. Methods and Techniques
9. Arts and Calculations
10. Biographies and Records
11. Hymns and Eulogies
12. Memorials and Petitions

The Natural Original Texts—celestial script in the Eight Assemblies, phoenix-seal and dragon-patterned chapters—are the root of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. They transform humans and spirits, establishing all Dharmas. They summon the Nine Heavens, the immortals, and the Celestial Thearchs. They verify and rectify registers and diagrams, adjusting the turning of the celestial sphere. They subdue Fengdu, vanquish demons, and subjugate spirits. They command the Water Thearch, summon dragons to ascend the clouds. They govern the kalpic cycles of heaven and earth, the names and titles of sages and perfected beings. They oversee the terraces and cities, the realms of the host of perfected.

Expounding and distinguishing them in full, each with its descending gradations.

The arts of preserving primordial essence and transforming the form.

Divine talismans are the scripts of cloud-seal, the pledges of the divine perfected. They summon and restrain the host of demons, overawing and controlling gods and ghosts. They govern the primordial and command the movements of fate, preserving life and prolonging the years.

Jade formulas are the true sounds by which the celestial perfected and upper sages expound and interpret the celestial script of the Eight Assemblies, revealing the Great Dao.

Sacred diagrams are the transformative traces of the host of sages, manifesting without fixed form. Their depicted transformations and adaptations enable comprehensive understanding.

Genealogies and registers record the names and titles of the immortal perfected, tracing ancestral lineages and the positions of the divine palaces.

Precepts and regulations are the injunctions and covenants that prevent wrongdoing and examine transgressions. They weigh and measure sin and fortune, distinguishing between light and heavy.

Ritual decorum demonstrates the standards of fasting and purification, the models for advancing and retiring. They regulate the rhythms of bowing and rising, the norms for posture and bearing.

Methods comprise the writings of the host of sages—esoteric essentials of elixirs and medicines, divine herbs and sacred fungi, the arts of refining gold, water, and jade for cultivation.

Numerology and calculations clarify and discern the spirit, preserving the true and contemplating the Dao. Through fasting of the heart and sitting in forgetfulness, one roams the void and strides through the air. Ingesting the six qi and guiding the three luminaries, refining the substance and transforming the form, they are the methods of immortal transcendence.

Biographies and records are the accounts of the host of sages, documenting their studies. Attaining the Dao and achieving perfection, penetrating the mysterious and entering the wondrous, they detail the places of cultivation and the times of fruition.

Hymns and eulogies are the artfully adorned dharma-words of the host of perfected and great sages. Extolling the true Dao, they inspire universal faith and joy, arousing dedication and fostering reverence.

Memorials and petitions are the wondrous treasures and marvelous texts transmitted between master and disciple. Ascending the altar to make vows, initiating transmission and ordination, repenting and seeking blessings, they are the words of declaration and announcement.

These twelve matters comprehensively govern all dharmas. Every intention and purpose is fully encompassed within them. They transform and guide the Three Vehicles, leading into the One Vehicle Dao.

From the Three Antiquities onward, down to the Great Tang, precious scrolls and divine texts have appeared and vanished, sometimes emerging in historical records, sometimes recorded in separate biographies. During the Song dynasty, Master Jianji, in the course of collating and comparing, compiled the *Pearl-Bag Scripture Catalogue*, totaling 18,000 scrolls. Thereafter, amidst the wars in Jiangbiao and the military upheavals in Qinzhong, many true scriptures and secret texts were scattered and lost. Emperor Wu of the Later Zhou established the Abbey of Penetrating the Mysterious, where he collected the remaining scriptures, still numbering ten thousand scrolls. Following the conflagration of the Sui and the rise of the Tang, the imperial house flourished.

Dispelling malevolent influences and sweeping away demonic disturbances, the realm was brought to tranquility. By the years of the Kaiyuan era, scriptures and their oral transmissions began to flourish anew. Emperor Xuanzong compiled the *Celestial Net Scripture Catalogue*, totaling 7,300 scrolls. Additionally, there was the *Jade Latitude Supplementary Catalogue*, which recorded commentaries, treatises, and discourses, together amounting to over 9,000 scrolls. Soon after, the two Hu peoples invaded and disrupted the Central Kingdom, and the true teachings declined. The secret repositories of the two capitals were largely consumed by flames. In the first year of the Shangyuan era, the collected scriptures and registers numbered over 6,000 scrolls. By the Dali era, Master Shenfu, scouring the realm for texts and transcribing them in the capital, amassed another 7,000 scrolls. After the Changqing era and into the Xiantong period, the two streets’ transcriptions barely reached 5,300 scrolls. Recently, as great bandits violated the land and the imperial carriage fled south, the two capitals were shrouded in smoke and ash, the six directions overgrown with brambles. The true palaces and Daoist abbeys everywhere fell into ruin, and the jade-bound scriptures and jasper cases were reduced to less than a third. Amidst these dire times, I drifted to Chengdu. Though I followed the imperial retinue in selecting a new capital, my stay was brief. Again, I sought to gather texts, enduring hardships in the process. The old and new scriptures and edicts barely numbered 3,000 scrolls, yet remained uncollated. Soon after, as the court toured the provinces, the acquired scriptures were once more lost. Returning to the Three Shu regions, I wished to resume my search, but the successive military campaigns of my ancestors thwarted my earlier aspirations. Now, in the second year of the Dashun era, the eighth month, the third day of the gengchen cycle, at the Jade Bureau of Transformation in Chengdu, reviewing and examining the regulations and teachings, I set down these brief notes.

*Concluding the Fifty-Second Scroll of the* Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites
*Beginning the Fifty-Third Scroll of the* Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites

Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting, abridged:

The scriptures and regulations all state: among the officiants of the retreat, the one of highest moral stature is designated as the *Fashi* (Dharma Master). The one well-versed in the rites and regulations serves as *Dujian* (Chief Lector).

The *Dujian*’s official liturgical text further states: first sound the Dharma drum, then lead the assembly of companions. Let conduct follow proper form, and reverence rely upon the recitations. This—reciting, chanting, and guiding—constitutes the *Dujian*’s duties.

In the regions of Jiangbiao in Wu, and between Ke and Chu, the *Dujian* holds the chime-stone to direct the rites and lead the ceremonies. The phrase “first sound the Dharma drum” refers to the bells and chime-stones, intended to ensure that all officiants are solemnly aligned, their deportment stern and ordered. One must first strike the chime-stone to unify the assembly, then recite and chant as they ascend the altar—this, too, is the *Dujian*’s responsibility.

Yet in recent years, when the *Dujian* is of advanced age or virtue, and reluctance arises to burden them with every task, one person from among the officiants is appointed to hold the chime-stone and intone the rites. Though this arises from immediate necessity, it is not an ancient institution. Upon examination, such delegation of duty is a dereliction of office.

Moreover, some later students, acting on their own whims, have arbitrarily appointed an additional person to hold the chime-stone, creating a position outside the six offices without any canonical basis. The error deepens further.

The *Gaogong Fashi* (High Merit Dharma Master) holds the duty of presenting petitions and proclamations. Their movements and bearing lead the assembly. Should age or infirmity render them unfit, they may seek retirement—how can they delegate their role and thus proliferate superfluous personnel?

In present-day Shu, the *Gaogong*’s duties are confined to invoking and sealing the incense burners, announcing their name and rank twice. All other proclamations are entrusted to others. Though they may chant first while others follow, how does this differ from a dragon’s roar met by a turtle’s echo? Such conduct invites karmic retribution and self-incurred blame. If human affairs cannot tolerate it, how can the Dao of Heaven respond in kind? Future masters of the rites must take heed: do not pursue immediate convenience, lest you compound your sins in the hereafter.

The *Jianzhai* (Retreat Supervisor) upholds the regulations and statutes, correcting transgressions and deviations. Their duty lies in impartiality, adhering to canonical law. Should any violation occur, they must issue a written reprimand. The offender, too, must accept punishment willingly.

The aim is that, outwardly, rites may be observed to preserve the solemnity of the assembly, while inwardly, one remains free of self-deception, avoiding lingering regret. During the process of correction, there must be no clamor or dispute. The one upholding the law must proceed with proper protocol; the guilty must not evade or resist. Such conduct not only offends the sages of the unseen realm but also invites ridicule from the assembly.

Next, the *Shijing* (Scripture Attendants) maintain order in the altar space, overseeing the Dharma seat and the lecterns for scriptures and regulations. They arrange offerings, supplies, and furnishings, ensuring all is properly inspected.

Formerly, within the retreat hall, two high seats were installed for the three daily sessions of lecturing and recitation. Thus, the *Jianyi* (Simplified Rites) states: “Three sessions of lecturing and chanting.” The *Zhijian* (Office Regulations) further states: “Guard the two lion seats.” The *Fajian* (Penalty Regulations) stipulates: “Those listening to the scriptures must not lean or rely on anything, nor hold tablets.” It also states: “Inquire about faulty verses.” These all clarify that, after the ritual proceedings conclude, the Dharma Master and officiants engage in the three daily sessions of lecturing and recitation.

In recent practice, however, the three daily rites are conducted solely within the altar space, with three sessions of circumambulation and three of scripture recitation. The tradition of lecturing and chanting has long faded, and the two high seats are no longer set up.

During scripture recitation, the officiants take their seats. One attendant carries the purifying water, another tends the incense, and another handles the scriptures. After the recitation concludes, the *Shijing* retrieves the scriptures and returns them to their proper place, then arranges and sweeps the altar space, preparing for the offerings. They must ensure that outsiders do not trespass upon or defile the sacred altar—this is the *Shijing*’s duty.

They must not neglect their responsibilities, nor act with arrogance or irreverence. They must not allow lecterns to lie askew in the altar space, nor permit offerings to be soiled or mixed with profane items. They must not permit servants or laborers to enter the altar, thus offending the divine and transgressing the precepts.

After the altar is sealed, passage is forbidden—yet servants, cooks, and attendants casually come and go. Such practices are common and must be strictly prohibited. Should they persist, the *Shijing* will bear the blame and punishment.

The duties of the *Shixiang* (Incense Attendants) are outlined in the liturgical texts. Yet in recent times, negligence has prevailed, and diligence has waned. Not only does the incense smoke often cease, but the fire frequently dies, leaving the ashes cold. Moreover, before the *Gaogong* has even ascended the altar, some officiants presumptuously add incense. Such deviations are widespread and must be corrected upon review of the rites and regulations.

The *Shideng* (Lamp Attendants) must remain diligent, ensuring the lamps are lit according to the rites, burning through the night and rekindled at dawn—only then do they fulfill their duty. Yet some unlearned and shallow individuals, instead of having the *Shijing* maintain the altar, have arbitrarily established a position called *Zhitan* (Altar Attendant), creating a superfluous role outside the six offices. Enlightened Dharma Masters should reject such innovations, lest they tread false paths and invite the scorn of future sages.

Furthermore, according to the ancient rites of the *Jinlu* (Golden Register) and the old regulations of the *Huanglu* (Yellow Register), on the night of the preliminary invocation and during the declaration of merits, a *Ziran Chao* (Natural Audience) is first conducted before proceeding with the retreat rites. Thus, the *Qizhai Yi* (Retreat Invocation Rites) states: “The officiants, in succession, first perform the Natural Audience. After the Three Bows, they report to the retreat office, recite the precepts, and proclaim the regulations. At dawn the following day, they proceed with the rites according to the proper method.”

This practice has been transmitted from Master Zhang of Heaven, Master Lu, Master Kou of Heaven, and Master Zhang Qingdu, down to the present, spanning many generations. All regard the retreat rites as deriving from the *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure) tradition, with the Natural Audience as the ancestral foundation of the retreat. Thus, it is performed first to demonstrate that the origin is not forgotten.

Yet some ignorant Daoists, failing to comprehend the intent of the ancient sages, first appoint the six offices and proclaim the regulations before the *Xuanshi* (Mystic Master), then ascend the altar, falsely claiming adherence to the retreat rites of Master Jianji. Their errors and distortions, their slanderous and illogical arguments, reveal a profound lack of understanding. Even worse, they have followers who imitate such practices.

Not only do they incur the transgression of disordering the rites, but they also bear the sin of slandering the worthy. Those of discerning teaching should jointly reject such practices.

Among the old rites, there are transmitted errors: only at the moment of declaring the retreat’s merit, during the Natural Audience, should one pay homage to the *Lingbao Heavenly Worthy*. Yet the transmitted practice has been to pay homage to the *Jade Treasure August Supreme* and the like—this slightly deviates from the original intent of the Natural Audience. Perhaps due to the passage of long ages, scribal errors have crept in. In this ritual, corrections have now been made, not out of presumption, but as dictated by reason. May later worthies and those of the present age together propagate this.

**Ritual Procedures for the Retreat Altar’s Chants and Responses**

On the night of the retreat’s commencement, the assembled officers take their positions before the *Mystic Master*. One is appointed to read the office assignments. Another leads the retreat sponsor to bow twice before the *Mystic Master*. Then, three pinches of incense are offered.

After the daily *Circulation of the Dao*, they return to the retreat hall to rest for a time, then ascend the altar to recite scriptures. The assembly stands before the *Mysterious Master* as the *Chief Cantor* intones:
"All in this Dharma assembly, each with focused mind, take refuge in the *Three Treasures*."

They bow to the *Mysterious Master*, then chant the names of the *Supreme Meritorious Deeds* as they wish.

Next, the *Hymn of China* leads them to ascend the altar.
Next, the *Entering the Chamber Spell*, ascending the *Gate of Heaven*, and offering incense. They stand at their positions.

"All in this Dharma assembly, holding tablets before their hearts, sit in proper posture."

The assembly sits, then chants hymns as prescribed.

Next, they disperse to the retreat hall as in the usual rite.

During the three-, five-, or seven-day retreat, if conducting the *Rite of the Lamp*, they await the time of *Circulating the Dao* at dusk to exit the altar. The assembly arranges itself at the *Earth Gate* as the *Dharma Master* or an officiant recites the invocations and bows as prescribed. When complete, they chant the *Hymn of Studying the Way of Immortality* and lead the assembly before the *Mysterious Master*.

In the old method, they would circumambulate beneath the lamps to recite the spell. Now, to avoid complexity, they stand at the *Earth Gate*, bowing from afar toward the *Three Supreme Ones* upon the altar, which is also fitting.

When the retreat concludes, at the *Ox Hour* the following day or after the *Hour of the Boar* on the same day, the assembly arranges itself before the *Mysterious Master*. The *Chief Cantor* intones:

**True Writ for Pacifying the Altar: Jade Formulae**
**Method for Pacifying the Altar with the Vermilion Writ of the True Writ**
*From the* Scripture of the Jade Formulae of the Numinous Treasure.

The Scripture states:
The Primordial Five Elders, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the August Highest Thearch, and the great deities of the ten directions assembled at the Upper Palace of Vermilion Yang in the Southern Cinnabar Grotto. They sat upon seven-jeweled thrones of seven hues. At that time, the Five Thearchic Great Sages, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, and the various perfected ones and great immortals—fifty-two thousand five hundred in all—came together before the thrones. Heaven rained fragrant blossoms, and divine dragons performed music. Countless hosts spread forth purple clouds on all sides, while the Three Luminaries shone in unison. The Primordial Era rejoiced in harmony, and the assembled perfected ones arrived in shared procession.

The Lord of the Dao, moved by compassion, desired to deliver all beings—whether male or female, those of earnest vows, or those of sincere heart—so that all might behold the emergence of the Numinous Treasure Dharma. Even those drawn to the Dharma Gate by good intentions were once, in the ten thousand kalpas of former lives, already devoted to the Most Perfected. Their merit complete and their virtue fulfilled, they were born into the world of the Dao. Now, encountering the flourishing of the Dharma, it is fitting to resolve their doubts and obstructions for them.

The Twelve Divisions of Scriptures refer to the twelve divisions of the Wondrous Cavern of the Central Dharma. Through these, you shall deliver the people of the ten directions and all heavens. Apply yourselves diligently, and let no demonic words deceive you.

Guangting said: In ancient times, when the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning had already divided the Primal Chaos, the Three Qi unfolded the cosmic pattern. From the primordial essence of the Great Dao—the True One’s qi—were transformed the Numinous Treasure. The Red Writ coagulated into script, descending upon the Five Directions to pacify and stabilize heaven and earth, and to summon the perfected and the numinous. Thus it is said: heaven and earth receive it to be pacified and stabilized; sun and moon receive it to shine with radiance; ghosts and spirits receive it to be delivered and enlightened; and the people receive it to attain longevity. The True Writ has been bequeathed to the world: above, it dissolves celestial calamities and safeguards the emperors; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the multitudes. It subdues gods and demons, rescues the sunken and drowning, and accomplishes all without exception. As the scripture says: “Without the Writ, there is no illumination; without the Writ, there is no clarity; without the Writ, there is no establishment; without the Writ, there is no completion; without the Writ, there is no deliverance; without the Writ, there is no life.” It is also said: “The Red Writ of Jade Characters and the Eight Mighty Dragon Script preserve and regulate the kalpic destiny, ensuring the heavens endure forever.” Such are the wondrous functions of the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure and the True Writ. Thus they rectify the celestial divisions and harmonize yin and yang; deliver the flying souls and protect the emperors; rescue the drowning and aid the submerged; bridge the hidden and the manifest; reconcile grievances and absolve transgressions; avert death and prolong life. The sufferings of life and death are all saved without exception.

When establishing a retreat, the True Writ and Jade Characters are installed to pacify the Five Directions. Upon the conclusion of the altar rites, the Writ is gathered and burned. The ashes are scattered amidst the azure smoke, all in accordance with the Jade Instructions. Should a scholar-practitioner cultivate the Real and seek deliverance for themselves, inscribing their name in the registers of immortality, they shall forever depart the ghostly realms. On the days of the Three Primes, the Eight Nodes, the jiazi, or their own life-destiny day, they shall inscribe the Writ upon jade tablets and cast them into renowned mountains, thereby erasing the karmic ledgers of past lives. Their names ascend to heaven, and each matter is thrice presented before the heavens. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus record their meritorious deeds. Above, they are distinguished by the heavens; ten thousand spirits revere and protect them; the Five Emperors attend them; and the Three Realms’ administrators welcome them. A thousand demons and ten thousand spirits dare not rashly intrude. As the scripture says: “With resolve firm and unwavering, all endeavors toward the Dao shall succeed.” Seven generations of ancestors ascend to the celestial palaces, and the blessings of life and death respond in kind.

**First Talisman: The Azure Emperor of the East, Command of the Numinous Treasure True Writ**
The Jade Characters of the East, twenty-four in number. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, scholar-practitioners shall inscribe them in vermilion and carry them, or cast them into renowned mountains. The Nine Qi of the East commence with the August Azure Heaven. Amidst the verdant mists and towering ramparts dwells an Elder who oversees the celestial registers and summons qi to elevate immortals.

Another thirty-two characters govern the advent of baleful stars. Inscribed in vermilion upon azure paper and exposed in the courtyard for nine days, they dissolve calamities when carried. For the cultivation of the Yellow Register, they pacify the East. Proceed according to the following incantation:

The Year Star assists the liver; Horn and Neck stabilize the Real.
Root, Chamber, Heart, and Tail revolve through the four seasons.
Winnowing Basket governs the seven luminaries; the Northern Dipper’s wheel turns bright.
Receiving qi, it captures the false and sweeps away calamitous hosts.

The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus—no sin remains unexpiated.
Scatter incense to the Five Emperors, pledging alliance with the Great Void.
As I have petitioned, may I dwell for ten thousand kalpas.*
The Primordial and Five Elders avert stellar and guest-star calamities,
illuminating the heavens’ divisions and degrees, establishing the fast and pacifying the true writ’s jade formula.

The Dao declares: The stellar lodges of the myriad heavens each have their allotted degrees.
When their paths cross or transgress, they encroach upon one another.
Should an anomalous star appear in a region’s domain,
it arises from the heavens’ qi coursing through adverse cycles.
Calamities strike where they trespass, manifesting in the afflicted land.
Thus, the celestial light shifts its illumination, mystically announcing the inauspicious.
The Primordial bestowed the writ to harmonize heaven and stabilize earth,
dissolving calamities and repelling misfortune, pacifying the state and tranquilizing the people.
Devoted scholars, with concentrated minds, cultivate according to the method.

On the day the calamity appears, inscribe the true writ according to its method and expose it in the central courtyard, facing the afflicted direction. For instance, if the star resides in the east—among the Horn and Neck’s seven lodges—face east and recite the incantation, exposing the writ for nine days. Proceed likewise for other directions. Strike the teeth twelve times, loosen the hair, and lift the head. The incantation reads:

The Primordial of the Upper Heavens, the Three Luminaries’ radiant clarity,
revolves its light to illumine the four directions in profound purity.
Where the celestial cycles clash, meteors surge in streaming brilliance;
the five divisions transgress, the three norms lose their peace.
The Five Ladles govern the stars, the seven lodges gleam with numinous power.
The True Lord, Great Luminary—his sacred name is Jade Purity.
The Lady, Empress of Humankind, is styled Nurturer of Infants.
Together they oversee the Mystic Pass, revolving all the heavens.
Now a guest-calamity arrives, mystically announcing the inauspicious.
We present the true writ in vermilion script, loosen our hair in atonement,
and bare our crimson sincerity.
May the Mystic Mirror witness this: restore the celestial norm,
let qi not stray wantonly, let calamities not arise without cause.
Burn the numinous writ, scatter its smoke in the Jade Court.
The Upper Radiance surveys the degrees, universally notifying the myriad spirits.
Qi purifies the Three Passes, calamities vanish in the Nine Darknesses.
Yin and yang harmonize, the land knows great peace.
Having dispatched this via the Golden Dragon’s wind-and-fire courier,
expose the true writ in the central courtyard, where the Golden Dragon shall guard it.
If the calamity lies in the east—referring to the Horn and Neck’s seven lodges—
complete nine days and nights, then burn the writ and scatter its ashes amid the blue smoke.

For all rites to dispel celestial calamities and pacify state and people, each method follows the afflicted direction.
Light lamps to illumine the myriad heavens: if the calamity lies in the east, light nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred.
Use one Golden Dragon and ninety bolts of blue silk, performing the rite for nine days and nights.
If the calamity lies in the south, light three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred—
one Golden Dragon, and thirty bolts of crimson silk, performing the rite for three days and nights.
If the calamity lies in the center, light twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred—
one Golden Dragon, and one hundred twenty bolts of yellow silk, performing the rite for twelve days and nights.
The center refers to the Celestial Market, the Supreme Subtlety, and the Purple Tenuity Palaces.
If the calamity lies in the west, light seven lamps—or seventy, or seven hundred—
one Golden Dragon, and seventy bolts of white silk, performing the rite for seven days and nights.
If the calamity lies in the north, light five lamps—or fifty, or five hundred—
one Golden Dragon, and fifty bolts of black silk, performing the rite for five days and nights.
The rest follows the *Upper Prime Statutes of the Primordial Numinous Treasure*.
The Yellow Register Fast is regularly practiced in accordance with this method.

The Primordial Numinous Treasure’s Five Elders summon and subdue the demonic hordes of the Northern Feng.
The Vermilion Script’s Upper Writ states:
Those who receive the Numinous Treasure’s supreme method entice divine luminaries to descend.
Through concentrated visualization, their resonance reaches the heavens, enabling communion with celestial perfected.
First distinguish the forms of demonic hordes:
block their trials and tests, subdue their demonic essence.
Through visualization, self-cultivation, and resonance, divine luminaries are readily summoned.
To perform this method, follow the true writ’s instructions.
Face the northeast and strike the teeth thirty-six times—the northeast is the Demon Gate.
For grave illnesses, pestilences, or malevolent apparitions arising wantonly,
perform the fast and writ-installation rites in the northeast of the state, capital, commandery, or territory.
Practice with concentrated mind: demonic hordes will be crushed and subdued, the state pacified, the people tranquilized.
Hold the breath for nine cycles, then lift the head and recite:
The Three Primes unfold clarity, revolving the celestial constant.
As the cycles’ reckoning concludes, the Hundred-Six seizes the net.
At the great kalpa’s convergence, myriad demons contend in motion.
The Northern Feng is unrestrained, releasing its demonic lineage.
Hordes of demons rampage, malevolence obscures the celestial light.
The August Emperor commands, universally notifying the ten directions.
He elucidates the celestial degrees, expands the dharma’s teachings.
The true Dao governs the people, subjugating and dispelling the inauspicious.
What petty demons dare assemble in throngs?
The Vermilion Script’s jade writ restrains and seizes the demonic realm.
The Three Officials of the Northern Feng swiftly transmit the decree.
A thousand warriors bind their vigor, ten thousand demons surrender their forms.
Flowing bells interweave their brilliance, stirring the qi of the Great Yang.
Golden Tigers patrol the four quarters, Celestial Warriors capture the fugitive.
Great and small assemble together, none may hide or evade.
The Primordial’s proclamation is presented to the Upper Palaces.
Hold the breath for a long while, awaiting the resonance of what has been summoned.
Distinguish the true forms of the numinous spirits, visualize and resonate with their efficacy.
Do not speak of this, lest the work be undone.

The Primordial’s Five Elders dispel the great kalpa’s floodwaters,
summon the flood dragons and water palaces, and transmit the true writ’s jade formula for averting calamity.
The Dao declares:
When the great kalpa’s calamity befalls heaven and earth, floodwaters surge from all directions,
scouring filth and eradicating evil, leaving none behind.
At such times, heaven and earth merge in darkness, the people drift without distinction of good or ill.
Only those devoted scholars who obtain the Numinous Treasure’s true writ—
the talismans for great and small kalpas—
may ride feathered wings to ascend and observe from on high, or climb numinous peaks and soar.
At such times, divine beings shall act on their behalf:
command the flood dragons to open waterways, clearing paths for their passage,
while the River Earl oversees their crossing, sparing them the need for bridges or ferries.
The true writ’s numinous subtlety transcends even the great kalpa’s calamity.
Should one encounter such a time, follow the writ’s instructions.
Face the water’s northern position, strike the teeth five times, and open the breath’s closure.
Hold the breath for twenty-five cycles, visualizing one’s body and mind.
Fire arises within, emerging from the crown of the head to burn the four directions’ mountains, forests, grasses, trees, and one’s own body,
reducing all forms to flying ash.
Soar amid the blue smoke, leaving no trace behind.
Return to the Supreme Yang, unconstrained by fire.
Visualize the vast waters surging, scouring the world.
One’s body, transformed to ash, drifts with the current.
Then strike the teeth twenty-five times.
If a region’s floodwaters accumulate yin to form calamity,
devoted scholars who practice according to the writ may also rescue the drowning multitudes,
saving the myriad beings from sinking into ruin.

Thus did the Great Yu obtain it, summoning spirits and calling forth dragons to channel the hundred rivers, accomplishing his work of flood control. The incantation reads:

The Five Phases spur one another,
their revolving measures governed by yang.
Yin and yang clash in obstruction,
congealing into calamitous surges.
The great kalpa’s end is reached,
sweeping away filth and dispelling miasma.
The Nine Rivers receive their reckoning,
as deluge surges through the channels.
The Water Mother lingers,
birds and horses gather in flocks.
Sun and moon meet in darkness,
the Three Luminaries halt at the pass.
The chosen seed-people are selected,
their jade texts compared and examined.
Evil is cast off, good preserved,
the pure and turbid forever parted.
I partake in the Emperor’s decree,
my name inscribed among the Nine Heavens.
When the fourfold great disasters converge,
the Red Writ absolves them all.

On this day, proclaim the command to the myriad spirits,
that all may hear: the Nine Rivers’ water palaces, the vast and abyssal deities,
open the waterways, clear the river fords.
Dragons respond to the talisman,
seizing mountains to send forth clouds.
Bearing me, escorting me,
they gallop in all four directions.
Cinnabar script in vermilion characters,
the Primordial One’s true writ.
Golden dragons swiftly present it,
unceasing in every moment.

Standing, make the report to the throne,
facing the August Honored One above.
When complete, draw in the breath twenty-five times and swallow it.
In an instant, the gods of passage shall arrive
to ferry the practitioner’s body across.
If in the mountains, the mountains shall float;
if in the waters, the waters shall part.
This may be called delivering from peril in the blink of a minnow’s eye.

When prefectures and kingdoms suffer water disasters, one may also establish a fast. Inscribe the texts with utmost care, and perform the rites accordingly.

At the beginning of kalpas without number, the Heavenly Worthy moved the primordial qi and true essence, transforming and giving birth to numinous scriptures to govern the turning of kalpas, protect the state, and pacify the people. Those born under the Zi constellation are blessed, their fortune bound to good causes. Thus do they encounter these texts.

The people of high antiquity were pure and harmonious, embracing simplicity. They merged with the Dao, and without awaiting fasts or precepts, their practice brought immediate response. In this degenerate age, human hearts are scattered and corrupted. Few uphold the true, while many stray from it. Those who wish to practice this method must follow the writs of the Three Primes, establish the fast, perform the Dao, and concentrate their minds with utmost sincerity. Only then may they inwardly align with the mysterious sages and achieve spiritual resonance. Without this, demonic trials will obstruct them, and their efforts will be in vain.

Select those of purity and integrity, in places untouched by worldly dust—sacred mountains and numinous sites—to await the response. Thus shall the great Dao’s compassion in delivering beings and the Most High’s grace in saving all be made manifest.

Let those who propagate this transformation exert themselves!

*Tai Shang Huang Lu Zhai Yi*, Scroll Fifty-Four Concludes
*Tai Shang Huang Lu Zhai Yi*, Scroll Fifty-Five Begins

Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting, *Ritual for Offering Dragon and Jade Disc* – *Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:

To deliver beings from the roots of sin, once all fasts and rites of majestic decorum are complete, follow the Red Writs and Jade Formulas, inscribe cinnabar upon the *jin* tablets, bind them with golden dragons and blue-green silk, and present them to the numinous mountains and Five Peaks. The pledge of ascension shall be sealed within the recesses of sheer cliffs. All must accord with the prescribed method.

*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:

When the rites invoking the Five Thearchs’ majesty are complete, take one cinnabar-inscribed jade tablet and one golden dragon, bind them with blue-green silk, and cast them into the Three Rivers to present to the Water Thearch. The pledge of ascension must fully adhere to the jade formulas and written statutes.

*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:

When the rites for the Water Thearch are complete, take nine jade tablets, golden dragons, and golden knots, bind them with blue-green silk, and bury them at the altar site to report and covenant with the Earth Officials. All must follow the regulations as stated.

*Zhenxian Section of the Upper Yuan Jinlu Writs* states:

To deliver beings from the bonds of life and death, when the fast’s rites of majestic decorum are observed, place five golden dragons atop the True Writs of the Five Directions. Upon completion, cast them into the mountains and waters.

*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:

For the rites of majestic decorum to deliver beings from the roots of sin, use refined gold to fashion ten golden dragons to guard the Ten Directions. To deliver the flying souls, place one dragon at each of the ten directions.

*Yugui Mingzhen Ke* states:

When performing the precious Huanglu fast, use three *liang* of refined gold to cast three dragons, each weighing one *liang*. The state employs refined gold; dukes, ministers, and high officials use secondary gold; scholars, commoners, and the people may use silver, copper, or gilded substitutes, supplemented with jade tablets (the *yu zha*). Inscribe upon them the purpose of the fast, the state’s name, the year of the Great Year, the month and day, the Dharma master’s name, and the location of the offering. Cast them into renowned mountains and grottoes, numinous springs and dragon caves, or at the fast’s altar or dwelling place to report and covenant with the Three Bureaus of Heaven, Earth, and Water, allowing them to witness and verify the fast’s merit. Should any be omitted, the Nine Departments of the Earth Officials shall hold them accountable.

The regulations state: The dragon rides the clouds and qi, governs yin and yang. When united, it forms a body; when dispersed, it becomes patterns. Its transformations are unfathomable—it enters the earth and ascends to heaven. Thus, in the Thirty-Six Heavens, the realm of utmost yang, it serves as the courier to transmit messages and communicate with the mysterious and numinous. Is there anything but the dragon that can achieve this? The dragon is a yang creature. Of all things used by heaven, none surpasses the dragon; of those used by earth, none surpasses the tortoise; of those used by humans, none surpasses the horse. Therefore, the heavens employ dragons as their couriers, traversing between the heavens and the human realm. Gold, the noblest of the five metals, is unyielding and incorruptible—a treasure of heaven and earth that communicates with the numinous and harmonizes with the divine. Thus, refined gold is used to cast them in the dragon’s form. Cast into grottoes and palaces, they serve as pledges to covenant with the Three Primes. The true officials of the grottoes and palaces, along with their subordinate offices, receive the dragon pledges and written tablets, record the meritorious deeds, and memorialize them to the Most High Sages. The response to resonance is like a shadow following form. Those who cultivate and uphold these rites must not omit them.

The regulations state: The tablet (*jian*) serves to report, record, and inscribe. It records the world’s good deeds and reports them to the Perfected Ones. Its length is one *chi* and two *cun*, symbolizing the twelve earthly branches. Its width is two *cun* and four *fen*, corresponding to the twenty-four true qi. Its thickness is two *fen*, representing the Two Modes (yin and yang). Its top and bottom are square, symbolizing the sun’s square shadow. It is upright and unobstructed, yielding to nothing. The state uses jade for its tablets, for jade possesses nine virtues and may be used to ritualize heaven and earth. As a pledge to the divine spirits, jade is thus employed. Dukes, ministers, and commoners all use *jin* wood, for its purity and fine texture may be likened to jade, clarifying the distinctions of rank.

The regulations state: The jade disc (*bi*) is the treasure used to ritualize heaven, earth, and mountains and rivers, and is made of jade. When offering to mountains and rivers, use one round disc. Its color is azure, its diameter three *cun*, with a hollow center. The mountain tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Heavens, so an azure disc is used, symbolizing heaven. When offering to water tablets, use a six-pointed disc. Its color is black, its diameter three *cun*, with a hollow center. The water tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Seas and Water Officials, so a dark disc is used, representing the color of water. The six points correspond to the number of water. When offering to earth tablets, use a yellow disc. It is square, with a diameter of two *cun* and a hollow center. The earth tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Lands. Yellow is the color of earth, and square is the shape of earth. The disc and dragon accompany the sealed tablet, bound with blue-green silk.

The regulations state: For the method of casting the three tablets, use nine golden knots to accompany the tablets. For three tablets, twenty-seven knots are used. The golden knots replace the blood oath, and the blue-green silk replaces the cutting of hair. To forge a covenant and convey sincerity, nothing is more weighty. Thus, the blue-green silk binds the knots, disc, tablet, and dragon before casting them. For the state, gold is used for the knots; for ministers and commoners, silver or copper gilded in gold may suffice. The knots have a diameter of nine *fen*, with their outer edges rounded like rings.

The regulations state: Upon completing the fast, select an auspicious day, or a day of purity during the fast. Prepare offerings, feasts, and ritual implements for the Dharma master, officials, and the fast’s host and disciples. Either board a boat to reach water grottoes or ascend by land to mountain gates. Outside the grottoes and palaces, clear the grass, sweep, and purify the area, then arrange the ritual mats, wine, fruits, delicacies, venison, broth, and tea. The state uses sixty-four portions; ministers and commoners use twenty-four. Follow the solemn ritual decorum: don ceremonial robes, bathe, and pay homage to the ritual proceedings, adhering strictly to the prescribed forms. The local divine officials and supervising generals shall act as intermediaries, reporting to the immortal offices within the grottoes to communicate the fast’s tablets. Thus, blessings and good fortune shall swiftly manifest. Do not fail to report and simply cast the tablets into the grottoes, for without reaching the true numina, one shall incur punishment instead. If the mountain or water grottoes are distant and the master and assembly cannot all attend or ascend, select one or two ritual officers from the altar, along with disciples, to carry the tablets to the grottoes. Perform the offerings and reports as in the original ritual.

If the state performs the *Investiture of the Dragon* ritual, the Five Marchmounts and various mountains each have their own golden dragon protocols, which differ in complexity from these ordinary rites. Should the fasting patrons—whether due to public or private constraints—be unable to personally attend the grotto-palaces, they may select one individual of utmost sincerity, reverence, and devout diligence to perform the rites in their stead. If no such proxy can be found, the master shall act as intermediary to report on their behalf. Under no circumstances may the tablets be concealed or the matter prolonged. Once the covenant of report and oath is made, the local divine officials shall record and memorialize it; the offense for failure is no trifling matter—utmost caution is required.

Upon arriving at the grotto site, choose level ground outside the entrance—or a boat, or a stone surface—and ensure it is swept clean and purified to establish the ritual space. Prepare five mats of pure cloth, five ritual towels, blue and plain cloths, and offerings of wine, tea, and hot water. Arrange five trays of seasonal fruits, pastries, and delicacies: sixty-four for the state, twenty-four for officials and commoners. Set out four incense burners, four burner cloths, and four tables. Once the arrangements are complete, sprinkle the area beyond the altar with fragrant water to dispel noxious influences and ward off impurities, as in standard ritual procedure.

Master and disciples alike must bathe and purify themselves. Solemnity and reverence take precedence; laxity, clamor, or irreverence are forbidden. Violations shall incur severe penalties.

Each shall pay homage to the master, contemplating the proper visualization: next, invoke the Three Honored Ones, the scriptural treasures, the Transcendent Masters, the Five Stars, the Five Earths, the Five Marchmounts, the Five Treasuries, the Five Spirits, the scriptural and ordination masters. Envision the three-colored clouds of qi, the grotto-palace of the locale, the true immortals and divine administrators, the supervising officials, and the land spirits on duty—all seated in solemn array, clearly manifest. Conclude as prescribed in the fasting ritual.

*Guardian Spirits.*

The Five Spirits take their positions, resplendent in guard of the five directions. The August Sovereign shields the soul; the Cinnabar Elder protects the form. The Radiant Spirit attends the po; the Dark Emperor sustains life. The Yellow Emperor of the Center commands the myriad perfected. The Primordial August One issues his decree, and the light of the hidden night unfolds. Sins dissolve in the Northern Bureau; names are inscribed in the Southern Prosperity. The Golden Register fixes one’s destiny; the Jade Script dispels calamity. The Vermilion Mound refines the substance; the spirit soars to the Great Azure. The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the boundless divine realm—all universally receive deliverance and ascend to the celestial halls.

Sound the ritual drum twenty-four times.
Open the incense burner.

Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao: summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Messengers of the Left and Right, the Dragon-Riding Couriers of the Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-six each. Now summon the local earth deities and the mountain and river spirits to swiftly appear, don their solemn attire, and attend the memorial.

This servant now burns incense and offers the Yellow Register Precious Retreat on behalf of so-and-so, having completed the merit and concluded the rites, submitting the document to the numinous mountain. May the Primordial Qi of the Supreme Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones enter the bodies of this servant and company. May this petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Supreme, the Boundless Dao, the Kunlun and Five Marchmounts, the numinous mountains and grotto-palaces.

Each declares their ritual rank.

This humble servant so-and-so and company reverently invoke the Great Luo, the Jade Purity, the Boundless, the Most High and True Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the thirty-six divisions of the honored scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center; the Three Treasures and all sacred hosts. May they deign to descend in compassion. We bow our heads and prostrate ourselves again.

We reverently invoke the perfected immortals of such-and-such grotto-palace, the officials of the grotto-heavens, the attained perfected ones. May they deign to descend in radiance.

We reverently invoke the local governing deities, the overseers of the void, the incense officials and messengers, the mighty spirits of the Three Caverns, the true officials of the precinct, the guardian generals and officers, the spirits of mountains, waters, rivers, and marshes—all the proper deities, each in their official capacity, to descend.

Next, offer the three pinches of upper-grade incense.
Present the wine.

Kneeling in reverence, each announcing their dharmic rank, your humble servant [Name], in full devotion, respectfully addresses the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Three Venerable Ones of the Supreme; the hosts of Great Sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions; the Perfected Lords and Masters; the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern Perfected; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center; the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate; the Three Perfected of the Mysterious Unity; the deities of the heavens, sun, moon, and constellations; the immortals of the Kunlun Upper Palace; the Golden Mother of the Western Numinous; the Perfected Lords of the Five Marchmounts; the rightful officials of the Sacred Mountains; the Hidden and Flourishing Lords in Reserve; the Elder of Mount Qingcheng; the Envoys of Mount Lu; the Obscure and Lofty of Mount Zhong; the Western Mysterious Pond and Terrace; the great spirits of the mounds and mountains; the Three Officials of the Northern Realm; the Six Palaces of the Nether Bureau; the deities above the earth and below the heavens; the numinous spirits of the unseen; the overseers of life and keepers of records; the Three Southern Gates; the supremely divine and numinous; and all the assembled immortals.

This humble servant, born of dust and defilement, blind and ignorant, has, through the good affinities of ten thousand kalpas, relied upon and followed the transformative power of the Dao. Reverently receiving the compassionate teachings, I have aided the state and established merit, saved beings and delivered people, propagated the Dao, and upheld the Dharma.

Should the transmission of scriptures and registers be conducted on this day, the [day/month/year], the disciple shall approach a Master of the Three Caverns, the Perfected One of [such-and-such] Sacred Peak, [so-and-so], to receive the *True Writings of the Five Venerable Ones*, the *Vermilion Scriptures of the Numinous Chapters*, the *Eight Sceneries of the Three Divisions*, the *Inner Sounds of the Myriad Heavens*, the *Two Registers of Divine Immortals*, the *Eight Might-Inspiring Writs*, the *Tally-Staves of the Five Thearchs*, and the *True Scriptures of the Central Alliance*. Upon completion of the transmission, the disciple shall present a memorial tablet at the Numinous Mountain, offering it with a golden clasp. Thereafter, no further clasps shall be used—these four characters are to be omitted.

The *Golden Dragon Courier Transmission*.
The *Yellow Register Memorial Tablet* states: Humbly offered on behalf of the official [so-and-so] and [such-and-such], who has established the Great Yellow Register Retreat for the sake of state and family, extending blessings to both the living and the deceased. Seeking forgiveness of sins and imploring grace, dissolving calamities and misfortunes.

Upon the conclusion of the ritual, the memorial tablet shall be presented at the Numinous Mountain, transmitted via the *Golden Dragon Courier*, beseeching the erasure of sins from the records and the inscription of names in the *Jade Registers*. May the divine and immortal ones release the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of kin, the departed and the transformed, redeeming their evil roots and delivering them from the Fengdu and Mount Tai, the Twenty-Four Prisons, the Courts of the Five Sacred Peaks, the Nine Dark Realms, the Knife Mountains and Sword Trees, and the lands of suffering and affliction. May their souls behold the radiant light and forever receive deliverance. May they be transformed through the wheel of rebirth, entering the gates of bliss. May their tombs remain undisturbed, and lawsuits cease. May the entire household receive blessings, and all be indebted to this grace. May malevolent spirits be eradicated, and auspicious omens arise daily. May those who cultivate the Dao and seek the Perfected attain immortal ranks forever. Should these prayers be granted, we shall ever bear the profound grace of the Mysterious.

This humble servant, [so-and-so], with reverence and awe, bows twice in prostration.
Respectfully submitted.

Next, rise and hold the memorial tablet, fumigating it with incense.
Knock the teeth nine times.

After reciting the memorial text, seal it with blue paper, binding it with azure silk and the dragon clasp, jade, and other tokens.
The disciple shall hold it over the incense while the master recites the incantation:

*"The Mysterious Above opens and illumines; the Primordial Beginning oversees the Perfected.
The Five Venerable Ones of the Thearchs, the Vermilion Scripts of the Cinnabar Writings.
The origin of Heaven and Earth, governing the Three Primes.
Gathering qi and summoning assemblies, hastening the pursuit of immortality.
The exalted tally-commands, universally proclaimed to the ten directions.
The sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the numinous mountains of the Five Peaks.
Above the heavens and below the earth, the great spirits of the boundless depths.
The overseers of life and keepers of records, the Three Southern Gates.
Presiding over the Jade Tablets, inscribing names in the Cinnabar Chapters.
Erasing the records of sins, ascending to serve as ministers of the Thearch.
Relying upon the Supreme Dao, establishing merit through the retreat.
Redeeming the nine generations of ancestors, all suffering souls.
Upon the completion of the ritual, reverently following the Numinous Mountain’s decree,
Presenting the Jade Tablet, beseeching the erasure of sinful names.
May all attain liberation, without enmity or kinship.
Departing the Three Evil Realms, ascending to the Nine Heavens.
Delivered from life and death, enduring for a hundred million kalpas.
Today’s supplication is heard by the myriad Perfected.
Presenting the Dragon Tablet, pledging alliance with the Perfected Officials.
May the prayers be granted, transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier."*

Upon the conclusion of the incantation, the assembled officials shall bow twice more.
Next, cast the tablet into the grotto.

*Ode to the Dragon Tablet*
Three bows.
Return to the incense burner.
*Hymn to the Pursuit of Immortality*
Withdraw the offerings.

**Method for Casting the Water Tablet**

Having paid homage to the master, visualize as prescribed.
*Guardian of the Numinous* is invoked.
The ritual drum is sounded twenty-four times.

The Most High Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin, the Three Qi of the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth from within this servant’s body:
the Three and Five Merit Officers,
the Left and Right Attendant Envoys,
the Left and Right Fragrant-Bearing Dragon Courier Scribes,
the Golden Lads of Incense,
the Jade Maidens of Transmission,
and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Fragrant Officers—
thirty-six each—are to emerge.

Summon now the local earth deities and territorial spirits, the Perfected Officials and true gods, to swiftly appear, arrayed in solemn attire, and open the sacred barrier.

This servant now burns incense and casts the tablet, praying that the life-generating qi of the Supreme Ten Directions’ True and Perfected may enter his body, that his petition may swiftly ascend to the presence of the Supreme Limitless Dao’s Radiant Valley Divine King and the Water Thearchs of the Nine Rivers’ Water Palace.

Each performs three bows.
Each declares his ritual rank.
*Descend, O Perfected.*

Kneeling in reverence, this servant humbly petitions:

This servant reverently addresses the Supreme Limitless Dao, the Three Supreme Honored Ones of the Supreme,
the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao,
the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters,
the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen,
the Western Numinous and Northern True,

the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm,
the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate,

the Nine Rivers and Huai Marshes,
the Three Officials and Nine Palaces,
the Twelve River Sources,
the Nine Palaces’ Water Thearchs,
the Great Spirits of the Vast Cold,
the Water Palace Immortals,
and all assembled numina.

This servant, born of humble clay in the lower realms, endowed with a meager and common intellect, has by karmic affinity with the Dao encountered this sagely dispensation. The Numinous Treasure has bestowed its teachings, the Great Dharma has delivered humankind. Assisting the state and establishing merit, he upholds the benevolent instructions. Having received the scriptures and registers—on this day, month, and year, he approached the Three Caverns’ Dharma Master, the Perfected of Such-and-Such Marchmount, so-and-so, who transmitted to him the Five Venerable Perfected of the Numinous Treasure, the Scarlet Writ of the Numinous Chapters, the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences, the Inner Sounds of All Heavens, the Two Registers of Divine Immortals, the Eight Might Commandments, the Five Thearchs’ Talismanic Staffs, the Central Alliance Scriptures, and the transmission of all rites—now complete.

He casts the Dragon Tablet into the limpid spring, fastening it with a golden clasp. If no golden clasp is used, omit these four characters.
Transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.

Upon the completion of the Yellow Register Retreat, this servant, on behalf of such-and-such official, so-and-so, has conducted the Yellow Register Grand Retreat for the state and the household, universally encompassing the living and the deceased. He prays for grace and offers thanks, beseeching blessings and the dissolution of calamities, the resolution of enmities, and the augmentation of life and fortune. With the rites now concluded, he casts the tablet into the numinous spring. Transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier, he petitions the erasure from the ledgers of death, the dissolution of sins, and the inscription of life. May the divine and immortal grant renewal. May the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors be delivered from the roots of suffering, departing the Radiant Valley and the dark, frigid realms of the nether night. Bathed and refined, may they ascend to the heavens. May tombs be secure and felicitous, inauspicious entries forever obliterated. May the entire household receive blessings, their divine qi at rest and serene. May learning and discernment be illuminated, wisdom perfected and radiant. May the true Dharma be proclaimed, treachery and malevolence subdued. May the Three Realms bear witness to their deliverance, their merit fulfilled and conduct complete. May the emperor be secure and the state prosper. This servant humbly submits this petition, praying it be granted as stated.

This servant, with awe and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice.
Humbly submitted.

Next, the tablet is held and fumigated over the incense. The teeth are clicked three times. After the tablet’s text is read, it is sealed with blue paper, bound with azure silk, and affixed with the dragon clasp and jade ornaments. The disciple holds it over the incense while the master recites the incantation:

The Five Venerables of the Primordial Origin, exalted lords of the Highest,
The Perfected of the Ten Directions, the numinous immortals of Mount Taihua.
The Scarlet Writ proclaims the mandate, no hidden realm is untouched.
Ascending to the Nine Heavens, petitioning the descent of the Jade Text.
The Sun, Moon, and Five Planets,
The Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper.
Petitioning the Five Marchmounts at the center,
The numinous mountains of the Four Quarters.
Petitioning the rivers and seas below,
The Twelve Fountainheads.
The Water Thearchs of the Nine Palaces,
The Great Spirits of the Vast Cold.
Today’s supplication is heard,
All vows are declared.
Conducting the retreat and performing the Dao,
Universally for the living and the dead.
Praying for the redemption of the Seven Ancestors,
The roots of karmic transgressions.
Reverently casting the Jade Tablet,
Praying it be heard above.
Inscribed in the Water Palace,
Ascending to heaven in the past.
Delivered from life and death,
All spirits hear the plea.
Presenting the Dragon Tablet,
Pledging alliance with the Water Thearchs.
Grant as petitioned,
Transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.

The incantation concluded, the assembled officials bow twice more.
Next, cast the tablet into the Water Palace.
Chant the *Ode to the Dragon Tablet*.
Three bows.
Return to the incense burner.

The *Hymn to Lesser Immortals* concludes, dispersed as in the usual rite. The *Method for Casting the Earth Tablet* follows. Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

**Guardian of the Numinous**
Twenty-four strikes of the Dharma Drum.

To the Most High Three Heavens, the Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, the Supreme Lord Lao: summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Fragrant-Bearing Dragon Courier Scribes, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Six Fragrant Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Registers for the Day.

At once summon the local Earth Gods and Domain Spirits, the True Officers and Righteous Deities, to swiftly emerge, array themselves, and open the gates.

This servant now burns incense and casts the tablet, praying that the Primordial Qi of the Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones enter this body, that this petition swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the Most High Boundless Dao, the Nine Lands’ August Spirit of the Earth Mansion, and the Great Deities of the Underworld.

Each performs three bows.
Next, each declares their Dharma rank.
Then, facing the southwest, they descend in truth.
Next, kneeling in full prostration, they intone:

This servant reverently petitions the Most High Boundless Dao, the Supreme Three Worthies, the Ten Directions’ Perfected Great Sages, the Most Real Lords and Venerable Ones, the Eastern Flowery Radiance, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the Three Perfected of the Mysterious Unity, the Great Emperor of Fengdu, the Nine Mansion Palaces, the Masters of the Yellow Springs and Crooked Springs, the August High Thearch of the Boundless Realm, the Nine Lands’ August Spirit of the Seasons, the Central August, the Nine Lands’ Earth Gods of the Central Yellow, the Five Thearchs of the Earth Mansion, the officials of the Three Realms, the local Earth Gods and Domain Spirits, the True Officers and Righteous Deities, and all numinous spirits of this abode and dwelling.

This servant, born of coarse qi and foolish nature, has by karmic fortune encountered the True Dharma and auspicious causes. At the opening of the Numinous Treasure’s radiance and the proclamation of the Red Writ, this unworthy one was permitted to attend the Perfected. Aiding the state and serving the times, establishing merit and propagating the teachings, this servant received the Register of the Dharma on such-and-such a day, month, and year, from the Three Caverns’ Dharma Master, the Perfected of Such-and-Such Peak. The transmission included the Five Elder Perfected Texts, the Red Writ Numinous Chapters, the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences, the Inner Sounds of All Heavens, the Two Registers of Gods and Immortals, the Eight Might Commandments, the Five Thearchs’ Talismanic Staffs, the Central Alliance Scriptures, and other texts. The transmission complete, the tablet is cast into the Central Palace, inscribed with a golden clasp—omitting the phrase “afterward twice without clasp” and these four characters.

Transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.

The Yellow Register Retreat’s sponsor, on behalf of such-and-such an official or such-and-such a person, has established the Great Yellow Register Retreat for state and family, universally for the living and the dead. To dissolve calamities, atone for transgressions, pray for blessings, and beseech grace. The Daoist rites concluded, the tablet is cast upon the numinous altar, transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.

Pray that the Earth Tablet erase transgressions and remove sins. May vows be fulfilled and lives preserved, bodies safeguarded. May names be inscribed in the Jade Calendar of the Nine Elder Immortals’ Capital. May the nine generations of ancestors, parents, karmic kin of countless kalpas, the previously and recently deceased, all partake of blessed causes. May they depart from the Nine Darks below, the Eight Gates’ realm, the earth prisons’ interiors, and the midst of suffering. May their calamitous records dissolve, their tombs and dwellings be purified. May evil roots be severed, and may they ascend to the Hall of Blessings. May this servant’s studies be perfected, merits and deeds resplendent. May life and death share in fortune, eternal protection without peril. May the emperor receive blessings, the world know peace.

This servant reverently petitions, praying for compassionate response. With utmost awe and trepidation, this servant kowtows twice more. Respectfully submitted.

Next, the tablet’s text is held and fumigated over incense. Twelve knocks of the teeth.
The tablet’s text read, it is sealed with yellow paper, bound with azure silk, and adorned with a dragon clasp and jade disk. The disciple holds it over the incense while the master intones:

Heaven and Earth unfold,
Myriad darknesses part, spirits divide.
The Three Origins unite in tally,
The Ten Directions shine in clarity.
The Five Peaks ascend in report,
Masters of death, stewards of life.
Cinnabar Writ, Red Text,
Primordial Scripture of the Most High.
Universally proclaimed to the Supreme,
The Nine Lands’ August Spirits.
Today’s supplication is heard,
All immortals’ lives are secured.
Conducting the retreat and performing the Dao,
Universally for the living and the dead.
This servant’s vow, this servant’s immortality,
Pray cast the jade name.
Earth Mansion’s August Thearch,
Inscribe and remove the sentence of punishment.
Petition the Upper Palace,
Engrave the register in the Flowery Clarity.
May this body ascend in flight,
Heaven and Earth share in numinosity.
Nine generations of karmic kin,
Rotten bones renewed in glory.
Souls ascend to the Southern Palace,
Refined in the Immortals’ Court.
Today’s decree proclaimed,
All spirits hear the plea.
Pray with the golden clasp,
Manifest utmost sincerity.
Grant as petitioned,
Transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.

The incantation concluded, the assembled officials bow twice more.
Next, cast the tablet into the altar’s center or beneath the lunar station.
Chant the *Ode to the Dragon Tablet*.
Three bows.

The furnace is restored. Upon concluding the *Primary School of Immortals’ Hymns*, disperse this earthen tablet. On the night of merit’s proclamation, after the recitation of incantations and hymns, by dawn it may be buried within the altar—no further petition or announcement is required. Here, following the rites of Master Zhang Chengguang, three tablets are presented for petition, each corresponding to a distinct true rank; thus, they are recorded again.

If within the altar of the purification fast, only the proclamation of merit is made, and at the time of the libation the incantation is recited, the tablet may then be cast. As for the mountain and water tablets, though proclaimed with the merit’s announcement and the incantation concluded, if a libation is set at the grotto’s site, one must proceed in proper sequence: each is recited, sealed with incantation, and then cast. This ensures completeness; one must not, having petitioned within the altar, proceed directly to the mountain and cast them at will. The true spirits may fail to acknowledge receipt, the merit may not reach its destination, and the loss would be grave—utmost care and deliberation are essential.

The reason for petitioning these mountain and water tablets within the altar is that the fast’s sponsor or disciples, constrained by public or private affairs, may be unable to personally visit the grotto’s gate. Thus, they are proclaimed together within the altar. If the sponsor or disciples do not shrink from the distance of mountains and waters or the toil of ascent, and personally accompany the assembled officials to the grotto’s precincts, then on the night of merit’s proclamation, after the memorial is presented, only the earthen tablet is petitioned. The mountain and water tablets are set aside, to be addressed in their proper rites at the mountain and water sites—this is most fitting. Careful deliberation must guide action; one must not cling rigidly to the text.

When casting the three tablets, it is most excellent to burn one or two hundred paper coins for the local earth deity.

**Method for Casting the Five Thearchs’ Tablets on the Three Primes and Eight Nodal Days to Seek Pardon for Transgressions and Petition the True Ones**
*From the* True Writ Jade Formulae

**Supreme Petition Tablet for the Lingbao Tradition to Remove Transgressions and Seek Immortality at the Five Marchmounts and Sacred Mountains**

Lingbao so-and-so, Master of the Imperial Thearchs, your servant [Name], aged [X] years, born in the month of [X], fate governed by the Thearch of [X], name registered at [X] Marchmount. Aspiring to transcendence, aspiring to immortality, to attain long life and cross the world’s bounds, to soar and ascend to the Upper Clarity. O True Ones of the Five Marchmounts, most divine, most numinous: beseech that my transgressions be erased from the records, my name inscribed in the Nine Heavens. Petition to approach the sacred mountain, transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.

[Reign title, era name, year, month, first day, day, hour] at this [location] the proclamation is made.

These three tablet texts each include the year, name, and governing Thearch. The aspiration for transcendence and immortality, and the following text, are as stated in the Water Mansion’s earthen tablet and the Yellow Register’s water tablet. The sealing incantation of the Dragon-Wall Clasp is as in the previous fast’s method.

For the first casting of the three tablets, each uses nine clasps. For the second and third castings, only the dragon tablet is used, without clasps.

After casting is complete, scatter incense, pour forth water, and chant the hymn:

The Primal Beginning’s covenant shines,
Immortals’ names are inscribed.
The Three Offices, Nine Bureaus—
No transgression remains unremoved.
Scatter incense to the Five Thearchs,
Proclaim the covenant to the Great Void.
As petitioned, may I dwell
Through ten thousand kalpas.

Three bows.

With utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High, Boundless Dao.
With utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

The furnace is restored.
O Fragrant Officer Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Fragrant Spirits: may the place where your servant casts the tablet spontaneously generate golden liquor, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of true ones gather here, before the grotto’s furnace. May your servant, in learning the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying the words just proclaimed to the Most High, Boundless Dao, before the Sun Valley Divine King and the Nine Rivers’ Water Mansion and Water Thearch.

Each: three bows.

The *Primary School of Immortals’ Hymns* is sung as usual.

The Dao speaks: You who with sincere heart set forth upon the supreme Dao, desiring to deliver all celestial beings, all good men and women, from the Three Evils, the Five Paths, and the Eight Difficulties—may they transcend the Three Evils, and in every life encounter the Dao. On the days of the Eight Nodes and the first of the month, cast the Three Primes’ jade tablets. Erase the records of past transgressions, inscribe names in Heaven. After three offerings, the Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, and all celestial realms will relay the petition to Heaven.

To the right, distinguish the myriad spirits, reverently guard the Five Thearchs. Attend and protect the Three Realms, oversee the gates and portals. Purify Heaven and Earth; gods, earth deities, sun, and moon come to pay homage. A thousand demons, ten thousand spirits dare not rashly intrude. With steadfast resolve, all endeavors are fulfilled. Seven generations of ancestors are liberated; from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, they ascend to Heaven’s halls. Karmic retribution for good and evil in life and death is repaid in kind. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus record merits and transgressions—this principle is most clear. Through countless lives, not a hair’s breadth is lacking.

If there are those of utmost dedication—emperors, kings, rulers of lands, officials, all people, nine generations of ancestors, those trapped in the Three Paths of darkness—who undertake the great Yellow Register fast for three days and nights, proclaim the covenant to the Nine Heavens, and cast the Three Primes’ tablets, the blessings and benefits are boundless, beyond words. You who earnestly uphold this, do not grow lax or idle, lest demons mar your body.

Master Daoist Zhang Chengguang says: Upon ascending the altar and receiving the Lingbao Central Covenant, in accordance with the *Spontaneous Golden Regulations*, cast ten golden clasps, release the dragon into the clear spring—this is the way to seek immortality. Ascend the altar again to receive the Five Elders’ Red Writ, the Two Registers, staff, and scepter, and stabilize resolve through contemplation of the subtle. Following the *Luminous True Regulations*, cast the Three Dragons’ twenty-seven clasps, with the mountain, water, and dwelling as pledges for the study of immortality. Then, with the jade formula, separately cast nine dragons’ twenty-seven clasps, and on the Eight Nodal Days cast the mountain, water, and dwelling tablets, forever erasing the records of transgressions and inscribing names in Heaven. Upon concluding the Yellow Register fast, cast the dragon tablet as well, following only the Three Primes’ tablet text, without additional proclamations or established oral formulae. The ignorant masses, passing this down, practice in confusion. In the past, I encountered my master, Lord Lu, who communed with spirits and entered the wondrous, whose words accorded with principle—none failed to evoke response.

The sublime resides in the heart, yet its writings lack ritual forms. If one merely copies and submits them according to the scriptural text, the mountain, water, and dwelling spirits will not be duly recorded—all actions, seen and unseen, will be reckless, greatly deviating from the Mysterious Tradition. Thus, I have composed these *Three-Part Petition Texts*, each addressed to its respective immortal bureau. Additionally, I have separately set forth *Three Tablet Ready-Made Formulae*. Now, if one follows these clearly in practice, one will surely receive the carving of one’s name in the registers and the erasure of transgressions, with one’s name recorded in the Nine Mysteries. This will elevate one’s family to prior glory, cause one’s studies to flourish, and secure immortality in life and death. I reveal this to my disciples, to be revered and kept secret.

Guangting states: The Great Dao, through the One *qi*, generates and transforms the Three Powers, shaping the myriad existences. Thus, the Three Primes’ courts were established to govern transgressions and blessings—namely, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who truly preside over the Three Primes. Human life and death, longevity and early demise, transgressions and goodness, fortune and misfortune—none are not bound to them. The *Three Register Tablet Texts* are likewise the canonical forms of the Three Primes. In the method of the fast, one should submit the three tablets to report to the Three Primes. Thus, the mountain tablet is submitted to the Heavenly Cavern of Prostration, petitioning the Celestial Official of the Upper Prime; the water tablet is submitted to the Numinous Spring Water Palace, reporting to the Water Official of the Lower Prime; and the earth tablet is submitted at the altar or dwelling, reporting to the Earth Official of the Middle Prime. Within the tablet texts, the titles and ranks of the true spirits are clearly set forth.

In recent times, only the mountain and water tablets have been submitted. However, in the regions beyond the Huai and Zhe rivers, the ritual of the three tablets has long been practiced. Now, upon examining the origins, I have found the texts recorded by Master Zhang Chengguang, which petition the Three Primes with great precision, leaving no doubt in the submission and offering of pledges. Thus, they may be followed as a permanent model. Not only in receiving the scriptures but also in submitting the three tablets and conducting the fast for deliverance, all depend on the Three Primes. If all three tablets are duly submitted, the tallying of meritorious deeds will reach the courts of the Three Officials. Those who cultivate and uphold this Way should not hesitate or doubt.

*Concluding the Fifty-Fifth Scroll of the* Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual
*Beginning the Fifty-Sixth Scroll of the* Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual

Revised by Master Du Guangting of the Tang, *Ritual of the Lantern*

The method of the ritual lantern originates from the *Golden Register* scriptures. In all fasts and Dao-trails, burning incense and kindling lanterns are the most urgent tasks. Incense conveys the heart’s sincerity and ascends to move the perfected spirits. Lanterns dispel darkness and illuminate the hidden, opening the underworld’s eternal night. Thus, the scriptures decree: burning incense and kindling lanterns illumine the blessed halls of all heavens above and the long-night hells below. Suffering souls and stagnant spirits, riding this radiance, may at last attain liberation.

Since lanterns must each follow their proper method, they are arrayed according to the fundamental numbers of the Five Phases: nine in spring, three in summer, seven in autumn, five in winter, and twelve in the four seasons. The positions of lanterns for all heavens, all earths, the Eight Trigrams, and the Nine Underworlds are arranged according to their directions in the complete register texts.

When incense is burned and invocations are chanted, blessings swiftly descend and misfortunes naturally dissolve. Whether on the night of the fast’s commencement or during its three- or seven-day course, lanterns are kindled according to the method. At dusk, when the Dao-trail concludes, the altar is exited. At the earth-gate, with hymns and banners, in measured and elegant steps, the master leads the assembled officials and disciples in circumambulation beneath the lanterns, chanting invocations at each position. After each invocation, the officials and disciples bow. Upon completion, with a resonant, empty tone, they are guided back before the Mystic Master. The dispersal follows the usual ritual.

*Hymn of the Illumined Lantern*
The Most High scatters light in the ten directions,
Floral lanterns convey pure sincerity.
All heavens glow resplendent,
All earths shine with clarity.
My body, too, becomes luminous,
The five viscera blossoming in splendor.
The blazing radiance illumines the Great Void,
Far-reaching thoughts reach the Jade Capital.

This hymn is chanted in a drawn-out voice in the eastern regions of Songshan, the Yellow River, and Tonghua. At dusk, ascending the altar, the master of invocations is led beneath the lanterns. When the lantern ritual begins, this hymn is chanted first, and the assembly circumambulates the lanterns once, then arranges ranks at the earth-gate to chant invocations, thus fulfilling the ritual.

The officials arrange their ranks at the earth-gate. The master speaks:

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and Great Void declare: Yin and yang conjoin in form, heaven and earth divide in shape. Day and night differ, light and darkness diverge. Thus, the pure and ethereal manifest as the abodes of immortals and sages in all heavens, while the turbid and dense flow into the realms of ghosts and spirits in all earths. Above the Nine Heavens, yin qi is wholly dispelled; below the Nine Earths, yang radiance is forever barred. In these shadowed realms, no light remains. At midday, they are veiled in thick mist; at dusk, they sink deeper into gloom. The souls of the long night have no means to awaken. Some beings, devoid of good karma and burdened by past sins, have since their deaths sunk into hell, enduring myriad torments, imprisoned in Fengdu. Deprived of the Three Luminaries, they suffer for kalpas uncounted.

Our Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, opens many gates of salvation. He bequeaths the scripture of kindling lanterns to continue the light and illumine the night. Where the numinous radiance reaches, sins and afflictions are all dispelled. Through the merit of repentance and deliverance, they may fulfill the vow of rebirth.

If there are good men and good women who arouse the mind for the supreme Dao, follow the regulations, and come to the fast, preparing incense and oil, they may kindle lanterns on behalf of the sovereign, the emperor, the ruler and ministers, fathers and sons, the Three Wretched Paths, and the Nine Nights—whether in darkness or light—illuminating within and without according to the method. Above, they reflect upon the heavens and the halls of blessings; below, they shine upon the Nine Earths and the depths of hell.

May the suffering souls be delivered, the benighted spirits illuminated. Shall the nine generations ascend to heaven? The Three Wretched Paths cease their accusations. Blessings extend to all, and merit knows no bounds. Know then that such a person, having accumulated good causes over kalpas, shall surely attain the Dao.

Now, so-and-so official, so-and-so, has established the *Huanglu Lingbao* fast, following the ritual texts to kindle lanterns in offering. May it be that the emperor enjoys blessings, the Three Luminaries shine brightly, the seven generations ascend to heaven, and the Three Paths become radiant and serene. In this life, may divine spirits venerate and protect, true sages guard and sustain. May the fortune be majestic, and the immortal fruit be eternally attained.

The disciple bows twice.

May my seven ancestors be liberated, together ascending the Great Void.

The *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: The *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity* bear the weightiest merit. Above, they illuminate the heavens; below, they illuminate the earth. For eight directions and nine nights, all witness the radiance. Those who behold these lanterns shall have their sins extinguished and blessings arise. The one who kindles the lanterns shall receive profound fortune. Their nine generations of ancestors shall ascend to paradise, departing sorrow and suffering, forever escaping the Nine Dark Realms. They shall roam freely in the Upper Prime, within the immortal palaces. The living shall know peace, descendants shall flourish, households shall be purified, and myriad calamities shall not encroach. The living and the dead shall be delivered, and all shall bear the grace of life and death. The merit is boundless, and all aspirations shall be fulfilled. For family and nation, all shall enjoy prosperity and harmony. For nine nights and the Three Wretched Realms, all shall ascend the true Dao. Universally, we revere the Supreme Honored One.

Next, recite the *Lesser Immortal Hymn of Praise*, lead to the presence of the Mysterious Master, and disperse according to the usual rites. Extinguish the lanterns at dawn.

The *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, the officials responsible for the lanterns must diligently attend to their duties. Ensure the lanterns’ light shines brightly throughout the night, without extinguishing midway. If they dim partially, the one responsible shall incur fault—this must be heeded with care.

The *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, extinguish the lanterns at dawn. The Dharma Master recites the incantation:
*"The mysterious Yin seals its light, the eternal lanterns continue to shine.*
*The Great Yang has dawned, the Eight Dark Realms open and clear.*
*The lanterns return to the Great Yin, their light merging with the radiant essence.*
*The Two Perfected Ones of Sun and Moon unite with me."*
Upon completing the incantation, extinguish the lanterns.

Whenever conducting the *Yellow Register Fast*, one must follow the true texts and jade instructions. Apart from kindling lanterns in the four seasons, separately kindle the various lanterns of the *Golden Register* according to the rites, completing the bows and incantations. Whether performing the rites for three consecutive days or completing the bows and incantations in a single night, all shall receive blessings and benefits, and both the living and the dead shall partake of grace. Even without a fast altar, one may specially kindle these lanterns. Following the rites with bows and incantations, the merit shall be equivalent. Those who revere goodness should widely propagate this.

Alternatively, within the fast, kindle the *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns* and perform the separate rites of bows and incantations. Even without a fast, one may specially kindle the *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns* for the living or the dead, also performing the separate rites of bows and incantations. The ritual procedures are appended below.

**Rites and Incantations for the Nine Dark Realms Spirit Lanterns**

The *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, to eliminate celestial calamities for the emperor and rulers, rectify the celestial divisions, pacify the myriad people, and deliver the living and the dead, kindle the *Nine Dark Realms Spirit Lanterns*. Above, they illuminate the nine celestial halls of fortune; below, they illuminate the nine dark realms of hell. Both humans and heavens receive grace, and the living and the dead bear the favor.

The *Wondrous Scripture of the Nine Perfected Marvelous Precepts and the Golden Register for Deliverance* states: Across the eight directions of heaven and earth lie the nine dark realms of hell. The tormented and exiled sinful souls arise from the sins committed in life and death. After their bodies perish, they sink into the Three Wretched Realms, enduring retribution endlessly, with no means of liberation. In the eternal night, they never behold light. Were it not for the great sages’ compassion and the opening of karmic deliverance by good causes, they would dwell in darkness forever, their suffering unending through eons. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy established the statutes, composing the *Lantern-Kindling Rites*.

Following the radiance of the western sun, its light illumines the depths of the Yellow Springs. Where its flowing brilliance reaches, the suffering of forsaken souls is stilled. Where its divine splendor shines, the anguish of the dark and forlorn ceases. The merit of kindling lanterns brings boundless blessings—whether to deliver the departed or to dispel calamity and remove misfortune.

One should prepare fragrant oil and journey to the sacred temples. With sincere devotion, bow in reverence, and with utmost piety, gaze upon the true numina. Burn incense, kindle lanterns, and offer rites with vows and worship. Through earnest sincerity and heartfelt devotion, the power of blessings extends. The departed ascend to heaven, and the living receive grace. The doctrine of karmic retribution fully encompasses the law of cause and effect. The *Golden Register*, *Nine Dark Realms*, and *Numinous Treasure* scriptures briefly expound its principles; here, we shall not elaborate further.

As for the *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns*, one must procure pure and fragrant oil, refraining from wealth obtained through unrighteous means or impure, defiled substances. Alternatively, infuse various incenses into the oil, so that the lamp’s flame burns with purity, diffusing its fragrance. Above, it moves the heavens; below, it purges foul impurities. The lantern’s light shines brightly, dispelling darkness and continuing illumination—thus accruing great merit.

The *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns* should be arranged before the sacred altar in the grand hall of the multitude of sages, divided into nine trees. Align them according to the nine directions, with nine lamps on each tree. Alternatively, each tree may have nine tiers, with nine lamps per tier. The number nine times nine accords with the pattern of heaven and earth. Below, it opens the nine nights; above, it reaches the nine mysteries. Delivering the living and rescuing the dead is the most sacred of blessings. For those of limited means, even nine lamps suffice—full preparation is not required. In this rite, one need only burn incense and invoke the true, offering sincere prayers in silent devotion. The merit thus communicated is of the same essence.

Alternatively, one may prepare nine portions—or eighty-one—of water, congee, and seasonal fruits, arranging them before the nine directions, which is especially refined. Next, burn incense, meditate upon the deities, and strike the teeth twenty-four times. Then, make the invocation...

The officiant, your humble servant [Name], respectfully invokes the Local Domain True Officials, the Day-Directing Messengers, and the Void-Space Surveillance and Response Spirit Bureau. Now, on behalf of [Name] for [matter] at [location], we kindle the Nine Nights’ Spirit Lamps to beseech grace and bestow blessings.

Here ends the fifty-sixth scroll of the *Highest Clarity Yellow Register Fast Rites*.

*The Highest Clarity Yellow Register Fast Rites, Scroll Fifty-Seven*
*Edited by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting*

*The Eight Celestial True Writs*

The Yellow Register Fast is fundamentally purposed to deliver the souls of the departed, elevate the wandering spirits, open the path through the long night, and ferry the lost from the depths of the Yellow Springs. Yet its merit extends further: averting calamities and summoning blessings, atoning for transgressions and seeking grace, its cultivation spans the realms of humans and heavens, its benefits embrace both households and nations—no merit remains unbestowed.

The *Five Elders’ Vermilion Writs of the Numinous Treasure*, which it enshrines, serve four distinct functions when invoked in detail:

First, for seeking immortality and receiving the Dao: the twenty-four characters descending from the Nine Qi of the Eastern Direction.
Second, for warding off and restraining stellar influences: the thirty-two characters descending from Jupiter, the Liver-Assisting Star.
Third, for subduing and vanquishing demonic forces: the thirty-two characters descending from the Incantation of the Eastern Mountain Spirit.
Fourth, for dispelling and mitigating water-borne disasters: the thirty-two characters descending from the Subjugation of the Eastern River below.

The applications of these five writs are herein complete.

As recorded in the ritual canons of Celestial Master Zhang Wanfu of the Pure Capital Abbey in the Western Capital: the esoteric languages of the heavens and the *Eightfold Jade Scripts of the Assemblies* were expounded by the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning in the Fragrant Grove Garden to the Youth of Supreme Wisdom. They deliver from the Five Sufferings and universally rescue the Nine Nether Realms. In the rites for the transference of spirits, they are engraved upon stone and put into practice.

Here follows the translation:

For the present Yellow Register Fast and Altar rites, these texts are fitting for use. Whether in felicitous or inauspicious observances, their apportionment is just and proper. May they circulate for kalpas eternal.

The incantations are to be burned, the same as the true writs. There are established methods for this, to be jointly propagated.

Written on the fifth day of the tenth month, the *guiwei* day of the *xinyou* year of the Tianfu era (901), by Du Guangting, Feathered Robe of Tianmu Peak, in homage to the Sage.

All true writs are to be inscribed in cinnabar upon azure paper, together with the *Eight Hidden Characters of Heaven* and the *Jade Writs of the Central Heaven*, to guard the five directions of the fast altar. On the eve of the rite, the texts are read aloud; thereafter, a golden dragon is placed to secure them. Upon the dispersal of the altar, the texts are read aloud at night, whereupon the disciple holds them above the incense smoke. When the Dharma Master completes the incantation, they are burned in accordance with the memorial casket, precisely as prescribed in the *Rites of the Numinous Treasure True Writs*.

Thereafter, the disciple holds the writ above the incense smoke. The Dharma Master strikes his teeth twelve times and recites the incantation:

O Supreme Perfected, Great Sage, Lofty Venerable,
Who disseminates transformation and governs the qi of the Thirty-Two Heavens,
Whose Eight Assemblies and Nine Radiances naturally form writs,
Who pacifies and guards heaven and earth, preserving and regulating the kalpas,
Whose primordial mandate from the Originator is universally proclaimed to the Three Primes,
Who commands the Nine Earths below and seals the manifold heavens above,
Who announces to the seas and mountains, the famous peaks and great rivers:
Today, this proclamation is made on high, and the myriad spirits all hear it.
As your disciple performs the fast and practices the Dao to deliver and cross over the souls of the dark realms,
May the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus erase and extinguish the roots of sin.
May the sources of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings be forever crossed,
And may blessings be received life after life, with names inscribed in the cinnabar register.
May spirits be born in heaven, refined and transformed by nature.
May the gates of life and death be opened and the passage granted,
That they may abide for kalpas eternal.
The mandate of the Nine Heavens is transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

Again, bow in reverence.

**The Fifty-Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual Concludes**
**The Fifty-Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual**
*Edited by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting*

**Ritual for Repentance and Supplication to Cure Illness**
**Preliminary Reverence to the Directions**

We, your disciples, wholeheartedly take refuge in and submit to the Eastern Direction’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Nine *Qi* Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Eastern Realm.
*Three bows, each with utmost sincerity and repentance.*
*The other directions follow this pattern.*

**Repentance**

**Eastern Direction**
We, your disciples, on behalf of the official so-and-so and the individual so-and-so, perform the fast and practice the Dao, taking refuge in and submitting to the Eastern Direction’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage Host, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Eastern Realm.
Now, we kindle incense, take refuge, and offer repentance. Your disciple so-and-so, in past lives, this life, and through kalpas uncounted,
Has offended above against the Nine *Qi* Heavens of the East, the Wood Bureau’s palace, the Azure Emperor’s court, the stellar deities of Jupiter’s Wood virtue—Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, Ji—and the Azure Dragon’s spirits.
Has offended below against Gou Mang, the Spring King; the Yin-Yang of the Wood phase—Jia, Yi, the Azure Dragon, and Lesser Yang; the cyclical spirits of the Merit Clerk; the directional spirits of the Grand Thoroughfare; the *qi* of the Spring Equinox; the might of thunder and lightning; the Zhen trigram of the Xuanyuan; and the host of the Azure Emperor’s deities.
These accumulated sins and grievous transgressions have bound us above to the palaces and bureaus of the Eastern Direction’s Boundless Realm, forming calamities and misfortunes that have persisted through generations.
Today, through repentance and supplication, we humbly beseech their complete eradication.
May it be granted that the Emperor be securely enthroned and the nation’s fortune flourish.
May the state and household receive blessings, and the realm be enveloped in grace.
May your disciple so-and-so’s souls in the Nine Dark Realms be released, and the seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven.
May disasters and misfortunes be dissolved, and blessings and fortune be boundless.
After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the realm of Non-Action,
In harmony and union with the Dao, becoming true.

**Southeastern Direction**
We, your disciples, on behalf of the official so-and-so and the individual so-and-so, perform the fast and practice the Dao, taking refuge in and submitting to the Southeastern Direction’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage Host, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southeastern Realm.
Now, we kindle incense, take refuge, and offer repentance. Your disciple so-and-so, in past lives, this life, and through kalpas uncounted,
Has offended above against the Southeastern Direction’s Brahman *qi* Heavens, the Wind Bureau’s palace, the Yellow Emperor’s deities of late spring, the Celestial Stem’s position, and the directional spirits of Chen and Xun.
Against the Four Palaces of the Victorious Serpent, the *qi* of the Beginning of Summer, and the numina of the altars of soil and grain.
These offenses have bound us above to the palaces and bureaus of the Southeastern Direction’s Boundless Realm, forming calamities that have persisted through generations without resolution.
Through today’s repentance and supplication, we humbly beseech their complete eradication.
