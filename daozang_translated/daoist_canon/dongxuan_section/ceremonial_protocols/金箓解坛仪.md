**Striking the Ritual Drum Twenty-Four Times (Wū fǎ gǔ èrshísì tōng)**
The Supreme Three Heavens—*Xuán Yuán Shǐ* (Mysterious Primordial Origin) and the Three *Qi*—the Most High Sovereign of the Dao (Tàishàng Lǎojūn),
summons forth his ministers: the Three-Five Functionaries, the Left and Right Officials, the Messengers, the Left and Right Attendants bearing incense, the Dragon-Cavalry Officers of the Sacred Relay, the Golden Boys who serve incense, the Jade Girls who convey messages and scatter flowers, and the Thirty-Six Officers of the Five Sovereigns, each bearing a talisman, a direct seal, and the Sun’s incense.

**Those who appear** must don their formal robes and adorned headgear, their sashes and trailing plumes.
**The ritual opens the Dark Altar and the local deities**, as well as the spirits of the domain.

「Now the臣 humbly dissolves the altar and dismisses the assembly, reporting the completion of the rites and humbly presenting their sincerity.

With reverence, the臣 obeys and receives the Sacred Lord’s manifold precious *dharma* (丹悃), fully inscribed and sealed in the scriptures.

May the Supreme Lord’s most exalted and true Dao/Way’s *qi* (炁), the luminous treasure of the Mysterious Primordial Origin, descend and flow into the臣’s body, so that the臣’s invoked sincerity swiftly reaches the Most High Sovereign’s presence—before the Supreme and True, Boundless Dao/Way of the Three Pure Ones and the Most Holy Celestial Emperor of Golden Gates and Jade Sovereign.

The臣 requests that the sacred rank be proclaimed, and the臣 and all others of their law, past and present, now burn incense and surrender their bodies, their spirits, and their fates to the Supreme, Ten-Directions Illuminous Treasure, the Natural and True, Boundless Dao/Way.

The臣 hears that the Three *Qi* (箓) were bestowed as teachings, and the Five *Sutra* (篇) were established as models. The Dao/Way’s edicts flourish, and the Mysterious winds are grandly expounded. The rites were founded in imitation of Heaven and likeness of Earth, invoking the dark and summoning the bright to stabilize and pacify the celestial scriptures and clouds.

The Thousand True Ones descend their chariots, and the Ten Thousand Saints appear at the hall. The solemn vows ascend to the layered heavens, while the divine presence descends to the sacred assembly. The臣 prays for Heaven’s eternal command and gathers blessings to prolong auspiciousness.

Now, having fulfilled their vows and completed the morning rites, the臣 dissolves the altar and dismisses the assembly, first confessing their shortcomings. May the Sacred Lord bestow favorable omens and secure the stability of the ancestral lineage and state.

The Golden Dragon’s scripture rises, celebrating the perfect completion of the *jiào* (醮) rites; the Jade *Wèi* (纬) shines forth, descending abundant blessings of prosperity. The invoked Mysterious responses ascend directly to the Most High Sovereign’s presence—before the Supreme and True, Boundless Dao/Way.

The rites are now complete, and the臣, along with all who follow the law, wholeheartedly repent and confess. They surrender their bodies, their spirits, and their fates to the Supreme, Boundless Dao/Way of the Illuminous Treasure, Heaven’s Most Exalted Lord.

With humble reverence, the臣 awaits the Great Compassion’s boundless grace, hoping for the vast mercy that permeates all. They pray that the Sacred Lord’s abundant blessings descend upon them as they dissolve the assembly, conclude the fast, and burn incense in homage to the Saints.

The臣 hears that the scriptures and transmitted teachings of the Jade Precepts (玉局) prescribe the Mysterious *Sutra* (玄灵) for the rites of averting calamity, and the Golden Precepts (金科) of the Purple Extremes (紫极) grant petitions of prayer and supplication.

The臣 and their followers, in obedience to the Imperial edicts, solemnly revere the Golden *Qi* (箓) and gather grand auspicious blessings, establishing the Orchid Field (兰场) and spreading the Mysterious models (玄范). They fear that their ascent and descent may deviate from the Secret Rituals (密勿), or that their reverence may fail to align with the Sacred Reflections (精修).

At this moment of dissolving the assembly, they earnestly offer their first confession of transgressions. With humble reverence, the臣 hopes that the Four Officials and Five Sovereigns will specially extend their forgiveness, and the Nine Departments and Three Officials will generously bestow their purifying grace.

With the rites perfected and the fruits fulfilled, may the blessings endure as long as Earth and Heaven. All wishes shall be granted, and their sincerity shall be clearly revealed.

The臣 and their followers bow their heads in devotion, offering three salutations and three rites of gratitude to the Supreme Three Treasures (三宝). Three salutations, three rites.»

The **Ritual of Invoking the True Scriptures**—with repeated invocation of the sacred ranks—**the humble臣**, surname [Certain], in earnest reverence, humbly presents this petition to the **Supreme Dao of the Unexcelled and Limitless Way, the Primeval Sovereign of Heaven** (太上无极大道元始天尊),
the **Supreme Dao Sovereign** (太上道君),
the **Supreme Lord of the Dao** (太上老君),
the **Unexcelled Mysterious Elder, the Tenfold Sacred Treasures of All Directions, the Sovereign of Heaven** (无上玄老十方灵宝天尊),
the **already attained Dao Immortals and Great Saints** (已得道大圣众),
the **Most Authentic Celestial Lords and Venerable Masters** (至真诸君丈人),
the **Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures** (三十六部尊经),
the **Great Lawmaster of the Mysterious** (玄中大法师),
the **Great Lawmaster of the Three Heavens** (三天大法师),
the **Supreme Chancellor and Prime Minister, Supreme Guardian and Preceptor, Four Teachers and Five Sovereigns** (上相上宰、上保上傅、四师五帝),
the **Celestial Astral Hall and Martial Array, the River and Milky Way’s Multitudes of Immortals, the officials of the Three Realms** (星宫斗府、河汉群真、三界官属),
and **all manner of august and numinous beings** (一切威灵).

**The臣** and their followers, through past karmic ties, humbly encounter this sacred era (恭逢圣运).
Now, having completed the morning rites and fulfilled the ceremonial audience, **the臣** gathers this auspicious cause to pray:
*"May the Imperial Vision and Heavenly Broadness be ever renewed,
And the Sovereign’s Virtue daily flourish.
May the years be as vast as the **Arrow and Dipper Constellations** (箕翼),
And the lifespan as firm as the **Heavenly Cauldron** (中壶) and the **Ganling Mountains** (固冈陵).
May the ancestral and branch states remain steadfast as protective screens,
And the heirs extend the blessings of longevity.
May the ministers be wise and virtuous,
And the people rejoice in nurturing governance."*

Humbly praying that **the Sovereign’s benevolent will ascend above**,
And **the radiant grace descend below** (景贶下临).
May the realm and its borders be harmonized by signs of peace,
And the ancestral temple and state be united by omens of perfect auspice (元吉).

**The臣** follows the prescribed rituals, erecting a pure altar,
And offers sincere devotion, mirroring Heaven and modeling Earth (法天像地).
May the Six Dynasties’ Dao be fulfilled,
And all thoughts return to the True Way (一念皈真).
When the merit is complete and the rites perfected,
May the Celestial Hosts return to their proper stations (诸天复位).

**The臣’s** retinue, including those bearing official insignia and those performing duties at the altar,
All who respond to summons, guard the sacred rites, and maintain the fasts—
Together, they have rendered meritorious service (并有勋绩).
Thus, **the臣** respectfully declares their deeds,
And presents their sincere petition (进呈素悃),
Seeking, according to the established grades, a special grant of mercy.
Humbly praying for **the Supreme Three Treasures’** compassionate favor (特乞慈容).

All memorial texts are now respectfully submitted for proclamation.
**Proclamation of the Memorial** (宣表).

Return the memorial tablet and burn the **Twelve Vows**, preserving the spirit while offering incense.
The incense officials and messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of incense—
Let them now command that the places where **the臣** formerly dissolved the altar and dispersed the feast
Shall naturally give rise to golden elixirs, blue-green herbs, and the hundred spirits of the elysian realm,
All converging here before the incense brazier.

**First Wish:** May the ten-direction celestial youths and jade maidens receive **the臣’s** sincere petition,
And through fragrant clouds swiftly convey it to the **Supreme Dao of the True and Limitless Great Way**,
Before the **Three Pure Ones**, the **Most High Sovereign of the Golden Gate**, the **Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven**,
And the **Celestial Sovereign’s** august presence.

**Exiting the Hall and Reciting Praises, Descending the Altar:**
At the city gates, **the臣** stands to take leave of the **Three Treasures**,
Having completed the morning rites and presented the response to the clouds.
**The Dao** transcends emptiness, its grace encompassing the world.
The imperial plan endures as the earth, the sacred life matching the heavens.

**Bowing in reverence and taking leave of the Ten-Direction Dao Treasures:**
The golden boys record virtues, the jade maidens proclaim merits.
Names inscribed on golden tablets, scriptures stored in sacred repositories.
May **the Sovereign’s** majesty be honored, blessings gathered for the realm.

**Bowing in reverence and taking leave of the Ten-Direction Scripture Treasures:**
The **chime’s** echoes fade, the sacred seals dissolve into mist.
The master returns to **Tai Qing**, blessings flowing to the family and state.
The **Mysterious Wind** spreads far, the **Dao’s** transformations flourish.

**Bowing in reverence and taking leave of the Ten-Direction Teacher Treasures:**
May all sentient beings refrain from evil and cultivate goodness,
Free from karmic bonds, ever dwelling in an age of prosperity.
All conscious beings together realize **non-action (wuwei)**.

**Bowing in reverence and taking leave of the Ten-Direction Holy Ones:**
**The臣** formerly led the procession to the **Hall of Silent Contemplation**,
To thank the master—
Now the **golden talisman** is dissolved, the altar rites concluded.
