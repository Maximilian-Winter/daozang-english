**Golden Seal Tenfold Rites of Salvation for Humanity—Late Rite Opening Ceremony**
*(After the Fast of Pure Intentions)*

**Threefold Refuges**
**Praise of Past Lives**
Though one has faith in past lives, the weak and bereaved are called without.
All wish to behold the present, yet upon seeing, they speak of the boundless.

Great sages teach the Dao/Way with clarity,
Their sorrowful pity extends to the obstinate.

With deep compassion, they ponder our suffering,
Their earnestness brings me grief.

**Recitation of the Ninth Rite’s Opening Scripture**

With reverence, I present the **Tongxuan Red Scriptures** with **voided green and purple characters**—
Nine radiant clouds blaze with color, all bearing the **lustrous golden rays and jade inscriptions**;
Eight dragons form the text, their strokes **chiseled from jade and cast in gold**.

Hidden within the **Upper Purity Domain (上清之境)** and the **Cold Spirit Hall (寒灵之殿)**,
They rest upon the **erect void table (立空之案)** and the **frosted silk cloth (霜罗之巾)**.
The sun and moon rely upon them to move eternally, never ceasing;
The sovereigns receive them to safeguard the realm, ensuring **enduring peace for ten thousand generations**.

Oh, how magnificent and abundant they are—
None can surpass them!

Now, I humbly follow the imperial edict,
Diligently crafting the **Golden Seal**,
Extending the **auspicious fast (延禧大斋)** for several days and nights.

I lead the officials and congregation,
Ascending the platform for the **ninth recitation** of the *Supreme Lord’s Tongxuan Lingbao Sutra of Infinite Salvation for Humanity (太上洞玄灵宝无量度人上品妙经)*,
Offering homage to the **Sacred Edicts (宝诰)**,
And with utmost devotion, relying upon the **Supreme Three Treasures (无上三宝)**—
The **Merciful Sovereign (慈尊)** and the **Sage Lords of the Ten Directions (十方诸天大圣)**,
Their **compassionate vows and mighty power (慈悲愿力)**,
And the **sacred efficacy of the scriptures (主盟经功)**.

I pray that the **Mysterious Truth (玄真)** may illuminate**,
And the **Supreme Saints (上圣)** guide us with their hands.

May the **Divine Radiance (神光)** illuminate our **source of wisdom (慧源)**,
And the **Dao/Way’s vital essence (道炁)** flow through our **spiritual faculties (灵府)**.

Thus, may we **study with utmost care and ponder deeply**,
Never neglecting the **great principles** we can attain;
And **search for hidden meanings and probe profound truths**,
Certainly comprehending the **utterances of ultimate wisdom** before ceasing.

May our merit benefit **all beings of land and water (水陆)**,
And our virtue extend to **the realm and the people (邦家)**.

With bowed head to the **Void Sovereign (虚皇)**,
We practice the **sacred scriptural methods (经法)**.

**Seated Chant (敷座吟)**
*(After the sutra recitation concludes)*

**Dissolution Chant (解座吟)**
*(After the recitation concludes and the assembly disperses)*

**Transfer of Merit (回向)**
With reverence, I offer the number nine—
the apex of yang—
to invoke the **Celestial Pure (天真)**.

The **Hexagram of Releasing (兑)** signifies the completion of gold,
so I vent my gratitude to the **Earthly Treasure (地藏)**.

The heavens do not cherish the Dao/Way,
yet scriptures emerge in the world;
the earth does not treasure jewels and gems,
yet gold and jade manifest in form.

In days of old, **Laozi** descended upon **Chu’s capital (蜀都)**,
and the earth surged forth a jade array;
the **Void Sovereign (虚皇)** wandered the western lands,
and the earth naturally presented yellow gold.

For the divine efficacy transcends prescription—
its numinous responses are ever constant.

Now, having led the assembly,
I ascend the platform and recite the *Supreme Scripture of the Dao/Way’s Numinous Treasure (太上洞玄灵宝无量度人上品妙经)* in its ninth circuit,
directing my transfer of merit to:
the **Supreme Sovereign of the Upper Void’s Numinous Treasure (上方无极太上灵宝天尊)**,
the **Supreme Sovereign Who Protects Life and Body (上方保命护身天尊)**,
the **Star Lord of the Celestial Enclosure (天垣帝座星君)***,
the **Star Lords of the Purple Micro Enclosure (紫微垣列位星君)***,
the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (中天北斗七元星君)***,
all the **stars of the Three Palaces, Five Canopies, and Central Court (三台华盖中宫一切星众)***,
the **Supreme Great God of the Upper Void’s Infinite Grade (上方无极无量品至真大神)***,
the **Flying Celestial Sovereign of Longevity, the Great Saint Who Transcends Measure (飞天神王长生大圣无量度人君)***,
the **Sovereign Deity of My Original Fate and the Auspicious Horse (本命太岁禄马尊神)***,
and the **Divine Officials of the Purple Hall (紫堂神煞官属)**,
so that the **auspicious spirits (真灵)** of the hall may respond in kind.

I beseech these **divine powers (神功)** and **meritorious vows (愿力)**
to stabilize the **Purple Micro (紫微)** in the central heavens,
to extend life and safeguard destiny,
and to gather blessings and celebrate prosperity.

May I, with utmost devotion,
inscribe these merits upon **jade tablets and molten gold**,
to manifest the **auspicious signs of linked pearls and paired jades (连珠合璧之祥)**.

「齐七政在玉衡，靡差躔次；
The **Seven Celestial Officials (七政)*** align at the **Jade Balance (玉衡)**, without deviation in their **proper stations (躔次)**.

「转一炁开寿域，俱入钧陶。
The **transformation of the singular *qi* (一炁)*** unfolds the **Realm of Longevity (寿域)**,
all entering the **Mandate of the Celestial Weaver (钧陶)***).

「福佑邦家，恩沾海宇。
Blessings grace the **state and clan (邦家)***,
favor permeates the **four quarters of the world (海宇)**.

「稽首归依，旋行赞咏。
With bowed head, I take refuge,
and swiftly recite hymns of praise.

**太极颂**
**The Ode to the Supreme Ultimate (太极)**
The **Dao/Way (大道)** though heartless,
can be sought with earnest feeling.
It rides the **void of the heavens (空洞)***,
swirling through the **mists of the Azure River (翳沧流)**.
Beyond the **Three Pure Realms (三界)*** stands **Luminous Clarity (净明)***,
where the **Celestial Capital of Jade (玉京)*** drifts serene.
From **primordial darkness (无玄)*** to **profound transformation (挺运)***,
who can fathom its **mystic allure (冥趣)**?
Descending through the **celestial river (天汉)*** in resplendent splendor,
it bends to **Yin’s gentle yielding (虚柔)***.
The **Seven Mysteries (七玄)*** scatter through the **profound night (幽夜)***,
returning to **embryonic rebirth (返胎)*** and harmonizing with **submergence and ascent (顺沈浮)**.
In the **hidden cycle (冥期)***, if one but **conceals and condenses (潜凝)***,
the **Nine Yangs (阳九)*** know no **pleasure nor sorrow (娱忧)**.
Beholding this **union of departure and return (去来会)***,
who could linger in **mire and delay (淹留)**?

「外身而身存，真仙会良俦。
Beyond the **physical form (外身)*** yet the **self remains (身存)***,
the **true immortals (真仙)*** gather in **auspicious assembly (良俦)***.

**高功於上方恭文**
**The Highest Merit of the Reverent Scripture of the Upper Void (上方恭文)**
I proclaim the **Ninefold Return (九回)***,
unfolding the **scripture’s profound text (经文)**.
The **Highest Rank of the Way of Transformation (上品度人)***,
a treasure shared by all the **heavens (诸天)**.
**Luminous Truth (明真)*** has its **fixed measure (有格)***,
and must be transmitted across **forty thousand kalpas (四万劫)***.

Thus, when the **true scripture descends to the world (真经降世)***,
the **ten directions all turn to it (寰宇向风)**.
When **Xu Xun and Ge Xuan (徐葛)*** pass it on,
the **Lingbao teachings (灵宝之科)*** are fully revealed.
When **Lin Wang (林王)*** succeeds them,
the **Dao of the Celestial Tower (神霄之教)*** is restored.

Then do the **methods of cultivating *qi* and nurturing life (服气养生)***,
and the **arts of safeguarding the state and bringing peace to the family (保国宁家)***,
appear in layered succession.
Orderly and precise (井井乎),
its **paths are harmonized, encompassing all (条兼容并包)**；
Vast and comprehensive (恢恢乎),
its **teachings leave no gap (不漏其道)**。
Truly great! Even the **sages (圣)***
could add no more.

「臣今钦奉纶音，崇修金箓，延禧大斋几昼夜。
I now, with reverence, follow the **imperial edict (纶音)***,
and solemnly practice the **golden talismans (金箓)***,
prolonging the **great fast of auspicious virtue (延禧大斋)*** for several days and nights.

「臣今引领官众，升坛第十回转诵《太上洞玄灵宝无量度人上品妙经》，朝礼宝诰，仰依无上三宝慈尊、十方诸天大圣，慈悲愿力，主盟经功。
I now lead the **assembly of officials (官众)***,
ascending the **altar (升坛)*** to the **tenth cycle of recitation (第十回转)***,
chanting the **Supreme Ultimate’s Profound and Mystic Scripture of the Lingbao Dao for the Highest Rank of Transformation (太上洞玄灵宝无量度人上品妙经)***,
paying homage to the **precious decrees (宝诰)*** in the morning,
and relying upon the **infinite merit of the Three Treasures (无上三宝)***,
the **Compassionate Sovereigns (慈尊)*** of the **ten directions (十方)***,
the **great saints of the heavens (诸天大圣)***,
and the **merits of boundless compassion and vows (慈悲愿力)***,
to pledge the **scripture’s efficacy (经功)***.

「伏愿於皇大道，有赫高真。
With deepest aspiration, may I, in the **Imperial Dao/Way (皇大道)***,
manifest the **radiant highest truth (赫高真)***.

「成周回十过之功，尽终始一经之义。」
To fulfill the **merits of ten complete cycles (周回十过)***,
and to exhaust the **principles of this single scripture (终始一经)*** in their entirety.

The eight directions and six harmonies,
all bathed in the **Dao/Way’s benevolent winds (仁风)**;
every inch of earth, every measure of heaven,
none failing to be nourished by the **Dharma’s rain (法雨)**.

Together on the sacred platform, the pure assembly
resonates with wondrous **spiritual sounds (灵音)**.
With deepest reverence to the **Vast Sovereign (虚皇)***,
we practice the **scripture’s methods (经法)**.

Seated, we chant and recite—
when the scripture is finished,
we rise and recite—
then dedicate with **sincere aspiration (回向)**.
The **meritorious work (高功)** remains as at its beginning.

With reverence, I recite the **true essence of the Highest Rank (上品之真)**,
and must complete ten cycles to fulfill its measure;
I cultivate the **sacred embryo’s method (圣胎之法)**,
requiring ten months to achieve its fruition.

The **tripod’s alchemy follows the patterns of Heaven and Earth (鼎器法乎乾坤)**,
its **fires and timing drawn from the *Gua* of Reunion and Meeting (火候取於复姤)**.
Thus, the **mystic pearl takes form (玄珠有象)**,
and the **jade tones become manifest (玉音成形)**.

Within me, it returns to the **Root of Command (复命归根)**—
**pure yang envelops the body (纯阳被体)**;
bestowed upon others, it **prolongs life and preserves the vital breath (延生保命)**,
granting longevity in this world (**在世长年**).

For the **scripture’s efficacy (经功)** and the **Dao/Way’s elixir (丹道)**,
their principles converge in unity.
To the **scholar-saints and perfected ones (学士至人)**,
its practice reveals itself in truth.

Now, leading the officials, I ascend the platform
to recite the **Supreme Ultimate’s Profound and Mystic Scripture of the Lingbao Dao for the Highest Rank of Transformation (太上洞玄灵宝无量度人上品妙经)**,
its tenth cycle completed.

I directly dedicate to:
the **Supreme Sovereign of the Lingbao Dao of the Boundless Extremes (下方无极太上灵宝天尊)**,
the **Sovereign of Great Auspiciousness and Vast Power (下方兴大福力天尊)**,
the **Central Earthly Virtue Ancestral Qi Sovereign of the True Dao/Way of the Middle Emperor (中央土德祖炁中皇上真道君)**,
the **Star-Constellation True Lord (镇星真君)**,
the **Great Chief Star of the Central Dipper (中斗大魁星君)**,
the **Supreme Great God of the Boundless Extremes and Infinite Rank (下方无极无量品至真大神)**,
the **Flying Heaven God-King, the Long-Living Great Sage of Boundless Transformation (飞天神王长生大圣无量度人君)**,
the **Lordly Spirit of the Natal Year and Auspicious Horse (本命太岁禄马尊神)**,
and the **Purple Hall Spirit Officials and the assembled retinue (紫堂神煞官众)**,
all responsive to the **ascetic hall’s offerings (斋坛应感一切真灵)**.

I beseech, through the **merit and aspiration of the scripture (经功愿力)**,
to **settle and pacify the twelve divisions of the lower realm (下方十二分野所属之地)**.

With deepest aspiration, may the **Central Dipper’s spirits be unified (中斗总灵)**,
and the **four cardinal stars firmly established (镇星四据)**.

The **Celestial Array stands in ordered ranks, measuring the divisions of the Heavenly Cycle**;
**Receptive and expansive, they manifest auspicious omens across the cosmos.**

All beings born within the embrace of life
**Unite in gazing upon the radiant splendor.**

With deepest aspiration, may the **Mystic Transformations spread abroad**,
And **auspicious blessings gather in abundance.**

The **Ten Directions all be transformed by the Sacred Way**,
And the **myriad lands all return to the Supreme Benevolence.**

Even the **lowly and the noble alike**—
**All bathed in grace and virtue.**

With bowed heads, we take refuge and **circle in praise.**

---
**Ode to the Great Polarity**

**Endlessly drawn toward the Mystic Source,**
**Deeply immersed in the Pure Han’s waves.**
**Like the ceaseless cycle of transformation,**
**The sacred *chun* tree’s branches never fade.**

**With still mind, I invoke the Ultimate Truth,**
**Flowing naturally, free from entanglement’s snare.**
**Resonance and response are ever in accord,**
**Spirit and insight reach beyond the self.**

**At first, the wandering mind knows no bounds,**
**Yet through the Nine Clouds’ depths, all illusions dissolve.**
**The roots take flight, the Mystic Leaves disperse—**
**The Principle returns, yet nothing else remains.**

**Ever able to recite the Jade Tablet’s verse,**
**The Mystic Sound ascends through heaven’s glow.**

---
**In the Year of Jia-Shen, the Great Calamity came,**
**The Sovereign of the Azure Robes held dominion.**
**Forever enjoying the boundless age,**
**Who could know the eons’ endless span?**

**With reverence, I proclaim the Sacred Text’s power below—**
**The **Proclamation of the Sacred Flame’s Transformation.**

**Proclamation of the Sacred Text’s Universal Praise**

**Extol the Sacred Scripture’s profound words—**
**For though the Dao is beyond speech,**
**Without speech, the Dao cannot be transmitted.**
**The Scripture does not await recitation,**
**Yet through recitation alone does one truly know its depths.**

**In the chaos before form took shape,**
**What need had it of written scrolls?**

**With reverence, I honor the Great Luo Yuan-Shi, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord,**
**Who condensed the Brahmanic *qi* in the void of nothingness,**
**Refined the True Text through the cataclysm of ages.**
**Then, in the realm of the Azure Mists and Floating Mists,**
**He expounded the *Dongxuan Lingbao* Scripture.**

**He suspended a single grain of millet in the heavens,**
**Summoning all the Perfected Ones within the Pearl’s embrace.**
**He unfolded the most sublime mysteries,**
**Enlightening all sentient beings.**

**The *Hun-Dong* Red Text first revealed the wonders of the transformed heavens;**
**The *Yuan-Dong* Jade Calendar further illuminated the preservation of cosmic cycles.**
**Five chapters unfolded, ten cycles completed.**
**He then revealed the Great Brahman’s hidden speech and the *Ling Shu*’s central scroll,**
**Its radiance illuminating the ten directions, each character a yard in length.**
**All were the hidden rhymes of the Celestial Sovereign’s inner names,**
**Too profound for mortal scrutiny—**
**Until the Imperial Sage received command from the Heavenly Lord,**
**And expounded their meaning.**

**Above, it pacifies Heaven and steadies Earth;**
**Below, it enriches the people and brings prosperity.**
**Sealed in the Upper Palaces, it was not passed to later ages.**
**From when the Han Emperor Wu obtained it from the Western Queen Mother,**
**The Dao began its transmission;**
**When Xu the True Person bestowed it upon Ge the Immortal Elder,**
**The scripture’s reach expanded.**

**This, the peerless supreme text,**
**Stands alone as the master scroll of all volumes.**

**Now, we humble servants of the day,**
**With reverence following the Imperial Edict,**
**Cherish and uphold the Great Teaching,**
**Conducting the Golden Register’s grand rites,**
**Performing the ceremonies of salvation and scriptural transmission.**

**May all beneath Heaven witness, may the Perfected Ones uphold it.**
**The Jade Boys and Girls of the Five Emperors guard the sacred texts;**
**The Golden Tigers and Dragons of the Eight Powers protect the treasure scrolls.**
**Five colors flourish in auspicious display,**
**The four seasons clear and bright with omens.**

**Harmonizing the Celestial Patterns,**
**The Three Stars and Five Stars move in perfect order;**
**Stabilizing the land,**
**The Nine Regions and Four Seas enjoy eternal peace.**
**The Imperial lineage thrives, the people prosper.**
**Those who recite with understanding**
**Shall be unharmed, shall be liberated, shall be cleansed.**
**Heaven’s blessings descend upon them—**
**They shall know their name, their fortune, their longevity.**
**Then, their five-tiered kin and sixfold relations**
**Shall all dwell in security;**
**The subjects and neighbors of the Nine Regions and Four Seas**
**Shall all attain prosperity.**

**Roots and shoots flourish, each in its natural place;**
**Scales, shells, feathers, and fur all find boundless ease.**
**May all beings of the Three Realms with karmic ties**
**Together attain the supreme vehicle of One Ride.**

**With sincere devotion, the scriptures are received as law.**

**High Functionary’s Scripture-Receiving Praise**
**Threefold Hearing of the Scripture**
**Entrusted to the Officials**

**Reigniting the furnace, descending from the platform to offer thanks to the Spirit-King and the Master, then making merit by dedicating the golden *luò* (scripture) ten times for the liberation of others.**

**The Evening Court concludes the Scripture-Receiving Ceremony.**
