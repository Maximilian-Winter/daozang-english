**The Noon Rites for Circulating the Mysterious Numinous Scripture**

The ritual proceeds according to form.
All pay homage to the master and maintain visualization as prescribed.
Invite the recitation of the divine incantation:

*"The Supreme Mysterious One, the Nine Augusts exhale their essence.
Three, five, seven transformations—penetrating vision of the hidden and dark.
Sun and moon cast their radiance, descending to illumine the divine court.
Their brilliance spans the Six Directions; the Supreme One and August Sovereign attain tranquility.
The Imperial Lord of the Golden Portal, the golden script stands unshaken.
The Five Elders present the talisman; Heaven and Earth are perfected as one.
May I be free from delusion, attaining the true numen.
Repelling the myriad evils, calamities and harms are all pacified.
Ascending to the Heavenly August, returning from old age to infancy.
The Great Emperor issues his decree; the hundred spirits reverently heed."*

Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.

*"The Most High Three Heavens, the Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin, the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Riding Couriers bearing incense, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman Officials of the Day, each thirty-six in number, to emerge.
Emerging, they don their solemn attire, caps and sashes with pendants.
Notify the Land Spirit of the Mysterious Altar and the deities of the local domain.
At this noon hour, I ascend the altar to perform the Dao-circulation, paying homage to the Imperial Perfected.
Reverently offering these cinnabar sincerities, all recorded in sealed script.
May the auspicious radiance of the Most High, the Perfect Dao, the numinous treasure, descend and flow into our bodies.
May the sincerity of my supplication swiftly reach the presence of the Perfect and Boundless Great Dao of the Three Clarities, the Supreme Saints, the Purple Tenuity Northern Culmen Great Emperor, the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper."*

**Proclaiming the Dharma Titles:**

*"The undersigned official of such-and-such rank, [Name], together with the assembled altar officers, jointly and sincerely address the Most High and Boundless Great Dao, the Dipper Culmen Ancestral Master, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Dipper Culmen Mysterious Master, the Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure; the Dipper Culmen Ancestral Master, the Celestial Worthy of Dao and Virtue; the Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven; the Heavenly August Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity; the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen of Purple Tenuity; the August Star Lord of the Highest Jade Thearch within the Dipper; the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety; the Great Emperor Lord of the Mysterious Minister of the Northern Culmen; the Great Star Lord of Heavenly Hero, Greedy Wolf of the Northern Dipper; the Primordial Star Lord of Heavenly Task, Great Gate of the Northern Dipper; the True Star Lord of Heavenly Pivot, Salary-Existence of the Northern Dipper; the Star Lord of Heavenly Heart, Literary Curve and Tie of the Northern Dipper; the Star Lord of Heavenly Wings, Upright Integrity and Network of the Northern Dipper; the Star Lord of Heavenly Auxiliary, Martial Brilliance and Record of the Northern Dipper; the Star Lord of Heavenly Impulse, Broken Army and Pass of the Northern Dipper; the Star Lord of Luminous Cavern, Left Auxiliary of the Northern Dipper; the Star Lord of Hidden Radiance, Right Assistant of the Northern Dipper; the Nine August Ladies; the Nine Yin Consorts; the Heavenly Stem Marshal of the Myriad Perfected, the Radiant Star Lord of Striding Light; the Three Terraces and Canopy Star Lords within the Dipper; the Star Lord of One’s Life Destiny at Birth; the Star Lord of Longevity and Virtue of the Southern Culmen; the Star Lord of Blessing and Virtue of the Highest Clarity; the Star Lord of Emolument and Virtue of the Highest Clarity; the Star Governor Illuminating the Imperial Seat; the Twenty-Eight Constellation Star Lords; the Sixty Jiazi Star Lords; the Divine Host of the Officials of Dao and Virtue; the Perfected Lord of the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Perfected Lords of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters; the Nine Provincial Ministers of the Central Heaven; the Left and Right Embroidered-Robed Envoys; the Four Direct Jade Text Merit Officials; the Attendant Gentlemen; the Thousand Chariots and Ten Thousand Riders within the Dipper; and all true numina.
We reverently beseech your vast compassion to turn and manifest your luminous scrutiny.
I have heard that the ten administrations store essence, and the One Origin inaugurates the image."*

The wondrous qi of emptiness and non-being gives birth to the divine treasures in the Crimson Clarity; the perfected transformation-body expounds the true scriptures in Eternal Longevity. For the sake of sentient beings is the teaching established, and to the Great Sage is the numinous communion directed. Only the marvelous turning of yin and yang weighs upon the balance, while fortune and misfortune all proceed from the sovereign arbiter.

We, your servants, arrayed to the right of the altar in martial order and enrolled by name to the left, aspire to assist and exalt the true wind, and to open the bright dawn of wisdom’s sun. With exultant devotion we offer our vows, pledging their wide fulfillment.

Today, in reverent compliance with the imperial edict, we undertake the solemn rite of the Golden Register. We steadfastly observe the wondrous instructions and have long upheld the luminous statutes. Pouring water and offering flowers, we erect the jade altar to invoke the mandate; extending life and inscribing blessings, we knock upon the jade gates to dispatch our spirits. Surely you will not overlook our humble offerings, but regard the sincerity of our devotion.

At this noon audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists now raise the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High Perfect Dao-Treasure of the Great Luo, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy; the Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace; the Two Emperors of the Jade Dipper; the Nine August Star Lords; and the Perfected Immortals and Holy Host of the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.

We take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life, prostrating ourselves to the earth, reverently relying upon the Three Worthies of the Most High and the Holy Hosts of the Ten Directions. May the merit of this incense ascend to bless His Imperial Majesty. We humbly pray that the Dao harmonizes with the Two Modes, and virtue embraces the Four Images. Ever pure and ever tranquil, may the Eight Wastes proclaim the harmony of the Jade Candle; united in governance and script, may the Six Directions rejoice in the auspicious abundance of golden harvests.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, from taking refuge in our Master, the Great Sage Host, and the virtue of the Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, we may preserve heaven and endure forever, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

At this noon audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists now raise the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High Perfect Scripture-Treasure, the Jade Clarity Dao Lord; the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy; the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Central Palace of the North Pole; the Star Lord of Our Natal Destiny; the Star Governor Illuminating the Imperial Seat; and the Perfected Immortals and Holy Host of the Heaven of Yu-Yu.

We take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life, prostrating ourselves to the earth, reverently relying upon the Three Worthies of the Most High and the Holy Hosts of the Ten Directions. May the merit of this incense ascend to bless His Highness the Crown Prince. We humbly pray that his anointing be of Great Harmony, and his destiny bathed in radiant fortune. May the dragon steps know enduring days, drawing from the vast wellspring of blessings; may the crane precincts bask in vernal warmth, gathering the abundant joy of harvests.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, from taking refuge in our Master, the Great Sage Host, and the virtue of the Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, we may preserve heaven and endure forever, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

At this noon audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists now raise the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High Perfect Master-Treasure, the Five Numinous Elders; the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue and the Dao; the Old Man of the Southern Pole, Star Lord of Longevity and Virtue; the Star Lord of Felicity and Virtue of the Highest Clarity; the Star Lord of Emolument and Virtue of the Highest Clarity; and the Perfected Immortals and Holy Host of the Heaven of Great Crimson.

We take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life, prostrating ourselves to the earth, reverently relying upon the Three Worthies of the Most High and the Holy Hosts of the Ten Directions. May the merit of this incense flow to the Nine Provinces and Four Seas, to the myriad families and the three orders of husbandmen. We humbly pray that the divine wind enfold them, and the loving sun nurture them. May the aged be at peace and the young content; may the fields and wilds be transformed by non-action, and the plowmen eat and the well-diggers drink, while the villages sing of the enduring Dao.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, from taking refuge in our Master, the Great Sage Host, and the virtue of the Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, we may forever preserve and endure, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.

**The Three Refuges**

With sincere heart, we take refuge in the scriptures of the Ten Directions. May all beings awaken to understanding, receive, uphold, read, and recite them.

With sincere heart, we take refuge in the Dao-Treasures of the Ten Directions. May all beings arise with resolve and turn toward all that is to be revered.

With sincere heart, we take refuge in the Masters of the Ten Directions. May all beings universally ascend the bridge of the Dharma, without hindrance.

**Eulogy of Past Lives**

We, your servants, respectfully follow the scriptures, which state: On the Three Primes, the Eight Nodal Days, and the days of our natal destiny beneath the Northern Dipper, we solemnly establish the altar, perform the turning of scriptures, and conduct the fast and offering, proceeding according to the ritual—its blessings are boundless.

Today, in reverent compliance with the imperial edict, we undertake the solemn rite of the Golden Register to pray for longevity and felicity. We, your servants, respectfully lead the pure assembly at the altar in reciting once through the *Highest Clarity Numinous Northern Dipper Natal Destiny Life-Prolonging True Scripture*, offering it to the Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Fourth Roaming Strike Office, the Heavenly Heart Wenqu Jade Dawn Lord.

We beseech that the baleful influences of the northwest Qian position, the six white corners of Zī, and the Jiang Lou region be erased. We look up in hope of your compassion, and humbly pray for your gracious assent.

We, your servants, overwhelmed with fervent devotion, perform the scriptural rites.

**Eulogy of the Dharma Seat**

**Inscription of the Scripture**

**After the Recitation of the Scripture**

**Eulogy of the Rising from the Seat**

We, your servants, have just now reverently led the pure assembly in ascending the altar to perform the Dao rites, offering prayers for the eternal peace of the Sagely Lifespan. We have recited once through the *Highest Clarity Numinous Northern Dipper Natal Destiny Life-Prolonging True Scripture*, and the recitation is now complete. Earnestly we look up in hope that felicity and longevity may be bestowed upon our destinies, that virtuous fruits may gather upon our persons, and that each may turn with sincerity to circumambulate in hymns of praise.

Proceeding in void-stepping, we are led to the northwest quarter, where incense is offered. Circumambulating, we return to our positions.

**Seven Primes Covering-Protection Heavenly Worthy**

We, your servants, respectfully follow the scripture’s teaching, offering libations of water and flowers. With minds concentrated, we gaze toward the Northern Culmen, prostrating in reverence to invoke the name of our Natal Destiny True Lord. Thus shall we not pass vainly through the limits of our natal destiny, but all may attain life-prolonging blessings inscribed upon the body, calamities and misfortunes expunged, and boundless felicity obtained.

Again, in reverent compliance with the imperial edict, we undertake the exalted practice of the Golden Register, praying for longevity and felicity. We, your servants, respectfully lead the pure assembly at the altar in reciting once through the *Highest Clarity Numinous Northern Dipper Natal Destiny Life-Prolonging True Scripture*, offering it to the Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Fifth Dipper Lord Office, the Heavenly Quail Cinnabar Chastity Jade Dawn Lord.

We beseech that the baleful influences of the Shen Palace and the five-yellow region be erased. We look up in hope of your compassion, and humbly pray for your gracious assent.

We, your servants, overwhelmed with fervent devotion, perform the scriptural rites.

**Eulogy of the Dharma Seat**

**Inscription of the Scripture**

**After the Recitation of the Scripture**

**Eulogy of the Rising from the Seat**

We, your servants, having hitherto reverently led the pure assembly in ascending the altar to perform the Dao, supplicating for the myriad-fold peace of the Sage’s longevity, have now completed the recitation of the *Highest Clarity Numinous Northern Dipper Natal Destiny Life-Prolonging True Scripture* once through. We humbly pray that felicity and longevity be bestowed upon our destinies, that virtuous fruits accrue to our persons, and that each, with sincere devotion, proceed in rotating procession with hymns of praise.

Proceeding in void-stepping, we are led to the Shen Palace, where incense is offered, and in rotating procession return to our positions.

**Great Compassionate Longevity-Extending Heavenly Worthy**

We, your servants, reverently follow the scripture’s teaching: the true lords’ names may not be heard. Yet all who see or hear and are able to recite them possess profound Dao-heart and karmic affinity from past lives. Their merit and power are beyond measure.

In accordance with the imperial edict, we now reverently perform the Golden Register rites to pray for longevity and felicity. We, your servants, respectfully lead the pure assembly at the altar in reciting once through the *Highest Clarity Numinous Northern Dipper Natal Destiny Life-Prolonging True Scripture*, offering it to the Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Sixth Grand Constancy Office, and the Jade Dawn Lord of the Assisting Military Star.

We beseech that the baleful influences of the southeast Xun region, the four-green Longevity Star, and the Quail’s Head quadrant be erased. We look up in hope of your compassion, and humbly pray for your gracious assent.

We, your servants, overwhelmed with fervent devotion, perform the scriptural rites.

**Eulogy of the Dharma Seat**

**Inscription of the Scripture**

**After the Recitation of the Scripture**

**Eulogy of the Rising from the Seat**

We, your servants, have hitherto reverently led the pure assembly in ascending the altar to perform the Daoist rites. We have offered prayers for the eternal peace of the Sacred Lifespan and recited once through the *Highest Clarity Numinous Northern Dipper Natal Destiny Life-Prolonging True Scripture*, now fully completed. Humbly we look up in hope that felicity and longevity may be bestowed upon destinies, and that virtuous fruits may gather upon all beings. Each has conducted themselves with utmost sincerity, circling the altar in hymns of praise.

Proceeding in the *Step of Emptiness*, we are guided to the southeast, where incense is offered; then, circling back, we return to our positions.

**Three Hearings of the Scripture**
After hearing the scripture, may heaven endure and earth abide, may the seas be calm and the rivers clear.
After hearing the scripture, may the Sacred Lifespan be eternally peaceful, and the imperial domain firmly secured.
After hearing the scripture, may golden branches flourish and the treasury of destiny stretch boundlessly.

**Vows**
With concentrated spirit, we burn incense. O Incense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Incense Spirit-Officials, may you cause the place where we have just performed the noon audience, recited the scripture, and practiced the Dao to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here before the incense burner.

May our sincere devotion move the divine, may great blessings silently unfold, may the Sacred Lifespan be eternally peaceful, and the imperial domain forever secure. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions transmit the sincerity of our supplications through orchid-scented smoke, swiftly conveying them to the presence of the Utmost True, Boundless Dao—before the Three Clarities, the August Saints, the Purple Tenuity Northern Pole Great Emperor, and the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper.

**Eulogy of Exiting the Hall**
The rites of reciting the *Numinous Scripture* and performing the noon audience in the Dao have now concluded.
