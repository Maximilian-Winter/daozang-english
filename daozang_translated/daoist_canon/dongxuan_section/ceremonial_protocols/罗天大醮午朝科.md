### **Noon Rite of the Grand Luotian Jiao**

**All officiating masters shall maintain mindfulness as prescribed:**

Cinnabar spirit, vermilion fire,
Scarlet mists stir the winds.
The crimson wheel turns with unyielding force,
Heaven’s radiance surges through the eight directions.
Its might encompasses all,
Transforming myriad realms.
Molten gold scatters in boundless space,
All demons vanish without trace.
Banishing evil, shattering malevolence,
Illuminating the primordial merit.
Golden talismans command and restrain,
Treading clouds, spurring dragons.
Jubilant hymns resound in celebration,
Flowers scatter across the vast heavens.
Divine transformation operates in hidden motion,
The four extremities rest in peace and prosperity.
Prostrate before the Emperor,
None dare show disrespect.

**Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.**

**The Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth:**
From within this servant’s body, the Three and Five Merit Officials, Attendants of the Left and Right;
The Golden Lads bearing incense on the left, the Jade Maidens transmitting words and scattering flowers on the right;
The Thirty-Six Perfected of the Five Thearchs, Direct Talismanic Officials, and Daily Incense Officers—**emerge!**

Let them emerge in solemn attire, adorned with regal vestments, their crowns and sashes draped with tassels.
**To the Divine Perfected of the Altar’s Earthly Precincts and Local Deities:**
This servant now ascends the altar at the noon rite to perform the Dao, paying homage to the Imperial Perfected. Humbly, I present this petition for the supplicant’s intentions, all sincerely recorded in sealed writ.
May the Supreme Perfected’s Dao-qi of the Most High, the auspicious radiance of the Numinous Treasure, descend and flow into this servant’s body, that the sincerity of this petition may swiftly reach the presence of the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High Perfected, the Three Clarities’ August Sages, and the Jade Emperor of the Golden Palace in the Supreme Heavenly Vault.

**Recite the Dharma Titles:**

**[Name and rank of the officiant]**, together with the attending altar officials and assembly, reverently and with unified sincerity, address this petition to:
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Vacuous Non-Being,
The Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Dao Lord,
The Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,
The August Jade Emperor,
The Host of Great Saints who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions,
The Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters,
The Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs,
The Jade Void Emperor,
The Great Emperor of the Jade Capital,
The Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen,
The Western Numinous and Northern Perfected,
The Lord of the Numinous Treasure, Illustrious August Sovereign of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace in the Golden Portal of the Seven Jeweled Jasper Terrace of the Jade Metropolis,
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
The Supreme Ministers, Supreme Chancellors,
The Supreme Protectors, Supreme Tutors,
The Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lesser Teaching,
The Perfected King of the Western City’s Assembly,
The Perfected Lord of the Great One,
The Lord of the Eastern Marchmount’s Upper Minister, Controller of Destinies, the Two Perfected Lords Mao and Ding, Recorders of Lifespans,
The Divine Immortals who have attained the Dao in the Sacred Mountains and Grotto-Heavens,
All the Perfected and Numinous Beings of the Three Realms’ officialdom.

This servant has heard:
When the true wind prevails, one’s duty encompasses the essentials of the Dao.
Yet wisdom does not suffice to comprehend all that is seen and heard...

The heart has yet to grasp the subtle traps of the Dao.
Pursuing profit and trading in fame, one’s feelings shift with worldly customs;
Gazing across the vast expanse toward the distant void, one vainly yearns for the cinnabar splendor of transcendence.
Were it not for exhausting all efforts to commune with the numinous ranks,
fear of lingering in regret would surely follow.
Thus, in earnest supplication, how dare I not comply?
With sincere words, I now humbly present this memorial.

**Memorial Text**
As the petition reveals in full the depth of devotion,
I trust Your Celestial Compassion will deign to heed its plea.

I have heard:
Numbers arise from the One, and ranks are perfected in the Three.
The One is the root of the myriad things,
while the Three threads the order of the Two Modes.
When the Two Modes join in virtue, the Three Luminaries shine forth in brilliance,
rightly governing day and night with constancy,
and circulating the four seasons without error.
Vast as the four seas, they distinguish the auspices and calamities of each region;
subtle as the single body, they fuse year and fate to mold and refine.
Thus, the stars and lunar lodges follow the Yang’s path in their celestial courses,
while fortunes, destinies, lifespans, and wealth belong to the celestial offices that govern reckoning.
Nobility and humility are apportioned by fate,
and all fortunes and misfortunes arise in due time—none but are bestowed by decree.

Now, the officiant [Name] rejoices in encountering an era of prosperity,
born in an age of radiant clarity.
His life’s fortune, destiny, and wealth are surely due to the illumination of the heavens;
his qi, form, and substance are blessed to inherit the harmony of primordial balance.
Aware of such favor, he stands in awe and reveres the precepts,
purifying the sacred altar to offer blessings,
and upholding the rites with solemn devotion.
Looking up to the imperial will, he presents this solemn observance at the appointed hour.

The sun’s chariot halts its course, and the jade heavens dispel all vapors.
The sunflower’s shadow stands true without deviation,
and the gnomon’s measure shines clear and unmistakable.
By verifying the height of the midday sun, one deeply attains its fitting moment;
by observing the slant of its rays, one transcends all ordinary dwelling.
The adept employs this to enter emptiness and stillness,
while the sage uses it to govern the world as an enduring principle.
This very moment of alignment secretly accords with wondrous transformation.

Now, at the hour of high noon, as the Dao is practiced,
the assembly of ritualists, invoking the Dharma,
conveys the first pinch of incense.
May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the realm of the Three Purities.

We, your servants, prostrate body, spirit, and life,
bowing our heads to the ground.
Reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones of the Great Highest,
we dedicate the merit of this incense offering
to the reigning emperor, praying that:
the Nine Ancestral Shrines be filled with blessings,
and the Three Luminaries bestow their favor.
May he embody the benevolence of Yao, extending its radiance to the four quarters,
and continue the Way of Zhou, bringing its grace to the ten thousand regions.
May he sheathe bows and arrows to still all warfare,
cultivating culture and laying aside arms;
reduce punishments and lighten taxes,
enriching customs and bringing peace to the age.
May the pure wind be renewed,
and the distant antiquity be once more illumined.

Now, therefore, we burn incense,
returning to the virtue/power of the Dao, the Venerable, the Great Sage Host, and the Perfected Ones of the Highest.
After attaining the Dao, may they preserve Heaven and endure forever.

At this noon hour of ritual practice,
we, the assembly of the Dharma, offer this second pinch of incense.
May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to make offering to the Three Realms and the ten directions,
to all the Heavenly Great Sages,
and to the three generations of ancestors and departed spirits of the officiating patrons.
We humbly pray that:
the yin realms be illumined,
and the yang souls be settled in clarity.
With unobstructed vision, may they perceive the emptiness of all true principles;
returning to the root and restoring the origin, may their spirit-minds become as vast as the sea.
May they mount the nine-plumed phoenix,
and be guided by the ten-streamered banners.
Roaming and feasting in the Pure Capital,
they transcend birth and enter the Land of Bliss.

Now, therefore, we burn incense,
returning to the virtue/power of the Sutra, the Venerable, the Great Sage Host, and the Perfected Ones of the Highest.
After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless.

At this noon hour of ritual practice,
we, the assembly of the Dharma, offer this third pinch of incense.
May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to make offering to the sacred mountains and oceanic peaks,
to the realized immortals and perfected transcendents,
to the entire household and kin,
and to the original destiny of the patron’s life-star.
We humbly pray that:
their bright mandate be radiant,
and the morning breeze spread blessings.
May longevity be prolonged in the celestial lodges,
and robust health and flourishing prosperity be secured in the course of life.
May their noble house flourish abundantly,
ever attaining auspicious affairs;
may their illustrious descendants thrive,
their glorious renown ever increasing.
In harmony and reverence, may they delight in the civilizing influence of culture and learning;
with soaring vigor and rising splendor, may they exalt the renown of their family in rites and propriety.
May their store of blessings be abundant,
and their prosperity ever expanding.

Now, therefore, we burn incense,
returning to the virtue/power of the Master, the Venerable, the Great Sage Host, and the Perfected Ones of the Highest.
After attaining the Dao, may they unite with the Dao in truth.

Chanting the directions, we confess and repent...

With the Invocation of the Life-Spanning Demons, the Triple Hymn, the Triple Bows, and the Repeated Recitation of the Dharma Titles, we, the officiants and all assembled before the altar, reverently and with one heart, address the following supplication:

To the Supreme Ones of the Three Realms, the Sagely Hosts of the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Perfected and Celestial Emperors of the Jade Capital and Golden Gates, the Venerable Masters and Sagely Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Officials of the Three Realms, and all majestic numina:

We have heard that the formless void has no gate, yet through external forms and sounds, prayers are offered; the heart of the Dao is responsive, for through seeing and hearing, the trigger of resonance is sprung. Ever non-acting yet never failing to act, it skillfully saves all beings without abandoning any.

We, however, are of the shallowest capacity, our virtue all too meager. The steps toward the Dao stretch boundlessly before us, and the work of cultivating the Real can scarcely be accomplished in a day. Clinging to an unshakable folly, we yet seek to plumb the unfathomable depths of the Nameless. Thus, in every act of utmost sincerity, we must place others before ourselves. To deliver beings from the wheel of suffering, we must proclaim the wondrous model.

The present sponsor of this retreat, so-and-so, has long borne a profound karmic bond, reverently gazing up to the Great Luminosity, preserving frugality and fostering tranquility. Early on, they embraced the frugal virtue of serving Heaven, purifying their essence and clarifying their thoughts; never forgetting the diligence of reverent precepts, they strictly uphold the statutes and ordinances. Solemnly they conduct the rites of their village, kindling orchid-oil lamps at night; in imagination, they ascend to the starry firmament, where the sounds of Sanskrit chanting soar to the heavens, their voices reaching the celestial vaults.

We pray that the chariots of the Five Luminaries may briefly pause in their circuits through the Three Realms, that the radiance of the Supreme Origin may be made manifest, and that our supplications may reach the boundless. With reverence, we look up to the August Heavenly Emperor, the Perfected Ones of the Highest Sphere, the Immortal Hosts of the Dharma Realm, and the Sagely Assemblies of the Celestial Net.

May their divine chariots gleam with resplendent luster, as the thousand officials move in ceaseless procession; may their sagely calculations know no limit, firmly securing the mountains and rivers as their guardians. For the sponsor of this retreat, so-and-so, we humbly pray:

May the hundred spirits surround and protect them, the five agents guard and restrain. Warding off calamity and supporting decline, they dispel the stale qi of demons and malevolence; prolonging life and increasing destiny, they bathe in the lingering radiance of the Immortals and Sages. May fortune, stern in its operation, be ever renewed with the seasons; may misfortune, concealed in action and repose, daily recede. In their conduct, may they fully preserve prosperity and abundance; in their gentle demeanor, may they be truly renowned in fame. May their household transmit blessings, and their persons be known through their deeds. May all living kin, young and old, enjoy joy and well-being; may past ancestors and kindred all be delivered. May the city gods and village spirits protect the numinous altar; may the talisman messengers and merit officers purify the Yellow Path. Each contributing their diligent efforts, may they await promotion in rank and grade. May all sentient beings partake of the moisture of the Dharma, that above, the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy may be made manifest, and below, our own reverent sincerity may be fulfilled.

We respectfully present this supplication for your hearing.

**Vows:**
First, may the numinous light shine down;
Second, may the moon of the Dao cast forth its splendor;
Third, may grace be proclaimed throughout the Nine Lands;
Fourth, may sincerity reach the majesty of Heaven;
Fifth, may the true numina all assemble;
Sixth, may the qi of the Dao pervade all;
Seventh, may the Heavenly Halls be opened wide;
Eighth, may the Hells be shattered and destroyed;
Ninth, may the mysterious workings be universally bestowed;
Tenth, may the chariots of light soar through empty space;
Eleventh, may all under Heaven cherish virtue;
Twelfth, may the transformation of the Dao be non-acting.

The incense burner is replenished; we concentrate our spirit and burn incense.

May the Incense-Official Envoys, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all the attendant spirit-officials of incense cause this place—where we have ascended the altar at the noon audience to perform the Dao-ritual—to naturally generate golden liquor, cinnabar-green mushroom blossoms, and the assembled host of the hundred numina and perfected beings, all gathered here before the incense burner. May it be vouchsafed that the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid banquet, and swiftly convey the sincerity of our supplication directly upward to the presence of the Utmost True, Boundless Great Dao; the Three Clarities and Supreme Sages; and the August Heavenly Venerable, the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal in the Highest Heaven. The grand offering of the Luo Heaven, performed at the noon hour, is now concluded.
