**Midday Rite for Golden Talisman Longevity Invocation**
*Procedures as prescribed*
*Conduct of the Master of Rites:* Maintain reverent mindfulness in accordance with the Dao.
*Invoke the Divine Spell:*
*"Danhua radiant, precious herbs luminous.
Divine essence penetrates the profound, scattering sacred qi to the eight directions.
Direct talismans gather the breath—
Summon the Red Boy with a whistle.
The Three Pure Ones flourish, illuminating my crimson palace.
The Vermilion Deity takes its seat, perfumed with the five fragrances.
The cavernous light shines beyond form, its brilliance enveloping all.
Water and fire arise within me—
I stride alone, ascending in flight.
In harmony with the Dao’s true essence."*

*Strike the Law-Drum Twenty-Four Times*

*"Most High Three Celestial Dao/Way Essences—Primordial Origin of the Supreme Venerable Laozi—
Summon forth from my body the thirty-six officials of the Three Five (Sanwu) Bureau,
left and right attendants, incense-bearing dragon-riding messengers,
golden boys bearing incense, celestial maidens scattering flowers, the Five Emperors’ talisman-bearers and sun-officials—
thirty-six each, appearing in resplendent attire, crowns and sashes adorned with trailing ribbons."*

*Open the Mystic Altar and invoke the local deities and territorial spirits.*
*"Today, at midday, I ascend the altar to practice the Dao,
paying homage to the Celestial Worthies.
With utmost sincerity, I present my heartfelt petitions,
sealed and inscribed.
May the Supreme Venerable’s most true Dao/Way essence, the sacred treasure-light,
descend and flow into our bodies.
Let my sincere invocation swiftly reach the Supreme, Boundless, Great Dao/Way—
the Three Pure Ones, the Most High Celestial Worthy of Jade Gate, the Jade Emperor of the Golden Palace."*

*Declare the Ritual Rank:*
*"We, the officials and assembled rites-master of this altar—
with one heart, we humbly petition the Natural, Primordial, Boundless Great Dao/Way,
the Supreme Venerable of the Jade Pure Realm, the Dao Lord, the Supreme Venerable Laozi,
the Most High Celestial Worthy of Jade Gate, the Jade Emperor of the Golden Palace,
the Celestial Sovereign of the Upper Wuxi Palace, the Great Emperor of the Central Wuxi Palace,
the Earthly Sovereign of the Yellow Soil,
the Eternal Lord of the Mystic Capital, the Protector of the Realm,
the Lord of Boundless Life, the Seven-Treasured Layered Terrace of the Mystic Capital,
the Sacred Treasure of the Upper Wuxi Palace, all the Worthy Ancestors of the Golden Palace,
the Celestial Saints of the Mila Assembly,
the Supreme Minister, the Supreme Chancellor,
the Supreme Guardian, the Supreme Tutor,
the Minor Guardian, the Minor Tutor,
the Four Teachers, the Five Emperors,
the Twelve Celestial Ministers,
the Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures,
the Great Dao Master of the Mystic,
the Three Celestial Dao Masters,
the Star Palaces of Sun and Moon, the Constellations of the Circumpolar Sky,
the Southern Pole Elder, the True Lords of Longevity, Fortune, and Wealth,
the Emperor’s Personal Star Lord,
the Celestial Officials of the Imperial Seat,
and all responsive spirits within and beyond the Three Realms."*

*"We have heard:
The Dao/Way was revealed in the primordial chaos,
upright among the Three Powers, standing equal.
The Divine dwells in the boundless expanse,
divided by the Five Celestial Worthies.
Above, it aligns with the lofty clarity of the Heavenly Symbol;
below, it encompasses the vastness of the Earthly Vehicle.
The Great Brahman manifests its luminous cloud-inscriptions,
the Most True reveals the empty cavern’s sacred script.
Suspended are the sacred millet grains in the void,
resonant is the jade sound through the boundless.
Transmitted across countless kalpas,
the teaching originates from the Primordial.
Though we, unworthy in our scholarly robes,
have received the instruction—
our shallow knowledge falls short,
yet your boundless compassion contains us all.
At this auspicious time of the Sage’s sacred birthday,
we expound the Mystic Doctrine and offer our prayers.
With reverence at the Nine Steps, we devote our single sincerity.
No petition shall be omitted without proper submission.
Humbly following the Celestial Command,
we now solemnly intone the invocation."*

*"The moon’s brilliance mirrors the jade light;
auspicious celebrations echo from the Precelestial Sovereign.
The coy clouds belong to the Heavenly Symbol;
auspicious omens appeared in the Tang era.
The Southern Star calculates longevity’s延洪,
the Northern Pole records the years’ permanence.
The Celestial Sovereign lives ten thousand and eight thousand years—
his essence pure, his life eternal.
Guangcheng lived twelve hundred years—
embracing harmony, he never aged.
At this sacred birth,
we perform the Dao rites.
At this midday hour,
ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
we invite the ritual assembly to light the first incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the void,
directly offering the Most True, Supreme Dao/Way Treasure—
the Great Lord of the Primordial Origin,
the Most High Celestial Worthy of the Golden Palace.
We surrender body, spirit, and fate,
prostrating ourselves before the Three Supreme Worthies and the Ten Directions’ Saints.
May this incense’s merit ascend to bless the Emperor.
May he unite with the Three Sovereigns in virtue,
his name exalted among the Five Emperors.
Gazing upon Mount Tai’s towering peak,
his blessings rise majestic;
drawing from Kunlun’s celestial source,
his foundation is boundless.
His rule unites the Five Regions,
his deeds resonate to the Eight Directions.
Tribute and offerings come from all lands,
harmony fills the heavens and earth.
His longevity decree matches Mount Song’s grandeur,
his fortune’s source matches the boundless sea’s depth.
Divine omens multiply—
heaven bestows pure blessings."*

*"By this incense, we have surrendered to the Great Sage’s sacred assembly,
the Most True’s virtue.
After attaining the Dao,
we preserve heaven’s eternal life,
harmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.
At day’s end, the Celestial Countenance smiles.
Beholding the rainbow’s arc over the marsh,
the egrets align in procession.
At this midday hour,
ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
we invite the ritual assembly to light the second incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the void,
directly offering the Most True, Supreme Scripture-Treasure—
the Jade Sovereign of the Mystic Capital,
the Celestial Emperor of the Wuxi Palace,
the True Saints of the YuYu Celestial Palace.
We surrender body, spirit, and fate,
prostrating ourselves before the Three Supreme Worthies and the Ten Directions’ Saints.
May this incense’s merit ascend to bless the Emperor.
May his glory spread to the Nine Regions,
his throne unchallenged in unity.
Those bearing jade and silk come from ten thousand lands—
spring fills the heavens and earth.
His robes sway as he governs the Eight Extremes—
the winds of the celestial gates are serene.
His longevity decree matches Mount Song’s splendor,
his fortune’s source matches the sea’s depth.
Divine omens multiply—
heaven bestows pure blessings."*

Now we burn incense,
having taken refuge in the Teacher-Sage and the Great Assembly of Saints,
by the virtue of the Most True—
after attaining the Dao, preserving Heaven’s eternal existence,
harmonizing with the True and the Way.

In the Great Ming’s central realm,
all ranks and classes are blessed by its universal radiance;
the True Ritual is renewed with sincerity,
hoping to move Heaven through our devout aspirations.

At this moment of suspended time,
ascending the platform to perform the Dao,
we invite the Assembly of Law to join us
as we offer these three times the incense.

May this incense’s smoke ascend to the void,
directly offering the Most True, Supreme Teacher-Treasure—
the Five Spirits of the Mystic Old One of Heaven,
the Celestial Emperor of the Purple Micro and Northern Pole,
the Earthly Sovereign of the Great Red Celestial Palace,
and the boundless Saints of the Great Red Heavenly Palace.

We surrender body, spirit, and fate,
prostrating ourselves before the Three Supreme Worthies and the Ten Directions’ Saints.

May this incense’s merit ascend to bless the Emperor.
May his radiant reign shine forth,
his golden branches flourish in splendor.
May his imperial vision endure through generations,
broadly opening the Auspicious Way to the Eight Extremes;
may his sacred longevity match Heaven’s,
spreading joyous voices across the Four Seas.
May all blessings gather, may all fortune be attained.

Now we burn incense,
having taken refuge in the Teacher-Sage and the Great Assembly of Saints,
by the virtue of the Most True—
after attaining the Dao, preserving Heaven’s eternal existence,
harmonizing with the True and the Way.

The Rite is complete—
repentance is fulfilled.

We humbly offer the **Threefold Invocation** and **Threefold Rite**,
repeatedly extolling the sacred ranks of the **Three Realms’ Most Venerable Sovereigns**,
the **Ten Directions’ Supreme Saints**,
and the **Jade Capital, Golden Gate Celestial Emperor**—the **True Essence of Heaven**—
along with the **Solar, Lunar, and Stellar Hosts of Truth**,
the **Ten Directions’ Teacher-Saints and Sacred Assembly**,
and all officials of the **Three Realms**,
as we establish the **Grand Feast of Expiation** with sacred icons and all their awe-inspiring spirits.

We have heard that the Sovereign’s rule spans the **Two Intervals**,
his lifespan matching Heaven’s measure yet never aging;
his governance flourishes through the **Nine Realms**,
his brilliance as radiant as the sun at its zenith.

All blessings gather in abundance,
and the Five Auspicious Fortunes thrive in splendor.
With mere gesture, he achieves harmonious order,
and through refined rites and music, he civilizes the people.

He sits enthroned in the south, facing the court,
and encircles the **Northern Pole** with imperial majesty.
His sway pacifies the **Four Seas**,
his virtue extends to the **Ten Thousand States**.

He subtly aligns with the **Divine Illumination**,
eternally securing peace for the **Sacred Lineage and Realm**.
Heaven opens the **Domain of Longevity**,
and the sun reveals the **Mysterious Arts**.

The altar is purified, the grounds solemn,
with ranks of officials standing in strict order.
Our hearts turn to the **Ten Extremes**,
gazing upon the **Celestial Procession** in unified reverence;
our blessings extend to the **Nine Provinces**,
praying for the **Emperor’s Vision** to endure forever firm.

We humbly hope this **Triple Observance of the Expiatory Rite** will
correctly admonish and preserve the **Sacred Mandate**.
We record the **Pine Tree’s Years** in the **Blue Registers**,
and reflect the **Emperor’s True Intentions** in the **Crimson Decrees**.
The **Five Phases** move in proper sequence,
the **Seven Luminaries** follow their appointed courses.
The **Six Qi** remain in balance,
and sweet dew flows like **Heaven’s Auspicious Grace**;
the **Hosts of Truth** rejoice in celebration,
and the **Sacred Springs of Joy** overflow from the **Earth’s Spirits**.

The year’s harvests flourish abundantly,
and the **Heavenly and Earthly** realms achieve mutual harmony.
His grace reaches all under Heaven,
his virtue encompasses the universe.
Thus, above, he honors the **Most Venerable Celestial Emperor’s Great Benevolent Transformation**,
and below, he fulfills our subjects’ sincere devotion to the **Sacred Mandate**.

With utmost reverence, we submit this to Your Highness.

**The Twelve Vows**—
*"Preserve the Spirit and Burn the Incense"*—

The **Incense Officials and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Attendant Spirits of Incense**—
when they command that the place where I formerly ascended the platform to perform the **Dao** at the **Wu Chao** ritual,
there shall naturally arise the **Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** essences.

The **Hundred Spirits and Celestial Worthies** gather here at the incense brazier’s flame.
May my **sincere devotion** be deeply felt—
may the **Sacred Longevity** of the **Most Venerable** endure without end.

The **Ten-Directional Celestial Youths** and **Jade Maidens** attend in attendance,
conveying through fragrant mists the **sincerity** of my former supplications
to the **Supreme Dao of the Most High, the Three Pure Ones, the Most Venerable Celestial Emperor, the Golden Gate Jade Sovereign, the Imperial Lord of Heaven**—
directly before His **Most August Presence**.

**Hymn of Departure:**
*"The former Wu Chao ritual of the Golden Talisman for Longevity has now concluded."*
