**Title:** *The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms* (*Taishang Cibei Daochang Xiaozai Jiuyou Chan*). Ten fascicles. Originally compiled by Ge Xuan of the Han, as transmitted and collected. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongxuan* section, *Weiyi* category.

**Preface to *The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms***
Composed by Li Hanguang, Master of the Three Caverns and Master of Mystic Stillness

In the beginning, when the Crimson Clarity first dawned, cloud-script took form at the celestial pole. After the rise of the Flame Emperor’s Han, sacred texts gradually spread among humankind. In the western lands of Shu, the golden palaces bequeathed their teachings; in the eastern realm of Wu, the Great Ultimate transmitted its doctrine. Thus, secret scrolls of the Great Existence and jade chapters of the Cavern Realms emerged—Zhang and Xu revealed them in earlier times, while Tao and Lu disseminated them later. Master and disciple followed in succession, and generations produced such figures.

*The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms* originated with the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan, during the reign of Emperor Huan of the Later Han. Dwelling in reclusion on Mount Yushan of Tiantai, he cultivated the Dao in seclusion. The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, descended into the Immortal’s chamber and bestowed upon him the *Lingbao Celestial Writ*, the *Jade Script of Cavern Reality*, the *Cavern Mystery*, the *Cavern Spirit*, and the thirty-six divisions of precious scriptures. The Immortal, abiding in the mountains, refined his thoughts and stilled his mind. Over decades, he communed with spirits and moved the sacred. Mountain spirits and tree ghosts guarded and bowed in reverence.

The wandering souls and lost spirits all attain transcendence and rebirth. This was deemed the profound essence of the Great Vehicle, capable of enlightening sentient beings and rescuing those drowning in suffering. Thus, from within the Three Caverns, the Immortal distilled their essential teachings, compiling repentance texts to ensure that all beings of the present age might hear and witness them. For future generations of scholars, these would be easily understood and practiced, extending even to the boundless.

In the icy nights of Fengdu’s Avīci Hell, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the Eight Difficulties and Nine Dark Realms—where tormented souls languish in confinement—none would remain trapped. Whether living, past, or yet to come, all who have committed fresh transgressions or carried ancestral sins, whose karmic entanglements and calamities have bound them, would receive the moistening grace of the Dharma, assembling in the realm of true perfection. Thus, this teaching spread.

Thereafter, those drawn to evil causes numbered barely two or three in a hundred, while those awakening to virtuous conditions reached eight or nine in ten. Hence, the ranks of immortals were fully established, and the work of transformation and guidance was complete. This text is therefore set at the beginning of the scroll.

*The Great Supreme’s Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms*, Scroll One
Compiled by the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate, Ge Xuan

The Primordial and the Jade Emperor, supreme sages, respond to beings by manifesting forms and establishing teachings according to circumstance. Without the treasure of scriptures, the dust of delusion cannot be dispelled. From their mouths flow jade texts, expounding these sacred mysteries, returning to purity and simplicity—this depends on the heart. For those who seek learning, the method is here revealed.

The *Scripture of the Chapter on Generating the Spirit* states: In the Dragon Han kalpa, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Reality* scriptures:
1. *Supreme*
2. *Wondrous Grove*
3. *Great Clarity*
4. *Penetrating Vision*
5. *Highest Clarity*
6. *Transformation and Enlightenment*
7. *Primordial Yang*
8. *Wondrous Perfection*
9. *Opening the Mountain*
10. *Ten Immortals*
11. *Jade Grove*
12. *Yellow and Lao*

These scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Jade Clarity Realm.

In the Crimson Brightness kalpa, the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Mystery* scriptures were expounded:
1. *Spiritual Harmony*
2. *Numinous Treasure*
3. *Communion with Spirits*
4. *Immeasurable*
5. *Assembly of Immortals*
6. *Inner Secrets*
7. *Utmost Perfection*
8. *Gathering Virtue*
9. *Refining Essence*
10. *Life and Death*
11. *Palace Diagrams*
12. *Dispelling Demons*

These scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Highest Clarity Realm.

In the Kaihuang kalpa, the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Spirit* scriptures were expounded:
1. *Great Perfection*
2. *Utmost Virtue*
3. *Yellow Court*
4. *Refining Qi*
5. *Dao and Virtue*
6. *Primordial Spirit*
7. *Great Kalpa*
8. *Inner Simplicity*
9. *Divine Invocations*
10. *Three Sovereigns*
11. *Subduing Demons*
12. *Lesser Kalpa*

These scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Great Clarity Realm.

Thus, the thirty-six divisions of the Three Cavern scriptures are arrayed upon golden tablets, with the Seven Sages setting forth the model, illuminating the royal canon. Once in ten thousand kalpas, the Dharma emerges in accordance with humanity.

The Three Caverns may be summarized as the One Vehicle. Therefore, the *Orthodox Unity* states: Though the Three Caverns are three, when encompassed together, they form the Dao of the One Vehicle. The *Great Mystery* is the Great Vehicle, the *Great Peace* the Middle Vehicle, and the *Great Clarity* the Small Vehicle. *Orthodox Unity* permeates all three.

In terms of rank and illumination, the Three Caverns correspond to the Three Clarities. The *Great Mystery* governs the three palaces above, the *Great Peace* the three palaces in the middle, and the *Great Clarity* the three palaces below.

These Three Cavern scriptures fully elucidate the profound canon, teaching and transforming according to circumstance, delivering humans and devas, and guiding all beings. In the human world, conduct varies in elevation, and the Dharma varies in depth, yet they enable the Six Paths to return to truth and the Three Vehicles to awaken to realization.

Now, contemplating the ages to come, I see those ascending and descending through the Six Paths, the four kinds of birth in the dark and manifest realms, the icy nights of the Nine Dark Realms, the Fengdu and Five Sufferings, the languishing souls and spirits—all enduring karmic retribution, suffering in life, unable to escape the demons of grievance. Therefore, from the Three Cavern scriptures, I have compiled and expounded the *Compassionate Daoist Ritual for Dispelling Calamities and Repenting in the Nine Dark Realms*, a work of ten scrolls, establishing its principles and completing its chapters.

By investigating the profound and abstruse meanings, whether living or deceased, those who revere the sages and repent their transgressions will immediately depart the Three Evil Paths, ascend to the Nine Clarity Realms, awaken to non-action, and return to the Great Dao.

The *Great Mystery Scripture* states: Formerly, the Lord of the Azure Youth declared, "To practice the Dao is苦, and not to practice the Dao is also 苦." Consider how, from birth to old age, from illness to death, the suffering of protecting the body is boundless, and the accumulation of vexations and sins only ceases at death. Many prayers fail to prolong life.

As for the苦 of practicing the Dao: maintaining purity and preserving truth, guarding the mysterious and contemplating the numinous, seeking teachers and upholding the Dharma, diligently cultivating the heart without laziness, and resolutely applying the will—this too is a 苦 endeavor. Regard the ranks of feudal lords as passing guests; regard gold and silk as mere pebbles...

Regard the esteem for plain silk as coarse cloth. This may be called the ability to inquire into the Dao.

The Lord of Western Citadel declared: "After death, to fall into the Three Evil Realms is easy; to obtain a human rebirth is difficult. Having obtained a human rebirth, to depart from the female form and become male is difficult. Having become male, to possess a complete and sound body is difficult. Having attained a complete body, to be born in the Central Kingdom is difficult. Having been born in the Central Kingdom, to encounter sagely rulers and parents is difficult. Having encountered sagely rulers and parents, to be born in an age where one may study the Dao and cultivate a heart of benevolence and kindness is difficult. Having cultivated a heart of benevolence and kindness, to believe in the virtue of the Dao and the attainment of long life is difficult."

Now, the Three Evil Realms are hell, the realm of hungry ghosts, and the realm of beasts—difficult to escape and be reborn as a human, instead becoming birds, beasts, insects, or livestock. If one seeks to avoid these, by what virtuous power may it be done?

The Heavenly Worthy said: "If one seeks to avoid the Three Evil Realms, one must first broadly vow before my manifested images of true sages, then eliminate the Three Actions and Six Roots, and afterward take refuge in the Three Treasures. Thereafter, dedicate the merit, confess one’s transgressions, and inquire into repentance—thus attaining the divine within the human and joining the Dao of celestial immortals."

**Chapter One: Broadly Vowing Aspirations**
Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, reflect that in this life, we have obtained human form, dwell in the floating world, and have encountered the true teaching. Gazing upon the sacred countenance, we bow our heads in reverence and take refuge, vowing great aspirations:

First, we vow that from this day forward, we and all in this assembly shall establish myriad virtuous practices, transforming the six destinies and four births, that all may equally attain liberation and forever depart from the defiled and chaotic realms of the world.

Second, we vow that life after life, we shall leave the household, forsake worldly attachments and affections, follow conditions to beg alms, broadly cultivate fields of merit, constantly practice compassion and forbearance, and forever transcend the distinctions of self and other.

Third, we vow to constantly encounter noble friends who guide and instruct us.

Fourth, we vow to meet enlightened masters and receive the supreme Dao.

Fifth, we vow to hear the true Dharma and practice it as taught.

Sixth, we vow to behold the Heavenly Worthy and personally receive the sacred decree.

Seventh, we vow to deliver all beings, placing others before ourselves.

Eighth, we vow to widely proclaim the Dharma to the ignorant and benighted.

Ninth, we vow that all sentient beings shall awaken the intention for the Dao, believe in and venerate the scriptures and images, construct numinous temples, and offer incense, flowers, lamps, and candles according to their means.

Tenth, we vow that our hearts shall remain steadfast and unwavering. By this virtuous power, may demonic forces be subdued, and the realm attain peace and tranquility. May those who have not heard hear, and those who have not seen see. May those who delight in the Lesser Vehicle not doubt the Middle Vehicle; may those who have entered the Middle Vehicle not doubt the Great Vehicle; and may those who have entered the Great Vehicle wish all sentient beings to hear the wisdom of enlightenment. May those who have not yet awakened awaken; may those who have awakened grow further; and may those who have grown become eyes and ears for others, Dao guides, parents, elder brothers, and friends—gathering in the Dao altar, joining as companions in the Dharma.

We further vow that all sentient beings, before the scriptures and the venerable, in their own bodies and others’, in all inner and outer Dharma, shall not generate minds of transgression, arrogance, anger, jealousy, or stinginess.

We further vow that all the merit we cultivate shall not be for ourselves alone but shall universally extend to all. Upon seeing the orphaned, solitary, imprisoned, or ailing, may we arise with minds of rescue, salvation, the Dao, and sincerity.

We further vow that the hidden and manifest true sages shall together bestow their protection and deliverance. May the repentant patron so-and-so and all of us in this assembly fulfill our broad vows, our hearts aligning with the true sages. May the power of our vows extend to our parents of past, present, and future lives, our six relations, and all living kin—may they all attain peace and happiness. May those who have passed not be reborn in evil realms, and may those yet to come not accumulate grave transgressions. May all equally realize the fruition of the vows we make today.

**One bow**

**Chapter Two: Eliminating the Three Actions and Six Roots**
Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each turning their minds, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, reflect that in this life and past lives, we have not heard the true Dharma, often arising perverse thoughts, our discerning natures lost in confusion, failing to seek the ultimate principle.

The *Sutra of Karmic Retribution* states: "All that has form is transient and illusory. Thought after thought perishes, never pausing for even a moment. Suffering and affliction revolve endlessly; unawakened and unenlightened, we traverse the Three Ways, enduring myriad kalpas of bitterness. Receiving one body after another, we are bound by the fetters of affliction—all due to the Three Actions."

For there are Six Roots: the eye root, ear root, nose root, tongue root, body root, and mind root. These roots give rise to all actions, hence the Six Roots are like grasses and trees, producing myriad flowers and fruits, endlessly generating one another. Thus arise the Six Passions, Six Desires, Six Defilements, Six Entrances, Six Thieves, Six Dusts, and Six Consciousnesses. Yet form, sound, fragrance, flavor, touch, and dharmas are fundamentally empty and tranquil, neither moving the body nor disturbing the mind. It is sentient beings who cling and grasp, vainly harboring preferences and aversions, thought after thought racing in competition, afflictions binding the body. By these causes and conditions, we drift and wander through birth and death.

If one can purify wisdom and carefully reflect, awakening to these Six Roots before my image, then all roots shall be exhausted.

The Three Actions are: bodily action, mental action, and verbal action. We in this assembly, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, have indulged the Three Actions and Six Roots for countless kalpas, never once awakening. Today, before the image of the true sages, we arouse the mind of wisdom, generate the intention to awaken, and pledge to eliminate them.

First, we repent the sins of bodily action: from birth, we have killed, stolen, and indulged in lust, greedily seeking fine and smooth things. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not commit killing or stealing, nor crave fine and smooth things, nor indulge in lust, seeking liberation from the fetters of desire. May we encounter the scriptures and, before the images, bathe in fragrant waters, purifying body and spirit, contemplating the Dao and reflecting on truth. Striking the Dharma drum, we visualize the Three Treasures, repenting for all sentient beings, forever seeking the fruit of purity.

**One bow**

Next, we repent the sins of mental action: from birth, our minds have been driven by greed, anger, ignorance, and attachment, racing with scattered thoughts.

The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not give rise to greed or anger, nor generate delusion or attachment, nor entertain perverse thoughts, ever aspiring to the true and authentic. May we encounter the scriptures, focus our minds with single intent, as though before the Three Treasures, universally guiding all to take refuge, attaining the fruit of non-action.

**One bow**

Next, we repent the sins of verbal action: from birth, our mouths have uttered frivolous speech and falsehoods, engaged in harsh words and slander. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge in divisive speech, nor harbor thoughts in the mind, but ever maintain purity, forever severing slander. May we encounter the scriptures and, before the sacred images, concentrate our thoughts with precision, universally enabling all to hear and know, eternally realizing the fruit of immortality and sagehood.

**One bow**

Next, we repent the sins of the eye faculty: from birth, our eyes have been false and unreal, never truly authentic, wantonly generating conditions, falsely beholding forms. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge our eyes in generating conditions or coveting perceptions of form. With true and proper vision, we shall see all appearances as empty, seeking the inconceivable fruit of ultimate attainment.

**One bow**

Next, we repent the sins of the ear faculty: from birth, our ears have heard the five tones, discerning purity and impurity. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge our ears in hearing sounds, lest they disturb body and mind, entangling us in afflictions. May we realize the fruit of quiescence.

**One bow**

Next, we repent the sins of the nose faculty: from birth, our noses have distinguished fragrance and stench, perceiving the flow of qi. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge our noses in smelling fragrances, discriminating between the foul and the aromatic, mingling and confounding primordial qi, agitating the numinous terrace. May we realize the fruit of mystery and emptiness.

**One bow**

Next, we repent the sins of the tongue faculty: from birth, our tongues have craved the five flavors, insatiable and unfulfilled, speaking slander and falsehoods, maligning the loyal and flattering the virtuous. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge our tongues in savoring flavors, nor engage in quarrels or gossip, nor incite defamation. May we realize the fruit of truth and authenticity.

**One bow**

Next, we repent the sins of the body faculty: from birth, our bodies have sought only sensual pleasure, unaware of the suffering to come after death. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge the body’s conditions in coveting illicit pleasure or pursuing wanton delight, but ever seek to withdraw and deliver others. May we return and realize the fruit of the Great Dao.

**One bow**

Next, we repent the sins of the mind faculty: from birth, our minds have lacked steadfast constancy, shifting and unpredictable, like apes or horses, akin to fire and wind. The repentant patron so-and-so vows that from this day forward, we shall not indulge the mind’s faculty, maintaining constancy from beginning to end, with movement and stillness undisturbed. May we enter and realize the fruit of spontaneity.

**One bow**

Today, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, each directing their minds, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, repent the sins of the three karmic actions and six faculties as above. We universally vow to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, all the venerable and sagely ones, all perfected and immortals, all the great sage assemblies who have attained the Dao, and all the concealed and manifest honored sages of the ten directions: may you arouse the mind of protection and extend your compassionate intent. May the repentant patron so-and-so, from kalpas past to this very day, have all sins and karmic offenses, from the moment this mind of resolve is generated, completely extinguished. May this extend even to our parents in this present life, our masters who have guided us to liberation, our countless ancestors, siblings, and six relations, our in-laws and kin—those living in this world and those yet to come—who, by virtue of this repentance, have all their transgressions dissolved. For those already departed, may they not sink into evil destinies or dwell in dark obscurity, but swiftly attain rebirth in the Land of Eternal Bliss.

**One bow**

**Section Three: Taking Refuge in the Three Treasures**

Today, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, each directing their minds, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, have heard the words of the Great Canon: all sentient beings, born between heaven and earth, know not the sheltering and supporting [of the Dao]. Though they receive the Great Dao, they are unaware of their true origin. Turning away from brightness toward darkness, pursuing the superficial and abandoning the fundamental, reverting from correctness to perversity, estranging themselves from truth and embracing falsehood, they defile the Three Luminaries and perpetually commit the ten evils, never generating shame or remorse, but constantly harboring venomous thoughts. Now, those who cultivate goodness and establish merit must first take refuge in the Three Treasures. Thus, the scriptures say: if one does not take refuge in the Three Treasures, then good dharmas have no foundation to rely upon. The Three Treasures are the Treasure of the Dao, the Treasure of the Scriptures, and the Treasure of the Masters. Though their paths differ, their fruits and causes vary.

The Treasure of the Dao: throughout the three realms and ten directions, it manifests in myriad forms. Sometimes as a sovereign, sometimes as an imperial teacher, it establishes heaven and earth, nurturing and sustaining living beings, absolving the roots of transgression, dissolving and dispelling calamities. Riding dragons and appearing in forms, driving chariots and soaring through the void, it abides in non-action and spontaneity—thus is the Treasure of the Dao honored.

The Treasure of the Scriptures: inscribed in purple characters on flowery terraces, written in mysterious texts on soaring trees, concealed in the secret repositories of celestial and immortal officials, bound in azure dragon’s precious scrolls, encased in white phoenix’s jade boxes, comprising four divisions and five thousand [scrolls], inscribed on jade tablets and golden slips, resting on stands of mystery and emptiness, wrapped in frost-like silk veils, they encompass the ultimate Mahāyāna—thus is the Treasure of the Scriptures honored.

The Treasure of the Masters: without understanding the Dharma’s principles, how can one distinguish the roots of things? Desiring to cross the river of craving and reach the shore of the Dao, without a ladder or a boat, how can one attain fruition without the aid of a teacher? Only by accomplishing the precepts can one establish this Dharma-body—thus is the Treasure of the Masters honored.

Today, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, together with the repentant patron so-and-so, prostrate ourselves for peace and to offer posthumous deliverance. Before the true and the images, we repent our sins and transgressions, bowing our heads in submission, taking refuge and paying reverence.

We bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Dao of all ten directions.

**One bow**

We bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Scriptures of all ten directions.

**One bow**

We bow our heads and take refuge in the Treasure of the Masters of all ten directions.

**One bow**

Today, the patrons and the great assembly of this Daoist ritual universally vow to the Most High and all the authentic Three Treasures of the ten directions. We humbly pray that your compassion universally descends, your wondrous responses follow the needs of beings. The repentant patron so-and-so prostrates for peace and posthumous deliverance, relying on the Three Treasures and reverently serving the Most Perfect and True. We humbly pray that the power of your mysterious light and wisdom constantly delivers the four kinds of birth, steadily ferrying the vessel of compassion, eternally responding to the three realms. May this bring joy to humans and spirits, and may the hidden and manifest alike receive your grace.

**May all who hear or witness this, and those who enter the karmic conditions of the Dharma to pay reverence, awaken to the Dao.**
**One bow**

**Chapter Four: Dedication and Adornment**

Today, the patrons and the great assembly of this Daoist ritual, each directing their minds, prostrate in reverence to the Three Clarities and Four Realms, the Eight Poles and Nine Empyreans, the Thirty-Six Heavens and Thirty-Two Emperors, the Four Quarters and Six Directions, the Five Directions of the Boundless, the Ten Directions’ Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Perfectly True Radiant August Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Lords, the Twelve Immortal Lords, the great holy hosts of the Ten Directions who have already attained the Dao, the Central Heaven’s Three August Star Emperors, the Sun and Moon and Five Agents, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Southern Palace and Northern Dipper, the Revolving Balance and all luminaries, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Four Seas and Nine Provinces, the lords of famous mountains and great marshes, the Perfected of Highest Truth, the Directors of Destiny and Registrars of Life, the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the bureaus of the netherworld, the Nine Dark Prisons of Fengdu, the Six Palaces and Nine Courts, the officials of the earthly realms above and below, the Nine Lands’ Thirty-Six August Lords, the dragon spirits and all worthies and sages of this realm.

We humbly pray that they collectively descend without partiality, jointly respond with discernment.

The repentant patron so-and-so, with utmost sincerity in heart, purifies the ritual space, commissions scriptures and invites sacred images, kindles lamps and burns incense, prostrates and offers devotion, beseeching our assembly to universally venerate the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions—manifest in boundless transformations and under myriad appellations.

We only pray that the great Perfected and Sages, the great divine immortals, the great lords and rulers, the great dragon kings, and the numinous consciousness of empty space, bear witness to this repentance, rescue sentient beings, and universally enable all who hear or know to awaken to the Great Dao.

The repentant patron so-and-so, prostrating with all five limbs to the ground, single-mindedly invokes and prostrates to the Merciful Honored Ones, reverently saluting the Perfected and Sages.

With sincere mind, we reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.

With sincere mind, we reverently salute the Perfected who universally attains wondrous practices.
With sincere mind, we reverently salute the Perfected of Great Compassion who rescues from suffering.
With sincere mind, we reverently salute the Perfected of Great Mercy who extricates from transgressions.

Today, the patrons and the great assembly of this Daoist ritual humbly pray to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Direction, all the honored ones and sages, all the great Perfected, all the great youths, who pervade the boundaries of the Ten Directions, fill the realms of the Mysterious Void, and manifest in all honored and sagely forms.

The repentant patron so-and-so first dedicates these merits to universally adorn and ascend in offering to the imperial house, the myriad ancestors and ten thousand forebears, the imperial father and mother, the revered spirits of the seven ancestral temples, that their souls may ascend to the Purple Empyrean, refine their essences in the Vermilion Mound, bathe in the jeweled pools, repose in the wondrous gardens, don robes of crimson auroras, wear crowns of emerald clouds, ride the Threefold Plain Clouds, drive the Eight-Phoenix Chariot, transcend the Flowery Towers, serve in the Jade Clarity, face the "Vacuous August One," stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the highest sages, be promoted to the ranks of divine Perfected, have their names inscribed in the celestial registers, dwell in the upper realms, bring benefit and peace to the lower lands, eternally protect the ancestral line, perpetually flourish the sacrificial rites, and enjoy boundless offerings—may all under heaven rejoice in this great fortune.

Next, we pray for the present emperor: may the dragon’s chart shine resplendent, the phoenix’s calendar flourish, his blessed reign be without end, his grand foundation eternally firm, myriad virtues gather like clouds, a thousand auspices descend like mist. May his sagely body enjoy fine health, his imperial mind radiate wisdom, the sky of Yao eternally shelter, the sun of Shun forever shine. With his sagely wisdom, perfect and all-pervading, his virtue and teachings widely bestowed, he is hailed as the pinnacle of prosperity. As in ancient times, may his grace extend to Hua and Yi, his benevolence reach the remote frontiers. May his ministers be enlightened and upright, his royal plans well-ordered, his civil and military officials of heroic talent, diligently cultivating the imperial enterprise. May the five marquises and nine governors, the hundred officials and myriad functionaries, secure the state and pacify the people, serve the public and follow governance, eradicate the ills of the age, harmonize the realm, ensure abundant harvests of grain and beans, quell weapons of war, and together enjoy peace and prosperity—all singing the praises of sagely brilliance.

Next, we pray for the imperial heir: may he be endowed with the weight of primal goodness, his Dao radiate layered brilliance, his virtue align with Heaven, his brightness match the sun, aiding and sheltering all beings, assisting in the perfection of sagely governance. May his moral and heavenly wealth abound, rites and music daily renew, his light illuminating the royal plans, his grace moistening the common people. May the golden branch flourish, the jade leaves extend their fragrance.

For the empress, the six palace consorts, and imperial concubines, the imperial daughters and moonlike maidens, may they rival the beauty of the Golden Mother, match the years of the talisman of firm Qian, eternally unwaning, their earthly virtue enduring, accumulating merits and piling up virtues, inwardly sagely and outwardly kingly.

For the imperial princes and royal clans, the heirs and feudal lords, the noble relatives and court worthies, the provincial governors and regional commanders, the frontier inspectors and their aides, the county magistrates and overseers—ever bearing toil and labor, ever cherishing loyalty and filial piety—may they, through this rite of repentance, have bodies as steadfast as mountains, lifespans as vast as the deep sea, eternally guard the inner citadel, forever rest on the unshakable stone. May their utmost virtue be pure and profound, their kindness extend to the black-haired and swarthy, lost treasures return like beasts, pheasants tame and pests cease. May their light align with the Dao, perfectly aiding non-action.

Next, may all beings—scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants, and every class—throughout the land under heaven, whether noble or base, exalted or humble, equally partake in the Dharma of repentance, mutually rely upon and extol it, each attaining peace and well-being, universally increasing joy and contentment.

Moreover, may all creatures—those that creep, fly, or stir—every sentient being, be freed from entanglements, all receive the moisture of the Dharma, forever dissolve karmic obstacles, face the sacred and the true, sharing the same vow and the same bliss.

Next, may the nine generations of ancestors of the repentance sponsor, certain, along with clan kin, those who have passed before or transformed after, new souls and old acquaintances, by virtue of the precious marks, universally cross the Dharma bridge, directly reach the Vermilion Mound, swiftly transcend the fires of refinement, their souls purified and luminous, receiving retribution with clarity, ascending the ranks of immortals, all illuminating the ancestral line.

May the living—elders and youths, inner and outer kin—each attain longevity, their ancestral temples blessed with auspiciousness, all bathed in compassionate grace, forever dwelling in the sagely age, together meeting the conditions of the Dao.

Moreover, may those in the three wretched paths, the five sufferings, the eight difficulties, and the nine dark realms, no longer linger at the round gate, transcend to the pure and adorned, all by the power of the Dao, turning toward the mysterious merit.

May all wishes be perfectly fulfilled, together ascending the shore of the Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Five: The Recitation of Repentance**

Today, in this grand Daoist sanctuary, each person directs their mind, gazing reverently toward the Merciful Honored One, reciting and inquiring in repentance.

The repentance sponsor, certain, joins hands before the heart, kneels lengthily, and listens attentively.

The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states: All sentient beings, from immeasurable kalpas past until this day, have turned and turned in the world, revolving through birth and death, drifting on the river of desire, sinking in the realm of sound and form, deluded by existence and non-existence.

The repentance sponsor, certain, does not know the past karma—from what cause it arose; does not awaken to the karmic conditions of former lives—from what they were obtained; does not awaken to the true and real—how to escape birth and death. Today, by good fortune, encountering this rite of repentance, bows in homage, takes refuge, and seeks to listen and receive with discernment.

The *Scripture of Karmic Retribution* states: Once, in the Hall of Cold Radiance and Cinnabar, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for sentient beings suffering the sins of birth and death, divided his body throughout the Three Realms, scattered his form in the ten directions, traversing heaven above and earth below, nowhere not journeying. Arriving at the Heaven of Accumulated Virtue in the World of Mount Sumeru, seated upon a seven-jeweled radiant throne, he rejoiced with the great assembly of sages who had attained the Dao across the three times, the Heavenly Emperors, Flying Celestial Kings, Perfected Ones, Divine Lads, and countless hosts, expounding the Dharma.

At that time, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, rising from the seat of fearlessness, sighed: "For immeasurable kalpas, I have never seen the Merciful Honored One as joyful as today, bestowing the great Dharma clouds, pouring the great Dharma rain, universally enabling those present to attain awakening, each receiving benefit according to their portion, inconceivable."

Wishing to rely on divine penetrations to observe the karmic conditions of good and evil in the boundless worlds, to reveal the future, enabling knowledge of past lives, the three times—past, future, and present—having spoken thus, prostrated and bowed to the ground, gazing up at the Merciful Countenance.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of Universal Salvation: "You now can generate this vow, arouse the great mind of goodness, benefiting all, inconceivable. By this karmic condition, he immediately emitted nine-colored radiance, penetrating and illuminating the heavens and the hundred million worlds, even the boundless lands below, the majestic spirit pervading without obstruction, shining clearly before the eyes, as if on the palm of the hand."

The Perfected One of Universal Salvation and the great assembly, riding this majestic light, beheld above the heavens the divine play of the host of sages, their necks bearing perfect halos, bodies complete in marks, transforming appearances at will, large or small as suited. Some rode upon the light soaring through the void, mounted dragons or cranes, carefree and responsive, their divine penetrations unobstructed. They saw celestial youths and maidens, jade lads and maidens, countless in number. They saw phoenixes and peacocks, lions and apotropaic beasts, attending to the left and right. They saw golden halls and jade palaces, jeweled terraces and pearl pavilions, celestial music and celestial flowers, celestial fruits and celestial trees, jeweled ponds and golden gardens, immortals at play, venomous dragons and fierce beasts, markets encircling the city walls, celestial kin and celestial offerings, a hundred flavors arrayed, banners, flowers, parasols, and canopies, adorned with a hundred treasures. They saw flying terraces and traveling lodges, shifting within the void, celestial robes and cloud canopies, welcoming in the empty firmament. They saw lands entirely transformed into seven treasures—gold, silver, pearls, and jade—palaces and gardens, bamboo groves, the sounds of birds and beasts, songs and music, clothing, mats, carpets, and cushions, all naturally arising, not crafted by human hands. They saw immortals consulting on Dharma marks, heavenly kings inquiring about fortune and misfortune, hundreds, thousands, even ten thousand million jeweled seats, expounding the Great Vehicle, flying immortals, celestial immortals, and those newly learning immortality questioning the Dharma and debating its subtleties. They saw such realms of blessedness, joy, and freedom, manifold and beyond naming.

Moreover, they saw below the heavens the great sages and lofty perfected ones riding clouds and driving through the void, bearing banners and holding tablets, inspecting the records of sentient beings' sins and blessings. Flying celestial kings and spirits of good and evil, celestial lads, daily roaming the human realm, recording good and evil, reporting to the heavens. The cloud palaces and star offices, the palaces of the sun and moon, the lords of mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams, examining the people, assessing the merits and demerits of good and evil. They saw the five planets lose their courses, the seven luminaries deviate, the twenty-eight constellations not adhering to their celestial fields, inauspicious stars and baleful luminaries encroaching upon the imperial throne. They saw nations where warfare arose on all four fronts, the people rebelling, floods, droughts, locusts, fierce winds, and violent rains. They saw people whose years were entangled by inauspicious stars, whose fortunes were afflicted by malevolent stars, harmed by heavenly nets, plagued by earthly snares, their households troubled, their populations perishing, the five pestilences and seven afflictions causing calamities, local deities and tomb ghosts clinging to grasses and trees, wrongful deaths and demonic disturbances, falsely acting as ancestors, possessing spirits causing turmoil, water and wood spirits creating havoc, men and women without children or with children who do not live to maturity. They saw men and women in cangues and fetters, imprisoned, flogged and tortured, entangled in lawsuits and disputes, impoverished and distressed, with none to pity them, bedridden with chronic illness, desiring life yet not living, desiring death yet not dying, afflicted with leprosy, epilepsy, madness, and malignant diseases, foolishness and confusion, bodies incomplete.

They saw those struck by lightning and thunder, their bodies covered in sores, those harmed by blades, weapons, water, and fire—burned, scorched, hacked, or shot. They saw those devoured or stung by venomous insects and fierce beasts, their cries swallowed in the maw of struggle. They saw the orphaned and widowed suffering cold and hunger, bearing hardship alone. They saw men and women parted midway through life, never to reunite in this body, mothers and children torn asunder, made into slaves and bondservants, their forms misshapen and hideous, shunned by all, their lives cut short, their arms cradling untimely death. They saw men and women born incomplete—hands and feet twisted or lame, ears deaf and eyes blind, mute and afflicted with every malady. They saw men and women with bodies split open, festering with pus and blood, lips and mouths shattered, noses collapsed, loathed by all. They saw upon the earth and among men the mountains and rivers, the peaks and streams, the Yangtze and Huai, the seas and oceans, the birds in flight and beasts on land, the creatures of water rising and sinking, all living things, all creeping things, every kind of strange being.

And in the depths beneath the earth, within the Nine Dark Hells and the Fengdu Prisons, they saw sinners enduring every manner of torture, their torments beyond naming, their suffering bitter and piercing, cutting to the bone and wounding the heart—places of karmic retribution.

Thereupon, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, beholding all the heavens and all the earths, saw how these causes and conditions differed in sin and blessing, suffering and joy. They knew not what cultivation in past lives had brought this, nor what transgressions in this life had wrought; what blessings in former lives had been, nor what sins in this life had arisen. Was it the natural endowment of the body? Was it the consequence of karmic retribution? Was it the work of the Three Agents? Was it the cause of parents? Was it the lot of this present life? Was it the seed sown in past lives? Was it sin borne by one alone? Was it calamity passed to descendants? Could it be that through cultivating goodness one might be delivered? Or was it simply the natural course of fate?

Only wishing that the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, would deign to grant enlightenment, that all beings might awaken to the causes and conditions of past lives.

The Merciful One replied: All living beings are children of the Dao. When a child is in pain, parents grieve; when the child’s illness is cured, parents find peace. Since such suffering exists, it must be treated. Excellent, Perfected One of Universal Salvation, that you have aroused such a profound mind, enlightening and benefiting all, awakening every kind. Your question truly accords with my heart. Had you not spoken, I would have still explained. Your compassion is no different from mine. Your merit and virtue are beyond conception. You are the field of blessing for the world, the boat and oar for the world, the father and mother of the world, the guide and teacher of the multitudes, the leader of the people, the master of the Dharma, the arbiter of cause and effect. Now take your seat again, and I shall expound.

Today, the master of this repentance rite has heard from the beginning of the kalpa the words of the Supreme Perfected One, inquiring of the heavens above and the earth below, of the suffering and joy of beings, the manifold causes of sin and blessing, the unfathomable conditions of past lives. Now, the master of this repentance rite, for the sake of peace and deliverance, performs this rite of repentance, prostrating body and mind, wholeheartedly arousing devotion. Bowing to the Merciful One, they reverently honor the Perfected and Sacred.

Today, the patron of this ritual and all the assembly humbly pray that the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Ones, all the Great Divine Youths, throughout the ten directions and the farthest reaches of the empty void, all the manifest and hidden honored and sacred ones, may universally bestow their compassionate light and together dispense the medicine of the Dharma. May they elevate and advance the ancestral lines of the nation, the seven clans and three ancestral halls, safeguard the lord of the empire, the king, and his ministers and aides. May they deliver the master of this repentance rite, ourselves, our parents of three lifetimes, our teachers and kin, from the nine generations above to the seven generations below, all benefactors and donors, all those who dwell in realms yet unilluminated by the sun and moon, the flying and walking, the sinking and floating, the souls suffering in the Nine Dark Hells and all prisons, that they may be freed from calamity and together ascend the shore of the Dao.

One bow.

Today, the assembly of this ritual has heard that in a past kalpa, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation inquired of the heavens above and the earth below, of the manifold sufferings and joys, the causes of sin and blessing. The master of this repentance rite humbly prays that today, offering sincerity, they may come to hear the words of the scripture. What the Perfected One of Universal Salvation once asked—of the heavens above, the multitudes of sages and perfected ones, in golden halls and jade palaces, jeweled terraces and pearl pavilions, celestial palaces—where they roam freely, carefree and transforming, in every manner of indescribable joy.

The Merciful One said: This comes from cultivating the Dao through vast kalpas, step by step ascending the ranks, attaining the status of immortality.

Beneath the heavens, the great sages and exalted ones ride clouds and mount the void, recording the good and evil of the human realm, reporting to the heavens above, receiving Our teachings and commands—some to promote, some to punish. Thus, in those places, within the boundaries of lands and states, floods and droughts, locust plagues, fierce winds and violent rains, the fourfold rise of warfare—all arise from civil and military officials who, relying on their ranks and positions, defy the laws of the land, oppress the myriad people, pervert justice under the guise of public duty, and manipulate the king’s law, thereby incurring such retribution.

As for the people, men and women alike, who in this life suffer manifold illnesses and hardships, various demonic calamities, peril, distress, and adversity, whose bodies are incomplete—those who are poor and lowly, who upon death enter hell, endure all manner of karmic retribution, sink for ten thousand kalpas, and remain in the evil destinies—all this stems from immeasurable kalpas past down to the present kalpa, to this very life and day. Some suffer due to the deeds of their parents, some due to their own actions, the consequences flowing downward and extending onward, creating the three karmas, the six senses, and the ten grave evils. Generation after generation, they inherit all manner of bitter retribution; age after age, they endure every kind of demonic affliction.

What We speak of—the karmic deeds of sentient beings—is such that even a single deed encompasses hundreds of variations. To speak of it briefly would be to leave much unsaid.

At that time, Universal Salvation, having heard the Most High consent to reveal the causes and consequences of good and evil, the matters of karmic retribution, prostrated and bowed to the ground, saying: The Most High has said that sentient beings are foolish and benighted, sunk in the snares of the world, unable to awaken, bound only to karmic conditions, flowing through birth and death, enduring all manner of sin and suffering. We humbly pray that the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy may take pity and deliver them, so that future sentient beings may turn their hearts toward the good Dao, avoid bitter retribution, and escape the nine dark hells of Fengdu and the myriad prisons, where they endure all manner of torture.

The Most High said: If there are men or women who can arouse the natural intention of the Dao, purify their dwellings, and keep their bodies clean and adorned; who set up canopies and seats, install Our image, surround it with banners and flowers, keep lamps burning continuously, burn incense and scatter flowers in offering, sit or walk in mindfulness of the Dao; or who invite Dharma masters, or themselves, for the sake of protecting the state and bringing peace to the people, harmonizing winds and rains, averting disasters and delivering from hardship, safeguarding their dwellings, seeking to extend blessings and longevity, dispelling ghosts and expelling evil; or for the sake of their parents or themselves in times of illness or calamity, when stars and constellations exert their influence, seeking children, or ransoming and liberating those who have left the household life; or for the sake of uncles, brothers, wives, and children; or to console the earth spirits and tomb guardians, protect servants and livestock, and all manner of wealth; or for the sake of masters, lords, Dharma kin, the nine generations of ancestors—parents, brothers, uncles, wives, children, and the six relations—who have passed away, to provide offerings and deliverance; if they but come before Our image, bow to the sacred names of the Heavenly Worthies who manifest in infinite response across the ten directions, offer sincerity like melting snow, and with body and mind repent the sins of immeasurable kalpas, of lives past and present, of every rebirth down to this very day—then their sins shall be extinguished as they wish.

The transformative names of Us, recorded in the scriptures and spread among humankind, dispel heavenly disasters above, eradicate earthly calamities below, and benefit the people in between. In this life and the next, their merit shall never cease. They shall attain peace and stability for the realm, longevity for the emperor, harmony in the stars and constellations, and timely winds and rains. Demons, thieves, and enemies shall become good friends. Venomous creatures and fierce beasts shall harbor no ill intent. Wind, water, fire, and warfare shall cause no harm. Their wishes shall be fulfilled, their prayers answered. The suffering souls in the nine dark hells shall escape their dark prisons and be reborn in the heavenly realms. The four kinds of birth and six destinies shall all attain liberation.

At that time, the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, having heard the Most High expound this repentance Dharma for the deliverance of sentient beings, rejoiced in body and mind beyond all measure, extolling the Heavenly Worthy with these verses:

Excellent is the Primordial Beginning Worthy,
Revered by all in the Three Realms.
His sacred power is beyond thought,
His wisdom and virtue peerless.

Upon the natural seven-jeweled throne,
He manifests in the flowering grove.
Complete in form and appearance,
Unobstructed as the empty sky.

To reveal the profound mystery,
He opens the gates of myriad wonders.
Having realized the supreme Dao,
He turns the wheel of the Great Vehicle.

With skill he expounds the Dharmas,
Universally reviving all beings.
Having heard this Dharma,
Our hearts are purified, our defilements removed.

Overcome with joy,
We bow our heads to the Jade Void.

Today, the assembly of this ritual, along with the repentance master, from immeasurable kalpas past until now, have never before encountered this repentance Dharma. Today, humbly offering prayers for peace and deliverance, we reverently face the compassionate Worthy, the scriptures, and the sacred image, arousing boundless resolve and infinite intention. With our five limbs touching the earth, we wholeheartedly invoke:

We bow our heads to the Compassionate Worthy, reverently honoring the Perfected Sages.

Today, the patrons of this Dao altar, together with the great assembly, reverently pray to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, to all the Venerables and Sages, to all the Great Perfected Ones, and to all the Great Divine Youths—those who pervade the ten directions and fill the boundless realms of mystery, manifesting or concealed in all their majesty.

Through the power of great compassion, the power of inconceivable deliverance, and the power to bring peace to sentient beings, may all beings—whether dwelling in the heavenly realms—be elevated to the Formless Realms; whether in the divine realms, ascend to the Two Form Realms; whether in the human realm, attain the First Desire Realm; and those in the hells, hungry ghost, or animal realms, be reborn as humans, forever freed from suffering and retribution.

We further pray that the Compassionate Venerable, leading all disciples, may manifest and proclaim merit and virtue in this place of ritual repentance, so that:
countless lands receive blessings,
countless beings attain liberation,
countless realms of dharma come to know,
countless superior beings embody the Great Vehicle,
countless middling beings perform offerings,
countless lesser beings generate faith,
countless heavenly dragons guard this place,
and countless vajras sever demonic delusions.

The repentance master [Name], from kalpas without measure past, has cast off bodies and received bodies, taking birth in various realms, up to the present life. Today, may all sins—from the slightest thread or hair, a single name or kind, to those as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—be utterly extinguished from this day forward, with the arising of a single thought. May parents, teachers, uncles, brothers, oneself, spouse, children, the six relations, and all kin, through this act of repentance, together attain liberation and be spared from suffering and affliction. May all beings realize the supreme Dao.

**First Bow**

**Second Fascicle of *The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster Dispelling and Ninefold Darkness***
Compiled by Ge Xuan, Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate

**First Chapter: The Mirror of Compassionate Reflection**

Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, together with the repentance master [Name], reverently join hands and listen attentively to the scriptural words.

The Compassionate Venerable has taught that all sentient beings, in committing even a single deed, generate hundreds of karmic consequences—too many to enumerate in full, so let us speak briefly.

Then the Perfected One of Universal Salvation addressed the assembly, vowing to elucidate the myriad transgressions of future beings before the image of the Compassionate Venerable, repenting each one in turn. Though the causes may not yet be fully expounded, may they be broadly explained, so that beings of endless kalpas may find refuge.

The Compassionate Venerable said: Men and women of the world, casting off bodies and receiving bodies through kalpas without measure, take rebirth due to the sins constructed by the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, reckless indulgence, stinginess, greed, anger, ignorance, delusion, deceitful speech, falsehood, harsh words, divisive speech, envy of those superior, obstructing all things, consuming meat and wine, violating scriptural precepts, damaging sacred images, neglecting fasting rituals, disrespecting teachers, turning from truth to falsehood, believing in perverse views, cursing spirits, failing to honor the Three Treasures, slandering the worthy, scorning the empty and absurd, indulging in sounds and forms, becoming attached to fragrances and flavors, sinking into transgression, creating karma inwardly and outwardly, perpetuating cycles of mutual generation. The six senses arise in turn, compounding faults; the roots of sin grow, and with each thought, wrongdoing forms. There are boundless, immeasurable sins, their number like the dust of the earth, long-accumulated habits residing within. From past causes to present, kalpa after kalpa, with the arising of a single thought, all may be purified—like a bright mirror, where countless particles of dust, from before and behind, even the grease and grime of myriad impurities, accumulate to form obscuring films, dimming inner and outer clarity. Yet once it encounters a skilled craftsman, who wipes, polishes, and refines it, its surface and interior become radiant, reflecting near and far, resplendently clear, restored to its original state. Why? Because its nature is fundamentally pure.

So too are sentient beings: the spirit is originally pure, without defilement. But after receiving form, inner and outer dusts gradually stain it, turning it evil. The six roots, six emotions, six entrances, six defilements, six thieves, six dusts, six desires, six consciousnesses—discriminating and creating delusion—generate a filthy, encumbered body. Inner obscurations and outer afflictions arise, losing the true nature, drifting in the cycle of birth and death, sinking deeper into sin, meeting retribution through karmic conditions, and thus plunging into hell, enduring all manner of suffering, submerged for ten thousand kalpas.

Out of great compassion, I pity sentient beings, and so from kalpa to kalpa, I revolve through the human realm—sometimes in China, sometimes among barbarians; sometimes old, sometimes young; sometimes ordinary, sometimes sacred; sometimes female, sometimes male; sometimes noble, sometimes base—manifesting in various forms, teaching and transforming with skillful means, delivering sentient beings. The scriptural teachings spread, awakening all, enabling them to escape suffering and forever depart from the hells of mud and fire. Yet beings are dull-witted and cannot comprehend. Now, for your sake, I will broadly reveal the causes and conditions, further distinguishing them, so that future beings may turn their hearts toward the good path.

Upon hearing this parable and its distinctions, Universal Salvation’s body and mind leapt with joy. Praising the Compassionate Venerable, he spoke this verse:

Excellent, Primordial Beginning Venerable,
True Father and Mother of all beings.
You expound again the three and six roots,
And further illustrate with the mirror parable.
With skillful means, You rescue the submerged,
With compassion, You deliver from suffering.
Having heard this Dharma,
Our bodies and minds understand all causes.
For endless kalpas in the Dao altar,
You are the Master who preaches for the assembly.

Today, the repentance master of this Dao altar, [Name], prostrates for peace and in supplication for the departed. Having heard the verses and their instructions on the repentance Dharma, this is inconceivable. With five limbs touching the earth, I listen single-mindedly. Bowing my head to the Compassionate Venerable, I reverently pay homage to the true sages.

Today, the patrons of this Dao altar and the great assembly, gazing upward, vow to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, to all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Great Immortals, all the Great Divine Youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless void, past and future, manifest and hidden, all true sages. May the rain of sweet dew wash away all dust and defilement. May the power of compassionate light deliver all beings, guiding them to the other shore, ultimately pure.

Through this repentance text offered by the repentance master [Name] for peace and in supplication for the departed, may the power of deliverance from suffering, the power of support, the power of salvation and protection, the power of disaster elimination, the power of virtue, and the power of peace ensure all wishes are fulfilled. May all sentient beings universally repent together and return to realize the Dao fruit.

One bow.

Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar and the repentance master [Name] once more offer utmost sincerity, listening attentively to the scriptural words. The world in which all earthly beings dwell—the Sahā world—is floating, illusory, defiled, and impure. Hells, hungry ghosts, and animals fill the land of retribution. Few cultivate goodness; many commit evil.

In such a world, the four seasons pass and change, reckoning human lifespans, some long, some short. Spring, summer, autumn, winter—wind, rain, cold, heat—day and night, darkness and light, sun and moon hasten by. The land is of sand and gravel, uneven and treacherous. Mountains and rivers are perilous and obstructed; grasses and trees bear thorns. Not one thing brings joy.

The human body we receive is subject to birth, aging, illness, and death—a temporary aggregation of impurities, fragile and insecure. Because we have bodies, we seek clothing and food, yet often they are insufficient. Hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and deprivation afflict us. The laws of rulers drive us relentlessly; we cannot be at ease. Stubborn and dull-witted, our vision is shallow and clumsy. We associate with unwise companions.

Our eyes see evil forms, our ears hear evil sounds, our noses smell foul odors, our tongues taste bitter flavors, our bodies endure harsh touches, our minds contemplate wicked dharmas—such matters are boundless. Life is impermanent, truly fearful. Thoughts pass in succession, never pausing for even a moment. Swift as a spark from struck stone or a flash of lightning, a hundred years pass in but a few days.

Amidst such countless sufferings, there is no moment of peace. Moreover, beings’ karmic marks persist unbroken. Their natures are stubborn and hard, like earth mixed with tiles and stones. Those of many desires, seeking much profit, suffer greatly. Those who are ever content, though dwelling on earth, are at peace. Those who know no contentment, though in heaven, remain unsatisfied.

Moreover, long-accumulated evil causes sever good roots. Delusion and attachment blind them, preventing awakening. The darkness of ignorance veils their eyes. Some are entangled by new karma; others face retribution for past grievances. As ministers, they are disloyal; as children, unfilial. Their hearts harbor hidden malice; they secretly slander and curse. Evil spirits assail them, leading to repeated illnesses. Unexpected slander arises; misfortune strikes without warning. Careers stall; desires go unfulfilled. Water, fire, and weapons cause harm. Separation and death bring suffering. Countless sorrows and griefs cannot be fully recounted.

Moreover, the hindrance of afflictions is heavy; good fruits are rarely encountered. Even when seen or heard, they do not seek or desire to transcend suffering and be reborn. Instead, they rely on youthful beauty, family and children, towering mansions, and various pleasures, merely preserving their lives. Yet in an instant, all collapses. Regardless of wealth or nobility, the great limit approaches—what use are such pursuits?

Moreover, beings do not realize the world is empty and false, that human and heavenly realms are like dreams. Illness, suffering, and fragility bind them; sorrows entangle them. Time fleets by; cold and heat alternate. Not a moment is spent awakening and cultivating goodness. They only wish to drift endlessly in the sea of suffering, long mired in birth and death.

I pity beings more than parents pity their children. Parents’ love for their children lasts but one lifetime; my compassion for beings spans eternal kalpas. When parents see their children are unfilial, their hearts grow distant. When I see beings are unvirtuous, my compassion only deepens.

Should beings descend into the Nine Dark Hells of Fengdu or the Avīci and other infernal realms of suffering, I ever preach the Dharma, taking their torments upon myself. Now, seeing the questions you have raised concerning the karmic causes of beings’ sins and blessings, it is as though I have swallowed iron and stone, as though an arrow has pierced my heart. My thoughts of compassion and mercy never cease for even a moment. Today, I expound this repentance ritual to rescue those sunk in delusion. You must diligently practice it and broadly deliver beings in future kalpas.

Thus, the Universal Savior proclaims these gāthās anew:

The Primordial Beginning, Supreme and Unsurpassed First Honored One,
Transcends the Three Realms, peerless and without equal.
For countless kalpas, you have accumulated sublime practices,
Perfecting the pure and virtuous causes of blessings and wisdom.
All afflictions and habitual defilements are severed;
Ultimately, old karma is not recreated anew.
Your spiritual penetrations and mighty powers know no fear;
You perceive the Three Times with clarity, discerning the mundane and the real.
Your wisdom and all virtues are perfectly complete,
Gathered into this wondrous Dharma-body.
Though dwelling in hell, you take the place of beings,
Enduring the boiling cauldrons, searing furnaces, and scorching coals.
Frigid waters and icy springs do not harm your body;
Sword trees and blade mountains do not rend your flesh.
Seeing their anguish, your heart is filled with sorrow,
Yet you rejoice in suffering for their sake.
Thus, you attain this wondrous reward-body,
Like the moon cradled in the vast sea, its light serene and clear.
It embraces all without obstruction,
Nurturing the myriad things without exhaustion.
Roaming within the Three Clarities’ Dharma-positions,
Your heart transmits the flow of compassionate transformation without end.
Our praises cannot suffice to extol you,
For your boundless grace spans kalpas beyond reckoning.

Today, in this Dharma-assembly, let each person direct their mind. The repentance-master, so-and-so, acknowledges the emptiness of the Four Great Elements, the transience of the Three Realms, the uncertainty of life’s span, the fragility of the body’s form, and the entanglements of karmic burdens—all offenses are of my own making. Today, encountering this repentance ritual, I vow with utmost sincerity, bowing my head in reverence. May the fires of the Three Poisons be extinguished, and the mind of a hundred virtues arise.

One bow.

**Chapter Two: Repentance of Deluded Thoughts**

Today, in this Dharma-assembly, let each person direct their mind, reverently facing the Merciful Honored One to repent the karmic offenses of deluded thoughts. The repentance-master, so-and-so, gathers their mind, kneels, and listens attentively to the scriptural words.

All beings, from the moment their bodily forms are born, are stained by the impurities of the dust. Eyes behold the five colors, noses smell the five fragrances, tongues taste the five flavors, ears hear the five sounds—all are but chaotic distractions. The true sound is not discerned; the true color is not seen. The mind arises in coarse violence, sinking into infatuation and attachment, giving rise to the roots of manifold karmic deeds, all stemming from deluded thoughts.

Whether man or woman, once the mind’s thought arises and turns toward me, repenting all manner of karmic offenses, first repent deluded thoughts and doubts, then repent all karmic deeds.

The Universal Savior asks, “What are deluded thoughts?”
The Merciful Honored One replies, “Beings’ deluded and inverted thoughts all arise from the mind. Forcibly making distinctions, they fixate on the body, and upon encountering circumstances, delusion arises—every thought is false. For this reason, contemplate the body with wisdom: bones, flesh, skin, bodily form, hair, the six sense faculties, the Four Great Elements, the five viscera, and the hundred spirits. Reflect carefully—there is no true substance to be found. They are merely a temporary aggregation of shared illusions, coalescing to form the body. Searching within and without, where am I to be found? Since the body is illusory, the mind becomes empty. Emptiness and illusion are not real—all are deluded thoughts. The body being a deluded thought, all dharmas are likewise. Self and other, right and wrong, love and hatred, grasping and rejecting, forms, sounds, fragrances, tastes, jealousy, stinginess, greed, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, frivolous speech, harsh words—all karmic deeds, in an instant, are dissolved. Within and without, all is pure and empty, naturally uniting with the true Dao. All such beings, if before the Three Treasures they practice repentance of deluded thoughts...”

Or before the Dao altar, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before the scriptures and dharmas, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before the lectures and praises, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before heaven and earth, the empty void, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before the sun, moon, and stars, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before the images of all sages and revered ones, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before kings and emperors, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before civil and military officials, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before the Dharma-body of those who have left the household, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before parents, uncles, brothers, and all kin, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before teachers, masters, and Dharma-kin, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before the virtuous and wise, they entertain deluded thoughts.
Or before sacred altars and holy traces, they entertain deluded thoughts.
All such deluded thoughts—whether already entertained or yet to arise—once conceived in mind and intent, incur grave transgression.
The mind generates deluded thoughts, and the body bears the karmic burden, afflicting the present household.
It invites demonic adversities, entanglement in the six illnesses, thwarted aspirations, compounded hardships, calamities extending to the seven generations, and fault binding life after life.
Failing to awaken to the true Dharma, not comprehending the real principle, one descends into the fiery gloom of hell.
Enduring myriad torments, one is reborn in a body neither male nor female.
Without repentance, one sinks into eternal perdition.

Then the Merciful One spoke in verse:
*"In life, the mind’s deluded thoughts deceive and mock all things.
At death, one enters the fiery gloom of hell, where form and visage char and rot.
Reborn as neither man nor woman, hideous and despised,
one lives in folly, never hearing the Dharma of true principle."*

Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, together with the repentant one, from limitless kalpas past to this very life and day—teachers, fellow disciples, disciples, parents, brothers, and one’s own flesh and blood—have harbored deluded thoughts yet unrepented.
Now, prostrating in reverence, we offer this repentance text for peace and merit-transference, bowing with the five limbs to the earth.
With single-minded focus, we listen attentively, bowing our heads to the Merciful One, paying homage to the true sages.

With devoted heart, we pay homage to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings, Heavenly Worthy.
With devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Answers Cries for Help.
With devoted heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.

With devoted heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate.
With devoted heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Rescues from Suffering.
With devoted heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Mercy Who Removes Transgressions.

Today, the sponsor of this Dao altar and the great assembly reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, all revered sages, all great Perfected Ones, all great youths, and all true sages across the ten directions, the infinite void, past and future, manifest and hidden.
By the power of the great Dao-mind, the true sage-mind, the boundless mind, the unobstructed intent, the inconceivable intent, and the power of merit,
may the repentant one—from beginningless time through rebirth after rebirth to this very life and day, the nine ancestors and seven generations, one’s own kin, both living and deceased—have all deluded thoughts and inverted karmic causes dissolved through this repentance.
From this day forward, may they realize the true sage-mind and walk the Way of Non-Action.
May evil thoughts and evil karma never again be created.
Further, by the power of the sages and the power of the Dao, may all beings enter the realm of attentive hearing, attain peace and bliss, and awaken to the great Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Three: Removing Doubts**

Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each directing their minds, reverently face the Merciful One to repent the karmic offenses of doubt.
The repentant one gathers their thoughts with utmost sincerity, listens attentively to the scriptural words, and reflects: though the body of beings is fleeting and illusory, it possesses form—pain and itch, ache and soreness, hunger and cold, heat and dampness, inner disturbances and outer contacts, each thought assailing the next.
The mind unbalanced, sorrow and affliction arise together.
How, through contemplation, can these be swiftly eradicated?

The Merciful One says: doubt is but delusion and falsehood.
All that has form is fleeting and illusory, each thought impermanent.
Beings cling to it, falsely perceiving it as real.
If one knows the body is not real, all sufferings vanish.
Simply forget the self, and all delusions are extinguished—how then could pain and itch, ache and soreness remain?

The Universal Savior says: the doubts of beings are deeply entrenched; to suddenly forget the self is truly unattainable.
What expedient means can gradually reveal the causes and conditions?

The Merciful One says: one must resolve the will, contemplate the body with wisdom, listen and reflect carefully—finding no true substance—and yet still generate doubt, which leads to sinking and drowning.
These beings, their karmic actions impure, receive differing retributions.
Like form scattering shadow, like echo responding to sound,
nobility and baseness, good and evil, must manifest in gradation.

Though these gradations exist, beings fail to comprehend their fundamental nature.
They see the long-lived yet do not know their longevity arises from diligent observance of precepts.
They see the short-lived yet do not know their brevity arises from slaughter.
They see the wealthy and noble yet do not know their fortune arises from aiding the poor and relieving suffering.
They see the impoverished and lowly yet do not know their plight arises from greed, theft, and insatiability.
They merely see the long-lived and desire longevity for themselves;
they merely see the wealthy and desire wealth for themselves.
Such yearnings—who is without them?
Unknowing of past karmic causes and conditions, their fate is already determined at birth.
This is called delusion—such are these beings.

Whenever they encounter scriptures and repentance rites, they cannot recite or deeply believe them, thus giving rise to scorn and slander.
They see the realms beyond the Three Realms yet do not believe them to be blissful;
they see the realms within the Three Realms yet do not know them to be suffering.
Beyond the Three Realms lies effortless freedom, heavenly joy, celestial raiment and sustenance, and longevity spanning kalpas—yet they call this suffering.
Within the Three Realms, sun and moon hasten, cold and heat alternate, the four hundred and four illnesses afflict, laws and prisons constrain, blades and warfare rage, floods and fires consume, birth, aging, sickness, and death prevail—yet they call this bliss.
Their nature and perception differ, giving rise to delusion.

They see others observing long fasts and eating plain fare, eschewing adornment, wearing coarse garments and partaking of simple food, their forms like withered wood and their hearts like cold ash—yet do not recognize their transcendence and liberation, only desiring to inflict harm upon themselves.
They see others upholding precepts, reciting scriptures, and practicing the Dao with unwavering diligence, praying for the nation’s peace and their own liberation—yet dismiss it as pointless, thus bringing suffering upon themselves.
They see beauty and conceive slanderous thoughts.
They see others copying scriptures and sacred images yet do not generate faith; instead, they knit their brows and cast sidelong glances, joining in disparagement.
Though incapable of such practices themselves, they harbor doubt in all things.

Before the Three Sages, they raise doubts;
before the Dao altar, they raise doubts;
before the scriptures, they raise doubts;
before the true images, they raise doubts.
Such beings exhaust body and mind in ceaseless toil, their thoughts and intentions ever stirring, their resolves and imaginings giving rise to endless doubt.
When will they ever pause?
Unknowing how to seek the true principle and dispel their doubts, they indulge their karmic roots and wallow in hesitation.
Those who recognize the truth find demonic delusions naturally dispelled;
those who do not recognize it find their doubts ever deepening.
Such people, upon death, enter the Wind-and-Thunder Hell, where they receive differing retributions.

The Merciful One, moved by compassion, once more proclaims this gāthā:
Born into the world with a doubting heart,
they die and enter the Wind-and-Thunder Hell.
Their limbs severed inch by inch,
they weep in sorrow day and night.
They traverse sword trees and blade mountains,
their pain piercing bone and marrow.
Reborn in the bodies of birds and beasts,
their retribution knows no end.

Today, in this grand Dao altar, if any among you remain hesitant and doubtful, failing to sever such thoughts in this life, they will only grow in the next.
It is through the accumulation of good deeds that one attains freedom from transgression.
You have not yet escaped the cycle of birth and death, the turning wheel of rebirth.
If you receive such retribution, what regret will suffice?

Now, having encountered this Dao altar’s repentance rite, you may cleanse past transgressions.
With sincere devotion, prostrate yourselves.
The repentance master, so-and-so, knows that life is fleeting, the body uncertain.
A lifetime is but a moment; how many days are there in a hundred years?
From kalpas immeasurable, you have cast off lives and taken new births, until this present life and day.
Indulging the six senses, you have given rise to doubts.
Together with your teachers, fellow disciples, parents, uncles, brothers, and all kin—those living and deceased—you have accumulated deluded and karmic transgressions, never awakening to them.
Today, we prostrate for peace and offer this repentance rite.
With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, listen attentively.
We bow our heads to the Merciful One, reverently honoring the true sages.

With devoted hearts, we bow to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy, Bestower of Blessings.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves Through Sound.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Tablet and Dharma Treasury.

With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wish.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Great Recluse Perfected.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected Who Delivers from Suffering.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Great Compassionate Perfected Who Saves from Suffering.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Great Merciful Perfected Who Eradicates Transgressions.

Today, the altar’s sponsor, so-and-so, and all present reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, all the venerable sages, all the great perfected, all the divine youths, those who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless cosmos, and encompass past, future, hidden, and manifest—all true sages—to practice the method of gathering thoughts.

May the repentance master, so-and-so, and all kin from nine generations and seven lineages, both living and deceased, who have given rise to doubts and received this repentance rite, attain liberation and enter the gate of faith.
May they steadfastly uphold their resolve, take aspiration as their heart, perceive both inner and outer dharmas, cultivate goodness and perform meritorious deeds, copy scriptures and make offerings to sacred images—without giving rise to doubt or encountering obstacles.

Upon beholding men and women of upright bearing, as well as all manner of good deeds in the world, one vows to forever revere, comply with joy, and encourage such persons, wishing them to attain good fruit. May this extend universally to all beings—those of the four modes of birth and six paths of existence—so that together they may transcend and realize the supreme Dao.
*One bow*

**Chapter Four: Extinguishing the Fire of the Mind**

Today, within this Daoist sanctuary, each member of the assembly directs their mind, gazing reverently toward the Merciful Honored One, repenting and extinguishing the karmic offenses of the mind’s fire.

The repentance master, so-and-so, joins palms, bows in full prostration, kneels, and listens attentively to the scriptural words. All sentient beings, from the first division of south and north, gradually recognize east and west. They cherish the fine and despise the coarse, delight in wealth and resent poverty, their convictions shaping their actions. They fail to measure short and long, covet profit and forget gratitude, estrange kin and favor outsiders. At the sight of adornments, they are insatiable; upon hearing plain truth, they react as if to a foe or enemy. Mountains are likened to sin, while wind resembles good fruit.

Moreover, their wisdom is narrow and shallow, their qi coarse and foolish. They act with abandon, clinging to their own rightness in speech. Greed knows no bounds, and vexation is endless. They regard goodness as an enemy and rejoice at evil. Though they amass vast wealth, they still claim destitution; though their karmic deeds are deep and numerous, they insist all is just. From beginning to end, they neither perceive nor comprehend. Months and years accumulate, yet they neither repent nor regret.

Doubt and delusion arise from the mind itself; ignorance, attachment, greed, and anger also spring from the mind. The mind generates anger and joy, yet ancestral roots and fundamental integrity remain unsteady. They indulge in wine and take life, reveling in their desires. Though their attire is refined—silks adorning their forms—lustful thoughts arise, bringing ruin to families and nations. They boast of youth and strength, flaunting splendor, scorning virtuous friends while clinging to wicked companions. From dawn to dusk, they wallow in confusion, sinking into night’s delirium. They fail to recognize kin or honor parents. Once deluded, they do not turn back—like fire consuming a mountain, wind and flame raging fiercely, nearly impossible to extinguish.

Wind stirs atop fire, its intent rooted in the human heart. Fire blazes, wind rises, the mind pursues, and intention follows. Foolish and common, they cling to defilement as truth. Thoughts stir the wind, blending into illusion.

Thereupon, the Merciful Honored One expounded further in verse:

> Anger’s thoughts are demonic foes,
> Words diverge, discord grows.
> Wills clash, countenances darken,
> Glowering eyes, brows slanted—
> Like the five-hued serpent’s glare.
> Death comes in an instant,
> Entangling one in hell’s torment.
> Exhort all beings to reform and repent,
> Lest they linger in prison’s snare.
> But if the great Dao-mind is aroused,
> All karmic obstacles dissolve and fade.

At that time, the Merciful Honored One addressed the assembly of universal salvation, saying: “The offenses of sentient beings arise from the mind and are extinguished by the mind. With but a single thought, all may be dispelled. Karma’s bonds cling to the body like a rope binding a bird. Though it may wander east, west, south, or north, it flies only as far as the rope allows, feeding wherever it lands, believing itself free. Yet it does not perceive the one who holds the rope, drawing it near to seize it. Only when captured does it know terror. Once in hand, its life and death rest with another. Though it cries and pleads, flapping in distress, there is no escape, no savior.

The karmic deeds of humans are likewise. Failing to restrain the six senses, they indulge the seven consciousnesses, committing all manner of evil without reflection. Karmic bonds form, and they are reborn according to their deeds. The invisible rope of karma binds their minds. Though born into wealth and nobility, or among animals, hungry ghosts, sickness, and evil destinies—wherever they transform, they find fleeting joy, believing themselves content, utterly unaware. Their former creditors, the karmic adversaries, await in the unseen realm, tracking their deeds to claim them. Disaster strikes unseen. Suffering and affliction arise, yet they do not awaken. They blame the gods, embrace false views, kill living beings in sacrifice, endure past misfortunes, and forge new enmities. In that moment, there is no savior, no recourse.

Today, all within this Daoist sanctuary, as the scriptures describe, must reflect deeply and stand in awe. The invisible rope of karma is none other than unwholesomeness. The suffering of rebirth is wrought by the mind. Without repentance, how can it be dispelled? Just as form and shadow arise from ignorance and vanish with its cessation, one must cultivate shame and remorse, purifying body and mind, and repent with utmost sincerity.

The repentance master, so-and-so, from beginningless kalpas until this present life, having cast off and received countless bodies—along with masters, teachers, disciples, superiors, inferiors, parents, siblings, and all kin—has, through the fire of the mind, created karmic conditions beyond measure or reckoning. Today, prostrating in reverence for peace and offering this repentance rite, they cast themselves fully to the ground, listen with single-minded devotion, bow their head to the Merciful Honored One, and pay homage to the true sages.

With devoted heart, they bow to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to cries and saves from suffering.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who cherishes life and delivers beings.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of universally manifest virtue.

With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of flying cinnabar and radiant extremity.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Grove and Primordial Cavern.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of inexhaustible numinous response.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of wisdom and diligent progress.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Floating Netherworld.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of eternal salvation and mercy.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of perfect wisdom.

With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of vast salvation.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of all wonders.

With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of wondrous understanding.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dharma Ocean.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who preserves life and protects destiny.

With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One who saves from suffering.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of universal mercy who protects the realm.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of boundless expanse.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy of carefree joy.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to one’s wishes.

With devoted heart, they bow to the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Perfected of Wondrous Form.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Perfected of Great Mercy who saves from suffering.
With devoted heart, they bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion who removes transgressions.

Today, the master of repentance of this Dao altar, so-and-so, together with the great assembly, reverently beseech the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Great Divine Youths, who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless cosmos, and abide in all times—past and future, hidden and manifest—with the heart of the Great Dao, to manifest the power of non-action, so that the karmic offenses born of the master of repentance’s mind-fire may, by virtue of this repentance, be extinguished.

From this day forward, past faults having been repented, may no new transgressions be committed. If one encounters another who awakens the true and upright heart, cultivating all good fruits, regardless of whether they have attained fulfillment or are still preparing, may we turn our minds and thoughts with joy and humility, clearly advancing that person. May their vows for good conditions, the deliverance of all beings in the Dharma Realm, and ourselves, our nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, the four kinds of birth and six paths of existence, all together attain liberation and return to the Great Dao.

One bow.

*End of the Second Scroll of the Most High’s Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Dissolving Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms*

*Beginning of the Third Scroll of the Most High’s Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Dissolving Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms*

The Venerable Left Immortal Lord Ge Xuan of the Great Ultimate has compiled this text.

**Chapter One: Severing Afflictions**

Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each with focused mind, reverently faces the Merciful Honored One, repenting and severing the karmic offenses of afflictions.

The repentant master, with gathered mind and kneeling in reverence, listens attentively to the scriptural words:

All sentient beings, born from the shelter of their parents’ wombs, may grow in wealth or poverty in youth, rise to nobility or fall into lowliness, commit a single evil or a hundred evils, be male or female—yet they do not comprehend the cycles of rebirth, nor discern its beginning or end.

For afflictions exist. Afflictions arise from clinging to views; clinging to views arises from inversion; inversion arises from delusion; delusion arises from doubt; doubt arises from manifold sufferings; and manifold sufferings arise from all karmic deeds.

Once karmic deeds are created, impermanence presses upon them, leaving no freedom.

The Merciful Honored One addressed Universal Salvation, saying: "Afflictions are what cause sentient beings to take form and dwell in the human world. Not only do the rich and noble, the poor and lowly, men and women all seek clothing and food, but they must also pursue the conditions of life, provide for their needs, sustain their daily use, be bound by royal laws, constrained by hierarchies of honor and humility, unite with kin, and distinguish between love and attachment—even unto old age, sickness, and death. Or, failing to complete their allotted lifespan, they drift with their karma, flowing into the Three Evil Realms, gradually distancing themselves from the paths of humans and heavens. Unaware of the suffering of impermanence, they do not awaken.

Yet those with wisdom and clarity, who embody the absence of thought, who possess insight and perceive delusion, who discern doubt—do not regard these as suffering. They abide in ease and joy, following their thoughts to generate intentions, and their intentions to create karma. They cling to views as truth, invert right and wrong, conjure delusions in response to circumstances, and pursue desires with doubt. Indulging the six senses, they commit sins as numerous as the grains of the Ganges; neglecting the three karmic actions, they sow seeds for boundless hells. All this stems from afflictions, which defile body and mind.

With a body, there are afflictions; without a body, there are no afflictions. Since afflictions exist, one must cultivate and practice.

Universal Salvation asked: "What good must be cultivated to depart from afflictions?"

The Merciful Honored One replied: "Extinguish the three karmic actions and establish the three virtuous practices: the virtuous practice of the mind, the virtuous practice of the body, and the virtuous practice of speech.

First, the virtuous practice of the mind: (1) not coveting, (2) not harboring anger, and (3) not being deluded. Be pure and self-disciplined, desire little and know contentment, restrain greed and abandon the pursuit of profit, be compassionate and patient, gentle and forgiving, subdue anger and remain free from resentment, contemplate the subtle and abide in stillness, comprehend existence and penetrate non-existence, and with wisdom, clearly understand all dharmas. This is called the virtuous practice of the mind.

Next, the virtuous practice of the body: (1) not killing, (2) not stealing, and (3) not engaging in improper sexual conduct. Be benevolent and wise, broadly giving alms, pitying all beings, saving lives and delivering the dying, humble and yielding, taking nothing that is not rightfully yours, and relinquishing body, life, and wealth without reluctance. Be truly pure and clean, far from improper conduct, free from lust and desire, and keep the mind from dissipation. This is called the virtuous practice of the body.

As for the virtuous practice of speech: (1) not lying, (2) not using flowery or deceptive language, (3) not engaging in divisive speech, and (4) not uttering abusive words. Speak truthfully, without falsehood; let your words be genuine, free from embellishment; let your expressions be balanced, upright, and without duplicity; do not create divisions or take sides; let your voice be harmonious, soft, and clear; skillfully expound the Dharma and recite the profound verses. This is called the virtuous practice of speech.

When the three practices are virtuous, there is no doubt. Without doubt, there is no delusion. Without delusion, there is no inversion. Without inversion, there is no clinging to views. Without clinging to views, there are no afflictions. Without afflictions, there are no manifold sufferings. Without manifold sufferings, there are no karmic deeds. Without karmic deeds, there is peace and joy, and one enters the Dao of Non-Action."

Upon hearing the teaching of the three virtuous practices, Universal Salvation realized that all sentient beings could be cured of the illness of afflictions. Praising the Merciful Honored One, he composed this verse:

I bow to the true Dharma Lord among the sages,
Who expounds the medicine for the afflictions of beings.
The priceless treasure within the hearts of beings
Is ever plundered by the six thieves.
The arrow of anger pierces the heart,
The lock of ignorance and attachment has no key.
The shackles of self and others confine the body,
While the demonic thoughts of the six relations plunder it.
Now, relying on the three virtuous practices to drive them away,
For endless kalpas, the four marks shall not cling.

Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, along with the repentant master, having heard of these afflictions, must deeply reflect. For countless kalpas, we have witnessed all sufferings. What was once deemed joy is now suffering in this life, yet we cannot awaken, cannot sever afflictions. Instead, they increase, entangling us in past karma, trapping us in this illusory world, obscuring the Great Dao, and preventing us from awakening to the true essence. Afflictions and calamities arise daily, binding us ever tighter.

Now, having encountered the scriptural teachings of the Merciful Honored One, who broadly expounds the Dharma gates and elucidates afflictions, we are lifted from ignorance. May all sentient beings awaken.

The repentant master, from beginningless kalpas until the present kalpa, in this life and today, along with nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, both the living and the deceased, and all kin—having indulged the three karmic actions of the body, the four of speech, and the ten of the mind, from beginningless ignorance—have created the Three Poisons, the Four Destinies, the Five Hindrances, the Six Dusts, the Seven Leaks, the Eight Defilements, the Nine Knots, and the Ten Entanglements, leaving us without freedom. Afflictions have confined us in cages, casting us into the currents of transmigration.

Today, encountering this repentance ritual is like the sun at noon, the moon at night, the blind regaining sight, the mute speaking, the deaf hearing, the guilty receiving pardon. Prostrating with the five limbs touching the ground, with a single mind, I bow to the Merciful Honored One and reverently pay homage to the true sages.

With sincere mind, I pay homage to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.

With sincere mind, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.
With sincere mind, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Removes Transgressions.

Today, the patrons of this ritual arena, together with the great assembly, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southern Realm, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Immortals and Great Perfected, all the Heavenly Hosts and Divine Youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless cosmos, past and future, manifest and hidden, all true sages. May they together extend their virtuous power to save and protect all beings. May the repentance sponsor, so-and-so, forever sever afflictions, depart from defilement, and for past and present lives, generate virtuous power to assist those in the Three Wretched Realms, forever escape evil destinies, and may all of us attain rebirth in the pure and joyful lands of the ten directions. May all afflictions, habitual sins, and karmic causes, through this repentance, be wholly dissolved. From this day forward, may we practice the true appearance of the Dao, without laziness or negligence. May we attain the power of wisdom and expedient means, dispel all calamities, safeguard the realm, liberate the six paths—both hidden and manifest—deliver the distant souls of the nine generations and three lineages, and together escape the cages of confinement, ascending together to the shore of the Dao.

One bow.

**Second Section: Repentance of the Dusts and Toils of Suffering**

Today, in this ritual arena, each person directs their mind, gazing up to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the sins of all the dusts and toils of suffering. The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, collects their mind, surrenders their life, takes refuge, and listens attentively to the scriptural words.

All beings, from the moment of birth and the formation of their bodies, bear the round heavens upon their heads and tread the square earth beneath their feet. Their flesh is foul and filthy, their bones and flesh rank and base. They do not avoid the stars and constellations, constantly offending wind and rain, accumulating these yang transgressions, inevitably incurring yin offenses. Within heaven and earth, regardless of high or low status, the categories of sins are boundless. Some sins arise from the three karmas, some from the six roots, some from the inner mind’s perversity, some from attachment to external conditions. Some arise from the Three Poisons giving rise to the Four Perversions, some from the three karmas generating the one hundred and eight afflictions, some from the five views producing the sixty-two views, some from the ten evils giving rise to forty kinds of evil, some from the six senses generating the eighty-four thousand gates of dusts and toils. Or from a single thought in a single moment, the Four Perversions arise, the one hundred and eight afflictions are generated, the sixty-two views are established, the forty kinds of evil are committed, and the eighty-four thousand dusts and toils of suffering are created. How much more so for a day, a month, a year—arising from thoughts and intentions? How much more so after passing through kalpas, giving rise to manifold sins? Thus, the toils of suffering follow one after another, without end.

Now, the root of these sins arises from three kinds. The Universal Savior says: What are the three? The first is vexation, the second is karma, the third is thought. Due to these three, one cannot perceive the sages nor the wondrous and excellent affairs of humans and heavens. If in a single day, a single hour, a single thought, one awakens to these three hindrances—even the three karmas, six roots, one hundred and eight afflictions, sixty-two views, forty kinds of evil, and eighty-four thousand dusts and toils of suffering—all may be purified.

Yet these beings do not believe my words, do not follow the scriptural teachings, do not know how to resolve enmity, do not seek liberation. They accumulate evil as numerous as the sands, their sins filling heaven and earth. The Three Poisons, Ten Evils, Five Views, Six Dusts, Six Defilements, Six Entrances—these give rise to uninterrupted karmic offenses. Or they commit incomplete practices, sever karmic actions through faith, slander the Heavenly Worthies, revile the Three Treasures, destroy the worthy and sagely, ruin the true Dharma, disbelieve in sin and merit. They commit the Ten Evil Karmas: delusion turning truth into falsehood, foolish and confused karma; disloyalty to the sovereign, treacherous and flattering karma; unfilial conduct toward parents, rebellious karma; disrespect toward honored teachers, irreverent karma; betrayal of friends, unrighteous karma; committing the Four Grave Offenses that obstruct the sagely Dao; violating pure precepts, breaking the Eight Observances; transgressing the Five Precepts and Seven Hindrances, incomplete and flawed karma; disbelieving the Ten Precepts, regardless of severity, defiling thoughts with expedient means; failing to observe the six long fasts and ten monthly fasts, inconsistent cultivation; improper conduct within the various dignified deportments; the two thousand four hundred subtle dignified deportments; hindering the cultivation of bodily precepts, mental concentration, and wisdom; committing various offenses during the spring and autumn Eight Kings’ festivals; engaging in manifold evils, violating the six dignified deportments; lacking compassion toward suffering beings, unfeeling and unmindful karma; failing to rescue or aid, lacking salvation and protection; harboring jealousy, generating self-and-other karma; unequal treatment of enemies and loved ones; indulging in the Five Desires without weariness, failing to renounce; seeking ease through clothing, food, gardens, baths, and ponds, generating frivolous karma; or directing leaky merit toward the Three Sages, obstructing the path of leaving the household. Such karmas are boundless and immeasurable, impossible to fully recount.

Universal Salvation asked, "With what mind should one act to extinguish these karmic obstructions and transgressions?"

The Merciful Honored One replied, "First, one must arouse seven kinds of wholesome minds as expedient means to achieve their eradication. What are the seven?

1. Shame and remorse,
2. Fear and dread,
3. Weariness and renunciation,
4. The arising of the supreme wholesome mind,
5. Equal regard for enemies and loved ones,
6. Mindfulness of repaying the kindness of the Heavenly Worthy, the sovereign, the master, and parents,
7. Contemplation that all delusive thoughts and the nature of transgressions are empty.

If one fails to cultivate these wholesome minds and does not arise repentance, calamities will afflict distant ancestors, misfortunes will taint future generations, and in this present life, one will suffer blindness, deafness, and chronic illness. At death, one will fall into the nine dark hells, remaining for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth—emaciated, ghostly, and inhuman in form."

Then the Merciful Honored One spoke this verse:

If one harbors an unwholesome mind,
And without cause commits manifold karmas—
Even a single thread or hair,
Or countless billions—
At death, one enters the eighteen hells,
Enduring every kind of suffering.
Later reborn among starving tigers,
Forever denied a full meal.
Even if one gains a human body,
One is slain by water, fire, or the sword,
Or suffers chronic illness,
Madness, or epilepsy.

Today, in this grand Dharma assembly, as the scripture declares, we ought to be deeply terrified. Within this body lie such toils and afflictions—how, through kalpas uncounted, could we have awakened to them, shrouded as we are in ignorance? Some commit the ten evils themselves; others teach the ten evils; still others praise the ten evils or openly advance them. With every thought and every moment, one dwells upon the ten evils. Even for a single hair’s weight of transgression, one will one day receive its retribution—how could remorse then avail?

Now, we must strive with diligence and repent with vigor. Whether in the six paths or among the four modes of birth, seeing those who suffer or are yet to suffer, I now generate the aspiration that all may equally attain liberation.

The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, prostrates in reverence, dedicating this repentance rite for peace and to offer posthumous merit. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, he bows his head to the Merciful Honored One and pays homage to the true sages.

With sincere mind, he pays homage to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.
With sincere mind, he pays homage to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to cries and saves from suffering.

With sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of profound understanding.
With sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of great compassion who saves from suffering.
With sincere mind, he pays homage to the Perfected One of great mercy who extracts transgressions.

Today, the sponsor of this Dharma assembly and all present reverently aspire that the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the southern direction, all the honored ones and sages, all the great perfected ones, all the great divine immortals, all the great celestial immortals, and all the great youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless cosmos, past and future, responding to every name—all true sages, may with the Great Mysterious Water wash away the karmic afflictions, transgressions, and toils of the repentance sponsor, so-and-so, his parents who gave him life, his masters who transmitted the Dharma and conferred ordination, his uncles, brothers, male and female kin, and all sentient beings bound by present and past conditions, infinite and immeasurable.

By the power of this repentance, may we rely on the power of the Dao, the power of the true sages, the power of the repentance rite, the power of cause and effect, the inconceivable power, and the power of merit, so that all may be extinguished, all views awakened, and the profound principle thoroughly understood. May all beings, without exception, transcend the toils and transgressions of worldly dust, realize the unconditioned, and take refuge in the Great Dao.

**First Prostration**

**Chapter Three: Returning to Faith and Reverence**

Today, in this grand Dharma assembly, each person directs their mind upward to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the transgressions of irreverence and lack of faith.

The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, bows his head and kneels in reverence, listening attentively to the scripture’s words: All sentient beings, creating evil causes and acting inappropriately, harbor minds like raging fire, burning fiercely without discrimination. Whether ugly or fair, their thoughts are sharp as blades, their severity sparing neither strong nor weak. Over time, days accumulate into months, months into years, yet they fail to cultivate even a moment’s goodness. Day by day, their transgressions grow, and their enmities multiply, increasing their suffering karma and consigning them to eternal submersion.

From past conditions to present, from kalpa to kalpa, with every thought and intention, they generate irreverence and lack of faith, slandering the Three Sages, defaming the Three Sages, belittling the Three Sages, defiling the Three Sages, mocking the Three Sages, cursing the Three Sages, reviling the Three Sages, deceiving the Three Sages, arrogantly scorning the Three Sages, contemptuously deriding the Three Sages, devouring the offerings to the Three Sages, deluding the Three Sages, encroaching upon the Three Sages, wasting and damaging the possessions of the Three Sages.

They disparage scriptures and repentance texts, debate their authenticity, recklessly discuss gains and losses, obstinately argue right and wrong, distinguish shallow and deep, and collectively criticize strengths and weaknesses. Their appearance is unclean, their clothing is unclean, their hands and feet are unclean, their sandals are unclean, their breath is unclean.

They drink wine and eat meat, consuming pungent and spicy foods, uttering foul language, their hearts lacking reverence. Some do not wash their hands, some do not burn incense, some do not rinse their mouths, some do not bathe, yet they enter the sacred altar or approach the Dharma seat. Some go to the Daoist sanctuary to listen to the Dharma and sutras, pressing close to the revered images, defiling the true sages—divine immortals, spirit persons, jade lads and jade maidens, vajra guardian kings, heavenly marshals, and mighty warriors, the protective and awe-inspiring deities.

Some, in the presence of the Heavenly Worthy, the great Dao, the scriptures and Dharma, or the monastic Dharma-body, display arrogance and disdain, refusing to bow in reverence or prostrate in sincerity. Some lie down while listening to the great virtuous masters expound the Three Caverns’ Mahayana scriptures. Some, reeking of wine, meat, and pungent foods, ride in carriages or on horses straight into the sanctuary, approaching the Heavenly Worthy to read or recite scriptures and repentance texts. Some, upon seeing others observe fasts and receive precepts, refuse to believe or follow, dismissing them as hypocritical. Some bring men and women together into the sanctuary to listen to the Dharma and sutras, speaking loudly and disrupting the assembly. Some, when speaking or forming intentions, first debate right and wrong, comparing merits and virtues. Some rely on the Three Treasures to cunningly seek wealth. Some misuse the Dharma teachings to deceive men and women. Some embezzle the wealth of the Three Treasures to sustain themselves. Some threaten or coerce monastics, seeking their faults to extort their possessions and support their families. Some carry scriptures and images into the marketplace to preach. Some, while traveling, falsely claim merit to gather wealth for themselves. Some pawn scriptures and images, lending them for profit to provide for their kin. Some, when expounding the Dharma from high seats, take the offerings for their own use. Some, without studying the scriptures, precepts, talismans, or ritual texts, set themselves up as masters, accepting offerings. Some indiscriminately recruit disciples, not selecting the worthy, and transmit the scriptures and Dharma, leaking true secrets. Some, without following the regulations, receive teachings from masters, acting on their own whims to alter or augment the scriptures and Dharma. Some expose sacred images to dust and filth, damaging the permanent abode. Some let halls and temples collapse, defiling the scriptures and Dharma. Some destroy banners, lamps, and merit offerings, disrespecting the radiant countenances. Some steal precious scriptures, treating them like common texts. Some privately copy them without care, mixing them with mundane books, showing no reverence. Some place beds and pillows where they sleep beside them. Some, in their chambers, leave foul and disorderly messes, handling pungent foods while reciting true scriptures. Some betray the Dao and their masters, violating their vows.

All such intentions and mental formations transgress the bright statutes and violate the precepts. These offenses are measureless and boundless. If one commits even the slightest act of irreverence or disbelief, in this life their family will be incomplete, their departed kin will suffer, and they themselves will receive the karmic retribution of leprosy. Upon death, they will fall into the Nine Dark Hells, enduring ten thousand kalpas before rebirth, where they will take the form of wild beasts.

Then, the Compassionate Worthy, for the sake of those yet to awaken, spoke these verses:

Born into the world without reverence,
Defiling the true forms of the Dao.
The lofty sages and immortal perfected,
Spirit persons and divine beings,
Jade lads and jade maidens,
Vajra guardians and mighty warriors,
Attendant protective deities—
All such sacred forms,
If damaged or treated with contempt,
Defiled and disrespected,
Slandering monastics,
Speaking without propriety,
Striking, scolding, oppressing, or neglecting,
Committing lewd acts or mocking,
Arrogant and scornful,
Debating the scriptures and Dharma,
Forcibly arguing right and wrong,
Breaking fasts and precepts,
Stealing the wealth of the Three Treasures,
All manner of irreverence—
Upon death, they fall into the Nine Dark Hells,
Enduring the eighteen realms of suffering.
Their feet tread upon mountains of knives,
Their hands grasp trees of swords.
Naked, they embrace bronze pillars,
Their bare bodies lie upon iron beds.
Fire mountains rest upon their heads,
Iron rods press upon their backs.
Hungry, they eat burning coals;
Thirsty, they drink molten bronze.
Boiling cauldrons seethe and scald,
Fire chariots burn their bodies.
Pounded by pestles, ground by mills,
Hung upside down or stood on their heads,
Sawn apart, sliced by blades,
Needles pierce their limbs and joints.
Narrow gorges crush their bodies,
Frigid ice severs their sinews and bones.
Scorching embers chase them east and west,
Leaping and stumbling without rest.
Abiding in foul and stinking places,
Drowning in dark and turbid waters,
Poured into the four rivers,
Evil birds peck out their eyes.
Bronze dogs bite and tear,
Poisonous snakes compete to devour.
Ox-headed demons break their spines,
Dying and reviving ten thousand times a day.
Unbearable pain—
In life, they suffer leprosy.
Today, the great assembly in this sanctuary,
Hearing these verses as the scriptures describe,
Should deeply reflect in alarm and sorrow.
How can one awaken to such karmic causes?
If such sins are committed, retribution is inescapable;
When remorse comes, it will be too late.
Each should diligently advance,
Sincerely repent their transgressions.
If, within the six paths, one takes the four forms of birth—
Great or small bodies—
They devour one another.
If retribution has not yet been received,
Now, with reverence,
May all be liberated.

The repentance master [Name] prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text for the deliverance of the departed. With five limbs touching the ground, wholeheartedly they arise in devotion:
Prostrating to the Compassionate Worthy, reverently bowing to the true sages.
With sincere devotion, they bow to the Jade Clarity Bestowing Blessings Heavenly Worthy.
With sincere devotion, they bow to the Hearer of Cries Saving from Suffering Heavenly Worthy.

With sincere devotion, they bow to the Great Merciful Remover of Transgressions Perfected.

Today, the patrons of this Dao altar and all the assembly reverently pray to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southern Realm, to all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Heavenly Immortals, all the Great Divine Youths, all the Great Dragon Spirits—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless void, manifesting and concealed, all true and sacred beings.
We humbly pray that the realms of suffering be swept away, and the roots of evil be eradicated.
The penitent, so-and-so, from the time of this bodily existence, for all transgressions committed, now repents with utmost sincerity, and with a single thought, beseeches their dissolution.
From this day forward, may we constantly hold faith and reverence, reflect upon past wrongs, and purify the heart in remorse.
May we, in future lives, turn the wheel without cease, attain eternal longevity, and may the departed souls all ascend to the realms of rebirth.
May our present kin ever dwell in blessed lands.
May we realize the formless, and swiftly ascend to the sacred fruit.

One bow.

**Chapter Four: Removing Obstacles**

Today, in this Dao altar, each member of the assembly directs their mind, reverently facing the Compassionate Venerable, repenting the sins of obstacles.
The penitent, so-and-so, kneels with utmost sincerity, attentively listening to the scriptural words:
All sentient beings, through the mind of greed and desire, arouse the six consciousnesses, the six dusts, the six desires, and the six defilements, giving rise to deluded and false thoughts, generating all manner of obstacles.
Clearly committing sins, yet the mind remains unaware.
Repeatedly doing wrong, yet words still claim righteousness.
All due to ignorance—how can one recognize transgressions?
Only seeing others’ faults while praising one’s own virtues, how can one distinguish others’ reverence?
Unaware of my own inferiority, I divide bodies into noble and base, high and low, never equal.
The noble dwell in lofty halls and towering chambers, draped in purple and girded with gold, with vermilion walls and pepper-scented chambers, jade terraces and cinnabar railings.
The base are barefoot servants, following behind and leading ahead, their voices faint, their demeanor lowly.
The wealthy wear light furs and ride fat horses, feasting on fine delicacies, their words resonant as bells, their hearts vast as the sea.
The poor are consumed by hunger and cold, neglecting rites and propriety, their words and deeds at odds, their actions improper.
In these bodily karmas, how can one uphold and maintain? The transgressions multiply—who can awaken?
Yet within the world’s snare, the mind of obstruction arises.
Obstructing others from taking refuge in the Three Treasures and the sacred teachings of the Heavenly Worthy.
Obstructing others from believing in and revering the scriptures and Dao of the Great Way.
Obstructing others from loyalty to the sovereign.
Obstructing others from serving and honoring masters, superiors, and those of the Dharma.
Obstructing others from filial piety toward parents.
Obstructing others from turning scriptures and practicing the Dao for the realm.
Obstructing others from eliminating calamities and seeking blessings for the family.
Obstructing others from diligent service to the realm.
Obstructing others from toiling for the family.
Obstructing others from arousing the mind for the supreme Dao.
Obstructing others from chanting and singing the Dao.
Obstructing others from upholding precepts and maintaining purity.
Obstructing others from liberating lives.
Obstructing others from reciting scriptures to cultivate goodness.
Obstructing others from enduring humiliation and bearing shame.
Obstructing others from joyful almsgiving.
Obstructing others from diligent cultivation.
Obstructing others from dwelling in mountains and valleys, practicing qi absorption and exhalation.
Obstructing others from seeking the Dao and pursuing ascension.
Obstructing others from copying scriptures and adorning scroll ribbons.
Obstructing others from sculpting sacred images to inspire faith.
Obstructing others from constructing numinous altars and Daoist abbeys, and inviting others to reside and maintain them.
Obstructing others from preparing vegetarian feasts and making offerings.
Obstructing others from disciplining the body and refining conduct, polishing the heart and nature.
Obstructing others from making offerings to the Dharma body.
Obstructing others from reverent incense offerings and cultivation.
Obstructing others from equality and non-duality.
Obstructing others from leaving worldly defilements and forever removing afflictions.
Obstructing others from repenting and confessing transgressions to escape calamities.
Obstructing others from maintaining the altar’s incense and lamps day and night.
Obstructing others from cultivating wisdom and intelligence through constant study of scriptures.
Obstructing others from learning arts to adorn their name and body.
Obstructing others through affection and love.
Obstructing others through bonds of sentiment.
Obstructing others through profit and aid.
Obstructing others through instruction and guidance.
Obstructing others through greed and attachment.
Obstructing others through disdain and contempt.
Obstructing others through indulgence and falsehood.
Obstructing others from all manner of good deeds—even the slightest good deed of another.
Once a good deed arises, one must not arbitrarily create obstacles.
Those who create obstacles, for their own sake, do not recognize that good deeds are the path to liberation from worldly dust. Unable to practice themselves, they instead create mutual obstructions.
For every obstacle or hindrance created, one incurs boundless and immeasurable sins, causing one’s present self to suffer old age, illness, solitude, and unfulfilled wishes, and upon death, to enter the Nine Dark Hells, enduring all sufferings. Only after ten thousand kalpas may one be reborn as a fish or turtle, subjected to human carving and slicing.
Without repentance, there is no means of liberation.

At that time, the Compassionate Venerable, saving all sentient beings, spoke this verse:
*In past lives, without a good heart,*
*Obstructing all things.*
*Speaking dark and deceitful words,*
*Claiming past wrongs as the path.*
*Bonds of affection and love,*
*Greed, attachment, and contempt—*
*Clinging together in evil,*
*Upon death, entering the Flowing Sands Hell.*
*Even if reborn as a human,*
*One suffers poverty, cold, and solitude.*
*In this life, enduring long illness,*
*Good medicine turns to poison.*

Today, in this Dao altar, each member of the assembly directs their mind, hearing this verse, truly filled with sorrow and grief.
If one bears such sins of obstruction, when retribution comes, it will be difficult to repent and withdraw.
Now, we must vow to dissolve and remove these karmic obstacles.
The penitent, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, fully prostrating with the five limbs, wholeheartedly making this vow.

We bow our heads to the Merciful Honored One, reverently paying homage to the True Saints.
With devoted hearts, we reverently pay homage to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy Who Descends with Blessings.

Today, the penitent and the entire assembly of this Dao altar, gazing upward, vow to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southern Realm, to all the Venerable Ones and Saints, all the Great Divine Immortals, all the Great Perfected Beings, all the Great Perfected Persons, and all the Divine Youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the boundless cosmos, past and future, hidden and manifest, all True Saints.

By the inconceivable power of the great Dao, the subtle and wondrous power of merit and virtue, and the responsive power of the Merciful Honored One’s name, may the penitent’s nine generations of ancestors, fellow masters and teachers, disciples and dharma companions, as well as parents, uncles, brothers, and all living and deceased family members—across both this life and the next—have all their heavy karmic obstructions, vast as mountains and deep as the sea, dissolved and eradicated through this act of repentance.

May they rely on the power of the divine immortals, the dragon deities, the Three Saints, and the Perfected Persons to forever extinguish these obstacles. May those who have sunk into suffering ascend to rebirth, free from further affliction. From this day forward, may they, upon seeing others cultivate all manner of good deeds, never again generate obstacles. May the seeds of goodness grow ever stronger, universally delivering all sentient beings to together transcend into the Pure Land.

One bow.

**Chapter One: Ceasing Anger and Resentment**

Today, the entire assembly of this Dao altar, each directing their minds, gazing upward to the Merciful Honored One, repent for the karmic offenses of anger and resentment. The penitent, so-and-so, collects their thoughts, kneels in reverence, and listens to the scriptural words:

All sentient beings, arising from clinging views, give rise to anger and resentment. The source of anger and resentment lies solely in the mind. When the mind generates anger and resentment, it is like fire and wind. When wind and fire blaze fiercely, they soon subside of their own accord. Yet these sentient beings, unable to let go, cling to foolish views, giving rise to anger and resentment. Sometimes, from greed and attachment, the six senses are stirred, defiled by the six dusts, and the thought of anger arises. Or they resent the Heavenly Worthies of the great Dao, deeming their words lacking in truth and uprightness, uttering only frivolous speech, ever devoid of faith. Or they resent heaven and earth, cursing the cold and heat, embracing only ignorance, unashamed before the vastness that covers and supports all. Or they resent the sun, moon, and stars, exposing their bodies without shame, unabashed before their illumination, constantly complaining of their slowness or swiftness. Or they resent the scriptures, dismissing them as empty words, failing to study and explore them, often slandering or praising them. Or they resent their parents, neglecting filial duties, utterly lacking in devotion and care, ungrateful for their toil. Or they resent their brothers, lacking the bond of shared roots, treating them as outsiders, their affection no deeper than distant friends. Or they resent their family members, failing to cultivate kindness and gentleness, deficient in respect toward superiors and unrestrained in their treatment of subordinates. Or they resent the precepts and fasts, performing them without reverence, frequently violating them, lacking in sincerity and devotion. Or they resent the ruler, failing to praise the peace of the realm, harboring thoughts of rebellion and murder, not establishing loyalty and goodness. Or they resent those who expound the teachings, refusing to listen to good causes, uttering only harsh words, confounding truth and falsehood. Or they resent the temples and monasteries, failing to revere and support them, engaging in excessive slander, unwilling to contribute to their construction and maintenance. Or they resent the departed, lacking in memorial rites, not creating good causes to aid their journey in the dark realms. Or they resent the divine principles, neglecting sacrifices, instead trusting in heretical shamans, engaging in licentiousness and killing. Or they resent the elderly, failing to show filial piety, devoid of compassion, attributing their condition to karmic retribution. Or they resent the prisons, not examining the circumstances, constantly speaking of hardships, aiding in the addition of shackles and restraints. Or they resent the poor and lowly, wrongfully oppressing them, making it difficult for them to voice their grievances, unmindful of their hunger and cold, perpetually subjecting them to suffering. Or they resent the birds and beasts, unmindful of their feathers and fur, only indulging in greed and cruelty, seeking only to slaughter and cook them. Or they resent their servants, unable to endure their lowly status, only knowing how to inflict suffering.

Such anger and resentment—whether already committed or not, whether toward kin or strangers, whether by men or women, whether by humans or non-humans—when the mind conceives and the intention arises, giving rise to anger and resentment, it is like wood giving birth to fire, fire arising naturally. The transgression deepens, the fault becomes most grave, and the departed ancestors remain confined in the dark realms, unable to attain liberation.

Thereupon, the Merciful Honored One, observing these sentient beings recklessly indulging in anger and resentment, sighs with compassion and speaks this verse:

All you men and women,
Listen carefully and reflect well.
Before the Heavenly Worthy of the great Dao,
Never give rise to anger and resentment.

Before kings and parents,
In scripture halls and Daoist sanctuaries,
Beside preachers who expound and praise the Dharma,
Never give rise to anger and resentment.
Should you see renunciates,
Or virtuous ones who revere goodness of heart,
Who give alms to the poor,
Or prisoners and wayfarers,
Who tread upon the orphaned and exposed,
The sick and the fatherless—
Yet still, some men and women
May conceive anger and resentment.
Like wood giving birth to fire,
Fire arises naturally in return.
Only by relinquishing clinging views
And awakening to the impermanent Dao
can this be overcome.

Thereupon, the Merciful Honored One spoke again:
If sentient beings commit even a single act of anger or resentment,
In this life they will suffer from wind and perverse illnesses.
At death, they enter the Eight Cold and Eight Hot Hells,
Then pass through the Needle-Peak Hell,
Where only after ten thousand kalpas are they reborn—
Their bodies as frogs, toads, or *hóu* fish.
Even if they return to the human realm,
They remain dull-witted, clumsy, and malevolent.
Without repentance, they sink forever into darkness.

Thus, the Merciful Honored One, mindful of those yet unawakened,
proclaimed these verses once more:

In this world, many harbor anger,
Ever nursing minds of poison and harm.
Their thoughts ever constricted,
They rage at men, they rage at women,
At livestock and servants—
Such bodies, seared by sorrow.
Wielding knives or clubs,
They seek only to harm.
Fuming with resentment,
Never knowing even brief joy.
At death, they enter the cold and hot hells,
Where needles pierce their bodies,
Through heart and liver,
Through intestines and flanks.
Blood flows without measure.
Later, they are reborn as frogs,
Or mute in the moon’s light,
Or as *hóu* fish.
Floating in anger upon the water,
Hawks and kites descend to seize them,
Tearing and devouring their flesh.
Even if reborn among humans,
They suffer the retribution of dullness,
Ever ugly and awkward,
Their words lacking skill,
Their speech offending others,
No one to show them pity.

Today, in this grand assembly,
As the scriptures declare,
All should reflect deeply:
Those who bear such sins
Will endure retribution most profound.
Now, in repentance,
May all attain liberation together.

The repentant one, [Name], prostrates in reverence,
Offering this text of repentance for peace and deliverance.
With five limbs touching the earth,
Attending with single-minded focus,
They bow their head to the Merciful Honored One,
And pay homage to the true sages:

With devoted heart, they bow to
The Heavenly Worthy Who Descends with Blessings of Jade Clarity,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Void,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Clarity’s Highest Summit,
The Nine-Colored Heavenly Worthy of Dragon Form,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Preaches in the Fragrant Grove,
The Heavenly Worthy Whose True Countenance Radiates Light,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Lamp of Dharma and Sea of Wisdom,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Truly Awakens and Delivers from Suffering,
The Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Wisdom Who Delivers from Suffering,
The Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Brilliance Who Extends Lifespan,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Shades All Boundaries,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Transforms the Three Realms,
The Heavenly Worthy of Non-Action,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Entrusts the Substance,
The Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Talismans,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Grove,
The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Light,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Those to Be Delivered,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny,
The Heavenly Worthy of Grand Unity Who Saves from Suffering,
The Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Guards the Realm,
The Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Limits,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue,
The Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes,
The Perfected One Who Universally Saves,
The Perfected One Who Universally Delivers,
The Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering,
The Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Eradicates Transgressions.

Today, the repentant one of this assembly,
Along with all present,
Raises their aspirations toward the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the southwest,
And all the honored ones, all the sages,
All the great Perfected Ones, all the great immortals,
All the great divine youths,
Who pervade the ten directions,
Fill the boundless void,
And manifest as all true sages—
May they together emit rays of compassion,
And together extend their sheltering protection.

The repentant one, [Name], from kalpas without measure,
Has committed sins of anger and resentment without limit.
Today, in prostration and repentance,
They pray for these to be extinguished,
To escape retribution,
And attain perpetual purity.
From this day forward,
May they never again harbor anger or resentment,
May they clearly understand clinging views,
And embody the true and eternal.

May the departed spirits of their ancestors,
And all their kin—past, present, and future—
Forever sever the bonds of transgression,
Never traverse the Nine Dark Realms,
Nor the four modes of birth or six paths of existence,
But together receive the fruits of karma,
And inherit the supreme Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Two: Repentance for Delusion**

Today, in this grand assembly,
Each person directs their mind,
Bowing their head to the Merciful Honored One,
Repenting the sins of delusion.

The repentant one, [Name], with reverent faith,
Attends to the scriptural words:
All sentient beings arise from the primal qi in delusion,
Clinging to existence.
Though they accumulate merit and diligence,
They cannot escape obstruction.
Thus, they cultivate good fruits,
That they may attain liberation.

Yet these sentient beings,
Not understanding how to cultivate merit,
Accumulate good virtues,
But give rise to the three poisons,
And commit acts of delusion.
Some curse heaven and earth,
Or revile spirits and gods.
Some rebel against rulers and fathers,
Failing in loyalty and filial piety,
Turning to perversity,
Establishing laws that disrupt order,
Favoring their own kin within,
Flattering others without,
Disbelieving in sin and blessing,
Conceiving thoughts against all bounds,
Claiming their nature is self-arising,
Eternal and indestructible,
Making no distinction between good and evil,
No difference between elder and younger,
Passing through lives and rebirths,
Ever acting in delusion.
Some, before sacred images,
Or in places of scripture and Dharma,
Or before Dharma masters,
Or beside kings, parents, or teachers,
Or among fellow students, monastic kin,
Or among the six relations—branches and vines of flesh and blood—
Wives, concubines, sons, and daughters,
Or beneath heaven and earth, sun, moon, and stars,
Or in temples of numinous spirits,
Or before the traces of sages in the empty sky,
Or among humans, non-humans, insects, beasts, and birds,
Commit acts of delusion,
Mock those who practice goodness and give alms,
Or perform meritorious deeds,
Thus incurring sins of slander and defamation.

All such acts are called delusion, arising ever from the heart. Should one commit delusion in even a single name or place, the offense entangles distant ancestors and brings calamity upon the living, leaving no recourse for remorse. Bound in darkness, they suffer in this life from perverse winds and grievous afflictions, meeting death only to enter the Frigid Night Hell, where after ten thousand kalpas they are reborn in the body of a venomous serpent. Without repentance, they sink forever in the evil destinies.

Moved by compassion for those yet unawakened, the Merciful Venerable One spoke this gatha:

In the world of men, those who are deluded,
Who disbelieve in sin and merit,
Mock those who cultivate virtue and merit,
And say there is no past life.
They show no reverence for sun and moon,
Nor for heaven, earth, and stars.
All numinous and holy beings,
They slight and scorn without exception.
Ever committing unwholesome deeds,
They engage in every kind of evil.
Clinging stubbornly to their own nature,
At death they enter the Eighteen Hells,
Enduring every torment and affliction,
Reborn after ten thousand kalpas as serpents.
Their hearts ever filled with venom,
Their bellies devoid of organs.
Hungry and thirsty, they find no food,
And all who see them seek to kill.
Even if reborn among humans,
They still suffer the retribution of delusion.

Today, the great assembly in this Dharma hall, hearing these verses, are filled with awe and dread. Should any bear such transgressions, their retribution will be exact and unerring. Let us all awaken, lest we suffer the same fate. When the day of our sinking comes, even if we seek repentance, it may be too late. Or we may endure the torments of hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts, unable to transcend, until together we resolve to seek liberation.

The penitent, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, throwing himself fully to the ground, concentrating his mind in single-pointed resolve. He bows his head to the Merciful Venerable One, paying reverence to the true and holy.

Through the great compassion and salvation of the Dao, they resolve to universally deliver all.

The penitent, so-and-so, for his ancestors of past lives, his birth parents, his karmic parents, his preceptor who conferred the precepts, the masters who established the altar and sponsored the rites, his uncles and brothers, his own kin and in-laws, his wives, sons, and daughters, and all his living and deceased family—should any bear boundless and immeasurable deluded transgressions, whether already committed or yet to be, whether already awakened or yet unawakened—by virtue of this Dharma hall today, he repents and seeks their eradication. From this day forward, he vows never to commit them again. May all beings forsake the three evil destinies and together attain liberation, gradually realizing the unconditioned and reaching the shore of the Dao.

One bow.

**Repentance of Stinginess and Greed, Third Scroll**

Today, in this Dharma hall, each member of the great assembly directs his mind upward, gazing toward the Merciful Venerable One, repenting the transgressions of stinginess and greed.

The penitent, so-and-so, collects his mind and gathers his thoughts, listening attentively to the scriptural words. All beings dwell in the floating world, where a hundred years pass in but a few days. In the midst of this fleeting time, like the flash of a spark from struck stone, how can one endure? Like a moth darting into flame, they seek their own destruction. Unable to awaken and comprehend, they remain entangled without respite. Day by day, their transgressions accumulate, and with each passing moment, their sins and sufferings grow. Clinging to miserliness, they are ever burdened by greed, amassing wealth as high as mountains, yet their hearts remain unsatisfied. They plan for a single day’s life as if it were a thousand years. Yet when they were born, they brought not a single coin, and when they die, they take not a single coin away. In a single morning’s departure, all is emptiness. Boundless stinginess and greed become the seeds of transgression.

Or before the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or before the great treasury of scriptures, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or before the Dharma bodies of those who have left the household life, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or in places of fasting, precepts, and offerings, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or in places of burning incense and lighting lamps, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or in the construction of monasteries, halls, and temples, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or upon the field of merit and virtue, they harbor stinginess and greed.

Or before emperors and kings, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or before fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or before the worthy and the elders, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or regarding others’ or their own wealth and possessions, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or at the sight of food and drink, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or at the sight of carriages and horses, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or at the sight of clothing and adornments, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or at the sight of vast fields and estates, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or at the sight of magnificent dwellings, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or at the sight of servants and slaves, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or upon seeing dilapidated temples and monasteries, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or upon seeing towering forests and mountains, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or upon seeing lush blossoms and rotting fruit, they harbor stinginess and greed.
Or upon seeing the poor, the aged, and the sick, they fail to think of relief and deliverance, harboring stinginess and greed.
Or upon seeing prisoners in suffering, they neglect compassion and remembrance, harboring stinginess and greed.
Or upon seeing travelers in distress, they refuse to aid and rescue, harboring stinginess and greed.
Or upon seeing the hungry and cold with emaciated bodies, they withhold what is needed, harboring stinginess and greed.

Even to the slightest—whether their own possessions, others’ belongings, public goods, or common property; be it a thread, a hair, a blade of grass, a tree, a flower, a fruit, a grain of rice, or a pinch of wheat—they either gluttonously consume or hoard with miserly attachment. Toward others, they act with stinginess and contempt, refusing to perform good deeds or make offerings. They torment themselves with accumulation, burdened by worry and vexation. They wish wealth for themselves and poverty for others. When their bodies perish, they are like a boat without oars, like a cart without wheels—only evil deeds remain, with no goodness to record. Thus, the karmic causes lead them to fall into the evil destinies.

Thereupon, the Compassionate Venerable One, moved by pity for all beings, spoke this verse:

If in past lives one was stingy and greedy,
clinging and miserly without cease,
amassing wealth like mountains and peaks,
yet the heart ever craves as if to swallow rivers and seas.
Never content, even in places of fasting and precepts,
in making images or copying scriptures,
in constructing monasteries and halls,
or in burning incense and lighting lamps—
wherever merit is made,
not a single hair’s worth is offered,
yet still seeking benefits through contrivance.
At death, they enter the Hell of Cold Ice,
where their bodies are frozen and shattered,
every joint broken and destroyed.
In later lives, they dwell among border tribes,
or become a household dog,
guarding without rest,
fierce and despised by all.
Only after ten thousand kalpas do they receive rebirth,
yet as humans, they are incomplete:
hands withered or feet lame,
eyes blind or ears deaf,
noses crooked or mouths askew,
chests protruding or spines bent.
Their forms are hideous and misshapen,
nowhere met with pity.

Today, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, having heard these words of scripture, are filled with dread. If such sins exist, they will bear retribution in future lives. Now, with earnest devotion, they wish to cleanse past transgressions. May all beings—whether in hell, as hungry ghosts, or as animals—suffering from such karmic retribution, through the power of this repentance ritual, the power of the Great Dao, and the power of merit, all attain liberation.

The repentant one, [Name], from limitless kalpas past to the present kalpa, in this life and this day, along with teachers, parents, their own person, and all kin—whether in this life or past lives, the living and the deceased—has committed boundless and immeasurable sins of stinginess and greed, never having purified them, nor even been aware of them. Today, prostrating for peace and in memorial, they recite this repentance text, bowing with the five limbs to the ground, listening with single-minded sincerity.

They bow their heads to the Compassionate Venerable One, reverently paying homage to the true sages.
With devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Jade Clarity Bestowing Blessings Heavenly Worthy.

Today, the repentant one of this ritual and the great assembly, gazing toward the southwest, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Persons, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected Persons, the Youth Saving from Suffering, the Youth of Supreme Wisdom, the Youth Attending to Medicine—manifesting throughout the ten directions, filling the boundless and mysterious realms, appearing as all true sages. May they generate compassionate vows and the power of universal salvation. May the repentant one, [Name], in their three lives—past, present, and future—along with their nine generations of kin, their own person, spouse, and children, all sins of stinginess and greed, through this repentance ritual, have their names stricken from the register of offenses. May all beings who have not yet attained liberation, and those already delivered, together through this repentance, be freed and realize the supreme Dao.

**First Prostration**
Recitation of the Chapter on Almsgiving, the Fourth

Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each turning their mind, reverently faces the Merciful Honored One, repenting the sins of withholding almsgiving.

The repentant one, [Name], awakening to understanding, bows deeply and kneels in earnest, receiving the scripture’s words: All beings, while embodied in this world, indulge in insatiable desire, ever greedy throughout the day—when do they ever relinquish? Forsake?

Their kin fill the chambers, gold and jade overflow the halls, yet their hearts remain unsatisfied, still harboring stinginess and attachment. They do not cherish beneficence, but fix their thoughts on miserliness and avarice.

Yet almsgiving yields boundless merit, benefiting all in ways beyond conception. There are three kinds of almsgiving: the almsgiving of the Dao, the almsgiving of the body, and the almsgiving of wealth.

The almsgiving of the Dao entails constantly sharing one’s teachings—the scriptures and doctrines of the Three Caverns—with skillful means. Whether provisional or ultimate, expansive or concise, they guide beings to enter the One Vehicle, forever severing the bonds of attachment and ascending to the realm of eternal bliss. From kalpa to kalpa, the Wheel of the Dao turns unceasingly. Past and future alike remain unwavering, without regret. This is the foremost, beyond all conception.

The almsgiving of the body means offering one’s own life to rescue and relieve all beings from illness, water and fire, blades and weapons, and countless calamities—all receive shelter and protection. Through expedient means, one spares neither body nor life. Seeing all the starving as if suffering one’s own hunger, seeing all the freezing as if enduring one’s own cold. Even to the point of offering one’s own labor to replace another’s peril, without reservation. Or serving the Dharma-bodies of those who have left the household, attending to their needs—gathering herbs in the mountains, running errands at their side, constructing and repairing temples, sweeping halls, planting orchards, performing all meritorious deeds. Digging wells by the roadside, repairing bridges and paths, never shirking toil, only striving with wholehearted devotion. The merit is towering, beyond all reckoning.

The almsgiving of wealth has two forms. The first is inner wealth: one’s body, limbs, the hundred bones and nine orifices, skin and nails—exerting all effort to save and deliver, sparing nothing, offering it to others. The second is outer wealth: money, land, cities, and estates; wives, children, servants, and slaves; oxen and horses; gold, silver, pearls, and jade; silks and brocades; toys and adornments—all scattered and given freely, unattached in the heart.

There are also nine kinds of almsgiving, each distinct, yet all yielding benefit according to the intention behind them:
1. Almsgiving to the true, responsive, and transformed images of those who have entered the Dao;
2. Almsgiving to the Mahāyāna scriptures and teachings;
3. Almsgiving to the sacred forms of immortals and perfected beings;
4. Almsgiving to the numinous temples, monasteries, halls, pavilions, chambers, and cloisters of the Mysterious Altar;
5. Almsgiving to the Dharma-bodies of male and female renunciates—black caps and yellow robes, all monastic garments and implements—ensuring their offerings are never lacking;
6. Almsgiving to the permanent endowments: incense, oil, lamps, candles, estates, and servants;
7. Almsgiving to bells, chimes, banners, flowers, canopies, seats, and all ritual implements;
8. Almsgiving of vegetarian meals—rice, flour, oil, and incense—to the Dharma-bodies of renunciates and those who uphold the precepts, observe fasts, and diligently cultivate the Dao;
9. Almsgiving to the poor, orphaned, widowed, sick, imprisoned, and all in peril or suffering.

The Merciful Honored One declares: The merit of these various forms of almsgiving is beyond conception. Moreover, why were the people of antiquity free from disasters? The Merciful Honored One says: The people of antiquity were simple and sincere at heart, embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue. They were neither greedy nor desirous. Later ages grew shallow and frivolous; people became deceitful, seeking only wealth, unaware of karmic conditions. They valued possessions over life, leading to the ruin of families and nations. Within, they harbored myriad evils; without, they forged alliances with the violent and reckless. Enmity and hatred followed one after another, with no means of awakening. Thus, the Dharma-gate of almsgiving was established to encourage generosity.

Yet today’s fourfold assembly clings to wealth and does not value life. To relinquish their wealth is as if relinquishing their very lives—hence the saying, “life and wealth.” If one can practice almsgiving, then:
- No inner thieves arise,
- No outer thieves appear,
- Inner and outer are at peace,
- All suffering is dispelled.

Through almsgiving today, stinginess and avarice are shattered. The transformative power of the sages reaches unseen realms, and blessings are received according to one’s merit.

If beings do not practice the almsgiving of the Dao, the almsgiving of the body, the almsgiving of inner wealth, the almsgiving of outer wealth, or the nine kinds of almsgiving—
- Seeing vegetarian feasts prepared, they refuse to give;
- Seeing those who uphold the precepts and cultivate practice, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the true scriptures expounded, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the sacred images of the Heavenly Worthies, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the Dharma-bodies of renunciates suffering cold, they refuse to give;
- Seeing lamps lit in offering, they refuse to add to the almsgiving;
- Seeing incense burned and lamps extinguished in places of offering, they refuse to replenish the almsgiving;
- Seeing banners and images in the Dao altar insufficient, they refuse to give;
- Seeing ancient sacred sites damaged, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the halls and temples of numinous monasteries in disrepair, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the cases and covers of the Great Treasury of Scriptures incomplete, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the implements of offering not conforming to the Dharma, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the recitation of hymns and praises in the ritual processions, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the permanent endowments insufficient, they refuse to give;
- Seeing the sounds of bells and chimes not harmonious, they refuse to give;
- Seeing construction unfinished, they refuse to give;
- Seeing prisoners, the poor, the elderly, the sick, the meritorious, or the fields of blessing, they refuse to give.

Or they do not give with expedient means, with compassion, with persuasion, with teaching, with reduction, with a good heart, with clear instruction, with skillful methods or partial teachings, with impartiality, with loyalty and filial piety, with good intentions, with influence, with medicine or healing arts, or with generosity.

For all the above, those who refuse to give—even in this life, their families will never know peace.

Couples, man and wife, part midway in life.
Their own bodies maimed, afflicted by foul disease,
they perish and descend into the Nine Dark Realms,
passing through all the hells,
for ten thousand kalpas to receive the bodies of serpents and dogs.

Thereupon the Merciful Honored One, pitying their unawakened state, spoke in verse:

If one is wealthy and noble,
virtuous, good, and wise,
possessing healing arts and influence,
yet refuses to give in any way—
saying, “I am rich in this world,
and shall enjoy eternal bliss,”
not believing in rebirth,
then poverty is but the guest of wealth.

In this life, they die suddenly,
their families separated in their prime.
Dead, they enter the dark and bitter prison,
their hearts pierced by iron (chains).
Reborn in the bodies of serpents and dogs,
fierce and savage, ever guarding their dens.
Even if they regain human form,
they remain dull and ignorant, devoid of understanding.
Destined to lonely poverty and lowly station,
they serve others for generation upon generation.

Today, the great assembly in this Dao altar,
hearing what the sutra has declared,
is seized with terror.
If any among us bear such sins,
how could we know it?
In the world to come, we must receive the retribution.
Today, through this ritual recitation,
we must apply ourselves with diligence,
wishing together to repent,
that all may be dissolved and extinguished.
May the six paths and four modes of birth
all attain liberation.

The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, prostrates for peace,
invoking blessings and making vows with this repentance text,
bowing with the five limbs to the ground,
concentrating the mind in single-pointed devotion.
He bows his head to the Merciful Honored One,
reverently saluting the true and sacred.

With sincere heart, he reverently salutes
the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.
With sincere heart, he reverently salutes
the Heavenly Worthy who saves from suffering at the sound of cries.
With sincere heart, he reverently salutes

With sincere heart, he reverently salutes

With sincere heart, he reverently salutes
the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.
With sincere heart, he reverently salutes
the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.
With sincere heart, he reverently salutes
the Heavenly Worthy who grants rebirth according to wishes.

The repentance sponsor and the great assembly
now turn their hopes to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the southwest,
to all the honored ones and sacred beings,
to all the great perfected ones,
to all the great divine youths,
who pervade the ten directions,
fill the boundless cosmos,
and manifest before all honored and sacred ones.
May they bestow the power of the Dao,
together with the power of expedient means,
so that the repentance sponsor, so-and-so,
his parents, teachers, fellow students,
and all his six relations,
for the three periods of time past,
may have their sins of refusing to give—
whether already repaid or yet to be repaid—
all dissolved and liberated through this repentance ritual.
May his family,
life after life,
be born into wealth and nobility,
endowed with wisdom and intelligence,
and bestow kindness upon all.
May all suffering beings
attain peace together,
quickly awaken to non-action,
and swiftly ascend to the sacred fruit.

One bow.

The fifth scroll of *The Supreme Compassionate Dao Altar Repentance for Disaster-Dissolution and the Nine Dark Realms*

Compiled by Ge Xuan, the Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate
First Chapter: *Against Frivolous and Deceitful Speech*

Today, in this Dao altar, the great assembly,
each directing their minds,
looks up to the Merciful Honored One,
repenting the sins of frivolous and deceitful speech.

The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, collects his mind, kneels, and listens attentively to the sutra’s words:
All sentient beings,
driven by the four delusions,
rely solely on the six senses.
They take a single good deed
and call it boundless;
they commit myriad sins
yet claim no fault.
Seeing others’ faults,
they amplify and slander;
seeing others’ accumulated virtue,
they criticize and destroy it.
They speak only of themselves,
claiming their virtue and conduct are complete,
hiding their cunning with eloquent tongues,
adorning their words with splendid rhetoric.
Parted for a moment,
they say it was half a year;
seeing each other for a day,
they act as if it were a hundred years.
Such foolish obstinacy
is all frivolous and deceitful speech.

Or before the Heavenly Worthy and the great Dao,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before the Three Caverns’ scriptures,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before dharma masters and great virtuous ones,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before the lord-emperor and king,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before parents and honored kin,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before the worthy and the elders,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before the foolish, lowly, and base,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before the deaf, blind, and six afflicted,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before the revered and wealthy,
they speak frivolously and deceitfully.
Or before teachers, dharma friends, and those of the dharma body,
they engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.
Or before senior companions,
they engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.
Or relying on wealth and nobility,
they engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.
Or relying on intelligence,
they engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.
Or relying on authority and wisdom,
they engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.
Or before those they know,
they engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.
Or before the sacred hosts of the heavens,
the perfected ones of the ten directions,
the stars, the sun, the moon,
and all numinous powers,
they engage in frivolous and deceitful speech.

Whenever one sets the mind to engage in frivolous and deceitful speech, in flowery words devoid of truth, one incurs grave transgressions. In this present life, one’s own body suffers twisted mouth and crooked face; at death, one falls into the Avīci Hell of Torn-Out Tongues, where only after ten thousand kalpas does one take rebirth in the body of a wild beast. Without repentance, one can hardly transcend to the Pure Land.

Thereupon, the Compassionate Venerable, for the sake of those yet unawakened, spoke this gāthā:

If in this present body one speaks frivolously and deceitfully,
dissembling before the Three Jewels,
before father and mother, before sons and daughters,
before the sovereign and the common folk—
wherever people gather,
one slanders and harms the loyal and the worthy,
sows discord among friends,
and envies those more virtuous than oneself.
One spreads rumors and stirs up strife,
indiscriminately speaks of right and wrong,
turns falsehood into truth,
and calls white black.
One gossips about others’ strengths and weaknesses,
presumes to know their likes and dislikes.
Wherever one goes, one creates discord and chaos;
at death, one falls into the Hell of Torn-Out Tongues.
Iron awls pierce the tongue,
mountains of rock press upon the body.
The tongue is stretched to a hundred feet,
nailed fast with iron spikes.
Drip by drip, blood flows forth;
in the next life, one takes the form of a wild dog,
devouring all manner of filth,
day and night lost in deluded thoughts.

Today, the great assembly of this ritual arena, having heard this gāthā, reflects: since beginningless kalpas, all sentient beings have transmigrated and suffered retribution—by what means may one awaken and know this? Now, I repent and vow to cultivate diligence. May the merit of this day bring us all to liberation together.

The repentant one, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in homage. With five limbs touching the earth and single-minded reverence, we listen attentively.

We bow our heads to the Compassionate Venerable, paying homage to the Perfected and Sacred Ones.

Today, the repentant one of this ritual arena, together with the great assembly, reverently beseeches the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Direction, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Ones, and all the Great Divine Youths—those who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and manifest throughout all realms—to together open the gate of great forgiveness and save these sentient beings.

May the repentant one, so-and-so, their nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of descendants, their own person, and all their karmic relations—both the living and the deceased—who, through measureless kalpas of abandoning and assuming bodies, have committed the above transgressions of frivolous and deceitful speech, and who, without the power of the Dao, have not attained liberation, through this act of repentance, have their sins extinguished. From this day forward, may they never again commit such offenses, abandoning false and flowery speech to practice only simplicity and truth.

May all sentient beings universally embody the Great Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Two: Repentance for Malicious Speech and Double-Tongued Words**

Today, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled devotees turn their minds in reverence toward the Merciful Honored One, repenting the karmic offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words. The repentant one, so-and-so, kneels in humility, collects their thoughts, and listens attentively to the scriptural teachings.

All sentient beings bear heavy burdens from the karma of speech, and none is graver than the sin of double-tongued words, where cunning eloquence takes precedence. They belittle the humble to flaunt their wit, mock their superiors, and scorn their inferiors; they treat the noble and the kin with arrogance, unmoved by their plight, deeming their own judgments flawless. They indulge in rich flavors, heedless of excess; they crave foul and rank foods, consuming without restraint. Some deceive the worthy and delude the sagely, slander the true and revile the Dao, spread rumors of others’ faults, and boast of their own righteousness. They curse the wind and rain, repeat hearsay as truth, turn existence into nothingness, and refine the coarse into the delicate. They sow discord among the good, praise the foolish, slander one to another, and another to the first—condemning others’ words while justifying their own. They estrange others’ kin, befriend the foolish, turn intimacy into estrangement, and transform affection into enmity. Their words are ornate yet false, their fabrications passed off as truth; their speech strays from meaning, they slander rulers and fathers, disparage teachers and friends, undermine the loyal and good, suppress those superior to themselves, and harm the innocent. Their vanity and deceit know no bounds; their mouths proclaim virtue while their hearts conceal vice. The paths of such transgressions are manifold, and the sins they weave run deep. Face-to-face, they sigh in regret, turning good into evil, constantly gathering omens and false accusations, ever drawn to perverse teachings. They invoke heaven and earth, summon ghosts and spirits—yet in all their utterances, not a single word is true or upright.

Some commit malicious speech and double-tongued words before the Heavenly Worthy, the great Dao, the scriptures, and the revered masters. Some do so before kings, parents, the virtuous, and the dharma-body. Some before the deities of heaven, the sun, the moon, the void, and the sacred assemblies. Some before all manner of boundaries—wells, stoves, doors, households, and various kin. Some before humans and non-humans alike. Such speech and tongues, scheming in all directions, deceive even the empty void. The roots of these measureless sins all stem from the tongue; even if likened to the sands of the Ganges, they could not be exhausted.

The slightest infraction—even a hair’s breadth—brings a distinct retribution: in this life, a twisted mouth, a paralyzed tongue, muteness, a blocked nose. In death, they fall into the Molten Copper Hell, where only after ten thousand kalpas do they reemerge, reborn as venomous creatures—centipedes, snakes, and vipers. If they do not repent, how can these sins be extinguished?

Thus, the Merciful Honored One, moved by their unawakened state, spoke in verse:

*In past lives, with malicious tongues,*
*They cursed kin and stranger alike.*
*Unmindful of good or evil words,*
*They spoke whatever came to mouth.*
*They called to heaven and cried to earth,*
*Summoned ghosts and dragged along spirits.*
*Even the Three Treasures, heaven and earth,*
*The sun, moon, and stars—none were spared.*
*Over wells and stoves, flowing waters,*
*At doorways and crossroads,*
*Beneath shrines, forests, and mountains,*
*They cursed the loyal and good.*
*Regardless of rank or station,*
*Parents, flesh and blood,*
*Servants, slaves, and attendants—*
*Wherever they dwelt, poisonous words followed.*
*In death, molten copper was poured,*
*Their bodies wreathed in smoke.*
*Later, reborn as wasps and centipedes,*
*Their mouths sought to harm all things.*
*Or as clams and mussels,*
*Buried in sand and mud,*
*Retreating into their shells at will.*
*Even if reborn as humans,*
*They would still be mute and stammering.*

Today, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled, as the scriptures declare, have committed the offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words—retribution knows no error, and none of us can escape. If these sins remain, what fate awaits us in days to come? Thus, we cycle endlessly through hells, hungry ghosts, and animal realms, our karmic debts unceasing.

Now, I prostrate in repentance, beseeching the Dao with sorrow, praying that the Dharma’s grace may universally dissolve these bonds. May the repentant one, so-and-so, kneeling in devotion, recite this repentance text for peace and to honor the departed, prostrating with utmost sincerity, listening with a single mind.

I bow my head to the Merciful Honored One, reverently saluting the true and sacred.

With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity, Bestower of Blessings.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Answers Cries and Saves from Suffering.

Today, the repentant one in this Daoist sanctuary, together with all assembled, reverently pray to the Supreme Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Realm, the myriad honored ones, the sacred, the great perfected, and the great youths—all the true and sacred beings manifest throughout the ten directions. With sincere devotion, may they broadly open the path of deliverance.

May the repentant one, so-and-so, their nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of descendants, both the living and the deceased, and all their kin—who have committed the above offenses of malicious speech and double-tongued words—through this act of repentance, have their sins extinguished.

From this day forward, I vow never again to commit such acts.
In life after life, may I be endowed with voice and eloquence,
to speak with wisdom and discernment,
to harmonize and benefit all,
to adapt to the shallow and the profound,
and universally deliver the six paths and four kinds of birth,
all sharing in the great Dao of unity.

*One bow*

**Third Section: Breaking Lustful Desires**

Today, in this Daoist sanctuary, each member of the assembly directs their mind,
bowing their heads to the Merciful Honored One,
repenting the sins of lustful desire.

The repentant one, so-and-so, kneels in reverence and takes refuge,
attentively listening to the scriptural words:
All sentient beings, if they give rise to lustful desire,
are confined in dark prisons,
drowned in the river of craving,
with no hope of escape,
forever sunk in suffering.

From the distant past until now,
through the cycles of birth and death over kalpas,
the bones accumulated by their bodies would form great mountains,
the mother’s milk they have drunk would equal the waters of the four great seas,
and the blood they have shed would surpass even this.
Parents, siblings, and the six relations—all have exhausted their allotted years.
The tears they have shed would be like the waters of the four great seas.
Thus it is said: with craving, there is birth; with the end of craving, there is extinction.
It is known that birth and death arise from lustful desire.
The sin of lustful desire causes sentient beings to fall into hell,
to receive the bodies of hungry ghosts.
If reborn as animals, they take the forms of doves, sparrows, owls, and other birds.
Such beings may entertain lustful thoughts
before the scriptures, Dharma masters, or in sacred halls and numinous observatories of the Heavenly Worthy,
or in pure places, divine temples, or near sacred sites.
They may violate the chaste,
seize and harm others,
separate mother and child,
take away another’s sons and daughters,
disrupt bonds of affection,
sever ties of love,
showing no regard for the virtuous.
They may expose themselves beneath the Three Luminaries,
or in thought and mind defile the Dharma bodies of male and female renunciates.
Or they may engage in impure acts with the five kinds of persons.
All such beings who direct unwholesome thoughts toward the Dharma bodies of renunciates
are like those who burn and destroy sacred images and palaces—
upon death, they fall into the Nine Dark Hells of Fengdu,
never to be reborn for kalpas.
Their descendants for nine generations suffer short lives and bitter poverty.
For each and every such act of lustful desire,
their households in this life encounter unjust calamities,
official troubles and heavy misfortunes,
their own bodies afflicted by wind and evil,
year after year stricken with illness.
Upon death, they enter the Nine Dark Hells,
only to be reborn after ten thousand kalpas,
receiving the retribution of filthy, worm-ridden bodies.
If they do not repent, they will forever remain sunk in suffering.

For those yet unawakened, the Merciful Honored One spoke this verse:

In past lives, they engaged in illicit lust,
recklessly and without restraint.
They violated the wives and concubines of others,
separating them from their kin.
The six relations were all involved,
as were the bodies of renunciates.
Even among the six kinds of animals,
they made no distinction between good and evil.
In pure places,
within sacred halls and numinous observatories,
before scriptures or near images,
they exposed themselves beneath heaven and earth,
under the sun, moon, and stars,
showing no regard for ghosts and spirits.
By famous mountains and great marshes,
in shrines and divine temples,
everywhere they indulged in lustful desire—
upon death, they fall into the Nine Dark Hells.
Men embrace great bronze pillars,
women lie upon beds of scorching iron.
Their bodies engulfed in smoke and fire,
their flesh and fat all charred and rotted.
Further tormented by boiling cauldrons,
beaten day and night with iron rods.
Later cast into the Hell of Icy Cold,
their bodies torn apart,
pounded in mortars, ground in mills,
sawed asunder, hacked by blades.
Even if they regain human form,
they are afflicted with madness and evil diseases.

Today, the assembly in this Daoist sanctuary,
as described in the scriptures, is deeply terrified.
If such sins exist, how can one become aware of them?
Among the four kinds of birth and six paths,
seeing those who suffer and those yet to receive punishment—
through this act of repentance, may all attain liberation.

The repentant one, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text,
bowing with the five limbs touching the ground.
Kneeling to the Merciful Honored One, they reverently pay homage to the true and sacred beings.

With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity Who Bestows Blessings.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transformative Self-Mastery.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Embodies Heaven and Earth.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Five Hundred Million Forms.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Shakes Heaven and Earth.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Golden Wheel and Jade Light.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Perfects the Land.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Abides with Sentient Beings.

With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and State Protection.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Extent.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Solar Wisdom.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Wisdom and Lunar Compassion.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation.
With devoted heart, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy and Sin Eradication.

Today, the repentant one in this Daoist sanctuary, together with all assembled,
reverently pray to the Supreme Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Realm,
the myriad honored ones, the sacred, the great perfected, and the great youths—
all the true and sacred beings manifest throughout the ten directions,
filling the boundless void and hidden or revealed in all realms.

May the power of this Daoist sanctuary, the power of chanting praises, and the power of self-transformation enable the repentant one, [Name], along with their birth parents, extended kin, uncles, brothers, personal relatives, and all living and deceased across two generations—should any bear the karmic burden of lust and desire as described above—to now sincerely prostrate, repent, and cleanse their transgressions. From this day forward, may they perceive form as emptiness, sever karmic retribution, and refrain from further transgression. May they cherish the body as a treasure, guard conduct as a pearl, encounter no obstacles, and enter the shore of non-action, ascending together to the fruition of the Dao.

**First Prostration**
**Chapter Four: Distant Aversion and Attachment**

Today, the assembled in this Daoist sanctuary, each directing their minds, face the Merciful Honored Ones and repent the sins of aversion and attachment between self and others. The repentant one, [Name], gathers their heart, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words:

All sentient beings, when first setting intention, are often foolish, their actions seldom sincere. Attachment accumulates like mountains, yet they claim it is never enough. Aversion discards as if filth, yet they resent not having cast it away entirely. Thus, their minds fail to awaken and comprehend, distinguishing self from others, judging strength and weakness. Words and deeds diverge, entangled in worldly nets, indulging in obstinate folly. They gaze without satiety, listen without discernment, yielding to greed and delusion, forsaking tranquility and harmony. What pleases the eye, they stare at without ceasing; what pleases the ear, they listen to without tiring. They speak only of others’ faults to extol their own virtues. When the mind is pleased, they overlook ugliness; when words are affectionate, they disregard closeness or distance.

Thus, sentient beings may harbor aversion or attachment before the seats of true and sacred beings, or before kings, parents, or revered teachers. They may conceive such thoughts before uncles, brothers, men, or women, or before the heavens, earth, sun, moon, or the boundless void. They may foster such desires at sacred sites or before divine altars. These immeasurable, boundless sins of aversion and attachment between self and others—should one commit even a single instance or kind—lead to rebirth in the hells of manifold suffering, with no hope of escape. Even if reborn, they shall assume non-human forms. Without repentance and liberation, they shall forever sink in suffering.

Then the Merciful Honored One expounded further in verse:

Aversion and attachment arise from self and other,
Self-generated, singular in intent.
What was deemed evil now seems good,
Aversion lengthens, attachment shortens.
Those despised are cut off in form and shadow,
Yet still the foolish heart is not sated.
Those loved stand like mountains,
Yet still they claim it is never enough.
All things share a single body,
Yet distinctions of beauty and ugliness arise.
Self and other emerge from the mind,
Good and evil all stem from nature.
Upon death, they enter the great hells,
Enduring every torment and poison.
Blades pierce the heart,
Iron awls tear the tongue.
A hundred joints are nailed with iron,
Later reborn as geese or ducks,
Or as fish and turtles,
Slaughtered, unable to speak.
At the mercy of others’ lives and deaths,
Subject to every manner of cooking and preparation.
Later, reborn as humans,
They become the mute, deaf, or dumb.

Today, the assembled in this Daoist sanctuary, as the scripture declares, are filled with sorrow. If such sins are committed, how can their retribution be endured? Moreover, the repentant one, [Name], along with their nine generations of ancestors, parents, revered teachers, uncles, brothers, themselves, and all kin—from limitless and beginningless kalpas to this very life and day, through countless rebirths—have harbored these sins of aversion and attachment between self and others, never awakening. Now, establishing this Daoist sanctuary for peace and offering this repentance, they prostrate with five limbs to the earth, wholeheartedly invoking:

With devoted heart, I bow to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.

Today, the repentant one in this Daoist sanctuary, together with all assembled, reverently pray to the Supreme Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Realm, the myriad honored ones, the sacred, the great perfected, and the great youths—all the true and sacred beings manifest throughout the ten directions, filling the boundless void and hidden or revealed in all realms. May they bestow their benevolent power, enabling the repentant one, [Name], their nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of kin, and all living and deceased relatives to beseech liberation from the aforementioned karmic offenses. From this day forward, may they never again commit such transgressions. May all who have sunk in suffering, through the power of this repentance, ascend to the shore of the Dao.

**First Bow: The Fifth Precept on Non-Stealing**

Today, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary, each with sincere heart, bows their heads to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the karmic offenses of theft. The repentant one, [Name], collects their mind, kneels in reverence, and surrenders body and soul, heeding the scriptural words: all sentient beings, lacking integrity, must not take even a blade of grass or a single leaf without just cause—how much less may they steal. Yet beings, deluded by present gain, seize what is not theirs through manifold unjust means.

Some breach walls or dig through barriers, waylay travelers, or plunder by force. Some default on debts, break contracts, or deceive with words and heart. Some take what is not theirs, reasoning none will know—yet the heavenly net is vast; where can they escape? Some steal from the Heavenly Worthy’s scriptures, dharma treasures, or ritual implements. Some take offerings meant for perfected sages, or the sacred tools of worship. Some plunder the three-tiered altars, the treasures of the numinous halls, or the vessels of fasting assemblies. Some steal from the materials used to sculpt sacred images, or the alms of the faithful who uphold precepts. Some take the seven treasures donated to the Three Treasures, or the jewels of jeweled thrones, jeweled canopies, jeweled chariots, jeweled banners, jeweled crowns, jeweled mirrors, jeweled trees, jeweled flowers, jeweled halls, jeweled steeds, or the sacred robes and cloud-patterned vestments. Some steal from the jeweled repositories of scriptures, the treasures of jeweled halls, or the jeweled caskets and relics. Some take the possessions of exalted perfected ones, or the oil and incense meant for lamps and offerings. Some plunder the common stores of the assembly, the tribute granaries of the state, or the precious treasures of immortals, jade maidens, vajra guardian kings, or celestial lions. Some steal from the dharma-bodies of male or female officials, or the fruits and vegetables of the Three Sages’ blessed lands. Some take sacrificial animals from spirit temples, or precious substances like giant clams, agate, lapis lazuli, amber, gold, silver, pearls, jade, copper, iron, silk, brocade, or fine linen. Even a single coin, a single thread—whether little or much—all incur grave transgression.

Some break into storehouses, pick locks, alter seals, or tamper with labels and caskets. Some hoard military supplies, evade taxes, or withhold even a fraction of what is due, seeking only personal gain. Some steal the vestments or ritual implements entrusted to dharma masters, or the fresh offerings not yet presented to the spirits. Some take from loving parents, siblings, friends, or neighbors; from travelers’ luggage; from the destitute, the aged, or the infirm. Some seize goods meant for trade, the seeds and livestock of farmers, or take by deceit, coercion, or force. Some claim public authority, or take through neglect, fraud, or jest. Some take by force, subterfuge, or false pretenses; by greed, unreturned loans, or barter; by refusal to repay, by deception, or by hiding the truth. Some beg with false humility or demand with threats. All such crooked acts incur fault and blame.

If it is not one’s own, even a hair’s weight must not be coveted—all such taking is theft. Even lost items found on the road, carried by wind or birds, delivered by spirits or gods—clothing, bedding, utensils, carriages, horses, cloth, grain, or the tiniest speck—if concealed, become the karmic offense of theft. This shortens one’s lifespan, brings misfortune to nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of kin, and offers no escape. In life, one suffers illness; in death, one falls into hell. Even if reborn, one becomes an ox or beast of burden. Without repentance, one remains forever sunk in suffering.

Thus, the Merciful Honored One spoke these verses:

*In past lives, they stole and plundered,*
*Taking the Three Treasures’ wealth.*
*Alms given in faith, offerings made in devotion,*
*Or the possessions of kings and people—*
*None of it theirs, yet at the sight,*
*They harbored thieving hearts,*
*Always scheming to steal.*
*They robbed travelers by force,*
*Threatened, coerced, or framed the innocent.*
*They tunneled through walls, plundered by night,*
*Or lurked in empty places,*
*Seizing cattle, servants, slaves,*
*Wealth, jewels, and treasures—*
*All by cunning means.*
*In death, they enter the hell of fire-carts,*
*Their bodies scorched and shattered.*
*In later lives, they become oxen or horses,*
*Repaying their debts to others.*
*Yoked, their flesh and fat are torn away,*
*Nostrils and mouths ripped apart.*
*Hungry and thirsty, they suffer endlessly,*
*Unable to speak.*
*At others’ mercy, they are slaughtered,*
*Only to be reborn as humans—*
*Then robbed and killed in turn,*
*Repaying the sins of past lives.*

Today, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary must reflect deeply on these scriptural words, which inspire true dread. With utmost sincerity, they must bow in repentance, seek mercy, and pray that all beings—whether already suffering retribution or yet to face it—may, through this act of repentance, attain universal liberation.

The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, throwing themselves to the ground with utmost devotion. Bowing their head to the Merciful Honored One, they reverently pay homage to the sacred beings:

With sincere heart, they bow to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.
With sincere heart, they bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at a Cry.

With sincere heart, they bow to the Perfected of Great Mercy Who Eradicates Transgressions.

Today, the master of repentance in this Daoist ritual, together with the great assembly, each directs their mind and aspires toward the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Direction, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, and all the Great Divine Youths—those who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and manifest throughout all realms of reality.

By the power of dissolving disasters and guarding life,
By the power of rescuing from suffering and eradicating transgressions,
By the power of boundless merit and virtue,
By the power of innumerable immortals,
By the power inconceivable—

The master of repentance, [Name], along with their teacher, fellow disciples, Daoist companions, all dharma kin, the seven generations of ancestors, the nine lineages of descendants, their birth parents, uncles, brothers, all branches and vines of kinship—from beginningless time until this very day—have committed the aforementioned sins of theft, used false weights and measures, deceived the good and kind, sought gain through improper means, spread fear and violence, engaged in stealth and coercion, invoked spirits and ghosts, deceived themselves, indulged in cruelty, disregarded joy and anger, ignored the poor and destitute, and given free rein to greed and savagery, accumulating manifold transgressions.

Relying on this repentance ritual, may these sins be eradicated.
From this day forward, in life after life, may they attain the wish-fulfilling pearl, ever possess the seven treasures, wear finest garments, taste the hundred flavors of sweet dew, and receive all manner of medicines and remedies as desired, bestowing them upon all beings without exception, never again committing theft.

May all beings be free from the thought of theft, ever content, unstained by attachment, ever delighting in wise generosity, relieving the poor and rescuing the suffering, offering head, eyes, brain, and marrow as readily as spittle.

With a mind of dedication, may they accomplish the supreme Dao.
One bow.

First Repentance: On the Killing of Living Beings

Today, in this Daoist ritual arena, all present turn their minds toward the Compassionate Honored One, repenting the karmic offenses of killing living beings.

The repentant master, [Name], gathers his mind, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words:

All sentient beings, so long as they dwell within the human realm, remain entangled in the web of the world. Having never encountered a virtuous friend and constantly associating with the foolish, they accumulate habits that become deeply ingrained. Like the mingling of fragrant and foul, they are stained by manifold transgressions. They give free rein to reckless cruelty, perpetrating suffering without cause, never awakening a heart of compassion. They kill living beings, devouring flesh and bone.

At times, for the sake of parents, themselves, brothers, wives, children, or extended kin, they gather in villages and hamlets, slaughtering countless beings without a thought for their lives.

They kill cattle, sheep, mules, horses, pigs, dogs, and other domesticated creatures, those raised and fed by humans. They boil and butcher deer, foxes, rabbits, tigers, leopards, and wolves—those dwelling in mountains and forests—slaughtering the six kinds of livestock without a moment’s hesitation, heedless of whether they are fat or lean.

Some pierce with blades until blood flows; others scald until skin peels away. Though life has yet to depart, their bellies are slit open, bones removed, sinews stripped, intestines torn out, and flesh carved away. The agony they endure is beyond measure, and the karmic retribution they incur is impossible to repay.

They kill sacred birds—phoenixes, cranes, geese, ducks, turtledoves, pigeons, crows, magpies, owls, and kites—along with all manner of flying creatures. They stretch tall nets, raise long poles with sticky paste, pluck feathers and singe wings, or maim them in treetops. Desperate for death yet unable to die, longing for life yet denied it, they sever their feet, remove their heads, cut off their wings, gouge out their eyes, all to fill the kitchen and sate their hunger.

They kill soft-shelled turtles, alligators, tortoises, snails, clams, crabs, and other armored creatures. They drain rivers and dig trenches, set bamboo traps and scatter sand, cast nets and weirs, or use baskets to ensnare scales and fins. They boil and butcher them on islands, piling bones into mountains, their stench carried on the wind. Though they have taken countless lives, their desire remains unquenched.

They kill snakes, vipers, scorpions, bees, wasps, dung beetles, midges, centipedes, locusts, ants, and all manner of crawling things. They kill mosquitoes, horseflies, lice, fleas, mayflies, moths, and other creatures born of transformation—every wriggling, flying, or submerged being.

Though these may be venomous creatures, they too seek peace. They thrive in heat and dampness, perish in cold and ice, all partaking in the transformations of creation, never entering the kitchen. To kill them without cause—how can such suffering be endured?

They fly hawks and hunt with dogs, draw bows and nock arrows, their hearts stirred by greed and savagery, knowing only the taking of life. They set mountains ablaze, drain forests and rivers dry. They wield arrows and blades, grasp spears and halberds, killing living beings. They crush with hands, trample with feet, press down while sitting or lying, killing living beings. They till fields and plant crops, build walls and erect barriers, killing living beings. They construct houses, dig pits, and excavate earth, killing living beings. They dismantle fences, clear grass, and level ground, killing living beings. They gather firewood, fell trees, pluck flowers, and pull up grass, killing living beings. They light lamps and raise candles, killing living beings. They divert water into burrows or pour boiling water on the ground, killing living beings. They wash their hair, bathe their bodies, drink water, and eat meals, killing living beings. They thresh grain and husk wheat, split open wombs and crush eggs, killing living beings. They swat ropes, fan away mosquitoes, open their mouths, close their eyes, raise their hands, or stamp their feet, killing living beings. They kill before sacred images, scriptures, or in the presence of the Dharma; they carry creatures home from the ritual arena to slaughter. In anger or frustration, without cause, they kill living beings. In joy or revelry, indulging their desires, they kill living beings. They slaughter for sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, or for the sick, seeking to avert unseen misfortune. They prepare medicinal decoctions using living creatures, killing them. Some die in their hands, others perish on the butcher’s block, roasted in raging fires, their lineages severed, their reproduction halted, their life roots destroyed, utterly annihilated.

They kill creditors, enemies, or good people from the four directions. They abort fetuses and crush eggs, not sparing even birds and beasts. They kill out of fear, out of dread, by their own hand, or by instructing others. They kill through cursing, poisoning, or drugging. They kill through spells, anger, or joy. They kill deliberately, accidentally, with words, hands, intent, thoughts, glances, or in combat.

In all such acts of killing, with every movement of hand or body, they cruelly harm all manner of creatures. Each bears its own sin, and none can escape retribution.

Thus speaks the Compassionate Honored One:
He who amasses boundless wealth will surely bring suffering upon himself;
He who accumulates excess sin will repay his past debts.
Without remorse, without a heart to save, he remains mired in delusion.
Calamity flows to his ancestors, and upon death, he enters the hells of interrogation and punishment, enduring every torment.
Even if he is reborn, his form will be that of a different species.
Without repentance, how can he transcend this fate?

Then the Compassionate Honored One proclaimed again in lamentation:
In past lives, you killed living beings—
Cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, dogs,
Geese, ducks, pheasants, rabbits,
Deer, tigers, leopards, and their kin,
Owls, crows, swallows, sparrows,
Jackals, wolves, foxes, raccoon dogs,
Mules, donkeys, horses,
Fish, turtles, cicadas, maggots,
Snails, clams, shrimp, mussels,
Dung beetles, ants, and their like,
Leeches, mosquitoes, fleas, lice,
Centipedes, midges, and all manner of worms.
You slaughtered them all, never awakening a heart of kindness.
Whoever you encountered, you harmed without mercy,
And upon death, you fell into the hells,
Enduring every suffering, tormented day and night.
In that place of unbearable agony,
All those cattle and sheep
Will come to demand their lives,
Saying, “You ate my flesh.”
Or, “You killed my body,”
Claiming you had no right.
Today, we meet again—
You must repay your past debts.

Even as you seek escape, there is no path—
The demon-king unfolds the scroll of transgressions.
Upon examination, the truth is known:
Life for life, each must be repaid.

If reborn in another form,
You enter the assembly of beasts,
Again becoming oxen, sheep, or dogs,
Even geese, ducks, and their kind.
Subjected once more to slaughter,
You repay the sins of your past life.

Today, in this grand repentance hall, all present—
As the sutras declare—
Every sentient being,
For killing without cause,
Or causing others to kill,
Has committed acts swift and innumerable.
To repay life and settle karmic debts,
Who can take another’s place?
In life, one suffers punishment,
Relying on the strength of kinship;
But upon death, entering the Three Wicked Paths,
Who will come to your rescue?

Such karmic retribution is clear and exact.
Now, we beseech repentance to □,
To wash away past transgressions.
The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in memorial.
Five limbs touching the earth, with wholehearted devotion,
We bow our heads to the Merciful Honored One,
Reverently paying homage to the true and sacred.

With sincere hearts, we pay homage to:
The Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity Who Bestows Blessings,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at a Cry,
The Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Brilliance,
The Heavenly Worthy of Golden Radiance and Light,

Today, in this repentance hall, the repentant one and all present
Raise their aspirations toward the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the northwest,
All the venerable ones, all the sages,
All the immortals, all the assemblies,
All the great perfected ones,
All the great divine youths,
Who pervade the ten directions,
Fill the boundless cosmos,
And manifest as all true and sacred beings—
Together, may they pour the Dharma-water
To cleanse all sentient beings.

The repentant one, [Name], since time without beginning,
Along with nine generations of ancestors,
Teachers, parents,
All Dharma-kin,
Uncles, brothers,
Six relations and family,
Both the living and the dead—
Have accumulated boundless, measureless sins of killing,
Now in the hells, hungry ghost, and animal realms,
Receiving retribution and repaying debts,
Unsettled until now, but settled today.

By virtue of this repentance and deliverance,
May we forever break free from the snares of attachment.
From this day forward,
We vow never to create or commit such acts again.
May we regard the bodies of sentient beings as our own,
And see the killing of sentient beings as the killing of ourselves.
With manifold compassion,
Cherish them as we cherish ourselves.
May all beasts attain human birth,
Awaken to the profound principle,
And realize the supreme Dao.

**First Prostration**

**Second Section: Washing Away the Crimes of Destruction**

Today, in this grand repentance hall, each person directs their mind,
Bowing their heads to the Merciful Honored One,
Repenting for boundless, measureless crimes of destruction.

The repentant one, [Name], collects their thoughts and kneels in reverence,
Attentively listening to the sutra’s words:
All sentient beings, by virtue of having form,
From time without beginning until today,
Parents, brothers,
One’s own body and family,
Shedding and assuming forms through countless rebirths—
Have failed to emulate loyalty and goodness,
Instead harboring much harm and ruin,
Indulging in arrogance and dissipation,
Failing to restrain themselves,
Seizing and plundering servants and slaves,
Destroying without cause,
Harming sentient beings,
Committing countless defilements.

Moreover, when serving as officials,
Failing to emulate integrity and diligence,
Often engaging in destruction,
Disloyal to the state,
Constantly resorting to flattery and deceit,
Unattuned to the times,
Disdaining the great Dao,
Concealing good and practicing evil,
Not judging by principle,
Envying the worthy and resenting the capable,
Deceiving superiors and bullying subordinates,
Relying on official power and influence,
Refusing to act with fairness,
Allowing personal likes and dislikes to sway their hearts,
Indulging in favoritism and rejection.

Or perhaps they have:
Besieged cities and razed towns,
Burned others’ homes,
Sold good people into bondage,
Enticed others’ servants and slaves,
Wrongfully oppressed the innocent,
Bullied the virtuous.

Or they have:
Destroyed images of the sacred and venerable.

Or perhaps they have:
Destroyed Daoist temples and sacred altars,
Or ruined public monasteries and permanent endowments,
Or damaged the great canon of scriptures,
Or broken the vessels and implements for offerings.
In all things, they fail to cultivate reverence,
Seeking only to destroy.
As echo answers sound,
So too do words of ill omen bring forth their due.
When qi is coarse, the voice is harsh;
When the heart is pleased, you are at ease.
For all beings, reverence and faith come first,
And solemn adornment resides in mindfulness.
To commit such acts of destruction is to accumulate all manner of karmic transgressions,
Causing one’s kin across the three lifetimes to suffer retribution,
Ever bound to evil affinities,
And at death, to enter the bitter hells of suffering,
Where they shall endure the punishment of shaved heads and severed hair.
If they do not repent,
They shall forever bear the weight of sinking and drowning.

Thereupon, the Compassionate Venerable One, moved by pity for those yet unawakened, spoke again in verse:

In former lives, they scorned and slighted,
Damaging all manner of things,
And the forms and images of the sacred,
The temples, the profound altars,
The permanent endowments, the Daoist sanctums.
Relying on power, they bullied the good and kind,
Their hearts cruel and oppressive.
At death, they enter the hells of bitter suffering,
Where kin ever contend in strife,
Tormenting one another in turn.
In later lives, though born as humans,
They suffer the retribution of shaved heads and severed hair.
Their kin endure sorrowful wailing,
Like tumbleweeds, when shall their wandering cease?

Today, the great assembly in this Daoist sanctuary,
Having heard the inconceivable words of the Compassionate Venerable One,
Where karmic consequences are made manifest,
And transmigration endlessly continues,
Now arouse the mind of resolve,
And seek mercy through rites of repentance.
May those in the hells, the hungry ghosts, and the realm of beasts,
By the power of this repentance,
The power of merit and virtue,
And the inconceivable power,
All attain liberation.

The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace,
And offers this repentance text in supplication.
With five limbs touching the earth,
And a single mind, they listen attentively.
Bowing in reverence to the Compassionate Venerable One,
They pay homage to the true and sacred.

With sincere devotion, they pay homage to:
The Heavenly Worthy Who Descends with Blessings from the Jade Clarity,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering at a Cry’s Sound,
The Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Florescence,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Manifests in Accord with the World,
The Heavenly Worthy of Infinite Wondrous Forms,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Transforms Across Myriad Kalpas,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Mountain of Merit and Virtue,
The Heavenly Worthy of Pure Flowing Light,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Preaches the Dharma Without Obstruction,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Opens Conditions and Delivers Beings,
The Heavenly Worthy, King of Pure Wisdom and Virtue,
The Heavenly Worthy of Inexhaustible Form,
The Heavenly Worthy of Emptiness and Formlessness,
The Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Lifespan,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Constantly Preaches the Dharma,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Wealth Abundantly,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Bestows the Dharma,
The Heavenly Worthy Without Equal,
The Heavenly Worthy of Infinite Illumination,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Perfects All,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Great One Who Saves from Suffering,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Ensures Longevity,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Protects the Realm,
The Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes,
The Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Reaches,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue,
The Perfected of the Great Solar Canopy of Compassion,
The Perfected of the Lunar Purity of Great Mercy,
The Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering,
The Perfected of Great Mercy Who Removes Transgressions.

Today, the patrons of this Daoist sanctuary,
Together with the great assembly,
Take refuge and aspire toward the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the northwest,
All the Venerables and Sages,
All the great heavenly immortals,
The earthly immortals,
All the great Perfected,
All the great Perfected Who Save from Suffering,
All the great youths,
The Youths of the Primal Boundary,
Who pervade the ten directions,
And fill the boundless realms,
All the true and sacred ones of the past and future.
May they, by the power of the Dao,
The power of merit and virtue,
The power of supreme goodness,
The power of the heavenly immortals,
And the power of spiritual penetrations,
Cause the repentant one, [Name],
For the immeasurable kalpas of transgressions from destroying and plundering,
Through this repentance rite,
To wash away faults and offenses,
And forever dispel obstacles and afflictions.
May they not suffer retribution,
But ascend to realize the fruits of the Dao,
And reach the shore of non-action.

One bow.

**Chapter Three: On Not Violating the Fast**

Today, in this Daoist sanctuary, all assembled turn their minds as one, bowing their heads to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the transgressions of breaking the fast.

The repentant one, [Name], gathers the heart, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words: All sentient beings, from the moment they receive form until this very day, have been bound by stinginess, greed, and craving—drinking wine, eating meat, chewing without restraint, nourishing flesh and blood, fostering pus and decay. Day by day, afflictions and illnesses arise, and the roots of sin grow ever deeper.

Moreover, through birth, aging, sickness, and death, through scorching heat, dampness, cold, and wind, through bitter pain and corrosive suffering, they are assailed by noxious qi, and a hundred diseases invade the body. Thought after thought, impermanence ceaselessly presses on, day and night unrelenting. The bodily form and the knowing nature differ in each, yet all revolve in endless cycles, trapped for ten thousand kalpas without escape.

These sentient beings, their minds often corrupted, treat the fasts and precepts with irreverence. As the years advance and old age approaches, as sickness and distress entwine them, in this one life, one lifetime, they toil for self-preservation, all because of their voracious consumption of impure foods. Their organs steam and ferment, offending the true and sacred ones. The winds of karma fan their bodies, causing gold and jade to dissolve, their forms to wither prematurely.

Yet I, who neither drink nor eat, embrace the Dao in its naturalness, transforming without limit, living forever without death. I constantly expound the scriptures and teachings, seeking to deliver all beings. If, in their ignorance and delusion, they cannot believe or follow, I am ever concerned, never at rest. Thus, I offer the fast as a means to dispel their sickness and suffering.

Moreover, the hosts of the Three Clarities, who long ago realized the truth of the Dao, always observe the fasts with diligence, never growing lax. How much more so the six fasts of the lunar months, the ten days of upright conduct, the eight seasonal nodes, the three primal festivals, the jiazi and benming days, the three assemblies of the gengshen, and all other fasts and gatherings—subtle and wondrous beyond thought—all established by the Merciful Honored One to guide and receive sentient beings, enabling them to cultivate practice and escape the perils of demonic obstacles.

Yet you, all you sentient beings, though you know the names of these fasts, do not arouse reverent hearts. And even when you do, you often violate them. Some mix impure foods, blending the foul with the sacred, sharing the same kitchen without purifying themselves, treating all with careless disdain. Others eat after midday, their minds still stained, slandering the utmost truth, equating it with falsehood. Their words are deceitful, their hearts swayed by love and hatred. Such foolishness leads to countless violations of the fast.

Some break the Fast of the Great Perfected, some the Fast of the Golden Register, some the Fast of Divine Incantations, some the Fast of the Yellow Register, some the Fast of Illuminating the True, some the Fast of Spontaneous Perfection, some the Three Primal Fasts, some the Fast of Mud and Ash, some the Fast of the Cavern Spirits—fasts such as these, whether established for the state, for the deliverance of ancestors, for the rescue of the drowning, for the sake of departed kin, or for the benefit of others. At first, they arise with faith and devotion, but later, regret takes hold. Their sins deepen, and they suffer boundless torment.

If, for the sake of the Dharma-body of ordained men and women, whether ten, a hundred, or even more, the fast is distributed according to its scale, ensuring no partiality, then all who speak of fasting must do so with a giving heart—not with ostentation, nor with meager offerings. Those who are ordained should share equally in the fast. To select or discriminate is to treat it with disdain. To fail to arouse reverence is to break the fast.

Furthermore, if one takes for oneself even a single coin from the offerings of a fast, the construction of images, or any other materials, one must repay tenfold within ten years. If not repaid, the retribution is severe illness, deformity, and eternal banishment from the human realm. They will roost like birds, sleep exposed like beasts. Even if reborn as humans, they will be afflicted by the six chronic illnesses—deaf, blind, and lacking the five senses. If one uses the food of the fast to make offerings to the Dharma-body, or the banners and canopies for venerable images, yet does so without reverence, later growing remorseful, the karmic consequences are beyond description.

When life ends, they are reborn as hungry ghosts—necks thin as bowstrings, bellies swollen like drums, bodies burdened by iron wheels, flames scorching them on all sides. To cover themselves with cloth is like touching a mountain of fire. When they eat or drink, it turns to pus and blood. If they suffer this in the present life, they lie bedridden with malignant disease, their bodies festering and foul, shunned by all. For years and months, flesh wastes away, sinews dissolve. Once cast into hell, they will scarcely be reborn in heaven. In future lives, even if born among humans, they will be deaf, blind, and afflicted by the six illnesses, bereft of beauty, inferior to others. All their kin will treat them as outcasts. If they become husband and wife, they will part midway, leaving orphaned sons and widowed daughters to depend on others. Poor, cold, and hungry, their forms will be ugly, barely clinging to human form.

All such sins arise from breaking the fast. If one does not repent, they will sink ever deeper. Thus, the Merciful Honored One, for the sake of those yet unawakened, speaks these verses:

Those who break the fast in life
Are reborn as hungry ghosts.
Hungry, they eat raging fire;
Thirsty, they drink molten bronze.
Their bodies char and wither,
Treading the edge of frost and blade.
Day and night without respite,
Their suffering knows no end.
Even if a time of liberation comes,
They are no better than dogs and horses—
Hungry, cold, poor, and lowly,
How could they possess full form?

I now extend my compassion,
My wisdom boundless through kalpas.
I establish this great Dharma-bridge
To save the foolish and deaf.
I bow my head to the Supreme Dao,
Roaming freely in the Palace of the Great Ultimate.

Today, all assembled in this sanctuary, having heard these verses, having heard this scripture, having heard this repentance, all sentient beings who have committed such deeds must undergo retribution. Today, they vow and set their minds to dedicate their merit to the Three Saints, that they may avoid such sins. Whether in the six paths of rebirth or the four modes of birth, whether they have already suffered or have yet to face retribution, all now confess openly, aspiring to attain liberation.

The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and in offering to the ancestors, bowing fully to the ground, vowing with a mind of devotion. Bowing to the Merciful Honored One, paying homage to the true and sacred ones.

From this day forward, facing the sacred and the true, with purified minds and bodies, they reverently uphold the precepts, aspiring that the merit and virtue may uplift their nine generations of ancestors, rescue those sunk in suffering, and deliver themselves, all their kin, and all beings of the six paths and four modes of birth, that all may ascend the shore of the Dao.

**First Bow**
**Chapter Four: Transgressions Against Scriptures and Precepts**

Today, the assembly in this sanctuary, each with focused mind, prostrates in homage to the Merciful Honored One, repenting for transgressions against scriptures and precepts.

The repentant one, [Name], gathers their mind and kneels in earnest, listening attentively to the scriptural words. All sentient beings possess the three karmas and the six senses. From kalpa to kalpa, in this life and today, they commit theft, sexual misconduct, stinginess, greed, anger, ignorance, frivolous speech, falsehood, harsh words, divisive speech—boundless, immeasurable transgressions that entangle the body, leaving no means of liberation.

The scriptures and precepts clearly expound the Dharma gates, varying in number and differing in rank. They admonish and guide beings to diminish karmic roots. Some receive the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Six Precepts, Seven Precepts, Eight Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twelve Acceptable Precepts, Fourteen Precepts for Upholding the Body, Twenty-Four Precepts, Twenty-Seven Precepts, Thirty-Six Precepts, or even the Forty Precepts of the Lower Grade of the Cavernous Mystery, the Sixty Precepts of the Middle Grade, the Eighty-One Precepts of the Upper Grade, the One Hundred Eighty Precepts, or the Three Hundred Precepts of the Upper Clarity for Observing the Body, and the Seven Hundred Twenty Precepts of the Cavernous Spirit. Each has its sequence, guiding the deluded multitude.

Those who uphold the precepts gain boundless, immeasurable blessings; those who do not uphold them incur boundless, immeasurable karmic retribution. Moreover, the scriptures of the Three Caverns circulate among humans. If beings cannot believe and accept them, how much less the precepts? These are the city walls and dwelling houses of beings, where jade youths and jade maidens, vajra spirit-kings, and guardians come to attend and protect, praising on all sides, dispelling calamities, delivering from misfortune, preserving life, and prolonging years. The compassionate light of the true and sacred ones brings joy to all heavens. Thus, blades and weapons, floods and fires, tigers, wolves, insects, and snakes, illnesses, prisons, ghosts, thieves, hunger, cold, and afflictions are forever eradicated. One then obtains sons when seeking sons, daughters when seeking daughters, wealth, nobility, intelligence, and dignified appearance, earning respect among people—benefits beyond conception. In past lives, they are reborn in heavenly palaces and pure lands, amidst flower terraces and jeweled trees, with natural clothing and food, wondrous offerings from celestial kitchens, cloud canopies and dragon chariots, carefree and joyous, constantly hearing the scriptures, standing in attendance to the Merciful Honored One. In future rebirths, they will encounter the true Dao.

All sentient beings, if they uphold the precepts, are like a precious sword that severs all, like a Dharma boat that ferries all, like a fierce fire that burns all, like pure water that washes all. Those who uphold the precepts guard against wrongdoing, restrain evil, discipline body and mind, subdue demonic foes, and move the numinous and sacred. Yet you, all beings, whether having received them personally or witnessed others receiving them, have failed to revere and believe, constantly harboring arrogance, committing countless transgressions, accumulating slander, treating them as mere play, neglecting to uphold them, acting contrary to their words, writing carelessly, reciting irreverently, altering the text, and deviating from the scriptures.

Some may read the *Taiqing Treasury Scriptures*, the *Shangqing Treasury Scriptures*, or the *Yuqing Treasury Scriptures*—whether reciting them themselves or witnessing others recite them—yet treat them with frivolity, failing to arouse reverent mindfulness. They disdain the sacred words, extol the Great Dao without offering devotion, and neglect their protection with half-hearted care. Some transcribe them with poor paper and ink, binding them shoddily with crooked cords and slanted rollers, staining or losing the text. Others annotate and alter the meanings, their ignorance obstructing the principles, devoid of veneration. Such transgressions, with deep karmic roots, if left unrepented, will forever bar one from the cycles of rebirth.

Should they remain in the world, they will be afflicted by malignant illnesses, their bodies frail and feeble, their breath faint and weak, their speech coarse and clumsy, ignorant of rites and music, unable to discern right from wrong. When their life ends, they will fail to ascend to the Pure Land, their sins plunging them into profound darkness, where suffering ceaselessly torments them. No rebirth awaits them—only relentless trials, each debt repaid in full, enduring agony with groans, their flesh and bones severed by karmic bonds. They will bear the torment of a single body: climbing a thousand-fathom sword-tree, grasping its branches to ascend, only to sink into a cauldron of boiling water, crushed beneath its weight until utterly consumed. Only then may they find respite—all from violating the precepts, born of disbelief.

Thus the Compassionate One spoke in verse:
*Those who transgress scriptures and precepts in life*
*Shall enter the hell of blades and needles in death.*
*Pierced on all sides, their bodies endure*
*Ten thousand pains beyond endurance.*
*They traverse the blade-mountains, then plunge*
*Into cauldrons of boiling water.*
*Death they seek but cannot find—*
*Only after ten thousand kalpas may they be reborn.*

Today, the assembly of this grand ritual, as the scriptures foretell, trembles with dread. For the transgressions we have committed—violating scriptures and precepts, boundless and measureless, grave and weighty sins—we shall suffer their retribution in future lives or even in this present existence. Now, we prostrate ourselves in sincerity, making confession and repentance. May all beings across the four modes of birth and six realms of existence, sharing the same karmic cause and effect, each attain liberation.

The repentant sponsor, [Name], humbly offers this text of repentance for peace and merit-transference, prostrating with the five limbs touching the earth, wholeheartedly invoking the sacred. Bowing in reverence to the Compassionate One, we pay homage to the true and holy sages:

With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Purity who bestows blessings.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues upon hearing cries of suffering.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Brilliance.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Sun and Moon Radiance.

With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Virtue.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Salvation.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Perfected One who Delivers from Suffering.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Mercy and Sin-Eradication.

Today, the repentant sponsor of this ritual and the entire assembly lift their aspirations toward the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest, together with all venerated sages, all great immortals, all great perfected ones, and all great divine youths—manifesting across the ten directions and throughout the boundless cosmos. May they, in unison, bestow the power of the Dao and arouse compassionate hearts. May the repentant sponsor, [Name], their parents of three lifetimes, their present parents, and all their kin—who have violated precepts and defied scriptures, accumulating manifold sins—through this act of repentance, attain liberation. From this day forward, through all future lives, may they don the dark crown and yellow robe, assuming the dharma-bodies of male or female officials. May they together uphold the precepts, receive the precepts at the same altar, accept the registers of precepts, study under the same master, undergo the same ordination, be jointly recommended, and simultaneously be delivered. Whether as male or female officials or youths, may they forever vow to observe the precepts, reverently tend the incense fire, remain ever vigilant, instruct and guide their dharma-disciples, uphold their vows, and walk the supreme Dao.

May the power of virtue and wisdom, through skillful means, rescue and deliver all sentient beings, freeing them from worldly defilements. May all who hear or witness this be filled with joy, ascend to the realization of non-action, and return to the Great Dao.

One bow.

The *Tai Shang* Merciful Compassion Ritual Arena for Dispelling Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms: Repentance Scroll Six Concludes
*The Tai Shang Merciful Compassion Ritual Arena for Dispelling Disasters and the Nine Dark Realms: Repentance Scroll Seven*

Compiled by Ge Xuan, the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate

**Chapter One: Dispelling Disobedience and Rebellion**

Today, the great assembly of this ritual arena, each turning their minds, bow their heads to the Merciful Honored One, repenting the sins of disobedience and unfilial impiety.

The repentance master, so-and-so, gathers their mind, kneels reverently, and listens attentively to the scriptural words. All sentient beings, from the moment they receive the illumination of sun and moon, drift with the turning of fate, endowed with skin and hair, all owing to their parents.

The Universal Savior says: Without examining the causes and conditions of parents, the weight of their kindness and obligation, how can one know the requital of their nurturing?

The Merciful Honored One says:
If the form is straight, its shadow must be upright;
If the form is not straight, its shadow must be crooked.
If the voice is clear, its echo must be pure;
If the voice is not clear, its sound must be turbid.
Filial piety and impiety follow this principle.

If one is filial and fraternal, within a single household, the old and young live in peace. The world holds them in esteem, divine spirits guard them, and descendants carry on the lineage, their filial kindness unbroken. They attract filial devotion, treasuring it as a precious jewel.

Yet if one is unfilial, generation after generation, within a single household, all become enemies. Though they speak of parents, they treat them as foes, summoning the disobedient to be their children. Parents and siblings keep separate finances and meals, share gardens but divide vegetables, split fields and grain, hide delicacies, and eat in secret. Though in human form, they are worse than birds and beasts. Divine spirits do not protect them; all their deeds in life are inauspicious. Upon death, they enter hell, enduring every suffering. Only after ten thousand kalpas are they reborn, as the *bailao* bird, whose young, upon hatching, devour their mother. Only after leaving the nest do they return to the human realm, where the unfilial gather as fathers and sons, harming one another, mutually resentful. No suffering in the world exceeds this.

Yet without a father, one would not be born; without a mother, one would not be raised. Thus, heaven and earth cover and nurture, entrusting life to the mother’s body. The two *qi* congeal, and for ten months she carries the child, burdened and heavy, sitting and lying uncomfortably. When the time is full, at the moment of birth, the mother is terrified, her life hanging by a thread. Her heart aches, her spirit grieves, and in an instant, she fears for her life. On the day of delivery, internal and external pains assail her, agony intertwined. She loses her voice in wailing, enduring great torment, trembling in fear, shocked and sighing.

Once born, the mother rejoices beyond measure, wrapping the child in swaddling clothes. For three months, she lies on her side, ever wary of evil spirits. When hungry, the child needs food—only the mother feeds them. When thirsty, the child needs drink—only the mother nurses them. Calculating the milk she drinks, it amounts to eight *hu* and four *sheng*. For a thousand days, the mother carries the child, washing away dirt and grime, placing them in dry spots while taking the wet, swallowing bitterness and offering sweetness. Without the father, there is no closeness; without the mother, there is no nurturing.

In the *Kaihuang* kalpa of old, there was a sentient being whose parents were aged, their strength and vitality waning. From dawn to dusk, their child never came to inquire after them. The parents dwelled alone in an empty room, like strangers. They had little clothing and scant food, hunger and cold piercing their bodies. Their hands and feet were stiff, their ears deaf and eyes dim. They slept on a single bed with a thin mat, each day feeling like a year. Their bodies were frail and emaciated, infested with ants and lice. Mosquitoes bit their flesh, and they could not sleep all night, sighing and groaning. Seeing their child’s unfilial conduct, they leaned on a staff to call out, heads bowed and breath subdued, wishing to voice their grievances but unable to finish their words. Their child raised their voice, glaring angrily, and cursed their parents. Turning away, they retreated, leaning on the wall to return home, beating their chest in sorrow, eyes swollen from weeping, crying out in misery, wishing they had died sooner.

The mother said to her elder son: When you were small, had I not raised you, fed you, and shielded you, you would not have survived. For ten months, I carried you like a heavy burden, my breath panting, more labored than running. At times, I suffered chills and fever, unable to sit or lie comfortably. My belly split, my chest felt full, my hair fell out, and I grew thin, unable to eat. A month before birth, I was constantly anxious, fearing we would not part. On the day of delivery, my life was like a flickering candle. My limbs and veins felt as if cut by knives, my five viscera and six bowels burned like fire. After you were born, joy and fear mingled; the pains and sorrows cannot be fully described. For three years, I carried you day and night, never apart. I endured filth, lost sleep, and missed meals, watching your complexion to tend to your hunger and fullness. If you fell ill, my heart ached for you. Hearing your suffering, I could not eat. My mouth and throat were parched as I sought every blessing. Gold and silver, clothes and toys—I wished for your safety and spared nothing.

I remember when you were small, you followed me everywhere, never leaving my side. You ate when I ate, slept when I slept. A single day without me, and you would not eat all day; a single night without me, and you would cry without sleep. How have you grown to suddenly become my enemy? Now, though I have you, it would be better if I had never borne you. I wish I could die soon and be free of you.

Thus, that child truly incurred the grave sin of disobedience and unfilial impiety. Upon death, they entered the Fengdu Hell of the North, enduring every suffering, experiencing all bitterness, dying and being reborn ten thousand times—none of it can be fully recounted.

Then, the Merciful Honored One, for those yet unenlightened, spoke this verse:

Good naturally meets good,
Evil returns to its evil root.
In life, lacking kindness and filial piety,
In death, one sinks forever.
Enduring all sufferings,
Passing through the eighteen gates.
If not on the day of my three pardons,
One will never hear of liberation.
Reborn as the *bailao* bird,
Flesh and bone torn by one’s young.
When the retribution is complete and one returns to the human path,
One meets again as child and grandchild.

Today, the great assembly of this ritual arena, hearing these scriptural words, must awaken greatly.

From past lives to this present existence, should any have committed the karmic transgressions of disobedience and unfilial conduct, in days to come they may yet suffer this retribution. Let them now diligently advance, arouse the mind of repentance, and vow that all beings who receive such retribution may together attain liberation. The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in memorial rites, bowing with the five limbs to the ground, single-mindedly arousing the vow.

With sincere reverence, I bow to the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.
With sincere reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues suffering upon hearing cries.

With cinnabar flowers and pure water, may they cleanse the three lifetimes’ kin of the repentant one, [Name], from the infinite kalpas past to this very day—should any have committed the karmic transgressions of disobedience and unfilial conduct, whether enacted or yet to be received—through this repentance, may all be extinguished, and may they not suffer retribution. From this day forward, in life after life, may they revere their parents as heaven and earth, as emperors and kings; may they stand in awe of their parents as the stars and the sun and moon. In the state, may they be utterly loyal; in the family, utterly filial. Toward all beings, human and non-human, may they fully observe kindness and obedience. May they awaken to past transgressions and early realize the Great Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Two: Vowing to Repay the Kindness of Mercy**

Today, in this ritual arena, each member of the great assembly directs their mind and takes refuge in the Merciful Honored One, speaking of the karmic causes and effects of repaying the kindness of mercy. The repentant one, [Name], collects their thoughts, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words. All beings cycle through birth and death, revolving through the dark realms. Now, I radiate great light, penetrating the five directions and ten lands. All suffering beings are delivered, save only those guilty of disobedience, who cannot ascend. Know that the kindness and righteousness of parents is profound and weighty. The boundless heavens cannot be repaid; even grinding one’s bones to powder and carving one’s flesh cannot fully requite it. If one can cultivate steadfast resolve, outwardly practicing filial devotion and nurturing, inwardly harboring vast compassion, then not only one’s own parents, but all beings are one’s parents. All beings are one’s brothers. All beings are one’s sisters. All beings are one’s flesh and blood. All beings are one’s sons and daughters. All beings are those who nurture and raise. All beings are those one loves and protects. Do not harm their lives; do not consume their flesh. Whether in past lives, future lives, or the present life, regard all beings as kin. Through manifold expedient means, this is called repaying kindness. Should any man or woman wish to perform meritorious deeds to repay the kindness of heaven and earth, the sovereign, their teachers, and their birth parents, let them proceed in order: first for heaven and earth, second for the emperor, third for their teachers, fourth for their birth parents, fifth for all beings of the great earth, and sixth for all their own kin. Yet among worldly men and women, from the moment they emerge from their mother’s womb, through one year, ten years, a hundred years, or a hundred and twenty years, they must prepare in advance. Beginning with the first seven-day period, cycling repeatedly, even unto distant years, let the meritorious deeds they perform follow this order: first, commissioning images; second, commissioning scriptures; third, erecting long banners of forty-nine feet, establishing forty-nine Dharma bodies, providing vegetarian feasts, and constructing ritual arenas to invite scriptures and images. Let the Dharma masters’ ritual lamps number forty-nine vessels, or more as their capacity allows. Let lamps be arranged like chariot wheels, burning for three days and nights, seven days and nights, or forty-nine days and nights, dedicated to the sovereign, the emperor, their teachers, Dharma kin, parents, siblings, and all their own kin. With hearts laid bare and utmost sincerity, they pay homage to my invoked titles, repent their own transgressions, pray for blessings and grace, repay the kindness of mercy, offer wholehearted devotion, and extol with praise.

All past transgressions, once repented, must be amended with renewed cultivation. Diligently observe fasts and precepts, turn the heart toward compassion and goodness, and extend almsgiving to the fields of merit—whether to the poor and lowly, the disabled, the sick and solitary elders, prisoners, hungry ghosts, or all sentient beings. Those who lack benevolence should be exhorted to embrace virtuous causes. For travelers from afar in dire need, provide succor, rescue them from peril, and offer clothing and food to ensure their sufficiency. Then, renew the vow to honor parents with filial piety. The wealthy should commission images and copy scriptures to deliver beings from the three wretched destinies and the five sufferings, and to liberate those sunk in the depths of torment. According to their vows, they may attain rebirth—this is the repayment of kindness.

If any man or woman, through accumulated deeds, has ever slandered the Three Treasures, been disloyal or unfilial, offended the sovereign or ruler, teachers, or parents, or committed the five grave transgressions—such deep and weighty sins that they fear falling into hell at life’s end and suffering myriad torments—let them, for the sake of the sovereign, ruler, teachers, or parents, generate resolve and make vows: transcribe scriptures and repentance texts, even a single line or verse; venerate my invoked titles, one or two or many. On the day of their passing, they shall not enter hell nor endure former karmic retribution, but proceed directly to heaven to receive boundless joy.

If any man or woman, for the sake of the sovereign, ruler, teachers, parents, or their own kin, observes the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, either at home or at sacred altars, venerates my sacred titles, repents sins and averts misfortune, holds grand vegetarian feasts, prepares fragrant offerings piled high as mountains, gathers fruits and herbs, presents flowers, and arranges pure offerings—vigilantly seeking blessings and grace through the night—then may the nation and household be secured, the great earth delivered, and all sentient beings rescued. Let none commit the ten evils or grave offenses, and may the sins of nine generations of ancestors, whether already suffered or yet to be, all be extinguished. If on such days the meaning of the scriptures is expounded, and the ignorant and benighted are guided to awaken loyalty, filial piety, and the resolve to save others, this merit shall be foremost.

Then, the Compassionate Honored One, for the sake of those yet unawakened, spoke this verse:

All people in the world,
Should cultivate filial piety in body and mind.
Revere and cherish heaven and earth,
As you would your own parents.
Ultimately attain the fruit of the Dao,
With wondrous practices renewed each day.
I now expound the sublime Dharma,
To deliver those sunk in suffering.
Karma unfolds in endless retribution,
Turning the wheel of kalpas day and night.
I establish this great Dharma bridge,
To ferry you across the river of craving.
Wondrous indeed are the Three Caverns’ scriptures,
Transcending those with karmic affinity.

Today, the master of repentance in this ritual arena, along with the assembly, having heard the scriptural teachings on repaying kindness through myriad causes, all awaken to the need for gratitude and vow never to act in defiance. Today, prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, they bow with their entire being, wholeheartedly generating resolve.

Through the power of this repentance, may all beings, whether male or female, embody the mysterious wind of unity and take refuge in the Great Dao.

One bow to the third repentance rite: *Dissolving Residual Karmic Obstructions*

Today, the great assembly of this Dao altar, each with focused mind, reverently faces the Compassionate Honored One to repent and release the multitude of residual karmic obstructions. The repentance master, with sincere heart and kneeling posture, listens attentively to the scriptural words:

All beings arise from the primordial qi of the undifferentiated. Through the kindness of parents—carrying, nurturing, breastfeeding—they gradually grow, yet unable to discern, they become entangled in desire, and the roots of transgression flourish. If not for repentance, if not for the expounding of scriptures and precepts, gently guiding them into the right Dao, they would forever remain bound by the ignorance of aversion and attachment, fettered to the mundane world.

Parents can only give birth to us; they cannot perfect us. It is our teachers who reveal the scriptures and precepts, enabling us to transcend afflictions. Thus, the kindness of teachers surpasses even that of parents.

Yet we see beings who, from the moment they establish themselves in the world, fail to recognize the profound debt owed to their teachers. Instead, they respond with scorn and abuse, withhold what is needed, deny sweet sustenance, refuse clothing and food, treat them as strangers, or even plot harm. Such acts align them with rebellious children, inviting karmic retribution in return.

We see beings who observe fasts and precepts—some, occupying high positions, humiliate those beneath them; others, relying on wealth and status, oppress the orphaned and impoverished...

Some abuse their power to oppress the lowly and weak; others, holding office, make extortion their intent, inflicting cruel punishments at will, enriching themselves at public expense, and acting against the Dao/Way. They encroach upon the blessed lands of the Three Treasures, occupying their pure sanctuaries. Some commission revered images, transcribe scriptures, or establish sacred observatories, construct refectories, and hold fasts and rituals. Yet as leaders, they steal property, engage in fraudulent trade, or misappropriate the wealth of monastic endowments or donors. They live alongside parents, siblings, and kin, yet in all their dealings, they deceive and rob one another. They shift fences to encroach on others’ land, seize fields and gardens, exploit public authority to seize others’ inns and shops, cheat merchants in trade, use false weights and measures, reduce lengths and widths, conceal fractions of grain, falsify calculations, substitute coarse for fine, exchange short for long, and devise a hundred deceits to gain the slightest profit. They burn others’ homes, falsely implicate the innocent, envy others’ wealth and status, spread slander, and vent rage upon their parents. They lend capital to exact exorbitant interest, indulge in greed and desire, seize others’ property by force, refuse to repay debts, and deny their obligations. They kill without cause, engage in illicit sacrifices, defy public and private authority, file baseless accusations, act with arrogance and rudeness, deceive superiors and betray subordinates. Some strip the belongings of ordained practitioners, desecrate graves to steal coffins, or cast nets and traps to cunningly seize creatures from ponds, pools, rivers, the Huai and Ji, seas and streams, springs, lakes, and waterways. Such karmic offenses are manifold and beyond count. If beings commit even one such transgression, they incur grave retribution, burdening billions of ancestors across ten thousand generations, as well as their parents, themselves, and their six relations and nine clans. The deceased and those of past lives suffer misfortune, descending into hell, where each is ground by millstones, enduring retribution for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth—if reborn at all, they may not survive infancy, living out their days in solitude. Such karmic conditions are predestined. Today, in this ritual assembly, as the scriptures declare, the sins and blessings, good and evil of beings return in retribution, seen and heard like a turning wheel, swift as an echo. Let each gather their thoughts and cultivate in accord with the teachings. If years pass in vain, and age and illness press upon you, when body and life perish in a single day, what means remain to escape this sinking into darkness? Through this rite of repentance, may all—those present, past, and yet to incur such karmic offenses—receive the moisture of the Dharma, universally attain liberation, and be freed from bondage.

The repentant one, [Name], prostrates in reverence, bowing with body, mind, and heart, to offer this text of repentance for peace and merit-transference. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, they raise their thoughts in devotion:

With bowed head, they pay homage to the Compassionate Venerable One, reverently saluting the true and sacred.

Today, the repentant one of this ritual assembly, together with all present, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the North, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected Ones, all the Great Perfected Persons, all the Great Divine Youths, and all the boundless hosts of divine immortals and sacred assemblies—those who pervade the ten directions, fill the vast expanse, and manifest as all true and sacred beings. With the water of cinnabar blossoms, may they cleanse the hearts and mouths of the repentant one, [Name], their billions of ancestors across ten thousand generations, their parents, uncles, brothers, themselves, their sons and daughters, all their kin, and both the living and the dead. From kalpas past to the present, from this life to this very day, for all the karmic offenses and sins they have committed, and all the residual karmic burdens they have accrued in this world, whether now confined in the prisons of hell, may they repent and be swiftly purified, depart from evil paths, enter good conditions, avoid the five destinies, and universally attain carefree joy. May they drink from the single Dharma, be reborn in eternal bliss, realize the unconditioned, and together ascend the Great Dao/Way.

One bow. *Seeing Karmic Retribution*, Fourth Chapter.

All beings who deface or destroy the true and sacred images of the Perfected, or the Three Caverns’ scriptures, shall in this life suffer leprosy as retribution, and upon death enter hell, where only after ten thousand kalpas may they be reborn—into the body of a wild beast.

Those who engage in licentious acts with the Dharma-body of the renunciates shall in this life suffer the retribution of loneliness and widowhood, and in past lives be reborn in latrines and cesspits.

All such bodily forms in this life arise from past offenses and karmic transgressions, from dying and passing through hell, and even in future rebirths, the retribution shall know no respite.

The Merciful Honored One addressed the Universal Savior, saying: “You must wholeheartedly believe and uphold this, clearly instructing future generations, so that all men and women may fully understand the karmic retributions of past lives, the manifold causes and conditions. Today, the great assembly of this Daoist ritual, as the scriptures declare, suffers these various retributions in this life due to deeds committed in past lives. You must awaken and reflect deeply. Do not say that hell is unreal or that heaven is a falsehood. You must arouse sincere and earnest mindfulness, with deep remorse and gravity. May all beings follow and obey the teachings, entering the Dharma-gate, just as one who wishes to traverse a perilous path must find a ladder or boat. Without such merit, by what means can one cross over?”

The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in supplication. With the five limbs touching the ground, and with wholehearted devotion, bows to the Merciful Honored One and reverently salutes the true and sacred ones.

From this day forward, may I regard all sentient beings as myself; may I vow to renounce all evil deeds upon witnessing them; and may I resolve to learn from all virtuous conditions upon encountering them. Awakening to the fruits of karma, may I cultivate practice in accordance with the teachings.

May I, in life after life, never lose my human nature. May all sentient beings, in the worlds to come, together be born in the Land of Bliss and equally partake of the Mysterious Wind.

Prostrating in reverence, I take refuge in the Supreme True Dao.
One bow.

Compiled by Supreme Left Immortal Lord Ge Xuan

**First Chapter: Deliverance from the Sufferings of Fengdu Hell**

Today, the great assembly of this *Dao* altar, each with concentrated mind, reverently faces the Compassionate Honored One to deliver those suffering in Fengdu Hell.

The repentant master, kneeling in prostration, listens attentively to the scriptural words: Hell is neither existent nor nonexistent.

The Universal Savior asks, “Why is it said to be nonexistent?”
The Compassionate Honored One replies, “If all sentient beings do not indulge the three karmic actions, do not give rein to the six senses, do not commit the ten evils, nor perpetrate the five rebellious acts or any transgressions, then upon death they will not enter the nine dark hells of Fengdu but proceed directly to the heavenly realms, carefree and at ease. This is what is meant by nonexistent.”

“Why is it said to be not nonexistent?”
“If sentient beings indulge the three karmic actions and six senses, commit the ten evils, the five rebellious acts, and boundless transgressions, then upon death they will enter the nine dark hells of Fengdu, where each offense is examined and punished. They shall endure bitter agonies for ten thousand kalpas before rebirth. This is what is meant by not nonexistent.”

Since it is known to be not nonexistent, one must seek repentance. A single day of self-reflection, awakening, and repentance dissolves the sins of ten thousand kalpas. How is the power of this repentance known? In ancient times, there was a man born foolish and ignorant, who committed myriad sins. One day, he reflected and awakened; witnessing the five signs of decay, he was seized with terror and took refuge in the Three Treasures. Thereupon, the roots of his decay and transgressions instantly dissolved, and his heavenly years were prolonged. Thus, all here present, with the teachings clearly expounded, know that repentance enables sentient beings to avoid hell and its manifold sufferings.

If one does not encounter a good spiritual guide, evil karma deepens. They may know only to wash away the grease and grime from the body but fail to sweep the dust from the heart. Thus, at life’s end, they enter hell and endure the weight of their transgressions. At such a time, remorse and fear come too late. Body and mind are shattered, spirit and soul scattered. The wind-knives stand before them; repentance is no longer possible. What recourse remains for their suffering?

All you sentient beings, do not rely on your prime of life, do not cling to wealth and treasure, do not become attached to family and kin. Do not indulge in fleeting pleasures, courting the agony of death. When the great limit arrives, it spares neither rich nor poor, neither old nor young, neither noble nor base—all are ground to nothingness. Like the wind’s lamp or spark from stone, what endures? Like lightning at noon or morning dew, what is firm?

When the five celestial messengers and the death-dealing ghosts of impermanence arrive, even youth and radiant beauty cannot resist. At that moment, grand halls and secluded chambers become irrelevant; fine carriages and mighty steeds cannot follow; wives, children, and kin are no longer one’s own; the seven treasures and precious ornaments become playthings for others. The Merciful Honored One said: In the Red Clarity Kalpa of old, there was a sentient being, sharp-witted and intelligent, who subdued afflictions. Though wealthy, he refused to give alms to the poor. When his life ended, he fell into the animal realm, reborn as a red fox, enduring karmic retribution in full. All you sentient beings, be ever vigilant—lest in a single morning you be bound to such suffering, when regret comes too late.

Consider this: in the world of the living, if one faces even a minor matter and must enter the public court, though the offense be slight, the heart trembles in fear. Kinfolk grow anxious, exhausting every means to seek deliverance. How much more so for the beings in hell? Compared to them, such distress is but a shadow.

Countless hells, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, are all governed within this celestial realm. Located in the far north, beyond the Northern Heavens, past boundless, measureless dark abysses, there lies a world called the Five Qi Mystic Heaven, the Dark North, the Solitary, Profound, and Utmost Land. Within it, the Five Qi Five Spirits Mystic Elder Black Emperor Heavenly Lord presides over the northern quarter, restraining the yin demons.

Beneath this land lies the Great Void, the Vast Wilderness, and the boundless, fathomless Black Sea. Its waters are vile, its shores unknowable. At its center rises a great mountain, piercing the azure heavens above and plunging into the windy springs below—Mount Fengdu of the North. It towers one million six hundred thousand *li* high, with a circumference of five hundred thousand *li*. Its base sinks fifteen thousand *li* into the water. At the water’s edge, where the mountain’s foot meets the sea, lies a vast cavern called the Yin Shadow Heaven, the land known as Great Yin.

Beneath the Water Emperor are thirty-six lesser hells, each walled in iron, ninefold encircled. Within each hell, grasses and trees arise from the naturally venomous qi, their branches and leaves transformed into blades and swords, their edges sharp and plentiful. Fierce beasts, scorching smoke, and black winds rage ceaselessly, day and night. The darkness is profound, poisonous qi and bloody light surge, and the stench of filth and decay fills the air. The light of sun, moon, and stars cannot penetrate these hells.

Thirty-seven kings preside, each over one hell. Within each, seventy tiers of knife-forests stand, along with countless iron nets. Fire blazes from above, flames surge from below, intertwining like fish in a searing pan. The iron-walled cities have four gates, and at each gate stand four great bronze dogs, each body spanning forty *li*. When they roar, the iron walls tremble. Their fangs are like forests of swords, their claws sharp and forms ferocious—beyond compare.

There are also countless iron birds, each over a *zhang* in size, with beaks of bronze and claws of iron. They beat their wings in flight, eyes like shooting stars, feathers like iron arrows, each tipped with swirling flames. When they shriek, their cries shake the earth like thunderbolts. Fire spews from their beaks and feathers, and all such creatures devour the marrow of the damned. The pain of the condemned is beyond description, their suffering piercing to the liver and heart. For immeasurable ages, they seek life but find none, seek respite but receive none.

Today, in this ritual assembly, as the sutras describe, such hells exist—boundless and unceasing, their torments endless. Through this rite of repentance, we extend our prayers to all hells, that those enduring suffering may attain liberation.

The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, bowing with utmost reverence, listening with single-minded devotion. With bowed head, we pay homage to the Merciful Honored One and reverently venerate the true sages:

For the repentant one, [Name], and those of the past—nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of kin, parents of three lifetimes, uncles, brothers, and all family—who may be confined in darkness, enduring torment, may they swiftly attain liberation through the power of this repentance, the power of merit and virtue, and the inconceivable power, ascending to the Dao of non-action.

A Bow: Expounding the Thirty-Seven Hells, Second Scroll

Today, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary, each with concentrated mind, reverently faces the Merciful Honored One to recite the names of the thirty-seven hells.

The repentant one, [Name], gathers his thoughts, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the exposition:

In Fengdu’s Mount Luoshan, to the east, west, south, and north, thirty-six hells are arrayed. At their center lies one hell, called the Northern Mount Luoshan, the Great Avīci Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering.

The Universal Savior speaks: “To the east, west, south, and north, thirty-six hells in all—may we hear their names.”

The Merciful Honored One replies:
To the east are nine hells: Heavenly One, Heavenly Overseer, Heavenly Leveler, Heavenly Void, Heavenly Sovereign, Nine Heavens, Primordial Rectitude, Punitive Rectitude, and Great Perfected.
To the south are nine hells: Flowing Fire, Fire Pellets, Fire Arrows, Flying Fire, Burning Feet, Fire Elephant, Burning Body, Primordial Leveler, and Prohibitive Punishment.
To the west are nine hells: Iron Chariots, Iron Horses, Iron Oxen, Iron Donkeys, Iron Awls, Iron Beds, Iron Staffs, Iron Chains, and Iron Rakes.
To the north are nine hells: Dark Sands, Northern Darkness, Female Azure, River Earl, Profound Darkness, Accumulated Kalpas, Statutory Decrees, Excrement and Urine, and Ice Pools.

These thirty-six hells, each governed by the karmic deeds of beings, administer punishment according to their offenses.

At their center lies one hell, where those guilty of the ten evils and five heinous crimes are confined. Within it stand:
Knife Mountains and Sword Trees,
Cauldrons of Boiling Water and Furnaces of Burning Coals,
Molten Copper Pillars,
Iron Plows and Iron Pellets,
Iron Awls and Iron Mills,
Iron Pestles and Iron Mountains,
Iron Nails and Iron Cangues,
Iron Rods and Iron Scales,
Iron Shackles and Iron Manacles,
Iron Locks and Iron Caskets,
Iron Birds and Ash Rivers,
Snow Mountains and Ice Wells,
Fire Pits and Dismemberment,
Strangulation and Sawing,
Flaying of Skin,
Stinking Turtles and Smoldering Embers,
Burning from Feet to Hands,
Blades, Needles, and Narrow Rocks,
Fire Mountains and Fire Mills—
countless torments, beyond numbering.

Within hangs a mirror that reflects the sins of the damned, revealing every hidden transgression. A moment there is like an eon passed. Ten thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths, each agony more bitter than the last. No other hell compares.

The warden of this hell oversees all others, hence it is called the Great Central Hell.
*Avīci* means “great,” and *bi* means “to obstruct.” *Wu jian* means “without respite.” Thus, it is called the Great Avīci Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering.
Alternatively, *a* means “unceasing,” and *bi* means “unrelenting.” Torment and pain know no pause, no rest. Within, karmic winds blow upon the bodies and minds of the damned, shattering them into ten thousand deaths, only to revive them in an instant. Thus, in a single moment, ten thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths occur—so it is in all the hells.

Here, the Great Emperor of Fengdu commands two hundred forty bureaus, overseeing fifty thousand minions who interrogate the damned, probing the weight of their sins, leaving no detail unexamined, and reporting all deeds, good and evil.

Consider the Iron Chariot, engulfed in fierce flames, ever ablaze. A yakṣa dwells within; from afar, the damned see it as a fair maiden and long to approach. Yet upon entering, their flesh and bones turn to ash and smoke.

The Iron Ox’s body, head, fur, horns, and tail are sharp as blades. From afar, the damned see it as a golden lotus, but upon reaching it, flames and smoke consume their bodies, leaving no trace.

The Iron Horse’s form, mane, and tail are keen as sword edges. The Iron Donkey is the same. Each is led by a yakṣa to the damned. When they mount, their bodies dissolve. The Iron Rakes and other implements of torment—cruel, vicious, and venomous, with raging fires and razor edges—are beyond description.

You, all beings, may hear of these torments but must never witness them. Should you encounter such a place, escape would be impossible for ten thousand kalpas.

Do not speak idly of hells and heavens. The unseen and the seen are equal; life and death are the same. It is like a man’s dream and his waking: death is as the dream, and birth as waking. What is done in dreams differs not from waking; what is done in death differs not from life. Joy in dreams is self-made; suffering in waking is self-caused.

You, all beings, should reflect deeply and seek early deliverance. The means to deliverance is none other than repentance. After repentance, abandon past wrongs and cultivate anew.

Moreover, in the Middle Kingdom, it is rare to obtain a human body. Rarer still is one who cultivates good fruits. Like the sun and moon, whose light shines impartially, illuminating all, leaving no darkness unlit—you, all beings, are neither blind nor deaf. The blind see not the sun and moon; the deaf hear not of good and evil. Having heard of good and evil, having seen the sun and moon, those who do not awaken are like vines clinging to a tree: as the tree grows, so do they. When the tree falls, what will the vines cling to?

Today, the assembly of this Daoist sanctuary, as the scriptures warn, trembles in fear and sorrow. Now, with diligence, we bow in repentance, seeking mercy. May we, life after life, never encounter such places. May all beings in hells, hungry ghosts, and animal realms alike attain liberation.

The repentant one, [Name], prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, throwing himself to the ground with utmost sincerity. With reverence, he bows to the Merciful Honored One and venerates the true and sacred.

With devoted heart, he bows to the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows Blessings.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves at the Sound of Suffering.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Ascendant Immortals.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.

With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassion and Love.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Constant Mercy.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of No Coming and No Going.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Shelters All.

With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Good Fruits in the Six Paths.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Clarity and Numinous Transformation.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Clarity and Constant Serenity.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny.

With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion Who Guards the Realm.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Joy.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Expanse.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ocean of Merit and Virtue.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Perfected of Orthodox Unity.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Perfected Who Attends the Scriptures.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.
With devoted heart, he bows to the Perfected of Great Mercy Who Removes Transgressions.

Today, the patrons of this Daoist ritual and all the assembly reverently pray that the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Great Realized Ones, all the Great Dragon Spirits, all the Great Worthies and Sages, and all the Great Divine Youths—throughout the ten directions and the boundless expanse of the Mysterious Void, all the Perfected and Sages—by the power of great compassion, the power of repentance rites, the power of merit and virtue, and the power of inconceivable efficacy, may grant that the repentance sponsor, so-and-so, their parents of this and past lives, all their relatives by blood and marriage, and their living and deceased kin—those who have passed on, if they suffer in hell for their transgressions—through this act of repentance, be liberated.

We further pray that the Merciful Honored One may manifest the power of goodness to eradicate from the Fengdu Avīci Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering:
the karmic retribution of falling upon knife mountains and sword trees, where limbs and bodies are severed;
the karmic retribution of boiling cauldrons and burning coals, where bodies are scorched and cooked;
the karmic retribution of iron beds and bronze pillars, where bodies are seared and charred;
the karmic retribution of blade wheels and fire chariots, where thunderous bolts strike;
the karmic retribution of having tongues plowed and bodies harrowed, where agony is unbearable;
the karmic retribution of swallowing molten iron pellets and having molten bronze poured into the mouth, where bones and flesh dissolve and rot;
the karmic retribution of being pounded and ground into dust, where bodies are reduced to ashes;
the karmic retribution of having limbs and joints torn apart;
the karmic retribution of wading through filthy ash rivers, where torment and suffocation prevail;
the karmic retribution of enduring saltwater and freezing ice, where skin splits and flesh cracks;
the karmic retribution of being mauled by tigers, wolves, eagles, and hounds, where mutual destruction occurs;
the karmic retribution of being clawed and slashed by blade mountains, where bodies are torn and pierced;
the karmic retribution of being roasted in fire pits, crushed between grinding stones, where bodies are shattered;
the karmic retribution of darkness and confinement, where flesh mountains are carved, bodies are sawed, twisted, and nailed, and limbs are severed;
the karmic retribution of being hung upside down with iron rods, where bodies are butchered and burned, and cries of anguish resound;
the karmic retribution of the great and small Iron Enclosures, the thirty-seven cities, where the three luminaries are unseen, and the sounds *apapa*, *apavava*, *ataṭa*, *ararara* echo—the sufferings of the eight cold and eight hot hells;
the karmic retribution of all the hells, where iron hooks drag bodies, tendons are pulled, intestines are torn, flesh is sliced, and bones are shaved—countless agonies;
may all these karmic retributions be eradicated.

May the kings, their retinues, and all beings receive the moisture of the Dharma and together attain promotion and reward. May all our kin—those not related by blood yet closer than kin—after the breath of life has ceased, whether they have entered these hells or not, by the power of this repentance for karmic transgressions, ascend to the Heavenly Paradise and take refuge in the Great Dao.

One bow.

*Repentance of the Nine Dark Realms, Third Scroll*

Today, all in this Daoist ritual assembly, each with focused mind, reverently face the Merciful Honored One to repent for the sufferings of the Nine Dark Hells in the Nine Dark Realms. The repentance sponsor, so-and-so, gathers their thoughts, kneels in devotion, and listens attentively to the scriptural words.

The Nine Dark Realms lie in the northeast, the land of yin and darkness. Beneath the nine ramparts is the Nine Dark Hell, deep and sunken, where beings are bound and confined.

In the east is the Wind and Thunder Hell, where black winds and thunderous bolts ceaselessly strike, and flying spears and halberds pierce through. The bodies of the condemned are torn apart, and for ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

In the south is the Fire Obscuration Hell, where the condemned swallow fire and devour coals, scorched by flames. Their heads and faces are charred and rotting, fire mountains rest upon their crowns, and their skin, flesh, and bones blaze in every joint. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

In the west is the Vajra Hell, where the condemned are beaten with countless iron hammers and rods. Their limbs rot and disintegrate, tendons and bones scatter, iron forks pierce their bellies, and golden hammers lodge in their hearts. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

In the north is the Dark and Cold Hell, where the condemned sink into freezing pools. Ice spears and frost blades sever their tendons and bones, and the juices of a hundred poisons are poured upon them. Their bodies disintegrate, and their hearts and bellies rupture. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

In the center is the Universal Torment Hell, where the condemned endure unbearable pain from beatings. Their tendons snap, blood flows, and they collapse in suffocating agony. Then, the hell wardens impale them with iron forks, forcing them to ascend blade mountains and sword trees, where winds from eight directions sway the trees. Their feet tread upon blade mountains, and their bodies are impaled upon sword edges. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

In the southeast is the Bronze Pillar Hell, where great fires rage with fierce flames. The condemned embrace and climb the pillars, their outer and inner bodies charred and rotting, their backs and bellies oozing pus. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

In the southwest is the Butchery Hell, where the condemned are hung upside down, their bodies sliced by blades. Their four limbs, tendons, veins, skin, and five viscera are all cut by knives. Blood flows from their bodies, pooling upon the ground, the pain unbearable. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

In the northwest is the Fire Chariot Hell, where the condemned are torn apart by five chariots, their limbs scattered. Some are placed within the chariots, which drag them east and west. All wheels are edged with blades, and as they turn, they slice the condemned. Fierce fires burn their bodies to cinders. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

In the northeast is the Boiling Cauldron Hell, where the condemned are impaled by iron forks and cast into cauldrons.

Their five bodily parts are boiled and simmered, their four limbs fester and dissolve, pus and blood reek with foulness—unbearable torment. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day and night.

Pǔjì asked, “What grave offenses condemn one to such torment? And who presides over their unceasing interrogation?”

The Compassionate One replied, “Those who commit the three karmic transgressions—slandering the Great Vehicle, disloyalty to the sovereign, maligning monastics, defiling the Dharma-body, destroying sacred images, or embezzling monastic property—fall into the Nine Dark Hells to endure this retribution. There, the Three Officials govern the Nine Bureaus, where clerks and magistrates conduct inquiries, extending even to Fengdu.”

Pǔjì asked, “Is each transgression met with a single punishment, or are a hundred offenses met with a hundred torments?”

The Compassionate One replied, “Iron beds and bronze pillars, agony unbearable—crushed bones and scorched sinews repay the sin of lust. Freezing cold that sears to the bone, forcing them to lie in icy rivers, repays the sin of theft. Molten copper poured into their mouths, tongues torn out and plowed, eyes pecked by vile birds. Sword trees splay their limbs, grinding mills pulverize them like grain—this repays the sin of deceitful glances. Their bodies become hungry ghosts, wandering through cauldrons of boiling liquid, forced to swallow iron pellets when hunger strikes—this repays the sin of breaking precepts. Each interrogation and torment corresponds precisely to their karma, with no discrepancy.

Today, in this ritual space, the penitent, [Name], prostrates in reverence, vowing to dedicate merit with diligence. May the anguish of the Nine Dark Hells be repented, and may all karmic retribution destined for them today be wholly dissolved. The penitent, [Name], bows in devotion, invoking blessings for peace, and recites this repentance text, prostrating with full sincerity, listening with undivided mind.

With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of supreme radiance.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who rescues suffering.

With devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected of Liberation.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion who rescues suffering.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Perfected of Great Mercy who absolves transgressions.

Today, the patrons of this ritual space and the great assembly pray to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure in the northeast, and to all the Venerable Ones, all the Great Perfected, and all the Divine Youths—may they, who pervade the ten directions, the farthest reaches of the cosmos, and all the True and Sacred, radiate their perfect light to illuminate the dark prisons. May destruction be eradicated, and all attain purity. May all suffering souls transcend to the Land of Ultimate Bliss. May blade mountains and sword trees transform into jeweled forests, cauldrons and furnaces into lotus blossoms. May ox-headed jailers become benevolent companions, and all ghosts and spirits abandon malevolent thoughts.

Through this repentance ritual, may all imprisoned in the earth prisons be absolved. May the six paths and four modes of birth awaken to non-action and ascend the true Dao. One bow.

**Chapter Four: Absolving Hell-Prisons, Delivering Hungry Ghosts and Animals**

Today, in this ritual space, each member of the great assembly directs their mind, gazing up to the Compassionate One, arousing compassion and cultivating equanimity. May all officials of the hells be elevated, and may hungry ghosts, animals, and beings in the evil destinies be delivered.

The penitent, [Name], kneels in reverence, concentrating their thoughts, prostrating in repentance. Moreover, the ox-headed jailers, rākṣasas, yakṣas, and countless malevolent ghosts dwelling in hell have yet to transcend the cycle of rebirth. Adrift in the vast sea of suffering, confined in the dark prisons, they have no refuge, forever shrouded in gloom. There are also copper dogs, iron birds, iron horses, iron snakes, iron donkeys, iron oxen, stinking turtles, fierce beasts, venomous insects, and all manner of evil beings—each repaying past misdeeds, bound by karmic retribution.

Today, through this repentance ritual, we vow to universally dedicate our thoughts, relying on the power of goodness, the power of the Dao, and the power of merit. May all officials of the hells attain liberation, escape the realm of suffering, and gradually ascend to the ranks of celestial immortals, reuniting with the supreme Dao. May their karmic fruits transform, and may they be reborn as humans. May all venomous beings self-destruct.

Moreover, those in the realm of hungry ghosts endure eternal hunger and thirst. Though they crave to devour mountains, they never hear the names of broth or water, food or drink, and instead consume pus, blood, and foulness. When their bodies move, their limbs ignite with fire. Their bellies swell like drums, their necks thin as bowstrings.

Today, through this repentance ritual, we vow with boundless thoughts, relying on the power of merit, the inconceivable power, and the power of deliverance. May all hungry ghosts and their kin attain rebirth, receive human form, and enjoy exquisite food and drink that arrive at their wish.

Moreover, those in the animal realm—all species, devoid of knowledge and freedom—endure whipping, torture, slaughter, and butchery. Some have feet, scales, wings, or hooves; some fly, some walk; some have fur, shells, horns, or claws; some are large, some small; some are eaten by humans, others are not. Aquatic creatures, wriggling beings, those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation—all such kinds.

Through the power of this Daoist ritual arena, the power of repentance rites, and the power of merit, may they attain rebirth in the human realm. The repentant patron [Name] prostrates for peace and offers posthumous deliverance, fearing the karmic causes that may lead to downfall. Relying on this repentance, may all be fully liberated.

The repentant patron [Name] prostrates with five limbs to the ground, wholeheartedly invoking. Bowing in reverence to the Merciful Venerable One, paying homage to the true sages:

With devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.
With devout heart, I pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response who saves from suffering.

With devout heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct.
With devout heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Compassion who saves from suffering.
With devout heart, I pay homage to the Perfected of Great Mercy who absolves transgressions.

Today, the patrons of this ritual arena and the great assembly, looking up in hope, invoke the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, all the venerable ones and sages, all the great immortals of the Five Peaks, the immortals of watery abysses and grottoes, the worthies and sages of altars and earthly domains, all dragon deities and local earth gods throughout the ten directions, to the farthest reaches of the boundless void, all the infinite true sages bearing countless titles.

May all invoke the power of aspiration, the power of vast vows, the power of repentance rites, the power of merit, the boundless and infinite power, so that the repentant patron [Name]’s nine generations of ancestors, three lifetimes of kin, those who have relinquished or received bodies—whether in the hells, the realm of hungry ghosts, or the animal realm, yet to attain liberation—may, through this repentance, achieve transcendence and rebirth, attaining carefree freedom. Through this wondrous power and the power of the Dao, may it extend to all beings, that together they may embrace the mystic wind and ascend the Great Dao.

One bow.

**Section Five: Liberation from Harm Caused by Womb-Birth**

Today, within this sacred precinct, all assembled turn their minds in devotion, prostrating before the Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Compassionate Savior of Suffering in the ten directions, to dissolve and release the calamities of womb-birth and harm inflicted upon others.

The repentant patron [Name], gathering their heart in reverence, kneels and listens attentively, invoking this aspiration:

For the harm of womb-birth is inherited across generations—ancestral customs of worshipping ghosts and spirits, immersion in worldly defilements, and the proliferation of deceit and transgression. Thus, sins accumulate like mountains, summoning severe retribution. In recent years, affairs have been fraught with misfortune, entangled in illness and suffering, with unceasing calamities. Frightening dreams arise in profusion, and strange omens manifest without end. Since ancient times, the afflictions of ancestors have never ceased.

Whether from the three generations of great-grandparents, seven generations of ancestors, nine lineages of kin, or the three lifetimes of parents—both maternal and paternal—if ancestral tombs remain unsettled, they may harbor litigious spirits or malevolent ghosts, their baleful influence unbroken. Or perhaps in burial, construction, relocation, or renovation; in marriage rites or the selection of inauspicious days and hours; in violating taboos; or in excavating pits and trenches, disturbing earth spirits—such acts may subject the living and the dead to torment and punishment, binding their souls in confinement. The misfortunes thus incurred flow onward, extending even to future generations. The transgressions committed are too numerous to recount.

Today, with utmost devotion, we perform this repentance rite, beseeching the Three Saints with sorrowful sincerity, that through this liberation, the repentant patron [Name] may attain deliverance.

Prostrating in reverence for peace and to offer this repentance text, the patron [Name] bows with body and mind, earnestly invoking the Compassionate Savior, paying homage to the True Saints:

With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ascended Immortals.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Golden Palace and Jade Treasure.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Pristine Forces.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Divine Transformation and Dao’s Workings.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Nine Natural Perfected Ones.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Wondrous Gathering in Golden Clouds.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Radiant Illumination, Dharma Kings.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Golden Form, Serene and Profound.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of a Hundred Billion Manifested Bodies.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Natural Golden Perfected Ones.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Mystic Penetration and Universal Awakening.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Origins, Keepers of Records.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Caverns, Profound and Still.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Supreme Mystery, Wondrous and Victorious.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Illuminating Response and True Realization.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Liberation from the Four Delusions.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Supreme Unity’s Savior of Suffering.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Longevity and Life Preservation.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Universal Compassion and Nation-Protection.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of Boundless Extent.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ocean of Merit.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Perfected One of Serene Emptiness.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Perfected One of Serene Wisdom.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Great Compassionate Savior of Suffering.
With devoted heart, we bow to the Great Merciful Redeemer of Sins.

Today, the repentant patron and all assembled in this sacred precinct humbly beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the northeast, along with all the Venerable Saints, Great Perfected Ones, and Divine Youths—spanning the ten directions, the boundless void, past and future, all hidden and manifest True Saints.

Through the power of the Great Dao-heart, the power of non-action, the power of merit, and the power of supreme goodness, may the three generations of the repentant patron [Name]’s souls—whether lost to famine, banditry, or warfare; to blades, ropes, or unjust imprisonment; to tigers, wolves, or poisonous curses; to bewitchment by trees or stones; to fire, drowning, or self-inflicted wounds; to hanging, epidemics, or the five poisons; to ulcers, leprosy, abscesses, or festering sores; to madness, starvation, or freezing; to sudden malevolent forces or murder by evil spirits; to childbirth complications or miscarriage; to attacks by birds of prey or foxes; or to injuries from livestock—those confined in celestial prisons or earthly hells, bearing sand on their backs or stones upon their shoulders, hauling mountains or filling rivers, enduring ceaseless toil and suffering—be liberated.

Or perhaps their tombs and burial grounds were disturbed, graves opened, coffins desecrated, bones scattered and exposed, skulls and limbs strewn apart, left unburied in the wild, their souls adrift without refuge. Through the power of this virtuous act, may the three generations of souls, long departed, find rest: if their bones lie in water, may they be water-buried; if in fire, fire-buried; if on earth, exposed to the elements; if devoured by beasts, hidden in concealment; if upon wood or stone, entrusted to their care; if slain by blades, transformed by the sword.

May the repentant patron [Name], from this day forward, be freed from misfortune, illness, and suffering; may nightmares cease, and omens vanish. May ancestral souls and tombs forever know peace and prosperity, their households flourishing, sons and daughters thriving, receiving blessings and office, with descendants succeeding in unbroken lineage. May glory and nobility endure across generations, ever upheld by the profound grace of the Dao.

One bow.

**First Chapter: Praying for the State**

Today, the assembly of this Daoist ritual, each with focused mind, gazes reverently toward the Compassionate Honored One. May you expound for all beings, teaching them to pray for the state and their households, seeking grace and blessings.

The repentant patron [Name], kneeling with hands clasped, listens attentively to the scriptural words. If the sovereign faces calamity—celestial bodies losing their course, wars erupting on all sides, winds and rains unbalanced, the hundred grains failing to ripen, the people stricken by plague, the land unsettled, armies mobilized for campaigns, or any manner of disasters and inauspicious omens—all must be reported to me.

Great merits shall be cultivated: transcribing scriptures and commissioning sacred images, establishing temples to deliver beings, and offering from the treasury precious treasures, jewels, gold, silver, pearls, coral, amber, palace gardens, silken banners, fields, gardens, and dwellings. These shall be dedicated as alms, sown into the field of the Three Treasures, to deliver sentient beings, rescue those in peril, release prisoners, establish fasts and precepts, arrange hundreds of high seats, and expound the profound and wondrous teachings of the Great Vehicle. Thus shall the people of the realm be exhorted to listen to the Dharma, practice almsgiving and repentance, and accumulate boundless, inconceivable merits of salvation and protection.

If the sovereign and ministers indulge in wrath, pursue depravity, slaughter without restraint, seek self-indulgence, and oppress all beings, bringing forth calamities upon the people—where sun and moon lose their brightness, baleful stars encroach upon the imperial throne, the land suffers floods and droughts, omens and locusts appear, the people rebel, and usurpers rise—then the sovereign and all under heaven must summon the Three Caverns’ Dharma Bodies and the assembly of the altar, countless in number, to fill sacred altars, temples, mountains, waters, grottoes, and holy sites. There, grand rituals shall be established, banners and canopies hung, flowers scattered, incense burned, lamps lit, the Dao practiced day and night, repentance offered without weariness, and the six periods observed with diligence. Treasures shall be widely dispensed to rescue all beings. Then, by my Dao-power, I shall manifest great divine transformations to assist in dispelling these disasters, causing the afflictions to dissolve at once.

If within the realm the Five Stars lose their proper course, dim luminaries stray, the Twenty-Eight Constellations deviate from their domains, sun and moon suffer eclipses, and yin and yang fall out of harmony, then the Southern Director of Destinies, Lord Han the Venerable, and the Controller of the Eight Directions of the Celestial Sphere, Sima the Longevous, shall regulate the celestial mechanism, restoring them to their rightful positions, and all calamitous omens shall be extinguished.

If great drought leaves the people parched and suffering, then the Dragon Kings shall shake thunder and summon torrential rains to end the drought’s hardship. If heavy rains pour unceasingly, floods surge to the heavens, and the people drown, then the Jade Maiden of the River, the Dark Lord of the Nine Seas, and the Officers of the True Qi shall gather the water-qi, part the clouds, and halt the rain, causing the waters to recede without harm. At this time, all dragon-spirits and ghosts shall likewise turn toward goodness.

If external demons, evil spirits, or malevolent ghosts—*chimei* and *wangliang*—enter the land to spread sickness and suffering, they shall be expelled together, allowed no respite. By the weight of my compassion and virtue, the imperial domain shall be eternally secured, the sovereign’s power ever renewed. The people shall ascend to the court of benevolence and longevity, the state placed within the realm of Huaxu. Yin and yang shall harmonize, sun and moon shine eternally, the seas and lands know peace, ministers and people enjoy well-being, the three frontiers remain tranquil, and the five grains flourish abundantly.

Yet, among the people of the world, though their wealth, status, and conditions differ, even if they cultivate the Dao, they may not discern the proper path. They may perform deeds yet remain beset by calamities, wavering in doubt, unable to attain clarity. They wonder: does the merit of salvation and protection vary in degree?

The Compassionate Honored One replied: Salvation and deliverance from distress depend upon utmost sincerity; the almsgiving of wealth is not measured by quantity. There are five kinds of merit:

First, the creation of my sacred images—true, responsive, and transformative manifestations. Blessings shall flow across kalpas, and retribution shall be boundless. Why? Because sentient beings, lost in delusion, cannot fix their minds. Beholding my true form, they generate devotion. With devotion arisen, true numen descends to meet them. Focused and unwavering, they attain the fruit of non-action.

Second, the transcription of scriptural teachings—the Great Vehicle of the Three Caverns. Blessings shall flow eternally, and merits shall be immeasurable. For scriptures guide the deluded, awakening boundless Dao-mind in beings, leading them from confusion to enlightenment, from enlightenment to truth. All sages who cultivate the Dao ascend to its fruition.

Third, the establishment of temples to deliver beings, the construction of halls and sanctuaries. The merit is boundless, inconceivable. Why?

Third, the deliverance of beings through monastic ordination and temple stewardship, the propagation of scriptures and icons to teach and transform sentient beings, inspiring them to awaken the Dao-mind—one realization opening myriad gates. Through the turning of karmic conditions, they aid the nation and transform the people, spreading the Dao and illuminating the Dharma, yielding the greatest benefit.

Fourth, the observance of purification rites and the practice of the Dao, the performance of repentance and the recitation of scriptures, the offering of praise and the burning of incense. The field of merit is boundless. Thus, purification rites cleanse the heart, the Dao enables penetrating insight, the practice of the Dao atones for transgressions, repentance invokes blessings, and the resonance of merit moves the heavens, dispelling calamities and bestowing fortune, upon which both life and death depend.

Fifth, the bestowal of all things in boundless fields of merit. The karmic retribution is towering, its merit profound and deep. Wealth and possessions are the lifeblood of sentient beings, clung to as if one’s own life, yet to relinquish them without hesitation, to give without stinginess, is to broadly establish merit, universally succoring sentient beings, inwardly stilling greed and avarice, outwardly eliminating plunder and theft. In life and death, they receive grace, and both humans and heavens reap the benefit.

These five Dharma-gates of merit-making are to be cultivated gradually according to one’s capacity, safeguarding the nation and securing the household, transcending rebirth and delivering from suffering. As the scriptures say, it is like a single sweet rain—all who receive it are nourished. According to their innate faculties, each attains flourishing growth. So too is the performance of repentance and the seeking of forgiveness.

Today, the assembly of this Dao-field, having heard the scriptural teachings, exhorts sentient beings to establish these inconceivable merits. The repentant one, so-and-so, from kalpas without beginning until this very kalpa and this present life, has never before encountered such merit or the analogies of these Dharma-gates. Today, prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text in ancestral veneration, they attain great awakening and understanding, bowing with utmost reverence, listening with single-minded devotion.

With bowed heads, they pay homage to the Merciful Venerable One, reverently saluting the true sages:
With devoted heart, they reverently salute the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy, Bestower of Fortune.
With devoted heart, they reverently salute the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.

With devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Rescues from Suffering.
With devoted heart, they reverently salute the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Eradicates Transgressions.

Today, the repentant one of this Dao-field, together with the great assembly, surrenders and takes refuge, reverently beseeching the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Heavenly Immortals, all the Immortals of the Great Grotto-Heavens, Earth Immortals, Water Immortals, Flying Immortals, Perfected Ones of Universal Salvation, Perfected Ones Who Rescue from Suffering, Youths Who Rescue from Suffering, and all true sages throughout the ten directions, the farthest reaches of the mysterious void, and all realms manifest and hidden.

May their vast and mysterious grace universally flow through the land. May the emperor’s reign be eternally prolonged, the beacon fires of war unlit, weapons stilled and sheathed, borders secured and frontiers guarded. May the imperial princes and heirs together strengthen the imperial enterprise, ministers and officials loyal and upright, assisting counselors and chancellors sharing the nation’s prosperity, jointly upholding the cosmos.

May heaven and earth be bright and pure, the celestial signs clear and mysterious, floods and droughts forever dispelled, locusts and pests never arise. May the three frontiers know perpetual peace, disasters and epidemics sink into obscurity, wind and rain arrive in season, harvests be abundant in years of plenty. May heaven bestow sweet dew, earth bring forth auspicious clouds, the nation prosper with worthy ministers, households abound with filial piety and fraternal duty.

Next, may the prisons of Mount Luofeng, the eight difficulties and nine dark realms, cease their torments, and the suffering souls forever escape the three evil destinies.

The repentant one, so-and-so, from kalpas without beginning until this present kalpa and life, together with nine generations of ancestors, parents, and all kin, by the power of this repentance and merit, may all attain liberation and return to the true Dao.

One bow.

**Second Scroll: The Salvation of the People**

Today, in this grand Daoist sanctuary, all present turn their minds upward, gazing toward the Merciful Honored One, to broadly save the people and expound all virtuous benefits.

The repentant one, so-and-so, gathers their thoughts, joins their hands, and listens attentively to the scriptural words, ever mindful of sentient beings dwelling in an age of the three poisons and ten evils, beset by specters and malevolent spirits, wicked ghosts and wayward deities, venomous creatures and fierce beasts, blades and warfare, flood and fire, fetters and prisons, sickness and suffering—each affliction clinging fast, leaving none at peace.

Thus are the Three Caverns’ scriptures and precepts expounded, the rites of deliverance and purification performed, to universally ferry all beings across. Talismans, sacred diagrams, and divine incantations are entrusted to those who study the Dao, along with the Heavenly Emperors, the Saviors of Suffering Perfected Ones, the Three Great Demon Kings of Heaven, and the Five Demon Kings of Heaven, who spread throughout the world to rescue and protect all, granting them freedom.

Yet sentient beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize sin and blessing. They indulge the six senses, killing and stealing, engaging in debauchery and dissipation, stinginess and wrath, their natures inverted. They speak deceitfully, utter falsehoods, slander with harsh words and divisive tongues, devour living beings, break fasts and violate precepts, defy heaven and betray earth, turn from the true and embrace the perverse, curse gods and spirits—sins rampant, with not a shred of goodness.

Thus do poisonous winds and malignant qi, the demonic hordes of the Six Heavens, fill the world, spreading slaughter and strife. Those struck down and wounded number in the tens of thousands each day, beyond all reckoning.

The Merciful Honored One dispatches the Heavenly Emperors, the Ten Ultimate Divine Kings, and the Four Administrators of the Three Realms to descend into the human realm, traversing and rescuing, delivering sentient beings, filling heaven and earth—yet who among them knows this?

Now I solemnly declare to you: the methods of salvation are inconceivable, their spiritual responses swift. In universal deliverance, I proclaim with great compassion and mercy, entreating the Honored One to bestow these teachings.

The Merciful Honored One says: On the first day of the year, the eight solar terms, the Three Primes, the dark and full moons, the Five La Days, and the Ten Straight Days—on all such occasions, good men and faithful women who observe these days must abstain from meat and impurity, restrain the six senses, and banish all wayward thoughts. Thus purified, they burn incense, maintain the fast, recite the Dao, and pay homage to my transformed names.

First, they repent for their own transgressions, openly confessing their faults, thereby transferring merit to amend their errors and escape suffering and calamity. If one cannot focus alone, they may invoke the Dharma-bodies of male or female officiants, praying earnestly with devotion, making offerings and prostrations.

Whether at home or in sacred temples, with flowers, fruits, vegetarian meals, banners, blossoms, incense, lamps, and offerings of clothing, bedding, curtains, embroidered mats, fragrant oils, rice, and flour—whatever they possess—then the benevolent spirits will descend at once, delivering them from misfortune.

If one suffers from grave illness, chronic ailments, or the malevolent influence of the Ox Mansion, lingering for years without relief, their vitality drained, their wealth dissipated; if childbirth brings misfortune, or infants perish in their arms; if one leaves the household to become a monastic, only to later regret it; if nightmares and strange visions disturb the mind, or fires and alarms cause terror; if legal troubles arise unjustly, or one violates sacred prohibitions, defies divine retribution, disturbs graves, or is struck by flood, fire, entangling trees, or crushing stones—all manner of calamities, omens, and afflictions—then within the home, perform extensive rites of repentance and supplication. According to one’s means, pay homage to my transformed names, kindle lamps and burn incense day and night without cease. The Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings will descend to protect my transformed names.

The exorcised will be subdued, the sought will be granted, the presented will be conveyed, the entreated will be heeded. Transgressions will be redeemed, the living and the dead will be saved. This form of prayer and exorcism is foremost.

If emperors, kings, great ministers, and royal advisors, along with princes, consorts, imperial children, and celestial descendants, act on behalf of their parents, themselves, their kin, court relatives, and imperial kin, summoning the Dharma-bodies of male and female officiants—regardless of number—to their palaces, where they maintain the fast, practice the Dao, and perform repentance day and night without pause, their devotion unwavering, then the Ten Perfected Ones of Heaven and the Four Administrators and Five Emperors will descend to assess their merits and faults. The sick will recover, the dead will revive, the imperiled will be delivered, the imprisoned will be freed, travelers will return, and officials will be promoted. Water, fire, blades, warfare, tigers, wolves, venomous beasts, malevolent spirits, and spectral entities will never assail them, nor will they suffer harm or offense.

If common folk act on behalf of emperors, kings, the people, the land, and all sentient beings, paying homage to my transformed names and true images, delivering all beings, each will attain peace and bliss—this is most inconceivable.

If warfare erupts on all four fronts, encroaching upon borders, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the weapons of war will retreat, leaving no harm or damage.

If plague and pestilence strike the people, and exorcisms bring no relief, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the afflicted will recover, free from lingering illness.

If floods and droughts disrupt the seasons, and the five grains fail to ripen, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the elements will harmonize, all things flourishing.

If poisonous winds and malignant qi scorch the people, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the afflictions will vanish at once, the body and qi restored to tranquility.

If venomous creatures and fierce beasts ravage the people and all living beings, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and the insects and tigers will flee, the mountain spirits concealing them.

If a woman is pregnant and childbirth brings peril, pay homage to my transformed names and true images, and mother and child will be reunited, free from danger.

Ten thousand disasters will vanish, a thousand transformations and myriad changes will cease. Turn to me, to my transformed names, who broadly protect all sentient beings—no wish will go unfulfilled. With sincere devotion, no peril will remain unaverted.

Today, in this grand Daoist sanctuary, all present must turn their minds as the scriptures instruct, with utmost devotion, paying homage to all transformed names and manifestations.

May these merits and virtues broadly deliver all sentient beings, universally ferry them across to liberation. The repentant sponsor, so-and-so, has dwelt in the world since time immemorial, sunk in the depths of sin and suffering, yet to attain liberation. Today, prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, they cast themselves to the ground with utmost reverence, wholeheartedly invoking the names. Bowing their head to the Merciful Venerable One, they pay homage to the true sages:

With devoted heart, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity who bestows blessings.
With devoted heart, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy who rescues from suffering at the sound of distress.

With devoted heart, they pay homage to the Perfected One of Jade Radiance.
With devoted heart, they pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion who rescues from suffering.
With devoted heart, they pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Mercy who absolves sins.

Today, the patrons of this Daoist sanctuary, together with the great assembly, bow their heads in reverence and take refuge, gazing upward in hope that the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, all the venerable ones and sages, all the great flying immortals, celestial immortals, terrestrial immortals, aquatic immortals, all the great perfected ones, all the great youths, and all the transformed true images and sacred manifestations throughout the ten directions and the boundless reaches of the Mystic Void, will together extend their vast grace, propagate the Mystic Wind, pervade the world, universally succor the multitudes, dispel disasters, and bestow blessings.

May the repentant sponsor, so-and-so, by the power of this Dao, see exorcised what is to be exorcised, preserved what is to be preserved, healed what is ailing, turned auspicious what is dire, liberated the recently deceased, reborn in heaven the long departed, and all sunken and lingering souls ascend through the wheel of karma. May all sentient beings be delivered and saved, depart from the source of suffering, and together ascend the shore of the Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Three: Unbinding the Knots of Sentient Beings**

Today, within this sacred precinct, all assembled turn their minds in reverence toward the Merciful Honored One, the Boundless Dao, and all true sages, that for the sake of sentient beings, they may untie all knots and fetters.

The repentant sponsor, so-and-so, with purified body and mind, bows in profound devotion. As the scriptures declare: In the beginning, the Primordial One transformed the Three Realms with a single qi. Heaven and earth move, and the myriad things take form; humanity dwells within, receiving its nature and nurturing its form, all born of this transformation. Externally, it draws upon refined qi; internally and externally, the five virtues intermingle to take shape. Sentient beings, enveloped within, emerge from the womb after ten months, encircled by the ten qi. As qi circulates and gives life, the hundred joints unfold. Within each joint, qi forms ten knots, and within each knot resides a spirit. Habitual patterns intertwine, and transgressions coil into bonds.

To untie these knots and harmonize the hundred spirits, the ten directions are established, each bearing countless names. Each invoked name has the power to unbind the knots of sentient beings. If the knots of sentient beings are dissolved, they deeply awaken to the source of the Dao—much like in the worldly realm, where capturing a thief requires summoning a thousand soldiers, yet once the thief is seized, not a single soldier is needed.

Moreover, the body of sentient beings is a temporary convergence of earth, water, fire, and wind, of yin and yang, manifest and hidden, all arising from the mutual contamination of the five viscera and six senses. The mind-king and the will-steed sow and cultivate: knots of doubt and delusion, knots of entanglement and obstruction, knots of injury and harm, knots of illness and affliction, knots of slander and strife, knots of enmity and grievance, knots of chronic ailment, knots of muteness and silence, knots of frivolity and play, knots of trade and exchange, knots of wine and gluttony, knots of killing and harm, knots of scalding and fire, knots of jealousy and envy, knots of false speech, knots of frivolity and disdain, knots of greed and desire, knots of reckless bravery, knots of breaking fasts, knots of violating precepts, knots of idle amusement, knots of mental exhaustion, knots of accumulated resentment, knots of shamelessness, knots of lust and desire, knots of deafness, knots of blindness, knots of mental confusion, knots of anger and rage, knots of heavenly nets, knots of earthly snares, knots of water and fire, knots of the bridal chamber, knots of mutual conflict, knots of mutual hindrance.

All such sentient beings, dwelling within heaven and earth, experience the flourishing and withering of form. The burning house seethes unceasingly; floating life is ever restless. With all these vexing knots obstructing and tormenting the fleshly body, knot upon knot intertwines without end.

Pǔjì inquired: What is meant by the mind-king and the will-steed?

The Merciful Honored One replied: The mind is like a sovereign king; the will is like a monkey or a horse—difficult to tame, difficult to subdue, ever-shifting and unceasing. Even if the monkey and horse are stilled, the mind-king does not rest. If one skillfully subdues the sovereign king, the will-steed cannot shift and turn. Once shifting and turning cease, karmic knots no longer arise.

Pǔjì inquired: By what virtuous power may sentient beings be taught to awaken and dissolve these knots?

The Merciful Honored One replied: If sentient beings seek awakening and dissolution, let them, in a place of purity, adorn and purify their homes. According to their means, whether abundant or modest, let them light incense and lamps before my image, venerate the transformed names, repent of grievances and knots, listen attentively, contemplate deeply, and advance with courage and diligence. Thus may they awaken and dissolve all knots, avoiding the depths of suffering.

By the power of this repentance, let there descend the hundredfold-refined vajra, the thousandfold-blended jade elixir, the flowing light of Venus, the dispersed radiance of primal yellow. Let these wash away lewdness and perversity, dissolve grievances and knots, dispel vexation and torment, pacify body and mind. Let goodness and evil naturally align, and malevolence be ground away. May the Four Brahma Perfected Ones and the transformative lords of the ten directions enable all sentient beings to awaken. Let evil karma not arise, and let goodness deepen, that they may attain rebirth—how could they not be delivered?

Furthermore, if sentient beings skillfully dissolve even a single knot, a hundred knots will loosen. They will ascend in pure qi and descend with heavenly talismans. The fierce generals Axiū, Iron-Forehead, and Copper-Headed Dharma-Protecting Divine Kings, with jade hooks and golden locks, will instantly still the thousand knots and myriad resentments, quieting the mind-monkey. Like an orange or a pearl, the will’s knots will forever cease. The mind will be without mind, and knots without knots. Enmity and hatred will be resolved, nets and snares dissolved.

May all sentient beings forever awaken to the true Dao and attain liberation.

Today, within this sacred precinct, all assembled turn their minds to listen attentively, as the scriptures declare: Sentient beings in the world are forever bound by the cage of affliction, with no means of escape—where can they flee? By venerating this repentance ritual, they may suddenly awaken from their entanglements. Now, let them contemplate deeply and advance in reverent devotion.

May the power of virtue extend to all sentient beings, that all the knots they bear may, by the power of repentance, awaken to non-action and ascend to the true Dao.

The repentant sponsor, so-and-so, further reflects: Dwelling in the floating world, one daily accumulates evil qi. The body bears the three karmic actions; the mouth commits the four transgressions. Karmic roots intertwine, and knots gather, difficult to cast off. Today, let the body be refined and purified, the dust of defilement washed away.

Today, prostrating for peace and offering prayers through this repentance text, with the five limbs touching the earth and the mind single-mindedly devoted, the repentant sponsor bows to the Merciful Honored One and reverently venerates the true sages.

With sincere devotion, reverently venerate the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy who bestows blessings.

Today, the master of repentance in this Daoist ritual, together with the great assembly, prostrate in utmost sincerity, gazing upward in hope that the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, all the Venerables and Sages, all the Great Transformative Titles, all the Great Manifestations, all the Great Divine Immortals, all the Great Assemblies of Sages, all the Great Divine Youths, and all the Worthies and Sages throughout the ten directions and the boundless reaches of the Mysterious Void—all the Perfected and Sages—may, through the might of the Vajra Guardians and the waters of Supreme Harmony, cleanse the accumulated defilements within the body of the repentance master, named so-and-so, purifying the field of the heart-mind. May obstructions dissolve, the flow of nourishing and protective qi circulate, and all share a purified heart-mind, continuously cultivating goodness without generating defiled thoughts or stirring afflictive toil.

Today, this Daoist ritual is conducted with purity as its purpose. May the ancestral spirits, the consciousness of departed kin, parents, and family members swiftly escape karmic entanglements, never to sink into suffering. May the living and the deceased of two generations together ascend to the fruition of the Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Four: Arousing the Heart of Praise**

Today, in this Daoist ritual, each member of the great assembly directs their heart-mind upward, gazing toward the Compassionate Venerable One, exhorting all beings to arise in praise.

The repentance master, named so-and-so, gathers their heart-mind, kneels in reverence, and listens attentively to the scriptural words: No one receives birth without arising from past karma. Thus, each is endowed with a divine and outstanding nature, each with its own karmic conditions. Transgressions and blessings, fortune and misfortune—all proceed from karma. Therefore, short or long lifespans, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty, beauty or ugliness, foolishness or wisdom—each differs according to prior determination. If one knows they have committed the three karmic actions or the ten evils, their transgressions are grave and weighty. They should awaken to remorse, seek repentance, and perform rites of contrition. Let boundless thoughts arise from an immeasurable heart-mind. Whenever encountering good conditions, one must offer praise. The merit of praise is inconceivable.

If one sees the emperor, sovereign, empress, imperial consorts, princes, princesses, ministers, and high officials arouse a heart of great goodness, one must offer praise, wishing that blessings protect the realm and the imperial enterprise endure forever.

If one sees the construction of palaces or the establishment of vast Daoist altars, one must offer praise, wishing for swift completion and the attainment of refuge.

If one sees the imperial grace bestowing ordination upon male and female officials and Daoists, one must offer praise, wishing for liberation from suffering and purity across three lifetimes.

If one sees the adornment and casting of sacred images, the true responsive and transformative bodies, one must offer praise, arousing a heart of reverence and making offerings without cease.

If one sees the transcription of the Three Caverns’ Great Canon of sacred scriptures, one must offer praise, wishing for eternal circulation and the transformation and deliverance of all.

If one sees halls, pavilions, towers, and terraces adorned with splendor and elegance, one must offer praise, wishing that all may attain refuge and constantly behold and revere them.

If one sees bells, chimes, and Daoist implements of bronze and iron, one must offer praise, wishing to awaken the deluded masses and make their voices heard in the darkest nights.

If one sees the expounding of various scriptures and the elucidation of wondrous meanings, one must offer praise, wishing to ride the merit to liberate those imprisoned in suffering.

If one sees the recitation of scriptures and repentance texts, their upholding, and the making of offerings, one must offer praise, wishing to attain the conditions for the Dao and remain steadfast without retreat.

If one sees the performance of ritual circumambulation, hymns of praise, prayers for blessings, and petitions for fortune, one must offer praise, wishing that the power of blessings universally pervade worlds as numerous as motes of dust.

If one sees men and women burning incense, lighting lamps, and diligently prostrating in reverence, one must offer praise, wishing their prayers be fulfilled.

If one sees the burning of incense, one must offer praise, universally wishing that the fragrant smoke be offered to all Perfected and Sages.

If one sees the illumination of lamps dispelling darkness, one must offer praise, wishing that karmic debts be forever dissolved and all attain equality with the sun and moon.

If one sees the observance of fasts, the upholding of precepts, and the making of offerings to the Perfected and Sages, one must offer praise, wishing that all sentient beings in the world, all creatures with consciousness, forever enter the Dharma gate and never sink into the realms of suffering.

If one sees the making of offerings to humans and gods, one must offer praise, wishing for towering blessings and longevity, and inexhaustible wealth and fortune.

If one sees diligent devotion, thought after thought of utmost sincerity, one must offer praise, wishing for no retreat and constant joy.

If one sees courageous reverence and the arousal of a heart of great goodness, one must offer praise, wishing to avoid encountering demonic obstacles and swiftly attain the true Dao.

If one sees those who dwell at home constantly reciting scriptures and repentance texts, one must offer praise, wishing that all heavenly Perfected may hear and behold them.

If one sees those who dwell in mountains to cultivate the Dao, residing in hermitages and cliffs, guarding their resolve in tranquility, seeking neither fame nor profit, one must offer praise, wishing that those who first attain the Dao may sequentially open the path to deliverance for others.

If one sees men and women of upright bearing, one must offer praise, universally wishing that they leave the household life and perpetuate the true teaching.

If one sees all good conditions in the world, one must offer praise, wishing that humans and gods attain fruition and all receive benefit.

Through such manifold praises of good deeds, exhort and inspire all beings to accomplish the heart-mind of the Dao and enter diligent practice. Thus may the nine generations of ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, one’s own parents, uncles, brothers, oneself, one’s descendants, and all family members—from beginningless kalpas to the present kalpa, in this life and this birth, through the accumulated actions of today—all the heavy transgressions of the three karmic actions, the six sense faculties, the five rebellious acts, and the ten evils be completely dissolved.

Today, the great assembly of this Dao ritual, as proclaimed in the scriptures, must recognize that the power of praising goodness is inconceivable. We must diligently advance, widely offering praise, wishing that this merit universally extend to all sentient beings. The repentance master, so-and-so, prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text in memorial rites, bowing with five limbs to the ground, single-mindedly invoking and reverently saluting the Merciful Honored One and the true sages.

May they, by the power of the great Dao, the power of non-action, the power of merit, and the power of the inconceivable, enable the repentance master, so-and-so, from beginningless kalpas to the present kalpa, in this life and this day, along with the nine generations of ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, teachers, parents, uncles, brothers, oneself, and all family members—both the living and the deceased—who may have encountered various good conditions but failed to offer praise, to have all their transgressions dissolved through this act of repentance.

From this day forward, may we ourselves, upon hearing or seeing any good conditions, rejoice and leap with joy, redoubling our praise, encouraging diligent cultivation, and aspiring to accomplish the universal salvation of all beings. May our nine generations of ancestral spirits, our parents of this life, our teachers and Dharma companions, our fellow practitioners and kin, our uncles, brothers, and all family members—those who have passed away—be freed from karmic obstructions and forever severed from afflictions. May the power of this repentance extend universally, adorning and pacifying the realm, bringing peace to the borders, and even enabling those in hells, hungry ghost realms, and animal existences to equally rely on this profound grace and attain the shore of the Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter One: Manifesting Merit and Receiving Blessings**

Today, the great assembly of this Dao ritual, each directing their mind, respectfully addresses the Merciful Honored One, declaring their merits to receive blessings. The repentance master, so-and-so, joins palms, kneels, and listens attentively to the scriptural teachings.

The Universal Salvation inquires: The various Dharma gates of merit manifested by the Merciful Honored One exhort and instruct sentient beings to cultivate practice. Yet beings are weak and feeble, unable to fully accomplish these; we wonder what levels of merit may be attained through cultivation.

The Merciful Honored One says: Merit is boundless, but broadly speaking, there are nine types, each yielding blessings according to one’s capacity. All beings should listen carefully:

1. Creating images
2. Copying scriptures
3. Establishing temples
4. Liberating beings
5. Conducting Dao rituals
6. Reciting scriptures and performing repentance rites
7. Upholding precepts
8. Universally offering vegetarian feasts and provisions
9. Practicing generosity

Whether constructing halls, pavilions, towers, galleries, permanent estates, banners, flowers, lamps, candles, bells, chimes, cymbals, or other ritual implements—all such endeavors accumulate boundless merit, bringing immeasurable blessings in the past, present, and future, beyond conception.

Those who create images or copy scriptures will, in this life, attain noble status and, in past lives, be reborn in the families of heavenly kings. Those who establish temples and liberate beings will, in this life, attain great wealth and, in past lives, be reborn in the families of kings. Those who perform rituals and recite invocations will, in this life, be protected by benevolent spirits and, in past lives, be reborn with keen intelligence. Those who uphold vegetarian precepts, revere the teachings, and burn incense will, in this life, enjoy enduring peace and, in past lives, be reborn in wealthy and noble families. Those who observe precepts and repent will, in this life, be revered and protected by the gods and, in past lives, be reborn among humans with perfect form and appearance. Those who offer scriptures and images will, in this life, receive good karmic retribution and, in past lives, be reborn with handsome features. Those who offer vegetarian feasts and provisions will, in this life, have abundant clothing and food and, in past lives, be reborn with dignified bearing. Those who give alms to the poor will, in this life, attain radiant perfection and, in past lives, be reborn with auspicious marks.

Those who refrain from consuming living beings will, in this life, enjoy freedom from illness and suffering and, in past lives, attain a long-lived body. Those who abstain from wine and meat will, in this life, have spirits that abide in their bodies and, in past lives, be reborn with the bodies of sages and worthies. Those who are free from craving and content with little will, in this life, have bodies free from foul odors and, in past lives, be reborn with pure bodies. Those who release life and ransom creatures will, in this life, be spared from premature death and, in past lives, be reborn with reverent bodies. Those who expound the teachings and transform others will, in this life, attain the dual cultivation of blessings and wisdom and, in past lives, be reborn with the bodies of renunciates.

Moreover, the retribution of meritorious deeds is like an echo responding to sound, like a shadow following form—no difference in magnitude, purity and turbidity naturally distinct. Yet you, in your ignorance and delusion, fail to recognize causes and conditions, disbelieve in the consequences of sin and merit, and do not understand that this body arises from the seeds of past blessings. You do not know that this body is but a fleeting apparition, that it is utterly illusory, that it is momentary and impermanent. Instead, you indulge in stinginess and greed, killing living beings, stealing, engaging in illicit sex and dissipation, consuming living creatures, uttering deceitful and frivolous speech, slandering the scriptures and teachings, amassing wealth—all the while believing this life has no limit.

Consider all beings: with eyes open, they commit countless sins; with eyes closed, they enter the prison of suffering. A lifetime of transgressions—when have they ever awakened? They cannot arouse a single thought of goodness to disperse the karmic deeds that bind them to past and future rebirths. Though they seek to liberate themselves, they plant the seeds of affliction, yet fret over their descendants, lamenting their lack of sustenance. I grieve for worldly people, who weep at the moment of death, yet from youth are consumed by worry for their sons and daughters, never recalling the kindness of their parents’ nurture. From time without beginning, they have imitated one another, never awakening, ever sinking deeper into ignorance.

I reflect further on all of you, who follow one another in folly, never self-aware. Thus I reveal the karmic causes and conditions of past lives, that you may emerge from the river of suffering and desire. I also lament that sentient beings drift and drown, never escaping the sea of suffering. This world is called the "Realm of Abandoned Worthies and Profit-Seeking," also known as the "Realm of Mixed Retribution." The heavens of desire and attachment arise within it, fleeting as lightning—appearing for a moment, then vanishing; briefly gathering, then scattering. Birth, aging, sickness, death; pain, itching, soreness, aching; hunger, cold, dryness, dampness; water, fire, blades, weapons; demonic spirits, thieves, poisonous winds, malignant diseases—all these afflictions intertwine, moment by moment impermanent, never abiding for even an instant. How much suffering! Yet even as these torments bind you in the present, you remain unaware—how then could you believe in the celestial realms, the blessed lands of immortals, the Dao of eternal life, and the freedom of non-action?

I observe that the lives of worldly beings are shorter than those of mayflies; their dwellings more cramped than a hair’s tip; their foulness more vile than excrement; their pleasures no different from those of dung-beetles. Yet they remain oblivious, mistaking this for happiness—is this not suffering? I further reflect that no one is born without prior karma. Thus, when examining the essence of spirit and form, each has its causes and conditions. Sin and merit, fortune and misfortune—all arise from karma. Therefore, longevity or premature death, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty, beauty or ugliness, foolishness or wisdom—each differs according to its kind, even among birds, beasts, insects, fish, chickens, dogs, grasses, and trees. How much more so for human birth, which is so rarely encountered! Once this body decays, when will it be regained after ten thousand kalpas?

Thus I earnestly admonish and exhort you: diligently cultivate precepts, fast, practice the Dao, recite scriptures, prostrate in worship, burn incense, light lamps, give alms, and repent. Vow to deliver the living and liberate the dead; create images and copy scriptures; establish temples and build bridges; dig wells by the roadside to aid travelers and relieve the thirsty. Through countless expedient means, pave the path for all beings in the future. What do I seek in this? All sentient beings should reflect deeply.

Today, in this grand assembly, as the scriptures teach and the Dharma reveals—whether in full or in part, beyond comprehension—we earnestly establish the foundation of blessings for ourselves and others, creating the path for the future. Now, as I bow in reverence and recite, let each of you be diligent. May these merits benefit all without limit, and may every sentient being receive their nourishment.

The repentance master [Name], prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, prays that these merits respond to the heart’s aspirations. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, I vow:

With utmost reverence, I bow to the Compassionate Venerable One.
With sincere devotion, I bow to the Jade Clarity Bestower of Blessings, Heavenly Worthy.

Today, the master of repentance in this Daoist ritual, together with the great assembly, reverently beseech the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy below, all the Venerable Ones and Sages, all the Great Heavenly Immortals, all the Great Earthly Immortals, the Immortal Hosts of the Five Sacred Peaks, all the Great Perfected Lords, all the Great Perfected Ones, and all the Divine Youths—pervading the ten directions, filling the realms of profound emptiness, and manifesting under every name as all the true and sacred beings. May they together bestow their responsive grace to rescue and protect all beings. May the master of repentance, so-and-so, who undertakes this matter, obtain a response in accordance with their heart, all through the power of this repentance.

May the afflicted recover from illness, may calamities be averted, may those who have passed afar be reborn, may those who have recently departed attain liberation, may the living receive benefit, and may all their prayers be fulfilled. Furthermore, may the four kinds of birth and the six paths of existence all receive this grace; may the spirits of plants and trees, and the lingering souls of the forsaken, seize this auspicious opportunity to ascend together to the Great Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Two: Repaying Kindness and Offering Merit**

Today, in this Daoist ritual, each member of the great assembly directs their heart and mind, reverently beseeching the Merciful Venerable One to universally bestow boundless merit and virtue upon all people. Now, the causes and effects of repaying kindness are expounded.

The master of repentance, so-and-so, humbly reflects and listens attentively to the scriptural words: When a person is born, Heaven and Earth serve as their model; they bear the yin and embrace the yang, receiving shelter within the womb, their life suspended by Heaven. The Heavenly Emperor then summons the Youth Who Records Lifespans to traverse the human realm, examining and measuring sins and blessings, the fortune or misfortune of men and women, the brevity or length of their lives. Every three days, a report is made; every seven days, a memorial is submitted; every hundred days, a record is finalized—unceasing even for a moment.

If one cultivates goodness and establishes merit, the Divine Youths of the Heavens, the Lords of Life and the Recorders of Deeds, will extend their years and eliminate calamities. If one commits sins and accumulates evil, the Heavenly Kings and the demonic spirits of the Six Heavens will seize their hun and po souls, bringing them before the Three Officials to have their consciousnesses collected. If one’s allotted lifespan is not fulfilled, it is due to the sins they have committed; if one completes their allotted lifespan, it is due to the goodness they have accumulated.

When a person seeks to extend their lifespan, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Earthly Offices. The various Heavens and Emperors examine and verify according to the registers, determining life and death. They then dispatch the officials of the Three Realms and the Youth Who Observes Life to gather the spirit and soul, cutting off the breath of life. If a person is afflicted by prolonged illness, bedridden and gravely stricken, their life nearing its end, and if their family and kin, according to their means, establish a Daoist ritual, recite scriptures, and perform repentance—regardless of the number of scrolls—the family and kin may reverently face the various Heavens and Sages, confessing the karmic offenses of the sick person’s embodied existence, thereby releasing their spirit and soul, extending their lifespan, and restoring them to health.

If the great limit of life is imminent, one may still be rescued through the performance of extensive merit and virtue, dedicating it to the departed soul to spare them from suffering and distress. The living will face no hardship or terror. From the first seventh-day period after death to the three annual commemorations, during the days of ancestral remembrance, offerings of incense and lamps should be made tirelessly, day and night.

Why is this so? There are also the Youths Who Observe Life who monitor and report sins and blessings. If one enters the gate of life, blessings flow to their descendants, they do not linger in hell, and they suffer no karmic retribution. It is like a person initially entangled in a legal dispute, where the case remains unresolved—this is analogous to the situation of the newly deceased.

Thus, two spirits, one of good and one of evil, descend every ten days to inspect the household. For those who perform merit, the good spirit will advocate for them, enabling rebirth in Heaven. For those who do not perform merit, the evil spirit will record their deeds, leading them into confinement, causing their family to experience much fear and misfortune. If there is suffering, one may go to a Daoist abbey or remain at home, facing the image of the Venerable One, bowing to the manifest and hidden transformations, performing purification rituals and practicing the Dao, redeeming karmic offenses to attain liberation. Their names will be inscribed in the registers of immortals, and their bodies will dwell in carefree joy.

Such are the various causes and effects of repaying kindness and offering merit, which are foremost and truly worthy of praise. If there are good men and good women who, for the sake of their parents and all their kin, paint or sculpt images, construct halls, and vow with sincere faith to widely encourage and exhort others—such actions are inconceivable. All people, within the various dharmas, who arouse a single good thought or make a single vow, harboring a heart of gratitude and repayment, are called good fruits, and are inconceivable.

Today, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, as spoken in the scriptures, reverently beseech the Merciful Venerable One to expound this Dharma gate of merit and virtue for all sentient beings, serving as a path through life and death—this is inconceivable. The master of repentance, so-and-so, for the sake of their nine generations of ancestors, seven generations of forebears, parents, uncles, brothers, themselves, and all their kin—whether in hell, as hungry ghosts, as animals, or among all beings with consciousness—who have not yet received offerings or performed repayment, now wholeheartedly bows in reverence to the true and sacred beings invoked by name. May this merit and virtue pervade both the living and the deceased, enabling all to attain liberation.

Today, humbly for the sake of peace and the offering of merit through this repentance text, prostrating with the five limbs touching the ground, the heart directs its thoughts. Bowing to the Merciful Venerable One, I reverently bow to the true and sacred beings.

With sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity Who Bestows Blessings.
With sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries.
With sincere devotion, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign and Mysterious Spirit.

Today, the master of repentance in this Daoist ritual, along with the great assembly, take refuge in the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, all the Venerable Ones and Sages, all the Great Perfected, all the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, all the Great Divine Youths, who pervade the ten directions, fill the boundless void, and manifest throughout all realms. May they, by the power of great compassion, the power of great mercy, the power of the Dao, and the power of the Dharma, universally illuminate the worlds below, the Nine Dark Prisons of Fengdu. May the master of repentance, [Name], their nine generations of ancestors, seven generations of descendants, teachers, parents, uncles, brothers, themselves, and all their kin—whether dwelling in the Three Evil Paths, yet to attain liberation, whether departed long ago or recently passed—all ascend today through sincere repentance. Regardless of the weight of their transgressions, may they together attain liberation and take refuge in the Great Dao.

One bow.

**Chapter Three: The Circulation of Teachings**

Today, the great assembly in this Daoist ritual, each with focused mind, take refuge and repent, gazing reverently upon the Compassionate Venerable One, to expound the teachings of salvation and the circulation of all dharmas.

The master of repentance, [Name], collects their thoughts and listens attentively as the scriptures are revealed: The Primordial Beginning, with one qi, transformed into three qi, dividing into the Three Heavens. The realms of the Three Clarities emerged from the Three Caverns’ treasure scriptures. Thus, the Three Vehicles conjoined the soaring mystery of qi, naturally forming chapters—jade characters and golden writings, dragon scripts and phoenix seals—each a great square of one zhang, with eight corners radiating light. They taught the heavens and circulated through the worlds, turning the Dharma Wheel for five kalpas from beginning to end.

Though heaven and earth may end their course, the Three Caverns shall never perish. They open the path for all beings, guiding humans and gods across the Three Realms and ten directions, all receiving benefit.

It is asked: When did the Three Caverns descend to the world? Did they come simultaneously, or in succession?

The Compassionate Venerable One replied: At the beginning of each kalpa, the Cavern of Perfection descends to transform the world. People embraced virtue and power, dwelling in emptiness and non-being. All upheld the true and correct, attaining long life without death. Next, the Cavern of Mystery descended. The great simplicity had already declined, the pure wind had scattered, and people gradually became frivolous, losing the Dao and rebelling against virtue. Then, the Cavern of Spirit descended. People grew even more frivolous, failing to uphold the great teachings, turning from truth toward falsehood, their lifespans shortening. When the Three Caverns ceased to function, worldly wisdom flourished daily. Humans and ghosts intermingled, the kalpa’s end drew near, lifespans fell below a hundred years, impermanence prevailed in every thought, and ruin never ceased.

I have descended again to proclaim the Three Caverns, spreading transformation among humanity, adapting to the capacities of each era, and propagating the scriptural teachings. Moreover, the Sacred Ancestors have manifested in the human realm to save and deliver sentient beings, expounding precepts and regulations. Whether among the Yi or Xia, whether sages or commoners, they pervaded the ten directions, universally enabling liberation. The wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns, scattered throughout the world, exhorts sentient beings to diligently cultivate and practice.

Those who accumulate transgressions and karmic burdens, sinking into evil paths, unable to believe and uphold the teachings, follow only falsehoods and various deceptive spirits. They exhaust body and mind, only to descend into hell. Those who believe in and uphold the great Dharma of the Three Caverns shall all enter the Hall of Blessings. Some ascend in broad daylight, others escape through corpse liberation, their forms vanishing into hidden realms. Though their names and traces remain, they secretly traverse the unseen worlds, unknown to others.

Furthermore, it is said: After I withdraw, demonic teachings will flourish. People will die young, wars, floods, and fires will follow one after another, diseases will linger, and suffering will persist day and night. Wealth and treasures will be exhausted in service to deceitful spirits, falsehoods will multiply daily, and the frivolous and deceitful will spread with the times. Hunger, cold, and misery will drive fathers and sons to wander, never awakening.

Again, I reflect upon you all, sunk in the depths of kalpas: I speak these essential words to enlighten the deaf and blind.

Moreover, the scriptures teach sentient beings to recognize the root and origin, the causes of past lives, the retribution of sin and blessing, the auspicious and inauspicious, the gates of life and death, and the means of expedient practice. They urge turning from evil to embrace goodness, preserving life and nature, attaining long life and non-action, and taking refuge in the Great Dao. Those who preserve them shall receive blessings; those who cultivate them shall be divinely protected.

Thus, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, divine beings, and immortals of the heavens always desire that people diligently burn incense and repent, so that benevolent spirits will protect them and the multitude of sages will bestow their thoughts. If one bears transgressions, bound internally and externally, malevolent spirits will wreak havoc, diseases will afflict, and disasters—water, fire, blades, poisonous creatures, fierce beasts, shackles, and prisons—will bring inescapable suffering.

If one only adorns the exterior—face, clothing, hands, and feet—yet fails to inwardly cleanse the body, mind, roots of transgression, and evil karma, are they not foolish and deluded? Just as the face, hands, feet, and clothing, when diligently washed and scrubbed, must become pure.

The Supreme Pole Perfected One spoke: When the Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Accumulation World of the Heaven of Blessed Virtue, expounding the Dao amidst the assembly of celestial immortals, he thought of the Universally Beneficent Perfected One, who arose with fearless power and extended his mind of vast compassion. For the sake of all sentient beings, he inquired about karmic conditions and proclaimed the responsive titles of the various Honored Ones.

At that moment, the earth turned to the hue of refined gold, and the heavens rained down precious flowers, fragrant incense, and wondrous treasures, all drifting through the void to fill the space before the Dao, beyond count. "All you sentient beings, you ought to believe and uphold this, exert yourselves with sincere devotion, propagate my teachings, and not allow external demons to disrupt and disturb the realm."

When the Universally Beneficent Perfected One and the assembly of celestial beings heard these words, they wept in longing and admiration, choked with sorrow, as if they had lost their parents. They vowed that the Merciful Honored One would constantly admonish and instruct them, so that they might awaken and realize the supreme Dao.

Thereupon, the Universally Beneficent addressed the assembly of celestial immortals and sages: "In the cities, towns, villages, and tranquil mountain forests of the lands in the ten directions, if there are diligent scholar-immortals, or pure and faithful officials and clansmen who protect and uphold the scriptures and repentances, reverently invoking the responsive titles of the transformation bodies—if they delight in paper and ink, copying and binding the scrolls with silk cords, adorning them with the seven treasures, and exhorting the people of the realm to bow in worship and make offerings as if facing the true form, unwavering day and night, circulating and proclaiming them so that those who have not heard may hear and those who have not seen may see—those who cultivate in accordance with the Dao shall be protected by the assemblies of celestial immortals, jade maidens, and the ten divisions of mighty spirits. Such persons shall forever attain peace and happiness, fulfill their aspirations, and this majestic power is inconceivable, like the boundless void, impossible to exhaust."

Today, in this Daoist ritual assembly, as the scriptures declare, the responsive titles of the various Honored Ones are inconceivable. May all sentient beings—those who have already suffered or have yet to suffer—all attain liberation. The repentance master [Name] today prostrates for peace and offers this repentance text, bowing with the five limbs to the ground, wholeheartedly invoking: "We bow our heads to the Merciful Honored One, reverently paying homage to the true sages."

Today, the repentance master of this ritual assembly and the great assembly, gazing upward, vow that the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the lower realm, the various Honored Ones and sages, the lofty immortals of the Golden Towers, the sagely emperors of the Jade Capital, the dragon spirits and earth gods, the true officials of villages and domains, the celestial immortals and lords of the grotto-heavens, the assemblies of immortals throughout the ten directions, the entire expanse of the mysterious void, and all the manifested true sages—by their inconceivable power and boundless merit and virtue—may enable the repentance master [Name], prostrating for peace and offering this repentance text, to uplift the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages, the recently departed and the long-deceased, parents and the six relations, and all kin. Through this repentance, may they transcend to the Land of Ultimate Bliss, not linger in the three evil destinies, nor tread the five sufferings. May all living kin, close and distant relatives, and all branches of the family tree attain lasting peace and be forever free from suffering.

Moreover, may those who seek to avert misfortune, those who seek to repay karmic debts, those burdened by karma, and those afflicted by illness—all, by the power of this repentance, forever rely on the great Dao.

One bow.

Chapter Four: Manifest Verification and True Realization

Today, in this ritual assembly, each person directs their mind, bows in homage, and takes refuge, gazing up to the Merciful Honored One, manifesting the repentance dharma and verifying the karmic conditions. The repentance master [Name], gathering their mind and kneeling reverently, listens attentively to the scriptural words: "The Dao gives rise to the one qi, which divides and transforms into the three powers. Responding to the world, it establishes names and manifests titles according to conditions, pervading the dharma-realm, as numerous as the grains of dust. Furthermore, there are accomplished scholar-immortals who have ascended to the highest ranks among the heavens, also beyond count.

If there are good men and good women who can arouse the natural intention of the Dao, serving as rulers, kings, queens, consorts, dukes, and the people of the realm, as well as the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages, teachers, parents, themselves, and all kin—even those in the three evil destinies, the five sufferings, the eight difficulties, and the nine dark realms—who day and night practice the Dao, burn incense, scatter flowers, light lamps, and bow in worship to the titles of the Heavenly Worthies, then the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions and their countless assemblies will together come to witness and record their merits among the heavens. Their own blessings and longevity shall be boundless, disasters will vanish, transgressions will be extinguished, the realm will be at peace, the people will be at ease, the three evil destinies will cease their opposition, the five sufferings will halt their bitterness, and all stagnant sentient beings will attain liberation."

At that time, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate addressed the Master of Mystic Words, saying: "Always with this scripture and the transformative titles of the Heavenly Worthy, circulate and widely disseminate them, that they may pervade the ten directions. Let all men and women copy, enshrine, and reverently recite them, and they shall invoke the Ten Flower Perfected Ones, the Vajra Warriors, the Five Emperors of the Three Realms, and all majestic spirits to guard their lands and protect their people. If one establishes images wherever one dwells, the merit shall be immeasurable.

If there be male or female officials of the Dharma-body who, on the ten straight days of the first and last of the month, the Three Origins, the Eight Festivals, the days of their own life-destiny and the Geng-Shen, and the assemblies of the twelfth month, wish for the peace of the realm, quiet their minds, and silently recite the titles of the Heavenly Worthy, then they shall be met by immortals descending to receive them, and cloud-cranes coming to welcome them.

If one extols and praises, exhorting all men and women to receive, uphold, and recite these sacred images, the merit is truly inconceivable.

If there be sentient beings who, upon seeing the compassionate titles of the Heavenly Worthy, harbor disbelief, slight the Dharma-treasure, and doubt or slander the sacred texts, know that such persons have, from kalpas without measure, sunk into the lower ghosts, enduring manifold sufferings and passing through strange forms, only now to be reborn into the human realm. Foolish and blind, they comprehend nothing, habituated to evil causes, unable to believe or revere.

If there be sentient beings who, upon hearing this repentance ritual—be it a single sentence, a single verse, a single title, a single bow—generate a mind of faith, know that such persons in former lives once entered the jeweled city, heard the wondrous Dharma, and entered the jeweled treasury, where they personally read and recited. Now reborn, their faith and devotion only deepen.

If one initially holds this repentance ritual in reverence but later regrets, ceasing to bow or recite, and allows the mind to grow indolent, know that such a person, though possessing a human body, has not yet severed their strange forms. After this life’s transgressions, they shall again fall into evil destinies, suffering for ten thousand kalpas without hope of liberation."

At that time, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate completed the transmission of the scripture, and the Master of Mystic Words bowed his head in reverence and thanks. Then, moved by the true words, he received the seven transformative titles of the Heavenly Worthy, to be imparted to sentient beings for the salvation of the living and the deliverance of the dead. Thus, all beings shall be shown how to recite them without neglecting the sacred teachings.

Today, in this ritual arena, the repentance-master [Name], prostrating for [specific matter], bows in worship to this repentance text. With five limbs touching the earth and a single mind, he raises his thought, bows his head to the Compassionate Worthy, and reverently salutes the true sages:

With a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transformative Titles.
With a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pervades All Actions.
With a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Wisdom.
With a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Non-Action.
With a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Fills Empty Space.
With a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Purity.
With a sincere mind, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Conditions.

Today, the repentance-master of this ritual arena and the great assembly, looking up, vow that the Seven Transformative Titles of the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Treasure from the ten directions shall together lend their virtuous power to shelter and protect all beings. May the repentance-master [Name] fulfill his heart’s wishes, and may all karmic retributions and opposing forces be dissolved. May all living kin be free from obstacles and calamities, their misfortunes severed. Further, may they gain keen intelligence and profound virtue, their merits complete and their conduct perfected, their official and scholarly aspirations fulfilled, their achievements towering, their honors ever-renewed. May inner and outer realms alike know well-being, with superiors and inferiors in proper order. May weapons be stilled, winds and rains timely, and longevity prolonged. May their names be inscribed on jade tablets, one act of merit repaid ten thousandfold, eternally without end. Life after life, may they forever escape sinking and drowning. May their descendants continue for a hundred million years."

May all sentient beings together ascend the Dao’s shore.

**First Bow**
The Immortal Lord Ge Xuan proclaimed: The Most High Lord Lao said, "All the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions are born of the Primordial Beginning in response to qi, abiding and pacifying the lands, teaching and guiding sentient beings. According to karmic conditions and perceptions, they scatter their reflections and divide their bodies, transforming endlessly. With the turning of kalpas, they appear and vanish without constancy, opening the path to salvation for all, their blessings extending across the ten thousand heavens.

If Daoist priests, female officials, and all men and women can arouse a heart of goodness—for the sake of the ruler, parents, wives and children, themselves and their kin, the

May all be freed from suffering and universally attain liberation.
May all awaken to non-action and together ascend the Dao’s fruit.
