**Ritual for Establishing the Grand Offering to the Heavens of the Luo**

All ritual masters shall maintain mindfulness in accordance with the proper method.

**Proclamation of the Protective Incantation of the Numinous**

**East**
Ninefold *qi* of the Azure Heavens, great deities of the radiant stars.
Shining upon the eastern lands, illuminating the nine gates.
Revolving the candle of yang light, sweeping away defilement and baleful *qi*.
The Luminous Youth, styled as Mysterious Minister,
Guards my hall, ascending to face the Imperial Lord.
Subduing demons and binding specters, capturing malevolent hordes.
Upholding the true Dao, the vermilion script of jade texts.
The talismanic commands of the Nine Heavens, dispatched by dragon couriers.
May all under heaven be pacified, and I attain transcendence as a flying immortal.

**South**
Threefold *qi* of the Cinnabar Heavens, resplendent with streaming light.
The fire star revolves its candle, penetrating the illumination of the great sun.
Above dwells the Crimson Essence, in harmony with the Celestial August.
The Luminous Youth, styled as Radiant Chamber,
Commands the fire soldiers, guarding the Jade Hall.
Severing evil and binding specters, shearing and intercepting demon kings.
As decreed by the Northern Emperor, wind and fire surge forth.
Interlocking bells gleam, protecting the altar precincts.
May the upright *qi* flow freely—who dares act recklessly?
I receive the supreme merit, seated in the revolving of the *kuigang*.
Through kalpas unending, I safeguard heaven without bound.

**West**
Sevenfold *qi* of the White Heavens, essence streaming from Venus.
Light illumines the Golden Gate, penetrating the vast darkness.
Within dwells the White August, styled as Imperial Numinous.
Preserving the divine and pacifying the numinous, guarding my bodily form.
Cutting off the roots of evil, the jade Dao shines forth in rectitude.
Palaces and halls stand in solemn order, the three luminaries aligned as one.
In harmony with the Dao of spontaneity, I ascend to the Purple Court.
The talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure bestow universal grace upon all beings.
The primordial *qi* of the August Sovereign unites with my body.
Merit extends to all—heaven and earth are at peace.

**North**
The Dark Heavens of the north, where the Primordial One wanders.
The star of the dawn revolves its candle, illuminating the Grand Tenuity.
The Black Numinous Honored Deity, styled as Layered Might,
Dons a dark cap to soar through the heavens, clad in feathered robes of an immortal.
Guarding the five gates, inspecting essences and capturing transgressors.
Whoever dares to test me shall be shattered and crushed by the *huoluo*.
As proclaimed by the jade talismans, the eight divine mights of the perfected.
The gates of evil are sealed, the true Dao shines forth in radiance.
The three lights illumine me—my body knows no decay.
I whip the void and ride the floating clouds, my form ascending in immortal flight.

**Center**
Yellow *qi* of the central realm, regulating and harmonizing heaven and earth.
Forging and refining yin and yang, governing the mysterious and true.
The star of stability emits its radiance, streaming brilliance through the nine stars.
The Luminous Youth, styled as Celestial Splendor,
Yang *qi* flames upward, vermilion and blazing with essence.
Penetrating illumination within and without, revolving my bodily form.
A hundred evils are cast down, spirits and ghosts are captured and commanded.
The divine incantation of the Central Mountain is heard throughout heaven.
The five numina are pacified—my body ascends to the Upper Clarity.

**Striking the Ritual Drum Twenty-Four Times**

Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial, Threefold *Qi* of the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth from within my body the thirty-six *Gongcao* officials of the left and right, the left and right golden lads bearing incense, the jade maidens transmitting words and scattering flowers, and the thirty-six *Xianguan* messengers of the Five Thearchs on duty for the day.

Let them emerge, clad in solemn attire, robes adorned, caps and pendants hanging.
Report to the deities of the sacred altar’s land and the numinous guardians of the directional domains.

Now, as I establish this jiao-offering to express gratitude, I reverently submit this petition with utmost sincerity, all intentions faithfully inscribed and sealed.

May the supreme and perfected *Dao*-*qi* of the Most High, the auspicious radiance of the Numinous Treasure, descend and flow into our bodies, that the sincerity of my entreaty may swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao, the Three Clarities’ August Sages, and the August Jade Thearch of the Golden Gates, Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Vault.

Invoking the sacred ranks:
Your humble servant, [Name], together with the assembled altar officials, with unified sincerity, reverently petitions:
The Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Void and Spontaneous, the Boundless Dao’s Most High Lord of the Way, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch, the host of great perfected saints who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the true lords and elders, the thirty-two Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the Lord of the Dao of the Luminous August Numinous Treasure in the Seven-Jeweled Jasper Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace within the Jade Metropolis of the Mysterious Capital, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Supreme Ministers and Prime Counsellors, the Supreme Protectors and Grand Tutors, the twenty-four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching, the Perfected King of the Western City’s Assembly, the Perfected of the Great One, the Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and the Two Perfected Lords of Life-Prolonging Registers, the divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the grotto-heavens and blessed mountains, and all the numinous officials and spirits of the Three Realms.

I have heard: the Dao is not distant from humanity, manifesting in forms neither substantial nor void.
Heaven covers all things, its mechanism neither pure nor turbid when beheld.

Should but a single thought attain perfect clarity, the hosts of the ten directions shall assemble as one. Now the present officiant, so-and-so, has long cultivated pure devotion, offering from the depths of a sincere heart. For long he has purified the stellar altar, having already observed the rites of the Six Fasts; again he welcomes the cloud-borne tread, reverently performing the ritual of a single offering. Alas, millet and grain lack true fragrance—yet he reflects that the humble offerings of fern and cress may still be fit for sacrifice. Incense mingles with the morning mist, qi congeals around the rattling dragon-chariots; chimes echo in the dawn wind, their sounds blending with the distant strains of immortal music. In reverence, he acts as though the deities were present, moved to communion by his devotion.

We humbly pray that, borne on feathered flight through the clouds, the banners and standards of the Ten Perfections may shimmer in hidden splendor; emerging with the sun and entering with the moon, the standards of the Eight Treasures may wave in graceful majesty. May the Three Realms attend in their chariots, the myriad spirits take their seats. We, your servants, in awe and trembling, dare to invoke your august presence, and now respectfully present our petition for your descent.

We beseech: **Array the ranks, descend in sacred presence, be seated in tranquility, receive the tea offering.** May the phoenix-cakes and dragon-tea, presented in jade cups, humbly extend an invitation to your numinous abodes. May we, gazing upward, find your celestial countenance as near as a handbreadth, and may you perceive the earnestness of human intent. Above and below in communion, within and without in perfect resonance.

We, the officiant and your servants, in awe and trembling, bow our heads to the ground, prostrate ourselves, and reverently present the tea offering. **The ritual proceeds.**

We, your servants, have heard: Heaven speaks not, yet it visits calamity upon excess and bestows blessings upon the virtuous; the Dao/Way encompasses all, yet it ever abhors killing and cherishes life. Thunder embodies the awe of its tremors, rain and dew enact its nurturing transformation. Its net is vast and none escape, its virtue/power boundless and beyond naming. Fortune and misfortune do not arise by mere chance, but are summoned by human deeds. Should one know to turn toward goodness and distance oneself from transgression, one may transform misfortune into blessing.

We humbly reflect: the officiant, so-and-so, dwells amid the boundless love of the Two Modes, counted among the most numinous of the myriad beings, charged with the mandate to shepherd the people. Yet now we behold this grievous calamity—external afflictions of pestilence, warfare, drought, locusts, and floods—while within, even those who once dwelt in peace may find strife arising behind their own gates. Thus, the officials of this district and the virtuous gentlemen of this township make their proclamation to the august Perfected Ones of the Ten Poles. Now we set forth our words prostrate upon the earth, and establish this grand Offering of the Boundless Heavens. Our hearts hold purity and sincerity, our rites are arrayed with solemn reverence. Orchid candles glow in radiance, precious torches scatter the auspicious blossoms of the sixfold splendor; aloeswood and sandalwood mingle their fragrance, golden censers diffuse the five-colored omens of fortune. Spring fills the offering altar, clouds part to reveal the Yellow Path. As we prepare to present our gifts, we dare not follow mere routine.

Fearing that our humble offerings of water-plants may bring shame, we have not attained perfect purity; yet we gather the immortal herbs of ginseng and poria, substituting them for what would defile. Though our goods are meager, our sincerity overflows; though our hearts are pure, our forms may be spare. With this single devotion we presume to trespass, with a hundred bows we tremble in awe. The clear wine stands in the vessel—we reverently present the first offering.

The ritual proceeds.

We, your servants, have heard: that which can be spoken is not the eternal Dao/Way, that which can be named is not the eternal name. Its depths cannot be fathomed...

The mysteries of the profoundest principle—
what is called spirit is spirit, what is called sage is sage,
we revere the radiant and luminous numen.

We contemplate this body as a bubble upon the water,
lamenting how our light and shadow flicker like a candle in the wind.
Transgressions cannot be evaded—we fear the Han Code’s unyielding strictures;
yet blessings may be averted—we see the Han Records’ full accounts.
Gazing across the eight directions, we set the vast net of heaven’s rite,
purifying the five officials with ice-like clarity, our sincerity fixed in a single thought.
Having removed the defiled offerings, we renew our devotion with gathered water-plants.
We give thanks for sins forgiven, for grace received—
ashamed that otters and jackals could not compare;
we strive to begin anew, to persevere—
moved that even the toil of dogs and horses is not in vain.
Seeing what cannot be seen, hearing what cannot be heard,
we look up to the boundless expanse above;
drawing near to virtue, partaking of the Dao/Way,
we offer our earnest sincerity from the depths of our hearts.
May the faults recorded in the black registers be dissolved,
and blessings from the Pure Capital be inscribed.
May future prosperity be secured,
and impending disasters be averted before they arrive.
We, your servants, reverently present the second offering of wine.

The ritual proceeds.

We have heard: now present, now absent—
without sound, without scent.
The workings of heaven above,
vast and towering.
The essence of the supreme Dao/Way,
elusive and indistinct.
We exhaust our sincerity,
looking up to knock upon the azure vault.
Beholding this illusory, leaky frame,
we have sinned and have no ground for prayer;
looking up to the wondrous Dao/Way beyond names,
we find great virtue that encompasses all.
On this auspicious morning, we maintain solemnity,
purifying the altar with fragrant herbs.
Adorned with feathered crowns, we complete eight days and seven nights;
clouds drift from the Purple Palace, nine banners raised with ten pendants.
We recite the true scriptures and gather the mats,
arranging the fragrant offerings to disperse the altar’s boundaries.
In a fleeting moment, we behold the radiance of the celestial bodies,
hoping the grasses and thatch of our humble abode may be seen.
The mountain of sins crumbles and vanishes,
while the peak of longevity grows ever higher;
the sea of blessings becomes clear and serene,
flowing like an inexhaustible river of prosperity.
We, along with the ritual officers, bow our heads twice in reverence,
setting forth the rite to give thanks, presenting the final offering of wine.

The ritual proceeds.

The humble official [Name] and the assembled ritual officers at the altar jointly and reverently address the petition to: the Three Pure Ones of the Highest Realms, the Ten Directions’ Most Sacred, the Heavenly Perfected of the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, the Celestial Emperors, the Venerable Masters and Holy Hosts of the Ten Directions, the Officials and Attendants of the Three Realms, and all mighty numina.

We, your servants, have been fortunate across many lives to encounter this karmic affinity. Early on, we were graced by the grace of the Maple Throne, donning starry crowns and feathered robes; we inherited the rites of the Mushroom Altar, breaking the tally and dividing the jade rings. Though we have transmitted the ninefold regulations, our single heart’s sincerity can scarcely be exhausted. Now, having received the command, we humbly perform this offering of incense and devotion.

The painted horns fall silent, and the jade pendants chime with the rhythm of *dingdang*; the fragrant goblets pour emerald wine, and golden cups cast beams of luminous purity. With a hundred bows in three rows, we have fulfilled our reverent devotion; for a thousand transgressions and ten thousand sins, we now present this text of confession and gratitude.

The heartfelt words of the ritual officers.
We shall now proclaim them.
Proclamation of the Petition
Proclamation of the Memorial
Proclamation of the Presentation Document

The humble official [Name] again bows and addresses: the Three Pure Ones, the Most Sacred, the Ten Loftiest Perfected, the True Lords of the Ritual Altar, and all mighty numina. We humbly beseech your celestial compassion to look down upon our earnest devotion.

We have heard: in the vastness of the Great Heavenly Net, the jade steps of the Jade Terrace gleam with eternal spring; in the towering layers of clouds, the shell-palaces shine with undying radiance. The gates open to golden halls, and the ladders span the white-jade towers. Iridescent halos of light illuminate the solemn imperial regalia; the stars align in ranks, encircling the resplendent celestial court.

How much more difficult is it to behold the Most High in their exalted station, let alone for us to summon the Lord and presume to instruct? Yet we rely on the boundless grace of the Supreme Emperor, who does not disdain our lowliness, allowing even the humble to approach the sacred. Now that the courtly rites are complete, we hasten to welcome the return of your divine procession.

We envision the Primordial Beginning of the Void, whose chariot turns toward the wondrous court of Great Existence; the Lord of the Dao and its Power, whose carriage ascends to the true realm of the Upper Clarity. Flying dragons and dancing cranes escort the Old Lord back to the Jade Capital; whistling phoenixes and soaring simurghs accompany the August Heaven’s return to the Golden Towers. The Heavenly Thearch withdraws to the station of the Curved Array, and the Purple Tenuity returns to the Northern Culmen’s precincts. The Earthly Deities of the Rear receive their edicts and resume their posts; the Great Emperor of Longevity, together with the Savior from Suffering, turns their chariots homeward. The Three Sovereigns and Five Elders return to their palaces, and the Four Brahmā Heavens and Nine Empyreans withdraw their divine carriages.

Thereafter, we bid farewell to the deities of the various heavens as they resume their positions, gazing upon the host of immortals as they escort the procession. We bow in reverence to the gods and immortals present who return to the celestial realms, envisioning: the whips crack upon the cloud paths, and the gates of the heavenly courts swing open. The ranks of immortals, solemn as courtiers in ceremonial robes, enter in orderly procession; the majestic divine carriages, resplendent with banners and standards, turn back in formation. Feathered robes flutter, and the cries of cranes resound; celestial music plays, and the calls of simurghs fade into the distance. We pray that the Two Modes harmonize, the Two Qi follow their regular course, that auspicious stars appear over lands of virtue, and sweet dew nourish the fields of fine grain.

We bow in reverence to the gods and immortals present who return to the earthly realms, envisioning: the gates of the mountain palaces open, and the locks of the netherworld’s gates are drawn. The stately simurgh carriages swiftly enter the palace courts; the graceful crane chariots return to their grottoes and caves. Pearl curtains are rolled up as jade maidens joyfully welcome them; the jeweled carriages return as the immortals of the Jasper Realm smile and greet one another. We pray that auspicious omens herald good fortune, that the sagely blessings flow like springs, that the mountain spirits nurture worthy sages in this flourishing age, and that imperial decrees relieve the suffering of those in the netherworld’s gates.

We bow in reverence to the gods and immortals present who return to the watery realms, envisioning: dragons return to the deep seas, and horses cross Dongting Lake. The solemn divine procession, as if departing from the imperial palace, enters with dignity; the majestic ritual vestments, rejoicing, return to the throne. The carriages come to rest, and the moon’s reflection gleams upon a thousand rivers; the zithers and swords are sheathed, and mist envelops the Three Isles. We pray that your benevolent waves reach all beings, that your gracious favor shower the people, that the four seas calm the surging waves of leviathans, and that the three terraces aid the leaping of fish in the waves.

Thereafter, we bow in reverence to the gods and immortals present who return to the world of the living, envisioning: precious carriages float upon clouds, and pearl banners array like stars. Everywhere in the mountains and rivers, the deities have long awaited their return; in the solemn halls and temples, the immortals and sages are reverently welcomed back. The spirit banners are furled, and iron horses neigh in the wind; the celestial guards follow, and golden marten caps catch the moonlight. We pray that you deign to accept the offerings of the temple, that your blessings extend to the people of the realm, that compassionate clouds spread the gift of nurturing rain, and that harmonious qi gather to dispel the scattering winds of pestilence.

Next, we bid farewell to the spirits who return to the ancestral shrines, the guardian deities of the niches, halls, streets, and corners, each attending to their duties in the fleeting moments of their presence, leaving no trace behind.

We, your servants, linger until evening as the divine carriages depart, uttering these words—how can we face the distant celestial steps with shame, regretting that our bodies lack wings? In future petitions and rites of welcome, we humbly hope for your condescending grace.

With the deepest reverence and longing, we prostrate ourselves and send you forth with all our hearts.
The Great Offering to the Heavenly Net concludes.
