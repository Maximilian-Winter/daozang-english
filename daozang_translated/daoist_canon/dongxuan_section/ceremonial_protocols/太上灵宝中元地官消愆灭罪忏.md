### **The Supreme Numinous Treasure Repentance for Eliminating Transgressions and Eradicating Sins through the Middle Yuan Earth Official**

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning dwelled in the boundless world of the Nine Lands, broadly expounding the Great Vehicle, disseminating the essentials of the Dao/Way, and delivering sentient beings to depart from all suffering and affliction, universally granting them peace and bliss.

It was then the Middle Yuan [Festival], when all Daoists and laymen, men and women, received protection and deliverance, together enjoying carefree joy.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning further addressed the Earth Official of the Middle Yuan and all the sagely assemblies: "From this day forward, if the people under Heaven suffer misfortune, with the three disasters arising in contention and the five poisons spreading unchecked; if bandits and thieves invade and oppress, causing unjust suffering and devastation; if the people lose their livelihoods, their families live in dread, their prefectures, counties, villages, and farmlands fall into desolation, and the living starve to death; if relatives grow estranged, flesh and blood part ways, and deaths become extreme—these are the calamities wrought by demonic soldiers and demon kings. They cause those observing the Middle Yuan to endure manifold sufferings, with no place to survive. Gazing at one another, they can devise no plan.

The only recourse is to gather pure wealth, with ten households or five joining hearts and strength, to purchase incense and oil, establish a Daoist ritual arena, and sincerely invite accomplished Daoist masters well-versed in the scriptures to reverently recite the names of the One Hundred Twenty Celestial Worthies of the Middle Yuan. With utmost sincerity, they shall take refuge in the true image of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Five Venerable Thearchs, and all the immortals and sages, fully expressing their heartfelt sincerity to move all the heavens.

Thereupon, the Flying Celestial Divine Kings, the Ten Ultimate Perfected Ones, the Four Perfected Functionaries of Merit, the Inspectors of Life and Record-Keepers, the Overseers of Merit and Examiners of Transgressions, shall all descend into the ritual arena. They shall heed the people’s wishes, bestow blessings according to their thoughts, capture and subdue malevolent demons and harmful spirits, eradicate the five poisons and three disasters, and send down vast grace to protect and bless those who take refuge with sincere hearts.

The common folk shall inscribe their names in the Middle Yuan register of the Jade Calendar, eternally receiving the mysterious grace of the Dao/Way’s compassion. Nurtured by the Dao’s care, whatever they aspire to shall be accomplished; their families shall enjoy health and prosperity, their gates shall flourish, and their clans shall attain nobility.

After peace is restored, they shall devote themselves to revering the Three Luminaries and venerating all numinous deities, naturally obtaining blessings and eliminating disasters to pray for fortune.

The Earth Official of the Middle Yuan and all the sagely assemblies, hearing the Celestial Worthy’s exposition of the bridge for delivering people—a merit vast and inconceivable—all men and women praised and extolled everything. The retributions of life and death were all dissolved; the heavy gates of the dark prisons were opened, and all received illumination. The suffering souls of the destitute and wandering were reborn according to their thoughts.

Universally exhorted, all beings repented with utmost sincerity. Each person reverently and sincerely paid homage:

From this day forth, with utmost sincerity, I devote my body, return my spirit, and surrender my life to the One Hundred and Twenty Celestial Worthies of Responsive Manifestation of the Supreme, Boundless, and Utmost Dao of the Middle Prime.

Again, I reflect that from kalpas past until this day, I have committed the sins of discarding and neglecting scriptures, damaging and defacing them, and treating sacred texts with disrespect and contempt; the sins of quarrels and false speech among my inner and outer six relations, forming enmities that remain unresolved; the sins of slandering monastics and denying the principles of the divine; the sins of betraying Heaven and Earth without remorse; the sins of resenting parents, cherishing spouses and children, and committing the five inversions against siblings; the sins of borrowing and misappropriating others’ property, gold, silver, jade, silk, and treasures for personal use; the sins of deceitful commerce, exploiting others, and self-serving gain through false measures and scales; the sins of scheming for personal profit, cheating the people, and deceitfully evading the law; the sins of falsely invoking the names of sages and worthies to beg for merit, misusing offerings for personal gain, and fabricating falsehoods; the sins of killing living beings and engaging in licentious sacrifices. Such sins as these are measureless and boundless.

Today, I openly confess and repent, beseeching their eradication. I prostrate and pray that the Celestial Worthies of Responsive Manifestation of the Middle Prime and the Boundless Sacred Hosts command the Ten Upright Divine Immortals and Heavenly Emperor Envoys to record my transgressions, transform them into the merit of ten fasts, and submit them to the Heavenly Courts. May the sins I have confessed be dissolved at the sound of this prayer and wholly eradicated.

With utmost sincerity, I surrender my life and pay homage to the Supreme, Void, and Orthodox Three Treasures.

The *Middle Prime Earth Official’s Repentance for Eliminating Transgressions and Eradicating Sins* of the Most High Numinous Treasure is now complete.
