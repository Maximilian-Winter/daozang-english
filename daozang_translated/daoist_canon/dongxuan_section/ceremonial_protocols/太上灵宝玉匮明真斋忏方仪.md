**The Supreme Lingbao Jade Canon’s Rites of Illuminating Perfection and Repentance**
**Compiled by Du Guangting, Master of Broad Achievement**

**General Repentance**
We, your disciples and assembly, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Supreme Lingbao Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Polar Heavenly Lords, the Great Perfected Saints who have attained the Dao, the Most Real Lords and Sages, and the Divine Officials of the Ten Realms.

We bow in reverence and offer repentance.

**Confession**
We have heard that the Primal Honored One spreads transformation, opening the Ten Poles to oversee humanity; the Great Saints proclaim compassion, gazing upon the Eight Gates to relieve suffering. Thus, the most wise inquire into the categories of karmic conditions, while the Flying Immortals present the statutes of response and retribution. Since the texts of sin and blessing are made manifest, the principles of repentance and prayer are thereby established. We await the bestowal of supreme blessings to deliver those in the dark prisons.

We now reverently follow the sacred decree, strictly adhering to the ritual protocols. We prepare offerings of faith: silk brocades from the Ten Directions, incense, flowers, oil, and candles. On behalf of [Name], we perform the *Nine Dark Realms Jade Canon’s Illuminating Perfection Grand Fast* for [X] days and nights. We unfurl the Nine Radiant Mystic Tassels and invoke the Eight Assemblies’ True Scriptures. We take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Supreme Lingbao Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Polar Heavenly Lords, and the Divine Officials of the Ten Realms.

We repent for [Name]’s transgressions and errors, boundless and immeasurable, from kalpas past to this very day. Through this fast and repentance, we beseech their complete eradication. May the soul be refined in the Vermilion Mound, the spirit polished in the Cinnabar Palace. Ascend to the Palace of Mystic Yang, mount the Court of the Great Ultimate. Serve the August Sovereign in splendor, eternally attain the ranks of the Perfected. Join the lineage of the Primordial Sages, honor the sacred spirits of state and earth.

Clad in robes of rosy clouds and caps of celestial jade, wander the domains of Lesser Breadth and Supreme Tenuity. May the imperial destiny flourish, the dynastic foundation endure. May the Emperor’s glory equal the sun and moon, his years match Mount Song and Mount Heng. May the Six Palaces and Vermilion Gates, the Crown Prince and the myriad princes, ever tread the courts of fortune, eternally receive Heaven’s blessings. May the ministers and officials, the countless common people, together ascend the realm of benevolence and longevity, achieve the transformation of grand peace.

May the living glow with harmony, the Five Qi balance in equilibrium. May all beings, seen and unseen, together ascend the realm of blessings. After attaining the Dao, ascend into formlessness, unite with the Dao in truth.
