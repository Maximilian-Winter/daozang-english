**The Hong’en Lingji Zhenjun Jifu Wuchao Ritual**

The ritual proceeds according to form.
All pay reverence, the master visualizes as prescribed.
The divine incantation is proclaimed:

*"Cinnabar radiance flows and shines,
Lingzhi mushrooms glow with light.
Spiritual essence pierces the hidden,
Dispersing numinous power to the eight directions.
The true talisman gathers qi,
Whistling commands the Vermilion Youth.
The Three Luminaries spread brilliance,
Pouring into my Crimson Palace.
The Red Spirit settles and guards,
Jade incense overflows in abundance.
Illuminating beyond the form,
Inner and outer emit light.
Body born of water and fire,
Alone I soar in flight."*

**Response:** *"In harmony with the Dao, united with the True."*

The Dharma Drum is sounded twenty-four times.

We humbly beseech Your Sacred Compassion to deign to look upon us with penetrating insight.

We have heard that the Crimson Qi of the Cavernous Yang
Shines forth with radiant brilliance in the numinous chart.

The vermilion clouds of the cinnabar firmament
Cast their shade, beheld in awe beneath the feathered canopy.
The profound mysteries are deeply glimpsed within the treasury of wonders,
The Perfect Real is solemnly witnessed in its radiant advent.

We yearn for the Yang’s brilliance to merge with spring’s warmth,
As the vermilion terrace grows misty and mild;
Following courtly rites to greet the day,
The Purple Pole’s winds blow pure and clear.

Moved by the workings of Creation’s mechanism,
The teachings of the Immortals and Perfected flow forth.
Auspicious hues intertwine beyond the sun,
Resonant tones of jade echo through the cloud-layers.

With earnest devotion we expound the teachings,
With steadfast resolve we offer praise—
Gazing as though You were present,
Your descending insight is not distant.

With sincere and wholehearted devotion,
We have now made our supplication,
Following the purport of these words,
With utmost reverence and sincerity.

We aspire to repay Your grace with doubled veneration,
And to extend blessings for the realm’s enduring felicity.
The ranks of egrets hasten in orderly array,
The distant chime of the day’s clepsydra is heard;
Fragrant warmth rises from the dragon-carved censer,
As the hallowed breeze and luminous air revolve.

May the Perfected and Sacred One deign to accept our offering,
Uniting the hidden and manifest in mutual trust.

Today, at the noon audience,
We ascend the altar and perform the Dao,
The assembly of ritualists,
Now kindles the first pinch of incense, chanting:
The incense reaches the Lingji Palace,
Spreading through the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates to form a canopy of splendor,
Offered to the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates.

May this fragrant smoke
Be offered to the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates,
And to the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace.

We, Your servants, take refuge in the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace,
And dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense,
Reverently to the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates,
The Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates,
And the Nine Heavenly Ranks of the Five Marchmounts’ Treasuries of Numinosity.

The literary compositions unfurl like brocade,
Resplendent as the stars’ trailing radiance;
The grace of rain and dew, the light of favor,
Wondrously turn the pivot of the celestial mechanism.

Assisting and upholding the Imperial Pole,
Moistening and nourishing all living beings.

Now, therefore, we burn incense,
From our refuge in the virtue of the Perfected Lord, the Great Sage Host, and the Most True,
That after attaining the Dao, they may long preserve Heaven’s enduring existence,
*In harmony: With the Dao they unite as true.*

At the daylight watch, proclamations resound,
The Celestial Countenance bears joy;
Measuring the lodged intent with reverent service,
Through morning audience we extend our prayers.

On this noon audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao,
We beseech the dharma assembly:
Offering this second pinch of incense,
*In harmony: The incense reaches the Lingji Palace, suffusing the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates as a canopy of treasures, to honor the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates.*

May the smoke of this incense honor
The Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates,
And the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace.

We, Your servants, take refuge in the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace,
And dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense,
Reverently to the August Emperor, our Lord,
Humbly wishing His Majesty’s exalted throne endure,
Ever sheltering the realm.

May earth endure and Heaven last,
Ascending to ten thousand years of sagely longevity;
May the sea embrace and spring nurture,
Awakening the joy of all people.

May the frontiers know no dust of war,
And the fields yield their plowing and weaving;
May loyal ministers illumine the court,
And the seas and lands attain pure tranquility.
May these auspicious signs herald the flourishing of perfect governance,
And the long unfolding of Great Peace’s propitious destiny.

Now, therefore, we burn incense,
From our refuge in the virtue of the Perfected Lord, the Great Sage Host, and the Most True,
That after attaining the Dao, they may forever preserve long life,
*In harmony: With the Dao they unite as true.*

Ten thousand sages share one radiance,
A single light universally bestowed;
The sun of kindness broadly opens in the cinnabar realm,
The light of compassion is reverently beheld in the numinous palace.

On this noon audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao,
We beseech the dharma assembly:
Offering this third pinch of incense,
*In harmony: The incense reaches the Lingji Palace, suffusing the Nine Heavens’ palaces and gates as a canopy of clouds, to honor the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace.*

May the smoke of this incense honor
The Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates,
The Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates,
And the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace.

We, Your servants, take refuge in the host of Perfected Immortals and Sacred Worthies of the Lingji Palace,
And dedicate the merit of this pinch of incense,
To the Crown Prince, the imperial princes, the pillars of state,
The ministers and officials, the people of the realm,
And all beings within the world.

Humbly we pray:
May the Three Virtues flourish and abound,
Harmoniously aiding the myriad affairs of governance.
May brilliance and clarity increase,
And sagely learning daily renew in virtue and enterprise.
May body and mind embody trust and compliance,
And cultivation and governance perfectly accord with Heaven’s intent.
May a hundred blessings gather in abundance,
And a thousand auspicious signs converge.

May anxieties yet unmanifest forever cease,
And joys yet to come arrive in profusion.
May they ascend to the felicity of benevolence and longevity,
And flourish in the blessings of harmony and peace.

Now, therefore, we burn incense,
From our refuge in the virtue of the Perfected Lord, the Great Sage Host, and the Most True,
That after attaining the Dao, they may forever preserve long life,
*In harmony: With the Dao they unite as true.*

*Chanting the directions, repenting the directions.*

First, second invocations—threefold prostrations.
Reverently re-declaring the sacred ranks, we, your subjects in attendance, together with the officiating officials and assembly, humbly and earnestly re-present this supplication to the august thrones.

We have heard that the Great Potter’s wheel scatters all things, universally infusing the qi of life in ceaseless flow. Utmost sincerity moves the numinous, and we aspire that our earnest hearts may ascend to meet them. Now, as the sun rides the zenith of equinox, we solemnly array our ranks to attend the celestial court above. The nine-hued radiance of the image abides, and the ten directions inter-reflect in splendor. The eight phoenixes’ chant resounds in response, and the myriad norms unfold in full.

We, your servants, reverently receive the imperial mandate to offer repayment through devotion, and serve the jiao rites with utmost reverence. The offerings of milfoil and pondweed embody the gravity of ritual intent, and the sacrificial feast is not distant; the incense and flowers resplendently adorn the altar’s solemnity, and our responsive praise is but scrupulous. Our gaze ascends to the jade steps, our ranks arrayed upon the jeweled terraces.

Yet through ten thousand kalpas of ignorance, the karmic conditions remain unwashed; though we toil at the Three Vehicles’ truths, our devotion to the Dao is in vain. First, we beseech the mercy of lenient pardon, that we may exhaust the utmost of our earnest entreaty.

Above, we pray that the imperial domain expand in grandeur, and the precious throne stand secure in majesty. May the ancestral altars endure for ten thousand years, and the chariots and written scripts of the four seas last forever. May the heir apparent’s virtue of cultured refinement flourish, brilliantly aiding the myriad affairs; may the imperial kinsmen and feudatories together share the diligence of joint assistance, extending auspiciousness through a hundred generations.

Further, we hope that the Five Phases follow their proper sequence, and the Six Qi harmoniously converge; that all people embody the compassion of universal love, and all beings fulfill the nature of their creation. May the teachings shine forth in brilliance, and the transformative power of the Dao flourish in action. May every sentient being together realize the omniscience of enlightenment.

Thus may the luminous transformation of the Perfected Lord’s great compassion be fulfilled above, and the sincerity of our refuge and devotion be answered below.

Respectfully presented for your hearing.

Twelve Vows—
Abiding in spirit, we burn incense.

May the Fragrant Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant Fragrant Spirits and Divine Officers hereby cause the site where I, your servant, ascended the altar at the noon audience to perform the Daoist rites to naturally generate golden liquid elixirs, azure mushroom blossoms, and jade stalks of immortality. May the hundred numinous spirits and assembled perfected beings gather here before this incense burner. May our utmost sincerity be felt and responded to, bringing blessings and prosperity in abundance; may the divine ever grant their support, and may both family and state together attain purity and tranquility.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke, conveying the words I have just uttered swiftly to the presence of the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens and the Vast Grace Perfected Lord of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens.

*Exiting the Hall Chant*
*Stepping Forth from the Chamber*

The Noon Rite of the Vast Grace Numinous Aid Perfected Lord for Gathering Blessings is now complete.
