**Evening Rites of the Golden Talisman**

*All bow to the Master,*
*Mindful as the Law commands.*
The radiant glow shines forth,
Auspicious qi swirls in circles.
The Dipper and Oxen’s light is clear,
The Hall of Immortality stands serene.
Jade pupils gleam with golden truth,
The sacred altar is pure and complete.
Night transforms to day,
The child returns before noon.
Mount Tai’s pearls cascade,
The vermilion phoenix flies in perfect roundness.
Demons are silenced, deceit extinguished,
Ascending steps through clouds and mists.
Heaven’s purity gathers all,
Assembling at the Imperial Gate.

*The Law is struck twenty-four times.*

「With this evening’s imperial court in session,
we ascend the platform to perform the Dao,
and invite the assembly of the Law to partake in this offering of three twists of incense.

May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly reaching to venerate the Most True, Supreme Teacher—
the Five Spirits’ Celestial Master, the Wondrous Old Sage of the Northern Pole,
the Purple Cloud Emperor of the Wǔxī,
the Sovereign of the Earthly Mound, and the boundless holy assembly of the Great Red Heavenly Palace.

We, the subjects, having taken refuge in body, spirit, and life,
prostrate our heads to the earth,
and look upward to rely upon the Supreme Three Lords and the Ten Directions’ holy assembly.

May the merits of this incense be dedicated
to flow back to the Seven Ancestral Temples and the spirits of the clan’s illustrious lineage.

May we ride the Dragon Chariot of the Three Realms,
piercing the void and the sacred landscape;
and mount the Phoenix Palanquin of the Nine Heavens,
together entering the Millet Pearl.

May blessings shower upon the state and family,
and may the joyous lineage endure in splendor.

Now, we burn incense,
and take refuge once more in the Teacher’s holy assembly.

The Most True Virtue,
after attaining the Dao,
ascends to the formless,
harmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.

**Ritual Observances:**
Repentance and confession—three invocations, three bows,
repeatedly extolling the sacred ranks of the Law.
All present officials and this humble servant, [name] of the [clan],

now solemnly and sincerely present our petition
to the Three Realms’ Most Exalted Lords,
the Ten Directions’ Supreme Saints,
the Jade Capital Emperor of Heaven’s True Essence,
the group of luminaries—Sun, Moon, and Stars—
the Ten Directions’ Teacher-Lords and holy assembly,
the officials and attendants of the Three Realms,
and all the divine forms arrayed upon this ritual platform.

We have heard that the Dao’s grandeur and virtue’s nobility
are rare and subtle, merging with the wordless;
its vast transformations and sacred divinity
are resonant yet hidden, manifesting in the winged.

Heaven is ninefold in its layers, close and impenetrable,
and the Sun threefold in its approach, with reverent supplication.

Deep and boundless within,
vast and flowing above.
We, the subjects, with awe, follow the imperial edicts and perform our rites,
and with utmost sincerity, adhere to the sacred patterns in our morning and evening devotions.

We purify with the incense of the pine and lotus,
and set our hearts upon the boundless expanse;
we gaze upon the crimson standards and the jade wheels of the distant heavens,
and fix our vision upon the tiered clouds.

We reverently aspire to the Pure Capital,
and diligently strive toward the Purple Extremity.

Yet, mindful of the six dusts’ defilements,
we are doubly cautious and tremble like ice;
tasting the profound mysteries of the Three Caverns,
we long depend upon the clouds’ covering.

We humbly implore the mercy of those with compassionate creation,
and earnestly pray without fail.

**Supreme Petitions:**
May the holy calculations align with Heaven,
and the imperial brilliance shine like the Sun.
May jade and silk come from distant islands,
and may arms forever cease at the borders.

May the august example govern the Six Palaces,
and may the Mother of Courtesy be honored and revered;
may benevolent sounds spread across the Four Seas,
and may the sacred body be perpetuated in glory.

May loyal and virtuous ministers be aided in their counsel,
and may the protective barriers all receive blessings and prosperity.
May the one ruler be joyous and secure,
and may the myriad ages be venerated in peace.

May yin and yang be attuned,
and may winds and rains follow their season;
may the Five Grains ripen,
and may the people flourish.
May the roads echo with song,
and the fields resound with dance,
as all return to the pure winds of antiquity;
may rivers teem with life,
and clouds soar with joy,
as all celebrate the nature of spontaneous birth.

May the state and family gather in celebration,
and may the Dao’s transformations radiate in splendor.

Thus, we align with the Most Exalted Heavenly Lords’ great compassion,
and fulfill the sincerity of our subjects’ refuge in life.

We respectfully present our petition and await your response.

**Twelve Petitions—**
Burn incense with reverence for the spirit.»

The Fragrant Officials and Dragon-Tiger Envoys,
the Left and Right Celestial Guardians,
and all the attendant Spirit Officials of Incense—

Let them now command that at the very place
where I formerly ascended the platform for the Evening Court and performed the Dao,
golden elixir and jade-green mushrooms shall spontaneously arise.

Here, the myriad spirits and true ones gather,
converging at the incense brazier’s flame.

May I now pray that the Ten Directions’ Celestial Youth
and the Jade Maidens attend in attendance,
that fragrant mist convey my words as formerly recited,
and swiftly deliver them directly to the Most Exalted Supreme Dao,
the Three Pure Ones, the Most Holy Celestial Sovereign,
the Golden Gate, the Jade Emperor, the Divine Sovereign of the Highest Heaven,
before the august throne.

**Exit the Hall and Chant:**
*"The Evening Court rituals of the Golden Talisman are now complete."*
