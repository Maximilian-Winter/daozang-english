*The Scripture on the Ritual Decorum of Bells and Chimes from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*

At that time, the Perfected One of Wisdom and Virtue, together with five hundred perfected beings, approached the Most High, bowed their heads, and inquired about the ritual decorum for assembling the multitude.

The Most High said: "The multitude is of two kinds—one, the sacred assembly, and two, the ordinary assembly. Whenever the Dharma is expounded, precepts observed, obeisances made, or repentance offered, and whenever salvation is extended to the living to deliver them from birth and death, or in all meritorious gatherings where they should convene, the bell shall be struck to summon them.

"In former times, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, while in the Heaven of Form, taught and transformed through the Dharma. As the time was not uniform and the assembly arrived in succession, he emitted ten kinds of radiance from between his brows, illuminating all the heavens, the five hundred million worlds, and the boundless lands, so that all might hear and know. Manifesting his great divine power, he expounded the wondrous Dao of the True One, harmonizing the essence of the Five Harmonies to form the boundless treasure bells. Each resonated according to its region, emitting numinous sounds in unison, their voices pervading heaven and earth, their tones like jade chimes. All intoned cavernous hymns, shaking day and night in accord with the twelve hours. Every being who heard them rejoiced, their hundred afflictions dispelled. Those who had not believed came to believe; those who had not awakened came to awakening. They gave rise to all manner of good wisdom and aroused the mind of right mindfulness.

"From that time onward, the system of bell sounds spread throughout the ten directions. Now, what you have asked is how to open and awaken the wisdom and virtue of all beings—how disciples, novices, and later learners, though they may have heard the bells and chimes, do not yet understand their ritual decorum. They are uncertain whether the bells of all the heavens are the same as those of the lower realms, or if there are distinctions among them."

The Most High replied: "In the Three Clarities’ supreme realms and throughout the Three Realms and ten directions, the names and forms of bells differ. Now I shall roughly explain them; listen well."

The Most High said: "In the Heaven of Great Pervasiveness, there are the Nine Luminous Floral Bells, the Seven Luminaries Divine Bells, the Cavernous Radiance Floating Bells, the Flying Essence Void Bells, the Great Radiance Cloud Bells, the Heaven-Opening Radiance Bells, and the Spontaneous Divine Bells.

"In the Heaven of Jade Clarity, there are the Phoenix-Born Heavenly Bells, the Floral Treasure Cloud Bells, the Rosy Flame Numinous Bells, the Jade Dragon Floral Bells, the Void Brightness Treasure Bells, the Ninefold Radiance Bells, and the Myriad-Transforming Jade Bells.

"In the Heaven of Highest Clarity, there are the Ten Floral Treasure Bells, the Four Floral Phoenix Bells, the Lightning Radiance Bright Bells, the Dragon Radiance Bright Bells, and the Simurgh-Soaring Floral Bells.

"In the Heaven of Supreme Clarity, there are the Ninefold Essence-Composed Bells, the Hundred Treasures Void Brightness Bells, the Cloud-Forming Floral Phoenix Bells, and the Heaven-Flying Dragon Bells.

"In the Nine Heavens, there are the Self-Sounding Floral Bells, the Nine-Colored Radiance Bells, the Myriad Treasures Floral Bells, and the Great Spontaneous Bells.

"All these are formed from the spontaneous true essence and wondrous qi, their radiance penetrating and luminous, their divine transformations boundless. They take a thousand forms and ten thousand appearances, responding and changing beyond naming. Some are large, some small, each sounding of itself in accord with the cosmic movement. Their tones are resonant and bright, harmonious and refined, attuned to the numinous.

"In the Four Brahmā Heavens, there are the Life-Delivering Divine Bells, the Longevity Numinous Bells, the Salvation Divine Bells, the Demon-Dispelling Divine Bells, the Soul-Returning Divine Bells, the Demon-Restraining Divine Bells, the Demon-Subduing Divine Bells, the Evil-Quelling Divine Bells, the Numinous Treasure Waving Bells, the Immortal-Gathering Jade Bells, and the Truth-Returning Harmonious Bells.

"In the heavens of the Three Realms, there are the Life-Preserving Bells, the Prosperity-Joy Bells, the Self-Sounding Bells, the State-Pacifying Bells, the Fate-Responding Bells, the Treasure-Longevity Bells, the Harmony-Extending Bells, the Longevity-Prolonging Bells, and the Spirit-Guarding Bells. All these are forged from the gold of purple phoenixes and azure dragons, the night-shining rosy treasures, receiving the qi of the Nine Heavens and the fire of the Nine Springs, combined to form them.

"In the Heaven of Blissful Ease, there are the Lotus Bells, the Soaring Cloud Bells, the Graceful Phoenix Bells, the Intertwining Dragon Bells, the Longevity Bells, the Disaster-Dispelling Bells, the Calamity-Delivering Bells, the State-Protecting Bells, the Life-Stabilizing Bells, the Life-Preserving Bells, the Cultivation-Period Bells, the Weapon-Averting Bells, and the Demon-Dispelling Bells. All these are cast and carved from gold, silver, bronze, iron, jade, and precious stones. There are hundreds of thousands of myriads of each, some sounding at six, nine, or twelve hours. Each is attended by bell-keeping numinous officials, jade lads and maidens, golden essence fierce beasts, lions and apotropaic creatures, vajra spirit-kings, who guard and serve them day and night, striking them to awaken all beings.

"Thus, the ritual decorum and precepts were transmitted to the Perfected One of Wisdom and Virtue, and proclaimed throughout the Three Realms and ten directions, that all might see and hear.

"Thereupon, the Perfected One of Wisdom bowed to the Most High and reverently received the ritual decorum.

The Most High said: "As for worldly bells, they are made of gold, silver, bronze, or iron, with two, three, four, six, or nine corners, or no corners at all, their size varying as appropriate. They are hung on the left side of terraces, pavilions, towers, or halls. At the proper time, one dons ritual vestments, recites invocations, chants praises, and strikes them. Begin with rapid strikes, then slow and sparse, sounding three times. If eight strikes are used, they follow a rapid rhythm."

Begin again with rapid strikes, then slow and sparse, sounding twenty-four times. Once more, strike rapidly, then gradually slow, sounding twelve times in all.

The Most High said: "At improper times, one must not strike them wantonly. If one does not don ritual vestments, recite invocations with purity, or maintain proper rhythm, the Five Emperors shall examine such transgressions. The offender shall fall into icy hells after death, and for a hundred kalpas endure the retribution of being born without soles. Be ever vigilant."

The Most High said: "When a Daoist master passes away, strike the bell three hundred and sixty times to announce their end to all."

The Most High said: "The chime-stone is made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, or jade. When performing the Dao, reciting scriptures, chanting praises, or observing precepts, strike it in rhythm, always suspending it on a stand."

Thereupon, the Perfected One of Wisdom and Virtue recited thirteen invocations:

**Dawn**
Six Brahmā voices answer Heaven’s Gate,
Ten thousand emperors ascend Cloud Palace bright.
Incense wafts, crimson sun ascends,
Chants flow with the pure wind’s flight.
Divine perfected scatter jade blossoms,
Spiritual sounds ripple through the vast sky.
All sages gather at the appointed hour,
Far and near, they hear the bell’s cry.

**Sunrise**
Purple Tenuity emits celestial light,
Azure splendor births jade tones.
Myriad scenes illuminate Cloud Palace,
Immortals pay homage at the jade peak’s throne.
Resounding echoes stir the endless void,
Lingering notes shake the jeweled grove.
Rejoice in this celestial joy,
Dispelling my long-held gloom.

**Morning**
Parting clouds, I ascend Heaven’s Terrace,
Gaze afar at the Nine Pures’ domain.
Recalling the soaring clouds’ flight,
I hear the cavernous void’s refrain.
Worldly movements are not worth beholding,
Yet the wondrous sound is fit to hear.
Let jade tones arise,
Dissolving this hidden sorrow’s veneer.

**Mid-Morning**
Jade maidens wield numinous mechanism,
Golden bells resound in distant skies.
Awakening the myriad heavens’ beings,
Delivering the Nine Darks’ lost sighs.
Suffering souls emerge through clouds,
Sunken spirits ascend on fate’s tide.
Divine power defies all reckoning,
Dharma sounds pervade the formless wide.

**Noon**
The Great Void enfolds the Six Qi,
The Supreme Dao unfurls the One Origin.
Brahmā voices weave earth’s net,
Dharma drums emerge from heaven’s margin.
When realms are empty, the heart is still,
Yet when emotions cling, the will grows loud.
Contemplate these six-hour sounds,
And release the hundred cares that crowd.

**Afternoon**
Celestial youths turn the wheel of space,
Divine maidens play the hidden loom.
Day and night, Heaven’s Gate is traversed,
Cycles follow the stars’ silent gloom.
Phoenixes sing through twelve hours,
Dragons soar, returning to their home.
Strike the jade tones’ melody,
And manifest the Heavenly Worthy’s might.

**Late Afternoon**
Four dragons follow heaven’s course,
Five Emperors drive the sun’s chariot bright.
Moon maidens scatter fragrant treasures,
Cloud Palace descends with jade blossoms white.
Ten immortals heed the Dharma bell,
All gather at the Most High’s abode.
The Five Sufferings find lasting release,
Forever chanting the Cavernous Void’s ode.

**Sunset**
Loftily, the myriad heavens’ mechanism turns,
Day and night follow in endless round.
The Most High expounds the sacred teachings,
Proclaiming them throughout the world’s bound.
Responding to realms, True Kings arise,
Officials divide their duties with care.
Immortal youths strike the jade bell,
All sages assemble at Heaven’s Gate fair.

**Dusk**
Crimson radiance reins the morning glow,
Purple wheels ride the night’s moon.
The Two Luminaries alternate,
The Four Seasons never cease to croon.
Jade youths announce the appointed hour,
Jeweled bells ring out with resonant sound.
Bowing to the Most High,
They ascend the Golden Portal’s ground.

**Nightfall**
The yang wheel descends to the hidden chamber,
Yin shadows illuminate the clouded hall.
Pearl terraces resound with jade tones,
Jasper palaces waft with fragrant allure.
Wondrous sounds arise from the cavernous void,
Subtle echoes contain hidden verses’ store.
Together they praise the Void’s melody,
Pure notes soar beyond the wind’s roar.

**Midnight**
Divine youths open the starry gates,
Holy mothers mount cloud-borne dragons.
Sun and moon alternate in succession,
Day and night renew their ancient pacts.
Heaven and earth blend myriad incenses,
A thousand perfected descend from on high.
Jade sounds weave the Great Void,
Golden censers birth purple mist’s sigh.

**Cockcrow**
Five hundred million celestial realms,
Three thousand worlds in their vast array.
Every region arrays immortal domains,
Every place has its spirit bells’ play.
Brahmā sounds arise in Dharma halls,
Wondrous rhythms stir the numinous breeze.
Causes and conditions never cease,
Merit and virtue forever increase.

**Perpetual Bell and Chime-Stone Verse**
Purify and don celestial robes,
Focus thoughts on the Terrace of Clouds.
When the hour arrives, strike the bell,
Immortals and sages step through the void.
Jade tones whisper in the Mystic Capital,
Golden incense wafts in Purple Tenuity’s glow.
Ten thousand riders soar through clouds,
Nine blossoms fly beyond the empty sky.
Phoenixes wheel and soar,
Lions charge and roam free.
Jade-hungry maidens array,
Immortals sit reciting scripture’s decree.
Bowing to the ten directions,
Empty thoughts dwell in the Three Pures’ sea.
The Heavenly Worthy abides in the void,
Vague and indistinct, originally formless.
Serene and numinous, naturally responsive,
Ever able to move with sincerity’s force.
Western consorts play jade chime-stones,
In harmony with the Cavernous Void’s song.
Hell holds no guilty souls,
Heaven records the virtuous’ names.
At one resounding jade bell’s chime,
All bow and listen in awe’s thrall.

The Most High said: "These verses and gāthās were transmitted by the Primordial Beginning to the heavens at the dawn of the Dragon Han kalpa. Should emperors and kings recite them, their souls shall be purified and at ease, all perfected beings descend to their chambers. When bells are struck and invocations recited, their sounds shall resound in unison, ringing clearly through the ten directions. All sages rejoice, the Nine Darks’ souls are pardoned, men and women chant in praise, lands enjoy peace, and blessings endure forever, unending through the ages."

The Most High said: "When all assemble, listen for the three bell strikes, then don caps and sashes, and arrange incense. When the long bell ceases, refine and purify your ritual decorum, then join in unison with Brahmā sounds and harmonious elegance. Proceed to your seats, circumambulate, and upon completion, strike the chime-stone in rhythm. Heavenly beings, immortals, sages, and mortals—all gather thereby. Be ever mindful and cautious, lest you incur the Five Emperors’ punishment."

The Most High said: "In the Mystic Capital stand eight jade-blossom bells, placed upon the terrace of the Central Heaven. Responding to the Six Brahmā qi, cycling through the Twelve Mechanisms, they sound without being struck, their voices ringing through the ten directions. All perfected beings bow, listening to their tones, and gather in the Mystic Capital. The heavens take this as their model."

The Perfected One of Wisdom and Virtue, along with five hundred companions who had come together, all voiced their approval, bowed, and withdrew.

Thus concludes *The Cavernous Mystery’s Ritual Decorum of Bells and Chime-Stones*.
