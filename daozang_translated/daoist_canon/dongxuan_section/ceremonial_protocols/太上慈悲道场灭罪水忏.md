**The Supreme Compassionate Dao-Field Rite of the Water Repentance for the Extinction of Sins, Fascicle One**

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Origin resided in the Great Luo Heaven, upon the Purple Tenuity Terrace of the Jade Capital and Golden Tower. There, a grand assembly of immortals was convened, where the wondrous Dharma was expounded to deliver and enlighten both gods and humans, guiding them to awaken to the Dao without enduring manifold sufferings. Manifesting great majestic power and radiating boundless luminosity, the light illumined all ten thousand realms.

All sins and blessings stood plainly before them, profound and subtly wondrous. Through expedient means, all the destitute souls of the hells—enduring immeasurable agonies and inexpressible torments—were delivered, rescued from drowning in the depths, and universally liberated.

Then, the Merciful Honored One of the Origin, in boundless compassion, further expounded the essential Dao, bestowing benefits upon both past and future. Again, he addressed the perfected attendants at his side, saying:

"Humans receive life, all endowed with the same qi. Yet upon birth, their fate is bound to the Three Origins. Longevity or premature death, fortune or misfortune, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness—all arise from the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, good and evil, life and death. Each follows the root of their former existence, and all receive retribution according to their karmic deeds, never deviating, as the shadow follows the form or the echo responds to the valley.

On the Three Origin Days each year, the officials of the Three Origins, along with the deities of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the spirits of good and evil, and all numinous officials ascend to the Golden Tower before the Primordial Celestial Worthy to examine the registers of life and death for men and women, the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, and the ledgers of names and deeds of the destitute souls in the Nine Dark Hells, the Water Palaces, and other realms.

At this time, if there are faithful men and women who naturally awaken to the Dao, erecting Purple Tenuity Treasure Terraces, Jade Capital Treasure Mountains, pavilions and towers adorned with a hundred treasures, offering incense and flowers, burning incense and circumambulating, chanting cavernous scriptures, lighting lamps and releasing living beings, performing the *Step-of-Emptiness* rites, practicing almsgiving and making vows, repenting transgressions and submitting memorials, holding grand fasts and jiao offerings, and devoutly petitioning Heaven and Earth day and night without ceasing—then I shall dispatch the Celestial Worthies and Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, the divine immortals of the Three Realms, the Four Controllers, and the Youths Who Save from Suffering to descend to the human realm, all arriving at the Dao-field to extinguish their sins and protect the living.

Thus shall the lands be peaceful, men and women joyous and at ease, all blessings descend, and all evils cease to arise. The suffering souls of hell shall be liberated in an instant, reborn in the heavens to enjoy boundless bliss, their merit towering and their blessings immeasurable."

The Merciful Honored One continued: "On the fifteenth day of the first month, the Celestial Official of the Upper Origin and the Recording Officials of the Hundred Bureaus ascend to the celestial palaces to present the registers of sin and blessing for the world’s people."

For this reason, the sponsor of this repentance rite now dedicates the merit, reverently prostrating to all the lofty perfected ones of the Upper Origin Heaven, taking refuge in the spirit, body, and life, and paying homage to the supremely merciful and compassionate Celestial Worthy beyond compare.

Thus has the body craved softness and smoothness, the mind given rise to false imaginings, the eyes beheld evil forms, the ears listened to perverse sounds, the nose favored foul odors, the tongue coveted rich flavors, the heart harbored jealousy, and the mouth uttered defiled speech.
Such sins as these are boundless and immeasurable.

The *Water Repentance for the Elimination of Sins in the Merciful Altar of the Most High* concludes here.
The *Water Repentance for the Elimination of Sins in the Merciful Altar of the Most High*, Scroll the Lower.

We beseech forgiveness for all sins—from beginningless time until this very day—committed by ourselves, our masters and teachers, our parents, our six relations, and our boundless kin, which have obstructed the human realm in countless ways.

Moreover, in the course of trade and commerce, whether as traveling merchants or settled traders, in buying and selling goods, in transactions at inns and markets, in measures of volume and weight—scales, bushels, ounces, and grains—there may have been additions or subtractions, deceptions or concealments from others. Perhaps we exchanged the coarse for the fine, the short for the long, defrauded others in calculations, breached walls to steal, or committed robbery and theft. Perhaps we blocked roads, denied debts, or lent capital at exorbitant interest. Perhaps we feigned false skills to swindle others of their wealth, or envied the intelligence, wealth, or status of others, abusing official power to slander them. Perhaps we secretly set traps or shot arrows, offending the divine. Perhaps we consumed wine and meat, the five pungent vegetables, or the three forbidden foods, defiling sacred merit. Perhaps, as officials or clerks, we administered justice unfairly. Perhaps, in high position, we were irreverent, or in low station, disrespectful—lacking rank in the court or standing in the community.

Such boundless and measureless transgressions as these I now devoutly confess and repent in their entirety. Next, I dedicate this merit to all the immortals and sages of the Lower Primordial Water Realm, taking refuge in the divine, taking refuge in the spirit, taking refuge in the body, taking refuge in life—O Most Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy.

With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who expounds the Dao in primordial chaos.

With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who repays merit with virtue.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who conceals traces to preserve the Dao.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy crowned with a floating canopy of purple radiance.

From this point onward, I reverently recite the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.

I beseech forgiveness for all my transgressions from beginningless time until this day—those committed against my parents, teachers, and preceptors, whether living or deceased, whether of the Daoist or secular realms, and all my kin. Perhaps I have lightly esteemed the Three Treasures, my devotion lacking constancy. Perhaps I have betrayed my teachers and preceptors, violating vows and breaking covenants. Perhaps I have been disloyal to my sovereign, unyielding to the times, failing to honor the Great Dao, or treating its teachings with contempt. Perhaps I have defiled rivers and streams, dredged the hundred waterways, taken fish and scales to satisfy my palate. Perhaps I have acted without shame or remorse, disdaining clothing and food, wasting the five grains, cursing oxen and horses, harming silkworms and moths, or neglecting agriculture and sericulture. Perhaps I have seen profit and forgotten righteousness, lacking integrity and honor, favoring the new while abandoning the old, or knowing kindness yet failing to repay it.

Such boundless and measureless transgressions as these I now devoutly confess and repent in their entirety. Next, I dedicate this merit to all the immortals and sages of the Lower Primordial Water Realm, taking refuge in the divine, taking refuge in the spirit, taking refuge in the body, taking refuge in life—O Most Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy.

With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of unparalleled honor and wonder.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who bestows grace from the Jade Capital.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who saves through the treasure of adaptable power.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the radiant Brahma-light of the Great Tenuity.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy whose true form is perfectly fulfilled.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of supreme and unconditioned victory.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of tranquil harmony and pure joy.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of serene non-attainment.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the unfathomable dark source.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of silent contemplation and non-action.

From this point onward, I reverently recite the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.

I beseech forgiveness for all my transgressions from beginningless time until this day—those committed against the living and the dead, the Daoist and the secular, for failing to reflect on the toil and suffering of my parents, repaying none of their nurturing care: the ten months of pregnancy, three years of breastfeeding, turning dry for wet, swallowing bitterness to spit out sweetness, washing and tending, their boundless love and concern—only to commit the five heinous acts of filial impiety in return. Perhaps as son or daughter, for the sake of qi or wealth, I have indulged in wine and lust, entangled in enmity and curses, implicating my parents in endless resentment. Perhaps in building homes or graves, I have violated many taboos, filling the measure of my sins to overflowing, inviting calamity to flow forth. Perhaps my retribution has come through lawsuits and summons, my deceased ancestors drawn into the fray. Perhaps my fate has grown weak and perilous, malevolent stars traversing my path, manifesting in this life as various karmic flowers, while in hell, they ripen into various karmic fruits.

The Merciful Worthy declares: Such retributions for the body in this life all stem from sins committed in past lives. After death, one passes through hell, and in the next life, suffers retribution across the six paths, endlessly revolving in the wheel of rebirth.

Today, I devoutly confess and repent of all these transgressions in their entirety. Next, I dedicate this merit to all the immortals and sages of the Lower Primordial Water Realm, taking refuge in the divine, taking refuge in the spirit, taking refuge in the body, taking refuge in life—O Most Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy.

With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy whose merit and deeds are boundless.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy whose Dharma rain pours abundantly.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of vast and perfect fulfillment.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who pities the suffering of all beings.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who concentrates the Dharma-treasury in emptiness.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy, the King of Non-Attainment and Grace.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who responds and transforms according to conditions.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who illumines the world with clarity.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who adapts to impermanence.
With utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of vast compassion and magnanimity.

From this point onward, I reverently recite the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.

I beseech forgiveness for all my transgressions from beginningless time until this day.

Then the Merciful Worthy spoke again: I see that the people of the lower world suffer many misfortunes, harmed by malevolent spirits. For the sake of your deceased ancestors, parents, and honored kin, on the five La days—when heaven and earth grant amnesty—you should establish vegetarian feasts and Daoist rites, perform the Dao, offer reverent repentance, and submit petitions to rescue and deliver the deceased, that they may all attain liberation.

On the first day of the first month, the Heavenly La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Azure Dragon Gate of the Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove in the Azure Heaven to review the records of human sins and blessings.
On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Earthly La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Cinnabar Heaven at the Brahma Treasure Prosperous Cinnabar Terrace Gate to review the records of human sins and blessings.
On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Daoist La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Golden Gate of the Plain Heaven at the Plain Spirit Gate to review the records of human sins and blessings.
On the first day of the tenth month, the People’s Year La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Dark Gate of the Mysterious Heaven at the Black Spirit Gate of the Cavernous Yin to review the records of human sins and blessings.
On the La day in the twelfth month, the Royal La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Mysterious Capital Jade Capital of the Primordial Spirit at the Wuji Metal Gate of the Primordial Origin in the Eightfold Radiance Hall of the Primordial Beginning to review the records of human sins and blessings.

These days are all occasions for assembling and determining the registers of good and ill fortune, life and death—all pertaining to the living.

On this day, the Nine Generations of ancestors—parents, spirits of the dark prisons, and wandering ghosts—are summoned by the Northern Emperor of Fengdu for interrogation. Long confined in the nether realms, their sins accumulated over ages, their offenses entangled with the names of descendants and the locations of ancestral tombs. If, after kalpas of time, no redemption has been sought, the living are implicated on this day: the names of descendants, kin, and the nine clans are called forth, their sins recorded as the living’s transgressions, their offenses bound to the Dark Capital, the nine clans doomed to annihilation.

On this day, one may submit petitions for deceased parents, offering repentance and supplication for their deliverance, that each departed soul may receive relief. Ordinary sacrifices cannot reach them, for Fengdu’s depths are too profound, its barriers too impassable. Only through the true Dao may their long-standing transgressions be absolved, for the nether officials do not wish to detain them indefinitely. Prolonged confinement of the dead incurs reproach from the celestial courts, and the officials of the dark realms are likewise held accountable. Thus, the living’s fortune turns to misfortune, and calamity arises therefrom. Yet if filial sons and daughters observe this day with fasting and rites, the names in the Black Registers are erased, and all may attain transcendence.

Today, the master of this repentance ritual, [Name], dedicates the merit, invoking the Perfected Immortals of the Lower Prime’s Water Realm, paying homage to the divine, surrendering body and life, to the Great Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy:
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to devotion and follows karmic conditions.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who cultivates ascetic practice and accumulates merit.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who sees through all without attachment.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who answers distress with grace.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Sun and Moon’s radiance.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy free from stagnation and form.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms and liberates without limit.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of constant compassion and mercy.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Dharma Body.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy whose Dharma Body pervades all.

Having recited the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies above, we beseech repentance for [Name], from beginningless time until this day, for the six relations and kin of both the living and the dead, for the karmic causes of rebirth through the Six Paths, for the four modes of birth, ceaselessly taking form, unrestrained in the three karmas, indulging the six senses—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, greed, delusion, anger, harsh speech, divisive words, falsehood, frivolous talk, disbelief in causality, failure to practice expedient means, betraying heaven and earth, breaking fasts and precepts, deceiving outsiders, scheming against masters, casting curses, summoning ghosts and spirits, neglecting the four kinds of life, unmindful of a single breath—each thought a transgression, each deed a fault. All these sins reside within the body, with no means of absolution. Some fall into hell, others become beasts; without encountering sacred scriptures, how can they attain liberation? Such offenses are boundless. Today, with utmost devotion, we repent them all, then dedicate the merit, invoking the Perfected Immortals of the Lower Prime’s Water Realm, paying homage to the divine, surrendering body and life, to the Great Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy:

With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure’s Imperial Heaven.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Truth and Myriad Blessings.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mystic Upper Jade Palace.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers immortals and sagely beings.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who cherishes life and delivers beings.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Void.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Flower.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void’s Luminous Sovereign.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign’s Mystic Spirit.

Having recited the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies above, we beseech repentance for all manner of sins. Prostrate, we implore the Compassionate Worthies of the Three Realms, the Perfected Saints of the Ten Directions, the Great Emperors of the Three Primes, the Five Venerable Elders, the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus, the Seventy-Two Courts, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the Eight Seas and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, and all Perfected Immortals—to universally extend salvation, to manifest great compassion, to unfurl the clouds of the Dharma, to scatter the rain of the Dharma, to dispel burning afflictions, to wash away transgressions and faults, to instantly bring coolness, to clarify like clouds dispersed, to accumulate blessings for the living, to elevate the departed, to secure the nation and enrich the people, to rejoice in great peace, to fulfill merit and perfect virtue, to awaken to the Dao in every life, to hear the scriptures in every generation, that all sentient beings may ascend to the Dao’s shore.

Thus concludes the *Lower Scroll of the Supreme Compassionate Repentance Ritual for the Elimination of Sins through the Water Rites*.
