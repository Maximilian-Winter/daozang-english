**Midday Court Rite with the Golden Talisman**
The Ritual Master bows in reverence, mindful of the Dao as prescribed.
The incantatory hymns resound in emptiness, the Celestial Sovereign’s altar stands.
The Five Emperors inspect and record, the Three Officials receive the talismans.
The Five Gates are guarded in solemnity, malevolent forces bound and wickedness extinguished.
Jingling bells and hurled flames consume all unclean *qi*.
The body wears the Golden Scripture, refining the essence of immortal herbs and complexion.
The Mystic Essence and Pure Unity align—when the heart stirs, the Three Passes open.
Riding lions and straddling cranes, commanding dragons and ascending phoenixes.
Ten thousand stars defend the hall, a myriad demons dare not intrude.
The Dao’s *qi* endures eternally, ten thousand immortals rest in peace.

**Twenty-four Beats of the Ritual Drum**
The Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Dao, the Three *Qi* of the Most High Venerable Lord Lao,
summon forth the Ritual Master’s body and the Thirty-six Officials of the Five Agents,
the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Bearers of Incense and Golden Boys,
the Heavenly Messengers and Flower-Dispersing Girls, the Twelve Zodiacal Deities,
the Five Emperors with their Rectifying Talismans and Rectifying Days, each thirty-six in number.

Those who emerge are arrayed in splendid attire, their caps and sashes adorned with trailing ribbons.

The Passes open to the Mystic Altar and the Local Land Deity,
the Regional Spirit and Divine Authenticity.

The Ritual Master now performs the midday court rites,
ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
and pays homage to the Celestial Sovereign’s True Form.

With utmost sincerity and reverence, the Ritual Master presents a sealed petition,
hoping to receive the Most High’s supreme Dao, the Primordial *Qi*, the Sacred Treasure’s radiant light,
descending directly into the Ritual Master’s body,
so that the Ritual Master’s sincere invocation
may swiftly reach the Celestial Sovereign’s True Form,
the Boundless Dao of the Three Pure Ones and the Most High Saints,
before the Jade Gate and the Golden Emperor’s Divine Presence.

**The Invocation of the Ritual Assembly**
The Ritual Master of surname [blank], along with the assembled officials at the altar,
respectfully unites in sincere devotion to address:
The Boundless Dao of Natural Perfection, the Supreme True Form,
the Jade Pure Holy Realm, the Great Primordial Lord of the Dao,
the Most High Dao Sovereign, the Most High Venerable Lord Lao,
the Supreme Celestial Sovereign, the Golden Emperor,
the Purple Cloud Celestial Palace’s Supreme Emperor,
the Purple Cloud Central Palace’s Great Emperor of the Northern Pole,
the Sovereign Earth of the Rear Soil,
the Seven-Treasured Layered Platform of the Mystic Capital,
the Sacred Treasure’s True Form in the Purple Cloud Celestial Palace,
the Golden Gate’s Divine Assembly of the Primordial Dao,
the Supreme Grand Minister and Supreme Grand Scribe,
the Supreme Protector and Supreme Advisor,
the Minor Protector and Minor Advisor,
the Four Teachers and Five Emperors,
the Twelve Heavenly Consorts,
the Thirty-six Departments of Sacred Scriptures,
the Great Master of the Mystic Dao,
the Great Master of the Three Heavens,
the Celestial Palaces of the Sun, Moon, and Stars,
the Grand Marshal of the Constellations and the Starry Hosts of the Revolving Heavens,
the True Spirits of the Milky Way,
the Emperor’s Native Star Sovereign,
the Crown Prince’s Native Star Sovereign,
the Five Sacrificial Deities of the Inner Court,
and the True Spirits of the Three Realms.

With reverence, we gaze upon the Great Benevolence,
and humbly await the Celestial Sovereign’s luminous inspection.

The Ritual Master hears:
The radiant *qi* of the Mystic Yang,
its light effulgent upon the Sacred Diagram;
The flying clouds and crimson skies,
casting their shade in lofty grandeur beneath the Feathered Canopy.

The profound mysteries are fathomed in hidden wonders,
the supreme truth is witnessed in its radiant presence.
The sun’s brilliance melts the spring’s chill,
the vermilion steps are warmed by mist;
the court rites follow the morning’s order,
the Purple Extremity is cleansed by wind.

We are moved by the harmony of creation’s workings,
and the transmission of the immortals’ teachings.
Sacred hues interweave in the sun’s outer layer,
resonant chimes echo through the clouded tiers.
With unwavering sincerity, we expound the Dao’s lessons,
and with steadfast resolve, we uphold our aspirations.
Though the Celestial Sovereign’s gaze is distant,
the inspection descends as if nearby.

The Ritual Master now obeys the Celestial Edict,
devoutly practicing the Golden Talisman Ritual.
We beseech the Great Mercy,
and in homage, pray for the Emperor’s eternal sacred longevity and unshaken security,
that the imperial realm’s foundations may endure forever.

The incense’s fragrance ascends in pairs,
the distant sound of the daywater clock is heard;
the incense warms the dragon’s head,
the gentle spring breeze turns with solemn grace.
We gaze upon the Celestial Sovereign’s luminous presence,
and through profound and manifest communion,
offer our sincerest devotion.

At this midday hour, ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
the Ritual Master summons the assembly,
and with the first twist of the incense, presents it aloft.

May this incense’s smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering reverence to the Supreme True Form,
the Boundless Dao’s Sacred Treasure,
the Great Primordial Lord of the Dao,
the Golden Gate’s Supreme Celestial Sovereign,
the Golden Emperor,
and the Supreme Saints of the Most High Dao.

The Ritual Master, body, spirit, and fate,
prostrates with head to the ground,
and depends upon the Three Most Highs and the Ten Directions’ Saints.

May the merit of this incense
ascend to bless the Emperor.
We humbly pray that the imperial lineage may be firmly established,
and the celestial mandate flourish without end.

The Sacred Calculations align with the vast aeons,
the Imperial Dao surpasses the age of Xīhuáng.
The Six Palaces are serene,
the Hundred Officials are loyal and virtuous.
All under heaven, all within the seas,
return to the Dao’s embrace.
Ascending mountains, crossing the seas,
tribute offerings come without ceasing.
This incense is now burned,
and the Ritual Master takes refuge in the Teacher’s Supreme Saints.

The Supreme True Form’s virtue,
after attaining the Dao,
endures eternally in harmony with the Dao’s perfection.

The midday hour is proclaimed with joyous celestial countenance.
We ponder the ancient heart’s intent and act with due reverence,
and through the court rites, renew our prayers.

At this midday hour, ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
the Ritual Master summons the assembly,
and with the second twist of the incense, presents it aloft.

May this incense’s smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering reverence to the Supreme True Form,
the Boundless Scripture’s Sacred Treasure,
the Celestial Sovereign of the Purple Cloud,
the Great Emperor of the Northern Pole,
the True Immortals of the Celestial Palace of Yǔ’s Remnant,
and the Boundless Saints.

The Ritual Master, body, spirit, and fate,
prostrates with head to the ground,
and depends upon the Three Most Highs and the Ten Directions’ Saints.

May the merit of this incense
ascend to bless the Crown Prince.
We humbly pray that the Green Records may be firmly established,
and the Golden Tablets extend his years.
The Nine Heavens’ True Sovereign may grant respite,
and the Three Illuminations’ sacred light descend in favor.
His daily life is tranquil,
his blessings ever more abundant.
This incense is now burned,
and the Ritual Master takes refuge in the Teacher’s Supreme Saints.

The Supreme True Form’s virtue,
after attaining the Dao,
endures eternally in harmony with the Dao’s perfection.
All Saints share in the radiant light,
one illumination pervades all.
The benevolent sun’s rays open upon the dark and dense,
the compassionate light is witnessed in the Green Records.

At this midday hour, ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
the Ritual Master summons the assembly,
and with the third twist of the incense, presents it aloft.

May this incense’s smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering reverence to the Supreme True Form,
the Sacred Treasure of the Five Spirits,
the Mystic Old Lord of the Dao,
the Great Emperor of the Northern Pole,
the Sovereign Earth of the Rear Soil,
and the Boundless Saints of the Celestial Palace of Great Redness.

The subjects herewith return their bodies, spirits, and lives to the Dao,
prostrate themselves with heads to the earth,
and in reverence depend upon the Supreme True Three Lords,
the Saints of the Ten Directions.

May the merit and virtue of this incense
flow back to the ancestral spirits of the Seven Temples,
and the illustrious Saints of the ancestral line.

Humbly praying that the celestial carriage ascends to the realm of boundless void,
and gazes upon the lion-throne,
as honored guest in the pure and serene celestial heavens.

May blessings descend upon the realm and family,
and flourishing prosperity extend to the nation’s lineage.

Now, as before, the incense is burned,
to return in homage to the Teacher-Lords, the Supreme Saints.

The virtue of the Supreme True Form,
after attaining the Dao,
ascends to the formless realm,
in harmony with the Dao’s true perfection.

The **Ritual of the Nine Directions** is performed,
with three awakenings, three offerings,
and repeated invocation of the sacred ranks.
The assembled officials and subjects of such-and-such surname,
in solemn sincerity, offer this incense to the Three Lords of the Highest Realm,
the Supreme Saints of the Ten Directions,
the Jade Capital Golden Gate Celestial Emperor of True Heaven,
the luminous hosts of sun, moon, stars, and constellations,
the Teacher-Lords and Saints of the Ten Directions,
the officials of the Three Realms,
and all the sacred forms and spirits arrayed in this **exorcistic ritual banquet**.

The subjects hear that the boundless void’s wondrous Dao
moves through the single **qi** to nurture the Three Realms;
the natural and true perfection
scatters the single **spirit** to give birth to myriad phenomena.

The august lineage of the Dragon-Han Ancestral Eon
propagated the Dao and inscribed its teachings;
at the dawn of the Red Brightness,
establishing merit to benefit all beings.

They regulated the celestial pearls of the Vermilion Axis,
illuminating the jade candles in the Azure Expanse.
The celestial hosts fulfilled their duties among the immortal ranks,
while the water and land officials administered their examinations.

With solemn rites and offerings made,
boundless blessings were bestowed.
They rescued and protected all living beings,
sheltering all ranks beneath their grace.

We, the subjects, humbly receive the sacred scriptures and talismans,
proclaiming the imperial will of the Dao.
All who sincerely uphold the reverent offerings
shall surely attain the responsive efficacy.

In awe of the imperial edicts,
we honor and secure the state.
With respectful words and offerings presented,
we devoutly proffer our most fragrant prayers.

With pious reverence to the luminous spirits,
we humbly pray for their manifest favor.
May we hope for the august return of the crane’s chariot,
that the phoenix’s carriage may temporarily dwell.

May boundless and vast blessings be bestowed,
preserving the lofty and enduring mandate.

May the stars shine in orderly splendor,
illuminating the realm with radiant life.
May longevity and prosperity flourish,
with tranquil and peaceful governance.

Thus, above we honor the Heavenly Sage’s great compassionate transformation,
and below, we fulfill our subjects’ sincere devotion.

Respectfully submitted.

**Twelve Vows**
*Preserve the spirit, burn the incense.*

The Fragrant Officials and Dragon-Tiger Envoys,
the Left and Right Celestial Guardians,
and the Attendant Spirits of Incense—

Let them now command that at the very site where I formerly ascended the platform for the **Noon Court of the Dao**,
golden elixir and jade-green herbs shall spontaneously arise.

When the myriad spirits and true ones gather here,
before the incense and fire altar,

I pray that the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Youths** and **Jade Maidens** may attend in attendance,
and that fragrant mists convey my previously recited words
directly to the **Supreme Ultimate Dao of the Most High, the Three Pure Ones, the Most Exalted Heavenly Sovereign, the Golden Gate Jade Emperor, the Divine Presence of the August Heavenly Lord**.

Upon exiting the hall, let the hymns be chanted—
the **Noon Court of the Golden Talisman** rites are now complete.
