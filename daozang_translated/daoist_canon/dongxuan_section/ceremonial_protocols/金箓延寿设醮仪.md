**Title:** *Ritual of the Golden Talisman for Longevity and Exorcism*
**Scripture Name:** *Golden Talisman for Longevity and Ritual Offerings*
**One scroll.**

**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canon of the Orthodox Daoist Tradition), *Tongxuan* (Cavernous Mysteries) section, **Rituals and Ceremonial** category.

**Ritual Procedure as Prescribed:**
Observe the rites in accordance with the prescribed form, and silently venerate the *Lishī* (Ritual Master).
The Five Stars illuminate, radiantly manifesting the Five Directions.
The Water Star repels calamities, while the Wood Star brings prosperity through its virtue.
The Upholstering Star (Yìnghuò) dissipates misfortune, and the Great White Star (Tàibái) wards off military threats.
The Zhen Star (Zhènxīng) firmly establishes its influence, benefiting both the family and the state.
The names are inscribed on jade tablets, and the words recorded in the Imperial Archives.
Riding the gusting winds, they scatter across the boundless heavens.
Entering and exiting the unseen realms, they wander and feast in the Ten Directions.
The Five Clouds hover as canopies, summoning deities and binding the winds.
They command the myriad spirits, safeguarding the celestial Sage-Lord (Xiānwēng).

**Twenty-four beats of the Ritual Drum are sounded:**
Invoking the **Supreme Three Heavens**—*Xuān Yuán Shǐ* (Primordial Beginning), *Sān Qì* (Three Breaths), *Tàishàng Lǎo* (Supreme Venerable Old), and *Èr Jūn* (Two Sovereigns)—
We summon forth our subjects:
The **Central Three-Five Officials** (Zhōngsānwǔ Gōngcāo), **Left and Right Attendants** (Zuǒyòu Guānshǐ), **Left and Right Incense-Bearing Envoys and Dragon-Cavalry Officers** (Zuǒyòu Pěngxiāng Yìlóng Qíshì), **Incense-Serving Golden Boys** (Shìxiāng Jīntóng), **Messengers Who Disseminate Words and Scatter Flowers** (Chuányán Sǎnhuā Yùnǚ), and the **Five Emperors’ Officials of Rectification and Direct Illumination** (Wǔ Dì Zhífú Zhí Rì Xiāng Guānshǐ)—each in groups of **thirty-six**.

Those who emerge must be clad in **resplendent ritual attire** (xián zhuāng xiǎn fú), wearing **headdresses with trailing ribbons** (guān dài chuí yīng).
Open the gates to summon the **local deities and spirits** (lǐ yù shén zhēn) of this region and its domain.

The humble subject now establishes the **Great Offering Rite (jiào)** and performs the **Morning Reverence (cháo xiū)**. With profound reverence, we present these **sacred talismans (dān qín)** and **sealed decrees (jiān téng)**.

We pray that the **Ten-Directional True Worthies (shí fāng zhēng zhēn)** of the **Supreme Dao (Tàishàng Dào)** may descend their **living qi (shēng qì)**, flowing into our bodies, so that our sincere supplications may swiftly reach the **Ultimate True, Boundless Dao (Wújí Dào)**, the **Three Pure Ones (Sānqīng)**, and the **Supreme Sage of the Jade Gate (Yùhuáng Dìshì)** before the **Celestial Sovereign’s august presence (Hàotiān Zhìzūn Jīnquè Yùhuáng Dìshì Yùqián)**.

We humbly invoke the **Lawful Rank (fǎ wèi)** and **Full Rank (jù wèi)**, declaring our surname and name **[blank]**, along with the **temple-officials and assembled assembly (lín tán guānzhòng)**, to jointly present our sincere petition to:

The subject has heard that **the Dao precedes Heaven and Earth**, condensing **radiant light within the chaotic void (hùndòng)**; it **transforms both yin and yang**, wondrously shaping **harmony within the primordial chaos (hóngméng)**.

Encompassing all yet bound by measure,
Embracing the boundless without limit.
Called **Xī**, called **Yí**, called **Wēi**—
Ascending to the peerless beyond the peerless;
Only **Xuán**, only **Yuán**, only **Shǐ**—
Lofty and arching ever higher.

Gazing upward, it vanishes in fleeting wonder, beyond naming;
Gazing downward, it fades into boundless obscurity, beyond reckoning.
All who dwell in cultivation—who dares transgress its bounds?

We, humble and coarse as **chū** wood,
Ensnared by dust, our essence impure.
Chasing illusory realms, we drift ever onward in the swift gallop of time;
Clutching fleeting light, we sigh in vain as the hare races past.

With solemn vow to mend our faults,
And resolve to strive for merit.
Aspiring to diligent progress in the **Dao**,
Hoping to preserve our conduct and receive instruction.

We humbly receive Your august edict,
With solemn reverence in our rites.
Dutifully following the **Xuán**’s model,
And earnestly unfolding the courtly **comportment**.

Like **kuí** and **huò**, we bend in sincerity;
Like **píng** and **fán**, we offer respect.
We humbly pray for Your august blessings,
That the **Shàngshèng**’s radiance may flow.

With **zhūfèng** winging the chariot,
Descend the **lǜniǎn dānyú** in ceremonial array;
With **xuánlóng** in harnessed flight,
Accompanied by **qiónyún yǔgài** in their ranks.

The **Three Realms** attend the **xuān**’s carriage,
Ten thousand **zhēn** receive their duties.
Our rites shall match our triple sincerity,
And not fail in our utmost devotion.

Our humble plea—
We await with deepest reverence.

Descend to the **lièbān** of sacred stations,
The **Three Realms**’ assembled **zhēnshèng**.
We now extend our obeisance,
Trusting in Your gracious presence.

Let each take their place in the **xiān** ranks,
Together reverently welcoming the **Dìyù**.

The **Luan-yu** arrives and halts, the **Hèjià** chariot descends to the hall.
With the assembled **zhēn** of the **jiào** feast, we perform the rites as prescribed in the **cháo lǐ**.

When the **cháo lǐ** is complete, we humbly approach the **jiào** platform.
The **lǐguān** presents incense, and the first libation is poured.

**Fǎshì**—
We solemnly proclaim the **fǎwèi**, and the officials of each rank, [Name] of [Surname], with utmost sincerity, address:
The **Three Pure Ones**, the **Shàngshèng**, the **Ten Extremes’ High Worthies**,
The **Yuánróng** Emperors and Empresses of the **xiānzhēn**,
The **Fāngyù** officials and masters of the **lǐngzhí**,
All **zhēnlíng** within and beyond the **Three Realms**.

I, **Rùn**, humbly receive the **liúguāng** of the **Sān Dòng**, the **yùjú** extending the **zhǎnshēng** ordinance;
The **Jiǔ Qīng** spread their **bùhuà**, the **lánghán** recording the **yìshòu** scriptures.
From the **wànbiàn hùndùn**’s transmission of the **jīng**, through the **liúhé gāomíng**’s unfolding of the **jiào**.
Grace flows through the **Huánghùn**, blessings permeate the **Qīngwēi**.
With reverence, we greet the **Shèngdàn**’s newly arrived radiance,
And with devotion, we offer the **Huáfēng**’s hymns of praise.

Our hearts cry to the heavens, our prayers strike the earth.
Ever mindful of the **Jiǔhuán**’s **yùqì**,
We seek the **Qīfǎn**’s **yánzhēn** technique.
We rely upon the **Dàdào**,
To aid in the grand felicity.

We expand the **Jīnluó**’s **xuánwén**,
And universally welcome the **Yùjīng**’s **Shàngshèng**.
May they arrive upon the **Huángdào**’s gusts,
And pause their **Bǎoniǎn** at the **Yáotán**.

Joy overflows with Heaven’s grace,
Longevity grows with the **Shèngsuàn**’s decree.
Our sincerest words are laid before You—
We kneel in humility, awaiting Your edict.

**Xuāncí**—
The **cíwén** shines with **xuánjiàn**’s clarity.
Though **shūjì** lacks fragrance, we offer it in **rǎnshèng**’s purity;
Though **píngfán** may be presented, we arrange the **miánlěi**’s rites.

May You graciously accept our offerings,
And daily oversee our devotions.
The **zūn yí** harmonize in their order,
As the **línghuā** resounds with the **jiǔzòu**’s music;
The **biāndòu** stand in solemn grace,
Surrounded by the **fúbǎo**’s **jiǔguāng** banners.

With utmost sincerity and reverence,
We pray for Your **yīnyì**’s protective blessings,
And eternal harmony in the **shēngpíng**’s joy.

We present incense once more, and the second libation is poured.

**Jìn zhuàng**—
I have heard that though Heaven is high, its hearing is low,
And though human hearts vary, they are never distant.
If one seeks longevity and prays with devotion,
Heaven’s response is certain and hidden within.

Now, with reverence, I follow Your **gūnyīn**,
Establishing the **tán** and conducting the **jiào**,
Already blessed by Your **cíguān**.
May Your **jiàngfú** and **yánnián** blessings be granted,
As our **zhēn**’s prayers are answered.

May Your **Huángtú** endure forever, Your **Shèngshòu** be ever secure.
New celebrations should flourish,
As the **chúnsōng**’s vitality thrives;
Our long-held hopes now manifest,
Before the **jīyì**’s radiant splendor.

May our longevity match the **Huáéng**’s grandeur,
Our fortune equal the **Hèhàn**’s vastness.
Let the **Zhì** align with the **Tángyú**’s era,
And the **Yōnghé** echo the **Xīhào**’s harmony.

Next, we pray for our **zhàngnǎo** to be dispelled,
And our **chényuán** to be liberated.
To **chuándào shòufǎ**, our resolve aligns with **jīnlán**;
To **shǒumò cúnchéng**, our conduct strengthens like **bīngbó**.

All petitions and supplications,
Shall be entrusted to the **gǔnmì**.

Our highest wish:
May the **yuán gài** flourish in splendor,
The **fāngyú** be serene and bright,
The **shānlíng** present auspicious signs,
The **chuānhòu** display celestial omens.
May the winds be attuned, the rains timely,
So that the **bǎigu** thrive with **dìlì**’s bounty;
May the stars shift, the seasons turn,
As **tiān’ēn**’s blessings perpetually flow.

With **tóngwén tóngguǐ**, we unite in harmony,
Bringing **fù kāng** and **shòu**.
The **yuānfēi yúyè** live in **tāo yìqì**’s vitality,
The **shòuwǔ fèngyí** embody **wànxíng**’s transformation.
All beings of awareness,
Shall realize the **wúwéi**.

With utmost reverence, we present incense once more, and the final libation is poured.

**Fǎshì**—
We solemnly proclaim the **fǎwèi** once again.

「具位臣姓某重称上启三清上圣、十极高真、日月星斗、本命星君、天地神祇、阴阳主宰、三界内外应感真灵。
