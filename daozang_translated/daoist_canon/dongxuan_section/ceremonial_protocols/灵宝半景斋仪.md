*Scripture Title:* *Lingbao Half-Day Retreat Ritual*. One fascicle.

**Lingbao Half-Day Retreat Ritual**
From dawn to noon is called the "half-day."

**Dawn, First Audience**
First, open the gates and declare intent.
Next, recite the *Changdao* and *Huaxia Hymn*, leading to the Earth Gate.
Then, each pays homage to the master, visualizing the union as prescribed.
Next, recite the *Guardian Spirit Mantra*.
Then, strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.
Next, kindle the incense burner.

*"Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within the bodies of us, your assembled officials, the Three and Five Merit Officers, Left and Right Envoys, Left and Right Fragrant-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers, Golden Lads of Incense, Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Six Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants for this day. Dispatch them to report to the local earth deities and true officials of this domain. We now burn incense and humbly serve the Great Dao’s disciple [Name], who establishes this wondrous Lingbao Half-Day Retreat, praying for grace, repenting sins, atoning for transgressions, dispelling calamities, safeguarding peace, and seeking blessings. May the Primordial Qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected Ones descend into our bodies and that of the retreat’s sponsor, so that our petition swiftly ascends before the August Jade Emperor of the Supreme, Boundless, and Utmost Dao."*

Next, each declares their ritual rank.

*"We, your servants [Names], with utmost sincerity, jointly petition: the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal of Emptiness and Spontaneity, the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the Host of Great Sages who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions, the Perfected and Numinous Heavenly Worthies of Lingbao, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Highest Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Seven Jeweled Mystic Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace in the Golden Portal of the Jade Metropolis, the Perfected and Illustrious Sovereign of Lingbao, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center, the Northern Culmen Emperor, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Nine Heavens’ True Lords of Life Mandate, the Nine Heavens’ Messenger True Lords, and all the numinous officials of the Three Realms."*

We have heard that the Great Dao is nameless, yet we reluctantly invoke its ineffable teachings.
The Heavenly Worthy manifested in the world to uniquely open the gate of the Orthodox Dharma.

Thus the Jade Measures are proclaimed and the Golden Precepts unfold transformation. Since the path of supplication is established, the mechanism of responsive resonance is thereby revealed. We disciples, having received our learning through our masters, have presumptuously transmitted these rites. For all who turn in faith toward the Dao, it is necessary to display images and manifest dignified presence. To guide sincere devotion, we first present our written petitions. Next, the petitions are read—all as set forth in the memorial, that the sagely Dao may be made known.

We prostrate ourselves and reverently reflect: the Most High Three Worthies shed their radiant light in witness, O fasting master and disciples. We have heard that the Mysterious Origin established teachings ever skillful in delivering humankind. The true wind of the Most High, vast in compassion, extends to all beings. It delivers those of earnest heart to blessed goodness, and receives those who turn toward adornment and reverence. When we received the Dharma, we were bound by its graded progression. We meditate upon the Jade Thearch in reverent posture, and pray for the true sages to descend and attend. Now, therefore, we burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Spontaneous Heavenly Worthy, beseeching that the Dao altar be graced with presence and receive these offerings. May You heed our petition and bestow Your luminous grace, that the fasting master and disciple, so-and-so, may attain perfect fruition of blessings and accomplish merit. May past transgressions be repented, and future good fortune be sought. May household and kin enjoy peace, and public and private affairs flourish. May the nine ancestral lines and seven generations partake in the merit and roam freely; may the local earth gods and dragon spirits receive the numinous favor and lend their protection. Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtue of the Perfected and True. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless and unite with the Dao as true reality.

Next, the obeisance to the directions.
Next, the confession.

We prostrate ourselves and have heard: the Great Dao is reluctantly named, and the Heavenly Worthy answers to the title. Enthroned above the Golden Portal and Jade Metropolis, You behold the ten directions and the three realms. You illumine all beings with the light of sun and moon, and nourish all creatures with the qi of the four seasons. To all who make supplication, You respond according to their wishes. At this time, the fasting master and disciple, so-and-so, humbly present this vermilion memorial, revealing it to the Mysterious Master. We request the establishment of a Dao altar and the performance of the fasting rites. We pray for the true ones to be invoked and descend to the incense banquet. We bow our heads to the Heavenly Worthy and take refuge in repentance.

We fear that from beginningless kalpas until now, the disciple, so-and-so, together with parents, ancestors, and all kin, have committed the three karmic offenses of body, speech, and mind, amassing the three thousand transgressions; the six senses have become the six thieves of wrongdoing. In this life and in past existences, sins and faults abound. Today, in establishing this fast and repenting, we reverently worship the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. May our sins be extinguished and blessings arise; may transgressions vanish and faults cease. May our years return to virtuous longevity, and our lives be prolonged and flourish. May the nine ancestors ascend to heaven, and the entire household enjoy prosperity. May misfortune sink before it appears, and fortune arise anew. We bow our heads and take refuge in the Orthodox Three Treasures.

Next, the Threefold Invocation and Hymn.
Next, the Threefold Obeisance.
Next, the Recitation of Names and Titles.

We, the ritual officers of duly ordained rank, most reverently and solemnly address our supplication to the Supreme Boundless Dao, the Most High Dao Lord; the Most High Lord Lao; the August Jade Emperor on High; the Supreme Mysterious Elder; the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao; the Perfected, Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center; the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; and all the majestic numina of the Three Realms’ official retinues.

We, your servants, have received the transmission of scriptures and registers from our masters, donning the robes of our lineage. First, we pledge to establish fasts in the dusty world and perpetually turn the Wheel of the Dharma. Thereafter, we dedicate ourselves to cultivating the Real, preserving the Three and guarding the One. Whenever beings of the human and heavenly realms seek deliverance, we must adhere to the prescribed rituals. We prepare and disclose the altar precincts, adorn and array the sacred images, and fully present the intent of this fast, submitting our petition for celestial audience. The patron’s petition has already been recited aloud. Alongside the ritual offerings, we now unfold our plea in hope of grace.

We prostrate ourselves in awe of the Supreme Void Emperor, the Self-So Venerable Lord, who gazes upon the azure vault with divine regard and illumines the sincere crimson hearts of those who supplicate. May the merit of this fast be perfectly accomplished in its entirety, and may the fruits of blessings be fully bestowed with manifest clarity. May the radiant grace of boundless kindness dispel ten thousand calamities, and may the descent of numinous beneficence dissolve a thousand disasters and utterly extinguish them.

We humbly pray that the fast’s patron may enjoy bodily peace and destiny’s prosperity, with fortune and emolument ever increasing in glory. May all family members—women and men alike—be endowed with luminous longevity. May the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, along with the three generations of household ancestors, receive the fast’s blessings and roam freely, each ascending to heaven in sovereign ease. May the dragon deities of the dwelling, the local earth gods, the city gods, and the numina of temple sanctuaries all partake in the merit of this offering and supplication, and may they each assist in the virtue of good affinities. Thus shall the vast compassion of the Heavenly Worthy on high be made manifest, and the sincerity of our refuge below be duly answered.

Respectfully submitted.

Next, the Ten Recitations.

Next, the Rekindling of the Incense Burner.
Next, the Hymn to the Young Immortals.
Next, the Hymn of Dedication concluded, the dispersal follows the usual rite.

At dawn, the second audience begins.
From the chanting of the *Dao* to the kindling of the incense burner, all proceeds as before, save that the *Incantation for the Guardians of the Sacred* is not recited.

The Most High Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin of the Three *Qi*, the Supreme Lord Lao, summon forth:
From within the bodies of us, your servants, emerge the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Courier Dragon Riders, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Incense Officers—thirty-six of each.

We invoke the local earth gods and territorial deities, the true officials and rightful spirits of this place.
We now burn incense in offering for the Great Dao’s disciple, so-and-so, who has established this half-day wondrous fast of the Numinous Treasure, beseeching grace, repenting sins, entreating blessings, and dispelling calamities.
May the primordial *qi* of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Beings descend and flow into the bodies of us, your servants, and the fast’s sponsor, the disciple.
May our supplication swiftly ascend and reach the presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao’s Jade August Thearch.

Next, each declares his name and rank.

We, your servants, so-and-so and company, with reverent sincerity jointly proclaim:
To the Void and Spontaneous Golden Portal Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;
To the Supreme Lord Lao;
To the August Jade Thearch on High;
To the Ten Directions’ Great Holy Assemblies who have attained the Dao;
To the Perfected and Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies;
To the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs;
To the Jade Void Supreme Thearch;
To the Jade Thearch and Great Thearch;
To the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, and the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Seven Jeweled Mystic Terrace in the Jade Capital and Golden Portal;
To the Perfected and Numinous Radiant August Lord of the Dao;
To the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center;
To the Northern Culmen Thearch;
To the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water;
To the Nine Heavens’ Controller of Destiny Perfected Lords;
To the Nine Heavens’ Messenger Perfected Lords;
To all the mighty numina of the Three Realms’ palatial retinue.

We have heard:
The Great Net is empty and still, its midst divided into the Nine Voids.
It encompasses the myriad heavens, yet alone attains the ultimate of the Dharma King.
The Dharma Wheel turns in the heavens above, the true teachings flow among humankind.
The Precious Lineage is transmitted in succession, the Mystic Wind spreads far and wide.
The Jade Statutes of the Nine Perfected are established, the Golden Precepts of the Seven Sages are cultivated.
Through this fast’s petitions, we enter the gate of the Dharma’s rites.
Thus have we, your servants, early received our masters’ teachings, received registers, and transmitted scriptures.
First, we nurture the mind of salvation and deliverance, answering the prayers of humans and gods.
Having received the memorial, we now duly present it for your hearing.

Next, the memorial is read.
As set forth in the memorial, may the Mystic Insight deign to take note.
We prostrate ourselves, trusting that the Three Supreme Worthies’ sagely compassion will illumine and regard our earnest supplication, bestowing undeserved grace.
We, your servants, having purified body and mind, reverently perform this invocation.
May the true sages descend from the Nine Heavens above, and the Heavenly Worthies be venerated within the Ten Poles.
The fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, has prepared incense and flowers, solemnly arraying the offerings.
Now, as the golden cock crows at dawn and the jade clepsydra nears its end,
we unfold this rite’s majesty, conducting the Dao in accordance with the Three Times.
We beseech grace with devotion, entreat blessings with diligence.
Having presented the first incense, we first offer the longevity of Yao’s virtue.
As we kindle this first pinch of incense, we offer it to the Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.
May this merit be first dedicated to the benefit of His Majesty, the present Emperor.
We prostrate ourselves, praying:
May his precious throne endure as long as heaven, his august position last as long as earth.
May his sagely brilliance equal the sun and moon’s radiance, his imperial transformation parallel that of Tang and Yu.
May he share the Northern Asterism’s virtue, his southern-facing rule shine forever.
May he ride the luminous destiny for a thousand years, spreading the fragrant breeze across ten thousand lands.
May the princes and imperial sons be as steadfast as bedrock.
May the generals, ministers, and feudal lords secure and pacify the altars of state.
May the times be abundant, customs prosperous, the realm at peace.
May no disasters arise, the people be secure, and all things flourish.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue and power of our revered masters, the great sages and perfected beings, that after attaining the Dao, they may ascend into formlessness and unite with the Dao in truth.

We are told that the twin offerings of incense and flowers rise and sway before the Three Clarities; that blessings manifest in the present, their fragrance reaching back to purify nine generations of ancestors. The households that accumulate goodness first honor their forebears, and their descendants inherit the overflowing blessings of remembrance.

We now offer this second pinch of incense, dedicating it to the Most High Perfected Realm of the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Sovereign. May this merit be respectfully presented for the sake of the host of this ritual, their nine generations of ancestors, sevenfold lineage, and three generations of family forebears. We humbly fear that our parents, bound by karmic conditions, have committed manifold transgressions, yet to escape the three evil destinies, the five sufferings, or the sins of sinking into ten thousand kalpas of perdition. We pray that, by virtue of this repentance, all may be cleansed and absolved. May they dwell in realms adorned with crowns and sashes, in heavens of carefree ease. May blessings shade the household, and descendants shine in glory.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue and power of our revered masters, the great sages and perfected beings, that after attaining the Dao, they may ascend into formlessness and unite with the Dao in truth.

We are told that the triple offering of finest incense reaches the golden palaces of devout hearts; that its fragrant smoke scatters jade-like blossoms, filling the ten directions in offering. The time for seeking blessings must surely bring response; the fruits of supplication will surely evoke resonance.

We now offer this third pinch of incense, dedicating it to the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Realm, the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Ultimate. May this merit be respectfully employed for preservation. For the host of this ritual, we humbly pray that the true numina descend in protection, dispelling the three disasters of the world; that the qi of the Dao guard and sustain, delivering humanity from the nine calamities. May past transgressions be pardoned, future offenses forgiven. May lifespan be extended, years of life prolonged. May fortune and emolument bring joy in all four seasons, and official glory attain the highest ranks. May all kin, male and female, enjoy health and peace. May the land rejoice in the labors of farming and sericulture, and the markets abound with the wealth of a hundred goods. May the earth gods and dragon spirits together lend their hidden support.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue and power of our revered masters, the great sages and perfected beings, that after attaining the Dao, they may ascend into formlessness and unite with the Dao in truth.

Next, we pay homage to the directions.
Next, we perform repentance.

I have heard that when the Jade Emperor assumes his august throne, even the most solemn demeanor is but a humble guise. His vast compassion makes heaven and earth perfectly responsive, and his boundless forgiveness grants the gods their expedient means. All sentient beings who commit transgressions may dissolve them through repentance; long-accumulated faults, once confessed, are all wiped clean as snow.

Now, the fasting master and disciple [Name] takes refuge in the Great Dao and reverently observes this pure fast. Bowing his head to the Heavenly Worthy, he surrenders his life in repentance, fearing that the six senses have given rise to offenses and the three karmic actions have become transgressions. He dreads the calamities of this world and fears the nine perils of mortal existence. Moreover, he fears that past-life misdeeds may now bring retribution, that the taking of life and killing of beings may have created karmic creditors and enemies. From countless kalpas past, from parents and kindred, the roots of immeasurable sins are too numerous to fully declare.

Today, in establishing this fast, he repents with utmost sincerity, reverently paying homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Boundless, the Most High, and the Numinous Treasure. He beseeches the forgiveness of a thousand faults and ten thousand sins, of deep-seated offenses and grievous enmities, that the blazing sun of grace and majesty may melt them like frost and snow. May his years be filled with increasing virtue and goodness, and may he daily be spared from misfortune and calamity. May his household enjoy peace and well-being, and may his person be blessed with prosperity. May his departed ancestors attain the good fruit and roam freely; may the earth gods and dragon spirits protect both public and private realms with purity and auspiciousness. May disasters sink into the nine nights, and may blessings arise from the ten directions.

Bowing his head, he takes refuge in the Orthodox and True Three Treasures.

Next, the Three Petitions are presented, with the solemn recitation of names and titles as before.

Your humble servants [Names] now reverently submit this petition, addressing the Most High, Boundless, and Perfectly True Jade Emperor of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the True Lords and Envoys of the Nine Heavens; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center; and all the numinous officials of the Three Realms.

I have heard that the majesty of the Dao and its virtue is so towering that its myriad wonders cannot be fathomed, and that the vastness of the Dragon Han kalpa is such that the true cannot be distinguished. When the Heavenly Worthy descended his decree from the Floating Radiance Heaven, the realm of the Dharma Wheel was set in motion. First transmitted in the heavens, it gradually descended to the human world. Master and disciple passed it down, and the Dharma teachings spread ever wider.

Having received these luminous instructions, I assist in promoting the true wind. First, I aspire to extend compassion to the world; later, I dedicate myself to the path of cultivation. Whenever there are matters of human or heavenly petition, it is necessary to establish an altar. The Most High is invoked within the Dharma assembly, and petitions are composed and presented. The intent of the fast is declared, making it known on high.

The written petition of the fasting master has already been revealed. We humbly beseech the Jade Emperor, the Great Dao, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal to cast their merciful gaze upon this sincere offering and to hear the proclamation of this petition. We earnestly pray that the fasting master [Name] be absolved of the karmic obstacles of this present life and that past transgressions be dissolved. May he be granted the mysterious grace of the Eight Effulgences and inscribed with the virtuous blessings of the Nine Heavens. May his emolument be extended by the Southern Dipper and his lifespan increased by the Eastern Flower. May his household enjoy peace, and may each member’s years be prolonged. May the three calamities be averted in the months and years, and the nine perils dispelled from his fate. Moreover, we pray that the spiritual forms of his seven ancestors and the consciousness of his departed kin, along with all those aided by this retrospective merit, may together receive the benefit of liberation. May each attain freedom and rebirth, dwelling eternally in joyous abodes.

May the dragon spirits, the prohibitions of the earth, the city gods, the tutelary deities, and the numinous spirits of the temple sanctums all share in the grace of this petition and together exert their protective power. Thus, the vast compassion of the Heavenly Worthies on high will be made manifest, and the sincerity of our surrender below will be duly answered.

Respectfully submitted.

Next, the Twelve Vows are dispersed as in the usual rite.

At the third morning audience of the Si hour, the recitation proceeds from "The Dao is sung" to the "Incense Offering," following the previous method, omitting only the invocation of the Guardian Deities of the Numinous.

To the Most High Three Heavens, the Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin, the Supreme Lord Lao:

Summon forth from within the bodies of us, your servants, the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Fragrance-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Fragrance Officials of the Five Thearchs on duty for the day—thirty-six of each—let them emerge.

Notify the local earth deities and the true officials of this domain.

We now burn incense in this very moment, offering it on behalf of the disciple of the Great Dao, [Name], who is conducting the wondrous half-day fast of the Numinous Treasure, performing the threefold Dao-cultivation to pray for grace, repent sins, seek blessings, and dispel calamities.

May the Primordial Qi of the Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our petition may swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the Supreme Jade Thearch, the August Emperor of the Boundless and Utmost Real.

Next, each declares their name and rank.

With reverent sincerity, we, your servants of the dharma-rank, jointly submit this petition to the Supreme Void Sovereign, the Golden Gate Heavenly Worthy; the Supreme True August Worthy of the Boundless Heaven; the August Jade Thearch of the Supreme Ultimate Heaven; the Supreme Jade Clarity Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Mysterious Origin Lord Lao; the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao; the Utmost Real Lords and Masters; the Thirty-Three Heavenly Emperors; the Jade Void Highest Thearch; the Great Jade Emperor; the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern True Realms; the Seven-Treasured Mystic Terrace of the Jade Capital and Golden Gate; the Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace; the Numinous Treasure Utmost Real Radiant August Lord of the Dao; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the True Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Life Mandate; the True Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Envoys; the Northern Culmen Great Emperor; the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; and all the true numina of the Three Realms, the named mountains, and the grotto-heavens.

We have heard that before the vast emptiness, there was nothing in the void. Yet once the Qi of spontaneity coalesced, it was forcibly named the Great Dao. Thus, the undifferentiated dispersed and the elements separated, giving rise to heaven and earth. The wondrous preceded the manifest, and the numinous brought forth great illumination. Emperors were established, and the Three Dukes appointed; masters and disciples emerged to propagate the teachings. From this, true scriptures descended to the world, and precepts and regulations were proclaimed. Amidst the boundless sea of desire, they became boats and oars; upon the vast river of attachment, they served as bridges. They rescued sentient beings from the gate of the Eight Sufferings and delivered them from the calamities of the Three Disasters. The fasts were widely established to specially aid humans and devas. We, though unworthy, hold office in the mysterious precepts and are charged with spreading these vows. Whatever is requested with sincere faith is presented in full through the written petition.

Next, the petition is read.

As fully set forth in the petition, the circumstances and reasons are thoroughly stated. The host of sages has already heard; we earnestly beseech with utmost devotion.

We humbly implore the Great Dao of the Void Sovereign, the Most High Compassionate Worthy, to perceive the minds of the worldly and deign to heed our plea.

We have heard that the Heavenly Worthy, though quiescent and unmoving, manifests form within the Three Realms; the mysterious virtue, responsive to feelings, answers the prayers of all beings. The disciple [Name], master of the fast, specially employs this ritual to reverently address the true numina. The rising incense wafts like drifting blossoms; the offerings are set forth as fragrant delicacies. We, your servants, reverently perform this petition, hoping it may reach the heavens above. Having received the grace of illumination, protective power will surely descend.

With the first pinch of incense, we offer it to the Golden Gate Heavenly Worthy of the Vast and Empty Great Dao.

May this merit be dedicated first to the master of the fast, and secondly to the present Emperor, may he live ten thousand years. We humbly pray that his sacred person may endure for myriad ages, his precious throne for countless springs; that his great brightness may equal the sun and moon, his eternal longevity match heaven and earth. Governing with effortless grace, he may fathom the mysteries of the unseen; ruling with serene dignity, he may harmonize the felicitations of the Hua Hills. May the imperial princes and sons shine like jade trees in the dragon towers; may the civil and military ministers illuminate their meritorious names upon the Unicorn Pavilion. May the balmy breeze spread far, and the pure transformation flow widely. May the realm know peace, the people health, and customs abundance.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts, the Utmost Real and True.

After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless and unite with the Dao in truth.

We have heard that the power of the Dao is formless, and merit is but a forced name. Yet the heavy sins of life and death can be dissolved through dedication. It is fitting to hold the second pinch of incense and dispel the sufferings of the Nine Ancestries.

With the second pinch of incense, we offer it to the Host of Sages of the Boundless Great Dao.

May this merit be dedicated to the family of the master of the fast, to the departed and transformed ancestors, the seven generations of forebears, the nine lineages of ancestry, the three generations of souls, and all the clan members. We humbly pray that the sufferings of the Three Wretched Paths be absolved, and that they ascend to the halls of the Ten Felicities. May they traverse the Eight Effulgences with ease and attain the Six Penetrations in freedom. May they face the True Emperor and behold the Dharma King. May blessings extend to the living, and felicity flow endlessly.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Hosts, the Utmost Real and True.

After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless and unite with the Dao in truth.

We have heard that the wondrous form of the Heavenly Worthy is adorned through the forms of the mundane; the formless Great Dao establishes teachings through the minds of the worldly. To descend the blessings of the Nine Heavens, it is fitting to raise the third pinch of incense.

With the third pinch of incense, we offer it to the Supreme Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Origin Great Dao.

May this merit be dedicated to protecting and sustaining the master of the fast.

We humbly pray that the mysterious grace be bestowed, that the Eastern Florescence may enhance the life span in the Palace of Destiny; that the numinous favor may flow down, and the Southern Dipper extend life in the Station of Emolument. May the Mountain of Longevity rise ever higher, and the Sea of Fortune grow ever deeper. In office, may he attain the highest rank among ministers; in glory, may his splendor illuminate the nine clans. In private life, may he enjoy peace in all his movements; throughout the year, may his years and destiny know health and prosperity. May all members of his household, high and low, male and female, each emulate the integrity of pine and bamboo, their countenances as steadfast as metal and stone. May a thousand disasters vanish like clouds with repentance, and ten thousand misfortunes scatter like rain through the fast. May his dwelling be tranquil, his wealth and silk abundant. May silkworms yield eightfold threads, and fields yield ninefold grains. May all endeavors succeed, and markets teem with activity. May even the dark spirits of the Six Paths partake of the remaining blessings.

Here the incense is burned, and I take refuge in the virtue and power of the Most Venerable Masters, the Great Sages, and the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, I ascend into the formless and unite with the Dao in truth.

Next, I bow to the directions.
Next, I confess my transgressions.

I have heard that among the many faults of life, none is greater than yielding to desire; in the birth of the Dao from tranquility, no blessing accumulates more than good affinity. Thus, the Three Calamities arise from the Three Karmas, and the Nine Tribulations follow the Nine Orifices. Since there is the affliction of the Six Roots, the Four Great Elements coalesce into this body. Amidst the vast expanse of birth and death, within the tumult of love and greed, we rely on the weariness of the gods in saving the world, their teachings spreading through many gates. The fast’s dharma is widely proclaimed, rescuing those sunk in delusion.

The patron of this fast takes refuge in the Great Dao and establishes the dharma assembly. Bowing to the Heavenly Worthy, I wholeheartedly confess. I fear that in my past and present lives, in my conduct and deeds, I have accumulated transgressions as deep as the sea and as high as the mountains. Today, I set up this fast to offer repentance, reverently bowing to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Boundless, the Most High, the Numinous Treasure.

I only wish that by the radiant grace of their numinous power, unwarranted disasters and anxieties may be swept away. May my years be enriched with fortune and longevity, renewing my destiny. May I invoke blessings and extend my years. May my seven generations of ancestors, now departed, each attain carefree wandering. May all those present, high and low, enjoy health and peace. May misfortunes dissolve like ice, and blessings flow like rivers. Bowing in refuge, I take the Three Treasures as the true and correct.

Next, the Three Petitions are presented, with the solemn recitation of titles as before.

The officiant, your humble servant [Name], respectfully presents this petition, addressing all the numinous hosts of the assembly.

We, your servants, have inherited residual blessings from past lives and planted the seeds of faith through countless kalpas. Emerging from the dust of desire and affliction, we enter the dharma realm of the true masters. Between heaven and earth, we are successively uplifted. Who can discern the false from the true, or fathom the comings and goings of the ordinary and the sacred? The wondrous scriptures of immortals, the teachings, precepts, and rituals—first, they expand the heart of salvation for the world; later, they guide the path of cultivation. Whenever humans and gods seek blessings, it is necessary to report to the dharma assembly. We invoke the August Emperor in the vastness of the void and descend the Most High into the altar.

Now, the patron [Name] has prepared this petition and established this wondrous fast. Having already presented the Three Petitions, we hope to fulfill the complete rites. We offer incense, flowers, lamps, candles, fruits, and delicacies with sincerity. Gazing upon the revered images, we pour out our hearts, exhausting worldly sentiments in devotion.

May these merits be dedicated to preserving and upholding [the patron]. The patron [Name] humbly prays: may the mountain of longevity grow taller, and the sea of blessings swell with waves. May his official salary and destiny be as enduring as the pine and cypress, and his years and life be preserved like the tortoise and crane. In office, may he ascend to the highest ranks, ever serving as a senior minister; in private life, may his fortunes flow smoothly, with divine spirits aiding and protecting him. May his dwelling overflow with joy and peace, and his household enjoy safety. May the nine generations of ancestors and the seven generations of forebears, the honored souls of past eras, and all sentient beings attain the ultimate transformation.

Then, the luminous virtue of the Heavenly Worthies above and the sincerity of our devotion below will be in perfect accord.

Respectfully presented for your attention.

Next, the Twelve Vows are dispersed as per the usual rites.
At noon, the morning audience concludes, the dispersal is announced, and the Three Offerings are read aloud. From the singing of the Dao to the lighting of the incense burner, all follows the usual rites.

Next, the titles are recited.

The officiants, your humble servants [Names], with united sincerity, respectfully present this petition to the Most High, Boundless Dao of the Great Clarity, the August Jade Emperor of the Central Yellow, the Nine Lands, the Twelve Immortals, the Lords of the Five Lands, the Nine Palaces, the Eight Trigrams, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Heavenly Offices, the Earthly Prisons, the Generals of the Year Star, the Earth-Soothing Divine Generals, the Four Directions, and all numinous powers.

I have heard that when the celestial principles are fixed, the virtue of earth holds the honored position. The pure floats while the turbid congeals, and the eight directions await their division. The round heavens follow the path of the west’s return, while the square earth flows eastward. The principles of ghosts and spirits manifest the workings of yin and yang; the Five Phases are even more evident, giving birth to all things. From caves and nests to palaces and towers, from the beams above to the eaves below, the transmission of the sacred work of the ancient sages begins; from doors and windows to the carving of openings, the great models of the primordial emperors commence. The sixty jiazi cycles receive their notes from the Five Phases’ transformations; the twelve hours govern the prohibitions of the two dwellings’ directions.

Now, as water overflows and floods, the dwelling must be rebuilt. With earth moved and construction begun, the old is renewed. Fearing transgressions, we present this offering. Humbly, we beseech your permission and, bowing twice, make our request.

Next, the First Offering: incense, tea, and wine are presented.

Your humble servant respectfully petitions the Heavenly Father, the Solar Emperor; the Earthly Mother, the Lunar Deity; the Northern Culmen, the Purple Tenuity, the Five Numinous Ones, the Great Tenuity Emperor; the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper, the Three Terraces, the Nine Luminaries, the Twenty-Eight Constellations; the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; the Nine Earthly Perfected Sovereigns; the Four Controllers, the Five Emperors; the taboos behind the dwelling; the twelve hours; the three hundred and sixty prohibitions; the one hundred and twenty killings of the xun cycle; the city gods of the directions; the Five Phases of the earthly mansion; and all divine spirits.

I now humbly act on behalf of the disciple, whose dwelling requires repair, and thus commands workers to make additions. With much disruption, digging, and excavation, I fear offending the dragon spirits and disturbing the taboos. I present this offering and repentance, arranging incense and lamps. I pray for blessings from the Perfected Ones above and repent for transgressions against the earth below. My earnest pleas are recorded in this plain petition. The disciple’s words shall be respectfully proclaimed.

Next, the petition is read.

As stated in the document, may the profound gaze know all.

I have heard that heaven covers and earth bears, the sun and moon flow with radiance. The stars and constellations move in their courses above, while humans and creatures receive their endowment below. The Five Phases transform, and yin and yang alternate. Only the divine and numinous possess prohibitions and taboos.

Now, [Name] has inherited his ancestral estate and continues the legacy of his forebears. Stationed in a strategic prefecture, governing a commandery, he undertakes works in accordance with his duties. In doing so, he must not avoid the labor of moving earth. Whether digging wells below or raising towers above, adorning halls and constructing courtyards, replacing the old and adding the new, he seeks only to enhance their grandeur. Yet, in digging and excavating, he fears harming the dragon generals; in construction, he worries about offending the divine spirits.

Thus, with reverence for the Daoist gate, we present the prescribed rites. Solemnly conducting the jiao offering, we prepare incense and lamps. Silk banners mark the directions, and wealth pledges sincerity. Silver coins and galloping steeds are presented at each station. Wine and dried meats are offered in flying cups, as if the gods were present.

We humbly invoke the Four Administrations, the Five Emperors, and the True Officials of the Earth Bureau. May they turn their imperial carriages within the Nine Palaces and descend upon the jiao altar across the Ten Lands. Receive our sincere offerings and bestow blessings and grace. Let our kin be free from harm’s dread, and our dwellings know perfect felicity. May all undertakings prosper, and all comings and goings be secure. Let the City Gods of the Five Directions rejoice in their fulfillment.

Bowing again, we make the second offering: incense, tea, and wine.

Your servant respectfully petitions once more the True Numinous Supreme, the Five Earthly Sovereigns, and the Venerable Gods of the Soil. We recall that at the dawn of creation, yin and yang took form. From the age of cave dwellings and nest-like shelters, humanity progressed to the era of capital cities and palatial halls. Everywhere, earth was molded and metal cast, axes hewed wood. Roofbeams rose above, foundations lay below; walls and dikes were raised. Chi You defied the Yellow Emperor, and weapons have since flowed through the ages. The heavens display their signs, the Five Phases transform through the hundred spirits; the earth divides its forms, the Eight Trigrams govern the myriad changes. The twelve palaces of the celestial stems and the sixty cyclical sounds of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches—from these ancient precedents, prohibitions arose in the upper commanderies, and taboos were established.

For all household activities, for the people’s every action, one must first select an auspicious day and hour, aligning with propitious directions. How much more so now, when by imperial decree, we newly assume office in this public hall, undertaking renovations and expansions—digging and excavating, making all resplendent and new. The nine portents of ill fortune are hard to fathom, and harm may befall people and things, filling the household with anxiety. Knowing this, the master of the house follows the Daoist rites of atonement. We conduct the jiao offering to the Five Earthly Virtues of the Five Directions.

We humbly invoke the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, the Twelve Celestial Stems, the Earth Bureau, the City Gods, and the household deities of prohibition. Receive the offerings laid before this dwelling, and accept the sincere prayers of the patron. Bless this home and prosper its lineage. Let silkworms yield their finest threads, and granaries overflow with abundance. May the construction of this dwelling be completed, and all renovations accomplished. May the gods rejoice in their favor and bestow their divine grace.

Bowing again, we make the third offering: incense, tea, and wine.

Your servant respectfully petitions once more the Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother, the Five Earthly Sovereigns, the assembled host of sages, and all divine presences. Your servant, as disciple, conducts this jiao offering to the hundred gods. We give thanks to the Five Emperors and beseech their majestic radiance. Hear these entreaties and permit our atonement. Receive the offerings of the jiao rite, and let the sacred herbs shine forth. Assist and protect this household, that its people may flourish and multiply. Let the gates receive fortune and the windows know joy.

From this jiao offering onward, may the transformations of the Five Emperors proceed in harmony, and the blessings of the Four Spirits be bestowed in order. May the Eight Trigrams bring well-being to the eight seasons, and the Nine Palaces descend with the felicity of the Nine Heavens. May the Grand Year uphold the constant Dao of generation, and the Grand Yin nourish the emoluments of humanity. May the Generals wield their transformative authority, and the Monthly Officers fulfill their task of bestowing good fortune. Let the Azure Dragon and White Tiger display their martial prowess at the gates; let the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior illuminate literary brilliance at the windows. May the Jade Hall and Golden Treasury, the Celestial Virtue and Bright Hall, long attract the noble and wealthy, and forever safeguard the household’s prosperity.

Now, we hang the precious mirror in the four directions and place the star knives in the five. They illuminate the twelve true gods and repel the malevolent spirits of the sixteen directions. Five-colored silks pledge the Five Dragons; five kinds of coins are offered to the Five Emperors. We present this jiao offering to atone before the hundred gods.

We humbly beseech the assembled divine host to deign to witness and protect. Guard each direction and bestow perpetual good fortune. Let misfortune depart and blessings return; let calamities vanish and goodness gather. Bring well-being to people and prosperity to the household. For those in office, let emoluments and honors ascend; for those in private life, let all desires be fulfilled. May the Star of Fortune shine upon us, and all transgressions be purged. Let the dwelling radiate light, and the household abide in harmony. Through embroidered windows and painted doors, may the joyous qi of the four seasons ever fill; in fragrant halls, may the auspicious sounds of the eight festivals resound.

Then, when we dig and build, may the four directions know no disaster. May the entire household enjoy timely peace and prosperity. Let no pestilence arise, and no fear of wind or fire disturb us. May granaries and storehouses be well-stocked, with no loss or dissipation. We atone before the unseen powers this evening and leave blessings for this moment. The offered coins and paper money are now burned.

Your servant and disciples bow again in farewell.

The Lingbao Half-Day Purification Rite is now complete.
