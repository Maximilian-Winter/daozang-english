**Golden Talisman Great Fast and Alliance Rites**
*High Functionary Ascends the Seat*
*Opening the Hall and Rite Matters*

*Taking Incense and Praying:*
This incense drifts through the *Lihuang* [1] realm within,
In the *Yujing* [2] mountains, where eons of condensed *qi* form its smoke—
A hundred thousand sincere hearts unite in faith.
Roots entwined like *qian* vines, filling the *zhan* sandalwood groves.

A single incense stick burns in the treasure censer—
To the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the Ten Extremes, the Ten Glories,
To the Supreme Daoist Scripture Teachers of the Ten Directions and Three Worlds,
To the myriad true ones and spirits of the Golden Talisman Great Fast altar,
The responsive Sovereign of the Rite.

May the Dragon-Chariot and Phoenix-Carriage descend,
Flying through the void, stepping upon the empty—
Descending to this Daoist hall,
Manifesting the merit of the Alliance.

*Silence Descends*

The Dao’s path is high, not easily ascended—
Yet now we approach the middle vehicle.

If one knows the *Yuan Shi* [3] suspended the pearl of origin,
Then from *Biluo* [4] and *Lihuang*, ascent begins anew.

For the essence of the Supreme Dao is profound and obscure;
Its utmost reaches are dim and silent.
It exists before the *Taiji* [5], beyond *Xiyi* [6].
It cannot be sought through form, appearance, sound, or color,
Nor measured by shape, name, or numerology.
Without knowing, yet knowing all;
Without action, yet accomplishing all.

Thus, the ancient *zhi ren* [7] who embodied this Dao
Could not be found through form, appearance, sound, or color,
Nor measured by shape, name, or numerology.
In the profound obscurity, they alone saw and knew;
In the dim silence, they alone heard and understood.
As their true essence accumulated over time,
Their harmony spread, their responses resonated—
When moving heaven and earth, the upper and lower realms responded in trust;
When influencing spirits and gods, the *chōngliè* [8] answered in kind.
For blessings, auspiciousness, banishing calamities, rescuing the submerged,
Driving away evil and pestilence—
No request was unfulfilled.

Then, how did these *zhi ren* attain such power?
There must be a method to achieve this.

The method is none other than the **Fast (Zhai)**.
The Fast has inner and outer forms—let us expound upon both.

**Inner Fast** is tranquility and stillness, soaring with the Dao.
Long ago, Confucius taught *xin zhai* [9] to Yan Hui—
This is of the same kind.

**Outer Fast** involves ascending the altar, stepping upon the void,
Burning incense and confessing—
A remnant of the ancient rites of prayer, sacrifice, and worship.

The Fast, as recorded in Daoist texts, comprises **twenty-seven grades**,
All originating from the *Lingbao* [10] tradition.

1. *Tai Zhen Fast* (Great True Fast),
2. *Shang Qing Fast* (Upper Clarity Fast),
3. *Da Dong Fast* (Great Cavern Fast),
4. *Jin Fang Fast* (Golden Chamber Fast)—
These four Fasts require no human intervention;
They align with Heaven—**the Inner Fast**.

5. *Tai Yi Fast* (Great Unity Fast),
6. *Jiu Tian Fast* (Nine Heavens Fast),
7. *Jin Lu Fast* (Golden Talisman Fast),
8. *Yu Lu Fast* (Jade Talisman Fast),
9. *Meng Zhen Fast* (Alliance of the True)—
These five Fasts may only be practiced by the Son of Heaven;
Commoners may not partake.

10. *Huang Lu Fast* (Yellow Talisman Fast),
11. *Dong Shen Fast* (Cavern Spirit Fast),
12. *Ziran Fast* (Natural Fast),
13. *San Yuan Fast* (Three Primordials Fast),
14. *Tu Tan Fast* (Coating and Refining Fast),
15. *Ba Du Fast* (Rescue and Degree Fast),
16. *Dong Yuan Fast* (Cavern Abyss Fast),
17. *Tian Bao Fast* (Heavenly Treasure Fast),
18. *Jiu You Fast* (Nine Shadows Fast),
19. *Wu Lian Fast* (Five Refining Fast),
20. *Zheng Yi Fast* (Upright Unity Fast),
21. *Tai Ping Fast* (Great Peace Fast),
22. *San Huang Fast* (Three Sovereigns Fast),
23. *Ba Di Fast* (Eight Emperors Fast),
24. *Bei Di Fast* (Northern Sovereign Fast),
25. *Zhi Jiao Fast* (Edict Teaching Fast),
26. *Jie Kao Fast* (Examination and Punishment Fast),
27. *Hua Hu Fast* (Transformation of the Barbarians Fast)—
These eighteen Fasts each have their proper use;
Commoners may practice them without restriction.

From the *Tai Yi Fast* downward, the twenty-two are **Outer Fasts**,
All with prescribed rites and regulations, recorded in the Canon.
Though their arrangements differ, their essence remains within the *Lingbao* framework.

Thus, the Highest Venerable Laozi said:
*"Of all Daoist priorities, none surpass the Fast."*
Though many Fasts exist, great in similarity and small in difference,
Their merit is profound—
Truly able to connect the upper and lower,
Returning to the Supreme Vehicle.

Their rites and disciplines total **two hundred forty conditions**,
Secreted within the *San Yuan Gong* [11].
Now, the essentials are outlined for later generations.

From this, it is clear:
To move heaven and earth, influence spirits and gods,
Bring blessings to the realm, rescue the hidden and manifest—
What other means suffice?

The essence of the Fast lies in **sincerity, reverence, single-minded devotion, and meticulous preparation**.
Those who ascend the Fast must cultivate **serene emptiness, unity of purpose, adherence to tradition, and perfect observance of rites**.
Should any be lacking, the *Xuan Du* [12] Register of Offenses awaits—
The Master’s intent is plain to see.

Only when outward and inward align,
When all is in harmony, can the High True Ones be moved,
Bearing auspicious omens and blessings.
Yet these trifles are insufficient for our Daoist path.

Consider the greater truth:
*"It is the person who expands the Dao, not the Dao that expands the person."*

The Fast originated with the *Xuan Yi San Zhenren* [13],
Transmitted to *Ge Xian Gong* [14] of the *Tai Ji*,
And through successive transmissions, branches and schools emerged.
Practice it, and one ascends in broad daylight to the Three Realms of the Morning Guests.
Recorded in scriptures beyond count—
Is this not the effect of the person expanding the Dao?

Now, with reverence for imperial edicts,
We establish the Great Fast,
Praying for eternal celestial mandate,
Gathering auspiciousness and longevity.
Our duty is to propagate this rite—
How dare we neglect our efforts?

Especially for the altar assembly:
Let the heart be one with the Dao.
In harmony and reverence, steadfast from beginning to end,
Ascending and descending as though in the Sovereign’s presence—
Then the interaction of heaven and humanity remains unblemished.
Is this not sublime?
