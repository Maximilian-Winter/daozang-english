**Ritual of the Jade Register for Delivering the Suffering and Judging the Obscure**

**Invocation of the Deities**
We, your humble servants in office, together with utmost sincerity, reverently invoke and supplicate the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the Ten Loftiest and Ten Radiant Supreme Saints, the Most Compassionate Great Unity Savior of Suffering Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Ultimate Palace, the Azure Sovereign of the Blue Empyrean, the Heavenly Worthies of all Heavens, the Heavenly Emperors of all Heavens, the Supreme Perfected Immortals of the Great Luo Dharma Realm, and all true lords of the Three Realms and the myriad spirits.

May your celestial compassion turn and illumine us with your luminous gaze.

**Declaration of Intent**
We humbly submit: the waxing and waning of the primordial qi gives rise to the emergence and submergence of the myriad forms. Death returns to life, and life returns to death; humans become ghosts, and ghosts become humans. The wheel turns endlessly, and retribution ceases not. There is no sorrow greater than that of the Six Paths, no suffering more bitter than that of the Four Births. Those who accumulate goodness ascend directly the steps of virtue; those who accumulate evil ultimately return to the evil destinies.

By the grace of our Dao Ancestor, the Most High Compassionate Venerable, vast ritual ordinances have been established, and universal deliverance has been widely bestowed. Great assemblies for transcendence and ascent have been inaugurated, and special salvific scriptures have been revealed. At the juncture when yin is grim and yang expansive, when spirits commune and ghosts gather, the stirring of ethereal qi gives rise to mournful winds, and the issuing of numinous sounds causes the affairs of the netherworld to mist over. At the first resonant intonation, the dark earth afar hears it.

We look up to the Purple Ultimate Mystic Venerable and the Azure Radiance Patriarch. They designate the Bright Star as the torch of wisdom, widely extending its illumination; they condense the qi of Brahman into a dharma bridge, greatly bestowing deliverance. The messengers who pursue souls proclaim the summons to the ten directions. The local earth deities are charged with hastening and urging them forth.

May the paths of the Heavenly Immortals, the Divine Spirits, the Human Relations, the Hell Dwellers, the Hungry Ghosts, and the Animal Beings, along with all living creatures—fish, turtles, insects, and crawling things—be universally informed in the blink of an eye, their high and deep realms pervaded, their distant and near reaches encompassed in an instant. Thus, all come to know, their minds naturally moved; their sincerity and reverence stirred, their shadows follow and their echoes respond. Calling the many and leading the masses, voices resonate and qi seeks its kind. Emerging from death and entering life, the blind see and the lame walk. Unobstructed and unimpeded, they come forth in an unbroken stream; some lagging, some leading, they arrive in measured pace. The messengers exert their power of summoning, and the souls, in turn, receive the merit of the call.

All the pure incantations of Fengdu, the Path of Karmic Deeds, and the Departure from the Cold Court shall be reverently chanted.

Those who study the Dao and cultivate perfection take compassion for all beings as their heart; those who accumulate merit and amass virtuous deeds take benefiting and delivering the myriad beings as their foundation. They often perform scriptural rites for salvation and constantly engage in recitation and devotion to cultivate reverence. Through the grace of the dharma, they necessarily hope for the response of the sages.

On this day of fasting and purification, we have summoned companions of refined cultivation to establish this wondrous assembly of merit and offer fragrant viands in worship. We humbly act on behalf of the obscured souls yet to receive extraordinary grace, still entangled in the obstacles of sin, and unable to escape the wheel of suffering. Mindful of their embodied existence, we set forth this offering of food.

We look up to the Earth Deities of the Nine Provinces and the Divine Officials of the Five Peaks, beseeching them to deign to bear witness and extend their compassionate pity.

We reverently pray that, gazing afar toward the immortal palaces, we may supplicate the August Emperor of the Void Heavens, that he may greatly extend celestial grace and bend to bestow compassionate regard. Throughout the expanse within heaven and earth, we broadly invite those from ancient times to the present. By the power of your majestic radiance, we specially present this petition for summoning and reception.

**Summoning the Lonely and Receiving the Lost**

**Purifying Forms, Sprinkling Purity, Taking the Three Refuges**

Thus do the hungry ghosts of the dark paths and the sunken souls of the eternal night fill the empty void, wandering through the realms of the earth. Ever they sigh in the crooked ways, their faces forever gaunt with hunger. There are also those long-dead corpses buried for kalpas, their lingering spirits bound for years—now dim, now bright between dawn and dusk, their forms ever defiled and foul. They have not yet transcended the gate of liberation, still entangled in the mire of suffering. Some were torn from parents in swaddling clothes, others parted forever from children in old age; some perished in the throes of illness, others met their end as travelers in distant lands; some bore the weight of crimes and fell to royal law, others were suddenly claimed by impermanence; some succumbed to pestilence, others were struck down by thunder; some were murdered, others hanged themselves; some were mauled by tigers in the mountains, others devoured by fish and dragons in the rivers; some died in childbirth, others from snakebite or poison; some languish in the dark paths with long-held grievances, others, wrongfully slain, have not escaped the ghostly realm.

Though they yearn for libations, they never meet with food or drink. Smoke rises from their bellies, fire blazes in their throats. Forever they endure the torment of hunger and want, never finding satiety. In vain they grieve as hares run and crows fly, as time passes and years turn in darkness. Separated from their homes and towns, they long for kin yet cannot find them; cut off by mist and waves, they sigh for loved ones beyond reach. All belong to the jurisdiction of their native lands, yet have no graves to call their own. The bright moon stretches endlessly, sorrowful clouds spread boundlessly.

All lonely souls, all bound spirits—none have found the path to ascension, their hearts still entangled in affliction. They lament the wheel of the six destinies, mourn the flight and scurry of the four births. All day their bodies are trapped in snares, all morning their gall trembles at the net. Some fold their wings and tuck their feathers in forest nests; some, with fangs and fur, dwell in earthen dens; some, with horns and hooves, roam the marshes; others, with scales and armor, lurk in pools and deeps. Facing cauldrons, how can they escape the boil? Confronting blades, how can they flee the torment?

All this is the result of past misdeeds, the consequence of accumulated evil. There are one hundred and twenty underworld courts, eighty-four thousand hells, the prisons of the Three Officials, the grievance-cells of the Five Peaks. The Northern Capital’s eternal-night court, the Eastern Peak’s dark-locked palace. The Upper Corpse, Middle Corpse, and Lower Corpse—realms of the Three Paths; the paths of death, evil, and crookedness—gates of the Five Sufferings. Then there are the hells of iron houses and iron mountains, iron oxen and iron horses, two stones crushing the body, the Eight Cold Hells of the Eight Extremes, the hells of severance and separation, of scorching and flaying. In such great hells as these, for kalpas upon kalpas, life after life, there is no door to escape death, no path to seek rebirth. The knife-mountains loom perilously, the sword-trees stand in dense array. They eat fire and swallow smoke, never free from searing torment day or night; flying spears and drifting halberds rend their flesh, how can they bear such agony? They have not yet left the path of carrying stones, yet deeply suffer the toil of bearing mountains. Upon the vast river of love, black waves engulf them; in the deep sea of suffering, silver waves fill their eyes. In vain they yearn for the flourishing world, how pitiable their solitude in the Yellow Springs.

All this stems from the reckless hearts of past lives, bringing such retribution upon their present forms. We now convene this assembly of incense and cultivation, offering this rite of reverence. We humbly pray that the Supreme Dao extend its compassion, that the exalted immortals open the way to deliverance. May even the prison cells and river sources be reached, all attaining spiritual resonance and looking up to salvation. By the sacred names inscribed in jade caskets, the august titles proclaimed from divine scrolls—those who have never heard the Heavenly Worthy may now hear; those who have never encountered the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy may now encounter it. By this merit, they may transcend the ghostly path, and through these offerings, ascend the immortal ranks.

Let all now take refuge and listen attentively:

**Great Compassion, Boundless Heavenly Worthy,**
**Sacred Power, Limitless Heavenly Worthy,**
**Dispeller of Evil Realms, Heavenly Worthy,**
**Attainer of Mystic Merit, Heavenly Worthy,**
**Refining the Dead, Heavenly Worthy,**
**Secretly Communing with the Immortal Dao, Heavenly Worthy,**
**Dissolving Sins in the Northern Palace, Heavenly Worthy,**
**Inscribing Names in the Southern Palace, Heavenly Worthy,**
**Radiant Mystic Dao, Heavenly Worthy,**
**Ascending the Great Void, Heavenly Worthy.**

We reverently invoke your sacred power, your vast compassion that delivers all. Thus may the river of love and sea of suffering transform into a lotus pond; may sword-trees and knife-mountains become flower gardens. The icy pools, once bitterly cold, swiftly melt away; the boiling cauldrons, once seething, are instantly extinguished. We rely on the wondrous creation of the Primordial Mystery, the good affinity of virtue and power.

Now the lamps and candles are lit, their brilliance illuminating the underworld; sandalwood and aloes are kindled, their fragrant smoke rising and spreading through the ten directions. To emerge from the depths, they must rely on great creation. We offer them food and drink, present them with money and treasures. We beseech the Four Departments and Six Palaces to record good deeds and erase evil; the Three Origins and Nine Courts, the yin officials and yang administrators, to look upon sentient beings with compassion and broadly bestow salvation. Above, we pray for sagely grace; below, we spread numinous mercy. May a single taste become a hundred delicacies, a single coin become a thousand carts of treasure. May it reach all infinite worlds, showering boundless ghosts and spirits.

We humbly hope you will descend in bodily form and partake of these offerings. Thus may their hollow bellies be filled, their starving stomachs satisfied. Let each turn their body and mind, swiftly directing their merit. By past affinities and former kalpas, they receive the aid of the true wind; on this night, at this hour, they savor the sweet dew of fragrant offerings. Secretly we sprinkle the rain of compassion, washing away stains; broadly we blow the wind of liberation, sweeping away transgressions. May all rejoice, receiving blessings in the human and heavenly realms. Having attained spiritual resonance, may they proceed to their proper destinies.

We now recite the **Spiritual Incantation for Transforming Food**.

**Burn the talisman. Transform the food.**

**Incantation for Food, Empowerment, and Invocation of Names**

The Dao declares: "Precepts" mean cessation—ceasing the mind’s transgressions to return to true stillness. Thus precepts give rise to samādhi. The Confucians also say, "Knowing cessation, one attains stillness." Yet the Three Caverns’ scriptures and the Four Auxiliary secret canons expound precepts in myriad forms. Among them, the **Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Ninefold Wondrous Precepts** stand as the foremost of all precepts. Revered by heaven and humankind, observed by both the hidden and manifest realms, they are the supreme above the supreme, the cavernous within the cavernous, the numinous of myriad spirits, the treasure of primordial qi. Wondrously pervading the Three Realms, they restrain the six emotions. Their number fixed by yang, they are divided into nine. Cultivated without falsity, they are called "true." Heaven and humankind look to them as ramparts; the hidden and manifest rely on them as ladders and boats. Today, the departed souls receive them as the flower of the Dharma.

The method of receiving precepts begins with stillness and silence; the method of upholding them prizes diligent observance. With the assembly united in sincerity, we now transmit the Nine Precepts.

**Recite the Wisdom Hymn**

The **First Precept** is reverence and deference, filial piety and care for parents—this is the **Initial Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of uprightness and longevity. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

The **Second Precept** is diligence and devotion, loyalty to one’s lord—this is the **Mindful Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of wisdom and sagacity. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

The **Third Precept** is not killing, compassionate rescue of all beings—this is the **Upholding Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of wealth, nobility, and excellence. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

The **Fourth Precept** is not engaging in licentiousness, rectifying the body amid all things—this is the **Guarding Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of auspiciousness and peace. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

The **Fifth Precept** is not stealing, extending righteousness at one’s own expense—this is the **Preserving Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of purity and good nature. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

The **Sixth Precept** is not harboring wrath, refraining from cruelty and aggression—this is the **Cultivating Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of illustrious rank and clarity. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

The **Seventh Precept** is not being arrogant, avoiding disdain for the utmost truth—this is the **Attaining Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of perfecting the ten virtues. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

The **Eighth Precept** is not being deceitful, refraining from flattery, treachery, and harming the good—this is the **Perfecting Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of the Great Dao’s true Dharma. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

The **Ninth Precept** is not being dual-minded, upholding the precepts with single-minded devotion—this is the **Ascending Truth Precept**. After receiving and upholding it, one attains the fruit of realizing the Great Dharma King. Hold fast to the mind without negligence.

**Recite the Precept-Receiving Hymn**

The wondrous precept scripture, inscribed on yellow registers and white tablets, having fully proclaimed its profound essence, is now reverently received in its numinous text. The mind is hard to restrain; restrained by the Nine Precepts, it may return to the Great Void. The form has not yet transcended; transcended by the Two Talismans, it may refine itself in the upper realms. You, the lonely souls, must in every life remember the precept words, in every kalpa uphold the talismanic covenant. Clarify the spirit beyond the material world, severing worldly ties across many lives. Receiving form in the yang realm, good fruits will naturally accrue in perpetuity. Grace lingers in families and nations, blessings extending without end.

All **Registers of Longevity** and **Merit Memorials** shall now be solemnly proclaimed.

**Concluding Offerings and Refinement**

As our prayers draw to a close and offerings are complete, we linger in concern, for the realms of darkness and light remain divided. Now the silver river of dim clouds stirs, the bronze clepsydra’s *ding-ding* nears its end. The sky’s gate at Ox and Dipper darkens beneath gloomy clouds; the moon’s palace is locked in deep mist. Rainclouds stand silent as the *gong*-tuned simurgh dances; stone swallows soar in the murk. Snow adorns the jade trees with a hushed rustle; silently, jade-like petals drift onto the steps. Each prepares their cloud chariot, ascending together to the celestial river.

The Way of Heaven returns to the Way of Heaven; the spirits each resume their divine offices. Humans dwell within the Three Realms; ghosts govern the Nine Dark Prisons. May all hungry souls, starving ghosts, and denizens of hellish dungeons ascend and be delivered, sharing in these benefits. Transform the celestial kitchens’ refined offerings, convert the worldly wealth. All is for beseeching grace, none fails to bring blessing.

Having led this fragrant fast and received these presented rites, they came in due order and now depart in spiraling flight. Having gained form in the immortal courts, they shall surely tread upon auspicious clouds, hastening to the **Palace of Numinous Response**, swiftly arriving at the **Realm of Carefree Wandering**. Above, they traverse the clouds’ wings; below, they reach the abyss’s scales. Having received good causes, they hear wondrous music. Universally aided by this offering, they together achieve transcendence.

Beyond the remnants of food and offerings, may the flocks of wild birds in the open fields have their hunger sated; may the herds of beasts in the deep plains fill their bellies. Should they encounter the twang of bowstrings or the flight of arrows, may they forever escape harm. If they meet nets or spears, may they suffer no injury. May they swiftly cast off evil destinies and swiftly realize good affinities.

We humbly extend this merit to all beings, slightly exhausting the weight of our faithful hearts. Bowing our heads to the starry river, prostrating before the celestial steps, the assembly of ritual officers now respectfully sends them forth.

Jade tones and immortal music chime; cranes dance and phoenixes soar past the Nine Gates. Holding registers and grasping talismans, they transcend the Dharma realms, attending court at the Golden Palace to behold the Heavenly Countenance.

**Recite the Hymn of Utmost Bliss to Send Forth**

Thus concludes the rite.

The Rite of Fumigation and Offering, with Jade Registers to Deliver the Hidden and Judge the Measured, is now complete.
