Standing before the **Teacher’s Treasure** (立师宝前) and declaring respectfully:

*"To establish the Fast and practice the Dao/Way, the solemn rituals are observed in accordance with the Three Primordials (三元);*
*to assign duties and set officials, all bowing and movements align with the Four Cardinal Directions (四极).*
*The celestial hosts attend the court to verify and record, while the myriad True Ones (众真) serve at the seat to oversee.*
*In performing their duties, they must proceed with utmost caution and propriety.*
*Moreover, the Jade Laws (玉律) stand as stern overseers, and the Golden Codes (金科) descend with authoritative decrees.*
*They should exhaust their sincerity, ascending the Jade Platform (瑶坛) to worship reverently;*
*each precept inscribed, they must unfold the Pearl Registers (琼笈) to proclaim.*
*In selecting and appointing, they must not act lightly—*
*their discernment should be as keen as a bird’s wings.*
*First, one is appointed as High Functionary (高功).*
*His duties are thus:*

*and to silently resonate with the celestial heart.*
*Now, I appoint [name] to this role.*
*Standing before the platform, the Chief Lecturer shall bestow the office by decree;*
*[name] kneels to receive the decree and bows three times.*

*Next, one is appointed as Supervisor of the Fast (监斋).*

*and to delight both the manifest and the subtle.*
*Now, I appoint [name] to this role.*
*Standing before the platform, the Attendant of the Scripture shall bestow the office by decree;*
*[name] kneels to receive the decree and bows three times.*

*Next, one is appointed as Attendant of the Incense (侍香).*
*His duties are thus:*

*to walk in procession, lighting the incense sticks (爇炷),*
*so that fragrance pervades from beginning to end,*
*to make the Mysterious Perception (玄鉴) clear and evident,*
*and to reveal the sincere devotion of the red heart (丹诚).*
*He must not allow the incense to falter at any point,*
*and should surpass the initial sincerity.*
*Now, I appoint [name] to this role.*
*Standing before the platform, the Attendant of the Incense shall bestow the office by decree;*
*[name] kneels to receive the decree and bows three times.*

*not latecomers who have only donned the yellow crown (黄冠后学之流).*
*Only those who are clearly distinguished in merit and demerit,*

*shall be chosen.*
*For virtue/power is the criterion for elevation,*

*The celestial威 (aura) shall be a cautionary presence,*
*and the platform’s prohibitions shall stand stern and clear.*
*They must not presumptuously violate the ritual codes (科条),*
*so that they may escape the constitutional laws (宪律).*
*This shall be in accordance with the **Lingbao Mysterious Platform Ritual Orders** (灵宝玄坛律令).*

**Hymn of Wisdom (智慧颂)**

*"Wisdom arises from the root of precepts,*
*and the true Dao/Way is the master of precepts.*
*By this, the Three Treasures (三宝) flourish,*
*and the High Immortals (高仙) are reverently instructed.*
*This boundless boat of non-death,*
*in a moment crosses to the Great Existence (大有).*
*At this time of expounding precepts,*
*all the celestial hosts bow in homage.*
*Turning the platform,*
*The High Functionary faces west at the platform,*
*while the assembly faces east,*
*each prostrating themselves upon the ground.*
*The officials and all bow their heads in reverence,*
*and silently pay homage to the Ten Directions (十方),*
*each offering one bow,*
*beginning from the north,*
*then completing the circuit of the Ten Directions,*
*with devout sincerity receiving the precepts.*

*The High Functionary expounds the precepts,*
*while the officials kneel in a long row.*

*The Dao/Way’s Lord (道君), in the past,*
*during the first year of the Kaihuang era (开皇元年),*
*on the seventh day of the seventh month,*
*at the hour of wu (午时),*
*at the Western Thatched Mountain (西那玉国郁剎之山),*
*the Floating Flower Peak (浮罗之岳),*
*within the Longsang Grove (长桑林中),*
*received from the Heavenly Venerable (天尊)*
*the **Lingbao Wisdom Supreme Precept Dao/Way** (灵宝智慧上品大戒法文).*
*At that time,*
*The Dao/Way’s Lord faced north,*
*prostrating fivefold upon the earth,*
*turning his heart toward the Ten Directions,*
*then facing east and bowing.*
*The Heavenly Venerable then told the Dao/Way’s Lord:*
*'Now, I shall universally proclaim the Dao/Way’s sound,*
*to awaken all beings,*
*to resolve calamities and avert misfortunes,*
*and to request blessings and pray for security.*
*He who practices the Fast and follows the Dao/Way*
*must wholeheartedly uphold the Ten Precepts (十戒),*
*concentrate with single-minded devotion,*
*and penetrate through profound contemplation,*
*without allowing stray thoughts*
*to disrupt the form and spirit.*
*If one can do so,*
*then they should listen in silence.*

*First Precept:*
*‘The heart shall not harbor malice or envy,*
*nor generate dark, treacherous thoughts.*
*One must examine their speech and repent past transgressions,*
*and think in accordance with the Dao/Way.’*

*Second Precept:*
*‘Guard the virtue/power of benevolence without killing,*
*pity and rescue all beings,*
*show boundless compassion and salvation,*
*and nourish all things with mercy.’*

*Third Precept:*
*‘Guard uprightness and yield to righteousness,*
*avoid licentiousness and theft,*
*constantly harbor good intentions,*
*and sacrifice oneself to benefit others.’*

*Fourth Precept:*
*‘Avoid desire and licentiousness,*
*let the heart not wander recklessly,*
*maintain purity and guard with caution,*
*and walk without blemish or stain.’*

*Fifth Precept:*
*‘Let no evil words pass the lips,*
*nor ornate and frivolous speech,*
*and be straight in heart and mind,*
*committing no transgressions of speech.’*

*Sixth Precept:*
*‘Abstain from alcohol and regulate conduct,*
*harmonize the nature and **qi** (性气),*
*and do not harm the spirit (神).*
*One must not offend against any evil.’*

*Seventh Precept:*
*‘Do not covet another’s superiority,*
*nor compete for fame and rank.*
*In all matters, one must yield and defer,*
*and retreat to benefit others.’*

*Eighth Precept:*
*‘Do not criticize or disparage sacred scriptures,*
*nor defame the holy texts.*
*One must personally receive teachings with humility,*
*and always act as though facing the divine.’"*

*[End of translation]*

*Ninth Precept:*
*'Do not slander with tongue or speech,*
*nor analyze the faults of the four generations,*
*and abstain from calumny, malice, envy, and jealousy,*
*lest you harm the **qi** and spirit (神气).*

*Tenth Precept:*
*'In all actions and conduct,*
*maintain equality and single-mindedness,*
*so that humanity is harmonized and the divine is revered,*
*and thus your deeds are ever upright.'*

*[The following ten precepts]*
*Can you uphold them?*
*The assembly can uphold them.*

*The Celestial Sage says:*
*'To observe the ten precepts,*
*each in accordance with the Heavenly Will,*
*and to always practice great compassion,*
*willing to deliver all beings from suffering.*
*Be steadfast in the Sage’s teachings,*
*never falter in the midst,*
*and stand firm in virtue rather than transgress the Dao/Way in life.*

*Thus, without retreat,*
*you may attain the rewards of the gods,*
*and be revered by all spirits.*

*To keep long-term precepts and observe the teachings,*
*is to personally attain liberation from the world.*

*The Celestial Sage says:*
*'The Dao/Way is noble and its teachings profound,*
*and the human body is also precious.*
*Thus, the Dao opens the gate of its laws,*
*leaving precepts in scripture,*
*to deliver the human body.*

*Having delivered the human body,*
*it aligns with the Dao—*
*one should then refine one’s practice.*
*To uphold precepts and observe the teachings,*
*calm the mind and quiet the heart,*
*clarify intentions,*
*and single-mindedly turn toward the Way.*

*With unwavering focus,*
*purify the six **qi**-organs (六腑).*
*Beyond the midpoint, no taste remains,*
*and inner and outer self are clear and empty.*
*Each alignment with nature*
*is its own day of fasting.*

*Taking incense and vowing,*
*respond with sincerity from the heart,*
*while the Four Celestial Kings oversee,*
*and the Ten Departments of divine power (威神) witness—*
*then proceed to practice,*
*listening to the dharma’s voice,*
*and reflecting it in your mind.*

*If you uphold the precepts and walk the Dao,*
*all merit shall be recorded in the celestial ranks,*
*and retribution made manifest.*
*The Dao does not fail those who diligently practice and truly receive it,*
*so do not let demonic words (魔言) deceive you.*

*The Celestial Sage declares:*
*'To establish fasting and walk the Dao,*
*the Four Celestial Kings,*
*all riding cloud-chariots—*
*the Green Palanquin (绿軿),*
*the Eight Scenery Jade Chariot (八景玉舆)—*
*with attendants of True Persons (真人),*
*Jade Boys (玉童), and Jade Girls (玉女),*
*holding floral banners,*
*led by phoenix hymns,*
*followed by Heaven’s white cranes and lions,*
*singing in joyous tones,*
*burning incense and scattering flowers,*
*shall descend from the sky.*

*To pay homage and walk the Dao,*
*listening to the dharma’s voice.*
*The Heavenly Kings descend,*
*and all spirits assemble in reverence.*
*Thus, you fulfill the Celestial Will,*
*and fully realize the blessings of fasting—*
*how could you not exhaust its teachings?'*

*First, receive the ten precepts,*
*then proceed to walk the Dao.*
*Move with dignified steps,*
*quiet the mind and ease the will.*
*In sitting, rising, or repose,*
*never stray from proper conduct.*

*The Celestial Sage rejoices,*
*and the assembly proclaims the lofty precepts—*
*thus, one may say you have attained the Dao within the measure of the heart.*

*[The Precept Ode]*
*The Dao is the School of No-Mind,*
*All deeds as fields of merit.*
*Merit has no fixed standard,*
*Each vow arises from the self.*
*Emptying oneself for all beings,*
*Focus the heart without exception.*
*The Great Sage upholds true teachings,*
*As rain descends from Heaven.*

*High peaks are ever embraced,*
*Yet humility endures to form the abyss.*
*The sea is sovereign of all rivers,*
*Yet it forgoes the dragon’s scales.*
*Through countless kalpas, wisdom is preserved,*
*Not merely confined to a single lifetime.*

*To uphold the precepts without fail,*
*In every life, good karma is sown.*
*With clear thought, strive for the Great Vehicle,*
*And you shall surely rest in the true Dao.*

*[The Return to Rank]*
*The officials sit in order,*
*And the prohibitions and rites are proclaimed.*

*The Rite of Abstinence is pure and void,*
*The prohibitions and restraints are most solemn.*

*All who partake in the abstinence,*
*Must diligently conform to the rites and decorum.*

*The Grand Master of the Supreme Polarity,*
*Possesses all the precepts and prohibitions.*
*Now I shall proclaim and demonstrate,*
*Unveiling what was previously unheard.*

*Receives the penalties and precepts in person.*

*All these prohibitions and rites,*

*And follow the ancient established codes.*

*As for their indolence or negligence,*
*And any transgressions committed,*
*At the time of establishing the abstinence,*
*The Four Celestial Kings, the Heavenly Sovereign, and the Supreme Saints,*
*Shall descend in person to the site,*
*Gaze upon the rituals and conduct,*
*Observe their sincerity and resolve.*
*Should any offense be found,*
*They shall immediately command the Four Officials and Five Celestial Kings,*
*And decree to the Three Departments,*
*To correct and admonish according to the offense,*
*And impose their retributions.*

*The Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Sage,*
*Out of compassion for the ignorant of the world,*
*Does not wish to impose severe censure,*
*Thus opening the door of correction and punishment.*
*So that they may know their faults and mend their ways,*
*And their sins shall thereby be absolved.*

*Those who receive punishment,*
*Must accept blame with humility,*
*And obey with reverence,*
*Not daring to disguise their faults or contend,*
*Nor to provoke the sacred spirit.*

*Thus shall the sacred order be upheld,*
*And the calamities of guilt be dispelled.*
*Guilt shall be cast aside in the past,*
*And blessings shall extend into the future.*

*With utmost vigilance and devotion,*
*Diligently and fearfully guard against transgression.*
*If one personally serves the Great Sage,*
*And bows before the Most Honorable,*
*Then the sacred spirit shall be moved,*
*And blessings and auspiciousness shall gather.*

*May all who ascend the platform*
*Strive earnestly to observe these prohibitions.*
*The Golden Seal of the Great Abstinence—*
*Completing the Rite of Abstinence and the Declaration of Precepts.*
