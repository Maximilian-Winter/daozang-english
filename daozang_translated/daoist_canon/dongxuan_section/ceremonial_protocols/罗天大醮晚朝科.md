### **Evening Rite of the Grand Luotian Jiao**

**The Preceptor Recites the Invocation as Prescribed:**

The Five Stars gleam on high, auspicious *qi* drifts in the void.
The Primal Beginning gathers the spirits; Heaven and Earth unite in harmony.
Jade talismans and sacred seals summon the subtle and the hidden.
Fire is cast, might is displayed—no treachery or evil lingers.
The Ten Thousand Demons tremble and submit; malevolent blossoms wither away.
Monsters are crushed, wickedness is vanquished—the Dao and *qi* flow as one.
Divine radiance illumines the night; shadows and darkness are wholly withdrawn.
The Ten Thousand Spirits descend in attendance, riding the winds on spreading light.
All beings attain fulfillment; grace pervades the Divine Continent.

**The Dharma Drum is Struck Twenty-Four Times**

O Most Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primal Beginning, Three *Qi* of the Grand Supreme Elder Lord:
Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Attendant Envoys of Left and Right, the Golden Lads Bearing Incense, the Jade Maidens Transmitting Words and Scattering Flowers, and the Thirty-Six Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs, the Direct Talismanic Envoys of the Day—let them all emerge.
Let them emerge in solemn attire, adorned with robes, caps, and hanging tassels.
Report to the Divine Perfected of the Altar’s Earthly Precincts and Local Deities.
This servant now ascends the altar in the evening rite to perform the Dao, paying homage to the Imperial Perfected. Humbly I submit this petition for the intent herein, its sincerity fully inscribed and sealed.
May the Supreme Perfected’s Dao-*qi* and the numinous radiance of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into this servant’s body, that the sincerity of this petition swiftly reach the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Great Dao, the Three Clarities’ Most Sacred, the August Jade Thearch of the Golden Gates of the Supreme Heaven.

we reverently beseech Your Vast Compassion to turn and illuminate us with Your gaze.

**Prostrate Reflection:**

I, this unworthy servant, by some fortune of past blessings, early renounced worldly ties.
Having been permitted to serve the Supreme Mystery, I have gained access to the Mysterious Precepts.

Thus, ever reflecting upon this fortune, I know my good fortune; ever striving to exert myself, I seek to proclaim my devotion. In all matters of supplication, none may be suppressed or obstructed. Since the purity of the fast is earnest and the words of intent sincere, I humbly extend my plea. May the Mysterious Compassion, in its vast turning, incline its true hearing to this entreaty.

**Proclamation of Words:**
As set forth in the petition, the sincerity of my heart is manifest. Presumptuously troubling the Mysterious Compassion, I am all the more reverently awed.

I have heard: the Two Caverns of Lü swing wide the jeweled gates of the Imperial Palace; the Nine-by-Nine Heavenly Gates of the Celestial Gatekeeper seal the jade halls of the Divine Capital. Unseen by sight, unheard by hearing; gazing, they grow ever higher, observing, they stretch ever farther. Beyond the bounds of names and words, their subtlety eludes inquiry; unbound by form or vessel, their fragrant radiance defies perception. In stillness, the Response descended into the Han world; the Mysterious Origin repeatedly manifested in the Shu capital. Secretly expounding the true scriptures, privately transmitting the wondrous purport. The Azure Palace and the Purple Mansion—how distant their opening of the ford! The Yellow Path and the Vermilion Steps—suddenly, the day is made bright. Exhausting the solemnity of the fast and turning toward them, a single sincerity of intent establishes trust. The spirits of swift transformation respond in an instant, as if bending and stretching in a single breath. Thereupon, the golden locks turn, the jade maidens bear the missives, and we approach the Imperial Honored One to reverently present our petition. Above, to dispel calamities and portents; below, to deliver living beings. Universally leading all to compliance, the unseen and hidden rely upon this. The officiant of the fast, so-and-so, prostrates in reflection: dwelling in the mortal realm, my aspiration lies in the steps of the Dao. Observing the precepts and maintaining the fast, I don the feathered robe to proclaim the scriptural teachings; repenting transgressions and acknowledging faults, I honor the Precious Teacher to establish the altar. In meditation, I ascend to the Black Dawn Court of Heaven; prostrating, I send forth my spirit to pay homage to the Emperor. At times, purple light enfolds the golden radiance of the moon, auspicious mists float and gather, the fragrance of cinnabar flames is concealed, star-jade talismans shimmer, and the hues of propitious clouds appear. The myriad sounds fall silent in the cavernous valleys; flocks of birds fold their wings in the mountain forests. Bells and chimes resound in unison, their echoes flowing with the songs of the void; Kan and Li silently circulate, illuminating the inner landscape with their brilliance. The Three Realms assemble in attendance; the Five Wheels traverse together. On this tranquil night of ritual practice, the assembly of petitioners and the dharma multitude now perform the first incense offering. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to the realm of the Three Clarities.

We, your servants, surrender body, spirit, and life, prostrating ourselves to the earth. Reverently relying upon the Three Honored Ones of the Most High, by the merit of this incense offering, we pray for the present emperor. May his sagely culture shine like the stars, his divine martial prowess soar like the dragon. May he illuminate the four quarters with wisdom, widely bestow the virtue of the imperial sovereign, and observe the movements of all beings with fitting accord—the very heart of Heaven and Earth. May carriages share the same tracks and writings the same script, the three frontiers be pacified; may music attain perfect goodness and martial prowess perfect beauty, the four seas know peace. As the wind moves and the grass bends, may transformation be universally accomplished; as fish leap and kites soar, may all people find their own fulfillment.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and personally take refuge in the virtue of the Dao, the Venerable, the Great Sage Host, and the Perfected. Having attained the Dao, may they long preserve Heaven’s endurance.

On this tranquil night as we perform the Dao rites, we invite the dharma assembly to offer this second pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to the realm of the Three Purities. We take refuge in body, spirit, and life, prostrating ourselves fully. Reverently relying upon the Three Honored Ones of the Most High, by the merit of this incense offering, we dedicate its power to the ancestral spirits of three generations, the kin, and the wandering souls of the officiant so-and-so. We pray that their transgressions vanish like the sea of desire, their sins dissolve like the river of attachment. May the three karmic retributions be eradicated, the eight impurities leave no trace upon the mind-ground; may the six senses be purified, the five spirits all attain their celestial nature. May they refine their forms in the courtyard of flowing fire, nurture their virtue in the palace of youthful origin. Riding clouds and guiding qi, may they wander and feast in the immortal capital, moving from yin to yang, roaming freely in the sagely age.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and personally take refuge in the virtue of the Sutra, the Venerable, the Great Sage Host, and the Perfected. Having attained the Dao, may they ascend into formlessness.

On this tranquil night as we perform the Dao rites, we invite the dharma assembly to offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to the realm of the Three Purities. We take refuge in body, spirit, and life, prostrating ourselves fully. Reverently relying upon the Three Honored Ones of the Most High, by the merit of this incense offering, we humbly pray for the officiant so-and-so, who with sincere intent establishes this grand rite of cosmic expanse to repent transgressions, dispel calamities, beseech blessings, and invoke fortune. We pray that golden script record their goodness, jade tablets inscribe their names. May the Emperor grant them longevity, their years ever increasing as their virtue ever excels; may the spirits bestow their blessings, the aged find peace and the young be cherished. Wherever they dwell or abide, may the spirits extend their protection; whether they rest or journey, may Heaven grant its accord. May joy fill their halls, felicity spread through their neighborhoods. May their households enjoy tranquility, their studies and conduct befit rank and emolument; may all people embrace trust and righteousness, their virtuous conduct worthy of hereditary office. May all affairs prosper, all misfortunes forever cease.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and personally take refuge in the virtue of the Master, the Venerable, the Great Sage Host, and the Perfected. Having attained the Dao, may they unite with the Dao in truth.

*Chanting the directions—Repentance.*

**Invocation of the Demons—Triple Invocation, Triple Bow, Repeated Recitation of Dharma Titles**

We, [Rank and Name], together with the officiating officials and all assembled, humbly and with one heart, reverently address the following supplication:

To the Most Exalted Three Purities, the Ten Directions’ Supreme Sages, the Heavenly Emperors and Perfected of the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, the Master-Sages of the Ten Directions, the divine hosts of the Three Realms, and all mighty numina:

We have heard that through non-action, one grasps the essential purport of Heaven and humanity; in stillness, observing the return, one perceives the purity and wholeness of the Dao and virtue. Vast and boundless, its radiance is too distant to name; subtle and wondrously penetrating, it is too profound to fathom. Beyond form and vessel, it is flawless in all things; in its beginning and end, it abides with the Dao.

Yet we, holding fast to the heart, lack wisdom; our resolve is not steadfast. We delve into the indistinct and fail to discern its origin; we peer into the subtle and stray from its measure. Though we aspire to embrace the yellow and return to the purple, how can we commune with the real and attain the numinous? In vain do we bear our titles, presuming to enact the teachings.

Now, the ritual master [Name] has bathed his body and washed his hair, prepared the offerings, and arrayed the rites. Desiring to approach the celestial steps, we cultivate the models of the Dao. With the cloud-script of the Five Directions, we gather demons and bind fiends; within the three-tiered sacred precinct, we reverently gaze toward Heaven and behold the Sages. Phoenix candles flicker crimson, their hues resplendent; dragon incense scatters its fragrance, its light flowing. The eight gates stand lofty and open; the nine keys are grandly proclaimed.

We humbly beseech the Jade Capital’s imperial towers, the Jasper Gardens’ immortal realms, the Most Sacred Primal Honored Ones, and the ranked officials of all offices—nine-hued chariots gleaming in flight through the void, five luminances floating upon the altar of radiance. As the divine stirs, Heaven follows; the great handle of the wellspring of life is raised. As ashes fly and smoke vanishes, the dense records of transgressions are swept away. All blessings derive from this; none remain unliberated.

First, we pray that the imperial domain flourish and expand, the sovereign’s enterprise vast and glorious. Let those who scale mountains and sail seas present tribute without fail; let outer barbarians and border tribes offer allegiance without rebellion.

Next, we pray for the ritual master: may Heaven’s harmony bestow blessings, the Dao’s fortune accumulate protection, and ancestors and forebears find peace. May the refined odes of the poets be fulfilled, the spirits assent and respond; may the humble light of the noble be enhanced, their grand legacy enduring and flourishing. May prosperity and splendor abound, their illustrious renown resounding. May their gates preserve loyalty and filial piety, their generations succeed in office, and all adversity be forever averted. May they abundantly receive the harvest tally; may the departed attain liberation, the recently deceased transcend to new life. Those bound to the Three Paths, still mired in the Five Sufferings—may they ride the merit of this fast to liberation, not drowning in karmic retribution; may they, in accord with the talismanic command, be transformed and reborn, attaining blessed fruition. May all in the unseen realms yet unliberated, together with the guardians who have labored in defense, by the grace of this luminous favor, ascend in rank and grade.

Thus, the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy above is made manifest, and our sincerity in taking refuge below is duly answered.

We reverently submit this petition for your hearing.

**Vows**
One: May the numinous light descend and illuminate.
Two: May the moon of the Dao cast its radiance.
Three: May grace extend through the Nine Lands.
Four: May sincerity reach the majesty of Heaven.
Five: May all true spirits assemble.
Six: May the qi of the Dao pervade all.
Seven: May the Heavenly Palaces open wide.
Eight: May the hells be shattered and destroyed.
Nine: May the mysterious power universally extend.
Ten: May the chariot of radiance soar through the void.
Eleven: May all under Heaven embrace virtue.
Twelve: May the transformation of the Dao be effortless.

**Replenishing the Incense Burner**
*Visualizing the spirits, burning incense.*

The Incense Officials and Envoys, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all the attendant spirit-officials of the incense—may they now cause the place where I have just ascended the altar to perform the evening audience and conduct the Dao to naturally generate golden nectar, cinnabar-green mushroom blossoms, and the assembly of the hundred numinous perfected. May all gather here before the incense burner. May it be wished that the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid banquet, convey the sincerity of my recent petition, and swiftly transmit it directly to the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Great Dao, the Three Clarities’ August Sages, and the August Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal, Supreme Lord of the Vast Heaven. The evening audience of the Grand Offering to the Heavenly Net is now concluded.
