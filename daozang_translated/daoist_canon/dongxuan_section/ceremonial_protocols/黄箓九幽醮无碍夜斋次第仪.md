**Ritual Sequence for the *Huángluò Jiǔyōu Zhāo Wú'ài Night Fast***

On the day the Daoist hall is established, at the *shen* hour (3–5 PM), the officiant approaches the *Xuánzhōng* Grand Master, bows, and presents the *Xuánzhāng* (Divine Scripture), burning it.

Next, at the *yǒu* hour (5–7 PM), before the Three Celestial Grand Masters, the host offers incense, and the Master requests the *guāndié* (sealed talisman). The officials offer three passes, while commoners offer one, and the Master grants the *dùdié* (passport) to the host. The host then passes it to a Daoist disciple, who holds it aloft.

The Daoist assembly raises the *Huáxià* (auspicious banner), escorting it to the outer gate, where an incense altar is set. The host offers incense, tea, wine, and fruit in three portions, bows twice, and presents incense again.

The Master then declares:

*"Most reverently, to rescue the lost souls and revive the stagnant spirits, nothing surpasses the wondrous *Huángluò* Fast. To cultivate merit and plant the seeds of transcendence, none excel the *Zǐqīng* Secret Register. Though we offer precious supplies, we must rely on the Celestial Treasury. Now, as we establish this sacred ritual, we seek divine appointment to fulfill our duty.*

*Though the Nine Directions share the same realm, they are all governed by the Hidden Sovereign. Though the Ten Thousands of domains differ, they are all divided under the Sacred Bureau. We stabilize the sacred land with the cosmic threads, and proclaim the grandeur of the local domain. We follow the rules of the Supreme Void, and uphold the rituals of the Auspicious Hearth.*

*Now, with solemn reverence, the host—[Name], who has committed [seven days, one year, or a taboo date] of transgression—invites [number] Daoists to perform the *Dùpǐn* Fast in honor of the departed. The sacred hall is adorned with brocade, and the Daoist field is opened in ritual order. We uplift sincerity across the Three Realms, relying on the Four Directions to spread our teachings. We rescue the guilty from the Nine Abysses, aiming to open salvation across the Five Paths. May the City Gods, Land Gods, and Village Deities witness this fast and share in its divine fruits.*

*Thus, we first present the sealed talisman to declare our intentions to the Bright Spirits. May the Divine Hearings condescend to grant clear insight."*

**Declaration of the Sealed Talisman**
The Master again declares:

*"The intent of this fast has been fully stated in the talisman. Now, all may proceed accordingly. Together, we attend to the affairs of the Jade Platform, that the souls of the departed may ascend to the Spirit Springs. If the spirits are diligent in their divine duties, then the fast’s merit will surely be fulfilled. May the Divine Hearings, in their direct wisdom, accept these words. With deepest devotion, we pray."*

**Burning the Talisman, Money, and Horse Offerings**
Burn the hymns, recite the *huíxiàng* (dedication), and chant the *niànshàn tuì* (merit recitation and retreat).

Next, arrange a single incense stand with flowers, summon a *zhàohún* (Soul-Calling) cloth, and have the host offer incense.

The Master takes the *zhàohún* cloth—one *zhàng* (3.33 m) long, two *chǐ* (66.67 cm) wide, made of boiled silk—and declares:

*"Most reverently, the profound teachings of the Daoist lineage encompass all things with boundless compassion. The Spirit Sovereigns, though distant, illuminate the Nine Abysses together."*

*"Most reverently, we honor the grand rites of filial piety and devotion, and humbly proclaim the vast merit of salvation and deliverance. If we diligently uphold the sacred precepts and sincerely forget ourselves beneath the wondrous shelter of the Dao, then the merit of this fast will surely be fulfilled, and the spirits will accept these words with radiant grace. May the Divine Hearings, in their direct wisdom, accept these words. With deepest devotion, we pray.

**Ritual of Inviting the Departed Spirit into the Residence**
Now, the Master declares:

*"Most reverently, we hear that though Heaven and Earth endure eternally, they still witness the cycles of decline and renewal; though the sun and moon shine brightly, they follow the natural rhythms of waxing and waning. How much more so for human life within the Three Realms, whose nature is bound by the Five Constants. Who can escape the wheel of rebirth, or evade the cycle of birth and death? For all that is born must eventually perish, and all that begins must have an end. Thus, Zhuang Zhou lamented his dream of the butterfly, and the Sage of Lu sighed at the passing river. Even the sages could not evade it, and the common folk cannot escape. Now, the host, most devoutly, offers this fast for the departed certain person, who has left this bright world and entered the dark abode. Filial offerings are exhausted in pious sincerity, and this sacred assembly is specially convened this night.

Now, the solemn rites are richly arrayed, and the Daoist disciples stand in orderly ranks. We invite the departed spirit to take refuge in the Three Treasures. Let all present bear witness in faith—

**Proclaiming the First Refuge: The Precious Dao Treasure**
To the Ten Directions’ Most Exalted Ones, the Three Most Honorable Sages, who over countless eons have guided beings and established the Dao in primordial times. With boundless compassion and mercy, they encompass all sentient life. Their jade-like forms and golden countenances are ever worthy of reverence. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Dao Treasure. May the departed spirit, with all sincerity, take refuge in the Dao. May all acts of faith be fulfilled.

**Proclaiming the Second Refuge: The Precious Scripture Treasure**
To the Ten Directions’ worlds, the sacred texts—jewel-lettered, golden-scripted, dragon-carved, phoenix-sealed—comprising the Thirty-Six Divisions and Eighteen Thousand Sutras, which guide the lost and elevate them to the Dao’s shore. Each line extinguishes sins, each word dispels calamities. In this life and all future rebirths, may these teachings be ever honored. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Scripture Treasure. May the departed spirit open their heart to understanding and uphold, recite, and transmit these teachings.

**Proclaiming the Third Refuge: The Precious Master Treasure**
To the Most Venerable Sage of the Mystic Dao, the Three Teachers of Ancient Times, the Orthodox True Person, and the Three Celestial Patriarchs—who in the Ten Directions’ worlds have attained the Dao and become divine immortals. They transmit the law, deliver the scriptures, and guide all beings. They are the True Parents, the Great Physicians. In this life and all future rebirths, may their teachings be ever honored. With devoted hearts, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Master Treasure. May the departed spirit ascend the Path of the Dao without obstruction.

Again, the Master declares:

*"Most reverently, with the wondrous grace of the Jade Void, we proclaim the vast merit of salvation and deliverance."*

The **Ceremonial Rites of Filial Offerings** are inscribed and revealed in sacred script.
With reverence, we follow the hidden precepts and humbly serve the departed spirits.

Now, the **Jade Dao’s** hymns resound, and the **Celestial Edicts** are proclaimed.
The **Heavenly Scripts** in cloud-like seals have been bestowed upon auspicious destinies;
Swiftly ascending the **Whirlwind Chariot**, their marvelous responses are now manifest.
They gaze upon the **Purple Cosmos** and ascend the **Crimson Peaks**.

We have heard the names of the **Three Treasures** and proclaim the **Ten Directions’** sublime titles.
With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—
**To the Eastern Nine-Qi Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.
We kowtow to the **Eastern Master, the Jade Treasure Imperial Sovereign**,
Who holds the **Green Flower Scepter** and guides this departed spirit
To the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—

We kowtow to the **Northern Master, the Mystic Supreme Dawn Sovereign**,

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—

We kowtow to the **Northwest Master, the Boundless Great Hua Sovereign**,
Who holds the **Purple-Haired Scepter** and guides this departed spirit
To the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—
**To the Upper Great Luo Heavenly Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.
We kowtow to the **Upper Master, the Jade Void Illustrious Sovereign**,
Who holds the **Life-Demons-Subduing Scepter** and guides this departed spirit
To the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.

With devoted hearts, we take refuge and pay homage—
**To the Lower Nine-Palace Imperial Sovereign** and the **Celestial Spirits of the Immortals**.
We kowtow to the **Lower Master, the True Sovereign of the Cavern Spirit**,
Who holds the **Soul-Summoning Scepter** and guides this departed spirit
To the **Realm of the Immortal Dao**.

Next, we chant the **Ten Directions’ Void Realm**, all Heavenly Sovereigns,
And with pious hearts, we repent for the departed spirit.

**Repentance Begins**
With devoted hearts, we repent for the departed spirit.
We repent for **bodily karmic offenses**, the boundless sins of the body.
Countless and immeasurable, they arise in every movement—
Stained by dust and defilement, adorned with greed and indulgence,
Arrogant and insolent toward the world.
Now before the **Great Compassionate One**, we humbly confess.
May these bodily karmic offenses be erased, never to arise again.
May purity align with the **Immortal Dao**, forever free from the **Three Realms’** confines.

With devoted hearts, we repent for the departed spirit.
We repent for **mental karmic offenses**, the boundless sins of the mind.
Countless and immeasurable, they stem from anger and hatred,
Love and aversion—all arising from the heart,
Lust and delusion, jealousy toward the world.
Now before the **Great Compassionate One**, we humbly confess.
May these mental karmic offenses be erased, never to arise again.
May wisdom illuminate, penetrating the **Mystic and Profound**.

With devoted hearts, we repent for the departed spirit.
We repent for **verbal karmic offenses**, the boundless sins of speech.
Countless and immeasurable, they include slander and falsehood,
Defaming the **Sutras and Teachings**, consuming sentient beings,
Humiliating the world.
Now before the **Great Compassionate One**, we humbly confess.
May these verbal karmic offenses be erased, never to arise again.
May all false speech cease, and the **True Sutras** be forever proclaimed.

With devoted hearts, we kowtow and give thanks to the **Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures**.

Next, we recite the **Great Dao’s Mystic Void Hymn**.
Next, we chant the **Three Paths and Five Sufferings Ode**.
Next, we lament with a solemn declaration.

「From time immemorial, we extol the boundless **virtue/power** of tenfold devotion,
A limitless cause of triumph and merit.
May the departed spirit, with sincere wish,
Ascend to the heavenly realm,
Where flower-laden palanquins await beneath the clouds,
And celestial banners descend from the sky to guide them.
Amidst the cypress groves and sacred trees,
They shall forever hear the **True Sutras**.
By the moonlit pools of jewels,
They shall distantly hear the sublime **Yāgā** (雅梵).
All sins committed in life shall now be erased;
In death, the **Three Paths** (三涂) shall be dispelled by this virtue.
Riding dragons or charioted by cranes,
They shall wander freely in the tenfold heavens of boundless expanse;
Enlightened by the **Dao/Way**, they shall transcend the **Three Pure Ones** (三清).
Their blessings shall flow to the living,
And their fruits shall manifest in the future.
Do not let them stray now—
Early separation is not to be compared.
Truly, the **Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures** (列圣) observe with benevolent discernment,
And all sentient beings with wisdom shall ascend the **True Dao/Way** (正道).

Next, we dedicate merit to the departed spirit and recite the **Prayer for Retreating Merit** (念善退).
Then, in the stillness of night before the **Mystic Profound Master** (玄师),
We sing praises and walk the **Dao/Way** (行道).
The ritual procession leads them down from the stage to stand before the **Nine Underworld Lamps** (九幽灯).
Next, we light the **Nine Underworld Lamps** (关九幽地狱灯).
Next, we **invoke the waters** (勑水).
Next, we ascend the platform (升坛).
Next, we face the west (面西),
And invoke the **Three Teachers** (三师).
Next, we proclaim the **Establishment of the Platform and Ritual Precepts** (建坛说戒仪).

On the second day at dawn,
We sing praises and walk the **Dao/Way** (行道),
And recite the **Scriptures of the Orthodox** (宣科出官),
All in accordance with the customary rites.
At noon as before,
In the stillness of night, we walk the **Dao/Way** (行道),
And recite the **Scriptures of the Orthodox** until the **Threefold Invocations and Threefold Prostrations** (三启三礼) are complete.
Then, let one **Daoist priest** (道流) approach and invoke the **Thirty-Six Officers of the Underworld** (三十六位上章灵官),
Offering incense, tea, wine, and fruit as **sacrificial offerings** (供养).
Next, the **Daoist priest** (法师) takes his position and recites the **Scriptures of the Orthodox** (出官),
Prostrating before the **Duke of the Underworld** (酆都拔) to summon the departed spirit (拔亡章).
Next, we read the **Scriptures** (读章).
Next, we dispatch the **Officers** (遣官) to subdue and pacify.
Next, we solemnly conclude the rites in accordance with the **Daoist precepts** (依仪大谢).
Next, we invite the **Scriptures** (迎章) to the stage and burn them.
Next, we burn the **Scriptures** and recite the **Ode of Retreating Merit** (回向),
And the **Prayer for Retreating Merit** (念善退).
The assembly disperses at the **first watch of the day** (日初更).
The platform is dismantled, all in accordance with customary rites (散坛，一依常仪).
Next, we send off the **Three Teachers** (送三师).
Next, we proceed before the **Mystic Profound Master** (诣玄师前),
And invoke the **White Lustration** (请白) as before.

At the **second watch of the night** (二更初),
We go before the departed spirit (诣亡灵前),
And request the **bath of purification** (请浴).
Next, the **Daoist priest** (法师) solemnly declares:
*"In the depths of the Yellow Springs, darkness shrouds the soul,
Congealed and polluted, staining the spirit.
In the black soil of the Underworld, filth accumulates,
Buried and suffocating, the departed’s vitality.
Through endless nights of gloom, they struggle to ascend.
Thus, the **Supreme Orthodox Master** (太上) in mercy,
And the **Celestial Sovereign** (元皇) in compassion,
Bestows the **Law of Washing Away Earthly Toil** (洗涤尘劳之法),
And proclaims the **Ritual of Bathing and Refining the Spirit** (沐浴炼度之科).
So that the **karmic bonds** (业网) are severed,
And the **source of sins** (罪源) is absolved.

Now we solemnly prepare the **Jewel Chamber** (宝室),
And purify the **Orchid Bath** (兰汤).
We set the **Five Fragrant Ritual of Bathing and Ablution** (五香澡盥之仪),
And follow the **Threefold Canon of Rescue and Liberation** (三箓拯拔之格).
We humbly invite the departed **so-and-so** (亡过某人),
To the **Bathing Hall** (浴室) to wash and cleanse,
To purify their turbid **qi** and restore clarity.
When the rites are complete, they shall be adorned in solemn splendor,
And return to their place to receive the **Law**.

Next, the ritual procession guides the departed spirit to the **Bathing Hall** (往浴室),
And along the way, let one **Daoist priest** (道流) sprinkle holy water,
Reciting the **Great Hidden Mantra of All Celestial Beings** (诸天内音大梵隐语),
To clear the path and lead them to the bath.

Next, the ritual concludes (法事止).
Next, let one **Daoist priest** (道流) stand by the **bathing basin** (浴盆),
And with a wooden ladle begin from the southwest,
Stirring thirty-two times to the left,
Reciting the **Mantra of Bathing and Purifying Filth** (沐浴荡秽咒):
*"The **Heavenly Qi** (天澄) clears, the **Essential Qi** (炁) brightens,
Five radiant hues illuminate the high heavens.
The sun and moon emit their splendor,
Purifying and refining the form.
Within the **Divine Pool** (神津), they wash with fragrant waters,
Refining the essence, the light shines clear.
The **Heavenly Pure Ones** (上清) are radiantly revealed.
The **Essential Qi** (炁) shall not receive defilement,
And the **Five Palaces** (五府) shall receive the spirit.
The **Three Paths** (三涂) are extinguished, the **Nine Underworlds** (九冥) are dispelled.
The **roots of evil** (恶根) are severed, blessings spontaneously arise.
Today’s grand vow is now fully proclaimed.
The body receives liberation, ascending to the **Celestial Court** (帝庭).

Next, we again recite the **Mantra of Bathing and Refining the True Essence** (沐浴炼真咒):
*"The **Supreme Orthodox Master** (太上高真), essence of the **Nine Spirits** (九灵).
Lifting the soul to heaven, ascending the **Purple Court** (紫庭).
Bathing in the **Flower Pool** (华池), the body and spirit are purified.
The essence penetrates the **Great Void** (太虚), all **Essential Qi** (万炁) spontaneously generated."*

Next, the **Daoist priest** (法师) recites the **Great Mantra of Bathing in the Crimson Yang and Refining the Departed Soul** (沐浴丹阳炼度亡魂大咒):
*"The **Dragon Han Dynasty** (龙汉) flows boundlessly,
Formless and nameless.
Vast and distant, eons without end,
The **Celestial Dao/Way** (皇道) opens to purity.
The **Divine Lamps** (神灯) shine bright,
And the **Nine Souls** (九魂) emit their essence.
The **Jade Void** (玉虚) clears its radiance,
And the **Great Celestial Mist** (太霞) ascends in splendor.
The **Primordial Beginning** (元始) unfolds creation,
And all **celestial beings** (诸天) align in harmony.
The **Three Primordial Cycles** (三元) nurture and guide,
And the **Two Symbols** (二象) encompass life.
Those already refined shall be perfected,
And those not yet complete shall attain clarity.
The dead shall be transformed,
And the withered shall bloom anew.
Crawling insects and stagnant vapors,
All spirits and souls are liberated.
Those who bear life in the womb,
Shall all receive the blessing of rebirth.
The departed **so-and-so** (亡者命过) shall pass beyond,
Their souls returning to the **Three Pure Ones** (三清).
Their **ethereal bodies** (魄) shall be refined,
And in the **Southern Celestial Palace** (南宫), their forms shall be reborn.
Today’s great fortune is proclaimed—
All shall receive illumination.
The **Five Emperors** (五帝) observe and reflect,
And all spirits are universally notified.
The gods of **Earth and Heaven** (天地神祇),
And all **river sources** (诸河源).
The **Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Rivers** (五岳四渎),
And all **named mountains** (诸名山).
The **Mystic Profound** (洞玄), the **Mystic Void** (洞虚),
The **Void of Space** (洞空), the **Mystic Immortals** (洞仙).
The **Great Saint of the Boundless** (无极大圣),
And the **Supreme True and Sublime Deity** (至真尊神).
The **Limitless and Boundless** (无穷无极),
All oversee and refine the living.
The **earthly roots of sin** (地根) are severed,
And the **Mystic Capital** (玄都) records their names.
All gods unite in witness,
And all spirits hear in unison."*

Next, the **Daoist priests** (道众) recite the **Ode of Bathing in the Eastern Well** (沐浴东井颂),
As in the **Threefold Invocation** (如三启吟),
And display the **Chart of the Twenty-Four Generations** (二十四生图经):
*"The **Celestial River** (天河) pours into the **Eastern Well** (东井),
Where the **Stone Deities** (石景) and **Water Mother** (水母) gather their essence.
The **Round Radiance** (圆光) sweeps across the **Spiritual Luminaries** (灵曜),
And the **Mystic Profound Light** (玄晖) gleams in high clarity.
The **Primordial Beginning** (元始) unveils the **Double Night** (重夜),
And **heavenly beings** (天人) follow the **moon’s cycles** (逐月生).
Above the **Orchid Pool** (兰池) of bathing,
Dragons bear the **long rope** (长绠) and **bottle** (瓶).
The **Golden Boy** (金童) scatters fragrant flowers,
And the **Jade Maiden** (玉女) flows the **Five Stars** (五星).
With **jade belts and crowns** (冠带), they wash in the **jewel waters** (玉津),
Refining the **Five Immortals’ Forms** (五仙形).
Their **fragrant bodies** (体香) descend upon all spirits,
And they ascend the **High Clarity** (高清) on the **Celestial Vehicle** (乘景).
Next, the **Daoist priests** (道众) recite the **Ode of Dispersing the Rites** (散法事毕).
Next, they roll up the **outer silk curtains** (卷起裹面帘幕).

Then, when the bath is complete,
The **Daoist priest** (法师) recites the **Mantra of Crowns and Belts** (冠带咒):
*"The **Five Turbidities** (五浊) are now purified,
And the **Eight Landscapes** (八景) are illuminated.
Today they receive refinement—
Their sins are extinguished, their blessings born.
Forevermore, they shall dwell with the **Five Emperors** (五帝),
And ascend to the **High Clarity** (上灵).
Next, they roll up the **outer curtains** (卷起外面帘).

Next, the **Daoist priests** (道众) recite the **Ode of the Daoist Rite of Water for Refining the Soul** (法水度魂颂):
*"Now the **bath of purification** (澡蠲) is completed,
And solemn purity (严洁) is achieved.
In **rainbow robes** (霓衣) resplendent and fragrant,
Their **cloud-like feet** (云趾) move gently as they leave the chamber.
Before the **Three Sublime Ones** (三尊之御),
We proclaim the **Alliance of the Nine Keys** (盟九钥之科).
Transmitting the **precepts** (传戒), receiving the **symbols** (受符),
They transcend the mundane and enter the **sacred** (超凡入圣).
May they all attain the **wondrous fruits** (妙果),
And swiftly realize the **extraordinary destiny** (殊缘).
Their **ethereal souls** (灵魄) preserved,
Shall bow and follow the guidance."*

Next, the **rites of the Dao** welcome and guide the departed soul, with a Daoist priest along the path sprinkling purified water and reciting the **celestial mantras and hidden speech** of the *dharma*. Upon reaching the side of the **Three Pure Ones**, they face the northeast corner, set out incense, flowers, and a small table, along with a prayer mat and a small brazier. Before the incense table, they command the departed soul to stand on the mat and listen to the **teachings**.

Then, the **master** humbly addresses the **Three Pure Ones, Most High Saints, and Ten Directions of Spirits**:
*"We humbly appeal to Your lofty grace and profound mercy for this devout plea.
Today, the departed **Over** [name] has completed the rites of incense and purification, now adorned in solemn ritual array.
Before the **Most High’s** divine decree, we reverently receive the **true precepts** of return.
It is fitting to solemnly purify oneself and reverently follow the **doctrines**.

Do not display the demeanor of arrogance, lest one forfeit the fruits of merit.
At that time, **Yuan Shi Tianzun** was in the **Fragrant Grove Garden**, within the **Great Blessing Hall**, teaching the **dharma of life and death, karma, and past virtues** to the celestial hosts, the rulers of the **Three Realms**, and all spirits.

Then, **Jiu Ku Zhenren** respectfully addressed the **Tianzun**:
*'Your servant has witnessed within the **dark realms and hells**, in the **Northern Prefecture of Luo and Cheng**, that all departed souls suffer torment—some clinging to the **Sword Tree**, others treading the **Mountain of Knives**. Pounded in mortars, roasted in caldrons, their limbs shattered, blood flowing, they endure endless death and rebirth without respite. Yet among them, one stands unharmed, fearless, wandering freely, untouched by suffering. A **auspicious light and sacred qi** shields them—we do not know what merit this person has earned.'*

The **Tianzun** replied:
*'Well spoken, well spoken. This person, in life, devoted their heart to the **Dao**, aspiring to virtuous connections. They once received the **Nine True Precepts** and the **True Symbol of Rescue**, carrying the **sacred talisman** and never faltering in their resolve. Thus, their departed soul finds joy and freedom, even within the hells, spared the wheel of suffering. Their name is erased from the **Black Register**, and they forever behold the light. They ascend to the **Southern Palace** and attain the **fruit of immortality**.

Now, before the **Three Pure Ones’** throne and the **Saints’** presence, we transmit the **precepts** for the departed soul. May they, after receiving them, uphold and practice with reverence, forever freed from darkness and ascending to bliss. Let them escape the **judgment of the underworld** and attain the **auspicious karmic ties of purity**.

We further hope for Your benevolent guidance, secretly aiding their lineage.
We follow the **rites and observe the solemnities**, transmitting the **scriptures and precepts** to the departed soul. May their **pure spirit** attentively receive the **sacred words**.

Next, the **gong** sounds, and all bow in reverence.

**First, taking refuge in the Three Treasures**:
We proclaim to the departed soul: *"The first refuge grants the merit of liberating sins and aiding suffering—ineffable and boundless. Now, following the **Tianzun’s** rites, we transmit them in order.
May their spirit stand solemnly, listening with devotion."*

**Next, the Nine True Precepts are explained to the departed soul**:
*"The first, receiving the **True Precept of Initiation**, forbids killing and stealing, practicing an **equal heart**. In future births, they will gain wisdom and clarity—hold fast to this resolve.
The second, receiving the **True Precept of Mindfulness**, forbids lust and desire, rejecting false views. In future births, they will gain wisdom and clarity—hold fast to this resolve.
The third, receiving the **True Precept of Upholding**, forbids jealousy and coveting unjust wealth. In future births, they will gain wealth and prosperity—hold fast to this resolve.
The fourth, receiving the **True Precept of Guarding**, cultivates benevolent thoughts without deceit. In future births, they will gain joy and peace—hold fast to this resolve.
The fifth, receiving the **True Precept of Protection**, abstains from alcohol, meat, and harming life. In future births, they will gain purity and ease—hold fast to this resolve.
The sixth, receiving the **True Precept of Cultivation**, cherishes all beings and awakens to the **Dao**. In future births, they will gain a **sacred body and virtuous nature**—hold fast to this resolve.
The seventh, receiving the **True Precept of Completion**, venerates the **Dao** and practices merit through fasting. In future births, they will manifest the **Ten Auspicious Signs**—hold fast to this resolve.
The eighth, receiving the **True Precept of Attainment**, retreats from the world to guide others, avoiding all evil. In future births, they will encounter the **Dao’s teachings**—hold fast to this resolve.
The ninth, receiving the **True Precept of Ascension**, honors the **master’s instructions** without slacking. In future births, they will become a **Great Sovereign of the Law**—hold fast to this resolve.*

Thus, the **Nine True Precepts**, proclaimed by the **Most High’s** golden mouth, are now received. Having upheld them, their spirit is bound—
For the **precepts are strict and their prohibitions weighty**. Relying on the **power of the Nine True**, they forever escape the **Five Sufferings**. They ascend directly to the **Southern Palace**, entering the **Purple Bureaus**, where **Golden Boys** guide them and **Jade Girls** welcome them in joy and ease.

The **Supreme Dao Treasure, the Ten Directions of Saints, and the Three Most High Ones** have, across countless eons, saved beings and established the **pre-heaven teachings**. With boundless compassion, they rescue all life. Their **jade forms and golden countenances** should always be revered.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Ten Directions’ Dao Treasures**.
May the departed soul, with a pure heart, turn toward all and pay homage.

**Second refuge in the **Supreme Scripture Treasure****:
The **Ten Directions’ sacred texts**—**spiritual writings, golden scriptures, dragon-carved phoenix-sealed, thirty-six divisions, eighteen thousand sutras**—guide the lost to transcend the **Dao’s shores**. Each line erases sins, each word dispels calamity. In this life and beyond, they should always be revered.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Ten Directions’ Scripture Treasures**.
May the departed soul’s heart open to enlightenment, receiving and reciting them.

**Third refuge in the **Supreme Teacher Treasure****:
The **Mystic Sage of the Void, the Three Teachers of the Numinous Treasure, the Authentic One of Oneness, the Three Heavenly Masters, and the Ten Directions’ perfected immortals.***"*

汝等便可修行，持心在念。吾当为汝，说九真妙戒、金箓白简、救苦真符。汝等钦奉受持，勿生懈慢，即无为自在。况乃天尊设教，拯济沉沦，观罗酆阴暗之中，徧九地幽牢之内，见诸罪苦，报对轮回。万死千生，无有休息。是故天尊慈惠，哀愍众生，召九光童子、救苦真人，给付九真妙戒、金箓灵符，拔度罪魂，离苦解脱。各遂超生道岸，身入光明。

今则依按琼科，传符授戒。亡灵既已参受神识，便遂往生，消殁后之怨憎，解生前之冤结。伏愿侍经玉女、护戒灵童、飞天神王、巨天力士，遍下无极世界、九幽地狱之中，二十四曹、三十六府，与亡灵削名黑簿，灭罪阴关，开长夜之幽扃，指无为之道路。九霄宫内，常为游宴之方；八极天中，永作逍遥之界。尚虑功德未备，法制有亏，更为亡灵告盟众圣，出九幽坛牒，证此斋功。金箓真符，庶明券验。冀灵仪而保执为身，据以生方，地司无留滞之尤，天界有优游之趣。分明领受，咸使闻知。

次法师捧真符白简，祝日简，散坛时已对三宝读了，更不宣。当愿亡灵，受持金箓白简，永辞幽夜，径上南宫，无萦迷执之尤，克证逍遥之果。祝毕，给付与亡灵案子上。

次令道流一人，读九幽坛牒。宣读次法师祝牒：当愿亡灵，受持黄箓斋法、九幽坛牒，周圆斋事，执牒为凭。阴司更不拘留，地府永消罪录。魂神超度，灵识分明，一如宣示。祝毕，给付与亡灵案子上。

次启白入十真礼：伏以高晨元圣，既彰度品之慈；大暮沉灵，实假崇因之力。顾明科而式奉，仰幽魄以是资。已陈大洞之仪，荐格重霄之眷。南宫受度，将遂於嬉神；北府校愆，即期於削籍。殊喜昭集，妙荫溥临，已闻三宝之名，载举十真之号。

次举十真礼：
志心皈命礼，东方华林境界、惠静装严、无极之国、静境真人。愿普救亡魂，众和永出三涂苦。

次唱礼尽十方空界、一切真人，奉为亡灵，虔心忏悔。」

「Next, the chief monk kneels and offers repentance.
With sincere resolve, he repents on behalf of the departed soul for the crimes of excessive greed, wrath, anger, folly, and ignorance—transgressions of licentiousness, theft, murder, and life-taking. He repents for the defamation of scriptures and destruction of teachings, for failing to take refuge, for disdaining the Dao/Way, betraying the truth, and violating oaths. He repents for the ceaseless delusions of body and mind, for the insatiable cravings of ears and eyes that never cease. For sins committed in past, present, and future lives, and for the roots of transgression in the three worlds that are boundless and incalculable. Today, he vows to repent with all sincerity, seeking to eliminate all past hindrances and afflictions. Having now humbly confessed before the Dao/Way, the myriad saints shall surely witness and judge with impartial clarity.

With renewed resolve, he repents for the crimes of the six senses—hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking—along with the six desires and six emotions. He repents for the allure of music and song that drowns out true teachings, for the dazzling hues of purple and green that obscure proper colors. He repents for the competition in adornment with fragrant ornaments like orchids and musk, for the boastful display of carriages and horses in their fleeting moments of splendor. He repents for the unbridled indulgence in sweet and bitter tastes that harms one’s life, for the unchecked fluctuations of joy and anger that disrupt harmony. Though the six senses often lead to paths of ruin, the three treasures ever open gates of deliverance. Now, all past transgressions are laid bare, and he earnestly vows to eradicate every root of sin.

With sincere devotion, he prostrates and offers gratitude to the supreme and true three treasures.

Next, he recites the hymn of the Three Realms and Five Sufferings.
Next, he invokes the threefold homage.

All past merits have been fully accomplished.
Humbly, he hopes the departed soul may now ascend to the radiant and enlightened judgment.

May the departed soul attain the divine realm of the Jade Purity, its spirit forever dwelling in the crimson peaks.
May it wander freely through the ten extremes, dwelling at ease in the Three Pure Ones’ domain.
May its blessings flow abundantly, its joy extend to kin and descendants.
May all beings, without exception, ascend to the shores of the Dao/Way.

Next, the ritual concludes the summoning of the departed soul, returning it to its spiritual seat, and offers reverent placement.

Next, the chief monk announces:
Now, having completed the solemn rites before the three treasures and achieved triumphant merit, we must solemnly and respectfully receive the teachings with awe and reverence.
We prepare the grand feast, awaiting the opportune moment for its commencement.
We offer fragrant and exquisite delicacies, awaiting the fulfillment of the grand cause.

Now, on behalf of the departed soul, we invoke the sacred mantra of the Jade Purity’s luminous and refined offerings:
*"Looking back to the circular net of the heavens, containing light and drawing in the soul’s essence.
Binding the wandering spirit and subduing the seven shades, aligning thoughts with the central Dao/Way.
Moving, dwelling, and dissolving in the void, sleeping and resting in the hall of jade splendor.
Feasting on the yellow-walled lotus, quenching thirst with the nectar of the root of immortality.
The spirit’s essence merges with the Great Demon, uniting to refine the true light.
Illuminating the boundless vision, forever wandering in the celestial expanse.
Circular harmony vanishes at the waves’ edge, true transformation knows no end.
Mysterious and wondrous without beginning or end, the practitioner must know this truth.
Silent and empty, forgetting all teachings, yet responding to fate’s grand design.
Descending the Dao/Way, not reflecting upon itself, must first be applied as intended.
Returning to the origin of the two realms, merging or parting at will."*

Next, he announces again with solemnity:
Now, the sacred rites are fully completed, and the wondrous chants have been fully recited.
All causes are gathered, and all resources are provided for the passing soul.
Humbly, he hopes the departed soul’s spirit may not be lost, its journey boundless in the unseen realms.
May it escape the icy courts of the Five Sufferings, forever free from eternal night.
May it hear the Dao/Way of the Three Pure Ones, fully attaining the state of non-doing.
May blessings grace the household, and joy flow to beloved kin.
May all beings, without exception, ascend to the land of boundless virtue and longevity.

With prostration, he takes refuge in the boundless Great Dao/Way.

Next, the ritual concludes the descent, burning the departed soul’s talismans and written vows.

Next, he recites the hymn for burning the talismans:

*"The supreme and subtle law, the talismans and scriptures that guide souls to heaven.
From the beginning of time, the sacred talismans were proclaimed.
At their appointed hour, all attain elevation and ascent.
Transmitting teachings to save those drowning in suffering, all may freely soar.
The golden talismans bear the name, granting admittance to the Jade Emperor’s realm of boundless ease."*

Next, he performs the transfer of merit, reciting blessings for the departed soul’s release.

Then, he goes outside the great gate,
sets up a table with incense,
lights the incense,
and calls upon the homeless, lonely spirits, and lingering souls.

Humbly, he acknowledges that the wondrous Dao/Way of the heavens,
its virtues vast and profound,
...

The august sovereign rules the realm,
his virtue extending to both the living and the dead.
His boundless grace reaches all creatures,
and his benevolent influence descends like the night’s dew upon the thirsty.
All who dwell in darkness and obscurity
are granted private aid for their deliverance.
Revering the Dao/Way and honoring the departed,
he saves all beings alike.

Among them are heroes who aided their nations,
loyal ministers who served their lords,
who, when danger arose, did not spare their own lives
but sacrificed themselves for the chariot-borne sovereign.
Some perished in the desert wastes,
others died upon the battlefield.
Their bones lay unburied,
their spirits lingering in torment.

Some served in distant outposts,
rushing on commands to the four quarters.
They succumbed to plague or met violent ends,
their lives cut short by injury or misfortune.
Blocked by ancestral roots or distant kin,
they were abandoned in spring, summer, autumn, and winter,
forsaken in sacrifice.

Some sought fame in distant lands,
trading east and west,
traversing mountains and rivers, crossing seas.
They fell to venomous beasts or perished in raging waves,
their ships dashed upon the rocks.

Some entered the empty gate in youth,
long adhering to the Release-Teaching.
In seclusion among groves and valleys,
they dwelled in solitude, content in quietude,
their hearts yearning for cultivation,
their spirits embracing solitude.

Some wandered as wayfarers,
some managed alms for the living.
Day by day, their lives waned,
their fates drifting toward transformation.

Some loathed the vulgar world,
their hearts set on the realm of immortals.
They cultivated the name of pure, unadulterated virtue,
dwelling in azure peaks beyond the dust of men.
Yet they could not fulfill the Dao/Way of eternal life,
nor escape the fleeting hours of mortal time.

Some mastered brush and ink, their skill in medicine unmatched.
Through such pursuits, they died as strangers in foreign lands.
Some labored in service, bound in toil and servitude.
Some were wronged and met dark fates,
others, without recourse, took their own lives.
Their spirits, restless and unmoored,
drifted without refuge.

Some became bandits or rebels,
traitorous ministers who defied their sovereign,
bearing guilt that doomed them to the shadowed depths,
where they dared to resent their fate.

Some scorned the sacred laws,
or failed to honor their parents,
and thus incurred celestial wrath, meeting untimely ends,
or fell under the weight of their crimes.

Some perished in poverty and cold,
others fled the law to hide in obscurity.
Desperate, they took their lives in forests or rivers,
or were devoured by beasts,
or burned alive in fire and flood.

Male or female, young or old—
though their names may be unknown,
they are summoned here in hope.
First, they are purified in sacred baths,
cleansing their spirits,
and partake in the feast of the law-assembly.

Now, the devout sponsor, [Name],
offers rites for the departed [Name],
marking the seventh sevens, anniversaries, hundred days, or three-year solemnities,
and commissions [number] Daoists to venerate the spirit tablet
or the abode of the departed,
opening the Supreme Yellow Talisman Great Fast
for [number] days and nights.
A Nine-Depths Pure Expiation is established,
golden talismans and scriptures are worshipped,
offerings of night feasts and spirit-fasts are made,
and all departed souls ascend to the Dao/Way’s fruit.

Humbly, we beseech the lingering spirits of the underworld,
the solitary souls of distant paths—
those who respond and come,
all bathe in the orchid-scented waters;
unhindered, they enter the feast,
listening to the proclamation of teachings and precepts.
If their spirits yet linger,
may they now partake.

Next, the ritual guides the solitary souls to the bath chamber,
with a Daoist along the way,
who sprinkles pure water to cleanse impurities,
reciting the hidden mantras of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens.
Upon reaching the bath chamber,
a Daoist stirs the water in the basin,
beginning from the southwest,
twisting it thirty-two times to the left,
and recites the Water of the Law incantation:

*"Supreme Most-High divine water,
the numbers of the Five Phases.
It nurtures life and gives birth to things,
washing away the old to bring forth the new.
Quenching thirst sustains life,
while death’s sufferings find no relief.
Were it not for boundless compassion,
how could salvation be granted?"*
The Supreme Most-High, the Most Exalted, recites this one line.

Next, they proceed to the women’s bath chamber,
stirring the water and reciting the same incantation.
Then, lowering the bath chamber’s curtain,
the Daoist assembly chants the Scattering Flowers ritual.
After the bath is complete,
the master priest reports:

*"Again, we invoke the Yellow Earth’s submerged souls,
the departed of the spirit platform.
Now that the orchid bath is complete,
all have attained purity and emptiness.
Each abandons evil thoughts,
harmonizing in concord.
They should now take their places in order,
approaching with reverence to the feast.
Feasting on fragrant delicacies,
let them not cling to delusion.
All shall be liberated,
freed from the prisons of darkness.
Through all future lives,
may they dwell forever in the Land of Bliss."*

Next, the ritual guides the solitary souls
to the unmarked feast seats.
The master priest and Daoist assembly circumambulate the *jiāogào*,
chanting the Light-Bringing Hymn:

*"The Supreme Most-High Dao/Way Lord,
dwelling in the realm of Non-Action.
The Precious Light True Child,
descends to govern the Nine-Depths Hall.
Pitiful are the tormented spirits,
rescued from their sorrow and pain.
Through the twenty-four gates,
all are made to perceive the sacred fragrance.
Lamps illuminate the endless night,
dissolving the burdens of countless kalpas."*

Next, they proceed to the positions of the Underworld officials,
breaking the *Twenty-Four Hells Scroll* (as recorded separately),
and, one by one, dismantling the banners,
removing the position plaques.

Then, entering the *Jiāogào*’s southern gate,
they chant the *Four-Voiced Summoning of the Sound-Saving Heavenly Worthy*,
with the assembly responding in harmony.

Next, they recite the *Unending Lament* three times,
each time first responding with the Four-Voiced Merit,
and concluding with the Most Exalted:

*"The Nine-Depths’ darkness is unbearable—
all who arrive are sinners alike.
In the murky void, light is scarce,
yet the Most Compassionate Supreme Most-High comes to save.
Great Compassion, Great Mercy—
the Sound-Saving Heavenly Worthy has arrived."
The assembly responds: "The Most Exalted."*

*"Hungry ghosts and wretched spirits are all liberated,
debtors and creditors alike tremble in fear.
Mountains of blades and forests of swords are crushed,
cauldrons of boiling oil and furnaces are extinguished.
Great Compassion, Great Mercy—
the Sound-Saving Heavenly Worthy has arrived."
The assembly responds: "The Most Exalted."*

*"Constructed by hatred and enmity,
the hells of suffering—
yet turning the heart brings joy as heaven.
The Most Exalted’s power is unfathomable;
may the light of compassion proclaim the teachings."
The assembly responds: "The Most Exalted."*

Next, the master priest exits through the *Jiāogào*’s northern gate,
chanting the Four-Voiced Merit alone,
and recites the *Nine-Depths Lament for the Suffering Spirits*
as he proceeds to the place of proclamation:

*"Born into the realm of suffering,
endlessly cycling through the Five Paths.
The Nine-Depths’ eternal night is sealed,
and kalpas pass without a glimmer of light."*

Mountains of blades and trees of swords,
poisoned edges rising in sharp array.
No crows gather in sight—
only the voices of tormented spirits heard.
The howling wind stirs the endless night,
lamentations echo through the frosty hall.

Above, the souls who tread the blade-mountains,
never know a moment’s peace.
Hunger forces them to eat the crooked well’s embers,
thirst compels them to drink the molten fire’s essence.
Dragged through the Three Realms of suffering,
do they even recognize their own forms or names?
To think you know not your fate—
how grievous, how cruel to human feeling!

Great Compassion, Great Mercy—
the Sound-Saving Heavenly Worthy has arrived.
The assembly responds: *"The Most Exalted."*

Next, the master priest turns toward the Ghost Gate couch,
takes his seat in order.
He begins the Hall Proclamation Chant,
then proclaims the Teaching and Precept Ceremony—
opening the scripture, closing the scripture,
explaining the causes and effects of karma,
and all within the ritual, the proclamation complete.
He recites the *Three Verses on the Heavenly Worthy’s Passing* at its end.

Next, the priestly rites lead him to the outer gate,
where first the departed souls are burned,
along with offerings for lonely spirits—
money, silk, and colored goods.
He then recites the *Burning Incantation Chant.*

Next, he makes the transfer of merit,
reciting auspicious verses and dispelling evil.
He reascends the incense and flames,
establishing the *Nine-Depths Exorcism.*
First, he goes before the Mysterious Master,
chanting praises and walking the path.
He begins the Hall Proclamation Chant,
then proclaims the Exorcism Ceremony—
as before.
He recites the *Chant for Escorting the True Souls,*
then burns the memorial tablets.
Finally, he makes the transfer of merit,
reciting auspicious verses and dispelling evil.
