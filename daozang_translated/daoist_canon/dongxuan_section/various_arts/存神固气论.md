### **On the Position of the Crucible and Cauldron**
The beginning and end of the Four Symbols, the transformation and generation of the myriad things, all depart not from the *wu-ji* crucible. The fire and essence of *wu-ji* thus arise, and only thereafter can creation be wrought. Therefore, the perfected one, amid the mutual restraint of Metal and Wood and the ascending and descending of Water and Fire in their balanced harmony, possesses the numinous substance of creation, enabling life to persist without perishing and generation to continue without end.

### **The Inversion of Yin and Yang**
Yin and Yang are mutually seeking forces. *Li* is Fire; deprived of Water, it desiccates, and when desiccation reaches its extreme, its salvation lies in *Kan*. *Kan* is Water; deprived of Fire, it freezes, and when freezing reaches its extreme, its salvation lies in *Li*. The *Li* palace receives blood and stores Lead—within Yang there is Yin—thus it does not desiccate but remains clear and cool. The *Kan* palace receives qi and stores Mercury—within Yin there is Yang—thus it does not freeze but remains warm. Though *Li* contains Lead, when blood stirs, Fire arises and transforms it into Mercury. Though *Kan* contains Mercury, when qi stirs, Water arises and transforms it into Lead. Thus, one who knows *Kan* as Water does not perceive the hidden qi of Mercury within! And one who knows *Li* as Fire does not perceive the hidden blood of Lead within! At the moment of transformation, Lead and Mercury naturally ascend and descend in mutual pursuit. Herein lies the perfected one’s principle of the inversion of *Kan* and *Li*.

### **The Old and Young of Yin and Yang**
When the number exceeds thirty-two, Yin and Yang gradually age. When Yang ages, its blackness wanes, and it must be saved by Young Yin. When Yin ages, its blood wanes, and it must be saved by Young Yang. Old Yin seizes Young Yang, as *Kun* is followed by *Fu*. Old Yang seizes Young Yin, as *Qian* is followed by *Gou*. Metal and Wood are the Old Yin and Yang; their mutual restraint gives birth to the Young Yin and Yang. In humans, *Qian* and *Kun* are the Old, while *Gen* and *Dui* are the Young. Yet the creative transformation’s conception of old and young is not singular. Herein lies the perfected one’s marvelous intent to seize creation itself.

### **The Mutual Pursuit of Water and Fire**
Water encounters Fire and thus receives qi; having received qi, it generates without exhaustion and does not flee. Fire encounters Water and thus takes form; having taken form, it lives without extinction and does not fly. When True Water seeks True Fire, Yin is abundant and Yang scarce, and Lead is transformed. When True Fire seeks True Water, Yang is abundant and Yin scarce, and Mercury is transformed. Mercury must seek Lead, thus descending into *Kan*. Lead must seek Mercury, thus ascending into *Li*. In their ascent and descent, they are captured by *wu-ji*, mutually consuming and yearning until they congeal and transform. Herein lies the perfected one’s principle of harmonizing Yin and Yang, the marvelous art of return, augmentation, and seizing.

### **The Mutual Restraint of Metal and Wood**
Metal does not overcome Wood; Wood does not receive qi. When it receives qi, Fire is born. Fire does not overcome Metal; Metal does not receive qi. When it receives qi, Water is born. By summoning Metal with Metal, it moves and overcomes Wood. By summoning Fire with Fire, it moves and overcomes Metal. Once Water and Fire are born, harmony is summoned by harmony, and they naturally seek one another to create things. Herein lies the perfected one’s method of enabling the Water and Fire within the crucible to seek one another, for he has attained the supreme principle of what generates life.

### **The Return of the Five Phases**
The principle of the myriad things is this: when they return to the mother, their roots are deep and their stems firm, possessing the Dao of longevity. When they scatter to the child, their flowers bloom and leaves flourish, possessing the principle of decline and decay. The child’s decay and the mother’s waning are the forward movement of the Five Phases. Long life and enduring vision are the non-forward movement of the Five Phases. At the moment when the numinous substance of creation arises in the Central Palace, once creation is accomplished, the child conceals itself in the mother’s womb, and the mother contains the child’s embryo. Thus, the Dragon emerges from Fire, and the Tiger is born from Water—herein lies the principle of return and inversion. When the kingly qi flourishes, it unifies and declines.

### **The Flourishing and Decline of the Kingly Qi**
The initial arising of Fire is the flourishing qi of Yang. The initial arising of Water is the flourishing qi of Yin. When Yang advances without cease, at noon it must wane. When Yin advances without cease, at full moon it must wane. As the kingly qi gradually declines, the perfected one possesses the principle of intercepting the kingly qi within the crucible. Thus, like spring, it does not reach autumn; like the sun’s ascent, it does not reach its zenith; like the flower’s bloom, it does not reach its decay.

### **Augmenting the Fire and Timing**
Essence is the mother of qi, yet it cannot move itself—its movement lies in qi. Qi is the mother of spirit, yet it cannot move itself—its movement lies in spirit. This is why True Lead gives birth to the spirit-fire, and the spirit-fire subjugates True Lead. The perfected one moves qi with spirit, and naturally qi abides without flying. He moves essence with qi, and naturally essence abides without fleeing. When the Three Substances do not leave the crucible’s fire, the Gate of Life opens. When they depart from the crucible’s fire, they return to the Door of Death. The reason the perfected one transmits the method but not the fire is that, in the moments of capture, refinement, and augmentation, the timing of the fire is the spirit’s most subtle work—something that cannot be conveyed through entreaty.

### **The Dragon and Tiger’s Pivot**
Heaven and Earth intermingle in misty vapor, thus the pivot is first established at the Mysterious Ultimate. In its giving and receiving, its measured augmentation, the primordial qi generates without end. When humans first receive Lead and Mercury from their parents, the pivot is established. The primordial qi thus generates through this substance, and this substance relies on the primordial qi for nourishment. Therefore, with every inhalation and exhalation, it persists unbroken. Once paired with Metal and Wood to generate the numinous substance, one should ingest the Dragon and Tiger, absorb the primordial harmony, and assist in their nourishment. Naturally, the fetal qi will transform, and generation will continue without end.

### **The Movement and Stillness of Nature and Emotion**
There are four principles from which the nature of things cannot escape: the heart of daily renewal, nature, and emotion. Where there is life, there must be a heart. Where there is a heart, there must be nature. Where there is nature, there must be emotion. Nature is still and settled; emotion is responsive and communicative. At the moment of responsiveness, the two qi must interact. When they interact externally, the Dragon and Tiger fly and flee, and Lead and Mercury leak away. When they interact internally, the Dragon and Tiger follow one another, and Lead and Mercury congeal within. The internal congealment of Lead and Mercury is what gives birth to qi.

Thus, when qi enters the body, it is called life; that by which life is communicated is called the Dao. The perfected person (至人) masters emotion through the Dao, and in the midst of the misty union (氤氲), is able to stabilize the mysterious embryo. Within the realm of the indistinct and vague (恍惚), they seize the forms of things. This is how the Dao unites as one, achieving the wondrous work of both form and spirit.

### **The Body’s Division into Form and Transformation**
That which arises from form comes from within yin and yang; that which arises from transformation emerges beyond yin and yang. What comes from yin and yang holds the principle of preserving form and abiding in the world—thus, within what seems useless lies true use. What is useful must seize the creative power of yin and yang. What emerges beyond yin and yang possesses the Dao of soaring spirit and roaming nature—thus, within effort lies non-effort. Only through non-effort can one transcend beyond forms, mastering the sequence of advance and retreat to refine the colored body into transformation, and ultimately shed the transformed body to transmute spirit into fruition. To seek sudden transcendence without sequence is a principle unheard of.

### **The True Essence of Fetal Breathing**
Though the world says the embryo is knit from qi, and qi breathes from the embryo, how can it be merely that the spirit and qi do not scatter, cultivated through long practice of breathing? Those who fail to grasp the true essence (真趣) remain ignorant of its heavenly reach. Seated in stillness like a clod of earth, accumulating practice in emptiness and quiescence, they pass their lives in vain, no more than dreamers lost in slumber. In nurturing the elixir and knitting the embryo, they remain far from the goal of abiding in eternal youth!

Moreover, the principle of generation and transformation holds that solitary yang cannot generate, nor can solitary yin complete. The perfected person speaks of nurturing the sacred embryo to seek an exit, for the Lead of Kan (坎) and Mercury of Li (离) must not remain isolated. Without the union of Dragon and Tiger, who could establish the pivot at the mysterious extremity, abide in primordial harmony, and breathe the embryo?

### **Quiescence and Non-Action**
When ashes are dead and wood withered, fire and wood have nothing to rely upon. Though clods may gather and dust accumulate, metal and water have no means to arise, the Four Symbols no means to operate—thus, the elixir becomes a discarded thing, the crucible and furnace mere empty vessels. Failing to stabilize the immortal mysterious embryo, one sinks into quiescent extinction; failing to seize the divine mechanism of creation, one clings to inert emptiness. The perfected person, having seen the five thieves and prospered, rides the Fire Dragon and mounts the Metal Tiger, holding the cosmos in hand and giving birth to the myriad transformations in the body. Ultimately, both form and spirit are transformed, and one roams the supreme wondrous realm. How could they ever discuss emptiness and quiescence, merely withering away to perish with dust and clods?

### **The Method of Perfecting Both Form and Spirit**
Seeking within, nature (性) resides in the heart, and life (命) in the kidneys. Those who know the Dao return nature to life, uniting the kidneys with the heart. The five qi intermingle and return as one to the central axis of wu-ji (戊己). The True Lord Wei (魏真君) spoke of the "three fives as one" precisely for this reason.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* refers to the "three fives as one." The Five Phases reverse: fire generates wood, water generates metal. Counting by generative numbers, water is one and metal four, making five; fire is two and wood three, making five; earth’s number is also five—these are the three fives. Gathered into one, it is called "three fives as one." The *Yellow Court Classic* states: "The Five Phases mutually generate, ultimately returning to one." In light of this, how could the intent of Lord Wei not be luminously clear?

Those who awaken to this principle will understand the meaning of breath, and the essence of yang’s radiance will become visible. The essence of yang’s radiance is cinnabar; cinnabar is the great medicine. Since ancient times, those who cultivate nature and life have all attained transcendence through the great medicine. Yet to know nature but not life is to cling to emptiness without transformation—thus, Master Zhongli (锺离先生) said: "Those who cultivate only true nature and not the elixir will later find transformation difficult." To know life but not nature is to have a darkened form without a master—thus, the True Lord Mao (茅真君) said: "Merely mastering qi circulation makes one a transcendent." Hence, nature and life, if cultivated alone, cannot succeed.

To cultivate nature, one must perfect the spirit through the Dao; to cultivate life, one must extend the form through technique. When Dao and technique align, nature and life unite. Thus, the *Scripture of Great Peace* states: "The spirit is perfected through the Dao; the form is extended through technique." This serves as proof.

### **The Central Source**
I once read the *Yin Convergence Classic with Commentary by the Grand Duke*, which states: "Among the hundred methods of the golden elixir, the essential lies in the divine water of the Flowery Pond." Not yet understanding the true meaning, I traveled to Mount Tai and met a scholar reciting:

*"How vast and clear the heavens and earth!*
*The Dao of yin and yang may be achieved.*
*The Flowery Pond and divine water*
*Lie entirely in the essence of Tiger and Dragon."*

I inquired of him, and he gave his name as Pu, style Yuan-gui. He said:

*"Where do flowers bloom?*
*Amid green leaves, red buds appear.*
*Who dyes them with such hues?*
*How can they rival the softness of creation?"*

Still unenlightened, Pu continued:

*"How hard is stone! How soft is water!*
*Who would willingly grind them together?*
*Stone’s nature is earth, water flows with moisture—*
*How could one know the beauty of the tender calyx?"*

Moreover, "hua" (华) means flower, and flower means transformation; transformation arises from fire. "Chi" (池) means pond, which is water—the sign of water and fire. Water and fire are the flowing essence of the sun and moon, able to generate and complete the myriad things, the most numinous in the world. All things bear yin and embrace yang to be formed. How do flowers bloom? How do they bear fruit? They receive yin to spread branches and embrace yang to form fruit; within the fruit lies the kernel, preserving the seed to conceive. Just as human nature and emotion take shape in the mother’s womb, gradually forming the body.

The golden elixir corresponds to the mysterious image of the sun and moon, the root of the myriad things. The rise and fall of Dragon and Tiger, the interaction of water and fire, the seasonal nodes—through these, one may attain longevity. It is also said: Lead is the Green Dragon, the ancestor of the Dao; Mercury is the White Tiger, the lineage of the Dao. Cultivating them to unite with spirit and sagehood transcends the common lead and mercury of the world.

Only by recognizing the root and origin can one know that mercury is born from cinnabar, and gold is produced from lead. This Dao accords above with the celestial mind, below with earthly principles, and at the center with human essence—its transformations are unfathomable.
