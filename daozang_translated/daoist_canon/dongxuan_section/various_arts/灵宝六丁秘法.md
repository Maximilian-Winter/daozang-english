The Esoteric Method of the Six Ding of the Numinous Treasure

The Yellow Emperor said: When the primordial qi divided, yin and yang found their places, the Five Phases were aligned, and the Six Jia were born. Thus, one Jia encompasses ten spirits, and the Six Ding are the deities who preside over the ten-day cycles of the Six Jia.

These spirits originated with Heaven and Earth, yet when the battles against Chiyou proved futile, they threw the cosmic order into chaos. Thereupon, the Emperor purified himself, performed rites with utmost reverence, and supplicated the Supreme Mystery. Moved by his devotion, the Mysterious Maiden of the Nine Heavens descended and bestowed upon him this true method, enabling him to repel misfortune and aid all beings for the benefit of humankind.

The Yellow Emperor cultivated this method and achieved victory over Chiyou. He inscribed talismans in plain white script and concealed them in renowned mountains. Later generations have repeatedly encountered them.

This method possesses numinous efficacy, which cannot be fully expounded. Should one transmit it carelessly or treat it with irreverence, thereby offending the true spirits, both parties shall suffer calamity.

This Daoist gate of method is a wondrous formula for delivering the world. Ancient renowned generals all received this transmission. Thus, they could foresee victory or defeat, discern good and ill fortune in advance, and clearly distinguish the wise from the foolish—all with divine assistance.

If one is not a heroic and enlightened person, or lacks predestined affinity with the Dao, they should not engage with this text, lest they waste their years in vain.

The Yellow Emperor said: The names of the Six Jia, Six Ding, and the divine maidens must first be purified with clean water to dispel impure qi before one may unroll the scripture, make offerings, and recite prayers to examine it. Should one violate this, misfortune shall extend to the nine generations of ancestors, and they shall be eternally enslaved by the Three Officials. Moreover, their heads may be mutilated, their forms destroyed, and they must never recklessly disclose this to those unworthy of the Dao.

He who transmits this must do so as if serving a strict teacher. Guard your speech and do not disseminate it carelessly. Refrain from taking life in vain, constantly practice hidden virtue, and cultivate a compassionate heart to save all beings. Always observe these precepts, refrain from idle speech, and make offerings to invoke the spirits. Thus, you shall foreknow future events, perceive the signs of things ten thousand miles away, and comprehend even the subtlest intentions—every action and movement shall be known.

If you have matters to attend to, divine and inquire of them, and the answers shall be immediately revealed.

To summon the Six Ding spirits: Dengming and Hekui are invoked on a *ding-mao* day in the third spring month; Taiyi and Tiangang, on a *ding-hai* day in the third autumn month; Chuansong and Xiaoji, on a *ding-you* day in the third summer month; Gongcao and Daji, along with Shenhou, on a *ding-chou* day in the third winter month. If the day falls on *ding-wei* or *ding-si*, when their power is at its peak, they may be summoned in pairs to descend among men. To discern good or ill fortune, invoke them and inquire—they shall answer at once.

**Method of Offering and Invocation**
For the offering, prepare a clean mat, a new cloth towel, six portions of dried venison, six portions each of chestnuts and jujubes, six measures of fine wine, six measures of ghee and honey, one censer of incense, and six candles. Sweep a room clean, arrange the offerings, and sit quietly for a time. Speak softly so none may overhear, meditate upon the spirits for a while, then recite the invocation:

"Six Ding Jade Maidens, attend me and my master,
Survey the world, ensure all undertakings prevail,
Fathom past and future, repel noxious *qi*,
Dispel misfortune.
Be my companions, and I shall honor you always,
Offering wine, food, and dried meats,
Granting every wish without fail.
Those who seek the Dao and immortality,
Or request aid in refining elixirs,
Shall attain their desires.
May divine immortals descend and unite with the true Way."

*Hasten as the command of the Most High!*

**Method of Invoking the Six Ding with Talismans**
Prepare a clean mat, a six-foot cloth towel, six portions each of dried venison, wine, fruit, and fried cakes, and one censer of incense. Sweep a room clean and arrange the offerings. From the *jiazi* day, observe abstinence for three days. In a secluded chamber, burn incense, pray with utmost sincerity, and make your vows. On the day of the Six Ding, at the hour of *hai*, face the direction of their current dominance and inscribe the images of the Six Ding spirits and their talismans, laying them upon the mat. Light incense, bow deeply toward the east, and click your teeth thirty-six times. Recite the incantation:

"Nurtured by Heaven, born of Earth,
Receiving the divine talisman, one may attain long life.
Immortal beings assist me, Jade Maidens sustain my form,
The twenty-eight constellations record the names of the stars.
The Five Directions, the Five Colors—black and white, red and blue,
The Yellow Emperor of the Center—all accompany me.
After receiving the talisman, may all wishes be fulfilled,
Vanquishing all malevolent spirits.
Those who know not their own truth shall not claim mine;
Those who know not their own divinity shall not claim mine.
Advance to be enfeoffed as a marquis,
Or retreat to be beheaded.
*Hasten as the law commands!*"

To craft talismans, first purify oneself for three days—seven days is also acceptable. When inscribing the talisman, sit facing the auspicious direction, compose the mind in stillness, and maintain a demeanor as if in the presence of the divine. Recite the incantation:

"With reverence, I invoke the immortal officers of the Six Ding:
The Ding-mao spirit,
The Ding-you spirit of the Foot Day,
The Ding-hai spirit of Primordial Heaven,
The Ding-you spirit of Great Brightness,
The Ding-wei spirit of Salvation and Divine Efficacy,
The Ding-si spirit riding the purple clouds,
The Vermilion-Riding spirit of the *Canon*..."

The *Canon* states: In practicing this method, one must maintain a sincere and devout heart, free from distracting thoughts. Then, swallow the talismans in sequence, and the practitioner’s heart will rejoice, as if enlightened.

By the next morning, inscribe and swallow another talisman. After seven days, retire to a secluded chamber, arrange an altar, and sit upright. Prepare one portion each of incense, flowers, lamps, and candles. Inscribe the talisman of one’s proper position and the names of the spirits, placing them upon the mat. Face east, click the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the space between the five-colored clouds. Thereupon, the spirits will enter through the six gates and take their seats—do not gaze fixedly upon them. Simply concentrate the mind and present one’s wishes, and the prayer will surely be answered.

In ancient times, when Chiyou rebelled, the Yellow Emperor fought him repeatedly but could not prevail. The Emperor sighed, saying: "I have heard that in the time of Fuxi, there were no weapons, yet the world was governed in clarity, heaven and earth were at peace, and all under heaven was tranquil. Now Chiyou is but a commoner, yet I attack him without just cause and cannot overcome him—this is my failing." Before his lament had ceased, he suddenly beheld five-colored clouds descending from the sky. Within the clouds, two youths held a golden casket, and behind them, six immortal maidens appeared together, bearing the sacred command of the Nine Heavens Mysterious Maiden. They bestowed upon the Emperor the source of creation, the fortunes and misfortunes of heaven and earth, the waxing and waning of the eight trigrams, the transformations of wind and clouds, the success and failure of climatic qi, the victory and defeat of sun and moon, the gains and losses of yin and yang, the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of the stars, the compliance and defiance of human affairs, and the principles and methods of transformation.

The Emperor knelt in reverence to receive the gift. The youths ascended upon floating clouds and departed, and the six immortal maidens vanished. The Emperor then received the casket but dared not open it at once. He swiftly swept a chamber clean, purified himself for three days, and only then opened the casket. Within, he found a manual on the Six Ding, its upper scroll detailing the methods of offerings and sacrificial rites; the middle scroll expounding the Dao of long life and immortality; and the lower scroll teaching the arts of military strength, victory in battle, and the divination systems of Dunjia and Liuren.

The Method of Corpse-Liberation Taught by the Mysterious Woman. The Emperor followed the text with reverence and practiced it. Within ten days, he felt his body transformed, able to walk and fly. He again engaged Chiyou in battle, vanquishing him with a single drumbeat and driving him back to the source of Zhuolu. Was this not the result of obtaining the essence of primordial qi and dispelling the demonic miasma? Later, sensing the realm purified, heaven and earth restored to their proper places, and yin and yang maintaining their order, the Emperor cultivated the arts of long life and immortality. He personally composed a scroll titled *The Hidden Talisman Classic*, concealing its essential secrets. Thereafter, the Emperor ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

The *Hidden Talisman* states: The divine mechanisms of the Eight Trigrams and the Jiazi cycle conceal the workings of ghosts and spirits—this is the evolution of the Six Ding and Dunjia, the art of military strength and victory, derived from the Mysterious Woman of the Nine Heavens.

**The Six Ding Concealment Method**
The Six Ding are the true spirits of heaven and earth, unlike ordinary deities. The Azure Dragon, Bright Hall, and Great Yin—these spirits constantly accompany the Jade Maidens, serving within heaven and earth. If one wishes to conceal oneself, rendering oneself invisible to all things:

When the Azure Dragon reaches the Jade Maiden, one becomes unseen. To conceal oneself, hold a blade in the left hand and close the mouth, while the right hand traces a four-sided diagram. If evil persons are outside, draw the diagram six paces within the door. If they are within the door, draw it six paces in the courtyard. If they are in the central courtyard, draw it six feet within the chamber. If in the fields, draw it six *zhang* wide. Use counting rods one *chi* and two *cun* in length, following the Azure Dragon’s path in sequence, placing the rods straight until reaching the Gate of Heaven. Then, with the right hand, lay a rod horizontally to seal the Gate of Heaven and depart. Once the Gate of Heaven is sealed, the body is concealed. For each counting rod, visualize one person; when the Jade Maiden reaches the Great Yin and halts, imagine that outsiders can no longer see you.

The method states:
Dwell in the Azure Dragon, traverse the Star of Peng,
Pass through the Bright Hall, rest in the Great Yin,
Exit through the Gate of Heaven, enter the Earthly Door,
Hide beneath the Floral Canopy, conceal with the Jade Maiden.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes of the Supreme Lord command.*

On Dingmao days, conceal the body; on Dingsi days, conceal fate; on Dinghai days, conceal emolument; on Dingyou days, conceal the soul; on Dingwei days, conceal the spirit; on Dingchou days, conceal essence and spirit. For all matters on Six Ding days, recite the incantation six times:
*"Ren Gao protects me, Dingchou guards me, Ren He delivers me.
Dingyou preserves me whole, Ren Can governs the soul, Dingsi nurtures the spirit.
Great Yin and Floral Canopy, Earthly Door and Gate of Heaven.
I tread the Yu Steps, O True Person of the Mysterious Woman,
Bright Hall seated or reclining, conceal and hide the body.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes of the Mysterious Woman of the Nine Heavens command."*

For all offerings, consume them yourself; do not share with outsiders. Be ever cautious. On every Jiazi day, observe a day of purification.

**The Jade Maidens of the Six Ding:**
- **Dingmao Jade Maiden:** Named Wenbo, styled Ren Gao. The spirit wears a crown and ritual robes, holding a lotus in hand, clad in red above and blue below. She descends to the human realm on Zichou days. To know good or ill fortune, summon and inquire of her.
- **Dingchou Jade Maiden:** Named Wenjian, styled Ren Yang. The spirit holds a lotus in both hands, clad in red above and yellow below. She descends on Yinmao days. To know good or ill fortune, summon and inquire of her.
- **Dinghai Jade Maiden:** Named Wentong, styled Ren He. The right hand holds a mirror to her heart, the left a lotus, clad in red above and purple below. She descends on Chensi days. To know good or ill fortune, summon and inquire of her.
- **Dingwei Jade Maiden:** Named Shutong, styled Ren Ji. The left hand holds a mirror, the right a lotus, clad in red above and yellow below. She descends on Wuwei days. To know good or ill fortune, summon and inquire of her.
- **Dingsi Jade Maiden:** Named Tingqing, styled Ren Shu. The left hand holds a lotus, the right a white folded cloth, clad in brocade above and red below. She descends on Shenyou days. To know good or ill fortune, summon and inquire of her.
- **Dingyou Jade Maiden:** Named Wenqing, styled Ren Tong. The spirit cradles a child in her left arm, stroking its head with a white folded cloth in her right, clad in red above and white below. She descends on Xuhai days. To know good or ill fortune, summon and inquire of her.

The Yellow Emperor said: The Six Ding spirits each have distinct names and styles. To employ them, call each by name, and their divine efficacy will manifest.

The immortal scriptures state: The names of the Six Ding Jade Maidens may seem small, yet calling their names enables their use—all wishes will be granted.

**The Twelve-Hour Concealment Method with Counting Rods**
The song says:
The rat, losing its burrow, enters the dog’s market;
The ox enters the rabbit’s garden, halted by the cat.
The fierce tiger leaps to the south, reaching Si;
The rabbit enters the ox’s pen and lies still.
The dragon enters the horse’s stable to eat sweet grass;
The victorious snake coils, coming to Shen.
The horse enters the dragon’s spring to drink sweet water;
The sheep and chicken enter You together.
The agile monkey rises within the door’s wall;
The chicken flies and alights in the sheep’s pen.
The dog comes, the rat enters the Kan burrow;
The wolf blocks the east, drawn by the tiger.

Before each outing, recite the incantation:
*"Heaven overturns, earth overturns, heaven overturns, earth overturns,
The nine paths are all blocked.
Should anyone come pursuing me, let them be confounded here.
Let east become west, south become north.
Those who come by chariot, break their axles;
Those who come on horseback, cover their eyes;
Those who come on foot, swell their feet;
Those who come with weapons shall prostrate themselves and dare not rise.
The Bright Star and Northern Dipper repel the enemy.
Those who pursue me for ten thousand li shall perish; those who seek me shall halt.
The Oxherd and Weaver Girl transform into rivers and seas.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command."*

After reciting, place the counting rods with the left hand, tread the Yu Steps, close the qi, and depart.

**The Jade Maiden Incantation**
*"The Jade Maiden, celestial spirit, has arrived,
Ever attending my journey,
To such-and-such a place.
Vast and obscure, none perceive her form."*

None hear her voice, no ghost sees her essence.
Those who favor me gain fortune; those who harm me meet calamity.
Ghosts and bandits who oppose me die; those who encounter me perish.
A thousand, ten thousand people see me and rejoice.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

Upon reciting, immediately perform the door-closing method:
With the left hand, hold a blade and draw a line upon the earth to sever it, close the qi, and depart.

**Boundary Method**
Within the chamber: six feet.
Within the courtyard: six paces.
Beyond the gate: sixty paces.
In the wilds: six hundred paces—or six li.
Before each journey, invoke the Jade Maiden of the current旬 to protect me, lest the hundred ghosts harm me.
Let no one see me; those who do become firewood.
Open only my door, and close all others.

**General Incantation**
"I am the Celestial Eye, the Celestial Countenance,
Pursuing spirits like thunder and lightning,
Radiant to the eight directions,
Piercing sight within and without—
No being dares defy me.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command."

**Yu Steps and the Way of Silence**
**Six Ding Silent Ten-Thousand-One Method** (also called the *Xuanyuan Formula*)
First, burn incense and purify with clean water to dispel impure qi. Only then open the scroll, make offerings, and read.

Long ago, the Daoist Zhang Qun, aspiring to the Daoist arts, cultivated for many years, yearning for purity and emptiness. While perusing immortal secrets in leisure, he suddenly stood in the moonlit courtyard at the second watch of a *ding-chou* night. He saw a five-colored cloud approaching from the southwest, drawing nearer with the sound of marching footsteps. Suddenly, a woman appeared within the cloud, saying: "I am the Six Ding Jade Maiden, the *ding-chou* maiden."

Zhang Qun knelt and bowed deeply in reverence. The maiden said: "You have long admired the immortal Dao. I know your purity and slight inclination toward the profound. Thus, I come to transmit to you the wondrous gate of learning the Dao—though you lack the destiny of an immortal. If you fast and purify yourself for a hundred days, set up a brocade canopy in your chamber, and complete the hundred-day fast, I will return to teach you the method."

Zhang Qun fasted and purified himself for a hundred days, then set up a brocade canopy in his chamber. At the third watch of the night, as before, a procession arrived from the south within the clouds. First appeared two youths, bearing a golden casket, saying they offered the arts of cultivation. Zhang Qun received the golden casket, which contained the *Scripture of the Six Ding* in three scrolls: the upper scroll expounded the methods of sacrifice and ritual; the middle scroll, the arts of the Jade Maiden’s concealment; the lower scroll, the techniques of flying and hiding the body, the sword, the Maiden’s Return of Essence, and the *Dun Jia* and *Liu Ren* arts.

The immortal maiden said: "You lack the destiny of an immortal, but by diligently practicing these methods, after three years you may become a stubborn immortal of the earthly realm. A lifespan of one thousand two hundred years is called a stubborn immortal. These writings are the celestial secret formulas—only a gentleman with prior karmic ties to the Dao may encounter them."

The method states: To cultivate the art of concealment, one must be benevolent and aid all beings. To practice the sword arts and the ways of the chivalrous immortal, one must be upright, renounce wealth and lust, act with valor, walk alone in righteousness, and always practice compassion. After a year of cultivation, merit will accrue. To practice the Maiden’s Return of Essence, one must treat others with equality, filial piety, and kindness, never deceiving or acting falsely. After a year of practice, the art will be accomplished, granting a lifespan of a thousand years and the attainment of a stubborn immortal.

Zhang Qun cultivated these arts and transmitted them to Guiguzi, who, after less than three years, mastered myriad transformations, becoming peerless. Later generations who practice this method must have a heart aligned with the Dao; only then may they receive these teachings. If one encounters these secret arts and, though of humble talent, learns to conceal the body, one is already half a sword immortal. To fully embody chivalry, one must vow to be loyal and filial, repay kindness and uphold righteousness, never oppressing others. To slay the wicked and return to righteousness, one must first master concealment.

Thereafter, within a chamber, arrange a forest altar, burn incense, and maintain purity. No others may come and go. When rising or resting, first spread a mat before the altar, fast, burn incense, purify with clean water, meditate to dispel impurities, and make offerings to the Six Ding Jade Maidens. Perform the sacrifice on a *ding* day. At night, sit upright on the bed, close the eyes, and visualize: the bed as the altar table, the head facing west. Wear the Six Ding Jade Maiden’s seal, which is the seal of the Nine Heavens Mysterious Woman, overseer of the Jade Maidens.

**Visualization of the Seal**
First, visualize the northeast seal. The *ding-mao* Jade Maiden stands at the seal’s corner, wielding a green serpentine sword. Next, the *ding-si* Jade Maiden stands at the southeast corner, wielding a yellow or white serpentine sword. Then visualize the southwest seal. The *ding-wei* Jade Maiden stands at the seal’s corner, wielding a white or yellow sword. Next, the northwest seal. The *ding-chou* Jade Maiden stands at the seal’s corner, wielding a black or yellow sword. Then, the *ding-you* and *ding-hai* Jade Maidens stand to the left and right, each wielding a green or yellow serpentine sword.

After visualization, softly recite the incantation one hundred and eighty times. Then, the *ding-you* and *ding-hai* Jade Maidens at your side enter your heart directly through the nose—the nose is the human gate. Next, visualize the *ding-mao* Jade Maiden at the northeast corner entering through the left ear to the southeast corner. Then, in order: the *ding-mao*, the *ding-wei* at the southwest, the *ding-chou* at the northwest, and the *ding-you* and *ding-hai*. They stand at your side and upon the seal, entering the heart directly. The left ear is the wind gate. Next, visualize the *ding-si* Jade Maiden at the southeast corner entering the heart through the right ear—the right ear is the ghost gate. Then, the *ding-wei* Jade Maiden at the southwest corner enters the heart through the mouth—the mouth is the earth gate. Finally, the *ding-chou* Jade Maiden at the northwest corner enters the heart through the eyes—the eyes are the celestial gates. Complete each visualization.

When walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, always wear the seal on the left hand and never remove it. For major or minor matters, remove the seal and place it in a clean location; upon returning, wash the hands before reattaching the seal.

If in nightly dreams you ascend mountains, enter water, encounter violent slayings, or see a woman nearby, do not be alarmed or frightened—this is the Jade Maiden descending in bodily form.

**Nine Heavens Mysterious Maiden Seal Formula:**
Use *longjing* jujube wood and place it in a basin of water; if the wood floats and moves of its own accord, it is a true encounter. On the *jiazi* day, burn incense and carve the seal yourself—let no one witness it. Exercise utmost caution.

The seal formula is as follows:

**Ding-mao Jade Maiden Talisman**
The Jade Maiden on the right is named Wenbo, styled Rengao. Her left hand strokes the child’s head; the child is unclothed.

**Ding-chou Jade Maiden Talisman**
The Jade Maiden is named Wengong, styled Rengui. Her right hand has two fingers curled and three extended.

**Ding-hai Jade Maiden Talisman**
The Jade Maiden on the right is named Wentong, styled Renhe. Her left hand has two fingers curled and three extended.

**Ding-wei Jade Maiden Talisman**
The Jade Maiden on the right is named Shutong, styled Renfu. Her left hand holds a mirror, her right hand a lotus.

**Ding-si Jade Maiden Talisman**
The Jade Maiden on the right is named Tingqing, styled Renshu. Her right hand holds a fan in the *dhyāna* mudrā.

**Ding-you Jade Maiden Talisman**
The Jade Maiden on the right is named Wenqing, styled Renxiu. She stands upright with hands folded, riding upon colored clouds.

By cultivating the true method of *shijie* (corpse liberation), one may move through the world unimpeded; otherwise, the Dao cannot yet be abandoned. Additionally, one must practice this method—merely transforming the body into mist, riding upon colored clouds to return to the Great Ultimate.

The *Tai Xi Yin Jing* states: "The inner breath has no name; only through practice does it take form." If one does not uphold the precepts and enters *taixi* (embryonic breathing) prematurely, one will not attain union with the True.

The *Tai Wei Yin Shu* says: "Whenever *taixi* is practiced among people, the *shijie* follows the transformation." On the *gengchen* day, at the *chen* hour, in a cold chamber, burn a censer of incense. Set up a small table by the bed, placing upon it an incense burner, a staff, shoes, and a covering. Arrange these by the bedside, remove the lower garments, and cover the body with the clothing. Face outward toward the west, visualize oneself as a dead person in the yin state, and recite the incantation seven times:

*"Celestial spirits of the mysterious,
Receive the essence of living beings.
Seven thoughts, seven summons—
The three hun follow and welcome.
Take my form,
Let form follow transformation,
And manifest as the change demands.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

After reciting the incantation, sleep as usual and maintain the visualization. After a long while, under no circumstances speak to others, or the method will fail. Diligently practice this method for forty-nine days, and the technique will gradually take form. When needed, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, silently recite this incantation. As soon as you grasp an object, swiftly turn away and depart from others. People will see only the object you carried, believing you have already died. Later, when the object returns to its original form, this hidden method can assist in *shijie* within the mortal realm, allowing one to change form and escape calamity. However, it must not be used for unlawful purposes.

For those who wish to cultivate the body, absolute stillness and secrecy are essential—do not leak the method. If lying on the bed, simply cover the body with a blanket, silently recite the incantation seven times, and rise to leave. Others will see only the clothing on the bed, while your own body remains unseen. If used to deceive others for wealth or lust, the gods will diminish your lifespan, and the Great Dao will not permit it. Remember this a thousandfold—do not transmit it recklessly. Hold it in reverence and secrecy.

**Postscript**

Emperor Huang said: The Six Ding Jade Maidens of the gods can lengthen or shorten, can exist or vanish. With sincere heart, inquire of them, and all matters shall follow your will. They may divine the state of one’s body a thousand *li* away, or the news of ten thousand *li*. If you desire an object, act as you wish, and it shall instantly arrive. This method, when encountered, brings purity and fortune to one’s dwelling, keeps the five poisons and disasters at bay, grants immortality to those who seek immortality, office to those who seek office, and ensures descendants flourish without decline. Even the most subtle matters shall be attained. When you wish to employ them, they descend as rain upon the mortal realm, assuming their appointed duty. Should you desire to know fortune or misfortune, inquire of them, and divine verification shall surely come.

The affairs of the Ding-Chou Jade Maiden of the gods are like the laws of a sovereign—take care never to transmit them orally, nor to revile or insult her with foul speech. Simply make offerings and revere her, and you shall foreknow future events, discern the signs of ten thousand *li*, and grasp the subtleties of written messages. In times of urgent peril or disputes of the tongue, summon and inquire of her, and all shall be known.

Those who study the Dao, if they do not encounter this method, have no means to achieve completion. In ancient times, all enlightened scholars who did not abandon it obtained this text, made offerings to it, and attained immortality. This method is of utmost value—worth ten thousand gold, not to be transmitted even between father and son. It is the wondrous secret of the true arcane text.

*The Secret Method of the Six Ding of the Numinous Treasure* concludes.
