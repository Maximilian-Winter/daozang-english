**The Pole Star’s Six Locks – Aligning Heaven and Earth’s Transformations (Tian Di Bian Yi)**

To comprehend the transformation of Heaven and Earth—when day and night merge indistinct, when mist and darkness swirl with black winds, when yellow sands surge like mountains uprooting trees, when the sun and moon vanish and the stars lose their luster—

Take a three-foot length of white silk, inscribe the *Ertian Fu* (Heaven-Swallowing Talisman), recite the *Hun Tian Zhou* (Chaos-Subduing Incantation), and place it in a desolate, uninhabited mountain peak facing northwest. Stand upright upon the highest summit, holding one hundred folded talismans. Cast one talisman to the ground, point upward with one hand, and shout the syllable *Su* three times. Immediately descend the mountain without looking back.

In but a moment, violent winds will rise from all directions, distorting faces beyond recognition, and only the thunderous sound of drums will be heard—high and low, leveling all things, flattening rivers and seas.

This method, once invoked, must never be repeated, lest it bring ruin to living beings. It is to be used only when calamity is inevitable.

From ancient times, sword immortals have vied to seize celestial palaces, all employing this technique. **It must not be attempted by common mortals.**

**The Chaos-Subduing Incantation (Hun Tian Zhou):**

*"Summon the Celestial Marshal Taiyi, the Thunder Lord, the Wind Master, the Rain Deity, the Thunderbolt, and the Record-Keeping Officials—swiftly command the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Great Strength Heavenly Gods, and the trembling poisonous dragons. Open the sacred gate, strike the mountains to shatter them, strike the seas to dry them up. I act by decree of the Nine-Heaven Supreme Emperor. The Nine-Heaven Ertian Fu is invoked."*

**Moving the Heavens and Changing Constellations (Second Method)**

Should one wish to move or alter constellations—when great stars plummet and lesser stars shift, when the Southern Dipper vanishes and the Northern Dipper hides—first recite the **Threatening-Heaven Great Dao Incantation** a thousand times. Then, within the courtyard at night, when all is still, set out wine, fruit, fragrant lamps, and thirty-three celestial position plaques inscribed with the names of heavenly and human beings.

After offering the rites, the shadows of figures over ten feet tall will appear in their proper places—do not disturb them. Speak softly, saying: *"By decree of the Thirty-Three Heavenly Sovereigns, I command you to remain day and night at my gate, never leaving."* Then, according to each plaque’s name, place them in a crimson silk pouch and carry it with you, unseen by others.

When use is required, take one name from the pouch, pass it over incense, and cast it three times before the star spirits, calling the chosen name seven times. Do not discard the name, lest later use prove difficult. This may only be employed in the midst of two opposing armies.

It aids the nation and stabilizes the family, establishing a land of eternal peace. Only when the people witness the stars shifting will they know their sovereign is virtuous and ministers wise, all hearts united—this is no trifling matter.

**Threatening-Heaven Great Dao Incantation**
*"I invoke the Threatening-Heaven Great Dao—rivers, seas, sun, moon, mountains, and stars all lie within my grasp. I make light shine where I will, darkness where I command.
The Thirty-Three Heavenly Gods submit to my law: east when I bid east, west when I bid west, south when I bid south, north when I bid north.
Obey me, and you shall be ennobled; defy me, and you shall be beheaded by decree.
Swiftly obey the soft command of the Supreme Celestial Sovereign!"*

**Midnight Day-Swapping (Third Method)**

To force midnight into daylight, take two cinnabar blocks, each an inch in diameter, grind them round with *zhēng* water, and bind them with white glue and fragrant incense in a crimson silk pouch. Keep them in a sacred place, offering incense and flowers daily for a hundred days, then carry them with you always.

When use is required, stand alone on a pure altar facing east, holding the cinnabar and reciting the **Fusang Emperor’s Thousand Stanzas** a thousand times. Soon, a lamp’s flame will flare into a perfect radiance, and at midnight, the world will brighten. All living things shall thrive. This may only be used when the Emperor emerges—ordinarily, it must not be employed.

**New Moon and Full Moon Swapping (Fourth Method)**

To alter the phases of the moon, take a clear crystal three inches in diameter, rounding it, and carve a maple-leaf branch resembling a crescent moon upon it, no larger than the crystal itself. Place it in a box of *lei* wood, filling the space with white glue and fragrant incense. Keep it in a sacred place with incense and lamps, ensuring no women approach.

When white light appears within the box, remove the crystal, wrap it in white silk, and carry it with you. When use is required, place it on an incense burner with flowers and pure water, then invoke its power.

This aids the nation.

**Moon and Sun Swapping (Fourth Method)**

When marching an army, use it thus: recite the incantation:
*"The essence of the Sun, I command by the Law-gate—
Let its light illuminate the Four Quarters,
No creature may dare defy my decree.
I obey the edict of the Lord of Solar Progressions,
Binding and suppressing all by imperial command."*

**Suppressing Comets (Fifth Method)**

On the night when a comet is seen buried in the wood of a *mùrén* (wooden effigy),
if one comes to report matters of the *Tiānxīn* (Heavenly Will),
do not be alarmed or fearful.

As they gradually approach, fear not the one who holds the Law.
The wooden effigy’s child shall daily stand beside the Law-holder,
Answering queries from mortals—both celestial and terrestrial—
and coming beforehand to deliver reports.
Do not test this with the unrighteous;
it differs from ordinary methods.
Do not presume to divine it—
the petty shall shun it.

Recite the *Tàiyī Fēixīng* (Grand Unity Flying Star) Incantation:
*"Grand Unity commands its course,
Heavenly Ganges (*Tiāngāng*) by name—
Severing demonic stars,
Those who oppose me shall perish,
Those who betray me shall die,
Those who follow me shall prosper.
I obey the statutes of the Lord of the Northern Pole,
Binding and suppressing all by imperial decree."*

**Turning Winds and Quelling Thunder (Sixth Method)**

Whenever fierce winds abate thunder,
carve a *Huífēng* (Returning Wind) seal from jujube wood and maple wood,
and face the direction of the wind, clouds, thunder, lightning, or hail.
Use the seal to confront them.

Beforehand, bathe the seal in peach and willow broth for a hundred days,
and in white glue and incense for another hundred days.
Keep it hidden from others,
placing it before the sacred shrine,
with incense and flowers in reverence.
If great winds and thunderstorms arise,
concentrate the *qì* and silently recite the *Liùdīng* (Six Ding) Incantation:
*"The Six Ding hasten their descent,
The Six Jia arrive in unison,
Their divine powers widely manifest—
Let them return the wind for me.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Lord’s statutes and commands decree."*

**Returning Wind Seal Pattern**
**Sealing the River and Forest (Seventh Method)**

Zhūgě Gōngquán said: First refine the inner elixir, then practice complete benevolence, righteousness, ritual music, and filial piety. Only then may one employ techniques to cross rivers, traverse dense forests, and conquer seas—all achieved through seated meditation.

One method: On the Double Fifth Festival, rise before dawn and depart. In a secluded place, construct a square altar of grass and reeds, twelve *chi* in length. Place a single mat at its center, along with five portions each of wine, fruit, deer jerky, and snake meat. Facing east, bow in reverence and pray:
*"Disciple [Name] today recites the Golden-Winged Crow King Incantation ten thousand times, beseeching your aid in crossing rivers, vast forests, and lakes and seas."*

Divide the wine and fruit among the offerings, consuming only a small portion oneself. The rest must not be taken. Upon returning home, lie in repose indoors for one day. On the following morning, resume normal activities.

**Golden-Winged Crow King Incantation:**
*"The sun and moon converge their essence;
I invoke the Golden-Winged Crow King of Denglin,
Grant me wings to traverse forests as wind,
To tread upon waters as stone.
I obey the edicts of the Celestial Sovereign and Imperial Lord."*

**Taming Tigers and Wolves (Eighth Method)**
The techniques for subduing tigers, wolves, and beasts are suitable for those refining Dao in seclusion, yet unenlightened to ultimate truth. Alas! The myriad creatures’ malevolent spirits and venomous pests conspire to obstruct the aspirant’s path, preventing them from attaining true understanding—how tragic!

To subdue tigers and wolves, first recite the *Jìnshān* (Mountain-Banning) Incantation ten thousand times. Thereafter, the beasts and vermin will submit as domesticated livestock, allowing one to proceed in peace. When the work is complete, this is the essence of the adept’s craft.

**Mountain-Banning Incantation:**
*"I am the Heavenly Ding, commanding mountain spirits,
Dispelling tigers and wolves across a thousand *li*.
I obey the edicts of the Most High to rescue and subdue."*

**The True Person’s Transformative Nurturing (Ninth Method)**
River-Upper Master, adhering to the resolve of the Grass Hut, attained the principle of transformative nurturing. Zhūgě Gōngquán profoundly understood this principle, enabling him to pierce mountains and enter stone.

Yet today’s Daoists merely speak of inhaling and exhaling to refine the golden essence—how can this be considered the Great Technique? Truly laughable!

To achieve true transformation, piercing mountains, entering stone, traversing emptiness, and nurturing all beings—on the eight seasonal festivals, recite the *Dàlì* (Great Power) Incantation ten thousand times. When needed, focus on the incantation while gazing upon the object to be transformed, which may then be absorbed. Do not employ this lightly.

**Great Power Incantation:**
*"Tīluō fǔtí gǔhuà nǔnǔ yùduōhū,
Dàlì fǔshè yǎngqí nèijū suōpóhē.
Kuíbāng liùsuǒ mìfǎ jìng."*
