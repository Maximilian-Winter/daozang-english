*The Supreme Red Writ of the Cavernous Spirit’s Three Registers*
Compiled by Master Zhenbai of the Liang
Annotated by Li Chunfeng, Grand Astrologer of the Tang

The Recluse Master says: The original text was called *The Red Writ of the Cavernous Spirit’s Formula*, later divided into three versions. This scripture predates Ge and Bao, bearing the names of its transmitters from Hanzhong, who declared: "I now compile the various transmitted versions into one scroll, retaining the original title as it was presented before me, hence its collective designation."

Two characters contain errors, which are preserved here. During my time in the village, a certain Guo, a man of refined interests, showed this to me. The text was written in cinnabar on green-tinted silk—a script style of the Qi and Liang eras—ancient and unadorned, its talismanic seals exquisitely rendered. Though undated and lacking a clear era, it was once transmitted to the late Daoist Zhang Qiao, who attested to its profound efficacy. How could I, for the sake of an old friend, treat this lightly? Thus, I have collated it as it stands before me.

Preface written in the third month of the *renzi* year, the sixth year of the Zhenguan era.

The "Three Registers" section above contains the inner text of the *Zhouyi*. In the "Three Jia" positions, it discusses the inner text of the *Zhouyi*, listing the names of the Eight Polar Sage Ancestors, with the upper character being the "Marvelous Conduct Talisman."

In ancient times, Fu Xi transmitted it to Shen Nong; Shen Nong, having received it, discerned the sowing of the Five Grains and distinguished the properties of the hundred herbs, thereby aiding the livelihood of the people. Later, the Lineage Chart was obtained by Zhuan Xu’s teacher; the Duke of Zhou obtained it and illuminated the Dao of the *Yi*; the Grand Duke obtained it and employed its subtle strategies to assist King Wu in overthrowing Zhou; Confucius obtained it and thereby penetrated its profound mysteries, further exalting the Dao of the *Yi*.

This text, in its ancient form, emerged in accordance with its method. Even if Yao in his chamber did not necessarily know of its transmission, those who received it revered it. Thereafter, Guan Yiwu, Sun Bin, and others passed it down in succession; Fan Li and Zhang Liang did likewise.

It is also said: "Bin is the essence of the white tortoise, his ministerial position endowed with the qi of martial glory." This line originally existed but remains obscure. Yang Shi, Fang Zhong, and Shangguan Bi—all were recorded in the original text, yet their verification in later times remains unseen.

The method states: The divine beings speak of the *Scripture of Great Peace*, which refers to divine beings and perfected persons. Each day, one must recite the incantation without abstaining from any foods, including those of the "zhou" and "qie" categories. After reciting the incantation for forty-nine days, the spirit will naturally come to the "hall palace"—that is, beside the ear. The Dao explains all matters under heaven. Whatever good or ill, fortune or misfortune is reported beside the ear, none is not foretold in advance. Whether in battle, strength or weakness, victory or defeat, survival or demise, or even theft by an unknown perpetrator—all may be known. It reveals the intentions of captured slaves or rebels who come forth, the direction one should take, or how to seek profit, advantage, honor, and glory. In all undertakings, nothing is left unaddressed. Even before knowing whether something will succeed, merely focusing on the spirit will summon it. Matters of great consequence in the world, the fortunes of the state, blessings and omens, rank and emolument, fame and position—events from a thousand years past or yet to come—all are thoroughly understood. Once the incantation has been recited ten thousand times, if one inquires about a matter, the answer is immediately obtained. The two spirits wear Daoist robes and communicate with one’s innermost thoughts. If one smiles and asks, they respond to every question. If there is something one desires, first recite the incantation seven times, and the spirit will come before the hall palace. The person’s intentions are all foreknown. One spirit, clad in green robes, stands by the left ear to report matters; the other, in purple silk, stands by the right ear. The spirits constantly follow the person, responding swiftly to urgent inquiries and answering promptly when urgently summoned, leaving nothing unknown.

**Records of Auspicious and Inauspicious Responses within the Eight Trigrams**
The incantation reads: □□□□□□□□ (command, slay, seize).

These spirits are the essences of the sun and moon, and they are to be employed on the yin and yang days of *zi* and *chou*. One should select the first day of the six *jia* days, write this talisman in cinnabar, burn it to ash, and mix it with pure water. Recite the above incantation two hundred and twenty times, then apply seven drops of the ash-water to each of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. Consume the remainder. Write the talisman again, recite the incantation forty-nine times as before, and carry it on one’s person—then the spirits will manifest their efficacy. When summoning or dispatching them, align the *gang* (cosmic pivot) as instructed. After sixty days, when the cycle returns to the day of *jia-zi*, burn the talisman to ash and apply it again. Write the talisman anew and carry it, repeating the cycle. With sincere focus and unwavering incense offerings, there is no lack of divine efficacy. Burn incense, transmit the talisman, and recite the incantation seven times:

*"May the bean burner and Li Gui,
Require a thousand voids and ten thousand sages,
To join and open the gates of heaven and earth."*

When performing the ritual, recite this incantation seven times. Begin on the first *jia-zi* day, and on that day, receive the talisman. After completing sixty *jia-zi* cycles, offer a feast of venison and lamb’s liver. If venison is unavailable, substitute mutton. After the offering, consume the food yourself. This method must not be lightly disclosed; keep it secret.

**Talisman of Zhen (East)**
Its spirit wears green robes and a green crown, resembling a woman in form. If one has doubts, it will inform them of fortune or misfortune. Before sunrise, take well-flower water, face the direction of Zhen, and consume the talisman five times.

**Talisman of Gen (Northeast)**
Its spirit wears black robes and a black crown. At the hour of *mao*, take well-flower water, face the direction of Gen, and consume the talisman five times. The spirit will speak face-to-face, and this talisman is highly efficacious.

**Talisman of Xun (Southeast)**
Its spirit wears a green crown and resembles a woman in form. Both large and small talismans are consumed while facing Xun, and the spirit will come to report fortune or misfortune. Use well-flower water, consume the talisman five times while facing Xun, and one’s mind will naturally open and awaken.

**Talisman of Li (South)**
Its spirit wears red robes and resembles a woman in form. Cultivate with sincerity, and the spirit will come of its own accord to speak. At the hour of *mao*, face the direction of Li, and consume the talisman five times with well water.

**Talisman of Qian (Northwest)**
Its spirit wears black robes and resembles a man in form. At the hour of *mao*, face the direction of Qian, consume the talisman five times with well-flower water, and the spirit will come.

**Talisman of Kun (Southwest)**
Its spirit wears yellow robes and a yellow crown, resembling an elderly woman in form. At the hour of *mao*, face the direction of Kun, and consume the talisman three times with well-flower water. The spirit will come of its own accord to converse, and its efficacy is profound.

**Talisman of Dui (West)**
Its spirit wears white robes and a white crown, resembling a woman in form. It knows the auspicious and inauspicious days, can pursue fugitives, dispatch thieves, and foretell deaths by drowning, warfare, tigers, or wolves. It sharpens vision and hearing, enabling foreknowledge of names. Use well-flower water, face the direction of Dui, and consume the talisman five times.

**Talisman of Kan (North)**
Its spirit wears black robes. At the hour of *mao*, face north, and swallow the talisman five times with well-flower water. One will then attain spiritual penetration, clarity, and divine efficacy.

For all cultivation, on the forty-ninth day and night, face north, burn incense, light the Seven Star lamps, bow in worship, and recite the above incantation twice. From the fourteenth to the forty-ninth day, one may employ the spirits at will, as in the recitation. Do not write or read these methods aloud. Do not transmit them to the unworthy. When practicing, one must be resolute in heart, pure in intention, and reverent. If one is careless or disrespectful, they will bring misfortune upon their seven generations of ancestors and themselves.

**The Master’s Method of Dream-Wandering through Various Realms to Bewilder the Jade Maiden’s Soul**
**First: Testing the Method**
Have a child sleep, first recite the incantation, and after two days of immobility, invoke the Venerable Immovable Sage to seize control. Fold black paper and place it in the child’s mouth to bite, then cover their head with two pieces of silk. First, take two breaths from the sleeping child, then recite the incantation:

*"Summon the Four Great Divine Generals,
To seize the Jade Maiden and bewilder her soul."*

After reciting, blow into the sleeping child’s mouth, then use both thumbs to press and separate the *Sansi* platforms (temples) of the sleeper. Have the person sleep again, then take the qi of the five directions and blow it onto their body. After the time it takes to drink two bowls of tea, sit upright and recite:

*"Venerable Immovable Sage, seize them and go in search—once seen..."*

Recite again:

*"Summon the Four Great Divine Generals,
To seize the Jade Maiden and bewilder her soul.
I call you—return swiftly!"*

Call the child by their given name, and they will awaken.

**Second: Dispelling Nightmares at Home**
The incantation reads:

*"Om bīlǐ xiāng qù shè."*

**Third: Dispelling Dreams Sent by Others**
The incantation reads:
*"Chīlún chì shā bēi shè."*

**Fourth: Crossing Rivers in Dreams**
The incantation reads:
*"Yún yìng gǎn tōng hù fǎ shè."*

**Fifth: Observing Mountain Landscapes in Dreams**
The incantation reads:
*"Chì wēiwǔ dà jiàng chì shā shè."*

**Sixth: Entering the Yin Realm in Dreams**
The incantation reads:
*"Gōu sì dà shén jiàng gōu fǔ mìng bì qì shè."*

**Seventh: Entering the Yang Realm in Dreams**
The incantation reads:
*"Dié gōu shén jiàng shū shè."*

**Eighth: Inducing Cloud-Wandering Dreams**
The incantation reads:
*"Jiǔ tiān péng biàn dà jiàng hún shè."*

**Ninth: Inducing Familial Dreams**
The incantation reads:
*"Hù shēn zhǔ rén èr shén bù yuǎn shè."*

**Tenth: Enabling Dream Vision of Ghosts and Spirits**
It reads:
*"Gōu shén qiǎn guǐ cēncī shè."*

**Eleventh: Inducing Dreams of Ascending the Nine Heavens**
It reads:
*"Kāi tōng lìshì chuán shén shè."*

**Twelfth: Directing All Dreams at Will**
It reads:
*"Shā shén shòu shòu yù nǚ huán hún mèng shè."*

Write the talisman and recite the incantation in a secluded, cool chamber. Gather your spirit, face north, and sit upright. Visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper hovering above your head, with the Dark Warrior (Xuanwu) manifesting—the tortoise and serpent entering your mouth. Hold your breath as you write, then blow onto the paper. Use a new brush and cinnabar to inscribe it. If giving it to another, write two additional talismans of your choosing on the same sheet and seal it. At night, pass it through incense smoke, burn it over a lamp, and consume the ashes with fragrant water. Sleep alone, and the effect will manifest.

For transmission, perform the ritual on the seventh night: burn incense, light the Seven Star Lamps, and bow in worship. Recite each incantation twice, increasing to forty-nine days (seven sets of seven), after which you may use them at will. If recited backward, the method becomes profoundly secret. In practice, steadfast devotion is essential. Disrespect will render it ineffective.

**The Straightforward Method**
Inscribe the Five Directions Seal in cinnabar, burn it to ash, and mix it into warm water. Recite the Five Directions Incantation and the Heaven-Earth Sages’ Incantation, then wash your head and eyes with the water to straighten your vision.

**The Shadow-Chasing Method**

**The Fire-Breaking Lock Method**
Form the Fire Seal with your left hand and the Wood Seal with your right. First recite the Wood Incantation, then the Fire Incantation. With your right little finger, trace the character for "fire" on the ground, then trace the Fire Seal with your right hand—the lock will open of its own accord.

**The Moonlight Illumination Method**
Place the Five Directions Seal inside a *kaolao* (ritual vessel). At the second watch of the night, carry the *kaolao* ten steps outside, then tilt it while reciting the Five Directions Incantation and the Sages’ Incantations.

**The Spirit-Exiting Method**
On the eight solar terms, inscribe the Five Directions Spirit Seals in cinnabar, burn them to ash with pure incense, and consume them in a purified chamber. Sit upright and recite the Sages’ Incantations, then the Wood Incantation. Form the Wood Seal, and your spirit will exit in all four directions—east, west, north, and south alike.

**The Five Transformations**
**Wood Transformation:** Press the Wood Seal onto your body, recite the Sages’ Incantations, and chant the Wood Incantation above your head. Form the Wood Seal in a forest, and you will merge with the trees—no one will see you. This is called *Wood Transformation*.

**Fire Transformation:** Press the Fire Seal onto your body, recite the Sages’ Incantations and the Fire Incantation, and form the Fire Seal. You will become indistinguishable from fire, unscathed by flames. Lean against grass or wood, and it will burst into smoke and fire. This is called *Fire Transformation*.

**The Corpse Transformation Method**
Hold the Five Directions Seal, burn it to ash, and mix it with fragrant water. Consume it for seven days, reciting the Sages’ Incantations seventy times each morning, along with the Five Directions Spirit Incantations, and forming the Five Directions Spirit Seals. On the seventh day, you will die, yet remain unharmed even after ten years.

**The Five Directions Halo Method**
Burn the Five Directions Seal to ash and consume it. On the second day of each month, before sunrise, recite the Sages’ Incantations and the Five Directions Spirit Incantations, and form the Five Directions Seals. A five-colored halo will emanate from your mouth, allowing you to perceive future events.

**The Paper Animation Method**
Dry the Five Directions Seal with incense powder, then cut paper into various shapes. Recite the Five Directions Spirit Incantations and the Sages’ Incantations, burn the Water Seal to ash, and mix it with one *sheng* of well-drawn water. Recite the Water Incantation, form the Water Seal, and sprinkle the water—all paper shapes will transform as commanded. This is a most potent prohibition.

**The Twelfth-Month Flower-Blooming Method**
Use the Fire Seal of apricot and peach trees and the Water Seal. Draw two *dou* and two *sheng* of freshly drawn water to pour over the trees, recite the Water, Fire, and Earth Incantations, and the trees will bloom in season.

**The Wheat-Growing Method**
Take one *sheng* of wheat and prepare a plot fifty *bu* in length and breadth. Burn the Five Directions Seal to ash, mix it with two *sheng* of well-drawn water, and recite the Sages’ Incantations and the Five Directions Spirit Incantations seven times each. Soak the wheat in the water. Plant it on the eighth day of each month at the *you* hour; by the *xu* hour, the seedlings will sprout. At the *yin* hour, water them with the Five Directions Spirit Seal, and again at the *chen* hour. By the *si* hour, the wheat will ear; by the *wu* hour, it will ripen. Harvest five *sheng* and five *ge* of wheat, recite the Fire Incantation, and consume it. For ten days, you will not crave morning food, and this will prolong your years—this is the method of absolute fasting.

**The Millet-Growing Method**
Take half a *sheng* of millet and prepare a plot fifty-two *bu* in length and breadth. Burn the Wood Seal to ash, mix it with well-drawn water, and pour it over the plot. By the *shen* and *you* hours, the seedlings will sprout; by the *xu* hour, they will ear; and by the *zi* hour, they will be ready for harvest. In a purified chamber, pound the millet into grains, dry them for two days, then cook half a *sheng* into congee and consume it—this will prevent aging.

**The Rain-Summoning Method**
Bury the Five Directions Seal in the earth, recite the Sages’ Incantations and the Water Incantation, and form the Water Seal—rain, mist, or frost will fall. To halt it, form the Fire Seal, recite the Fire Incantation, and it will cease.

**The Wind-Commanding Method**
Bury the Earth Seal in the *xun* direction, recite the Sages’ Incantations and the Earth Incantation, and form the Earth Seal—trees will topple and mountains crumble in the ensuing gale. To halt it, form the Wood Seal, recite the Wood Incantation, and the wind will cease.

**The Flesh-Crest Manifestation Method**
Burn the Five Directions Seal to ash and consume it with fragrant water for five to seven days. Each day, recite the Sages’ Incantations, and a flesh-crest will grow upon your head, your body will resemble lapis lazuli, and the fifty-two marks will transform you into a being of extraordinary form. After two talismans, recite the incantations, first knocking the teeth five times—more is better. Invoke the incantation in times of urgency, and visualize it for aid. If the water is enchanted and given to the sick, wind will not stir, water will not drown, and malevolent spirits will flee.

The True Primordial Heavenly Worthy receives the Jade Emperor’s decree, the Jade Emperor’s command moves, and the Venerable Lord exhorts—may a thousand blessings and a hundred fortunes follow.

**The Talisman-Writing Method with Enchanted Brush**
The Black-Killing Spirit King empowers the brush to subdue all ghosts. Recite the incantation seven times, then spit upon the brush before writing. Write separate talismans for the sick to consume.

**The Self-Consumption of Enchanted Water Method**
Clear and cool, dragon and tiger take form,
Neither hunger nor thirst—
I attain longevity.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and law!*

**The Enchanted Fruit Method for the Sick**
First knock the teeth seven times, then recite:
*"The Perfected Descend and Perfect,
All ailments are repelled."*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and law!*
Recite the incantation five times.

**The Ritual Procedure**
At midnight, the *zi* hour, in a quiet chamber, use two swords to draw a boundary two *zhang* and three *chi* upon the ground, marking the perimeter with mulberry ash. Place forty-nine willow twigs, seven lamps, seven incense burners, two zithers, one bow, two arrows, two sets of brush and inkstone, two new felt mats five *chi* in length, a bowl of white congee, five to seven seasonal fruits, and two bowls of purified water. Arrange all items in their proper positions, then invoke and welcome:
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of True Origin, descending upon the light to take his seat,
The Great Emperor of the North Pole, descending upon the light to take his seat.

Respectfully offered are incense, tea, and sacrificial offerings. The incantation reads:
Heaven attains the One and becomes clear,
Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil,
I attain the One and become numinous.
Heaven covers, Earth bears,
Sun and Moon illuminate me,
The Five Lights assist me,
The Five Stars empower me.
Hasten, hasten, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and law!

**Seal-Forming Methods**
*Heaven Seal*: Press the tips of both middle fingers against the middle joints of the index fingers.

*Water Incantation*: *Namo samanta-buddhānāṃ, mahā-tathāgatāya hūṃ svāhā.*

The seals are to be carved from jujube wood, each two *cun* and two *fen* in size, using the *Dragon’s Startle* method.

*Water Command*: Command the Great Golden Summit, Wheel-King of Self-Mastery of the North!
*Metal Command*: *Oṃ*, command the Great Golden Summit, Wheel-King of Self-Mastery of the West!
*Earth Command*: *Oṃ*, command the Great Golden Summit, Wheel-King of Self-Mastery of the Center!

Should a person of worthy wisdom receive and transmit this,
One of meager virtue shall bring calamity upon nine generations and themselves.

**Rites of Reverence**

The days of veneration are as follows: the first day of the first month, the second day of the eleventh month, the third day of the third month, the fourth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the sixth day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the tenth day of the tenth month, the eleventh day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month.

For those who practice this Dao, a purified chamber must be chosen, where morning and evening incense and offerings are diligently presented. On the aforementioned days of each month, rites of worship and invocation should be performed. With sincere devotion and reverence, the cycle is to be repeated without end. One must not begin with diligence only to grow lax later; steadfast focus is essential. By such practice, there shall be no failure.

The arrangement of the altar and its offerings has been described above.

**The Supreme Mysterious and Wondrous Thousand-Gold Register**
On the following days— the first and seventh days of the first month, the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the fifteenth day of the ninth month, and the eight solar terms— the rites are conducted in the same manner. At each festival, one must first consume the Twelve-Hour Talisman, then inscribe a Congee Talisman, burn it to ash, grind it in an inkstone, and blow the residue before inscribing further talismans.

These twelve talismans are to be burned to nine portions of ash, taken each morning with water.

When receiving the Dao, if the celestial signs align, a clean mat is to be used. If none is available, the ground must be swept clean. Offerings of incense, lamps, tea, and wine— each in sets of three— along with fruits as one desires, are to be prepared. Facing north, the talismans are inscribed as follows:

1. The Unifying Thread Talisman
2. The True Reception Talisman
3. The Celestial Armor Talisman
4. The Terrestrial Armor Talisman
5. The Personal Armor Talisman
6. The Perceptive Eye Talisman

Facing north, incense is burned, and with reverence, the following are invoked:
The Supreme Primordial and Wondrous Dao Perfected Lord,
The Nine Heavens’ Divine Attendant of the Archery Terrace,
The Nine Heavens’ Envoys,
The Azure Dragon of the Left,
The White Tiger of the Right,
The Vermilion Bird of the Front,
The Dark Warrior of the Rear.

May they bestow their aid and grace, granting the petitioner’s wishes as desired.

Having purified oneself through fasting and ablutions, one burns incense, pours libations, stands upright, and bows deeply to invoke:
The True Lord of the Northern Dipper,
The Lady of the Purple Tenuity,
The Lord of the East,
The Queen Mother of the West,
The River Earl,
The Rain Master,
The Twelve Palace Deities,
The Six Jia Generals,
The Directing Talisman Envoys.

May they deem the petitioner worthy to receive the talismans, fulfilling all desires.

Further invocations are made:
The Azure Emperor of the East, riding the Azure Dragon;
The Vermilion Emperor of the South, riding the Vermilion Dragon;
The White Emperor of the West, riding the White Dragon;
The Black Emperor of the North, riding the Black Dragon;
The Yellow Emperor of the Center, riding the Yellow Dragon.

May the Five Emperors of the Five Directions each descend their numinous qi, riding their five dragons to their respective positions, and attend the altar to receive the offerings, granting the petitioner’s wishes.

Incense is offered again, and the following are invoked:
The Azure Emperor of the East and the Azure Dragon,
The Vermilion Emperor of the South and the Vermilion Dragon,
The White Emperor of the West and the White Dragon,
The Black Emperor of the North and the Black Dragon,
The Yellow Emperor of the Center and the Yellow Dragon.

May each descend their numinous qi into the petitioner’s body.
May the upright qi of the Five Celestial Stars enter the petitioner’s body.
May the petitioner’s hun and po be shielded from all malevolent influences, all harm averted, and all spirits and demons be commanded to prosperity.

The River Earl’s Officials,
The Directing Talisman True Officials,
The Enforcers of the Dao,
The Twelve Divine Officials,
The Upper and Lower Five Jia,
The Wind Earl,
The Rain Master—

May they all descend their numinous qi into the petitioner’s body, harmonizing virtue and spirit. In heat, there shall be no heat; in cold, no cold. When hungry, one shall be sated; in peril, one shall find safety. The talismans’ divine efficacy shall be manifest.

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

The prayer is repeated:

With reverence, we address the multitude of spirits: the wine and offerings are humble and meager, unworthy of presentation. We pray for your indulgence and that each of you, with your respective divine retinues, deign to accept them.

Having bowed twice, the petitioner drinks the wine, and the remainder is cast into the east-flowing waters. The *General Register Talisman* and the *Three Jia Talismans* are then swallowed. Thereafter, the *True Receiving Talisman* is placed in a blue pouch and worn within the topknot of the hair.

The *All-Seeing Talisman* is burned to ash, mixed with water, and allowed to settle. The eyes are washed with the clear liquid, enabling one to see and converse with earth spirits and hear the speech of ghosts and gods, ever abiding within the body.

After the rites, the spirits must be sent forth.

**General Register Talisman (First)**
For all talismans, on the day prior to use, write the talisman in cinnabar and swallow its nine segments. The ritual is performed on the seventh day of the first month, the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the fifteenth day of the eighth month, and the ninth day of the ninth month. At night, when the stars are clear, write the talisman, burn incense, and recite the incantation:

*"The Celestial Pivot roams and traverses,
Sun, moon, and stars assemble.
The talisman burns, qi submits,
The Nine Essences transmit the Sovereign’s decree.
All talismans, swiftly, swiftly, swiftly take form,
Guarding and shielding this petitioner’s body,
Ever as treasure and silk."*

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

**True Receiving Talisman**
Write this talisman beneath the Northern Dipper. For all talismans, first recite the incantation, then write the talisman in cinnabar, invoking the name at the year, month, day, and hour. The incantation reads:

*"Lady Xuan Yuan, by nature fond of purity,
Yearns for the wondrous Dao.
She reverently enacts the celestial talismans,
Commanding spirits and subduing ghosts.
Heavenly spirits protect me,
Earthly spirits bear me,
Sun and moon illuminate me,
Celestial spirits guard me,
The River Earl ferries me,
All malevolence submits to me,
