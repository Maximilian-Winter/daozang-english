**Supreme Unity’s High Purity Eight Scenes Returning Chariot Complete Dao/Way of Flying Spirit Secret Method** (太上上清八景回车毕道飞灵秘法)
*On the very day of the Great Heat* (大暑),
*When the Earth Branch* (土旺) *is potent,*
*One may conceal their form, hide their traces,*
*So none shall see them,*
*And transform into another shape.*
*The Six Wu* (六戊) *follow the talisman,*
*Close the array with Wu Chen* (戊辰).
*The incantation—*
*The Heavenly Spirits aid the High Purity Dao/Way,*
*Seal its name.*
*One person may perform it,*
*And all Nine Heavens and Ten Thousand Earths shall obey.*

**Great Heat Six Wu Concealment Talisman** (大暑六戊隐形符)
*The Left True Person* (左真人) *says:*
*This Six Wu Method,*
*When deploying the array and acting,*
*Is equal in power to Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Gate,*
*The Phoenix Star* (蓬星), *Supreme Yang* (太阳), *Supreme Yin* (太阴),
*Marching the Hexagrams* (步罡), *Treading the Stars* (蹑斗),
*According to the Ten Heavenly Stems* (十干) *of day and time,*
*Enter first, invoking the spirit below the heart,*
*To fulfill the plans of the ritual.*
*Identify the directions of Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Gate,*
*Know where the Jade Maiden stands guard.*
*Then, with the left hand holding a blade,*
*At the Ghost Gate* (鬼门) *take soil to build the walls,*
*Next, take the Six Wu talisman,*
*In the four straight directions of the Six Wu array,*
*Mark them with soil,*
*Press the Six Wu Seal between them,*
*And from the central soil rise,*
*So none shall see you,*
*Much less the common folk.*

**Six Wu Divine Talisman** (六戊神符)
*This talisman governs the Six Passes,*
*Press the Six Wu,*
*On yellow silk or yellow paper,*
*With female yellow ochre* (雌黄) *write the Branch and Stem* (支干) *of Wu,*
*And Vermilion write the seals.*

First, on the **Wu-Chen** day, make the offering, and continue through to **Wu-Wu**, thus communicating with spirits.

Always use yellow paper to write the talisman, and offer it with wine.

If there is an ancient city, determine its cardinal directions by the prefectural and county offices, marking the **Six Wu** positions.

Within the prefectural and county offices, take soil from the empty ground above the **monthly taboo** area—one *dou* and two *sheng*—and with wealth paper and wine, make offerings to the Six Gods.

Alternatively, open the **orifice** and bury the talisman, covering it with soil, and burn paper money above it.

If the land is unclean or impure, divide the soil, burn it, and place the talisman and paper upon it, beginning on **Jia-Zi** of the **Wu-Chen** decan.

The rest follows similarly.

If there is no seal, write the talisman below the day’s name in ink, and inscribe the deity’s name.

**Right:** This **Six Wu Seal**, on **Six Wu** days, according to the day’s Branch, carve it on a thriving patch of land, without vermilion, in a square diagram of **2.8 cun**.

On **Six Jia** days, fell a **sandalwood** tree to carve it, and chant:

*"Today’s use, felling wood to carve the seal,
The Heavenly Seal is delivered to the **Effigy**,
Seizing the **killer star**, exhausting all evil spirits.
Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon—
Their power spreads beneath the heavens like an image,
Hiding my traces, concealing my form.
As the **Heavenly Capital’s Jade Well Decree** commands."*

For **Six Wu** encampments, draw with a blade, beginning from the **Wu** of the current decan and moving leftward, encircling the perimeter in one continuous stroke to mark the boundaries. At the center, perform the **Yu Step**, and chant:

*"On the sunny slope of **Tai Mountain**,
In the shadow of **Heng Mountain**,
Thieves and bandits shall not rise,
Tigers and wolves shall not intrude.
The Heavenly Emperor obeys me,
Hiding my form in concealment,
The city walls stand firm as iron,
Like the **Golden Pass** unbreached.
Ten thousand calamities, a hundred evils—
None dare approach.
Swiftly, as the **Decree** commands."*

*«Once the incantation is complete, face the **straight decan Wu** direction on the ground, take one *dou* of soil, and evenly divide it into six piles. Arrange these piles in the **Wu** of the six decans, then recite the incantation and swiftly cut a talisman beneath each pile with a blade. Bury the soil and seal the hole—one *dou* and two *sheng* of earth, evenly measured, without speaking.

If one wishes to test it, take a heifer and place its calf outside the gate. The beast will never dare enter.

Now, solemnly invoke the **Eastern** gods: **Gongcao**, **Tai Chong**, and the **Heavenly Gang** Great Deity; **Qing Di**, the **Jia-Yi** generals. Invoke the **Southern** gods: **Tai Yi**, **Sheng Guang**, **Xiao Ji**, and **Chi Di**, the **Bing-Ding** Fire Deities. Invoke the **Western** gods: **Chuan Song**, **Cong Kui**, **He Kui**, and **Bai Di**, the **Geng-Xin** generals. Invoke the **Northern** gods: **Deng Ming**, **Shen Hou**, **Da Ji**, and **Hei Di**, the **Ren-Gui** generals, to descend and guard this site, protecting my person.

After invoking the four directions’ gods, begin from today’s **decan hour** and proceed with the **divinatory tally method**—in the sequence **Zi-Xu**, **Chou-Hai**, **Yin-Wei**, **Shen-Hai**, **Wu-Chen**, **Yin-Yu**—employing the **six-tally method** until completion.

First, establish the **Heavenly Gate (Tian Men)**, then the **Earthly Portal (Di Hu)**. If the four **central decans (Si Zhong)** fail to form the Earthly Portal, take the first tally of the **lower decan (Xia Shou)** and place it on the **upper decan (Gan Ke)**—the formation will naturally succeed.

Having completed the tally method with a shout, next traverse the **Northern Dipper (Bei Dou)**, subjugating all evils. The original scripture further states: The **God of the Northern Tian Yi**—if a person encounters malevolence with a sincere heart and faith, performs the **Yu Step**, and recites this ritual, then a hundred evils shall not dare harm.

After completing the **Yu Step**, enter the center of the formation. Draw the sword through empty space and inscribe the **Great Concealment (Da Yin)** and **Lesser Concealment (Xiao Yin)** talismans. If the words are forgotten, carve two talismans on yellow paper with vermilion seals and burn them toward the sky.

**Restriction Gate (Xiu Men)**—**Kan** Water, Earthly Escape (Di Dun).
**Opening Gate (Kai Men)**—**Qian** Gold, Heavenly Escape (Tian Dun).
**Life Gate (Sheng Men)**—**Gen** Soil, Thunder Escape (Lei Dun).
**Official Gate (Guan Men)**—**Zhen** Wood, Official Escape (Guan Dun).
**Stopping Gate (Du Men)**—**Xun** Wood, Subjugation Escape (Fu Dun).
**Joy Gate (Jing Men)**—**Li** Fire, Rectification Escape (Zheng Dun).
**Death Gate (Si Men)**—**Kun** Soil, Reflection Escape (Jing Dun).
**Risk Gate (Jing Men)**—**Dui** Gold, Hazard Escape (Xian Dun).

The original scripture states: Within a **six-foot courtyard** or **six-step wild formation**, or even **sixty steps**, these are the measures. Then, with the left hand holding the **six tallies**, each one a foot and two *cun* long, and the right hand holding the blade, inhale the **vigorous qi**, strike the teeth twelve times, and pray from the heart below, “For the sake of [certain matter].”

Then, return and face the **vigorous decan gods**, the four **vigorous decans**—**Spring Mao**, **Summer Wu**, **Autumn You**, **Winter Zi**—and solemnly invoke: “In the year [X], month [X], day [X], hour [X], I respectfully inform **Heavenly Father** and **Earthly Mother**, the **Six Jia** and **Six Decans**, the **Twelve Earthly Branches**, the **Qing Long** and **Peng Star**, the **Ming Tang** and **Tai Yin**, the **Heavenly Gate** and **Earthly Portal**, the **Jade Maiden** and **Hua Gai**, to conceal my body and hide my form. I depart without regard for auspicious days, and return without regard for auspicious times.

Now, to travel for [certain matter], relying on the Great Deities. I solemnly consult the **celestial omens**, invoke the **Jade Maiden**, draw the earthly measures, exit through the **Heavenly Gate**, enter the **Earthly Portal**, close the **Golden Pass**, and ride upon the **Jade Maiden**.

I invoke the **Jade Maiden**, **Qing Long**, **Bai Hu**, **Zhu Que**, **Xuan Wu**, **Gou Chen**, and **Sheng She**—the **Six Harmonious Talismans**—and recite the incantation:

“Six Jia, Six Gods, Twelve Earthly Branches,
Riding with me to reach [certain place].
Guard on my left and right,
Cease when I stop, rise when I act.
Ward off thieves and bandits,
Dispel ghosts and spirits.
The virtuous see me and rejoice beyond measure;
The petty see me and tremble in fear.”»

Now, when men and women see me, they shall set forth wine and offerings.
Those who plot against me shall die, those who oppose me shall perish.

Today, I perform the **Yǔbù** [步], ascending to the **Heavenly Ganges** [罡].
The **Jade Maiden** attends at my side,
while below, I repel all inauspiciousness.
Ten thousand spirits submit in dread,
and all evils are crushed beneath my tread.

Where I heal, peace is restored;
where I attack, victory is won;
where I strike, defeat is assured;
where I seek, fulfillment is granted;
where I wish, success is achieved.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law commands.*

Noble **Chángwáng** [常王], great officials, and magistrates who see me
shall love me as their own child,
and all the people shall honor me as their parents.

Today, I solemnly invoke the **Jade Maiden** and her Great Deity,
who shall guide me forward,
and those who summon me shall be restored to their ranks,
while the **Precious Banner** [宝旗] is dismissed.

Having summoned and petitioned the spirits, I proceed with the **Yǔbù** method.
Three steps, nine tracks,
a **Dingzi** [丁字] step of nine paces,
each pace seven *chǐ* [尺], three times seven—twenty-one *chǐ*.

With my right hand, I hold the **Six Calculus Talismans** [六算子],
grasp a sword from the **Gèn Soil** [艮土],
trace the earth in sequence,
and when complete, reverse and sheath the sword in **Gèn Soil** to command the ghosts and spirits—
all malevolence shall be subdued.

Having entered the formation, next I tread the **Big Dipper** [北斗],
summoning the **Nine Stars** [九星] and their **Gāng Steps** [步罡].
With each step, I recite aloud:

*"The Dipper’s splendor is wondrous,
Riding the twelve *shíchén* [时辰] upon its luminous light.
Its awe and might are manifest,
Like floating clouds shifting seven times—
ascending to the Heavenly Hosts who know all transformations,
entering the Dipper’s lodges with fortune or calamity.

Passing the Heavenly Gate, harmonizing the Six *Lǜ* [律],
commanding arms and treading the Heavenly Ganges [天英].
Crossing the Heavenly Task [天任] into the Clear and Cold Abyss [清泠渊],
one may sink or stand firm upon the Heavenly Pillar [天柱].

Embracing the Heavenly Heart [天心] from this crossing,
stepping upon the Heavenly Game [天禽] and leaning on the Heavenly Auxiliary [天辅].
Gazing toward the Heavenly Surge [天冲] into the Heavenly Interior [天内],
exiting through the Heavenly Cover [天蓬]—the Dipper’s path is clear.

The Heavenly Gentle [天柔] dispels ten thousand evils,
and all ghosts, abandoned, bring forth blessings and longevity.
Preserved for future generations, entering the dim and boundless [杳冥],
for ten thousand years.*

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law commands.*

On **Yang days** [阳日] of the **Six Heavenly Stems** [甲丙戊庚壬]:
First, establish the **Heavenly Ganges** [天英] and **Heavenly Interior** [天内].
Left foot, eight paces for **Heavenly Pillar** [天柱],
left foot, three paces for **Heavenly Pillar** [天柱]—
**Heavenly Heart** [天心], both feet rotating, left foot steps four.

**Heavenly Ganges** [天英], left foot rises one pace;
**Heavenly Game** [天禽], left foot, five paces.

**Heavenly Cover** [天蓬], right foot steps—**Heavenly Cover** [天蓬] emerges.
**Heavenly Auxiliary** [天辅], left foot, six paces (left foot lifted).
**Heavenly Surge** [天冲], left foot, seven paces.
**Heavenly Task** [天任], left foot, two paces.

On **Yin days** [阴日] of the **Six Heavenly Stems** [乙丁己辛癸]:
First, establish **Heavenly Cover** [天蓬] and **Heavenly Interior** [天内].
Right foot, two paces for **Heavenly Pillar** [天柱],
left foot, seven paces for **Heavenly Pillar** [天柱]—
**Heavenly Heart** [天心], right foot, six paces.

**Heavenly Ganges** [天英], left foot, nine paces;
**Heavenly Game** [天禽], left foot, five paces.
**Heavenly Cover** [天蓬], left foot, one pace.
**Heavenly Auxiliary** [天辅], left foot, four paces.
**Heavenly Surge** [天冲], left foot, three paces;
**Heavenly Task** [天任], right foot, eight paces.

The incantation reads:

*"Six *Lǜ* [律] and Nine *Cháng* [章],
Heaven’s round and Earth’s square,
Four seasons and Five *Xíng* [行],
Sun and Moon as radiance.

The **Yǔbù** [禹步] governs the Dao,
**Chīyóu** [蚩尤] repels the armies.
**Qīnglóng** [青龙] seizes the axle,
**Bái Hǔ** [白虎] supports the decline.
**Yínghuò** [荧惑] leads the way,
repelling all inauspiciousness,
while the **Big Dipper** [北斗] slays evil,
and extinguishes all calamitous omens.

The Five Spirits [五神] guard and attend me,
circling the four quarters.
**Dù** [杜] on my left, **Jì** [稷] on my right,
bind them as my bells and chains.

Thousand mouths, ten thousand tongues,
malevolent men and malevolent ghosts,
tigers, wolves, thieves, and bandits—
all sealed and subdued in filth.*

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law commands.*

Having finished the incantation,
I turn left and enter the **Earthly Portal** [地户],
exit through the **Heavenly Gate** [天门],
and depart in the direction of the **Jade Maiden**.

The incantation reads:

*"Jade Maiden, Jade Maiden,
protect me, preserve me.
Jade Maiden, Jade Maiden,
guard me, attend me—
let no hundred ghosts harm me.
Traveling to [certain place],
neither man nor ghost shall recognize me.

Mysterious and shadowy,
no one sees my form.
Men who see me take me for a bundle of firewood,
and hear no sound from me.
Ghosts see no trace of my **qi** [精].

Those who favor me shall prosper,
those who harm me shall suffer.
A hundred malevolent ghosts and bandits—
those who face me shall die,
those who encounter me shall perish.

Among a thousand people, ten thousand,
those who see me shall rejoice.
I open my own gate alone,
and block the Earthly Portal [地户].
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law commands."*

Close the door and shut your eyes,
then take your dagger in hand and draw—
three leftward revolutions—before departing.
**Never look back** as you go straight ahead.

The Jade Maiden’s closure follows.

**Days for entry:**
Child, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake,
Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.

The **Yellow Emperor’s** *Great Unity* **Eight Gates** entry formula—
**Secret Key** complete.
