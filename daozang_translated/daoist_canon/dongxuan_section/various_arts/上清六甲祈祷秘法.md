**The Esoteric Method of Supreme Purity’s Six Jia Prayer Rites**

In former times, the Great Emperor of Eastern Florescence ascended to present himself before the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. The Most High Dao Lord, the Venerable Lord Lao, and the Jade Emperor, the Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity, all gathered in assembly at the Celestial Palace of the *Bingyin* Constellation’s *Wei* Mansion.

At that time, the Emperor Lord of Eastern Florescence rose before the assembled sages and said: "Your subject possesses three scrolls of the *Celestial Writ of the Six Jia*, and wishes to disseminate them throughout the world of *Jambudvīpa*, that they may be received, upheld, and practiced. I observe that in the future kalpa, blades and weapons will bring calamitous disorder, the black-haired people will lose their livelihoods, fathers and sons will be sundered, and none will be able to save the other. I now transmit these to the perfected adepts, that they may receive, uphold, and practice them, aiding the state in quelling chaos. They shall command the Six Jia and Six Ding, the Celestial Wandering Twelve Stream Women, and the *Nayān* Five Heavenly Women, forming a single corpus. These deities of yin and yang possess vast numinous power, with three great generals under their command, each overseeing a million ghostly soldiers.

I now divide them into three scrolls to present here. Let them be transmitted according to the method."

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning examined the presented texts and entrusted them to the Venerable Lord of Mysterious Origin for circulation in the world. Later, Lord Lao transmitted them to Master Yin Xi, who passed them on to the mortal realm. Lord Lao then returned to the Grand Pure Palace. From that time forth, the world received the *Celestial Writ of the Six Jia*.

From antiquity to the present, those who copied these texts often omitted the names of the Six Ding and Six Jia, as well as the appellations of the Celestial Wandering Twelve Stream Women, the *Nayān* Heavenly Women, and the Three Great Generals of the Three Primes. Thus, their use lacked efficacy. Should one obtain this scripture, one must receive transmission from one’s master at the high altar before it may be practiced.

It aids the state in quelling chaos, rescues the perilous, and relieves the people’s suffering. The nine generations of ancestors ascend as immortals.

This scripture enables the summoning of the deities of the Six Jia and Six Ding, the Celestial Wandering Twelve Stream Women, and the *Nayān* Heavenly Women. It commands the Three Great Generals of ghostly soldiers and a million spirits. It can summon wind, clouds, thunder, and rain; shatter enemy encampments; animate wooden oxen and wooden horses; cause painted figures on walls to walk; make a hundred grasses bloom in midwinter; compel subterranean spirits and unearth buried treasures; allow the practitioner to traverse a thousand or ten thousand *li* in flight; repel water, fire, blades, and weapons; withstand a million-strong army; ensure flawless archery; seize the spirits of stars and the moon to make them appear; and invoke the Five Directional Emperor Lords, the Three Officials, and the Five Planets to descend to the mortal realm. Whatever one desires shall be attained as wished.

**The Heavenly Writ of the Sixty Jiazi**

When mortals practice the celestial arts of the Six Jia, they must summon the five Nayuan Heavenly Maidens, whose names are recorded in the Six Jia Writ by the Eastern Florescence Great Thearch. These five maidens possess vast divine powers, aiding in the governance of chaos and the salvation of the common folk. Those who master the great Dao may summon all the stars of heaven to descend.

**Sacred Names of the Five Nayuan Heavenly Maidens:**

First Heavenly Maiden: style name Qizhi, personal name Rende.
Second Heavenly Maiden: style name Jianzhi, personal name Renya.
Third Heavenly Maiden: style name Gangzhi, personal name Renxi.
Fourth Heavenly Maiden: style name Zhenzhi, personal name Renxian.
Fifth Heavenly Maiden: style name Shizhi, personal name Renliang.

**Attire of the Heavenly Maidens:**

The First Heavenly Maiden: wears her hair in two buns, her beauty surpassing the mortal realm. She stands five feet and three inches tall, clad in red robes with a celestial skirt, holding a written text as she descends.
The Second Heavenly Maiden: wears her hair in two buns, standing five feet and two inches tall, dressed in blue robes with a celestial skirt, holding a written text as she descends.
The Third Heavenly Maiden: her beauty surpasses the mortal realm. She wears a Seven Stars crown, stands five feet and three inches tall, clad in white embroidered robes with a celestial skirt, holding a written text as she descends.
The Fourth Heavenly Maiden: graceful in appearance, her hair in two buns, standing five feet and two inches tall, dressed in a green cloud-crane robe, holding celestial herbs as she descends.
The Fifth Heavenly Maiden: dignified in appearance, wearing a heavenly crown, standing five feet and five inches tall, clad in pale yellow robes, holding celestial flowers as she descends.

These five Heavenly Maidens are to be worshipped on the day of Jiazi, descending alongside the Twelve Stream Maidens. During the ritual, recite the incantation of the Stream Maidens to swiftly summon them for an audience. Whatever is sought shall be granted as desired. After a time, they depart upon the clouds.

Should one wish to summon them again thereafter, the Jiazi day is no longer required. Simply present the Six Jia Talismanic Seal and recite the Six Jia Divine Incantation, calling their names twice in succession—immediately they shall appear. Sometimes one or two descend, accompanied by a Golden Youth bearing true ambrosial sustenance for the ritual practitioner to partake.

**Incantation of the Stream Maidens:**
*Kuigang, kuigang, I serve the Nine Qi Lord,*
*Descend with the Six Jia Celestial Script.*
*I hold the Six Jia Talismanic Seal,*
*Summoning Nayan Heavenly Maiden,*
*And the Twelve Wandering Stream Maidens of Heaven.*
*Hasten to the altar before me, befriend me as kin.*
*At the call, instantly arrive,*
*Riding clouds to descend and aid my ritual power.*
*Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command.*

**Ritual for Offering to the Heavenly Maidens and Twelve Stream Maidens:**
Prepare four new mats, four ritual sashes, five incense offerings with flowers and vegetables, pure wine and dried meats, fine tea, sugar cakes, oil cakes, venison jerky, delicate foods, white rice, two *sheng* of jujubes, and wood ear mushrooms—seventy-two portions in total. Light twenty lamps and set out two mirrors, each two *chi* and three *cun* in diameter.

On the Jiazi day at the hour of Mao, enter the chamber and burn incense. Hold the Six Jia Talismanic Seal and recite the Six Jia Divine Incantation five times, then place the seal upon the incense table. At the hour of Wu, burn incense again, and by the hour of Hai, call the names of the Stream Maidens and Nayan Heavenly Maiden. Take the Six Jia Talismanic Seal and impress five seals upon paper, burn them to ash, and mix with water to wash the right eye. Holding the seal, face the direction of the day and stand before the incense table. When an extraordinary fragrance fills the chamber, open your eyes to see the Twelve Stream Maidens and Nayan Heavenly Maiden seated in their proper places. Bow in reverence, utter five soft salutations, and sprinkle purified water while offering incense. If the Stream Maidens say, *"Be seated, so-and-so,"* then sit without hesitation and state your request. The efficacy of this Six Jia Heavenly Maiden Seal and Document is most profound.

**Heavenly Maiden Seal:**
This is the Six Jia Seal. Carve it from the heartwood of a jujube tree struck by lightning, one *chi* square or round. On a San Yuan day or the fifth day of the fifth month, in a purified chamber, burn incense and inscribe it while reciting the Stream Maiden Incantation five times, calling the names of the Han Maiden and Heavenly Maiden. Upon completion of the prayer, finish carving before noon and place it upon the incense table before the divine maidens. After the offering, store it in a box made of *zhi* wood, wrapped in a silk brocade bag, and keep it within the box, offering it before the divine maidens on the same day. When needed, take it out for use. The spiritual power of this seal is beyond comprehension, capable of accomplishing all things.

**Days for Summoning the Five Thearchs with the Seal:**
For spring, use the Shang Yuan day; for summer, the Eight Festivals day; for autumn, the Zhong Yuan day; for winter, the Xia Yuan day. Choose a secluded place, or prepare a spacious courtyard outside the main gate of one’s home, sweeping it clean according to ritual protocol, ensuring it is pure and free of filth. Chickens, dogs, and women must be kept far away; livestock such as donkeys and horses may disturb with their noise. Arrange the space expansively: set up tents and furnishings, lay twenty bamboo mats upon the ground, and atop them place twenty new mats. Use four long tables or stands, and prepare twenty-three wooden spirit tablets. Arrange fifty fruits and ten candles in two rows, with high stands for illumination and various flowers placed in vases. Offer fifteen cups each of fine tea and jujube broth, twenty-five portions of vegetarian food, five hand towels, two towel racks, and two large basins filled with water placed on either side. Set up a separate table covered with a brocade cloth, upon which place the Six Jia Talismanic Seal and Heavenly Maiden Seal face-up. Set out two cups of cold water and display the green memorial on the table. Prepare twelve sheets of dark blue paper and eight sheets of memorial paper to make spirit tablets for the Five Thearchs, the Three Officials, and the Five Stars. With a new brush and cinnabar ink, inscribe the names of the Five Thearchs, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, and the Five Star Lords, then affix them to the tablets in proper order:

**Five Thearchs:**
- **Eastern Green Thearch, Nine Qi Heavenly Lord:** Surname Chan, given name Liu, style Shougong.
- **Southern Red Thearch, Three Qi Heavenly Lord:** Surname Wen, given name Zhong, style Soumao.
- **Western White Thearch, Seven Qi Heavenly Lord:** Surname Peng, given name Ye, style Zhaozhi.
- **Northern Black Thearch, Five Qi Heavenly Lord:** Surname Ge, given name Xian, style Yonglang.
- **Central Yellow Thearch, Twelve Qi Heavenly Lord:** Surname Dai, given name Chu, style Yuandu.

**Three Officials:**
- **Shang Yuan Nine Qi Bestowing Blessings Heavenly Official.**
- **Zhong Yuan Seven Qi Pardoning Sins Earthly Official.**
- **Xia Yuan Five Qi Resolving Calamities Water Official.**

**Five Star Lords:**
- **Eastern Wood Virtue Year Star Lord.**
- **Southern Fire Virtue Sparkling Deluder Star Lord.**
- **Western Metal Virtue Great White Star Lord.**
- **Northern Water Virtue Chronographic Star Lord.**
- **Central Earth Virtue Quelling Star Lord.**

For this ritual, use a two-*jin* piece of agarwood in a fine censer or silver basin, burning it gradually. Once all is arranged, draw a star altar. At the first watch of the second night watch, light forty-nine lamps, igniting them from the first watch to the second point. The ritual practitioner enters the chamber, closes the door, and remains inside, sitting in a dim corner without speaking. Close your eyes, beat the celestial drum, and click your teeth fifty-two times, swallowing saliva repeatedly. At the first point of the second watch, if there is light in the darkness or moonlight accompanied by an extraordinary fragrance entering the chamber, remain silent and do not wear shoes, lest the sound disturb the spirits. Move lightly to the window and peer outside: you will see the Five Thearchs seated upon dragon thrones, the Three Officials seated next in order, while the Five Stars do not sit but move about. You may glimpse hundreds of celestial maidens and jade emperors, their appearances indistinct, each bearing their proper implements.

Do not speak. You will see the ushering attendants kneel, holding the blue memorial in both hands to present it before the Five Thearchs. At the fourth point of the second watch, they suddenly depart, and outside the door all is silent, with no one remaining. Do not allow others to go out; the ritual practitioner alone may exit. First, observe the altar where the seal is placed: five rays of rosy light rise straight to the heavens, and five grains of elixir appear. The practitioner bows in reverence to the five directions, then takes and consumes the elixir. Collect the cold water in the basin—do not spill it—and store it, covering it securely.

Next, gather the offerings of food, fruit, and tea; these must not be eaten by others. If not consumed, pour them into flowing water. Then collect the items left upon the ground: gold, treasures, and rare jades, including objects unknown in the human world. Search thoroughly for anything that may have been missed. After the fourth watch, scour every direction, gathering the remaining treasures and goods. Distribute them to aid the poor and needy, ensuring they are not used improperly or without propriety. Divide them into three portions: one for your own sustenance in the Dao, one for offering rituals to thank the deities, and one for almsgiving to the poor. By widely accumulating merit and virtuous deeds among people, these objects may thus be properly dispensed.

The two basins of pure water are infused with the true *qi* of the sages, imbued with spiritual efficacy for bathing oneself. Once bathed, the body becomes light. After consuming the elixir, you may become an earthbound immortal, able to command the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits, skillfully employ the Twelve Stream Maidens and Nāyāna Heavenly Maidens, and dispatch the Three Great Generals. If this water is not used for bathing, store it in a cool place—do not discard it. After a hundred days, it will transform into a miraculous sweet dew, capable of curing all illnesses.

If an elderly person’s hair has turned white, their teeth fallen out, their hearing faded, their eyes dimmed, or their body emaciated, washing the head with this water will restore black hair. For lost teeth, rinsing the mouth with it will regrow fine teeth, and wrinkles will smooth away. For the deaf, dripping the water into the ears will restore hearing at once. Those suffering from eye ailments will, upon washing their eyes, immediately regain their sight and see clearly again. For any illness without a cure, drinking two mouthfuls of this water will bring instant recovery. For wounds from blades or arrows, washing them with this water will leave no scars. For those with tattoos, first rub the inked area with cloth, then wash it with this water, and the marks will vanish without a trace.

If a person has just died, pouring half a cup of this water down their throat will revive them at once. For a pregnant woman, drinking half a cup will ensure that if the child is a boy, he will be intelligent and wise; if a girl, she will be graceful and beautiful. For those with cold damage who cannot sweat, drinking one or two mouthfuls of this water will induce sweating and bring recovery. If a malevolent spirit possesses someone and exorcists cannot expel it, have the afflicted person drink a mouthful of the water, and let the ritual practitioner take two mouthfuls, exhale upon it, and the spirit will reveal its name and demand to leave. Then offer it clear broth and cold rice, and the spirit will depart. For malignant sores, washing them with this water will bring immediate healing. For those poisoned, drinking this water will instantly neutralize the toxin.

This is the *Sweet Dew of Returned Souls* from the host of celestial sages. When the ritual practitioner heals all manner of illnesses, they must not accept even a single coin or item from the patient; however, food and drink are permissible. Accepting payment will nullify the merit. If one adheres to these precepts, ascension to celestial immortality is assured.

To summon the Five Thearchs, the Three Officials, and the Five Stars—whether to seek the ascent of the seven generations of ancestors to heaven or to obtain elixirs for consumption—this altar may be used twice in three years for such invocations. Do not perform these summons frequently.
