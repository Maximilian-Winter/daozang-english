**Preface to the *Mysterious Canopy Mountain’s Numinous Casket of Secret Registers***

Profound indeed is this book, its origins ancient and obscure. The Master of Xiane first obtained it from a cavern in the cliffs of Mount Tai, later transmitting it to several disciples. Those who received this text either aided the state, withdrew to the wilderness, transcended the realm of things, or wrought illusions in the mundane world. Now concealed, now disseminated; now hidden, now revealed—sometimes passed down through generations, sometimes encountered by chance; now divinely bestowed, now transmitted by a master—its emergence and concealment remain unfathomable. To obtain it is a matter of celestial affinity; once obtained, it cannot but be practiced, and once practiced, it cannot but respond—like echo answering sound, like shadow following form. Yet its rarity spans ages, its origins unknown, leaving one to wonder: is it not the work of non-human hands?

Zhang Zifang received it from the Master of Xiane; Li Guangli from Zifang; Fei Zhangfang from the Master of the Gourd; Wang Guangbo from the shrine of the King of Chu; Liu Huangong from Guangbo; Zhang Gongchao from Huangong; Wang Zijin from the woodcutter of Mount Hua; Zhuge Kongming from the Master of Nanyang; the Daoist of Mount Mao from the Elder Lu of Tiger-Taming Cliff; Zhang Jing from Mount Zhang; and Lin Ziyao from the belly of a temple spirit. Those who obtained this book seldom transmitted it to others—with age, they concealed it; with success, they vanished without trace. Only Zhang Jing bequeathed it to his descendants, passing it down through generations. Yet as its secrets leaked, falsehoods supplanted truth, deceptions corrupted authenticity, and ten spurious schools arose, peddling their wares to an unknowing world. What the world now possesses is but a hollow adherence to form, devoid of efficacy. Rare indeed are those who grasp its talismanic incantations and wield them with verification.

Only the lineage of the Zhang family, transmitting it in unbroken succession, has maintained its lofty eminence, stirring the notice of heaven. The imperial court enfeoffed Mount Zhang as Longhu Mountain, establishing a palace and bestowing titles, with edicts and honors conferred across generations. Through the ages, they have borne the title of Celestial Master, their stipends unbroken, their renown resounding in all directions—is this not extraordinary?

Alas! Mysterious Canopy Mountain is the progenitor of all under heaven. It bears four names: first, Mysterious Canopy; second, Accumulated Stones; third, Kunlun; fourth, Western Mountain. Located in the far west of the cosmos, it gives rise to the sources of the Western River and the Yellow River, traversing the veins of all mountains and peaks, channeling the flow of all rivers and springs. It is the transformation of *Qian*, the root of *Kun*; the treasury of wind and clouds, the palace of water and fire, the dwelling of ghosts and spirits, the gathering place of essences and numina. Its form is majestic: piercing the azure heavens, dominating a quadrant of the earth, its jagged peaks and towering cliffs crowned with clouds, its base girdled by surging springs, stretching into the boundless and obscure—its limits unknown.

At its heart lies a hidden vale, a mysterious cavern where ghosts, spirits, and numinous essences congregate. There rules the divine sovereign Xu Tuo, attended by twenty-four generals who divide their governance across the twelve provinces, controlling the resonance of fortune and misfortune throughout the world. The so-called *Numinous Casket of Secret Registers* embodies the arcane and wondrous efficacy of Mysterious Canopy Mountain’s spirits.

*Numinous* encompasses the void, distilling the essential marvels of the formless, yet manifesting in response to dharma—this is the work of spirits. Subtle and elusive, it responds to phenomena, rooted in the formless yet operating through the existent—how wondrous! Moreover, the spirits within the human body are of the same nature as those of heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers. The spirits of human *qi* and blood: where *qi* and blood exist, there is spirit-light; where they cease, it vanishes. Its coming is unseen, its going unperceived; born from existence, it perishes in existence; emerging from non-being, it dissolves into non-being. In daily movement and stillness, the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, tongue, and body act as one. When the body is disturbed, the spirit moves within; when the spirit stirs, *qi* is emitted; when *qi* is emitted, form is activated. From non-being it is aroused, responding in being—thus the operation of dharma and arts becomes luminously apparent.

Hence, in reciting incantations and inscribing talismans, in exhaling through the mouth and concentrating the mind, in closing the eyes and tapping the teeth, in gesturing with hands and pacing with feet—all these are acts of form, stirring the void. The void responds, and transformations ensue. This is akin to the spirit within being moved by contact with form, while form is directed by the spirit without—thus they unite.

*Casket* () is the vessel that conceals the book. The character combines *jiang* (river) and *jin* (metal), evoking the image of a container for treasures. It signifies the most refined of objects. This book, likened to the most refined essence, is sealed within a vast receptacle, its secrets unspilled—hence the term *casket*. Such a character does not exist in the world; it is the divine language of an extraordinary age.

*Secret Registers* signifies that this book was transmitted by spirits in a single lineage, never disseminated throughout the world. Thus, the general catalogue names it the *Numinous Casket of Secret Registers*.

From ancient times to the present, those who have obtained this book have only marveled at its numinosity and been astonished by its wondrous responses, yet none have truly penetrated its mysteries.

The book comprises three fascicles, containing twenty-four methods:

**Upper Fascicle (Eight Methods):**
To model heaven and earth, to move thunder and lightning, to alter the celestial patterns, to dispel yin haze, to dam rivers, to freeze flowing waters and extinguish raging fires, to command snow and *qi*.

**Middle Fascicle (Eight Methods):**
To secure victory in battle, to conceal troops, to burst forth springs, to shoot fire-arrows, to summon yin clouds, to transform men and horses, to contract the earth’s veins, to traverse rivers and streams.

**Lower Fascicle (Eight Methods):**
To radiate brilliance, to conceal form and substance, to transmute objects and goods, to attach souls in dreams, to dispel venom, to subdue dragons and jade, to annihilate demonic spirits, to cure malevolent hauntings.

Its principles are exceedingly simple, its responses exceedingly swift. Those who obtain it may perfect themselves, serve a single lord, or bring peace to the people of the world.

The superior scholar who obtains it ascends as an immortal and transcends the world; the middling scholar who obtains it aids and sustains the state; the inferior scholar who obtains it deceives and deludes the foolish masses.

Those who ascend as immortals and transcend the world include Master Xia Pi, Master Hu Zhong, Fei Zhangfang, Zhang Gongchao, Wang Zijin, Master of Nanyang, Master of Changlu, Zhang Jing, and Lin Ziyao. Those who aid and sustain the state include Li Guangli, Wang Guangbo, Duke Liu Huan, and Zhuge Kongming. Those who deceive and delude the foolish masses include the Daoists of Mount Mao and the descendants of Zhang Jing.

In former days, when I was governor of Xunyang, I retired to Chang’an, yet did not hasten to the celestial court. Instead, I drank freely with old friends, while my aged wife and children abandoned me without a glance. I drank without cease, intoxicated beyond measure, carefree and unrestrained in my contentment. One morning, as I sat by the shallows of the Wei River, I saw a man stride across the water’s surface toward me. Astonished, I shouted at him, but he stepped ashore, bowed respectfully before me, and I, lowering my head, returned his greeting. After the bow, we sat facing each other on the ground. Gazing intently, I recognized him as Lin. Startled, I asked, “What arts do you practice here?”

He replied, “I have long mastered these skills. Seeing your carefree and untroubled spirit, I came especially for you—do not doubt me. Tomorrow at dawn, meet me at Tianhui Terrace.”

With these words, he stepped lightly onto the water’s surface and departed. Though I suspected it a dream, that evening I went beyond the walls of Weicheng, drunk and lying on Tianhui Terrace to await the morning. That night, I dreamed of drinking heavily with Lin, wandering together in the Jishi Mountains. As I was about to return, I awoke suddenly and sat up on the terrace as the first light of dawn broke.

Presently, Lin arrived carrying a large gourd. He welcomed me warmly onto the terrace, poured wine freely, and we drank without restraint. We spoke of ancient and modern transformations, laughing heartily. Then he produced a scroll and showed it to me, saying, “In the coming chaos of the world, I fear you may suffer calamity. Carry this book and wield its arts. Roam the wild and remote places, and do not linger here.”

I bowed and received it. After more drinking, he rode the clouds and *qi* into the sky and vanished. A year later, I bid farewell to my family and left Chang’an, mastering the art of riding clouds to wander among the famous mountains of the world. Three years later, I arrived at this mountain and swore an oath before the rock cliff. There I saw Lin drinking in his round hut and stayed with him.

I have dwelt on this mountain for ten years now. Those who visit me morning and evening are all men of renown I once knew. Daily, I practice the arts with the Flying Visitor and Master Chongrong—farming and fishing—where daily needs are never met, yet yearly provisions always suffice. I live idly, following the course of heaven.

Reflecting on my past actions, it now seems as though they belonged to another life. Alas! Life in the mortal realm passes as swiftly as a flying arrow. To avoid the toils of the world, one must cast off honor and disgrace, escape its snares, sever worldly ties, and awaken to true essence. This is the path of the great man—transcending the world in solitary perfection, attaining the supreme joy of heaven and earth.

Alas! The world possesses the teachings of the Dao and the path to immortality, found in the books of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Yet only their profound principles are transmitted, while their practical arts are concealed. Among military texts, there is the *Six Strategies of Lü*. Only their practical knowledge is practiced, while their illusory and shamanic methods are kept secret. Some, like Benrong, point to the black of Huang’s curve, losing the essential and marvelous while compiling their diagrams.

Later scholars grasp only the coarse and miss the refined, seize the spokes but not the hub, passing down errors until the truth is lost. Thus, the Way of the subtle and formless remains grasped but unapplied, and the arts of resonance and response are practiced without efficacy. Abandoning the mysterious and void, they cling to tangible existence, so their worldly arts follow rigid rules. When peril and calamity strike, there is no escape, and the body cannot be freed.

How lamentable! Those who study the Dao today violate its inherent principles and misuse its arts. The most skilled in martial affairs excel in strategy but fail in transformation. Thus, they exhaust themselves in preservation yet falter in action.

Alas! What is the use of mere learning? If one studies the books of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi and masters their arts, grasps the essence of the *Six Strategies* and comprehends the illusory, then one may possess method without reliance, achieve stillness to overcome motion, softness to subdue hardness, and move freely in the realm of transformation—entering and exiting the domains of being and non-being. One may perfect the self or preserve a nation—this is true wholeness.

I am now ninety-[illegible] years old. Though my sinews and bones remain strong, my fate is uncertain. Fearing this book may be left in some mountain ravine, its origins unknown to those who find it, I have examined its earlier records and composed this preface, that future readers may understand its provenance.

**Yearly Attendant: Metal**
**Gathering Forms**

When inscribing, face the northwest and recite the incantation: *Luolun niyou*, three times.

**Monthly Attendant: Wood**
**Gathering Forms**
When inscribing talismans, face the east and recite the incantation: *Shuoluo xinluozi*, three times.

**Daily Attendant: Water**

**Hourly Attendant: Fire**
**Gathering Forms**
When inscribing talismans, face the south and recite the incantation: *Tulong tulong heyì*, five times.

**Embryonic Attendant: Earth**
**Gathering Forms**
When inscribing talismans, turn your back to the north and face south, reciting the incantation in silence: *Wanxu xutuoyuan yixing*, seven times. Upon completion, spread the register on the ground, place your face upon it, and prostrate for a quarter-hour. Roll up the register and rise with it upon your person.

When inscribing this register, select a metal year, wood month, water day, and fire hour, ensuring each coincides with an auspicious stellar constellation. When erecting an altar to inscribe the register, three days prior, prepare a memorial to present to the Imperial Lord, formally requesting the presence of the Twenty-Four Marshals. Arrange their positions in order, inscribe the hidden phrases, and write with cinnabar ground from the *yongquan* acupoint on yellow paper.

On the appointed day, select an open space, purify it thoroughly, and construct a three-tiered altar of yellow earth. Place twenty-four ritual vessels upon it, and at the altar’s center, set a goblet. Burn incense and reverently invite: *The Great Dao, Master of Mystic Perfection and Marvelous Response, the True and Void Tuo, Emperor of the Wanxuan Cave on Mount Xuanpu*. Then summon the Twenty-Four Marshals, bow twice, and pour wine. After a while, a violent wind will rise, carrying away the wine vessels. Compose your mind, visualize, loosen your hair, grasp your sword, close your eyes, and assume the posture.

Ascend the altar to inscribe the register. Spread a square of yellow silk, three feet and six inches wide, and grind cinnabar with water from the *yongquan* of the four directions. Face each direction, recite the incantations, and inscribe the register. First write the names of the Twenty-Four Marshals, arranging their talismans in a circle around the four directions, six to each side. Begin with the Marshal whose name starts with *Wan* in the west, proceeding in order until all are inscribed, then write the central section. Start from the character *Metal* and end with *Earth*. Press your face to the silk, prostrate for a quarter-hour, roll up the register, rise, and recite the incantation nine times: *Wanxu yu lun jiugang, fanyan yunli chanyu yunhuang*. Descend from the altar.

All ritual implements and objects required for the altar rites must be prepared in advance for timely use.

**Talisman of the Marshal’s Envoy** (one talisman)

**Direct Marshal’s Envoy** wears a yellow headscarf, dons the celestial talisman robe, and black boots. His face is dark, his eyes large, and he bears a beard, wielding a bone mace.

**Gathering Forms Ritual**: For all talisman-writing, set up the altar and burn turmeric incense with a cup of wine, five fruits, and paint a fire dragon-horse. Invoke the Envoy of the Blazing Earth and Fierce Wind to gallop in spirals. Bow twice, pour the wine, and burn the horse. Don the black robe, let down the hair, and bare the feet. Read the memorial and proclamation, then burn the painted dragon chariot, phoenix chariot, qilin chariot, lion-rhinoceros chariot—one each—and twenty-four fire dragon-horses, along with the Marshal’s Envoy talisman at the altar. Recite the incantation thrice while burning:

*Xuàn liè yù lú yíng yú wǎn xuán.*

After the burning is complete, clear the altar of wine and fruits. Close your eyes, visualize in meditation, and sit in silence for one hour. Soon, the sound of wind will rush away from the altar.

On the third day, transcribe the talisman according to the method, roll it into a small scroll, wrap it in red silk, and place it in the *zhēng* chamber upon the altar. Each dawn, burn turmeric incense and perform the ritual, invoking the *Kun* trigram’s script and *qi*. Recite the incantation fifteen times:

*Kūnlún wǎn xuán, jù fàn lú yǔ, yù yǔ líng sù, xuàn tuó mó lù.*

Then knock the teeth seven times. Maintain this practice with fasting and abstinence for thirty-six days. If, in the night, you dream of a room filled with golden light, the ritual’s efficacy is confirmed. Upon execution, offerings of wine, fruits, chariots, and horses will respond. The fasting and ritual observances follow the system established by Zhang Jing.

**Prohibited Foods**:
Birds: owl, wild goose, teal, kite.
Beasts: bear, dog, fox, hare.
Water creatures: electric catfish, carp, otter.
Plants: scallion, leek.
Consuming any of the above violates the precepts.

**Seven Precepts**:
1. Do not engage in illicit lust.
2. Do not take others’ belongings.
3. Do not kill without cause.
4. Do not speak recklessly.
5. Do not exalt yourself and belittle others.
6. Do not covet without restraint.
7. Do not rely on the Dao to deceive the world.

Observe these seven precepts strictly for thirty-six days. Avoid women, impure objects, and vulgar speech.

**Sword-Casting Method**:
Take nine *jin* of Liangzhou iron. Use red earth for the furnace and yellow earth for the mold. Melt the iron with intense fire. Face south, invoke the Heavenly Gate, recite the true mantras of the Twenty-Four Generals, and inscribe twenty-four talismans. Form a pellet from cinnabar and wine, open the furnace, and cast it into the molten iron. Lift the furnace to pour into the mold.

After a long while, remove the clay mold. Fill a large jar with *yǒngquán* spring water and plunge the sword into it. If the water resounds like thunder and the blade hums with clouds, it is excellent. The sword should be three *chi* and two *cun* long, with a hilt of eight *cun*, cast in one piece. Use *yǒngquán* water from the west of your dwelling.

**Carving Seals with Thunder-Split Wood**:
Wood harboring snake or spider spirits possesses spiritual resonance and harms dragons. Thunderbolts destroy such spirits. Thus, shatter the wood—only thunder-split cypress is used for the Upper Primordial Dharma Seal.

**Volume One: Eight Methods**
**First: The Primordial Breath**

It dispels scorching heat. It redirects raging flames, swiftly summons sailfish and perch, and bolsters military might.

The *lài* is the void of Heaven and Earth, the qi called the force of wind-strike. Though formless to the eye, it stirs and ceases in an instant, transforming with the qi. There are whirlwinds, fierce winds, warm winds, and freezing winds—arising from the eight directions, shifting with a single motion.

The method of *fālài* (Invoking the Wind):
Barefoot and with hair unbound, wield the sword in the left hand. Hold the talisman toward the west, knock the teeth in ritual sequence, and close the eyes to assume the posture. A violent wind will rise at once—if directed west, it will arise in the west and cease only when the time is right.

Knock the teeth nine times, recite the incantation eight times, raise the sword to point toward the desired direction, brandish a talisman, press the seal with a finger, close the eyes to assume the posture, and laugh aloud once. The violent wind will follow your will and arrive immediately.

Recite the eightfold incantation:
*Cuàn yú liè yú yù tuó shēn yǔ.*

Form the *Tiāngāng* Seal:
Disperse Form, Gather Form.

**Second: Zhènpèi**
It can relieve severe drought, extinguish raging fires, and resolve warfare.

*Zhèn* is movement—it brings forth thunder and lightning. Steaming with the dense interplay of yin and yang, it surges with the force of a coiled dragon. The eight winds and five darknesses converge in a sudden burst, shaking the vault of Heaven, and rain pours forth.

The method of *Zhèn*:
With the sword, dig three *chi* into the earth to reach the abyss. Kindle a fierce fire until the pit glows red-hot. Facing the fire-pit, with hair unbound and sword in hand, recite the incantation fifteen times.

The incantation:
*Xuàn yù táo yù chén yù mó.*

Disperse Form—each inscribed with the Five Thunder Red Talisman.
Gather Form, Disperse Form.

Gather Form, Disperse Form, Gather Form, Disperse Form, Gather Form, Disperse Form, Gather Form.

For the five talismans above: inscribe and cast them into wine, then pour the talisman-wine into the fire-pit. Recite the incantation three times:

*Pēn lú pēn lú tuó yǔ.*

**Third: Fǒuxīng**
It can obscure another’s visibility while concealing oneself, or dispel daylight at will.

Stars are the images of Heaven and the markers of Earth. They originate from the Great Ultimate and revolve without end. There are the stars of sages, of ministers, of generals, of fortune, and of ruin—all recorded within the Dark Heaven and governing all beings.

The star of the sage shines bright and clear;
The star of the minister glows vast and luminous;
The star of the general blazes red and radiant;
The star of fortune and good augury gleams pure and white;
The star of the poor and lowly dims and shrinks.
They rise and set according to a person’s capacity and destiny.

The adept observer can discern the fortune or misfortune of sages, the rise or decline of ministers, the promotions or demotions of generals, and the waxing or waning of blessings and calamities.

To obscure a star and observe its omens, employ the method of concealment:
Use a new earthen jar, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar, and affix it to the exact center of the base. Don ritual robes, let down the hair, and hold the sword to assist the Celestial Pass. Recite the incantation once, draw in a breath of *qi*, and blow into the jar. After nine repetitions, the effect is unleashed—overturn the jar onto the ground, and the star will be veiled in obscurity.

To make a star’s brilliance reappear and its traces vanish, simply refrain from inscribing the circular opening. The star will then shine forth of its own clarity. Recite the incantation nine times, and exhale nine breaths of *qi*.

The incantation:
*Wǎn xuán jù jīng mó lú mó lú.*

Disperse Form, Gather Form.

The Fourth Method states: It can avert water disasters and ensure journeys proceed with favorable weather. Clouds are the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, concealed within mountains and rivers yet surging into the vault of the sky, now gathering, now dispersing, their substance ever unfixed. When clouds rise, rain swells; when they stagnate and fail to scatter, rain persists. Prolonged rain causes the hundred rivers to overflow, and the blessing of nourishment becomes harm instead.

The Yu method: Recite the incantation seven times, then draw a talisman upon the ground with the sword. Once drawn, exert force to slash the earthen talisman with a fierce strike, then reverse the motion to sweep upward toward Heaven with a single flourish. Shout "Swift!"—and at once, a furious fair wind will rise, and the murky clouds will disperse. For prolonged rain or stubborn barbarian clouds that refuse to scatter, simply perform this method: recite the incantation seven times. The incantation: *Yú lí jù tuó.*

*Disperse Form*
*Gather Form*

Afterward, with the sword, trace from the Canopy Star to the Five Thunders and shout "Swift!"

---

The Fifth Method: Damming Waters—It can extricate troops from mired paths and ford assembled ranks. When the Great Ultimate first divided, the pure *qi* became Heaven, the turbid *qi* became Earth, and the blended *qi* transformed into water—thus the Three Powers. Once the Three Powers were established, the myriad things were born. Water is their body, circulating above and below; clouds are its spirit, the moon its essence. It issues from mountains and converges in the sea, draining through the Tail Gate and gathering in the Palace of Yin. Through the four seasons, it acts and rests, rises and falls; its depth and clarity respond to spring and autumn, while its tides are governed by the dark and new moons. Springs overflow in the southwest, rivers crisscross the world—there are water spirits and aquatic creatures.

When leading an omen-numbered host or a thousand vessels, should you wish to cross swift currents, there is a method to dam the waters. The method: Upon the boat, let down the hair and grasp the sword. Pour a cup of wine, face east, and recite the incantation twenty-four times. Draw in twenty-four breaths of *qi* and blow into the wine. Once done, take a mouthful of wine and spit it back into the cup. Cry out loudly: *Yǔ tuó xuàn.* Pour the wine into the water, and the surface will roar like a storm—thus the waters are dammed. Waves surge, the river reverses its flow, and vessels cross swiftly; the world calls this "borrowing the tide." Recite the incantation twenty times. The incantation: *Shěn luó yǎn luó táo yǒng lú.*

---

The Sixth Method: Congealing Rivers—It can relieve scorching heat, ferry men and horses, and deliver from great peril. To congeal is to solidify water. When yang wanes and yin prevails, amid the eight winds and five *qi* of Heaven and Earth, a biting transformation occurs, and water naturally freezes. This *qi* is called the Yin Wind, concealed within the Earthly Palace. When Heaven’s yang weakens, the wind emerges, and water congeals into ice. The congealing of the seasons occurs during the Five Yins. When six yins and one yang reach the time of utmost cold, even in spring, summer, or autumn, one may congeal by summoning the Severe Yin Wind.

The method: Slaughter a sheep, take a jar of its blood, and inscribe a talisman. Cast it into the blood, dig a pit three feet deep, recite the incantation nine times, and pour the blood into the pit. Cover it with earth, then point the sword at the water and recite: *Míng lěng liè dīng jí.* A frigid wind will suddenly rise upon the water’s surface, and in an instant, it will freeze solid. Recite the incantation nine times. The incantation: *Liè níng dū lù yú xùn.*

*Disperse Form*
Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar
*Gather Form*

**Seventh: Extinguishing Fire**
This can be used to rescue from fire disasters. Fire is the yang of Heaven and Earth, transformed from qi. It is refined in the Great Yang, conceals its nature within grasses and trees, and is crimson in color. It flourishes in the south, as yang in the heavens above and harmony upon the earth. When objects strike one another, it emerges, and once it does, it reduces them to ash. The world relies on grasses and trees of all kinds for cooking and sustenance, a benefit to life. Yet if it erupts, it turns dwellings to flying ash, fans flames through mountains and forests, and becomes a scourge upon the world.

The method for extinguishing: When a raging fire breaks out in any location, regardless of distance, simply face the direction of the blaze, recite the incantation nine times, and spray a mouthful of water while chanting. Then, rain will suddenly crash down from the sky upon the fire, and the flames will be extinguished. Recite the incantation nine times. The incantation: *Suō yú suō yú jié tuó suō yú.*

**Eighth: Commanding Clouds**
This can be used to summon clouds, traverse great heights and distances, escape encirclement, forget the mortal world, and ascend to immortality. Cloud-qi is an insubstantial, drifting thing. It soars through the azure sky, gathering and dispersing, now concealing, now expanding—now a torrential downpour, now a rushing gale. How could it be without sentience? There is a method to command it.

The method: Form the Soaring Dragon Seal with the left hand and recite the incantation thirty-six times. Gaze upward and visualize as if someone were lifting you from below. Then step forward—your feet will not touch the ground, and clouds will gather beneath them. Do not look down. In an instant, you will cross perilous heights of ten thousand fathoms and traverse a hundred leagues of wilderness. When your feet touch the earth again, you will have arrived at your destination.

First, consume thirty-six pills of the Elixir of Rising Dragons. To prepare the elixir: Take four *zhū* of roses and seven stalks of *longqi* mushroom, place them in a jar, and refine them over a fierce fire for three days. Remove and grind them into a fine powder. Mix with the original essence of *yongquan* (to the size of a □), then refine again for three days. Divide into four doses and take one each morning while facing west, washing it down with a cup of *yongquan* water. After four days, this technique will take effect.

Recite the incantation thirty-six times. The incantation: *Yún luó mó wéi mó yǔ yú xuán.*

**Soaring Dragon Seal**
Once the incantation is complete, you will ascend to your destination.

This *zhi* grows on mountains and plains across the land, upon dragon-stone cliffs. In spring, it blooms with flowers; its leaves are thick and verdant, covered in white fuzz. When the sun shines, they curl inward; when rain falls, they unfurl lush and vigorous. Harvest it in late spring when its growth is at its peak.

To perform this technique, first consume thirty-six pills of the Elixir of Roses. The elixir is made from roses...

*Secret Register of the Spirit Terrace of Mount Xuanpu, Volume Two*
**First: The Thunder Formation**
This can subdue and vanquish the mighty without battle, securing victory without combat. When halting an army, the key lies in securing the right position—where the terrain is strong, the army’s power grows, and with such power, the enemy is overcome.

On the day of battle, station your formation in a position of advantage, where the terrain is robust and the configuration formidable. Then, assess the ground where the enemy’s formation will halt, ensuring your position is equal in strength. First, employ the Thunder Rite.

**Thunder Rite:** Inscribe thirty-six talismans. Dispatch thirty-six men, each carrying one talisman. They shall wear black robes, let their hair loose, and wield swords. Their faces painted red, they ride horses, each bearing a drum on their back. At night, they depart from the main formation, gallop suddenly to the enemy’s position, dismount, and dig a hole three *chi* deep with their swords. Each buries their talisman, then levels the earth. Facing the enemy, they shout "Kill!" three times and strike their drums once. They repeat this three times, then cry out three battle roars and sound the drums again. After three repetitions, they turn, mount their horses, and rush back to the main formation.

Thereafter, when the two armies meet and the enemy halts on this ground, they will see chaotic flames rising in the night, hear thunder shaking their ears, and witness spectral warriors and horses wailing in terror. Their soldiers will turn on one another, fighting through the night until dawn, and their formation will be utterly routed.

Inscribe thirty-six talismans in cinnabar. For each talisman, recite the incantation three times and blow a breath of *qi* upon it. The incantation: *Xuàn léi mó xuán.*

**Dispersed Form**
**Assembled Form**

**Second: Concealed Armor**

This method can obscure grand designs and exhaust the enemy’s strategies. In warfare, the true form of weapons must never be revealed—what matters is their ability to shift shape and vanish, now gathering, now dispersing, their substance like clouds, their alignment like a mouth. They transform in size, expand and contract, and wherever they strike, victory or defeat is decided. Those who meet them will falter; those who pursue will never catch them. This is the subtlety of the Dao of masterful warfare.

Whenever a general must conceal an army of countless thousands, revealing only a fraction of its true strength, there is a method to conceal them. The method of concealment: inscribe talismans and affix them to the helmets of soldiers and weapons. Recite incantations over wine and sprinkle it upon the horses. Thus, an army of a million may be hidden in ten places, a hundred thousand in ten places—divided by tens and concealed across scattered mountains, valleys, and open plains. Men and horses make no sound; no battle clouds rise; all vanish without trace. When the enemy approaches, sound the drums to summon them, and they will gather like clouds in an instant, sweeping the foe away like dust.

Recite the incantation twenty-five times. The incantation: *Shuō hǔ fù jù lú.* Blow twenty-five breaths of *qi* into the wine and sprinkle it into the horses’ mouths.

**Dispersed Form Talisman** (inscribed in cinnabar)
**Assembled Form**

**Third: Emerging Springs**
For thirst on the march—greatly auspicious.
Springs are the veins of the earth, circulating through the soil. Paths may be open or blocked; sources may be shallow or deep. To the south, they overflow through the apertures of *Kan*; to the north, they congeal in thick earth. In spring they stir, in autumn they still—where the earth is opened, they must flow.

There are warm springs, cold springs, and gushing springs. When an army camps in a land of dense soil without rivers or sources, one may stand amidst the troops, face the heavens, and draw *qi* nine times. Recite the incantation nine times, then with force blow upon the sword’s edge and thrust it into the ground. Shout once sharply, wrench the blade with fury, and a gushing spring will burst forth.

Recite the incantation nine times. The incantation: *□ yú yì ruì wù lì.*

**Fourth: Fire Arrows**
To weaken the strong and spare the weak from destruction.
In war, when troops are few and supplies meager, one must not provoke a superior force. If the enemy’s fortifications are sturdy, their provisions abundant, and their men and horses fierce, to engage them is to court defeat—do not fight them. First, use this method to ravage their strength; then, battle them, and victory will be as effortless as turning one’s palm.

**Arrow Method:**
Take a basin of wine and a measure of ground cinnabar. Dip a brush and inscribe thirty-six talismans upon the wine’s surface. Recite the incantation thirty-six times and blow thirty-six breaths of *qi* into the wine. Prepare a brazier of blazing fire and five arrows. Heat the arrowheads until red-hot, then quench them in the wine thirty-six times.

That night, ride alone near the enemy’s camp and suddenly loose the five arrows before retreating swiftly. Where the arrows strike, flames will surge upward, wildfire scattering in all directions. Whatever they touch—grass or wood—will blaze fiercely. The conflagration will spread unchecked, burning through their strength, and even deep ravines will offer no refuge. Thus, the mightiest army will be broken.

Recite the incantation thirty-six times. The incantation: *Cuàn yán yú liè hè yì.*

**Dispersed Form**
**Assembled Form**

**Fifth: Forming the Shaded Blossom of Hua**
This can avert the perils of exhaustion, parched suffering, and scorching affliction. When campaigning in the height of summer, the blazing heat may grow so fierce that soldiers suffer from unbearable thirst or even perish from dehydration—such an army is doomed to defeat, for this is the gravest misfortune of waging war out of season. To avert this disaster, there is a method to summon dark clouds and form the Shaded Blossom of Hua, which will cool the scorching *qi* and make vast plains and fiery fields habitable.

The *Yin* method: Take a small iron kettle and five talismans, fill it with wine, and seal them inside. When you wish to form the shade, heat the kettle over fire, then recite the incantation while dripping water into it fifteen times. Warm *qi* will surge forth, and five clouds will rise in response. In an instant, the Shaded Blossom will take form, darkening the skies for a hundred *li*, dispelling the heat and bringing a freezing wind.

Recite the incantation fifteen times. The incantation: *Lóng yù lú mó xuán.*

**Sixth: Transforming Plants and Trees into Soldiers**
This allows the nonexistent to become real, the small to overcome the great, and substitutes to bear the labor. It can command three thousand six hundred soldiers to sweep away a million-strong host. By the method of emptiness and nothingness, you summon spirits and compel the sentient; even the insentient—plants and trees—will tremble and respond. Then, venomous creatures will swarm forth, a hundred monstrosities will manifest, and though the enemy’s troops be numerous, none can withstand them.

The transformation method: On the day of battle, dishevel your hair and brandish your sword. Inscribe the twenty-four generals’ talismans and hidden words, then recite the incantation while blowing black *qi* to the five directions, repeating the incantation three times. The three thousand six hundred soldiers, each mounted, will dishevel their hair, paint their faces red, gird swords, and hang drums—uniform in appearance and bearing. At the onset of battle, send forth a valiant warrior to charge the enemy lines. From the central camp, burn the talisman, let out a thunderous shout, and strike the gongs and drums in unison. Venomous insects and fierce beasts will surge toward the enemy, while the grasses and trees of the surrounding fields transform into soldiers and cavalry, charging in unison. The enemy will hear only the roar of swift thunder, see only the dazzling chaos of firelight, and behold towering figures and mountainous chariots closing in from behind. Panic will seize them, and in their flight, they will fill rivers and choke ravines, their forces utterly routed.

When the momentum peaks and the tide turns, withdraw the troops swiftly. A single deployment of this formation will break nine-tenths of the enemy’s strength.

Recite the incantation thrice, the incantation being: *"Wan xuan hua ju suo you li."*

Invoke the Five Directions, recite the incantation thrice for each, and blow qi toward one direction.

Carve wood into figures of men and horses to bear their burdens in their stead, dispelling toil. When animated, they may be commanded as if alive, transporting heavy provisions and easing the ranks. Have soldiers oversee them, with a red banner leading at the front and a metal mallet driving from behind. Should the burdened figures falter or the ranks grow disordered, strike their heads with the mallet, and they will move as swiftly as the wind.

The method: carve their limbs into segments, bore through their joints, and thread them with rope. Inscribe talismans and incantations, sprinkle wine upon their faces, and write the talismans of the Twenty-Four Generals for the Five Directions. For each direction, recite the incantation thrice and blow a breath of qi.

For dispersal: carve the wooden figures with articulated joints and inscribe talismans in blood.

For assembly: recite the wine incantation: *"Wan yu yin yu yu."* Rub nine times, blow nine breaths of qi into the wine, and inscribe the red banner talisman. Lead the water-borne figures to march.

Dispersal. Assembly.

The Seventh: Swift Ascent
This enables one to rise and escape nets, transforming the world into a land of fortune. In times of peril, when one seeks to flee far, employ this method. Recite the Twenty-Four Generals’ secret incantation, pace the Five Directions’ *gang*, close the eyes and visualize—do not open them until the sound of wind and rain ceases, for then you will have arrived elsewhere. Thus may one traverse a thousand *li* in a single night.

Pacing the *gang*:
Face north, step left forward to the east; return to the center, then left forward again. Pass east to the south, right forward; south to the west, right forward. While pacing, recite the Twenty-Four Generals’ secret incantation, beginning at the center and ending at the center, seated upright throughout.

The Eighth: Water Passage
This averts water’s harm, secures sea islands, and ensures unobstructed paths. To cross waters alone, regardless of river or sea’s distance, inscribe the talisman and pace accordingly. Affix the talisman to the soles of both feet, press the *Fei Zhi* seal with the left hand, recite the incantation nine times, and step into the water as though treading level ground. Wherever the feet alight, waves and swells shall not arise.

Recite the incantation nine times:
*"Yu mo yu mo xu yu."*
*Fei Zhi* Seal
Dispersal.

*Beginning of the Lower Scroll of the Mysterious Garden Mountain’s Numinous Talismanic Register*

**First: Initiating Radiance**
This can delude and subdue enemy troops by illusion.
Radiance is the most refined substance of luminous brilliance.
Its essence is solar essence, truly the most refined, and yang essence temporarily conjoined with matter.
Radiance, the light of the Great Yang, is crystalline and supremely yang; when its light emerges, all other lights submit and vanish.
Among the many luminous brilliances, there is crystalline light, firelight, and divine light.
Divine light is empty light—dazzling yet without substance.
This illusory, empty light can also be summoned.
**Method of Initiation:** Inscribe one talisman and affix it to the *Niwan* (mud-palladium). Close the eyes and sit upright.
When radiance soars into the night sky amidst the army, none shall perceive its source, and all shall submit to its marvel.

**Dispersed Form**
**Gathered Form**

**Second: Concealing Essence**
This averts grievous harm and extricates one from great peril.
Essence is the root, the substance.
When stagnant, one is ensnared by circumstances; when essence arises, nothing can cause harm.
In moments of imminent danger, when harm threatens to befall you, there is a method to conceal yourself.
**Method of Concealment:** Recite the incantation three times, exhale a breath of *qi* into the left palm, and press the *Ju Tao* seal. Thus, essence is concealed, and you shall vanish from sight—this sees that, but that does not see this.
Recite the incantation three times:
*"Wan luo hu."*
*Ju Tao* Seal

**Third: Transforming Things**
This can transform all things.
Transformation is the mutual transmutation of things.
Essence is the extraordinary.
One *qi* alters, yet the myriad forms differ.
Thus, there is the transformation of nonbeing into being, and being into nonbeing; the rising transforms into the sinking, and the sinking into the rising.
*Qi* transforms within, and essence changes without.
There are celestial transformations, material transformations, and divine transformations.
Celestial transformations: winds and clouds stir, mountains and rivers shift.
Material transformations: the *kun* becomes the *peng*, the pheasant becomes the *shen*, the *wangxiang* becomes stone, and the transformations of minute things are innumerable.
Those in water ascend and fly in the wind; those in the wind descend and enter the water.
One *qi* shifts, and one form changes.
Divine transformations: concealment and manifestation, illusion and reality, unrestrained change.
One can transform form into a flying bird, essence into cloud-*qi*, conjure empty *qi* into firelight, turn earth and stone into treasures, or treasures into earth and stone—suddenly present, suddenly absent, all by method.
**Method of Transformation:** Press the *Xuan* seal with the right hand, cover the *Gao Yu* (vital elixir field) while visualizing, recite the incantation three times, and shout once sharply. The form of the thing shall respond and change.
Recite the incantation three times:
*"A na xuan yu."*
*Xuan* Seal
With the right hand, bend the little finger behind the four fingers, bend the index finger behind the middle finger, entwine the second finger with the fourth finger, and entwine the middle finger with the thumb. The thumb presses the index finger.

**Fourth: Attaching Dreams**
This can convey messages across blocked distances and communicate matters otherwise difficult to express.

**Of Dreams:**
Dreams are the spirit-soul’s response to events, manifesting in the heart’s realm. When the heart’s intent is joyful, dreams are blissful; when the intent is sorrowful, dreams are perilous. Any disturbance will bring forth the scene of the matter. To convey words across heavy prohibitions or communicate affairs across a thousand *li*, there is a method for attachment.

**Method of Attachment:**
Inscribe one talisman, then visualize the *Gao Huang* (vital elixir field) as the destination. Close the eyes, lie supine, and concentrate on that place—thus, the dream shall reach it. One will see the people there as if arriving in person, and they, too, shall see one in their dreams. Conversing and discussing matters, nothing shall remain obstructed.

**Fifth: Dispersing and Gathering Forms**
**Expelling Poison:**
This can avert all manner of poisonous harm. Poisons are the creatures of mountains and rivers—serpents, scorpions, tigers, wolves, bears, and the like, all things that harm humans. When troops encamp in desolate lands or wild frontiers, poisonous beings inevitably appear. There is a method to dispel them.

**Method of Expulsion:**
Use a yellow banner, inscribe the *Five Ding* talisman upon it, and plant it in the center of the army. Then all beasts shall flee, poisonous creatures vanish, and every venomous evil depart from a thousand *li*.

**Sixth: Suppressing the Shèn**
This can suppress and control shèn-creatures.
The shèn is a submerged being of the waters. When the earth’s qi is solemn, it lies hidden; when the earth’s qi is warm, it emerges. In wild winds and surging waters, its nature turns violent, breaching cities and collapsing dikes, becoming a great scourge to the world.
**Method of Suppression:**
Bind a sheet of iron, one foot square and two inches thick. Grind cinnabar with leopard’s blood and inscribe the talisman upon it. Board a boat, hold this talisman, recite the incantation, and cast it into the depths where the shèn lurks. So long as the iron remains uncorroded, the shèn shall not dare emerge.
To recognize the abyss where the shèn hides: it is where the water runs deep yet no fish dwell.
Recite the prayer and cast the talisman. The incantation reads: *Wǎn xuán yù mó jù yóu fù.*
**Upper Prime Method:** Simply inscribe the *Subduing Serpent Talisman.*
**Dispersing Form:** Recite the *Incantation of the Four Emperors*
**Gathering Form**

**Seventh: Beheading Demonic Beings**
This can dispel evil spirits and rectify living beings.
Demonic beings are the numinous creatures of mountains and rivers—*sīhǔ*, mountain cats, white serpents, red turtles, centipedes, pheasants, and the like. Concealed for years, they absorb the spiritual qi of heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers, gaining mastery over transformation. Their traces manifest in uncanny ways, their forms shifting into alluring guises to bewitch the world. Some turn caves into resplendent halls, others transmute their bodies into precious jade, or illusory earth and stone into fair maidens. Those ensnared by their delusions forget all human affairs, believing themselves to have ascended as immortals. Yet when sudden terrors arise, their voices wail like the wild, and in the dead of night, violent winds stir, stealing household vessels and seizing mortal treasures. If not eradicated, these demons grow ever stronger, mingling with humanity to wreak great harm upon the world.
**Method of Beheading:**
Take a piece of red silk, two feet and four inches square, and inscribe the talisman with sheep’s blood. Affix it to a pole, hold it aloft, and face the four directions, reciting the incantation thirty-six times. Roll it into a scroll, place it upon the ground, and with a great shout, sever it in two with a sword. All demonic beings in the surrounding directions shall have their heads struck off.
Recite the *Thirty-Six Glances* thirty-six times. The incantation reads: *Wǎn nà yún yú nì lì mó.*
**Dispersing Form**
**Gathering Form**

**Eighth Vajra Binding**
This method can restrain fierce malevolent spirits and sever ghostly afflictions. The *Vajra* is a divine force of the Brahmā-realm that annihilates demons and evil spirits. Whenever a powerful malevolent spirit arises—unable to bring blessings, only calamity, and beyond the reach of conventional remedies—this method alone can subdue it, ensuring it never returns to wreak havoc.

In the mountains and rivers, when demonic spirits and ghosts stir trouble among mortals, a thousand strange and fearful omens arise, terrifying the people. They may possess fierce beasts that enter the marketplace or take hold of a person’s body, driving them into madness: ravenous, insatiable, or fasting for ten days without rice, then suddenly bursting forth with the strength to uproot century-old trees or lift objects of immense weight. If their rampage continues unchecked, the afflicted person will perish. When women are bewitched, they laugh and sneer uncontrollably, shamelessly singing and wailing at all hours. When such malevolence reaches its peak, their wails shake the wilderness, and their cries echo through the night markets. Without ritual intervention, they bring great harm to the world.

**Method of Binding:**
Take thirty-six taels of hemp, dye it red, and twist it into a cord. When the malevolent spirit manifests, recite the incantation eight times and cast the cord into the air. Wherever the cord lands, it will bind the afflicting entity—if upon a person, the person is bound; if upon a beast, the beast is bound; if upon grass or trees, they are bound. The more it struggles, the tighter the binding grows, until the spirit pleads for mercy without end. Then, interrogate it for its reasons, force it to confess its crimes, and exact an oath of restraint. Only then may the binding be released by ritual, and the spirit will dare not return.

Recite the incantation eight times. The incantation reads: *Yù, or alternatively, Biàn jù yóu fù.*
To release the binding, recite the incantation three times. The incantation reads: *Chū yú chū yú suō lì.*

The incantations within this method are sacred words of the Brahmā deities. The talisman embodies the primordial form of the spirit’s *qi*, while the mudrā (finger seals) manifest the wondrous efficacy of their divine intent. The seal is the essence of the ritual’s power, a means of sustaining and transmitting the method. This practice must never be employed lightly or at inopportune times.

**Dispersing Form**
The talisman must be drawn to commune with the spirits, accompanied by the proper finger seals. This is the esoteric name of the Celestial Sovereign, mirroring the mysteries of Heaven above and suppressing the dead below.

**Gathering Form**
*(See separate compilation.)*

**First: The Unobstructed Method**
Simply draw a double-door diagram on a wall, table, or the ground to represent the location. With the right hand, trace the seal and recite the incantation five times, then point the seal at the door to ascend. To return, trace the seal with the left hand, close the eyes, and click the teeth five times before receding. Recite the incantation five times. The incantation reads: *Xuán luó huí yù suō lì.*

First, bend the right thumb, then the middle finger together with the remaining four.

**Second: The Spirit-Walking Method**
Draw two identical talismans and bind them beneath the knees. Recite the incantation eight times, and the steps will become swift as wind and clouds. To halt, release the seal. The seal remains as before. Recite the incantation eight times. The incantation reads: *Yú lún sū lú mó yóu lì.*

**Dispersing Form**

**The Śavava Seal**
Bend the left middle finger, pressing its tip against the thumb so the nail remains concealed.

**Third (Missing)**

**Sixth: Drawing Fish from a Basin**
Take one ceramic basin and recite the incantation nine times while drawing a fish within it. Bind the number nine to a thread, place the fish’s head into the basin, and call out, *"Yú lóng!"* Pull the thread, and the fish will appear—ten pulls yield ten fish. Recite the incantation nine times. The incantation reads: *Suō fù lún jié lún zǐ.*

**Seventh: Boiling Water with Stone**
Grind one portion of cinnabar with wine, fill a jar with spring water, and dip a brush into the cinnabar. Recite the twenty-four generals’ secret words while inscribing twenty-four talismans upon the water’s surface. Ignite a brazier, expose it to the sun, and take one stone to be fired until red-hot. Pierce the jar with it twenty-four times. Once complete, wrap the stone in red paper.

For harm caused by creatures in water where no remedy exists, bind this stone with a cord and cast it into the depths of the afflicted pool or cavern. The water will boil like a seething cauldron, and whatever preys upon men will instantly scorch and rot.

**Eighth (Missing)**
**Ninth: Feigning Death**

For all who die, it is because their primordial *qi* is exhausted. When *qi* is exhausted, the four limbs and all vessels grow cold. Whenever one focuses the mind to guide *qi* into the crescent moon, with kidney *qi* stored within, then all vessels and four limbs grow cold at once. The skin takes on the hue of earth, the nine orifices seal shut—only the ears remain open to the affairs of the world. Gently cover the *gaoyu* point with the hand, and life returns. Recite the breath-sealing incantation, which says: *Mie luo wang xuan he yan.*

**Tenth: Flying and Halting in Midair**
Recite the incantation nine times, exhale a breath of *qi*, and scatter an object—it will halt in place. If one wishes to send it far, recite the *xiaoyao* incantation three times, and with a single scatter, it will travel a thousand *li*. Recite the halting incantation nine times, which says: *Xu lu xu luo zhi.*

To recite the *xiaoyao* incantation three times, say: *Mo yu shi yu.*

**Eleventh: Paper Crane in Flight**
Recite the *yuhua* incantation seven times, exhale three breaths of *qi*, and scatter a paper crane—it will take wing and soar. The *yuhua* incantation says: *Ti quan yu xiang fei hua shen tian zhu hu shi zhe zhun chi, su she lai wu dao qian, bu de wei ling. Ru wei, zhun Tai Shang lü ling quan.*

Recite the incantation seven times, which says: *Suo li □ lou bi li chi fan.* Recite the incantation seven times, which says: *Sa mo he.*

**Twelfth: Elixir of the Iron True Body**
Take one piece of *shehanshi*, one jar of wine, and grind cinnabar with *shiye* spring water. Inscribe twenty-four talismans while reciting the twenty-four generals’ secret words, dipping the brush once for each talisman. After inscribing, fire the *shehanshi* in a blazing flame until red-hot, then quench it in the wine, repeating until the wine is exhausted. Pulverize the stone into powder and mix it with *shiye* spring water to form pellets. Each morning, take eight pellets with a cup of *yongquan* water, recite the twenty-four generals’ secret words, and face north to ingest them. When facing peril, recite the incantation three times, draw in a breath of *qi*, and the body will become unyielding.

Inscribe the talisman in the wine, and at the critical moment, recite the incantation three times, which says: *Mo yu ju wan ju li yi.*

**Thirteenth: Entering the Flask**
Inscribe one *huanhua* talisman and cast it into the flask. Recite the incantation five times, leap with a sudden motion, and enter the flask. Recite the incantation five times, which says: *Xuan yu xuan yu you li.*

**Huanhua Talisman**
Bend the fourth finger of the left hand backward, hook it with the second finger behind the middle finger, and press the thumb against the second fingertip. To exit the flask, use the three seals—upper, middle, and lower—at will.

Carve three seals, each two *cun* and four *fen* wide, one *cun* and two *fen* thick, from *leipo* locust or mulberry wood for best effect.

**Xuan Seal**
Three *cun* and six *fen* square, one *cun* and five *fen* thick. Before performing any method, first imprint the altar space—spirits dare not disobey the command.

**Five Official Seals**
Wind Official Seal, *Qi* Official Seal, Water Official Seal, Fire Official Seal, Thunder Official Seal. Each seal is two *cun* wide and one *cun* thick, all carved from *leipo* locust wood.

Before performing any method, grind cinnabar with *yongquan* water, imprint the seal of the presiding official on yellow paper, and bind it with a bundle of spirit money. Burn them together as required by the method. For urgent matters, omit the paper and instead strike the teeth five times.

**General Talisman for Summoning the Twenty-Four Generals**
Use this talisman to summon one general; if the matter is pressing, two may be summoned.

**Altar Construction**
Within a secluded chamber, build a three-tiered altar of yellow earth. The base is seven *chi* wide, the middle five *chi*, and the top three *chi*, with a total height of three *chi*. Shape the earth to resemble mountain ridges, mirroring the terrain of grotto-heavens and empty chambers. Grind cinnabar with *yongquan* water and inscribe the designated symbols as shown in the diagram.

At the center lies the *Xuan Dong* Emperor Lord’s Circle, two *cun* and four *fen* wide, three *cun* and six *fen* deep. Place the *Yuan Ming Lu* talisman upright within it. After performing the empowerment, inscribe one *Wan Huang You Yu* Great General talisman and affix it to the chamber of the assembled generals. No one is permitted entry. The twenty-four generals are distributed across the twelve provinces.

**Correct Pronunciation of Incantations**
*Qin qin shan chan xuan yuan sui sun biao yan yun rui hui yi yi bi hua jue yi ji yuan yi yang.*
