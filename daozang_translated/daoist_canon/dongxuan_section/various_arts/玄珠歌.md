**The Song of the Mystic Pearl**
*Composed by Master Tongxuan*

To gather the Mystic Pearl is to dispel ten thousand evils,
At last attaining the Dao and entering the realm of purity and emptiness.
The Qian trigram reveals the true path of gold,
All contained within the three volumes of *Xiaoyao*.

Palaces and towers manifest the body of the Dao,
Yet clinging to life’s root cannot withstand the great furnace.
The primordial spirit scatters and flees, the withered courtyard remains—
Cast away the Mystic Pearl, and nothing remains.

The dust-laden heart fails to recognize the heaven within the body,
Vainly revering sacred forms in search of immortality.
The Mystic Pearl exists of itself, yet its place is unknown—
In what year will one return life to the cinnabar field?

Relying on cleverness to force right and wrong,
Even hearing the essential teachings, one still resists.
If one could but hold fast to the treasure of long life,
It would coalesce into the Mystic Pearl, piercing the Purple Tenuity.

Seeking idols of clay or painted images,
Reading scriptures in vain—how can the Dao be achieved?
The priceless treasure of the Mystic Pearl exists of itself—
When will one awaken to preserve the spirit’s essence?

Light and darkness share a single source, yet none perceive it;
If one could comprehend this, one would naturally attain the wondrous.
The Mystic Pearl is surely the master of contained radiance,
Forever abiding in the true palace, the moon’s luminous pool.

By the waterfall’s stream, compose the spirit’s mechanism,
Unlock the golden gate and seal the door of life.
To secure the Mystic Pearl within the spirit’s abode,
Where true unity walks, a single radiance shines.

If the primordial true essence scatters and cannot be borne,
Poisons accumulate and spread, harming the hundred spirits.
Only by exhausting the supreme treasure of the Mystic Pearl
Will one awaken from the drunkenness of life and death.

Within the sea of harmonious qi, the primordial essence is nurtured,
And within it, the Mystic Pearl perfects life.
Without refinement or coagulation, desires are cast away—
How can darkness suddenly be illuminated?

Mastering the spirit’s breath, the body conceals its treasure;
Deviating from the Dao, one loses the true.
If one encounters the Mystic Pearl and coalesces the middle path,
Transformation into the golden kerchief occurs naturally.

Worldly passions accumulate filth, defiling the gate of heaven—
How could one recognize the Mystic Pearl as the root of life?
At birth, do not let it drift away in wandering—
In that moment of clarity, one avoids confusion and delusion.

The Mystic Pearl stirs, shattering the demonic horde,
Illuminating the gate of life, distinguishing white from black.
After steadfast inner cultivation,
One achieves the Dao and recognizes the Lords of the Nine Heavens.

To gather the Mystic Pearl, sun and moon hasten;
First, the fire must arise to temper the spirit’s root.
After ten thousand passages of refining, the golden essence coalesces—
This is the foremost gate to ascending transcendence.

The Mystic Pearl ever dwells in the cavern chamber,
Where sun and moon merge into the vast emptiness.
The true jade ring follows the transformation of fluids,
Its unceasing radiance illuminating the spirit’s abode.

The Mystic Pearl and the jade tree have roots and sprouts,
By the water’s edge, touching the sky, they never wither.
The true fire, void yet like the red sun,
Coalesces the golden blossom, the tide of the six watches.

Early on, one must refine the essence of the great yang,
Consuming it, the primordial spirit never withers.
If one wishes the form to transcend and become golden bones,
The Mystic Pearl within holds the purest essence.

Freely drinking the moon’s luminous fluid,
It irrigates the spirit’s root, renewing virtue and Dao.
Retaining the treasure and shedding the dust, radiance does not scatter—
The Mystic Pearl illuminates the fivefold body.

Coming and going, entering and exiting, transformed into an infant,
Yet disorder in sequence invites calamity.
The Mystic Pearl exists in one place with all—
Through the master’s guidance, one abides on the cinnabar terrace.

The Mystic Pearl resounds like thunder,
Filling the central pool, transforming into eightfold jade.
From this, radiance pierces the heavens,
And the five-colored clouds carry one to Penglai.

With myriad intentions and countless affairs,
How can they compare to returning to the origin and inward contemplation?
Seizing the Mystic Pearl, one exchanges the bones—
The form transcends the azure vault, riding the golden phoenix.

In tranquility, day and night, never hastening,
Within, the Mystic Pearl opens a gate.
Sweeping away worldly toil, dividing sun and moon,
The supreme treasure enters Kunlun.

Through the master’s transmission of secrets, all contention ceases,
Drawing forth the Mystic Pass, a single path becomes clear.
The celestial music endures, its sound unbroken—
The Mystic Pearl is fulfilled, and the red dragon welcomes.

Examining the eightfold radiance,
One swallows the true fire, the body within burns.
The Mystic Pearl opens the granary of the Three Clarities,
Awaiting the day to ride the five-colored clouds together.

Failing to awaken to the true origin, one is startled and bewildered,
Following the heart’s desires, indulging the Three Corpses.
Where the Mystic Pearl arrives, nothing can defile it—
The treasure fills the jade pool, reaching the Upper Clarity.

Having attained the Mystic Pearl, contention ceases forever,
Without leaving the cinnabar origin, the treasure coalesces.
Through turning and refining, it becomes as clear as the moon,
Ever pure and luminous within the grain.

Losing the Mystic Pearl, it falls into ruins,
Wandering and drifting, mistakenly rolled and unrolled.
If the hun and po congeal like sun and moon,
The body unites with heaven and earth in purity and emptiness.

The Mystic Pearl coalesces the po in a single surge,
Sending it into the jade tower, the highest palace.
Like the moon’s light, able to emerge and submerge,
Naturally, one lightly ascends into the clouds.

Countless have practiced this art before,
Only to suddenly transcend the mortal form.
Thousands of immortals follow this method—
The Mystic Pearl illuminates the primal integrity of the One.

Through the master’s guidance, the sunlight follows,
Transforming the Mystic Pearl into feathered robes.
When merit is complete and the supreme Dao attained,
Before ascending the cloud path, none will know.

Freely composing to reveal the void,
Without leaving the field of the body, one points to the Dao’s form.
Internally divided into upper, middle, and lower,
Tracing the path, one fully attains the Mystic Pearl.
