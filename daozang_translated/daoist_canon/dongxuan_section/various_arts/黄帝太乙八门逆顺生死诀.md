**Divine Brightness Morning True Scattering and Binding Fetal Talisman**
Facing east toward one’s birth year, inscribe the talisman sixty times with a seal script. Use yellow wax twice-melted, cut into sixty pellets, and place on fine sand as a base.

Each morning, facing east, hold the talisman in your palm. Recite the incantation:

*"Godly Void, Heavenly True,
Royal Elixir, Primordial Essence.
Supreme Purity’s Refined Chamber,
Original Beginning’s True One,
Mystically Entering Crimson Mists,
Seven Dawns of Vermilion Splendor,
Northern Capital Receiving Smoke—
I am the Sovereign Above.
Dispel the Host of Demons,
Ten Thousand Times Purified of Filth.
No Malevolence Remains,
Ten Thousand Demonic Kings—
Guard my life, sever their forms!
Swiftly, as the Jade Purity’s Supreme Brightness Command!"*

After reciting, blow upon the talisman, place it in the mouth, and swallow while reciting:
*"Swallow the Divine Water, summon the White Tiger,
Dissolve the Binding—Imperial Incantation of Luo!"*
Silently repeat *"True Essence"* (真些).

**Black Child’s Crude Coin Medicine**
Ingredients:
-雄黄 (*Realgar*) – ½ *liang*
-雌黄 (*Orpiment*) – ½ *liang*

**Jade Maiden’s Shape-Shifting Array**
To seek a person’s appearance:
Bathe, purify with sincerity, burn incense, and inscribe this talisman.
Mix one *fen* of black ink with seven *fen* of date decoction, face north, and offer while praying. Recite:
*"[Incomprehensible phonetic syllables]—
Pronounce seven times, burn it.
Visualize the talisman’s form complete—
Sleep without removing clothes, gnashing teeth,
Imagine yourself until you reach the place where [the target] appears.
Greet and converse as if face-to-face, sharing tea.
After one or three steps, depart to meet them.
If the dream-visited figure is the intended one, the spell succeeds."*

---

**Gathering Form (Soul Summoning)**
When descending from bed, use these steps without turning back. After completing the array, recite the incantation:

*"Heaven’s Eight Gates descend to Earth’s winds,
The Wheel revolves, entering the ground.
Three auspicious, five inauspicious—
Depart as fate dictates.
Entering and exiting differ in timing."*

**Method of the Three Odds (#1):**
Engrave the talisman and seal for immediate effect—
Unleashing divine and spectral forces,
Averting the calamity of *yèjīng* (精泄, *lit.* "essence leakage"),
Ensuring all matters align with one’s will—
No failure shall occur.

If obtaining *lei pì* (雷霹, *lit.* "thunder-struck") *zǎo mù* (枣木, *Ziziphus jujuba* wood), one *cùn* (寸) square,
—if unavailable, write on paper with *chénshā* (辰砂, *cinnabar*), burn incense, and gnash teeth while inscribing.
Wear it yourself or have the target carry it—ideal.

**Day Odds, Month Odds.**

**Star Odds, Jade Maiden’s孤虚 *Method*:**
In the year *Zhēnguān* (貞觀) 2, in the eighth month, Li Jing (李靖) led an army of over forty thousand against the *Tūjué* (突厥). By the third watch of the night, the Nine-Heaven Xuan Yu (九天玄女) bestowed the *孤虚 Method* upon him. When this Method is employed, one strikes *孤* (孤, *lit.* "lonely") while avoiding *虚* (虚, *lit.* "void"), and a single maiden can rival ten men. Its efficacy spans the sixty *jiǎzǐ* (甲子, *lit.* "heavenly stems and earthly branches"). For military campaigns, chess, covert strategies, or gambling, striking *孤* while avoiding *虚* ensures victory in all endeavors—never a loss.

**Yellow Emperor’s Divine Talisman:**
On days of the *奇* (奇, *lit.* "odd") *zǐ* (子), inscribe the Three-Star Talisman on the inner left palm. On double-*奇* days, inscribe the Four-Star Talisman on the inner right palm. Pass it through incense smoke, and victory shall never falter.

For games of chance or gambling, one must sit according to the day’s *wàngqì* (旺氣, *lit.* "flourishing qi"). Victory is assured:
- On the **1st, 5th, 9th** days, the month’s flourishing qi lies in the **South**.
- On the **2nd, 6th, 10th** days, it lies in the **East**.
- On the **3rd, 7th, 11th** days, it lies in the **North**.
- On the **4th, 8th, 12th** days, it lies in the **West**.

Arrange incense lamps and five fruits for offerings. Take fifteen *kāitōng* (开通, *lit.* "unblocking") coins, place one before the incense, and keep the rest in a small vessel. Pass the vessel through incense smoke while reciting a prayer. For those who read, tie it with a blue silk cord; for those who cast, tie it with a black silk cord. Hold the coins with both hands and silently chant the incantation:

*"Heaven is tranquil, Earth is tranquil,
孤 is void, 虚 is void—
The Dao uplifts my will,
Following my will,
The spirit never departs from my left or right.
Swiftly, as the command decrees."*

**Divine Protection Against Five Calamities (Crowned by *Wǔwēi*’s Martial Virtue):**
Do not reveal this to unworthy men.

*Sūzhī Nán* (刘子南) received this from *Yín Gōng* (尹公):
- Ward off illness, epidemics, all diseases, tigers, wolves, and snake venom.
- Against blades, weapons, thieves, and all malevolent harm—none may draw near.

This repels all thieves, bandits, and calamities—weapons dissolve harmlessly.

**Transmission:**
*Qīngniú Dàoshì* (青牛道士) obtained this, passed it to *Huángfù Lóng* (皇甫隆), then to *Wèi Dì* (魏帝).
Ever since, armies using this have never failed in its efficacy.

---
**Wind-Dispelling Elixir (*Fēngyào Dúshèng Dān*):**
- *Cǎowū* (草乌), *Wúmíngyì* (无名异): equal parts
- *Dàndòu* (淡豆豉): equal parts
- *Rǔxiāng* (乳香): 2 qián
- *Mòyào* (没药): 2 qián

**Preparation:**
Grind into powder, mix with rice vinegar into pills the size of *wútóngzǐ* (梧桐子).
Coat with *zhūshā* (朱砂) and *shèxiāng* (麝香).
Take two pills with tea or wine.

---
**Flight Technique (*Fēizǒu Fǎ*):**
On *Gēngshēn* (庚申) or *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子) days, at the third watch of the night:
- Use seven sheets of gold paper (*jīnpǐ* 金纸),
- Burn one incense of *Jiàngzhēnxiāng* (降真香),
- Arrange seven *yùnhè* (云鹤) talismans in the *gāng* (罡) formation, facing north.
- Strike teeth 32 times, then arrange the paper cranes as the *Qixing* (七星).
- Hold a sword in the right hand, recite the incantation seven times, blowing onto each talisman.
- Only then release the talisman.

**Incantation:**
*"Tàiyáng huàn gǔ, sù fù wú shēn.
Lǎojūn wǔ qì, kě jì dìshén.
Yù néng fēibù, yún chèn bù tíng.
Jíjí rúlǜ lìng."*

「After reciting the incantation seven times, recite the *shè* (摄) syllable, gather breath from the *dǒu* (斗) constellation, swallow it, and follow the right method. Hold the previous incantation seven times at dawn or dusk, and on the fourteenth day of the month at a clear hour, invoke the talisman and incantation. The method shall respond accordingly.

With the sword incantation in the right hand, one may traverse a thousand *lǐ* (里).

**Divine Movement Powder (*Shénxíng Sǎn* 神行散) Recipe:**
*Zǐkuàng* (紫矿) [or *zǐshí* 紫石, likely Orpiment], *Mànduōluózi* (蔓陀罗子) [Indian Madder], *Wūzhuójiān* (乌啄尖) [Black Nightshade], *Bājiāo gēn* (芭蕉根) [Banana root], *Rǔxiāng* (乳香) [Frankincense], and *Mòyào* (没药) [Myrrh], each in equal parts.
Grind the above ingredients into fine powder, mix with fresh ginger juice to tonify the *pí* (脾) [Spleen], and apply to new *dàolǎo* (稻禳) [straw sandals] made from fresh rice straw. Walk thirty *lǐ* (里), then use the powder. Dissolve with water when crossing streams.

**Avoiding Food Elixir (*Bìgǔ Dān* 辟谷丹) Recipe:**
*Péimǔ* (贝母) [Fritillaria bulb], heart removed, and *sùzhēngbǐng* (宿蒸饼) [fermented flatbread], each ground into powder, in equal parts. Parch with fire and form into pills the size of *wútóngzǐ* (梧桐子).
Take thirty pills each dose, swallowed with cold water in the morning. Avoid hot foods, *língjiǔ* (玲酒) [strong wine], and intoxicating foods.

To cease avoiding food, consume a bowl of hot broth or wine. Then eat any food and take medicine as usual, but avoid *cǎowū* (草乌) [Lateral Cocklebur]. If taken, it will cause reversal [of effects].

**When Heavenly Retribution Strikes—Dragons and Serpents Rise from the Land (*Tiānfā Shājī Lóngshé Qǐlù* 天发杀机龙蛇起陆):**
Dragons and serpents, by nature, when encountering autumn and winter *yīnqì* (阴气) [yin-qi, cold/damp energy], shall withdraw into their dens;」

「Yet when encountering spring and summer *yángqì* (阳气) [yang-qi, warm/active energy], they shall emerge from their dens and rise. When Heaven’s retributive force (*shājī* 杀机) strikes, it cuts off *yīnxié* (阴邪) [yin-evil]. Thus, when dragons and serpents rise from the land, if a person can counter the Heavenly yin-magic with true yang, then the hundred spirits shall harmonize and flow, blood and vessels shall connect, the five viscera shall generate fluids, and longevity with clear vision shall follow.

**When Human Retribution Strikes—Heaven and Earth Reverse (*Rénfā Shājī Tiāndì Fǎnfù* 人发杀机天地返覆):**
Heaven is born from *Kàn* (坎) [the abyss], Earth from *Lí* (离) [the flame]. *Kàn* is water, moon, and mercury; *Lí* is fire, sun, and lead. The sage harmonizes the mysterious functions of *Kàn* and *Lí*, making the sun and moon intermingle, lead and mercury balance, and the Dragon and Tiger oppose each other. Only then can one sever and capture the wandering soul, subdue essence and suppress evil, preserving true *zhèngqì* (正气) [right qi]. Thus it is said: *When human retribution strikes, Heaven and Earth reverse.*

The True Person of *Tàibái* (太白) said:
*"When the Five Phases invert, the Dao-Dragon emerges wrapped in fire;
When the Five Phases are disordered, the Wandering Tiger is born from water."*
This is the mysterious function of Heaven and Earth, the principle of yin and yang reversing. The True Person concealed this in his secret writings.

First, burn incense and purify the hands before opening the scroll to read.

*Zhāng Qún* (张群), who compiled Daoist techniques, loved seclusion and cultivated for many years, seeking hidden secrets. One *dīngyè* (丁夜) [a night of the *dīng* stem-branch, i.e., the 4th night of the decan], at the second watch, he walked alone beneath the moon in his courtyard. Suddenly, in the southwest, a five-colored cloud arose, gradually ascending toward the sky’s center, its midst forming a formation. Before him appeared a woman, who said she was the daughter of *Tiāndīng Dīngchǒu* (天丁丁丑). Qún bowed respectfully.

The woman said: *"You have long yearned for the Dao. Knowing your purity, I transmit to you the marvelous gate of cultivation. Though you lack innate Dao-nature, if you fast and purify yourself for a hundred days, return, and I shall reveal the great method."*

Qún thus fasted for a hundred days, and at the second watch, a formation of clouds and troops from the southwest descended. From a case, he received the scripture—its form was narrow, requiring three carts to carry. The immortal woman said: *"Though you lack Dao-nature, three years of practice shall make you a *wánxiān* (顽仙) [Stubborn Immortal], with a lifespan of a thousand years. This text is not given lightly—only those with karmic ties to the Dao may encounter it.*

*If you practice the Hidden Form method, cultivate virtue. If you practice the Heroic method, act fiercely—let others provoke you, and evil shall not dare approach. In one year, you shall succeed. If you practice the method of Returning Essence as a Maiden, maintain a filial and compassionate heart. In one year, your endeavor shall be complete.*

*These three methods make one a Stubborn Immortal, with a thousand years of life."* Qún diligently cultivated them and transmitted the teachings to *Guǐgǔ Lǎoshī* (鬼谷先生). Within three years, he mastered myriad transformations. Later generations who hear of this are those with Dao-karma in their hearts.

*For those of inferior nature, even mastering Hidden Form is to be a one-year immortal. Those practicing the Heroic method must be loyal and filial, repaying kindness and justice, never deceiving others. To sever evil and return to the right, first know Hidden Form. In a pure chamber, sleep alone on a bed, avoiding others. With fragrant water, meditate on the Six Ding and Jade Maiden, performing the rites.*

*Later, each time the day and night align, sit on the bed, close your eyes, and visualize the bed as a seal. Face west as the head, embodying the Six Ding and Jade Maiden seal. Then visualize the seal at the east-north corner—*Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) Jade Maiden stands there, wielding a green snake-sword. Next, visualize the seal at the southwest corner—*Dīngwèi* (丁未) Jade Maiden wields a yellow-white snake-sword. Then visualize below—*Dīngyǒu* (丁酉) Jade Maiden stands at the left edge, left hand gripping a yellow sword, and recite softly one hundred and eighty times before returning to the seal’s edge. Next, *Dīnghài* (丁亥) Jade Maiden enters through the nostrils toward the heart—the nose is the human gate. Then, from the east-north corner, *Dīngmǎo* enters through the left ear into the heart—the ear is the wind gate. Next, from the south corner, *Dīngsì* (丁巳) enters through the right ear—the ghost gate. Then, from the southwest corner, *Dīngwèi* enters through the mouth into the heart—the mouth is the earthly door. Finally, from the northwest corner, *Dīngchǒu* (丁丑) enters through the eyes into the heart—the eyes are the heavenly gate.*

*After visualizing each, in all circumstances—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying—always hold the seal in your left hand, never letting it leave your side. If you must relieve yourself, remove the seal, wash your hands, and replace it. As previously stated, maintain meditation, recitation, and the seal’s imprint. The recipient of the seal divides it into three parts, mastering one recitation and meditation.*

*After receiving the seal, if you dream of ascending mountains or entering water, fighting and beheading others, or sitting beside a woman, do not be alarmed. This is the manifestation of the Jade Maiden descending to bestow vision through your recitation and meditation."*

**The Method of Seal-Crafting**

When crafting the seal, strike a *zǎo* tree with thunder, then submerge it in water to test—if it moves, it is true. On the *jiǎzǐ* day, carve it, then before the Jade Maiden, recite the spell one hundred times, and afterward wear it.

Next, holding it in your right hand over incense, recite the spell:
*"This is the seal of the Celestial Lady of the Nine Heavens, sent by the Six *Dīng* [Guardians]. Do not let outsiders see it—strictly forbidden."*

If performing rituals, always wear the seal; throughout life, you shall have no calamities, and wealth and profit shall be drawn to you.

**The Flying Talisman Method**
After meditating and wearing the seal, you must ingest the *Bā Lì* [Eight Officials] talisman.

For all talisman-writing:
Take the days *jiǎzǐ* or *jiǎchén*, hold your breath while writing, never pausing your hand. Use a new brush, fine cinnabar, and a clean dish—do not mix other substances.

While writing the talisman, visualize the Jade Maiden and recite the spell eighteen times before beginning.

Cut and affix it, one talisman per day, starting from *jiǎzǐ*, completing three *shǎo* days.

Then, according to method, craft another talisman and swallow it. The talisman’s seal follows below:

**One | Two**

**Three | Four | Five | Six | Seven | Eight | Nine | Ten | Eleven | Twelve | Thirteen | Fourteen | Fifteen | Sixteen | Seventeen | Eighteen | Nineteen | Twenty | Twenty-One | Twenty-Two | Twenty-Three | Twenty-Four | Twenty-Five | Twenty-Six | Twenty-Seven | Twenty-Eight | Twenty-Nine | Thirty**

**The Method for Forging the Sword**
Take fifteen *liǎng* of raw iron, place it in a clean vessel, and add six cups of wine. Before the Jade Maiden, declare:
*"Disciple [Name], practicing the Firm Saint’s Dao to safeguard life, prolong years, and enhance virtue, to sever evil and banish demons, now seeks to forge a divine sword. Burying it on a *liùjiǎ* day for one season, performing the ritual—all matters shall proceed as willed. Respectfully reported above."*

Dig a pit in the east, three *cùn* deep, and step through the *gāng* while reciting the *Liùdīng* spell. After ninety days, retrieve it and have a smith forge it on a *jiǎzǐ* morning before the Jade Maiden. On *Liùdīng* days, sharpen it with lion’s blood until razor-sharp.

Wherever injustice lingers, the sword grows—one *chǐ* two *cùn* long, mirroring the twelve months of the year.

**The Method for Burying Iron**
All who study the Dao must first forge a sword, wear the *Xuánnǚ* seal, meditate on spells, swallow talismans, and may then travel by night, flying ten thousand *lǐ*. Entering mountains or water, intent alone suffices—known as the *Fēngxiá Guǐgǔzi* (Wind Swordsman of Ghost Valley).

Regularly consume seal ash and recite the spell eighteen times. On *Liùdīng* nights, lie on the bed and visualize transformation. Thus, fire cannot burn you, water cannot drown you, and blades cannot harm you. Before each meditation, ingest thirty *Bā Lì* talismans.

After ten days, nightmares cease—this is success. On the fifteenth night at the *zǐ* hour, lie on the bed, hands dangling, pinch the second knuckle, close your eyes, and reveal your form.

First, visualize the bed as the seal’s corner, then your body as before. Afterward, imagine a sword—gradually increasing to ten, a hundred, a thousand—emanating from your feet, body, and hair, all becoming bronze blades.

Rise, sit, and pinch the small finger’s lower joint, visualizing wood emerging from the liver, filling heaven and earth. Then sit, recite the spell three hundred sixty times, and withdraw the wood into the liver at will.

On the sixth *Dīngmǎo* day, meditate and recite the spell.

On *Dīnghài* days at the *zǐ* hour, visualize the bed as the seal’s corner, hands dangling, pinch the third knuckle, and imagine water emerging from the kidneys, filling heaven and earth. Rise, sit, and recite the spell three hundred sixty times, withdrawing the water into the kidneys at will.

On *Liùdīng* days, meditate according to the Five Phases and Five Viscera—*"After this, five transformations."* Each meditation requires sixty days of practice, reciting the spell three hundred sixty times daily.

Henceforth, all movements—entering, exiting, or acting—occur through the mouth, eyes, ears, nostrils, pores, and every orifice, each brimming with blades, countless in number. Will them forth, and they appear.

Zhang Qún says: *"If practiced correctly, within three years, one shall attain mastery."* This is not to be passed to father or son.

All who study the sword must first wear the *Liùdīng* seal and recite the spell. Concealing the form, moving unseen—only at night—is called the *Guǐxiá* (Ghost Swordsman) spell.

**The Great Secret Program of the *Liùdīng* Spell**
*Jiǎzǐ* decade: *Yīnshén Dīngmǎo*, rabbit-headed, human-bodied, clad in black armor, roaming the world to question the Five Peaks, slaying demonic evils—none dare approach me.
*"Jade Maiden Wénbó, styled Rén Gāo, I now invoke you."*

*Liùdīng* breath—wind and thunder respond instantly.
*"As the law commands."*

*Jiǎxū* decade: *Yīnshén Dīngchǒu*, ox-headed, human-bodied, wearing yellow robes, bearing sword and staff, roaming the world to slay the Five Plague Ghosts.
*"Jade Maiden Wén Gōng, styled Rén Guì—evildoers who see me shall perish."*

*"Recite once at night, and longevity is granted."*
*"As the law commands."*

**The Great Secret Program of the *Liùdīng* Spell**

*Jiǎshēn* decade: *Yīnshén Dīnghài*, **rat-headed** (here: *guāi*—likely a typo or variant for *兔*—rabbit), human-bodied, clad in black armor, bearing sword and staff—**no malevolent spirit or demon dares resist me** when I roam the heavens and earth. The Six *Dīng* shall demand, and none shall dare oppose. The Six *Dīng* shall halt, and **a hundred spirits or a thousand demons shall be annihilated**. *"Jade Maiden Wéntōng, styled Rén Hé, now sustain my life and body—grant me peace and safety."*

*"As the law commands."*

*Jiǎwǔ* decade: *Yīnshén Dīngyǒu*, **chicken-headed** (here: *jī*—likely a typo or variant for *鸡*—chicken), human-bodied, clad in crimson armor, bearing sword and staff—**I shall extinguish the wicked**. Now I conceal Jade Maiden, styled **Tàihuá**, within my body, that she may **dispel matters of the external prefectures, counties, and officials**. *"As the law commands."*

*Jiǎchén* decade: *Yīnshén Dīngwèi*, **sheep-headed** (here: *yáng*—likely a typo or variant for *羊*—sheep), human-bodied, bearing spear and armor at my sides—**I shall slay gods and demolish temples**. *"Jade Maiden Rén Gōng, styled Shūtōng, grant my requests fulfillment.** If any wicked person confronts me, I shall **repeatedly strike their form**, and **let the winds and thunders sweep away the demons**. *"As the law commands."*

*Jiǎyín* decade: *Yīnshén Dīngjǐ*, **snake-headed** (here: *shé*—likely a typo or variant for *蛇*—snake), human-bodied, clad in purple **barbarian robes**, bearing sword and staff—**I shall overturn heaven and earth**. The **nine regions' ancestral halls** shall obey my command. *"Jade Maiden Rén Jìng, styled Shūqīng, stand at my sides. **As the law commands."*

*«Again, the incantation says: My body is one [Dao/Way], tranquil as Mount Tai. Cities and fortresses are unseen, sealed by the Golden Pass. Ten thousand calamities and myriad evils dare not approach. The Six Ding stand at my sides, the Six Jia guard my front and rear, protecting my person. As the law commands.*

*Study for one year before mastery may be achieved. If one desires to travel day and night, traverse ten thousand miles, ascend mountains and descend waters, to seek those who wrong others, and arrive at will—this is called the Wind Swordsman [Dao/Way]. The Six Jia Yinfu and Yinfu Six Dao are used in the same manner as the Yin-day rituals. The Dingmao Yinfu, Dingchou Yinfu, Dingyou Yinfu, Dinghai Yinfu, Dingwei Yinfu, and Dingsi Yinfu—when one passes through these [rituals], the official secrets shall be revealed. Acquire the four treasures of the Luoluo, and the floating river of Suduo. The Great Surge and Wood Extremity embrace the harmony of Yin and Yang. To emerge and not return, to be born and die again—ghosts and gods cannot fathom, transformations occur naturally. The Primordial Beginning blends with the Mysterious, the Supreme Mysterious within the Mysterious, the heavens bestow their gifts, the earthly abyss grants its depths. When recited thoroughly, chronic illnesses shall heal themselves.*

*Nurture the soul and refine the spirit—true Yang is complete. With fasting, ritual purity, and proper recitation, one may ascend to the Ten Thousand Immortal Realms. The supreme secret incantation brings boundless blessings. With the incantation at the heart, its transmission is most profound. The four treasures of Luoluo shall be surrendered to the Jade Purity of the Eastern Extremity. Exhale the qi in dense clouds, the myriad essences of transformation descend to guard my form—both body and spirit are wondrous. With transformations manifesting my body, I command the spirits to serve and govern all responses.*

*When the incantation is finished, depart the official rites. The Ritual of Body Purification: With both hands forming the Kan [☵] trigram, draw in the qi from the west-north. The Incantation for Purifying Heaven and Earth: Use the Chen [☳] trigram, drawing the Heavenly Ganges [qi]. The Ritual for Binding Evil: With the Dou [☶] trigram, draw in the west-north qi. The Supreme Augmentation of the Heavenly Emperor’s Communion with the Dao—uniting the Earthly Persuasion, the Celestial Wisdom, and the Swift-Opening Palaces—shall manifest. These methods are as before; they must be kept secret, not lightly divulged, nor transmitted recklessly, lest one incur the wrath of the Supreme True.*

*The Incantation to Subdue Ferocious and Poisonous Beasts: The Heavenly Gate presses down the Ghost Gate; fierce beasts flee outward. As the law commands. First, bind the Dou [☶] trigram with the right hand, then inscribe the symbol within the right palm, writing the names of the ferocious and poisonous beasts, encircling them with the Five Phases and Four Directions [trigram]. With the right hand’s ring finger pressed upon the Jia [卯] position, recite the incantation seven times. This subdues all malevolent, vengeful, and demonic spirits.*

*Next, place the Dou [☶] trigram horizontally upon the left palm and inscribe the symbol. The incantation says: The radiance of sun and moon, stars and constellations, illumines and scatters [evil]. All malevolent and wicked spirits from ten thousand miles away dare not rise. For those who practice this and enter dreams, seeking noble encounters or matters—first transform the spirit with the right hand holding a sword, standing at the Heavenly Gate. Inscribe the characters for Metal [金], Wood [木], Water [水], Fire [火], and Earth [土], then step back one pace and stand upon the Earth [土] character. Next, walk five paces to stand upon the Metal [金] character, sighing as you recite the incantation seven times. Heavenly Crystal Nine, Heavenly Crystal Nine, Earthly Broad River, Earthly Broad River. The Eight Thunderbolts strike and subdue, the Thunder Mother scatters with clarity. The Nine Purity [Dao/Way] is natural, the winds and thunders blend in chaos, the Thunder Master sinks deep. Call aloud to the Jade Maiden, summon the Immortals—ten thousand spirits and myriad saints swiftly come to the altar. As the law commands of the Supreme Heavenly Emperor.*

*When the incantation is finished, write five symbols, each to be affixed to the forehead. Distribute one symbol per person. Prepare the tally of wealth: one coin placed northward, the True Department below, the first being the Red-Headed Junior Marshal, the second to fifth being the rest. Later, use the year, month, day, and hour, recording the street and surname of the person involved, sealing as per the usual formula. Then declare: "At the current hour, I summon you to meet with [name] at [location] for [purpose]. Now at the third watch, I labor you to deliver a dream and report to [name]." If there is a reply in the dream, prepare another tally of wealth to labor you again. In dreams, come and go as directed; follow this strictly. As the law commands.*

*After completing the rituals of transformation and wealth, the Yellow Emperor’s Eight Gates of Life and Death [Dao/Way] are complete.* #1 Likely a typo: *"法佳"* should be *"佳法"*.»
