### **Preface (First Chapter)**
Those who seek the Dao and long life must first practice *qi*-absorption. Those who dwell in the worldly and pursue fame and profit—when fame is established, profit flourishes; when *qi* is cultivated, longevity extends. This is the noble man’s embrace of destiny, not the petty man’s vaunting of cunning.

When both civil and martial virtues are complete, one may become a loyal minister aiding the state. When essence and *qi* are both perfected, one becomes a true immortal’s heir.

The Master once said he did not know the root and origin of the Dao, so he asked Laozi and learned that the Dao is *qi*. If form and spirit are insufficient, one labors in vain. If the heart’s intent is biased, nothing will be attained. When the heart is upright, the spirit harmonizes; when the spirit harmonizes, the Dao’s *qi* is full.

### **Learning and Inquiry (Second Chapter)**
All who guard the wondrous Dao possess extraordinary forms, for it cannot be sought in haste. Without lifelong accumulation of virtue, one will not bear the marks of transcendence.

Some, though learned, act with reckless frivolity; others, though steadfast, remain pure and sincere. Do not judge by long eyebrows, inverted pupils, or red-and-white eyes differing from the face. Those with thirty-six to forty-two teeth, a black mole on the abdomen, a long tongue, hands that hang past the knees, ears level with the neck, or soles inscribed with lines reaching the heel—these bear the signs. Some have the *qian* and *kun* trigrams on their foreheads, or auspicious characters on their chests, with dignified and radiant bearing. Others, though their bodies and clothes are filthy, harbor purity within, their traces mingling with dust and grime. They cast no shadow before the sun, moon, or lamp.

They constantly bestow kindness upon others, digest food swiftly but excrete slowly, and their urine forms pearls from their pores. Their mouths are square, their necks angular like horns, or resembling the sun, moon, qilin, dragon, or tiger. Their jade pillows are sharp as rhinoceros horn. Such people easily attain the Dao.

The steadfast and truthful, who never retreat, all achieve transcendence—these are the true immortals of the world, their merit complete as they ascend with their dwellings into the heavens. Those of profound wisdom, who scorn wealth and revere the Dao, though lacking supernatural transformations, will ultimately be honored for their deep virtue. They await only the completion of their hidden merits to join the company of the enlightened.

Without these signs, one’s efforts are in vain, the mind deluded. Even with the diligence of drinking ice and eating cypress, they will sink among the lower ghosts.

I have sought among the various masters, and my heart aches for them. If I can awaken others, so they do not waver in their resolve, those with these signs will easily attain immortality, having reaped great benefits from the Dao over many lifetimes.

Those who now ardently yearn for the Dao and urgently seek the Mysterious Female (*xuanpin*) must widely practice kindness within the Daoist gate. Those who achieve these extraordinary signs and merits have cultivated diligently over lifetimes, and in this life, they attain liberation.

Those who delight in the Dao and earnestly cultivate life in this life are blessed by their accumulated practice.

### **Qi-Absorption (Third Chapter)**
The body depends on *qi*; *qi* arises from the body. Body and *qi* interdepend to form the physical self. The *hun* and *po* souls move within, descending and infusing to become spirit, giving rise to the five viscera.

*Qi* is the mother of blood; blood is the mother of essence; essence is the mother of spirit; spirit is the mother of form. There has never been a form that took shape without *qi*. *Qi* exists because of form, and the *hun* and *po* accompany it.

Spirit is the mother of *qi*. Embryonic breathing (*taixi*) is achieved by imagining an infant, thus attaining harmony. Harmony becomes primordial harmony (*yuanhe*). In the intervals of exhalation and inhalation, within the Three Primes (*sanyuan*) and even the hair’s pores, all is pervaded and permeated.

All is governed by the heart-monarch and the intent-minister, who regulate and restrain. Without engaging the heart in affairs, the ruler remains at peace. Anxiety and thought disrupt the principle of spontaneity.

The heart is the fierce fire of the ape, belonging to *si* and *wu*. The kidneys are the demeanor of the yin woman, the graceful root of *hai* and *zi*, where the Azure Dragon and White Tiger soar and crouch in their *qi*-generating power.

The heart’s fire becomes cloudy mist; the moon’s moisture becomes cloudy rain. Following the northern *kan*, they return to the *qi*-palace of the kidneys in *zi* and *hai*. The heart’s *qi* in *si* ascends to the Muddy Pellet Palace (*niwan gong*), descending to nourish the eight corpses and hundred joints. Even the hair responds completely, for there is no obstruction to the principle of primordial harmony, which cures a thousand illnesses and myriad diseases.

When the heart-monarch emits fire, it burns all under heaven without exception. Clearly, the five grains and five flavors, when practiced long, naturally diminish.

Initially, one may swallow thirty-six times, alternating dry and moist. Concentrate the heart’s *qi* and send it with intent to the *qi*-sea below the navel, flanked by the sun and moon. The left kidney is the sun; the right kidney is the moon. These two sides ascend together to merge as one.

First, visualize the right kidney as the moon, its white *qi* entering the *qi*-sea. From the right side of the spine, it rises to the Muddy Pellet Palace at the crown—three inches within the space between the eyebrows. Then, pass through the Cavern Chamber Palace (*dongfang gong*), proceed through the Hall of Light Palace (*mingtang gong*), and guard the inch-wide double field below. Traverse the Twelve-Storied Tower (*shi’er chonglou*), pass through the Crimson Palace (*jiang gong*), and enter the golden chamber of the *qi*-sea, where the sun and moon illuminate both sides.

Next, visualize the left kidney as the sun, its yellow *qi* ascending along the left side of the spine through the bone seams, directly entering the Muddy Pellet Palace. Proceed through the Cavern Chamber Palace, the Hall of Light Palace, guard the inch-wide double field below, traverse the Twelve-Storied Tower, pass through the Crimson Palace, and enter the center of the *qi*-sea, where the sun and moon shine on both sides.

Then, visualize the white *qi* as the core and the yellow *qi* as the outer layer, forming a round pearl. Yellow outside, white inside, it hangs in the *qi*-sea, radiant as an orange, round as a pellet. With long practice, its light rivals the sun and moon...

Here is the translation:

---

This is the Mysterious Pearl, the Mysterious Female within the Kidney Palace—thus is the pearl. It is also called the union of two things into one, formed by one yin and one yang. Both are yellow on the outside, with the yellow as the outer layer and the white as the core.

The Crimson Waters are the blood. When the Mysterious Pearl is formed, the fluids and blood naturally fill. If you wish to verify this, mix bitter wine with the essence-dew; after one night, it will return to blood. After nine years of practice, the sinews and bones transform, and one becomes light enough to ascend as an earthly immortal.

Before refining the great elixir, one must first complete the cultivation of *qi*, relying on *qi* to replenish the body’s essence. Only then will the great elixir begin to take effect. Beginners in *qi*-absorption must not immediately seek the Mysterious Pearl. First, for three years, eat bland foods—do not yet cut off grains entirely. Lustful desires must be completely severed; otherwise, one will instead shorten one’s lifespan.

At the fifth watch, swallow thirty-six mouthfuls, linking the fluids and *qi*. Gradually reduce food intake, eating only bland foods and avoiding salt, vinegar, and extremes of cold or heat. Eat a full meal at midday, but little in the morning and evening. After three years of this morning and evening practice, one will gradually find bland foods flavorful. Do not abruptly cut off grains entirely, for this will cause great harm.

When bland foods begin to taste good and worldly flavors are no longer craved, the five viscera will become firm and strong. If the five viscera are weak, use medicines to replenish and strengthen them—this is why bland foods become flavorful. After this, one may gradually eliminate the five flavors and five grains. For three days, eat bland congee, vegetable broth, sesame leaves and stems, wolfberry, Solomon’s seal, jujubes, and the like to aid the process, before finally cutting off grains. One should feel naturally satiated, without hunger or thirst. If suddenly exposed to the steam and scent of cooked grains, after long practice, one will naturally know to avoid them.

After three or seven days of hunger and fatigue, eat cold bland noodles or leaf-wrapped dumplings. When hunger or thirst arises, visualize the *qi* within the center, and at any time—morning or evening—swallow it according to the previous method. This will substitute for food and bring satiety, just like eating. If one later wishes to eat, taro, yams, or *Polygonatum* may be consumed, along with a little tea. But if salt is added, hunger will immediately return.

The five flavors are the five thieves, also called the five poisons: salt, vinegar, water, fermented beans, and pungent foods. At this stage, one may consume fine wine, pepper-yellow pills, glutinous rice, and raw pepper. Glutinous rice nourishes the stomach’s *qi*, while pepper guides *qi* back to the lower origin. Blandly cooked fermented grains, taro, winter melon, yams, and scallion broth may also be eaten, but all must be cooled before consumption. Wine aids *qi*, and fermented grain broths help guide the original *qi* to completion more easily. After drinking, *qi* flows more smoothly. One need not drink much—vomiting from drunkenness will cause harm. An occasional cup will stave off hunger and substitute for food. Wine washes away yin impurities, and those who attain the Dao never dislike it. Wine refines the true and nourishes *qi*; one need not drink ginseng broth, for it stimulates the appetite and thus causes hunger.

Wolfberry and jujubes are highly beneficial. Melons and peaches aid *qi*, and oranges may be eaten, but avoid their peels, as they induce hunger. Chestnuts, peaches, fox nuts, lotus roots, and water caltrops may also be consumed in moderation, but cold foods can disrupt *qi*.

With time, the spirit and essence will flourish. One will no longer feel weary at night, and the eyes will emit divine light like lightning. In darkness, one will see as if in daylight—these are the signs. One must urgently guard and seal the essence and marrow, for the Dao is about to be achieved. If, at this moment, one fails to guard it and instead indulges in lust, death will follow.

When the divine light and spirit manifest, the spirit is about to scatter from the body. If the light departs, so too will the spirit. Therefore, one must urgently guard the essence, seclude oneself, and subdue the impulses. This is the sign of the divine light appearing, the yang spirit flourishing, and the yin impurities nearing exhaustion. If one cannot urgently guard it and merely endures hunger and abstains from flavors, one does not enter the rank of divine immortals.

If one cannot yet sever desires, one must regulate and moderate bedroom activities, practicing emission without leakage. Once essence and marrow are lost, they become permanent tears and leaks. Such a person is not a true adept but a muddled, essence-leaking fool.

Bedroom matters are difficult to control and often reverse spiritual progress and wisdom. One must rely on worldly flavors to pass the days, using meat and grains to sustain oneself; otherwise, one will swiftly sink into the realm of ghosts. If one masters the principles of control in the bedroom and deeply understands its subtleties, one will grasp the ultimate truth. When encountering a young maiden, one may absorb and refine her essence, swallowing it. This is like a tiger growing horns—both civil and martial virtues are complete. Such practices are reserved for those of great fortune and virtue, not for ordinary people.

When essence loses its proper place, it is like the sea drying up and mountains collapsing—hundreds of streams lose their course, and a thousand lands fall into ruin. No remedy can restore it. A hundred illnesses converge, and karmic ghosts draw near. To re-cultivate after such loss is nearly impossible; not one in a thousand succeeds.

If one cultivates the previous *qi* practices with a calm heart and severs desires, one will imagine that no illness can invade, and plagues or pestilential toxins cannot harm. If the brain’s marrow is depleted, pestilence will enter from the crown. If the brain is full and essence abundant, ghosts and spirits cannot cause harm.

For any illness, rise early and regulate the *qi* to dispel it. Circulate the *qi* to penetrate the five viscera and six bowels, expelling it through the hundred joints and hair follicles until one feels a sticky sweat like glue—this is the sign of efficacy. If the illness does not recede, continue regulating the *qi*, visualizing the hundred spirits within and outside the body, swallowing and sealing. One may also lie wrapped in bedding within a canopy, practicing *qi*-absorption as before.

For wind, *qi*, miasma, consumption, poison, or any illness, use the previous method to drive it out from the sinews, bones, and marrow. The efficacy of this surpasses that of ten thousand medicines. Of the 202 illnesses, those caused by heat are called wind, and those caused by cold are called *qi*. This method can cure them all—hence the saying, "the four hundred and four illnesses."

---

The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: Immortals and Daoist adepts are not divine by nature—they accumulate essence and amass *qi* to congeal the True. They do not first rely on great medicines to achieve this. Since ancient times, those who attained the Dao—such as the sages of Jambudvīpa and the Wind Sovereign, the Seven Primes and the Three Elders—all preserved their True Nature through *qi*, not by first relying on great medicines.

All those who attained the Dao—divine immortals, sages, and superior adepts—initially achieved realization through *qi*. There is no other path to transcend the Three Realms. Soaring through clouds and mist, their spirits transform and penetrate, roaming above the sun and moon within the Yang realms, observing the Three Isles and Ten Continents, the water palaces and the caverns of Mount Yin. They ride cranes and mount dragons, float upon fish and stride upon turtles, feast on bees and cast cups through walls, plant flowers that take root in pillars, and dispatch talismans into beams—all through the agency of *qi*.

In a single day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred cycles of breath, with *qi* entering and exiting. Twenty-seven thousand *qi* correspond to one spirit, and each can be directed at will. Thus, once *qi* is mastered, one transforms cold and heat within a single breath, perceives the Six Directions within a hair’s breadth, and can blow against the sea’s waters to reverse their flow for a thousand *li*—all by ascending from the mundane to the divine.

For those beginning to practice *qi*-absorption, first still the hairs within the nostrils, for the nostrils are the passageways that thoroughly connect the five viscera and six bowels, the channels of breath’s ingress and egress. Gently inhale through the nose, swallowing the pure *qi*, and exhale the turbid *qi* through the mouth—ever so softly. For all heat-induced illnesses, open the mouth wide and exhale with a *he* to purge; the Six Breaths need not be employed. For cold-induced illnesses, exhale with a *chui* to supplement, thereby regulating the upper burner’s afflictions. The *qi* should flow subtly, allowing the body to seek its own harmony.

There are two stages: the upper stage, from the heart’s primordial *qi*, and the lower stage, from the lower elixir field, together forming the "two stages." The upper stage governs the regulation of illnesses in the upper burner, while the lower stage involves absorbing the *qi* within the heart. When practicing *qi*-absorption and regulation through swallowing, use the internal *qi*—this is called the Inner Elixir. The *qi* of the heart’s intent should be maintained continuously, without drawing upon the external *qi* of the upper stage, for external wind harms the five viscera. Thus, the two stages are divided for regulation. Without this division, the Mystic Pearl and the Crimson Waters remain unknowable.

For those who have practiced *qi*-absorption under a master, the *qi* becomes familiar and flows easily. For those without a master, the *qi* is raw and difficult to absorb. With prolonged practice, even those who violate the precepts will come to understand through self-realization.

**Fourth Parable: The Dao as an Ocean**
The Dao is like the vast and boundless sea, its depths no different from its storm-tossed waves. Without having ventured forth oneself, traversed its perils, and endured its dangers, how can one truly know it? The common folk hear of it and are bewildered, unable to grasp its wonders, seeking the extraordinary in vain. Only by plunging into its whale-waves can one come to know it fully.

This is like one who has journeyed through the secluded and perilous states of You, Qing, Hua, and Wei, and then travels again—passing through customs barriers, ferries, villages, monasteries, Daoist abodes, sacred altars, spirit temples, grotto-heavens, and famous mountains—knowing them all intimately. One proceeds directly without obstruction, arriving wherever the will directs. This is called "having journeyed before," for familiarity makes it easy.

Those who practice internal *qi*-absorption are likewise. Without having traversed the path themselves, if they wish to reach the destination, how can they arrive without guidance? Even with no one to point the way, through diligent inquiry and unwavering resolve, they too will reach the destination—though with greater toil and delay. The immortal caverns are profound and secluded; only with steadfast resolve can one enter. Those who waver in faith and wisdom, never having journeyed, do not follow the direct path—thus the difficulty of cultivation.

When the *qi* is fully matured, one may freely bestow blessings with humility, or abstain from food for years, or eat thrice daily, or fast entirely, or take one meal every three days, or subsist on a single daily congee. Through such hunger and thirst, the five viscera are tamed and harmonized—this is the sign of *qi*’s maturity.

Herbs and minerals—such as talismanic water, purple ganoderma, southern bamboo, Solomon’s seal, white vitex, pine resin, cypress, poria, atractylodes, white atractylodes, wolfberry, *he shou wu*, golden cherry, fox nut, wax, calomel, cinnabar, frankincense, gleditsia seeds, black soybeans, and white storax—are all suitable for consumption.

Though one may ingest these medicines, without absorbing the harmonious primordial *qi*, fasting and abstinence will wither the intestines, parch the blood vessels, and dry the meridians. Hoping for spontaneous longevity is futile; it is better to rely solely on the primordial *qi*, freely abstaining or eating as one wishes. This is the fruition of *qi*.

When the *qi*’s work is complete, the sinews and bones become supple, the hundred joints flow smoothly, the fetal fluid daily increases, the blood vessels grow robust, and the hands and feet can coil atop the head. One can form a pellet with a single exhalation, expelling it like a ball. Some become purely sinew without bone, their essence solid and blood abundant—thus it is. Hair and body hair are entirely renewed.

Have you not heard the *Daodejing* say: "None in the world can know or practice it"? Even sages like Confucius, Boyi, Shuqi, Bigan, and Qu Yuan could not comprehend it—how much less the common folk, entangled in worldly affairs? Truly, it is difficult to know.

Alas! Indulging in greed, extravagance, and lust, one declines into decay—teeth wither, hair whitens, and old age overtakes them. They willingly scatter their form and soul, burying themselves in desolate earth. Reborn as infants, oxen, horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, dogs, fish, or insects, they torment their own form and soul. Those with greater karmic force drift through the currents of love and enmity, while those with lesser force become mosquitoes or maggots. The power of the Great Dao eludes them, for they know not this principle.

How could they know that the Dao is like the ocean, its responsive power shaping mountains and rivers? Fish, dragons, and serpents all stir clouds and spread rain, their might astonishing.

Thus, the Great Dao embraces the subtle and penetrates the minute, as deep and unfathomable as the ocean’s abyss—none can fathom or seek it. Therefore, the *Yin Fu Jing* states: "Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, and all things—fruits, grasses, insects, fish, mosquitoes, maggots, mole-crickets, and ants—all contain the qi of the Dao." The Dao resides within them, as fish dwell in water; the fish know not that water nourishes their form, just as the Dao abides in humanity, like the wind whose form cannot be seen. Thus, the *Huangting Jing* says: "The tortoise draws qi to its spiritual root." This speaks of the tortoise’s attainment of qi, granting it long years without death. The snake, hibernating with a stone in its mouth without eating, transforms the stone into snake-yellow, a testament to the efficacy of qi. The phoenix and crane, mastering the subtleties of qi, roam the immortal grottoes of the Three Isles and Ten Continents; great immortals ride upon them—such is the marvel of their attainment of qi. The clam, embracing the autumn moonlight, forms a pearl; the macaque, learning dhyāna, enters samādhi; the white deer, skilled in stretching its joints, lives nine thousand years. Only humans, unaware of the arts of *daoyin*, fail to attain immortality.

The soft-shelled turtle, in winter, absorbs qi within the sand; the glow-fish burrows into dry earth; the silver carp feeds on water’s foam; the carp transforms into a dragon, summoning clouds and spreading rain. Yet humans, dwelling in the world, neglect the cultivation of the Dao and seek life outside themselves—how can they ever regain a human form? Alas! How sorrowful! Thus, the scriptures say: "As if present, as if absent." When the Dao is present, one attains it; when it is lost, one forfeits it. Know this: humans who lose the Dao perish, just as fish who lose water die.

Alas! Worldly people enter the mountains to seek the Dao, like climbing a tree to catch fish. They traverse great distances to find a master, like praying for rain in a drought. Thus, the *Yin Fu Jing* states: "Thrice returning by day and night, one’s efforts surpass ten thousandfold." All things can steal from humans, and humans can steal from all things. Yet with an empty mind and a full abdomen, the qi of the Dao comes of itself; spreading virtue and bestowing merit, timely sweet rains descend.

As for the thieves of the Dao: all who consume the five grains grown from the earth—whose essence is of soil—will ultimately harm themselves, buried by the very earth. But those who feed on the primordial harmony of yin and yang’s qi, forsaking finite things, dwell eternally in the celestial kitchen. Thus, heaven cannot kill them, earth cannot bury them; my life is in my own hands, not in heaven or earth. Therefore, the Metal Mother said: "The Three Passes determine life and death." How does the qi of the Dao compare to the moon’s reflection in the toad’s shadow? Every household radiates purity and brightness, ascending in their dwellings to the heavens; every person is imbued with the qi of the Dao. When saliva fills the mouth and is swallowed, it becomes *qiongye*—the sustenance of immortals.

After one year of cultivation, the viscera are whole; after two years, the ailing body is healed; after three years, the blood and vessels are firm; after four years, the sinews and bones are refined; after five years, the eyes become bright; after six years, life is prolonged; after seven years, the marrow becomes like silk; after eight years, one becomes an earth immortal; after nine years, the hair turns black as dark jade. After nine years of cultivation, one can lightly ascend a hundred or ten *zhang* high, freely roaming the famous mountains and grottoes, unobstructed and unhindered. Weapons and armies cannot harm them; water and fire cannot afflict them; ghosts and spirits cannot disturb them. Dragons submit of themselves, tigers yield of themselves; spiritual powers are at their command—this is called a *zhenren*. Further cultivating the methods of ascension, chanting the mysteries of the grottoes, one soars to the yang realms and rests, wandering above the sun and moon—this is called a celestial immortal. Some govern immortal grottoes, some oversee the registers of immortals, some manage the records of cultivators, promoting them in due order, much like official ranks in the human world, each with its own duties. Those who do not cultivate the arts of ascension may retreat into grottoes, becoming earth immortals for eternity, their merit and fruition complete.

All who engage in cultivation must accumulate hidden merits, amassing three thousand; when their virtuous works are fulfilled, the Jade Emperor will naturally summon them to the Mystic Capital to receive their office. If one does not cultivate hidden merits, their name will not ascend to the Mystic Capital. Though their name may be recorded among those who cultivate the Dao, without a ledger of hidden merits, the celestial decree will not promote them for lack of accomplishment.

Thus, in cultivating the supreme methods, hidden merits come first; only then can one deliver others while perfecting one’s own merit. From ancient times, all who attained the Dao followed this path. The Dao is united by faith; virtue is preceded by wisdom. My Dao is like the sea—it is called the Dao-Sea. Without faith, without cultivation, I have spoken all. Those of shallow wisdom and meager virtue must not lightly divulge these teachings. Only after ancestral transgressions are expiated, obstacles removed, and the master’s transmission received—pledging with gold, swearing before the Ten Heavens, fasting, bathing, bowing, and kowtowing—may the teachings be imparted.

Fools amass wealth by the thousands, hoarding hundreds of herbs and minerals, yet their remedies have little healing power and no effect in prolonging life. To learn the arts of immortality, one must rely on qi techniques: visualize the left canine as the Golden Bell, the right as the Jade Chime, and the upper and lower front teeth as the Jade Tablets. These are also called the Celestial Drum. Gather the spirit, initiate the petition, and submit the memorial to beseech the removal of calamities, disasters, and malevolent spirits. Strike the Celestial Drum thirty-six times; dispatch talismans to slay demons, reverse misfortune, and dispel disasters. Strike the Golden Bell twenty-four times; administer elixirs and consume medicinal foods, striking the Jade Chime twelve times.

**Dark Inscription, Fifth Scroll**
To cultivate the Dao and nourish the sacred embryo is the Way of long life and enduring vision—all possess it. Yet few are those who aspire to it. The sacred embryo is embryonic breathing. Envision the infant, the newborn—this is the Way of immortality and deathlessness. Whether present or absent, do not cling to either. Those who have faith in the qi of the Dao spare neither body nor life, steadfast in their resolve to learn the Dao. Only by deeply exploring the mysteries can one grasp the ultimate truth—then, whether present or absent, one does not cling. Cultivating the qi of the Dao, its currents flow unimpeded; the profound subtleties are the goal. Fear not death, and one will attain it.

The *Niwan* connects the hundred joints—the *Niwan* is three *cun* inward from the space between the eyebrows.

Within lies a path that enters, connecting to the crown at the back and the spine, extending through the bones of the feet, entering the *Qi Sea*, and exiting through the great and small *Li Gates*—its effect akin to the clarity of *ghṛta*. The *Danque* pulse embodies the Three Powers.

The *Danque* resides in the Central Palace, where the heart governs the cinnabar—its color is crimson. The Crimson Palace is ruled by the Heart Lord, who oversees the hundred cities and thousand states, all governed by the Heart Lord, with blood and pulse in harmony. The pulse is the regulation, harmony, and purity of cultivation. The Three Powers are the Three Burners: the Upper Burner corresponds to Heaven, the Middle Burner to Humanity, and the Lower Burner to Earth—modeled after the primordial harmonizing *qi*.

If one calculates in three cycles, unaware that the mysterious Dao is *qi*, one cannot fathom the distance or the breadth of the journey, and may fear never encountering it. Yet with steadfast resolve, one ventures forth as if exploring the depths of learning. Upon return, seven days have passed. The art of exploring to attain *qi* is so wondrous that it cannot be confined to the self, nor to others—thus, the return is swift.

Seeking the *Mysterious Pearl* in the vast sea: as previously explained, it is like searching for a pearl within the ocean—if one has sought it before, then nothing will be left unobtained. But if one merely thinks of it without ever seeking, it remains as distant as the boundless sea. The path of *Red Water* lacks a guide. *Red Water* is blood. Even if the *Mysterious Pearl* is attained, without the fluid of blood, there is no guiding path.

Within the embrace of good and evil blooms the art of long life: if cultivated with goodness, it is easily attained. Evil is the failure to grasp the profound mystery. When cultivation reaches the *Qi Sea*, the radiance of life shines within—like the brilliance of a blossoming shadow.

Urging from both flanks: focus the pure *qi* of *huixiang* along the spine, its movement pressing from both sides—*cui* means urgency. Thus is the *Mysterious Pearl* formed, as explained in the previous chapter. Within it, there is nothing—*qi* resides there, yet nothing exists. When the *qi* of the Dao is perfected, the mind reaches the state of no-mind, and in movement or stillness, one aligns with the principle of non-action, returning to the realm of spontaneity.

Scratching the head upon the Jade Terrace: the head is the crown, *sao* means movement, the manner of departure. The Jade Terrace and Jasper Chamber are the palaces of the sun and moon—this is the府 of the Three Hun of the Yang realm, the abode where the human spirit resides.

**Record of the Pine Sand, Sixth Chapter**
Since I began cultivating the Dao, I have come to understand that *qi* arts come first, and hidden merit is paramount. Recently, I obtained the *Spiritual Sword* and dispelled the toxins of demonic serpents and *shen* that harmed the people. Above the deep pool, I cast an iron cauldron to seal the *shen*’s lair. At night, I commanded spirits to forge two iron pillars—one secretly placed in *Yuzhang*, the other in the south. Another was erected on the Western Ridge, fearing the *shen* might surge forth and drown the people, so I placed a pillar on the western mountain, before the twin peaks to the east.

I slew a great serpent at the border of *Xiping* and *Jianchang*, and its offspring emerged from its belly, fleeing into the sea. I pursued it with the flying spirit-sword, but as this serpent-child bore no fault, the divine sword did not slay it. My disciple Wu Meng said: "This serpent-child will, in five hundred years, resume its harm to the people. You should mark this with a pine altar—when the pine branches droop low over the altar, brushing the ground, it will have been five hundred years. I shall descend to observe, and if it harms the people below, even my spirit-sword will be unable to slay it."

Now, in the lands of *Yuwei* and the Five Mounds, eight hundred have already departed in succession, all attaining the Dao here and achieving earthly immortality. In time, worthy successors will arise to subdue it. Wu Meng asked: "What shall we use as a marker?" I replied: "In the center of the great river of *Yuzhang*, a sandbar will suddenly emerge, gradually extending downstream until it covers the *Shakou* inlet, facing *Longsha*—that will be the sign."

As each cultivates the Dao and succeeds in turn, they ascend to the Golden Gates. Those who become masters of grotto-heavens and famous mountains will emerge from the land of *Yuzhang*, greatly propagating my teachings. I have composed *Fifty Scrolls of Qi Arts and Medical Sayings of the Commandery*, which will circulate in the world—do not worry, my disciple.

My disciple returned the sword after slaying the stone beast of *Nanhu*: the flying sword entered the beast’s eye, and though it exhaled clouds of vapor, the sword only struck its face, sparing the eye. Since the beast bore no fault, the sword did not slay it. Thus, the sword was sheathed and returned. For this merit, I am called *Lingjianzi*, and I transmit this to those who later attain immortality.

In the western city of the *Yuzhang* River, I sought the former traces of Lady Wei and Master Hong, entering the mansion to retrieve golden coins and elixir medicines. I again emphasized the *qi* arts and hidden merit. For those who study the Dao, first widely cultivate hidden virtue, then practice *qi* refinement, holding to the method of inner elixir for long life and enduring vision—this has been explained in the previous chapter and need not be repeated. Only after the *qi* is perfected does one proceed to refine the great medicine.

Of the ten who attained the Dao and ascended, and those who achieved liberation through *shijie*, all placed hidden merit first: relieving the poor, rescuing the distressed, secretly bestowing kindness, aiding the hungry and cold, and employing all manner of expedient means to accumulate the full three thousand merits. Then, the *Siming* and *Silü* will report to the Supreme Mystery, and the great medicine may be cultivated.

**Sincerity of the Dao, Seventh Chapter**
The Dao takes purity and stillness as its foundation, and virtue takes hidden merit as its priority. Sever desires at their root to achieve it. Abstain from grains and flavors to fill the belly—when the belly is full and unobstructed, it is easily traversed, and thus truly full. A clear and empty heart and belly are the constant of the Dao.

For those beginning cultivation: the eyes do not gaze upon sensual desires, the ears do not listen to mournful sounds, the mouth does not consume rich flavors, the nose does not seek exotic fragrances, and the body does not touch filth—these are all detested by the highest immortals. This is called the sealing of the six senses. If one can adhere to sincerity and sever these, one becomes a great immortal.

For those newly embarking on the path, do not abruptly cut off all things—simply adopt a bland diet. Gradually reduce worldly foods and affairs, and likewise diminish worldly engagements.

Those who awaken to the truth may stir alarm among the masses, inviting misfortune and peril, their bodies consigned beneath the Great Yin, their bones piled like mounds—this is the calamity of learning the Dao, where punishment extinguishes the self. Feign madness, feign folly, alter one’s garments, and outwardly embrace filth and grime. Thus does one blend with the world, purify its turbid yin dregs, preserve the vital essence, and profoundly grasp the subtle mysteries. When the qi of the Dao is perfected, transmit it to later disciples according to the proper method. For each person initiated, the master’s qi cultivation is extended by one year. If one disciple in turn initiates another, the master’s merit accumulates for two years. Should two fail to follow this method, the master’s qi cultivation is diminished by three years. When three attain realization, the qi of the Dao is perfected. Transmitting these principles augments the master’s tranquil merit. Should one wish to widely transmit and initiate others, first observe the conduct of the candidate: whether their heart holds compassion, their speech extols the Dao and virtue, whether they honor kin near and far, uphold fidelity and loyalty, embody benevolence, harmony, propriety, and humility, possess wisdom, brilliance, extraordinary insight, and profound vision. Only those who meet these standards may be entrusted with the essential teachings and accepted as disciples. To transmit to those unworthy diminishes the master’s lifespan and forfeits their merit. Those who harbor compassion, reverence for the Dao, and a heart of devotion may share in the company of perfected beings. Should one receive these teachings yet fail to practice them, entangled in worldly affairs, they may present this text beneath the sun and moon, under the clear light of the stars, offering incense, lamps, fresh fruit, fine flowers, and good wine. With sincere prayer, they may say: *"I have received this wondrous method but have not yet practiced it. I beseech that my master’s qi cultivation not be diminished, and entrust this plea to the scrutiny of the Mysterious Heavens."* Thus, the master’s qi cultivation will remain unharmed. Should one neglect this ritual and fail to invoke the stars, unforeseen illness and misfortune may strike. If such afflictions arise and medicine proves ineffective, one must appeal to the Upper Heavens, rectify the qi of the Dao, and resume practice to dispel them, whereupon divine efficacy will manifest. Do not rely on medicine to force a cure, lest one sink into the dark realms. Only the qi of the Dao is trustworthy; how can one rely on ghosts and spirits?

As for imbalances of hunger and satiety, fatigue and ease, cold and heat, dampness and wind, vomiting from wine, intoxication, sexual excess, prolonged standing or walking, sitting or lying, excessive speech, laughter, sorrow, joy, weeping, or elation—all diminish qi cultivation. These are recorded in various texts, and I shall not repeat them here.

This text long accompanied the immortal chariot in the celestial palace and was never transmitted to the mortal realm. It was only when Wu Meng and the maiden Cai Luan, who held the register of my drowning in the sea, visited my former immortal abode during the Mid-Autumn festival that they witnessed the spectacle: men and women joining hands, singing in harmonious melodies, entering the marvelous scene. They sang of the divide between immortals and mortals, their voices joyous and clear. Suddenly, they beheld Wenxiao, whose words flowed with unobstructed elegance, swift and keen. The two harbored mutual admiration, their verses intertwining as if bound by past karma. After the song, they lit candles and were led to the immortal dwelling, where the night resounded with the harmony of zither and lute. At dawn, an immortal youth arrived bearing a celestial ledger. Wenxiao inquired, and was told that revealing heavenly secrets had incurred the Jade Emperor’s punishment: she was to be demoted to a mortal wife for twelve years. Fearing Wenxiao might abandon the cultivation of Dao qi, this teaching was bestowed upon her. After twelve years of practice, her Dao qi was perfected, and she ascended to the Mysterious Capital.

**Chapter Eight: Dao Yin Postures**

For those practicing fetal breathing and qi absorption, Dao Yin is paramount. It loosens the sinews and bones, regulates the blood and vessels, guides qi to its fullest, and allows its presence to be felt after extreme exertion. Rub the hands and feet, assume postures of yielding and grasping, stretch and flex, and let qi circulate freely. All illnesses will dissipate, and ailments will heal. The five viscera and six bowels will harmonize with the spirit, their qi flowing effortlessly, and the Dao qi will be perfected. Direct it to the Niwan Palace atop the head or downward to the Yongquan points beneath the feet. With prolonged practice, natural mastery will follow. The hun and po spirits will flourish, essence and marrow will solidify. Those who practice this method will all become immortals.

The five viscera have corresponding postures to replenish their primal qi according to the seasons. In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, apply them with focused intent. Even Laozi cultivated the Dao in this manner. How could the multitude of sages not have transmitted these methods in haste? The ancient texts contain many fine passages; here, I present sixteen postures.

**Three Postures to Nourish the Liver (Used in Spring)**

**First Posture:**
Cover the mouth with both hands, gather warmth, saliva, and sweat, then rub the face up and down thirty to fifty times. Perform this after meals to enhance radiance. Alternatively, rub the face vigorously until it grows very hot, imparting a lustrous, unwrinkled complexion. After three years of practice, one’s countenance will resemble a maiden’s, the eyes will brighten, and all chronic ailments will disperse. Guide the qi from the liver through the shoulders and back, drawing forth harmonious primal qi to nourish the liver and replenish the lower elixir field. All Dao Yin methods require holding the breath. First, ensure the blood and vessels flow freely throughout the body, and all illnesses will be cured. Take care not to open the mouth or exhale forcefully. When exerting effort, guard against external pathogenic qi invading the viscera and bowels, lest it invite misfortune. Exercise caution.

**Second Posture:**
Sit upright, interlock the fingers, and exert force. This treats wind in the liver. Press the hands behind the neck, tilt the head back, and gaze upward. Let the neck and hands contend in force to dispel heat toxins, shoulder pain, and blurred vision. If stagnant wind qi accumulates and fails to disperse, the heart’s fire will burn it away. Then, regulate the harmonious qi to nourish the liver, descend it to the sea of qi, and replenish the inner pearl.

**Third Posture:**
Press one hand over the other, press the thighs, and pull forcefully to the left and right to expel wind toxins from the waist and chest, nourishing the liver and brightening the eyes.

**One Posture to Nourish the Spleen (Used in Late Spring)**

**Fourth Posture:**
Mimic the "shooting hawk" stance to the left and right, dispelling stagnation in the chest and diaphragm, and resolving wind qi congestion in the spleen. Apply force while holding the breath, allowing the internal qi to disperse.

**Three Postures to Nourish the Heart (Used in Summer)**

**Fifth Posture:**
Sit upright with legs extended, lean the body diagonally, and exert force as if pushing a mountain, using all strength to dispel wind-cold from the waist and spine, freeing the five viscera and six bowels, dispersing leg qi. Perform equally on both sides to nourish the heart and sharpen the mind.

**Sixth Posture:**
Press one hand against the thigh while the other reaches upward with all force, as if lifting a stone, to expel wind toxins from between the ribs and regulate the heart. Harmonize the blood vessels. Perform equally on both sides while holding the breath. Follow this method throughout the twelfth month. Practice this immediately after the first posture.

**Seventh Posture:**
Regularly clasp the hands together and thrust them forward to stretch the arms and wrists, purging the heart of wind-fatigue and freeing the joints. Perform equally on both sides, adhering to the spring method.

**One Posture to Nourish the Spleen (Used in Late Summer)**

**Eighth Posture:**
Sit upright with legs extended, stretch the fingers upward, then pull them back sharply three times, followed by forward bending to dispel numbness from the waist, spine, legs, and knees, and disperse bladder qi. Perform equally forward and backward. Begin this practice after the fourteenth day of the sixth month.

**Three Postures to Nourish the Lungs (Used in Autumn)**

**Ninth Posture:**
Clasp the hands behind the head and neck, turning and rotating the body with gentle bows, to dispel wind qi from between the ribs, chest, sinews, and back, freeing the lungs of all ailments. Perform equally on both sides of the neck, following the first-month method.

**Tenth Posture:**
Interlace the fingers above the head and stretch forcefully to the left and right ten times, dispelling wind qi from the joints and regulating the lungs of all ailments.

**Eleventh Posture:**
Clench the fists and strike the shins ten times or more to open the chest and diaphragm, expel facial qi, and regulate the lungs of all ailments. Perform while holding the breath, as in the first month. Follow this by tapping the teeth together thirty-six times.

**One Posture to Nourish the Spleen (Used in Late Autumn)**

**Twelfth Posture:**
Begin this practice after the twelfth day of the ninth month to nourish the spleen. Interlace the fingers above the head and exert force against them. Perform equally on both sides to regulate the spleen and limbs, dispel stagnant wind qi and diaphragm qi from beneath the ribs, and stimulate the appetite. Perform while holding the breath.

**Three Postures to Nourish the Kidneys (Used in Winter)**

**Thirteenth Posture:**
Interlace the fingers and press one foot upon them to relieve tension in the waist and legs, kidney qi ailments, cold numbness, wind toxins in the hands and feet, and knee pain.

**Fourteenth Posture:**
Sit upright with legs extended, stretch the fingers, and gently pull the toes to treat leg numbness, wind-dampness, kidney toxins, and pain from long journeys. This posture is most excellent for regular practice.

**Fifteenth Posture:**
Press one hand against the knee while the other clasps the head, bending forward, backward, and to the sides to dispel wind from the bones and joints, free the blood vessels, bladder, and kidney qi, and regulate the kidneys of all ailments.

**One Posture to Nourish the Spleen (Used in Late Winter)**

**Sixteenth Posture:**
Raise both hands upward with all force three times to regulate the spleen of all ailments. Follow the spring method.

The preceding sixteen postures are most effective when performed while holding the breath. After the dissemination of this *Dao-yin* method, a thousand years later, a Daoist master greatly propagated the Dao’s qi through the five tones—*gong*, *shang*, *jue*, *zhi*, and *yu*—and many scholars gathered, numbering eight hundred. After the second refinement, within the four *yuan*, they ascended in succession. The first refinement took five hundred years, the second a thousand. The common world reckons twelve years as one cycle, while the Dao counts twelve years as one *ji*, sixty years as one *yuan*, and two hundred forty years as four *yuan*. Thus does the Dao endure in the world.

*Ling Jian Zi* concludes.
