### **Compendium of Nurturing Life**

#### **Guiding and Pulling (Dao Yin) Chapter**

**Red Pine Master’s Seated Pulling Method**
Kneel upright, both hands extended forward.
Separate them, fingers pointing outward.
Next, kneel upright, hands clasped at the waist.
Then kneel upright again, right hand pulling backward, left hand clasped before the abdomen.
Next, slowly kneel upright, alternating hands pulling forward and clasping the waist.
Then kneel upright, stretching both hands behind the back.
Finally, sit evenly, knees spread apart, feet turned outward, hands clasped at the waist.
Regular practice of this method sharpens hearing and vision, prolongs life, and prevents all illness.
After completing this method, stand and rub the body thoroughly with the hands. Avoid practicing during extreme cold, heat, windy dryness, drunkenness, or after a heavy meal.

The *Essential Collection of Nurturing Life* states: The *Dao Yin Classic* says: On a clear day, before rising, first tap the teeth thirty-four times, close the eyes, clench the fists, rinse the mouth with saliva, swallow once, then hold the breath to its limit before exhaling slowly.
Stamp the heels three times, then raise the hands, clasping them behind the neck, and twist the body left and right without breathing, repeating three times. Extend both legs, reach forward and backward with the hands, stretching fully three times. Perform these at dawn and dusk; frequent practice is especially beneficial.
Also, at dawn upon rising, clasp both ears with the hands and pull them up and down fourteen times to prevent deafness.
Next, contract the nose, hold the breath, and use the right hand to pull the left ear from above the head fourteen times, then repeat with the left hand pulling the right ear fourteen times.
Then pull the temples upward.
This promotes the flow of blood and qi, preventing gray hair.
Also, rub the hands until warm and massage the face upward and downward fourteen times to dispel evil qi and give the face a radiant glow.
Rub the hands until warm and massage the body from top to bottom—this is called "dry bathing."
It strengthens resistance to cold, heat, headaches, and all illnesses.

12. **Phoenix Flapping Wings:** Cross the hands and strike the shoulders, then strike the back, waist, and legs, repeating several times. Perform with gentle pulling and twisting, prioritizing comfort and avoiding overexertion or fatigue.

#### **Regulating Qi Chapter**

**Exhalation and Inhalation for Qi Refinement**
All things between heaven and earth take form through qi. Thus, qi resides within humans, and humans reside within qi. When qi gathers, life begins; when qi dissipates, death follows. Those skilled in guiding qi nurture the body internally and ward off harm externally, though the common people use it daily without awareness. Therefore, proper regulation and care dissolve all illnesses; if blockages persist, ailments arise. Those who nurture life must first master this Dao.

The *Immortal Classics* state: Those who ingest qi gain spiritual clarity and longevity. Yet even those who consume medicinal foods but do not regulate qi will see delayed effects. If one specializes in regulating qi to treat illness, the results surpass acupuncture and stone needles. Those who constantly cultivate this attain the Dao of immortality.

*Baopuzi* says: The human body resembles a kingdom. Spirit is like the ruler, blood like the ministers, and qi like the people. Governing the people enables governance of the state; regulating qi enables regulation of the body. When the people scatter, the state falls; when qi is exhausted, the body dies. The dead cannot be revived, nor can the fallen be restored. Thus, the sage eliminates incipient harm, treats illness before it arises, and heals before matters escalate—not after they have passed. Humans are difficult to nurture yet easy to endanger; qi is hard to purify yet easy to pollute. Therefore, scrutinizing virtue preserves the state, and curbing desires strengthens blood and qi. Only then are all harms dispelled, and longevity attained.

Every clear morning upon rising, face south, extend both hands upon the knees, and visualize qi entering the neck and descending to the *yongquan* (bubbling spring) acupoint. Doing this daily is called "sending qi." Always inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, ensuring exhalation is less than inhalation. Before eating, first send qi into the abdomen, allowing it to govern the food.

The *Immortals’ Classics* state: "There are twelve times for consuming qi, which begins at midnight. From nine nines to eight eights, seven sevens, six sixes, and five fives, receive it with the heart. In the four seasons, draw the yellow qi of Saturn and receive it with the spleen. In autumn, draw the white qi of Venus and receive it with the lungs. In winter, draw the black qi of Mercury and receive it with the kidneys. There is also the method of consuming the essence of the six *wu* days, which yields great efficacy. For example, during the *jiazi*旬, if there is a *wuchen* day, face the *chen* direction throughout the旬 to swallow qi; afterward, when the next *jia* day arrives, face the *wu* direction of that旬. All these methods are recorded in the *Immortals’ Classics*, yet they may not be practiced by the common folk—how could a gentleman devoted to the Dao forget them?"

Various *Qi-Consuming Classics* state: "From midnight to noon is the time of living qi; from noon to midnight is the time of dead qi. Always during the living qi hour, lie perfectly still, close the eyes, clench the fists, hold the breath without exhaling, and count silently to two hundred before exhaling through the mouth. Daily increase the count in this manner, and the body’s spirits will be complete while the five viscera are at peace. If one can hold the breath to two hundred fifty, the *huagai* (canopy) will brighten, the ears and eyes will grow sharp, the entire body will be free of illness, and evil will not invade.

"Treasure qi is also called refining qi, circulating qi, or long breathing. Its method: lie perfectly still, slowly rinse the mouth with *liquan* (sweet spring) and swallow it. While circulating qi, only exhale through the mouth and only inhale through the nose, gently contracting the nostrils to draw it in. Do not overfill, for excess makes it difficult to return. After five breaths, one may exhale. Count each breath to ninety; if possible, stretch frequently. After stretching, repeat the practice, completing four nines. Four nines make three hundred sixty breaths, constituting one full cycle. When swallowing, with each exhalation, pause to swallow once before inhaling through the nose again—otherwise, it may cause coughing.

"When qi is inhaled, it ascends; when exhaled, it descends, circulating throughout the body. In practicing qi circulation, on the first day of the month, visualize qi exiting through the ten fingertips, continuing until the sixteenth day. On the last day of the month, visualize qi exiting through the ten toes. With prolonged practice, one will naturally feel qi flowing through the hands and feet, enabling breath-holding without exhalation—thus attaining longevity. The spiritual tortoise lives a thousand years without eating because it does not stir its nasal breath.

"The *Great Clarity* method of circulating through the gates and doors is called *Heavenly Strength and Earthly Strength* in the *Nine Capitals Classic*. When qi flows through Heavenly and Earthly Strength, one can achieve lightness of body. The hands are the Gate of Heaven; the feet are the Door of Earth. The hands are Heavenly Strength; the feet are Earthly Strength.

"When practicing qi circulation, always do so with the hair bound tightly. During the living qi hour at dawn, lie perfectly still, clench the fists, keep the feet five inches apart, and hold the arms five inches from the body. Remove the pillow, breathe gently, and complete four nines—three hundred sixty breaths—until the body feels as limp as discarded clothing, with all joints relaxed. Initially, after three hundred sixty breaths, one will gradually sense clouds moving within the body, circulating throughout, moistening the form, irrigating the skin, and filling the five viscera and six bowels, gradually dispelling old illnesses.

"When first practicing qi circulation, first stabilize the body and harmonize the breath, avoiding conflict with intention. If not at ease, pause and resume only when harmonized, maintaining consistency without weariness. Little practice yields little benefit; great practice yields great benefit. When qi arrives, the body is at peace; when the body is at peace, nasal breathing becomes harmonious. When nasal breathing is harmonious, essence and qi arrive; when essence and qi arrive, the body naturally grows warm. When the body grows warm, slight sweating occurs—do not rise immediately but rest calmly, prolonging the state as much as possible.

"Eliminate anger, resentment, and sorrow. By doing so, qi remains unconfused, and true qi arrives. When true qi arrives, the mouth becomes sweet and fragrant, saliva increases, nasal breathing lengthens subtly, the five viscera are at peace, and qi harmonizes. Naturally, all illnesses depart, food tastes delicious, the three qi are regulated, the body feels light, and one attains longevity.

"In qi circulation, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, gently drawing it in—this is called long breathing. There is one method of inhalation and six methods of exhalation. The one method of inhalation is *absorption*. The six methods of exhalation are *chui* (blowing), *hu* (exhaling), *xi* (sighing), *he* (expelling), *xu* (hissing), and *si* (whispering)—all are ways of expelling qi.

"Human breathing consists of one exhalation and one inhalation, without this count, it is long breathing. The method of exhaling qi: when cold, use *chui*; when warm, use *xi*. For treating illnesses, *chui* dispels heat, *xi* dispels wind, *he* dispels vexation, and for those with deficient lower qi, use more *xu* and *si*. Daoists practicing qi circulation should avoid *xu* and *si* abruptly, as they are taboos in long breathing. Both men and women can practice this method." (From the *Imitating Immortals Classic*)

**Breath-Holding Method:**
Also inhale through the nose, then hold the breath internally for as long as possible before slightly exhaling through the mouth. Exhale gently, then inhale slightly through the nose again. Repeat this two or three times before fully exhaling, following the above methods of *chui*, *hu*, *xi*, and *he*. When holding the breath to one thousand five hundred, one should only inhale without exhaling—qi enters through the nose and flows to the hands and feet without exiting through the mouth. To release it through the mouth, exhale from there. Like flowing water, where the preceding current departs and the following current continues without reversal, the Dao of longevity culminates here.

**Refining Qi Method:**
Lie perfectly still, slowly rinse the mouth with *liquan* and swallow it. Do not close the mouth while circulating qi—only exhale through the mouth and inhale through the nose, avoiding the entry of foul qi. Gently contract the nostrils, but do not overfill, for excess makes it difficult to return. After five breaths, one may exhale, but not to the extreme.

Begin by counting from one to ten breaths, then bend the fingers to tally up to ninety breaths—one may stretch intermittently. At four nines, three hundred sixty breaths, envision within the brain a yellow qi, vast as an egg, and dwell upon it constantly. Should the mind grow weary, first perform two hundred ten breaths of "refining qi to return qi," filling the liver; if the qi does not swell greatly, allow it to exit. Hold the breath for seventy breaths before swallowing, and if the breath feels insufficient, replenish it with another seventy breaths—do not force a sudden surge. The qi, once struck, should rise and flow outward, suffusing the four limbs, warming from above downward to the feet. Gradually regulate the qi to return to the stomach duct, then guide it through the throat and swallow, directing it downward past the navel—one, two, three, four—and back to the duct. For all refining qi methods, perform them externally, sitting at dawn and dusk.

As with the previous supine refining qi method, proceed to seventy breaths, four or five cycles. Initially, the qi may feel slightly unregulated, but with prolonged practice, it becomes effortless. When guiding qi back to the stomach, one will sense its arrival upon swallowing. Then coil it around the navel, counting one through nine, and cease—do not forcefully exhale or swallow. Instead, turn the qi downward, ensuring it does not rise. If the qi in the minor meridians ascends, guide it back down to strengthen the body’s true qi. After a slight exhale, inhale two or three times, and it will descend naturally.

To treat dizziness and deafness, guide qi to harmonize the five viscera—recovery should take no more than ten days. For "yielding qi," perform three hundred sixty breaths in four nines while lying perfectly still, fists clenched. First harmonize the breath, hold saliva in the mouth without swallowing, and every nine breaths, shift position slightly, drawing the feet five inches apart. As the qi gently returns, the body should feel as supple as discarded clothing, the joints entirely loosened. After ninety breaths, cease, keeping one finger unclenched. Initially, warmth will arise; by three hundred sixty breaths, it will recur. By the third nine, focus the mind without allowing thoughts to scatter. To resume, sit upright—men on the left side, women on the right. Swallow once every seventy breaths. This is the method by which both men and women attain immortality through refining qi.

Though holding and refining qi are essential for cultivating the body, one must first thoroughly grasp their principles. The space within should remain empty and unfilled. If qi becomes stagnant and fails to circulate, it may cause sores—like a spring’s source, it must not be dammed. Consuming raw vegetables or meat, or harboring joy, anger, sorrow, or worry while refining qi, may induce counterflow qi. Those who wish to practice this must proceed gradually.

Another method states: To regulate qi, face south at dawn, extend both hands upon the knees, and gently press the joints. Exhale turbid qi through the mouth and inhale pure qi through the nose—this is what is meant by "expelling the old and absorbing the new." After each inhalation, hold the breath for a long moment, then exhale slowly. Use the hands to press upward, downward, forward, and backward. While drawing qi, visualize it entering through the pores, flowing into the five viscera and four limbs, nourishing them all—like mountains receiving clouds, like earth absorbing moisture. When the qi flows smoothly, one will feel a warm, rolling sensation in the abdomen. After achieving ten or more cycles, the body will become moist and radiant, the ears and eyes sharp, appetite and strength increase, and all illnesses vanish.

There is also an internal qi-regulation method similar to the above. With gradual practice up to a thousand breaths, even the aged will grow younger, reversing time day by day, until they naturally cease eating. The method of regulating qi has no fixed count—only that more is better. Generally, perform twenty-four cycles after midnight, eighteen at cockcrow, twelve at dawn, and twelve after noon. If one can practice more, adding thirty or forty cycles per session is also acceptable.

The *Scripture of Immortals* states: On days of heavy fog, rain, or wind, do not refine qi—simply remain still without regulating. Before regulating qi, first remove the hairs from the nostrils, for they are the path to communion with the spirits. To refine qi and cure illness, direct the mind to the afflicted area. For head ailments, focus on the head; for foot ailments, focus on the feet. Harmonize the qi to attack the illness, and from one hour to the next, it will dissipate. For seasonal colds, hold the breath to induce sweating, and when it covers the body, the illness will resolve.

**Therapeutic Method:**
Follow the seated qi-regulation posture. For sudden afflictions like chills, fever, or swelling, regulate qi on the same day—if not cured, recovery will come within one or two days. For cold illnesses of the heart, blow the qi out; for heat illnesses, exhale with *he*; for liver ailments, exhale with *xu*; for lung ailments, exhale with *yi*; for spleen ailments, exhale with *xi*; for kidney ailments, blow the qi out. Perform each thirty-six times, and always incorporate guiding and pulling exercises.

For heat illnesses, use a strong *chui* fifty times and a gentle *chui* ten times. For heart distress, use a strong *xu* thirty times and a gentle *xu* ten times. For liver ailments, use a strong *he* thirty times and a gentle *he* ten times. For heart ailments, use a strong *xu* thirty times and a gentle *xu* ten times. For kidney ailments, use a strong *yi* fifty times and a gentle *yi* thirteen times. With diligent practice, there is no illness that will not be cured.

How does one recognize the illnesses of the five viscera? If the body experiences alternating cold and heat, and one dreams of red-clad figures wielding red blades, it is an illness of the heart. If the chest and diaphragm feel distended and full, the limbs restless, and one dreams of beautiful women, family, or spouses, it is an illness of the lungs. If one feels sorrowful and joyless, with frequent head and eye pain, and dreams of green-clad figures, or those wielding green blades, or lions and wolves threatening, it is an illness of the liver. If the body feels wandering winds or itching, with oppression and pain, and one dreams of children striking the armpits or whirlwinds encircling them, it is an illness of the spleen.

If the body feels cold and the yin is deficient, or one dreams of black-clad figures wielding black blades to frighten them, it is an illness of the kidneys. Extrapolating from this, none will fail to be accurate.

Master Le’s Qi-Regulating Method is largely similar to the previous method. It states: within a quiet chamber, arrange a pillow of proper height, level with the body. Extend the hands three or four inches from the body, and space the feet likewise. First, one must contemplate: the Dharma-nature is equanimous; life and death are not delusive. Bind the hun and restrain the po. Strike the Heavenly Drum thirty-two times, rinse the Jade Spring three to five swallows, and draw breath through the nose into the abdomen, counting the breaths—more is better—without letting the ears hear the sound of the incoming breath. When first drawing breath, if one can manage only twenty or thirty breaths before feeling stifled, hold the breath without letting it escape through the nose, then gently release it through the mouth, exhaling just enough to feel the body grow warm and a slight sweat appear—this is the sign that the qi is circulating. For qi-ingestion, at night, one may complete the practice between the hours of *zi* and *chou*; during the day, between *si* and *wu*. After ingesting qi, kneel firmly and use the qi to draw up the intestines, then expel it downward, repeating this thirty to fifty times—this is called "qi-refinement." All illnesses in the abdomen and the four limbs will thus be cured.

The number of breaths to be taken is set forth below. For qi-ingestion, first draw the black qi of the north, called the "Mysterious Sprout." Contemplate the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper and their victorious affairs, continuing until settled—whether five, fifty, or five hundred breaths—to supplement the kidneys, then transmit the qi to the liver, for the Water viscus of the north governs the kidneys. Next, draw the green qi of the east, the "Azure Sprout." Contemplate the Seven Stars of the Eastern Dipper and their victorious affairs to supplement the liver—whether nine, ninety, or nine hundred breaths—then transmit the qi to the heart, for the Wood viscus of the east governs the liver. Next, draw the cinnabar qi of the south, the "Vermilion Sprout." Contemplate the Seven Stars of the Southern Dipper and their victorious affairs—whether three, thirty, or three hundred breaths—to supplement the heart, then transmit the qi to the spleen, for the Fire viscus of the south governs the heart. Next, draw the yellow qi of the central palace, the "Yellow Sprout." Contemplate the Seven Stars of the Central Dipper and their victorious affairs—whether one, ten, or one hundred breaths—to supplement the spleen, then transmit the qi to the lungs, for the Earth viscus of the center governs the spleen. Finally, draw the white qi of the west, the "Pristine Sprout." Contemplate the Seven Stars of the Western Dipper and their victorious affairs—whether seven, seventy, or seven hundred breaths—to supplement the lungs, then transmit the qi to the kidneys, for the Metal viscus of the west governs the lungs.

There is also a method of exhaling qi to cure all illnesses, which complements qi-ingestion. If the qi becomes full and does not circulate, one may exhale it. The method of exhalation is as follows: *he* (1), *hu* (2), *xu* (3), *xi* (4), *yan* (5), *chui* (6). Exhaling with *he* expels the qi of the lungs, for Metal governs Venus, and the lungs, being Metal, do not receive guest qi. The guest is Fire; when the guest is strong, it harms the host, so one expels it with *he*. Exhaling with *chui* expels the qi of the heart, for Fire governs Mars, and the heart, being Fire, does not receive guest qi. The guest is Water; when the guest is strong, it harms the host, so one expels it with *chui*. Exhaling with *yan* expels the qi of the liver, for Wood governs Jupiter, and the liver, being Wood, does not receive guest qi. The guest is Metal; when the guest is strong, it harms the host, so one expels it with *yan*. Exhaling with *xu* expels the qi of the spleen, for Earth governs Saturn, and the spleen, being Earth, does not receive guest qi. The guest is Wood; when the guest is strong, it harms the host, so one expels it with *xu*. Exhaling with *hu* expels the qi of the kidneys, for Water governs Mercury, and the kidneys, being Water, do not receive guest qi. The guest is Earth; when the guest is strong, it harms the host, so one expels it with *hu*. Exhaling with *xi* expels the qi of the bladder. The Triple Burner is the palace of water and grain; when injured by cold, it causes dysentery, and when injured by heat, it causes oppression. Oppression leads to illness in the small intestine, while dysentery leads to illness in the large intestine. Exhaling with *xi* restores harmony.

The liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*, the spleen stores the will, the heart stores the spirit, and the kidneys store the essence. If the six bowels are disharmonious, the five viscera are harmed by guest qi. The gallbladder is the first, the large intestine the second, the small intestine the third, and the Triple Burner, though formless, is counted as the sixth bowel. If the six bowels are disharmonious, the five viscera do not communicate; if the five viscera do not communicate, the five qi are not transmitted, and both the five and six become diseased. If one can dissolve and settle them, one may remain free of illness.

**Embryonic Breathing and Embryonic Nourishment Method**
One must constantly quiet the heart, dispel thoughts, and make the breath subtle. Breathe through the nose, not the mouth, so that the qi is always stored—this is called "embryonic breathing." Rinse the spring beneath the tongue and swallow it, continuing for several tens of breaths without interruption—this is called "embryonic nourishment." By practicing these two without ceasing, one may avoid hunger and illness.

**Ingesting the Essence of the Sun and Moon**
At sunrise, noon, and sunset, stand facing the sun, extend both hands, and hold the breath nine times. Tilt the head back, draw in the sunlight, and swallow it nine times to replenish essence and qi, making one strong and preventing the decline of the six and eight (i.e., aging). At moonrise, midnight, and moonset, stand facing the moon, extend both hands, and hold the breath nine times. Tilt the head back, draw in the moonlight, and swallow it to strengthen the yin qi. Women who do this will conceive.

**Dwelling and Abiding**

**Methods of Regulating and Nurturing**

The art of regulating and nurturing begins with adapting to the water and soil of one’s environment, which must be a high and dry place. As the *Zuo Zhuan* states: *"Where the soil is thick and the water deep, dwelling there brings no illness."* Low and damp places, however, are certain to harm one’s health. This is evident in the fact that southerners often die young, while northerners tend to live long. As the *Huainanzi* observes: *"Firm soil breeds resolute people; weak soil breeds plump people. Clay soil breeds large people; sandy soil breeds delicate people. Fertile soil breeds beautiful people; barren soil breeds ugly people. Mountainous qi yields many sons; marsh qi yields many daughters. Water qi yields many sores; wind qi yields many deaf. Forest qi yields many malarial fevers; wood qi yields many retchings. Damp qi yields many convulsions; stone qi yields great strength. Yin qi yields many thin people; summer heat yields many early deaths; cold qi yields long life. Valley qi yields many numbnesses; hill qi yields many madmen. Vast qi yields many benevolent people; mound qi yields many greedy people. Light soil yields agile people; heavy soil yields slow people. Clear water yields soft voices; turbid water yields loud voices. Rapid water yields light people; sluggish water yields heavy people. Central soil yields many sages."* Since all people are shaped by the water and soil of their land, determining good or ill fortune, how can one fail to choose one’s dwelling with care?

In ancient times, people lived in nests or caves and enjoyed long lives—why? Was it not because nest-dwellers were elevated and cave-dwellers secluded, shielding them from the winds of their abodes? Since the advent of raised beams and tiled roofs, however, nest- and cave-dwellers have suffered myriad illnesses, meeting early deaths and shortening their lifespans. Modern dwellings must not be excessively tall, spacious, or drafty, for not only are wind and mist difficult to guard against, but such spaces also scatter the spirit. As the *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* warns: *"High terraces breed excess yang; large chambers breed atrophy; excess yang breeds collapse."* Moreover, the admonition against extravagant houses should not be taken lightly.

The ancients chose dwellings solely for their enclosed walls and secluded courtyards, ensuring that even the faintest breeze could not penetrate. In this way, illnesses naturally did not arise. If one senses a draft, one must avoid it. Even the slightest crevice can cause grave harm—since ancient times, sudden wind-strokes, paralysis, arched-back convulsions, and loss of speech have all stemmed from neglecting this. Once the body is struck by wind, a host of ailments gather, and malevolent spirits seize the opportunity, leading to untimely death. There was once an innkeeper in Luoyang whose pillar had a hole the size of a coin; neither he nor his successors noticed it, and all died of the same affliction—proof of this principle.

One’s dwelling must be kept clean and orderly. Burning incense morning and evening ensures that one does not inhale foul qi but instead enjoys harmonious qi. Those who cultivate life should also keep mirrors aligned with the sun and moon, along with stone essence, a golden-light sword, raw rhinoceros horn, musk, realgar, cinnabar, and other protective talismans—greatly auspicious.

The *Scripture of the Immortals* further advises: Place a large basin of clear water at the entrance, lay a broadsword across it with the blade facing outward, and hang a bright mirror above. Inscribe a demon-subduing talisman beside the mirror, and no evil will dare approach; if they do, their blood will appear in the water. Alternatively, simply hang a nine-inch mirror of fine quality behind you, and no demonic entity will dare reveal its form.

**Ding Gong’s Demon-Slaying Pill (Formula Bestowed by an Immortal)**
- Tiger bone
- Cinnabar
- True pearl
- Realgar
- Orpiment
- Azurite
- Female green (a mineral)
- Ghost’s umbrella (a plant)
- Gleditsia fruit
- Platycodon root
- Peony root
- Angelica root
- Atractylodes
- Lindera root
- Ghost’s arrow (a plant)
- Ghost’s overseer (a plant)
- Flowering reed
- Sweet flag

Grind each of the eighteen ingredients into powder (two parts each), mix with honey, and form into pills the size of a bullet. Carry one: men on the left, women on the right. No evil will dare approach, dreams will be undisturbed, and the hun and po souls will remain at peace.

For all matters of dwelling, movement, or illness avoidance, there are auspicious locations—gentlemen who nurture life should employ them. The most significant are the virtues of the year, month, day, and hour.

**Method for Determining the Year’s Virtue**
In a *jia* year, virtue resides in *jia*; in a *yi* year, in *geng*. In a *bing* year, virtue resides in *bing*; in a *ding* year, in *ren*. In a *wu* year, virtue resides in *wu*; in a *ji* year, in *jia*. In a *geng* year, virtue resides in *geng*; in a *xin* year, in *bing*. In a *ren* year, virtue resides in *ren*; in a *gui* year, in *wu*.

**Method for Determining the Month’s Virtue**
In the first month, virtue is in *ding*; in the second, in *kun*; in the third, in *ren*; in the fourth, in *xin*; in the fifth, in *qian*; in the sixth, in *jia*; in the seventh, in *gui*; in the eighth, in *gen*; in the ninth, in *bing*; in the tenth, in *yi*; in the eleventh, in *xun*; in the twelfth, in *geng*.

**Method for Determining the Day’s Virtue**
This follows the year’s virtue: on a *jia* day, virtue resides in *jia*; on a *yi* day, in *geng*, and so on.

**Method for Determining the Hour’s Virtue**
This follows the month’s virtue: in the *yin* hour, virtue is in *ding*; in the *mao* hour, in *kun*, and so forth.

There is also the **Method of Calculating the Wandering Year**:
Begin with *li* (9), but *qian* (6) does not accept 8, so proceed to *li* (9), then to *dui* (10), *kan* (20), *zhen* (30), *li* (40). *Kun* (2) does not accept 1, so return to *li* (9), then to *dui* (50), continuing in this manner up to 120 years.

Wherever the Wandering Year arrives:
- The first change brings misfortune.
- A complete change brings the Five Ghosts.
- A second change brings the Cut-off Life.
- A complete change of Cut-off Life brings the Six Harms.
- A third change brings Generative Qi.
- A complete change of Generative Qi brings the Heavenly Physician’s Return.
- A complete change of the Wandering Year brings Blessed Virtue.

For dwelling or relocation, prioritize Generative Qi and Blessed Virtue. To avoid illness, also seek the Heavenly Physician, while considering the correspondences of the myriad things for auspiciousness. Avoid Cut-off Life, Misfortune, the Five Ghosts, and the Six Harms at all costs.

Another saying holds: *"Men should avoid Misfortune; women should avoid Cut-off Life."*

If a dwelling has fire, construction, or disturbances in the locations of the Grand Year, Grand Yin, Great General, Monthly Punishment, or Monthly Killing, dig a pit five feet square at the Heavenly Granary, place a thousand catties of stone inside, stack a thousand tiles atop them, and seal with mud—greatly auspicious.

For yang dwellings, the Heavenly Granary is at *ding*; remedy it on *bing* or *xin* days in the first month. For yin dwellings, the Heavenly Granary is at *gui*; remedy it on *ding* or *ren* days in the seventh month.

If afflicted in the south, bury one black stone weighing eleven catties and one *dou* of black soybeans beneath the southern wall—disasters will not arise, greatly auspicious. If afflicted in the east, bury one white stone weighing ten catties and one *dou* of white rice beneath the eastern wall—disasters will vanish, greatly auspicious. If afflicted in the west, bury one red stone weighing twelve catties and one *dou* of red adzuki beans beneath the western wall—calamities will not arise, securing great auspiciousness. If afflicted in the north, bury one yellow stone weighing ten catties, five *liang* of realgar, and one *dou* of millet beneath the northern wall—greatly auspicious. If afflicted within the central palace of the dwelling, bury one green stone weighing thirteen catties and one *dou* of green rice in the central courtyard—greatly auspicious.

If the dwelling suffers frequent epidemics, bury one hundred and twenty catties of stone in front of the hall, one *zhang* and six *chi* from the door—auspicious. If the dwelling is haunted by ghosts, bury eighty catties of stone in the *ren* sector—auspicious. If excavation risks depleting the earth’s qi and harming people, bury one hundred and ten catties of stone at each of the four corners—greatly auspicious. If the dwelling suffers frequent illnesses, bury one hundred catties of stone in the *mao* sector—greatly auspicious. Additionally, bury ninety catties of yellow stone beneath the horse post to benefit horses—greatly auspicious. Bury fifty catties of green stone within the cattle pen to benefit oxen—auspicious.

In late summer, bury ninety catties of yellow stone in the courtyard—auspicious. On the day of *Lichun*, bury thirty catties of green stone beneath the eastern wall; on the day of *Lixia*, bury twenty catties of red stone beneath the southern wall; on the day of *Liqiu*, bury forty catties of white stone beneath the western wall; on the day of *Lidong*, bury one hundred catties of black stone beneath the northern wall—all securing great auspiciousness.

For all stone burials, use the day of Monthly Virtue corresponding to the direction. The stones must be whole, buried three *chi* deep, and the site anointed with wine and dried meat as an offering. The master of the house should personally recite a prayer.

**Method of Burying Sand**
If the Grand Year resides in *yin*, *wu*, or *xu*, the Harmful Qi is in *hai*; if in *si*, *you*, or *chou*, the Harmful Qi is in *yin*; if in *hai*, *mao*, or *wei*, the Harmful Qi is in *shen*; if in *shen*, *zi*, or *chen*, the Harmful Qi is in *si*. At the location of Harmful Qi, dig a pit three *chi* square and deep, place three *dou* of fine sand from an east-flowing stream into the pit, pour three *dou* of pure wine over it, then cover with earth. All household members, young and old, should tread upon it, tamping it down with a pestle—fourteen strokes each. The Harmful Qi will dissipate, and the household will be free from disasters and illnesses. This method may also be applied to cities, provinces, and temples, preferably on the *wu* day of the first month—greatly auspicious.

**Affliction by Earth Causing Illness**
Such illness often manifests as bodily heaviness and aching limbs. At dawn on an empty stomach, burn chaff to produce smoke, fumigate the nose and mouth, and inhale a small amount—recovery will follow within three attempts.

**Lao Jun’s Method for River Bend Father to Thank Heaven and Earth**
Regularly, on *chen* or *si* days at dusk during clear weather, sweep the *jia*, *wu*, *bing*, and *ren* sectors of the dwelling. Burn incense facing north, bow three times, and remain silent, reciting inwardly: *"Your descendant [Name] has repeatedly failed the Yellow Heaven and urgently seeks the governance of the Supreme Emperor. May all transgressions committed by every member of this household, past and present, be dissolved in advance, and may goodness be cultivated henceforth. Grant peace to the body-spirits of all in this household."*

Practicing this Dao regularly brings great fortune.

**Method to Ward Off Thieves and Bandits**
Take earth from a market gate and soil from the Destructive Month of the Grand Year’s Establishment, mold them into a figurine, and place it in the Vermilion Bird sector—greatly auspicious.

**Miscellaneous Methods for Dwellings to Ward Off Evil**
On *Lichun*, apply soil from a wealthy household’s field to the threshold—greatly auspicious and prosperous. On *liuding* days, sweep the house; regular maintenance brings great auspiciousness. On the *shangsi* day of the first month, apply soil from the center of a wealthy household’s gate to the threshold—also greatly auspicious. On the *ren* day of the second month, mix roadside soil with well water drawn at dawn and apply it to the threshold—also greatly auspicious.

On Establishment days, hang a broken cart yoke above the door to avert slander. Bury deer antlers within the gate, in the latrine, or elsewhere to attract wealth. Bury ox hooves at the four corners of the dwelling—also greatly auspicious. On *Lichun*, apply a two-*cun* square of soil outside the dwelling’s forest to avert disasters. On a Full Moon day, brew wine with water from three households—great wealth will follow. On a *dinghai* day, scoop rice with the left hand and cast it into the threshold—all wishes will be granted, greatly auspicious.

On the Establishment day of the first month, place peach-wood axe handles and old cart wheels inside the door, and peach wood outside the door—ghosts will never return. At night, pull a single stalk of straw from the bedding, leaving three *cun* exposed—ghosts and demons will not approach.

**Taboos**
Burying worn shoes in the courtyard brings official rank and nobility to descendants—greatly auspicious. Do not place foul or filthy things in the auspicious sector of the dwelling’s surname. The northwest corner is the Heavenly Gate; do not defile it with excrement or filth, nor install wells or latrines there. Keep it immaculate—greatly auspicious. Do not fell the largest tree in the dwelling; if it dies naturally, remove it.

Do not plant peach trees in the southwest or near wells—peach blossoms falling into wells are inauspicious. Do not plant mulberry or peach trees in the center of the dwelling, nor plant *momu* trees. Do not use winnowing baskets to hold excrement. Do not discard broken utensils into latrines. Do not block wells or roads. Do not kindle fire and carry it through the gate—all are inauspicious.

When constructing a house, do not join wood to make pillars, nor use naturally fallen wood as pillars—both are inauspicious.

*The Dragon Head Classic* states: In spring, do not fell wood in the east on *jia* or *yi* days; in summer, do not produce lime or charcoal on *bing* or *ding* days; in late summer, do not undertake construction or excavation on *wu* or *ji* days; in autumn, do not cast or inscribe on *geng* or *xin* days; in winter, do not dig ditches or canals on *ren* or *gui* days. Violating these brings misfortune to the household’s elders—greatly inauspicious.

Spring and summer belong to yang; do not carry out executions or punishments. Autumn and winter belong to yin; do not undertake excavation. Violating these brings misfortune upon oneself.

The School of Yin-Yang further states: Money from selling a house must not be used to purchase livestock; money from selling donkeys or horses must not be used to take a wife—both are greatly inauspicious and bring harm. Moreover, do not ride a horse with a *dilu* marking. Do not raise a yellow horse with white hind legs, nor a dog with a yellow chest and black ears. Do not raise a black calf born to a yellow horse or cow. For all construction, repairs, or undertakings, one must select an auspicious time and day. Following the *Six Ren Yellow and Black Dao Chart* is most effective:

- In *yin-shen* and *yi-xin* years: *yi* and *xin* are Yellow; *ding* and *gui* are Yellow.
- In *mao-you* years: *qian* and *xun* are Yellow; *kun* and *gen* are Yellow.
- In *chen-xu* years: *bing* and *ren* are Yellow; *jia* and *geng* are Yellow.
- In *si-hai* years: *ding* and *gui* are Yellow; *yi* and *xin* are Yellow.
- In *zi-wu* years: *kun* and *gen* are Yellow; *qian* and *xun* are Yellow.
- In *chou-wei* years: *jia* and *geng* are Yellow; *bing* and *ren* are Yellow.

These are the Yellow Dao of the year. For construction, following these directions ensures great auspiciousness; all other directions are inauspicious. For long journeys, relocation, marriage, childbirth, or medical treatment for the sick, these directions are also auspicious.

The method of the Monthly Yellow Dao is most reliable and is applied according to the solar terms:

- In the first and seventh months: *chou*, *chen*, *si*, and *wei* are Yellow Dao; all others are Black Dao.
- In the second and eighth months: *mao*, *wu*, *wei*, and *you* are Yellow Dao; all others are Black Dao.
- In the third and ninth months: *si*, *shen*, *you*, and *hai* are Yellow Dao; all others are Black Dao.
- In the fourth and tenth months: *wei*, *xu*, *hai*, and *chou* are Yellow Dao; all others are Black Dao.
- In the fifth and eleventh months: *you*, *zi*, *chou*, and *mao* are Yellow Dao; all others are Black Dao.
- In the sixth and twelfth months: *hai*, *yin*, *mao*, and *si* are Yellow Dao; all others are Black Dao.

For construction, renovation, relocation, travel, marriage, official appointments, childbirth, or seeking medical treatment, acting on Yellow Dao days brings great auspiciousness, while Black Dao days bring great misfortune. Even on Yellow Dao days, if the *General*, *Grand Year*, *Punishment*, *Calamity*, or *Earth Duke* resides in the direction, one should avoid it.

One account states: If the Yellow Dao has no taboos, it is entirely auspicious. Another states: For all undertakings, if one acts on a *Heavenly Amnesty Day*, when the five hundred earthly spirits ascend to heaven, the day is free of taboos. If one further aligns with the *Virtue* of the year, month, day, and hour, as well as the Yellow Dao of the year and month, one will receive great blessings. If unable to fulfill all conditions, even one or two auspicious factors will suffice. If one violates the Black Dao of the year or month or incurs other offenses that have not yet manifested, one must remedy the transgression at the site of the violation. Offenses involving five *gong* or fewer are minor; those exceeding five *gong* are major. On a Yellow Dao day or a day of *Virtue* for the year or month, dig soil from the central courtyard to a depth of one *chi* or more, taking five *sheng* of soil from each location. Sift the soil finely, then mix it with five *sheng* of wine, one *liang* each of *xunlu*, white sandalwood, *lingling* fragrance, *qingmu*, and *chenxiang* (all finely chopped). Boil the mixture in water (no fixed amount), then blend it with the wine and soil to form a paste like a pancake. Using a new broom, sweep this paste onto the walls and beams of the Yellow Dao and *Virtue* locations for the year and month, as well as the main hall and rooms. For major offenses, sweep from two *zhang* down to one *zhang*; for minor offenses, from three *chi* up to one *zhang*. Adjust according to height; if sweeping a wall, cover its full height. Only family members—children or the household head—should perform the sweeping. On this day, avoid loud voices and anger.

For yang residences, the husband sweeps the exterior; for yin residences, the wife sweeps the interior. Both must wear new clothes. If yin and yang are unclear, sweep both inside and outside. After sweeping, also sweep the *ao* (threshold). When mixing the paste, take care not to kill any insects. This method is profoundly efficacious, and its subtleties cannot be fully explained—gentlemen must not treat it lightly.

When first entering a new residence or official quarters, avoid mourning, visiting the sick, speaking of ill fortune, climbing heights or gazing into depths, peering into wells or latrines, indulging in sorrow or anger, or witnessing punishments or construction—all are inauspicious.

When assuming office, one must also select an auspicious day. For the day of appointment:
- In spring: *yin*, *mao*, *si*, and *xu* are auspicious.
- In summer: *si*, *wu*, *shen*, and *chou* are auspicious.
- In autumn: *shen*, *you*, *hai*, and *chen* are auspicious.
- In winter: *hai*, *zi*, *yin*, and *wei* are auspicious.

Days such as *Jian*, *Man*, *Ping*, *Ding*, and *Cheng* are also auspicious. When appointing an official, avoid clashing days: if appointed on a *jia* or *yi* day, do not assume office on a *geng* or *xin* day; if appointed on a *geng* or *xin* day, do not assume office on a *bing* or *ding* day; if appointed on a *bing* or *ding* day, do not assume office on a *ren* or *gui* day; if appointed on a *ren* or *gui* day, do not assume office on a *wu* or *ji* day; if appointed on a *wu* or *ji* day, do not assume office on a *jia* or *yi* day.

Another method: In spring, avoid *geng* and *xin* days

The third, ninth, fifteenth, and thirtieth days of the month are *Cai Men* (Wealth Gate) days, auspicious for assuming office, marriage, and all undertakings. The sixteenth, twenty-second, twenty-fifth, and tenth days are *Yang Men* (Yang Gate) days, auspicious for all activities. The seventeenth, twenty-first, and twenty-sixth days are *Guan Men* (Official Gate) days, auspicious for assuming office and all undertakings. The twelfth, eighteenth, twenty-fourth, and twenty-seventh days are *Hou Men* (Waiting Gate) days, during which travel may invite disputes and misfortune. All days of mourning are inauspicious.

On *zi* days: traveling south is highly inauspicious; traveling north brings minor fortune; traveling east yields wealth; traveling west brings joy.
On *chou* days: traveling south brings gains; traveling north brings minor fortune; traveling east is highly auspicious; traveling west fails.
On *yin* days: traveling south is highly auspicious; traveling north brings minor fortune; traveling east leads to delays; traveling west is highly auspicious.
On *mao* days: traveling south brings gains; traveling north is highly auspicious; traveling east invites reprimands and delays; traveling west is highly auspicious.
On *chen* days: traveling south brings feasts; traveling north invites reprimands and delays; traveling east is highly auspicious; traveling west is inauspicious.
On *si* days: traveling south is moderately auspicious; traveling north yields wealth; traveling east encounters misfortune; traveling west brings minor fortune.
On *wei* days: traveling south encounters officials; traveling north is inauspicious; traveling east is auspicious; traveling west fails.
On *shen* and *you* days: traveling south is inauspicious; traveling north is auspicious; traveling east is highly auspicious; traveling west is highly auspicious.
On *xu* days: traveling south yields wealth; traveling north fails; traveling east is inauspicious; traveling west is inauspicious.
On *hai* days: traveling south yields wealth; traveling north fails; traveling east brings minor fortune; traveling west is highly inauspicious.

Though travel days are determined by this chart, one should also consult the annual almanac. Days of *Jian* (Establishing), *Man* (Full), *Ping* (Level), *Ding* (Stable), and *Kai* (Opening) are especially auspicious. During the hours of *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *chen*, *si*, *wu*, *wei*, and *shen*, traveling south is highly auspicious. During the hours of *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *si*, *wei*, *shen*, *you*, and *hai*, traveling north is highly auspicious. During the hours of *zi*, *chou*, *mao*, *wu*, *wei*, and *xu*, traveling west is highly auspicious and yields wealth. During the hours of *zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *wu*, and *wei*, traveling east is auspicious. All travel days and hours should be carefully considered.

Another method for warding off directional taboos:
For those traveling east: carry nine coins, walk nine *li*, then discard them and depart.
For those traveling south: carry a vessel of water, walk six *li*, then discard it and depart.
For those traveling west: carry seven *jin* of charcoal, walk seven *li*, then discard it and depart.
For those traveling north: carry five *jin* of earth, walk five *li*, then discard it and depart.
This ensures great fortune and the fulfillment of all wishes.

It is also said: Before traveling, take a handful of rice in the left hand and cast it into a well—this brings great fortune.
Additionally: The *Wu Li* (Five Separations) days are inauspicious for long journeys.

If, while traveling, one encounters strong winds, fog, thunder, or lightning, it is the passage of dragon spirits. One should enter a dwelling to avoid them; failure to do so may result in prolonged illness. Traveling at dawn through mountains, waters, or wind and dew is highly harmful. Drinking wine and wearing realgar (*xiong huang*) is advisable.

The scripture states: Those embarking on long journeys should recite the following incantation:
*"The Six Jia of the Nine Chapters, heaven is round and earth is square.
The four seasons and five phases, the sun and moon give light.
Yu ordered the roads, Chi You warded off weapons.
The Azure Dragon guards, the White Tiger accompanies.
Mars leads the way, dispelling misfortune.
The Northern Dipper executes punishment, removing calamities.
Five spirits follow me, roaming the four directions.
Left, the gods of soil; right, the gods of grain—bandits and thieves are suppressed.
Travelers rejoice, users gain fortune.
The five phases obey me, all wishes are fulfilled.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and decree!"*

Recite this incantation three times, then spit water toward the direction of travel—this brings great fortune.

When traveling, avoid entering temples. If one must enter, do so with reverence, refraining from casual observation, as if facing a stern lord—this ensures blessings. When passing through a place of mourning, riding a white horse followed by a bearded servant brings great fortune. If one encounters a beautiful woman on the road, avoid gazing at her, for she may be a ghostly apparition.

When traveling to foreign lands, ascending mountains, or crossing waters, one must fear the harm of tigers and wolves and dread the scourge of miasmic pestilence. Whether paying respects to lords and nobles or facing bandits in battle, one should invoke the names of the gods corresponding to each day and keep them close for self-protection—thus, all evils will submit, and every journey will be greatly auspicious. If one encounters misfortune in a given year, one should clench the teeth and call upon the spirit of the year’s own celestial stem-branch and the god of the present day, invoking them throughout the year. All calamities will depart, and by maintaining this practice without cease, one will surely attain longevity.

Those who follow this Way must, on the appointed day, refrain from eating the flesh of the creature governed by that day—this brings great fortune.

To ward off weapons, one need only know the names of the Northern Dipper and the characters of the sun and moon, and one will fear no blade. Merely reciting the names of the Five Weapons will also yield divine efficacy. The sword is called *Great Chamber*, governed by the Void Star; the bow, *Curved Bow*, governed by the Earth Star; the arrow, *Fleeting Panic*, governed by the Sparkling Deluder Star; the spear, *Piercing Wound*, governed by the Horn Star; the crossbow, *Distant Gaze*, governed by the Spread Star; the halberd, *Great General*, governed by the Three Stars. Whispering these invocations before battle brings manifest results.

Alternatively, during a lunar eclipse, one may inscribe the blade with the eight characters found beneath the three-year-old toad’s tongue, using its blood—this is highly effective. Or, in the heat of combat, one may tread upon the *Kui* and *Gang* stars while calling upon the Lords of the Four Directions—this, too, proves efficacious.

Another method: On the fifth day of the fifth month, inscribe the *Red Spirit Talisman* and several dozen *Queen Mother of the West’s Military Dispatch Talismans*—all are ways to repel weapons.

Mountains, regardless of height, are inhabited by spirits. To ascend them, one must choose an auspicious time and day, hanging five-inch squares of five-colored silk from a large stone—thus, all requests will be granted. To ward off tigers, wolves, and mountain spirits, carry the *Yellow Spirit Chapter* and *Jade Spirit Talisman*, or burn ox and sheep horns. To repel vipers and serpents, wear centipedes and musk, or carry at least three *liang* of Wudu realgar—then they will not dare approach. Reciting *Yi Kang’s* verse *"Entering the mountains, I meet no tiger"* in one’s heart, or *Yi Fang’s* *"Entering the marshes, I meet no snake,"* and burning ox or sheep horns while traveling will keep tigers and wolves at bay—greatly auspicious.

Another method: Before reaching the mountain, retreat a hundred paces, then walk backward a hundred paces before ascending—all evil spirits will flee. If bitten by a snake, insert a small amount of realgar powder into the wound, and it will heal immediately.

To guard against the myriad ghosts of mountain and river shrines, always carry the *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns*, the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, the *Heavenly Water Talisman*, the *Supreme Sovereign’s Bamboo Messenger Talisman*, the *White Marsh Chart*, and the *Record of the Nine Tripods*—thus, evil will retreat of its own accord. If one constantly preserves the *True One*, no talismans or medicines are needed.

Waters, regardless of size, are perilous to cross—whether rivers, the Huai, or the sea. To fear no dragons, first break a magpie’s egg by the water’s edge, mix a small amount of its powder with incense, and stir it into the water to wash oneself—then one will fear no wind or waves. By practicing breath-holding until one can sustain a thousand breaths, one may remain underwater for long periods. Alternatively, obtain a piece of *tongtian* rhinoceros horn at least an inch long, carve it into the shape of a fish’s mouth, and hold it in the mouth when entering water—the water will part three feet, allowing one to breathe beneath the surface.

In the damp sands of the south, creatures like sand fleas and water crossbows pose great harm. Carry raw musk, spirit talismans, or golden elixirs to repel them. If one constantly preserves the *True One*, no poisons will assail them.

*The Record of Yearning for Life and Longing for Longevity* concludes.
