### **Preface to the *Xian Du Gazetteer***

Gazetteers of territorial administration trace their origins to the *Tribute of Yu* and find completion in the *Offices of Regions*. Yet while waters have their courses and commanderies their records, this *Xian Du Gazetteer* arises for such a purpose.

Xian Du, a realm of eastern splendor, is chronicled in Daoist scriptures as a grotto-heaven for prayerful transcendence. Its legacy begins with the Yellow Emperor’s emergence, flourishes under Tang foundations, and is ennobled by Song bestowals—its auspicious omens and numinous signs repeatedly gracing the sagely courts.

During the *Yanyou* era, the upright scholar Zhao Xuyi arrived bearing the imperial seal to oversee its affairs. Mountains and rivers, flora and stone, all basked in singular favor—its solitary peaks heightened, its limpid streams deepened.

Residing on the mountain, Master Chen took up his brush for this compilation, recording its transformations and marvels in exhaustive detail. Surely, this is a service to this sacred peak!

I have heard that Penglai, though glimpsed, is ever swept away by the wind, and Peach Blossom Spring, once entered, loses its path. How then can all famed mountains and great rivers be traversed by every person? Yet this work, born of direct witness, preserves the Dao within—allowing one to wander its wonders from a reclining seat.

Written on the full moon of the fifth month, *Zhizheng* 8 (*wuzǐ* year).

**Xian Du Gazetteer, Fascicle One**

Xian Du Mountain, known in antiquity as Jinyun Mountain, is listed in the Daoist canon as the twenty-ninth of the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens, named the *Xuandu Qixian Dongtian* ("Mystic Capital Grotto-Heaven of Praying Immortals"). It spans three hundred *li* in circumference and is said to be where the Yellow Emperor ascended on a fiery dragon. At its summit stands a stone chamber, traditionally held to be the gateway to the grotto-heaven.

The *Records of the Grand Historian* note that *Jinyun* was originally the name of the Yellow Emperor’s summer palace. Zhang Shoujie explains that Jinyun County in Kuai Prefecture was his enfeoffment. The *Taiping Imperial Survey* records that the Tang established Jinyun County and later renamed Kuai Prefecture as Jinyun Commandery, owing to the presence of Jinyun Mountain. The present county lies twenty-three *li* west of the mountain.

The *Illustrated Classic* recounts that on the eighth day of the sixth month in the seventh year of the *Tianbao* era (748 CE), a radiant cloud arose from the source of Li Creek, blanketing the summit of Solitary Peak in Xian Du Mountain. From within the cloud came the resonant chimes of immortal elixirs, accompanied by the flight of phoenixes and cranes. Suddenly, a chorus of "Long live the Emperor!" echoed from the mountain, and the nine neighboring peaks all responded. The clamor endured from the *shen* hour (3–5 PM) until the *hai* hour (9–11 PM) before subsiding. Prefect Miao Fengqian memorialized the event to the throne, prompting the mountain’s renaming.

Solitary Peak, also called Xian Du Stone, is described in Xie Lingyun’s *Record of Famous Mountains*: "Beside Jinyun Mountain stands a solitary stone, towering into the clouds to a height of two hundred *zhang*. Three sides overlook water, and its circumference measures one hundred and sixty *zhang* in height. At its summit lies a lake where lotuses bloom. Nearby is a crag called Stepping-in-Emptiness Mountain. From afar, it appears lower than Stepping-in-Emptiness, but upon closer inspection, Stepping-in-Emptiness is revealed to stand beneath it." The *Old Record of Dongyang* calls it Danfeng Mountain ("Cinnabar Peak"). Legend holds that the Yellow Emperor once ascended this mountain in a dragon-drawn chariot, and traces of its wheel ruts remain. From the Tang poet Bai Juyi onward, renowned scholars of past and present have left behind numerous inscriptions.

Stepping-in-Emptiness Mountain lies before Xian Du Mountain, directly opposite Yuxu Palace. Its layered ridges soar into the void, enveloped by surrounding peaks. A cluster of smaller peaks, arrayed like the Northern Dipper, is named the Dipper Crags. Xie Lingyun’s *Record of Famous Mountains* states: "Atop the central crag rises a peak several dozen *zhang* high, resembling either a lotus blossom or a ram’s horn." Local elders say the Yellow Emperor once refined elixirs here. Liu Cheng’s *Record of Mountains and Waters* calls it Jinyun Terrace, the Yellow Emperor’s alchemical site. The *Treatise on Geography* identifies Jinyun Hall as the capital of the Three Heavens. The summit is level and expansive, resembling an altar—this is the very place.

Boy’s Peak stands beside Solitary Peak, its form like a bamboo shoot. At the waist of Solitary Peak is a cavity resembling a navel, and this peak aligns with it, hence its name. The *Old Gazetteer of Kuocang* records: "Beside Solitary Peak, a sheer stone stands, called Boy’s Peak."

Fine Mountain lies west of Xian Du Mountain, to the left of Dawn Valley. During the *Shaoxing* era of the Song, Transport Commissioner Li Shiju once visited Xian Du and passed the mountain residence of the Xu family. In a poem, he wrote: "Layered mansions face upon face with Fine Mountain," from which the name derives. Later, Master Zhu Xi of Hui’an sojourned here, further enhancing its renown.

Hidden Truth Grotto is situated at the summit of Stepping-in-Emptiness Mountain, opposite Solitary Peak. The grotto’s entrance is framed by intricate rock formations resembling windows and doors. Its sheer inaccessibility makes it rarely visited. According to the *Prefectural Gazetteer*, it was the cultivation site of Master Liu Yinzhen of the Tang.

Immortal Water Grotto lies at the foot of Stepping-in-Emptiness Mountain. The *Prefectural Gazetteer* also calls it Mirror Cliff Grotto. Within, a spring emerges from a crevice in the cliff, dripping into a stone basin—its flow never ceases, even in severe drought. It was the cultivation site of Master Zhou Jingfu of the Tang, and many eminent figures have left inscribed records of their visits on its cliffs.

Golden Dragon Grotto is located east of Stepping-in-Emptiness Mountain. Two interconnected caverns within are bright and spacious. The *Old Gazetteer* states: "The grotto’s depths are unfathomable; Daoists call it a grotto-heaven." In the fourth year of the *Tianxi* era of the Song (1020 CE), a golden dragon jade tablet was cast into it.

Heavenly Hall Grotto lies east of Xian Du Mountain, to the left of Twin Dragon Grotto. Its lofty heights make it seldom visited. On the grotto’s stone wall, two circular cavities are aligned: the right is shallow, the left deep, said to be the dwelling of dragons. Prayers for rain here are always answered. Beside the grotto are two stone basins: the left holds clear water that perpetually overflows, while the right contains turbid water that sometimes recedes. They are called the Sun and Moon Springs. Behind the mountain is another grotto, commonly called Heavenly Hall Mountain. A meditation hall was built within, named *Qingxu* ("Pure Emptiness").

Forgetting-Return Grotto is situated west of Xian Du Mountain, large enough to seat dozens. Outside the grotto, a stone juts over the stream. Visitors who ascend it take in the full splendor of Xian Du, so captivating that one forgets to return—hence the name Forgetting-Return Terrace.

Dawn Valley Grotto, also called Ni Weng Grotto, overlooks Lian Creek. Its flanking cliffs are wondrously shaped, facing Solitary Peak. The *Prefectural Gazetteer* states: "The valley lies west of Xian Du Mountain. At first, it is dark and narrow, but further in, stone chambers and grotto dwellings open into spacious halls. As it faces east, it receives the first light of dawn, hence the name Dawn Valley." On the eastern cliff is an aperture the size of a basin. At dawn, sunlight streams through, casting a dazzling five-colored glow within, while outside, the clear waves shimmer like molten gold. Some claim Ni Weng Grotto lies half a *li* east of Jinyun County, but this is erroneous. During the *Jiatai* era of the Song, the prefectural scholar Chen Baipeng wrote in his *Supplementary Gazetteer*: "The grotto properly belongs to Dawn Valley beside Lian Creek in Xian Du Mountain." On the cliff are inscribed three large characters, said to be the seal script of Li Yangbing. Upon examination, the valley bears the carved characters *Chu Yang Gu* ("Dawn Valley") in regular script, and *Ni Weng Dong* ("Ni Weng Grotto") in seal script. Local elders say a certain Magistrate Ni once dwelled here, though his name is now lost. During the *Qiandao* era, Prefect Qian Yu inscribed a poem on Xian Du, writing: "Dawn Valley is none other than Fusang Valley; within the grotto, Ni Weng beckons me." Thus, it is clear that Ni Weng Grotto is Dawn Valley.

The Cloud Hall Grotto is also recorded.

The mountains here abound in grottoes and caverns, yet only six have long been renowned.

**Twin Dragons Grotto** lies east of Solitary Peak, to the left of the Temple of Numinous Moisture. A massive boulder spans the mountain stream, beneath which a hollow passage allows human passage. Even in severe droughts, its clear flow never fails. During the *Shaoxing* era of the Song, when a prolonged drought struck, Daoist Master You of Jade Clarity observed the cloud formations and came upon this spot, where two enormous serpents coiled beneath the stone, drinking without cease. He prayed for rain, and thunderstorms soon followed, drenching the entire region. Thus the grotto gained its name, and a shrine was established in its honor. To the left within the grotto lies a dark crevice that tunnels upward; once, someone entered with a torch but could not reach its end. To this day, prayers for rain here are invariably answered, and at times, flashes of lightning appear. The deep pool before the grotto is the ancient *Youlong Hong* ("Wandering Dragon Pool"), also called *Longhong Grotto*. Song scholars Hu Zhitong and Grand Academician Wang Shipeng both composed poems in its praise.

**Crouching Tiger Crag** stands west of Solitary Peak, to the right of the academy. A small stone mountain resembles a crouching tiger, also known as *Zhushi* ("Perched Lion") Crag.

**Soaring Luan Peak** rises south of Solitary Peak, to the left of the Waveling Pavilion. At its summit, two stones take the form of *luan* and crane, wings spread as if in flight—hence its popular name, *Yacha* ("Forked") Crag.

**Numinous Tortoise Stone** lies north of Solitary Peak, beside the boundary marker of Xian Du. At the mountain’s base, a massive boulder stands upright, shaped like a great tortoise with head raised. Locals gauge its dryness or dampness to predict rain or shine.

**Little Penglai** sits below Lian Creek. According to the *Prefectural Gazetteer*, it lies west of Xian Du. At the heart of its pool is a small isle, strewn with strange rocks and rare trees. To the south, a stone cliff rises some hundred *ren* high, where eminent officials carved poems on the rock to commemorate its scenic beauty. Visitors who row in by boat feel as though they have entered the fairy realms of Penglai. Minister Lou Yue of Siming inscribed *Little Penglai* in large characters on a stele, which was once sheltered by a pavilion—now in ruins. Nearby stands **Clasped Palms Grotto**, spacious enough for dozens. High on the cliff face, over ten cavities align like strung beads, called **Great Bead Crag**. To the east rises another crag, broad above and narrow below, known as **Rain Cape Crag**.

**Little Red Cliff** stands above the Riverstone Pool. The *Prefectural Gazetteer* places it east of Xian Du: a sheer cliff rises by the stream, nearly a thousand *chi* high, its peaks and ridges strangely elegant. Beneath the cliff, a hollow opens into a deep, limpid pool of unfathomable depth. Boating here feels far removed from the mortal world. A short distance downstream, another crag bears the same name. Minister He Dan of the prefecture inscribed *Little Red Cliff* in stone upon the cliff face. Though the locations differ, the names coincide, so both are recorded here.

**Immortal and Monk Crag** lies on the western bank of Little Red Cliff. Stones stand tall and dense along the stream’s edge, some resembling the figures of immortals or Buddhist monks. Much of Jade Clarity Mountain’s land lies nearby, and ancient records often used *Immortal Stone* as a boundary marker.

**Yellow Vulture Red Crag** stands on the eastern slope of Xian Du Mountain. A cliff rises steeply, stretching dozens of *xun*, its cavities and hollows vivid with five-colored hues. From afar, it resembles brocade; up close, it glows like sunset clouds. Today, locals have established a farming community at its base.

**Celestial Master Crag** faces Red Crag across the way. At its base lies a grotto large enough for twenty people, with a dark crevice leading straight down to the stream. Elders say that in times of drought, people would come here to request incense from the ancestral temple of the Perfected True Protector of the Realm, Celestial Master, and their prayers were answered. A hall was built before the grotto, hence its name. Later, the hall’s foundations were swept away by water, yet villagers still face the grotto in worship.

**Eastern Meng Crag** stands to the left of Dawn Valley. Strange stones rise and fall along the edge of a deep pool, where boats may navigate. Beyond the sea lies an immortal mountain called *Eastern Meng*. The southern mountain of Mount Tai is also named *Eastern Meng*, though the origin of this crag’s name remains unclear. Some say the crag faces east, and as the sun rises, water and light intertwine, giving it the name *Eastern Meng*—also reflecting the meaning of *Dawn Valley*. It is uncertain which explanation is correct.

**Jade Rice Crag** lies to the right of Dawn Valley. Halfway up the mountain, a stone juts out like a mound of rice. Below the crag is a cave resembling a turtle’s mouth; when rain approaches, mist rises from the rock like steam from cooking, and when the stream surges, the cave emits sounds like a boiling cauldron. The *Old Gazetteer of Kuocang* calls it *Azure Cloud Grotto*, also known as *Zhang Gong’s Favor*, though its origins are unknown.

**Yang Lang Grotto** lies behind Dawn Valley, beside the post road. The grotto has two levels, upper and lower, with space for over twenty people. Elders say a certain Yang Lang once lived here, healing travelers with talismans and medicines. Later generations, in remembrance, built a shrine within.

**Immortal Crag Grotto** lies north of Fine Mountain, above Immortal Crag Market. Halfway up the mountain is a grotto, deep and spacious, capable of holding over a hundred people. Today, locals have established a farming community within.

**Cloud-Ladder Grotto** stands west of Xian Du Mountain, facing Rain Cape Crag. A hollow beneath the crag resembles steps, ascending from the mountain’s base to its midsection for over sixty *zhang*, also called *Long Pavilion*. In its deeper recesses, locals once built houses, now in ruins.

**Ding Lake** is the lake atop Solitary Peak, where lotuses once grew. From the Tang and Song dynasties onward, eminent officials’ poems and inscriptions all refer to it as *Ding Lake*.

**Lianjin Creek** originates from Great Basin Mountain and is called *Lianjin* ("Gold-Refining") upon reaching Xian Du. Stones in the water connect seamlessly to the base of Solitary Peak, smooth as whetstone. The banks face each other across over thirty *zhang*, yet the water is only a *chi* deep. According to the *Prefectural Gazetteer*, the village in Xian Du is called *Lianjin Village*, the stream *Lianjin Creek*, and the ford *Lianjin Wave*, though their origins remain unrecorded.

According to Tang dynasty’s Wei Jia in his *Inscription of Mount Xiandu*: "Cinnabar caves rise beside it; golden streams flow below." Also, from the *Mysterious Ruins Record* by Master Hidden Truth of the Tang: "By Lianjin Creek’s banks, one may wash their cap strings." Thus, the name *Lianjin* is ancient indeed.

**Jinhua Pool** lies in the deep reaches below Lianjin Creek. Local elders say that petals from the golden lotuses of Ding Lake once drifted here, hence its name. **Lian Creek**, further downstream from Jinhua Pool, shimmers like raw silk, thus its name. According to the *Prefectural Gazetteer*, it lies west of Xiandu, before the Chaoyang Valley Grotto. In its waters are imprints of giant footprints, hoofmarks of dogs and horses, and a stone well of unfathomable depth.

**Cinnabar Well** stands at the southwest corner of Jade Treasury’s main hall. Master Hidden Truth once drew its water to refine elixirs. To this day, its spring remains clear and sweet, warm in winter and cool in summer, never drying even in drought nor overflowing in flood.

**Jade Spring Pool** lies below Double Dragon Cave, its waters pure as jade. **Release Pool**, outside Jade Void Palace, is fed by the broad and deep ravine waters and has long served as a place for releasing living creatures. Another such pool exists before Miao Ting Abbey.

**Heavenly Pond** sits atop the mountain behind Heavenly Hall Cave, never drying in winter or summer.

**Comb-Water Weaving** is a single slab of stone in the great stream above Little Penglai, spanning over thirty *xun* between its banks. When waters recede, the remaining flow parts around it for passage. Locals call it *Bridal Sedan Rock*.

**Mallet-Head Stone** lies in Lianjin Creek, named for its resemblance.

**Temples and Abbeys**
**Jade Void Palace** stands in the heart of Mount Xiandu, the very site of the Mystic Capital’s Grotto-Heaven where the Yellow Emperor ascended to immortality. In the *Wuzi* year of Tianbao (748 CE), due to auspicious omens of colored clouds and immortal music above Solitary Peak, Prefect Miao Fengqian memorialized the throne. The emperor decreed Xiandu Mountain a sacred precinct, forbidding logging, hunting, or fishing within its three hundred *li* circumference. A shrine to the Yellow Emperor was built, and seven Daoist priests were annually ordained to tend its incense fires. In the *Yisi* year of Zhiping (1065 CE), the Song court bestowed its present name. In the *Gengzi* year of Xuanhe (1120 CE), it was destroyed by bandits.

Daoist priest You Dacheng, upon the former foundations, once more planned its reconstruction. At that time, the abbey faced east with its back to the west, but practitioners of yin-yang arts declared that this resembled a tiger’s glare and that the orientation violated ritual propriety. Thus, in the *Gengshen* year of Jingding (1260 CE), Prefect An Liu, by imperial decree, commanded Daoist priest Chen Guanding to relocate and reorient the abbey. In less than a year, the work was completed.

In the *Gengshen* year of Yanyou (1319 CE), Daoist priest Zhao Siqi received an imperial commission, bearing the seal and robes bestowed by the throne as *Tidian* (Supervisor) of Jade Void Palace at Mount Xiandu in Chuzhou Circuit, a fifth-rank office overseeing the abbey’s affairs. He further received an imperial edict for its protection, restoring its proper cosmic alignment, and was granted official placards by the Jixian Institute, the Celestial Master and Orthodox Unity Sect’s Grand Master of the Dao, and the Grand Preceptor and Supreme Minister, Great Patriarch of the Mystic Teaching, each to be perpetually observed. From this time forth, the abbey’s gates regained their former dignity.

The abbey’s halls and structures are listed below:

**Hall of the Golden Portal and Luminous Yang**, its plaque inscribed by Ye Sichang of the prefecture.
**Shrine of the Yellow Emperor**, its plaque in seal script by Li Yangbing, magistrate of Jinyun County during the Tang.
**Hall of the Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel Repository**, established in the *Jimao* year of Qiandao (1169 CE) by Daoist priest Li Boxiang, its scale grand and elegant, its plaque inscribed by Chen Yi of the prefecture.
**Palace of Heavenly Unity and True Felicity**.
**Hall of the Three Primes and Three Officials**.

**Shrine of the Divine Lord of Zitong**.
**Shrine of the Grotto-Heaven Immortals**.
**Shrine of the Jade Purity Perfected Official**.
**Hall of the Flourishing Teachings**, its plaque inscribed by He Chuan of the prefecture.
**Hall of Hidden Perfection**, its plaque inscribed by Han Yongxi; Wu Jun once left a poem here. Now it enshrines images of the immortals Zhong and Lü. The abbot’s chamber plaque reads: *#1 Heaven Unfolds a Painting*, inscribed at age nine by Zhu Huang, fifth-generation descendant of Master Wen.
**Hall of Wind and Rain**, its plaque inscribed by Zhao Mengfu of Wuxing.
**Golden Lotus Pavilion**, its plaque inscribed by Yu Ji of Shu Commandery.
**Gate of the Jade Purity Palace**, its seal-script plaque by Zhao Ting of Dongyang.
**Gate of the Grotto-Heaven for Invoking Immortals**, its seal-script plaque by Qian Shueyou of the county.
**Gate of Mount Xiandu**, its plaque inscribed by Zhao Mengfu.
**Pavilion of a Fleeting Cloud**, named after Bai Juyi’s poem *A Fleeting Cloud and a Solitary Stone*.
**Pavilion of the Returning Waves**, situated above the Golden Flower Pool, its plaque inscribed by He Zongyao of the prefecture.
**Veranda of Xiandu’s Transformation**.
**Veranda of Vying Splendor**.
**Veranda of Gathering Fragrance**.
**Veranda of Refining Jade**.
**Pavilion of the Perching Crane**, located outside the Grotto-Heaven Gate.
**Pavilion of Reflecting Waters**, situated above the Release Life Pond.
**Pavilion of Forgetting Return**, before the Cave of Forgetting Return.
**Temple of the Wondrous Court**, on the eastern slope of Mount Xiandu, above the Golden Dragon Grotto. Built in the first year of *Chengtong* (860 CE) by the Recluse Master Liu of Hidden Perfection, who also constructed the *Mystic Wasteland* behind it. In the third year of *Qianfu* (876 CE), his disciple Zhu Huisi petitioned the court for a temple plaque, which was granted the name *Xiandu*. In the first year of *Jingfu* (892 CE), Luo Yin of Jiangdong composed its record. In the second year of *Zhiping* (1065 CE) of the Song, it was renamed as it is today. In the first year of *Huangqing* (1312 CE) of the Yuan, the Daoist priest Chen Huaiyu of Mystic Wonder and Preserved Perfection reverently received an imperial edict restoring its rank as *Jia Yi* (First-Second Grade), with hereditary incense offerings, thereby reviving its prosperity.

**Academy of the Solitary Peak**, west of the Lianjin Stream, directly facing the Solitary Peak. In the *Renyin* year of *Chunxi* (1182 CE) of the Song, Master Zhu Xi of Huian, bearing the credentials of the Ever-Normal Granary, submitted a memorial impeaching the prefectural governor but received no response. He lingered in these mountains awaiting the imperial decree, remarking that this would be a fitting place for secluded cultivation. In the *Wuzi* year of *Shaoding* (1228 CE), Ye Sichang, Duke of the State of the prefecture, first established a ritual hall here as a place for lectures and discourse. In the *Dingmao* year of *Xianchun* (1277 CE), Qian Shueyou, Minister of the county, expanded it upon the old site. The entire foundation is part of Mount Yuxu.

**Temple of Numinous Blessings**, before the Double Dragon Grotto, dedicated to the spirit of the Double Dragons. The *Prefectural Gazetteer* states: In the seventh year of *Xianchun* (1271 CE) of the Song, Magistrate Chen Shaoru prayed for rain and received a response; he reported this to the throne and was granted an imperial plaque for the temple. To this day, when the local gentry and commoners pray for rain, their pleas are invariably answered. The old temple was quite cramped, and it has since been regularly renovated.

**Temple of Marquis Zhao**, west of Mount Xiandu, beside the Ladder Cloud Grotto. According to the *Prefectural Gazetteer*, the temple is in Xiandu Township, and the entire region reveres it. The marquis was Zhao Bing of the Later Han. Before the temple lies a stone resembling a boat; the *Prefectural Gazetteer* notes: There is a stone like a vessel, commonly called *Marquis Zhao’s Boat*, while others resemble a staff, shoes, or jars, all named after the marquis. According to the *Biographies of Magicians* in the *History of the Eastern Han*, Zhao Bing, styled Gong’a, was a native of Dongyang. Skilled in southern magic, he valued purity and frugality, offering libations to spirits with east-flowing water, dried mulberry bark as jerky, and curing illnesses with remarkable efficacy. He later entered Zhang’an (present-day Taizhou), where the people revered him as a deity. After his death, a shrine was established in his honor. To this day, mosquitoes and gnats do not enter it. Another commentary states: The original shrine of Bing was in Yongkang County of Muzhou, commonly called the *Temple of Marquis Zhao*. In the Jiangnan region, the *Zhao Hou Prohibitive Methods* for healing illnesses are still transmitted, and it is said that the present *Zhengyi* lineage’s altars bestow the *Zhao Hou Prohibitive Qi Registers*—this refers to the so-called *Zhao Hou Prohibitive Masters*. Astrologers also speak of the *Zhao Hou Transformation Day*. Further, according to the *Dongyang Gazetteer*, the *Temple of the Marquis of Wushang* in Yongkang County is dedicated to Zhao Bing of the Later Han, with accounts matching those in the histories. The *County Records* state: He served the Han as Grand General. The temple has no stele or inscription for reference, only the ancient clerical-script characters *Temple of the Marquis of Wushang*. The *Prefectural Gazetteer* also mentions the *Temple of Numinous Well-Being* in Qingtian County, which is the Temple of Marquis Zhao of Jinyun County. Originally, the marquis’s temple received offerings at White Crane Mountain in Linhai County of Taizhou. In the seventh year of *Yuanfeng* (1084 CE) of the Song, it was granted the plaque *Spirit of Accumulated Seals, Numinous Favor, Manifest Protection, Vast Benevolence, Majestic and Mighty King*. Now, considering the historical evolution of Jinyun: In the first year of *Shengli* (698 CE) of the Tang, the territory of present-day Lishui (formerly Kuocang County) and Yongkang County was divided to establish Jinyun County. This temple is only half a league from the Yongkang border. Upon examination, this land was indeed part of ancient Yongkang. The deity’s numinous efficacy is omnipresent, and though neighboring counties also have shrines, none are as distinguished as this temple, which possesses stone images as a testament. To this day, the temple remains free of mosquitoes and gnats, the region produces no leeches or conches, and prayers for relief from floods, droughts, plagues, and epidemics are invariably answered. Is this not the ancestral temple? Among the immortals: **Master Jing Fuzhou**, a Daoist of Xiandu.

In the Tang *Dali* era (766–779 CE), he dwelt within the Immortal Waters Grotto, practicing grain avoidance and meditative repose for over a hundred years before ascending as an immortal. Today, the Jade Void Palace preserves a stone inscription bearing Lu Guimeng’s poem and preface, titled *Mirror Cliff: Abode of Master Zhou*, which may be consulted. Here follows the text:

Within the Immortal Capital Mountain of Chuzhou, a cavern lies halfway up its slope. Gazing down, it resembles a mirror—hence its name, Mirror Cliff. The grotto stands two hundred feet above the earth, accessible only by bamboo ladder. Its interior spans a square *zhang*, where stalactite water drips ceaselessly. The Yellow Emperor’s disciple, Master Zhou Jingfu, resided here. For eighty years, he consumed no grain, burning only a censer of *jiangzhen* incense each day while reciting the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation*. When Lord Duan Ke of Dongmou served as prefect of the region, he heard of Master Zhou’s renown and ascended the ladder to visit him. “You have dwelt here long,” he remarked. “Can you measure the stalactite water that drips day and night?” Master Zhou replied, “I have estimated it: over a full day and night, it amounts to one *hu* and a half.” The lord marveled and treated him with reverence. Thirteen years after parting, a traveler from Chuzhou reported that Master Zhou still lived. Longing to glimpse his Dao but finding no means, Lord Duan composed a poem in tribute:

*I hear your body is lighter than cranes,*
*Your stone chamber silent, shared only with clouds.*
*At dawn, you carve fragrant aloeswood;*
*At night, you chant alone from celestial scriptures.*
*Ten caves’ essences you’ve inhaled in full;*
*Your autumn hair, unkempt, remains unbrushed.*
*Knowing you’ll soon join the Suspended Pearl Assembly,*
*I wonder when you’ll ride east on a white carp.*

Pi Rixiu, Gentleman for Literary Composition, responded with a matching poem:

*Eighty years dwelling in Mirror Cliff,*
*Beneath a deer-hide cap, your form like snow.*
*Though your bed chills with clouds coiled round the pillow,*
*What harm if scriptures dampen from dripping stalactites?*
*Apes at the stream pause to peer into the abyss;*
*Visitors on the green ladder rest by perilous pines.*
*Why must petty clerks, like crows, remain earthbound?*
*I long to hoist sail toward the Immortal Capital.*

The *Old Anthology of Kuocang* records the same text as the stone inscription.

**Recluse Liu, Master of Hidden Reality**, named Chujing, styled Daoyou, hailed from Pengcheng in Peiguo. His ancestors had fled to Suichang and settled there. Though his family pursued Confucian scholarship, the Master was precocious from childhood, well-versed in the classics, and traveled among famous mountains. There, he encountered a perfected being who transmitted to him the Dao of exhalation and inhalation. Once summoned to court and granted a purple robe, he retired to Hidden Reality Cliff on Immortal Capital Mountain, where he built a hut beside the Golden Dragon Grotto—today’s Wondrous Court Abbey. His disciples numbered in the hundreds, and seekers from afar arrived daily without fail. When his followers wished to sculpt his likeness, a wine-loving Daoist appeared and completed the task. The Master detained him for ten days of feasting, then gifted him thirty *zhu* of gold upon his departure. As they parted before the Golden Dragon Grotto, the Daoist instructed, “When you return, look beneath your inkstone.” Upon doing so, he found a slip of paper inscribed:

*You gave me gold; I grant you truth:*
*Truth embraces form; form perfects spirit.*

Beneath lay the gold, untouched. At once enlightened, the Master prepared a transcendent tomb behind his hut, guarding his resolve. On the *xinyou* day of the sixth month in the fourteenth year of *Xiantong* (873 CE), he shed his mortal form. That same day, he was posthumously enfeoffed as Prefect of the Mystic Tomb. Lu Qinguang eulogized his statue:

*Essence of utmost numinosity,*
*Abyss of the Great Dao—*
*Its simplicity unscattered,*
*Its spirit wholly preserved.*
*Alas, worldly men,*
*Driven by desires, toil endlessly,*
*So their primordial embryo*
*Flees in the blink of an eye.*
*Only the Master, serene and untroubled,*
*Dissolved ten thousand cares.*
*Not a single thing*
*Could deceive his perfect truth.*
*Even his form and qi*
*Required a cocoon’s release—*
*How then could a clay effigy*
*Embody the divine man?*

Years later, a villager encountered him in the Xiang-Han region and relayed the news to his disciples. They opened the tomb to find only his staff and sandals. Both episodes confirm his deliverance as a *shijie* immortal. His empty tomb remains behind Wondrous Court Abbey. Another eulogy for his statue reads:

*Returning to the One, boundless,*
*His spirit transcends spirit.*
*This sculpted image remains,*
*Yet it is not the Master’s truth.*
*The Master’s truth*
*Transcends this body,*
*Emerging from being, entering nonbeing,*
*None may draw near.*

**Recluses**
Immortal Capital, a grotto-heaven for seeking transcendence, has never lacked lofty-minded recluses through the ages.

Since before the Xuanhe era of the Song, Jade Void Palace suffered from banditry, and its earlier history cannot be verified. Thereafter, figures such as You Dacheng frequently propagated the teachings, enhancing the mountain’s prestige. Their profound virtue and pure renown are here recorded in summary.

You Dacheng, a native of Lecheng, single-handedly restored the palace after its destruction by bandits. He carried forward the former legacy, enlightening later disciples, and was particularly skilled in the art of geomancy. He chose his burial site on a branch mountain of Immortal Capital, vowing: *"My descendants, generation after generation, shall inherit this calling and become teachers of heaven and humanity."* His words proved prophetic—his lineage endured for eight generations until the end of the Song, when his tomb was encroached upon by local settlers and the You clan nearly vanished.

Lou Dadu and Huang Jiansu, both natives of the prefecture, vigorously propagated the true Daoist teachings, widely promoting the mysteries of the Way. Li Boxiang, a man of Jianchuan, embodied an ancient and lofty Daoist spirit, expanding the construction of the Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel, unmatched in the eastern Zhe region. Liu Yanyong of Shaowei petitioned for the remission of excessive taxes, while Wu Ruochong, his fellow disciple, was recognized for his meritorious service in the Daoist arts.

Hong Duanben, styled Gaoxi; Ye Baohe, styled Zhujian; Zhan Xuyi, styled Ji’an; and Chen Guanding, styled Chushan—all natives of Lishui—formed a four-generation lineage of master and disciple. Inheriting the orthodox transmission of the Great Dao, they became leaders of the Daoist community. Master Chushan, in particular, altered the orientation of the palace halls, leaving many notable achievements.

Lin Tianren, styled Hengzhou, a native of Kunyang, was once appointed *Xiuzhi Lang*. Witnessing the vicissitudes of time, he turned his heart to the study of the Dao. He compiled Daoist scriptures, refined liturgical texts, and frequently conducted grand Yellow Register fasts. On one occasion during an alchemical ritual, he manifested a divine presence—radiant light in nine hues filled the walls, and in an instant, heaven and earth became luminous, visible to all the people.

Xie Tianyu, styled Langu, a native of Jinhua, was deeply devoted to the Daoist arts and greatly advanced the lineage’s teachings. Whether praying for rain or dispelling drought, summoning thunder to strike unworthy temples, he accomplished all without raising his voice, as if answers came in echo. His reputation endures to this day.

Xu Yuanshan, styled Zilin, a native of Lishui, was a Daoist of Jade Void Palace. During the Jingding era of the Song, he was summoned to court to pray for snow. Taking a white brush, he inscribed a five-petaled design on blue paper and presented it, declaring: *"By the hour of chen tomorrow, snow will fall—all in five-petaled flakes."* When the appointed time arrived, it came to pass. He was granted the title *Master of Purple Tenuity and Benevolent Aid*.

The events are recorded in the prefectural gazetteer.

During the Yuan dynasty, the Celestial Master was summoned for his virtuous character, and his Dao was honored, allowing him to oversee Jade Void Palace to nurture longevity. In the *dade* year of *jiachen*, without illness, Xu Yuanshan transformed, leaving behind a farewell verse: *"I was originally a transcendent of Penglai, having dwelt in the world for seventy-nine years. Laughing, I point toward Dinghu to return—gazing into the cavern heavens, even the azure sky cannot hold me."*

Zhao Sicheck, styled Xuyi, a native of Longquan, studied the Dao at Jade Void Palace in his youth. In maturity, he wandered through famous mountains and twice sought instruction from Perfected Master Du of Nangu. When he journeyed to the imperial capital, eminent officials and high ministers all held him in reverence. He was granted an imperial commission, bestowed a seal, and appointed to a fifth-rank position as abbot—this was the true beginning of such appointments. He was repeatedly entrusted with imperial incense, dispatched by post to regions including Huai, Shu, Jing, Xiang, Jiang, Zhe, Huguang, Min, Hai, and Sibo. Later, he resided at Dayuanxing Yongshou Palace in Jiqing, Shengyuan Abbey on Jichou Mountain in Huzhou, Baihe Abbey in Pingjiang, and was repeatedly honored with imperial decrees, receiving the title *Master of Mysterious Clarity, Dao-Pervading, and Void Unity, Perfected Adept of the Teachings*. In the winter of the *gengchen* year following *zhiyuan*, he transformed at Baihe Abbey, and his sword and sandals were interred at Jichou.

Li Dening, styled Shouyi, a native of Kuocheng, once served as vice-director of Daoist affairs in Sanqu and deputy overseer of Jade Void Palace for over forty years, taking the restoration of dilapidation and the rectification of abuses as his personal duty. In the *gengyin* year of *zhiyuan*, his merit in exempting taxes was prominently displayed. On the *yimao* day of the first month in the *yiyou* year of *zhizheng*, he suddenly called for brush and paper, writing a farewell verse: *"Embracing virtue in tranquility, preserving unity to achieve perfection—sky empty, moon bright, I roam freely in the Upper Clarity."* Having written this, he cast aside the brush and transformed. The grasses and trees...

The Golden Lotus Flower, according to the *Prefectural Gazetteer*, grows in a lake atop the stone summit of Xiandu Mountain, where a solitary rock thrusts into the sky. Local elders tell that golden lotus petals once drifted down from above. Dragon’s Beard Grass thrives on the cliffs of Solitary Peak. The old *Gazetteer* records: when the Yellow Emperor ascended in a dragon-drawn chariot, his ministers clung to the dragon’s whiskers as it rose; the whiskers fell and transformed into this grass. The Ancient Longevity Pines stand at the summit of Solitary Peak, their trunks thick enough to embrace, evergreen through all seasons—proof of the deep moisture of Solitary Peak’s Cauldron Lake.

Among the flora, many serve as medicinal herbs. Mountain hermits and rustic elders gather them, though their forms and flavors differ, and few know their names. Now, following the *Materia Medica*, we list below those species recorded therein—though not all are native to this land nor grow in abundance—to showcase the fine beauty of this renowned mountain:

*Polygonatum*, *Acorus*, chrysanthemum, *Asparagus cochinchinensis*, *Ophiopogon japonicus*, *Plantago* seed, *Rehmannia*, *Achyranthes*, *Dioscorea*, *Coix*, *Morinda*, *Trichosanthes* root, *Dendrobium*, *Eupatorium*, *Selaginella*, *Gentiana*, *Inula*, *Senecio*, *Paeonia*, *Artemisia*, *Trachelospermum*, *Artemisia capillaris*, *Mosla*, *Tripterygium*, indigo, *Sedum*, *Pueraria* root, *Solanum lyratum*, *Epimedium*, *Clematis*, *Sophora flavescens*, *Angelica sinensis*, *Tetrapanax*, *Dichroa*, *Polygonum multiflorum*, *Lonicera*, *Paeonia lactiflora*, *Dianthus*, *Cibotium*, *Euchresta*, *Pharbitis*, *Anethum*, lily, *Imperata* root, *Dioscorea hypoglauca*, *Ricinus*, *Phymatodes*, *Arisaema*, *Curculigo*, *Anemarrhena*, mugwort, *Aristolochia*, *Valeriana*, *Artemisia anomala*, *Siegesbeckia*, *Pinellia*, *Isatis*, *Clinopodium*, *Cyperus* root, *Eriocaulon*, *Drynaria*, *Trichosanthes cucumeroides*, *Belamcanda*, *Ampelopsis*, *Euphorbia lathyris*, *Celosia* seed, *Rubus*, *Phytolacca*, *Siegesbeckia*, *Carpesium*, *Hemerocallis* root, *Prunella*, *Xanthium*, *Lycoperdon*, *Eupatorium*, *Skimmia*, *Placenta hominis*, *Schisandra*, *Aquilaria*, *Euphorbia pekinensis*, *Vaccaria*, *Stephania*, *Syringa*, *Rumex*, *Cirsium* root, *Asarum*, *Aconitum*, duckweed, *Elsholtzia*, *Perilla*, *Euonymus*, *Mentha*, *Equisetum*, *Oenanthe*, *Houttuynia*, *Abutilon*, *Commelina*, *Tribulus*, *Boehmeria*, *Zizania*, *Typha*, *Miscanthus*, *Musa* root, *Verbena*, *Kochia*, *Euphorbia*, *Artemisia stelleriana*, *Platycodon*, *Duchesnea*, *Eclipta*, *Aconitum*, pine resin, maple resin, *Firmiana* seed, *Acanthopanax*, *Lycium* bark, *Morus* bark, *Broussonetia* fruit, *Sophora* fruit, *Quercus* fruit, *Galla chinensis*, *Lycium* fruit, *Prunus japonica* seed, *Lindera*, *Phellodendron*, *Evodia*, *Cornus*, *Rosa laevigata*, *Melia*, *Gleditsia*, *Melia azedarach*, *Melia azedarach* (repeated), *Melia* flower, *Vitex*, *Photinia*, *Uncaria*, *Gardenia*, *Sapium*, *Cudrania*, *Salix*, *Zanthoxylum*, *Toxicodendron*, *Cunninghamia*, rice, millet, *Dolichos*, *Vigna angularis*, mung bean, barley, wheat, sesame, *Papaver*, pear, jujube, lotus seed, *Euryale*, pomegranate peel, *Castanea* burr, peach kernel, plum, persimmon calyx, *Actinidia*, loquat leaf, onion seed, lettuce, *Sonchus*, water celery, *Eleocharis*, alfalfa, *Artemisia*, mustard, garlic, leek, shepherd’s purse.

Carved steles and inscribed verses accompany the Temple of the Yellow Emperor, where four large characters are engraved upon the stone.

The Tang dynasty magistrate of Jinyun, Li Yangbing, inscribed in seal script. The stele originally stood behind the Jade Void Palace but was later transported by county residents to the local academy. During the Qingli era, the *Record of the Academy* composed by Tun Suizhan was engraved on its reverse—this stone remains extant today.

The Tang dynasty’s Wei Jia composed the *Inscription of Mount Xiandu*, with seal script by Qian Shuyou (a Song dynasty figure). The Tang dynasty prefect Li Jizhen authored another *Inscription of Mount Xiandu*, with seal script by Zhao Bi’yuan (a former Song figure). The Tang poet Lu Guimeng’s *Poem on Mirror Cliff and the Abode of Master Zhou, with Preface*. In the second year of the Zhiping era of the Song, the Jade Void Palace was renamed by imperial decree, with the edict and ministry documents carved in stone.

Wu Shuo of Qiantang’s *Account of Accompanying Prefect Liu Dazhong on an Excursion to Mount Xiandu*. Sub-prefect Ding Zongdan’s *Poem on the Jade Void Palace at Mount Xiandu*. Prefect Xie Ji’s *Poem in Response to Transport Commissioner Li Shiju*. The county native Xiang Ying’s *Record of the Jade Void Palace’s Exemption from Taxes and Corvée*. The Hanlin Academician and Minister Zou Jingchu’s *Poem on Visiting the Jade Void Palace, with Postscript*. The Registrar of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices Wu Dashao’s *Poem for the Magistrate Zhan Xuyi*. Du Huizhi’s *Account of a Journey to Mount Xiandu*. Prefect Zhao Bi’yuan’s *Account of a Journey to Mount Xiandu*. Prefect An Liu’s *Petition to Alter the Palace’s Orientation*. The county native Qian Shuyou’s *Record of the Reconstruction of the Jade Void Palace*. The county magistrate Wu Zuwen’s *Poem on Solitary Peak*. Chen Renyu of Xianju’s *Poem on Visiting Mount Xiandu*, with his younger brother, the county magistrate Shao’ruo’s *Postscript*. All the above, from Wu Shuo of Qiantang to the magistrate Shao’ruo, were figures of the Song dynasty.

During the Yuan dynasty, the magistrate of Jinyun, Shi Gu, and the emissary Xie Lei, along with Xu Yuanjin, composed *Poems on Praying for Rain*. The Yuan dynasty’s imperial edicts for the protection of the Jade Void Palace, including the full texts of the primary and secondary *Jia* and *Yi* documents, were carved in stone. All the above are located at the Jade Void Palace.

The *Stele Record of the Mystic Ruins* by the Recluse Master Liu. The Yuan dynasty’s imperial edicts for the protection of Miaoting Abbey, including the full texts of the primary and secondary *Jia* and *Yi* documents, were carved in stone. All the above are located at Miaoting Abbey.

The transport commissioner Ye Qingchen composed the *Inscription of Solitary Peak*, carved into the cliff at its base. During the Qingli era, Transport Commissioner Ma Xun; during the Huangyou era, Transport Commissioner Su Shun; during the Yuanfeng era, the Grand Guardian Zhao Qingxian; and over forty other renowned officials of past and present recorded the dates of their mountain excursions, all carved into the cliff at the Immortal’s Water Grotto. During the Qingli era, the county deputy Mao Weizhan accompanied Transport Commissioner Liu Yu on an excursion to Mount Xiandu, with his account carved into the cliff at the foot of Mount Buxu.

During the Jiayou era, Shen Shen of Kuaiji; during the Xuanhe era, Liu Changqing of Kaifeng; during the Shaoxing era, Yu Siping of Qiantang; and over twenty other renowned officials of past and present recorded the dates of their mountain excursions, all carved into the cliff at the Valley of First Dawn. During the Shaoxing era, Guo Qifu, Jiang Shanzhao, Zhao Shanfu, and Yang Jing were dispatched by imperial decree to *Record the Prayer for Rain at Mount Xiandu*, carved into the cliff at Mirror Cliff. During the Jiading era, Liu Yuangang, Guo Leiqing, and others’ *Account of a Journey to Mount Xiandu* was carved into the cliff outside the Valley of First Dawn.

The three characters "Little Penglai" were inscribed by Lou Lun of Mingzhou, with a stele erected in the mountains. The county native Huang Bangyan’s *Poem on Solitary Peak* was carved into the cliff at Boy’s Peak. The county magistrate Wang Tan’s *Song of Little Penglai* was carved into the cliff. All the above, from Vice Transport Commissioner Ye Qingchen to County Magistrate Wang Tan, were figures of the Song dynasty.

The three regular-script characters "Immortal’s Water Cliff" were carved into the cliff within the grotto. The three large regular-script characters "Valley of First Dawn" were carved into the cliff within the valley. The three seal-script characters "Master Ni’s Grotto"—some say inscribed by Li Yangbing—were carved into the cliff before the grotto. The three seal-script characters "Hidden Truth Grotto," "Golden Dragon Grotto," the three clerical-script characters "Heavenly Hall Grotto," and the three regular-script characters "Forgetting Return Grotto" were all carved into their respective grottoes.

The inscriptions and records of the mountain’s steles and cliff carvings have been noted above; below are excerpts of their texts. All poems and compositions by ancient and modern renowned figures are published separately.

**Inscription of Mount Xiandu**
Composed by Wei Xiang of the Tang

Lofty stands the Immortal’s Capital,
Towering above all peaks, rivaling Mount Song.
Erect to the right, hewn in the east,
It rises from the earth, straight and square,
Scraping the heavens, vast and high.
A sacred pool crowns its summit,
Auspicious clouds gather within.
A jade altar soars a thousand fathoms,
A pillar upholding the four bounds.
The eye cannot reach its end,
Nor can winged flight traverse its expanse.
Myriad hills hasten in obeisance,
Where immortals convene in assembly.
The Yellow Emperor once sought it,
Piercing the azure ridges.
Cinnabar caves rise beside it,
Golden streams flow below.
Sunlight kindles the rosy clouds,
Moonlight dissolves the mist.
Its soil is untouched by dust,
Its trees host no wandering flocks.
Dwelling in seclusion yet unobscured,
Holding to the One, it stands mighty.
Echoing the ten thousand ages,
The nine harmonies resound in emptiness.
A propitious name returns,
Grand rites are here performed.
To record and admonish,
To pray and commune in gratitude.
None is higher than compassion,
The work of Creation itself.
The primordial chaos shaped its form,
The fertile earth nurtured its spirit.
Crowned among mountains,
Solitary and towering.
Standing tall to pierce the heavens,
Its vapors swirl in the azure void.
Mists congeal at the cinnabar caves,
Rosy clouds streak the cloud-screen.
Above, it grates the nine heavens,
Beside, it obstructs the five stars.
The dragon’s beard remains unseen,
The phoenix’s pipes are heard at times.
Descending from the sacred and martial,
Seeking it without rest.
Vainly hearing of desolate governance,
Never prolonging life.
Things possess their distinctions,
Thus the ancients inscribed this.
Here I engrave these words,
A beacon for Jinyun.

**Inscription of Mount Xiandu**
Composed by Zhang Lu

Mount Xiandu possesses a mountain,
A mountain among ten thousand mountains.
It ascends a thousand fathoms,
Lost in the depths of mist and clouds.
Round as a measuring tool,
Lofty, piercing the clouded shade.
A landmark for the realm below,
The origin of the Emperor’s image.
Is it the sun? Is it the moon?
Ten thousand things, a thousand years.
The great eastern bulwark,
Guarded by rivers and marshes on four sides.
Creation knows no bounds,
Its origins unknowable.
Clear mists linger,
The night’s fog disperses, revealing the grotto.
With the semblance of topknots and tresses,
The immortals descend.
Gathering qi in swirling mists,
Spiritual birds circle in return.
Forever apart from worldly dust,
Not stirring the slightest speck.
At its summit, the heavens startle,
A limpid lake lies above.

Few mortals reach this place—who could describe its form?
Sunlight pierces the clouds, wind scatters mist into flight.
Like rain falling through empty air, a fine spray dampens the robes.
From the valley comes the sound of pines; the pool mirrors dawn’s glow.
Now and again, cranes alight—none know where they go.

The Tang endured a hundred years; Xuanzong embodied the primal.
His "Long Live the Emperor" echoed to the heavens above.
The imperial virtue shone bright; here stands his shrine.
Ever do we cherish the Yellow Emperor, who perfected his work upon this land.
The cinnabar turtle endures; the dragon soars ten thousand li.
His deeds fill the gazetteers; his Dao towers in the annals of history.
No immortal visage remains—only the stream flows on.

Within the hundred Yue, this mountain stands supreme.
As if within a pot of immortals, yet beyond the realm of form.
Straight yet not leaning, lofty yet not perilous.
From ancient times to now, it stands alone above the sea.

---

**Inscription by Ye Qingchen, Vice Commissioner of the Zhejiang Circuit**
The Yellow Emperor’s chariot tracks and horse prints spanned the realm.
When his elixir was complete, clouds arose—thus was this auspicious mountain named.
The ascent of this solitary peak was surely destined.

As I oversaw the transport of grain through the two Zhe regions and toured the Kuocang Mountains,
I personally sought the immortal traces of Xiandu.
Moved by the folly of Qin and Han, which measured not their own limits,
I reined my horse by the stream and inscribed this stele upon the mountain’s shade.

Oh, how resplendent was the Dao, how exalted the Emperor’s primacy!
Thrice he ascended, fivefold his achievements—his virtue whole, his merit vast.
Shedding his mortal coil, he loathed the world, riding clouds to heaven.
He tamed the flying dragons, reaching the August Sky.
Yet Qin’s tyranny and Han’s extravagance waged endless wars, their reigns drowned in sorrow.
Forgetting this ancient lesson, they stumbled upon the cliffs.
Here, the divine immortals stand aloof, their solitary grace untouched.

**Poems Inscribed**

**By Bai Juyi, Academician of the Secretariat**
The Yellow Emperor’s banners and standards never returned;
A lone cloud, a solitary stone, stands towering.
At times, wind stirs the waves of Ding Lake,
Scattering them as raindrops across the clear sky.

**By Xu Ning, Former Presented Scholar**
Heaven and earth stretch boundless through past and present—
How many have sought the immortal precincts of Xiandu?
Arriving, one sees only the mountain’s rise and fall,
Never knowing the lake’s depth.

**Two Poems by Cao Tang, Vice Commissioner and Academician**
The peach blossoms of Huayang wither in the east;
The Yellow Emperor ascended, leaving the six palaces behind.
His banners and standards silently welcomed him to the azure vault;
The sound of reed pipes and songs drifted from distant Kongtong.
His robes and cap remain buried beneath the moon of Qiao Mountain;
His sword and sandals follow the winds of the Eastern Sea.
Gazing at the dragon’s whiskers, one cannot grasp them—
Red mists scatter, Ding Lake lies empty.

Where the Yellow Emperor ascended, the years blur into green.
A solitary peak seems to block the sun; a single pillar props up the sky.
Strange stones harbor nesting cranes; idle clouds hint at immortals.
Ding Lake is lost from sight—only a few lotus stems remain.

**By Lu Guimeng, Recluse of Rivers and Lakes**
I hear your body is lighter than a crane’s,
Dwelling in a stone chamber with clouds, free of worldly ties.
At dawn, you carve fragrant persimmons;
Alone at night, you chant scriptures of the azure void.
The essence of ten caves you absorb in flight;
A single autumnal lock of hair remains unkempt.
Knowing you’ve entered the assembly of the Suspended Pearl,
Soon you’ll ride a white carp.

*(From the* Xiandu Annals*: Jingyan is the Immortal’s Water Grotto.)*

**By Pi Rixiu, Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices**
For eighty years and more, you’ve dwelled in Jingyan,
A deer-skin cap beneath your snowy locks.
The bed grows cold, unbearable with clouds coiled round the pillow;
The scriptures dampen—no matter if stalactites drip upon their cases.
The drinking ape peers back from the abyss;
The green ladder leans against a perilous fir, its climber at rest.
How could a petty clerk, bound like a crow,
Ever hope to set sail for Xiandu?

**By Li Jianzhong, Vice Commissioner of the Two Zhe Circuits**
Majestic, the mountain of Xiandu;
Solemn, the palace of the Yellow Emperor.
A colossal stone overlooks the vast marsh,
A thousand fathoms piercing the high vault.
It arose at the dawn of creation, bearing the work of the Maker.
Deep enough to coil the fertile earth, sheer as if slicing the soaring swan.
The cloud-wrapped path remains; the alchemical tripod’s edge is empty.
Emerald moss glistens in the crevices; fragrant lotus leaves bloom red.
The ascending dragon clings, proud and fierce;
The flying phoenix cries, its voice ringing.
I, who serve in the Bureau of Immortals, have long compared it to Penglai’s might.
As stars shift past Weinu, the wind-borne chariot nears the eastern sky.
Arriving, I feel my bones and flesh refreshed,
As if borne aloft on wings.
Worldly affairs are but dust and haze;
A single breath returns to the primordial vastness.
How distant the sagely Dao—
Vast as the mysterious workings of creation.
With golden tablets, I offer utmost sincerity;
With jade inscriptions, I record an age’s labor.
When my work is done, I’ll lay aside cap and sword,
And dwell in peace upon this mountain.

---

**By Liang Ding, Prefectural Aide**
The Yellow Emperor’s stone of ascension,
Its lofty name rivals the Dipper and Ox.
Its solitary root slants over the water;
Its chill hue knows not autumn.
Tiny beside the clustered peaks,
Round as a measuring tool.
At dawn, it obstructs the setting moon;
In clear skies, it intercepts the falling stars.
Perilous yet steadfast, surpassing Kunlun’s gates,
One who climbs it should glimpse Yuzhou.
My love for it knows no end—
The sun sets, yet I linger.

**Three Poems by Sun He, Academician and Vice Commissioner**

**I**
Jade towers and gem palaces wreathed in purple mist,
The phoenix’s immortal music still lingers.
Three thousand years have passed since the events of Ding Lake;
The green stalagmite stands ten thousand fathoms tall.
It stands erect, allowing no common weeds to grow;
Its sheer form repels the dust of the vulgar world.
Where now are the rainbow banners and crimson staffs?
Only the lotus flowers bring tidings of the divine.

**II**
No way to hang even a strand of ivy,
Yet the Creator’s chisel must have labored here.
Its jade-like form points straight to the Milky Way’s descent;
Its cassia shadow divides the tides of the Eastern Sea.
Five thousand feet from earth—what worth is that?
Three hundred li from heaven—still not high enough.
By the Yellow Emperor’s tracks, the traces remain;
Atop the Dipper, a ladder of feathers ascends.

**III**
The Yellow Emperor ascended and never returned,
Leaving only this stone among men.
A thousand fathoms of misty height prop up the red sun;
For ten thousand ages, it towers above the crowd.
Damp mists and lovely blossoms weary the palace maidens;
Leaning on clouds, the towering trees idle the Feathered Forest.
Yet men of this age do not believe in the path of flight—
The dragon’s tracks and whiskers are there for the climbing.

**By Wang Hanzhang, Prefect**
For three years I governed this land, revering its sacred traces,
Yet never found the chance to draw near.
Ever do I linger, gazing at its paintings,
For truly, the sun-drying toad dwells in the void.
Clouds gather at the lake’s summit, untouched by dust;
Cranes stand upon the pines, the path beyond reach.
Spring passes by Creekside; few partake of its fare—
The ancient altar lies desolate, veiled in rain.

**Two Poems by Zhou Qiming, Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, of This Prefecture**

How deep is the Cauldron Lake?
It stands like the Dipper, pointing to the empty vault.
The thunderbolt’s cleaving cannot diminish it—
The lotus blooms ever higher.

To ascend, one must ride the crane;
To bear the weight, rely upon the turtle’s back.
A thousand fathoms—□ □ □—
When shall another follow our path?

The toad, a pillar propping the heavens,
From afar seems to tread the void in step.
Awaiting the climb to the ridge’s end to view Mount Hua’s peak,
Again one sees its towering majesty piercing the sky.

---

**Two Poems by Zeng Hui, Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and Archivist, Acting Prefect**

Often I unfurled the painted scrolls;
Now, glad to arrive at the Immortals’ Capital.
I take in all the mist and rosy clouds,
And only then know the artist’s skill.

A single pillar upholds the heavens,
From the earth it rises, ruling the Three Luminaries.
Moss seals the carriage tracks,
Lotus fragrance drifts over the Cauldron Lake.

The wind arrives from the sea realms,
The sun is welcomed upon the cloud thoroughfare.
Like bamboo shoots, a thousand fathoms straight,
Like indigo, spreading on all sides.

Its beauty channels creation’s work,
Its height defies all grasping hands.
Thunder and rain birth the crag’s treasures,
Stars and constellations watch the distant alchemical furnace.

Jinhua shames the scolded stone,
The Jade Maidens gaze at the tossed arrows.
The ancient altar still stands,
Its stele overgrown, half its characters lost.

Never did I lose my way like Ruan Zhao,
Nor weary of drunkenness with Ma Gu.
Beyond the dust, its name stands apart,
In the void, its shadow stands alone.

It mocks Qin’s inscriptions on Mount Tai,
And disdains Shun’s burial in Cangwu.
In summer, the wind fills the air;
In autumn, the frost does not wither the grass.

The void-treading song drifts from feathered guests,
Dripping jade wets the woodcutter’s clothes.
Alone it is hailed as the leader of Yingzhou—
I chant as I behold the prefect’s seal.

For over a decade, Yingzhou’s wind and moon,
Bound, I left the cloud hall to govern this prefecture.
Now, arriving at the deepest mist and rosy clouds,
Clearly, the scenery is the Immortals’ Capital.

---

**By Chen Ruozhuo, Prefect**

From the earth it rises, upholding the heavens,
Its roots coil over acres of mist.
Nature’s craft forges its abrupt majesty,
Its tracks near, as if carved and chiseled.

Steep and sheer, it leans on nothing,
Solitary and lofty, none can match its height.
From here the Yellow Emperor departed—
Who knows how many thousand years have passed?

---

**By Liu Shen, Vice Director of the Bureau of Literary Composition and Fiscal Commissioner of the Two Zhe Circuits**

Alone it rises above the peaks,
A fathom round in its circumference.
A thousand fathoms, it stoutly anchors the earth,
Ten thousand fathoms, it props up the heavens.

Amid lake waves, stars stir at the horizon’s edge,
Lotus blooms emerge where the sun’s rays descend.
One day I shall ride a cloud-borne crane,
To meet immortals atop the loftiest peak.

**By Hu Zhidao**

The Immortals’ Capital, an ancient grotto-heaven,
Its cloud-gate towers rise in solemn grandeur.
Newly appointed, I rejoice in its completion,
Where azure tiles gleam like scales in ordered rows.

That night, I lodged in the silent chamber,
And in the sixth month, all heat dissolved.
Pine winds arose in the midnight hour,
Startling my pillow—dreams turned restless.

Heaven’s breath sighed through the void,
Jade flutes chimed in crystalline clarity.
Phoenix songs harmonized with celestial tones,
Cranes danced, keeping perfect time.

Who is to say these were not the immortals,
Feasting, then parting with jade pendants’ chime?
All my life, I’ve known only zither and flute,
But here, a thousand thoughts dissolved in an instant.

*(Written after spending the night in the Immortals’ Capital, where the sound of pines seemed to echo the ringing of jade ornaments—so clear and resonant it felt as though celestial pendants chimed. I rose early to witness it.)*

**By Li Hou, a man of immortal talent,**
Whose grasp holds the cosmos entire.
His ancient seal-script boasts bold majesty,
Iron strokes bound with golden clasps.

He inscribed the Yellow Emperor’s shrine,
Where the hall’s daylight brims with primal power.
One imagines him at the moment of inscription—
Cloud and marsh swallowed eight or ninefold.

On storm-wrought nights, tradition tells,
Dragons and serpents writhe in ink.
Strange lights burst from the crag’s treasures,
Grasses and trees steeped in undying luster.

Spirits, vexed by his command,
Suddenly lost their hold.
They fled with the mist in swift ascent,
Vanishing from the mortal world.

Inquiring among mountain folk,
I found the stone inscriptions still intact.
Who could renew them with ease,
As if moving them with a mere turn of the wrist?

*(Inscription for the Hall of the Yellow Emperor, written in Li Yangyong’s seal-script)*

Speak not of immortals’ affairs as distant and vague—
For now, wander the dusty world and harmonize with its light.
Who could know that this true retreat today
Would become the very land of ascension in years to come?

After morning rites at the jade altar, clouds fill my sleeves;
In dreams, I return to the golden palace where moonlight spills across the corridors.
This journey feels as though I tread the azure heavens,
Faintly hearing the chanting of grotto hymns.

*(Inscription for the Hall of Hidden Truth)*

The Yellow Emperor rode clouds to the imperial realm,
Leaving only wheel-ruts locked in the vault of heaven.
Where now are the vast alchemical crucibles?
The trailing rainbow banners fade beyond sight.

Yet this land of streams and peaks gains grandeur,
Truly, grasses and trees bask in its radiant grace.
I stand long at the railing, gazing—
How could I not, with feeling, recall the Lord of Chu?

*(Inscription for the Pavilion of Gazing at Snow)*

A hundred years pass like a gallop on horseback,
Yet in leisure, one may still cultivate life’s essence.
The crimson gates of the Pure Capital are not so distant—
A foot of field, an inch of dwelling, well-tended.

Silently preserve the Three Officials’ presence,
Guard vigilantly lest the Five Peaks topple.
One day, when merit is complete and ascension assured,
I shall follow the wind’s chariot to Penglai’s isles.

*(Inscription for the Chamber of Cultivation)*

For years, ensnared by worldly mechanisms,
My form and spirit grew ever more common.
Of late, my dreams and soul have cleared—
Now, I find surpassing delight in forests and foothills.

The prefecture’s peaks coil like a maiden’s braids,
All vivid before my eyes.
Cold jade’s chill darts forth,
The essence of beauty—one could cup it in hand.

Composing poems in the triple-heat of summer,
A cool wind rises from the secluded valley.
I fear it may blow through my robes,
Transforming them into cloud-woven brocade.

While others sweat and toil in pursuit,
I ascend and descend in carefree chase.

*(Inscription for the Pavilion of Vying Beauty)*

The immortals’ days and months pass slowly,
Spring’s blossoms ever fragrant.
I long to pluck jasper and jade blooms,
To chew the rich marrow of clouds.

Yet I fear the depth of floral mist,
Its fragrance soaking my robes.
Seated, reciting verses, my heart still unfulfilled,
My dreams return to the distant mountain door.

*(Inscription for the Pavilion of Plucking Fragrance)*

The hymn of the Lady of Purple Tenuity sings:
*"Auspicious clouds coil the cinnabar furnace, refining jade into eightfold radiance."*

Beyond the gate, no worldly carriages,
Only clarity lingering in the eye.
At dawn, I ascend the rosy-gate tower,
Its eight windows all aglow with emptiness.

The Three Lights shine resplendent,
All phenomena laid bare without concealment.
Behold the alchemical brush at play—
Cloud-script, all heaven-wrought.

*(Inscription for the Chamber of Radiant Illumination)*

The *Yellow Court Scripture* says:
*"The Three Lights’ brilliance enters your chamber."*

Ascending the towering heights, treading layered peaks,
The cloud-steps stretch near a hundred feet.
A lifetime of dust-clad feet—
How many times have I reached such a place?

Here stands a crag, untouched,
As though heaven itself had carved it.
Jade springs spill from the stone altar,
Raindrops scattering into cold jade.

I come to prepare tea,
Boiling nectar in a pine-wood cauldron.
The lingering sweetness fills mouth and cheek,
Enough to rouse the drunken soul.

Ever do I cherish the crane-haired elder,
Who, like Zhou Jing, once dwelled here—
Now, gazing all around, only empty walls remain.
It seems he departed in an immortal’s flight,
Leaving only mountain crows to guard the place.

*(Inscription for the Immortal Water Grotto)*

Fine mountains are like old friends,
Joyfully meeting their brows and features.
Like combing morning tresses,
Red and green hues vie in charm.

How much more for one who loves mountains—
Grasping the brush, delighted to compose.
A crag yawns open,
Inviting unhurried steps.

This pure excursion is not without merit,
In such a sublime realm, one feasts on beauty.
Sweeping the stone, I sit as evening chills,
Thick verdure dampening cap and sandals.

Fine blossoms prolong spring’s delay,
Scattering crimson mists in profusion.
Where do the immortals dwell?
I fear I’ve strayed into Peach Blossom Spring.

I lingered the whole day,
Waiting only for the mountain moon to rise.
Following the flowing stream home,
I no longer recall the path I came by.

*(Inscription for the Grotto of Forgotten Return)*

Mountain mists rise in lush verdure,
Stream waters flow in boundless expanse.
The world’s people, ever-changing,
Shift like autumn grasses.

Wondrous, the Three Grotto-Heavens,
Their linked paths deep and secluded.
The sunlit crag catches the dawn’s first rays,
Revealing the break of Fusang’s day.

Who can feast on ninefold blossoms,
To keep their complexion ever fair?
The immortals shed their earthly husks and depart,
Leaving no trace to trace.

I come, content in my ascent,
Seeking hidden wonders with care.
A sorrowful whistle—hearing the valley apes,
A chirruping chorus—listening to the calling crows.

All my life’s pent-up frustrations,
Here, at last, are swept away.
Soon, I shall cast aside my official tablet,
To wander boundlessly beyond the eight wilds.

*(Inscription for the Valley of First Light, also called the Grotto of Ni Fang)*

How towering is this mountain!
I long to climb, grasping vines and creepers.
Strange rocks crouch like tigers,
Ancient plants arch like rainbows.

Within lies an ancient grotto-heaven,
Cleaved as though by heaven’s hand.
Since the dawn of creation,
Sun and moon have marked its dusk and dawn.

Here, the divine dragon coils in repose,
Thunder-jades gleam in dense array.
Whenever drought parches the land,
The mountain elders must offer prayers.

*(Inscription for the Grotto of the Divine Dragon)*

Amidst sweeping glances, layered clouds arise,
Olive branches dance, the hundred rivers flow reversed.

When shall I bid farewell to fish and shrimp,
To rise with thunder, soaring into the boundless vast?

*(Inscription for Dragon’s Abyss Grotto, now called Zanlong Grotto)*

**Prefect Liu Can**

Here the ancient emperor ascended as immortal,
His rainbow banner never to return.
Beyond the lone peak, beyond the azure ridges,
It stands erect amid the purple haze.

Above and below, its form is a pillar of the earth,
All around, its shadow turns like a ring.
Its roots seem to entwine with the sea’s embrace,
Its summit strains to breach heaven’s gate.

A lotus emerges from the lake’s distant heart,
Moss mottles the wheel-ruts’ edge.
Beside it lies the alchemist’s cauldron,
Below, one gazes upon the ethereal mountain.

How could apes or monkeys ever reach this place?
Yet phoenixes and simurghs may freely ascend.
By day, it boasts a name of subtle renown,
But reciting its grandeur daunts even the bold.

Crow’s Gorge lacks true numinosity,
Orchid Rock scorns idle leisure.
Here in Jinyun, where wanderers roam,
Its wonders surpass all within the mortal realm.

**County Registrar, Collator of Books Mao Weizhan**

Steep and towering, the abode of immortals,
I come seeking its mist-laden depths.
Below, it coils through the ninefold earth,
Above, it yields not to the thronging peaks.

Gazing upon its marvels by day,
Even grasping the green cliffs seems impossible.
When might one descend beneath the lotus leaves,
Sealed for all time by moss-woven patterns?

The past is as elusive as drifting clouds,
Yet the path remains, silent but marked.
Where now the distant Mount Qiao?
I shall follow and ascend with the dragon.

**Transport Commissioner Su Shunyuan Qiuweng**

Dragon chariots and phoenix carriages enter jade laughter,
By the wheel-ruts, high-hung wonders none may climb.
Only the wind stirs the eternal waters of Ding Lake,
As blue lotus petals fall among men.

**Zhexi Inspector of Wuxing Shen Gua Cunzhong**

Moss seals the imperial path upon the green mountain,
The crane-drawn chariot soared to distant skies, never to return.
Only on autumn moonlit nights by the Silver River,
Do the mists and waves of Ding Lake reach mortal ears.

**County Native, National University Student Hu Fen Ziwen**

A bird’s path coils through the empty sky,
Pine roots embrace the living stone.
Feathered beings divide their dwellings,
While the cries of chickens and dogs are heard.

**Zhexi Judicial Commissioner, Ruxu Yang Jie Cigong (Three Poems)**

A path leads into the immortal capital,
Yet who has reached Ding Lake?
The autumn wind blows fiercely at night—
Has it blown away the azure lotus?

Ask the way through yellow and jade,
Pierce the clouds to enter the purple clarity.
Within the woods, pines turn to stone,
Beyond the gate, jade forms the city walls.

The Daoist does not love the mountain,
Yet having left the world, he has grown old.
Though he knows the traces of chariot tracks,
He does not recognize the dragon’s-beard grass.

**Prefect Liu Jing Juji**

Stone walls and cloud-pavilions embrace Floating Hill,
Here once dwelled the Perfected One of ancient Kuazhou.
If one could cast the immortal’s map to vie in wonders,
Who would know the joy of wandering a grotto-heaven?

**Qin Prince’s Nephew, Inscription at the Yellow Emperor’s Shrine**

**Daguan Era**

I cross the stream to seek a desolate village,
Where peaks surge like ten thousand galloping horses.
The spring’s lush hues follow the thunder’s clearing,
Misty vapors veil the mountains, still dim with dusk.

Jade towers and golden palaces once filled the earth,
Now half the pines bear the scars of axes.
To cleanse the world of dust and filth,
Would that a single torch of kalpa-fire could burn it all!

Travelers bow in reverence, their horses kneeling,
I can speak of the wondrous truths of Xiandu.
The awe of his divine might lingers, stern as if he were present,
Even now, from his terrace, the shrine honors Xuanyuan.

In those days, he robed himself and faced the south,
His creations drawn from Qian and Kun.
He cleaved the primal chaos to begin the human age,
First establishing the roots of the world’s divisions.

Feng Hou and the shepherds came in succession,
Unfurling divine strategies to shape the formless.
First, he sought the Way from Guangchengzi,
Later, he secretly aligned with Zhonghuang Jun.

His merits and virtue vast, beyond compare,
Nearly rivaling the Creator in bestowed grace.
From distant Tang Yao to the fiery destiny of the Yan,
For ten thousand years, sage-sons and divine grandsons endured.

The Perfected One ruled the world with the eternal Dao,
His ascension so effortless it scarcely merits discussion.
Yet from the One Qi arose the ten thousand things—
Why then divide heaven and humanity?

Fu Xi’s eight trigrams were already broken,
Nü Wa sought to mend them, but the task was too great.
He drifted back alone to the Pure Capital,
Gathering creation’s essence into perfect wholeness.

Before the shrine, the immortal stone stands through the ages,
Towering between heaven and earth, vying in majesty.
Ding Lake may be glimpsed but never reached,
Its intent to leave later ages with no path to climb.

Within the summit’s mystic palace, called the Mud Pill,
A natural road leads to the union of heaven.
When this body’s inner and outer qi converge,
One transcends life and death in a single bow.

Silently, the four seasons turn without anomaly—
Observe the sun and moon: who swallows, who spits?
Even now, by the lake’s edge, wind and rain are sent forth,
Grasses and trees sway like banners and pennants.

Ten-foot red fungi drift down,
A jade-green stream plunges into a glass basin.
No need for horse hooves or chariot tracks—
Though lost in Xiang’s wilds, the Way remains.

At night, the mountain springs roar through a hundred valleys,
The music of Dongting Lake can still be heard.
The ancient hues of mountains and rivers hold profound meaning—
Who will clear the source and illuminate the root?

I speak of the subtle and the simple, returning to purity,
No need for disputation or surging waves.
Let it be.

**County Native, Hubei Transport Commissioner Hu Sheng Zishang**

Ding Lake cannot be seen,
Only a lone peak stands, towering.
It endures through all ages,
Its qi overawing the surrounding mountains.

The Yellow Emperor long attained immortality,
Riding a flying dragon on his journeys.
To this day, common tales persist,
Pointing to the path where his chariot passed.

Much like the cypress of his ascension,
Or the pursuit of the white deer’s trail.
Such talk is often dismissed as absurd,
Yet the sight of it would truly be childlike.

But consider this mountain’s marvels—
Truly, it is a fitting palace for immortals.
The sound of water comes like tinkling wind,
Harmonizing with ten thousand pines.

The traveler’s pillow long unsettled,
Flutes and reeds fill the empty void.
I suspect these are the Nine Harmonies,
Yet not found in the Two Classics.
I fear only the banners of Chiyou,
Flashing and clamorous, unfurling like long rainbows.
Though he alone could not die,
How could he bear to see the people suffer?
Behold the Battle of Zhuolu—
For ten thousand ages, they have reaped its fruits.
What is Ding Lake to speak of?
The Emperor’s virtue spans the vault of heaven.

**Vice Magistrate of Yanling, Ding Zongdan of Shaoxing**

In the world, thirty-six grotto-heavens,
Jinyun is the twenty-ninth realm.
Ancient trees pierce the sky, bearing cloud-palaces,
The true and numinous near—called the Immortals’ Capital.
A lone peak stands sheer, two thousand feet,
Jade-green, towering in solitude against the sky.
Gazing up to its mist-wreathed summit,
Once named Ding Lake for the Miao tribes.
Old tales say the Yellow Emperor halted his chariot here,
Clouds paired, winds harnessed, passing this way.
In a stone cauldron, he refined cinnabar into elixir,
Then rode a dragon to the Emperor’s realm in but a moment.
Beyond the purple void and azure firmament,
His ministers had no path to grasp the dragon’s whiskers.
The Tang dynasty’s Son of Heaven, of Li’s line,
His virtue matched Heaven’s will, bringing auspicious signs.
Auspicious mists and propitious vapors spread like ministering clouds,
Nine transmissions in the mountains, ten thousand years’ acclamation.
Step into the void, peaks face each other, clouds break and continue,
East and west, their heights and depths diverge.
By the stream’s secluded path, ascend the raven’s trail,
Above lies Mirror Cliff, like a square pot.
Within the rock, dripping stalactites weep,
Forming hollows like upturned basins.
Each day and night, a *hu* and a half of water,
Neither flooding in rains nor drying in drought.
Lu Wang once recorded Zhou Jingfu,
Who fasted, consumed auroras, a follower of the Yellow and Lao.
Dwelling in truth, wondrously entering the assembly of suspended pearls,
He hid here for over eighty years.
Through the ages, seas and mulberries have changed,
The immortals’ traces—are they still, or gone?
Though Stone Gate’s waterfall is said to be fine,
This place’s wonders are not easily matched.
Nature has so concentrated its divine beauty,
Even a master painter’s hand could scarcely capture it.
These accounts emerge from illustrated classics and auspicious poems.

**Transmitted by Langzhong of Qiantang, Wu Shuo**

It has long been said that Ding Lake is a fine abode,
This journey makes me wish to reach the Pure Capital.
Jade bamboo shoots rise a thousand *xun*,
Golden lotuses, ten *zhang* tall, have fallen to earth.
By the river, I long to sleep beneath a single pillar,
Today, by the sea and mountains, I rejoice to know Penglai.
I must purchase goose-city silk,
To paint a water-and-ink scroll of Penglai’s shores.

**Han Yuanji of Shangrao, Three Poems for Master Fu of the Stream**

Beyond the balustrade, wind high, frost moon bright,
In Step-in-Void Mountain, the sound of stepping into the void.
The qin silenced, candles carved through the long night,
Again, one asks of man—this dream is clear.

The Feng and Shan sacrifices left only an undying name,
In Huaqing Palace, they longed for longevity.
Idle clouds spread as man’s auspices,
Again, the mountains resound with ten thousand years’ acclamation.

Dragons and tigers drove the battle at Banquan,
The tripod cast at Mount Jing, then ascension to heaven.
Wherever the Yellow Emperor passed, traces remain—
How could a lord not learn to seek immortality?

**Transport Commissioner Li Shiju**

Passing beneath the Immortals’ Capital,
The stream deep, grasses and trees at leisure.
Farmers’ affairs shift with sun and shade,
This heart is bound to their harvest’s plenty.
Who carved this thousand-*xun* stone?
Clouds veil the ten thousand-fold mountains.
The royal journey has its limits—
How could one ascend further?

Across the four seas, no dust, warhorses idle,
Rice, millet, mulberries—green circles all.
Who knows it is all the lord’s power?
Layered mansions face the fine mountains.

**The above were composed at the Xu family’s mountain retreat in Xiandu, seen in the old *Kuozhang Continued Collection*; now Prefect Zhongwen of Yun has composed in this rhyme.**

**Prefect of the Prefecture, Xie Ji of Yangxia, in harmonious response**

The carriage of office gleams afar,
The court’s chariot has no leisure.
Inquiries and inspections press urgently,
Reducing taxes is of utmost concern.
Departure and stay find voice in lofty song,
Sun and shade face the fine mountains.
Though briefly lodged in the prefect’s sash,
The immortal realm is not for climbing.

The aged lean on staffs, young boys idle,
Distant huts by clear streams, green waters encircle.
Vying to see the curtained carriage, yet shunning the relay,
In stillness, no clappers or drums—only love for the green mountains.

**Zhejiang Eastern Transport Commissioner, Master Zhu Xi of Hui’an, in pursuit of the Xu family mountain retreat’s rhyme**

A lone cloud from the cave-mouth, its intent at ease,
No hindrance to official duties, like linked rings.
Unsaddling, lingering on the stone steps, forgetting to return,
The azure stream and tall bamboos seem like home.

**Native of the Prefecture, Wu Jinwei, Five Poems on Wandering Xiandu**

A minor post drives me, dreading official dispatches,
Gold softens, summer’s heat fouls the journey.
Returning, I resolve to seek the true realm,
The path to Xiandu—no fear of its winding ways.

Before the chariot-trace peak, I briefly rest,
At the cave’s mouth, forgetting to return.
Those who chase fame and profit, restless,
Rarely set foot in Xiandu.

A yellow-capped Daoist, old and gaunt,
Facing me, discoursing on the mysterious—nothing to say.
He urges me not to sink in the sea of office,
For in this world, there is also Xiandu.

The stone bamboo is said to be eight hundred *zhang*,
Ding Lake’s immortal gone for thousands of years.
I doubt these two matters have any governance,
But believe Xiandu is a grotto-heaven.

Mountain rains lightly dust the earth,
Before the gate, cranes cry shrilly to greet me.
Thus, I dream a Xiandu dream,
Then seek traces to find the hidden truth.

**Prefect Xu Yin of Jue Min, in harmonious response, Shaoxing**

Xiandu’s traces linger in old books,
When I wish to return, I’ll ask the way again.
Suddenly, new poems come like paintings,
Mountain paths and wild trails need no winding.

Mountain cranes complain of no place to seek,
At the cave’s mouth, clouds return, yet I cannot.
Recalling Xiandu’s old paths,
Stone bridges, moss-slick, footprints few.

The jade-faced immortal, never aging, never gaunt,
In this place, worldly honor and disgrace are absent.
Last night’s mist and clouds slightly dispersed,
As if resenting the imperial carriage’s retinue.

The Yellow Emperor attained immortality and left from here,
Ding Lake’s tales have passed through many years.
Dragon’s whiskers fell to earth, becoming spring grass,
Even now, they do not ascend to heaven.

The path back to Peach Blossom Spring is said to be dustless,
Only to avoid the world’s people.
Immortals’ affairs are vast and vague like this—
Ding Lake’s chariot traces may not be true.

**Prefect Wu Fu, in pursuit of the rhyme**

Coming to visit Xiandu’s ancient Jade Void,
Before the mountain, a traveler points the lost way.
Mist and rosy clouds stretch far, a lone peak soars,
Pines and bamboos dense, a single path winds.

Leaning on a staff, step by step into the emerald haze,
Beneath Step-in-Void Mountain, long forgetting to return.

Amidst secluded dwelling, there should be recluses of the forest,
Yet why are such men rare in recent times?
I hear that atop the mountain lies Ding Lake—
Do the lotus flowers still resemble those of old?

After Xuanyuan’s departure, only chariot tracks remain,
I suspect these mountains and rivers are the very same as the ancient capital.
The man has ridden the dragon and gone, never to return,
Only a pair of cranes linger, their years unknown.

Sitting here, I suddenly feel the mortal world far removed,
At last I believe that within the gourd lies another heaven.
From ancient times to now, those who have climbed this mountain—
How many are left to pass down its tales?
Few, I know, have trodden such sacred ground as you,
Yet in death, your new poems serve as a true likeness.
