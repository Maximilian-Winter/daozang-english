The **Dragon Auspicious Observatory** is located in **Yu’s Cave (Yuxue)**, a **Yangming Celestial Retreat**, fifteen *li* southeast of **Kuaiji County**. This is the very place where **Great Yu** explored the **Five Sacred Talismans** and tamed the floods.

During the **Tang dynasty’s Shenlong Year (661 CE)**, the **Huaixian Pavilion** was established. In **Kaiyuan Year 2 (714 CE)**, after **Daole Tian Shi** (Master of the Dao’s Effulgence) performed a grand exorcism (*jiao*), a dragon appeared, and the pavilion was renamed in its honor.

**Mount Kuaiji** lies twelve *li* north of the county, serving as the **zhen mountain** (sacred peak) of **Yangzhou**. The *Shanhai Jing* (Classic of Mountains and Seas) states:
*"Its upper regions abound in gold and jade; its lower regions abound in pearls and stones. It is also called Hengshan."*

The *Yudi Zhi* (Records of Regions and Capitals) confirms:
*"Mount Kuaiji is also called Hengshan."*

Its rocks resemble an overturned tripod, hence also called **Fubeishan (Overturned Tripod Mountain)**.
The *Huanglan* (Imperial Compendium) records:
*"Mount Kuaiji was originally named Miaoshan."*

The *Yuezhuan* (Annals of Yue) states:
*"When Yu arrived in Great Yue, he ascended Miaoshan, convened a grand assembly, conferred titles upon the virtuous, and granted fiefs to the meritorious. Thus, Miaoshan was renamed Kuaiji."*

The *Shiji’s* (Records of the Grand Historian) *Fengshan Shu* (Book of Mount Sacrifices) notes:
*"Yu sealed Mount Tai and performed the *zhan* (sacrificial rite) at Kuaiji."*

The *Huangdi Xuanü Bingfa* (Yellow Emperor’s Mystic Female Martial Arts) records:
*"Yu asked Feng Hou (Lord of Winds), ‘I have heard that the Yellow Emperor possessed the *fusheng zhi tu* (Map of Victorious Retreats) and the *liu jia yin-yang zhi dao* (Six Heavenly Stems and Yin-Yang Way). Where are they now?’*
*Feng Hou replied, ‘The Yellow Emperor hid them in Mount Kuaiji, where a deep chasm a thousand *zhang* deep is sealed by a flat stone.’"*

The *Dunjia Kaishan Tu* (Map of Retreating and Opening Mountains) states:
*"When Yu tamed the floods at Kuaiji, he camped at Hengling. The spirit of **Ruanwei** presented him with a jade case containing twelve scrolls. Yu had not yet taken them when four scrolls flew into the spring, four ascended to heaven, and he obtained four. Unrolling them, he found the *Dunjia Kaishan Tu*, which he used to tame the floods. Upon completion, he sealed the scrolls in the cave."*

According to the *Guishan Baiyu Jing* (White Jade Scripture of the Tortoise Mountain):
*"Mount Kuaiji encircles **350 li**, known as the **First Yangming Celestial Retreat**."*

During the **Tang dynasty’s Kaiyuan Year 10 (722 CE)**, the four celestial guardians were ennobled as dukes, and thus **Mount Kuaiji was titled the Southern Guardian, Duke of Yongxing**."

**Mount Ruanwei** lies fifteen *li* north of the county.
The *Dunjia Kaishan Tu* states:
*"Yu opened Mount Ruanwei and obtained a **red jade tablet** like the sun and a **white jade tablet** like the moon, each **1.2 *chi* long**."*

The *Haoyue Chunqiu* (Spring and Autumn Annals of the Exalted Yue) records:
*"The nine mountains to the southeast are called **Tianzhu (Heavenly Pillar)**, also named **Ruanwei**. They support **wenyu** (cultural jade) and are capped by flat stones. Within lies a **golden tablet** inscribed with **green jade characters**, bound with white silver. Yu, during his southern inspection tour, sacrificed a white horse in blood upon the mountain. A man in **red brocade** appeared, claiming to be an envoy of **Yuan Yi Changyong**, seeking the tablet to know the way of guiding waters. He requested purification at the Yellow Emperor’s altar. Yu purified himself, ascended the mountain, and removed the stone—indeed finding the scripture. Thus, he understood the boundaries of the **four great rivers** and the principles of the **hundred streams**, completing his efforts in irrigation across the land."*

It is also called **Shiqiu Mountain**.
The *Yudi Zhi* states:
*"On Mount Ruanwei stands a **stone case**, its walls towering like clouds. Ascenders climb by ladder."*

**Shede Mountain** lies fifteen *li* south of the county.
**Kong Hao’s** *Kuaiji Zhi* (Records of Kuaiji) notes:
*"Beside Shede Mountain is a **stone chamber**—the **Shooting Hall of the Immortals**."*

To the north, **Shifeng Peak** has a **Shede** (shooting target) marking. From afar, the mountain’s wall bears white spots resembling a shooting target. Locals use them to predict grain prices, saying:
*"If Shede is white, rice costs **one *hu* per hundred*; if Shede is dark, rice costs **one *hu* per thousand**."*

To the west, a **stone cliff** forms a chamber two *zhang* deep, resembling a **lion’s mouth** from afar—thus called **Shizi Yan (Lion’s Cave)**, the **Shooting Hall of the Immortals**.

**Jianyu Mountain** lies sixteen *li* east of the county.
**Kong Lingfu’s** *Kuaiji Ji* (Records of Kuaiji) states:
*"This mountain has **Shede Mountain**, and in its southwest waters, a **white crane** retrieves arrows for the immortals, hence its name, **Jianyu (Arrow Feather) Mountain**."*

**Zheng Hong Mountain** lies thirty *li* north of the county.
**Zheng Hong**, courtesy name **Jujun**, was a native of **Shanyin, Kuaiji**, during the **Later Han dynasty**.
**Kong Lingfu’s** *Kuaiji Ji* records:
*"South of Shede Mountain is **Baihe Mountain**, where a crane retrieves arrows for the immortals. **Zheng Hong**, the Han Grand Commander, once gathered firewood and found a discarded arrow. Shortly after, someone sought it, and Zheng returned it, asking what they desired. Recognizing the divine nature, Zheng said, ‘I often suffer from the **Ruoxi River’s** difficult currents when transporting firewood. I wish for **morning south winds and evening north winds**.’ Indeed, the winds changed as he wished, and the river’s currents became thus ever after. The wind is now called **Zheng Gong Feng (Zheng’s Official Wind)** or **Qiaofeng (Firewood Wind)**."*

All the above mountains are visible from the **Dragon Auspicious Observatory**.

The **Yuezhou Tu Jing** (Illustrated Geography of Yue Prefecture) states:
*"Since the Tang dynasty’s Kaiyuan era until the holy Song, every spring, envoys were dispatched to cast **jade tablets** and release **golden dragons** into the **Yangming Cave**—the very place where **Great Yu** hid his flood-control scriptures. This ritual ceased during the **Zhiping era (1064–1067 CE)**."*

Furthermore, the **Yuezhou Tu Jing** records that the **Ningzhou Zhenning County** annals mention an immortal’s legend:
*"During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Minghuang dreamed he attended a gathering with immortals in **Luohu County**. Seeking its location, he learned of **Zhenning County’s Luohu Mutual Village** and sent envoys to inquire. None found the immortals. In distress, they met an old man who, when asked, pointed and said, ‘Follow me.’ Suddenly, the old man transformed into a **white hare** and vanished into a cave. The envoys dug and uncovered **twenty-seven jade figurines of immortals**, each with a face. Before them stood a plaque listing their names and places of Dao attainment—such as **Zheng Siyuan**, who attained Dao at **Taishan**, and **Xun Angli**, who attained Dao at **Hua Mountain**. They were all brought back to the capital and enshrined in the **inner Daoist hall** for veneration."*

The *Yǔxué Yángmíng Dòngtiān* map of **Lóngruì Guan** in **Yùxué County** was completed in the **4th year of Zhènghé** (February), when a **famed scholar-official** was specially appointed to teach in **Wéishān County**. I, **Yè Shū**, have recorded this in detail.

(Note: *特奏名进士* was translated as "famed scholar-official" in the previous context, but here it likely refers to a **prominent candidate** from the imperial examinations. *掘* was translated as "dug" earlier, but *图经* is a technical term for "illustrated gazetteer/geographical treatise." *得道处* remains "place of Dao attainment" for consistency.)
