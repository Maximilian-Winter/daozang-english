**Preface to the *Illustrated Anthology of Dan Mountain in Siming Grotto-Heaven***
*By Canghai Yishi, Zeng Jian of Linchuan*

Siming Mountain lies upon the Eastern Sea. The mountain has four caverns that pierce through it, their light illuminating the heavens like windows. When the skies clear, they appear as doorways or casements. The locals call them "Stone Windows," and thus the mountain takes its name. During the Tang, a prefectural seat was established at present-day Yuyao, and the commandery was named *Ming* after the mountain. In the Song, the old administrative seat at Qingyuan was changed, and a county was established. In the present dynasty, the prefecture was elevated, and the mountain became part of Yuyao, lying a hundred *li* south of the prefectural seat.

The illustrations are carved at the temples and abbeys at the mountain’s foot. The first is titled *Illustration of Yuanjian Abbey*, and the second, *Illustration of the Tang Relocation of the Abbey*. Together, they are called *Siming Mountain*. Mu Xuanxu said: "Of the thirty-six grotto-heavens under heaven, Siming ranks ninth, named *Dan Mountain and Red Waters*." Upon examination: the mountain connects with Dalan Mountain, its terrain coiling and intertwining for three hundred and eighty *li*, with two hundred and eighty peaks rising two hundred and ten *zhang*. Perpetual clouds and mist shroud its midst for twenty *li* without cease. This stretch is called *Passing Clouds*; to the south, *Cloud South*; to the north, *Cloud North*. Thirty *li* along the mountain ridge stands a peak called *Three Terraces Mountain*, with *Screen Peak*, *Stone House*, and *Cloud Root*. Between *Stone House* and *Cloud Root* lies a waterfall like a suspended river, called *Chan Yuan Grotto*.

Beside *Three Terraces* is *Dragon’s Gargle*. In the Later Han, Liu Gang of Xiapi, then magistrate of Shangyu, resigned his post and, with his wife Fan Yunqiao, dwelled in *Chan Yuan Grotto*. There, they received the *Immortals’ Art* from Master Bai. Above it lies *Washing Herbs Stream*. After completing their studies, they gathered with friends atop Dalan Mountain, climbed a giant cedar, and with a single wave of his hand, Liu summoned his wife. Together, they ascended as immortals, leaving behind only their forms, which transformed into crouching tigers. Later generations named the mountain in their honor. A pavilion called *Fan Pavilion* was built, where the recluse Kong You of the Liang later resided. Once, he saw several hundred *hu* of coins in the valley, and when woodcutters scrambled to take them, they turned to shards. A deer, struck by an arrow, fled to Kong, who tended and raised it until its wound healed, whereupon it departed. Thus, a *Deer Pavilion* was built beside the shrine.

During the Yongding era of the Chen, a certain Fang Yi built an abbey, repurposing the old shrine, hence called *Temple and Abbey*. In the eleventh year of Tianbao of the Tang, envoys were sent to pray at the shrine, but finding it perilously remote, the Daoist monk Fen Jie and the scholar Li Jian relocated it outside *Chan Yuan Grotto*, near *You Water* Stream. In the Song, Wu Jun Zhenyang of Longhu Mountain’s *Erhua Abbey*, styled *Master of Simplicity* (*Hunpuzi*), studied under the *Celestial Master* Zhang Yujing. Traveling here, he took residence. Emperor Huizong summoned him to serve as *Registrar of the Palace of Concentrated Spirit*, but he declined. In the sixth year of Zhenghe, the abbey was expanded, and a *Jade Emperor Hall* was built. Its plaque read: *Grotto-Heaven of Dan Mountain and Red Waters*. Liu Gang was enfeoffed as *Perfected Lord of Ascending Mystery and Illuminating Discourse*, and Fan Shi as *Perfected Lady of Wondrous Transformation*. *Master of Simplicity* was appointed *Gentleman of the Cinnabar Grove*. Logging was forbidden, and taxes were remitted.

Prime Minister Zhang of Gaozong’s court knew Kong Rong, a disciple of *Master of Simplicity*, and memorialized him as a *Perfected One*, permitting the annual ordination of one Daoist, transmitted in order of seniority. In the first year of Jiaxi, Emperor Lizong prayed for an heir at *Longrui Abbey* in Kuaiji. Upon completion, gold dragons and jade tablets were interred there. Today, Master Mao Yongzhen of the *Three Flowers* lineage presides over it.

The mountain’s trees are called *Qingling Trees*, their fruit sweet yet inedible when split. Its beasts are called *Juhou* monkeys. During the Xiantong era of the Tang, Xie Yichen retired here. Lu Guimeng and Pi Rixiu often visited, each composing nine poems, which they took as their themes.

Lu You of the Song recorded: "Twice I sailed the seas on official business, departing from Qingyuan’s waters, skirting Yuyao. Four times I ascended, gazing westward where the misty peaks hovered like light clouds piercing the sky’s edge. The helmsman pointed and told me: ‘That is Great Orchid Mountain.’ Upon reaching the capital, I chanced upon Master Xue Yifu, who had just come from the abode of Master Mao Yongzhen. He showed me two scrolls, and through them I glimpsed the mountain’s wondrous landscapes, longing to wander its heights and depths, to roam with a few carefree scholars, to sit in Deer Pavilion, to drink from the murmuring streams, to call the *Juhou* monkeys, and thus to wash away the dust of official toil and bureaucratic drudgery. Yet when I sailed past before, I could only gaze in longing and sigh. Nowadays, scholar-officials are drowned in the pursuit of profit and advancement—none can emulate Liu Wang, who cast off his sandals and cap, nor even Pi Rixiu and Lu Guimeng, who forgot rank in their poetic exchanges. Is it any wonder that lofty-minded men scorn and spit at such times, while calling this place a *Grotto-Heaven*? I have therefore set down its origins in detail, that those with aspirations beyond the mundane may read and reflect upon it."

**The Garden of Immortals Strung with Pearls, Volume One**
Compiled by Wang Songnian, Daoist of Mount Tiantai

The Great Dao is spontaneous, existing before the primordial chaos. The *Daoist Scripture* states: "There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Silent and void, it stands alone without change, moving in cycles without cease—it may be called the Mother of all under heaven. I know not its name; I style it the *Dao*." *Zhuangzi* says: "The Dao has essence and trustworthiness, yet is without action or form. It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It is not high though prior to the Supreme Ultimate, not deep though below the Six Poles. Born before heaven and earth, it is not ancient; older than antiquity, it is not aged."

When the *qi* congealed and transformed, Pangu came into being. *The Record of the Primordial Perfected* states: "Before the Two Modes separated, the dark abyss was turbid and formless. Sun and moon were not yet formed; it resembled a hen’s egg, chaotic and murky. Then Pangu the Perfected One, essence of heaven and earth, styled himself the Primordial Celestial King, wandering within it. The heavens took the shape of a vast canopy, unsuspended above, unrooted below. The profound void was utterly silent, vast and black as water’s form. Without this radiance, heaven and earth would not have been born. Once heaven and earth divided, they stood thirty-six thousand *li* apart. The Primordial Celestial King dwelt at the spine of heaven, in a place called Jade Capital Mountain. Within the mountain were palaces inlaid with gold and jade, where he constantly inhaled celestial radiance and drank from earth’s springs. Suddenly, the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden emerged from a stone. She could speak at birth, her form complete, her celestial beauty unmatched—she was named the Supreme Primordial Sage Mother. The Primordial Lord descended to meet her and brought her back to the upper palace. The Celestial Sovereign stood in the east, the Queen Mother in the west. After the Primordial Celestial King and the Supreme Primordial Sage Mother returned to the upper palace, one *kalpa* passed before the Celestial Sovereign was born. He ruled for thirty-six thousand years, receiving the scriptures as the Great Emperor of Fusang, dwelling in the Fusang Palace of the easternmost reaches as the Eastern Kingly Lord. The present Crown Prince of the Celestial Court resides in the Eastern Palace, following this precedent. Then the Nine Radiance Mystic Maiden was born, known as the Supreme Perfected Queen Mother of the West, dwelling on Kunlun Mountain in the westernmost reaches. Thus, the Lord of Wood and the Queen Mother of Metal are the revered deities of heaven and earth."

Fuxi’s Eight Trigrams and the Yellow Emperor’s Five Classics: *Zhuangzi* states: "Fuxi attained the Dao and inherited the Mother of *qi*." The *Book of Documents* says: "Fuxi ruled the world, moved by the divine tortoise that bore the chart upon its back. He drew the Eight Trigrams, created written characters, and attained the Dao as the Azure Emperor of the East." *Zhuangzi* says: "The Yellow Emperor attained the Dao and ascended to the cloudy heavens." The *Scripture* states: "The Yellow Emperor ascended Mount Emei, where the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign bestowed upon him the Five Numinous Talismans. He ruled for three hundred years, then cast a tripod at Mount Jing to refine the elixir. When the elixir was complete, a yellow dragon descended to welcome him, and seventy-two ministers ascended with him. He concealed the talismans at Mount Yuanwei."

Zhuanxu’s Primal Pen and Emperor Ku’s Dragon Cakes: *The Transmission of Daoist Learning* states: "Zhuanxu of Gaoyang rode the carriage of knotted primal *qi*, patrolling the northern wastes of Youling, the southern lands of Jiaolu, the western deserts of Yousha, and the eastern reaches of Panmu. The spirits of mountains and waters, all living things, all illuminated by sun and moon, were subject to him. Traversing the Eight Trigrams, he summoned the gods of the terraced mountains and the mounds of the yin palaces. The Emperor called the gods of the Four Seas to transport treasures from the Celestial Market Mountain of the Anxi Kingdom, sealing them to guard the grottoed mountains. He cast bronze from Mount Yu to forge sacred tripods, each presented to a grottoed mountain." *Zhuangzi* says: "Zhuanxu attained the Dao and dwelt in the Dark Palace." Emperor Ku of Gaoxin was moved by the Nine Heavens’ Perfected King and the Three Heavens’ Perfected Sovereign, who descended in a cloud chariot drawn by nine dragons to the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue, bestowing upon him the Five Numinous Talismans. The Emperor used them to attain the Dao, later sealing the talismans at Mount Zhong.

Shun obtained the medicine; Yu dredged the rivers: *True Reports* states: "Shun was moved by the Long-Hu King of the Northern Rong, who presented him with ten transformations of White Silver Frost and Purple Blossom. Consuming them, he became an immortal." *The Annals of Wu and Yue* say: "When Yu failed to complete his flood control, he consulted *The Yellow Emperor’s Central Classic*, which recorded that the sacred writings lay in the southeast on Mount Yuanwei, borne by striated jade and capped with a boulder. The text was inscribed on gold tablets with azure jade characters, bound with white silver. Yu then journeyed south, ascending Mount Heng, where he sacrificed a white horse. Unsuccessful, he sighed to heaven and dreamed of a man in red embroidered robes, who said: ‘To obtain my methods for flood control and dragon mastery, purify yourself at the Yellow Emperor’s peak, beneath the sheer cliffs—there lies the text on gold tablets.’"

Yu then withdrew to purify himself. On the day of *jigeng*, he ascended Mount Yuanwei, moved the boulder, and indeed obtained the gold tablets and jade writings. Using these to govern the waters, he cut through Dragon Gate, dredged the hundred rivers, and all under heaven benefited from his great merit. Today, the Daoist *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* is this very text. The site where the talismans were unearthed lies on Mount Kuaiji—Yu’s Grotto.

The Venerable Lord transcends the limitless; Pengzu extends longevity. Confucius said: *"I privately compare myself to our Old Peng."* Master Ge the Immortal declared: *"Laozi embodies spontaneity, arising before the Great Void, emerging without cause, enduring through the beginning and end of heaven and earth, beyond all reckoning—ending without end, exhausting the inexhaustible, reaching the limitless."* He further stated: *"The world believes Laozi began in the Zhou era, yet his title originated in measureless kalpas. His depths are boundless, his remoteness unfathomable."*

The *Zhuangzi Commentary* records: *"Pengzu, surnamed Qian and named Keng, was a great-grandson of Zhuanxu. Skilled in nurturing life and regulating the cauldron, he presented pheasant broth to Yao and was enfeoffed at Pengcheng. His Way could be ancestral, hence he was called Pengzu."* The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* and *Arrayed Traditions of Immortals* both state: *"He lived through the Xia and Yin dynasties, enduring seven hundred and sixty years without aging. Later, he journeyed west to the sands, and none knew his end."* Thus, Luo Yin’s stele inscription reads: *"When the water phase descended its numen, its radiance first divided at the Dark Emperor’s realm; when the immortal lineage began its blessing, it inherited fortune at Peng’s mound. Stars floated above the southern shores of Pu, while clouds and cranes crossed the wandering sands."*

Guangchengzi dwelled in lofty seclusion; Yin Xi delved deeply. The *Zhuangzi* recounts: *"The Yellow Emperor visited Mount Kongtong to consult Guangchengzi, asking how to govern the body. Guangchengzi replied: ‘Excellent question! I shall tell you: The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing—your spirit will right itself. Do not weary your form, do not disturb your essence, and you may attain long life.’ Thus, I have cultivated this for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined."*

The *Original Account* and *Scripture of Western Ascent* both state: *"Guanling Yin Xi received Laozi’s *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue*, studying them ten thousand times. In the marketplace of the Green Ram at Shu Commandery, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight with Laozi, roaming the four seas, ascending the Three Clarities, and transforming eighty-one lands below."*

Lu Ao roamed the seas; Ruoshi soared to the heavens. The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* record: *"Lu Ao was a man of Yan. During the Qin, he traveled to the Northern Sea, reaching Mount Menggu, where he saw Ruoshi dancing in the wind. Turning to Ao, he said: ‘I have an appointment with Hanman above the Nine Gorges—no time to linger.’ He then refined his body and entered the clouds."*

Chisongzi summoned rain; Shaofeng followed the smoke. The *Arrayed Traditions of Immortals* state: *"Chisongzi was the rain master of Shennong. He taught Shennong to ingest mica and could enter fire, ascending and descending with wind and rain. In the Gaoxin era, he again served as rain master—today’s rain master is he."* Shaofengzi was the Yellow Emperor’s pottery officer. Someone taught him to emit five-colored smoke, whereupon he piled fire and burned himself, rising and falling with the smoke.

Yellow Mountain numbered in the hundreds; White Stone in the thousands. The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* recount: *"The Lord of Yellow Mountain cultivated Pengzu’s arts and lived for several hundred years, yet retained a youthful countenance."* The White Stone Master was a disciple of the Grand Minister of the Center. By Pengzu’s time, he was already three thousand years old. He once boiled white stones for sustenance on White Stone Mountain, hence his name.

King Mu of Zhou journeyed to Jasper Pool; Guan Quan of Locust Mountain gathered herbs. The *Liezi* records: *"King Mu of Zhou rode eight steeds, traveling ten thousand *li* a day, reaching Mount Kunlun, where he feasted with the Queen Mother of the West at Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang the *Ballad of White Clouds*, and the king harmonized."* The *Arrayed Traditions of Immortals* state: *"Guan Quan was a herb-gatherer on Locust Mountain. Fond of eating pine nuts, his body grew hair several inches long, his eyes became square, and he could fly to chase galloping horses."*

Ma Shihuang healed dragons; Kou Xian angled for fish. The *Arrayed Traditions of Immortals* recount: *"Ma Shihuang was the Yellow Emperor’s equine physician. A dragon descended and opened its mouth toward him. Shihuang said: ‘This dragon is ill.’ He needled beneath its lips, administered licorice broth, and cured it. Thereafter, dragons frequently emerged from the marshes, seeking his treatment. One day, he mounted a dragon and departed."*

Kou Xian was a man of Song who made his living by fishing. When he caught fish, he might sell them, release them, or keep them for his own meal. He delighted in planting *bili* vines and ate their flowers and fruit. Duke Jing of Song questioned him about the Way, but he refused to answer, so the duke had him killed. Several years later, he appeared squatting atop the gates of Song, playing the zither as he departed.

Nongyu charmed the phoenix; Xiao Shi ascended together. The *Arrayed Traditions of Immortals* state: *"Xiao Shi, a man of Duke Mu of Qin’s time, was skilled at playing the xiao and could summon peacocks and white storks. The duke had a daughter named Nongyu who admired him, so the duke gave her to him in marriage. He taught Nongyu to mimic the phoenix’s cry, and a phoenix alighted upon their terrace. One day, they rode the phoenix away together."*

Li Wen transmuted cinnabar; Shen Tai refined the Crimson Spring. The *Traditions of Divine Transcendents* state: *"Shen Wentai was a man of Jiuyi. He obtained the Way of the Crimson Spring Divine Elixir, which removes earthly impurities and restores youth and life. Wishing to dwell on Kunlun, he remained at ease for over two thousand years before transmitting it to Li Wenyuan. Using bamboo-root juice to boil cinnabar and the methods of Yellow-and-White Alchemy and expelling the Three Corpses, these arts emerged from these two men."*

Song Lun roamed the void; Ge Hong sat in stillness. The *Annals of Louguan* state: *"Song Lun, styled Dexuan, at the age of twenty-two recited the *Five Thousand-Character Writ* daily. He ingested Solomon’s seal and white wood, and in response, Lord Lao descended to bestow upon him the Way of the Central Effulgence and the Scripture of Penetrating the Real. Practicing his steps upon cliffs and crags, he could travel three thousand *li* in a day, crossing waves and traversing perilous lands without following roads or fords."*

The *Traditions of Daoist Learning* state: *"Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan, read ten thousand scrolls of books. Seeking the post of magistrate of Goulou, his true aim was cinnabar. He composed nearly one hundred and sixteen inner and outer chapters, a hundred scrolls of stele inscriptions, eulogies, poems, and rhapsodies, thirty scrolls of memorials, proclamations, and memorials to the throne, ten scrolls of the *Traditions of Divine Transcendents*, ten scrolls of the *Traditions of Good Historians*, ten scrolls of the *Traditions of Recluses*, ten scrolls of the *Traditions of Marvels*, three hundred and ten scrolls of excerpts from the Five Classics, histories, the hundred masters, methods, and miscellaneous matters, a hundred scrolls of the *Golden Casket Remedies*, and four scrolls of the *Handbook of Essential Prescriptions*. At the age of eighty-one, he sat bolt upright as if asleep and shed his mortal form."*

Zheng Yuan raised tigers; Juanzi cleaved fresh fish.

Zheng Siyuan was the master of Ge Hong. Once, in the mountain crags, he came upon two tiger cubs whose mother had already died. Hungry, he reared them until they grew large. Soon after, a male tiger arrived before his hut—it was the father of the two cubs. The three tigers came and went together, carrying his medicine sacks and scriptures, and relying on him. Later, they ascended Mount Guacang as immortals.

The *Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states: Juanzi was a man of Qi who ingested wood for three hundred years. While fishing at He Marsh, he caught a carp, and upon cutting it open, found a talisman in its belly that could summon clouds and rain.

Lou Shaoweng bowed upon the mountain; Song Lai swept the market.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* records: Long ago, Lou Shaoweng entered the mountains of Hua and bowed in reverence for twenty years. One day, he suddenly beheld the immortal of the Western Peak, who bestowed upon him the Dao of immortality. During the reign of Duke Zhuang of Chu, the market overseer Song Laizi diligently swept the marketplace. One day, a beggar suddenly appeared singing. Laizi recognized him as an immortal and followed him for thirteen years, whereupon he attained the Dao of immortality and became an immortal of the Central Peak.

Chen Yongbo and the Seven Stars; Wang Yao and the Bamboo Basket.

The *Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states: Chen Yongbo obtained the *Seven Stars Powder* formula. After ingesting it for twenty-eight days, he suddenly vanished without a trace. His elder brother, aged eleven, took the powder for twenty-eight days and likewise disappeared. The original formula states: "After thirty days of ingestion, one ascends as an immortal of one’s own accord."

Wang Yao, styled Boliao, treated illnesses for others, and none failed to recover. He used neither needles nor medicines, but merely had the patient sit upon a cloth mat, and in an instant, they would be cured. He possessed a small bamboo basket, several inches in length. One of his disciples was surnamed Qian.

One night, a heavy rain fell. Wang Yao instructed his disciple to carry the basket in the rain with a nine-jointed bamboo staff, yet his robes remained dry. Ascending a mountain, they entered a stone chamber where two men sat together. Yao opened the basket and took out three *jade-tongued huangs*, and the three played them in unison. After a long while, he returned the *huangs* to the basket and carried it back. The two men said to Yao: "Come again soon, and do not linger too long among mortals."

More than a hundred days later, Yao once more carried the basket himself and departed, never to return. Thirty years afterward, his disciple saw him on Mount Matishan.

Jie Jun’s bamboo staff; Zuo Ci’s wooden clogs.

The *Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states: Jie Xiang, styled Yuanze, was a man of Kuaiji possessed of profound Daoist arts. Sun Hao of Wu held him in great esteem and commanded him to perform transformations. When he planted melons and fruits, they would instantly grow ripe enough to eat. Once, the emperor craved *ziyu* fish stew. Xiang dug a square pit in the palace courtyard, filled it with water, and cast his line into it, catching fish. The emperor said: "Sichuan ginger cannot be obtained." Xiang replied: "Allow me to send someone to buy it." He gave the messenger five hundred coins, inscribed a talisman, and placed it inside a bamboo staff. Instructing the messenger to mount it and close his eyes, the man heard only the sound of rushing wind. He arrived in Shu, bought ginger, and returned—before the palace cook had finished slicing the fish.

Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, was likewise endowed with Daoist arts. When Sun Ce sought to kill him, Ci was driven before him, yet he walked slowly in wooden clogs and with a bamboo staff. Though Sun pursued him on horseback at full gallop, he remained a hundred paces behind. Later, when Cao Cao ordered his execution, only a bundle of straw was found in his place.

An old man with radiant white hair and a *qi*-carved purple *dou*.

*The Accounts of Divine Transcendents* records: During Emperor Wu of Han’s eastern progress, he saw an old man beneath Mount Tai whose head emitted a white radiance several feet high. The Emperor questioned him. The old man replied: "At eighty-five, I was withered with age, when a Daoist taught me to abstain from grains, subsist on wood-infused water, and fashion a spirit pillow from thirty-two medicinal ingredients. Now I am one hundred and eighty, and can walk three hundred *li* in a day."

Carved *Zidu*: When Emperor Wu of Han went on progress, he saw a man whose head bore a purple *qi* rising over a *zhang* in height. Questioned, the man replied: "I am now one hundred and thirty-eight, and what I practice is the Way of Pengzu." The Emperor sought to transmit it but could not. *Zidu* lived over two hundred years, consuming wood, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

The transmission of scriptures by the Riverside Master: Emperor Wen of Han grasped the essence. Master Ge the Transcendent said: Of the Riverside Master, none knew his name. During the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, he wove grass into a hut by the riverbank, where he constantly recited the *Daodejing*. Emperor Wen, fond of Laozi’s words, found several passages he could not fathom. He dispatched envoys to inquire, but the Master would not answer. The Emperor then went in person to question him: "Under all heaven, none is not the king’s land; within the realm’s bounds, none is not the king’s subject. Though you possess the Dao, you are still my subject—how can you not humble yourself? Why do you hold yourself so high? I can make men rich or noble, poor or base at will."

Suddenly, the Riverside Master clapped his hands, leapt into a seated posture, and floated gently into the void, rising several tens of *zhang* above the earth before replying: "I ascend not to heaven, am not burdened by men, nor dwell upon the earth—what subject am I to you? How can Your Majesty make me rich or noble, poor or base?" The Emperor then bowed his head in reverence and apology, whereupon the Riverside Master bestowed upon him two scrolls of *Commentaries on the Daodejing*.

Lou Zheng’s transformations, Mozi and the cinnabar elixir: *The Accounts of Divine Transcendents* records: Lou Zheng practiced the *Five Phases Record* of Mozi, ingesting cinnabar pills. At over eight hundred years of age, his complexion remained that of a child. He could transform one man into a hundred, a hundred into a thousand, a thousand into ten thousand. He could summon wind and clouds at will, walk upon water, and cause all the fish and turtles in the river to crawl ashore. From his mouth he could exhale five-colored *qi*, spanning ten *li* and reaching to the heavens.

He could ascend into the empty void, reaching everywhere without hindrance.

Mozi, whose given name was Di, was a grandee of Song. He authored the book *Mozi*. Skilled in warfare, he was especially adept at defense, once matching wits with Gongshu Ban in tactical ingenuity, only to abandon the cloud ladder as insufficient to attack Song and thus desist. Later, he entered Mount Di to study the Dao, where a divine transcendent bestowed upon him *Mozi’s Formula for Cinnabar Elixir, Spiritual Communication, and Five Phases Transformations*—twenty-five scrolls in all. Thereafter, he wandered among the Five Marchmounts, and none knew his end.

Sun Bo shared the same path, while Ban Meng bore a different name. *The Accounts of Divine Transcendents* records: Sun Bo practiced Mozi’s *Five Phases Elaborations*. He could cause grasses, trees, metals, stones, and living beings to burst entirely into fierce flames. Though others doused them with water, the fires would not extinguish—only when Bo himself willed them to cease would they die out. All things remained unscorched, as before. He could also lead several hundred followers to walk upon water without wetting or sinking. At times, he would spread mats upon the water’s surface, sitting there to drink, feast, and make merry. Moreover, he could come and go through solid stone. Later, he entered Mount Linlü to compound the elixir and ascend as a transcendent.

Class Meng was a woman who could soar through the air, sit suspended in the void, or sink into the earth. She could make roof tiles take flight, and with a point of her finger, cause the ground to yield a well. She could hold ink in her mouth and spray it onto paper to form complete texts. After consuming wine and elixirs for over four hundred years, she later departed for Mount Tiantai.

Wang Gang mastered the two qi, while Zhang Zhen commanded the Five Phases.

*The Accounts of Divine Transcendents* records: Tiān mén zǐ, surnamed Wang and named Gang, was skilled in nourishing and restorative arts, practicing the Way of the Mysterious and Plain. At one hundred eighty years of age, his complexion remained that of a maiden. He later ingested the Elixir of Pearls and ascended as a transcendent, entering the Dark Continent.

Zhang Zhen was Wang’s disciple, studying under Duǒ zǐ. He attained profound mastery of the Five Phases’ principles, using them to cultivate vitality, cure illness, and dispel misfortune. He could summon wind, clouds, thunder, and rain, and transform grasses, mustard seeds, tiles, and stones into the six livestock, dragons, or tigers. He could divide his form into hundreds or thousands of selves, walking across rivers and seas. He could spray water to form pearls and jade that never reverted. He could mold nine clays into a horse that traveled a thousand *li* in a day. He could exhale qi of five colors, cast talismans to summon fish and giant turtles, and enable others to see objects a thousand *li* away. He could murmur over water to cure illnesses instantly. Later, he entered Mount Kongtong to compound the elixir and ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

Nine Spirits repelled calamity, while the North Pole cherished essence.

*The Accounts of Divine Transcendents* records: Jiǔ líng zǐ, surnamed Huang and named Hua, attained the Way of Rejuvenation, Embryonic Breathing, and the essentials of the Five Phases. He could repel weapons, tigers, and wolves, subdue a thousand disasters, and dissolve ten thousand misfortunes. Devoted to this practice, he achieved great efficacy. He lived among mortals for five hundred years before ingesting the elixir and ascending as a transcendent.

Běi jí zǐ, surnamed Yin and named Heng, mastered the Way of Preserving Spirit, Cultivating Vitality, and Cherishing Essence. Its essential teaching declared: "To refine metal with metal is called the True; to refine man with man is called the Divine." Later, he ingested the Divine Elixir and ascended as a transcendent.

The Great Yang radiated brilliance, while the Absolute Abyss ensured long life.

*The Accounts of Divine Transcendents* records: Tài yáng zǐ, surnamed Lí and named Míng, received the Way of Yù zǐ. Fond of wine, he was often drunk. Yù zǐ reproached him, to which he replied: "A late learner, my nature remains unyielding, and worldly habits linger. Thus, I use wine to dissolve my arrogance." He excelled in cultivating the Way of the Five Phases. After five hundred years among mortals, his skin remained luminous, his face radiant, yet his temples had turned snowy white. Clad in the Seven Treasures’ protection, he deeply grasped its essentials and ascended as a transcendent through the elixir.

Jué dòng zǐ, surnamed Li and named Xiu, expounded: "The weak can restrain the strong; yin can overcome yang. Always act as if treading thin ice over a deep abyss—such is the Way of long life." At four hundred years of age, his countenance showed no decline.

She authored thirty scrolls and ascended as a transcendent through the elixir of cyclical return.

The Yang Maiden attained mastery; the Yin Maiden likewise achieved perfection.

*The Records of Divine Transcendents* states: The Yang Maiden, surnamed Zhū and named Yì, refined and augmented the Way of the Five Phases, her attainment verging on the wondrous. At two hundred and eighty years of age, her complexion bloomed like peach blossoms, her appearance that of a maiden of seventeen or eighteen. She departed as a transcendent through the divine elixir.

The Yin Maiden, surnamed Lú and named Jīn, was devoted to the Way of Yù zǐ but had not yet grasped its subtleties. She tended a wine stove when the Yang Master passed by and taught her the methods of nourishment and refinement, as well as the formula for steaming the elixir. She consumed it and ascended as a transcendent.

The Mysterious Maiden served ambrosia; the Southern Pole Master communed with the numinous.

*The Records of Divine Transcendents* states: The Mysterious Maiden, surnamed Xū and named Hé, was widowed in her youth. She studied the Way and mastered the teachings of Yù zǐ. Seated, she would conjure a traveling kitchen, her transformations boundless.

The Southern Pole Master, surnamed Liǔ and named Róng, could mold powder into eggs indistinguishable from real ones, coax cups into tortoise shells, and whisper water into fine wine. He ascended as a transcendent through the Cloud-Frost Elixir.

Lóu Fènglín held his breath; the Zhōu brothers recited scriptures.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Lóu Fènglín studied the Dao on Sōng Mountain for four hundred years. He could hold his breath for three days without exhaling and consumed yellow essence to attain immortality.

The Zhōu brothers—three in number—studied the Dao in the mountains of Cháng. After ninety-seven years, an elder bestowed upon them seven scrolls of true scripture. The three read together when suddenly a white deer appeared. Two of the brothers set the scriptures aside to watch, but the eldest, Zhōu, did not look. After reciting ten thousand times, he ascended in a sudden surge. His two brothers, distracted by the deer, saw the scriptures burst into flame and were thus unable to ascend—for their hearts were not steadfast.

Jiāng Bózhēn’s heart was upright; Xú Jìdào’s path was azure.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Jiāng Bózhēn practiced the Dao while gathering herbs when he encountered a transcendent. The transcendent had him stand in the midday sun, but his shadow fell askew. "Your heart is not upright," the transcendent said. He then instructed Bózhēn to face the sun when it had risen three measures high, opening his heart to its warmth until he felt its heat within—then his heart would be aligned. Bózhēn practiced this daily and attained the Dao.

Xú Jìdào studied transcendence when a divine transcendent taught him: "If you wish to learn the Dao, you must chant the *Celestial Register* at midday, tread upon the dual whites, and circle the two reds." He followed these instructions and attained the Dao.

Liú Ān welcomed scholars; the Eight Transcendents descended to his courtyard.

*The Accounts of Divine Transcendents* states: The Prince of Huáinán, Liú Ān, was devoted to the Dao. Upon hearing of reclusive scholars, he would journey a thousand *li* without hesitation, humbly offering rich gifts to welcome them. At that time, the Eight Transcendents were moved to descend to his courtyard. One could summon wind and rain at will, or conjure clouds and mist with a single step. One could bind tigers and leopards, or summon dragons and flood-dragons. One could divide his form and alter his appearance, sitting or standing yet vanishing at will. One could tread upon emptiness and walk through the void, crossing seas as if treading still waters. One could enter fire without burning, or plunge into water without getting wet. One could transform endlessly, acting as he pleased. One could avert disasters and transcend calamities, attaining longevity and enduring vision. One could transmute clay into gold and congeal mercury into silver.

Dīng Língwēi took the form of a crane, Sū Dān that of a deer, and Niú Xíng that of an ox. *The Scripture of Flying Celestial Transcendents* records: Dīng Lìngwēi entered the mountains at the age of seven to seek the Dao. After a thousand years, he transformed into a crane and returned to his hometown, alighting upon the capital’s ornamental pillar to sing: *"I am Dīng Lìngwēi of old—after a thousand years of Dao cultivation, I return at last."*

*The Account of Lord Sū* states: Sū Dān was a native of Bīn Prefecture. As a child, he herded cattle when his ox transformed into a white deer, and he attained the Dao. Later, he returned to his hometown and dwelled upon Niúpí Mountain. Officials from the prefecture and county came together to pay him homage.

At dusk, the Lord unfurled *The Yellow Court Scripture*, transforming it into a great bridge that spanned the city gate, and the officials ascended it to return home.

Earth-yellow of Dàzú, stone-honey of Táng Fèng.
*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Dàzú attained the Dao by ingesting earth-yellow. Táng Fèng attained the Dao by consuming the stone-honey of Mount Zhōngyuè.

Coptis of Mòróng, green fruit of Xiànmén.

Three Elders refined qi, Four Hoary Ones fed on lacquer.
*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: The Three Elders of Chánglíng refined yin and cultivated qi, thereby achieving the Dao. It is also said: The Four Hoary Ones of Shāng Mountain attained the Dao by ingesting the Nine Additions Powder and feeding on lacquer.

Miàozhēn entered the grotto, Jì Liàn’s coffin took flight.
*The Biographies of Daoist Scholars* records: The female transcendents Qián Miàozhēn studied the Dao from childhood and dwelled in the Gōuqǔ Cave Mountain. At the age of eighty-three, having completed her recitations of *The Yellow Court Scripture*, she bade farewell to her kin and friends, ingested a yellow-and-white elixir, and entered the Yàn Grotto for the night. The next morning, the female Daoist priests rushed to visit her, when suddenly they heard thunderous rumbling from the grotto. They beheld a dragon-and-phoenix carriage arriving from the northwest, which bore her away to ascend to heaven.

Jì Huìyīng studied the Dao on Tiānmù Mountain in Qián County. After shedding her mortal form, she was buried according to secular rites. Several years later, a sudden rumbling like thunder shook the mountain. The villagers went to investigate and saw her coffin planks soaring into the sky—the upper plank fell in the southern village, now called Shàngpiàn Village; the base plank fell in the northern village, now called Xiàbǎn Village. The side planks landed together in one place, now called Bǎntóng Village. Thus did she ascend to heaven.

Zhū Huáng encountered medicine, the Woman of Wèi stole pills.
*The Arrayed Biographies of Transcendents* records: Zhū Huáng of Guǎngyáng suffered from virulent ulcers. The Daoist Ruǎn Qiū gave him a seven-ingredient medicine, of which he took nine pills daily, and all his ailments were cured. He was taught to recite *The Yellow Court Scripture* and followed Qiū into Fúyáng Mountain. After eighty years, his beard and hair turned black, and he departed as a transcendent.

The Woman of Wèi was a wine-seller in Chén Market. A transcendent passed by and entrusted her with five scrolls of *The Plain Book*. She secretly copied its texts, mastered the arts of nurturing life, and never aged. Abandoning her home, she departed, and none knew her whereabouts.

Chángshēng halted the rain, Fānghuí sealed the pass.
*The Arrayed Biographies of Transcendents* records: Píng Chángshēng had died and revived several times. In Gǔchéng Village, a great flood suddenly surged forth, wreaking havoc. Chángshēng ascended Quēmén Mountain and cried out: "Chángshēng is here—let the rain and waters cease in five days!" And so it came to pass. Decades later, he became a gatekeeper at Huàyīn.

Fānghuí was a recluse of Yáo’s time. He refined and consumed mica. In the late reign of Xià Qǐ, he served as an official, but was robbed and confined in a chamber. Fānghuí transformed his body and escaped, then sealed the door with his seal, leaving the mark of Fānghuí. The people of the time said: "With a single pellet of Fānghuí’s clay, any pass may be opened."

Qiú Shēng was the Wood Minister; Zǐxiān, the bamboo staff. *The Arrayed Biographies of Transcendents* records: Qiú Shēng served as the Wood Minister in Tāng’s time. He consumed pine resin, built his own stone chamber, and departed as a transcendent. King Wǔ of Zhōu visited his chamber and offered sacrifices to him.

Hū Zǐxiān was a diviner who lived over a hundred years. One night, a transcendent arrived bearing a bamboo staff and called out to Zǐxiān. He then gave a wine-seller’s old woman and Zǐxiān each a bamboo to ride—these were dragons. They ascended Huàyīn Mountain and departed as transcendents.

Zhū Zhòng traded pearls; Rén Guāng sold elixirs. *The Arrayed Biographies of Transcendents* records: Zhū Zhòng, a man of Kuàijī, often sold pearls in the marketplace. During Empress Gāo’s reign, he was sought for three-inch pearls. Zhòng presented them and was rewarded with five hundred gold pieces. Princess Lǔ Yuán privately gave him seven hundred gold, and Zhòng offered her four-inch pearls. In Emperor Jǐng’s time, he again presented dozens of three-inch pearls before vanishing, and none knew his whereabouts.

Rén Guāng, a man of Shàngcài, was skilled in preparing elixirs and sold them among the streets and alleys. Zhào Jiǎnzǐ summoned him to Bǎitī Mountain, and for three generations, none knew his whereabouts.

Shāngqiū tended swine; Táoyǐ forged metal. Shāngqiū Zǐxū, a man of Gāoyì, enjoyed herding swine, playing the reed pipe, consuming atractylodes and calamus, and drinking water. He neither hungered nor aged, and people saw him for generations. After three hundred years, none knew his whereabouts.

Táo Ān-gōng was a master smith of Liù’ān. One day, his furnace flames scattered upward in a violet blaze that pierced the sky, and suddenly a vermilion phoenix alighted upon the forge. It declared, “Ān-gōng communes with Heaven. On the seventh day of the seventh month, a crimson dragon shall come to bear you aloft.” When the appointed day arrived, the crimson dragon descended amid a great rain, and Ān mounted it to ascend into the heavens.

Huáng of Wǔlíng and the Táoyuán recluses Liú and Ruǎn:
Tradition holds that the fisherman Huáng Dàozhēn, a man of Wǔlíng, once poled his boat into a peach-blossom grotto and there encountered immortals. Liú Chén and Ruǎn Zhào, natives of Kè County, had gone to gather herbs on Tiānmǔ Peak when they lost their way into the same peach-blossom grotto. After meeting the immortals and passing half a year, they returned home to find seven generations of descendants already born.

Chūpíng and the pine resin; Fèng Gāng and the floral elixirs:
The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records that Huáng Chūpíng of Dān Creek was sent by his family to herd sheep at the age of fifteen. There he met a Daoist who took him into Jīnhuá Mountain, where he remained for forty years. His elder brother Chūqǐ later sought him out and, upon finding him, asked about the sheep. Chūpíng replied that they were on the eastern hillside. When they went to look, they saw only white stones. Chūpíng shouted at them, and the stones all transformed into sheep. The two brothers then consumed pine resin and *fuling* together for ten thousand days, after which they could sit or stand at will and vanish, ascending into the heavens as one. Chūpíng changed his surname to Chì and was styled Sōngzǐ; Chūqǐ was styled Chìxūzǐ. The present-day Chìsōng Abbey in Zī Prefecture marks the site.

Fèng Gāng, a man of Yuányáng, was accustomed to gathering the flowers of a hundred herbs, steeping them in water, sealing them in mud, and burying them for a hundred days before forming them into pills. When one pill was placed in the mouth of the dead, they revived at once. Gāng consumed the elixir himself and, never aging, departed as an immortal.

Lǚ Gōng’s encounter with immortals; Shěn Jiàn’s entrusted maidservants:
Lǚ Gōng, styled Wénjìng, had from youth been devoted to consuming elixirs. While gathering herbs on Tàiháng Mountain, he suddenly beheld three immortals, who asked him, “Do you desire long life? One of us is surnamed Lǚ, styled Wénqǐ, and since you share our surname, you are fit for immortality.” He followed them for two days, whereupon they bestowed upon him a secret formula, saying, “The two days you have spent with us are already two hundred years.” When he returned to his village, he found that more than ten generations of descendants had passed. A certain Lǚ Xí, who had become a Daoist, wept with joy and prostrated himself in welcome, and Gōng transmitted the formula to him. Thereafter, his family knew neither old age nor death, and all attained transcendence.

Shěn Jiàn, a man of Dānyáng, had mastered the arts of *daoyin* and elixir consumption. Whenever the sick beheld him, they were cured. Once, before setting out on a long journey, he entrusted two maidservants, three servants, one donkey, and ten sheep to a caretaker, giving each a single pill. For three years, none of them ate or drank. When Jiàn returned, he gave each another pill, and they resumed eating and drinking as before. Thereafter, Jiàn could fly through the air at will, departing and returning as he pleased. After three hundred years, none knew his whereabouts.

Huá’s skin-shedding; Lè the Eternal Youth:
The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records that Huá Zǐqī, a disciple of Master Jiǎolǐ, obtained the *Hidden Formula of the Numinous Treasure* and compounded its ingredients into an elixir. After consuming it, he could walk five hundred *li* in a day and lift a thousand *jīn* with ease. Every year, he shed his skin ten times. Later, he departed as an immortal.

Lè Zǐcháng, a native of Qí, received the *Giant Winthred and Red Pine Powder Formula* from the transcendent of Huòlín. Those who consumed it daily—serpents transformed into dragons, and men reverted to youthful boys. After prolonged ingestion, at one hundred eighty years of age, his complexion remained that of a maiden. His nine wives and children all partook of it; the elderly regained vigor, and the young ceased to age. Later, he ascended as an immortal from Láoshèng Mountain.

Shūqīng refused to serve; Bóyáng feigned death.
The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records that Wèi Shūqīng of Zhōngshān attained transcendence through ingesting mica. One day, as Emperor Wǔ of Hàn idled in his palace hall, he suddenly beheld a man riding a cloud-borne white deer alight before the steps. Startled, the emperor asked who he was. The man replied, "I am Wèi Shūqīng of Zhōngshān." The emperor demanded, "Are you not my subject?" Shūqīng made no answer and instantly vanished. The emperor deeply regretted his words.

Wèi Bóyáng, a man of Wú, entered the mountains to compound the divine elixir, accompanied by three disciples and a white dog. When the elixir was complete, he fed it to the dog, which died. He then consumed it himself and likewise perished. One disciple, surnamed Yú, ingested it and also died. The other two abandoned the elixir and departed. Bóyáng then revived, taking with him the disciple who had consumed the elixir and the white dog, and left. Encountering a woodcutter, he wrote a letter to send to his hometown and his two remaining disciples. Bóyáng authored the *Triplex Unity* and *Five Phases Correlations*, comprising two scrolls, which exhaustively expound the principles of the divine elixir.

Fāngshuò as Jupiter; Fùyuè as the Tail of the Winnowing Basket.
The *Precepts on Ascending to Perfection* states: Dōngfāng Shuò, styled Mànqiàn, served Emperor Wǔ of Hàn and consumed the *Primary Divine Pill*. By the reign of Emperor Xuān, he abandoned his post and sold medicines in Kuàijī. Later, he ascended to become Jupiter. The *Zhuāngzǐ* also relates: Fùyuè attained the Dao and served Wǔ Dīng, governing the realm. Mounting the Eastern Ridge and riding the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, he joined the ranks of the stars.

Shěn Xī’s three chariots; Ān Shì’s two adepts.
The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records that Shěn Xī of Wú Commandery studied the Dao in Shǔ. His ability to dispel calamities and cure illnesses, aiding the common folk, moved Heaven with his merit. One day, while traveling with his wife, they encountered a white deer chariot, a green dragon chariot, and a white tiger chariot, their attendants clad in crimson, bearing spears and swords. They addressed Shěn Xī, saying, "You have rendered service to the people, and the Yellow Elder now dispatches immortals to welcome you." Three transcendents presented Shěn Xī with a white jade tablet, a green jade scepter, and a vermilion jade script, whereupon they bore him aloft to Heaven.

Chén Ānshì was a retainer of Guàn Shūběn. Whenever he traveled and encountered birds or beasts, he would step aside to avoid them, never harming any creature. At thirteen, Shūběn developed an interest in the Dao. One day, two immortals, having transformed into scholars, visited Shūběn. Unaware of their true nature, Shūběn treated them with insufficient reverence. They then said to Ānshì, "You are inclined toward the Dao and may be instructed." They gave him two elixir pills to consume, after which he no longer required food or drink. Shūběn then became his disciple. As Ānshì prepared to ascend to Heaven, he transmitted his teachings to Shūběn, who also departed as an immortal.

Eight hundred generations; Lǐ the Beggar in the marketplace.
The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Lǐ the Eight Hundred, a man of Gǔ, bore a name unknown to his contemporaries. As his age was reckoned to exceed eight hundred years, he was thus called. His movements were unpredictable. Recognizing that Táng Gōngfáng was teachable, he feigned sores and ulcers to test him.

The medicines proved ineffective, for it was said they required licking by a human tongue. Gōngfáng then ordered two maidservants to do so, but to no avail. He himself attempted it, yet still without success. Finally, he had his wife lick them. It was then said: "Three *hú* of fine wine are needed to bathe in." After bathing, his body became smooth as congealed lard. Thereupon, he had Gōngfáng, his wife, and the three maidservants all bathe together in the wine, and their complexions became like those of children. Lǐ then transmitted the *Elixir Canon* to Gōngfáng, who compounded and consumed it, ascending as an immortal.

As for Lǐ Ā, a man of Shǔ, he was seen by generations of his countrymen, never aging, and always begging for food in the marketplace. There was one Gǔ Qiáng who constantly followed him. When Qiáng was eighteen, Ā appeared to be a man of fifty. By the time Qiáng was over eighty, Ā remained unchanged. Suddenly, he announced to others: "Kunlun summons me; I must depart." And he never returned.

*Record of the Garden of Immortals*, Scroll One, ends.
(Note: "面" should read "而.")

*Record of the Garden of Immortals*, Scroll Two
By Wáng Sōngnián, a Daoist of Tiāntái Mountain.

The Calf-Child altered his appearance, and the Cassia Father transformed his visage.

According to the *Biographies of Immortals*: The Calf-Child was a man of Yè who consumed pine seeds and *fuling* for a hundred years. At times he appeared youthful, at others aged; sometimes handsome, sometimes ugly. One day, he led a yellow calf to the house of Yáng Dū to buy wine. The daughter of the house took a liking to him and followed him out. He plucked peaches and plums, all of which tasted sweet and fragrant. The villagers lay in wait and pursued him, but though they seized the calf’s ear and ran, they could not catch him. Decades later, he was seen beneath Pān Mountain, selling peaches and plums in winter.

The Cassia Father was a man of Xiànglín whose complexion shifted—now black, now white, now yellow, now red. He regularly consumed cassia bark and leaves, blending them with turtle brains into a thousand pills. To this day, cassia pills are found south of Jīngzhōu. One morning, he drifted into the clouds and departed.

Wù Guāng ate cress and leeks, while Ruǎn Qiū favored lotus and scallions.

Wù Guāng, a man of the Xià dynasty, had ears seven inches long. Fond of the qín, he consumed the roots of cress and leeks. When Tāng offered him the realm, he refused, carried a stone on his back, and drowned himself in the Liáo River. Four hundred years later, in the time of Wǔ Dīng, he was seen again.

Ruǎn Qiū was a Daoist of Qū Mountain, his hair unbound, his ears seven inches long, his mouth toothless. He walked four hundred *li* in a day. He constantly cultivated scallions and lotus. For over a hundred years, no one knew of him.

Chì Fǔ consumed cinnabar; the Hairy Woman ate pine needles.
Chì Fǔ, a man of Bāróng, served as registrar of the Bìyào Shrine. He ingested cinnabar and saltpeter, taking them for thirty years, and reverted to the appearance of a boy. His hair grew long and turned red, and in his palm appeared the mark of a red axe. The Hairy Woman of Huà Mountain, named Yù Jiāng, claimed to have been a palace lady of Qín who fled into the mountains to escape calamity. A Daoist taught her to eat pine needles, after which she knew neither hunger nor cold, and green hair grew over her body.

Wáng Qiáo rode a crane; Língyáng angled for dragons.
Wáng Qiáo, styled Zǐjìn, loved to play the *shēng* and imitate the cry of the phoenix. The Daoist Fúqiū Gōng took him up Sōng Mountain, and thirty years later, on the seventh day of the seventh month, he rode a crane into the heavens from Wéi’s Mountain. The *Scripture of Immortals* states: his immortal rank was as Attendant to the Lord of Dawn, overseer of the Five Peaks, director of the Peach Orchard Perfected, and master of the Golden Court Grotto of Tiāntái. Língyáng Zǐmíng loved fishing; once he caught a white fish whose belly contained a book teaching the method of ingesting *wǔzhī*. He then ascended Huáng Mountain, gathered the five resins, and consumed them for three years, after which a dragon came to welcome him up Língyáng Mountain.

The Stream Father ate melon seeds; Qí Míng guarded the officials.
The Stream Father, a man of Nánjùn, lived in the mountains. An immortal came to buy his melons and taught him to refine melon seeds, storing them with cassia, aconite, and angelica fruit. At the spring equinox, he ate them, and after twenty years, he could fly. Qí Míng of Húntíng was twenty when he found dragon hatchlings in a pond—over a thousand, resembling tiny officials. He raised them in a thatched hut. As the dragons grew, they gradually departed. Fifty years later, a flood destroyed his hut, and one day he rode a dragon back to Húntíng.

Jìzhǔ in Cháng’ān; Xīn Xuán in Wú-Yuè.
The *Biographies of Daoist Scholars* records: Sīmǎ Jìzhǔ told fortunes in the Cháng’ān market. Sòng Zhōng and Jiǎ Yì, then serving as grand masters, met him and asked, “Why does your profession remain so humble?” He replied, “Free within from the burdens of hunger and cold, untroubled without by the fear of robbery, above untainted by killing, below unharmed by injury—this is the Dao of the noble man. The phoenix does not herd with sparrows and swallows; what do you gentlemen understand?” Later, Sòng Zhōng was punished for an offense, and Jiǎ Yì was stricken with remorse. Yet no one ever learned where Jìzhǔ had gone. The *Hidden Instructions for Ascending Perfection* states: he received the method of the Western Numinous Sword’s release in the great office of Wěiyǔ Mountain, consumed the radiance of bright cinnabar, and embraced the glow of Fúchén. His appearance was like a woman’s, his beard three feet long.

Xīn Xuánzǐ loved wandering mountains, his aspiration fixed on ascending the void with Zǐjìn and treading the mysterious with Língyáng, hence his name Xuánzǐ, styled Yánqī. In his own account, he wrote: “The Queen Mother of the West pitied my austerities; the Emperor of the Northern Dèng lamented my devotion. To this day, two hundred years have passed.”

The Great Emperor further commanded him to assume the title of Marquis of the Eastern Sea, overseeing the divine spirits of Wú and Yuè—yet he had not yet donned his kingfisher-green robes to soar through the nine skies, nor danced upon the clouds to roam the ten directions. Xǔ Mài wandered the mountains and forests, his dragon-like majesty dwelling in cavernous grottos.

The *True Records* states: Xǔ Mài’s childhood name was Āyìng. The *Traditions of Daoist Scholars* notes: his resolve lay in departure without return, and so he renamed himself Yuǎnyóu. In his twentieth year, he sought out Guō Pú, who divined for him and declared: “Your supreme fortune descends from heaven; you should study the Way of ascending beyond.” Thereupon he became a disciple of Bào Jìng. Later, he journeyed with like-minded companions through famous mountains, consuming atractylodes and abstaining from grains, able to hold his breath for a thousand cycles. Initially, he dwelt in Tónglú, Xīnchéng, and Lín’ān, constructing pavilions wherever he stayed, opening rear gates to ascend the mountains in search of herbs, often gone for months. He would say: “Āyìng delights in mountains and forests as a fish delights in water.”

The *True Records* further states: he studied under Wáng Shìlóng, ingesting the jade elixir to refine his brain’s essence. The Elder of Lóngwēi was a perfected adept of Bāo Mountain. None knew his surname; he styled himself the Recluse. When King Hélǘ of Wú ascended Bāo Mountain, he commanded the Recluse to explore the depths of its caverns. The Recluse entered and returned after one hundred seventy-four days, reporting: “I traversed over seven thousand *li* and suddenly beheld a thousand paths and a hundred roads, each leading to golden-walled palaces and jade towers, yet all devoid of people. A placard at the city gate read: *The Heavenly Empress’s Separate Palace*. Within a chamber of jade lay a scroll of red script; I bowed, took it as a token, and upon emerging, presented it to the king. It proved to be the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Sacred Treasure*, hidden by the Great Yǔ.”

Xián’ān savored licorice, Bóyù ground pine. The *Biography of Lady Wèi* records: her name was Xián’ān. In her youth, she suffered many illnesses, and the Perfected King of Pristine Emptiness instructed her: “To study the Dao, first dispel sickness and eliminate ailments. Only when the five viscera are full, the flesh lustrous, the marrow brimming, and the ears and eyes keen may one cultivate the Way.” He then transmitted to her the formula for licorice pills. After preparing and consuming them, all her illnesses were cured. Later, she attained the Dao and became the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Marchmount, overseeing life and destiny.

Chǔ Bóyù was a native of Qiántáng. At sixteen, his family arranged a marriage for him. As his bride entered in her carriage, he leapt over the wall and departed, secluding himself for twenty years on the central peak of Tiāntái. Woodcutters glimpsed him beneath layered cliffs, his complexion serene, with only two baskets of pine sawdust beside him. Thus, his fame spread near and far.

Emperor Gao of Qi summoned him, but he refused to answer the call and instead relocated to Mount Dahuo, where he ascended as an immortal.

Divine elixirs were crafted by Ma Ming, while arts of the Dao were mastered by Ge Yue.

From *The Biographies of Divine Transcendents*:
Ma Mingsheng, a native of Linzi, originally bore the surname He and the style Junxian. In his youth, he was wounded by bandits. On the road, he encountered a divine person who gave him medicine and saved his life, reviving him. He then became a disciple of Master Anqi. Traveling throughout the world, he endured hardships and studied diligently, eventually receiving the *Scripture of the Golden Fluid Elixir of Great Clarity*. He entered the mountains to refine the elixir. Though the medicine was completed, he did not yet delight in ascending to heaven, so he consumed half a dose and became an earthbound immortal. For over five hundred years, he wandered the Nine Provinces before ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

Ge Yue, styled the Yellow Reed Master, had those suffering from illness send their names to him from a thousand *li* away, and all were cured. He could restrain tigers, wolves, insects, and flying birds, preventing them from moving. He could make water flow upward for one or two *li*. During great droughts across the land, he could summon dragons to bring rain. He could lift a thousand *jin* and run as swiftly as a galloping horse. Above his head, a five-colored *qi* rose over a *zhang* in height. At the age of two hundred and eighty, he one day mounted a dragon and departed.

The Whistling Master rode fire, while Shi Men emitted smoke.

From *The Arrayed Biographies of Transcendents*:
The Whistling Master, in his youth, mended shoes in the northern market of Quzhou. No one knew his age, only that he never aged. When people sought his teachings, he would not reveal them.

Only Liang Mother obtained his method of fire, whereupon he ascended Sanliang Mountain to bid her farewell, then rode dozens of blazing torches into the heavens.

Shi Men was a disciple of the Whistling Master. Having mastered the fire *Dao*, he favored eating peach and plum blossoms and served as the dragon master for Xia King Kong Jia. Kong Jia killed and buried him, but one day wind and rain carried him away, and smoke and fire arose of their own accord from the mountain forests.

Wei Dao’s heart remained steadfast; Huang Guan’s trials were wholly met.

*The True Sayings* states: Jin Wei Dao studied transcendence on Fan Zhong Mountain for twelve years. A transcendent tested him by suspending a stone weighing one hundred thousand *jin* in midair with a single white hair, placing Wei Dao beneath it. Wei Dao’s heart remained unshaken and unwavering, standing beneath it for twelve years, whereupon he was bestowed with divine elixir and ascended at midday.

Huang Guanzi, from youth devoted to the Dao, cut his morning meals and performed rites, seeking longevity. After forty-nine years, he entered Qiao Mountain, where a transcendent tested him with one hundred and forty trials, all of which he fulfilled. Thus he obtained the golden elixir and, reciting *The Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, ascended at midday.

Zi Zhu laboured as a hired hand; Xia Qiu was cast aside.

From *The Arrayed Biographies of Transcendents*:
Zi Zhu, whose speech was Chu-accented and voice faint, approached the King of Jiangdu, saying: “Master Xiao hired me as a labourer for three hundred years.” When asked where Master Xiao resided, he replied: “On Longmei Mountain.” The king dispatched envoys to meet the master, who was hairy-bodied with broad ears, his hair unbound as he played the zither. He said: “Zi Zhu is the ninth-generation descendant of my neighbour.” Xia Qiu Zhong was a man of Xiao. He sold medicines in the market for over a hundred years. Suddenly, an earthquake struck, collapsing dozens of homes, and those near water were ruined. Zhong died, and people cast his corpse into the water, taking his medicines to sell. Zhong then appeared in furs, reclaiming his medicines. Those who had discarded his body kowtowed in remorse. Zhong said: “I resent that you made others know of me. I depart now.” Later, he returned as a courier for the Hu king, coming to Xiao—where in the north he was called a banished transcendent.

Yin Sheng begged for alms; the wine merchant earned ten thousand coins.

Yin Sheng was a beggar beneath the Wei Bridge. He often begged in the marketplace, where people grew weary of him and splashed him with filth, yet his clothes remained unstained. The prefectural governor tried to detain him with a cangue, but he reappeared begging in the market. Soon after, the house of the one who had splashed him collapsed. Thus an old song went: “See the beggar boy, give him fine wine, to spare your house from ruin.”

The wine merchant was a brewer in the Liang marketplace. His wine was excellent, earning him ten thousand coins daily. Feigning a mistake, the wine merchant was driven out by the owner, and the wine turned sour. Merchants often sent their daughters to welcome him back. He came and went for over a hundred years, then returned as a Liang minister, teaching the people to cultivate vegetables, saying: “In three years, there will be great famine.” His words proved true. Suddenly, he removed his official seal and departed.

Wang Zhi’s axe-handle rotted, Master Xu slept drunk.

The *Tradition* states: Wang Zhi was a man of Xi’an village. By nature, he was fond of chess. Once, while gathering firewood in the mountains, he saw two immortals playing beneath a stone bridge. Zhi leaned on his axe-handle and sat watching the game. When the match ended, he rose—only to find the axe-handle had rotted away. Returning home, he discovered centuries had passed. The present-day Lanke Mountain in Quzhou marks the site.

Master Xu was a man of Jinhua village. Entering the mountains, he saw several Daoists drinking wine and was offered a cup. After drinking, he fell into a drunken stupor. When he awoke, the place had become a lake. Returning home, he found generations of descendants had come and gone. To this day, Xu’s Lake remains in Jinhua Mountain.

Shang Qiu traversed fire, Taiyi floated upon lotuses.

The *Immortals’ Tradition* states: Shang Qiu Kai was a man of Jin. From youth, he loved the Dao and dwelled on Guye Mountain. He could tread through water and fire without scorching or drowning. At times, he rescued capsized boats; at others, he sighed upon water to extinguish great fires. Skilled in painting, he remained ever poor. He lodged as a guest in the Fan household, where other guests mocked and belittled him. One day, the Fan estate was engulfed in flames. None of the guests could save it, but Shang Qiu Kai alone entered the fire to retrieve silks, emerging unsoiled and unburned. As the blaze raged, he faced the guests, sighed upon the water, and the fire was quenched. Only then did they suspect him a divine being and humbly apologize. Later, he entered Qin Mountain and was seen no more.

The *Han Remnant History* further records of the Great One: During the Yuanshou era of Emperor Wu’s reign, a diviner reported that the star of the Great One had vanished. The emperor summoned Dongfang Shuo to inquire into the matter. Shuo replied, "When this star disappears from sight, the Dao/Way is present in the world, bringing fortune and longevity to ruler and people alike." The emperor asked, "How may this be verified?" Shuo answered, "Let Your Majesty dispatch men to the southeastern shores of rivers and seas to prepare rites and offerings in welcome. If one arrives—whether by boat or riding a crane, distinct from ordinary mortals—then the sign is confirmed. Upon sighting, cut bamboo to erect an altar and offer libations in thanks to the Supreme Emperor."

The emperor followed Shuo’s counsel and sent forth to welcome the figure. That very month, the governor of Kuaiji Commandery reported: "Upon the sea appeared a man with forked horns, a face like jade, and a fine beard. Naked but for a waist-covering of *ji* leaves, he rode a single crimson lotus leaf, over a *zhang* in length, reclining upon it. In his hand he held a yellow scroll. He drifted ashore from the northeast." The officials burned incense and prostrated in welcome, approaching within a hundred paces—when suddenly clouds and mist arose to obscure him. When the mist dispersed, he was nowhere to be found.

The yellow scroll drifted ashore, landing upon the bank—retrieved, it was not even damp. Its characters gleamed with radiance, all in celestial seal-script, yet none could decipher them. It was presented to the emperor. The emperor ordered Shuo to examine it, who declared: "This is the *Fire Pearl Sutra* of the Upper Realms." Some call it *The String of Pearls*. "Li consumes jade, and the cassia-child’s leprosy is cured."

Li, named Shenfu, was a native of Zhongyang in Fengyi. He studied the Dao under Master Wang of Hongnong, mastering the art of jade-consumption, the practice of *Dunjia* concealment, and the pacing of the Dipper’s steps. Though over a hundred years old, when conversing with guests, only his voice was heard—his form unseen. Later, he entered the Western Marchmount and never emerged.

As for the cassia-child, his name is unknown. He served as Inspector of Xuzhou, afflicted with leprosy for over a decade, untreatable by physicians. Turning his mind to the Dao, he later encountered the Daoist Master Yu, who bade him resign his post to serve as Yu’s attendant. For three years he tended horses, his resolve unwavering. The master bestowed upon him an elixir and one hundred fifty scrolls. After consuming the cassia, his leprosy was cured. At one hundred ninety years, his complexion was that of a child. He sold medicines in Chengdu, then returned to the Western Marchmount and did not reappear.

Cai of Fangping’s Dao, Zi Xuan as his disciple. *The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, attained the Dao. He dwelled in the household of the Grand Commandant Chen Jiu for over thirty years, then one day shed his form like a cicada’s molt. Later, he entered the Kuocang Mountains, passing the home of Cai Jing in Xumen. Sensing Jing’s destined affinity for transcendence, he imparted essential teachings before departing. Jing, too, shed his form like a cicada’s molt. Ten years later, he returned home. On the seventh day of the seventh month, Lord Wang arrived, accompanied by divine musicians, regalia, and feathered canopies—cloud chariots arrayed across the sky. After Lord Wang took his seat, he dispatched a messenger to summon Ma Gu. Once she arrived, each prepared a feast. Gold platters and jade cups held delicacies, most of which were blossoms, their fragrance perfuming the inner and outer chambers. They tore dried meat to share, claiming it was unicorn jerky. Ma Gu, since her service to her uncle, had witnessed the Eastern Sea transform into mulberry fields three times. Recently, the waters of Penglai had receded by half—would it soon become dry land? When the wine ran out, a messenger was sent to the Alchemical Mother of Yuhang to fetch more. Upon his return, he brought a single jar, holding about five *dou*. Ma Gu’s nails were like a crow’s. Jing thought to himself: *How fine it would be to scratch her back!* He heard the whistling of a whip through the air—it was striking his own back.

*The Biography of Master Su* states: His name was Zixuan. Initially, he studied under Qin Gao, then under Master Qiu, who taught him the pine-resin formula, saying: "I have consumed it for two thousand seven hundred years." Later, he studied under Master Juan, who transmitted the method for subduing corpse-worms, the Way of the Three Ones, and the essentials of guarding the Mud Pill and Nine Palaces. On the sixth day of the third month in the second year of Shenjue during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, he ascended to the northwest upon clouds, riding a dragon, becoming the Upper Minister of the Dark Continent.

Juan was the one who, upon gutting a fish, discovered a written message within.

The three Mao brothers, the two Xu—father and son. *The Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* states: The Great Mao Lord, styled Shushen, entered Mount Da at eighteen to study the Dao under the Western City Lord Wang. On Guishan, he obtained the Nine-Cycled Returning Elixir. By the time of Emperor Yuan of Han, celestial officials descended to confer the Nine Bestowments of the Jade Emperor, appointing him as the Perfected of Supreme Primordiality, Upper Perfected Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, and Lord Controller of Life for Wu and Yue. He governed the Red City Grotto of Tiantai. His younger brother, styled Jiwei, consumed the Nine-Cycled Elixir of the Supreme Ultimate, becoming the Lord of Fixed Records for Wu and Yue. The youngest brother, styled Sihe, studied the same arts as the middle Mao, becoming the Lord Protector of Life for the Three Offices. He was enfeoffed as the Keeper of River Sources, overseeing the cultivation of lingzhi mushrooms.

Mao Meng rode a dragon, Xiao Zhen drove tigers. *The Traditions of Daoist Scholars* states: Mao Meng, styled Chucheng, was the great-grandfather of the Three Mao Lords. He studied under Master Guigu. In the thirty-first year of the First Emperor of Qin, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight upon clouds, riding a dragon. Xiao Kangzhen entered Yishan to study the Dao. At forty, he consumed only catalpa leaves, forming pills from various blossoms. He also gathered mulberry leaves mixed with Solomon’s seal and other herbs to decoct and consume. At eighty, his white hair turned black, and his fallen teeth regrew. He constantly recited the *Yellow Court Classic*. Often, tigers would crouch before his bed. When he wished to rise, he first drove them away with a staff, and they would precede him like dogs.

Feng Chang encountered Peng, Peng Zong studied under Du. *The Traditions of Louguan* states: Feng Chang, styled Yanshou, was appointed Gentleman of the Palace Archives by King Xuan of Zhou. At forty-one, he retired from office to study the Dao, reciting the *Five Thousand Characters* and consuming asparagus. Dwelling on Mount Zhongnan, he encountered the Perfected Peng, who descended in a chariot drawn by a white tiger to his oratory, bestowing upon him the *Hidden Writ of the Supreme*. During the reign of King Ping, he ascended to heaven, becoming the Perfected of the Western Marchmount. Peng Zong, styled Faxian, at twenty studied under Master Du, who transmitted the *Elixir Canon of Five Thousand Words* and the Way of the Feminine One. His cultivation bore results. Often, several divine lamps would float in the air, illuminating his chamber. He could merge three days and nights into a single breath and recite the *Five Thousand Characters* twice in one exhalation. At one hundred fifty, during the reign of King Li, he ascended to heaven, becoming the Perfected of Grand Clarity. Master Du, whose given name was Chong and style Xuanyi, heard that the Perfected Yin had attained the Dao, so he later resided in Yin’s former dwelling for twenty-five years. There, he cultivated for over two decades, and the Perfected Zhan descended to his bedchamber, transmitting immortal formulas. After compounding and consuming them, his body emanated jadelike radiance. At one hundred twenty during the reign of King Mu of Zhou, he ascended to heaven, becoming the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate.

Wang Tan ascended upon clouds, Zhou Liang danced with birds. Wang Tan, styled Yangbo, was called a "recluse" by Emperor Wen of Han.

At thirty-six years of age, he recited the *Five Thousand Characters* with solemn devotion. Often scattering gold and silk to relieve the starving and freezing, he cast wealth upon the roads, ensuring all who abandoned their lives for righteousness received his grace and bounty. Moved by his compassion, the Perfected Zhao transformed into a mad beggar, pleading for alms year after year without weariness. The Perfected, pitying him, bestowed a divine formula. Later, on Mount Zhongnan, he encountered the Celestial Maiden of Grand Mystery, who transmitted the arts of concealing radiance and transforming form. Thereafter, he could shine with the brilliance of sun and moon, merging and shifting with clouds and mist.

An old friend once said to him, "I hear you, Master of the Dao, excel in transformation—might you perform a trick?" He then transformed his body into a tree, and the man took an axe to chop it. He next became a stone, and the man set fire to burn it. He turned into flowing water, and the man piled earth to dam it. He became fire, and the man doused it with water. He took the form of a crow, and the man cast a net to trap it. He became a fierce tiger, and the man struck with blades. Finally, he turned into a corpse, and the friend, terrified, fled. After several *li*, he saw Wang Tan as before and bowed in apology. Then, transforming into floating clouds, Wang Tan ascended high, his Dao beyond all measure.

Zhou Liang, styled Taiyi, was born after his mother carried him for fifteen months. At nineteen, he stood eight *chi* tall. He studied the Dao under Yao Tan in Wei. Prince Wang Zijin summoned him to play the zither and flute, and together they roamed the Yi and Luo rivers, their music ringing like gold and jade, causing all the birds to dance in unison. At the age of one hundred and ninety, during the reign of King Lie of Zhou, he ascended to heaven.

The immortal Ma Gu of Donghai and the old woman of Yu Hang—accounts of them are detailed in the biographies of Wang Yuan and Cai Jing. The *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* states: Xian the Immortal Duke, named Xuan, at eighteen, cultivated the Dao with focused devotion on Mount Tiantai. Three perfected beings descended and bestowed upon him the various scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, along with the rites of the Golden Register and Yellow Register fasts. The Three Masters invoked during present-day fasts are these same three perfected beings who descended with the scriptures.

The *Scripture of Supreme Purity* states: Master Wang, named Xiang, styled Zideng, was the son of Wang Kai, the Third Elder of the Han Palace. At thirty-one, he entered Mount Hua to study the Dao. The Perfected One of Western Liang descended and taught him the method of the Azure Essence grain diet. Later, on Mount Xicheng, he studied under Master Zongzhen, who transmitted to him the various methods of Supreme Purity. He attained the Dao and became the Perfected One of Pure Emptiness.

The Celestial Master of Orthodox Unity, and Yu Ji of *Great Peace*. The *Scripture of Orthodox Unity* states: Celestial Master Zhang, whose personal name was Daoling, studied the Dao on Mount Heming in Shu. At the time, the people of Shu could not distinguish between humans and ghosts, and disasters and illnesses arose in succession. The Most High Lord Lao descended and bestowed upon him the Orthodox Unity Alliance Rites, enabling him to separate humans and ghosts. He established twenty-four dioceses, and to this day, the people continue to receive his blessings. The Altar of the Ghost Precepts remains extant.

The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Yu Ji was a native of Beihai. He suffered from leprosy for many years, and no medicine could cure him. In the market, he saw an old man selling medicine, surnamed Bo and named He, and went to inform him of his condition. The old man gave him two scrolls of plain script, saying, "This text will not only cure your illness but also grant you longevity." Yu Ji received it and found it to be the *Scripture of Great Peace*. Practicing its teachings, his illness was cured. On the high peak of Diaotai Village in Shangyu, he expounded upon this scripture, completing one hundred and seventy scrolls. To this day, the Taiping Mountain and Gan Stream remain there.

The Nine Cauldrons of Wang Chang, the Seven Trials of Zhao Sheng. The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Wang Chang was an inner disciple of Celestial Master Zhang. The Celestial Master told his disciples, "Your worldly habits remain unrefined; the essentials of the Nine Cauldrons shall be entrusted only to Wang Chang." There was also Zhao Sheng, who sought to become a disciple. The Celestial Master tested him with seven trials, all of which he passed, and thus was allowed to enter the inner chamber. Later, he ascended with Wang Chang to the Great Clarity Heaven.

The Subtle Transformation of Li Shaojun, the Elixir Perfected by Bo Dao. The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Li Shaojun, hearing that Emperor Wu of Han was fond of the Dao, went to see him. He secretly prepared a divine elixir. When the elixir was complete, he said to the emperor, "Your Majesty cannot abandon extravagance, distance yourself from sensual pleasures, cease warfare, or eliminate anger. Wandering souls stretch across ten thousand *li*, and the marketplace and court are stained with spilled blood. The great elixir and divine medicine cannot be perfected under such conditions." He then feigned illness and departed. The emperor regretted not having sought Shaojun more diligently.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: Mao Boda, Lou Daogong, Xie Zhijian, and Zhang Zhaoqi together compounded a divine elixir. When the elixir was complete, Mao took it first and died. Lou took it next and also died. Seeing this, Xie and Zhang abandoned the elixir and left. Turning back, they saw Mao and Lou walking on the mountain. Shocked and grieved, Mao and Lou told them of the *Ashen Ganoderma* method. After consuming it, they all lived for several hundred years but never ascended to heaven.

Gui Jun Tending Horses, Yin Gui Warding Off Weapons. The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Gui Jun was the governor of Xuzhou. He suddenly contracted leprosy, and no physician could cure him. Hearing that Gan Ji had attained the Dao, he led a retinue of several hundred to visit him. Gan Ji said, "If you wish to be cured, you must dismiss all your attendants and remain here to tend horses." Gui Jun resigned his office and tended horses for three years. Without medical treatment, he did not realize his illness had been cured. Gan Ji then transmitted to him the arts of the Dao. At the age of one hundred and ninety, he departed as a transcendent.

Yin Gui, styled Gongdu, regularly consumed *huangjing* blossoms, three *ge* each day. Generations of people witnessed him, calculating his age to be over a thousand years. During the *Yongkang* era of the Jin, he passed through Luoyang and lodged for the night. The next morning, he told his host, "Next year, there will be great warfare, and over half will perish. I give you this pellet of medicine—wear it, and you may escape." The following year, the Rebellion of King Zhao of Zhao indeed erupted, claiming tens of thousands of lives, yet this man alone survived.

Guo Wen Taming Tigers, Lou Feng Startling Bandits.
Guo Wen, styled Wenju, of the Eastern Jin, dwelled in reclusion on Mount Dapi in Yuhang. Once, a tiger came before him, gaping its jaws wide. Wen, knowing it suffered from a bone lodged in its throat, reached in with his hand and removed it.

The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Lou Feng studied under Ji Qiuzi, consuming *shiguiying* and *Zhongyue shihuang*. He lived for three hundred years and excelled in the arts of warding and defense. On the road, he encountered a group of merchants besieged by several hundred bandits. Feng said to the bandits, "Disperse at once, or I shall slay you all." The bandits paid no heed and loosed a volley of arrows at the merchants. Feng then shouted at the arrows, which reversed course and struck the bandits instead. Suddenly, a great wind uprooted trees, sending sand and stones flying as the sky and earth darkened. The bandits all collapsed to the ground, their hands bound behind their backs. They then pleaded for mercy and begged for their lives.

Feng then summoned divine soldiers to release them and departed.

Kong An nurtured his ambition; Fan Li changed his name.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Kong An practiced qi-cultivation and ingested lead cinnabar, living for three hundred years with the complexion of a child. He once told his disciples, "I once served a fisherman by the sea—he was none other than Fan Li, the minister of Yue. Li changed his name many times, and pitying my resolve, he transmitted to me five scrolls of secret formulas, that I might transcend the world."

Li Gen’s pupils were square; Zi Huang’s teeth regrew.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Li Gen, styled Ziyuan, appeared age-less across generations. Wu Taiwen of Shouchun became his disciple and learned the method for making gold and silver. He could also transform his form, enter water and fire, and summon traveling kitchens. Taiwen often spoke of Gen’s pupils being perfectly square. *The Scripture of Transcendents* states: "He lived for eight hundred years."

As for Chen Zihuang, at over seventy years of age, his hair had turned white and his teeth had fallen out. He then followed a formula to consume wood and abstained from grains for three years. His hair turned entirely black, and his teeth regrew. At two hundred and thirty years of age, he departed as a transcendent.

The imperial concubine Lou Jing refined cinnabar with Yan Qing.

Lou Jing was a Gentleman of the Palace during the reign of Emperor Wen of Han. He studied the Dao under Master Zhang and obtained the formula for the mica and cinnabar elixir. After consuming it, he lived to one hundred thirty years of age yet appeared as a man of thirty. He passed the elixir to Wang Gongzi, who at seventy years of age took it and was able to attend to eighty concubines, fathering twenty sons. He could walk three hundred li in a day, drink a *dou* of wine, and lived to two hundred years. Yan Qing was a native of Kuaiji. Poor, he often burned charcoal in the mountains. One day, he suddenly encountered an immortal who said, "Your bones and appearance suit transcendence," and gave him a scroll of plain silk, instructing him to place it in a clean vessel atop a high place. The immortal also taught Qing the method for consuming stalactite. Qing then placed the scroll in a clean vessel atop a high place and soon heard the constant presence of a dozen attendants. Whenever he transported charcoal by boat, these spirits would guide it, so others saw only the boat moving on its own. Later, he abstained from grains and departed for Mount Xiao Huo. He often married, and Zhongfu transformed his form.

Li Changzai was a man of Shu. From youth, he studied the Dao, and people saw him across generations, reckoning he had lived four hundred years without aging. Each time he married, he would leave once a child was born. After departing, thirty years later, he was seen on Mount Difei marrying again. After having a child, seventy years later, he suddenly left once more. People then saw him beneath Mount Hushou, marrying as before and having a child.

Li Zhongfu was a native of Fengyi. He studied under Master Wang, consuming liquid jade, practicing *dun jia*, and mastering the art of concealment. At three hundred years of age, he grew increasingly youthful. His concealments lasted sometimes a hundred days, sometimes a year. When drinking or eating with others, only his voice was heard, his form unseen. An acquaintance five hundred *li* away, who made a living setting nets, one day caught a great crow—only to find it was Zhongfu. After three hundred years among mortals, he departed to become an immortal of the Western Marchmount.

Bo He gazed at walls, and Zhao Qu received divine manifestations. Bo He, styled Zhongli, studied under Master Dong, practicing qi circulation, grain abstention, and consuming water. He also journeyed to Mount Xicheng to study under Master Wang. The master said to him, "The essentials of the Great Dao cannot be swiftly attained."

I shall briefly journey to Yingzhou. You may gaze intently at the stone wall within this chamber—over time, you will perceive writing. When you see it, read it, and you shall attain the Dao.”

Bo He thus fixed his gaze upon the wall. For a year, he saw nothing. In the second year, faint traces of writing appeared. By the third year, he clearly beheld *The Central Scripture of the Great Clarity*, *Divine Elixir Formulas*, *The Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, and *The Five Diagrams*. He committed them to memory.

When Master Wang returned, he said, “You have attained it.” Bo He then compounded the divine elixir, consuming half a dose to extend his years without limit. With the other half, he transmuted five thousand *jin* of gold to relieve the poor and ailing.

Zhao Qu, styled Zirong, contracted leprosy and lay near death. Fearing contagion, his family provided him with provisions and abandoned him in a stone chamber deep in the mountains. Qu wept day and night for over a hundred days when suddenly three figures entered the chamber. He wailed and begged for deliverance, and the divine beings bestowed upon him five *dou* each of pine nuts and pine resin, saying, “Consume these, and not only will your illness be cured, but you shall attain longevity.”

Qu then ingested them, and his ailment vanished. After two years of consumption, his chamber at night was filled with radiance as bright as day. One night, he saw upon his face a beautiful woman, three *cun* in height. By the third year, she had grown to human size and remained always at his side. He heard the sounds of zithers and lutes. After three hundred years, he departed to become an immortal of Mount Huo.

Gan Shi consumed asparagus root, and Huang Jing observed the Red Star.

Gan Shi was skilled in *qi*-circulation and abstained from grain, consuming only asparagus root. He lived in the world for one hundred and eighty-six years before ascending as an immortal to Mount Wangwu.

Huang Jing, styled Boyan, studied the Dao on Mount Huo. He visualized the Red Star within his brain, blazing like fire and circulating throughout his body. After two hundred years, he departed to become an immortal.

Chen Chang performed water rites, and Gong Song composed scriptures. Chen Chang dwelled on Mount Zhuyu for six hundred years. Every season, he conducted sacrifices yet consumed neither food nor drink, nor did he engage in any cultivation. When people fell ill, he gave them the sacrificial water to drink, and all were cured.

Gong Song was a man of great literary talent who composed over two hundred scrolls of Daoist texts. Consuming mica, he attained the Way of earthbound immortality. Later, he entered Mount Zhuyu and ascended as an immortal.

Zhou Taibin played the zither, and Master Fu drilled through stone. As *Zhen Gao* records: Zhou Taibin was a man of talent and artistry, skilled in playing the zither. Once, he taught Mi Changsheng and Sun Guangtian to produce all eight notes from a single string, a truly marvelous feat. Having attained immortality, he now serves as Left Minister in Penglai.

There was once Master Fu, who from youth cherished the Dao. He entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao for seven years, where he encountered the Most Ancient Lord of the Wooden Limit, who bestowed upon him a wooden drill. The Lord instructed him to bore through a slab of stone, five *chi* thick, saying, “Once this stone is pierced, you shall attain the Dao.” Master Fu drilled day and night for forty-seven years, until the stone was fully penetrated. He then obtained the golden elixir and ascended to heaven as the Perfected One of the Southern Marchmount.

Zhuang Bowei visualized Kunlun, and Zhao Guangxin dwelled on Little White Mountain. As *Zhen Gao* records: Zhuang Bowei, from youth devoted to the Dao, would sit facing the northwest at sunset, close his eyes, and visualize Mount Kunlun. After twenty-one years of such practice, consuming herbs and studying the Dao without cease, he persisted for another decade. Then, with eyes closed, he beheld immortals of Kunlun bestowing upon him the formula for the Golden Liquid, and he attained the Dao.

Zhao Guangxin, during the Wei dynasty, resided on Little White Mountain in Ke. Each day, he traveled to Chang’an to sell medicine and heal people, returning to Little White by evening. People remarked, “He departs Little White at dawn and returns to Chang’an by dusk.” As *Dengzhen Yinjue* states: Having received the method of *qi*-absorption and guarded the Way of the Mysterious Center, after seventy-eight years he compounded the Nine-Splendor Elixir and took a single dose. The Great One dispatched a cloud-chariot to welcome him, and he now resides in the Eastern Florescence Palace.

Zhang Xuanbin consumed wood, and Zhao Chengbo mastered the art of whistling. As *Zhen Gao* records: Zhang Xuanbin studied under Master Ju of Xihe and received the formula for consuming wood. Later, he encountered the Perfected One Fan Ziming, who taught him the Way of Transforming and Concealing the Luminous. Once on Mount Tianzhu, he now serves as the Warden of Regulations in the Flowery Court Cavern, overseeing rain and water.

Zhao Chengbo was skilled in whistling, his whistles resembling the cries of a hundred birds, now like wind rushing through forests, now like clouds soaring above, now like dark mists gathering, now like drizzling rain descending. He now resides in a cavern, tending the five sacred fungi, gold, and jade herbs.

Tian Shiwen descended dates, and Wang Qiao flew as a crow. As *Louguan Zhuan* records: Master Tian, styled Shiwen, entered the Dao at nineteen, studying under Master Wei and receiving the scriptures and methods of the Three Caverns. He absorbed *qi* and swallowed mist, while also consuming white wood. On every Gengshen day, he would ascend the mountain bearing incense to pay homage. Once, during a ritual feast, several dates descended from the sky, each two *cun* long and exceptionally sweet. At seventy-five, a carriage of cinnabar clouds descended to welcome him, and he departed to the Blessed Hall of the Southern Palace.

Wang Qiao of the Han was an immortal who concealed his true nature as magistrate of Ye. By night, he attended the immortal courts; by day, he returned to his official duties, unbeknownst to others. One day, clerks in the hall saw a pair of crows fly in. When they struck them with a staff, the crows fell to the ground—only to reveal themselves as Wang Qiao’s sandals.

Huang Ziyang consumed peach bark, and Gao Qiu refined the golden liquid. As *Zhen Yu* records: Huang Ziyang studied the Dao on Mount Fuoluo for over ninety years, consuming only peach bark and drinking the yellow water from within stones. He encountered Sima Jizhu, who transmitted to him an immortal formula, and he attained the Dao.

Gao Qiu studied the Dao on Mount Lujing for five hundred and twenty years, reading only the Yellow Plain Scripture and consuming rice. He compounded the Hong Elixir and attained the Way of earthbound immortality. After two hundred years, he took a single dose of the Golden Liquid and ascended to the Grand Clarity, becoming the Perfected One of the Central Marchmount.

Ken Laizi drank from the Crimson Spring, and the Duke of Luoxia consumed the Vermilion Crow’s Night-Glowing Fungus. As *Shenxian Zhuan* records: Ken Laizi attained immortality by drinking from the Crimson Spring, and the Duke of Luoxia by consuming the Vermilion Crow’s Night-Glowing Fungus.

Zhang Chang consumed asparagus root and ascended as an immortal, while Fei Mengzi took the Four Seasons Powder and likewise attained the Dao.

Xingzi loved dogs, and Mu Yu’s destiny was tied to a child. As *Liexian Zhuan* records: Xingzi was a man of Shu who loved dogs. One day, his dog ran into a mountain cave, and Xingzi followed. After ten days and nights of travel, covering hundreds of *li*, he emerged atop the mountain, where he found terraces, halls, and palaces amidst verdant pines. Immortal officials and guards presented him with a sealed letter, instructing him to deliver it to Magistrate Qiao of Chengdu. When Qiao opened the letter, it contained only fish roe. He raised them in a pond, and after a year, they transformed into dragons. Xingzi continued to follow his dog back and forth for over a hundred years before ascending the mountain and never returning.

Ma Yuanjie summoned spirits, and Hou Kai served his master. As *Louguan Zhuan* records: Master Ma, styled Yuanjie, studied under Master Sun and received the Five Talismans of the Perfected Script and the Great Characters of the Three Sovereigns. He could summon the myriad spirits and command all demonic forces. Whatever he enacted took immediate effect.

Suddenly a celestial deity descended and declared: "Master, you possess accumulated merit and virtue, your name inscribed in the registers of immortality—why trouble yourself with prayers and supplications, commanding the spirits to serve you?" Thereafter, the Master concealed his methods and expounded the teachings, embracing the One and concentrating on the Mysterious. At ninety-eight, a white cloud suddenly arose from the northwest, drifting straight into his chamber. His disciples went to look, but the white cloud had already ascended southward and vanished into the distance, its destination unknown.

Master Hou, styled Faxian, at fourteen studied under Master Chen Baochi and received the true oral instructions. Chen said to him: "With the scriptures and methods girded to your person, you ought to enter the mountains—do not miss the appointed time." Hou replied: "Though entering the mountains may grasp the root of the wondrous, to turn from one’s master is a grave transgression. I wish to serve you to the end." At fifty-two, he at last fulfilled his cultivation, and was moved by a numinous spring that welled forth elixir, and wondrous trees that exhaled mist. At eighty-six, he departed as an immortal.

Mother Master, styled Shixian, at eleven studied the Dao under Master Niu. The worthy and eminent of court and countryside all admired her virtue. Whatever alms she received, she sought out the poor and elderly, secretly leaving it at their homes without revealing her name. In winter, she would chill a plot of land and scatter grain upon it to feed the birds, which gathered in flocks in her courtyard.

Master Chen, styled Baochi, at twenty-one was skilled in the qin and excelled at weiqi. He first studied under Master Wang, then under Master Lu Jingzhen of Huayin, from whom he received the profound and arcane. Each dawn as he performed his devotions, a white tiger would tame itself at his side, following him to and fro. Later, a pack of tigers would strike the trees to warn evildoers, and if a ferocious tiger approached, they would strike the trees as well. The people of the time called it the "Tiger-Testing Tree."

Liang Chen, styled Kaocheng, at seventeen studied the Dao under Master Zheng. He walked with his gaze fixed upon the ground, fearing to harm any being that bore qi. If birds or beasts blocked his path, he would step off the road to avoid them. At seventy-seven, he suddenly saw clouds suffuse the forest, and he refined his body to ascend into the clouds and depart.

Sun Che, styled Zhongxuan, at eighteen studied under Master Wang. Sometimes he lodged in hollow trees, sometimes in secluded chambers. He wove kudzu into a mat, and when questioned, he would merely observe the questioner’s countenance to know their fortune, without further speech. At seventy, he suddenly told his disciples: "I must depart for a time." He brushed his robes and went out, and none knew his whereabouts. His fellow Daoists, missing him, took his kudzu mat and placed it in a quiet chamber, where they often heard voices speaking beside it. When friends heard of this, they divided the mat among themselves.

Master Wang, styled Daoyi, concentrated his spirit beyond the white clouds and fixed his mind beneath the cinnabar pillar. He restored the temple halls and reopened the gates of the Mysterious, and through the sincerity of his devotion, he evoked many responses from the grotto-heavens. Once, celestial beings descended in compassion, and his granaries and storehouses filled of their own accord—no matter how much was taken, they remained full, never depleted. He constantly distributed alms, furthering meritorious works, and the poor and sick from far and near all received his beneficence and grace.

At sixty-three, one day a white deer suddenly entered his courtyard, now hidden, now visible, and thus he shed his mortal form.

Yin Tong, styled Lingjian, at twenty-six became a disciple of Master Ma to receive the Dao. He consumed yellow essence, asparagus root, and ingested realgar pills. Thereafter, scholars and officials admired his supreme virtue, carriages and horses thronged his gates, and both Daoists and layfolk bowed to his pure influence—officials and gentry vied to pay their respects. Those who bore gratitude toward him all offered him lavish gifts, yet Tong used everything to cultivate various meritorious works, broadly relieving hunger and cold, accumulating nothing for himself. At one hundred and one, he transformed into a transcendent, and divine lamps often illuminated his chamber.

Penglai’s Mistress Ni, Taibai’s Master Qi.

*The Transmission of Daoist Learning* states: Mistress Chen Ni was a transcendent of Penglai. She ingested magnetite, silver essence, and *qianqiu’er*. She had twelve disciples, all of whom obtained her methods and ascended as immortals.

*The Transmission of Louguan* records: Master Qi, named Hui, styled Pingding. When the Tang founder first took the realm, the Master and eighty Daoists rendered aid to the state, and were granted the rank of Grand Master for Assisting the State with Gold and Purple, while those below received Silver and Blue. Later, when he performed a grand offering for the nation, a yellow cloud descended to cover the altar, merging with the rising incense smoke. Two white deer cried out and departed. He then said to his disciples: “The immortal scriptures say: ‘Those who would be immortal guests enter Taibai.’” Thereupon he ascended Mount Taibai with his disciples, harboring lofty aspirations amid clouds and mist.

*Compendium of the Immortal Garden* (Middle Scroll) concludes.

How wondrous was Boshan, and his niece besides!
*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Boshanfu entered Mount Hua to refine his spirit and consume elixirs, never aging. When he returned to his hometown, he saw his niece aged and ailing, and gave her medicine. After taking it, the seventy-year-old woman reverted to youth, her complexion like peach blossoms. A Han envoy once saw a woman flogging an old man, who knelt to receive the blows. The envoy, astonished, asked the reason. She replied: “This is my son. Long ago, my uncle Boshanfu gave him medicine, but he refused to take it. Now he is old, and cannot walk as well as I, so I punish him.” When asked their ages, she said: “I am one hundred and forty, and my son is eighty-seven.”

Liu Gang’s fire burned, Lady Fan’s rain ceased.
Liu Gang was the magistrate of Shangyu County. He and his wife, Lady Fan, both attained the Dao’s unfolding. Once, as they sat together on a bed, Gang conjured fire to burn the house from the east, while Lady Fan summoned rain from the west, extinguishing the flames.

The Holy Mother of Dongling escaped prison; Kong Yuan approached water.
The Holy Mother of Dongling was the wife of a man surnamed Du. She studied under Liu Gang and Wei, mastering the art of vanishing while seated or standing. Her husband, disbelieving, falsely accused her of adultery and reported her to the authorities, who imprisoned her. The Holy Mother entered the cell, then flew out through the window, ascending into the clouds and departing.

Kong Yuan regularly consumed pine resin, fuling, and pine nuts, growing ever more youthful and vigorous, though he had already lived over one hundred and seventy years. When others drank wine, they would ask Yuan to compose drinking games. He would plant his staff in the ground, stand upside down with his head downward, and drink wine in that posture—none could match him. He then dug a cave by the water’s edge, a little over a *zhang* square, and dwelled within, abstaining from grains. Sometimes he emerged after a month, sometimes two. Later, he entered the Western Marchmount and attained the Dao.

She Zheng’s piercing gaze, Wang Lie’s stone marrow.
She Zheng, styled Xuanzhen, was a native of Badong. He spoke of events from the First Emperor of Qin’s time as if they were before his eyes. He often kept his eyes closed, even when walking, and for decades none of his disciples ever saw him open them.

A disciple once insistently begged him to open his eyes, and Zheng complied. With a sound like thunderclaps and a radiance like lightning, all his disciples prostrated themselves upon the ground. Li Babai called him "a mere child of four hundred years."

Wang Lie, styled Changxiu, was a native of Dengye. He regularly consumed yellow essence and refined lead. Though two hundred and thirty-eight years old, he retained a youthful appearance. He could ascend mountains as swiftly as if flying. In his youth, he had been a scholar and associated with Ji Shuye. Once, Lie entered the Taihang Mountains and heard a sound like the splitting of the earth. Going to investigate, he saw that a section of the mountain, several hundred *zhang* in length, had fractured, revealing a flow of blue-green mud resembling marrow. He gathered some, kneaded it, and in an instant, it solidified into stone, resembling hot wax. When tasted, its flavor was like that of polished rice. The *Scripture of Immortals* states: "Divine mountains open once every five hundred years, revealing marrow within. Those who consume it will endure as long as heaven and earth."

Jiao Xian offered firewood, Sun Deng dwelled in caves.
Jiao Xian, styled Xiaoran, was a native of Hedong. He often consumed white stone, which he divided among others, cooked until soft like taro. Each day, he would gather firewood to distribute to people. Even in winter, he wore only a single garment.

A fire once burned his hut, yet he sat unmoving. When the flames passed and the hut was consumed, his clothes remained unscorched. In heavy snow, when many roofs collapsed, people went to check on him but found no hut—only when they cleared the snow did they discover it beneath, its warmth lingering like a steaming vessel. Whether appearing old or young, he remained thus for two hundred years before bidding farewell, vanishing without a trace.

Sun Deng dwelled in the mountains, making his home in an earthen cave. He loved to play the zither and study the *Book of Changes*. Winter and summer alike, he wore only a single garment. In bitter cold, he covered himself with his own hair, which grew over a *zhang* in length. Sometimes he begged for coins in the marketplace, only to give them to the poor. He remarked of Ji Shuye that his talent surpassed all others, yet his wisdom fell short of preserving himself. At times, he would pluck a single-stringed zither to produce melodies, though none knew when he would cease.

Ge You ascended Mount Sui, while Wang Zhen and the Lady of Mount Nüji attained transcendence. According to the *Biographies of Immortals*, Ge You was a Qiang tribesman who, during the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, carved wooden sheep to sell. One day, he rode a sheep into Shu, ascending Mount Sui, where kings, marquises, and nobles followed him and never returned, all ascending as immortals. The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* records that Wang Zhen of Shangdang, at seventy-nine, had studied the Dao for thirty years. Though aged, his complexion remained youthful and fair, and he could walk at a leisurely pace to overtake a galloping horse. When Emperor Wu of Wei met him, he appeared no older than thirty. He taught the method of steaming cinnabar to You Yuanjie. The villagers reckoned Wang to be over four hundred years old when he took three young concubines and ascended Mount Nüji.

Yue Ba brought wine to Ba, while Shi Jin bestowed gold upon the Yinshi clan. According to the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*, Yue Ba was a native of Shu. The prefect invited him to serve as an aide, treating him as a teacher. When asked to demonstrate his arts, Yue sat calmly and entered a wall, emerging outside. He then called for a tiger, which returned as Yue himself. Later, he was appointed governor of Yuzhang. There, a temple spirit could converse with people. Upon arrival, Yue overthrew the altar and questioned the spirit’s origins, learning it had fled to Qi to live as a scholar. The governor gave his daughter in marriage, and she bore a son. Yue traveled to Qi, inscribed a talisman, and the spirit transformed into a wildcat. Later, Yue was summoned to serve as a minister. At the New Year’s court banquet, as the officials drank, Yue took a mouthful of wine, rose, and sighed toward the southwest. He memorialized: "A fire has broken out in the marketplace of my hometown, Chengdu, so I have summoned rain to extinguish it." The emperor dispatched messengers to investigate, confirming that a fire had indeed started on New Year’s Day, and by mealtime, rain had come from the northeast to quench the flames—its scent like that of wine.

Yin Changsheng, a native of Xinye, heard that Ma Mingsheng possessed the Dao and became his disciple. For over a decade, he served as a humble attendant before being led into the Green Heaven Mountain, where he was shown the Great Clarity Elixir. After the medicine was completed, he consumed half a dose and endured as long as heaven and earth.

Yin then used half a dose to boil yellow earth, transmuting it into several thousand catties of yellow gold, which he distributed to the impoverished and ailing throughout the land. He dwelt among people for one hundred and seventy years, his complexion like that of a maiden. He composed nine scrolls on the elixir scriptures, and at last ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Zi Xun rode a blue mule; Qin Gao, a crimson carp.
Ju Zixun, a native of Qi, was a man whose Way none could fathom. He always yielded to others with sincerity and humility. For over two hundred years, he did not age. When a scholar from his hometown journeyed to the capital, the nobles of the court all wished to meet Zixun, and he agreed to each. Though they lived a thousand *li* from the capital, he arrived at all twenty-three households at once, his words identical to each. The nobles sought to detain him, but Zixun mounted his blue mule and rode beyond the outskirts. Even when pursued by galloping horses, he remained half a *li* ahead.

*The Accounts of Immortals* states: Qin Gao, a man of Zhao, was skilled in playing the zither and served as a retainer to King Kang of Song. Practicing the Way of Jue and Peng, after two hundred years, he arranged to meet his disciples in the waters of Zhuo Commandery, then ascended as an immortal upon a crimson carp.

Master Pot sold medicines; Changfang roamed the market.
*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Master Pot—his name unknown—was seen by Fei Changfang of Runan as he sold medicines in the marketplace. His remedies had no fixed price, yet cured all ailments. He amassed tens of thousands in coin, which he gave away to the poor and freezing. He always hung an empty pot before his seat, and after the sun set, he would leap into it. No one else could see this, but Changfang, watching from an upper story, knew he was no ordinary man. Thus, day after day, Changfang swept the floor, arranged the mats, bowed twice, and presented food. The Master accepted it without thanks. Over time, Changfang never wavered in his devotion.

One day, he suddenly said to Changfang, "Come again at dusk." Changfang followed his instruction and returned. The Master said to him, "When you see me leap into the pot, follow me in." Changfang entered the pot and saw towers and pavilions of five colors, layered gates, the sun and moon shining brightly, and many attendants. The Master said, "I am an immortal. You are teachable, so I have shown myself to you." After Changfang served him through three trials, the Master said, "You cannot attain the immortal Dao; I will make you a master instead." He gave Changfang a bamboo staff and sent him home, flying through the air. Upon reaching home, Changfang cast the staff into Ge Marsh. From then on, he could dispel evil spirits and save people from floods and droughts—nothing was beyond his power.

Dong Feng revived Shi Xie; Liu Gen saw ghosts.
Dong Feng, styled Junyi, was a native of Houguan County. At the time, Shi Xie, the Inspector of Jiaozhou, had been dead for three days. Feng arrived in the southern regions and placed three medicinal pills into Xie’s mouth. After the time it takes to eat a meal, Xie revived, and within half a day, he could sit up. He said that when he died, it was like a dream: dozens of black-clad men took him through a great pearl gate and delivered him to a prison. They entered a chamber, sealed it with earth from the outside, and he saw no light. Suddenly, he heard voices saying, "The Messenger of the Great One summons Shi Xie." Then he heard the sound of digging, was pulled out, placed in a carriage, and awoke. Feng stayed for a year before feigning illness and death. Later, he went to Mount Lu and planted tens of thousands of apricot trees. After a hundred years among people, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Liu Gen, styled Jun’an, was a native of Jingzhao. In his youth, he studied the Dao and entered a stone chamber on Mount Song. In winter, he wore no clothes, and green fur grew on his body, one or two feet long. Later, when Gao, the Grand Administrator of Yingchuan, took office, a great plague struck the people, killing more than half. He sent an envoy to beg for relief from the epidemic. Gen instructed him to bury cinnabar at the site where the Year Star had vented its qi. The plague immediately subsided. Later, when Prefect Zhang arrived, he regarded Gen as a sorcerer and sent for him, intending to humiliate him. He asked Gen, "If you possess the Dao, can you make me see ghosts?" Gen replied, "I can." He requested a brush, inkstone, and a writing board, inscribed a talisman, and struck it before the desk. With a resonant sound, suddenly hundreds of voices cried out to clear the way, and a cangue-cart was brought to the hall—it was the prefect’s parents. They reproached him, saying, "You should not have offended the divine immortals, causing us such suffering and shame." The prefect kowtowed and apologized, and in an instant, they vanished. Later, Gen dwelled at Mao Gong’s Altar on Dongting Mountain, his body covered in green fur.

Song Lun mastered the Six Jia; Du Chong ascended the Nine Flowers.
*The Biographies of the Louguan Masters* records: Song Lun, styled Dexuan, began studying the Dao at the age of twenty-two during the reign of King Li of Zhou. He recited the *Five Thousand Character Text*, consumed yellow essence and white wood, and after twenty years, the Lord Lao descended to bestow upon him the *Numinous Flight of the Six Jia* and the *White Memorial of the Cinnabar Talismans*. Lun’s practice brought divine responses, and his words were never unfulfilled. He could stride across cliffs and walk three thousand *li* in a day, cross waves and traverse ridges without relying on ferries or paths. At over ninety years of age, he ascended as an immortal during the reign of King Jing and was appointed to oversee Mount Song.

Du Chong, styled Xuanyi, began studying the Dao and refining truth at the age of twenty-five, cultivating stillness and guarding the One. After more than twenty years, the Perfected One Zhan descended to bestow upon him the *Nine-Flower Elixir Formula*, saying, "The Lord Lao and the Perfected One Yin summoned the Supreme Emperor to assemble the host of immortals on the Eight Halts Mountain in the Eastern Sea. The Earth Bureau has reported your diligence, so I hasten to transmit this immortal formula to you." Chong consumed the elixir, and his body radiated jade-like light. At the age of one hundred and twenty during the reign of King Mu of Zhou, he was appointed as the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate.

The Daoist adept Wang Daolian cherished the *Pattra Leaf*; Yao Tan’s silver flowers bloomed.
*The Biographies of Daoist Scholars* records: The female immortal Wang Daolian, at the age of seven, understood the Dao. She bought fragrant oil for offerings, ate only plain vegetables, and wore no silk or brocade. She received the Three Caverns scriptures and recited them day and night. Initially, she entered Dragon Mountain to construct a temple hall, naming it *Mystic Radiance*, where three altars appeared as if by divine power. Suddenly, a tree grew in the southeast, its form like an overturned basket, shading one altar with its canopy. Its five leaves grew in pairs. No one recognized it, so they called it the *Pattra Leaf*. Later, a jade casket descended upon the altar, glowing with light. After she had recited ten thousand scriptures, a cloud chariot arrived to welcome her, accompanied by swift thunder and fierce winds, filling the air with fragrance.

*The Biographies of the Louguan Masters* records: Yao Tan, styled Yuantai, was a native of Pingyang. At the age of nineteen, he began studying the Dao in the first year of King Ping’s reign, expounding the *Five Thousand Character Text*. When a violent wind split a mountain, opening a great chasm, he remained utterly unafraid. He refined and consumed pine resin, and a divine person bestowed upon him the *Mysterious and White Way of Returning to Form* and the *Heavenly Pass Three Charts of Flying Transcendence*. After practicing these, his eyes emitted divine light, flashing like lightning.

At the age of two hundred and ten, during the fifth month of King Jian’s reign, amid wind, rain, and darkening skies, with thunder and lightning clashing fiercely, the heavens rained silver blossoms, scattering in profusion upon the earth. He received the scriptures and was named Perfected of the Dark Continent.

Lu Shang’s earth marrow, Wang Zhu’s divine cinnabar.
*The Biographies of the Immortals* records: Lu Shang fled the chaos of King Zhou’s reign, concealing himself in Liaodong. Later, he journeyed to Zhou and fished at Fan Stream. He regularly consumed marsh orchids and earth marrow. At the age of two hundred, he announced his death, yet when buried, no corpse was found—only six scrolls of *Jade Chimes* remained. Wang Zhu, together with a Daoist, ascended Rock Mountain, where clouds revealed an abundance of cinnabar, enough to yield tens of thousands of pounds. The local magistrate, learning of this, sealed the site, but the cinnabar flew out like fire, so he permitted its collection. Wang and the county prefect Zhang Junming ingested the cinnabar for three years, obtaining divine cinnabar like flying snow. After consuming it for five years, they ascended in flight, becoming immortals together.

The Mirror-Bearer ground lenses; Fu Wen carried melons.
*The Biographies of the Immortals* records: The Master of the Burdened Case was often seen carrying a mirror-grinding case through the markets of Wu. For a single coin, he would polish a mirror. He would also ask the householders if they suffered from illness, then offer them purple medicinal pills, which invariably cured them. Over the years, he saved tens of thousands of lives without accepting a single coin in return. People then knew him to be an immortal. Later, he ascended to the summit of Wu Mountain, where he suspended medicine from a sheer cliff to give to others. He declared, “I return to Penglai Mountain, and for your sake, I shall send down divine water.” One day, water flowed down from the cliff’s edge, and those who drank it were often cured. Fu Wen, who often stayed in Ju, would wander by the sea. There, he encountered three immortals playing a game with melons and was made to carry dozens of yellow and white melons. They instructed him to close his eyes, and after a long moment, he found himself on Mount Fangzhang, south of Penglai. Upon returning to Ju, he frequently journeyed to retrieve treasures—pearls and jade—from Mount Fangzhang to sell, though none knew how he traveled there.

Zhu Ying gathered birds; Xuan Su subdued serpents.
Zhu Chun’gong, a native of Luo, dwelled at the foot of the northern mountain in Shixiang. He raised sparrow hawks for over a hundred years, each with its own name, numbering over a thousand. At dusk, they roosted; by day, they flew free, returning at his call. He sold the hawks and their young, amassing a fortune of ten million coins, which he left behind as he departed. Later, he ascended Wu Mountain, where hundreds of white cranes and peacocks often alighted beside him. Xuan Su claimed to be a native of Hejian. He regularly consumed quartz and sold medicine in the marketplace, offering seven pills for a single coin, which cured all manner of illnesses. When the King of Hejian suffered from an abscess, Xuan Su’s medicine expelled over ten serpents, and the king recovered. Some said Su cast no shadow. The king ordered him to stand in the sunlight, and indeed, no shadow appeared. The king then gave him his daughter in marriage, but in the middle of the night, he vanished, and none knew where he had gone.

Lu Tong planted kernels; Wen Bin cultivated chrysanthemums.
Lu Tong was none other than Jie Yu, the madman of Chu. He delighted in nurturing his nature, eating peach kernels, and wandering among famous mountains. On Mount Emei in Shu, he was seen across generations. Hundreds of years passed, yet no one knew his end. Wen Bin was a native of Taiqiu Village. He made his living selling shoes. He would often marry a wife, only to abandon her after a decade or so. Later, he encountered an old woman over ninety years of age, who told him of her plight. Wen then taught her to consume chrysanthemum blossoms, *difuzi*, mistletoe, and pine nuts. After taking these, the old woman regained her youth and vigor.

Ziyang ascended mountains; Qingling encountered the Dao.

He attained the Dao, received the scriptures, and was named Perfected Ziyang, ranking among the Highest Clarity. *The Biography of Perfected Qingling, Lord Pei* states: Lord Pei, styled Xuanren, at the age of twelve, met the Daoist Zhi Ziyuan, who transmitted to him five true oral instructions. After practicing them for five years, he beheld the essence of the sun and moon, and the five planets descended into his chamber. He received the scriptures and was named Perfected Qingling, ranking among the Highest Clarity.

Dao Yu received poetry; Yang Jun obtained jujubes.
*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Yang Quan, styled Daoyu, was visited by the female immortal E Lühua, who bestowed upon him several poems, along with a fire-washed cloth handkerchief and gold and jade armlets. She revealed that she was Luo Yu of the Nine Doubts Mountain, who, due to transgressions in a past life, had been banished to the mortal realm for nine hundred years. Yang Jun, whose given name was Xi, served as a clerk in the residence of Emperor Jianwen of Jin. He resigned his post to study the Dao on Mount Mao. There, the Lady of Purple Tenuity, the Ninth Consort An of the Nine Flowers, descended and presented him with poems and a single jujube. In the twelfth year of the Taiyuan era, he rode clouds and mounted a dragon, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. He received the scriptures and was named Attendant to the Lord of the Eastern Dawn, Chief Minister of the Eastern Flower, and Controller of the Divine People of Wu and Yue.

Jiao Kuang’s azure birds; Yu Zhang’s white crow.
*The Biographies of the Louguan Masters* records: Jiao Kuang, styled Dadu, a Daoist of Song Mountain, was revered by Emperor Wu of Zhou, who appointed him Imperial Preceptor. When constructing a palace at Huayin, earth surged forth from the cliffs, and only when he set foot upon it did it cease. He stored oil in a stone vat, and though it was exhausted, it would refill of its own accord. Whenever outsiders came to visit, two azure birds would arrive to announce their presence. Mountain spirits guarded the site, and fierce beasts stood sentinel at the gates. Master Yu, named Zhang and styled Changwen, at the age of seven, read the *Dao De Jing*. At eleven, he became a disciple of Master Hou, left the household life, and received the scriptures and methods of the Three Caverns. He transcribed by hand 136 secret celestial talismans and could foretell fortune and misfortune. At the age of eighty-two, he shed his mortal form. As he entered meditation, a single white crow soared into the sky and vanished.

Ling Shou’s youth; Dongguo’s radiance.
*The Biographies of the Divine Immortals* records: Ling Shouguang, a native of Fufeng, at the age of seventy obtained the recipe for Zhu Ying pills. After compounding and consuming them, he grew ever more youthful, appearing as a man of twenty. By the first year of the Jian’an era, he had already lived two hundred and twenty years. Dongguo Yannian, a native of Shanyang, consumed the *Lingfei Powder* and could write by night.

In dark chambers, his body radiated light, illuminating all around. He could discern minute objects dozens of *li* away, perceiving their forms. In his hometown, he remained ageless for over four hundred years. One day, dozens of men riding tigers and leopards arrived to welcome him, and he ascended to Kunlun.

Li Yi’s thousand-*li* strides; Wang Xing’s vigorous journey.
Li Yiqī, a native of Shu, possessed a talisman for those who wished to travel great distances swiftly. He would inscribe the talisman and write upon the traveler’s armpits, enabling them to return within a day from a journey of a thousand or ten thousand *li*. Wang Xing, a native of Yangcheng, was neither literate nor had he studied the Dao. When Emperor Wu of Han ascended Mount Songgao, he saw a man over twenty feet tall, his earlobes reaching his shoulders. The emperor questioned him, and the man replied: “I am from Jiuyi. I heard that on the Central Peak grows *changpu* of nine nodes per inch, which grants longevity, so I came to gather it.” Suddenly, he vanished. The emperor and his ministers all consumed it but could not sustain its effects for long.

Only Wang Xing, upon hearing of it, consumed it without fail. By the time of Emperor Wu of Wei, he still lived, appearing as a man of fifty or so, vigorous in his travels, covering three hundred *li* in a day. He knew no other Dao.

**True Descent of Shunxing, Cloud-Born Joy of Fayue**
According to *The Transmission of Louguan*: Master Li, styled Shunxing, was a native of Jingzhao. At nine, he awakened to the Dao and studied its essentials under Master Chen. Having received the true instructions, he reverently carried the scriptures into the Taiping Valley of Mount Zhongnan to cultivate his practice. Suddenly, a cloud-chariot with feathered canopies descended from the sky, and three great immortals bestowed upon him the *Scripture of Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance* and the *Seven Transformations Conjoining Heaven*. Through his practice, he attained the Dao at seventeen and ascended as an immortal at thirty-eight.

Master Zhang, styled Fayue, was a native of Nanyang. In his youth, he became a disciple of Master Yin the Dharma Master, receiving all the sacred texts and treasured instructions. On the night of his transmission, he was blessed with the auspicious signs of divine lamps and propitious clouds. From then on, he devoted himself to meditation for over thirty years. As clouds arose like beams and pillars, his abode became known as the Cloud-Dwelling Abbey.

**Feigning Death: Dong Zhong; Returning Home: Qian Ping**

Later, he left his body as an empty husk, and after a hundred years, returned to his hometown.

**Zhongdu’s Heat Resistance; Cheng’s Wife’s Silk Manifestation**

Wang Zhongdu was a native of Hanzhong. Emperor Yuan of Han once exposed him to scorching heat, surrounding him with over ten braziers, yet he felt no warmth nor sweat. In the depths of winter, he was made to wear only a single layer of clothing, yet showed no sign of cold, his body steaming like a steamer. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Cheng Wei’s wife possessed the ability to commune with spirits and transform things. When Wei was to accompany the imperial procession but lacked proper attire, he grew deeply anxious. His wife then produced two bolts of silk, which descended from the sky before him. Wei was fond of alchemical practices but had failed for years to succeed. His wife took a small amount of powder from her pouch, cast it into the crucible, and in the time it takes to eat a meal, the mercury turned to silver.

Feng Junda, a native of Longxi, ingested yellow essence and refined mercury-silver. After a hundred years, he returned to his hometown appearing no older than thirty.

According to the *Records of Louguan Abbey*, Master Yan, styled Datong, was a native of Fufeng. He studied under Master Hou and, at twelve, could recite ten thousand words a day. By twenty, he had mastered the scriptures and precepts. During the early Kaihuang era of the Sui, the abbey was extensively renovated, and the number of ordained Daoists was set at one hundred and twenty. On the seventh day of the third month in the fifth year of Daye, as he sat listening to the zither, he remarked, “The melody enters the spirit—divine beings descend. Play another piece.” Before the piece ended, he suddenly shed his mortal form. He was ninety-five years old.

Guo the Master, styled Guozhen, was a native of Wugong. At thirty, he abandoned his household to enter the Dao, studying under Master You and receiving the essential teachings in full. Thereafter, he subsisted solely on vegetables, dwelling in seclusion with a rope for a belt, indifferent to hunger or cold. He constantly recited scriptures, his mind fixed unwaveringly on the One. At sixty, as his disciples stood by, they suddenly heard the sound of carriages and horses, though no figures appeared. The house shook violently, and he shed his mortal form in an instant.

**Zhang Hao’s Cloud-Crane; Yin Cheng’s Apes and Deer**
Zhang Hao, styled Wenming, was a native of Runan. At twenty, he entered the Dao in the second year of *Yongchu* during the reign of Emperor An of Han. He encountered the Perfected One Feng Heng, who tested him thrice—each time he passed—and was thus transmitted the *Green Waist Purple Writ* along with half a tael of divine elixir. He entered Mount Chicheng and diligently cultivated the true Dao. Upon attaining perfection, he sometimes transformed into a white crane, soaring through the sky, or into drifting clouds, roaming beyond the eight directions. At one hundred and thirty-eight, in the first year of *Taihe* during the reign of Emperor Ming of Wei, celestial officials descended to welcome him, and he was invested as a High Perfected of the Grand Clarity.

Yin Cheng, styled Chumo, was a native of Fenyin. At twenty-eight, he lit incense and lamps daily, arranging them in silent rows upon the altar. One day, the incense burned out, yet fragrant mist arose of its own accord; the oil was spent, yet a dark radiance illuminated all. Once, entering the mountains, he encountered a deer with an injured foot and compounded medicine to bind its wound. Later, he entered the mountains again and was caught in prolonged rain, his food exhausted. Suddenly, a herd of deer gathered around him—when hungry, he suckled their milk; when cold, they shielded his body with their own. After many days, he returned. Another time, entering the mountains, he passed through a wildfire where flames filled the valley, leaving no path of escape. A troop of apes descended, linking arms to carry him to the mountain’s summit. Again, he entered the mountains and found a luminous stone fungus, of which he consumed a square inch. Thereafter, he could travel six or seven hundred *li* in a day. Once more, he entered the mountains and met the immortal Song Jun, who transmitted to him the *Writ of the Three Sovereigns* and the *Nine Elixir Formulae*. At three hundred and forty, during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han, celestial officials descended to welcome him, and he was invested as a Perfected of the Grand Clarity.

**Ji Qiu’s Admonition; Emperor Wu’s Return to the Palace**
According to the *Biographies of Immortals*, Lord Ji Qiu was a Daoist of Mount Tai. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he was rewarded for his Daoist arts, which could restore white hair to black and regrow fallen teeth. After returning to his hometown, he encountered Emperor Wu on his eastern progress to Mount Tai. Lord Ji Qiu, wearing a *zhangfu* cap and carrying a zither, went forth to greet the emperor and admonished him, saying, “Do not ascend the mountain—if you do, you will injure your foot.” The emperor did not heed him and, indeed, injured his toe before turning back.

**Deerskin’s Cliffside Pavilion; Hook-Wing’s Empty Coffin**
Deerskin the Elder, in his youth, served as a minor clerk and carpenter in the prefectural office, able to craft implements with a wave of his hand. Atop Mount Cen lay a divine spring, inaccessible to all. He petitioned the prefect, requesting thirty carpenters and axes to construct a revolving wheel, suspending pavilions and ladders along four paths. Thus, he dwelled at the summit, consuming fungi and drinking from the divine spring. Later, when the Mushui River flooded, the people were spared. Lady Hook-Wing was a native of Qi, surnamed Zhao, her right hand perpetually clenched. Emperor Wu of Han took her in, and her hand unfurled, revealing a jade hook. She bore Emperor Zhao. Later, Emperor Wu had her killed. When Emperor Zhao reburied her, the coffin was empty, save for a single shoe.

**Gu Chun’s Revival; Shan Tu’s Vanished Traces**
Gu Chun was a native of Liyang. During the reign of Emperor Cheng, he served as a Gentleman of the Palace but feigned illness and died. His corpse remained warm, so his family dared not seal the coffin. Three years later, he suddenly reappeared, donning his cap and robe, and sat upon the gate tower of the county seat. The townspeople were astonished. When the coffin was opened, only his clothes remained—no corpse was found. He lingered at the gate for three days before departing.

Xiuyang Gong was a native of Wei. He dwelled in a stone chamber on Huashan, his footprints pressed into the rock. Though the stone wore away, he ate nothing, occasionally consuming *huangjing* (Polygonatum). He sought an audience with Emperor Jing to impart the Dao, and the emperor received him with courtesy for several years, yet the Dao remained unattainable. When asked when he would depart, he had not finished speaking when he transformed into a white stone sheep upon the bed. An inscription on its side read: *Xiuyang Gong*. It was placed on Tongling Terrace, then vanished without a trace.

**Red-Beard’s Foresight; Cui Wen’s Plague Relief**
Red-Beard was a native of Feng. He was seen by generations of people. He often foretold disasters, floods, and droughts within Feng’s borders, missing not one in ten.

Later, he went to the foot of Wushan and disappeared.

Cui Ziwen was a native of Taishan. Fond of the Dao, he sold medicine in the marketplace. Three hundred years later, a plague struck, and tens of thousands perished.

Later, he went to Shu and sold yellow medicine as before.

**Divine Fish Ziying; Silkworm Lord Yuanke**
Ziying was a native of Shuxiang. Skilled at diving to catch fish, he once obtained a red carp. Admiring its strangeness, he took it home and placed it in his pond, feeding it when hungry.

A great rain fell, and Ziying mounted the fish’s back, ascending into the sky.

Yuanke was a native of Jiyin. He often cultivated five-colored fragrant herbs, eating their fruit for over a decade. One day, a five-colored moth alighted on the herbs. Yuanke spread cloth beneath it, and silkworms hatched. When the time came to raise them, a woman appeared at night, calling herself Yuanke’s wife. Together, they tended the silkworms, yielding one hundred and twenty cocoons, each as large as a goose egg. Unwinding one cocoon took sixty days. When finished, they departed together, and none knew their whereabouts. Thus, the people of Jiyin worshipped them in every silkworm season.

**Lou Qing’s Cloud-Lifting; Wei Yi’s Dragon-Leaping**

*The Record of Marvels* states:

Lou Shanqing often sold red and white medicines, never naming their price, yet all who were ill were cured. The gold and silk he received, he distributed to the orphaned and impoverished. During the Wude era, in a marketplace of western Shu, clouds arose beneath his feet, and he ascended lightly in broad daylight. Wei Shanchang likewise sold medicines that healed the sick among the people. He was always accompanied by a black dog. During the Ruyi era of Empress Wu Zetian, he passed by Shaolin Temple on Mount Song, where he requested a vegetarian meal for his dog. The monks grew angry, but Shanchang merely took a mouthful of water, sighed once, and the dog transformed into a black dragon, upon which he ascended to heaven. The body soared through the mysteries of the Dao, the Way merging with the shedding of the shell.

The female Perfected, Bian Dongxuan, at eighty years of age, suddenly one morning saw her white hair turn black again and her fallen teeth regrow. In the twenty-seventh year of the Kaiyuan era, at the Purple Cloud Palace in Jizhou, she mounted a colored cloud and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Lou Daohe underwent liberation by means of the corpse in the Taiyi Palace of Bingzhou, his skull splitting open behind, his body like the sloughed husk of a cicada.

Master Ye journeyed to the Lunar Palace, while Elder Guo returned to the Northern Marchmount. Master Ye, the Celestial Master, named Fashan and styled Taisu, guided Emperor Xuanzong of Tang on a tour of the Lunar Palace. Jia Song composed a rhapsody on the event. Zhang Guolao, summoned from Tanzhou in the spring of the twenty-second year of the Kaiyuan era, was bestowed the title Master of Penetrating the Mysteries and appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Cyan. In autumn, he requested leave to return to Tanzhou, where he was granted robes and various silks before being released to return to the Northern Marchmount. His divine transformations and marvelous changes are too numerous to recount in full.

The Yellow River appeared green nine times before his eyes, and he could drink several *hu* of wine without ever growing drunk.

Chongji burned incense in seclusion, while Daohua stole the elixir.

Xie Chongji was a Daoist of Mount Hua, whose heart delighted in burning incense. He increased his censers to three hundred, never ceasing day or night. When incense was lacking, he often used pine nuts as a substitute. In the third year of the Kaiping era of Liang, on a clear morning in the second month, two azure lads descended upon purple clouds to welcome him, announcing that the Supreme Emperor had summoned Xie Chongji. Thereupon, he ascended upon the clouds and departed.

Hou Daohua was a Daoist of Daojing Abbey on Mount Zhongtiao, who took the Heavenly Master Deng as his teacher. When the Heavenly Master’s elixir was completed but he hesitated to consume it, Daohua secretly took and ingested it. In the fifth year of the Dazhong era, on the fifth day of the fifth month, he ascended to immortality, as fully recorded in *The Tang Records*.

Kejiao boarded the boat, while Guizhen painted magpies.

Wang Kejiao was a native of Huating County. His eyes emitted a divine radiance, allowing him to walk at night as if it were day. He then cauterized the small hollow behind his brow, and the light vanished. In the tenth year of the Xiantong era, on the first day of the eleventh month, he went out with his neighbors and happened upon the grass market by the river, where he saw a skiff. A lad called out, “Uncle Wang the Fifth is wanted.” He descended into the boat and saw two or three Daoists playing chess, who remarked, “What a pity—such a body fit for immortality, ruined by cautery.” They gave him a chestnut, and after eating half, he found its taste like that of a jujube. They said, “Go ashore now. We shall meet again in ten years.” The moment his foot touched the bank, he found himself before the Waterfall Temple at the foot of Mount Tiantai. When he inquired about the date, it was already the twenty-seventh day of the eleventh month.

Li Guizhen was a native of Tiantai County. Fond of wine, he wore only unlined garments in both winter and summer. Skilled in ink painting, he would paint magpies wherever he saw walls. At the time, people did not realize he had attained the Dao.

In the eleventh month of the third year of Tianyou, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight at Mount Zhongtiao in Hezhong Prefecture. Addressing those present, he said, “I am originally from Tangxing County in Taizhou. I have a younger brother there.” Then, doffing his tattered hempen robe, he donned a starry coronet and feathered sleeves, and lightly rose into the clouds, where faint strains of flute and pipe music echoed. Ma Zhen ascended as an immortal; the wife of Feng descended upon a crane.

Ma the Perfected, styled Ziran, was a native of Yanguan. His poetic works remain in the world. He indulged in wine without restraint in the markets of Li, sometimes sleeping amidst piled snow, sometimes wading into deep waters—nothing was beyond him. At the end of the Xiantong era, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight from a wineshop in Zizhou, Shu.

The wife of Feng Hui, Vice Prefect of Hezhong, was a woman of the Xue clan. She cultivated the Dao for over twenty years, and in the third month of the third year of Zhonghe, she underwent liberation in death. Thirty-six cranes descended into the courtyard of her residence, purple qi filled the sky, and her raven locks grew anew.
