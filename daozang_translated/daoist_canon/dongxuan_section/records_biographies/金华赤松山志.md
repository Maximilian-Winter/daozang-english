**Preface to the Chronicle of Jinhua Red Pine Mountain**

From my earliest years, I have emulated the Dao of the **Xīyí** lineage, aspiring to be a citizen of the **Gětiān** (Celestial Sovereign) realm. Dwelling on the left of **Red Pine Mountain**, what I heard and saw—though I could not fully fathom the origins of **Red Pine Zi** and the **Two Sovereigns** attaining the Dao—was already intuitively grasped in my heart.

Thus, I abandoned my home and parents, seeking my master’s teachings. Since receiving the blessings of the **crown and robes**—now over forty years ago—I have burned incense at dawn and lit lamps at dusk, never daring to slacken. In quiet meditation at dawn, with no other thoughts, I fear only that the traces of the immortals and their deeds may not be made clear for future generations.

Our ancestral mountain once had an engraved record of these matters, but time has worn it away. I thought: *As a descendant of the Two Sovereigns and a scion of **Chōnghé** Master, how can I allow the teachings of our ancestors to remain obscure?* Therefore, I gathered the origins, outlined the grand principles, distilled the essentials, and compiled this work, naming it *The Chronicle of Red Pine Mountain*, so that future seekers may have something to consult.

As for the accounts in **immortal biographies**, the records in **scriptures and inscriptions**, the oral traditions of the elders, and the poetic tributes to the mountain’s splendor—these are already evident without further search.

Alas, to omit much while selecting little, to speak vaguely without precision, would be a grave failing. Thus, the recluse **Bamboo Spring** of **Red Pine Mountain**, **Ní Shǒu Yuē**, writes this preface.

According to the *Records*, a **Xú** family member of the county encountered an immortal. The **Xú** family—today’s **Hútián Zhēnrén** (True Person of the Boiler Cavern)—is where the **chessboard** now stands. Its origins are ancient.

When the True Person appeared, **Red Pine Zi** concealed his name and dwelled near **Shàngxiāo** (Upper Expanse), refining himself in the left precinct of the **Dòngtiān** (Cavernous Heaven), until his **Língyuán** (Spiritual Essence) was perfected. He could ride the clouds and command the **qi**, attending the imperial court. Since the True Person did not dazzle the world, his era remains unrecorded. Yet his blessings endure in the region, and the people to this day benefit from his grace.

The place of his refinement is now the **Húpíng** (Boiler Screen), also called **Xūgōng Hú** (Master Xú’s Boiler). The True Person’s shrine stands in the county seat and at **Húpíng**, where the chessboard is. Whenever officials or magistrates pray, they invite the sacred **xiānghuǒ** (incense offerings) and seek **shèngshuǐ** (sacred water). Every year, the scholars and commoners of the county sacrifice in his honor, making it a customary observance.

**The Chronicle of Jinhua Red Pine Mountain**
**The Two Sovereigns**

The **Húpíng** (Boiler Screen) **Huáng** (Imperial) Line, its name concealed by choice. The **Huáng** (Imperial) Line flourished in **Shù Jìn** (a region, likely modern **Zhejiang**), yet its ancestors all hid their **virtue/power** (德) and did not seek office.

In the third year of **Tàiníng** (Great Peace) under the **Míng** (Bright) Emperor (April 8th), the **Huáng** (Imperial) Line gave birth to its eldest son, whose name was **Chūqǐ** (Initial Rise), known as the **Great Sovereign** (大皇君). In the third year of **Xiánhé** (Xian He) under the **Chéng** (Accomplished) Emperor (August 13th), it bore its second son, whose name was **Chūpíng** (Initial Peace), known as the **Lesser Sovereign** (小皇君). Both sovereigns were born with keen insight and extraordinary talent, their presence marked by unusual features.

The **Lesser Sovereign** (小君), at age fifteen, was sent by his family to tend sheep. There he met a **Daoist** (道士), admiring his upright and diligent nature, and led him into the stone chamber of **Jīnhuá Shān** (Gold Flower Mountain). The **Daoist** (道士) further revealed the illusory forms of the **Red Pine Master** (赤松子) and called him forth. The **Lesser Sovereign** (小君) then refined his essence within, severing all ties to worldly dust, and pursued the elusive and boundless. He claimed mastery over the **Júsuǐ** (Cinnabar Essence) techniques, explaining them with ease at his fingertips.

In the celestial court of the **Supreme Dao** (上帝), he bowed in reverence and presented himself. Through accumulated **virtue/power** (善) and tireless cultivation, he achieved perfection after forty years.

The **Great Sovereign** (大君), concerned for his younger brother’s absence, wandered through mountains and rivers, searching for his traces but failing to find him.

Later, in the marketplace, he encountered another **Daoist** (道士), skilled in divination, and consulted him. The **Daoist** (道士) said: *"Within Jīnhuá Shān (Gold Flower Mountain), there is a shepherd boy—he is not your younger brother?"*

Thus, they journeyed together to the stone chamber, where this **Daoist** (道士) also revealed the **Red Pine Master’s** (赤松子) lingering forms and called him forth.

The brothers met, both sorrowful and joyful.

The **Great Sovereign** (大君) asked: *"Where is the flock?"*
The **Little Sovereign** (小君) replied: *"It is close by in the mountain folds."*
When the **Great Sovereign** (大君) went to look, nothing was seen—only countless white stones.
Upon his return, he told the **Little Sovereign** (小君): *"There are no sheep."*
The **Little Sovereign** (小君) said: *"The sheep are here, but you simply do not see them."*
Then, together, they went to the mountain folds.
The **Little Sovereign** (小君) spoke with a shout—at once, all the white stones transformed into tens of thousands of sheep.
This is the origin of **Outer Sheep Mountain** (外羊山).

The **Great Sovereign** (大君) said: *"My brother has attained such divine powers (神通). Can I learn them?"*
The **Little Sovereign** (小君) replied: *"Only through devotion to the Dao (好、道) can one attain them."*

Thus, the **Great Sovereign** (大君) abandoned his wife and children, remained with the **Little Sovereign** (小君), and together they consumed **pine resin** (松脂) and **slimy fungi** (狭苓).
After five thousand days, they could sit motionless while others perished, and at midday, their shadows vanished, their complexions taking on the hue of youthful boys.
Having perfected their cultivation (修道), they returned to their hometown to visit their families, but found all their old kin had passed away.

Now beneath the stone chamber (石室) lies a cave—this was the secret retreat (秘宫) where the two Sovereigns dwelled deeply.
The two Sovereigns taught their disciples, including **Nánbó Féng** (南伯逢), through the **pine resin and slimy fungi** (服脂苓) method, and afterward, passed it on, instructing another tens of thousands who attained the **Divine Fatigue** (神倦).

The *Record of Divine Fatigue* (《神倦传》) states: After the two Sovereigns attained the Dao (得道), the **Great Sovereign** (大君) was known as **Lǔ Bān** (鲁班), and the **Little Sovereign** (小君) was also called **Red Pine Master** (赤松子).
This was their way of avoiding renown and startling the world, so they used false names and hid themselves to remain unnoticed.
This followed the precedent of **Red Pine Master** (赤松子) adopting the name **Yellow Stone Master** (黄石公).

At the peak of **Pine Mountain** (松山), both Sovereigns had fully mastered the Dao (君道备).
For the purpose of refining the elixir (炼丹), when it was complete, the **Great Sovereign** (大君) rode a stag, the **Little Sovereign** (小君) ascended on a crane, and together they soared upon the clouds.
This is **Great Ambush Mountain** (大篑山).

After their ascension (既仙), the people of their homeland conspired to establish a place for their spirits (栖神之所), and thus built **Red Pine Temple** (赤松宫), honoring their teacher, **Red Pine Master** (赤松子), and worshipping him.
They summoned those who sought their Dao (学其道者) to preside over it.
From the **Jìn Dynasty** (晋) to our own era (我朝), the incense and offerings have flourished without end, and the number of **Daoists** (道士) revering them has never fallen below a hundred.
Their devout hearts know no bounds.

According to the *Register of the Transcendent* (仙录):
The place where **Tàixū Zhēnrén** (太虚真人) attained the Dao (得道处) in **Nán Yuè Héng Shān** (南岳衡山) was entrusted by the **Jade Emperor** (玉帝) to **Xiǎo Huángjūn** (小皇君), who was tasked with overseeing the **divine constellations of the world** (世界分野神).
In the **16th year of Chóngxī** (孝庙淳熙) of the **Sòng Dynasty** (宋), the **Great Sovereign** (大君) was ennobled as **Chōngyīng Zhēnrén** (冲应真人), and the **Little Sovereign** (小君) as **Yǎngsù Zhēnrén** (养素真人).
In the **3rd year of Jǐngdìng** (景定) of the **Sòng Dynasty** (宋), the titles were further elevated: the **Great Sovereign** (大君) became **Chōngyīng Zhēngǎn Zhēnrén** (冲应诤感真人), and the **Little Sovereign** (小君) was named **Yǎngsù Zhēngzhèng Zhēnrén** (养素诤正真人).
Ah, how splendid! The **Supreme Dao** (大道) spreads far and wide, and the **orthodox teaching** (正教) flourishes in clarity.
Their blessings shelter the realm, extending for countless ages.

**Elixir category** (丹类):
The **transmitted elixir** (遗丹).

The *Yèyí Dān Jì* records:

When the Two Sovereigns refined the elixir and ascended to the Dao, their **elixir blessings** (丹宠) and the **elixir well** (丹井) remained. The **transmitted elixir** (遗丹) on the mountain manifests irregularly—sometimes large, sometimes small; sometimes near, sometimes distant. Many have witnessed it with their own eyes, too numerous to recount.

When the **elixir mountain** (丹山) is shrouded in night or twilight, or when the sky is overcast, misty, or veiled in smoke and rain, its glow shimmers like the rising sun—could this not be the radiance of the **transmitted elixir**?

Now, I briefly recount a few instances.

The mountain-guard Daoist **Hào Fèngshī**, ever devoted to his master, kept a white parrot that greeted the dawn. One day, the parrot suddenly shrieked and pecked at something—small and round, yet glowing with five colors. Hào quickly gathered it, then summoned his fellow Daoists to pay homage. But when they arrived, the elixir had vanished.

Another mountain-guard Daoist, **Shěn Yìngfú**, saw flickering light outside his window just before midnight. He opened the door and saw an object the size of a parrot, its light growing dimmer as it retreated, then brighter as it approached. When he returned indoors, the light still illuminated his window as before. Truly, the mountain spirit guards its treasure—one may observe from afar, but dare not profane it.

**Elixir blessings** (丹宠) are ranked in three tiers, and there is an **elixir tripod** (丹鼎) upon the altar.

The **elixir foundation** (丹基) lies to the left of the **Tàiqīng Hall** (太清殿) on the elixir mountain. Where **true yang** (真阳) gathers, snow never accumulates, and grass never withers.

**Cave category** (洞穴类):
**Dōngyuán Dòngtiān** (洞元洞天)

The **Thirty-Six Heavenly Caverns** (系三十六洞天) are also called **Jīnhuá Dòngtiān** (金华洞天), adjoining the **Chìsōng Mountain** (赤松山) and divided into three tiers—upper, middle, and lower.

The **Upper Cavern** (上洞) is named **Cháozhēn** (朝真), the **Middle Cavern** (中洞) **Bīnghú** (冰壶), and the **Lower Cavern** (下洞) **Shuānglóng** (双龙). Its grandeur is towering and precipitous, with cliffs and caverns rising in majestic defiance. Mists and clouds swirl in intricate patterns, their **qi** (气) and momentum vast and imposing. Above, it rivals the radiance of **Niúqiān** (牛千), below, it connects with the **Luófú** (罗浮) peaks. Within the **Upper Cavern**, a **Stone True Person** (石真人) stands solemnly, his presence inscrutable, his form beyond measure.

The **Middle Cavern** features a cascading waterfall like a curtain of ice, with frozen jade shattering in flight. Between its depths lie stone statues and stalagmites—according to **Daoist scriptures**, these are guarded by extraordinary mountain spirits, untouched by mortal hands.

The **Lower Cavern** houses stone carvings of dragons, tigers, lions, elephants, unicorns, phoenixes, and ritual bells and drums, too numerous to count. Snow-capped peaks also lie within. The **Táng of Póyáng** (鄱阳汤) once composed a verse:
*"Golden halls and jade chambers interlocked in shadow,*
*Who lifts the pearl curtains and emerald blinds?*
*For within the caverns lie treasures and halls,*
*Doors and windows in motion."*

The entrance to the **Lower Cavern** is exceedingly low—one may enter only by boat. Once inside, without lanterns, nothing is visible. This **Dòngtiān** was originally under the jurisdiction of **Chìsōng** (赤松). As recorded in the *Bóyì Zhì* (博异志), the **Huáng** brothers, having attained **Dao**, dwelled here. The *Dòngtiān Fúdì Zhì* (洞天福地志) states that a local **Huáng** clan practiced **Dao** here, and all petitions inscribed on **Dragon Tablets** (龙简) were answered. During the **Jiāxī** era (嘉熙), imperial descendants sought heirs and made vows here. A **Green Incisions Stele** (青诃碑) from the palace attests to this.

The **Yōuxiāo Dòng** (优游洞) lies in **Shàngxiāo** (上霄), ten *li* from the palace and just beyond **Húbǐng** (壶屏). Its entrance is five *chi* high, but within, the cavern expands to a breadth of two or three *zhàng*, with a staircase ascending to the left before another ladder leads deeper inside. From above, it appears vast as a grand hall, spanning tens of *mù* in width—an extension beyond the **Thirty-Six Heavenly Caverns**. Mist and **xiāo** (烟霞) intertwine, and **stone marrow** (石髓) glows with luminous essence. The elders say it is the domain of the **Hútian True Person** (壶天真人) and the registry of the **Two Sovereigns** (二皇君).

The **Rúzhāi Wáng Gōng** (潜斋王公) also left an inscription nearby:
*"Shàngxiāo is no latecomer,*
*Its **xiāo** (烟霞) cradles a lone grace.*
*Green **r** (青r) thickens in shadow,*
*White **rù** (白乳) still gleams bright.*
*A shrine to the **Xú True Person** (徐真人) stands beside it."*

Nearby lies the **Shísì Dòng** (石室洞).

The **Lúoshī Yán** (螺狮岩) lies beside it, marking the place where **Hóngxiān Zǐ** (赤松子) led the **Little Sovereign** (小皇君) into the mountains to cultivate the **Dao/Way** (修道).

Above, there is the **Stone Chamber** (石室), towering over ten *zhàng* in height, with equal breadth and width. To its left lies the **cavern** (洞), which, since the **Little Sovereign** attained the **Dao/Way** (得道), has its entrance sealed deep and high, forbidding mortal access.

The mountain resembles **Jīnhuá Shān** (金华山), encircling tens of *lǐ*—this is **Hóngxiān Shān** (赤松山). The *Bàopǔ Zǐ* (《抱朴子》) states: *"This place is fit for deities to dwell, spared from the calamities of the Five Peaks and the Great Flood."* The **Han Dynasty** (汉) **Thirty-Sixth Generation Celestial Master** (三十代天师), **Xūjìng Xiānsheng** (虚静先生) **Zhāng Gōng** (张公), who cherished benevolence, once visited and sighed in admiration of **Hóngxiān Zǐ**’s **Dao/Way** (风) and the **Little Sovereign**’s proximity, leaving these verses:

*"My home lies within the white clouds,*
*I dwell with **Hóngxiān Zǐ** (赤松子).*
*When I come here, the mountain’s majesty,*
*Like **Lónghǔ** (龙虎) guarding the land.*
*No need to seek beyond **Jīnhuá** (金华),*
*For its **huáng yá** (黄芽) is already such.*

The **Alchemy Mountain** (炼丹山) rises thousands of *xún* in height, five *lǐ* from the palace. From the palace’s left, one follows a level path to its base, crosses a small bridge, and ascends a steep ridge. At its summit, the landscape is broad and open, with sights beyond the ordinary—one can see hundreds of *lǐ* in every direction, as if within arm’s reach.

This is the **Little Sovereign**’s place of alchemical practice (炼丹之所). Upon it stands a **hermitage** (庵), tended annually by a **Daoist priest** (道士). The **Luminous Elixir Cavern** (丹光洞) shines forth, its radiance moistening the grasses and trees; within the mountain grow over three hundred kinds of medicinal herbs (凡可以为药者). **Shěn Yuē** (沈约) of the **Liáng Dynasty** (梁), once **Prefect of this Commandery** (本郡太守), composed verses on the spot:

*"Guests arrive, clasping **stone marrow** (石髓),*
*Visitors come, riding the **lightly soaring phoenix** (轻鸿).*
*The path is barred to all,*
*Only the **cloud path** (云路) remains open."*

During the **Xiàoxīng Reign** (绍兴问), incense and **jìngfú** (降香祈福) were sought here. Below lies the **Weary Fields** (倦田), stretching one or two *lǐ*, fragmented and uneven. From afar, the fields appear tiered like steps; tradition holds they are where the **Little Sovereign** cultivated **soul-seeds** (灵苗) of **húmá** (胡麻, hemp). Since the **Five Dynasties** (五代), the fields have been sown with mixed grains, and their produce is no longer fit for tribute.

The **Daoist priest of the Original Observatory** (本观道士), **Shū Dào** (舒道), left these verses:

*"To this day, the **Alchemy Well’s waters** (丹井水) linger,*
*Filling these mountain fields with fragrance."*

The **Cozy Sheep Mountain** (卧羊山) spans several *lǐ* in circumference, rising tens of *xún* in height, directly opposite **Hóngxiān Palace** (赤松宫). Here, the **Little Sovereign** summoned stones to become sheep (叱石成羊). Upon its peak, **stone sheep** (石羊) still graze; no mountain deity dares interfere, nor does it permit mortals to covet their presence. The forests are dense, impenetrable.

**Su Shì** (东坡先生) once praised it in verse:

*"The Master nurtures life like tending sheep,*
*Sets them free in lands of boundless ease.*
*When they stop, they stop; when they move, they move,*
*The Master sits aloof, detached.*
*Clutching scrolls, he reads—no sheep stray,*
*Transformed to stone, they rise again, stiff.*
*Drooling, grinding teeth, they mock the tigers and wolves,*
*The Master points, calls—sheep obey, entering the box."*

Later, **Zhèng Shìyì** (三山郑士懿), a **Master of the Imperial University** (太学博士), also visited and wrote:

*"Seeing sheep, I doubt they were stones I summoned,*
*Seeing stones, I fear they were sheep not yet turned.*
*Neither sheep nor stone—what do I see?*
*These meanings are hard to fathom."*

The **Great Shovel Mountain** (大篑山) lies to the palace’s east, just one *lǐ* away. This is where the **Little Sovereign** ascended by flight (飞举之地), though common folk call it **Falling Mountain** (堕坠山). The mountain’s slope plunges from **Hútian** (壶屏) like a dragon’s descent, winding and precarious in form.

The **Sacred Stone Mountain** (圣石山) stands to the left of **Cozy Sheep Mountain** (卧羊山) and south of the palace, facing it across a stream where fields lie. Once, there were over ten massive stones in the fields, each spanning several *wéi* (围) in width, hindering plowing. The farmers prayed to the **Little Sovereign**, and by the next dawn, the stones had flown to the mountain’s side. All marveled at the divine wonder, calling them **Sacred Stones** (圣石). The **Little Sovereign** appointed an **immortal official** (仙官) to oversee them.

The **Lúoshān Yán** (螺蛳岩) lies to the left of the **Stone Chamber** (石室), its inner passage connecting to it. Outside, it appears narrow and confined; within, it resembles a hollow cavern. The rock twists like a **spiral shell** (螺蛳), giving it its name.

The **Lúo Dàoyán** (刘道岩) is beside **Lúoshān Yán** (螺蛳岩). Once, a **Daoist practitioner** (学道者), **Liú Dàorén** (刘道人), attained the **Dao/Way** (得道) here and departed.

The **Hútian** (壶屏) lies to the left of the **Yōuyóu Cavern** (悠游洞), where the **Hútian True Person** (壶天真人) refines his **virtue/power** (修炼). Here, the ground is solid—stepping upon it yields a hollow sound (履之空空有声). Where it is void, the foot sinks without resistance, unable to be lifted (虚处随足陷，没不可举).

The **Lesser Dao/Way Springs** (水类)

**Small Peach Source** (小桃源)
Lies beside the **Palace** (宫). Within the Palace, from the left temple, one may hear the **Peach Source’s resonance** (桃源之律), flowing forward like the **Yǐ River** (沂流), with springs and rocks clashing—waves surging though no wind stirs. Walk another hundred steps, and there stands a **pavilion** (亭), named: **"Beyond the Material World"** (物外). A hundred more steps, and a **ravine** (涧) cuts across, its signpost reading: **"The Narrows"** (峡). The roaring waves crash and thunder, their beginning unknown before, their end unseen behind—truly as if a **chariot’s dust** (舆尘) separates this place from the world.

Passing the **Twisting Stone** (盘石), one gazes upon the **Deep Flowing Stream** (浚流). It is not merely different from the **material world** (物外), but also from the **Three Gorges** (三峡). A **small bridge** (小桥) stretches across, and upon it stands a pavilion on a great stone, named: **"Stone Echo"** (石泓). Ascending further, the **trickling waters** (潺湲) never cease, until one crosses the **Mossy Stone** (蒙石) and rests beneath the **withered willow** (槁梧). Beyond this, one may climb to the **Red Mountain** (丹山). This is where the **Two Sovereigns** (二皇君) gather the **assemblage of immortals** (群仙) on the **three auspicious occasions and eight festival days** (三元八节).

Those who dwell in the mountain often rise early, sometimes hearing sounds like **palace bells tolling and officials moving** (宫俯考掠声). When they search at dawn’s light, nothing remains. Once, there were places like **Holding Jade and Riding the Wind** (柄碧御风) and **Cool and Tranquil** (泠然), but now they are gone.

**East Treasury** (东库) summoned **Master** (先生) to record it, preserving its splendor.

**Red Spring** (丹井)
Lies in the **northeast corner** (左隅) of **Red Mountain** (丹山). When the **Two Sovereigns** (二皇君) were about to ascend the Dao/Way, they feigned a **stone screen** (石屏) above the spring, covered with a **stone lotus** (石荷), resembling that of the **Favored Official** (宠相). They enshrined **Stone Lord Lao** (石老君) within and buried the spring, so that none would know the **immortals’ true traces** (神仙果迹) lay here. Instead, they substituted another spring.

Its waters **specifically nourish** (专厦) the **uterus** (不个), capable of curing illnesses and **divinely aiding all remedies** (神济无方). Later, a **careless Daoist practitioner** (慢道者) grew weary of its **touch** (厌触), and the spring ceased to flow. The **sealed spring** (自塞) became a warning for the **mountain-guardian Daoists** (守山道士), until the **Two Sovereigns** (二皇君) personally pointed with their **crimson fingers** (绛指), revealing it. Thus, the spring suddenly appeared—workers hastily gathered to dig away the earth, and there it was. The enshrined **Stone Lord Lao** (老君) lay within the **favored one’s chamber** (宠中), his visage **stern and ancient** (严古), his **headgear and robes** (冠裳) arranged in **imperial splendor** (坐宸), all in **solemn order** (肃整)—as if descended from the heavens.

All were **astonished and awestruck** (惊愕), so they enshrined him in the **Hall of Supreme Clarity** (太清殿). This **Red Spring** (丹井) is indeed the **ancient spring** (故井).

**Gě Wéixiāo** (梁国葛惟肖) of **Young River’s lineage** (稚川耳孙) composed a poem about it:

*"Refining the **Purple River Chariot** (紫河车),
Drawing the **Great Yin Essence** (太阴精).
The **lead male** (铅男) sinks into the **Jade Cavern** (玉洞),
The **mercury female** (汞女) hides in the **Golden City** (金城)."*

This refers to the **Red Spring** (丹井).

The **Sacred Stone Bay** lies beneath the Pavilion for Sending Guests at the palace’s fore, to the left of Sacred Stone Mountain, where a **monolithic Sacred Stone** stands immovable. The **Vessel-Heaven True Person** once tamed dragons here.

The **Clear Water Pool** is to the palace’s right, before the Pavilion of Pure Emotion. In days past, a great stone ram stood here, but fearing it might be seized by mortals, the immortals caused it to plunge into the pool, where it remains unseen.

The **Imperial Favor** asked: *"When the floodwaters toppled the Bell Tower, the bell sank within—where is it now? Yet on nights when the wind is clear and the moon bright, one hears its resonant chimes beneath, harmonizing with the *Step-into-Vacuity* rhythm."*

The **Palace Complex**, akin to the **Treasure-Accumulating Hall**—that is, the **Red Pine Palace**—
According to the inscription on the hall’s stele, the **Two Sovereign Lords** attained immortality after receiving Dao from **Red Pine the Child**. The people of the land deliberated: *"In ancient times, when the sage sought Dao at Kongtong, emperors and kings sent petitions with favorable winds. Now, this is a sacred site not to be overlooked—thus, the Red Pine Palace was built."*

The **True Temple** was renamed in the **Great Harmony and Auspicious Symbols** era of the **Great Central** reign. The palace faces **Outer Sheep Mountain**, with two streams before it merging into one: one descending from **Upper Exaltation**, the other flowing from **Chessboard** through **Small Peach Source**.

Within the palace, ascending leftward from **Hemp Path** leads to **Peach Source Ferry**; entering rightward through **Responding Gate** reveals the **Rinsing-Jade** and **Pillow-the-Current** scenic spots. A few more steps bring one to the **Pavilion of Pure Clarity**, where one may gaze upon **Gargling-Jade**. Wandering the palace halls, one may behold the **literati’s and virtuous men’s** poetic elegance. Imperial decrees, inscribed stones, and edicts are enshrined in the **Hall of Imperial Calligraphy**.

Since **Master Chongzhen of the Perfected Truth** established his name in the **Central Great One** of the Eastern Capital and propagated the Dao, his lineage has never waned. Later, **Master Purple Void Yellow** revitalized the hall’s affairs, restoring its order anew.

The **Golden Flower Hall** stands beside **Double Dragon Cave**, overseeing the incense offerings of the **Three Caves**. Originally, it was a subordinate hall of **Red Pine’s Lower Palace**.

The **Cloud Nest Hermitage** sits atop **Dan Mountain**, with tens of halls. The palace annually assigns a Daoist to oversee it—not only to patrol the sacred terrain but also to welcome scholars who seek immortals among the pines and vines.

The **Hall of Supreme Clarity** is beside **Cloud Nest** on **Dan Mountain**, where the **Stone Lord Lao’s** incense is now enshrined.

The **Shrine of the Two Sovereign Lords** lies beneath **Great Chui Mountain**; officials and magistrates must pay homage here.

**Fan Jun** composed a poem:
*"A thousand years the sacred shrine preserves the true trace,
Beneath it, ancient pines rise a hundred feet tall.
The weary one rides the whale and does not return—
How often have I asked the mountain’s stone?"*

The **Shrine of the Vessel-Heaven True Person** stands before **Leisurely Play Cave**, with three locations: one at **Vessel Screen**, one at **Chessboard**, and one within the palace. Prayers here are unceasing.

The **Weary Stone Palace Shrine** is to the left of **Sacred Stone Bay**, where the **Sacred Stone** is guarded.

According to the *Omen Records*, this stone is a transformation of **golden treasure**, capable of manifesting radiance. Thus, the **Two Sovereign Lords** commanded celestial officials to oversee it.

The **Shrine of Dan Mountain’s Celestial Officials** is beside **Cloud Nest Hermitage** on **Dan Mountain**. Whenever **crimson light** is exhaled and inhaled, it is due to the prayers of the people—never without response. Those who ascend **Dan Mountain** without reverence will surely face manifest retribution, compelling them to cultivate the **Dao of the Established Path**.

The **Cloud Platform Hall** lies ten *li* west of the city, named **Bao Star**. Originally, it was the hermitage where **Luo the Immortal Nun** and her brother cultivated. They once encountered a **white-clad immortal** who did not eat fire-cooked food. Later, **He the Immortal Nun** and her brother continued the tradition, petitioning for a precept as **female Daoists**. They too ascended at eighty, after which **Red Pine the Child** led them to request relocation to **Lan Stream**, and the hall was renamed as a subordinate of **Red Pine’s Lower Palace**.

The **Concentrated Spirit Hermitage** is ten *li* west of the city, one *li* from **Dixi Pond**. It was **Master Zhu’s** retreat for cultivation. The master, bold in withdrawing from official duties, built this hermitage to honor his parents, vowing to sever all worldly ties—yet the tracks outside his door were soon filled with visitors from far and wide.

**Master Rong Jing of the Retired Study** composed a poem in praise:
*"Abandoning the allure of groves and streams,
The hermitage stands near the village.
Two windows swallow sun and moon,
One chamber nurtures Heaven and Earth.
Autumn dewdrops weigh the hemp fence,
Midday pine winds warm the pillow.
On the lotus cushion, breath deepens—
No desire to follow others’ paths."*

Years later, during the **Reverence for the Temple** era, it was granted the name **Concentrated Spirit Retreat**. The high-minded man took it as his title, and later received an imperial decree, solidifying **Concentrated Spirit** as its name.

**Master Shu Daoji**
Master Shu, named Daoji, was a man of the Tang era. Born and raised in Zhi County, he became a disciple of the **赤松黄冠** (Crimson Pine Yellow-Crowned Master). Beyond cultivating his heart and nature, he took delight solely in literature and calligraphy. Renowned officials successively honored him, inviting him to wander the rivers and lakes, and wherever he stayed, he left behind verses of elegance. Though repeatedly recommended to the court and granted six official appointments, he would shrug them off and depart, as if awaiting a later time. Unconcerned with fame or fortune, he styled himself **Huayinzi** and maintained a close, unbroken friendship with the Chan Master **Guanyue** (Acuan Resting Moon). Daily, he paid homage to the shrines of the **Two Sovereigns**, his expressions and spirit merging in ways no one could fathom—whether his encounters were fortunate or not.

He once wrote:
*"The ancient pine endures at Crimson Pine’s source,
Its grove still stands as in the temple’s dream.
All men have brothers, yet who shares the Dao of immortals?
Two cranes ascend to the heavens, a flock of sheep turns to stone in slumber.
To this day, the elixir well’s waters
Fill this mountain’s fields with fragrance."*

Later, he abandoned food and departed without illness. Several years afterward, he was seen at **Chicheng**.

**Master Chongzhen Dong**
Master Dong, named Weizhi, was a lover of learning and a prodigy of letters, yet he pursued no worldly trade. He took refuge at Crimson Pine, nourishing his understanding through scriptures, seeking communion with the transcendent. When the court officials learned of his name, they recommended him to the **Divine Temple**, where his mastery of scriptural principles and their applications delighted the emperor, who then conferred upon him the **赤松黄冠** title and later the **Chongzhen** (Penetrating Truth) Master rank along with purple robes.

Not long after, he oversaw the **Middle Taiyi** affairs in the Eastern Capital and the **Philosopher’s Temple**. During the **Yuan You** era, he begged leave to return to his mountain home, and the emperor praised him, allowing him to once again oversee the **Baoji Observatory**.

**Master Zixu Huang**
Master Huang, named Yanda, styled **Xingke**, hailed from his native county, twenty li from the palace. **Zixu Dongling** was his master’s title. Well-versed in all texts, he excelled in the poetry of the Tang and Song dynasties. Upon meeting a sage, he was taught esoteric protections, and thus he practiced all major teachings, relieving others’ suffering and answering prayers with swift responses. People from all directions flocked to him, calling him **Huang Zhenren** (Yellow True Person).

During the **Shaoxing** era, he took charge of the observatory for over thirty years, renewing its regulations and expanding its lands. Thanks to his virtue, the Dao thrived under his shelter to this day, unceasing. He established the **Lingji Hall** for cultivation and guidance, and in his leisure, he amused himself with chess and qin.

**Master Zilei Sheng**
Master Sheng, named Kuang, styled **Yuanfang**, was from Wuzhen. His mother dreamed of swallowing a five-colored light before conceiving him. At ten, he began studying the Dao at the **San Dong** of Jinhua, and by fifteen or sixteen, he moved to Crimson Pine. Beyond reciting scriptures, he delighted in composing verse, turning every encounter or object into poetic inspiration. His work *The Crimson Pine Chapter* reflected his residence in Jinhua and Crimson Pine.

He practiced inner alchemy without respite. During the **Shaoxing** era, through the empress’s recommendation, he was summoned to court for his method of beheading a red dragon. The emperor, hearing his name, had his likeness painted and called him in. Sheng entered the palace, where the emperor granted him an audience in the **Yujin Garden**, discussing Daoist mysteries. Upon his return, the emperor bestowed a painted fan and commissioned him to collate Daoist texts. Later, he petitioned to travel to **Qingcheng in Shu**, which was granted, along with an empty title and multiple **dujie** (ordination certificates) to cover travel expenses.

Upon his return, he paid homage to the emperor again, who delighted in him and bestowed the title **Zilei Master** along with gold and jade. After expressing his gratitude and returning to the mountains, he established a small hermitage in the palace grounds, naming it **Yingyang** (Welcoming the Dawn).

He was particularly skilled in the **Yijing**, often debating with **Heshang Liu Dabian** (Crane Mountain Liu the Debater). Among his dwellings, he named one **Zilei**. He continued his silent cultivation, once composing:
*"Engraved names on purple tablets welcome demonic guests,
The mulberry tree’s dawn valley resounds with jade chimes.
Guiding the celestial carriage through three pure realms,
How could I forget Madame Wei of Nan Yue?"*

At over seventy, he sat in meditation and departed.

**Master Chonghe Zhou**
Master Zhou, named Dachuan, styled **Jiuji**, with the sobriquet **Chengzhai**, was from his native county. From childhood, he entered the Dao, devoting himself to its traditions. Later, a skilled adept remarked, *"This man can awaken the sovereign with a single word."* By the time his virtues and wisdom were complete, the **Ning Temple** summoned him. He was lodged in the **High Sage Hall** and later entrusted with the **Wanshou Incense Offerings**. The emperor treated him with great respect, granting his mountain home exemption from taxes and establishing a **Mountain Gate Daoist Administrator’s Office**.

Several years later, he declined imperial favors and returned to his roots, but the community urged him to remain as their mountain master. He managed the estate with absolute integrity, never shortchanging the community, and when others defaulted on land repayments, he used his own resources to cover them. His reputation for virtue and teaching spread far.

He also excelled in poetry and music, playing the qin to the Dao’s rhythm—skills others could not match. He was a close friend of **Tongmiao Master Yi Rujang**.

During the **Jiading** era, the emperor still cherished both men, granting them **xiangjian** (symbolic tablets) and bestowing the titles of **Master**. Their imperial decrees are preserved in the **Chonghe Daoist Academy’s Imperial Decree Hall**.

**Master Dao Lu Han**
Master Han, named Yanghao, was a tireless reader, mastering ten lines at once. While wandering the rivers and lakes, he formed a literary friendship with the recluse **Yang Xiwen**, exchanging poems and calligraphy. Court officials and ministers all deferred to him. During the **Shaoding** era, his literary fame grew, and the **Divine Temple** summoned him to the capital, appointing him overseer of the **Taiyi**. From then on, imperial favor deepened, with repeated grants culminating in his appointment as **Left Street Daoist Recorder**. He departed at over seventy.

**Master Zhu Zhichang**
Master Zhu, named Zhichang, styled **Jiudao**, with the sobriquet **Cishan**, was from his native county. A scholar of Confucian learning and well-versed in Buddhist and Daoist teachings, he abstained from meat his whole life, once declaring, *"Official success cannot delay me further—I sigh as I follow the Crimson Pine Master, becoming a Yellow-Crowned Teacher."*

Before half his life had passed, he twice resided in the **Jia Mountain Daoist Path** (*Jia Mountain* being a Daoist retreat). His elder revered him, and during the **Bao’you era**, in the year **Jingzhen** (丙辰), he was appointed to oversee the **Yu Zhai** (*Abundant Hall*).

Lord **Guangzu** summoned him by imperial decree to preside over **Tea Mountain’s Jade Dawn** (*Tea Mountain* being a Daoist mountain; *Jade Dawn* a Daoist title). Soon after, the **Grand Master of the Daoist Sect** (*Shitan*), hearing of his renown, petitioned the **Divine Temple** to transfer his post to oversee **Chongxi** (*Venerable Peace*). The following year, he was granted favor and summoned to preside over **Yousheng’s Sacred Observation** (*Yousheng* being an era name; *Sacred Observation* a Daoist title), then promoted to **Left Street Daoist Inspecting Virtue** (*Jian Yi* being a Daoist office).

Whenever he encountered **rain and wind** (*Yu Yang* referring to celestial omens or auspicious weather), his prayers and supplications were repeatedly answered, and the emperor delighted, so he was transferred to the **Concentrated Spirit Hall**. The **Grand Master of the Daoist Sect** (*Kaicheng*), upon hearing of the **Liao tribes** crossing the river and invading **Ezhou’s marshes** (*Cathay* being the Song dynasty’s name for China; *Ezhou* a region; *marshes* referring to the Yangtze’s floodplains), thus commanded the erection of an altar. He invoked **Yin Forces** (*Yin* being the dark, feminine principle in Daoism) to aid the battle, and it proved effective. The emperor rewarded him with the title **Left Street Daoist Recorder**, as well as **symbolic talismans, fragrant wine cups, and ritual implements**.

By the **Jingding era’s fourth year**, when the **Sacred Scripture Recorder of Tea Mountain** (*Xingjing Jilu*) succeeded the **Master of the Daoist Sect** (*Siji*), the emperor specially inscribed his name in imperial script, designating him the **41st Generation Master of the Daoist Sect**. In his youth, he studied the *Yijing* (*Book of Changes*) in his hometown. Later, through **Lu Duan-shu** (*Master Lu*), he gained insights into the *Yijing* from **Zhou Yuanjiu** (*Master Zhou of Qiyang*), compiling his observations into a single volume, which he presented to the emperor. Master Zhu understood the **Dao of the *Yijing***—the principles of advancement and retreat—with profound clarity. In the **Xianchun era’s second year**, he felt a boundless return to the **Dao**, so he built a small hermitage behind his residence to amuse himself.

His **edicts and memorials** were modeled after those of the **True Lord of the Crimson Pine** (*Lingxu Zhenjun*, a mythical Daoist immortal).

**Edicts and Memorials**

**On the Efficaciousness of the Dao:**

The Dao has no fixed form—
when offerings are sought, omens appear in auspicious signs,
manifesting through sudden, responsive grace.

The **True Lord of the Crimson Pine** (*Chisong Zhenjun*) is recorded in the *Lüanlü* (a Daoist scripture),
the teacher of **Shennong** (the Divine Farmer),
whose blessings of rain and timely aid
fulfill all petitions.
He is revered by the people of a land,
his virtue enduring as if alive through the ages.
In gratitude for his divine responses,
we honor him with the title **True Lord of the Crimson Pine, Soaring Beyond the Void**.

**Edict of the Yuanfu Era (1100 CE)**

**On the Virtue of the Yellow-Lao Tradition:**

Though the teachings of **Yellow-Lao** (*Huang-Lao*, the syncretic Daoist school)
prioritize emptiness and detachment,
their true intent lies in benevolence and love for humanity.

The **True Lords of Initial Rise** (*Chuqǐ Zhenjun*) and **Initial Peace** (*Chupíng Zhenjun*)
were born in the Jin Dynasty,
retiring to **Jinhua** in seclusion.
They summoned stones to form a ram as proof of their Daoist attainment,
and their healing of the sick through well-water
expanded their merit for saving lives.
Ascending to the celestial halls,
their temples gleam with divine splendor,
revered by the people of their land,
their legacy enduring as if alive through the ages.

The people of **Shuyang** petitioned in unison,
requesting their official recognition and exalted titles.
In contemplation of their sacred virtues,
we decree their proper honors.

The **True Lord of Initial Rise** may be specially ennobled as **Responsive True Person of the Void** (*Chōngyìng Zhēnrén*).
The **True Lord of Initial Peace** may be specially ennobled as **Nurturing-Substance True Person** (*Yǎngsù Zhēnrén*).

**Ennobled in the 16th Year of Chunxi (1189 CE), June 17th**

**On the Marvels of the Dao’s Perfection:**

The profound mysteries of the **Dao’s authenticity** are expounded in the teachings of **Zhuangzi and Laozi**,
while the legends of immortals flourished from the Qin and Han onward.
Yet to transcend the formless void and appear as tangible, verified wonders—
the first is the **Responsive True Person of the Void** (*Chōngyìng Zhēnrén*),
the second is the **Nurturing-Substance True Person** (*Yǎngsù Zhēnrén*).

Your brothers’ fame is inscribed in history:
they summoned stones to manifest living forms,
their elixirs preserved their lingering essence,
ascending on mist and clouds in fleeting visions,
invoking rain or clearing storms with responsive power.

To this day, their sacred shrines at **Baoji** inspire reverence in **Jinhua’s** lands.
It is fitting to bestow honorific titles to reflect their true essence.

The **Responsive True Person of the Void** may be specially ennobled as **Responsive True Person of the Cold Senses** (*Chōngyìng Lěnggǎn Zhēnrén*).
The **Nurturing-Substance True Person** may be specially ennobled as **Nurturing-Substance Rectifying Virtue True Person** (*Yǎngsù Zhēngzhèng Zhēnrén*).

**Ennobled in the 3rd Year of Jingding (1230 CE), December 10th**
