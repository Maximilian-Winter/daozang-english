**Preface to the Records of Daoist Efficacy**

By Song Emperor Huizong (Imperial Composition #1)

The **mystic Dao** originates from the **primordial chaos**, and the **most divine** manifestations are beyond measure. The **scriptures and edicts** reveal the **harmonious correspondence** of phenomena, while **temples and observatories** enshrine the **sublime and numinous**. The **seals and records** preserve the **authentic rituals**, and **fasting and rites** express the **sincere devotion**. The **verifications** of efficacy are manifold, and the **clarity** of the **rituals and their responses** shows no distinction. The **truth** is awakened in the **vast and dark**, and the **rectitude** is manifest in the **discrimination of good and evil**.

I, though **limited in understanding**, have ascended the throne of **Longevity and Peace**. Bestowed with the **blessings of universal fortune**, I strive to **harmonize and clarify** without slacking, seeking to **proclaim the Dao’s mysteries** and **universally demonstrate** its **wondrous principles**.

Upon reviewing *Records of Daoist Efficacy*, compiled by Du Guangting in **twenty volumes**, its **matters are evident and essential**, its **doctrines are true and detailed**. What has been heard from **past and present**, fills the **scrolls in order**. The **extraordinary** stands close, and **opening the volumes** preserves these **wonders**.

I hope that the **Dao’s** efficacy may endure forever, so that its teachings may be inscribed upon the **carved blocks** of history, thereby serving as a model for instruction and ensuring the flourishing of **pure and virtuous customs**.

Here, I recount its origins, prefacing the text thus:

**Du Guangting’s Composition #2**
The **Dao’s** application is **silent and actionless**,
The **Dao’s** essence is **filled with compassion and trust**.

When **actionless**, it lets **things transform naturally**;
When **trust is held**, its effects unfold with **spontaneity**.
**Natural transformation** leads to **mystical truth**,
**Spontaneous unfolding** reveals the **establishment of teachings**.

The *Scriptures* say: *"The good I shall reward with goodness, the wicked I shall also reward with goodness—this is the **virtue of goodness**."*
This illustrates the **Supreme Sovereign’s** **indiscriminate heart**, like that of an **innocent child**.

The *Book* says: *"Not only shall one love one’s own kin, but all under heaven shall be loved as kin. Not only shall one cherish one’s own children, but all under heaven shall be cherished as children."*
This shows how the **Sage** embodies the **Dao**, nurturing the **myriad people** with **benevolent care**.

**Wickedness must not be indulged**, **goodness must not be obstructed**—justice and punishment should be **applied to distinguish them**.

The *Scriptures* say: *"What is the point of abandoning those who do evil?"*
Thus, the **Sage** establishes the **Son of Heaven** and appoints the **Three Exalted Ministers**.
This is how the **Sage** teaches the people to **forsake evil and embrace goodness**.

It further says: *"Evil done in the open, let men punish it. Evil done in secret, let **spirits** punish it."*
And again: *"Those who do good attract **virtuous qi**, those who do evil attract **malevolent qi**."*
This is the **Supreme Sovereign’s** **admonition** to **deter wrongdoing and encourage virtue**.

The *Book* says: *"Only the **Heavenly Sovereign** is unchanging—those who do good receive a hundred blessings, those who do evil receive a hundred calamities."*
This is the **Sage’s** **precept**, following the **Heavenly Way** to **bestow fortune upon the virtuous** and **bring ruin to the licentious**.

From this perspective, the **retribution of guilt and fortune** follows like **echoes and shadows**—no deviation, not even by a hair’s breadth. Is it only the **Daoist teachings** that speak of such matters? Or does **Confucian scholarship** also record them, which has been longstanding?

The **Dream of King Wen** about **Du Bo**,
The **Dream of the Duke of Jin** about the **Great Plague**,
The **unjust condemnation of the Duke of Gong’s son**,
The **innocence of Hun Liangfu**,
The **retribution of the transformed swine** upon **Duke Qi of Qi**,
The **reward of binding the grass** for **Wei Shi**,
The **sister’s four steeds** in **Liangxiao’s** **auspicious night**,
And **Zheng Xuan’s** **entanglement with Liu Lan**.

With **unerring pen**, these **truths** are faithfully recorded by **worthy historians**, serving as **mirrors for guilt and fortune** and **measures for good and evil**. How much more so when **accumulated goodness yields surplus fortune**, and **accumulated evil yields surplus calamity**—in the **hidden realm**, there are **ghosts and spirits**; in the **manifest world**, there are **laws and punishments**. This too is a means to **encourage virtue and deter evil**.

**Perfect indeed!** The **Great Dao** does not **slaughter**—the **Supreme Sovereign** cherishes **life**. There is no **blame for the sacrificial ox or dog**, yet their **retribution** is demonstrated. Through **ritual arrangements** and **sacred symbols**, there is **authority to uphold**. With **authentic scriptures** and **miraculous precepts**, there is **protection to guard**. If any dare to **violate or insult**, they shall **certainly incur guilt and blame**. Thus, across the ages, **manifestations of efficacy abound**.

The **Lizhi of Chengji’s** *Records of Daoist Efficacy in Twenty Volumes*,
And **Su Huaiqing’s** *Records of Mystic Efficacy from Shiping* in **ten volumes**,
Both circulate in the world.

Now, consulting the **elders**, I gather their **eyewitness accounts** and compile *Records of Daoist Efficacy*, **twenty volumes** in total. May this **broaden the admonitions of caution**, **enhance the path to virtuous deeds**, and, though **plain in prose**, **faithfully record** these **matters**.

**#1** *"Composed by Emperor Huizong of Song"* is rendered as *"Composed by Emperor Zhenzong of Song"* in the *Yunji Seven Signs*; *"preface"* in the **collected editions**, **Siku Quanshu**, and *Essentials Compiled* is rendered as *"sequel"*.

**#2** *"Du Guangting’s Composition"* is rendered as *"Preface by Guangcheng Master"* in the *Yunji Seven Signs*; *"sequel"* in the **collected editions**, **Siku Quanshu**, and *Essentials Compiled* is rendered as *"preface"*.

**Records of Daoist Efficacy, Volume One**
**Guangcheng Master Du Guangting**
**Manifestations of Efficacy in Temples and Palaces**
**Verification of the Kuaizhou Opening Yuan Temple #1**

「The **Kuaizhou Opening Yuan Temple** in **Guangcheng Master Du Guangting’s Records of Daoist Efficacy**, once situated north of **Lake Water**, a mere one or two *li* from the city walls#2, boasted towering halls and layered pavilions, with winding corridors and spacious eaves. It cradled a water pavilion by the lake and an empty pavilion along the pine path, where pines and bamboos stood dense yet sparse, and flowers and trees flourished in beauty. It was the premier retreat for the county folk seeking respite from summer heat or spring’s blossoms.

Later, as Daoist practitioners dwindled and the halls fell into disrepair, only the **Shangqing Pavilion’s** grand hall and the three gates of the **vegetarian hall** remained intact within the precincts. Many commoners buried their dead in the temple grounds#3, and beyond the altar halls, the land became a desolate graveyard. In the second year of the **Dazhong era**, the county heard at night the voices of thousands—resounding like wind and thunder. By dawn, the **Opening Yuan Hall’s** main gate and side chambers, numbering over forty, were found relocated south of **Lake Water**, within the flat terrain, their arrangement and proportions mirroring the old temple’s layout#4. The prefect reported this to the court, requesting a name change to honor the divine marvel. By imperial decree, the temple retained its original name, **Opening Yuan**, but the **Shangqing Pavilion** was renamed **Shenyun Pavilion**, with an order to revere and restore it. Pilgrims from afar flocked in devotion, vying to build fine halls and donate treasures, thus prompting the temple’s renovation and rebirth. The record states: *"The site of its relocation lay beyond two li of path, across one lake of water—achieved by divine power, wrought through sacred influence."*

**Manifestations of Efficacy at the Northern Encounter Mountain Laozi Temple**
The **Northern Encounter Mountain Laozi Temple** in **Xingyuan** was the place where the **Master** [Du Guangting] first took inspiration#5, lying between the county of **Xingyuan** and **Nanzheng**, separated by the river. Since antiquity, it was said to have existed, as the site where **Laozi** manifested his teachings. *"The Han Emperor’s [Liu Bang] expedition began from this temple in Hanzhong. As he prepared to subdue the scattered passes and pacify the Three Qin regions, he dispatched officials to make offerings. Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Left, left his inscription there, though it has since worn away by time."* The **Zhennan General**, governor of the **Liang** and **Yi** prefectures, **Zhang Ru** governed **Hanchuan**, practicing the **Zhengyi** Daoist method#6. He constructed a separate hall for worship, erected an altar and pavilion, and built a grand chamber overlooking **Laozi’s** sacred spring. Beneath the spring dwelled a divine dragon, which had long been its guardian, and through the ages, its efficacy and responses were ever manifest.

After **Taishi Yang Shouliang** lost the region, he returned to **Liangcheng**, where his official residence had been mostly burned. He ordered the collection of tiles and timber to rebuild his halls, and a clerk proposed taking the materials from the **Laozi Temple** to meet the needs. Officials were dispatched to destroy the temple, but the local villagers petitioned, offering to pay the full cost of the tiles and timber to redeem the temple. Some claimed the temple’s structures had stood for too long, the materials rotted and unfit for use. Yet the officials refused and commanded the workers to proceed. Suddenly, a colossal serpent, over ten *zhang* in length, reared up and coiled upon the roof, its mouth gaping toward them. The officials and laborers fell in terror, with several perishing, and fled in haste. Enraged, **Taishi Yang** ordered the temple burned.»

The soldiers beat their drums and clamored as they advanced, but when the villagers spoke of its spirit, they too halted and would not proceed, retreating a hundred *bu* from the temple.

Swift thunder and crackling lightning struck, followed by torrential rain pouring down like buckets. The soldiers, terrified and cowed, withdrew.

The temple remains intact today.

The **Yángzhōu Temple** has long been renowned for its miraculous efficacy.#
The **Yángzhōu Temple** has long been said to be where the Han Emperor Wudi enshrined the spirit of **Sùlíng Furen** (the Divine Lady of the White Constellation) in the **True Inner Palace**, and before the **Tai Bai** (Great White), a palace was constructed at that very site.

Over time, its ruins faded, leaving only traces behind.#
When our **Tang Emperor Gaozu** arrived in **Chang’an**, he received the **Sui Emperor Gong’s** abdication, and in that year, he dreamed of a **divine figure in white robes** who declared: *"I am the lord of Tai Bai, dwelling in the Sùlíng Platform. Your neglect and ruin are my lament."* Thus, he visited the site and specially built the platform and halls, naming it the **Sùlíng Temple**.

During the **Kāiyuán era**, it was recorded that the **Celestial Master** (天师) had once been dispatched by the emperor, who performed fasting and **ritual expiations** (斋醮) there.

When **Emperor Dezong** visited **Liángyáng**, he intended to travel to that site and further embellish it.

Because of this, the labor of gathering materials and stones was most arduous, and he entrusted his son to oversee it. He then wished to destroy the **Sùlíng Temple’s** halls and structures to rebuild the **public offices**.

「When the workers began to lift the tiles, they found countless venomous snakes dwelling within the eaves, with no way to count them, leaving them powerless and unable to proceed. They reported this to the emperor.

Fengzi was enraged and ordered officials to burn the site. As they dragged firewood to kindle the flames, thunder and lightning shook violently, and torrential winds and rains descended. The officials fled in terror, with many perishing in the chaos. The divine traces then returned, and none dared disturb them again.

**The Manifest Virtue Observatories of the Upper Capital: Confirmation of Divine Power**

The **Manifest Virtue Observatory** (昭成观) of the Upper Capital was established by Emperor Xuanzong for his mother, **Empress Zhao Cheng**. It stood in the **Bianzheng District**, south of **Tongfang Alley**, north of **Anfu Gate Street**, facing the **Golden Immortal Observatory** (金仙观). Within its halls, there was a hundred-foot-tall statue of **Laojun** (Lord Lao), seated atop a tiered pavilion, its legs folded to thirty feet in height. The statue was adorned with intricate embroidered garments, all crafted by the brush of **Huaidaozi** (昊道子), **Wang Xianqiao** (王仙乔), and **Yang Tuizhi** (杨退之) in person.

The emperor commanded all Daoist institutions to send **Xiao Miao** (萧邈), styled **Xuan Su** (玄俗), as the overseer to manage its affairs. The pavilion’s eaves were lofty, eight feet high, with both sides extending over thirty feet above the ground. Among the capital’s Daoist halls, its grandeur surpassed all but the **Playen Observatory’s** (玄都观) main hall.

When **Emperor Xizong** returned to Chang’an, he led his grand procession back to the palace. The officials in charge planned to construct new **government offices** (衙殿) but spared the original foundations to avoid burdening the people. They proposed dismantling the tallest halls and relocating their materials. The officials petitioned to demolish this very pavilion and the tiered structure, but as workers began to topple them, over ten men fell and died. At the time, this was seen as a divine omen, and they sought to exempt the site from destruction. Yet the demolition continued, leaving the statue exposed to wind and rain. That winter, the emperor also visited **Chencom** (陈仓), but the **imperial decree** (含元之制) had already been rescinded. Those who understood the signs lamented and pitied the scene.

**The Manifest Primordial Observatory of Qingcheng Mountain: Confirmation of Divine Power**

The **Manifest Primordial Observatory** (宗玄观) of Qingcheng Mountain was an ancient Daoist observatory. Originally located before the **Yellow Emperor’s Reception Platform** (黄帝受录坛) and beside the **Six Seasons Rock** (六时岩), it was later encroached upon by Buddhist monks, who relocated it outside the mountain. The site was then turned into the **Feiyu Temple** (飞赴寺), but the monks faced constant disturbances from divine figures—sometimes stones were hurled to destroy the halls, or doors and windows were flung into the ravine below. The temple’s massive bell was cast into the valley three times; each retrieval required immense labor and resources. The monks recognized their inability to dwell there and often suffered in silence.

In the **19th year of the Kaiyuan era**, the Daoist **Wang Xianqing** (王仙卿) petitioned to move the observatory back to its original site outside the mountain. The emperor granted the request and ordered **Zhang Jingzhong** (张敬忠), the governor of **Yibin Prefecture** (益州), along with the Daoist **Wang Xianqing** and high-ranking official **Wang Huaisu** (王怀景), to oversee the relocation. He also bestowed statues of the **Golden Immortal** (金仙) and **Jade Purity** (玉真) princesses in stone form to be enshrined within, along with the **Yellow Emperor’s Sacred Script Banner** (黄帝真文幢), the **Inscription Tablet of the Dark Dao Peak** (阴道山文碣), and the **Imperial Edict Stele** (手诏碑), all erected at the observatory site. From then on, Daoists resided there, and even a solitary individual felt no fear.

By the end of the **Chantong era**, the Daoists had abandoned the site, and the observatory fell into ruin, leaving only the hallowed halls and stone platforms intact. Towering bamboo clumps arched over the foundations, encroaching upon the stairs and eaves. Two monks came to dwell within, intending to relocate the observatory to the **Feiyu Temple** again. After a month of planning, they prepared to demolish the statues and structures and seize the land.

Yet from that point, when the monks slept at night, a giant serpent would coil across their stomachs. During meals, flying sand would strike their food. Sometimes they saw vast hands like baskets, with clawed feet like pillars, or heard deep, resonant roars echoing from the valley. At other times, great stones would plummet from the sky before their dwellings. The two monks fled in terror and abandoned the place.

In the **year Jihai of the Qiansuo era**, **County Magistrate Cui Zhenggui** (崔正规) and the Daoist **Zhang Suchao** (张素卿) restored the observatory. When the emperor traveled to **Western Shu** (西蜀), they petitioned to rename it the **Manifest Primordial Observatory** (宗玄观), as decreed. During the renovations, divine lanterns illuminated the mountain, the sacred bell rang on its own, golden serpents appeared upon the altar, and withered pines regrew before the hall. The emperor issued a personal edict praising its virtues, and the events were inscribed in the **national histories** (国史) and the **Stele of the Shu Expedition** (幸蜀碑).

Whenever Daoist rituals were performed on auspicious nights, celestial chimes would resound in the air. If the regional military governors offered **dragon incense** (投龙), clouds would gather in the forest like coiling serpents. Truly, this is a hidden realm of the Daoist immortals—how could ordinary mortals dare to intrude?

**Confirmation of Divine Power at the Wenchu Platform in the Southern Suburbs**

**Wenchu** (文铢) was a man from Chang’an. His parents commanded him to study in their country estate’s **scholarly hall** (书堂), built atop a mound of earth before the **garden**. Yet Wenchu was naturally carefree, taking no joy in letters. Instead, he amused himself with local youths by shooting **flying birds** (飞乌) with slings and hunting wild beasts with snares.

As for **books and writing implements** (荃苟之具), **silks and fine fabrics** (蔚罗之属), **traps and nets** (弋网), and **bows, arrows, clubs, and blades** (弓矢槌刃), he discarded them all without hesitation. Over several years, his slaughter and capture were beyond count.

One day, a Daoist saw him and said: *"Why has your head changed so suddenly?"* Wenchu, startled, asked what he meant. The Daoist led him to the platform’s base and ordered him to peer into a well and observe his reflection. Wenchu saw his own human form but with a beast’s head.

Seeking forgiveness, he begged the Daoist to look again, and this time, he watched closely. In a mere instant, his body remained unchanged, but his head transformed a hundred times—into birds, beasts, serpents, or fish. Wenchu was filled with dread.

The Daoist said: *"All living things struggle for existence, each clinging fiercely to its life. Even those that fly or move swiftly hold their vitality dear. You have defied the Dao and killed them, so this retribution is just. Each transformation of your head corresponds to a life you took; you will suffer for every creature you slaughtered, day after day, until your lifespan is exhausted. Then, your body will die. Afterward, you will wander among the strange forms of life, repaying the lives you stole, for countless millennia—never returning to human form."*

Wenchu wept bitterly, pleading for salvation. He vowed to burn all his hunting tools and repent for his past sins, promising to purify his heart and never offend again. Seeing his sincerity, the Daoist said: *"I am entrusted by the **Most High** (太上) to rescue suffering beings, known as the **Saviour of Suffering** (救苦真人)."*」

「Yet you had a past green with virtue, early destined to meet the Dao. If not saved now, you would sink into ruin without end.

The Daoist then gave him his own robe, commanding him to devote his life to cultivating the Dao, performing hidden deeds to save the world, and broadly extending aid to all living beings—only then would his past sins be forgiven. The Daoist immediately leapt to his feet, rising several zhang above the ground, standing upon a golden lotus flower. In his left hand, he held a jade cup, and in his right, a willow branch. His golden crown and phoenix sandals gleamed as his body towered over three zhang, his entire form radiating five-colored light that ascended to the heavens, illuminating an entire river valley. Then, he vanished.

Wenchu burned his hunting nets and tools, donned the Daoist’s robe, and at that very spot, erected a hall and fashioned the likeness of what he had seen. Day and night, he diligently practiced, burning incense and repenting his sins.

After more than a decade, he was granted a divine prescription by a true immortal, allowing him to wander across the lands, easing the suffering of the people.

Later, he attained the Dao and departed. The place where he dwelled is still called Wenchu Terrace, and the image of the Saviour of Suffering remains.

Suddenly, a group of monks came wandering and saw it, saying: *"Since this is Wenchu’s holy relic, why does it bear the merit of a Daoist? For many years now, Daoists have been unworthy, encroaching upon our ancient site!"* They uprooted a great tree, and two monks struck its trunk together, yet could not harm it, straining with great effort. After a brief rest, they examined the spots where the Daoist image had been struck—all were healed as before. But when they looked at their own hands, they too were broken. Crawling in agony, they wailed to the crowd, recounting their ordeal, and soon afterward, both died.

**Recorded at the Purple Star Pavilion in Shu Prefecture**
In Shu Prefecture’s Tangxing County, the Datong Observatory holds a Purple Star Pavilion, constructed in the Kaiyuan era by Daoist Cai Shouchong using imperial silk. Over time, its corridors, halls, and gates crumbled, yet this pavilion endured. In the Zhonghe era, bandits ravaged the county, and the villager Luo Sheng and his son, known for their brutality, suddenly set the pavilion ablaze. All lamented its loss, none having the leisure to save it.

When the bandits were dispersed, people gathered at the pavilion’s foundation to celebrate, offering feasts and vows in its honor.»

During the time of the **Daoist ritual** (法事), Luo’s father and son devoured their food in the midst of the crowd, yet there were those who pitied them and attempted to rescue them. Suddenly, a man spoke to them, saying: *"In this time of peril and chaos, you could not even flee to save your own lives, yet you recklessly burned this pavilion. It required immense labor to construct, and it stood as an ancient monument for many years. You destroyed it in a single day—do you not fear the wrath of the **celestial principles** (神理), and yet dare to beg here?"*

As soon as this man finished speaking, the father and son leapt up more than ten feet, crashing to the ground. This happened five or six times, with their cries of agony growing louder before they finally expired. When the crowd looked upon them, their flesh and bones had scattered.

**Recorded at the Qingyang Hall in Chengdu**
The Qingyang Hall (青羊宫) was established by imperial decree in the **Zhonghe era** (中和), in the year **Renyin** (壬寅). In the **Jiyou year** (己酉), during the **fifth month** (噶月), it was again surrounded by flames, and its halls, gates, and altars were utterly consumed. At that time, even the outer buildings were being burned and demolished, and there was a massive **brocade** (巨袱) within the hall—a single piece requiring the strength of ten men to drag.

Suddenly, a **temple guard** (官健) declared: *"I alone can lift it!"*
The crowd laughed at him.
Yet he truly managed to carry it into the city. When someone asked him why he had purchased it, he replied: *"This material is too precious to waste. I intend to place it in the **Yanzhen Hall** (严真观)."*
The other answered: *"Better to use it as firewood for the Daoists—what good would it do there?"*
So he seized an axe and struck it down. Just as the blade descended, he felt a sharp pain in his arm. He dropped the axe to the ground and died within moments.

The neighbors who had come to take wood said: *"The Qingyang Laozi Hall, which the crowd did not wish to demolish, was ordered by this temple guard to be dismantled first. At first, a great serpent emerged from beneath the seat, which he had already pulled and killed. The revered image of the deity was also damaged by him. This strange death was surely caused by divine retribution. Though he was in his prime, who could have harmed him? The crowd marveled at this wonder. The brocade remained there for years, but later its fate became unknown."*

**Records of the Taicheng Palace in Boyou County, Boyou Prefecture**
The Taicheng Palace in Boyou’s Zhiyuan County was the birthplace where the Holy Ancestor Laozi descended. From the Shang and Zhou dynasties through the Tang, the Nine Wells and Three Ancient Cypresses remained intact. During the Wude era, the ancient cypresses regrew. In the Tianbao era, the palace halls were rebuilt.

Its ancient ruins were first restored and adorned by Emperor Xuan of Han and Emperor Huan of Han. Emperor Taizu of Wei and Emperor Wen of Sui later expanded its design. Bian Shao and Xue Daoheng inscribed steles to record these deeds.

The sacred portraits of the Six Holy Emperors—Tang Gaozu, Taizong, Gaozong, Zhongzong, Ruizong, and Minghuang—stood in attendance beside Laozi. The two palaces and two halls housed over a thousand ancient cypresses, seven hundred halls, and five hundred soldiers to guard the grounds.

During the reign of Emperor Xiantong, Pang Xun seized Xu Prefecture. The imperial armies from the Ten Circuits gathered to suppress him, and the siege was nearly complete. Pang Xun, fearing he could not endure the prolonged assault, led three thousand followers directly to the palace, intending to seize it as a stronghold.

On that day, over a thousand families fleeing the chaos took refuge within the palace. Black vapors rose from the wells, and soon a dense mist enveloped the valley. Laozi appeared in the sky, and Pang Xun’s forces lost their way, trampling one another. The wooden bridge collapsed, and they all drowned in the water. When the siege lifted, not a single rebel remained.

During the Guangming era, Huang Chao led his followers, intending to burn the palace. Again, black mist filled the valley, and they lost their way. Later, bandits also surrounded the palace, intending to destroy it, but they too became disoriented and wandered off.

As the rebels besieged Boyou City, their assault grew more desperate. The prefect, Pan Chao, burned incense before the palace, praying for divine aid. Soon, black mist emerged from the palace and swirled around the city walls. A foul wind and toxic vapors struck those who inhaled them, causing them to collapse. Heavy snow fell unnaturally, and fifteen or sixteen out of every ten died.

When the attack first began, countless divine soldiers were seen carrying arrows, which they hurled to the ground. The rebels were already astonished. Then, the city’s skies cleared, while outside, the wind and snow killed men. Fearing the divine power, they lifted the siege and fled. Soon after, they dispersed entirely.

Pan Chao reported: *"Since the great rebellion began at the Pass, and the successive waves of bandits and rebels—eighteen in total—have sought to attack the Taicheng Palace, some were lost on the way, others saw divine apparitions, and all failed in their schemes. The palace and city remain unharmed, and the number of lives it has sheltered is beyond count."* He requested that Zhiyuan County be relocated to the palace grounds.

**Response:** *"If the county is moved to the palace, it will surely become defiled."* The county remained in its original location, and in accordance with the precedent of the Wan Nian era, it was elevated to the rank of a Red County. A decree was issued to purify the grounds and hold rituals of thanksgiving.

**Records of the Mengjin Observatory in Changming County**
The Mengjin Observatory in Changming County, Mian Prefecture, stood outside the city walls atop a mountain overlooking the river. Its halls and pavilions were grand and towering, commanding a view of the long river below and the scattered wells. It was indeed a place of scenic splendor within the county.

After the Taishou, Prince of Pingyang, had pacified the Eastern Circuit, he established his command there and burned the observatory to the ground. Later, the governor’s office stood empty, and though repairs were needed, the officials did not wish to burden the people with labor. The garrison commander of Changming, Baosheng, submitted a petition stating: *"The Mengjin Observatory lies across the river from the county, where few Daoists reside. It overlooks the waterway, and boats and rafts can easily reach it. I request permission to dismantle the halls and pavilions, using the timber to construct rafts for transport, which would serve the military needs."*

The Taishou hesitated but did not refuse. The commissioner for construction also argued that the situation was urgent and that borrowing the governor’s forces would expedite the work. Permission was granted.

Baosheng led skilled laborers to demolish eighteen halls and pavilions from the observatory, transporting the timber by raft along the river. Within the tiles of the main hall and the Five Saints Pavilion, poisonous serpents were found—no one could touch them. That day, Baosheng felt pain in his knees, as if stricken by *hu feng* (tiger wind). Within ten days, his leg rotted and fell away.

When the Taishou learned of this, he ordered the wood sent to the Kaiyuan Observatory in the northern city—but it was never used.

Thus concludes **Volume One of the Records of Daoist Miraculous Manifestations**.

**Volume Two of the Records of Daoist Miraculous Manifestations**
*Collected by Master Guangcheng Du Guangting*
**Temples and Their Manifestations**

**#1: The Foundation of Master Zhou’s Scripture Hall**
Master Zhou, surnamed Taixuan, was a disciple of Tao Yuan, the Hermit of Tao. At twenty-one years of age, he attained the Dao#2 and first received his rank from the Hermit. His dwelling was the present Zisun Observatory. It stood before the Maoling Ridge, upon a level plain of pristine purity—truly a blessed site. Beside the hall, a patch of ground rose slightly, like the foundation of an old house, yet without any traces of carts or human labor. Taixuan planted flowers and trees upon it.

At times, one would see figures there—tall-hatted, in loose robes, appearing in groups of two or three. There were also armored warriors of celestial gold. On quiet moonlit nights, they would stand in attendance upon its history.

**#1: The Foundation of Master Zhou’s Scripture Hall**

**#3: The Miraculous Platform of Lady Wei of Nan Yue**
Lady Wei’s platform stands before the central peak of Nan Yue, atop a massive stone—one slab measuring over a *zhang* in width, its shape square and stable below, rounded and level above, floating upon other rocks. Once, a single person attempted to push it, and it seemed to shift slightly, but when many gathered, it stood firm and unmoving.

Rumored to be a divine marvel, it was often visited by immortals and recluses, where strange clouds and spiritual *qi* would envelop its summit. Suddenly, a dozen robed monks, bearing torches and staffs, arrived at the platform in the night, intending to harm the waiting Celestial Maiden.

They entered her dwelling, but the Celestial Maiden was nowhere to be seen upon her bed. The monks then returned to the platform, where they pushed and toppled Lady Wei’s stone, a great crash echoing like a fall. When they turned their torches upon it, the stone could not be moved again.

Realizing its power, they fled in terror. By dawn, a villager from a distant hamlet—no more than ten *li* away—had arrived with nine companions. All ten shared the same resolve, but nine were devoured by tigers. The lone survivor, who had pushed the stone and not joined their wicked intent, escaped harm.

He reported the incident to the villagers, and the tale spread, astonishing all who heard it far and near.

**#4: The Iron Pillar Miracle of Hongzhou**
The Iron Pillar of Hongzhou was forged by the immortal Master Xu, at his teacher Master Hao’s behest. In the Jin Dynasty, the region of Yuzhang suffered from monstrous twisters, towering serpents, and water beasts that ravaged the people. Master Xu and his teacher summoned the *Zhengyi*#2 guardians—those who wield the Dao of slaying demons with three strikes and five steps—commanding them to subdue all spirits.

From a well in Changzhou, Master Xu drew his sword and chased the dragon, driving it forth from the well. He declared to his teacher: *“Beneath this well, the dragon’s lair lies. If we do not suppress it, every three hundred years it will plague the people again. Who will restrain it then?”*

He compelled the spirits to gather iron weighing hundreds of *wànjīn*, casting it into the well. The molten iron overflowed several *chi* beyond, standing firm as a pillar. Beneath the well, he laid eight massive chains to bind the earth’s *mài*#5.

From that day onward, the lands of Zhongling knew no demonic disturbances or drowning disasters. He swore: *“Should any future generation harm my pillar, the city walls will collapse, and the rivers will flood without restraint.”* All knew this, and none dared violate it.

Yet, a fisherman once struck the pillar’s iron with his rod to sink his nets, damaging it greatly. Even now, the authorities forbid such acts. When Governor Yan Ji of Jiangxi, believing slanderous reports, ordered men to dig up the Iron Pillar and shatter it, a sudden thunderous strike sent the waters surging. Before they had dug even two or three *chi*, the earth trembled, the city walls shook, and all within were stricken with fear.

The governor, now convinced of its power, burned incense in gratitude and ceased. The Daoist temple beside the pillar, which had once been destroyed, was rebuilt anew. The miracles of the **Hongzhou Iron Pillar** and the **Nan Yue Lady Wei’s Platform** endure.

The **Guangzhou Jùpú Observatory** was where Master Anqi cultivated his Daoist arts, where the elixir-granting well and the sacred pine by Lingxi Stream stood as the finest sights for the region’s visitors. Though an ancient observatory once stood there, time wore it down, and monks seized the site to establish a Zen monastery. Though many lived together, strange terrors plagued them—when not haunted by fear, they were embroiled in disputes, beatings, and even killings.

An old man passing through warned the monks: *"This is a Daoist hall, a sacred site of the Way. Though you guard it, you are not of its kind. If you do not leave, beasts like tigers and wolves will come as calamity, devouring you."* They scoffed. Yet within a decade, the tigers grew bolder, mauling over ten people before the monks, trembling, fled in silence.

The *jinshi* scholar Xu Sanwei once inscribed a seven-character couplet on the wall:
*"Originally the place where Anqi burned his elixirs,
Now a Zen hall where the Dharma is seated."*

The monks’ chanting filled the moonlit halls,
While the deep valley’s monkeys howled in the midnight wind.
The golden bell’s echoes faded in the distant pine pavilion,
As drifting clouds dissolved, leaving the sea and mountains bare.

*"I came seeking the Daoist adept in cultivation,
Yet only found the distant Master’s True Suchness."*

When Governor Zheng Qu, the military commissioner, visited the monastery—now eerily empty—he heard tales of the beasts and the old man’s warning. Seeing the poem, he sighed: *"This too is where the sages tread. How could one not be moved?"* He then petitioned the court, restoring the **Jùpú Observatory**.

**Chéngdū Qīngyáng Market’s Verification**
The **Chéngdū Qīngyáng Market** lies beyond Zhèngjiàn Ward and Luochéng, marking the place where the Celestial Worthy Laozi, parting from Yīnxí at Mount Zhōngnán before journeying to Liúshā, had agreed to meet again. That year, Laozi ascended from the Scripture Hall to the Taiwei constellation, while Yīnxí, after a thousand days of practice, attained his Dao and entered Shu. Seeking Laozi, he found him at the Qīngyáng Market.

Long abandoned and frozen, the site had never been restored. Though the Daoist teachings were well-documented, none had the means to reclaim it—so the land remained in the hands of local residents.

「But there stood a thousand-year-old ancient pine, towering over ten *zhang* in height, with a trunk three to four *chǐ* in diameter, and amidst the towering bamboo and desolate ruins, it yet endured in vitality.

At that time, a commoner named Yáng Méi, who carried goods for trade at the market, purchased the land to dwell upon. The neighbors all said: "Beneath the great pine and within the bamboo grove, one must not defile or profane this place," and Méi thus always revered and guarded it.

One evening, as Méi returned from the market, he entered the bamboo grove and encountered an old man, who told Méi: "This is a sacred site, and for ten years now, no one has restored it. You too cannot stay long, for I intend to establish a temple here, where travelers may rest and wander. You may undertake this work for me."

Méi replied: "I lack the means and strength."
Using his poverty as an excuse, he declined.

The old man pointed with his staff to the ground and said: "Beneath this earth lies gold. You may take it to build my dwelling—a hall with layered eaves and intricate railings—ensuring all is complete and well-crafted. I will repay you for your devotion."

When the work was finished, Méi relocated to another district, cautioning him not to speak of it to others. Méi was delighted by the old man’s words, took the marked land, but forgot to ask his name or lineage. By the time he sought to inquire further, the old man had vanished. Méi only called him *Lóngshén* (Dragon God), unaware that this was a sacred site of the Daoist tradition.

Digging three to four *chǐ* deep, he uncovered a porcelain jar, which he covered with a wooden cart. Inside were three or four tens of *liǎng* of gold.

Méi hid the gold and placed the jar beneath the ancient pine. He then gathered materials and tiles to construct a sixteen-pillar celestial temple. Beneath it, he laid carts across the ground, arranged them in a pattern like a *dòuqí* (board game), and built the hall’s eaves and railings with meticulous precision, adhering strictly to the design.

Within the temple, one wall he dared not depict with any image or form—only smearing it with charcoal and ash, and offering incense and a table for reverence.

The work completed, Méi moved his family to Pēngzhōu, where he sold wine for a living, growing ever wealthier.

In the spring of *Bǐngshēn* (the year of the third application of the *shēn* stem), he sold the land to the *Dùzhīyuàn* (Degree and Transport Office) official Chén Píngshì. I visited Chén to inquire about the land and found that the temple already stood there; he recounted the tale to me.

Within two years, Chén accompanied the Chancellor Gāo Yàn as they traveled to Jiānglíng, and the land fell under the jurisdiction of the military officer Lán Zhào.

In the year *Xīnchǒu* (the year of the second application of the *chǒu* stem), the Imperial procession arrived in Shu. In the eighth month of the year *Rényín* (the year of the first application of the *yín* stem), there was a miraculous sign—a wooden cart appeared—and on the twelfth day of the ninth month, by imperial decree, the *Qīngyáng Temple* was established, with 200,000 coins granted to redeem the land. A total of 1,800 *guàn* (strings of cash) were allocated for the construction of the temple’s buildings.

The Imperial procession visited the temple three times. From the spring of *Bǐngshēn* until now, it has been but seven years, and the signs of its veracity are now manifest.

At that time, the *Ràng* (recluse) monk Lǐ Tèlì and the Daoist priest Lǐ Wúwéi, observing a nighttime crimson light like a glowing bead, leaping upon the ground, dug at the spot where it vanished and unearthed an ancient wooden cart. Upon it were six characters in ancient script: *Tàishàng Píng Zhōnghé Zāi* (The Celestial Worthy pacifies calamities and brings harmony). The regional military commander and attendant minister Chén Jìngyì, along with the on-site commander of the military escort Tiān Lìngzǐ, presented it to the court in a memorial, which was then announced to all officials. The characters were copied and inscribed, and the cart was granted to the military forces.

Lǐ Tèlì was bestowed the title of *Páishòu* (a Daoist rank) and appointed as *Tàizǐ Jiàoshū* (Grand Scribe of the Prince) and magistrate of *Lóngzhōu* (Dragon Prefecture) in Jiāngyóu (Jiangyou). Lǐ Wúwéi was granted *zǐ* (purple) robes, with the amount of *chǐ* (fabric) varying according to rank.»

From that time onward, the following year saw the restoration of the imperial palace, and the year after that, the suppression of Huang Chao. In the year *yǐsì* (11th year of the reign period), the imperial procession returned to the capital.

Thus, it was clear that the Celestial Worthy, the Mysterious Ancestor, had indeed fulfilled his role as the holy descendant who pacified rebellions and calmed calamities.

In the case of the *Lóngxīng Guàn* (Dragon Ascension Hall) in Yìzhōu (Yizhou), which was later known as the *Zhìzhēn Guàn* (Hall of Perfect Truth) under the Later Zhou, its foundations were vast and encompassed by streets on all four sides. Only the main hall, lecture hall, and the *Yùhuá Gōng* (Jade Flower Palace) stele remained intact. There was a man named Wáng Fēng who served the Prince of Yǐngchuān (Yingchuan). He established a private residence in the *Xiǎo Mán Fāng* (Little Man Ward), but as the land was low and damp, he ordered laborers to excavate the earth from the hall’s walls and foundations, hauling away thousands of cartloads of soil to raise the ground. Before the construction was complete, several workers had already perished.

One day, as Wáng Fēng returned home from his official duties, he saw two men in yellow robes outside his gate who said: *"For the matter of taking soil from the hall, there must be an accounting."* Before he could respond, he collapsed and died.

Within the hall stood a bell tower called *Rì Língxiǎng* (Daily Resounding), with a grand and imposing gatehouse of exquisite craftsmanship. The military governor Huò Xínglǔ had it dismantled and relocated to the *Tiānwáng Sì* (Heavenly King Temple), destroying its remaining beauty.

In recent years, when the emperor was in Shu, the *Míngdào Dàshī* (Master of Bright Dao) Yǐn Sìxuán reported: *"Huò Xínglǔ, stricken by illness, descended into the underworld. After several days, he revived and recounted how he had been driven by ghostly officials to transport the timber of Lóngxīng Guàn. Chained in iron shackles, he was forced to carry and drag the wood day and night without rest. When the load was nearly complete, the timber would suddenly fly away, and this torment continued endlessly—he did not know when it would ever cease. He begged for his descendants to rebuild the hall’s gatehouse to redeem his sins, but his descendants were too poor to do so."*

The *Jìngfú Shān* (Serene Blessing Mountain) boundary verification followed.

The **Jìngfú Shān** observatory in Liánzhōu was the place where the immortal Liáo Chōng attained the Dao. Its dwelling faced a small stream, with strange rock formations and rare trees, making it a place of profound seclusion and beauty. His grandson, Liáo Shénjiǎo, inherited the estate and maintained it with unwavering piety, earning respect from the region.

Soon, a monk nearby established a monastery, encroaching upon the observatory’s land to build a granary and storehouses. Liáo Shénjiǎo filed a complaint, and the prefectural officials were dispatched to verify the boundary. The monk stubbornly refused, even attempting to further seize the observatory’s land. His arguments were convoluted, leaving the officials unable to resolve the matter.

Suddenly, during a gathering to deliberate, a violent storm erupted—thunder and lightning shattered the stone pillars, splitting the earth and clearly demarcating the boundaries. The granary and storehouses were revealed to lie within the observatory’s original land. That very night, a fierce tiger roared, devouring trees and grass, clawing the ground to mark its territory, and distinctly separating the monk’s domain. Magistrate Jiǎng Fáng erected a stele to record the event.

**Verification of the Eastern Clarity Observatory’s Land by Liú the General**
Liú the General, a soldier under the Right Divine Strategy Army, resided near the Eastern Clarity Observatory. He undertook extensive construction of his estate, excavating soil from within the observatory to build foundations and moats, transporting thousands of cartloads. After completing the work, Liú fell gravely ill, his condition worsening over a decade. He grew increasingly agitated, clawing at the earth in his courtyard, bleeding from his nails, yet never ceasing. His family restrained him, but he would soon collapse, burrowing into the soil as if driven by unseen forces. They heard sounds of violent blows and cries of pain, yet he could only weep and sob in response. When questioned, he gave no answer.

After more than a month, his condition worsened, and all medical treatments failed. Desperate, his family summoned a blind diviner, who advised seeking Daoist salvation. Though Liú had never believed in Daoist practices, his wife and children, in their grief, visited the Golden Immortal Observatory and requested a talisman. A talisman was placed before him, and Daoist incantations were burned, with the ashes mixed into water for him to drink. Liú then spoke:

*"Through my ignorance, I violated the Dao’s laws, taking soil from the Eastern Clarity Observatory to build my private residence. The earthly officials have already reported this to the celestial court. I am ordered to repay the soil in kind, but I cannot calculate the number of carts. Even if I labor alone, it would take two or three hundred years to complete—yet I fear it will never suffice. If I delay or slacken, the officials will punish me severely, with no end to the torment."* He wept and wailed as he spoke, and his family, hearing this, mourned deeply.

His wife and children then went to the Eastern Clarity Hall, burning incense and pleading for mercy. They purchased five thousand cartloads of cold soil to fill the excavated pit, held a vegetarian feast in gratitude, and begged for pardon. Liú’s condition briefly stabilized. The next morning, he spoke again:

*"The celestial edict decrees that, though I have repaid the soil, my offense remains unatoned. My twelve years of fate and merit have been forfeited, and my descendants are implicated—but they may be spared."* That very night, he died.

I note, according to Daoist doctrine, that those who deliberately desecrate great Daoist sites or sacred precincts suffer retribution across three lifetimes. Yet Liú, through his initial repayment, confined his punishment to himself—was this not a warning?

**Verification of the Three Elements Observatory’s Foundation in Lèwēn County**
The Three Elements Observatory in Lèwēn County of Língzhōu was established during the Liang and Sòng dynasties. It stood upon a solitary ancient peak, overlooking the riverbank, with a Dragon Pond in front. Its foundation spanned seventy to eighty *mǔ* of land, still bearing stone statues, iron steles, and stone lions, with exquisite craftsmanship unlike ordinary structures.

Li Yìn, a local magistrate’s clerk, claimed the land for his residence, transforming it into a garden where he cultivated onions and garlic for profit. Plagues and misfortunes struck his household, resulting in the deaths and injuries of over ten family members.

The learned recognized that sacred ground should not be defiled, urging him to repent and apologize—he paid no heed.

Soon, the Jiangling Prefecture confiscated the land, establishing a military encampment, erecting walls, and constructing grand halls. The ancient cypresses and noble pines beside the observatory, along with towering trees of fine timber, were all felled. The camp commander, Ma Shu, was particularly ruthless in his logging. Those who dwelled or rested there often felt uneasy, so they slaughtered roosters and invoked ghosts and spirits in vain supplication. Some advised him to protect the statues, cover the merit tablets, and atone—but he ignored them.

Later, he engaged in boat races on the river and drowned. The three subsequent camp commanders all met with misfortune. Now the camp lies abandoned, overgrown with brambles and weeds, its sacred statues in ruins. I have also urged and encouraged the county folk to restore it, ever awaiting virtuous scholars and eminent men to revive this hallowed site and its sacred traces.

The observatory houses a statue of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable One, with inscriptions in the *zhuàn* script and *bāfēn* seal style, engraved upon an iron stele. The stele is three *chǐ* wide and six to seven *chǐ* long, bearing the calligraphy of the *zhòngshū shìlàng* Regü Zishan.

**Verification of the Restoration of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable Temple by Lord Li Fu**
The Chancellor Li Fu, during the first year of the *Xiān’tōng* era, served as governor of the Eastern Capital. His late mother, the *xiáng* Consort of Chu, had vowed to restore the temple, but the project was never completed. Now, as he took up his governorship, he had forgotten his earlier vow.

On the third day of his arrival, he dreamed of seven or eight celestial boys bearing flowers and incense, leading him to a mountain observatory. The path into the mountain seemed deep, but the observatory itself was level ground, with dense cypresses and pines, towering pavilions and halls—just as he had once visited. He entered the hall and saw the Heavenly Venerable’s statue, lifelike and moving as if alive, though it spoke not a word, only nodding in acknowledgment. Li Fu bowed and begged for a single utterance, but the statue remained silent, instead pointing toward the bell tower outside. Following its gesture, he saw the tower was already collapsing.

The next day, he visited the Primordial Heavenly Venerable Temple and found it exactly as in his dream. Upon examining the bell tower, it too appeared crumbling and decayed. He ordered repairs, tearing down the thatched roof and walls, but much was already damaged. Only one beam encircled the structure, entirely lacquered on the outside, untouched—yet when struck, it rang hollow inside. The workers begged to replace it, unwilling to use the old timber. Li Fu commanded them to cut it open, revealing a cavity over a *chǐ* long, containing a square wooden tablet inscribed: *"Mountains and waters have no speech, but in the first year, there is fortune for restoration."* He showed it to all officials and inquired among his subordinates, but none could decipher it.

Li Fu himself interpreted it: *"Mountains and waters have no speech"* refers to the imperial name, *"fortune for restoration"* is my own name. The Sage descended in a dream, pointing to this bell tower—now that it has been repaired, the omen is fulfilled.

**Verification of Lord Wei Ju’s Restoration of the Gejue Temple**
The Prince of Nánkāng, Grand Tutor, and Chancellor Wei Gāo, was the beloved son-in-law of the Chancellor Zhāng, a scion of a long-standing ministerial family, yet his bearing was profound and his stature grand, his demeanor simple yet aloof, untainted by vulgarity. The Zhāng clan, though noble and illustrious, all looked down on Wei, unaware of his worth.

One night, he dreamed of two divine figures who said: *"All the transformations of the world are recorded in the ledgers of humanity. Your name is listed under Gejue, with provisions for all of Shu. Your wealth and honor will soon arrive—why do you linger? Strive forward! In the future, when your fortune comes, do not forget Gejue."* From that moment, Wei harbored ambitions for official advancement.

He consulted his household, and his family urged him on, providing tens of thousands of *lì* in dowry to fund his endeavors.

Upon arriving at Fengxiang, Zhang Yi appointed Wei as a *tuiyuan* (推官). Just then, the governor of Longzhou was vacant, and Wei was entrusted with the administration of the prefecture. Shortly after, Zhu Pi rebelled, and Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian. Zhu Pi sent envoys to appoint Wei as Governor of Longzhou, but Wei beheaded the messengers and sent their heads to the imperial court. By the time the imperial procession reached the frontier garrisons, Wei had already refused to respond to the crisis.

Once Wei’s memorial reached the city, his resolve hardened. The court then appointed him Governor of Longzhou, with concurrent appointment as *Zhongcheng* Inspector (御史中丞), and bestowed upon him the *jinzi* (golden cap) rank. After the rebellion was suppressed, he was recalled to serve as *Jinwu* General (金吾大将军) and later dispatched to govern Xingyuan. He was then reassigned as Military Governor of Western Circuit (西川节度), where he succeeded Zhang Yi in office.

In the years that followed, the Shu region saw great prosperity, with abundant gold and silk accumulating. The Nanzhao kingdom submitted and petitioned to become vassals, their tribute never failing. The court relied heavily upon him, and the frontier tribes submitted in awe. Thus, the court granted Nanzhao’s request. Wei established a *Xídu* Academy (习读院), where he sent hostages and students to study poetry, ritual, and music. His calligraphy and literary compositions were unmatched in his time. The Nanzhao people treasured his handwritten works, carving them into stone as national treasures. Meanwhile, the matter of Gejue had long been forgotten.

Again, he dreamed of the two divine figures, who said: *"To gain wealth and honor yet forget your source—how grave is this!"* Wei awoke in a cold sweat, terrified. After some time, he personally visited Yunlin Temple, burning incense and praying for blessings. He then commissioned craftsmen to measure wood and select auspicious days for construction, building a grand southern pavilion with forty eaves, towering halls, and intricate corridors—all adorned with gold and stone carvings. He diverted the taxes of nine prefectures to build granaries beneath the mountain, where grain was stored in vast piles, and artisans hurried to complete the work. He himself inscribed a stele beside the cave entrance, erected a multi-tiered pavilion, and sacrificed seventy servants to ensure perpetual maintenance. He also allocated five hundred *mu* of fertile land for monastic provisions. After governing the region for over twenty years, he was ennobled as a *wang* (王).

That very year, in the *dingmao* (丁卯) cycle, coinciding with the fulfillment of Gejue’s prophecy, the *Kaiyuan* Temple in Guzhou displayed miraculous signs. The *Kaiyuan* Temple in Guzhou stood near the city walls, its location favored by the landscape’s grandeur. Because of its strategic beauty, it was chosen as the temple’s name. Though the prefectural officials had already submitted their petition, the main hall remained unfinished. The local magistrate then ordered artisans and Daoist adepts to gather along the Jialing River, purchasing timber from upstream merchants in Lizhou.

Before their departure, the artisans and Daoists shared a dream of a voice declaring: *"In the waters of Zhufeng Pond lies wood sufficient for the task."* This dream recurred three times. They gathered and said, *"The omens are clear—there must be a merchant transporting fine timber along the river. We should wait three to five days to intercept him, lest he pass by unnoticed."* One artisan said, *"I will search the waters below Zhufeng Mountain myself—perhaps a merchant’s raft has already arrived."* He went to the mountain’s base and, seeing the pond’s waters unusually clear, spotted wood beneath the surface. He had divers retrieve it, securing a thousand sections of *zhi* wood (梓木). With this, they constructed the *Sanqing* Hall (三清殿), bell towers, scripture halls, and galleries—all perfectly proportioned.

They also purchased a *fan* platform (梵坛), within which they found a yellowish-red stone. Doubting its spiritual potency, they discarded it, only for it to transmute into gold overnight. The temple’s construction costs thus exceeded expectations. Once the halls were complete, they prepared to sculpt statues, and at the Baihe Mountain Temple, they unearthed tens of thousands of *jin* of iron. From this, they cast three iron statues, each just over two *zhang* tall—now revered as the *Shengxiang* (圣像). Pilgrims from afar flocked to pray before them, and miracles were said to occur. The He family of Daoist adepts, who oversaw the temple, prospered for generations, becoming a noble lineage. To this day, merchants and peddlers, seeking profit, invariably visit the *Shengxiang* every three to five days to burn incense for blessings. Those who neglect this ritual find their trade unprofitable and their goods unsold.

**Miraculous Signs of the Opening of the New Flower Forest Temple in Xinzhou**
The Flower Forest Temple in Xinzhou’s Xinpuxian was originally the residence of a wealthy local family, situated along the riverbank. During the *Kaiyuan* era, a household awoke to an unfamiliar fragrance filling the courtyard, accompanied by radiant light and violet vapors stretching for miles. Strange flowers and trees adorned the grounds, while red and white lotuses bloomed in the pond, each over a *chi* wide, numbering beyond count. Divine beings and cranes moved among them before the vision faded after some time.

The townsfolk only smelled the fragrance but saw none of the wonders. They reported it to the authorities, and the residence was consecrated as a temple, named Flower Forest. When the *Tianzun* Hall was later constructed, the miraculous fragrance and luminous signs reappeared as before.

**Records of Daoist Miracles**

**Sacred Precincts and Divine Manifestations**

**White Crane Monastery in Qiantang County: The Plague of Locusts Avoided**
In Qiantang County, the Jin Dynasty general Wang Xizhi of the Right Army had two estates: the eastern one was the Golden Court Monastery, and the western one was the White Crane Monastery, separated by over seventy *li*. The descendants of the Wang family, numbering over a hundred households, resided at the Golden Court. Within White Crane Monastery lay the Bald Brush Mound, the Ink Pool, and the Sword Case—all treasures of the prefecture and county, including the flying silk inscription by Emperor Taizong. The monastery’s fields encircled its walls.

During the autumn of the *Xiantong* era, locusts ravaged crops, particularly in Jiang and Zhe, and villagers gathered to drive them away. Some beat drums and struck bronze vessels, clanging and clattering until nightfall, yet still they could not repel the devastation. The locusts swarmed across fields, devouring even the tallest stalks in moments. Some monastery fields bordered private lands, while others were separated by ditches, winding like intertwined fingers—yet while private fields were utterly destroyed, not a single blade of the monastery’s crops was harmed. Even plants rooted in monastery soil but extending into private fields remained untouched. The people attributed this to mere chance.

The following year, when crops were again damaged by drought, the monastery’s fields remained unscathed. The villagers then offered incense, purified their homes, and reported their gratitude to the Celestial Virtue.

**Great Treasure Monastery in Mingzhou: Waters and Floods Avoided**
The Great Treasure Monastery in Mingzhou, named by Emperor Minghuang, stood below Longtan. A stream flowed before it, and the monastery nestled within a flat forest. During heavy rains, muddy floods often caused trouble. In the early years of the *Dazhong* era, a sudden violent storm and thunder caused the stream and pond to overflow, destroying the forest and eroding the banks. The floodwaters surged toward the halls, churning like a raging mountain torrent—yet when they reached the monastery, dark clouds rose within the courtyard, and a great wind arose, dispersing the waters back into the stream. The monastery’s foundations now stood high and dry, untouched by mud or flood, its bell tower and grand hall rising above the forest.

**Panlong Monastery in Jinzhou: Fire Unchecked**
Within Jinzhou’s Jiakou district stood an ancient monastery called Panlong, with tiered altars and towering halls—its grand corridors and rooms numbering over twenty—though it was usually uninhabited. A wandering monk sometimes dwelled there, and the halls faced a desolate path, deep within dense foliage.

During the *Zhonghe* era, when the imperial procession rested in the Shu capital, the monastery lay along a vital route, its people scattered by war. A fierce wind suddenly ignited flames that swept through the mountains, consuming the halls and burning even the thorny undergrowth—yet the ancient monastery’s halls remained untouched, their walls utterly free of soot. Days after the fire, travelers discovered the ruins and questioned the elders, who knew nothing of who had extinguished the flames or when the fire had burned.

The villagers marveled, saying: *"Before the chaos of war, this valley was densely populated. When the upheaval came, people fled to the mountains, leaving behind hidden dangers and abandoned paths. There was no one to aid in extinguishing such a great blaze. If human hands had saved it, there would be traces of suppression. Now, the entire courtyard stands unscathed—this is beyond mortal strength. It must be the true spirit preserving it, the divine power guarding it."*

From then on, exiles from the valleys and mountain dwellers, moved by its divine response, gathered to rebuild.

**The Establishment of the Supreme-One Monastery in Dongchuan: A Divine Omen**

The Zhonghe era saw the imperial procession halt in Chengdu, where Yang Shili, the East川 Circuit Prefect, raised arms in rebellion, threatening the capital just a few miles away. The emperor, mindful of the peril, ordered Gao Renhou, the great general of Chengdu, to lead the local and garrison troops in suppressing the revolt. At that time, the Three Shus had long enjoyed peace, with abundant resources for both the state and its people. Though the fortress of Mógen Mountain was small, it could still resist the imperial armies with sheer force. After months of siege, the rebels’ strongholds were finally taken. Those who refused to surrender—those who, like the dog of Yao, clung to ruin rather than embrace survival—were either slain in battle or executed after victory. The dead lay scattered in the fields, their bones abandoned in ditches and gullies. Many were the slain.

After the triumphant return, the region was often heard to echo with ghostly wails, rising especially in darkness, their cries most piercing. Strange apparitions were seen at the gates, and eerie howls filled the roads, terrifying the locals. Meanwhile, the court rewarded Gao Renhou, appointing him to govern East川 and pacify the weary land. Renhou then constructed the **Supreme-One Victory Temple** atop the old military camp. Once the halls were complete, the nightly cries ceased.

When the statue of the **Primordial Sovereign, the Supreme-One**, was finished, Renhou dreamed of a vast black cloud like an inverted canopy covering the mountain peak. Suddenly, it transformed into a five-colored mist, within which he heard the music of strings and pipes. The people of the valley—men, women, old, and young—all ascended with the mist, leaping and dispersing. From that day forward, strange omens vanished, and the land knew peace once more.

**The Divine Omen of the Urn Crane Temple’s Self-Extinguishing Fire**
In **Jūnzhou**, the **Urn Crane Temple** lies south of **Zhèxiāng County**, along the **Nán川**, where the **Hàn River** splits before entering the province. Ten *li* upstream, the temple rests against the **Héngshān**, overlooking the flatlands below. Its groves are secluded, its halls grand—truly a place of refined elegance.

The elders say: When the **Celestial Sovereign** performed the **fēng-shān** rites at **Dōngyue**, cranes gathered upon the sacrificial altar. The emperor decreed that temples bearing their name be established across the land. In the **Kāiyuán** era, **Féng the Recluse** came here to dwell, refine his Dao, and pass away in transcendence. Later, a letter from **Xiāng-Hàn** was left with his disciples, and the locals, knowing he had attained the Way, enshrined his likeness.

By the end of the **Xiāntōng** era, with no Daoist master to maintain it, the temple fell into disrepair. The **sānmén** (three-gated hall), the ancient **gǔdiàn** (ancient hall), and the connecting corridors—barely twenty *zhang* in length—stood exposed, their walls collapsed, overgrown with weeds. Suddenly, wildfires surged with howling winds, flames licking at the eaves. The villagers, alarmed, rushed to save it. Yet within the temple’s **yánliú** (eaves’ drips), water surged upward like a suspended stream, quenching the fire without altering the sky’s clarity or summoning rain. This was no mere chance—it was the **transformative power of the divine**.

In the **Jiǎhài** year of the **Qiánsì** era, while touring sacred sites, an old man recounted these wonders, recording the omens upon the temple walls. That year, he also began plans to restore it.

**The Divine Dream of Chancellor Cuī at the Pānqiū Platform Temple**
In the **Northern Capital**, the **Pānqiū Platform** holds an ancient temple. Its statues are meticulously crafted, its pavilions grand and splendid, its site open and commanding, rising above the city’s heart. Though built many years prior, it had long been neglected, its halls sagging under wind and rain.

Chancellor **Cuī Yànzhāo** once dreamed he wandered in search of seclusion, arriving beneath the ancient platform. Tilting his head upward, he saw a **zǐqì** (purple vapor) swirling, its auspicious light radiating in all directions. There was no path to ascend. After some time, he heard **celestial music**—**tiānyuè** (heavenly melodies) and **jiāxiāo** (reed pipes)—and his longing to investigate grew only stronger. Yet the four corners were impassable, the distance vast as if spanning ten thousand *li*.

Suddenly, a golden bridge like a ladder appeared before him, broad and tiered. He began to climb, but halfway up, the steps collapsed. Just as he hesitated, a **giant golden hand** reached down, gripping his finger to pull him upward. Before he could steady himself, he stood atop the platform. Looking around, he saw only the ancient hall crumbling, the sacred altar overgrown. He sighed repeatedly before returning to the **Tiānzūn’s** (Celestial Venerable’s) presence, realizing the golden bridge was but the one before him, the golden hand his own. The heavenly music and purple vapors had vanished.

He asked, *"Could the Celestial Venerable have entrusted me with a message? Why such transformations?"*

The **Tiānzūn** suddenly spoke: *"You dwell here—do not forget to restore what is decaying."*

He awoke in alarm. Ten days later, he was appointed **Northern Capital Prefect**.

「板阙拦摧，跻攀不得，即见巨手金色引指而接之，公握指未定，已登台上矣。徘徊四顾，唯古殿欲摧，荒坛芜没，叹嗟数四，复到天尊之前，认金桥乃座前之桥耳。金手乃天尊之手耳，不复闻天乐之声，亦绝紫气之象。因言曰：岂天尊有所付嘱耶？何变化如此也？天尊忽言曰：子即居此地，无忘摧残也。俄而惊觉。旬日，受北都留守到镇。」

One month passed, and he felt a lingering melancholy, as though something had been lost, something doubted. Thus, he ordered his carriage and wandered freely, seeking to fulfill his yearning. Hearing that the **Port of Hongchóu** (Harbor Hill) was nearby, he went there to behold it.

Only the ancient hall lay in ruins, its deep grasses shrouded in mist. He then turned to worship the **Tiānzūn** (Celestial Venerable), and saw the statues and attendants just as they had appeared in his former vision. Slowly, he gazed upon the platform before him—the golden bridge stood there, its railings dismantled and its steps broken. Again, he observed the golden arm and finger, now vividly clear, recognizing them as the very objects from his dream.

He distributed gold to hire laborers, abolished old flaws, and rebuilt the hall with renewed vigor. Though the main hall (**#2**) had long endured, he spared it from further alteration, preserving its ancient design. All else—walls, corridors, altars, courtyards, gates, chambers, the vermilion and gold decorations, the jade-green and golden hues—was restored without omission. The grandeur of its construction and the offerings of incense and flowers marked a splendor unmatched in that age.

**Sòng Dynasty Minister Liǔ Zhān’s Dream Confirming the Authenticity of the True Symbol and Jade Stem Observatories at Jiānglíng**

Minister Liǔ Zhān, upon relocating to Jiānglíng in the south, encountered the **Jiānglíng True Symbol and Jade Stem Observatory** along his route. Having boarded the flat-bottomed boat and prepared to cast off the moorings, he turned his head and saw a statue of imposing grandeur, yet the ancient hall behind it had crumbled into decay. Asked its name, he learned it was the **True Symbol and Jade Stem Observatory**.

He entered through the gate, ascended the steps, and bowed his hands in silent prayer. That very night, he dreamed of a youth in green leading him upward, upon a great mountain. Pine paths stretched endlessly, while cliffs bore strange and exquisite formations, fragrant herbs and hidden grasses, rare black-flowered **wūlíng** (a mythical plant), all dazzling before his eyes. After traveling a mile or so, he beheld the **Tiānzūn** (Celestial Venerable) seated atop a throne of sacred flowers. Gazing upon the divine countenance, he recognized it as the same **Tiānzūn** from the **Jade Stem Observatory**.

He bowed and prayed, *"I have wronged the holy reign, exiled to distant lands. I bear no grudge, but only beg to return to life."* The **Tiānzūn** replied, *"Your green tablet is already inscribed among the **Fāngzhū** (Divine Registers). Why fear the hardships of this world?"*

Later, when he resumed his ministerial duties, he then attained the **Dao** (Way). From that time onward, he observed a decade of fasting and three days of abstinence, and then no longer dreaded the lands of the **Mánzhōu** (barbarians), the **zhèn hǎi** (malarial seas), or the realms of **āo méi** (demonic spirits). By the time of the **Chén** (9th earthly branch) and **Wèi** (11th earthly branch) hours, he had set his course with his son. Thus, Minister Liǔ led his southern campaign, reaching the **Lake and Ridge Pass** (Húlíng), and wherever he went, his inquiries about the observatories followed in succession.

He soon received gold and silk as tokens of trust from the **xíng shuài** (military governor), and personally oversaw the construction of the **Tiānzūn’s** hall, the **zhāi yuán** (fasting courtyard), lecture halls, and pavilions. He selected refined and devoted **fén xiū** (incense-burning) monks to dwell there. Then, in his second campaign, he entered the **Zhuǎngzhóu** (Imperial Capital) and, weary of worldly affairs, abandoned them—fulfilling the words of his dream, as the years and seasons aligned without fail.

**Minister Lǐ Wèi’s Dream Confirming the Authenticity of the Jade Stem Observatory in Biànzhōu**

Minister Lǐ Wèi, the **Northern Capital Prefect**, held authority over Biànzhōu and was also the overseer of the **Tàiqīng Palace**. Often, he yearned for the **Xuánguān** (Mystic Pass) and meditated upon the **True Dao**, contemplating its essence.

One night, he dreamed of wandering through the countryside, where a cluster of dense trees revealed a five-colored radiance. Within it stood a statue of the **Tiānzūn** (Celestial Venerable), its crown glowing with half a radiant light, and in its hand, it held a **jade stem** (玉芝) shaped like a white lotus flower—its stem round and slender, the stem bearing eight exquisite features. The details were vivid and clear, etched into his mind’s eye.

The next day, as he escorted guests outside the city, he caught sight of a **Dao** (Way) statue exposed to the elements. Asked about its location, he learned it was the **Jade Stem Observatory**. Minister Lǐ was astonished, turned his carriage, and paid homage.

The courtyard was overgrown with weeds, the paths choked with wild grasses, and he pushed through the thorns before proceeding. The statue he had seen in his dream was indeed the same. Though it did not hold the **jade stem**, its name matched his vision, so he lavishly adorned and repaired it.

The grand hall loomed majestically, its towering eaves resplendent with vermilion. The **zhāi yuán** (fasting courtyard), lecture halls, moonlit windows, and frost-covered altars stood in splendor. The gateway opened onto the street, its imposing presence dominating the **Yǐngguó** (region of Biànzhōu), becoming a sight of unrivaled grandeur.

Ah! The **Kāiyuán Emperor** (Emperor of the Open Element Era), who revered his ancestors and honored the **Dao** (Way), delved deeply into its mysteries, his sincerity piercing the heavens. The **Zhēn** (Divine Manifestation) had already descended to fulfill his wishes, securing the **True Symbol** from **Língfēng** (Spiritual Peak) and producing the **Jade Stem** within the palace.

Thus, he decreed that the **Northern Capital Prefect** establish an observatory in this sacred land, naming it the **True Symbol and Jade Stem Observatory**.

The **Xiandu Observatory** in Fengdu County, Zhongzhou—where the True Person Wang Fangping of the Former Han and the True Person Yin Changsheng of the Later Han attained the Dao and ascended to heaven—has long fallen into ruin, with only its foundations remaining. In the Jin Dynasty, Master Gao first restored and elevated it, and during the Taiyuan era, Yao Xun further repaired and adorned it. Later, the Liang and Sui dynasties neglected it, until the Song Dynasty restored it once more. Its jade-pillared halls soar into the void, and its vermilion eaves gleam in the sun.

Noble officials from the regions of Qian, Jing, Zhi, and Shu—high-ranking generals and ministers—would often pause their journeys to visit, always commanding its restoration. When Chancellor Zou Ping and Chancellor Duan Wenchang resided there during their travels, they encountered bandits in the Huixia region. Upon ascending the cave and offering incense, they kowtowed and prayed to the two True Persons: *"If I should ever rise to high office and escape this wretched plight, I shall surely repay you with grand renovations."* Within less than a decade, they governed Jiangling, and on the very evening of their appointment, they recalled their vow. That night, they dreamed the two True Persons appeared as intimate old friends, leading them to the summit of a riverside peak—where the entrance to Yin Jun’s cave lay. The two True Persons vanished, and the next day, the Chancellor allocated one month’s salary to repair the observatory, and another month’s salary as perpetual endowment for its upkeep, fulfilling their sacred promise.

The **Louguan Observatory**, once the residence of the Zhou Dynasty’s Grandee Yi Xi, stands in Zhengzuo County, Jingzhao Commandery, within the Wenshanzhuang Village of the Wenshanzhuang Township, nestled in the northern slopes of Zhongnan Mountain. Within its precincts are halls erected by King Mu of Zhou, the First Emperor of Qin, and Emperor Wu of Han, along with the First Emperor’s calligraphic inscriptions. Here also stand the abodes of Yi Xi, the Lingjing Well, the Venerable Lord Lao, the immortal *Zhi* plants and trees, the Ascension Platform, the Jin-Song prayer tablets, and Qin-Han inscriptions—relics preserved across the ages.

As the Tang Dynasty prepared to receive its mandate, the righteous army arose in Hedong, and for six or seven nights, the observatory glowed with crimson light from heaven. In the Guangming era, during the Gengzi year, when rebels besieged Chang’an, the observatory again radiated light, as if the imperial procession had retreated to Fengxian. When the court was about to relocate, the observatory once more displayed strange luminous phenomena. Thus, many fleeing commoners took refuge within, and its sacred aura endured unscathed, none daring to violate it. During the High Ancestor’s reign, it was bestowed the title *Zongsheng Observatory*.
