After reciting the Crimson Writs several times and turning to the Eight Might Talismanic Texts, knock the teeth thirty-six times. Then invoke:

*"Crimson Writs of Jade Characters, orthodox texts of the Nine Heavens,
Inscribed upon the numinous talismans, seizing ghosts and summoning spirits.
What is gathered arrives at once; what is pursued is wholly dispelled.
Ascend the marchmounts, prepare the turning—
dare any stand before me?
I, so-and-so, now seal the Primordial Beginning’s chapter:
may my seven ancestors ascend to heaven,
and may my person attain flying immortality.
Demon kings who behold the numinous talismans
shall have their eyes extinguished and their bodies perish!"*

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Statutes of the Mystic Capital!*

Conclude by knocking the teeth thirty-two times and swallowing saliva thirty-two times.

Here follows the translation:

---

For companionship, do not bind the wondrous mystery within the unicorn’s midst; the True Metal Youth records alone the summoning of a thousand luminous spirits of Fengdu. The Primordial’s White Pendant returns the True One through the Three Kalpas, warming life and drawing forth the waves of Langtai’s radiant halls. The Morning Urn Mound’s gate towers in profound obscurity—on the right, the Jade Flower Chariot and the Jade Effulgence’s secluded chambers weave evening’s perverse script. Towering above, demonic qi extends to the Grand Tenuity, where the Emperor’s office and the Jade Phoenix Prefecture spread their purple radiance, capturing the dawn’s transformations. The Perpetual Square faces the Great Execution Mountain’s script:

*"The dawn speaks of the New King Lord—this is not one born of Prior Heaven."*

To the right: the Purple Phoenix Register’s subsequent textual incantations and talismanic scripts.

Inscribe this talisman in vermilion. Take seven doses in one day, or twenty-one doses in three days. Place one talisman behind the bed and another upon the door; the illness shall then cease.

Further, invoke over the talisman:

*"White, white; crimson, crimson—
the Mysterious Mandate resides in the courtyard.
Above, I report to the Heavenly Thearch:
snatch death and fix life,
extend years and inscribe longevity,
to stand peerless with Heaven and Earth.
The Recorder establishes the register,
no longer bound to the Northern Star."*

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances!*

These three talismans, drawn from *The Three Augusts’ Celestial Writ of Great Characters* and the seventy-fifth chapter of the *Golden Light Sutra*, have been proven effective in prior and subsequent use. Do not doubt; do not disrespect.

On the first day of the such-and-such month in the such-and-such year of the Great Year, so-and-so, a disciple of the Supreme Cavern of Spontaneous Mystery and the Peerless Three Caverns of such-and-such prefecture, such-and-such county, such-and-such village, reverently practices under the Three Caverns Master, the Venerable Master so-and-so, bearing and wearing the *Precious Taboo of the Supreme Jade Perfected and the Multitude of Dao’s Comprehensive Overseer*. Now transmitting to so-and-so of such-and-such prefecture, such-and-such county, such-and-such village, aged so many years, so-and-so presents the requisite offerings and pledges bodily devotion to receive the *Precious Taboo of the Supreme Jade Perfected and the Multitude of Dao’s Comprehensive Overseer*. After receiving the taboo, so-and-so shall not rashly disclose it. So-and-so further pledges the names of deceased parents as witness and bond, daring not to leak or neglect. Should the covenant be violated, so-and-so’s parents in life and death shall together suffer punishment in hell, and so-and-so shall endure the trials of the Wind Blade. So-and-so marks this as a pledge, in accordance with the Statutes of the Most High Lord Lao.

To the right: the covenant of the *Precious Secret of the Supreme Jade Perfected and the Multitude of Dao’s Comprehensive Taboo*.

For the transmission of the Supreme Perfected’s twelve taels of gold, one hundred bolts of brocade, ninety bolts of purple silk, eighty bolts of crimson silk, sixty bolts of white silk, fifty bolts of black silk, one hundred twenty bolts of yellow silk, ten nine-inch mirrors, and one seven-foot sword.

These nine items are received as the Heavenly Thearch’s precious secret, transmitted through blood-oath alliance with Heaven. They are to be conferred only upon the worthy; guard them in secrecy.

Here ends the *Supreme Cavern’s Precious Taboo of the Supreme Jade Perfected and the Multitude of Dao’s Comprehensive Overseer*.
