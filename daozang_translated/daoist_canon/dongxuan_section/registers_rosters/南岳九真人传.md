**The Transmission of the Nine Perfected of Mount Nanyue**
*Composed by Liao Huang, Gentleman for Consultation, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, and Bearer of the Fish-Bag Emblem*

Of the Perfected of Mount Nanyue, nine are renowned by name. Their ascensions occurred between the Jin and Liang dynasties, and their images remain enshrined to this day. Who can fathom the gatherings of the Perfected within the Vermilion Mound Grotto-Heaven, where they attend the True Lord of Life-Infusion, offering their aid to transform misfortune into blessing for the people?

During the time when Sun Mian, Vice Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs, governed Changsha, he once dreamed of a Daoist-robed figure approaching him, saying: "□. An old man surnamed Wang, along with nine companions, had their fields usurped by a neighboring abbey for over a hundred years. Under your jurisdiction, I hope you will take this to heart." Sun merely committed the matter to memory, unable to grasp its full meaning. Later, when he was dispatched to offer sacrifices at the mountain, he chanced upon the Nine Immortals’ Stone Altar and saw an old shrine with statues. The central figure was inscribed as "Perfected Wang Lingyu," and his countenance closely resembled that of the figure in Sun’s dream. Recalling the earlier vision, Sun instructed local officials to investigate. A year later, they indeed recovered several parcels of land, clarifying the abbey’s annual usurpation of its yields and restoring them to their rightful management. If not for the Perfected’s numinous manifestation, how could this have been revealed through Sun’s dream and thus redressed? From that time, those in Hunan and Hubei who had engaged in deceit or concealment were often moved to repentance and reform upon hearing of this. Thereafter, pilgrims journeying to the Vermilion Mound feared only that they might fail to pay homage to the assembly of Perfected and beseech their blessings in due time.

Last winter, the Daoist Ouyang Daolong knocked at my door seeking an audience. He said to me: "For generations, my family has cherished the collection of immortal scriptures. By the time I came of age, more than half had been lost or scattered. Though some scrolls remain, most lack beginnings or endings. Only *The Transmission of the Nine Immortals of Mount Nanyue* survives in its proper sequence. I wish to carve printing blocks for it, alongside previously printed editions of *The Scripture of the Most High on Salvation*, *The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue by Laozi*, and *The Scripture of the Nine Dark Realms*, to circulate them together. May those who read them turn toward goodness and distance themselves from transgression—surely they will gain something from it. I humbly request that you, Master, compose a preface of a hundred words or so for its opening."

After examining his words, I found no trace of falsity or pretense. I promptly retrieved the *Transmission of the Nine Perfected* he mentioned, excising eleven instances of redundant or convoluted passages, correcting thirty-one erroneous characters, and resolving four discrepancies in the dates of their ascensions, taking the old stele as the authoritative source. I then said to Daolong: "I have heard that only those who trust in the Dao can truly study it; the peril of study is lack of diligence, and the peril of diligence is lack of perseverance. To study diligently and persevere long is to fulfill one’s practice and perfect one’s merit, reaching the farthest shores of attainment. Now, Daolong, you seek to cast off the myriad entanglements of the worldly, acting only to deliver others—truly, you are a person of resolve. You should strive to emulate the luminous conduct of the Perfected. The Nine Perfected began with purpose and saw it through to completion; those who mend their ways and ascend to immortality will find their places in the ranks. Thus, I have composed this preface in accordance with your request."

**Perfected Chen**, whose personal name was Xingming, was a native of Yingchuan. In his youth, he wandered among famous mountains, seeking the traces of the Perfected at the Heavenly Pillar Peak of Mount Nanyue. There, he encountered two Perfected, both appearing to be eighteen or nineteen years old. They said to him: "We have traversed the four seas, delivering those of resolute aspiration. Yet worldly people, though they may cultivate the Dao with temporary dedication, often falter midway and fail to persevere. How then can they ascend in bodily form to the heavens and soar through the celestial thoroughfares? Your accumulated merit is indeed commendable—only do not retreat or falter, and what worry is there that your name will not be inscribed in the golden registers and jade tablets? The bitterness of the past will give way to boundless joy, for suffering has its limit, while joy knows no end. Why is this so?"

Amidst secluded forests and valleys, dwelling in solitude with birds and beasts as companions, enduring hunger and thirst, toiling through cold and heat, forsaking worldly glory, parting from kin and abandoning love—this may indeed be called suffering. Yet to live as long as heaven and earth, to transform without limit, to ride the void and mount the empty air, to sprout wings at will—this may indeed be called joy. How then could one not strive with diligence in cultivation?

Xingming bowed his head and said: "I shall forever bear in mind these sagely words, dedicating my whole heart to the Dao, never daring to slacken or neglect it."

Thereupon, the Perfected transmitted to him the Way of the Luminous Mirror and the Mysterious True. After eighteen years of cultivation, the two immortals descended once more to address him: "Formerly, we bestowed upon you the supreme Dao, and you have indeed practiced it with diligence. Now you shall ascend to the Nine Heavens, roaming and feasting across the Eight Seas—this is the reward of your accumulated merit. Suffering first, joy after: only you have attained this."

On the first day of the third month in the first year of the Taishi reign of the Jin dynasty, he ascended at Yuanyang Palace.

Master Shi, whose personal name was Cun and who styled himself Master Hufu, studied under Huang Luzi and obtained the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, which enabled him to command the protection of tigers and leopards. Dwelling in the stone chamber of the cave gate on the western peak of Mount Heng, he would sometimes ride forth on a white leopard, so that those who admired him rarely gained close access.

In the first year of the Yongkang reign of the Jin dynasty, on the seventh day of the fourth month, he ascended.

Master Yin, whose personal name was Daoquan, was a native of Tianshui. On the rear peak of Mount Heng at the Hengyue Abbey, he cultivated the *Dao of the Cavernous Perfection for Returning the Spirit and Penetrating Vision*, and concurrently bore the talismans of the Five Thearchs and the Six Jia spirits for summoning the left and right numinous chariots. A celestial perfected descended and addressed him, saying: "Those who ascend in broad daylight must first possess the requisite talent before achieving the Way. In former times, Emperor Wu of Han, moved by the Supreme Perfection and Golden Mother, received the *Twelve Numinous Flights of the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts*, yet he only attained the *Dao of Liberating the Corpse*, unable to make both form and bones take flight together. You have received but one of these arts and yet harbor the hope of *ascending through the void*—this is the fruit of your diligent toil and also the lot of your predestined portion."

Daoquan replied: "This humble one’s learning is shallow and unworthy; I beseech you to reveal its essentials."

The celestial perfected said: "From the talismans of the Five Thearchs and the Six Jia spirits for summoning the left and right numinous flights, down to the *Zhang Scripture of the Primordial Cavern and Radiant Meng*, the matters and items are arranged in twelve successive stages. As for the *True Forms of the Five Marchmounts*, they are charts made by observing the mountains’ orientations and reversals, the sources of their spring fluids, the locations of their hidden metals and treasures, and the courses of their subterranean veins. Moreover, the officials, soldiers, and transcendents who govern talismans, charts, and the bureaus of the immortals are legion. You have obtained the numinous talismans and received the *True Forms of the Arrayed Marchmounts*; by believing in and reverently upholding them, you have achieved resonance and communion. Thus you know that the descendants of *Wenshi* and the clans of *Taihe* have, generation after generation, produced divine transcendents. I shall await you above the Nine Pures within the primordial vastness."

With these words, he departed.

During the Jin dynasty, Dao Master Quan resided in the mountains and ascended to the heavens in broad daylight on the ninth day of the first month in the ninth year of the Yongjia era. The Perfected Master Xu, whose personal name was Lingqi, was a man of the Song dynasty. He cultivated the Dao on Mount Nanyue, spending many years traversing its grottoes and ravines, as well as all the mountain valleys, for fifteen years without exception. In his *Record of Mount Heng*, he wrote: "Heavenly Pillar Peak stands four thousand one hundred *zhang* high, bearing the stele inscriptions of Yu the Great’s flood-control efforts, all in tadpole script. Purple Canopy Peak is often graced by white cranes circling its summit, where divine mushrooms and sacred herbs grow. Beneath it lies a stone chamber, within which an incense burner, mortar and pestle, and alchemical crucible remain intact. Upon Vermilion Brightness Peak stands a jade altar of azure hue, beside which grows a purple pear tree. Though its fruit ripens, none may partake of it." His account of the grotto-palaces and marvels was exceedingly detailed, yet it remains unknown what Dao Lingqi cultivated. He could subdue tigers and leopards, command ghosts and spirits, and on the ninth day of the ninth month in the second year of the Yuanhui era of the Qi, he ascended to the heavens in broad daylight from the Upper Clarity Palace.

The Perfected Master Chen, whose personal name was Huidu, cultivated the Dao and refined elixirs at the Jade Clarity Abbey. From dawn to dusk, he was tested by mountain spirits, and though his three attempts at forging the elixir crucible failed, his resolve only grew more steadfast. When the elixir was finally completed, he ingested it and ascended to the heavens on the thirteenth day of the fifth month in the second year of the Yongming era of the Jin.

The Perfected Master Zhang, whose personal name was Tanyao, resided at the Summoning Transcendents Abbey, where his concentrated contemplation resonated with the Celestial Perfected. They secretly descended to transmit to him the Dao of Internal Nourishment, the Primal Harmony, and the Silent Audience before the Great Emperor. After practicing it for thirteen years, his spirit roamed the Great Void, where he faced the August Ultimate Great Emperor and was bestowed with the Jade Essence, the Numinous Elixir of Radiant Fusion. Having received and ingested it, his transformations became unfathomable, and his spiritual efficacy knew no bounds. On the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of the Yanxing era of the Qi, he ascended to the heavens.

The Perfected Master Zhang, whose personal name was Shizhen, was a native of Nanyang. Residing on Mount Nanyue, he encountered immortals who descended to transmit to him the Dao of the Luminous Mirror, instructing him to cultivate it. They said: "That which illuminates the principles of things is Heaven. That which reflects the forms of things is the mirror. The Dao of Heaven is clarity; the essence of the mirror is brightness. If one can embody Heaven’s clarity and the mirror’s brightness, calming the heart and settling the spirit to achieve inner and outer luminous transparency, then the supreme Dao is attained. But if one inwardly exhausts their intellect and outwardly wearies their form, with a heart uncalm and spirit unclear, they are far from the Dao." He had once received this teaching from Master Changsang, who said: "The essentials of this Dao are secretly guarded by the Celestial Emperor of the Great Tenuity’s Central Heaven. Those who obtain it achieve profound penetration and distant illumination of the Eight Extremities. Among the methods of the Cavern of Perfection, there is the Dao of the Four Regulations, practiced in accordance with the four seasons, which is of the same essence as this." The ancients said: "Empty your chamber, and brightness will arise of itself; settle your heart, and the Dao will come of itself." Truly, these words are trustworthy. Shizhen cultivated this for nine years and attained mastery, gaining the ability to see clearly for a thousand *li*, with nothing hidden from his sight. On the thirteenth day of the eleventh month in the third year of the Tianjian era of the Liang, he ascended to the heavens in broad daylight from the Nine Transcendents Abbey.

The Perfected Master Wang, whose personal name was Lingyu, was a Daoist from Jiujiang who devoted himself earnestly to the Dao. Initially residing on Five Elders Peak, a divine person spoke to him at night, saying: "One who seeks the Dao but does not dwell in the proper place is like planting the five grains in sand and stone—they cannot come to fruition. Even if one possesses the bones for ascending flight, one must first find a blessed land and numinous site; only then can transformation occur. Though one may accumulate virtue to enrich the land and amass merit to grow wings, if the place is not fitting, demons will corrupt one’s efforts, and the Dao will never be attained." Lingyu asked which place would be suitable for dwelling, and was told: "The upper peaks of Vermilion Mound and the neighboring ridges of Purple Canopy—there one may ascend to the heavens." Thereupon, he moved from Mount Lu to reside in the Central Abbey of Mount Nanyue. After twelve years, a host of Perfected Ones descended to welcome him, and on the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the eleventh year of the Tianjian era of the Liang, he ascended from the altar.

The Perfected Master Deng, whose personal name was Yuzhi, was once a friend of Xu Lingqi and traveled with him through the sacred mountains. During the Yuanhui era of the Song, when Master Xu ascended to the heavens from the Upper Clarity Abbey, Yuzhi lingered among the immortal mountains. After many years, Emperor Wu of the Liang, having heard of his cultivation but lacking the necessary cinnabar and minerals, issued an edict granting him resources and permitted him to establish three abbeys—upper, middle, and lower—on Mount Lushan as places for refinement. A divine person spoke to him, saying: "Within the grotto-gate lies a land of fortune-summoning and life-prolonging; remember this well and do not forget." When his elixir was completed, he returned to reside east of Purple Canopy Peak. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth month in the eleventh year of the Tianjian era of the Liang, eight Perfected Ones descended in a cloud chariot with feathered canopies into his chamber—these were the eight Perfected Ones who had previously attained the Dao and ascended. On that day, they invited Yuzhi to ascend with them from the natural stone altar into the heavens. Later, an imperial decree of the Han dynasty established an abbey there, selecting Daoists to oversee its offerings. By the Xiantong era of the Tang, Zhang Guan, the prefect of Hengzhou, petitioned for the site to be named the Nine Transcendents’ Stone Altar of Purple Canopy Peak, and his request was granted.

Here ends the *Traditions of the Nine Perfected Ones of Mount Nanyue*.
