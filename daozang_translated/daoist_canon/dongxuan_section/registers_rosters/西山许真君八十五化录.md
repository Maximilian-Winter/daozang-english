**Postscript to *The Eighty-Five Transformations of Perfected Lord Xu of West Mountain***

In the Jiading year of *jiashen* (1224), the Patriarch Perfected Lord Xu descended upon Jinling, revealing the teachings of loyalty and filial piety, universally transforming sentient beings and guiding all toward the Orthodox Dao. There was a layman named Wang who, moved by the sagely teachings, exhausted his family wealth to establish the *Chongzhen Daoist Abbey* west of *Tianqing Temple*, where incense and offerings have been maintained to this day. Shi Cen, upholding the Master’s decree, propagated the mystic winds together with his disciples. Suddenly, disciples Xing Daojian and Liang Daoning also built the *Brave Awakened Daoist Abbey* north of *Jiahui Tavern*, a place to receive immortal guests. Those who gathered like clouds and mist numbered no fewer than a thousand. Yet among them, only Wang Daochong, Song Daosheng, Zhao Daotai, Zhao Daojie, Lin Shouyi, Jia Shoucheng, Liu Daoyi, and Kong Shoushan possessed the resolve of metal and stone and the hearts of the hungry and thirsty.

These few had long read *The Biographies of West Mountain* and daily extolled the Patriarch’s merits. Recently, Song Daosheng presented *The Biographies of the Twelve Perfected Lords* for correction. Upon examination, Shi Cen found its diction repetitive and its chapters disordered, causing readers to grow weary—a deep pity. Thus, he revised the events, distinguished the passages, and arranged them into eighty-five transformations, each accompanied by a poem. Xing Daojian, holding the scroll and awaiting instructions from beginning to end, was truly admirable, filling Shi Cen with joy.

When the poems were completed, Zhu Shouzhong came to assist in reviewing them, striving to eliminate errors of miswriting or misreading. Thus, the transmission of the Patriarch’s legacy became beyond doubt. Indeed, the sagely merits and Daoist practices of the Patriarch now shine as brightly as the blue sky and white sun. After renovating the abbey and compiling the poems and biographies, Xing Daojian further raised funds to carve the woodblocks for printing, ensuring its transmission for a thousand generations without end. Could this transmission not endure forever? May the illustrious names of Xing and Liang never fade.

**Preface to *The Eighty-Five Transformations of Perfected Lord Xu of West Mountain***

That immortality can be learned and death overcome through effort is indeed true. The Dao of immortals lies in accumulating merit internally and practicing virtue externally. When merit and conduct are fully realized, they move heaven and earth and stir ghosts and spirits—this is the natural principle. How could merit and conduct be achieved without wisdom and effort?

Of old, the Patriarch Perfected Lord Xu rectified his heart and sincerely cultivated his intent, maintaining true purity and constant stillness, preserving spirit and securing the Mysterious, embracing the Origin and guarding the One—was this not sagely merit? He cultivated benevolence and accumulated virtue, relieved the poor and rescued the suffering, always aiding those in peril, guiding the virtuous toward the Dao, putting others before himself, and acting without selfishness—was this not Daoist conduct? From this, we see that once merit and conduct were perfected, the sagely Dao was fully realized, and he ascended with his household to the Nine Heavens—a feat unheard of in ancient or modern times.

Thus, the compilation of this transmission serves as a mirror reflecting the Patriarch’s merit and virtue. These poems are not mere displays of literary embellishment by disciples. Rather, they record his deeds and praise his magnificent traces. May later learners know that the Patriarch cultivated merit and established conduct in this manner. If they can emulate and embody these, they will fulfill the Dao and virtue, attaining immortality, and ride alongside the Perfected Ones of West Mountain.

The eighty-five transformations are not merely records of past events; the Patriarch’s intent in establishing teachings and transformations holds profound expectations for later learners. I urge you to strive forward.

Respectfully composed on the *bixi* day of the *bingwu* year of the Great Song (1246), by Brave Awakened Perfected One Shi Cen of West Mountain, who bows a hundred times in reverence while chanting the sagely virtues.

**Scroll One of *The Eighty-Five Transformations of Perfected Lord Xu of West Mountain***
Compiled by Brave Awakened Perfected One Shi Cen of West Mountain

**The First Transformation: Origins**
The Patriarch’s surname was Xu, his given name Xun, and his courtesy name Jingzhi. His great-grandfather was Ying, his grandfather Wu, and his father Su, all natives of Xuchang, men of lofty integrity who never served in office, descendants of the Yingyang lineage. During the late Han, his father fled to Nanchang in Yuzhang and settled there. In the second year of *Chiwu* (239), the *jiwei* year, his mother dreamed of a golden phoenix holding a pearl in its beak, which fell into her palm. She played with it and swallowed it, and upon waking, felt movement in her womb. Thus, she conceived and gave birth to the Patriarch.

**Poem:**
A golden phoenix bore a pearl from the Nine Heavens,
The Sacred Mother of Gaoyang gave birth to a worthy sage.
A crimson glow, an auspicious sign, filled the orchid chamber,
Her name inscribed in the Jade Tablets of the Purple Palace.
Had his father and grandfather not cultivated virtue,
How could their descendants become immortals?
His mysterious merit and Daoist wonders surpass past and present,
Bringing blessings to lords and people for centuries.

**The Immortal Brothers’ Transformation**
Jumountain’s distant wanderers—Jun, Mai, and General Adjutant Mu—were the Patriarch’s second cousins.

**Poem:**
The two Xus of the river harbor lofty arts,
Secluded in Jumountain to escape worldly toil.
Unconcerned with profit, they joined the military camp,
How could they cling to fame and linger in mundane posts?
The immortal lineage’s source flows from afar,
The spiritual root’s branches intertwine.
The Patriarch, too, gained such brothers,
Their conduct far removed from ordinary men.

**The Awakening to Reality Transformation**
The Patriarch was born with exceptional intelligence, his appearance elegant and imposing. From childhood, he was perceptive and detached, without worldly attachments. Once, while hunting, he shot a pregnant doe, which fell, and its fawn tumbled out. The mother doe still turned to lick it before dying.

Moved by this, he immediately cast aside his bow and arrows.

**Poem:**
His celestial form and Daoist bearing gleamed without dust,
Brows and eyes clear, transcending worldly men.
His mind’s capacity embraced rivers and seas,
His sincere heart tamed ghosts and spirits.
Not by shooting the doe was his original nature revealed—
How else could he mount the simurgh to verify the utmost truth?
In benefiting beings and accumulating hidden virtue,
His meritorious deeds remain ever fresh to this day.

**Diligent Study and Transformation**
The Patriarch applied himself earnestly to study, mastering the classics and histories, and comprehending books on astronomy, geography, music, the five phases, and apocrypha. He was especially devoted to the arts of immortals and self-cultivation, attaining profound mastery. Hearing that Wu Meng of Xi’an had received the divine methods of the perfected one Ding Yi, he journeyed to study under him and fully inherited his esoteric teachings.

**Poem:**
Endowed with natural wisdom beyond the dull,
He devoted himself to penetrating the works of a hundred schools.
To navigate the world, one must exhaust its affairs;
To seek immortality, one must grasp its essential pivot.
Why hoard the wondrous Dao for myself alone?
Better to obtain divine methods to aid the multitudes.
Fortunate indeed that Master Wu unlocked the treasure trove—
How splendid that merit and practice harmonized so perfectly.

**Selecting the Site for Transformation**
Thereupon, with Guo Pu, he sought famous mountains for an auspicious site to establish his abode of truth. They found the southern slopes of Western Mountain, at the Xiaoyao Mountain estate of the Jin family, and he moved there to reside. This is now the Xiaoyao Blessed Land and the Jade Prosperity Longevity Palace. The Jin family regarded him as a divine being, as later recorded in his hagiography. He devoted himself daily to cultivation and refinement, and the Elixir Well and Medicine Mortar remain there to this day. He sought neither fame nor prominence. His village admired his filial piety and fraternal kindness, while his associates esteemed his virtue and righteousness.

**Poem:**
The Western Mountain’s blessed land—this is the immortals’ capital,
With emerald peaks and limpid streams, a scene like painted scrolls.
With Master Guo he chose the site in person,
And the Jin family gladly welcomed his move.
The land’s natural geomancy favored cultivation;
Each day with friends he tilled and weeded.
The village rejoiced, transformed by his virtue,
And from then on his Daoist fame spread across rivers and lakes.

**The Golden Lampstand’s Transformation**
Once, a man sold an iron lampstand. When he lit it at night, he saw where the lacquer had flaked away—beneath it was gold. The next day, he sought out the owner and returned it. If someone offered him a gift, even the smallest thing, he would refuse it if it was not rightfully his.

**Poem:**
His nature was pure and incorrupt—all praised him,
How could he accept gold from others’ desires?
Even ten thousand bushels of grain, if improper, he deemed unjust;
A single coin offered amiss—he would not bend his principles.
Wealth is but floating clouds, scattered and gathered in vain,
While conduct, like the sun at dawn, grows ever brighter.
The patriarch looked up to the resolve of his forebears—
Long ago, when Yao offered abdication, he too held it light.

**The Transformation of Jingyang**
Though recommended as a filial and incorruptible scholar, he declined. The imperial court repeatedly bestowed honors upon him, and at last, in the first year of the Taikang era, he reluctantly accepted the post of magistrate of Jingyang County in Shu Commandery, at the age of forty-two.

**Poem:**
His benevolent renown filled the commandery, the people cherished him,
The worthy governor’s missive soared to the jade steps of the throne.

Amid clouds, a red simurgh bore the imperial edict in its beak;
On the wind, a white crane emerged from the mountains.
The dust of the world could not obscure his mist-and-cloud nature,
While the court’s halls awaited one fit for the ridgepole’s timber.
The Son of Heaven’s favor, so graciously bestowed—how dare he refuse?
Thus began the virtuous governance of Jingyang.

**The Transformation of Virtuous Governance**
Upon assuming office, he admonished the clerks to cast off greed and baseness, to eliminate vexatious regulations, and to release prisoners from their bonds, instructing all in the Dao.
Officials and commoners alike rejoiced in submission, all wishing to reform.
His investigations were as swift as a spirit—none dared deceive him.
When hearing lawsuits, he first taught loyalty, filial piety, kindness, benevolence, forbearance, prudence, diligence, and frugality; to draw near the worthy, distance the wicked, abandon greed, and curb violence. These principles were recorded in written admonitions, his words thorough and detailed. Yet fearing the remoteness of the hundred *li* might hinder household understanding, he selected cultivated folk of virtue and repute, along with elders of discernment, to whom he entrusted the task of exhortation. Thus, the tide of contention daily ebbed, until at last litigation ceased entirely.

**Poem:**
Flocks of birds, celestial companions, praised his virtuous rule;
By the Hall of the Lute’s Song, not a murmur arose.
Kindness drew fledglings near the mulberry’s shade;
Virtue’s weight banished locusts beyond the borders.
His great aspiration had been to bring timely rain;
At leisure, he planted peach blossoms in idle hours.
The court stood empty, affairs simplified—none sued;
Long days passed with blinds drawn, shadows slanting.

**The Transformation of Relieving the Destitute**
Earlier, in years of famine, the people had no means to pay taxes, yet the commandery and county enforced the law, driving many to flee.

The Patriarch then took his sacred elixir and transmuted tiles and pebbles into gold, secretly burying them in the county gardens. One day, he summoned all taxpayers in arrears to the court to demand an accounting, then set them to labor in the rear gardens. As they tilled the earth, they unearthed gold with which to settle their taxes, and thus all remained secure in their homes. Refugees from neighboring regions, drawn by his virtuous bounty, flocked to join him in great numbers, so that households multiplied and thrived.

**Poem:**
When Heaven’s seasons brought famine and grain withered,
Starving folk fell behind in their tax and rent.
Prefectures and counties enforced the law with harsh rigor,
Driving households to desperate flight from their doors.
Gold and treasure were hidden in gardens deep,
While farmers, feigning labor, wielded hoe and spade.
Once they gained wealth to pay their dues,
Villagers took up plow and returned to field and home.

**The Transformation of Quelling the Plague**
In a year of great pestilence, seven or eight out of ten perished. The Patriarch, employing the divine formulas he had received, healed the afflicted—wherever his talismans and incantations reached, recovery was instantaneous. Even those suffering from deep-seated or chronic ailments were cured without exception. Word spread to other commanderies, and the sick arrived in a steady stream, numbering in the thousands each day. He then planted bamboo markers ten *li* beyond the city walls at the riverside, placing talismanic water within them so that those who drank beneath the bamboo were healed. For the elderly, the frail, and the gravely ill who could not come themselves, he instructed others to draw the water and carry it home, whereupon they too were cured and restored. The people of Shu composed a ballad:

*No theft among the folk,
No deceit among the clerks.
Our lord revives the dying—
Disease can do no work.*

Later, people from the lands east of the Yangtze came to draw water from Jingyang. The Patriarch then recited an incantation over a vessel of water, placed a talisman within it, and bade them carry it home to set by the riverbank, planting bamboo to mark the spot. Those who drank from it were likewise healed. This river is now called the Shu River, also known as the Brocade Waters, and lies within present-day Gao’an of Ruizhou.

**Poem:**
When plague’s poison raged and spread,
Village after village fell to its dread.
With a single-minded wish to reveal the divine art,
He empowered the healing waters to save all hearts.
The deeply afflicted found strength anew,
Great maladies vanished, bodies light as dew.
Even the Brocade Waters sought his aid,
And to this day, bamboo marks where the river’s grace was laid.

**The Transformation of Renouncing Glory**
After serving long in Jingyang, the Patriarch foresaw the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty and resigned his post to return home. Jingyang County belonged to Hanzhou; after the Patriarch’s ascension, the court renamed it Deyang in honor of his virtue and its people. Later, the county seat was moved to the west, and the former site became a Daoist abbey, now called Jingyang Abbey. The people, moved by his transformative virtue, found no way to detain him and so erected living shrines wherever he had dwelled, passing down his portrait in their homes and revering him as a divine being. On the day of his departure, those who packed provisions to see him off filled the fields, some traveling a thousand *li* before turning back. Others followed him to his estate, offering to serve him for life without returning. There, on the vacant land east of his home, they built thatched huts in formation like a military encampment. Many changed their surnames to match the Patriarch’s, and thus the place came to be called Xu Family Camp. Such was the depth of his enduring love for the people.

**Poem:**

"Having achieved official rank and won renown, what further ambition could remain?
I returned to my homeland to retire, following the example of the Two Shu.
How many shrines with statues stand in my honor?
Elders and children packed provisions to crowd the long road.
King Tai fled the Di to found Qi’s market,
Shun left Yao to rise from Deng’s wilds.
His enduring love clung to the people, who would not part,
so they built thatched huts and all came to dwell in Xu’s Camp.

**Poem:**

At Xinwu, the Patriarch once rested in Mulberry Grove,
when suddenly five maidens, each bearing a treasured sword, came to offer them.
Struck by their strangeness, he accepted.
That place is now Wulin Abbey.
Thereafter, they accompanied him to his estate,
spending their days striking swords in delight, baffling all who saw.
The Patriarch recognized them as sword immortals,
and always treated them with reverence, ultimately gaining the use of their divine blades.
After the Patriarch’s ascension,
they concealed themselves beneath the wutong he had planted,
and were thus called the Bridge Tree Immortal Maidens.

**Poem:**
The road to Xinwu met five maidens,
each holding a jeweled casket, offering frost-edged blades.
Silently, his wisdom discerned their difference,
knowing their numinous power, he made them welcome.
With a shout, they commanded gods and spirits to enforce the law,
slaying serpents and vanquishing malevolent forces.
When the Patriarch’s work was complete and he ascended to heaven,
the immortal maidens hid themselves amid the emerald wutong.

Thereafter, he traveled with Lord Wu to Songyang,
where they heard that in Jinling’s Danyang County, at Huangtang,
a female master named Chen Mu possessed many Daoist arts.
Together they went to pay their respects and inquired into the mysteries of the Way.
Mu said: ‘You both were born with immortal bones and your names are recorded in heaven.
Yet long ago, Filial Piety King descended from the Upper Clarity
to transform and deliver the world, demonstrating filial devotion.
First, he descended into the home of Lan Gong in Qufu County, Yanzhou, saying:
*In the Later Jin era, the immortal Xu Xun will transmit this Way of mine,
becoming the leader of all perfected beings.*
He left behind the Golden Elixir Scripture, bronze talismans, and iron charters,
commanding me to safeguard them until your arrival. Many years have passed.
I also received the teachings of the Filial Piety Luminous King,
which likewise take filial piety as their foundation.
Now that you have come, I shall transmit them to you.’
She then chose an auspicious day, ascended the altar, and followed the rites to initiate him,
elucidating filial piety, swearing oaths, and impressing warnings.
She bestowed the bronze talismans, iron charters, Golden Elixir Scripture,
the Orthodox Unity’s demon-slaying arts, the Three-Five Flying Steps technique,
and all the secret methods of the various ranks, transmitting them fully to the Patriarch.
Even today, the Five Thunder Methods and the like are what she taught him.

**Poem:**
Seeking Chen Mu’s guidance at Huangtang,
the teachings revered the Filial Piety King as their founder."

The incense was first lit as dawn’s dew still clung,
words yet unspoken, hearts already in accord.
Bronze talismans and iron charters proclaimed the sworn oaths,
the Golden Elixir Scripture’s treasures were expounded in full detail.
Choosing an auspicious day, she ascended the altar and transmitted all,
while Jingyang’s name had long been inscribed in the immortal realm.

The Jade Register then turned to Master Shen and said to Lord Hao:
"Formerly, you took the divine methods as Master Xu’s teacher,
yet now the teachings of the Filial Piety Luminous King are transmitted to you alone.
You should now defer to him as your master.
Moreover, in the Jade Emperor’s primordial register,
your rank is that of *Yuanshi Yushi* of the Yuan Capital,
while Master Xu’s rank is *Gaoming Dashi*,
overseeing the celestial registers—your ranks and duties differ greatly.
You preside over the twelve earthly branches, corresponding to the twelve states’ domains,
while Master Xu governs the *Xuan* and *Yang* wilds of *Chen*,
ruling the *Zi* branch and its dominion.
The twelve domains you oversee are the *Xingji* region,
which corresponds to *Chou* in the earthly branches.
From now on, Master Xu should be regarded as the elder."

**Poem:**
The world once called you Master Xu’s teacher,
yet in the Jade Register’s immortal ranks, this was not fitting.
Though you received the divine methods in transmission,
how could one know the sacred offices hold high and low?
Below, the domains are ordered by rank and duty;
above, the stellar constellations are not equal.
With ranks so distant, roles so distinct,
why doubt that Jingyang should be the elder?

**Morning Audience with the Perfected**
After the Patriarch and Lord Hao had paid their respects and taken their leave,
the Patriarch resolved to visit the Matriarch each year.
She perceived his intent and said:
"Do not come. I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm."
Then, taking a blade of fragrant grass, she cast it southward, saying:
"When you return, seek where this grass falls and establish my shrine there.
A visit each autumn will suffice."
The Patriarch and Lord Hao returned and first sought the trail of the flying grass.
More than forty *li* south of their dwelling, they found it—already overgrown.
There they built a shrine, also naming it *Huangtang*,
calling it *Chongzhen Guan*. Today, it is known as *Huangtang Longdao Gong*.
Each year, on the third day of mid-autumn, they would go to pay their respects.

**Poem:**

Each year, his heart vowed to make the pilgrimage,
Bearing the weight of his master’s grace, never to fade.
Why shrink from a thousand *li* of road?
The Immortal Lord might return to the Five-Cloud Court.

Plucking the grass, he cast it where it took root,
Building halls and shrines, or perhaps planting peach trees.
Year after year, on the third day of mid-autumn,
The sky fills with phoenixes and cranes amid the strains of *Xiao Shao*.

**The Resting-in-Truth Transformation**
The Patriarch, seeking the path of the flying grass, paused by a clear pond to rest—calling it *Qizhen Jing*.
Today, this is *Qingbei Village* and *Qizhen Jing*.

He saw villagers slaughtering and feasting in sacrifice to the gods,
Exclaiming in alarm: "If the offering is meager, the gods will send disaster!"
The Patriarch said: "How dare these demons act so?"
That night, he lodged at an inn and summoned wind and thunder to strike them, uprooting their grove.
The next day, he told the villagers: "The malevolent shrine is destroyed—no more sacrifices are needed."
Today, the site lies abandoned, no offerings made.

**Poem:**
On his return, he followed the trail of the flying grass,
Reaching the clear pond’s village to rest his weary steps.
Suddenly, he saw villagers preparing sacrifices,
Their feasts stirred by a malevolent shrine.
How could mere wood and earth harbor such spirits?
He called forth wind and thunder to purge them utterly.
He warned the villagers to cease their reckless rites,
And the land knew peace, free from clamor.

**The Spirit Spring Transformation**
Seeing people carrying buckets on poles along the road,
The Patriarch struck the dry marsh before the shrine with his staff, and a spring gushed forth to aid them—never failing, even in drought.
Today, this is the stone well of *Ziyang Jing* in *Daze Village*.

**Poem:**
Carrying buckets on poles brought great toil,
The marsh’s people suffered from lack of water.
With a touch of his sacred staff, the Five Peaks stirred,
A single spring welled forth in gentle flow.
Like Geng Gong, who dug through enemy lines,
Or Pang Jian, who drilled through bronze with gathered strength—
Yet how could they compare to the Patriarch’s wondrous act?
Cool, sweet streams trickled forth of their own accord.

**The Dragon City Transformation**
The next day, he climbed a mountain peak and pointed to a spring altar on the mountainside, saying:
"There lies a strange creature hidden, which will later bring calamity."
He then established an altar and shrine to suppress it.
Today, he always rests here during his annual pilgrimage to the Matriarch, calling it *Longcheng Guan*.

**Poem:**
By chance, he climbed to the lofty peak,
And spied a spring bursting from the mountainside.
Soon, he saw where dark vapors coiled—
A strange creature lurked within.
If it emerged later, the people would suffer harm;
Thus, he used his power to banish it that day.
He built an altar to subdue it,
And its traces remain to this day.

**The Pine Wall Transformation**
The Patriarch crossed the *Xiao Shu River* (now called *Huanghu Kou*).
Reaching a riverside inn, its owner, the Zhu family, though poor, welcomed him with great reverence.
In jest, the Patriarch drew a pine tree on the wall before leaving.
That very day, the family’s profits doubled.
Later, when the river flooded and breached the dike, all the market stalls were swept away—except the wall with the pine, which remained unharmed.
Today, the place is called *Songhu Market*, and the Zhu family still receives offerings there.

**Poem:**
Though poor, the Zhu family gladly welcomed guests,
The Patriarch’s visit bringing fortune’s touch.
Joyfully, he left immortal ink upon their wall,
A treasure for their home to cherish.
Since then, his cloud-like traces have grown faint,
Yet their market profits have shone ever brighter.
Recently, the river’s wrath swept away dike and stalls—
Only the pine wall stood firm, guarded by the divine.

**The Yellow Dragon Transformation**
The Patriarch once refined elixirs on *Huanglong Mountain* in *Aicheng*.
A dragon spirit lurked in the mountain’s stream, guarding its lair and stirring floods to drown his elixir chamber.
The Patriarch dispatched divine soldiers to seize it and nail it to a stone cliff.
Today, the *Dingjiao Stone* remains.

After completing the elixir, he offered it at the stone chamber of *Ge Xian Gong* on *Mufu Mountain*, then traveled to *Xiuchuan*.
Admiring the swift currents and the river’s purity, he drew his sacred sword and sharpened it on a stone by the stream.
Today, this is in *Mei Mountain*, where later generations built a shrine to mark his holy traces—now called *Jingyang Guan*.
He then crossed the water and ascended *Xiufeng* (now called *Jingyang Mountain*).
At the peak, he built an altar to offer thanks to the Celestial Emperor before consuming the elixir.

**Poem:**
He entered *Huanglong* to refine the elixir,
Where the mountain’s dragon stirred torrents.
Swiftly, he summoned fierce warriors in golden armor,
Pursuing the wild spirit to nail it to the cliffs.
The task done, he sought a stream to sharpen his sword,
The medicine complete, he climbed the ridge to build a jade altar.
The Patriarch offered thanks to the celestial beings,
Then consumed the elixir, riding a rainbow phoenix.

**The Western Peace Transformation**
Lord Hao lived nearby. To the south of the stream lay *Hao Xian Village* and *Hao Xian Guan*—the former residence of Lord Hao the True.
The Patriarch visited Lord Hao’s home and passed through *Xi’an County* (now *Fenning*).
The county’s earth god came to pay his respects and reported that a malevolent creature was harming the people, but its spirit had hidden it.
The Patriarch passed a small shrine where the god—surnamed Mao, with four brothers—now called *Xieyou Miao*, stood in the county’s east.
The god greeted him, saying: "A dragon spirit here harms the people. Knowing you would come, it fled to *E Zhu*. It will return—please rid the people of this scourge."
The Patriarch followed its trail and pursued it to the roadside near *E Zhu*, where he met three elders (now *Sanwang Miao*).
Asking where the dragon spirit hid, they all pointed: "It lurks beneath the bridge ahead."
Today, this is called *Fulong Bridge*.
The Patriarch stood by the bridge, brandished his sword, and shouted—startling the dragon into fleeing into the great river, where it hid in the depths.
Today, this is called *Xialong Xue*.
He then commanded divine soldiers to drive it out. The dragon burst forth from upstream, and he slew it.
Today, this is called *Shanglong Kou*.

The Patriarch, angered by the *Xi’an* earth god’s dereliction, sealed the shrine’s gate and forbade the people from making offerings.
Today, the main gate of *Fenning County’s* city god temple remains closed; when opened, the town suffers fires. The priests only use the side entrance, and few residents make offerings—now worshipping at a smaller shrine.
The *Xieyou Hou* shrine, however, receives abundant offerings and is renowned for its divine responses.

**Poem:**
It was said he rode his carriage through *Hao Village*,
Hearing a dragon spirit dwelled there.

The Three Elders pointed at the bridge, saying it had taken refuge there,
The Five Attendants on the road reported its flight.
"To spare the people harm, leave no offspring—
Pursue it to the border, seize it, and sever its roots."
The Patriarch, enraged at the *Xi’an* earth god’s dereliction,
Left the shrine’s gate sealed to this day.
The cinnabar elixir transformed—then he returned to the prefectural city.
The Patriarch said: "This place is a vital hub of water and land routes, teeming with people.
How could there be none fit for attaining immortality?"
He tested this by mixing several grains of the elixir with other medicines and selling them,
Letting buyers take them on faith.
Though many redeemed the remedies, not one encountered the Dao.
The Patriarch sighed, lamenting the rarity of those with immortal potential in the world.

**Poem:**
*Hongdu* teems with people and smoke,
Yet how few worthy talents fit for immortality!
A few grains of elixir cast into the crucible,
A thousand pills of medicine mixed in the pouch.
He bade his disciples hawk them through the streets,
Letting passersby take them at will.
The medicines sold out, the elixir remained—
Not a single one grasped the profound.

**Cangxi Transformation**
The Patriarch heard that a flood dragon was wreaking havoc in *Xin’hao*,
So he took up his sword to hunt and drive it away.
The place he traversed was called *Longquan Abbey*;
now it is renamed *Xianyou*.
The dragon fled into a creek’s cavern—
today it is called *Cangxi*.
The Patriarch inscribed a talisman on a massive boulder
and composed a *Zhenjiao* text to suppress it.
The *Zhenjiao* stele still stands.
Now it is a Buddhist monastery called *Yanzhen*,
with a Daoist abbey of the same name beside it,
ten *li* west of *Fengxin County*.

**Poem:**
Hearing of the venomous flood dragon in *Xin’hao*,
Unseasonably stirring waves and chaos,
The Patriarch wielded his sword to slay it,
While the fiend fled into the creek to hide.
He set down mighty texts to curb its leaping,
Left precious talismans to stifle its roars.
The stele’s clear record endures—
For a thousand ages, people revere his lofty virtue.

**Haihun Transformation**

At that time, above Haihun, there dwelled a monstrous serpent that had claimed a mountain cavern, exhaling qi to form clouds. Whenever its breath spread forty *li*, any humans or livestock caught within it were instantly devoured, none escaping. Even boats on rivers and lakes capsized and sank in its wake, bringing great harm to the people. The Patriarch, upon hearing of this, ascended the summit of the northern ridge to verify the reports—now the site of *Chiwu Abbey* to the east, called *Huixian Peak*. Indeed, he saw the poisonous qi swelling into the sky. Moved by the suffering of the people, he gathered his disciples to slay the beast.

**Poem:**
Poisonous qi stretched across the sky, a serpent’s curse,
For a hundred *li* around Haihun, no homes remained.
It claimed the mountain as its den, stirring winds to power,
Exhaling clouds that blotted out the sun’s brilliance.
Paths were blocked, beasts and livestock swallowed whole,
Rivers and lakes ravaged, boats overturned in its wake.
The Patriarch climbed the ridge to survey the scene,
Disciples united, ready to strike with ease.

**Transformation of the Red Crow**
As they first entered its domain, over three hundred residents from near and far, knowing the Patriarch’s Daoist arts, rushed to plead their grievances, begging for mercy. The Patriarch said: “The cycles of the world’s fortune bring such calamities; the people must endure this trial. I have come precisely for this purpose—to remove this scourge for you. I swear I shall not live in the same age as this serpent.”

Soon, his disciples arrived, all urging him to act. The Patriarch replied: “The time must be right.” He then planted his sword into the earth and silently prayed to Heaven. After a long while, a spring gushed forth, and suddenly a red crow flew past. The Patriarch declared: “Now is the moment.” The place was later named *Houshiguan* (“Observatory of the Hour”), then renamed *Chiwu Abbey* (“Red Crow Abbey”), and is now called *Shousheng* (“Longevity and Sagehood”) or *Guangfu* (“Vast Fortune”).

A poem by Daoist Wan Zhongxing of the present dynasty:
Once a great serpent wielded its venomous might,
Jingyang awaited here to strike it down.
The immortals in the cave obeyed his command,
A divine crow from Heaven announced the hour.
Talismans flew in fury at the valley’s mouth,
Sword-stars clashed, ghosts and gods wept in sorrow.
A thousand years have passed—how many rises and falls?
Yet the boundless merit of his hidden virtue remains.

Zhang Tianjue’s poem *The Planted-Sword Spring*:
The planted sword swiftly became a well beneath the crag,
Waiting for the distant hour when the midday crow stirred.
The last remnants of Haihun’s scourge are now erased,
Yet his blessings endure in the *Seven Tranquilities Chart*.

**Poem:**

The great serpent coiled as a plague, shrouding the land in smoky haze,
As the turning of the world’s fate brought calamity to all.
The Dao’s power was potent—people cried out in grievance,
While the imperial subjects, bereft of fortune, knew only sorrow.
How could such a monstrous evil be tolerated?
Since it had encountered my disciple, it was doomed to be crushed.
The planted sword awaited the hour as if biding its time,
While the crow’s flight and the well’s surge seemed to hasten the moment.

The serpent, struck with fear, retreated into its den.
Then, talismans flew forth to summon the Earth Duke of Haihun to drive it out, but he could not force it forth. Again, they called upon the Earth Lord of Nanchang to assist. The talisman fell east of the county, where an abbey was built and named *Fuluo* (“Fallen Talisman”), now called *Taihe* (“Great Harmony”).

The serpent emerged from its lair, raising its head over ten *zhang* high, its eyes like flaming torches, spewing venom that blotted out the sky. The villagers all clamored and clattered to aid in the battle. At that moment, the Patriarch whistled, commanding wind and thunder, and summoned divine soldiers to subdue the beast, rendering it immobile. Master Wu then leapt forward, trampling its head, and cleaved its skull with his sword. The serpent at last cowered, and his disciples Shi Cen, Gan Zhan, and others brandished their blades to strike.

A poem:
Talismans flew in succession, summoning the earth spirits to drive it forth,
Its serpentine head reared a hundred *zhang* high.
Its eyes flashed like lightning, mirrors of fire,
Its mouth belched smoke and mist, darkening the clouded thoroughfare.
The villagers clamored, lending their might,
The Dharma Master called forth thunder, eradicating it with utmost sincerity.
Then Master Wu soared forward, trampling with swift steps,
The serpent’s head bowed low, and at last it was slain.

**The Small Serpent Transformed**
From the serpent’s ruptured belly emerged a smaller serpent, several *zhang* in length. Gan wished to slay it, but the Patriarch said, “It has not yet wrought harm—it cannot be wantonly executed.” The small serpent, terrified, fled six or seven *li*, and though it heard the clamor of drums, it turned back to listen, gazing longingly at its mother. Today, the place is named *Shezigang* (“Serpent Child Port”) and *Qili Ting* (“Seven-*Li* Listening”).

The disciples pleaded to pursue and kill it, but the Patriarch replied, “If this serpent brings harm to the people five hundred years hence, it shall be slain again. The pine before my altar will serve as proof—when its branches cover the altar and sweep the ground, that will be the time.” He also foretold: “One thousand two hundred and forty years after my departure as an immortal, within the borders of Yuzhang and the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals shall emerge. Their master will arise in Yuzhang, greatly propagating my teachings. When a sandbar suddenly appears in the heart of the prefectural river, blocking the mouth of the Sand Well, that will be the sign.” This is recorded in the *Songsha Ji* (“Record of the Pine and Sand”).

The *Shilongsha* (“Stone Dragon Sandbar”) lies on the western bank of the Zhang River, facing the prefectural city. Pan Qingyi’s poem *Gazing at the Dragon Sandbar* reads:
Innumerable souls dwell in the Five Mounds,
Attentively watching the *Songsha Ji*.
Though the pine and sand have not yet merged,
Their aura is already wondrous and strange.
Once, dragons rinsed their jaws here,
Now half the land is mulberry and hemp.
The terrain winds with the river’s flow,
The isles float in unbroken succession.
If this small serpent ever brings harm,
Those eight hundred immortals shall surely slay it.
But if it harms no living thing,
It must not be executed.
The serpent child then entered the river. The *Shezigang* in Jianchang County marks the spot. A temple stands on Mount Wu in Xinjian County, highly efficacious. In the present dynasty, it was enfeoffed as *Lingshun Zhaoying Anji Huize Wang* (“Responsive and Auspicious Spirit of Numinous Favor, King of Peaceful Aid and Beneficent Blessings”), commonly called the *Dragon Temple*.

**The Great Serpent’s Death**
After the great serpent perished, its bones gathered to form an isle, now called *Longgu Zhou* (“Dragon Bone Isle”).

A poem:
Though the serpent child fled and its mother died,
From afar, it still turned back at the sound of drums.
Alas, even vipers may retain filial piety,
Thus the master spared it from harm.
When in later ages it becomes a scourge to the state,
True immortals will surely rise to strike it down with thunder.
The Dragon Sandbar drifts far as the river’s currents rush—
This was once the very place where its bones amassed.

**The Seven Tranquilities Transformed**
Wherever the Patriarch passed through Haihun, he left behind altars and wells—six in total, including the site of the *Hour-Awaiting* abbey, making seven. Their layout mirrored the Dipper’s form, serving to suppress future calamities. The *Seven Tranquilities* are: *Jinhua Jing* (“Advancing Transformation”), *Yuzou Jing* (“Imperial Memorial”), *Danfu Jing* (“Cinnabar Talisman”), *Huabiao Jing* (“Floriate Pillar”), *Ziyang Jing* (“Purple Yang”), *Huoyang Jing* (“Flourishing Yang”), and *Liuqi Jing* (“Flowing Qi”). Today, some have become abbeys, temples, or official residences.

Later, in the northwest of the county, he came upon a mountain spring, pure and cool. He cast a talisman into its waters, which then cured the people’s ailments as effectively as the Shu River. It is now called *Lingshui Tai* (“Numinous Water Terrace”).

The great serpent slain, its venomous blood fouled the blade. Thereupon he honed and cleansed it, and carved stone to test its edge. To this day, in Jianchang County stand the *Grinding Sword Pool* and the *Sword-Testing Stone*.

He addressed his disciples: “Though the great serpent is destroyed, the dragon-spirit remains unvanquished. That being is numinous—it must know my intent to eradicate harm. I fear it may seize an opportunity to breach the commandery walls. Shall I return to the commandery?” Zhan and Cen, the two disciples, followed him. This was in the sixth year of Yongjia.

A poem says:
*The sea-washed serpent of Haihun has met its doom,*
*Yet lingering evils still elude the broom.*
*Grinding the blade, its edge on stone was tried,*
*Into the spring a talisman was cast to cure the tide.*
*The Master sank the Well of Righteousness, its bounty spread,*
*The people thrived where numinous altars rose instead.*
*Seven Tranquilities he founded where he trod,*
*Now immortal halls stand, honoring the Dao and god.*

**The Charcoal Woman’s Transformation**
The Master’s arts were wondrous, his fame resounding far and near. Hundreds sought to become his disciples, but none could be turned away. So he transformed charcoal into a beautiful woman and, by night, dispersed her among his followers to test them. At dawn, only ten remained unstained by desire—these were the very disciples who later ascended as immortals. Thereafter, whenever he journeyed through rivers and lakes to slay dragons or behead serpents, they unfailingly accompanied him. The rest, shamed, departed of their own accord. Today, at Xijin in Jianchang County stands the *Charcoal Woman’s Market*, and a temple named *Miaoming*.

**Verse:**
The Master’s arts stood peerless in the world,
From near and far, hundreds came to enroll.
To pass the golden immortals’ lofty lore,
He tested all his guests with the Charcoal Maid of yore.
Bewitched by rouge and pleasure’s fleeting sway,
They stained themselves with soot ere break of day.
Ashamed, they scattered—none dared stay behind,
Save eleven true ones, the loftiest of kind.

**The Transformation at Hengquan**
The Master then returned to the prefecture with Lords Gan and Shi, surveying the city and its surrounds. There, a youth of striking beauty, half-grown, appeared in splendid robes. He introduced himself as surnamed Shen, his manners earnest and reverent, his responses swift and keen, before abruptly taking his leave.

The Master said to his disciples: “That was no man—it was the essence of an ancient flood dragon, come to test us. Though his form was fair, a rank wind clung to him. I feigned ignorance to draw out his foul kin.” Tracking his path, they found him by the river, transformed into a yellow ox upon the sands of the outer prefecture’s dunes. This is the place now called *Great Yellow Ox Isle*.

The Master then cut paper to fashion a black ox and sent it forth, commanding Shi Cen to conceal himself with a sword and strike when the beast was fully engrossed. Lord Shi’s blade found its mark, cleaving the ox’s thigh. Wounded, it fled into a well south of the city. The well is named *Hengquan*, and today lies in the southeast corner of Shanglan Temple, its mouth sealed by a wall—thus it is also called *Jiao Well*.

**Verse:**
The Master’s Daoist eye could none deceive,
Yet the dragon’s guile dared to spy and thieve.
How could such audacity go unchecked?
Its fate was sealed by the sword’s perfect reckoning.

Though discourse and idle talk may fill the streets,
No stench or foul miasma could sway his will.
Scarcely had the beast settled into slumber,
When the divine ox’s might left it spent and still.
A single stroke of the sacred blade—its left thigh gashed,
Into Hengquan’s depths it fled, yet pursuit was sworn.

Pursuing the dragon’s transformation, the Master dispatched talismans to trace its trail. They learned it had journeyed straight to Changsha, emerging in human form from the well of Jia Yi. There, it entered the household of Magistrate Jia Yu. Earlier, the dragon-spirit had admired the beauty of Yu’s daughter and, assuming the guise of a young scholar, sought an audience. Yu, greatly taken by his talent, betrothed his daughter to him. Through lavish gifts to Yu’s trusted confidants, all sang his praises, and the marriage was soon sealed. For years they dwelt together, bearing two sons. Each spring and summer, he would depart alone, roaming rivers and lakes like a merchant, only to return in autumn aboard a massive raft laden with treasures. In truth, he plundered the wreckage of ships sunk in the spring floods. That autumn, upon his return, he deceived Yu, claiming bandits had robbed him of his wealth and wounded his left thigh. The entire household lamented, seeking physicians to heal him.

**Verse:**

The dragon-spirit fled into Hengquan, admiring the Jia family of Changsha and forging a marital bond. By long-accrued destiny, two sons were born, yet this union had not endured many years. Each time he returned home bearing treasures, he had in truth plundered ships wrecked upon rivers and lakes. When his divine sword struck and the wound would not heal, he feigned banditry and returned empty-handed.

At Zhaotan, the Patriarch, disguised as a physician, called upon Yu. Delighted, Yu summoned his son-in-law to seek treatment. The dragon-spirit sensed danger and dared not emerge, so Yu himself rose to fetch him. The Patriarch followed to the hall and thundered, "You river-and-lake dragon-spirit have harmed many—how can I, having traced you here, allow you to escape? Come forth at once!" Cornered, the dragon-spirit revealed its true form, coiling beneath the hall, where it was slain by the officers and soldiers. The Patriarch sprinkled its two sons with dharma-water, and they too transformed into young dragons, both put to death. Jia’s daughter nearly changed form as well, but her parents pleaded in sorrow, and the Patriarch gave them a divine talisman to prevent her transformation.

The Patriarch told Yu, "Beneath the dragon-spirit’s dwelling lies water. Now, mere feet below your home surge vast waves. Move quickly, lest you court disaster." Yu’s entire household, terrified, relocated to high ground. Soon after, the land sank into an abyssal pool—today’s Zhaotan in Changsha.

**Verse:**
The master brought medicine through Hunan’s lakes,
Jia Yu, hearing, invited him to speak.
At once the dragon-spirit trembled in fear,
Urging tiger-like officers to dispel its dread.
Its form slain beneath the steps, the clan aghast,
Water’s spell in the hall transformed the two sons.
The evil banished, they moved to lofty ground—
Soon that place became a fathomless deep.

**Subduing the Dragon’s Transformation**
The Patriarch returned to Yuzhang, where the dragon’s remaining kin thrived. Fearing his wrath, they grew restless and, assuming human guise, wandered the city. They sought out the Patriarch’s disciples and deceived them, saying, "I hail from Chang’an, where my family has long revered virtue. I have heard of Master Xu’s divine sword and wish to learn of its power." A disciple replied, "Our master’s sword can cleave the heavens, split the earth, disrupt the stars’ course, and reverse rivers’ flow. No evil can withstand it—it is a treasure of the divine." The dragon asked, "Is there nothing it cannot harm?" The disciple jested, "Only winter melons and gourds." Taking this as truth, the dragon transformed its entire brood into gourds and winter melons, their vines and tendrils floating upon the river, drifting toward the border.

At dawn, the Patriarch sensed the surge of malevolent qi. Gazing upon the river, he saw the dragon’s ruse and handed his sword to Shi Cen, commanding him to tread the waters and strike. The entire brood, roots and all, was annihilated, turning the river’s flow murky. The Patriarch declared, "This place harbors a dragon’s lair. Without a means to suppress it, the beast will return to plague humanity, and none will restrain it." He then commanded spirits and gods to forge an iron pillar at the well south of the yamen, its shaft rising several feet above ground, its base anchored by eight chains to bind the earth’s veins. This is the iron pillar of Yanzhen Temple today. He invoked, "If the iron pillar bends, the evil will rise again, and I shall return. If it stands straight, the evil is forever vanquished." Thus, the water demons were quelled, and the city knew peace.

Fearing future treachery, he inscribed the pillar with a prophecy: *"Where the land prevails, the human heart responds with goodness—no villainy shall arise. Even if schemes are hatched, they shall come to naught."* Such was the Patriarch’s foresight for posterity.

**Verse:**
The river’s dragon kin stirred deep unease,
Inquiring of the sword’s might to evade doom.
A blade of frost could cleave five stones—
How could it spare gourds and melons?
Their forms sought escape with the current,
Yet trodden waters brought swift slaughter.
Seeing the dragon’s lair still smoldered,
He left an iron pillar to guard Hongdu.

*Record of the Eighty-Five Transformations of Patriarch Xu of West Mountain, Volume Two*

**Master Yongwu of West Mountain, Shi Cen’s Compilation**

**The Alchemy of Paper Money**
When the Patriarch sought the flying thatch, he crossed the Xiao Shu River, offering two hundred coins to the boatman as recompense. The boatman repeatedly demanded more, insisting on a thousand, to which the Patriarch assented. Upon disembarking, the boatman returned home with the money, only to find but two rings—all else had transformed into paper ingots. Struck with awe, he realized the Patriarch was a divine being. To this day, when the immortal’s carriage passes by, boatmen ask only for two small coins, daring not to seek more.

**Verse:**
In search of flying thatch, he wandered far,
By Shu’s green willows, he hailed the ferry’s oar.
Waves stilled, the broad shore calmed the clamor’s din,
As wind and tide bowed, travelers gazed within.
Two slips of coin the Patriarch first bestowed,
Yet how did the boatman demand a thousand’s load?
Had not the paper ingots wrought their sacred art,
How could the boatman’s greed reverse its part?

**The Transformation of Yao Lake**
In Xinjian County, the sighing drought lake teemed with leeches. The Patriarch cast a single grain of medicine into its waters, and the leeches vanished forever. Henceforth, it was named Yao Lake.

**Verse:**
Lake’s gleam, resplendent, kissed the azure sky,
Where writhing leeches thrived in grasses high.
One pellet of elixir cast upon the tide,
Banished the bloodsuckers, all pests defied.
Waves cradled the moon’s pale glow, reeds turned white,
Surges faced the sunset, shores burned crimson bright.
Gazing o’er the cloud-waves, no venomous shade,
As the immortal’s path winds east and west, unmade.

**The Transformation of Song Lake**
At the Miaodong of Song Lake Market, the Patriarch once rested briefly. To this day, no mosquitoes or gnats trouble that household.

**Verse:**
Song Lake’s inn, fragrant as orchid and aster,
Welcomed travelers with ease and leisure.
Merchants now halt their steeds upon the way,
As once the Patriarch’s simurgh came to stay.
Where mosquito’s drone is stilled, the bed lies still,
Butterfly dreams rise, the pillow knows no ill.
The post road’s crows hasten twilight’s descent,
As clattering carriages loose their harness, spent.

**The Transformation of Suo Cave**

**The Transformation of the Fengcheng Needle Cave**

At the Needle Cave of Fengcheng County, a flood dragon once entered and was sealed within by a wooden peg of *miao* wood. To this day, the peg remains unrotted.

**Verse:**
Ancient trees and verdant vines lock the stone gate,
Deep in the mountains, secluded, the mists ever dim.
No auspicious cranes come to roost,
But rumors tell of a malevolent dragon’s lair.
At times, torrents surge, drowning fields,
Daily, villagers fear its venomous miasma.
The Patriarch sealed the Needle Cave,
And the *miao* peg endures through the years.

**The Transformation of the Immortal Pigeon**

In the second year of *Taining* under Emperor Ming of Jin, the Grand General Wang Dun, styled Chuzhong, raised troops and marched inward, halting at the lake. The Patriarch and Master Wu went together to pay their respects, hoping to persuade him to desist. At the time, Guo Pu was already in the general’s camp, and they entered together to meet him.

Chuzhong welcomed them with wine and asked, “I dreamed of a tree splitting the sky. What do you make of this, gentlemen?”

The Patriarch replied, “It is no auspicious omen.”

Master Wu said, “A tree splitting the sky yet unfinished—you must not act rashly.”

Chuzhong’s expression darkened, and he ordered Guo Pu to divine the outcome. Pu said, “It will not succeed.”

Chuzhong grew displeased. “How long is my lifespan?”

Pu replied, “If you raise arms, disaster will come swiftly. But if you return to Wuchang, your years may yet be immeasurable.”

Chuzhong demanded, “And how long is *your* lifespan?”

Pu answered, “My life ends at noon today.”

Enraged, Chuzhong ordered his guards to seize and behead Pu. As recorded in *The Biographies of Cave Immortals*, Pu had already instructed his family to prepare his funeral rites at the execution site. His grave was set between two pines by the riverbank. Three days later, people in the southern market saw Pu selling his garments, speaking with acquaintances as if alive. When Chuzhong heard this, he refused to believe it and opened the coffin—only to find it empty. Thus, Pu had achieved *shijie* (corpse liberation) and now serves as an immortal lord of the water palace.

The Patriarch then raised his cup and cast it into the air, where it transformed into a white wagtail, circling the beams. When Chuzhong looked up again, the two masters had vanished. Chuzhong ultimately met defeat. Overcome by remorse and rage, he died, and his corpse was later subjected to the punishment of *sai shi* (facial mutilation).

**Verse:**
Though the Jin house lay broken, Heaven still upheld it,
The traitorous minister rebelled against his sovereign, defying the imperial capital.

Seeking righteous men to fulfill Yuan’s dream,
Who could have known the treacherous harbored other schemes?
By chance he shared temper and mind with Wang Dun,
Thus Guo Pu was doomed to lose his life.
The cast cup transformed into a wagtail, soaring through the beams,
As all eyes strained to watch, Xu and Wu vanished from sight.

The Patriarch and Lord Hao then returned to Jinling, intending to hire a boat to Yuzhang. The boatman, however, claimed he lacked a helmsman. The Patriarch said: *"Simply close your eyes and sit in peace—do not peek. I shall steer for you."* He then summoned two dragons to bear the vessel forward, passing through Chiyang where he pressed his seal into the western cliffside to ward off water spirits. The imprint remains to this day. The boat gradually ascended into the air, soon soaring over the summit of Mount Lu to the Golden Palace Grotto of Purple Cloud Peak. As the Patriarch and Lord Hao wished to explore the cave, the stern of the boat grazed the treetops with a grating sound. The boatmen could not resist and stole a glance—whereupon the dragons abandoned the vessel upon a towering peak, snapping the mast into a deep ravine. Both turned to iron and stone: the peak is now called Stone Peak, and the mast lies broken in the gorge.

The Patriarch addressed the boatmen: *"You disobeyed my words—where will you now return?"* The boatmen knelt and begged for salvation. The Patriarch taught them to ingest sacred herbs, enabling them to fast and never die, and they all concealed themselves within this mountain. Later, Prefect Yi of Jiangzhou sent men to inquire about the wonders of Mount Lu. Arriving at Purple Cloud Peak, they saw a boat upon the lake and a flock of cranes with red-scaled creatures, while a man riding a white horse and two youths let out long whistles audible for hundreds of paces—suspected to be the boatmen’s company. The Patriarch and Lord Hao, each riding a dragon, parted ways by water and land, reuniting at Heavenly Treasure Grotto on the Northern Ridge.

**Verse:**
Jinling far from distant Yuzhang,
No oarsmen to ferry them along.
Secretly he summoned twin dragons to bear the load,
Aspiring to traverse a thousand leagues on the whirlwind’s road.
Startled by the rustling trees, they glimpsed the silver sea,
Thus the ship was marooned in Purple Cloud’s spire.
The crew entreated the master for deliverance,
Who taught them to fast on sacred herbs and transcend desire.

**Poyang and Xunyang:**
The Patriarch, concerned that creatures like jiao and shen had scattered into Poyang and Xunyang commanderies and might return, traversed the rivers and lakes to exterminate them. Atop Dangyao Mountain, three jiao lakes were found, their caverns piercing the great river and linking to Rao and Xin. The Patriarch slew the jiao demons and established Jade Yang Prefecture Altar to pacify the site. At the northwestern cove beneath the stone cliffs, he established Kaihua Altar to secure the region. He further established Tai Cheng Prefecture Altar, beside which lay a vast marsh, fathomless and teeming with jiao and their kin. The Patriarch annihilated them all, save for one jiao fledgling—hence the altar was raised to block its escape. He also cast an iron talisman to seal the mouth of Poyang Lake, barring their entry. It remains today in the river at Shangzhong County. He cast an iron lid to cover Yuan Pool in Luling, suppressing their lair, and set an iron talisman to guard it—now called Flying Talisman Ridge, where the Chongzhen Abbey stands. A sword was left there, a foot and a handspan in length, resembling jade or stone, yet also like bronze or iron, its nature unknown to all.

The following year—Yongjia the seventh—he journeyed again to Changsha, then on to Shaoyang.

The following year, he traveled to the various prefectures of Bang and Heng, where in every place he arrived, he sincerely dispelled poisons and eradicated harms for the people. He then returned to Yuzhang, having established in total over seventy prefectural altars, all serving to suppress disasters and ward off misfortune for the commanderies and counties.

A poem reads:
*Jiao spirits scattered, drifting into Po and Xun,*
*Lest in years to come their calamity return again.*
*Through Rao and Xin, the paths stretch far,*
*By Dangyao’s peaks, the hidden lakes run deep.*
*The talisman seals the clam-monsters’ route,*
*The lid covers the glass-demons, their lair cut off.*
*Later, the Master journeyed to Jing and Guang,*
*Leaving once more a precious sword to guard the pool’s heart.*

**Virtue of Broad Transformation**
The Patriarch’s transformative influence extended throughout the lands of Jiangzuo and the regions north and south of Dongting Lake. The abbeys, prefectural altars, and sacred enclosures he established were beyond count, some scattered in remote mountains, forests, lakes, and marshes—places of extraordinary seclusion. By the side of Longsha, for instance, lies the Sword-Grinding Pool, which to this day remains unobstructed.

A poem reads:
*Malevolence and disasters, the Master strove to dispel,*
*His traces spread across rivers and lakes, wide as the land.*
*Three thousand deeds of sagely merit brought to completion,*
*Over seventy sacred sites of governance were raised.*
*He sought to let the common folk rest in peace,*
*Every commandery and county he passed through found repose.*
*At Longsha, traces of his presence still remain,*
*The Sword-Grinding Pool, clear as a jade flask, gleams.*

**Transformation of the Flowery Chariot**
In Jing’an County lived the Immortal Maiden Liu, whose given name was Yizhen. Though she had lived for several centuries, her appearance remained that of a child. The Lady Shen once spoke of her in praise. When the Patriarch went to visit, she had already ascended in flight.

Thus he left behind the precious *Flowery Chariot* of wondrous wood, which, borne by the wind, soared for three days before descending. The abbey was named *Flowery Chariot Abbey*; its stele still stands, and it is now called *Handle-of-the-Rosy-Clouds Abbey*.

A poem reads:
*Maiden Liu’s Dao-cultivation spread far and deep,*
*Lady Shen of the Yellow Hall often praised her.*
*Her spirit refined, her years matched the crane’s,*
*Her bearing pure as ice, her demeanor lofty.*
*Yet when the Patriarch came to pay his respects,*
*How could he know the immortal matron had already ascended?*
*Only the precious wooden Flowery Chariot remains,*
*The abbey at Handle-of-the-Rosy-Clouds stands as the world’s witness.*

**Transformation of the Reclusive Return**
The Patriarch then returned to his former retreat, where for decades he discoursed daily with his disciples on the true essence of the Dao, no longer concerning himself with worldly affairs, dedicating himself solely to the perfection of the supreme Way. He composed the *"Song of Drunken Longing for Immortals"* and set forth the *Eight Precious Teachings*, which are: loyalty, filial piety, integrity, prudence, magnanimity, abundance, tolerance, and forbearance.

*Loyalty precludes deceit; filial piety averts rebellion; integrity shuns greed; prudence prevents error—thus cultivating the self leads to the completion of virtue.*
*Magnanimity wins the multitude; abundance leaves surplus; tolerance embraces all; forbearance brings ease—thus engaging others dissolves resentment and blame.*

*"All my disciples, in movement and stillness, must be diligent and sincere, ever mindful of these precepts. Guard your solitude, for if your heart strays, the Three Officials shall examine and punish you."*

The villages and towns he transformed all turned toward goodness and shunned wrongdoing; filial piety and fraternal duty flourished. In his daily comings and goings, he responded to circumstances no differently than an ordinary man, yet wherever he dwelled, cranes cried and soared, and auspicious clouds swirled about his thatched hut.

Since the chaos of the Eastern Jin’s upheavals had repeatedly ravaged the lands east of the Yangtze, within a hundred *li* of the Patriarch’s abode, bandits dared not intrude, villages enjoyed peace, harvests were plentiful year after year, and the people suffered no calamities. His blessings extended to all living beings, though none could fathom the reason.

A poem reads:
*Rivers and lakes, Shu and Han—his travels spanned them all,*
*Returning, he discoursed at length on profound truths.*
*He guided the common folk with precious teachings,*
*Perfected the supreme Way, and composed immortal songs.*
*Auspicious clouds billowed around his thatched hut,*
*Black cranes soared and cried among the trees.*
*Though the Eastern Jin’s chaos raged unceasing,*
*Within a hundred *li* of his dwelling, all was peace.*

**Transformation of Gold and Jade**
While the Patriarch dwelled in reclusion on West Mountain, an alchemist came, transmuting copper and iron into gold and stone into jade, seeking to sell his method. The Patriarch asked, *"Will these not revert?"* The alchemist replied, *"After five hundred years, they will return to their original forms."* The Patriarch said, *"This would surely mislead later generations,"* and ultimately refused to accept it.

A poem reads:

Amidst the secluded depths of Yanran’s mountain forests,
An alchemist, bearing rare arts, came seeking the Patriarch.
With buried stones, he breathed and transformed them into lustrous jade;
With stubborn copper, he transmuted it into enduring gold.
How could such profit-driven craft breed avarice?
How might wealth corrupt the heart of the Way?
Had the Patriarch not steadfastly refused,
Future generations would have borne deep regret.

**The Celestial Edict**

In the second year of Ningkang of Emperor Xiaowu’s reign, the *jiayin* year, the Patriarch was one hundred thirty-six years old. On the first day of the eighth month, a cloud-borne procession descended from the heavens—two immortals led the grand cortege, alighting in the Patriarch’s courtyard. The Patriarch descended the steps to receive them with reverence. The two immortals declared, *"By the Jade Emperor’s decree, we present you with this edict."*

The Patriarch prostrated himself to listen as the edict was proclaimed:
*"The Supreme Edict is addressed to the immortal disciple Xu Sun: In countless kalpas past, you have cultivated the supreme Dao with tireless diligence, mastering its profound intricacies. Of the ten thousand methods and thousand gates, none have you not traversed as a master. You have rescued the suffering, dispelled calamities, eradicated harm, and vanquished demons—your merit has succored living beings, and your name is exalted in the Jade Register. The host of immortals reveres you; thus, you are deemed worthy of promotion. You are hereby appointed Supreme Envoy of the Nine Provinces, Grand Historian of the Immortals, and Illustrious Minister of High Clarity. We bestow upon you a purple robe of feathered splendor, a banner of jade and a scepter of precious stone, a vial of jade elixir, and a measure of golden cinnabar. Upon receipt of this decree, you shall comply accordingly."*

The Patriarch bowed twice, ascended the steps, and received the edict. One immortal declared, *"I am Cui Ziwen, the Jade Perfected Lord."* The other announced, *"I am Xiaqiu Zhong, the Primordial Perfected Minister."* With these words, they bowed to the Patriarch and informed him of the day of his ascension before mounting their cloud chariot and departing.

A poem reads:
The autumn air was crisp, the sky serene,
From the nine heavens descended the immortal procession to the jade capital.
The Patriarch still humbly deemed his merits meager,
Yet the celestial sovereigns afar knew his Way was perfected.
Crimson scepters and precious banners lauded his great virtue;
Jade elixir and golden pills preserved his eternal life.
One Perfected revealed the day of his ascension—
A flock of simurghs and cranes, the host of spirits, all came to welcome him.

**Transmission of Teachings**

The Patriarch then summoned his disciples and the elders of his hometown to announce his departure date. From that day forward, they gathered morning and evening at the Patriarch’s residence, holding feasts daily to cherish their parting moments. He taught them the principles of cultivating goodness and accumulating merit to attain the Dao of immortality, and composed works such as the *Lingjianzi*. He also composed ten five-line, two-rhyme poems of admonition for each of his eleven disciples, leaving them as teachings for the world. Furthermore, he transmitted the formula for the *Dayi Ruyi Dan* (Great Merit Wish-Fulfilling Elixir) to those disciples who would not ascend with him—a formula that was one of Ding Yifang’s methods. The instructions required first selecting an auspicious day for purification rites, setting up an altar to invoke the spirits of the eighteen medicinal ingredients, then inscribing talismans, reciting incantations for each herb, and compounding the elixir. Its efficacy in curing all ailments was immediate and as desired.

A poem reads:
The immortal’s ascent had its appointed day,
Feasts were laid to gather elders of the town.
With joy, the elders raised their cups of wine,
While master and disciples, hearts full, composed their verse.
The healing arts brought boundless grace to all,
Scriptures left behind taught mercy and compassion.
Though parting stirred deep sorrow, they urged one another:
To do good and perform deeds is the foundation of the Way.

**Ascension**

On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a grand purification rite was held, and all the villagers, young and old, were summoned to assemble. At noon, distant strains of celestial music were heard, and auspicious clouds filled the sky. Soon, they drew near to the gathering place: a dragon-drawn chariot with feathered canopies, flanked by attending officials and guards, immortal youths and maidens processing before and behind, crimson radiance and purple mists swirling all around. The two envoys who had come before arrived once more.

The Patriarch descended the steps to bow in welcome. The two immortals again proclaimed the decree: *"By imperial edict, the immortal student Xu Xun is absolved of his past-life sins of greed, killing, and neglecting ancestral rites. His present-life merits—chanting incantations over water, wielding talismans to heal the sick, punishing evil, and expelling poison—are recorded. The Controller of Life of Mount Qian has been commanded to transmit the Golden Elixir to the mortal realm, sealing his karmic debts and transforming his body. His entire household, kitchen, and dwelling, along with all possessions, shall return to the Three Heavens. Purify yourself, leave the earth, and ascend into the void. The Great Might Heavenly Ding on your left, the Flowing Gold Fire Bells, and the Central Yellow Mother shall illuminate your path, dispelling all hindrances. Your distant ancestors are also ennobled: your great-great-grandfather, the Jade Void Attendant; your great-grandfather, the Grand Master of the Grand Tenuity; your grandfather, the Grand Guardian of the Grand Ultimate; your father, the Registrar of Merit and Deeds; and your residence is bestowed the title of Left Mansion of the Immortal Court by the Celestial Official of Mount Song."*

The Jade Perfected Lord said, *"Though your disciples are many, only six may accompany you. The rest shall each have their own day of transcendence and may not join you."* With that, he bowed to the Patriarch, who then mounted the dragon chariot. Chen Xun carried the imperial tally to lead the way, Zhou Guang and Zeng Heng drove the chariot, Huang Renlan followed alongside, while his father’s clan and attendants, Xu Lie and his mother’s retinue—forty-two members of his immortal household—ascended together, even the parrot and dog soaring in their wake.

The villagers, clinging in sorrow and prostrate with grief, wailed at the unbearable parting. The Patriarch said, *"The paths of immortals and mortals diverge, and sorrow is natural. But if you uphold filial piety and kindness, revering Heaven and Earth, how can you fear there will be no reward?"* He left behind a bronze bell and a stone casket, saying, *"When the world changes and the times shift, this place will become a frontier. Let these serve as tokens for future generations."*

As the immortal procession ascended, a mortar and a chariot hub soon fell to the ground, and a parrot cage descended some ten *li* southeast of the residence—where Chongyuan Abbey now stands. Several mice also fell, their entrails dragging yet still alive, for they had secretly consumed the immortal elixir. Later, some claimed to have seen them, deeming it an auspicious omen.

The immortal chariot soared into the distant sky, vanishing from sight, though auspicious clouds and radiant mists filled the valleys for a hundred *li*, their fragrant aroma lingering for months.

A poem reads:
The cinnabar-sealed decree hastened his ascent,
Feathered canopies and fragrant chariots drew jade dragons.
The village held a purification rite, offering the last feast,
Celestial music played as phoenix flutes and reed pipes soared.
The Immortal Court bestowed honor upon his dwelling,
Sacred titles exalted his ancestors.
The entire household rose to Heaven,
Leaving behind a few relics to mark his traces.

**Transformation of the Brocade Curtain**

After the Patriarch returned from Jingyang, he presented a bolt of Shu brocade to Mistress Chen as a token of his transmission of the Dao. She fashioned it into a curtain for the temple hall. On this day, it suddenly took flight, circling above the former residence before ascending into the clouds. Later, an abbey was built there, named *Youwei* ("Wandering Curtain") in its honor.

A poem reads:
Mistress Chen’s boundless grace was no mere marvel,
The Patriarch’s brocade tribute was given without fail.

Shamed were it to serve as bedding for lesser scholars,
Fitting it is to grace the halls of lofty transcendents.
Once the immortal abode departed this world,
Only the sacred relic drifted, circling the empty skies.
All day it danced and whirled above the clouds,
Then was once more borne away by celestial spirits.

**Transformation of the Parasol Tree**

The son of Prefect Wang, named Shuo, welcomed the Patriarch to reside in the Western Pavilion. After some time, the Patriarch said to Shuo, "I see that you are worthy to receive my arts." He secretly transmitted the immortal formulae, adding, "This place boasts elegant mountains and rivers, with a numinous spring flowing south of the Dao. Facing a grotto-heaven and overlooking the Yuan River, it is most suitable for a Daoist abbey." Shuo followed his counsel. The Patriarch then inscribed a talisman of the character *jing* upon the door of the lodge and departed. This was the time when the Patriarch and Guo Pu sought the true and selected the sublime, arriving at Bingwu Mountain in Yichun.

On the day of his ascension, cloud-cakes drifted overhead, and two azure-clad attendants descended to inform Shuo that the Jade Emperor had summoned him, and thus he came to bid farewell. Shuo and his entire household gazed in reverence, praying for salvation. The Patriarch leaned down and said, "Your bones are not yet ripe for transcendence, but you may prolong your years." He then bestowed a single stalk of flying immortal grass, saying, "This grass has a wondrous flavor. Planted here and consumed over time, it grants longevity. Its sweetness nourishes the flesh, its pungency the joints, its bitterness the hair, its saltiness the bones, its slipperiness the skin, and its sourness the sinews. Blend it with bitter wine and consume it—it will surely prove efficacious." With these words, he departed. Thereafter, the Wang clan followed his instructions, consuming the elixir, and each lived to a hundred years.

A poem reads:

In days of old, seeking truth, I once visited the Cassia Tree’s shade;
Prince Wang invited me to rest in his grand abode.
The mountains and rivers, fair and bright, graced the Daoist cloister,
While refined figures and noble men were praised in celestial writ.

Now I depart the world to heed the cinnabar summons,
Halting my jeweled carriage amid the clouds.
I entrust this immortal grass for planting and consumption—
May your household all live beyond a hundred years.

**Founding of the Ancestral Shrine**
After the Patriarch’s ascension, the villagers and the Patriarch’s descendant, Jian, established a shrine on that site. They inscribed the one hundred twenty poems he had left onto bamboo slips, placed them in a large bamboo tube, and allowed people to draw them for divination, calling them "Sacred Lots." The well, mortar, and pestle were all enshrined within the shrine. Later, the shrine was converted into an abbey, named after the brocade banner and the well. The people of Shu’s Jianyang, competing to offer gold and silk, carried jars and flasks to the altar and well in gratitude, each carving their names upon them. When the people of Shu later rebuilt the palace, the original structures were dismantled, though some remnants remain today. During Emperor Yang of Sui’s reign, renovations ceased midway, and the abbey fell into ruin. In the Yongchun era of the Tang, Celestial Master Hu Huichao revived and rebuilt it, and Emperor Minghuang bestowed special veneration. Emperors Taizong, Zhenzong, and Renzong of our dynasty all granted imperial calligraphy; Zhenzong further dispatched envoys to present incense, candles, floral brocades, banners, and dancing puppets, renaming it "Yulong Abbey," derived from the *Scripture of Salvation’s* phrase "Yulong soars to the heavens in triumph." Timber felling on the sacred mountain was prohibited, taxes and levies were remitted, and an official was appointed to oversee it, making it a place of honor for venerable ministers.

A poem reads:
The Patriarch’s dragon chariot has already soared to heaven,
The village shrine reveres the ranks of immortals.
The great bamboo holds the sacred lots, their poems profound,
The ancient mortar and pestle remain near at hand.
Rebuilt first by the august Tang,
Now splendidly adorned under the sacred Song.
The abbey renamed Yulong, taxes and corvée lifted—
May its incense and prayers endure forever.

**Imperial Enfeoffment**
*Edict of Offering and Canonization from Emperor Huizong*

In the second year of Zhenghe, cyclical year *renchen*, fifth month, *dingsi* day marking the new moon, the seventeenth day *guiyou*, the Emperor, in his august name, respectfully dispatched Cheng Qi of the Inner Court’s Palace Eunuch Service to invite twenty-one Daoist priests to Hongzhou’s Yulong Abbey to conduct a seven-day and night ritual. On the day of its conclusion, a grand offering of three hundred sixty positions was held. We hereby invoke the Perfected Lord of Wondrous Merit and Salvation. Though the supreme spirit’s primordial form defies naming, its accomplished virtue among men warrants the title bestowed. We now confer this august appellation, humbly presenting it in hope of receiving blessings, eternally securing this blessed land. The Emperor, in his august name, prostrates in utmost sincerity and reverence, offering this prayer.

*Imperial Edict of Canonization for the Patriarch*

Your servant, in his august name, bows in devotion to the lofty Perfected One, who first revealed his wondrous traces. Gazing toward the celestial vault, he venerates the numinous realm, bestowing blessings that bring fortune to the people. Pure radiance now bathes the land, extending the realm’s prosperity. Your servant, in his august name, prostrates in utmost sincerity and urgency, humbly presenting this memorial to make known these words. Your servant, in his august name, bows in awe and trepidation, kowtowing to offer this.

*Text of the Jade Edict*

In the second year of Zhenghe, cyclical year *renchen*, fifth month, *dingsi* day marking the new moon, the seventeenth day *guiyou*, the Emperor bows twice and declares: Heaven’s favor is abundant, bestowing grace upon the four directions. There exists a supreme Perfected One who aids the Supreme Emperor, his majestic virtue and radiant power granting prosperity and peace. Yet without a fitting title, how can we properly honor him? We hereby command the relevant officials to examine the secret records, unfolding his legacy for endless posterity.

We reverently consider the Perfected Lord, who grasped the primordial chart and secretly aligned with the wondrous. From the Wei to the Jin dynasties, his lineage flourished with divine brilliance. He relieved famine and waived taxes, aiding the people; he vanquished demons and toxins, bringing peace to the Three Radiant Eras. Thus, he received the celestial mandate, established the register of immortals, and ascended beyond the heavens. Though ages have passed, his temple stands tall, his virtuous influence enduring. As the imperial fortune shines ever brighter, auspicious signs descend, silently aiding the unseen. His responses to prayers and exorcisms bring prosperity to all. We now bestow the most exalted title to honor him. We respectfully dispatch Wang Zhuan, Grand Master for Court Consultation, Compiler of the Hall of Assembled Worthies, Prefect of Hongzhou, Military Commissioner of Hongzhou, Supervisor of Agricultural Affairs within the Circuit, Military Protector of Jiangnan West Circuit, granted the Purple Gold Fish Bag, to confer the title: *Perfected Lord of Wondrous Merit and Salvation*.

May he deign to receive this august decree, bestowing boundless blessings upon us, safeguarding this glorious mandate. May he weave harmony into the realm’s fabric and spread blessings to all. We humbly offer these words.

In the fourth year of Zhenghe, the abbey was elevated to a palace, with "Wanshou" ("Ten Thousand Longevities") added to its name, and the *tiangan* system expanded to encompass the Ten Directions.

A poem reads:
The purple edict newly bestowed, the imperial will resplendent,
Its form in proclamations and edicts extols divine merit.
The imperial brush’s brilliance shines in the celestial script,
Mourning those cloud-borne words that fuse with sun and moon.
His wondrous traces brought blessings to the people,
His august title honored the state with reverence.
Yulong’s sacred ground now grand and majestic—
The imperial decree elevates it to Wanshou Palace.

**Zhenghe’s Transformations**
On the first day of the fifth month in the sixth year of Zhenghe, at the hour of *chen*, an edict bearing the character *Xun* was issued from the imperial presence, entrusted to the Ministry of Rites by the Bureau of Documents.

While We were reading in the Hall of Exalted Governance, We suddenly seemed to dream of a Daoist at the north of the Gate of Gathered Splendor. He wore a nine-flowered crown and a crimson ceremonial robe, while two young attendants at his side, clad in blue, held a sword and whisk. Behind him, two envoys in colored Daoist garb bore an official seal and staff. Approaching the vermilion steps, he bowed with a tablet in hand, then ascended the hall by grasping the left dragon-tail balustrade.

Suspecting he was no mortal, We questioned the Daoist: "Who are you, that you arrive unbidden?"

The Daoist replied: "I am Xu Jingyang, temporarily overseeing the Nine Heavens’ administrative office. The Celestial Emperor has dispatched me to inspect the Western Kingdom of Juye. Passing through this land, I observed baleful qi and thus came to pay a visit."

We invited him to sit and asked: "What is the nature of this affliction?"

He answered: "In an instant, thirty-six thousand bolts of silk tribute from north and south have sunk into the waters—this is the work of a lesser dragon. The previous dynasty erred in enfeoffing this creature as a king. During the Yongjia rebellion, it tore from its mother’s womb and fled, yet spared humanity and was pardoned. Now it has become a scourge upon the state. Upon my return to my post, I shall take measures to ensure it no longer dwells between the Yangzi and Huai rivers."

We expressed our gratitude in the dream and asked again: "We suffer from the Persian sore, and no medicine has cured it. Does the Perfected Lord have a remedy?"

He immediately took a small gourd, poured out a single pill the size of a mung bean, breathed upon it, and applied it to the sore. We felt as though flowing ghee suffused our body, cleansing and cooling to the bone. Then he bowed and departed. After taking several steps, he turned back and said: "My humble abode has long fallen into ruin. We would be most fortunate if Your Sacred Majesty would deign to glance upon it."

We awoke suddenly. Within days, officials reported that the entire shipment of silk tribute had indeed been capsized by wind and waves. Consulting the illustrated classics, We found that in Fennin County of Hongzhou, on Mount Mei, lay the place where the Xu family’s Jingyang had sharpened his sword. We ordered a portrait painted as seen in the dream and bestowed it upon the Chongqing Chuxiang Palace. Soon after, following a memorial from the Daoist Registry, We commanded that a processional palace for the Perfected Lord Xu be constructed behind the Three Clarities Hall. We issued another imperial edict, ordering Minister Xie Jingren to proceed to Fennin County and, together with the local magistrate, use provincial funds to renovate the Xu family’s Jingyang Abbey. We further granted a sacred edict, instructing that upon its completion, the abbey should take charge of its affairs. On the Heavenly Tranquility Festival, one acolyte was to be assigned to its service. Additionally, We ordered an investigation into any other sites associated with the Perfected Lord Xu. If no abbey existed, the local authorities were to use official funds to build one; if any palace or abbey had fallen into disrepair, it was to be restored according to proper standards. If no permanent endowment existed, nearby Buddhist monasteries were to be requisitioned as needed. Any suitable and fertile estates were to be transferred to the abbey for its upkeep, with strict oversight by the appointed administrators.

A poem reads:
The Patriarch, sent to inspect Juye,
Won praise from Emperor Huizong for his devotion to the Dao.

Having earnestly implored the imperial heart to cast its gracious regard, We specially summoned the immortal’s retinue into the Eastern Splendor. The silk gauze had been afflicted by a malevolent dragon, yet the gourd’s medicine healed the imperial person’s blemish. Only because the ancestral homeland had long lain desolate did We deign to restore it, and the result was indeed glorious to behold.

Several months after the abbey’s transformation, the Patriarch appeared again in a dream, as before, and offered thanks, saying: “Fenning is a place where I once walked. Your labor in rebuilding it is deeply felt. I have chosen a site on West Mountain, where my relics remain intact, yet the structures are cramped and unworthy of the gaze of the four directions. I am fortunate that Your Majesty has undertaken this restoration.”

Upon awakening, the Emperor immediately ordered Hongzhou to renovate the Jade Prosperity Abbey of Ten Thousand Longevities, following the model of the Chongfu Abbey in the Western Capital. The reconstruction was to be entirely new, and a statue of the Patriarch was bestowed, along with bronze incense burners, flower vases, candlesticks, bells, and chimes. The Emperor inscribed the names of the two main halls. In all, there were six grand halls, twelve lesser halls, three corridors, seven gates, and five pavilions. The front hall’s three walls depicted the Patriarch’s deeds and virtues, while the rear hall enshrined the jade tablets. Above it stood the Treasure Repository, housing the imperial calligraphy of three reigns. The two flanking walls were painted with the procession of the immortal retinue, and the complex was encircled by walls. To the west of the walls, the former residence of the Perfected Lord Xu was converted into a Daoist cloister to house the Daoist community.

During the Jianyan era, when the Jin invaders ravaged the lands east of the Yangtze, they sought to burn the abbey. Suddenly, water gushed from the pillars, preventing the fire from taking hold. The barbarian chieftain was astonished and inscribed on the wall: *“The Dragon-Tiger General of the Great Jin, having sworn allegiance, was appointed Supreme Commander of the Marshal’s Headquarters. Arriving here, I beheld the sacred images adorned in such splendor that I dared not burn them. Recorded on the second day of the first month of the eighth year of Tianhui.”* He then withdrew his troops. This inscription, though the wall has since crumbled, remains faintly legible.

The poem reads:
To the west of the Jiang’s left lies Western Mountain, a blessed sanctuary,
Its towering palaces and halls outshine Penglai’s fairy isles.
Broad and deep, the gates and corridors turn with the pure breeze,
Lofty and vaulted, the halls and pavilions birth purple mists.
Its grandeur rivals the splendor of Chongfu,
Its scale surpasses the glory of Jianzhang.
Yet in the bingwu year, it suffered war’s flames,
Water dripping from the eaves startled the barbarian horde.

The sacred scriptures—three reigns’ imperial calligraphy, the jade tablets of the Patriarchs—
After the Jin invaders’ raid, their whereabouts remain unknown.

The poem reads:
Heaven and earth overturned in chaos,
The unseen course of time stirred

The Well of the Patriarch’s Elixir-Crafting, where dragons once appeared and vanished—Hu Dongzhen first placed talismanic stones to suppress them.

The poem reads:
A golden well, its depths a jade-hued spring so clear,
Where once the Patriarch perfected his elixir here.
Since the crane departed and the wutong aged,
Suddenly dragons came, and mists and rains surged.
Their erratic comings bred uncanny dread,
For days the region trembled with fear and dread.
Dongzhen wielded the Dao to inscribe the talisman-stone,
Sealing the icy spring, silencing the strange tone.

The Iron Pillar
When Yan Zan of the Tang served as prefect, he doubted the Iron Pillar and once ordered it excavated. Suddenly, swift thunder and fierce winds arose, the river swelled, and the city walls trembled. Terrified, Yan Zan kowtowed in repentance, and only after a long while did the tumult cease.

The poem reads:
An iron pillar, mountain-like, guards the land’s fate,
The Patriarch’s divine traces—how mighty their weight!
Though human strength may falter, the task proves too great,
How could a sacred relic be crushed by man’s hand?
The city quaked, hail and rain fell in spate,
The river roared, winds and thunder shook the strand.
Then Yan Zan, his heart filled with dread,
Burned incense, bowed a hundredfold, and pled.

The Divine Bell

Yan Zan further seized the bell used by the Patriarch in his cultivation and placed it in a Buddhist temple. When struck, its sound was dull as earth or wood. Suspecting the Daoist followers of employing magical restraints, he imprisoned and interrogated them, intending to subject them to punishment. Suddenly, in a seated meditation, he was rebuked by a divine being who threatened to sever his head. Startled awake, he released the Daoists and returned the bell to the Daoist abbey. During the chaos of the fifth-year rebellion, the bell vanished one night, its whereabouts unknown.

The poem reads:
Forged by master smiths in icy cold,
Its whale-like tones once heralded dawn and dusk of old.
Struck in the abbey, its resonance divine,
In the temple, its echoes would not chime.
Suspecting the Daoists of sealing its sound,
The prefect sought to punish—justice to be found.
Had Yan Zan not been warned by the gods’ decree,
The Daoists’ innocence would ne’er be free.

The Divine Wheel

Prefect Xu Deng wished to inspect the divine wheel left by the Patriarch. He ordered it brought to the prefectural hall, but before he could examine it, it flew back that very night. Though the imperial court still stood, when the Jurchen invaded, the wheel was soon lost.

The poem reads:
Ancient craftsmen shaped this wheel for celestial flight,
Not lightly carved, nor fashioned without right.
Its green-traced hub followed earth’s measure true,
Its crimson spokes and jade canopy the heavens knew.
Still, we recall the rush mats of the sage’s hall,
Who would judge by mere appearance, heeding not at all?
The divine wheel belongs in the sacred shrine,
How dare mortal hands presume to move it by design?

The Divine Casket

The stone casket left by the Patriarch bore seams yet could not be opened. During the Tang, Zhang Shanan, who occupied Hongzhou, forcibly chiseled it open. Inside the lid, characters in cinnabar script read: *"Five hundred years hence, the mad rebel Zhang Shanan shall open this."* Terrified, Zhang attempted to wash away the words, but they could not be erased. He then concealed the lid, leaving only the base of the casket, which remains alongside the medicine mortar to this day.

The poem reads:
Zhang Shanan, traitor to the realm, seized Hongzhou’s reign,
Dared pry the divine casket to see what it contained.
With chisel and file, he forced the stone lid wide,
Only to find his name in cinnabar inscribed inside.
All things under heaven are foreordained,
The immortals’ words never deceive—how could they be feigned?
Five hundred years prior, the Master foretold,
How could later men not tremble at what he foreknew of old?

The Melon Offering

Each year in late summer, the gentry and common folk of every village prepare incense, flowers, drums, music, banners, and flags to welcome the small statue of the Patriarch from the sleeping hall to their local altars. There, they pray for blessings and exorcise drought and locusts. Several days in advance, the village elders lead the people to present melons and wine before the main hall, an act called "melon-cutting," announcing the date of the welcoming ceremony.

The poem reads:
Year after year, the festivals grandly unfold,
Late summer arrives, and the melons are cut as told.
Banners dance in the wind to the beat of drums,
Streamers veil the sun as incense and flowers come.
Since then, locusts vanish from the countryside,
Fields yield fine grain, wheat and rice abide.
The immortal’s presence bestows abundant grace,
Thus the people’s devotion grows in this place.

The Patriarch’s statues number six in total, yet only those in the front hall and sleeping hall remain undisturbed; the rest may be welcomed and invited at will. Within sixty days, the welcoming rites circle through all regions, and the people of the eighty-one villages in Hongrui’s domain gather together at the palace to offer thanksgiving jiao rites, known as the *Huangzhong Fast*. The *Huangzhong* ritual was handed down by the Patriarch himself.

The poem reads:
Majestic stands the Patriarch’s image, mighty and grand,
Enthroned in the immortal’s palace, the jeweled hall so grand.
Invoking the sacred, seeking grace to bestow blessings down,
His emanations spread the mystic Dao, the profound Way renowned.
In Ruiyang, every household pays reverent homage,
In Hongzhou, each home holds him in highest homage.
Eighty-one villages gather in assembly,
To this day, the fast unfolds in *Huangzhong*’s ceremony.

**Forbidden Altar Transformation**
On the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month, the immortal’s carriage ascends the Five Dragons Ridge to the left of the palace, banning snakes and tigers—a practice observed since ancient times, called the *Forbidden Altar*. Thus, those who come from near and far to pray and exorcise ills travel day and night without fear of snakes or tigers.

The poem reads:
Qi spreads across the sky, the jade heavens frozen still,
The Patriarch’s immortal carriage graces Dragon Ridge’s hill.
Through shallow marshes and deep grass, serpents are driven away,
In distant mountains and nearby woods, tigers and wolves stray.
Day and night, the roads hold no dread,
Travelers and carriages journey safe instead.
The Forbidden Altar, aided by divine might,
Rewards the faithful with a single incense’s light.

**Pure Moon Transformation**
Mid-autumn is called the *Pure Moon*. From the first day, the palace opens to receive offerings, prayers, and thanksgiving rites from all directions, beginning with the prefectural and district authorities. The prefecture and district prepare incense, candles, wine, silk, and prayer documents, dispatched by mounted officials. People from far and near, supporting the old and carrying the young, arrive by sedan or horse, their shoulders brushing along the roads. Merchants seek profit, performers display rare skills, and teahouses, taverns, inns, and food stalls stretch for over ten *li*, thronging the market gates. The festivities last the entire month.

The poem reads:
When the Pure Moon arrives, the palace gates unfold,
From near and far, they come with tribute and prayer told.
Countless merchants seek their wares to sell,
Many artisans display their crafts so well.
Scholars and common folk from every region come,
Market gates overflow with goods in sum.
For thirty days, the crowds press close and tight,
Nine thoroughfares resound with drums’ delight.

**Yellow Lord Transformation**
Each year on the Mid-Autumn Festival, the *Ascension Fast* is held. The day before, a jiao rite is established at Lingqi, and the following day, the Yellow Lord arrives for an audience. The Yellow Lord is the Patriarch’s son-in-law. His journey often follows the path of seeking the Dao. The next morning, before reaching the palace, five *li* away at Houbei, stands a pavilion called *Robing Pavilion*, where the Yellow Lord changes attire. The palace prepares full ceremonial regalia to welcome him through the main gate—formerly called the *Yellow Pavilion Gate* facing the main hall. First, he pays respects at the front hall, then enters the rear hall, where host and guest exchange courtesies in the *Offering Rite*. Afterward, he descends to rest in the western hall until evening, when he returns west. Meanwhile, the merchants and residents of the eastern market must insistently invite him to stroll the streets to attract prosperity. The competition to pull him along nearly reaches Dragon Ridge Bridge before turning back—a local saying claims that where the *uncle* visits, markets thrive in harmony, a claim often proven true.

The poem reads:
The ice-clear moon shines round, osmanthus fragrance fills the air,
The jiao rite for ascension begins the sacred affair.
The Daoist altar opens with celestial grace,
As rites unfold in this hallowed place.

Amid clouds, the Purple Court receives the reverent audience rite,
As winds carry the radiant procession, resplendent in its might.
At the immortal palace’s feast, songs and music blend,
The sagely chariot parades the streets, bestowing blessings without end.

Men and women block the way, seeking prosperous trade,
Tossing coins and vegetables toward the Yellow Lord’s parade.
Every three years, on the second day after the Lantern Festival’s glow,
The Patriarch’s immortal procession sets forth to visit and bestow.

The Yellow Lord declares: On the Lantern Festival’s western dawn,
At midday, the Patriarch is first welcomed to the front hall’s throne,
Where offerings of three presentations are laid in solemn array,
And only after the audience rite does the procession make its way.

First exiting the eastern gate, it turns south past *Wangxian Bridge*,
Through *Maopu* to *Huanggu Lane*, then to *Anli Bend* it goes,
Entering the *Yuandu Altar*’s grounds, where once a temple stood,
Now in ruins, by the shrine’s side, as the old records have told.

Next ascending *Shigu*, entering *Yuanxianjing*,
Then retracing steps to the post road, turning onto a narrow lane,
Two *li* onward to *Zhutang Abbey* for offerings made,
Where the tomb of the duck-herding boy once stood, its name displayed.

Returning to the main road, to *Anshantou* it wends,
Then to *Sanshili Pu*, where seven offerings attend.
The retinue takes noon repast, then crosses nine ridges, nine streams,
Passing *Longpi Bridge* to reach *Xiangfu*, once *Qixian Abbey*’s dreams.

Now under *Gao’an*’s jurisdiction, where crowds from *Rui* emerge,
To greet the Patriarch, a rite called *Jiexian* they urge.
The Patriarch alights from his palanquin, with the Yellow Lord to dine,
In the front hall, where feasts and courtesies intertwine.

On the seventeenth day, the *Offering Rite* resumes once more,
As the host, attendants, and those who follow the immortal’s lore,
Proceed to the rear hall, to pour libations before *Xu’s Immortal Maiden*,
A rite first established in the *Chunxi* era, in the year of *Wushen*, unshaken.

Before the fifth watch the next day, the return journey begins,
Along this route, six offerings are made where the faithful gather in.
Scholars and commoners, by the thousands, burn incense to greet,
Wherever the procession passes, crowds of men, women, young, and old meet.

They burn incense, bow in reverence, offer paper money and supplies,
Some moved to tears, their devotion reaching the skies.
Whenever the immortal’s chariot departs or arrives,
The host must bow twice, sending off or welcoming beyond the gates’ dives.

For southern audiences, western responses, or when prefectures and states implore,
The host must accompany the Patriarch, as the rites of old restore.
The Patriarch rides a white horse, its bridle led by a golden phoenix’s grace,
A tradition from the shrine of the White Horse Spirit, half a *li* from his dwelling’s place.

It is said the Patriarch, upon attaining the Way, vowed to serve as its guide,
The golden phoenix, some say, embodies the Vermilion Bird’s role in stride.
Others place it upon the palanquin’s canopy, aligning with celestial might,
Though legends of a mother’s prophetic dream may not hold true in light.

The palanquin bearers chant an ancient song in unison’s sway,
A melody named *Yellow Crane Tower*, in harmonious display.
Some wear towering headdresses, adorned with silken bands,
Called *Cai Lou*, their forms bizarre, yet steeped in ancient lands.

The headdress stands two *chi* tall, broad above and narrow below,
A bamboo frame wrapped in silk, tied beneath the chin’s flow.
The Tang Daoist Xiong Jingxiu once remarked with surprise:
“Though the world has turned to Tang, this song still bears the Jin’s guise.”

Though the tune endures, its words have long since faded away,
Now guarded and restored in three verses, as I here relay:
*First*:
The Patriarch’s merit complete, three thousand deeds done,
The Emperor’s decree calls him to ascend beyond the sun.
Even chickens and dogs follow his immortal kin,
To this day, his sacred traces linger within.

*Second*:
A thousand years since the Patriarch left our sight,
Morning and evening, we burn incense in the dim twilight.
We pray his mercy descends to this mortal plane,
Bestowing blessings to shield all living beings from pain.

*Third*:
The Daoist master, Chen Mu, dwells in *Danyang*’s embrace,
Wherever his flying thatch alights, fragrance fills the space.
The immortal chariot remembers its ancient vow,
Yearly returning to pay homage now.

The procession’s path, whether slanting, straight, or winding,
Must follow the ancient ways, its course unwavering and binding.
To alter it invites misfortune, as the old records decree,
For the route is not one trodden by the common folk, you see.

Before the immortal’s chariot departs, the locals prepare,
Clearing the old paths, erecting markers to declare
The way, for it is not a road the many traverse in their days,
But one traced by the footsteps of a beloved maiden’s gaze.

As the legend tells, the Patriarch followed her trail,
To the Yellow Lord’s home, where he lingered without fail.
After two nights, he returned by the main road’s span,
Yet his search for the flying thatch led through many a winding plan.

Thus, the southern audiences and western lodgings retain
The paths he once traversed, as the old records explain.
The palanquin’s weight, pace, and the weather’s face,
Foretell the land’s fortune, its safety, or its disgrace.

Light shoulders and swift steps herald peace and sun,
A land blessed with harvests, its people as one.
Heavy shoulders and slow steps, stumbles, rain, or gloom,
Foretell disaster, harm to people, and crops doomed.

Only for the western audience’s journey, rain and cold are desired,
While a return in warmth and sun is what the faithful have required.
Should the opposite occur, misfortune will descend,
As the land’s fate in the elements’ hands doth bend.

Each journey the immortal’s chariot takes,
Begins at dawn’s first light and through twilight breaks,
Treading paths of thatch, thorns, and brambles untamed,
With hundreds in procession, yet none are ever maimed.

Only impurity is feared—death, filth, or decay,
Whether in incense, money, clothing, food, or where one lay.
To neglect this caution brings sudden, violent woe,
Or disasters in future rites, as the old records show.

The poem reads:
The immortal procession follows the master to the Purple Court’s height,
At *Xiangfu*, banquets are laid in grand and joyous sight.
Nectar flows in cups held high, rare delicacies arrayed,
Ancient rites with *Cai Lou* preserved, new songs in homage played.

Villagers throng to gaze in reverence and awe,
As the land’s harvest hinges on the rains that fall or withdraw.

The Venerable Shi Shen of West Mountain, compiled by Shi Cen

*Divine and Fierce Transformation*

The Perfected Lord Hao, named Meng and styled Shiyun, was a native of Puyang. He served the Kingdom of Wu as Magistrate of Xi’an and later settled there. His nature was profoundly filial: in his youth, during summer months, he would not drive away mosquitoes, fearing they might leave him only to bite his parents.

At forty, he received the divine prescriptions of the Perfected One Ding Yi. Later, he became a disciple of Bao Shuo, the Prefect of Nanhai, and obtained secret methods. During the Huanglong era of Wu, Heaven bestowed upon him a talisman borne by white clouds, whereupon his Daoist arts flourished throughout the lands of Wu and Jin.

During the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin, the Patriarch received the teachings from Shiyun, who transmitted all his secret essentials to him. At the end of the Yongjia era, when Du Qiang invaded Shu and overran its prefectures and counties, the Patriarch slew the great serpent. Shiyun remarked, “The serpent was the spirit of Shu; with its death, Du Qiang shall perish.” And so it came to pass.

Once, when a violent storm arose, he inscribed a talisman and cast it onto the roof. A green bird seized it and flew away, and the wind immediately ceased. When asked the reason, he replied, “A boat on South Lake encountered this storm, and two Daoist priests aboard cried out to Heaven for deliverance. Thus, I halted the wind.” Upon verification, it proved true.

When the Magistrate of Xi’an, Gan Qing, had been dead for three days, Shiyun declared, “The magistrate’s allotted years are not yet spent; I shall plead his case before Heaven.” He then lay beside the corpse, and after several days, both he and Gan Qing arose. Qing’s younger brother, Gan Bao, a Gentleman of Literary Composition, was moved by this marvel and composed the *Soushen Ji* (Records of Searching for Spirits), which circulated in the world.

Once, while crossing the Yuzhang River, he encountered wind and waves that left his boat stranded. Shiyun used the white feather fan he held to part the waters and cross over, astonishing all who witnessed it.

In the second year of the Ningkang era, the Patriarch ascended to immortality, and Shiyun returned to Xi’an. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month that year, the Celestial Thearch commanded the Perfected Zhou Guang to bear an edict summoning Shiyun. He then mounted a chariot drawn by a white deer, accompanied by four disciples, and ascended in broad daylight. His abode was named the Purple Cloud Palace. Today, the Hao Immortal Temple of West Peace and Tranquility in Hao Immortal Village, Fennin County, stands in that place.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial decree, he was canonized as the Perfected of Divine and Fierce Power.

The poem reads:
The Magistrate of Xi’an, mighty in qi and bold,
His filial virtue complete, his arts and methods lofty.
The green bird bore his talisman to still the raging gale,
With a fan’s sweep, he trod the waves to cross the surging tide.
He summoned the soul to restore life to the dead Gan Qing,
Tracked the serpent’s trail to slay it and destroy Du Qiang.
His mystic merit perfected, the celestial edict came,
His deer-drawn chariot ascended steady to Heaven’s domain.

*Upright and Extraordinary Transformation*

Chen Xun of Shu Commandery, styled Xiaoju, was a scholar of an eminent literati family, erudite and widely learned. At the time when Wei dispatched Zhong Hui and Deng Ai to conquer Shu, and Liu Shan surrendered, Xiaoju was still young yet already harbored aspirations beyond the mundane. He entered Mount Qingcheng to study under Master Gu Yuanzhi, seeking the method to transcend the world. Later, hearing that the Patriarch was in Jingyang administering benevolent governance among the people, he hastened to the public court, wishing to serve as a clerk. The Patriarch commended him and appointed him to an official post. In all matters of leading his peers to transform customs and nurture the people, his contributions were many, and thus he was drawn into the Patriarch’s inner circle as a disciple. Entrusted as a confidant, he oversaw the scriptures and guarded the alchemical furnace. The Patriarch, in his ascension, ordered him to hold the staff and lead the way ahead.

Formerly, at the Western Hemp Hall of the Jade Embankment Palace, there was Xiaoju’s Daoist abbey, named the Inheriting Immortality Manor. He planted a great parasol tree with his own hands, and the abbey faced the tree as its dwelling. In the fifth month of the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was canonized as the Upright and Extraordinary Perfected.

The poem reads:
When the world was in chaos, who revered the scholars?
Alone he entered Qingcheng to seek the pivot of the Dao.

Once he had served the Patriarch by enacting virtuous governance, he joyfully entreated to become a disciple and hastened to follow. Entrusted as a confidant, he oversaw the scriptures; with unwavering resolve, he tended the alchemical furnace. After the Patriarch ascended in flight, he held the staff to lead the way ahead. Beneath the vast parasol tree, the hemp fields lay shaded.

Yuan Tonghua of Luling, styled Huichang, descended from General Yu. From youth, he excelled in astronomy and music; in maturity, he mastered the teachings of non-action and purity. Once, while traveling with like-minded companions in the Cloud Terrace Mountains of Shu, he obtained the Han Celestial Master’s methods for expelling malevolent spirits and alleviating the people’s suffering. Hearing of the Patriarch’s presence in Jingyang, he journeyed directly to the public court, offering to serve in humble roles. The Patriarch accepted him, assigning him to attend to staff and sandals, a duty he performed diligently day and night. He adhered to the Daoist practices without cease, and even upon returning to his private residence, he remained ever-attentive. A hundred paces west of his home, he built a chamber to dwell in. When the Patriarch ascended in flight, Huichang, together with Zeng Xingguo, harnessed the dragon carriage. His residence was named the Xuan Shao Manor. During the Baoda era of the Tang, Prefect Zhou of the province, a devotee of the Patriarch, renovated the manor and renamed it Xuan Shao Manor. An inscribed stele remains, and today it is known as the Tai Xu Abbey. In the fifth month of the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was canonized as the Yuan Tong Perfected.

The poem reads:
A scion of a distinguished family, endowed with talent and virtue,
His broad learning embraced the teachings of Lao and Zhuang.
He studied the rites under Master Zhang of the Orthodox Unity,
And sought the Dao from Minister Xu in Jingyang.
Attending to staff and sandals, his heart never flagged;
Listening to the jade-like tones, his resolve grew stronger.
When the day of the Patriarch’s ascension arrived,
Together they harnessed the phoenix carriage to the immortal realm.

Shen Huihua of Sishui, styled Xingguo, descended from Zeng Can. From youth, he was a Daoist priest, endowed with keen intelligence and broad learning, mastering the teachings of the Three Heavens Master. He foresaw future events, and wherever he traveled among the famous mountains and sacred peaks, paths opened before him. His wondrous talismans and divine formulas cured all ailments. The transcendent Sun Deng, upon meeting him, declared: “Your bones are refined, your spirit clear; with diligent cultivation, you shall surely become one who soars beyond the clouds. Strive onward.” Later, he withdrew to Fengcheng in Yuzhang. Hearing of the Patriarch’s renown, he journeyed to his gate, offering to serve as an attendant. The Patriarch esteemed him greatly, imparting all secret divine methods without reservation. Later, he ascended to heaven in the dragon carriage. Today, the Zhen Yang Abbey in Fengcheng County preserves his legacy. In the fifth month of the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was canonized as the Shen Hui Perfected.

The poem reads:
Refined in bone, clear in spirit, a man beyond the clouds,
Through diligent cultivation, he attained the rank of lofty Perfected.
Famous mountains and sacred peaks all opened their paths to him,
His wondrous talismans and divine formulas brought relief to the people.
Taught personally by the immortal master,
His Dao ascended to the sacred realm, weaving through the warp of destiny.
Once his profound merit was established,
He rode the crane and harnessed the dragon, leaving the dust of the world behind.

Hong Shihua of Julu, styled Daoyang, was a distinguished Daoist adept. From youth, he cultivated the teachings of virtue and the Dao. Entering the Siming Mountains, he encountered a divine being who taught him the arts of embryonic breathing and myriad wonders. Thereby, he mastered sleeplessness and fasting, commanding ghosts and spirits to expel malevolent forces. He transmuted gold and jade to relieve the poor, and his benevolence spread far and wide. During the reigns of Emperors Hui and Huai, hearing of the Patriarch’s flourishing Dao and teachings in Jiangzuo, he journeyed on foot to his gate, offering to become a disciple. The Patriarch accepted him, imparting wondrous methods before sending him back to the mountains to instruct his followers. Emperor Ming summoned him to court, but he steadfastly refused to remain, ultimately returning to serve by the Patriarch’s side. In the second year of the Ningkang era, he ascended to heaven alongside Chen Xiaoju, holding the staff to lead the way. His former residence in Yuzhang City, named the Purple Canopy Manor, is today the county hall of Nanchang. The Feng Xian Abbey in Linyang County of Donghai was once his hermitage. In the fifth month of the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was canonized as the Hong Shi Perfected.

The poem reads:
In Siming of old, he met a divine being,
Who imparted the subtle mechanisms of profound wonders.
Commanding ghosts and spirits, he brought ease and benefit,
Transmuting gold and jade to succor the hungry and poor.
Though imperial favor was hard to attain,
The Patriarch’s grace was not easily matched.
Returning to the western mountains, he served with devotion,
And gained the dragon carriage to leave the dust of the world.

Fengcheng’s Gan Zhan, styled Bowu, was a commoner of the grasslands, renowned in his village for his filial piety. Amid the chaos of the times, he lived in seclusion among the marshes, drawn to the arts of divine transcendence and longevity. Hearing of the Patriarch’s practice of the Dao of filial piety—eradicating harm and benefiting all beings—he sought him out, earnestly pleading to serve as his attendant. The Patriarch, recognizing his exceptional talent, granted his request. When the Patriarch ascended, he entrusted Gan Bowu with the wondrous secrets of the Golden Elixir. Later, Bowu returned to Fengcheng, where he spread virtue and bestowed kindness. On the seventh day of the first month of the first year of the Dajian era, at midday as celestial music descended from the heavens, he mounted a qilin-drawn carriage and rode the clouds away. Today, the Qingdu Abbey within the county stands on the site where he once concealed his elixir. His former residence, named the Huayang Pavilion, is now the Feihuang Abbey, where he is venerated. In the fifth month of the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was canonized as the Jingxing Perfected.

The poem reads:
In the Jin dynasty’s time of chaos and strife,
He concealed himself in the marshes, living free.
His filial conduct won his village’s esteem,
His love for immortals surpassed even the Patriarch’s.
Slaying pythons, he quelled great perils,
Severing dragons and flood-dragons, ending their brood.
His work complete, he rode the qilin carriage away,
Leaving behind altar and well by the Sword Pool’s side.

Pei Commandery’s Shi Cen, styled Taiyu, was a stalwart of his village. His ancestors had served the Wu kingdom, and the family later relocated to Chiwu County in Jiujiang. Taiyu possessed a mighty and heroic bearing, unmatched in strength and martial prowess. When the Patriarch first led his disciples to slay the great serpent of Haihun, over three hundred local warriors came to assist, among them Taiyu, who humbly begged to serve. The Patriarch accepted him, and with Gan Bowu, he often stood guard at his side, sword in hand. On the twenty-eighth day of the eleventh month of the second year of the Ningkang era, at dawn, he saw a youth in the eastern sky, riding a cloud and wielding a white staff to drive a green rainbow down to his dwelling. The youth proclaimed the Jade Emperor’s decree, and Taiyu then mounted the green rainbow, ascending on the clouds. Two *li* southeast of the Patriarch’s residence stood an altar called the Purple Jade Manor, where he had once dwelled. On the western ridge, atop a thousand-stone peak by the river, stands an abbey now named Zhide, serving as Taiyu’s watchtower. Similar watchtowers exist in Nanchang, all for monitoring water spirits. In the fifth month of the second year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial edict, he was canonized as the Yongwu Perfected.

The poem reads:
Gripping his sword, he followed the Master to great deeds,
Slaying serpents and dragons, unmatched in might.

In his youth, he vied in archery and martial prowess;
In his prime, his literary works spread far and wide.
His form transcended jade and jasper, his thoughts aligned with the Jin Dao;
He wrestled dragons and tigers with his bare hands, yet grew weary of courtly audiences.

Since purifying the lands of Jiangxi,
He wielded his staff to ride the radiant clouds.
Hidden in kindness, he transformed Lanling—
This was Peng Kang, styled Wuyang.

As a favored relative, he long dwelled in the Master’s gate,
Later nominated as *Xiaolian* and promoted through the Jin court to Left Assistant Minister.
Secretly cultivating immortality, he resigned due to illness,
Then became the Master’s disciple, offering his beloved daughter as the Master’s daughter-in-law.
(Former accounts mistakenly called Peng’s daughter the Master’s wife—
Elders confirm she was his daughter-in-law.)

The Master, grieving the chaos of Emperor Min’s Yongjia era,
Slew serpents and demons while Peng remained in Xu.
By then, Peng was seventy-six or seventy-seven—
How could he have taken a wife?
Yet tales speak of the Master’s wife, Lady Zhou.
The *Eulogy on Filial Dao* contains a marvelous piece,
*The Lady Historian Zhou’s Reply to Her Mother’s Inquiry*,
likely a humble title for the Master’s wife.
Thus, the *Newly Compiled Canon*’s reference to the "Holy Mother" is incorrect.

The Master, moved by Peng’s sincerity,
entrusted him with all esoteric teachings, great and small,
and swiftly sent him back to court.
In the second year of Emperor Mu’s Yonghe era, Peng retired from office,
traveled south with his family, and settled in Yuzhang.
He returned to the Master’s gate, inquiring day and night,
and his Daoist practice flourished.

In the second year of Emperor Wu of Song’s Yongchu era (or the second year of Yixi in the Jin),
on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month,
his entire household of twenty-six ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Within the prefectural city stood the Zonghua Abbey. In the second year of the Zhenghe era of the [Song] court, the fifth month, the site was officially designated for the investiture of the Hidden Perfection Realized Person. A poem reads:

Forsaking high office to learn immortality,
He hung up his cap and untied his seals to return to the fields.
Not for vain glory did he bring his family,
But to seek the Dao, hoping to reach its primal depths.
His daughter left behind to serve the Master in sweeping and cleaning,
He devoted himself as a disciple, ever more refined and single-minded.
Through secluded cultivation, his mystic practice bore fruit,
And his entire household ascended in flight to the Nine Heavens.

Hejing, transformed—Yu Lie of Nanchang, styled Daowei. As a favored relative, he had long dwelled at the Master’s gate. Orphaned young, he served his mother with such filial devotion that it became renowned. His mother was the Master’s elder sister. The Master had two sisters, and Yu’s mother was the eldest. The *Record of Enduring Love* states: "Yu Junlie of Nanchang and Zhongli Junjia were both nephews of Master Xu." Thus, it is certain that Yu’s mother was the Master’s sister. As she was widowed, the Master built a chamber for her a few dozen paces west of his residence, where she took up residence. There, mother and son daily heard the wondrous Dao. Whenever the Master went out, Yu’s mother would manage his household affairs, and both immortal guests and reclusive visitors were received by her. Master Hu’s *Eulogy on the Stone Niche* says: "I once came here and was a guest of Yu’s mother." Mother and son both received the Jade Emperor’s edict, and their celestial retinue ascended to heaven. Today, the abbey west of the wall marks their former dwelling, named the Hall of Harmonious Ritual. In the second year of the Zhenghe era, the fifth month, she was officially invested as the Harmonious Tranquility Realized Person. A poem reads:

Mother’s kindness and son’s filial piety mutually reinforce,
Their shared resolve in cultivation perfected their true nature.
In the fragrant chamber, the breeze welcomed hidden guests,
Beneath the daylit hall of forget-sorrow, immortal visitors were entertained.
Often they heard the wondrous Dao through the Master’s teachings,
Daily they listened to the Master’s voice, drawing near to the Dao.
A cinnabar edict charged them with special duties,
Together they mounted the immortal carriage, leaving the dusty world behind.

Puhui, transformed—Zhongli Jia of Nanchang, styled Gongyang. As a favored relative, he had long dwelled at the Master’s gate. He was the son of the Master’s second sister and was orphaned young, his nature simple and unadorned. The Master once sighed that he possessed the bearing to receive the Dao, so he taught him divine formulas to save and succor, and transmitted to him wondrous instructions to command and expel. When the Master ascended to heaven, he first bestowed upon him the gift of the Golden Elixir. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month of that year, at midday, a jade-green radiance and a jeweled carriage descended from heaven to welcome him. Gongyang bowed to the edict and ascended the carriage, departing. The western source of Ivory Mountain in Xinjian was his dwelling, where an abbey named Danling stands. The stone mortar for alchemical drugs remains there, and the site is called the Zhong Jade Mansion. In the second year of the Zhenghe era, the fifth month, he was officially invested as the Universal Beneficence Realized Person. A poem reads:

Alone his form drifted like wild clouds in flight,
His nature lofty, his wisdom and insight profound.
Commanding the myriad spirits with wondrous instructions,
Curing the hundred ailments with divine formulas found.
His refined bearing fit for ascending the immortal’s Way,
His steadfast resolve worthy of the Cavern’s scrolls’ array.
First the Master bestowed the Golden Elixir to consume,
Then the jeweled carriage of jade-green radiance drew near to assume.

Chongdao Hua, styled Ziting, of Jiancheng and Huang Renlan, dwelled long in the Master’s gate as a favored kinsman. His father, Fu, styled Wanshi, was nominated Filial and Incorrupt and served as Imperial Censor. Ziting possessed a spirit of radiant elegance and a bearing of serene depth; the Master gave him his daughter in marriage. He mastered all the Master’s Dao, and when appointed Attendant Official in Qingzhou, he left his wife to serve his parents, yet each night he would return home unbeknownst to others.

One evening, a servant reported hearing voices and laughter in the Xu family courtyard at night. His aunt questioned Xu, who replied, “It is Huanglang.” The aunt said, “Your husband serves in office thousands of *li* away—how could he be here?” Xu replied, “He has attained the immortal’s Way and can traverse a thousand *li* in an instant. He warned me not to speak of it, so I dared not tell you.” The aunt said, “If so, let me see him.” That night, when Ziting returned, Xu told him what had transpired.

At dawn, Ziting could not refuse and appeared before his parents, saying, “Though Renlan serves in a distant land, he secretly returns each night to your side. The immortal’s Way is secret and must not be revealed, lest it bring calamity and harm.” As he spoke, he took a bamboo staff and transformed it into a green dragon, mounting it to depart.

Thus Wanshi, too, came to admire the immortal’s Way and served the Master with the rites of a disciple. Only Ziting’s two younger brothers, bold and unrestrained, spent their days hunting and roaming. Though their father and brother ascended by imperial edict, the two remained at their hunting grounds, declaring, “Our nature is too wild and free to become immortals. Let our brother’s entire clan ascend—allow us two to hunt deer.” Ziting sighed at their allotted fate and transformed a blade of grass into a deer to curb their reckless hearts.

Thereupon, with his parents and thirty-two kin, they rode the clouds to join the Master’s immortal procession and ascend to heaven. The two brothers later concealed themselves in the Western Mountains. Today, the Fangang Temple is commonly called the Shrine of Huang the Fourth and Fifth Lords. The Xiangfu Abbey in Gao’an County of Ruizhou was once his former residence, beside which lies the Xu Family Hairpin-Dropping Isle.

In the second year of the Zhenghe era, the fifth month, by imperial edict, he was invested as the Chongdao Realized Person. His father, Fu, also sought to become the Master’s disciple, but the Master, treating him as a favored kinsman, received him with guest rites and did not include him among the eleven disciples. All disciples were permitted to transmit the teachings to their clans, and each altar and retreat was given a name for its precinct.

The teachings were called the Grand Rites, the Precinct’s Lesser Rites, and the Retreat, named according to the number of practitioners. A poem reads:

Ziting’s elegance surpassed Pan An’s grace,
A silken thread once bound Xu to his steed’s embrace.

The bamboo staff transformed into a dragon, channeling sacred transformation; the grassy branch turned into a deer, admonishing against greed and cruelty. Though brothers’ natures differed too much to share a quilt, father and son, with hearts aligned, both attained the elixir.

By celestial decree, the Master was to ascend with his entire household—his immortal kin, too, would mount simurghs. The transformation of Master Lan:

Of old there was an extraordinary person surnamed Lan, named Qi, whose name none dared speak, calling him only "Master Lan." Initially dwelling in Gaoping Village, Jiuyuan Ward, Qufu County, Yanzhou, his household of over a hundred souls cultivated filial piety with such devotion that Perfected Ones from the Dipper descended. His family styled themselves the "Filial and Fraternal Kings," with the personal name Hongkang and the courtesy name Bozhong. They addressed Master Lan, saying: "In the primordial darkness lies the Great Dao; at midday, it becomes the Way of Filial Piety. The Celestial King’s primordial darkness is the Supreme Dao; in the moon, it becomes the Way of Filial Piety. The Luminous King’s mysterious darkness is the Way of Filial Piety; in the Dipper, it becomes the Way of the Filial and Fraternal King.

When filial piety reaches heaven, the sun and moon shine brightly. When it reaches earth, the myriad things flourish. When it reaches the people, the kingly way is perfected. From the Upper Clarity downward, I have entrusted myself to the mortal realm, demonstrating the teachings of filial piety and fraternal duty. In a later Jin dynasty, the Perfected Immortal Xu Xun will transmit the lineage of my filial way, becoming the chief of all immortals."

Thereupon, they bestowed upon Master Lan secret instructions, the *Precious Canon of the Golden Elixir*, bronze talismans, and an iron charter, commanding him to transmit them to the Yellow Hall Female Perfected, Mistress Chen. They further admonished him: "In the future, when the disciple Xu Xun appears, you shall pass these to him."

The Filial and Fraternal King then led Master Lan to wander the outskirts, where they suddenly came upon three ancient tombs by the roadside. Pointing, he said to Master Lan: "These mark the nearness of your three past liberations. The first tomb holds the immortal robes left behind from your former liberation by corpse-release. The second tomb contains one whose corporeal refinement in the Great Yin is complete—now he shall rise. The third tomb conceals only a discarded husk."

He instructed Master Lan to relocate the road beside the tombs, lest people and beasts tread upon them. After the Filial and Fraternal King ascended to heaven, Master Lan posted a notice to travelers, blocking the old path. People called him deluded, accusing him of arbitrarily altering the road, and seized him to bring before the authorities. The officials detained him, demanding proof. Master Lan recounted the prior events in full. The officials declared that if his words were false, he would face execution.

Master Lan replied: "My words come from the Filial and Fraternal King—how could they be false?" The officials then took Master Lan to the site to verify his claims. When they opened the first tomb, they found a yellow robe within. The second tomb revealed a person with the complexion of a youth and a delicate frame, as if just awakened from sleep. The third tomb contained a set of linked bones. All were astonished and sighed in wonder. The officials took the immortal robe and presented it to the prefect, but when the prefect donned it, he could not bear its weight. Returning it to Master Lan, he put it on, and instantly merged with the immortal from the tomb, refining his body to ascend lightly.

The officials repented and apologized, earnestly bowing and asking when he would descend to the mortal realm again. Master Lan leaned down and told them: "From now on, I may descend once every ten or a hundred days to practice the Way of Filial Piety and aid those lost on the path."

Later, in Wudu, a fifteen-year-old youth appeared, and in Danyang, a three-year-old divine child—both were incarnations of true immortals, come to propagate the teachings of filial piety and guide those destined for transcendence.

A poem reads:
To study the Dao, one must first fill the measure of filial conduct;
Naturally, filial piety moves the mysterious heavens.
Had not a single word opened the three tombs,
Who would recognize the three lives’ steadfast cultivation of the One?
The sagely teachings were first transmitted to Mistress Chen,
Later, the true immortal Xu would revere them.
Master Lan, reverent and faithful to the celestial instructions,
Merged form and spirit to enter the Great Void.

The transformation of Mistress Chen:

Mistress Chen’s origins are unknown; her courtesy name was Ying. She once dwelled in the Yellow Hall of Danyang Prefecture in Jinling, quietly cultivating the Supreme Dao, heedless of the passage of years. Elders across generations had seen her, yet her teeth and hair never aged, her countenance ever youthful. All called her "Mistress Chen," deeming her worthy to be a teacher.

During the reign of the Great Wu Emperor, as she walked through the Danyang marketplace, she suddenly encountered a boy of fourteen or fifteen, who kowtowed and bowed twice, wishing to become her adopted son. Mistress Chen told him: "Now that you are grown, you must serve and nourish your birth parents. How can you turn from your own kin to call me mother? That would be unnatural and contrary to the Great Dao."

The boy knelt, apologized, and departed. Some days later, she passed through the marketplace again and suddenly saw a child of about three, weeping and wailing, no one knowing whose son he was. When he met Mistress Chen, he clutched her clothes and would not let go, crying, "Where has my mother come from? I only beg for your pity." Taking pity on his helplessness, Mistress Chen took him in and raised him.

As he gradually grew, he served her with sweet delicacies morning and night without fail. His heart aligned with the Dao, his conduct connected with the divine, his wisdom surpassing others. He mastered the classics and teachings, astronomy and geography, the Hundred Schools and the Nine Streams, plumbing the profound and exploring the subtle.

When he neared twenty, Mistress Chen said to him: "I have cultivated and served the Orthodox Dao for a long time. You have been raised by me, temporarily bound by this connection. Since you have no heavenly destiny, what name and surname will you take?"

The boy replied: "Formerly, the Celestial Perfected bestowed upon me a sacred text, appointing me as the Filial Piety Luminous King. May I take this as my name?"

Mistress Chen said: "Since the Celestial Perfected has bestowed it, how dare I refuse?" They then discussed seeking a marriage for him.

The boy knelt before his mother and recited a eulogy:
"I am no mortal of this world,
But a true immortal of the upper realms.
Now as your son, I fulfill an old bond,
To practice the Way of Filial Piety,
And deliver all divine immortals.
The fifteen-year-old youth before you
Is also my incarnation.
Now that my Dao is complete,
I shall return to my true nature.
The true and the mortal follow different paths—
Why discuss marriage?
Why not, at the Yellow Hall altar,
Transmit the teachings to the worthy?"

Hearing his eulogy, Mistress Chen was struck with awe and reverence. Thereupon, she established an altar and retreat at the Yellow Hall, solemnly maintaining the incense fire and propagating the teachings of the Filial Piety Luminous King.

The Luminous King instructed Mistress Chen in the secrets of cultivating the true Dao, saying: "You must always establish your altar in the highest and most secluded place, sever ties with all heterodox factions, dwell in quietude upon hills and mounds, ingest the warmth of yang, entrust your mirror to the Great Void, and still your mind in the Mystic Garden. Without the jeweled canopy of the Peerless One, the jade scriptures of the Yellow and the Old, the True Scriptures of the Great Cavern, the Seven Radiant Ones of the Vast Expanse, or the Supreme Hidden and Mysterious Dao, you may not rest.

One moment, you ride the cloud-borne chariot beneath a gossamer canopy; the next, you gaze upon the Terrace of Literary Brilliance with its celestial retinue. Those who attain this Dao shall hear the harmonious cries of the Nine Phoenixes and the gathering of the Ten Thousand Spirits. Refining the body and mastering the Eight Effulgences, they ascend into the void, borne by dragon chariots and tiger escorts, roaming the eight directions.

Hold these teachings in utmost reverence."

Thereupon, he transmitted to her the wondrous secrets and bestowed the sacred talismans. Soon after, he took leave of his mother and soared into the heavens. Mistress Chen received these teachings, treasuring and concealing them. For decades, no one knew of them.

By the end of the Western Jin dynasty, Lord Xu Xun and Lord Wu Meng, having heard of Mistress Chen’s attainment of the Dao, journeyed from afar to Danyang to seek her instruction. Recognizing their names recorded in the celestial registers as destined immortals, she transmitted to them the teachings of the Filial Piety Luminous King, the lineage of true immortals’ ascension, and the arts of the Orthodox Unity—exorcising evil, the Three-and-Five Flying Steps. She also passed on to Lord Xu the bronze talismans, iron charters, golden elixir scriptures, and primordial precepts originally bestowed upon Filial Piety King Lan, strictly adhering to the original prohibitions.

She further instructed the two lords on the ranks and registers of the Five August Ones’ celestial bureaucracy, then commanded Lord Xu to transmit the Dao to Lord Wu in proper succession. The two lords bowed in gratitude and prepared to take their leave. Lord Xu wished to pay annual homage to Mistress Chen, but she said: "Desist. Do not return. I shall soon depart for the Emperor’s realm."

Taking a blade of sacred grass, she cast it southward, where it flew away with the wind. She then said: "Upon your return, go several dozen *li* south of your dwelling. Where the grass alights, establish my shrine. A single autumn visit each year shall suffice."

As her words ended, a cloud-dragon chariot descended to welcome her, and she ascended into the heavens. Today, at the border of Xinjian and Fengcheng counties stands the Yellow Hall Abbey, a shrine modeled after the Yellow Hall Altar of Danyang, where each year on the third day of the eighth month, devotees come to pay homage to Mistress Chen.

A poem concludes:
With steadfast resolve, she cultivated the Dao in seclusion,
Years passing unknown in the world’s bustling margins.

Deep in the profound Dao, she mastered its mysteries,
In perfect union with the Void’s origin, she joined the immortals on high.
With tender care, she nurtured the young disciples, her compassion profound,
As guardian of the aged Mistress, her sacred work was complete.

Awaiting the transmission of the Dharma treasures to Hao and Xu,
She alone rode the cloud-dragon chariot into the azure heavens.

**Jin Gong’s Transformation**
The Earth Lord Jin Gong—his name lost to the world, though some say it was *Bao*, and he was the seventh in his line—lived in the Western Mountains of Yuzhang. Jin had advanced in rank by presenting grain to the court, and his honesty and integrity were widely respected in his village. When the Patriarch and Guo Pu came to select a site at his dwelling, Guo remarked: "I have surveyed many lands, but none compare to this. If one seeks wealth and rank, there may be rises and falls, but if one desires a retreat for cultivation, this perfectly accords with the standards of immortals. The hills here are rounded and full, the terrain deep and secluded. Three peaks stand like sentinels, encircled by clouds, their inner and outer forms interlocking in perfect harmony. In assessing land, one must also assess the person. Your inner and outer qualities align precisely with this place."

They then called upon Jin together. He welcomed them joyfully, as if they were old friends. Guo addressed him: "Master Xu wishes to establish a dwelling here for cultivation. That is why I have come with him to pay our respects." Jin replied: "I see that Master Xu possesses the bearing and bones of an immortal, no mere mortal of the dusty world. Yet I fear this land may not be worthy of him. If he truly desires it, I shall also provide fields and property to support his daily needs." Master Xu said: "Though we have met as if by fate, to accept this without cause would be improper. Pray tell me the extent of what you would offer, and I shall comply." Jin answered: "A gentleman’s word, once given, is as binding as life itself. Would I cling to mere possessions? I am a simple man and have never relied on written contracts." He then took a large coin, split it in two, kept one half himself, and handed the other to the Patriarch, saying: "Let this serve as our bond."

The next day, Jin moved his family to a dwelling in Xilin, where he lived until his death. At Yulong Abbey, there is a deity known as the *Manifestly Loyal True Official of Xilin*, the Earth Lord—this was Jin. During the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, an imperial envoy was once dispatched to offer incense, candles, flowers, and vegetables to the Patriarch. As the envoy crossed a bridge, a man in vermilion robes and boots approached him. Unaware that this was the deity, the envoy asked upon arriving at the abbey: "Who was the official I met at the bridge just now? Where is he now?" His attendants replied:

None could recall such a person. The envoy said: "He wore vermilion robes, and his build was stout and short." All present insisted no such man existed. The next day, as the envoy ascended the hall to present his offerings, he passed the Earth Lord’s shrine. Gazing upon it, he exclaimed in astonishment: "The man I saw yesterday is this very deity!" He then burned incense, performed rites, and marveled at the spirit’s efficacy. Upon returning, he reported this to the court. An imperial edict was soon issued, exempting the abbey from corvée and tax levies—all due to this encounter.

The deity’s numinous power grew ever stronger with time, and in recent years, his responses to prayers have become especially manifest, too numerous to recount in full. All, near and far, bear witness to this. In the fourth year of the Jiatai era, the temple was granted the plaque *Zhaoying*. In the third year of the Jiading era, he was enfeoffed as *Lingfu Hou*.

A poem reads:
*Lingfu, golden lord of ancient simplicity,*
*Bound to the Patriarch as if by fate’s decree.*
*Why should a wise ruler fear land hard to claim?*
*A man of honor spurns self-regard and fame.*
*He split a coin to swear his steadfast creed,*
*No need for contracts writ on silk or reed.*
*With all his kin he dwelt in Xilin’s glade,*
*Where mountain rites his earthly godhead made.*

**Xu Dahua**
Xu Dahua was a laborer in service to the Patriarch. On the day the Patriarch ascended to heaven, Xu and his wife happened to be transporting rice to the market. Upon hearing at the West Ridge Market that the Patriarch was ascending, they overturned their rice cart and rushed home. By the time they arrived, the immortal procession had already departed. The couple beat their breasts, weeping and pleading to follow. The Patriarch told them their merit was yet incomplete and they were not fated for flight. Instead, he taught them the arts of earthly immortality, and the couple both concealed themselves in the Western Mountains. The rice spilled from their overturned cart sprouted anew on the ground. The place is now called *Fan Che Gang* (Overturned Cart Ridge) and *Sheng Mi Shi* (Sprouted Rice Market).

Though they wished to remain unknown, they changed their names to Wu, but were recognized again and so altered it once more to Gan. Both left poems for the world. Gan’s poem reads:
*Since the Prefect rose to heaven’s height,*
*I’ve wandered the world to this very night.*
*Not to hide my name in mortal guise,*
*But selling firewood, buying wine, forgetting cares outright.*

His wife’s poem reads:
*Drunk, I dance and sing through fallen flowers,*
*My green silk skirt stained with cinnabar’s powers.*
*I come and go through towns to sell my herbs,*
*For only Western Mountain is my home’s true bowers.*

Another poem of hers:
*In the immortal realm, I mark no spring,*
*How could I know the world’s cold and heat’s sting?*
*My home lies only within Western Mountain’s fold,*
*None but white clouds ever cross my threshold old.*

This was composed when Gan traveled for a time and did not return, and she walked alone to the altar of offerings, moved by emotion:
*Yesterday I wandered to the emerald peaks,*
*Where altar winds stirred and apricot blossoms thinned.*
*The green peach bore my message’s trace,*
*Why then does he linger, not returning to this place?*

When Xu and his wife heard the Patriarch was about to ascend, they desperately begged to follow. The Patriarch, citing the celestial decree, explained that the number of those destined for ascent was already fixed, and their request could not be granted. Thus, he had sent them away beforehand. Though they overturned their cart and hurried back, it was already too late. To this day, people occasionally claim to see them.

A poem reads:
*The Patriarch’s home rose toward heaven’s gate,*
*The rice cart overturned—too late their fate.*
*The celestial decree left no room for plea,*
*Their merit, though great, was not yet complete.*
*The phoenix and simurgh had soared away,*
*The couple wept in vain, their tears like spray.*
*Though not among those fated to ascend,*
*In Western Mountain, earthly immortals they’d become in the end.*

**Hu Zhan’s Transformation**
Hu Zhan and the Second Wang were two clerks of Jingyang County. Their given names are unknown. Long after the Patriarch had resigned his office and returned to the mountains, the two clerks, moved by his profound virtue, abandoned their homes to follow him, pledging lifelong service. The Patriarch, pitying their sincerity but knowing they were not destined for immortality, instructed that after their deaths they should become deities. One was enshrined in the sacred land’s southeastern high peak to guard the water’s mouth, where they would forever receive sacrificial offerings.

A poem reads:
*The Patriarch’s return to the mountains was long ago,*
*The clerks could not forget his virtue’s glow.*
*They resigned their posts to follow, hearts sincere,*
*Abandoning their homes, their devotion clear.*
*Glad to hold the whip and hear his words,*
*Delighted to attend, listening to his every word.*
*Alas, their fate did not include ascent,*
*As gods they receive offerings to this day, heaven-sent.*

**Hu the Master’s Transformation**
The Master’s surname was Hu, given name Huichao, courtesy name Basu. His place of origin is unknown. No one knew his age. During the Shangyuan era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, he came from Mount Lu and dwelled in Hongjing of the Western Mountains of Yuzhang. In the Yongchun era, wearing a cloth headscarf and hempen robe, he walked with a staff to Youwei Abbey. Among his peers, he alone did not hold a tablet but clasped his hands in greeting. His beard and brows were fine, his bearing imposing, resembling a man of forty. Though not particularly tall, in a crowd his head always stood above the rest, and even the tallest only reached his shoulders—hence he was called *Hu the Tall Immortal*.

When asked his age, he would say fifty-two. Decades later, the same answer was given. Yet when discussing the rise and fall of dynasties from the Jin and Song onward, he recounted events with perfect precision. He delighted in discussing Zhang, the Minister of Works of Jin, whose knowledge of ancient matters was as if they were his friends. Some say Xu and Wu, the two lords, taught him the Way of extending life, refining transformation, and transcending the Three Origins and Nine Cycles. He could summon spirits, command thunder and rain, and drive away pestilence. When Tao Hongjing collated the *Taiqing Jing* in seventy scrolls at Huayang Cave on Mount Mao, the Master was also present. His name was written in red on the seams of the scrolls, visible to all who read them. It is also said...

I once sojourned here as a guest of Mother Xu, yet even then I knew not to what era or realm of beings I belonged. Along my journeys, whenever I encountered exposed bones and abandoned remains, I would bury them all. Where the earth held ancient treasures or sacred vessels, I would excavate as foretold and recover them. Hearing of malevolent and monstrous beings, I loathed them as bandits and brigands, and made it my duty to eradicate them.

At that time, in the western gate of Yuzhang, a camphorwood spirit had manifested as a one-footed deity, wreaking havoc with its eerie hauntings and luring people into lewd sacrifices. Upon seeing it, I rebuked it with a shout, inscribed a talisman to bind it, then ordered the tree felled, piled with kindling, drenched in oil, and set ablaze. The demonic haunting was thus extinguished, and the site was consecrated as an abbey. Its former name was Xinguo; now its plaque reads Tianqing, also called Xuanmiao.

In my earlier travels, I found the Weiguan Abbey in a state of ruin during the early Tang. When I asked the abbot why he did not restore it, he replied that he lacked the means. I resolved to act and, within a month, had timber rafts brought to the mouth of the Zhangmu River in Gao’an, ninety *li* from the abbey. I instructed the raftsmen to secure the logs tightly and rest for the night by the riverbank. As dusk fell, I cast a flying ink talisman, and by midnight, a fierce storm of wind and thunder raged. By dawn, the rafts had arrived at the abbey’s foundation. Along the path through the forests and valleys, trees were uprooted and broken as if swept aside. I then unearthed a cache at the mountain’s base, yielding three hundred thousand coins to fund the labor.

For all structures not meant for human habitation, I employed spirits and deities to construct them. Outside the gates, I had three wells dug to avert fire disasters. The locals called them the "Fire-Prohibiting Wells," and to this day, the abbey has never suffered a fire.

In time, my extraordinary deeds became widely known. Empress Wu sent an honor guard with a cushioned carriage to summon me, but I retreated into the hidden crags and valleys. The prefectural and county officials searched urgently, and though I had no choice but to emerge, I was brought to the capital and received in the Wucheng Hall. The Empress inquired about matters of transcendence, but I spoke only of the Dao, of virtue, and of the wellsprings of imperial governance. She was greatly pleased. She wished to retain me in the capital to oversee the refinement of elixirs, but I declined and begged to return to the mountains for my cultivation. She then dispatched envoys to escort me home, laden with gold and silk.

As I passed through Shanfu, she bestowed a blessing, saying: *"The Master’s Daoist rank is lofty, his aspirations noble, long since risen above the mundane world—like Guangchengzi of the Xuanyuan era or the River Earl of the Han. Yet he has journeyed a thousand *li* to heed the summons. The Three Rivers’ daily audience begins with the first glimpse of rainbow robes receding into the distance; the Celestial Ford’s later crossing gazes upon the crane-canopied carriage soaring away. From afar, the winds and clouds sigh in endless regret. If only, from the remnants of the Ninefold Refinement, a single pill might be spared..."*

Thereupon, I refined an elixir at the ancient altar of Master Hongya. Three years passed from start to finish, when an imperial edict urgently summoned me to court. Upon arrival, I was lodged within the palace precincts. I sought to return home, but the court refused. One morning, I vanished without a trace. The Emperor, upon learning of this, sighed in deep regret and sent envoys with lavish gifts, along with a poem:

*A lofty man aligns with lofty aims,
In mountain garb he returns to mountain halls.
Far-flung, the wind and moon are heard,
Yet ever distant, veiled in mist and haze.
Jade peaks peer into caverned depths,
Where cinnabar is wrought on tortoise’s back.
Today, by Starry Ford on high,
I crane my neck to glimpse the sacred trace.*

I returned to the western mountains and dwelled in the Jing Abbey of Mother Xu. There stood the Central Gate of the Three Clarities, the Ancestral Master’s Hall, all built by spectral labor. The upright pillars and crossbeams, stacked to the ridge, were hewn with such precision that no human craftsman could match it. They stood unyielding, unwarped, indestructible—beyond mortal skill. The beams bore the Emperor’s own inscription, the characters bold and vigorous, marking the great cyclical year.

I also painted my true likeness upon the wall of the rear hall. The people of the western mountains all revered me as their master. For a thousand *li* around, there were no plagues, no droughts or floods, no predatory beasts, no untimely deaths—all near and far depended on this blessing.

On the sixteenth day of the second month in the third year of the Chang’an era, I commanded my disciples to construct a tomb on Hidden Dragon Ridge, northwest of the Youwei Abbey. There they interred two *Tai Xuan* talismans, the Seven Stars divine sword, the Numinous Treasure staff, and the spirit wand. The work was completed in three days. I then donned my robes and cap, seated myself upon the rope bed, and as the chamber filled with a mysterious fragrance, cranes and clouds appeared in the sky, while outside the walls, the sounds of men and horses arose in ceaseless tumult. When they looked upon me, I had already shed my mortal form.

The prefecture reported the matter, and the court bestowed money and silk for vegetarian feasts and offerings. I was posthumously titled Master of the Cavern of Perfection. Master Sima Zhen of Gusu composed the inscription, recording all in meticulous detail. As time passed, the true wall began to crumble. A wandering Daoist arrived, traced its likeness onto wooden planks, and restored it to its former state. The next evening, the wall collapsed, and the Daoist vanished without a trace.

In the sixth year of the Zhenghe era, by imperial decree, the abbey was rebuilt, and the old structure dismantled. Only the true wooden likeness remains to this day.

A poem says:

A presence stern, his nature pure, his qi robust and strong,
In arts and methods skilled, he took delight in deeds well done.
At Mount Juqu he collated scriptures, preserving sacred store;
At Jingyang he received the Dao, subduing demons fierce.
Ninefold refined, the numinous elixir came by grace of Heaven’s Queen;
The ancient abbey, newly raised, was built by ghostly hands.
His virtue complete, at Dragon Ridge his sword and staff were laid to rest—
One morning he cast off his shell, escaping the cage of dust.

*The Eighty-Five Transformations of the Perfected Lord Xu of the Western Mountains, Scroll the Lower, concludes.*

(Note: The character 『来』 appears to be a misprint for 『米』.)

The difficulty of learning transcendence has ever been thus. Yet why should transcendence be hard to learn? Have you not read this account? The Perfected of the Western Mountains were all womb-born, flesh-and-blood beings, no different from ordinary men. If one claims it is difficult, then the Western Mountains would have no immortals who ascended. The distinction between difficulty and ease lies solely in the heart’s own diligence or indolence. For the diligent, it is not difficult; for the idle, it becomes so.

Moreover, the *Poetic Biography of the Perfected Lord Xu* had been circulating for five or seven years, its woodblocks awaiting carving, passed from Zhang to Li, deferred and evaded, with none willing to see the task through. Recently, the devout layman Song Daosheng of Baolin, seeing the years slip by and fearing the work might fade into oblivion, took it upon himself to fulfill this grand endeavor of the Great Dao, completing it in an instant. How could this be called difficult? Observing whether things come to fruition reveals the ease or difficulty of attaining transcendence. No wonder some say it cannot be learned—it truly depends on whether the human heart is willing.

Thus did the ancients say: "Master the principles of things, and the Dao becomes clear."

Written on the Day of the Middle Prime of the tenth year of the Chunyou era by the Perfected Man Yongwu of Courageous Awakening, Shi Cen.

---

After the ascension of the Perfected Lord Xu of Jingyang, over a thousand years have passed, yet the people still rely upon him. His responses are swift to prayers, his resonance unbroken by any lack of devotion—surely the gods lend their unseen aid. On the evening of the Middle Prime this year, Yuanming burned incense at the Hall of the Four Saints. In a vision, a spirit announced: "Tomorrow, one bearing books shall arrive." I thought it but a vague dream. Yet the next day, the reclusive scholar Jia Shoucheng of Jianghuai arrived from Stone City, paying reverent homage to the sacred traces of the Perfected Lord. He also presented the *Poetic Biography of the Eighty-Five Transformations of the Perfected Lord Xu*. As I bowed and recited its verses, I beheld the poems composed by the Perfected Man Shi of the Western Mountains. In silent accord with the spirit’s message, I was moved beyond words.

Ascending the hall, I struck the drum and raised the goblet before the assembly, reverently enshrining the gifted *Poetic Biography* in the sacred repository, that it might be preserved for all time. A few words spoken in the hall are not recorded here. Thereafter, Master Jia fulfilled his wandering heart’s resolve.

Yuanming then inscribed this postscript to the biography: On the eighteenth day of the seventh month in the dingwei year, I, Sun Yuanming, Chief Daoist Overseer of the Xiaoyao Mountain Jade Prosperity Abbey of Eternal Longevity, within the jurisdiction of the Grand Master of Numinous Treasure, bow my head and set brush to paper.
