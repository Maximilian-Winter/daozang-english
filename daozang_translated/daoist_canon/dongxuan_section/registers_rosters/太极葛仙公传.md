**The Transmission of Supreme-Polarity Lord Ge the Transcendent**
*Scripture Title:* *The Combined Transmission of Supreme-Polarity Lord Ge*. One fascicle. Completed in the *ding-si* year of the Zhengtong reign of the Ming dynasty. Originally attributed to "Tan Sixian of Azure Origin Abbey," but in fact revised and compiled by Zhu Chuo based on earlier transmissions. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Cavern Mystery Division*, *Genealogical and Hagiographical Category*.

**Preface to the Transmission of Supreme-Polarity Lord the Transcendent**
The Dao of transcendence is ancient, tracing back to the Divine Farmer and the Rain Master, with adepts appearing in every age. By the Zhou dynasty, the Old Master [Laozi] took clarity and quiescence, non-action, as his fundamental principle. Those who studied under him revered him as the patriarch of their teaching, and his Way became ever more manifest in the world. The rulers of Qin and Han coveted longevity, and masters of esoteric arts gathered like clouds, their feats of mist-walking, flight, and transformation attested in numerous records—no falsehoods there.

Our prefecture’s Lord Ge the Transcendent attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal during the Wu dynasty, some twelve hundred years ago. The people have transmitted his legacy through generations, and the abbeys where he is venerated have flourished with time, their incense and lamps tended morning and evening as if but a single day had passed. Yet how could this have endured so long were it not for the abiding power of his virtue?

After completing my official term in the eastern mountains and returning home due to family mourning, the adept Tan Daolin of Azure Origin Abbey, accompanied by five fellow disciples, visited me. From his sleeve he produced a scroll, presenting it to me with these words: "This is the transmission of our Lord the Transcendent." The abbey stands on the site of the immortal’s former residence, converted into a sanctuary after his ascension—nearly a thousand years have passed. Seekers of the Dao, drawn by his renown, arrive constantly to inquire, yet we have lacked a detailed account to offer them.

For years, my late teacher, Master Bamboo-Grove, cherished the intention of compiling such a record. He often said to me: "One who shelters beneath a tree must still love its branches. How can one study the Dao yet remain ignorant of its origins?" Long ago, Master Lü [Dongbin] composed a *Transmission of Lord the Transcendent* in one fascicle, but it was lost when the *Daoist Canon* was destroyed. Despite diligent searches, it has never been recovered. As time recedes and events fade, is this not a grievous lacuna in our mountain’s heritage? We have only managed to obtain a *Transmission of Lord the Transcendent* from Mount Zao, which shall serve as our text. We intended to carve it into printing blocks, but Master Bamboo-Grove fell ill and the work remained unfinished. After his passing and transcendence, his disciples resolved to fulfill his long-held wish, lest his earnest devotion be forgotten.

They entreated me to refine and embellish the text before sharing it with those of like mind. Would this not bring fortune to our mountain forests and, moreover, serve as a sacred offering for our entire prefecture? Though I declined thrice, I could not refuse their command. I accepted the scroll and read it several times. Observing its disorderly arrangement and many omissions, I undertook to reorganize it, compiling this single fascicle of transmission.

The *Book of Changes* states: "To divine and illuminate it depends on the person." The Dao of Lord the Transcendent is numinous indeed. Those who study his Way and cultivate it to enlightenment will become true adepts—how could the Dao of transcendence remain beyond their reach? Tan Daolin, take heed.

Master Bamboo-Grove’s surname was Gong, his given name Weilin. His family hailed from Liuyu in Danyang, and he was a learned elder well-versed in the classics, skilled in the zither, and an admirer of Lord the Transcendent’s Way, which he studied diligently. Tan Daolin was his disciple. Daolin’s given name was Sixian, and his family, too, hailed from Yuxi in Danyang. Both master and disciple belonged to eminent clans of Danyang.

**The Transmission of Supreme-Polarity Lord Ge the Transcendent**
Compiled by Tan Sixian of Azure Origin Abbey

Lord the Transcendent’s personal name was Xuan, his courtesy name Xiaoxian, and his surname Ge. He was a native of Jurong.

The *Records of the Historian* state: He descended from the Ge Tian clan, enfeoffed at Ge, whence they took their surname. They served as hereditary nobles through the ages.

The *Stele of Lord the Transcendent by Tao Hongjing* records: He was a native of Jiyang Village in Duxiang Township, Jurong, Danyang.

Zhang Shang’s *Gazetteer of Jurong* states: Azure Origin Abbey was built in the seventh year of the Tianjian reign of the Liang dynasty, over three hundred paces southwest of the county seat, on the site of Lord Ge the Transcendent’s former residence during the Wu dynasty. The alchemical well remains there.

His ancestors were from Langye. During the Later Han, the General of the Van, Marquis Tong of Lu, ceded his state to his younger brother Ai and came to settle in this land.

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* states: Ge Lu rendered great service and was enfeoffed, establishing his residence in Bowang Village. To this day, its foundations and stone pillars remain.

The *Alternative Transmission* records: His great-grandfather Lu was the General of the Van of the Han, enfeoffed as Marquis of Xiana. He ceded his state to his younger brother Ai and, feigning illness, wandered south to the lands east of the Yangtze, roaming freely among the hills and streams. Arriving in Jurong, Danyang, he marveled at its scenic beauty and pure customs, and so settled there.

The *Gazetteer of Jinling* states: The *Records of the Transcendents* records: His original surname was Zhuge. When his distant ancestor campaigned against the Jiang and Han regions and passed through Jurong in Danyang, he halted and sighed, "Alone in this place, what ‘Zhu’ is there?" Thus the Ge surname began here.

His grandfather Ju served as Prefect of Anping and Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. His father Yan, courtesy name Deru, held the posts of Registrar of the Province, Magistrate of Shanyin, Gentleman Cavalier Attendant, and Grand Master of Splendor.

The *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Thatch* states: His father’s personal name was Xiaoru.

The *Alternative Transmission* states: His father Xiaoru served as Grand Herald.

Lord the Transcendent was born on the eighth day of the fourth month in the seventh year of the *yanxi* era of the Han (jiachen year). According to the *Alternative Transmission*: His father had long practiced the Daoist arts and sent someone to the Dark Quiescence Abbey in their village to fetch fragrant water for his elder brother’s bath. At that time, a reclusive Daoist named Zhi Daoji, whose origins were unknown, happily declared, "Yesterday, I dreamed that the Perfected Lord of Penetrating Mystery descended from the Great Brahma Heaven. Tomorrow, I must go to congratulate the Grand Master on the birth of an extraordinary son." The next day, he indeed arrived to offer congratulations and requested to see the child. The father had the infant brought out, and Daoji rose in reverence. The Grand Master, astonished, inquired further. Daoji replied, "This child is enveloped in purple qi, like a jeweled canopy, with radiant divine light. He is destined to become a divine transcendent—no ordinary child." The Grand Master said, "The sages and immortals are remote and few. To have a long-lived heir would suffice."

Daoji then performed obeisance to the immortals and sages of the ten directions, offering this hymn of praise:

Though the body cycles through sacred transformations,
The soul and spirit never perish for even a moment.
Vast blessings accumulated through past lives,
Yet the vow of old is fulfilled only today.
The Perfected of Great Brahma descended,
Immortals and sages emerged bearing true essence.
Celestial dragons sprinkled fragrant blossoms,
Washing and refining my embryonic form.
Who would believe such subtle words?
Yet the divine promise is wholly fulfilled through mysterious protection.
The Dao-heart transcends duality,
The undifferentiated reveals the primordial One.
Alone I awaken to the thoughtless origin,
Liberated, I soar in the Great Vehicle.

Having chanted the hymn, he made a deep bow and departed, vanishing in an instant.

From birth, he was remarkably intelligent, his heroic bearing striking, his natural talent surpassing others. His nature and intellect were bright and flourishing; he mastered the learning of past and present, perusing all the classics, histories, and philosophical texts without exception. As Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: "He thoroughly studied the Five Classics and delighted in discourse."

At eight, his father passed away, and soon after, he lost his mother. He fulfilled the way of filial piety to the utmost, and whenever he saw gardens, ponds, pavilions, or terraces bearing traces of his father’s touch, he would raise his head to the heavens and wail, his cries moving even the birds to mournful cries. After the mourning period concluded, he harbored aspirations beyond the mundane. In daily life, he loved to play the zither, recite the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*, and lived in tranquil detachment, inwardly content and without desire.

By fifteen or sixteen, his name resounded throughout the Jiangzuo region. The provincial and prefectural authorities sought to recruit him for office, but the Transcendent Lord smiled and said, "Eating simple fare, wearing coarse cloth, resting on stone, and rinsing with flowing water—these are my joys. How could I exchange them for anything else?" He firmly declined.

Resolved to follow the footsteps of sacred peaks and seek extraordinary masters, he donned feathered robes and entered Mount Chicheng, where he concentrated his thoughts on the Dao. He regularly consumed *zhu* (atractylodes) and could fast for years without hunger. As the *Biographies* state: "At eighteen or nineteen, the Transcendent Lord traveled to Kuocang to visit his uncle Mi, styled Xiaogong, who was then teaching in his residence. He said, 'I have always felt that your profound nature is distant from worldly affairs. Gazing up at the azure clouds, looking down upon the vast sea, you have experienced all manner of hardships and dangers. Now, as the realm seeks talented scholars, why not enter official service with your extraordinary and broad learning?'

He replied, 'By nature, I am dull and unsuited to worldly use. I bear shame before my ancestors and decline the path of salary-seeking scholars and those who bear the weight of office. I shall devote myself to the mountains and caves, my heart dwelling in mist and clouds, wandering among rivers and peaks, hoping to befriend Master Jue and form ties with Red Pine.'

His uncle said, 'Your brilliance surpasses all others, transcending the ordinary and entering the realm of sages—I cannot compare.' As the *Stele Inscription of Tao* records, his great-uncle Mi served as governor of five commanderies, including Yuzhang. The *Separate Biography* mistakenly refers to him as his uncle."

He frequently traveled among the mountains of Kuocang, Nanyue, Luofu, Jinjing, Yusun, Changshan, Gaizhu, Tiantai, and Lanfeng. Though he journeyed through famous peaks, he would occasionally return to the capital, sometimes staying at the Four Views Mountain near Stone Citadel or wandering in Liezhou. He was often accompanied by Xie Zhijian, Huang Ziyang, and Guo Shengzi. As the *True Sayings* states: "The Master of the Deer Track Mountain Grotto was Xie Zhijian." It also records: "Xie Zhijian, Zhang Zhaoqi, and others sought out Mao Bodao and Liu Daogong to request the Dao. They practiced the method of consuming pine resin and *fuling* (poria), and all lived for several hundred years, traveling among the Five Peaks."

Huang Ziyang was a man of Wei. He studied the Dao in the Boluo Mountains for over ninety years, subsisting only on peach bark and drinking the yellow water from stones. Later, he encountered Sima Jizhu, who transmitted to him the *Eight Directions of Daoist Guidance*, enabling him to transcend the world. During the early Jin, the Perfected Guo Shengzi worked as a diviner in the Luoyang market.

In the first month of the second year of Guanghe during the Han, the Transcendent Lord, while on Mount Yushan in Tiantai, received a revelation from the Most High, who dispatched the Three Perfected of Primordial Unity and the Perfected of Great Ultimate, Xu, to bestow upon him the scriptures of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, secret methods of cultivation, and talismans inscribed in gold and jade. He also commanded Wang Sizhen to reveal the *Nine Radiant Jade Treasury* and present the *Seven Categories of the Great Cavern Divine Treasure Scriptures*, the *Dharma Wheel of Precepts and Admonitions*, the *Boundless Wheel of Mysterious Transformation*, the *Scripture of Entering Samadhi*, and other texts to the Transcendent Lord. As the *Separate Biography* states: "Today, the Faxing Temple at Tongxiang Abbey on Tiantai Mountain preserves the site where the Three Perfected descended with the scriptures." Li Hanguang’s *Preface to the Great Cavern Scripture* records: "The Perfected of Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, transmitted the *Great Cavern Scripture* to the Transcendent Lord."

During the early Wu period, Zuo Yuanfang came from Luoyang, and the Transcendent Lord received from him the *Seven Transformations of the White Tiger*, the *Nine Cauldrons Golden Elixir Scripture*, methods for refining qi and preserving form, secret techniques for healing illnesses and exorcising ghosts, and the *Wondrous Scripture of the Three Primordials and True Unity*. After practicing these for three years, he attained the five spiritual penetrations and could transform and wander without limit. As the *Declarations of the Perfected* states: "During the Jian’an era of the Han, Zuo Yuanfang heard of a divine mountain east of the Yangzi and crossed the river to seek it." The *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: "He was especially skilled in healing illnesses; ghosts and demons would manifest their forms, and he could either expel or slay them."

At that time, the Wu ruler admired and cherished the Transcendent Lord’s marvels, holding him in great reverence and fear. He wished to bestow honors and ranks upon him, but the Transcendent Lord refused and sought to depart, though he was not permitted. Instead, he was treated with the courtesy due a guest, and the ruler often accompanied him on outings and feasts, frequently seeking his counsel. One day, while sitting with the Wu ruler in a tower, they saw people on the road praying for rain during a prolonged drought. The Wu ruler asked, "Can the people’s prayers for rain truly be answered?"

The Transcendent Lord replied, "It is easily done." He immediately wrote a talisman and had someone place it in the village shrine. In an instant, the sky darkened, and a torrential downpour flooded the land, leaving over a foot of water in the courtyard. The Wu ruler asked, "Can the water be made to have fish?"

The Transcendent Lord said, "It can." He wrote another talisman and cast it into the water. Soon, over a hundred large fish, each one or two feet long, appeared swimming in the water. The Wu ruler asked, "Can they be eaten?"

"Yes," he replied. The fish were caught and prepared, and they were indeed real fish.

On another occasion, he accompanied the Wu ruler on a boat journey to Liezhou. On their return, they encountered a great storm. Boats of officials, large and small, were capsized and lost, and the Transcendent Lord’s boat also vanished without a trace.

The Wu ruler sighed, "Even one as accomplished in the Dao as the Transcendent Lord cannot avoid such misfortune?" He then ascended Four Directions Mountain and sent men to search for the boat. The vessel had already sunk for a full night when suddenly the Transcendent Lord was seen walking atop the water, his robes and shoes untouched by moisture. Upon arrival, he still bore the flush of wine. He apologized to the Wu ruler, "Yesterday, while attending Your Majesty, I was forcibly detained by Wu Zixu and could not depart. I regret causing Your Majesty distress by lingering exposed by the waterside."

The Wu ruler joyfully replied, "The gods must have summoned you, a consequence of your virtue and power."

*The Annals of Wu and Yue* states: Wu Zixu fell upon his sword and died. The Wu king took his corpse, placed it in a leather sack, and cast it into the Yangtze. Zixu’s spirit followed the current, riding the waves with the tides.

In a single day, the Transcendent Lord could appear in dozens of places. Once, while conversing with a guest, another Transcendent Lord was seen at the gate welcoming another visitor, and yet another by the water’s edge casting a line—none could discern which was the true one.

On another occasion, a guest arrived, and the Transcendent Lord prepared wine. No one passed the cup, yet it moved on its own to the guest’s side. If the guest did not finish drinking, the cup would not depart.

The Transcendent Lord was fond of wine, drinking up to a *hu* at a time. Whenever he became drunk, he would enter deep pools or mountain streams, emerging only after a full day when his intoxication had faded, his body never wet. He could also sit atop a pyre of burning firewood until the flames died out, his robes and cap unscorched. With a brush, he could reverse the flow of water for over ten *zhang*.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* records: My great-uncle, the Transcendent Lord, whenever deeply intoxicated or in the height of summer’s heat, would enter the depths of a deep pool and remain submerged for a full day before emerging. This was simply due to his mastery of breath-holding and embryonic respiration.

Once, while dining with a guest, the guest said, "After the meal, may we see a marvel?" The Transcendent Lord replied, "Do you seek something hasty? What would you like to witness?" He then spat out the rice in his mouth, which transformed into hundreds of large bees. They flew about buzzing, some alighting on the guest’s body, causing great alarm—though they did not sting. After a long while, he opened his mouth, and the bees flew back in. When he chewed, it was still rice.

Another time, in bitter cold, the Transcendent Lord said to his guest, "In my poverty, I cannot provide hearths for everyone. Allow me to summon heavenly fire to warm us all." He opened his mouth and exhaled, and a brilliant flame erupted, soon filling the room. The guests felt as though they stood in sunlight, yet it was not uncomfortably hot.

During the height of summer, a group of scholars asked the Transcendent Lord to perform something amusing. He lay supine while others dusted his body with powder. Before they could finish, he said, "The heat is unbearable. Let us try something else." Slowly, he rubbed his belly against the roof beams dozens of times before returning to his bed. As he descended, a mist-like vapor rose, and the powder from his belly clung to the beams, remaining there for days.

Once, while traveling, the Transcendent Lord suddenly encountered an acquaintance. He invited the man to rest beneath a tree, where he plucked a blade of grass and pierced the tree, placing a cup beneath it. Sap flowed like a spring, filling the cup before stopping. When drunk, it tasted like fine wine. He could also take earth, stones, grasses, or wood and turn them into venison when placed in the mouth.

The tree he pierced would yield sap only when his cup was placed beneath it; once full, the flow ceased. If others tried, no sap would emerge.

Dozens of curious young men followed the Transcendent Lord to study. Once, while traveling by boat, they noticed a container holding dozens of talismans and written charms. They asked what these talismans could do and if they might witness their effects. The Transcendent Lord replied, "What use are talismans?" He took one and cast it into the river, where it drifted downstream.

"What of this?" he asked.
The guests said, "We could do the same."

He took another talisman and threw it into the river, where it flowed upstream.
"What of this?"
The guests said, "That is extraordinary."

He cast a third talisman into the river, where it remained motionless. Soon, the downstream talisman rose, the upstream talisman descended, and the three merged into one. The Transcendent Lord then retrieved it.

By the riverbank stood a woman washing clothes. The Transcendent Lord said to the young men, "Shall I make this woman run for you?"
The guests replied, "Yes."

He cast a talisman into the water, and the woman immediately fled for several *li* without stopping. The Transcendent Lord said, "She may stop now." He cast another talisman into the water, and the woman halted and returned. When asked why she had run, she replied, "I do not know."

Nearby, a fisherman was preparing fish. The Transcendent Lord said to him, "Might I trouble you to send this fish to the River Earl?"
The fisherman said, "The fish is already dead. What can it do?"
The Transcendent Lord replied, "It will be no trouble."

He took the fish, inscribed a talisman with cinnabar, placed it in the fish’s mouth, and cast the fish into the water. It leapt away. Soon after, the fish returned, leaping onto the shore and spitting out a black talisman, green as a leaf, before flying away.

Once, he gave a man several dozen coins and had him scatter them into a well. He placed a vessel atop the well and called for the coins to emerge. One by one, they flew from the well’s mouth into the vessel.

He could also conjure ice and snow in summer or serve fresh melons and dates in winter. He could clap his hands to make his bed move, or point at shrimp, crabs, insects, birds, swallows, fish, or turtles, causing them to dance in perfect rhythm—halting the moment he stopped.

When walking with others, he could make them float three or four *chi* above the ground, moving as if through empty space. If someone invited him and he did not wish to go, but the host insisted, he would reluctantly comply. After a few hundred steps, he would claim a stomachache, stop, and collapse onto the ground. Soon, he would die—his head severed when lifted, his limbs severed when raised. His body would rot, teeming with maggots, making it unbearable to approach. The host, terrified, would flee to the Transcendent Lord’s home, only to find him sitting in the hall as before. The host dared not speak of it. When he returned to the place of death, the corpse had vanished.

The *Taoist Stele* records: He traversed rivers and mountains, with dragons and tigers as his attendants, his conduct enigmatic and unrestrained, overturning rivers and mountains at will. *The Declarations of the Perfected* states: He could also ride tigers and command ghosts, reaching wherever he willed. The Transcendent Lord further received from the Most High the *Thunder Rites of the Lightning Fire Palace*, enabling him to summon and dispatch thunder deities to punish the unrighteous.

There was once a spirit shrine where the deity compelled travelers to dismount a hundred paces before reaching it, or else misfortune would befall them. Within the shrine stood dozens of towering trees, their branches teeming with crows—none dared disturb them. The Transcendent Lord passed by in his carriage without dismounting. Suddenly, a great wind arose, chasing his carriage, with dust filling the sky, forcing his attendants to scatter. Enraged, he declared: "How dare this petty demon act so!" Pointing at the wind, it immediately stilled. He then cast a talisman into the shrine’s trees, and all the crows fell dead to the ground. Days later, the shrine’s trees withered in midsummer, and soon after, the entire structure burned to ashes.

Once, while passing through Wukang, he stayed at a host’s home where the host was ill, having made offerings to a wayward spirit. The spirit possessed a man and forced the Transcendent Lord to drink wine. When the spirit spoke insolently, the Transcendent Lord grew furious: "How dare you, wicked ghost!" He commanded the Five Lords to seize the spirit and bind it to a pillar, flogging its back. A figure was seen dragging the spirit out; in the courtyard, it clung to the pillar, stripped of its clothes, and cast to the ground. The sound of whipping filled the air, blood flowed freely, yet the spirit still pleaded for mercy in ghostly speech. The Transcendent Lord said: "I spare your life. Can you cure the host’s illness?" The spirit replied: "I can." The Transcendent Lord set a three-day deadline: "If the host is not healed, I will punish you." The spirit was released, and the host recovered.

Another time, passing through Huayin, a great serpent had turned into a beautiful woman to bewitch a scholar. The Transcendent Lord disguised himself as a farmer, driving a yellow calf while plowing. He warned the scholar of the serpent’s true nature and led him to an ancient well, showing him the bones of those the serpent had devoured. He instructed the scholar to flee. As the serpent, coiled in the scholar’s bed curtains, opened its jaws to strike, the Transcendent Lord swiftly beheaded it, then slew countless smaller serpents. He gave the scholar a talisman to ingest, and soon the scholar vomited a mass of earthworms, shrimp, and spiders, after which he was restored to health.

At the time, a Daoist from the Central Plains claimed to be centuries old, deceiving many. The Transcendent Lord, seeing through the fraud, later addressed his companions: "Would you like to know this man’s true age?" They assented. Suddenly, a figure descended from the heavens, drawing the gaze of all present. After a long while, it alighted on the ground, clad in vermilion robes and a *jinxian* cap, and approached the Daoist. "The Heavenly Emperor commands me to inquire: How many years have you truly lived, that you deceive the people?" The Daoist, terrified, fell to his knees and confessed: "I am seventy-three." The Transcendent Lord clapped his hands and laughed, and the vermilion-clad figure vanished. The Daoist, deeply ashamed, disappeared without a trace.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: His mastery of transformation was unparalleled. Early in his cultivation, the Transcendent Lord practiced on Purple Canopy Mountain in Kemen. The weather was bitterly cold, and he wore tattered clothes, walking barefoot. Two daughters of the Qu family, moved by his suffering, secretly crafted a pair of shoes and presented them the next day. By the time they arrived, the Transcendent Lord had already departed, though the ashes of his alchemical furnace remained warm. The sisters sifted through the ashes and found a single elixir pellet, which they divided and consumed. From then on, they never hungered again and later vanished, believed to have attained transcendence.

He also cultivated at the Lesser Grotto Heaven of Mogu Mountain in Xujiang, where he dug five wells corresponding to the Five Phases, aligning with the Five Stars. To this day, the waters of those springs ebb and flow in cycles from one to five, as if governed by a fixed measure.

*The Upper Clarity Collection* records: When Ge Xiaoxian first refined the elixir, he held prayer beads in his hand, reciting the full name of the Jade Emperor ten thousand times daily beside the furnace.

*Another Biography* states: The Transcendent Lord traversed seventy-two sacred sites for cultivation, each marked by alchemical altars and immortal traces. Finally, on the Eastern Peak of Hezao, he built the Reclining Cloud Hermitage, erecting a turtle-shaped altar to refine the Golden Elixir. At the time, auspicious vapors and propitious radiance illuminated the valleys. He often bathed the elixir in the Golden Sand Pool at the grotto’s mouth, where the waters would suddenly surge and the golden sands roil. To this day, the sands in the Elixir Pool still seethe.

He once pounded herbs in a stone mortar on the cliff of the Western Peak. A single grain fell, which a bird devoured, becoming immortal. On moonlit nights, the bird’s cries resemble the sound of a pestle, and the place is now called the Pounding Herbs Isle.

The immortal Qin Gao once visited the Transcendent Lord at Reclining Cloud Hermitage, riding a pair of carp. They drank wine until drunk and fell asleep. Upon waking, the carp had turned to stone. The Transcendent Lord then gave Qin Gao a pair of cranes, upon which he departed. The Twin Carp Stones remain on the mountain to this day.

After refining the elixir, the Transcendent Lord concealed it in a stone chamber on the Eastern Cliff, saying: "I shall wait until I have amassed merit and virtue, delivered all living beings, and offered thanks to Heaven and Earth before consuming it. Then, my name may be inscribed in the registers of the Three Heavens, and I may assume office in the Nine Empyreans, with no shame in my heart."

*Another Biography* records his elixir-completion ode:
*Flowing pearl, flowing pearl,*
*You enslave my form and frame.*
*I roam the Four Seas,*
*Perusing the scrolls of old.*
*Though I searched without cease,*
*I remained as foolish as before.*
*I burned gold talismans,*
*Exhausted mercury and pearl.*
*My wealth scattered and gone,*
*I sat hugging my knees, sighing long.*
*At sixty years of age,*
*My achievements still wavered.*
*By my teacher’s guidance,*
*I grasped the void of primordial qi.*
*From the profound and obscure,*
*I dwelled in the indistinct.*
*True yin and true yang,*
*One breath in, one breath out.*
*First, I visualized the golden crucible,*
*Then recognized the Five Furnaces.*
*Fire of *li* stirs the sea,*
*Water of *kan* ascends the void.*
*Jade nectar irrigates,*
*Flowing ghee fills the Grotto Chamber.*

The Celestial Mechanism’s true revelation—none among the myriad beings can compare.
Only true persons deliver others; this requires a great man indeed.
Heaven endures, Earth abides—together they behold the immortal capital.
Hold this in mind, hold this in mind; let my words be your record.

The Immortal Duke dwelled in the mountains, often sighing with deep concern for lost souls and stagnant spirits sunk in evil destinies. Thereupon he compiled and edited the *Lingbao* scriptures and liturgies, composing the *Great Rites of Sacrificial Refinement*, the *Precious Record for Ascending to Heaven*, and the *Secret Talismanic Essentials*. He memorialized the Heavenly Emperor to establish a ritual altar, and on every Three Primordials, Eight Festivals, and auspicious nights, he universally summoned the souls of the underworld to the altar for sacrificial refinement. After his practice, responses were repeatedly felt.

The *Separate Biography* states: During the Lower Prime of the *jiawu* year, while performing the sacrificial refinement, a ghost-king, five *zhang* in height and clad in a vermilion robe, bowed twice and said, “Every time the true immortals perform the sacrificial deliverance, several million of us ghosts are all liberated and attain rebirth. Moreover, I have heard the Northern Emperor declare: ‘The years of Ge the True Person’s sacrificial refinement have been long; his name is inscribed on the golden orchid registers and listed among the celestial bureaus.’” Having spoken, he withdrew.

Lord Sun Quan once purified himself, burned incense, and invited the Immortal Duke to inquire about the Dao of immortality. At that time, disciples Zhang Tailang, Kong Long, Zheng Siyuan, and others attended the Immortal Duke, who replied: “The Dao of immortality is subtle and wondrous. Those who study the Dao progress from the subtle to the manifest, from the near to the distant. If a ruler, amidst the myriad affairs of state, can purify his heart and guard the One, he is not far from the standard.” Lord Sun Quan praised his words.

The *Separate Biography* states: Lord Sun Quan said, “In my ignorance, I have not yet grasped the profound purport of the secret classics. What is the swiftest path to fasting, purification, and true cultivation? Among the ranks of Daoist scriptures, which should come first? Among the secret talismans and esoteric diagrams, which are the most wondrous?” The Immortal Duke rose from his seat and said, “To study the Dao and seek immortality, one must first cultivate precepts and conduct to see gradual progress. Once the Dao and conduct are established, one may then ingest elixirs, guide and lead primordial *qi*, swallow and absorb harmonious fluids, and breathe in and out yin and yang—thus one may become an earthbound immortal. To rescue from calamities, avert misfortune, and summon blessings, one must fast and purify. This teaching comes from the *Supreme Lingbao Cavernous Mystery Great Dao Limitless Natural True One Fivefold Invocation*. Its meaning and purport are vast and profound, difficult to exhaust in summary. Only the nine-times-cycled returning elixir, the golden liquid and jade nectar, allow one to ride clouds and mount cranes, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. As for the *Great Cavern True Scripture*, reciting it enables one to ascend. The *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Spiritual Diagrams of the Five Marchmounts, Ten Lands, and Seven Transformations*, and the *Seven Treasures of the Inner Chapters*—these are all treasured by the highest immortals, most revered and weighty, capable of delivering one from the calamities of the Ninefold Yang and Hundred-and-Sixfold Yin. True persons transcend the Three Realms by this Dao.”

Lord Sun Quan inscribed these words on golden tablets, sealed them in a jade casket, and revered them throughout his life. The Crown Prince Sun Deng, recognizing the Immortal Duke’s mastery of the Dao, built a separate lodge to invite him and inquired about the Way of longevity. The Immortal Duke replied: “The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate is dim and silent. Without seeing, without hearing, embrace the spirit in stillness—then the body will naturally align. Be still, be pure; do not labor your form, do not agitate your essence—only then can you attain long-lasting mystery.” This was what Guangchengzi told the Yellow Emperor. “Now, Your Highness, as heir apparent and future successor to the great treasure, the essentials lie in purifying the heart, reducing desires, distancing flatterers, honoring the worthy, promoting the heroic and talented, illuminating the realm, harmonizing the four seasons, and nurturing the common people—this is the boundless blessing of the Four Seas.” The Crown Prince approved.

The *Separate Biography* states: On the first day of the first month in the second year of *Jiahe*, he took leave of the Crown Prince and departed. One day, the Immortal Duke bid farewell to Lord Sun Quan, saying: “I, a humble dweller of the mountains and forests, have long relied on your grace and protection. Now I must depart from the vermilion steps, and fear there may be no further opportunity to meet. I wish Your Majesty would cease warfare, cherish the people, extend sincerity and bestow kindness, eternally secure the ancestral altars, and long enjoy great peace.” Lord Sun Quan said: “Your name is recorded in the cinnabar terrace—how could you long remain in the dusty world?”

In the third year of *Jiahe*, on the first day of the first month, he ascended Mount Guacang and said to his disciples Zhang Tailang, Zheng Siyuan, and others: “Recently, I was detained by the King of Wu and unable to recite the *Cavern Scripture*.” Thereupon, he devoted himself to studying and reciting the various scriptures of *Shangqing* and *Lingbao* that he had received.

On the first day of the eleventh month in the *wuwu* year of *Chiwu* (the first year of the era), the Supreme Lord dispatched celestial officials with a golden tablet and jade book, conferring titles upon the Immortal Duke. The first conferral stated: “The Jade Book of the Supreme Lord decrees: The unexcelled disciple of immortal studies, Ge Xuan, in former lives accumulated merit through arduous practice, sacrificing his body, bestowing alms, and delivering those in peril. His accumulated sincerity moved the Supreme Lord, who inscribed his name in the registers of the upper immortals in the Mysterious Capital. Thus, his brilliant wisdom and intelligence descended into the virtuous lineage. His nature was jade-like and fragrant as orchids, his celestial disposition outstanding and preeminent, his Dao-model profound and majestic, unmatched in his generation. He renounced worldly glory, embraced simplicity, valued substance, focused on immortal scriptures, contained his light, and guarded the One. He wandered the forests and foothills, disdaining the court and marketplace. His compassionate heart for delivering others was unwavering. His virtue and power now full, he is worthy of conferral. Today, We bestow upon you the Heavenly Treasure Feather Robe, the Cinnabar Cloud Embroidered Quilt, the Flying Gauze Skirt, the Hibiscus Treasure Crown, the Golden True Spirit Tiger Staff, the Demon-Subduing Banner, and the power to command the seas and summon mountains—whatever you will is accomplished.”

The second conferral stated: “The unexcelled disciple of immortal studies, Ge Xuan, has secluded himself to translate scriptures, observed long fasts, and cultivated silent contemplation with focused sincerity, unwavering in his diligence. We again bestow upon you the Eight Radiance Jade Chariot, the Dragon-Drawn Cloud Vehicle, a halo around your neck, and golden and jade insignia to reward your past virtues. May later worthies of the Dao look up to you, upholding the Dharma and revering the Supreme Lord’s teachings—this is what the Three Heavens expound.”

The third conferral stated: “The unexcelled disciple of immortal studies, Ge Xuan, embodies virtue and vast Dao, enlightening the unenlightened, universally delivering all beings to wondrous awakening. His merits accomplished and name renowned, the highest immortals submit in faith. The spirits of the Three Realms and myriad realms revere him with solemnity. His grace fills the ten directions, universally fulfilling all desires. We now confer upon you the title of Supreme Jade Capital Grand Left Palace Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate, overseeing the offices of the Six Heavens and Great Demon Kings of the Three Realms, presiding over the records of the Three Caverns. We grant you five hundred jade lads and jade maidens to attend you, holding in your left hand the flowery scepter of the Nine Luminaries and in your right the true scripture of the *Cavernous Mystery*. With dragon banners and tiger tallies, you shall roam the Nine Palaces of the Upper Clarity, thrice yearly attending the Supreme Lord in the Jade Capital and Golden Towers of the Mysterious Capital. The Supreme Lord’s conferral and the Heavenly Emperor’s endorsement follow the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens. The Heavenly Emperor, whose taboo name is Yuan, is commanded to proclaim and enact this at Huotong Mountain.”

The Immortal Duke then addressed his disciples, saying: “I have consumed all Five Sacred Fungi, and my receipt of the scriptures is now fixed. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the autumn of the seventh year, I shall ascend to the heavens.”

The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* by Wang states: “Master Ge, through seven generations of cultivation and accumulation, attained the office of Immortal Duke of the Left Palace of the Great Ultimate.” The *Alternative Biography* records: “Formerly, the True Kings and Great Emperors of the Ten Directions petitioned the Supreme Lord to expound the *Nine Heavens’ Great Brahma Thunder Jade Scripture*. The Venerable Yuanqing and others, together with the Grand Marshal Huang Tie, Thunder Envoy, and Grand Preceptor, were to attend the jade palanquin, ascending the Three Realms to present the matter before the Primordial Beginning and seek his decree for transmission.”

Presently, the two marshals returned and reported: “The hundred officials have assembled at the Three Ministries.” The Great Emperor then took up the brush of the Primordial Sovereign’s Cavernous Perfection, and with the celestial retinue—chariots, fire bells, and guardian hosts—proceeded to the gates of the Three Heavens. First, they paid homage to the Immortal Duke of the Left Palace of the Jade Capital at the Heavenly Mechanism Ministry; next, to the Governor of the Nine Provinces’ Immortals at the Heavenly Pivot Ministry; and finally, to the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens at the Supreme Mystery Capital Ministry.

Moreover, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy once commanded the Supreme Sovereign of Grand Clarity to order the Governor of the Nine Provinces’ Immortals to oversee the affairs of the Thunder Ministry’s Grand Bureau, the Immortal Duke of the Left Palace of the Jade Capital’s Great Ultimate to oversee the Thunder Ministry’s Mysterious Bureau, and the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens to oversee the Thunder Ministry’s Capital Bureau. The Great Immortal Fuqiu was to compile the records of the Thunder Ministry’s Three Ministries. Thus, it is known that the Immortal Duke’s celestial office also resides within the Three Ministries.

On the first day of the first month in the second year of the Chìwū era, the Immortal Duke ascended Laosheng Mountain to refine his spirit and contemplate the Dao. At midday, he received the *Thousandfold True Precepts* from the Supreme Lord and, together with the assembled perfected, expounded and transmitted exhortations and admonitions to the unenlightened world. At that time, the Lord of Wu established the Cavernous Mystery Abbey for the Immortal Duke on Fang Mountain.

The *Six Dynasties Records of Jinling* states: “The Immortal Duke attained the Dao atop Fang Mountain and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The mountain retains the Washing Medicine Pool, now called the White Upper Pool.” The *Veritable Records of Jiankang* notes: “Fang Mountain still holds the Immortal Duke’s cauldron for decocting medicine and his mortar.”

The Immortal Duke had over five hundred disciples, among whom Zhang Tailang, Kong Long, and Zheng Siyuan were his inner-chamber disciples, along with Li Can and Wang Xuanchong. The *Alternative Biography* records: “At that time, Li Can of Shu Commandery and Wang Xuanchong sought the Dao at Crane Cry Cloud Terrace on Mount Song’s Shaoshi Peak. Hearing of the Immortal Ge in Wu, they went to study under him. They asked: ‘The Dao begins with the Primordial, without before or after, without ancient or modern. We do not know what comes first or last.’

The Immortal Duke replied: ‘Originally, there was no distinction of before or after, left or right, high or low, noble or base, or form. Thus, it is named the Dao.’

The Immortal Duke further said: ‘Your past lives destined you for transcendence.’ Thereupon, on Mount Tiantai, he established an altar and conferred the *Chart of the Five Sacred Peaks’ True Forms*, saying: ‘This is the token of the Supreme Lord’s transmission, revered by the Queen Mother of the West. Wielding it, the mountain spirits and demon kings shall all be commanded, and the Three Realms shall pay homage.’

He also bestowed the *Supreme Lord’s Scripture of the Golden Elixir*, the *Five Sacred Treasures’ Radiant Writ of Spontaneous Numinosity*, the *Three Sovereigns’ Inner Writ*, the *Scripture of Great Possession’s Mysteries*, the *Purple Writ of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern*, the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, the *Illuminated Mirror’s Charts and Records*, the *Golden Writ and Jade Characters*—nearly ten scrolls in all—as well as the Great Ultimate’s Dragon-Soaring Sacred Fungi. He charged the immortal officials to wear and bear them, and instructed his inner-chamber disciple Zheng Siyuan to transmit the oral instructions.

The *Six Dynasties Records of Jinling* states: “Bai Zhongdu, a disciple of the Immortal Duke, also ascended to heaven in broad daylight.”

The Immortal Duke once told Siyuan and the others: “Formerly, I received the *Grand Clarity* and other elixir scriptures from Zuo Yuanfang. Now, I entrust them all to you. However, the celestial prohibitions are strict—do not transmit them to the unworthy. If there are those of sincere aspiration, they should be conferred in accordance with the *Four Poles’ Luminous Precepts*, with oaths and kneeling. The various talismans and registers—the *Cavernous Perfection*, *Cavernous Mystery*, *Cavernous Spirit*, and *True Scriptures*—were bestowed upon me by the True Person Xu Laile of the Great Ultimate. These are forbidden texts of the Upper Realms, guarded by flying immortals. After my ascension, transmit them to the renowned mountains and grottoes of the immortal terraces. Do not obstruct the celestial Dao.”

He also gave each a pill of the immortal medicines, along with the *Flowing Brilliance* and *Seven Luminaries’ Purple Elixir*. After consuming the elixir, their spirits became joyful, their bodies light, and they no longer suffered hunger or thirst. He then said to Xuanchong and the others: “You should return to Mount Song and fast for three years, then proceed to Wangwu Mountain to refine the great Dharma.”

Xuanchong and the others pleaded to remain in attendance, but he said: “If your hearts hold me, you shall see me. There is no need for attachment. The perfected of Mount Song’s heights shall further instruct you. After five years, I shall transmit to you the secret instructions, perfecting your Dao, so that you may perceive the formless as clearly as objects in a bright mirror.”

He further said: “You shall reside on the Terrace of Gentle Winds for three hundred years before ascending to heaven. Some attain celestial ascent immediately, while others take ten, dozens, or hundreds of years—even thousands or tens of thousands of years—before ascending. This depends on one’s innate destiny and the measure of one’s merit and practice. Before attaining ascent, all dwell in the Five Sacred Peaks, renowned mountains, the Eight Seas, the Ten Continents, or the Three Isles. Therein lie palaces of the seven treasures, jade chambers, and countless immortal medicines and wondrous treasures beyond description. Phoenixes and qilin leap and dance, while jade trees and gem forests produce spontaneous music. Most immortals who have not yet ascended reside in these renowned mountains. The key lies in diligent practice.”

The *Alternative Biography* records: “Xuanchong and the others knelt and asked: ‘We have heard of the Seven Sages clad in seven-colored Dharma robes, and of the Two Supreme Immortals dwelling on Mount Zhongnan, Red Wall, or Mount Song. May we know which scriptures record this?’

The Immortal Duke replied: ‘The Supreme Immortals are the True Person of the Southern Culmen and the Attendant of the Southern Culmen.’”

The so-called "transformation of the Ten Directions' divine immortals" is true and authentic. The *Mysterious Record of the Seven Sages* states: "The Red Lord descended to teach the Way of Transformation, revealing the names of himself and his six disciples." As the Immortal Duke’s ascension drew near, he was to establish an altar and perform a grand offering to thank Heaven, Earth, the mountains, rivers, and the hundred spirits. Within the Blessed Court, he erected an altar named the Eight Radiant Sceneries, choosing an auspicious day to ascend and make his gratitude known to Heaven and Earth.

At that moment, celestial blossoms danced in the sky, and divine light illuminated the heavens. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the seventh year of the Red Crow era, suddenly ethereal immortal music resounded, banners and canopies filled the sky, and a feathered chariot drawn by qilin descended from the void. Immortal youths, jade maidens, and spirit officials descended to the altar, while a flying celestial deity, bearing a jade edict, addressed the Immortal Duke: "The Supreme Lord has issued a decree." The Immortal Duke bowed twice and received the edict, which read:

*"The peerless disciple of the Dao, master of the Great Dharma Lineage of the Lingbao Scriptures, Ge Xuan, has long devoted himself to the Supreme Way, nurturing the essence of the primordial embryo. He has expounded the true scriptures and refined the souls of the departed, compiling immortal classics to enlighten later learners. His hidden virtues have aided the world, and his secret practices align with the perfected. His name is inscribed in the Jade Capital, and his body shall return to the celestial realms. By special decree, he is hereby elevated to the rank of Supreme Left Palace Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate in the Jade Capital of the Supreme Lord, entrusted with overseeing the Six Heavens and the Great Demon Kings of the Two Realms, and presiding over the affairs of the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliary Scriptures. He shall ascend on the noon hour of the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the jiazi year, proceeding directly to the Celestial Court. Furthermore, he is bestowed with a jade casket of golden elixir, immortal robes, and other treasures. The Supreme Lord’s decree commands the Celestial Emperor to prepare the reception in accordance with the ancient rites of the Three Heavens. The Celestial Emperor, whose taboo name is Yuan, shall dutifully announce and execute this decree at the Blessed Court of Hezao."*

After receiving the edict, the Immortal Duke knelt and consumed the golden elixir. He then bid farewell to his disciples and ascended the Robing Terrace, donning a gown of *li* silk and a lotus crown. A halo encircled his neck, and he held a jade tablet. Clad in crimson skirts, vermilion shoes, and jade pendants chiming softly, he seated himself in the Eight Radiant Jade Palanquin. Banners of rainbow hues and scarlet standards led the procession, while immortal youths and jade maidens flanked him on either side. Auspicious clouds and white cranes spiraled through the azure sky as he ascended gently. His disciples, led by Zou Ming, clung to him in reluctance. The Immortal Duke halted his chariot midair and composed two poems before continuing his ascent.

The first poem read:
*"The Perfected One once left teachings,
Moved by pity for the foolish and deluded.
Those who obscure the truth and spurn the Way
Bring calamity and chaos upon themselves.
Their bodies fade like morning dew,
Regret lingers without end.
Their sins vast and unhidden,
Their poisonous legacy—who shall remedy it?
In darkness, their fate remains unseen,
Only at the end of the kalpa shall it cease.
Reincarnated in destitute households,
They toil once more as servants.
Their limbs may wither,
Hobbling through markets to beg.
Unknowing of karmic retribution,
They curse the gods for their plight.
The Great Way is ever wuwei,
Its flourishing begins with goodness.
Now I attain lightness of being,
Through cultivation and merit.
The Three Realms bow in reverence,
As I ascend to the Purple Palace.
Pausing in the Void’s expanse,
Life flows like water.
At parting, I inscribe these words,
Roughly marking the wondrous and profound."*

The second poem read:
*"Now I ascend to Heaven,
Moved by pity for all learned souls.
The Great Way embodies the Void’s origin,
Serene, yet within it lies essence.
Though it seems obscure and dim,
Within its depths shines clarity.
Do not call the Way false or vain—
The fault lies in lack of sincerity.
Why not climb the famed mountains,
And recite the *Dongzhen* scriptures?
With each chant and intonation,
The mysterious sound reaches the Great Clarity.
The Supreme Lord’s golden visage radiates,
As all immortals join in harmony.
Fragrant blossoms scatter from the Ten Directions,
Incense smoke and sandalwood melodies arise.
The Royal Consort performs the Nine Shao,
Phoenixes sing in perfect accord.
Dragon chariots veil the sky in welcome,
Canopies gleam through the distant void.
I steal a moment at the Terrace of Kalpas,
Where Indra descends in reverence.
The Eight Kings offer the elixir of cinnabar,
Its draught makes the body light.
Carefree, I wander beyond being and non-being,
Radiant, beyond form and name.
Divine youths attend at my side,
Naturally paying homage to the myriad spirits.
Soaring in the Eight Radiant Palanquin,
I feast in the White Jade Capital.
Seven generations of ancestors dwell in the Hall of Blessings,
The departed all transcend to new life.
Kings and lords who hold steadfast faith
Shall surely become the pillars of the world.
The Great One embodies supreme virtue,
All things benefit from its fulfillment."*

A third poem followed:
*"Wandering idly through mountains and waters,
Exhaling and inhaling the numinous harmony.
Refining qi in pursuit of the subtle and formless,
Silently reciting the *Daode* chapters.
With utmost sincerity, I venerate the Mysterious One,
And now my hidden merits are revealed.
A flying chariot drawn by nine dragons,
Soaring through purple mist.
Resplendent light illumines the celestial thoroughfare,
Crimson clouds gather before the Emperor.
Briefly pausing at Penglai Palace,
In an instant, I become a guest of Heaven.
The assembly of perfected ones, majestic,
Transcends the profound and mysterious.
My form is eternal, beyond kalpas,
My golden countenance ever fresh as the sun.
Rejoicing in the Supreme Lord’s realm,
Yet grieving for all the stubborn and foolish.
Who can escape decay and death?
Only by weaving the threads of the unseen.
Vast and boundless, the Perfect Way,
Entering the realm of no-questions.
Subtle and wondrous, hard to fathom—
The wise call me worthy.
If one can propagate its myriad wonders,
Lightness of being ascends to immortality."*

At the time of his ascension, the Immortal Duke was eighty-one years old. During his lifetime, he often rested upon a paulownia wood table, which, after his ascension, transformed into a three-legged white muntjac that roamed the mountains. The *Inscription of Tao* records: "The three-legged white muntjac lived for a century without change." Kong Yan’s *Records of Kuaiji* states: "After the Immortal Duke attained the Way, his table transformed into a three-legged beast. To this day, people in Shangyu often encounter this table in the mountains—an omen of imminent flight."

Earlier, the Immortal Duke had once traveled to Kuaiji. A merchant returning from the sea recounted: "I passed a divine temple where the temple deity sent his registrar to convey a message: ‘I wish to send a letter to Master Ge. Please deliver it.’ The registrar then cast a sealed letter onto the bow of my ship, as if nailed in place, impossible to remove." Upon reaching Kuaiji, the merchant reported this to the Immortal Duke, who retrieved the letter himself. The inscription read: *"To the Left Palace Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate."* Jia Shanxiang’s *Biographies of Eminent Daoists* notes: "It was a letter from the Young Lord of the Eastern Flower, written entirely in ancient tadpole script."

The Immortal Duke once composed a *Preface to the Daode Jing* and *The Transmission Lineage of the Classic of Purity and Stillness*. He also authored *Three Scrolls on Grain-Abstention Formulas*, *Nineteen Scrolls on Entering the Mountains and Refining Spirit*, and compiled the *Ten-Scroll Compassionate Daoist Ritual for the Nine Dark Realms*. The *Old唐书·Bibliographic Treatise* states: "The Record of the Immortal Duke Ge includes *Three Scrolls of the Golden Instructions of Hu Zifang*."

**Inscription on the Immortal Duke’s Alchemical Well**
*Composed by Fang Junjingtong of Pu River in the Song Dynasty*

When the Immortal Duke withdrew in obscurity,
he refined elixirs in the long forest.
When the Immortal Duke manifested in radiance,
his fame flowed across the isles.

A white muntjac on the square terrace,
cinnabar and yellow gold.
His spirit soared through the ten thousand heavens,
yet the well remains to this day.

Azure script in a Sanskrit case,
a silver well-curb half a *xun* deep.
Its waters, pure and icy-cold,
wash the heart and cleanse the mind.

The virtue-ground remains unchanged,
a shallow bucket draws from the deep.
May I long guide this people,
knowing to honor the Azure Origin.

Inquiring of his old village,
I revere his legacy.
I carve this inscription in the jade hall,
to transmit it forever.

**Stele for the Left Palace Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate, Lord Ge**
*Composed by Tao Hongjing, the Recluse of Huayang, in the Liang Dynasty*

That which crowns the Two Modes before their inception,
whose name transcends the beginning of the ten thousand things—
these are matters beyond the reach of speech,
beyond the grasp of names.

How then to record it in writing?
How to transmit it through metal and stone?
If antiquity had truly ceased,
the sun and moon would shine in vain.
If it had fallen into silence,
mankind would remain in eternal darkness.

Thus, the Two Scrolls emerged from the pass,
their jade script ascending to the azure.
They revealed to those who embrace the numinous and hold knowledge
that within the unfathomable, there is essence.

Since that time, through successive generations,
cloud-seal and dragon-script missives have appeared,
their radiance illuminating the mountain groves.
Resplendent phrases and luminous qi have flourished in courts and halls.
Those whose teachings could serve as models and whose words could be sung
have continued to this day.

In former times, Gan Zuo of the left was startled by the King of Wei,
while Xiang Feng monopolized marvels under the Wu sovereign.
Yet among them, the talent of the Immortal Duke Ge shone most brilliantly.

Though the Duke wandered through famous peaks in his time,
he often dwelled on this ridge.
Though not a grotto-palace, it spanned the central river.
Gazing east, peaks stretched into the sea;
looking south, layered ridges pierced the clouds.
Westward lay the river’s expanse,
northward the outskirts of the city.
This was a luminous and secluded realm,
a pivotal crossing for retreat and emergence.

Here stood a stone well half a *xun* deep,
its depths unfathomable no matter how much was drawn.
A three-legged white muntjac, unchanged in form for a century,
was untouched by the numinous and guarded by spirits.

Disciples like the hemp-robed and historiographers gathered here,
finding refuge in succession.
Later, Sun Weizu also resided for years in Shanyin.
Fan Hong and Yuwen Sheng, from their youth, embraced the Daoist nature,
their wills resolute and minds luminous.
Formerly, they dwelled in Yuyao, at the Four Bright Peaks,
and established an abbey at Oh-Guk.
A hundred *li* upward, the path was overgrown and perilous,
yet their arts proved efficacious, winning the people’s devotion.

In the seventh year of *Tianjian* (508 CE),
the powerful and venerable of the prefecture and county,
without awaiting imperial decree,
chose this mountain—situated at the crossroads of five counties—as their dwelling.
They remained here for fifteen years,
then sought to relocate to the altar above.
A broken stele had long lain fallen,
but Hong thought:
*"Those who shelter beneath a tree cherish even its branches—
how could the true and sacred traces of the Immortal Duke be allowed to vanish?"*

Thus, he erected a new stele in its place,
wishing to inscribe his name beside it for eternal transmission.
Though the Recluse dwells far away,
he engraved these words upon the stone.

The Immortal Duke’s surname was Ge, his given name Xuan, and his courtesy name Xiaoxian.
He was a native of Jiyang Village, Duxiang Township, Jurong County, Danyang.
Originally of the Langye lineage, his ancestor was the Marquis of Tong in the Later Han,
who ceded his state to his younger brother and settled here.

His seventh-generation ancestor, Ai, was the younger brother of the Marquis of Tong and inherited the title.
His grandfather, Ju, served as Prefect of Anping, Gentleman of the Yellow Gate.
His great-uncle, Mi, governed five commanderies, including Yuzhang.
His father, Yan, styled Deru, held the posts of Registrar of the Province, Magistrate of Shanyin, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness.

Generation after generation, his family produced men of brilliance,
their lineage foremost in the annals of Wu.

From childhood, the Duke possessed extraordinary conduct, surpassing his peers.
His spirit was lofty, his purity radiant, his bearing transcendent.
Though he never studied the classics, he grasped the Dao and its arts;
what he heard, he understood at once.
He was not bound by conventional norms or constrained by thought,
but stood beyond the realm of emotions and principles,
beyond words and images.

In the early Wu period, Zuo Yuanfang came from Luoyang
and transmitted to him the *Seven Transformations of the White Tiger Furnace* and the *Nine Elixirs*.
Thereafter, his fivefold penetrations were complete,
and his transformations knew no bounds.

Though Sun Quan admired the immortal and the strange,
he harbored secret malice.
Those like Fan Ying were rebuffed and dismissed,
but all revered and deferred to the Immortal Duke.

The Duke traversed rivers and mountains,
attended by dragons and tigers.
He frequented Changshan and Gaizhu,
and often sojourned in Tiantai and Lanfeng.
When he returned to the capital,
he treated people as playthings,
his conduct enigmatic and unrestrained,
his feats overturning rivers and mountains.
Even the tales of tossing a shoe to make a stone sheep rise
paled in comparison.

At that time, a man adrift at sea,
buffeted by winds and waves without end,
suddenly encountered a divine isle.
There, someone gave him a letter, inscribed:
*"To be delivered to the Immortal Duke Ge."*
He was instructed to return to Wu and present it.
From then on, the world unanimously hailed him as the Immortal Duke.
Thus, Ge Hong’s writings state:
*"My great-uncle was the Immortal Duke,"*
for the Immortal Duke was indeed Ge Hong’s third-generation ancestor.

Common texts and traditions claim
he was appointed by the Great Ultimate and held the position of Left Palace Immortal Duke.
Yet works like the *True Records* and the *Old Genealogy of the Ge Clan*
contain discrepancies.
Perhaps the teachings vary, or the accounts were tailored to the times.
It is like holding a halberd at the palace steps—
how could one expect to pluck the three sacred peaches?
Or to command spirits and dispatch ghosts?
How could one know he remained in a minor post?
Judging by the authority of the Way,
such distinctions need not be debated.

The Immortal Duke ascended to immortality
at dawn on the fifteenth day of the eighth month of the *jiazi* year of the *Chiwu* era (244 CE).

The Immortal Duke departed never to return, long accompanied by Guo Shengzi and others. He was appointed to the sacred rank of Heavenly Office in the Mysterious Capital, assisting the Four Auxiliary Deities in governing and overseeing the affairs of humans and spirits. Gazing toward his former homeland, how could he not sigh with longing for the past? Yet turning to later disciples, he extended his compassionate guidance. I, a humble descendant of his lineage, dare to recount these matters, preserving the exemplary model of a perfected immortal.

The nine heavens stretch boundless, the seven luminaries hang suspended in void. Space divides to form realms, qi gathers to construct the heavens. Things multiply after numbers, transformations arise before images. Life follows form in its turning, spirit is entrusted through deeds in transmission. Frost withers the withered fields, bamboo thrives on emerald slopes. Springs and ruins share a common fate—only Peng and Xian return. Birth is shaped by affairs, years are parsed by learning. Like gold in the forge, like silk on the loom, the Immortal Duke’s jade tablet gleamed, his brilliance emerging with age. As a child, he rivaled Xiang Tuo at the frontier; as a youth, he mirrored Xiang Ru in bearing. He bathed his essence in the brocade chamber, concentrated his mind on the dark peaks. His tiger-like transformation was already complete, his dragon chariot soon arrived to summon him. He journeyed to the Tai and Huo mountains, roamed the orchid-laden vault of heaven. The azure altar remained solemn, the jade waters flowed without end. He patrolled fragrant groves to bathe in the Dao, his heart stirred with reverence for the ancients. This towering stele proclaims his lofty virtue, eternally fanning the noble wind.

The orchid breeze lingers in repose, already inscribed upon this grand monument. Though this land was his former dwelling, no stele of enduring stone was carved. Now, distant descendants gaze in admiration at his pure legacy. With reverence, they contemplate erecting a monument to transmit his fragrance to future generations.

In the Song dynasty, an edict proclaimed: "Mountains and rivers, sacred sites where immortals and sages dwell—those whose profound virtue and illustrious deeds are renowned in the world, We must rank and sacrifice to them. The Perfected One’s words establish the ultimate principle; he enters and exits without obstruction, soaring with the Dao. His altars and jade palaces have stood for ages. His prayers and exorcisms bring auspicious responses, bestowing blessings upon the people. Thus, We confer honors and specially establish a lofty title. May he continue to drink in reverence and eternally bless this land. Let him be specially enfeoffed as the *Perfected Lord of Penetrating Response*." In the third year of *Chongning*.

Another edict stated: "Zhuang Zhou said: 'The spirit-like person ensures that things suffer no blight and the harvests ripen.' This is what we mean by an immortal. Cultivating the wondrous Dao on famous mountains, the tradition of ascending in flight has long endured. During the *Chongning* era, the stele of the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate, Lord Ge, was already granted enfeoffment. Now, the regional commissioner has submitted a petition from the local people, reporting the efficacy of his prayers, the resonance of his responses, and the abundance of successive harvests. We have no particular fondness for fangshi, but We commend his merit among the people and thus command the ritual officials to expand his title. Though he rides clouds and drives the wind, roaming beyond the eight limits—what need has he for a name? Yet this serves to demonstrate Our esteem. Let him be specially enfeoffed as the *True Lord of Penetrating Response and Blessed Protection*." In the sixth year of *Chunyou*.

The *Comprehensive Biography of the Great Ultimate and Immortal Lord Ge* concludes.
