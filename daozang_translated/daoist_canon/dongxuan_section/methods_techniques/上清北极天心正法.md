# 上清北极天心正法

*The Supreme Clarity Northern Culmen Celestial Heart Orthodox Method*

*The Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Northern Culmen Celestial Heart Orthodox Method* is of unknown authorship, emerging during the Southern Song dynasty. It comprises a single fascicle. The base text is derived from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, under the category of Methods in the Cavernous Mystery Division.

**The Celestial Heart Method**

The Celestial Heart Method was bestowed by the Most High upon Mount Cranecall, where daily he instructed the Celestial Master in the scriptures of the Northern Culmen, its purpose being to repel and expel demonic forces and to deliver the people. Of old, the transmitted Celestial Heart Orthodox Method consisted solely of three talismans: first, the Talisman of the Great Sage of the Celestial Pivot; second, the Talisman of the Black Destructor; and third, the Three Luminaries Talisman.

As for the Three Luminaries Talisman, it is bound above to the Three Sovereigns, its Dao resonating with the Three Realms, its virtue manifesting the Three Powers, and its truth issuing from the Three Masters—thus is it named the Celestial Heart. It is the origin of the myriad Dao, the progenitor of all methods.

Master Void Tranquility stated: There are two seals. The first is the Seal of the Northern Culmen Demon-Quelling Court, also called the Seal of the Lord of All-Heaven, Commander of Ghosts and Spirits Across the Three Realms. The second is the Seal of the Great Dharma Lord of All-Heaven. Simple yet not cumbersome, they were entrusted to extraordinary individuals and transmitted through the ages.

When a Dharma officer enters the afflicted household, he employs the method of transformation.

When entering an afflicted household, perform the Ninefold Stem of the Celestial Pole, and visualize yourself as the Primordial Sovereign. The Nine Phoenixes of the South spew true fire, reducing the stricken dwelling to ashes that scatter on the wind. A single gust from the Thunder Wind purifies all, transforming it into a towering palace—the Hall of Golden Splendor. Its inhabitants become celestial immortals, and beneath the palace, nine giant turtles soar. The lofty towers are wreathed in purple mist, while myriad golden rays burst forth from Fusang.

On all sides stretch vast seas, their waves surging and boiling without bound. The endless billows span ten thousand leagues, devoid of boats or oars. I then enter, wielding the Celestial Pole, transforming into the Primordial Sovereign to command the armored hosts. The Orthodox Unity of the Mysterious Center attends my body, while the Four Saints, the Three Officials, and the marshals, along with the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits, all descend. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Qilin, and Master Phoenix soar forth. Thunder and lightning clash as they advance before me, while my body, imbued with the Five Pecks of qi, conceals the hun-souls.

The Celestial Pole’s crimson qi clears the path ahead, as iron nets weave above and below. On all ten sides and eight directions, soldiers and generals stand arrayed, their banners and standards lining the ranks of ten thousand troops. Knocking the teeth to gather the spirits and circulating the Three qi, recite the incantation to slay ghosts—naturally efficacious.

**Transformation of the Vast Sea Mudra:**
Clasp the *hai* position, press the upper *jia* to the fourth, third, and second fingernails below. Flick outward to manifest a vast sea, boundless and indistinct, its waves spanning ten thousand leagues, encircling the dwelling on all sides.

**Mudra of the Void Sovereign’s Terrace:**
Press the *chou* position with the thumb, then trace upward to *wu*. Flick outward to transform the house into a divine immortal’s palace, its twelve steps aligned with the *ding* and *wai* positions. Gargle water three times, shout the transformation thrice, and with eyes closed, visualize the dwelling as twelve towering pavilions. Bones and flesh become immortals, jade maidens revel above, while below, giant turtles bear them to and fro across the fathomless sea.

**Mudra of the Boat and Oars:**
Press the *yin* position with the thumb, then rotate sequentially to *hai*. Flick outward to visualize the sea devoid of boats or oars, leaving ghosts and spirits without passage.

**Mudra of the Four Quadrants’ Iron Barrier Reaching Heaven:**
Right hand facing upward, left hand facing downward, the right hand’s second fingernail presses the root of the left hand’s second finger. The left thumb presses the right hand’s third finger, then the right hand’s fourth finger passes over the back to meet the middle finger’s middle joint, pressing the upper segment. The five fingers press the backs of the left hand’s five fingernails. Bend and straighten the right hand’s second finger, visualizing an iron barrier stretching from heaven to earth, sealing off malevolent spirits and blocking all entry.

When the Dharma master departs, he rides a black cloud across the sea, dissolving the iron barrier—opening before and closing behind. Stand with feet together, then step forward and close behind.

**Purification of the Altar Incantation:**
Above in heaven, below on earth,
Mighty Heavenly Ding spirits,
Assist my Dharma,
Sweep away demonic miasma.
Foul qi swiftly perish,
Demonic miasma cleansed.
May the altar be swiftly purified,
The Dao’s qi eternally abide.

**Left Hand’s Slaying Mudra:**

**Left Hand’s Celestial Heart Mudra, Right Hand’s Dipper Seal:**
Visualize oneself in the likeness of the Heavenly Master.

**Concealing the Hun-Souls into the Dipper Incantation:**
I receive the Heavenly Master’s Heart Treasure Seal,
Endowed by nature,
Communing with the hidden and reaching the netherworld,
Ascending through the grotto-heavens.
I tread the Yu step, aspiring to transcendence.

*Right hand forms the Northern Dipper Mudra,*
The third fingertip inhales seven breaths of qi,
Seven stars reside at the right mansion—these are the Seven Po.
Follow my Yu step,
Aspiring to cross the numinous barrier.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

**Stepping the Huoluo Dipper:**
After the Summer Solstice, lead with the right foot.
After the Winter Solstice, lead with the left foot.
On yang days: *"The Dipper’s mystery, ah—twelve celestial hours."*
On yin days: *"Sun and moon shine bright, Heaven and Earth unite."*
The *Hetu* conceals the spirits within the Nine-Palace Dipper—
*Wearing nine atop, treading one below, three to the left, seven to the right.*
*Two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet.*
*Five dwells within, forming the solid belly.*
*A thousand evils, ten thousand ghosts—all submit as guests.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*

**Heavenly Heart Summoning Generals Incantation:**

Six Jia spirit-generals—
*Swiftly summon the true general, hasten to descend!*
By the Emperor’s decree, obey and act accordingly.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*
*Right hand forms the Dipper Mudra, Heaven’s Gate qi summons the generals—use as desired.*

**Talisman-Writing Visualization Formula:**
First, purify the heart—banish stray thoughts.
Sit facing the established direction, toward the breaking point.
Visualize the Three Clarities, gaze upward into the void.
Command the Four Sages, the ten thousand soldier-generals.
Envision my body assuming the exorcising form.

**Celestial Heart Orthodox Dharma Seal and Talismanic Script**
**The True Talisman of the Heavenly Stem Great Sage for Exorcising Ghosts by Imperial Decree**

As the Daoist scriptures state: The Heavenly Stem Great Sage is invoked to repel disasters for the state. When the sun and moon lose their proper course, when comets appear in daylight, when drought, flood, locusts, or pestilence rage, when malevolent spirits and ghosts enter the land or manifest, when grotesque and monstrous forms invade human dwellings, hurling bricks and tiles, summoning winds and setting fires, bewildering the living—then inscribe the True Form Talisman of the Heavenly Stem. Visualize the Breaker of Armies, aligning it correctly as prescribed.

On the preceding night, prepare incense, flowers, wine, and fruit to honor the Heavenly Stem Great Sage, and leave brush and ink exposed beneath the talisman. At dawn, banish all extraneous thoughts, purify body and mind, and inscribe the talisman according to the method.

**The "Heaven" Character Form**
**The "Stem" Character Form**
**The "Great" Character Form**
**The "Sage" Character Form**
**The "Decree" Character Form**
**The "Slay" Character Form**

While inscribing the talisman, recite the Heavenly Stem Mantra and Decree. Visualize the true *qi* of the Heavenly Regulator, the Star of the Demon-Quelling Venerable, entering the talisman. Clasp the Stem and Eye mudras.

For warding homes and expelling evil, this method yields profound efficacy. Alternatively, hand over the talisman, spray water, and clench the Sword Mudra, declaring:

*"Celestial Spirit, Earthly Spirit,
The Three and Five conjoin in harmony.
By Imperial Decree I act,
To scrutinize and bind wayward spirits.
Direct-Day Merit Officers,
Attending officials and marshals,
Delay not, tarry not—
Hasten forth, return swiftly,
For I await in command."*

**Next, Circulate the Thunder Formation**

*"Heavenly Thunder rumbles low—*Zi.
*Earth Thunder, Yin Thunder, Yang Thunder—*
Thunder’s might stirs and shakes.
Dragon and Tiger cross paths,
Sun and Moon array in order—*Yin.
Radiance shines clear—*Mao.
Twelve Merit Officers—*Chen.
Five Thunder Envoys,
Six Jia and Six Ding,
Bear the talisman forth—*Wu Tiao.
Swift as law commands!"*

**First Revolution:** Six Spirits conceal—*Yin* to *Mao.*
**Second Revolution:** Four Malevolents vanish—*Chen.*
**Third Revolution:** The Stem and Culmen move—*Wu.*
**Fourth Revolution:** Thunderfire surges—*Zi.*
**Fifth Revolution:** Thunderbolts strike—*You.*
**Sixth Revolution:** Mountain ghosts perish—*Xu.*
**Seventh Revolution:** All rebels against Heaven, all lawless specters with severed feet, are seized.

*"Whatever demonic affliction plagues this body,
Come before my Stem and Culmen,
Beneath the Five Thunders,
To meet your death—
Move not, act not!
Swift as law commands!"*

**Mantra and Mudra for Circulating the Thunder Formation**
When circulating thunder, use the mudra to stir the Kidney Palace, raising the Kidney Water upward while the Heart Fire’s red *qi* descends, merging with the Kidney *qi*. The two *qi* blend and fuse, generating thunder and lightning.

Circulate with both hands in the Thunder Formation, guiding it to the crown of the head. Extend the mudra, cover the ears to produce thunder, flash the eyes thrice for lightning, exhale through the nose for wind, expel breath from the mouth for clouds, and spray water thrice for rain.

Send forth the talisman with the dispatching mudra, transforming and invoking the talismanic water. The bearer becomes a Heavenly Ding Warrior or the Direct-Day Merit Officer. For hastening childbirth, the bearer becomes the Hastening Birth Lad or the Birth-Supervising Great Spirit. The talisman-bearer must not pause or rest along the way.

**Ancient Three Lights Talisman**
Before inscribing the talisman, sit facing the Destruction Palace, cast the *Zi-Wu* Dipper, and cover the body as prescribed. Invoke *qi* into the cinnabar inkwell, visualizing radiance filling the vessel. Recite the incantation:

*"The Great Sun shines true,
Evil ghosts wane in its light.
Divine cinnabar gleams bright as day,
Ninefold dew from the Supreme Canopy.
Three *qi* form the Terrace,
Seven *qi* form the Dipper.
Both stars shine forth—
Where the talisman arrives, pursuit is certain.
Ink becomes the divine sword,
Brush the halberd and glaive.
Inkstone the Dragon Pool,
Water the Dragon Ford.
By brushwork, illness is cured,
All evil vanishes.
As the law commands!"*

Next, clasp the Sun Lord Mudra at the upper joint of the left middle finger.

**Round Radiance, Square Image, Round Shadow Talisman**
Recite the Sun Mantra. Visualize the purple *qi* of the sun, nine-rayed, blown into the talisman with the *Tiao* mudra.
Recite the Moon Mantra. Visualize the white *qi* of the moon, ten-rayed, blown into the talisman with the *Tiao* mudra.
Seven revolutions.
Recite from *Kui* to *Piao*. Clasp the *Chen* mudra, draw the Stem into the talisman.
Upon completing the form, recite the invocation for the Heavenly Stem Great Sage to descend, infusing the true *qi* into the ghost’s heart.

**Five Fires Three Lights Talisman**
**Talisman-Consecrating Mantra**

The talismans of Heaven are efficacious,
The talismans of Earth are efficacious.
The Six Jia and Six Ding spirits seize all demonic essences.
When the talisman arrives, all maladies are cured.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!

**Another Talisman: Five Fires Three Lights Talisman**
Upon completing the inscription of the right talisman,
Recite the Stem Mantra, then the Consecration Mantra of Heavenly Emperor Śakra.
Further recite the *Hun* and *Yuepo* Mantras, dispatching the divine generals forth.
Within the Thunder Formation, draw *qi* into the water.

**Great Three Lights Talisman**
**Black Malevolence True Form Talisman**

In the practice of the Dao, nothing precedes the drawing of *qi*.
For when *qi* is correct, the talisman is efficacious;
When the general is correct, the method is verified.
There has never been one who practiced without knowing the pathways of *qi*.
Though the methods and gates are manifold, none have definitively expounded them.
The method of drawing *qi* takes the Three Lights as its essence in the *Tianxin Zhengfa*.
The Numinous Writ of the Southern Quarter takes the Vermilion Mound as its root,
Yet does not reveal the Vermilion Mound’s directional mantras.
The various numinous writs of the schools merely record the drawing of *qi* from a given direction,
Without pointing to its source.
Thus, those who transmit the teachings to later learners err in a hundred ways.
When talismanic water fails to respond, they blame the Great Dao,
Unknowing that the fault lies in the transmission itself—how pitiable!
Herein it is set forth in full.
Those who delve deeply into it shall find it most fitting.

The *Shangqing* Method of Ingesting the Flying Root and Vermilion Essence Golden Elixir

Each day at the hour of solar culmination, face the sun with eyes slightly opened. Knock the teeth nine times, silently invoke the names of the solar soul and the characters of the Five Emperors within the sun. With hands clasped, call forth the solar soul.

The Five Emperors sit according to the five directions, with the sun at their center. The solar soul is the essence of the sun, the vermilion *qi* within it. The Most August True Lord, named General, styled Gaoqian, must not be casually invoked—know him through visualization.

**Zhujing** – Solar Soul
*Illuminating Radiance* (Green Emperor): Yuanchangwu, styled Zhaotao, appears as an infant clad in azure jade brocade, with a verdant floral flying feather skirt and a kingfisher-feathered dawn crown. He rides the sunlight to stand at one’s left.

*Vermilion Glow* (Red Emperor): Danlingzhi, styled Lü Hongying, appears as an infant clad in crimson jade brocade, with a white feathered floral flying skirt and a cinnabar dawn crown. He emerges from the sun’s rays to stand at one’s right.

*Returning Radiance* (White Emperor): Haoyujiang, styled Huijin Xia, appears as an infant clad in white jade brocade, with a white feathered floral flying skirt and a luminous dawn crown. He arrives from the sun’s light to stand before one.

**Chitong** – Lunar Soul
*Mysterious Flame* (Black Emperor): Chengqinting, styled Xuan Lüyan, appears as an infant clad in black jade brocade, with a black feathered floral flying skirt and a dark mountain dawn crown. He comes from the sun’s light to stand above one’s left hand.

*Symbolic Brilliance* (Yellow Emperor): Shouyifu, styled Yihui, appears as before, clad in yellow jade brocade, with a yellow feathered floral flying skirt and a mulberry dawn crown. He arrives from the sun’s light to stand above one’s right hand.

Once the invocations are complete, close the eyes and gaze upon the sunlight. Clench the fists and lower the hands, visualizing the five-colored floating mists within the sun. The radiance shimmers: azure on the left, vermilion on the right, white above, black below, and yellow at the center. Within these five hues, *qi* intermingles and reflects, all converging upon the body. From the feet to the nape, streaming mists of five colors enter the mouth. The flowing radiance, initially emanating from the sun, blends with its light to suffuse the entire body from head to foot.

Next, visualize within the radiant mist a vermilion *qi*, large as a child’s eye, suspended in clusters of dozens. Amidst the resplendent five colors, focus on forty-five of these, known as the *Flying Root Water Mother*. Silently invoke them thrice, drawing them with the five-colored *qi* into the mouth. Open the mouth and inhale, sensing the mouth fill. Facing the sun, swallow the mist forty-five times. With each inhalation of flowing mist, a *Flying Root* enters and is swallowed together.

Nine swallows enter the liver, nine the lungs, nine the heart, nine the kidneys, and nine the spleen. Visualize the entire body, inside and out, organs and navel alike, suffused with radiant light, the mist penetrating completely. After a long while, the visualization concludes.

Then swallow saliva nine times, knock the teeth nine times, and softly recite the incantation:
*"Vermilion furnace, cinnabar *qi*, the Dark Heavens nurture essence.
The firm receives the yielding, the flame’s yin blossom.
The sun’s primal radiance is called Great Clarity.
Nine yangs transform as one, the two images arise together.
Congealing soul and harmonizing spirit, the essence of the five *qi*.
At the center, the Five Emperors are born, riding light to govern form.
Gathering the flying numinous, plucking the root to attain fullness.
Within the head, the dragon harmonizes; clad in vermilion, girded in azure.
The reins of the crow flow dark, the mist illumines the *Shangqing*.
Bestowed the jade writ, the Golden Watchtower engraves the name.
Ingesting the morning’s blossom, merging with the true Dao’s numen.
Flying immortal of the *Taiwei*, ascending to the Purple Court.
Hasten, hasten, as decreed by statute and ordinance."*

After the incantation, bow twice toward the sun. On overcast days without sun, perform this in a clean space within a chamber, visualizing the practice. For those of pure cultivation and profound attainment, success comes naturally without awaiting the sun’s appearance—though practicing in its presence remains most efficacious.

**The *Taiwei* Method of Ingesting Solar *Qi* and the Luminous Numinous Talisman**
On the last day of the lunar month at dawn, face east and burn incense. Write in vermilion on azure paper, carefully inscribing the talisman’s strokes to resemble the original. The talisman’s form follows this text; others are to be modeled likewise. Face east to swallow it, thereby informing the solar soul.

No talisman should be prepared in advance; write it at the moment of ingestion. Hold the breath, grasp the talisman in the left hand, and recite the incantation:
*"The *Taiwei*’s cinnabar writ is called *Opening Clarity*.
Summon the sun’s upper soul to transform this form.
By day, adorned in solemn splendor, issuing from the profound.
The courtyard’s flying blossom-water, the sun’s root, golden essence.
Purple radiance flowing light, named the Five Numinous."*

After the incantation, roll the talisman into a pellet with the left hand and swallow it, visualizing it entering the heart.

**The *Shangqing* Method of Ingesting the Moon’s Radiance and the Stone Mirror Water Mother**
Practice this each evening at moonrise. Knock the teeth ten times and silently invoke the names of the lunar spirit and the characters of the Five Empresses within the moon. Next, visualize the Five Empresses seated in the moon according to the five colors, riding light to stand at the left, right, front, back, and above the hands.

The lunar spirit is the essence of the moon, the yellow *qi* within it. The Most August Divine Mother, named Yaodaoyou, styled Wang Huiliao, must not be casually invoked.

**Xuanxiao** – Lunar Spirit
*Fragrant Splendor* (Green Empress): Ehunzhu, styled Fenyan, appears as an infant clad in azure floral damask, with a kingfisher dragon-phoenix flying skirt and a three-cornered cloud bun atop the head, the rest of her hair cascading to her arms.

*Hidden Radiance* (Red Empress): Yiyiliao, styled Kuai Yianxu, appears as before, clad in cinnabar medicinal jade brocade, with a vermilion phoenix-net flying skirt, her hair arranged as above, standing to the right facing left.

*Mystic Orchid* (White Empress): Lingsulan, styled Yulianhua, clad in white forest four-dragon damask, with a crimson feathered luan-patterned flying skirt, her hair arranged as above.

*Knot of Gold* (Black Empress): Jieqiao, styled Chunshujin, clad in black jade nine-colored numinous brocade, with a black feathered dragon-patterned flying skirt, her hair arranged as above, standing above the right hand facing the face.

*Luminous Radiance* (Yellow Empress): Qingyingjin, styled Jiong Rong, clad in yellow-cloud mountain-patterned brocade, with a green-feathered phoenix-embroidered skirt, her hair arranged as before, standing to the left facing forward.

*White Standard* and *Moon Essence*—each name called in succession; when the invocation is complete, close the eyes, clasp the hands firmly, and let them hang at the sides. Visualize the five-colored flowing essence of the moon descending to envelop the entire body, from the feet to the crown of the head. Then, see the crystalline moonlight of five hues entering the mouth. Within the crystalline light, further visualize a yellow *qi*, vast as a child’s eye, in linked clusters of dozens. Amid the five-colored moonlight, perceive fifty luminous orbs named *Flying Cinnabar Crystals*; silently invoke them three times, and with the breath, draw them into the mouth. Facing the moon, swallow the crystals fifty times—with each inhalation, let the flowing essence and one *Flying Yellow* enter the mouth and be consumed.

Ten swallows enter the liver, ten the lungs, ten the heart, ten the kidneys, ten the spleen. Then visualize the five viscera and limbs, inside and out, suffused with clarity, merging with the flowing essence for a long while. When complete, swallow saliva ten times and click the teeth ten times.

Recite the incantation softly:
*Yellow essence, mysterious radiance,*
*Primal yin, ascending qi.*
*Dispel stagnant cold, refine the numinous, gather the stomach.*
*Empty waves, sharp brilliance,*
*Upright, cleansed, still vessel.*
*Moon crystal, night’s splendor,*
*Mysterious palace, supreme treasure.*
*Five Palace Ladies, each guard your mother’s throne.*
*Crimson heaven flies in, Infant Maiden follows.*
*Four yin, three unions, light shines in ten thousand directions.*
*Harmonize the hun, restrain the po, five wombs flow with light.*
*Ride the clouds, fly with essence, soar in emptiness to the east.*
*At the crown, bind the numinous cloud,*
*May fortune favor the wind.*
*Left, gird the tiger tally; right, wear the dragon insignia.*
*Phoenix-feather cloud mantle, jade pendants, golden earrings.*
*Soaring tree, branches entwined, named Wood King.*
*Divine canopy roots the stem—waning and waxing.*
*Bright essence responds within, mysterious water exhales fragrance.*
*Granted a jade tablet, name carved in the Cloud Chamber.*
*Ingest moon’s radiance, merge with the Perfected.*
*Ascend as an immortal to the Purple Tenuity, pay homage to the Supreme August.*
*Purple Tenuity’s Moon Radiance, Supreme Yin Mysterious Life Talisman.*

For this method, on the night of the dark moon, write the talisman in yellow on blue paper, face east, and swallow it. Address the Moon Essence, hold the breath, and grasp the talisman with the right hand.

Recite the incantation:
*Purple Tenuity’s yellow script,*
*Named Supreme Mystery.*
*Scatter moon’s radiant water,*
*Nurture the po, harmonize the hun.*
*Within the square, solemn rites,*
*Issuing from the Mysterious Pass.*
*Conceal heaven, veil the moon,*
*Five Numinous Ladies.*
*Flying light of nine paths,*
*Illuminating the Mud Pill.*
When finished, roll the talisman with the right hand and swallow it, visualizing it entering the Mud Pill.

Those who first undertake the cultivation of sun and moon ingestion must, on the night of the dark moon preceding the practice, write and swallow the talisman before proceeding. Thereafter, on the night of each dark moon, repeat the ritual. First write and ingest the sun talisman, recite the incantation, then write and ingest the moon talisman—altogether, three talismans.

**Talisman-Writing Protocol**
Every talisman contains yin and yang. The brush holds the *Gang* (Celestial Stem), the brush bears flying fire. The left hand gathers, the right hand guides; conceal the talismanic aperture. The Dipper’s stars—void and solid, inverse and direct—must all be present for the talisman to take form and gain efficacy. As the *Record of the Numinous Grotto* states: *"To write talismans without mastery is to invite ghosts’ mocking laughter. Mortals, utterly foolish, remain utterly ignorant."* Each talisman dispatched is governed by a single general.

When writing talismans for others to cure illness or sever malevolence, first prepare a cold chamber facing the Heavenly Gate. Arrange the talismans and implements in order. Then burn incense, invoke the deities, and make offerings. Once the petition is complete, begin writing. Visualize the brush as a dragon, the inkstone as a vast sea, the ink as an iron mountain, the cinnabar as a hundred medicines, the cinnabar dish as a fire pool, the paper as an iron plate. When the visualization is complete, one must also know the yin-yang days.

When writing talismans, the left hand seals the *mao* (fifth earthly branch), pass the cinnabar and brush over the incense, and recite *"Conjoined Brightness of the Heavenly Emperor"* three times. Further visualize the perfected immortals and stellar deities of the myriad heavens descending, their divine light resplendent, encircling the talismanic implements. The scribes and attendants stand in attendance on all sides.

Recite the general incantation:
*At the first gleam of the sun,*
*Yin ghosts are crushed.*
*Divine cinnabar shines bright,*
*Nine dews of the Supreme Subtlety.*
*What I now transform,*
*All evil withers.*
*Seven qi form the Dipper,*
*Three qi form the Terrace.*
*Two stars pierce the darkness,*
*The talisman speeds to its mark.*
*The brush is a divine sword,*
*The ink, halberds and spears,*
*The inkstone, a dragon pool,*
*The cinnabar, a hundred medicines.*
*Brushwork cures illness,*
*Writing seals the celestial talisman.*
*Where it arrives, all obey;*
*Ten thousand evils submit.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Emperor decrees!*

When the incantation is complete, draw three breaths of solar *qi* and infuse them into the paper, brush, cinnabar, and ink. Follow the protocol to complete the talisman.

**On the Solar Discourse**
To ingest the true *qi* of the sun, do so each day at dawn. If unable to practice daily, perform it on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, and 21st days of the lunar month. At sunrise, face east toward the sun. If an eclipse occurs, wait until it passes, then set out incense, bow twice, gaze directly at the sun, and press both hands to the heart in reverence. The sun’s rising is not always due east—face wherever it appears. Even if it stands three *zhang* high, it may still be ingested. If the sun is not visible at dawn, or if practicing in a dim chamber, the moment of sunrise is especially potent. Follow the previous method to request the *qi* and proceed accordingly.

The ingestion of solar *qi* must align with the proper direction, which shifts with the seasons, for the Way of Heaven revolves leftward—no exceptions. For example, in the first month, it resides in *zi*; in the second, *hai*; in the third, *xu*; the rest follow accordingly.

When drawing the *qi*, visualize the Seven Stars of the Dipper askew, reaching the seventh star, then silently recite the Six Jia of the Four Seasons.

Upon completing the incantation, visualize a single step of the *Ding Gang*, facing the direction of the sun, ensuring the *Ding Gang* remains aligned with the first star. With the left hand forming the Solar Lord’s mudra, recite the Solar Lord’s incantation seven times. Envision a golden world wherein a crimson *qi* appears, resplendent as fire. It resembles a golden basin, its five-colored radiance descending into the nose. Draw it in, swallow, and click the teeth nine times. Silently recite the Solar incantation seven times, then inhale through the left nostril, guiding the *qi* downward. Imagine the solar *qi* descending directly from the *Chonglou* to the *Weilu* cavity, ascending along the spine to the brain’s *Niwan* Palace, then flowing downward through the five viscera and six bowels, suffusing the four limbs entirely. Sense the five-colored brilliance emanating from every pore and orifice. Next, visualize it settling in the lower *Dantian*, motionless as a luminous pellet. Slowly exhale the turbid *qi*; once the breath steadies, inhale and swallow as before. Repeat this three times, then bow three times to the sun. For further details, consult the general treatise.

**On the Lunar *Qi***
When ingesting the true *qi* of the moon, choose a clear evening when the sky is limpid. Begin after the third day of the lunar month, or during the waning phase once the moon’s brightness wanes. If not practiced regularly, perform on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, or 24th day. Alternatively, await the moon’s first appearance at dusk or nightfall. For the 2nd or 3rd day, use the sun’s initial degree. On the last day of the lunar month or the new moon, take the *qi* at sunset. If a lunar eclipse occurs, wait until it passes. Face the moon, set out incense, and burn it while gazing directly at the moon, pressing both hands to the heart in reverence. Even if the moon stands three or four *zhang* high, it may still be ingested—follow the illustrated method precisely.

For example, begin counting from *you*: *you* (1), *shen* (2), *wei* (3), *wu* (2), *si* (3), *chen* (2), *mao* (3), *yin* (2), *chou* (3), *zi* (2), *hai* (3), *xu* (2). After two days, return to *you*. Then, add *you* to the day’s branch to determine the moon’s position at the chosen time. For instance, on the 3rd day at the *zi* hour: starting from the 1st day (*you* 3), the moon is in *shen*. At the *zi* hour, add *you* to *shen*, counting forward: *xu* (in *you*), *hai* (in *xu*), *zi* (in *hai*), so the moon resides in *hai*. Face the moon’s rising direction, form the Lunar Lord’s mudra, and visualize a silver world wherein a white *qi* appears, lustrous as warm jade. It resembles a silver platter, its radiance streaming directly into the nostrils. Upon reciting the Lunar Lord’s incantation, inhale through the right nostril as before, guiding the *qi* downward to the *Dantian*. Exhale the turbid *qi*, then bow three times with a settled mind.

**On the Celestial Stem (*Tiangang*)**
Also called the *Living Luminaries of Heaven* or the *Secret Art of Entering the Dipper*.
In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor resided within Yuecheng when a Perfected Lord descended from the void, manifesting in his true form—nine *chi* tall, crowned with a starry diadem, and girded with a sword. He addressed the Yellow Emperor: “I bestow upon you the method of the *Living Luminaries of Heaven*, through which you shall achieve great victory.” Having spoken, he vanished. The Yellow Emperor later employed this method, slaying Chiyou and decisively defeating the Qiangrong tribes—its efficacy defies description. The Emperor then enshrined the divine talismans in the Hall of Spirits at Huayang Palace, concealing them within the Tai’ping Observatory. The *Qi*-Emperor Immortals preserved and transmitted them to the present age.

During the Later Han, Jiang Anguo frequently used this talisman to vanquish treachery and evil. When enemy forces besieged a city, the sight of the Seven Stars ascending the emperor’s throne would cause weapons to retreat of their own accord. Later, in the Tang dynasty, General Li Jing of Luoyang encountered a divine being who, at midnight during the *zi* hour, transmitted this method, naming it the *Wondrous Art of the Living Luminaries of Heaven*. The *Six Ren*, *Dun Jia*, *Three Transmissions*, *Four Lessons*, and *Three Marvels* all derive from this source—truly the subtlety of the authentic scriptures.

Moreover, the ancients who mastered this method achieved swift responses, as is known. For those today who seek its wonders, a single phrase suffices: it is none other than the *orthodox qi* of the *Great Sage of the Celestial Stem*.

What is the *Tiangang*? It is the *Breaking Army* star of the Northern Dipper—the *orthodox qi* of great majesty and virtue. In the *Great Crimson Heaven*, it hangs ten thousand *zhang* long, its threads finer than silk, flanking the sun and moon to annihilate all evil. During transformations, the sun and moon are easily discerned, but the *Tiangang* remains elusive. Gazing upward at the celestial patterns, the handle of the Dipper points to the *established* branch—before *hai*, it is called the *Tiangang*.

The transmission from master to disciple occurs monthly, with the moon regularly positioned at the *xu* hour, revealing the *Breaking Army* as the *orthodox qi* of the *Living Luminaries*. For example, if the lunar establishment is in *yin*, add *hai* to *yin*, then proceed forward: *hai* points to *yin*, *zi* to *mao*, *chou* to *chen*, *yin* to *si*, and so on. If inscribing the talisman on the 5th day of the 5th month at the *wu* hour, as the 5th month establishes *wu*, *hai* points to *wu*, making *chou* the *Ghost Gate* at the *wu* hour. The path of yin is thus illuminated—how could harm arise?

Another method: when the monthly general aligns with the correct hour at *chen*, it is the *Tiangang*, referring to the palace of the stem. For instance, if the monthly general is in *hai*, and the Dao of Heaven revolves leftward, then the 2nd month corresponds to *xu*—apply this principle accordingly. To determine the *Tiangang*’s location at the *zi* hour in the 1st month, add *hai* to *zi* and proceed rightward to *chen*, placing the *Tiangang* in *si*. This *Tiangang* palace aligns with the *Tiangang*’s established palace, both governed by the same revolving *qi*. Though their applications differ in weight, neither can be fixed without an official nor activated without *qi*. All within the great void belongs to the Three Luminaries—scholars must not remain ignorant. Yet clinging rigidly to conventions may lead one astray.

Master Liu states: In all matters of direction, it is the heart’s orientation that matters. In all matters of precepts, it is the heart’s discipline that counts. The essential subtlety lies in turning left to gather the *Taiyang* and right to gather the *Taiyin*, following the monthly establishment to firm the *Tiangang*—only through refined truth is this profound mystery attained.

Should one err while aboard a vessel, adrift where seas and rivers teem with dragons and fish, caught in swirling winds and rain, disoriented to east, west, south, or north—how then to face the *Tiangang* and draw *qi*? Without a settled heart, the method will not follow. With the heart settled, stillness radiates divine light, and swift alignment is achieved.

The left palm represents Heaven and Earth; the four fingers, twelve *wen* as palaces. Face south to determine direction, apply the seasonal and hourly formulas, and align with the *qi* of the sun. Lift the head to draw it in. One sees only the great crimson sky, where the *Tiangang* suspends fiery *qi* like threads pouring into the mouth, illuminating within and without.

If one does not know the whereabouts of father, mother, or revered teacher, how can there be leisure to discuss the four directions? Thus it is said: directions have no fixed orientation. The method must be engraved in the mind, and its practice must be thoroughly understood.

Some say: use *hai* in the first half of the month and *xu* in the second, counting forward from the monthly establishment until reaching the *wei* hour. For example, in the first half of the first month at the *wu* hour, add *hai* to *yin*, count forward to *you* to reach *wu*, and the *Tiangang* is found in *xu*. This method derives from the *Purple Microseven Luminaries Classic*, rarely known among common people. Those who do know it often rely on the *Tiangang* methods for years and months, which differ significantly, unaware of the living-luminaries formula.

The *Great Verified Efficacy Model* states: The *Tiangang* governs the masters of great methods and heads all divination arts. Those who follow it live; those who oppose it die. Yet people mistakenly apply the monthly general to *xu* or *hai*, or add the monthly general to the current hour—both are incorrect. Practitioners of all methods must recognize the true form of the *Tiangang*; only then can they visualize and invoke *qi* without error.

The *Tiangang* resembles a yin person, appearing as a Jade Maiden. Its attire and colors are detailed in the *Three Luminaries Canon*. Have you not heard the *Big Dipper Incantation*? *"Spiritual Big Dipper, the star at the handle’s tip."* And again: *"Where the Tiangang points, day and night it revolves."* Since it follows the Dipper’s handle, how can it be fixed to *xu* or *hai*? Though Heaven does not speak, it reveals its signs to humanity—yet people fail to comprehend the Dao of Heaven.

Without knowing the *Tiangang*’s position, how can one practice? Yet within a single discourse, perspectives differ. Now that these have been compiled by category, they share the same school but differ in approach. Alas, the saying of solitary study without companions, narrow and shallow in learning, is evident here. Yet within these few lines of the model, the meaning is abundantly clear—truly sufficient to guide those lost in our Dao.

When applying these methods, one should always follow the *Tiangang*. This practice can be used while staying in lodgings, traveling on roads, or sailing on boats when stepping the Dipper is impractical—simply face the *Tiangang* and proceed.

The living-luminaries method requires fixing the hour precisely and adding the earthly stem, with the monthly establishment’s spirit shifting one position at a time. The *Tiangang* completes its cycle each year. If practice aligns with the heart and words take effect, one can topple mountains and shatter demonic temples—all within the palm’s grasp, in the space between reversal and return.

The classic states: *"Where the Tiangang points, all demons have no escape."* Practice carefully, and there will be no cause for concern. In all matters, proceed from the *Tiangang*: the three *chen* ahead are the *Luan*, the three *chen* behind are the *Yin*—all will be auspicious.

This method, if not transmitted by sages to the world, would remain unknown to later generations. Those of good fortune who receive it do so by deep karmic affinity—difficult indeed to encounter. This celestial mechanism’s subtle essence must be guarded in secret, treasured and kept with care. It is not passed from father to son, nor exchanged for a thousand gold. To leak it lightly shortens one’s lifespan and diminishes one’s fortune, bringing calamity to nine generations—wind and blade strike instantly, with no redemption for ten thousand kalpas.

Those who uphold it must be wholeheartedly sincere, without fail keeping it secret. Thus it is.

**Tiangang Healing Method**
To draw the *Tiangang*, first determine where it points for the day, month, and hour, then face it to draw it in. For example, if the *Tiangang* points to *yin*, step toward *yin* and face *shen* to receive it. When stepping the *Tiangang*, begin at *Tan* and proceed to *Po*, visualizing the star before your feet. Raise the *Tiangang*, lift your head to see it in the sky, and draw *qi* fully into your mouth. Step for a long time into the Dipper’s mouth to apply it.

When stepping the *Tiangang*, do not cross it horizontally. To do so breaks the pattern—this is strictly forbidden in the Dao. Remove your headwear, bow, and offer thanks.

Step the *Tiangang* on seven days of the month: the 1st, 5th, 9th, 15th, 20th, 25th, and 29th. For rituals, use the hour of *wu* in a secluded place for auspiciousness. Do not let others see you—if seen, celestial essence will not descend.

**Tiangang Qi Method**
With the left hand form the Dipper seal and the right hand the sword mudra. Step the Three Origins *Tiangang*.

Recite the incantation:
*"Great Sage Tiangang, Spirit Lord of the Northern Dipper, I perform the true method—bind and fetter your body. By the Emperor’s decree, the Northern Dipper lends me power. Tiangang, seize demonic qi—hasten the descent of true qi! Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!"*

Another incantation:
*"Qian, origin; Kun, balance; Zhen, harmony; Li, steadfastness. Sun and moon aid my forces. Spirit qi enters the five viscera; the six bowels attain peace. By the Jade Emperor’s decree, the Great Sage Tiangang’s decree, the Four Sage Lords—silently recite and unite with the Bright Heavenly Emperor’s Jade Emperor Great Sage Decree to command!"*

**Tiangang Direction Method**
For the current month and the hour of drawing *qi*, count forward to find the *chen*’s position—this is where the *Tiangang* points. To draw *Tiangang qi*, face the direction it points, visualize the Great Sage *Tiangang* before you, dishevel your hair, bare your feet, wear plain silk robes, and stand a hundred *zhang* tall.

Stand with the left hand akimbo and the right hand wielding a sword, pointing forward to emit azure-white *qi*, within which a thread-like fiery red *qi* resides. Next, visualize *Tiangang*—his face crimson. Turn to regard your own body, then draw *qi*, first reciting the incantation. Absorb while turning left and tilting the back upward.

**Lively Luminaries Song**
Month by month, ever at *you*,
Heaven’s skew shines on the rear palace.
Month by month, ever at *hai*,
The front palace faces its opposite.
Month by month, ever at *xu*,
*He Kui* meets you head-on.
At the third hour, stride straight within,
Back to water, face *Tiangang*.

**Master Tian Shi’s Song of Guidance for the Perplexed**
When *Tiangang* stands in the west, face east,
*Dui* draws *Tiangang qi*—once done, it is the same.
First inhale: *Tiangang* like clouds and rain,
Second inhale: *Tiangang* crimson as ten thousand *zhang*.
Exhale onto the brush, then draw it into the heart,
Command spirits and dispatch generals—here are heroes!
If you master the *Tiangang* method,
Curing illness and expelling evil brings instant success.

**Rules for Activation**
*Tiangang* at *zi* when *yin* or *shen* govern,
*Tiangang* at *yin* when *mao* or *you* are pinched.
*Chen* and *xu* ride the dragon’s head,
*Si* and *hai* attend the horse’s palace.
*Wu* and *zi* occupy the monkey’s station,
*Chou* and *wei* take turns at the dog’s palace.

**Lively Luminaries: Monthly *Tiangang* and *Qi* Timing Formula**
In the first month, *Tiangang* aligns with *yin*,
All positions reveal their original cyclical signs.
If month by month it ever aligns with *xu*,
You will always encounter *Po Jun*.

**Selecting *Tiangang* on the Fifth Day at *Chen* Hour**
At the Vernal Equinox, the second month is the norm,
Two solstices shift thrice, four full moons mark the edge.
Three, six, and seven align with the two solstices,
At the Autumnal Equinox and Minor Snow, six directions converge.
One day before Rain Water and Great Cold,
Eight mornings after Frost Descent—no deviation.
**Rain Water**: The first day at *hai* hour exchanges *Deng Ming*.
**Vernal Equinox**: The second day at *xu* hour exchanges *He Kui*.
**Grain Rain**: The third day at *you* hour exchanges *Cong Kui*.
**Lesser Fullness**: The fifth day at *chen* hour exchanges *Chuan Song*.
**Summer Solstice**: The fourth day at *wei* hour exchanges *Xiao Ji*.
**Great Heat**: The fourth day at *wu* hour exchanges *Sheng Xian*.
**End of Heat**: The fourth day at *si* hour exchanges *Tai Yi*.
**Autumnal Equinox**: The sixth day at *chen* hour exchanges *Tiangang*.
**Frost Descent**: The eighth day at *mao* hour exchanges *Tai Chong*.
**Minor Snow**: The sixth day at *hai* hour exchanges *Gong Cao*.
**Winter Solstice**: The fourth day at *chou* hour exchanges *Da Ji*.
**Great Cold**: The first day at *zi* hour exchanges *Shen Hou*.

**Comprehensive Discussion on the Three Celestial Lights**
When capturing the radiance of the Three Lights to empower talismans, they are the Great Sun, Great Moon, and *Tiangang*. The Great Sun traverses one degree every twelve hours, covering two palaces in five days. Most methods for drawing the *qi* of the sun and moon rely on this principle. For instance, when the sun and moon pass through *Xu* and *Wei*, gaze toward the *Zi* palace in Aquarius to draw *qi*. When they pass through *Xing* and *Zhang*, gaze toward the *Wu* palace in Leo to draw *qi*. Yet they fail to recognize that other directions exist, for the heavens’ movement never ceases. Moreover, the sky spans 365 degrees—half above the earth, half below—through which the sun and moon traverse their lodges. Though their paths follow degrees of longitude and latitude, who discerns the separation of the ecliptic and equatorial planes, or distinguishes the north-south circuit? As for drawing *Tiangang qi*, how can *Tiangang* at *xu* suffice? *Tiangang* follows the hour to determine the cyclical sign; by adding the monthly general to the hour, one deduces *Tiangang*’s establishment and draws *qi* toward it—this is deemed the height of subtlety. Yet if one must split a candle in two to face the void and inhale, is this truly effective? Only the sixteen-word incantation of the Great Sun and the twenty-four-word incantation of the Great Moon are supremely efficacious—these must never be lightly disclosed. Furthermore, the seven-character incantation *"Zhuan Luo Kui Chi Chi Chi Chi Liang Piao"* can summon *Tiangang qi*, drawing its kind from the Great Void, much like using a burning mirror to capture water and fire. One who masters this Dao sits amidst ascending mist, enveloped in luminous clouds—what need is there for calculations or meditative visualizations beyond established methods?

Alas! The mysteries of the Three Lights remain imperfectly grasped.

It is said: The Three Lights Talisman is the foremost of ingested talismans. It can expel all perverse *qi*, *gu* *qi*, and oppressive *qi*; cure all demonic illnesses, break poisonous afflictions, sever ghostly fetuses, end corpse-induced consumption, and eradicate epidemics. For unbearable pains and the eighteen strange maladies, or accidental ingestion of poison or *gu* toxins, this talisman brings immediate relief with a single breath.

Yet later scholars know only the talisman’s name, unaware of:
1. The true names of the Three Lights,
2. The identity of *Tiangang*,
3. The incomplete or erroneous recitation of the *Tiangang* incantation,
4. The method of "adding and aligning,"
5. The descent of *qi*,
6. The transmission of the Three Talismans,
7. The immediate efficacy of the Three Lights,
8. The secret techniques of talisman stabilization,
9. The proper timing for inscribing talismans.

These nine points of ignorance render the Three Lights Talisman ineffective.

It is said: To practice the Three Lights method, one must receive the Three Lights Register as a duty—only then will ghosts and spirits submit in reverence. If the method contradicts the register, local earth gods and temple spirits will mock you, and your practice will yield no results.

**Absorbing the Three Qi**
When ingesting the Three Qi each day, sit calmly before drawing *qi*, free from distracting thoughts. Alternatively, at midnight, don plain robes, sit in stillness, clench your fists, concentrate your spirit, knock your teeth, and swallow saliva three times. After a moment, visualize the Great Sun’s *qi* in your liver like the sun, the Great Moon’s *qi* in your lungs like the moon, and *Tiangang qi* in your heart like a tangerine-sized pellet. All emerge into the Yellow Court Palace, merging into one, then descend into the *Dantian*. Envision it entering the lower pass, ascending the double passes of the spine, passing through the middle pass, and striking the *Niwan* Palace. From the Bright Hall, it enters the Jade Pond; press your tongue against the upper palate, receive the true *qi*, swallow it, and store it in the *Dantian*—its form like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine. In all activities—walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—constantly focus on the true *qi* in your *Dantian*, radiant and resplendent. Upon completing the visualization, knock your teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and rub your hands together eighty-one times, alternating left and right. Then rest.

When conducting *qi*-absorption, do so at three times—dawn, noon, and dusk—or simply at dawn and dusk once each, performing the practice equally by day and night. Upon completion, seal the Seven Gates. The Seven Gates refer to the mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. The sealing method: clasp the *Tianding* seal with both hands, first using the left hand to seal the mouth, nose, and eyes, then each hand to seal the left and right ears. Then rotate the body and assume the Dipper mudra.

The sun, moon, and stars are the Three Celestial Wonders; in humans, they correspond to spirit, *qi*, and essence. Absorb the Three Celestial Wonders to augment the Three Wonders within the body. After absorbing *qi*, keep the mouth closed, allowing the breath in the nose to flow gently and subtly, so faint it does not stir a single hair. Envision the Three Lights as a pellet, round like a pellet, residing in the lower *Dantian*. Avoid the Five Pungent Foods, the Three Taboo Meats, and all impure substances of blood; refrain from sexual activity. Those who do not violate these precepts attain the state of Earthly Immortality. By inscribing talismans and consecrating water, one may subdue ghosts, command spirits, vanquish myriad evils, shatter their eyes, and break their gallbladders, so they dare not approach. This *qi* is the origin of all methods. After nine years of practice, one may sit in a chamber at night without lamplight yet perceive radiant clarity. Those who persist throughout their lives will merge their *qi* with the Three Celestial Wonders and ascend in flight.

Moreover, it is essential to burn incense and maintain stillness with constancy. As the spirit and essence circulate internally, one should practice *daoyin*. By following this method, no illness can invade.

**Preface to the Method of Reversing the Three Fields and Returning the Golden Elixir**
This pertains to the application of the Three Lights. The lungs serve as the Florid Canopy, the throat as the Tower of Dual Pillars, the mouth as the Jade Pond, the eyebrows as the Jade Hall, the forehead as the Celestial Court, the nose as the Celestial Pillar, the crown as the Celestial Palace, and the ears as the Twin Market Gates. Kidney *qi* transmits to the liver, liver *qi* to the heart, heart *qi* to the spleen, and spleen *qi* to the lungs. The lower *Dantian* enters the upper *Dantian*, the upper *Dantian* then enters the middle *Dantian*, and the middle *Dantian* returns to the lower *Dantian*—this reversal of the Three Fields is called the Three Lights Elixir, also known as the Great Return Elixir.

**Diagram of the Five *Qi* Converging at the Origin and the Three Lights Refining the Form**
The east is blue-green, the west white, the south red, the north black—these are the spirit images.

**Diagram of the Three Lights Passing Through the Passes**
The upper pass is the Celestial Palace.

This method is also called the Fundamental Method of Water and Fire Achieving Balance. At the hours of *yin* (3–5 AM) and *mao* (5–7 AM), sit upright and recline the body. With a single thrust, penetrate the Three Passes, and listen to the breath for a long while. When you sense the ascent and descent of water and fire, perform movements to guide and direct, silently circulating heart *qi* upward.

Invoke the Method of Commanding the Celestial Pillar with this incantation:
*Reverently summon the Great Spirit of the Celestial Pillar to swiftly descend with true numinosity.
Ascend to the Golden Gate, descend to cover Kunlun.
Wielding the precious sword, search out and slay demonic essences.
March the spirits, deploy the* qi*, dispel illness, and eradicate pain.
Whether enchanting fruits or consecrating water to heal, do not lightly disclose or recklessly transmit to the unworthy.*

**Universal Application of the Three Lights Talismanic Water**
For all cases where evil spirits, demons, or malevolent forces afflict and prevent speech or consciousness:
Recite the Celestial Pillar incantation, draw *qi* from the Pillar into water, sip it, and spray it onto the face. Have the afflicted ingest the talisman along with the Three Lights Demon-Quelling Talisman, burned and dissolved in water.

For all cases of pestilence, take the Upright *Qi* daily to gradually restore tranquility.

For all cases of red eyes and impaired vision:
Assume the Mudra of the Dipper, or the Noon Seal if necessary. Next, form the Mudra of the Supreme Emperor, enter the Dipper Seal, and draw the Three Lights. Blow onto the brush, inscribe the talisman, and take *qi* to consecrate the water. Soak the talisman in water and have the afflicted wash their eyes. Then, facing due north, shout "Swift!" once, release the talisman, and recite the incantation:
*Oṃ va-□-li ya-□-ṭa, you are Li Gongzhong—why have you come to my home?*
With each recitation, shout once. Administer the water for washing, then draw the fire *qi* from the sun and exhale it onto the eyes.

For all cases of unbearable headaches:
Inscribe the Three Lights Talisman and affix it to the temples.

For all cases where malaria demons cause obstruction:
Inscribe the Three Lights Talisman on a cake and have the afflicted consume it. Recite the talismanic incantation:
*You appear as a black sorrowful ghost—I know your name. Depart swiftly a thousand leagues, and do not linger for even a moment.*
Then draw the Three Lights *qi*, spray it, and have the afflicted ingest the Three Lights Talisman.

For all cases of prolonged labor where the child has not descended, risking life:
Have the mother ingest the Three Lights Talisman. Visualize the Three Lights Great Sage standing before her, followed by the thunder, lightning, and fire chariots, demon-quelling officials, and divine soldiers overseeing the birth. Envision the talisman-bearer as a talismanic officer, holding the talisman and command to proceed. Immediately summon the thunder, lightning, fire chariot, and birth-overseeing deities to follow the talisman into the mother’s mouth, ensuring swift delivery.

For all cases where demonic entities manifest malevolence to harm the living:
Affix the Three Lights Demon-Quelling Talisman to the door. If the affliction clings to a person or livestock, consecrate water and spray it.

For all cases of long-standing sores and abscesses:
Burn the Three Lights Talisman to ash and apply it to the afflicted area. Alternatively, cover the sore with the talisman or ingest it. For unbroken sores, silently recite the Celestial Pillar incantation seven times, drawing *qi* seven times to blow onto the sore, which will naturally resolve and discharge.

For all cases of crossing rivers or seas where water spirits encircle the vessel, causing harm and refusing to depart, or making unreasonable demands that induce terror:
Draw the Upright *Qi* of the Celestial Pillar onto an iron blade, inscribe the Three Lights Talisman, and cast it into the water.

For all cases of unresolved ailments:
Ingest the Three Lights Talisman. Depending on the illness, dissolve it in decoction to expel pathogenic *qi*, or add the Demon-Quelling Talisman. Use a seven-inch peach twig from the southeast, boiled in water for ingestion. Alternatively, consecrated water or burning the talisman in a cup for consumption may also be used.

**Method for Gathering Pillar Water**
The Pillar is the innate fire within *yin*, capable of destroying all evil. To gather Pillar Water is to conceal its power and await its use.

On the Double Fifth Festival during heavy rain, place a vessel in the direction of the Celestial Canopy (*huagai*) at the following hours: *zi* (11 PM–1 AM) for the first year, *mao* (5–7 AM) for the second, *you* (5–7 PM) for the third, and *zi* again for the fifth. If no rain falls, collect well water at noon and store it—this is called Pillar Water.

Another method: On days of Heavenly Virtue or Monthly Virtue, or the *chou* day (2–4 AM) of each month, or the day of Brahmin descent, collect water from the Celestial Canopy direction during rainfall. This is called Dharma Water, to be used only after offering.

**Method for Harmonizing the Three Lights Elixir**
Take a steamed bun, remove the skin and base, leaving only the center (where nothing congregates). Divide it into two pieces: dry one piece and soak the other until soft. These represent *yin* and *yang*. Knead them together until extremely sticky. Recite the incantation any number of times, drawing *qi* to exhale onto the mixture. Visualize the left hand as the sun, the right as the moon, and the exhaled *qi* as the Pillar. Shape the dough into cakes, flipping them repeatedly while inscribing the Three Lights Talisman on top any number of times. Once complete, form pills of varying sizes, each infused with the Three Lights *qi* and a recitation of the incantation.

As the text states: *If this method is followed, merely blowing onto the steamed bun seventy times will turn it crimson like cinnabar, resistant to fading. Its efficacy is extraordinary. Form it into fine pills for ingestion—this is the Three Lights Elixir. If a talisman is cast into a well at the first watch of dawn, the well water will boil. Test it to witness its divine efficacy.*

**Visualization of the Perfected One’s Form and Attire**
When subduing sorrow or exorcising malevolent forces, first visualize a Dipper above the crown, its mouth covering the body. The Pillar extends forward, stepping upon another Dipper, with the Pillar hanging below, flanked by two additional Dippers. The elbows align with *Tanlang* (Greedy Wolf), the shoulders with *Juxu* (Giant Gate), the heart with *Lu* (Salary), the clenched hands with *Wenqu* (Literary Brilliance). The left hand descends to the right waist, the right hand to the left waist, forming *Lianzhen* (Integrity) and *Wuqu* (Military Brilliance). The feet align with *Pojun* (Breaker of Armies). The Pillar’s radiance intermingles, with the master standing amidst the firelight, crowned by a Dipper above and borne by a Dipper below.

**Flying the Dipper**
With the left hand, thrust the *zi-wu* (midnight-noon) axis to the left. With the right hand, thrust the *yin-wu* (tiger-noon) and *chou* (ox) axes to the rear, forming the left as the *yang* Dipper and the cloud of *Tanlang*. Visualize black stellar light emanating from beneath the right foot, coiling upward around the left side to crown the head, then projecting as a red stellar light.

Red light emanates from beneath the left foot, coiling upward along the right side to crown the head, then projecting from the crown. The right hand’s *zi-wu* Dipper thrusts to the left. The *yin-wu* Dipper thrusts to the right. The right forms the *yin* Dipper, from *Kui* to *Pi*. Next, the *chen-xu* Dipper caps the head, with the Three Terraces layered above.

**Three Terraces Dipper Incantation**
Upper Terrace: *Xu Jing* (Void Essence), *si* (Serpent).
Preserve my thousand-year lifespan.
Middle Terrace: *Liu Chun* (Sixfold Purity), *wu* (Horse).
Guard my bodily form.
Lower Terrace: *Qu Sheng* (Crooked Life), *wei* (Sheep).
I bow in homage to the Three Clarities.
