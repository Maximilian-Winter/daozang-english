The Most High spake:
The primordial writ of the Numinous Treasure revives the bones and raises the dead, heals illness and subdues demons, severs poisons and smites evil—all under the constant protection of the Great Marshals and the fire-hurling spirits.
The Great Spirit is the human heart; the fire-hurling spirit is the human soul.
When heart and soul part, refined into the Highest Perfected,
the Highest Perfected is achieved, emerging through the Gate of the Brain as the Mud Pill.
Within it enfolds the Perfect Truth, coalescing into the Primal Jade Script of Yuanshi.
The seal is complete, the divine writ perfected—thus is the Dao of boundless mystery and profundity.

Severing a thousand thousand heads, shearing ten thousand ten thousand forms—
demons dare not trespass; ghosts harbor no malevolence.
