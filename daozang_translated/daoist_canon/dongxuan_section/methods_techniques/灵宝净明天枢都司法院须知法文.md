**Essential Instructions for the Celestial Pivot Central Bureau**

**The Practice of the Celestial Pivot Director**

The Celestial Pivot Central Bureau is the office of the Celestial Gate Bureau, the throat and tongue of Highest Heaven, governing the seventy-three bureaus and the seven Record-Keeping Bureaus—collectively known as the seventy-four bureaus—examining and investigating the good and evil of yin and yang across the Three Realms.

All documents, scriptures, and methods are interconnected without exception, forming the essential duties of the Director and the seven Record-Keepers. Matters arise as they are known; this need not be elaborated. The key lies in vigilant safeguarding, for the celestial mechanisms must not be lightly disclosed.

If a sincere disciple subtly reveals [these matters] to guide others, it shall not be deemed a leak. But if one encounters such a person and fails to exhort them, or is questioned and does not respond, this violates the *Secret Statutes of the Green Ghosts*.

The statutes state:
*"Those who reveal [the Dao] carelessly shall receive the highest reward; those who guard it secretly shall suffer manifest punishment."*

**The Method of Nurturing Spirit for the Celestial Pivot Director**

At sunrise, face east, rise while draped in robes, and sit upright. Visualize the sun shining upon your crown, with crimson *qi* entering your chest from the top of your head. Once a month, white *qi* emerges from your chest and merges with the crimson *qi* to form the Elixir. Within the moon, it appears crimson within and yellow without, the size of a pellet. Grasp the Elixir with your left hand while forming the mudra with your right—this mudra is not transmitted. Take a drop of "snow" from the *Yongquan* point and swallow it, sensing its descent into the *Dantian*, where warmth confirms its arrival. Then, hold your breath and visualize the Queen Mother of the West. Draw water from the Silver River in a jade bowl seven inches wide and eight inches deep to wash your ears and eyes, while forming the mudra with both hands—this mudra is not transmitted. Again, hold your breath and visualize the High and Radiant Great Envoy of the Nine Provinces to your right, the Sun-Attending Primordial Lord to your left, and the Luminous King of Filial Piety of the Numinous Treasure riding clouds above. Recite an incantation over a jade basin of water with a willow branch, then drink it; its taste, like coptis, confirms its nature—this is *leiqì*. When *leiqì* connects with the heart and is ingested, you will feel a single exhalation from your mouth, transforming into soaring thunder and lightning, with mudras forming in your hands—this is not transmitted.

Upon first perceiving various dragon deities, steadfastly compose your will and treat them as familiars. Then, the Heavenly Honored Ones, parents, and officials will become as intimate as old friends, and attainment will come naturally. If, however, you react with alarm or doubt, your spirit will scatter and drift away.

**The Celestial Pivot Director’s Method of Investigation and Correction**
When encountering officials of the Yang or Yin realms who wield authority unjustly, record and memorialize their offenses at once, first binding their spirits and detaining them for their crimes before releasing them afterward. For those deserving death, the sentence must not exceed one year. If you encounter beings—human, demonic, or spectral—who harm the people of the Ten Virtues, strike them with thunder and fire. For those whose descendants are cut off and whose sacrifices are lacking, seek their transformation and verify the truth when royal law does not reach them. When encountering immortal officials or spirits who submit memorials violating celestial law, report them immediately without concealment.

**Thunder Talismans**
**Talisman for Binding Spirits**

**Jade Emperor’s Writs**
**Talisman for Summoning Spirits**
The transmission of the hour’s incantations and esoteric teachings is passed heart-to-heart; divulge them not to the unworthy, lest calamity befall nine generations of ancestors and descendants.

**Mind-Seal of the Celestial Pivot Register**
Recite the incantation in silence:
*"Celestial Pivot, Censor of Tongues and Words,
I am the foremost divine officer of the Spirit Bureau.
Absorbing the radiance of sun and moon as sustenance,
The Queen Mother bestows upon me the Silver River’s nectar.
The Illuminated King drinks from my jade cup,
And in partaking, my heart and will find peace and health.
I remind all censors and inspectors of the Celestial Court:
Heed the summons without delay.
Assist the celestial law without recklessness,
Guard the sacred texts as steadfastly as stars and frost.
Should any defy or whisper in secret,
I shall memorialize your name to the Jade Emperor."*

**Protocol for Memorializing to the Celestial Pivot Register**
The duties of the Register’s office: when merits are fulfilled, one is nominated to the Three Clarities as Left or Right Aide. This matter is urgent—select loyal, filial, and Dao-endowed individuals, and within thirty years, memorialize their names for succession. If the chosen successor is worthy, they shall receive the reward of ascension or corpse-liberation, thereby attaining celestial rank and rightful entry into the immortal lineage.
