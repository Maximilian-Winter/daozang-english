The Venerable Zhou Zhen of Lingbao Jingming Institute Submits a Request for Clarification on a Diagram

Having received the profound favor of the Six True Masters, who bestowed upon me the *Scripture of Pure Brightness*, I find its teachings replete with abstruse principles. To grasp the intent behind its expounded teachings, I humbly submit these queries, entreating detailed instruction—this would be most fortunate.

**First Inquiry:**
The Scripture states: *"Those who cultivate our Dao may be counted among the ranks of attendants."* The *Yu Chen Sanwu Feibu Pian* says: *"The method of Three and Five is but its essential outline."* Expanding upon this, the numerical record does not exceed thirty-five, as I have already inquired. Yet I remain uncertain: when pacing the Three and Five, should one trace the guiding diagram while stepping, or merely observe the earth’s form to determine the steps? Must the feet follow the steps, or should one pace through visualization of the Mysterious Net’s flowing evolution? If the Mysterious Net is visualized to the point of "flying steps," does this constitute pacing the diagram?

**Second Inquiry:**
*"Serving one’s parents with devotion invites the descent of the Heavenly Worthy’s numinous power."* In the household, one serves parents; in court, one remains loyal to the sovereign. My parents have both passed, leaving only a younger brother far away. I bear the eternal sorrow of this unending grief—how may I fulfill the practices of the Scripture and the duties of filial piety? Moreover, though I am a lone and distant subject, my loyalty burns red, yet I cannot put it into action. What is to be done?
*"To establish oneself and propagate one’s name is filial piety. To refuse sinecures and empty ranks is loyalty."* Act as circumstances permit—therein lies filial devotion and fraternal duty.

**Third Inquiry:**
*"By day, ingest the essence of the sun; by night, consume the fluid of the moon."* What is the method for absorbing the sun’s essence and harmonizing with the moon’s fluid? I humbly request instruction.
This is the *Dao of the Sun and Moon’s Lofty Ascent*.

**Fourth Inquiry:**
*"Flowing Gold Fire Bell"*—is this a talisman’s name, a deity’s name, or the name of a martial spirit? I seek clarification.
It is the name of the *Southern Dipper’s Alchemical Fire-Regulating Envoys*—the so-called *Ministerial Fire*.

**Fifth Inquiry:**
*"The Master of the Celestial Pivot is called Daoling."* What is Daoling?
*Daoling* is the honorific title of Heavenly Master Zhang, the Perfected One of Supervisory Salvation.

**Sixth Inquiry:**
*"It encompasses the earth’s configurations, all of which it governs."* What are the *earth’s configurations*? What does *encompass* mean? I humbly await detailed instruction.
The *earth’s configurations* refer to the positions of the Eight Trigrams, each with its own palace and division.

**Seventh Inquiry:**
*"The Five Peaks and Four Seas each possess their mechanisms."* What are the *mechanisms of the Five Peaks and Four Seas*? I humbly request detailed instruction.
These two passages speak of the circulation of *qi* and blood, akin to the meaning of the pericardium’s union with the *Zhang* meridian.

**Eighth Inquiry:**
The Scripture states: *"The inner and outer altars command sixteen generals..."* Each is subject to the Celestial Pivot’s regulation, stationed under the authority of the Celestial Stem. Their methods of employment involve summoning—sound follows *qi*, *qi* merges with spirit, and they naturally appear before you, ready to be commanded. How may one summon them so they arrive immediately? If they do not come when summoned, what is to be done?

The Sixteen Generals, though bearing titles such as *Examiner-Summoner*, *Ghost-Shackler*, and *Yellow-Headed*, are likely the designations of their divine offices rather than their true names. It is further said that each has a deputy general—may I inquire as to the names of these deputies? How are they to be commanded and summoned so that they must arrive? I humbly request detailed instruction.

The scriptures contain talismans for summoning the *Pure Brightness* divine generals. If one has not yet seen them, one should consult the higher texts. Once seen, they may be employed at will while seated.

**Ninth Inquiry:**
The *Immortal’s Ladder* lies within the eye, yet people remain unaware. What is the *Immortal’s Ladder within the eye*? Why is it not in the heart but in the eye? I humbly request your authoritative teaching.
The *Immortal’s Ladder* is the tongue. Though the tongue itself is invisible, speech arises from it. Its presence in the eye refers to the inner vision of the five viscera, where the tongue is perceived first.

**Tenth Inquiry:**
The Three Pure Ones of the Supreme—*Kongtong* is the esoteric name of the *Primordial Beginning*; *Red* refers to the *Dao Lord*; and *Ears* to the *Old Lord*.

**Eleventh Inquiry:**
The *Jade Emperor* and *Purple Tenuity* are *Zhiyuan* and *Zhongzhi*. Are these four characters the hidden names and appellations of the *Jade Emperor* and *Purple Tenuity*? Are they names or sobriquets? Which two characters denote rank, and which two denote position?
*Zhiyuan* is the name of the *Jade Emperor*; *Zhongzhi* is the name of *Purple Tenuity*.

**Twelfth Inquiry:**
Regarding the deities of the Northern and Southern Dippers and the Three Terraces—those recorded as *Zixin*, *Ziyin*, *Gengwu*, *Dingren*, *Zigui*—the *Doushu Secret Essentials* in the *Golden Flowing Pearl Scripture*, as compiled in the *Fangwen* collection, states: The *Perfected One of Grand Unity*, whose wife was of the Ke clan, dreamed one night of a seven-colored light and bore seven sons. Later, they entered the White Jade Grotto to cultivate the Dao and were given the names *Kexin*, *Keyin*, *Kehui*, *Kezhen*, *Kelian*, *Kewu*, and *Kegeng*. Yet the *Pure Brightness Scripture* refers to them as *Zixin*, *Ziyin*, and *Zigui*, while *Geng*, *Wu*, *Ding*, and *Ren* are not prefixed with *Zi*—might this imply that all should be connected with *Zi*? Are these indeed the deities of the Northern Dipper? I humbly request detailed instruction on whether the Northern Dipper’s deities are male or female, and what attire and colors they wear.
All are addressed with the honorific *Zi*. Their attire follows fixed conventions: when wearing unbound hair and white robes, they command the generals in martial service; when adorned in crowns and regalia, they attend the perfected; and when clad in armor, they guard the Celestial Thearch.

The two Dipper deities may appear as male or manifest in transformed forms.

First, are *Mengshu*, *Mengliang*, *Zhongbao*, *Zhongqing*, *Jiwang*, and *Jiqian* the deities of the Southern Dipper? Whether these are their names or courtesy names, I humbly seek precise instruction on their gender and attire.

These are their hidden names. The robes of the *Shangqing* tradition vary in their transformations, with no fixed gender.

Next, among the Three Terraces, *Yunyu*, *Qijing*, *Fengliang*, and *Qingqi* are the Four Saintly Divine Lords. Since the Three Terraces should have three names, why are there now four saints? Are the names of the Three Terraces omitted? As for the Four Saints, are they the Four Saints such as the *Northern Culmen*, *Tianpeng*, and *Zhenwu*? I humbly request detailed clarification.

*Yunyu* is the name of the Upper Terrace. The Four Saints refer to the four saints beginning with *Tianpeng*.

The Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang, the venerable stars of the sun and moon, are named *Yuanxiong*. Their names consist of only two characters—is the sun named *Xuan* and the moon named *Nü*? Yes.

The celestial stems of the Five Phases are known by distinct titles. The Water Star is named *Yan*, the Fire Star *Ying*, the Wood Star *Miao*, the Metal Star *Jian*, and the Earth Star *Zhen*. However, the esoteric names of the Five Star Sovereign Lords in the *Fangwen* are as follows:
- The Northern Celestial Stem Star is named *Qixuan*, styled *Jingyuan*.
- The Eastern Jupiter is named *Chenglan*, styled *Qingning*.
- The Southern Mars is named *Weiting*, styled *Sanrong*.
- The Western Venus is named *Liaoling*, styled *Zhenxun*.
- The Central Saturn is named *Zanglu*, styled *Danyan*.

Why do these differ? True names, hidden names, inner names, and Daoist titles vary; they are invoked according to their texts, and one need not doubt each discrepancy.

The Thirty-Two Heavens, from *Gonghua Yaobo* onward, consist of eight phrases totaling thirty-two characters—are these the names of the Thirty-Two Heavens? The scripture states: "These are their hidden names, recorded in the *Duren* chapter, unknown to those who transmit the *Duren*." Which lines in the scripture constitute their names? For example, *Taihuang Huangzeng Heaven* and *Yujiao Yuming*—is the upper line the name and the lower the style? Or are "Heaven" and "Emperor" separate designations?

In the *Duren Jing*, each Heavenly Emperor’s phrase may consist of five, seven, or eight characters, such as *Taishi Yulong Tengsheng Heaven*. I humbly request clear elucidation to dispel the ignorance of later learners.

The Thirty-Two Heavens bear these names. For instance, *Zhilou Ahui* is an inner name, while *Yujian Yuming* is the style.

The Twenty-Eight Constellations, from *Qingzong Liju* onward, comprise seven phrases totaling twenty-eight characters—these must be the names of the Twenty-Eight Constellations. But from which constellation does *Qingzong Liju* begin? The scripture states: "These are the scriptural stars of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, serving as the warp." Are the Five Stars the weft? The Twenty-Eight Constellations remain fixed as the warp, while the Five Stars revolve, determining fortune and misfortune—like weaving, where patterns emerge from the weft.

The Five Stars array their radiance and may manifest transformed bodies. How do they transform? Transformation means descending to the human realm, as when Venus becomes *Taibai*.

The scripture states: "The Three-Five Flying Steps are the essence of the Flowing Net," with *Tianying* and so forth constituting the Seven Transformations. It also says: "The Three-Five Flying Steps are its essential summary." Yet here it claims: "The Three-Five Flying Steps are the essence of the Flowing Net." The primordial net’s unfolding differs greatly from the Three-Five. Moreover, the *Fangwen* compilation of the *Nine Palaces Three-Five Steps* includes the Yang Dipper and Yin Dipper: stepping from *Tianying* into *Tianpeng* constitutes the Yin Dipper, while stepping from *Tianpeng* into *Tianying* constitutes the Yang Dipper—is this correct?

The incantation reads:
*"Dipper’s wondrous child, the twelve celestial stems,
Riding radiance, martial might arrays..."*
This describes stepping from *Tianying* to *Tianpeng*.

Another Dipper incantation states:
*"Sun and moon shine, Heaven and Earth pair,
The Dipper’s Dao gleams, the ghostly path decays.
I from Tianpeng enter the celestial inner,
Passing Chongfu in retreat, returning to Tianqin to face the Heart,
Meeting Zhu and Ren, proceeding to Ying’s assembly.
The human path opens, the ghostly path obstructs."*
This describes stepping from *Tianpeng* to *Tianying*, constituting the Yang Dipper.

It is also said: "The Yin Dipper is for the Summer Solstice, the Yang Dipper for the Winter Solstice." When practicing the Three-Five Flying Steps, which incantation and which Dipper should be used? Many recite the *"Dipper’s wondrous child, the twelve celestial stems"* incantation. Some say that before sleep, one steps onto the bed facing the Yin Dipper’s direction—is this stepping the Yin Dipper at night? If one steps when leaving home or traveling, is it sufficient to use the feet as the guide without a diagram? Yet it is also said there is a diagram—how is this so?

The scripture states: "The Three-Five Flying Steps." How exactly are these steps performed? I humbly request detailed instruction to correct errors and omissions, and to receive clear guidance.

*"The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three.
Beyond the Three, none can be the same."*
The Three-Five Flying Steps are the essential summary of the primordial net. The Yin and Yang incantations are used for all movements—entering, exiting, rising, and resting. The feet serve as the guide; no diagram is needed.

The scripture states: "The Three Jia and Six Ding emerge from their origin." How are the Three Jia and Six Ding employed? What does "emerge from their origin" mean? The *Three Jia Scripture* in circulation is not authentic, and its use yields no efficacy. The same applies to the Six Ding. I humbly request detailed explanation to instruct later learners.

The Three Jia and Six Ding have methods in the scriptures, and their service has long been established. Thus, if the practitioner’s intent is not diligent, the spirits will not respond—this is not the fault of the method.

The *Scripture of Pure Clarity* states: "When encountering one whose karmic conditions align, face east and burn incense to inquire of me; if I grant permission, then transmit the teachings. I shall serve as the master who delivers, while you shall serve as the master who vouches. Now, if there is one whose karmic affinity is ripe, whose eight virtues are complete, who is utterly sincere in seeking the Dao, and whose loyalty and filial piety render them worthy of transmission—when such a person faces east to burn incense and inquire of the true master, how may one discern whether permission is granted? And how shall the response manifest? I humbly request your instruction to establish a clear standard. Before daring to submit a formal petition to the ancestral master, one should first present a letter of intent along with a letter of vouching, then burn them to seek a response—either through a dream or through the Four Upright Merit-Officials, who shall convey the immortal’s decree. This is what has been observed when others have succeeded in the Way. If no such signs appear, then burn the letter of vouching, face east to burn incense, and pray for a dream revelation."

As for the daily offerings to the Lord Emperor and the various deities, should one take refuge in them? Following the usual ritual, should one make obeisance to the Lord Emperor daily, or is it unnecessary? Moreover, when deities such as the Divine Kings, Upright Talismans, and Merit-Officials are enshrined together on the same altar, should one bow only to the Lord Emperor, Divine Kings, and True Officials, while merely paying reverence with incense and obeisance to the messengers and attendants below them? I humbly request your distinction and guidance. The scriptures and methods already contain daily incense-burning rituals, as stated therein.

The method states: "The *Tuhu Jie* talisman swiftly heals acute illnesses." But how is the incantation employed to dispatch it for urgent treatment? "Flying" refers to burning it with fire. How does the talisman take flight? Which Upright Talisman should be invoked to carry it? I humbly request your detailed explanation. *Tuhu Jie* is the name of the talismanic spirit, and it is activated by fire.

May the talismans for self-deliverance, liberating one’s six relations, and healing all illnesses be carved into printing blocks? When printing, should one visualize as when inscribing talismans? For instance, the talisman for liberating the six relations and the talisman for refining the body should be ingested daily. However, if circumstances prevent daily inscription, these three talismans—used only when needed—should be written as needed rather than carved. Yet in times of calamity or pestilence, when distributing talismanic water widely, would printing be permissible for mass distribution? I humbly request your instruction on each point. Carving blocks is convenient for cultivation and qi-nourishment. For all Pure Clarity talismans, except those requiring saliva or manual tracing, printing may be used.

In the *Book of Numinous Writings*, beneath the names of dispersed talismans, it states: "Recite the incantation once or thrice." Later, it mentions only reciting the incantation for the dispersed talisman—does this refer to reciting the *Book of Numinous Writings* three times, or merely inscribing and reciting the line *Yangqi luozhi luo*? The talisman states: "Grasp the mudra and recite the incantation." I am unsure whether to recite the *Book of Numinous Writings* three times or only the single line *Yangqi luozhi luo*. Furthermore, many talismans do not specify the number of recitations, simply stating "recite the incantation and inscribe the talisman." I humbly request your instruction on each point. Recite only the single line of the dispersed talisman. For those listed beneath the talisman, this is the method. Where no recitation count is given, recite seven times. Depending on the purpose, all are burned.

Having witnessed the true master’s compassionate guidance on these matters, I am fortunate to have encountered such clarity. May this ensure the transmission of the true teachings without obscurity, so that I may instruct others without betraying the questions posed in this petition. Thus concludes the inquiry of Zhou Zhengong, Instructor of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity Abbey.
