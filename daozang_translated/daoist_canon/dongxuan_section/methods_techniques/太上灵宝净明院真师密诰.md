On the fifteenth day of the third month of the *jiyou* year, the Abbey recorded the transmission: Yesterday, by decree of the Teaching Master’s office, it was received that Yang Wen-qing, the Perfected Youth, having cured madness, epidemics, and consumptive ailments, has attained peace and become a Perfected of Spiritual Efficacy. In accordance with the true edict of the Ancestral Master, this is transmitted to later disciples: dye the undergarment deep yellow, inscribe one *Dao* on one side, face east to absorb *qi* three times, and recite the incantation:

> *"The sun rises with numinous radiance,
> The moon illumines the western realm.
> The Northern and Southern Dippers
> Govern the celestial order.
> Protect my Dharma disciple—
> All maladies vanish.
> Should demonic forces intrude,
> They shall instantly suffer calamity."*

Write the talisman in vermilion, seal at *yin*. Visualize the sun as the sun, the moon as the moon, the Dipper’s mouth aligned, the Dipper’s stem aligned. Absorb *qi*, recite the incantation, and write the talisman. Visualize oneself standing beside the Jade Emperor and the Purple Tenuity. Upon completion, seal at *yin* and recite the incantation seven times to empower the talisman. Apply two seals between the breasts, one at the collar, and seven seals on the back starting from the left, symbolizing the Dipper’s stem stars, centered on the floral character.
