**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Flying Immortals and Deliverance Methods**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Flying Immortals and Deliverance Methods*. The compiler is unknown, approximately dating to the Southern Song dynasty. It is one of the essential scriptures of the Jingming (Pure Brightness) tradition during the Song and Yuan dynasties. Falsely attributed to the Jingming Patriarch, Perfected Lord Xu Sun, as a commentary on the *Numinous Treasure Scripture of Deliverance*, it expounds upon present-day Daoist methods. The original text comprises five juan of main content, along with one juan of catalog and one juan of exegetical examples.

### **Catalog of *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Flying Immortals and Deliverance Methods***

#### **Juan 1**
**Preface to Subtleties** – Introduces the initial matters for beginners: oral instructions, methods, entry-level practices, the Ten Precepts, and three ranks of ordination.

**Chapter on Initiating the Work** – Transmits secret oral instructions, practice methods, and the text for visualization. Opens the Dragon Han kalpa, the scripture of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the transmission of the Jade Elder’s red characters, recitation of the *Azure Vault Empty Song*, and talisman-writing.

**Chapter on True Responses** – When the Dao Lord first received the method, all the Perfected gathered at this moment. Instructs disciples to visualize the text before its revelation: close the eyes, enter quiescent observation, hold the breath for a long while, and invoke the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, who expounds the scripture, abiding atop the lion.

**Chapter on the Spirit of Consciousness** – The master states: This is the spirit governing all affairs in the Numinous Treasure methods. One should daily burn incense, perform morning rites, and maintain the following ritual implements.

**Chapter on Illuminated Responses** – When the Dao Lord first received the method, these illuminated responses were used to expound the scripture. Ten recitations return to one, forming the *Universal Summons to the Ten Directions Perfected Text*. Characters of golden script and jade seal-script are inscribed within the ritual diagram. The scripture contains oral instructions, along with summoning incantations for reference.

**Chapter on the Cavern Realm** – After the Heavenly Worthy transmitted the method, transformations were observed within the disciples’ dharmic bodies. Uses incantations over millet grains for concealment, spirit visualization, and techniques to restrain hun and po souls. Additional visualization incantations are included for practical use.

**Chapter on Body Protection** – Upon disciples receiving the method and practicing the work, the master feared residual karmic obstructions, as ghosts, spirits, wicked persons, or treacherous thieves might seek to harm them. Teaches the *Three-Step Ding Trigram Method*, instructing disciples to follow this practice for self-protection, rendering all ghosts, spirits, and wicked persons unable to cause harm.

**Chapter on Transmission** – The master admonishes disciples: This method is revered and sublime, its virtue beyond measure. The words herein are the hidden rhymes of the inner names of the Heavenly Emperors of the various heavens, as well as the secret taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits—not ordinary terms of the mundane world. Practicing it with good karmic conditions, ten thousand calamities will not encroach, for it is the root of all Daoist methods.

**Chapter on Precept Procedures** – The master states: In practicing this method, one performs rituals to deliver ancestors, liberating them from the suffering of the dark night. Here, the Ten Precepts are expounded, and contracts are burned with straw effigies to summon and redeem karmic debts from eons past. This section also contains seven matters, which are elucidated in the *Clarifying Merit* section. The seven matters instruct disciples in receiving precepts, ordination, and issuing certificates.

**Chapter on Ordination Ranks** – The Dharma Master teaches disciples to traverse the passes of the various heavens, universally proclaiming texts such as the *Mandate of the Primordial Beginning to the Three Realms*. Again, the master exhorts disciples: The merit of this scripture is not small—it is the practice of superior adepts, leading to ascension. There are also three ranks of additional ordination.

**Chapter on Visualization** – Upon reaching this stage in practice, visualization incantations are employed. In daily practice, one recites only these. This chapter establishes the merit of reverent cultivation as a permanent institution.

#### **Juan 2**
**Preface to the Scripture**

**Chapter on Initiation and Transformation** – When the master sees that disciples have received transmission and practiced for three years, the sacred chart within their bodies manifests, revealing the primordial ancestral *qi* of the Origin. This gives rise to the myriad heavens, illuminating the Three Radiant Realms—this is called the Root of Heaven. Above, there is no further ancestry; only the Dao constitutes the body. Here, the methods of wearing and upholding the practice are imparted.

**Chapter on Transformative Generation** – This chapter follows the preceding one, wherein the five scriptures unfold expansively, revealing the Five Elders, the Five Emperors, the Crimson Script, and the Five Jade Sprouts of characters, displayed before all. There is the *qi* of numinous writing, which transforms into the Crimson Script. The Crimson Script then transforms into cultural artifacts. Whenever writing talismans or engaging in visualization, one recites the above text as an incantation.

**Chapter on Establishment** – Observing the ancestral *qi* generating the myriad heavens, within which lies the Jade Purity Realm, at the center—this is the Heaven within Heaven. The Three Realms are further revealed, and here, visualization is ordered as the daily practice. There are the Three Flower Detachment Talismans, inscribed within the Three Cinnabar Fields.

**Chapter on Deliverance** – The great circulation of Brahma-*qi* pervades the ten directions, revealing within it the divine powers of deliverance and immortality. The Five Emperors are also called the Five Elders. When all the sages descend in state, witnessing this vision, it is the supreme true emptiness—indestructible and imperishable, the transformed body of long-lived immortals.

**Chapter on Preserving Life** – Upon reaching this stage, one beholds the divine efficacy and the transformative manifestations of the Dharma-body. Radiance returns as the celestial chariot, and the assembled perfected ones, bearing talismans and registers, arrive before the Emperor. According to their respective functions, they rescue beings from life and death, enduring across kalpas.

**Chapter on Universal Proclamation** – Here, the Heavenly Worthy issues the true scriptures of the Three Realms, establishing covenant talismans to deliver disciples and their kalpas-spanning ancestral kin, enabling them to transcend the dark prisons. This is the Universal Proclamation Covenant for the Three Realms.

**Chapter on Mandates and Talismans** – The Heavenly Worthy issues the *Mandate of the Primordial Beginning* and golden-script talismans to transcend life and deliver the dead. Now, for the sake of disciples, to deliver their immeasurable kalpas-spanning ancestral kin, erase their evil records, and enable them to verify entry into the immortal lineage, becoming great immortals.

**Chapter on Establishing Covenants** – Within the revealed Dharma-chart, the sagely transformations of the Thirty-Two Heavens are set forth, establishing the covenant for ascending to heaven. Disciples who obtain the Dharma and practice the workings are examined daily for sagely merit. Here, the daily accumulation of evil karma and the daily dissolution of the physical body are expounded. Today, the Heavenly Worthy creates the true script of the Ascension Covenant, delivering disciples and their kalpas-spanning ancestral kin to heaven.

**Chapter on Covenant Systems** – Here, the Heavenly Worthy establishes the covenant methods, talismanic scriptures, the golden-script and jade-seal true texts of the Four Directions and Thirty-Two Heavens, along with the covenant forms. These joint covenant talismans enable transcendence beyond the dark prisons.

**Chapter on Traversing the Passes of the Heavens** – Here, the Heavenly Worthy establishes the true talismans of the various heavens, proclaiming to the heavens to sever the three evil roots. One power extends life and increases longevity; another dispels illness and removes misfortune; and another delivers ancestral kin.

**Juan 3**

**Chapter on Cosmic Transformation** – Here, the master demonstrates, universally proclaiming to the sovereigns of the boundless, commanding the center of heaven and earth. The spirits and gods of the four directions heed the mandate, carrying out the Dharma affairs.

**Chapter on Concealment and Transformation** – Within the scripture, the master expounds the *Primordial Cavern Jade Calendar*. Before heaven and earth were divided, there was originally no form or shadow; it arose only with the establishment of the great Brahma-*qi*. The *Jade Calendar* is born of the *qi* of the Northern Dipper. Now, the Dharma is transmitted to restrain and regulate it. Following the steps of the Dipper, one conceals oneself, later returning to the root—this serves as the visualization incantation for concealment. When the incantation is practiced, one naturally becomes hidden.

**Chapter on Numinous Charts** – Here, the master clarifies that within the middle section, after the primordial chaos, writing was first created. The earlier practice spoke of the transformative generation of the Crimson Script. The Crimson Script is not a text of cultivated transformation but originates from the beginning of the kalpa. Today, the Heavenly Worthy demonstrates the teaching: the Crimson Radiance unfolds the chart, as recorded in the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct*, making it the Dharma. Now, the sagely master incorporates it for application, thereby completing the Dao of flying immortals.

**Chapter on Crimson Script** – This chapter connects to the Crimson Script, the jade formulas, and the true incantations, expounding ancient texts. Later scholars found them difficult to apply. Now, the essential jade formulas are revealed, unfolding the ancient texts of the *Primordial Middle Section*. Though there are cultural artifacts of transformative generation, without methods of restraint, there are only the four directions, aligned with the Thirty-Two Heavens. The numinous script of jade characters is wondrous in its natural essence. Its *qi* emanates from the Nine Brahma Realms; its revealed jade formulas and the Eight Might Dragon Scripts wholly restrain the Nine Heavens, causing all demons to submit. Heaven establishes rites, and only then do gods and demons receive restraint within the true script and jade seals. These are compared and integrated as the Dharma.

**Chapter on Jade Formulas** – Here, the master issues the teachings of the Crimson Script’s true texts. First, one must proclaim and pacify the Five Peaks. Memorials are submitted to communicate, and those presented are deemed excellent. If done otherwise, there is no benefit. Thus, the methods for proclamation, memorials, and their application are now compiled into one chapter, enabling scholars to awaken and practice accordingly. The *Five Emperors’ Memorial Texts* follow the scripture at the front; the *Eight Might Dragon Scripts* follow at the back. The five sections are directly described below for application.

The true texts of the Five Directions’ Crimson Script have two uses, with the complete use comprising five writings. Within are secret methods for shifting applications: one proclaims to the Water Palace; one to the Earth Palace; one to the Peak Palace. The five writings are divided for use: one is offered to the sacred peaks of the mountains, inscribed on the eight solar terms, the first day of the sexagenary cycle, and one’s natal day; one is the summoning method, which, when practiced, radiantly subdues demonic spirits; one is the pacification of stellar transits to avert celestial calamities; one is the summoning of dragon heavens and water spirits to halt floods.

**Juan 4**

**Chapter on Dragon Memorials** – Here, the master transmits to the scholars of the Dao. When reciting these numinous texts as divine incantations, long cultivation of virtuous deeds with utmost sincerity ensures communion with the divine. Wherever applied, the summoning is immediately effective. Myriad transformations and wonders follow one’s will. Movement and stillness, concealment and revelation—one’s position is elevated to the Supreme Ultimate. The methods and forms are clearly set forth here.

**Chapter on the Primordial Framework** – Here, the return to the Primordial Framework is elucidated. The Primordial Framework is the essential path to ascending as an immortal, the supreme vista of the celestial steps. It clarifies for people that the Primordial Framework is none other than the primordial *qi*.

When one obtains the method and practices the work, the primordial *qi* ascends in reverse, opening and dredging the bones, vessels, sinews, and meridians throughout the body. Man is born by receiving the primordial *qi*, which forms the human frame. All above and below in the body belongs to *yin*, save only this essence, which is the *yang* essence. People fail to recognize this, so here it is clearly pointed out—transformations and divine numina—so that scholars may follow and practice accordingly.

Further contained herein is the *Cavern Chamber* method of cultivating the true. The *Numinous Sprout* chapter elucidates what precedes: when the myriad models unfold, the vermilion script of jade characters takes form, coalescing into the Five Sprouts. The transformations of the Five Sprouts—in heaven, they become the essence of the Five Thearchs; in man, they become the excellence of the Five Orbs. They govern the five *qi* at the center, thus one cultivates the *Cavern Chamber*. Practicing the *Primordial Framework* to distribute *qi* and ingesting the Five Sprouts serves as the method of refinement.

The *Eye of the Five Sprouts* method, the five-directional incantations, and the *True Writ of the Royal Directions* are here.

The *Benevolent Salvation* chapter instructs that those who receive and practice the Dao’s methods, understanding the boundless realms within the body, can deliver others. Above, the Eight Gates open, bearing the *Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel*. The sins and blessings of the human body are predetermined—prohibitions and precepts are karmic conditions of past lives. Now, all are universally received and delivered, and the body is reborn. Above the myriad heavens, each has its Gate of Life.

Within the center lies the Cavern Void, where melodies and chants resound, along with the *Numinous Scripture of the Demon Kings*. Thus, the verses of the *Numinous Scripture* are appended hereafter, for scholars to ponder their meaning and apply them accordingly.

Additionally, there are massage talismans, derived from the *Preface to the Illuminated Scripture*. This chapter is now distinguished as talismans for saving the world and arts of prohibition and control.

Herein are divided the true seal-scripts of the Three Realms:
1. In the Realm of Desire, there is the *Talisman for Severing the Hundred Evils*, the *True Script Jade Seal*, which subdues spectral beings and malevolent spirits.
2. In the Realm of Form, there are three talismanic methods:
   - One to pacify unsettled households;
   - One to resolve entangled karmic grievances;
   - One to suppress madness and demonic influences.
3. In the Formless Realm, there are two talismans:
   - One to dispel public and private calamities;
   - One as a *Talisman for Dispatching Ghosts*.

Above the Three Realms stand the Ancestral Origins. Amidst the soaring void, the chants of the Demon Kings resound. This talisman, when inscribed upon a slip and carried, traverses the passes of all heavens and may also be employed internally.

**Chapter Five: The Secret Treasury**
The Master of the Secret Treasury states: This teaches disciples that the sagely merit is no small matter—it is the celestial secret treasure. Now, the transmission of manual techniques serves as the dharma texts and incantations. The Exemplary Master clarifies two chapters herein:
- One chapter elucidates the revolutions of Heaven and Earth;
- One chapter elucidates the culmination of Heaven and Earth’s revolutions.

These two chapters comprise the hidden chants of the Celestial Emperors and the numinous Demon Kings, not ordinary words of the mundane world, hence deemed profound and difficult to fathom. As treasures of the heavens, they are secreted within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mystic Metropolis, transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas, and only to those of utmost integrity. After pledging an oath to the Ten Heavens, they may be conferred—never to be lightly transmitted.

The Master of the Inner Chant states: This elucidates the middle section of the *Numinous Writ of the Primordial Beginning*, which contains the hidden rhymes of the Thirty-Two Heavens. Herein, the efficacy of the cultivation of the perfected is revealed. There appears the *Crimson Clarity Unfolding Chart*, manifesting the uncorrupted True Void and the transformation of the body emerging from the chart. Further, the *Five Scripts Expanding the Vast* appear, all condensed from the *qi* of the Great Brahma. Employing the *Celestial Writ Jade Seal* and the *True Script Corresponding to the Body*, they align with the essentials of the Mystic Register. They deliver nine generations of karmic kin, establishing their names in the *Heaven-Ascending Charter*. Above, the four directions are divided, each with eight heavens. The main text is the *Primordial Beginning*, while the middle section instructs with hidden names. Those who inscribe the true script upon yellow silk and wear it will align their bodies with the Mystic Register, ascend to heaven with their nine generations, and attain immortality. Lesser scholars devoid of virtue must not lightly transmit this.

The Master of the Jade Characters states: Are the *Numinous Writ Jade Characters* wondrous in their natural essence? Their *qi* emanates from the Nine Brahma, their illumination revealed hereafter. Thus, their acquisition is meaningful, their transcription embodies form, and their ingestion is through the *qi* one receives. Their application lies in their significance. The *Jade Characters True Script* emerges from the *Heaven-Ascending Charter*.

The Master of the True Talismans herein presents twenty-five talismanic scripts. The Master of Ingesting Characters compiles the annual usage of character forms, directions, months, and days, urging Dao-cultivating scholars to diligently study and contemplate them, not to be treated lightly. Combined with practices of conduct, ingesting sprouts, and guarding the center, each has its appointed days—within a year, no more than a few. Though now taught in mundane script, the true celestial seal-scripts reside within the *Heaven-Ascending Charter*. One follows the principles of these characters in their application.

The Master of the Character Secrets elucidates herein the origins of character formation, all illuminated by Brahma-*qi* and adapted to their appropriate uses. Now, each is clarified in sequence, totaling two hundred fifty-six characters, derived from the middle section of the *Numinous Writ*.

The Master of Spontaneity states: The Dao’s subtlety is vast, encompassing all without omission. Whether arranged vertically, horizontally, inverted, or scattered, none fail to serve their purpose. The *Jade Characters of the Primordial Beginning’s* middle section emerge from the *qi* of the Great Brahma. Divided, they become characters; combined, they form sounds. Refined, they become talismans; condensed, they become incantations. Thus, they possess the forms of *flying seal-scripts* and *dispersed marvels*, all derived from the scriptural words to serve their salvific purpose. Now, they are compiled as methods.

The Master of Returning to the Mandate herein exhaustively reveals the profound and wondrous methods within this scripture. The preceding compilation of dharma teachings contains only the hidden languages of the heavens—boundless sounds. Though these sounds, characters, and texts exist within every person, among ten thousand, not one can comprehend them. The Sagely Master, therefore, repeatedly expounded in the north, breaking open the great Brahma’s hidden languages and boundless sounds of the heavens. Those who know these sounds and characters grasp the fundamental Dao of generating heaven, earth, humans, and all beings. Knowing the sounds, one knows the Dao. Knowing the Dao, one knows the nature and life within oneself. Knowing nature and life, one thus knows creation. Creation is fully realized in the cultivation merits of this scripture.

**Explanatory Notes**
The Master of the Spontaneous Jade Characters herein clarifies the *Ancestral Qi of Prior Heaven*. Once invested in the human body, it is called the *qi of the Great Brahma*. It teaches people through tangible forms and numbers to manifest the harmony of spontaneity, unfold its wonders, and establish wondrous methods of cultivation and action, transcending the primordial chaos and emerging beyond the expanse of the uncultivated. The sages employed texts to enact transformation, and texts were established by the sages to propagate teachings. Thus, methods emerged, named according to forms and numbers. From the *Mysterious Pass Illuminating the Three*, all are determined by shaping forms and numbers to fix the revolutions of destiny. The so-called *qi* is the complete embodiment of the Dao. As the Dao unfolds, its essence and brilliance manifest. The ancient sages taught observing celestial patterns to discern temporal changes and studying geography to understand mountain configurations. The so-called *texts* are not as they are today but originated from the creation of characters. This single statement must not be misunderstood as a commonplace discourse of the mundane world. If one comprehends this statement, they may escape birth and death, avoiding the wheel of rebirth.

Here follows the translation:

Now, the teachings and texts are divided into two matters, compiled into two chapters. This chapter elucidates the principles of writing. Writing, in all its forms, has been transmitted from antiquity to convey the sages’ intent, imparting sounds and meanings for human reflection. A single misstep in understanding leads to wandering through the cycles of rebirth. Having been born as humans, if one truly recognizes the preciousness of the body, the difficulty of the Dao, and the subtlety of writing, and comprehends them, one may be said to have returned the *qi* of the spirit to the original palace, and the true person to their former hidden state.

All who cultivate the truth and study the Dao must attend carefully to this chapter, pondering it deeply, for it contains profound wonders. Reflect upon it, reflect upon it.

The natural truth of the chapter’s master is revealed herein, clarifying the origin of written characters. Characters are formed by *qi*. Talismans are the essence of characters. Mantras are the principle of characters. Sounds are the resonance of characters. With cinnabar, one inscribes them upon paper. Talismans rely upon this to take form.

Originally, characters emerged from the great *qi* of Brahmā, possessing the transformative power of the myriad and the one. The true principle has three applications, and I shall now elucidate the three uses of the myriad and the one. The myriad and the one encompass heaven, earth, and humanity; all creatures, whether moving or still, and all things possessing form and number, do not depart from the creative transformations of the myriad and the one. These transformations have three uses. Generally speaking, they arise from the great *qi* of Brahmā, which then divides into the pure and the turbid. The pure becomes heaven, the turbid becomes earth, and the harmonious *qi* between them becomes humanity. Heaven is the first character, earth the second, and humanity, standing between them, is the third. Only thereafter does the human form take shape.

Initially, one is an ordinary person, mired in turbid *qi* and unaware that this body has been cultivated through the myriad and the one. The sacred transmissions and wondrous dharma texts fail to clarify this origin. Many who encounter this scripture do not understand its methods, for the sages’ intent lies concealed within its sounds and principles. They grope in darkness, passing their days as if in a dream. Even those who reach old age without encountering this scripture remain unable to comprehend it. The sacred transmissions only deliver those with latent good roots who are willing to believe.

As humans, we ought to understand these characters, deduce the principles, cultivate the body, and thereby fulfill our allotted lifespan—this is the proper path. Yet there are ordinary, turbid-minded people who, upon hearing Daoists speak of the Dao, laugh heartily. This is no wonder, for they were born in human form but lack the *qi* of the Dao to nourish them. Through countless kalpas, they have only accumulated the karmic conditions of beasts, which is why they laugh. Writing arises from the essence within; it does not belong to the likes of you.

Quietly observe the *Scripture of Salvation*: without writing, there is no illumination; without writing, there is no clarity; without writing, nothing is established; without writing, nothing is accomplished; without writing, none are delivered; without writing, none are born. In the *Chapter on the Birth of the Spirit in the Nine Heavens*, without this writing, the nine gates and barriers fail to generate spirit, and the embryo stagnates in death. Though the *qi* secures the root of truth, the spirit does not abide in life, the *qi* lacks fluidity, and one merely receives a single form.

Yet there are those who, willing to believe in the dharma, possess latent good roots and in this life have received pure *qi* from their parents. They cultivate good thoughts, love the Dao, revere heaven and earth, honor the divine, and diligently tend to incense and offerings, never departing from their original nature. Though obscured by the obstructions of past karmic debts and enmities, if they encounter a teacher who polishes the mirror and offers a single word of awakening, they immediately believe.

There are also those who, from childhood, observe abstinence, neither desiring marriage nor bearing children, and with a single thought devote themselves to cultivation. This is not by their own doing, for within their bodies reside the Three Origins, and in their palaces are inscribed golden names and purple characters, destined to become immortals of the Three Clarities in this life. Such individuals correspond to this text and its karmic conditions, which is why the supreme sages bequeathed these methods, transmitting hidden words, countless sounds, and characters to reveal the principles of creative transformation and the cultivation of truth.

Tracing this back, all things are molded and refined—what does not originate from the great Brahmā? From the moment humans are born, there is the Dao; where there is the Dao, there are methods. The sages established themselves here, the divine acted here, and the Dao flourished here. The divine became sagely through this, and thus the Dao and its methods were manifested to transform humanity. The Dao exists because of humanity; to illuminate the Dao, characters and texts are employed as teachings. With teachings established, the Dao becomes evident; with the Dao perfected, the teachings become divine. Without the utmost divinity and refinement, who could partake in this? Without the cultivation accumulated over countless kalpas, how could one encounter and hear of these teachings? Truly, these words are so.

The natural truth of the chapter’s master is revealed herein, expounding the principle of *ziran* (naturalness) and the attainment of truth. The term *ziran* is inexhaustible in meaning and not the common speech of worldly people. To "let it be natural" is to act accordingly. When matters are not yet ripe, one should speak of letting things take their natural course. Worldly people do not know the origin of these two characters. I shall now clarify this for your reflection.

The term *ziran* (naturalness) is but a humble name for your celestial nature. Before this illusory body existed, this name already was—hence it is called *ziran*. *Ziran* is heaven-born; as for you who are human, it is *ziran* that comes to invest itself in the womb. It is the parent of your body across kalpas, the one who inscribes your entire life—clothing and sustenance, poverty and lowliness, long life and early death, wealth and nobility, action and concealment—all arise from it. Thus, this person already possesses this master who governs, and so it is named. To "let it be natural" is to let all matters proceed by its will.

Now, in your cultivation, you seek to recognize and perceive it, for it can also birth you as an immortal. It governs the movement of yin and yang, subdues demons—all depends on this master within. All the myriad scriptures take these two characters as their foundation.

When you, in your cultivation, perceive it, it acts as *ziran* of its own accord, and in learning, you become the foremost sage. Here, the master clarifies that heaven and earth, all beings, and every formed thing are born of the Dao. The Dao’s generation is *ziran*; *ziran* brings forth completion.

As a human method, it is named the *qi* of Great Brahma. This *qi* enables movement and circulation. If one speaks only of *ziran*, the principle of movement, generation, and transformation cannot be seen. Yet the term *Great Brahma* must not be uttered lightly. In the Buddhist tradition, *Brahma* is mistakenly said to be the language of the Western barbarians—this is incorrect.

Within the human body lies the Seven-Treasure Flower Forest. The natural master, when investing itself in the womb to become human, dwells in this Seven-Treasure Forest, establishing life as an ordinary being. Thus, this principle is called the *qi* of Great Brahma, which generates the ten thousand things.

The preceding chapters first clarified the origin of written characters and the source of production. This chapter now elucidates the *qi* of Great Brahma. When cultivators attain the method, they arouse the *qi* of Great Brahma, returning to the root and restoring the origin. The *qi* of Brahma circulates throughout the body, coursing through the five viscera and six bowels, the nine orifices and four limbs, in harmony with the sun and moon’s movement in the great heavens—transforming and becoming real.

In general, the precious method of flying immortals who deliver others is none other than illuminating the function of *ziran* in attaining truth. Thus, they can transform, ascend, and become celestial immortals. Later in the scripture, the uses of transformation are fully prepared and may be observed.

Again, the master clarifies for the assembly the meaning of *ziran*. People of the world constantly utter these two characters in speech. Yet whenever they see someone affected or artful, or when a matter fails to come to fruition, they say, "It is naturally so." Uprightness becomes contrived, and *ziran* becomes crooked. If you examine this saying closely, you will realize the weight of these two characters. It is merely that an ordinary person, lacking understanding, speaks them lightly and considers it sufficient.

Interpreted by the High and Illustrious Great Envoy, Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation True Lord Xu Jingyang

**Preface to Subtleties**
That which encompasses the Dao and thereby reveals the subtle is this.
When concluded and interpreted, it is called the *Explanatory Examples*.
The so-called *Shu Wei* clarifies the examples by emulating Heaven.

**Chapter One: Initiating the Epoch**
The Dao speaks: Long ago, in the Azure Heavens of the Beginning, within the Great Floating Li Realm of the Azure Vault’s Empty Song, the Primordial Beginning received the *Limitless Upper Grade Scripture for Delivering Humanity*.

The Master says: When this Dao Lord first received the method, he used this as the incantation talisman for contemplating the Dharma.
Facing right, bow twice to the east, burn incense, press the Zi mudra, and constrict to Chen. Inscribe one talisman.
Next, recite the *Azure Vault’s Empty Song* incantation talisman. Press the Wu mudra with the left hand and chant:
*"Wondrous is the Primordial Beginning’s Dao,
The Great Brahma unfolds the true script.
Above, it opens the Dragon Han kalpa,
Radiant and resplendent, its brilliance divides.
The script of the thirty-two heavens,
Transmitted by the Five Elders in vermilion characters.
Bestowing compassion to deliver from life and death,
Billowing forth auspicious clouds.
Within lies the long-life formula,
Cultivating sprouts to refine flying immortals.
Unsealing the profound and mysterious,
I bow my head in diligent reverence.
Gazing upward, I think of the High Spirits descending,
Riding the qi to return to the Three Clarities."*

**Chapter Two: The True Response**
When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was about to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions.
As he first approached the seat, celestial perfected spirits, lofty sages, exalted worthies, and perfected ones of wondrous conduct—an innumerable host—came riding upon the void.
Flying clouds in the cinnabar firmament, jade chariots with emerald canopies, feathered canopies casting shade, flowing essence and jade radiance, five colors billowing, illuminating the great void, for seven days and seven nights.
The sun, moon, and stellar lodges of the various heavens, the jade turning mechanism and the stellar balance, all halted their wheels. Divine winds stilled, mountains and seas concealed their clouds, the heavens were free of drifting veils, and the four qi shone clearly.
The lands of the entire realm, its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees, were leveled as one, with no more high or low. The earth transformed into azure jade, uniform in color.
The assembled perfected ones attended the seat, while the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s mysterious seat floated upon five-colored lions.

The Master says: When this Dao Lord first received the method, all the perfected ones gathered.
At this time, the two scrolls of the *Ling Bao Jing Ming* scripture first appeared.
The Illuminated King, relying on them, created methods and composed scriptures, using them to purify the body.
When contemplating the Dharma text, visualize and recite *Incantation #1*.
The disciple, when contemplating the Dharma text, purifies the body.
Before opening the Dharma text, bow twice, press the upper joint of the middle finger with both hands, hold the breath for a long while, close the eyes in fixed contemplation, and recite the incantation.
Seeing all the perfected ones gathered, bow twice and release the mudra.
When contemplating the Dharma text and reciting the incantation, first say: *"I have heard that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy has arrived upon the lions."*
Then say: *"Disciple, how fortunate! Today, I vow to receive deliverance."*

**Chapter Three: The Chapter on Recognizing the Spirit**

The Patriarch, the Sun Emperor, the Filial Dao Immortal King, the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Heavenly Worthy; the Patriarch, the Moon Primordial Sovereign, the Filial Illumination King, the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Yellow Simplicity Heavenly Worthy; the Scripture Master, the Utmost Filial Reverent Immortal King; the Register Master, the Mysterious Capital Censor True Lord; the Supervising Master, the Three Heavens Upholding Teaching, Assisting Primordial Great Dharma Heavenly Master, Orthodox Unity, Penetrating Mystery, Serene Response True Lord; the Deliverance Master, the Nine Provinces All Immortals Grand Scribe, Illustrious Enlightener, Supreme Dao, Mysterious Response, Divine Merit, Wondrous Salvation True Lord; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Mysterious Center Transmission Teaching Sage Master; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Lower Teaching Immortal Realm; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Great Marshal Emperor Lord; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Great Envoy Emperor Lord; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Thirty-Six Emperor Lords; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Ten Directions Divine Kings; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Three Hundred Sixty Myriad Divine Kings; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Ten Directions Longevity Great Spirits; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Three Divisions Secret Dharma Feathered Robe Register Judges; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Embroidered Robe Jade Lads and Jade Maidens; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Attending Scripture Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Attending Scripture Five Qi Functionaries; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Circumpolar Heaven Transmitting Words, Transmitting Incense, Transmitting Texts, and Canonical Scribes; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Protecting Body, Transmitting Perfection, Guarding Perfection, and Supervising Perfection Officers; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Former and Latter Twenty-Four Historiographers; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Direct Attendants Transmitting Words Flying Dragon Riders; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Eighty-Four Thousand Numinous Officials, Camp Commanders, and Generals; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Eighty-Four Thousand Camp Officers, Armored Horses, and Cavalry; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Eighty-Four Thousand Attendants; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans Three Realms Direct Talismans; the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Flying Heaven Deliverance Humans *Tatāsūtra* Functionaries.

The Master says: These are the spirits who act in all Numinous Treasure methods. It is fitting to burn incense and pay homage to them daily.

The method of practice is as follows:
Each day at the *zi* hour, rise and burn incense. Visualize the Dharma courtyard facing west, with the Dharma master standing east. Let both hands hang down, press the *yin* position, and click the teeth thirty-six times. Release the mudra, withdraw the hands, and bow once. Visualize the sunlight, round and several *zhang* in size, shining directly upon the face. Bow twice more and click the teeth nine times.

The incantation says:
*Dao* fragrance, virtue fragrance,
Non-action pure and clear fragrance,
Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination fragrance.
I offer to the Numinous Treasure Pure Illumination Worthy,
the Six Positions’ Dharma Lords,
all Numinous Treasure Lords, Emperor Lords, Heavenly Lords, Divine Kings, and all sovereigns.
May the Dharma I practice swiftly fulfill my heart’s desire.
Above, repay the kindness of sovereign and parents;
below, relieve the suffering of all beings.
May true qi always fill my body,
commanding the myriad spirits,
all spirits submitting in reverence.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances.

After the incantation, inhale the sun’s qi and swallow it.

On the first and fifteenth of each month, at the *zi* hour, go out to the courtyard. Press the *yin* position below, click the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the boundless Flying Heaven Divine Kings of the ten directions standing in attendance at the four quarters, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior guarding the body. Release the mudra, withdraw the hands, bow three times in the heart, click the teeth three times, and then recite the incantation:

*Dao* fragrance, virtue fragrance,
Non-action pure and clear fragrance,
Numinous Treasure Illumination fragrance.
I offer to the Supreme Three Realms Worthies,
the Eight Poles’ Thearchs of the Heavens,
the Pure Illumination Numinous Treasure Upper Sages,
the Three Realms’ Five Thearchs, Great Demons,
the Seven Governors, Five Ladles’ stellar spirits,
the boundless, immeasurable ranks of Divine Kings, officials, and generals of the ten directions,
all majestic spirits.
Today, rejoicing in celebration,
I practice and recite the supreme scripture.
I only wish for the nation’s peace and stability,
the salvation of heaven and humanity,
the ascension of the nine ancestors,
the ten thousand spirits’ attendance and protection.
I bow my head in reverence to the boundless Great Dao.

Click the teeth three more times, swallow saliva twice, and bow twice more.

The Master says: Herein lies the obscurity of the *Recognizing the Spirit* chapter.
First, it recounts how those who practice the Dao and receive the Dharma are protected and guarded by the Upper Perfected. Their reverence lies in esteeming and serving them. Each day at dawn, perform the incense ritual and recitation, knowing the attire and retinue’s appearance, visualizing without fail in one’s lifetime. By serving the supreme Dao, one’s name is recorded for distant merit, and one’s name is inscribed in the Mysterious Register. Spirit clear and qi penetrating, one daily engages in true wandering. In death, one rightly enters the immortal ranks, one’s body placed beneath the thirty-six Numinous Treasure Perfected of the thirty-six positions. To be a Numinous Treasure Perfected is to attain the fruit of the Heavenly Perfected, the Great Divine, the Wondrous Practice Perfected—like the Mysterious Center Transmission Teaching Sage Master. Now, in the Pure Illumination teaching’s establishment, there are Mysterious Center Great Dharma Masters and others who descend into your body, assisting your heart and nature, enabling self-realization. Thus, opening a position for the Cavern Spirit Lower Teaching Immortal Ministers. You who deliver others, cause the Dao of loyalty and filial piety, the teachings of Li Ming, to be practiced without fail, benefiting the living and ensuring attainment of this position, allowing the grotto palace immortals to govern and oversee it.

**Chapter Four: The Chapter on Manifest Responses**

After the scripture is recited once, all the Heavenly Great Sages simultaneously praise its goodness. At that time, the deaf and mute of the entire kingdom have their ears opened and hear clearly. After the second recitation, the blind regain their sight. After the third recitation, the mute can speak. After the fourth recitation, the lame and those with chronic illnesses can all rise and walk. After the fifth recitation, those with long-standing *shan* illnesses instantly recover their form. After the sixth recitation, white hair returns to black, and fallen teeth regrow. After the seventh recitation, the old return to youth, and the young grow stronger. After the eighth recitation, pregnant women, birds, and beasts bearing young—whether born or unborn—all successfully give birth. After the ninth recitation, the earth’s treasures are revealed, and gold and jade appear in their forms.

After the tenth recitation, withered bones revive, all rising as fully formed humans. At that time, every man and woman in the kingdom, without exception, turns their heart in devotion, receives protection and deliverance, and attains longevity.

The Master said: When the Dao Lord first received this method, such manifest responses occurred. It is used as the universal summons for the true scripture of the ten directions, comprising a celestial seal-script text of one hundred fifty-two characters. For all memorials and ritual offerings, this must be employed to invoke the ten directions. The text is written in cinnabar on azure paper.

Inhale a mouthful of qi from each of the five directions, recite the Upper, Middle, and Lower Chapters of the *Numinous Scripture* once, then hold the breath. With the left hand, form the master’s mudra and trace the *mao* seal over the text. First inscribe the following: *"Your servant [Name] has heard that when the Heavenly Worthy first inscribed the scripture and recited it once through to completion, all attained longevity."* Then write: *"Today, rejoicing in the celebration of this purification rite, I pray to receive deliverance."*

When the writing is complete, face east with white cogon grass, recite the incantation, and burn it. Below the incantation is a passage from the scripture, beginning with *"The Dao declares..."* and ending with *"all arrive together."* Then bow twice and say: *"Disciple, rejoicing in the celebration of this purification rite today, humbly prays that the host of perfected beings from the ten directions and three realms descend to this altar. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!"*

One must carefully visualize the sagely perfected arriving from the void.

**Summoning Deities Incantation**

The Dao declares: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy first recited the scripture once through, the host of perfected and great deities of the boundless and immeasurable ranks from the East arrived floating through the void. When recited twice, those from the South arrived floating through the void. When recited thrice, those from the West arrived floating through the void. When recited four times, those from the North arrived floating through the void. When recited five times, those from the Northeast arrived floating through the void. When recited six times, those from the Southeast arrived floating through the void. When recited seven times, those from the Southwest arrived floating through the void. When recited eight times, those from the Northwest arrived floating through the void. When recited nine times, those from the Upper Realm arrived floating through the void. When recited ten times, those from the Lower Realm arrived floating through the void. After ten recitations were complete, the boundless perfected and great deities of the ten directions arrived together in unison.

The Master says: At the inception of the Heavenly Lord’s reception of the Dharma, all the deities of the heavens descended, and this was used as the incantation for burning the true writ.

**Chapter Five: The Permeating Realm**

In a single land, men and women turned their hearts in reverence. Those who came were as fine rain or dense mist—an immeasurable host filling half the land, causing the earth to tilt and sink unevenly, beyond all restraint. Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy suspended a precious pearl, as large as a grain of millet, in the void five *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy ascended and led the perfected and great deities, the exalted sages, the perfected of wondrous conduct, and the boundless host of the ten directions’ perfected and great deities—all entered into the pearl. The heavenly beings looked up and saw only a surging stream entering the pearl’s mouth. Once within, none knew their whereabouts. The people of the land dispersed, the earth returned to levelness, and the uneven sinking ceased. Then, within the pearl, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy completed the recitation of the scripture in full. The host of perfected beings oversaw the deliverance and transmitted it to me. At that moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. When the Dharma rites were roughly concluded, the deities of the heavens returned to their stations, vanishing in an instant without a trace.

The Master says: When the Heavenly Worthy recited the scripture, such transformations occurred, and this was used as the incantation for Dharma masters—a technique of concealment, spirit-preservation, soul-binding, and spirit-subduing through millet grains.

Take one *sheng* of millet, select a day of Heavenly Virtue or Monthly Virtue, face north, form the left hand into the Master’s mudra with the *mao* trigram, and the right hand into the Dipper mudra. First, invoke the Six Masters and Perfected Masters, as well as the Perfected Lords of the Northern Dipper. Draw seven breaths of the Northern Dipper’s purple *qi* and recite the incantation:

*"I have heard that the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in delivering boundless beings, completed the recitation of the scripture. The men and women of a land arrived, then vanished without a trace. Today, I consecrate this millet to conceal the body, preserve the spirit, bind the soul, and subdue the spirit. Let transformations be unfathomable, and deliverance boundless. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Supreme Decree!"*

Next, blow the *qi* into the millet, place it in a clean container for offerings, and each day, visualize and swallow it.

**Method of Visualization**

Each morning, enter the oratory, swallow the pure and luminous precious talisman, then take one hundred and twenty grains of millet and sit in quietude within the chamber. Visualize within the *niwan* a green *qi*, within the heart a white *qi*, and within the navel a yellow *qi*. Let the three *qi* arise together, like clouds covering the body. They transform into a great fire burning the body, rendering it transparent inside and out. After a long while, cease. Then, with the millet, inhale the green *qi* through the nose, swallowing it one hundred and twenty times before stopping. Next, swallow the millet with water.

**Chapter Six: The Protective Body**

At that time, those who encountered the scripture and its Dharma universally attained deliverance, preserving their allotted years without harm. The people of the land turned in reverence, all cultivating virtuous minds. They did not kill, did not harm, did not envy, did not covet, did not lust, did not steal, did not greed, did not desire, did not hate, did not slander. Their words were free of embellishment, their speech free of malice. They were uniformly kind and loving, transforming strangers into kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, and all rejoiced in great harmony. When the scripture first spread its teachings in a land, those who had prior sincerity, reverence, and devotion all attained deliverance from the world.

The Master says: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture to the Heavenly Lord, the heavenly beings who encountered the Dharma all generated this aspiration. This serves as the Dharma master’s protective incantation.

Each time, on the day of one’s birth or conception, step the *gang* at *yin* seven times while reciting this incantation. Then, all ghosts, spirits, deceitful persons, and treacherous thieves who seek to harm will naturally disperse. The virtuous from the ten directions will all come to revere and honor. If one wishes to meet a noble person, step the *gang* the day before and then proceed. While stepping the *gang*, visualize oneself as the Heavenly Lord, holding the Heavenly Lord’s jade seal.

**Method for Determining the Conception Day**

For example, if born in the *jiazi* month, take *yimao* as the conception month, and *wuchen* as the birth day. *Wu* aligns with *gui*, and *chen* aligns with *you*. The conception day is *guiyou*, sought within the preceding *wuchen* day—if not before, then after. Each year on this day, perform the rites without restriction.

**Names of the Southern Dipper:**
*Chī, Wǎngliǎng, Wèi, Chī, Kuí*
**Five Phases:**
Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, Earth

Above, take three steps of the *ding gang*, entering from *Kuí* to *Piāo*.

Step with the right foot from Water to Metal in the Southern Dipper, from tail to head, entering the Dipper. With the left, lift the Northern Dipper’s cover, then reverse out of the Dipper. Step the *ding gang* again, entering the Northern Dipper, repeating seven times before stopping. Visualize transforming into seven bodies, the seven bodies as one.

**Chapter Seven: Transmission of the Teachings**

The Dao speaks: What the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounds in the sutras are the hidden, resonant sounds of the inner names of the myriad celestial emperors, the secret appellations within the struggle between demons and orthodoxy, the concealed names of the hundred spirits—these are no ordinary words of the mundane world. Only the perfected *zhenren* of the highest sageliness, who have penetrated the mysteries and plumbed the subtleties, can fully grasp their import.

When recited ten times, the heavens afar chant in response, the ten thousand emperors render homage, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds, the sun and moon pause in their course, the turning jade mechanism halts, all demons bind their forms, ghostly essences vanish, the dead return to life, and white bones become human.

For the earnest scholar who recites them ten times, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic essences lose their sight, ghostly and spectral beings perish, and those on the brink of death are delivered, cut off from demise yet restored to life.

The reason for this is that the scholar’s defiled *qi* has not yet dissipated, and their body has not yet attained thorough realization. Though they may summon the might of the ten directions and have not yet mastered celestial governance, their virtue suffices to subdue and command earthly deities, to bind and restrain demonic spirits. Yet this only averts death—it does not restore life.

Should one recite this chapter lightly, misfortune shall befall the body. Yet with reverent offerings and solemn rites, one’s household shall flourish, prosperity span generations, and good karmic bonds be forged. Ten thousand calamities shall not intrude, and divine spirits shall guard the gate.

This scripture is most sacred and wondrous, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and stands as the root of all Dao. Its majestic model of virtue is beyond measure.

The Master said: This was the moment when the Dao Lord bestowed the scripture upon the Pure and Luminous Heavenly Worthy, as the Primordial Beginning spoke these words. So exalted and wondrous is it that it shall forever serve as the opening discourse for transmission.

From the Dao’s words—where the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture—through *"its virtue is beyond measure,"* it continues:

*"Now that I have granted you this secret method to deliver you, you must apply your heart with diligence and guard the precepts with care."*

**Section on Precepts and Ritual Procedures, Chapter Eight**

The Dao speaks: Should one recite this scripture ten times, all heavens shall arrive in unison. The suffering souls of countless generations of ancestors shall immediately receive deliverance, ascend to the Crimson Palace, and after nine years of transformation, be reborn as noble persons. Those who diligently study this scripture, fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, shall all attain immortality, ascend to the Golden Towers, and wander the Jade Capital in joy.

The Master said: This was when the Dao Lord bestowed the scripture upon the Pure and Luminous Heavenly Worthy, fully expounding its power to redeem and uplift ancestral spirits, liberating them from the dark night.

After the precepts were spoken, it was said: This is for disciples to burn paper effigies and contracts, thereby aiding their kin from infinite kalpas past.

From the Dao’s words—*"Should one recite this scripture"*—through *"wander the Jade Capital,"* it continues:

*"Now I grant you this secret method, that you may follow the luminous precepts and redeem your ancestors from infinite kalpas past. After receiving this method, do not covet glory or splendor, but propagate the teachings and repay the grace of the Dao Lord."*

This is for disciples to visualize and burn paper effigies, as fully recorded in the original chapter.

Those of superior learning who cultivate and recite this scripture shall immediately receive deliverance and ascend to the Southern Palace. Those in the world who recite it shall extend their years and longevity, and later attain the Way of *shijie*, their souls temporarily extinguished yet spared the underworld. They shall swiftly regain form and roam the vast heavens. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings shall receive its grace. Infinite blessings shall bestow favor upon the living and the dead.

The Master said: This was when the Dao Lord transmitted the scripture to the Pure and Luminous Heavenly Worthy, uttering the words of confirmation and recommendation. After the deliverance of the disciple’s ancestral souls, these words were reiterated to elevate the disciple’s immortal rank and issue official documents.

After the burning of the paper effigy contract, the Master sat and spoke the above text.

From *"Those of superior learning"* through *"bestow favor upon the living and the dead,"* it continues:

*"Now I grant you this secret method to transcend your primordial ancestors. Further, in accordance with the precepts, entreat the exalted sages to inscribe your name in the Mystic Register, remotely elevating your immortal rank. Guard this well, and do not neglect it."*

All documents of elevation and appointment were conferred upon the disciple, followed by the below incantation to empower the divine generals and transmission seal.

What heaven treasures is not imparted to the unworthy. Only those who offer gold and treasures, pledging their hearts in oath to heaven, may receive it. Should one lightly disclose or slight it, misfortune shall extend to nine generations, and one shall be eternally bound to serve as a ghostly official.

The Five Emperors who attend the scripture, along with twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, shall encircle and protect the sacred text, safeguarding the recipient’s body.

The Master said: This was when the Dao Lord bestowed the scripture, dispatching Jade Lads and Jade Maidens to protect and deliver the disciple, establishing this as the fixed protocol.

After the disciple’s rank was elevated, from *"What heaven treasures"* through *"safeguarding the recipient’s body,"* it continues:

*"Every immortal official must have attendants. You must cultivate discipline."*

Next, recite the incantation to empower the officials and generals:

*"By the pact of the Cavernous Spirit, the Marshal and Celestial Lord. They oversee evil and good, their scribes ever diligent. Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, guard and attend the scripture. All aides and administrators, do not violate the covenant."*

With the left hand, press the Jade Emperor’s seal upon the middle finger, projecting it into Mount Zhong of the face. Draw in *qi* and blow it upon the disciple. Then confer the talismanic script, sword, and seal, completing the transmission. Next, recite the following:

The Dao speaks: During the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past generations’ souls, delivering them to the Southern Palace. During the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to attain immortality, with all heavens inscribing one’s name on the Yellow Register and White Tablet, erasing death and granting life. During the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture to stabilize the nation’s destiny for kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, ensuring eternal peace, unbroken lineage, and perpetual rule. On the eight seasonal festivals, recite and chant this scripture to become a True Person of the Nine Palaces. On one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture to purify the soul, perpetuate the myriad *qi*, avoid suffering, and radiate light. The Three Realms shall attend, the Five Emperors shall receive, all spirits shall pay homage, one’s name shall be inscribed in heaven, and upon fulfilling merit and perfecting virtue, one shall ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Master said: After the transmission, the Dao Lord reiterated these admonitions to the Pure and Luminous Heavenly Worthy, expressing gratitude and offering earnest reminders.

The Master said: For all transmissions, perform rites according to one’s capacity, completing the three offerings and reciting the proclamations. Before the six directions, set up an incense table to the left and sit. The Dharma Master, visualizing the spirit, wears the Far-Wandering Crown, a crimson silk robe with patterns, a blue headscarf, black trousers, red shoes, and a vermilion skirt. Holding a jade tablet and bronze pendants, they embody the celestial teachings of the Cavernous Spirit. First, bow to the ancestral masters and all perfected beings, then stand to the side and expound the precepts to the disciples, who kneel in reverence. The Dharma Master first consecrates the incense, takes refuge in the Three Treasures, and prays for blessings upon the sovereign and teachers. Then, from the Dao’s words—where the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture—through *"its virtue is beyond measure,"* it continues...

I have now received this secret Dharma, and with it I shall deliver you all. You must apply yourselves with utmost sincerity and diligently uphold these preceptual regulations.

The Dharma Master then

First, it clarifies whence the primordial ancestral qi of the Yuan Shi originates—first transforming into the Jade Scriptures, then giving rise to all creation and transformation.

Second, it elucidates the nurturing of the primordial chaos and the refining of the myriad things.

Third, it expounds that the great Dharma of Lingbao naturally generates the sacred charts and books, which encompass all phenomena, serving as the pivotal mechanism of the Three Powers. These are contained within the Yellow Plain Scriptures, distilled into the thirty-five profound chapters of the *Pure Brightness*, and expounded in detail through the precious Dharma of *Flying Immortals Delivering Sentient Beings*.

Fourth, it reveals that the great Dharma of Lingbao is the ancestral teaching of the Three Caverns. The Yellow Plain Scriptures store its creative transformations, the *Pure Brightness* articulates its key principles, and the precious Dharma of *Flying Immortals Delivering Sentient Beings* thoroughly interconnects and elucidates them, unlocking the gateways of the cosmic pivot.

Fifth, it explains the corporeal Dharma of human existence, wherein the Yuan Shi establishes the sacred embryonic Dharma-body within the primordial chaos.

Sixth, it inquires: *Before the formless primordial ancestral qi took shape, to what could it be compared? Descending as qi to become substance, it generates the myriad treasures—what form does it assume in this world? Refining this qi serves as the elixir for ascending to immortality.*

Seventh, it states that those who attain this Dharma shall, at the highest level, ascend in broad daylight; at the next, achieve longevity and transcend the world; or attain the Way of liberation through the corpse. The essential practice lies in observing the mind until it becomes no-mind—this is the true mind; observing form until it becomes formless—this is the true form. When both mind and form dissolve, one naturally enters the formless, where the radiance of supreme samādhi shines forth, clearly revealing the Jade Clarity Realm—this is the method of ascending in broad daylight.

The disciples bowed again and knelt once more as the Dharma Master reiterated the preceptual admonitions:
*"Whoever recites this sutra ten times shall ascend to the Jade Capital."*
*"Having transmitted this Dharma to you, I shall now, in accordance with the luminous regulations, perform rites to deliver your departed ancestors and repay the great kindness of the Dao."*

The disciples bowed again, rose, and stood in order. The Dharma Master, following the ritual, recited the texts of the successive passes through the heavens, the Yuan Shi’s talismanic decrees, and other documents. Next, they visualized and burned the straw effigy and talismanic contract—a procedure detailed in the chapter on *Delivering the Departed*. After the burning was complete, the Dharma Master returned to his position, and the disciples bowed in gratitude and knelt once more. The Dharma Master again reiterated the precepts:
*"From the beginning student to those who ascend to the Upper Clarity, see the chapter on transmission and deliverance."*

Next, the Dharma Master and disciples together expressed gratitude to the exalted perfected ones of the jiao offering and performed the ritual to send forth the deities according to the prescribed rites.

The Master said: *"Herein are presented two sections of the ritual code to clarify the protocols for entering the Dao."*

**Section Nine: The Ranks and Offices**

The Master said: *"All who receive the precious Dharma of *Flying Immortals Delivering Sentient Beings* shall have their names inscribed in the Mysterious Register and recorded in the immortal ledgers. According to the regulations, they shall be appointed to offices, ranked by seniority, and promoted based on merit, thereby verifying their future attainment of the Dao’s fruition. Thus, the ranks and offices are established here."*

The Master said: *"Upon receiving the precious Dharma of *Flying Immortals Delivering Sentient Beings*, one’s name is secretly recorded and openly rewarded, entering an office in one of three grades: first, the Celestial Pivot Bureau; second, the Supreme Mystery Capital Bureau; and third, the Cavern Spirit Hall. Now, according to these three grades, the disciples’ merits shall be assessed, and their ranks determined by the depth of their karmic roots and the magnitude of their blessings:*
*1. Beginners in the Dao shall enter the Celestial Pivot Bureau’s official system.*
*2. Intermediate practitioners shall enter the Supreme Mystery Capital’s official system.*
*3. Advanced practitioners shall enter the Three Radiance and Cavern Spirit Halls’ celestial official system.*
*These three grades correspond to the depth of one’s Dharma reception."*

The Master said: *"Beyond these three grades of office, there are ranks. Ranks ascend from Immortal Aide to Perfected Duke, comprising eight levels. Those whose merits and powers are manifest may enter the Secret Register of Praise and Honor, which has three grades, from four characters to two."*

The Master said: *"Offices are divided into civil and martial branches. In the Celestial Pivot Bureau, they are called Civil and Martial Offices. In the Supreme Mystery Capital, they are called the Forest of Letters and the Forest of Arms. In the Cavern Spirit Hall, they are called Civil and Martial Gentlemen. Those who are illiterate, unversed in the Confucian classics, or unaware of their deeper meanings, yet aspire to the Dao, shall enter the Forest of Arms."*

The Master said: *"The Celestial Pivot serves as the regular selection, the Supreme Mystery Capital as the elite selection, and the Three Radiance Cavern Spirit Halls of the myriad heavens as the secret selection—these distinctions define the three grades. The elite selection supersedes the regular, and those who partake in the secret selection and attain the rank of Immortal Aide supersede both the elite and regular selections. The Cavern Spirit is the vital ground of the Three Caverns: one is the Cavern Spirit, one the Cavern Mystery, and one the Cavern Truth. Each has its hall, but the Cavern Mystery and Cavern Truth are inaccessible unless one holds a position among the Celestial Emperors. The Cavern Spirit, however, was honored at the time of the Crimson Clarity’s revelation of the cosmic chart—though its officials are of low rank, its terrain is strategically vital. The Three Radiance offices, though not part of the Cavern Spirit’s system, are subordinate to it. All the above is drawn from the *Essentials of the Celestial Pivot and Supreme Mystery Capital Records* and the *General Regulations and Ordinances of the Cavern Spirit Capital."*

**Section Ten: Visualization**

The Dao states: *"On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe with fragrant water, enter a purified chamber, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the thirty-two heavens. Bow thirty-two times with utmost sincerity. Close the eyes and meditate, visualizing oneself seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. A blue dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, dark warrior, lion, and white crane array themselves to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate the chamber with penetrating radiance. A circular halo emanates from the crown of the head, its light suffusing the ten directions—all must be vividly clear. Recite the incantation:*
*‘Tanluo Yuluo, Fuwu Sutuo, Taichong Taiji, yin and yang harmoniously enveloped. Emerging from existence, entering non-existence; entering life, emerging from death. Spirits and gods cannot fathom it; transformations arise naturally. The primordial qi of the Yuan Shi, the mystery within mystery, above it pierces the ultimate end, below it penetrates the great abyss.’*
*Reciting this once, chronic illnesses heal spontaneously. Refining the hun and bathing the po, the true yang is preserved whole. Through fasting, ritual, and recitation ten thousand times, one ascends as a flying immortal. This supreme secret incantation ensures an everlasting mandate.*
*Recite the heart incantation again:*
*‘Tanluo reveals the Cavern’s clarity. The Jade Clarity’s supreme extremity, the Brahma qi billows and swirls. Distributing the numinous and deploying the qi, they descend and infuse the body. Form and spirit both wondrous, one merges with the Dao in truth.’"*

"Having attained the Dao in this body, seven generations of ancestors ascend as immortals, all conforming to the golden register, commanding the myriad spirits.

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes of the Yuan Shi and the Mystic Capital!*

The Supreme Mystic Prime, the Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Direct-Day Incense Officials—thirty-two of each—opening and declaring thus: Today is an auspicious and joyous occasion, a day of prolonged fasting in the pure hall. Through cultivation of the scriptures, boundless beings are delivered; through recitation of the sutras, rebirth is attained. May this petition ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Thirty-Two Heavens, before the august throne of the Yuan Shi Supreme Thearch.

Draw in the qi thirty-two times, facing east."

The Master said: "This is the method of scripture recitation and visualization for the Perfected of the Numinous Treasure. In all practice, one need only recite the fundamental chapter on delivering beings to accumulate merit and virtue—this shall be the permanent rule."

*Thus concludes the first scroll of* The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Pure Clarity, Flying Immortality, and Deliverance.

[Note: The following incantation is missing from the original text.]

[Note: Two characters are missing here; supplied in accordance with preceding and following textual conventions.]

*The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Pure Clarity, Flying Immortality, and Deliverance, Scroll Two*

*Explained by the High and Illustrious Great Envoy, the Perfected Lord of Wondrous Salvation and Divine Merit, Xu Jingyang*

The Dao and its scriptures follow eternal principles, enabling later adepts to observe and elucidate their patterns through explication. The *Explication of Patterns* in two scrolls corresponds to Earth, comprising thirty-two chapters to complete the thirty-two heavens. The *Preface to the Scripture* in four scrolls corresponds to the four seasons.

**Chapter One: The Chapter of Transformation and Generation**
The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery, the fundamental chapter of the Numinous Treasure, the supreme and wondrous inception, delivers beings ten times over. Its hundred demonic hidden rhymes merge and part naturally; its chaotic crimson script embodies the Utmost True of Non-Being. The Primordial Ancestral Qi transforms and gives birth to the myriad heavens, unfolding the Three Luminaries—this is the root of Heaven. Above, there is no further origin; only the Dao constitutes its body.

The Immortal Master says: This is the middle section of the fundamental chapter spoken by the Primordial Beginning. Prior to the existence of the Ancestral Qi, this Qi already existed, congealing into script. Thus arose the Crimson Writ, the two sections of numinous talismans, and the *Precious Chart of Pure Clarity*, which form the root of transformation and generation. Now, inscribe the middle section of the Primordial Beginning’s Numinous Writ, wear it, and practice it to save others and cure illnesses. Before reciting the Cavernous Chapter and visualizing the deities, first silently recite the above passage in full, then continue: *"Today, I joyfully enter this assembly to inscribe these jade characters. Humbly, I pray for the Heavenly Grace to open the path of deliverance."* Bow in reverence, then visualize as prescribed. The ritual procedures are fully recorded in the fundamental chapter.

**Chapter Two: The Chapter of Transformative Generation**
The Five Scripts unfold and expand, universally planting the divine spirits. Without script, there is no radiance; without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no deliverance; without script, there is no generation. This is the Great Brahmā.

The Master says: This explains the scriptural preface, wherein the Qi of the middle section and the two sections of numinous talismans transform into the Crimson Writ, and the Qi of the Crimson Writ transforms into cultural artifacts. Now, inscribe the Five Elders’ Crimson Writ and the Five Sprouts’ Jade Characters. Before summoning the deities and visualizing, first recite the above passage, then continue: *"Today, I enter this joyous assembly. Humbly, I pray for the Heavenly Grace to open the path of deliverance."*

**Chapter Three: The Chapter of Establishment**
Within Heaven is Heaven: the Verdant Canopy and Jasper Terrace, the Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital, the utmost of the supreme, the Great Luo’s Jade Clarity. Vast and boundless through kalpas, it seems absent yet present. The Three Flowers part and depart; the wondrous court of the Great Existence, the golden towers and jade chambers, arrayed in pure clarity.

The Master says: This explains how the Qi of the Jade Characters generates the myriad heavens. The realm of Jade Clarity resides at the center, forming the Heaven within Heaven. The Verdant Canopy and Jasper Terrace are the Heavenly Treasures of Jade Clarity, further encompassing the Numinous Treasure and Divine Treasure, the Qi of the Three Venerable Ones, suspended in emptiness—unseen yet audible, seeming absent yet present. The Three Flowers are the Qi divided into three. The golden towers, jade chambers, and arrayed pure clarity are the transformations of Qi into form. Now, humans, having received the Great Brahmā’s Ancestral Qi, possess their bodies and should unite with Heaven and Earth. Thus, the above passage serves as the method for visualizing the Three Qi.

The Master says: Those who practice the Dao of Flying Immortality and Deliverance should, on the night of their life-destiny’s Greater Year-Star, at the seventh mark after the hour of *hai* when the water clock drips, enter the chamber to pay homage to the Perfected. Bow twice, sit in stillness, and visualize a pool below their cinnabar field, its shores inlaid with gold and jade, surmounted by golden towers and jade chambers in three tiers. The Most High Lord Lao resides on the lower tier, the Most High Dao Lord on the middle tier, and the Primordial Heavenly Worthy on the upper tier. The terrace aligns directly with the crown of the head, and the Three Lords’ seats correspond to the cinnabar field, Crimson Palace, and Mud Pill Palace, with three-colored clouds and Qi radiating from the Niwan Palace. Strike the teeth nine times and recite the incantation from *"Within Heaven is Heaven"* to *"arrayed in pure clarity."* Form the *Du Jian* mudra and inscribe one talisman each of the Three Flowers:

First Talisman
Second Talisman

**Third Talisman:**
Swallow the first talisman on the right, visualizing it entering the cinnabar field, where a red qi rises to penetrate the Niwan Palace. Swallow the second talisman, visualizing it entering the cinnabar field, where a red qi rises to penetrate the Crimson Palace. Swallow the third talisman, visualizing it entering the cinnabar field, where a red qi merges with the previous two, ascending and descending in union. After nine repetitions, they form three qi—azure, yellow, and white—which surge through the crown of the head like auspicious clouds, vast as a chariot’s canopy. Then softly intone the prayer:

*Within the golden chambers dwell the Three Lords,*
*Transforming the great Brahmā to birth radiant beryl.*
*The upright qi and true essence enter the mysterious depths,*
*Congealing into a jade terrace, the body’s natural state.*
*Towering three tiers high, it pierces the void,*
*Streaming rosy clouds through the cinnabar heavens, cradling the jade field.*
*Above, it connects to the nine-layered celestial tiers;*
*Below, ten thousand fathoms of dark valley springs.*
*Uniting at the cavern’s gate to forge the numinous root,*
*The Three Flowers’ treasure radiance shines with luminous clarity.*

Upon completing the incantation, swallow nine breaths of qi to conclude.

---

**Chapter Four: The Scripture of Transcendence**
The great Brahmā qi pervades the ten directions, wherein dwell the divine beings who deliver the dead to immortality, the Southern Culmen Lord of Longevity, the Transcendence Marshal of the Celestial Bureau, the Life-Nurturing Elder Han, and the Southern Supreme Directors of Destiny and Records, the Longevity-Extending and Calamity-Averting Honored Spirits. They reverse decay and revive the dead, delivering boundless multitudes. Today, as the celestial registers are reviewed, the hosts of heaven descend in audience.

The Master says: This speaks of the primordial beginning when the Origin transformed and emanated the great Brahmā, suffusing the ten directions. The qi dispersed and light flowed forth, giving rise to the multitude of sages who save and deliver the limitless. Now, when issuing talismans and incantations for healing, memorials, deliverance, or pacification, the flying celestial divine kings are dispatched to the respective quarters.

When employing the Pure Clarity method, one must visualize the assembly of perfected beings within the Niwan Palace and the Six Masters in attendance before dispatching the generals and reciting the incantation. From *"The great Brahmā qi pervades"* to *"the hosts of heaven descend in audience,"* face east, form the *Mao* mudra, and draw in five breaths of the five directions’ five-colored qi. When releasing the incantation, release the mudra and exhale one breath of five-colored qi:

*Eastern Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Southern Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Western Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Northern Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Northeastern Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Southeastern Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Southwestern Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Northwestern Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Upper Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*Lower Limitless Flying Celestial Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, Deliverer of Boundless Multitudes.*
*The Ten Directions’ Perfected Flying Celestial Divine Kings, Great Spirits of Longevity and Transcendence, all ride upon flying clouds in cinnabar carriages with green canopies, jade wheels, and vermilion phoenixes in harness, five-colored dark dragons in equipoise. They bear nine-colored standards and ten sacred banners. Ahead, nine phoenixes cry in unison; behind, eight simurghs sing in harmony. Lions and white cranes chant in melodious chorus. The Five Elders lead the way, while hosts of immortals flank the procession—myriads of chariots and legions of cavalry descending through the void.*

The Master says: This describes the visualization of dispatching the divine kings to act. When the Heavenly Worthy first sent the divine kings to deliver the myriad beings across kalpas of eons, their retinue was thus arrayed. Now, when the Dharma Master performs rituals, the writs are prepared as usual, clearly stating the matter at hand, and dispatched to the respective direction. For the upper realm, the writ is addressed to the heavens; for the lower realm, to the nine earths. This method is used when the four directions are not traversed.

For all dispatches and summons, inscribe the divine kings’ true seal scripts in cinnabar at the designated post, affix the seal of the Pure Clarity Dharma Master, and write the *Dhatarasuka* functionary talisman of Pure Clarity. When employed, this is also written in two columns.

---

**Chapter Five: The Preservation of Life**
The light turns back, the chariot returns, as the perfected oversee deliverance and the nurturing of life. The Celestial Chancellors, the Southern Palace of Supreme Prosperity, the Han Director of Records, and the Life-Monitoring Great Spirits hold the registers and ledgers, all assembling before the Emperor. According to what is to be delivered, they strictly review the celestial records.

The Master says: This speaks of the great divine hosts of the Numinous Treasure Dharma assembling before the Celestial Emperor to deliver the living from death. Now, it is adapted as a method for seeking descendants.

**Swallowing the Talisman:**
When writing the character for "sun," recite *Yuyi* and draw the solar qi from the left eye. When writing the character for "moon," recite *Jielin* and draw the lunar qi from the right eye. The two qi merge as per the following method.

**Wearing the Talisman:**
Write the character for "brightness." On the left, bind the sun sevenfold; on the right, restrain the moon sevenfold. Visualize the red and yellow light of the sun and moon merging into the talisman. Draw one breath of eastern qi and two breaths of western qi, then exhale while reciting the incantation and forming the mudra. For a son, move the hand from the *yin* position leftward to the *si* position. For a daughter, move the hand from the *shen* position rightward to the *si* position. Husband and wife face each other—he to the west, she to the east—swallowing one talisman daily with pure water. Within a hundred days, a child will be conceived. For swallowing, burn the talisman and dissolve it in water to drink. For wearing, use the previous incantation to consecrate it. Write the talisman in cinnabar on white silk: the man wears it on the left, the woman on the right.

---

**Chapter Six: The Universal Proclamation**
A universal proclamation is issued to the Three Realms, the Limitless Divine Lands, the Yellow Springs’ Courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources. May the ancestors of kalpas past be delivered, and the karmic kin of eons be released. May their sin registers be swiftly expunged, their evil roots eradicated. Let them not be detained or coerced into ghostly throngs.

The Master says: This speaks of the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure and the Dao Lord expounding the scriptures to transcend life and death. Now, through the true writs and numinous talismans, the disciples’ karmic kin of eons past are delivered from the dark prisons, and a universal proclamation is issued to the Three Realms.

**Universal Proclamation Talisman for the Three Realms**
On the day of the year, month, and *taisi* cycle, issued by the Grand Master of the Highest Clarity and Numinous Treasure.

When inscribing, employ the true writs and the central decree of the middle section.

**Universal Proclamation Talisman for the Three Realms**
Inscribe on paulownia wood, nine *cun* in length and three *cun* two *fen* in width, with cinnabar on a yellow ground. Affix to the bamboo slip and seal with the Seal of the Great Mystery Capital Bureau.

---

**Chapter Seven: The Primordial Talisman Decree**
The Primordial Talisman Decree governs timely ascension.
The Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool guards the forms and souls.
It subdues demons, ensures protection, and elevates ranks to the Southern Palace.
Dead souls undergo refinement, transforming into immortals.
Living beings receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas.
Through cyclic revolutions, they share the heavens’ lifespan.
Forever delivered from the Three Ways, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties,
they transcend the Three Realms, roaming freely in the Highest Clarity.

The Master says: This speaks of the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure expounding the scriptures to transcend life and death. Now, for the disciples’ karmic kin of limitless kalpas, their evil registers are expunged, and they attain entry into the immortal lineage, composing the Primordial Talisman Decree.

**Primordial Talisman Decree True Writ**

The Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Thearchs.
The hidden taboos of the heavens, the hidden names of the heavens,
the empty caverns within the heavens, the spontaneous numinous chapters.
The hidden rhymes of the heavens, the sounds within the heavens,
the revered within the heavens, the spirits within the heavens,
the great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens,
the Nine Harmonies and Ten Unions, transforming into the Highest Clarity.
The boundless mysteries, too profound to detail,
they unfold and descend as divine perfected beings, universally delivering heavenly and mortal beings.

The Master says: These are the inner taboos of the Heavenly Thearchs and Demon Kings of the Thirty-Two Heavens. Those who know their numinous sounds are protected and elevated to immortality by the Demon Kings. Thus, now for the disciples themselves and their karmic kin of kalpas past, the contract for ascension to heaven is bestowed. Begin by silently reciting from the Eight Heavens of the East to the end, then bow twice and seal with the Jade Seal of the Dao Lord.

---

**Chapter Nine: The Contract System**
For all newly initiated disciples and those performing ancestral deliverance, contracts are issued.
For men, the left contract; for women, the right contract, to be worn.
Inscribe with cinnabar on yellow silk, each nine *cun* in height and three *chi* two *cun* in length.
Each month, prepare two copies, inscribing the Ascension to Heaven Talisman and uniting them above.
Men keep the left; women keep the right.
Burn one copy, storing it beneath the Celestial Pivot Gate for correspondence, while the other is worn.
For deliverance, burn one copy for the deceased and send the other to the Celestial Pivot as a matching contract.

The method for inscribing the contract: sit at the Heavenly Gate, facing the *xun* direction, form the Highest Clarity mudra, and visualize oneself as the Dao Lord. Silently invoke the circumstances, then inscribe the central true writ according to the Demon Kings’ hymn.

**Hymn of the Demon Kings:**
Brahma-conduct crowns the Supreme Net,
pure winds uphold the mysterious record.
Formless yet eternally abiding,
contemplating the world’s reversed principles.
Treading often without kalpic end,
exploring the obscure to deliver life and death.
The Three Vehicles open the convenient path,
clarity and void without dust or dregs.
Facing the lone soul through the long night,
the Five Sufferings of hell are dissolved.
Sword trees cease their swaying branches,
blade mountains no longer harm the body.
The gate holds the Elder of Vast Kalpas,
the earth lacks children of premature death.
Today we celebrate this assembly,
all heavens rejoice together.
Overwhelmed with joyful emotion,
we raise our voices in reverent homage.

Upon reciting the hymn, inhale *qi* thirty-two times, visualize the Supreme August Yellow-Canopy Heavenly Thearch, and bow to the Heavenly Thearchs of the four directions from the northeast. They arrive with their retinues of jade lads and maidens, direct talisman officials, and attendants holding cinnabar brushes, awaiting the contract’s inscription. Together, they guarantee the deliverance of the disciple’s nine generations of ancestors and six relations, extracting them from the earthly prisons to achieve great immortality.

Proceed as prescribed to dye the cinnabar and inscribe the contract. The contract’s format includes the five talismans within and the burning of the contract, along with wearing the sun and treading the Dipper, as transmitted orally in the Pure Brightness method. East: grasp the *yin* position; south: the *si*; west: the *shen*; north: the *hai*. Once the contract text is inscribed, seal it with the Jade Seal of the Dao Lord, and recite the two *Ling Shu* chapters of the Pure Brightness to consecrate the contract.

The Most High Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Court:
Use two contracts written together with this talisman—men retain the left, women the right. The method for posthumous deliverance follows the same form.

According to the *Pure Brightness Secret Canon*, one ascends into the immortal palaces. The loyal and filial child brings blessing to their kin. Nine generations receive rank and ascend as immortals by decree. Where the numinous chapters descend, all heavens escort and welcome. Now appoint disciple [Name], to the office of [Position]. This contract must be issued as certification.

For posthumous deliverance, state: "Deliver disciple Yuan Ling, who is assigned to the Celestial Pivot Court to receive office."

The *Celestial Bird and Earthly Beast Lineage Jade Script*:
This is the middle chapter of the *Primal Beginning Numinous Writ*. The middle chapter of the *Numinous Writ* is the *Ascension to Heaven Contract*.

**Talisman of the White Emperor (You Script)**
**Talisman of the Black Emperor (Zi Script)**
**Talisman of the Yellow Emperor (Central Script)**

When inscribing the above five talismans, first visualize the Five Emperors stationed in the five directions, then recite the incantation:
*"The Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul,
The White Emperor attends the po-soul,
The Vermilion Emperor nurtures the qi,
The Black Emperor circulates the blood,
The Yellow Emperor presides at the center—
Myriad spirits shall not transgress."*

Next, inscribe the talismans while facing the respective directions and forming the hand seals. They may also be worn or ingested. When traversing the passes of the various heavens, combine this with the previously mentioned longevity practices, along with the methods of *xingshi* and divine strategy.

**Talisman of the Azure Emperor:**
Face east, knock the teeth nine times, and visualize azure qi entering through the mouth, infusing the liver, where it generates ninefold layers of luminous azure radiance, suffusing the crown of the head. Place the talisman before you and recite the incantation:
*"Supreme azure essence,
Great spirit of the nine qi,
Divine light spreads afar,
Flowing to illumine the eastern azure.
Resplendent brilliance flourishes,
Beholding my bodily form.
Palace and court are securely settled,
The precious po-soul naturally arises,
Penetrating the eight directions,
Ascending to the Jade Court."*

Conclude by drawing in qi and swallowing nine times. Ingest one and wear one. If placing it within a staff, insert one therein.

**Talisman of the Vermilion Emperor:**
Face south, knock the teeth three times, and visualize vermilion qi entering through the mouth, infusing the heart, where it generates threefold layers of cinnabar radiance, suffusing the chest. Place the talisman before you and recite the incantation:
*"Cinnabar radiance flows and illumines,
Precious zhi-herbs emit their light,
Divine essence penetrates the hidden,
Dispersing numinous power to the eight directions.
The true talisman gathers qi,
Summoning the Crimson Youth with a whistle.
Triple essence unfolds in splendor,
Infusing my Crimson Palace.
The vermilion spirit securely settles,
Five fragrances overflow in abundance.
Brilliant light shines beyond the form,
Illuminating both within and without.
Body born of water and fire,
Walking alone in flight."*

Conclude by drawing in qi and swallowing three times. Ingest one and wear one. If placing it within a staff, insert one therein.

**Talisman of the Yellow Emperor:**
Face the center, knock the teeth twelve times, and visualize yellow qi entering through the mouth, infusing the spleen, where it generates twelvefold layers of golden radiance, suffusing the entire body. Place the talisman before you and recite the incantation:
*"Supreme origin of the lofty numen,
Spirit turns to the four quarters.
Yellow blossoms scatter above,
Five Emperors intermingle their fragrance.
Flowing essence disperses in profusion,
Twelvefold layers of radiance,
Blending with my form,
Myriad spirits come to welcome.
Pacify the spleen and nourish qi,
Preserve the Central Chamber’s longevity.
Transcend countless kalpas,
Eternally secure without end."*

Conclude by drawing in qi and swallowing twelve times. Ingest one and wear one. If placing it within a staff, insert one therein.

**Talisman of the White Emperor:**
Face west, knock the teeth seven times, and visualize white qi entering through the mouth, infusing the lungs, where it generates sevenfold layers of pristine radiance, suffusing the cinnabar field. Place the talisman before you and recite the incantation:
*"Golden numen of the seven qi,
Pristine blossoms diffuse their fragrance.
Golden essence youths,
Adorned with the Primordial Headscarf,
Bearing the talisman to gather qi,
Myriad spirits assemble at the gate.
Resplendent radiance shines forth,
Illumining the root of my destiny.
Securely settle the splenic splendor,
Abide through ten thousand kalpas."*

Conclude by drawing in black qi seven times. Ingest one and wear one. If placing it within a staff, insert one therein.

**Talisman of the Black Emperor:**
Face north, knock the teeth five times, and visualize black qi entering through the mouth, infusing the kidneys, where it generates fivefold layers of mysterious radiance. Place the talisman before you and recite the incantation:
*"Supreme Mystery of the northern heights,
Fivefold blackness lingers in circuit.
Precious blossoms in five layers,
Flowing light blazes in splendor.
Numinous brilliance flourishes in lushness,
Suffusing the Great Subtlety.
Gazing upward, it infuses my form,
The kidney palace unfolds in freshness.
Securely settle the numinous abode,
Myriad spirits all return.
Body born of feathered raiment,
Form ascends in spontaneous flight."*

Conclude by drawing in black qi seven times. Ingest one and wear one. If placing it within a staff, insert one therein.

**Method for Preparing the Divine Strategy Staff:**
Select a sun-facing bamboo, seven feet and seven inches in length, with seven nodes, to fashion the divine strategy staff. Ensure it is straight from top to bottom; sweet bamboo is best. Inscribe the Black Emperor’s talisman and place it within the second node from the bottom. Next, inscribe the White Emperor’s talisman and place it within the third node. Then, inscribe the Yellow Emperor’s talisman and place it within the fourth node. Next, inscribe the Vermilion Emperor’s talisman and place it within the fifth node. Finally, inscribe the Azure Emperor’s talisman and place it within the sixth node. The topmost node reaches heaven, and the bottommost node stands upon the earth. Seal the upper node with wax, filling it with the *Chapter of the Primordial Beginning*—the middle section of the *Numinous Writ*. Seal the lower node with wax, filling it with the *Chapter of the Five Emperors*—the *Red Writ of the Five Elders*, all inscribed in yellow silk with vermilion script.

Construct a case, its length and size sufficient to contain the staff. When at rest or in motion, keep it with you. You may remove your outer robe to cover the bamboo, concealing it when entering or exiting. If not carried on your person, store it in a clean place, ensuring it is never lost.

With prolonged practice, point the staff toward heaven, and heavenly spirits will offer obeisance; point it toward the earth, and earthly deities will attend in welcome; point it toward the northeast, and myriad ghosts will submit in reverence. Whenever holding the staff to walk or stand, or when intending to act, knock the teeth thirty-six times and visualize the five emperors’ true talisman officials, each clad in the color of their direction, their five-colored radiance flowing and illuminating the staff. The Five Emperors and Jade Maidens, one each, will together guard the staff on either side. Recite the incantation softly:
*"Mountain of the Great Yang,
Primordial essence of the supreme origin,
Opening heaven and unfurling earth,
Sweet bamboo channels the numinous.
True talisman officials and guardian soldiers,
Five colors flow in splendor,
Crimson fire and golden bells,
Assisting the perfected ascendant,
Emerging from darkness into light.
Summon heaven, and heaven obeys!
Command earth, and earth welcomes!
Point at ghosts, and ghosts perish!
Demons and malevolent spirits submit in reverence.
Numinous talisman and divine staff,
Potent and efficacious in all directions,
Attain completion with me,
Attain birth with me.
After ten thousand kalpas,
Replace my form,
Place me in the Five Liberations,
Spirit ascends to the Upper Clarity.
By the talisman’s decree,
None dare disobey.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!"*

Conclude by drawing in the qi of the five directions and swallowing twenty-five times.

On one’s natal day and the eight solar terms, burn incense and bow in reverence to the left and right. Practicing this for nine years with utmost diligence and without lapse, the divine perfected will manifest their form upon the staff, enabling one to ride it through the void. If desiring *shijie* (liberation through apparent death), the staff may substitute for one’s form, and in an instant, one will attain perfection.

**Chapter on Circulation and Transformation – First**
*"Universally proclaimed without end, let all spirits hearken.*
*The Three Realms and Five Emperors, arrayed in words of the Upper Clarity."*

The Master said: This was the moment when the Primordial Beginning expounded the scripture, guiding disciples through the passes of all heavens. *"Universally proclaimed without end, let all spirits hearken; the Three Realms and Five Emperors, arrayed in words of the Upper Clarity."* Now, as an incantation for dispatching, whenever matters of dispatch are concluded, the Dharma Master shall softly intone: *"Universally proclaimed without end... arrayed in words of the Upper Clarity."* Envision the spirits of heaven and earth and the four directions, heeding the command and executing it.

**Chapter on Concealed Transformation – Second**
*"Primal Cavern Jade Chronicle, Dragon Han’s Eternal Prosperity.*
*Vast and boundless kalpas, within the chaos of primordial undifferentiation.*
*Above, no further colors; below, no further abyss.*
*Wind and marsh pervade the void; Vajra rides the heavens.*
*Between heaven above and heaven below, no darkness, no obscurity.*
*No form, no shadow.*
*No limit, no end.*
*Vast and boundless Great Brahma, expansive and lightless."*

The Master said: This is the beginning of the Heavenly Worthy’s exposition of the *Primal Cavern Jade Chronicle*—before heaven and earth were established, before the ancestral *qi* was divided, within the chaos of primordial undifferentiation. There was no obscurity, no shadow, no end, only the *qi* of Great Brahma, vast and boundless, yet without illumination or light. Only in the first year of the Dragon Han did the scriptures first emerge. Now, these words of the Heavenly Worthy serve as the incantation for concealment. The Dao of concealed transformation gathers form into formlessness, unites enumeration into the unenumerable, returns from no beginning to no end, and restores simplicity to return to primordial purity. Extinguishing thoughts to transcend stillness, thus gods, humans, and ghosts cannot perceive its subtlety.

The method: Envision the *qi* of the five viscera, arising with the steps of the *Big Dipper* and dissolving with its steps. Recite *"Primal Cavern Jade Chronicle... expansive and lightless."* Envision the body merging with the *qi* of Great Brahma, the *qi* like cloud and mist enveloping the body. Body and *qi* unite, and one naturally conceals oneself. Yet the noble man remains steadfast in adversity, while the petty man, upon learning this, treats life lightly and indulges in strange transformations. Now, this is briefly outlined but not fully transmitted—exercise caution.

**Diagram of the Big Dipper**
**Chapter on the Numinous Diagram – Third**

The *Red Clarity Unfolds the Diagram*, its movements and measures naturally ordained. The Primordial Beginning securely establishes, unfolding the five scriptures—crimson writings on jade, eight mighty dragon scripts—preserving and regulating the kalpas, ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance. The *qi* of Brahma pervades the cosmos, myriad Brahma realms unfurl.

The Master says: This is the *qi*-transformed manifestation of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Venerable Ancestor, the jade characters emerging to deliver humanity in sequence. Reverently examining the *Gonghua Tianfan*’s four celestial characters descending into the void, they issue from Jade Capital Mountain, governing the numinous transformations of heaven’s primordial unfolding.

Thus, within the *Numinous Writ*, the central chapter arises at the diagram’s inception. "Central" denotes the harmonious fusion of black and red to form the script. From one arises two, from two arises three, whence the upper and lower ranks of the *Numinous Writ* are generated. Uniting the three as one, the *Yellow Plain*’s eighty-one characters follow in sequence.

The two chapters of the *Numinous Writ* correspond to *yin*, wherein *yang* resides, governed by the Solar Palace’s Filial Dao Bright King. The eighty-one characters correspond to *yang*, wherein *yin* resides, governed by the Lunar Palace’s Filial Dao Immortal King. After *yin* and *yang*, the five phases arise; the five phases generate and divide into five positions, giving rise to the writings of the *Five Elders of the Crimson Script*. The five phases having divided, they manifest above and below, hence the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*. The convergence of the inner writings forms the *Three Florets*, which divide into the *Nine Chapters*—the *Scripture of Spirit Generation*—whereupon the *Golden Writ* emerges in full.

Of old, the *Yuanming* script raised the four characters of *Great Brahma Descending into the Void*, inscribing the *Three Conveniences Gate*, unlocking the *Great Possession*’s barrier, and revealing the true origin of *Dragon Han*. The *Nine Chapters* complete, the principles of the *Three Powers* divide: one forms heaven, two forms earth, three forms humanity—this principle is thus made manifest. Hence it is said: "The *Three Florets* depart from the *Conveniences*, the *Great Possession*’s wondrous court." This further reveals how its writings deliver from life and death, preserving the kalpas.

Such is the *Scripture of Delivering Humanity*: its essence derives from the central chapter of the *Crimson Script*, taking one to generate five, the beginning and end of generation and completion. Tracing their mutual interpenetration for application, it cannot be easily comprehended. Seeking its text, the Primordial Beginning’s central chapter appears at the end, adopting the principle of "the head of living things descending," hence the *Crimson Script* precedes it. Now, following the scripture’s intent, it is elucidated as method.

**Chapter on the Crimson Script – Fourth**

The Master says: According to the *Crimson Script Jade Formula*, the true writ’s ancient characters are abstruse, rendering later scholars unable to apply them. Thus, the Most High annotated and penned explanations to resolve the *Jade Formula*’s recondite essentials, expounding the ancient script’s subtle mysteries—transmitted by the myriad heavens, recited in jade tones, chanted afar by the ten directions. Above, heaven establishes rites; gods and demons submit. Yet in later ages, scriptural methods, though transmitted through old texts, often diverge into error.

The worldly cling to uniformity, drowning in preconceptions, prizing whatever they first obtain. Common texts are deemed base, while rare finds are treasured. The worldly further deem the hard-won extraordinary and the easily obtained vulgar and false. Thus, masters who attain the wondrous often withhold it from others. Blind masters misinterpret, each erecting their own doctrines, thereby misleading posterity.

Now, carefully examining and verifying, first aligning with the immortal chambers’ concordances, striving for simplicity and essentials, directly pointing to the宗说 without doubt—thus it is penned.

**Eastern Jade Seal Script**
One hundred twenty characters. The main text follows.

The Nine Qi of the Eastern Dao commence with the Azure Heaven of the August Emperor, where emerald mists coil in layered splendor. At its heart dwells the Old Man, who oversees the celestial registers and summons qi to elevate immortals. Jupiter aids the liver; Horn and Neck fortify the true. Root, Chamber, Heart, and Tail revolve through the four seasons, while Winnowing Basket governs the seven luminaries, rectifying the Dipper’s radiant pivot. Bearing qi, it seizes the false and sweeps away calamitous hordes. The Eastern Mountain’s divine incantation commands the Nine Heavens; the vermilion script of talismanic decree converges at Mount Feng. Binding demons and dispatching ghosts, none slain escape its reach—all are delivered to the Wooden Palace, and none dare delay. Below, it governs the Eastern River and the deities of the Qi Sea. When great kalpas bring deluges, dragons bear the burden; the Water Palace opens paths, forging a thousand thoroughfares. The Crimson Script of the Supreme Lord brooks no hindrance from wind or fire.

**Southern Jade Seal Script**
One hundred fifty-two characters in total. The main text follows.

The Southern Cinnabar Heaven, inscribed with vermilion in the Jade Hall, harbors a great spirit named the Crimson Emperor. Flames surge upward in streaming smoke, and the Three Qi blaze with light. Immortals receive their mandate in accord with the Great Yang. Mars aids the heart; Well and Ghost guard the chambers. Willow, Star, Spread, and Wing govern the four quarters, while the Brush oversees the seven lodgings, revolving the celestial constant. Summoning and hastening convergence, it ensures the Dao’s courier routes proceed aright. The Crimson Script commands spirits, seizing Mount Feng from the north. Binding and dispatching demonic lineages, it severs the roots of evil; the talismanic teachings exact judgment, exposing the origins of transgression. The Southern Mountain’s divine incantation subdues the eight directions; myriad demons are obliterated, and all trials crumble to naught. The Water Emperor of the Southern River, the Dragon King Great Elder, lets the divine incantation flow, universally sweeping away inauspiciousness. Floods are no disaster; the true dragons are summoned, and waterways are cleared, opening a thousand paths and ten thousand channels. Should any dare defy, they are seized and sent to the Fire Palace. None disobey the Crimson Script’s decree.

The Central Jade Script—comprising one hundred forty-four characters in all, with the main text set forth below.

Translation:
The Central Axis gathers all numinous power; the Yellow Prime of Highest Heaven gives birth to the Five Elders. The August Sovereign of the Center presides in majesty, governing qi and overseeing the perfected, commanding the host of immortals. It oversees the registers of the mysterious charts, the jade texts of the lodged stars, hastening the ascent of primordial qi and universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.

Saturn aids the liver, traversing the northern origin in its circuit. [Missing characters] preside over transgressions, severing evil at its root. [Missing characters] sweep away filth and dispel miasmic vapors. [Missing characters] rectify the Mysterious Dipper, illuminating the passage through Heaven’s Gate.

The talismanic decrees of the Nine Heavens are transmitted by the Golden Horse couriers. They issue commands to seize the Northern Emperor, blocking and sealing the Demon Gate, cutting away inauspiciousness so that none may stand before it.

The divine incantation of Central Mountain summons dragons to ascend the clouds, regulating the confluence of the Yellow River and the nine waterways of its source. They must not slacken or indulge; good and evil are wholly distinguished.

A thousand demons and ten thousand deceits rise to face the Lord Emperor. Should any dare defy, they are scorched by the blazing sun.

The Crimson Script’s jade characters are proclaimed for all to hear.

The Western Jade Script—comprising one hundred thirty-six characters in all, with the main text set forth below.

Translation:

The Western Azure Heavens, the Seven Gates of the White Emperor, radiant with golden luminosity, the Great Hua diffusing its mist, the towering White Stone, the seven qi swirling in abundance—above resides the Primordial Elder, the Great Deity, who governs the qi of the lungs, presides over the Nine Heavens, inspects and verifies the celestial registers, and commands the ascent of the immortals. The Great White governs the lungs, while Kui and Lou guard the hun-soul; Wei, Mao, Bi, and Zi oversee the Seven Passes; Shen, along with the Dipper’s Handle and Ladle, receive the talismans of the Northern Origin. The Crimson Script’s jade characters, the true text of the Nine Heavens, summon and gather the myriad qi, universally returning them to the Lord Emperor. The Western Mountain divine incantation, with its Eight Might and Seven Transmissions, the talismanic water ascending the dragons, summoning mountains and dispatching clouds—wherever it is inspected and recorded, all arrive together at the Emperor’s Gate, aiding and protecting the Perfected Ones above, severing and extinguishing the roots of evil. Should any inauspiciousness arise, it is blocked by the Golden Pass. The Crimson Script’s decrees are transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

The Northern Jade Script
Comprising one hundred twenty characters in all, with the main text set forth below.

The Northern Mysterious Heavens, the five qi meandering, within which resides the Black Emperor, the Dual Sovereigns of the Great Subtlety, who govern the talismanic decrees and refine the Eight Might of the immortals. Clad in azure skirts and feathered capes, dragon-patterned and phoenix-embroidered robes, they are raised by the Supreme Emperor, their commands reaching the Jade Stairs. The Northern Asterism assists the kidneys; the Dipper and Ox guard the gates; the Maiden, Void, Rooftop, and Chamber open the Four Vastnesses; the Wall encompasses the Seven Stars, seizing the malevolent and correcting the wrong, averting disasters and sweeping away impurities, illuminating the Dao and setting the radiance in motion. The Northern Mountain divine incantation, stirring the yang to summon thunder, the flowing bells and falling ornaments, seizing the heavens to display might—the legions of the Northern Feng, the myriad demons crushed and destroyed. The Nine Rivers pour forth, the Crow Mother and her flock take flight, the flood dragons clear the paths, the watery thoroughfares open wide. The Crimson Text’s jade script is borne swiftly by dragon couriers and wind.

Jade Instructions, Chapter Five
The Master said: For all who perform the Crimson Script’s pacification and stabilization rites, one must first submit a petition. To proceed without doing so is of no benefit. One must present a memorial to establish communication; this is the proper method. Here is the prescribed form and procedure, presented as a single memorial. The memorial texts for the Five Emperors follow the scriptures above, and the Eight Might Dragon Scripts follow the scriptures below. This merely outlines the essential matters of the Five True Scripts. For all petitions, prayers, entreaties for the Dao, or formal submissions, one must first face east, knock the teeth three times, and proceed as recorded in the "Practice of Transformative Circulation" chapter. Then recite the incantation:

"Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Elder Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Courier Dragon Riders, the Incense-Attending Golden Youths, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans—thirty-six of each—to emerge and notify the local earth deities and the true officials of the four directions: This servant now burns incense and submits this petition, conveying the intent, and wishes to receive the qi of the ten directions’ true and upright ones into this servant’s body. May this petition be heard above and swiftly presented to the Most High, Perfect, and Great Sage, the August Jade Emperor and all the deities before him."

The Master said: Without this, the petition will be obstructed by demonic forces and fail to reach the heavens.

The Five Directions’ Crimson Script True Texts, Chapter Six (Part 1)
All follow the Fivefold Script Format.

The Master said: For all submissions of wooden tablets, such as when petitioning the Water Emperor to erase one’s sinful records, write in vermilion on the wooden tablet, then bind it with azure paper and azure silk, forming a "Golden Dragon Water Tablet," to be cast into the depths of the Three Rivers. When petitioning the mountains, use a golden clasp and bury it at the mountain corresponding to one’s life destiny. When petitioning the Nine Earths’ Earth Sovereign, follow the same procedure as for the mountains, burying it at the central palace of one’s dwelling. On the tablet, write: "The humble official, aged so-and-so, born in such-and-such month." For the Water Palace, write: "Wishing for divine transcendence, long life without death, the Three Origins preserved together, the Nine Palaces’ Water Emperors, the Twelve River Sources, the Jiang, Hai, Huai, and Ze, the vast and profound great deities—beg to erase this servant’s sinful name, that it may be heard in the Nine Heavens. Respectfully presented to the Water Palace, this tablet records the name, with a golden clasp as token and a golden dragon courier for transmission." For the Five Peaks, write: "Long life and transcendence of the world, flying ascent to the Supreme Clarity, the Perfected of the Five Peaks, most divine and numinous—beg to erase this servant’s sinful records, that the name may ascend to the Nine Heavens. Respectfully presented to the Sacred Mountain, this tablet records the name, with a golden clasp as token and a golden dragon courier for transmission." For the Nine Earths, write: "Long life and transcendence of the world, flying ascent to the Supreme Clarity, the Central August Nine Earths, the Yellow Deities of Wu and Ji, the Five Emperors of the Earth Palace—beg to erase this servant’s sinful records, that the name may be inscribed in the Great Mystery. Respectfully presented to the Central Palace, this tablet records the name, with a golden clasp as token and a golden dragon courier for transmission." Dated in the such-and-such year, month, and day of the Great Year, submitted at such-and-such place. Seal with the "Inspector of Ghosts and Spirits" seal. On the reverse of all tablets, write the true text; on the front, write the incantation.

Water Palace Incantation
Face north, knock the teeth three times, recite the tablet, and make the announcement below. Summon the Heavenly Water Dragons for internal use.

"The Primordial Five Elders, the exalted Crimson Script, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the numinous immortals of Great Hua. The Crimson Text’s decrees are heard in even the most hidden places. Ascending to the Nine Heavens, beseech the descent of the Jade Script. The sun, moon, and Five Stars, the Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins. Petition the Five Peaks and the sacred mountains of the four directions. Petition the rivers and seas, the Twelve River Sources. The Nine Palaces’ Water Emperors, the vast and profound great deities. Today, this servant makes this supreme petition, unfolding ten thousand wishes. Respectfully submitting this jade tablet, beg to erase this servant’s sinful name. A thousand ancestors, ten thousand forebears, the nine clans and all kin—sins that have spread and stained, transmitted even to this servant’s body. May all be universally erased, their roots severed and extinguished. Recorded in the Water Palace, proclaimed before the Supreme Emperor. Seven generations of ancestors and parents, delivered from the Eight Difficulties. Ascending to the Nine Heavens, clothed and fed by nature. This servant’s sins released and dispersed, heard by all spirits and ghosts. Respectfully with a golden clasp, pledged to the Water Officials. May the petition be as stated, transmitted by golden horse couriers."

Peak Palace Incantation
Face east, knock the teeth nine times.

"The Mysterious Above opens and illumines, the Primordial Origin oversees the Perfected. The Supreme Emperor’s Five Elders, the Crimson Script’s cinnabar text. The origins of heaven and earth, governing the Three Origins. Gathering and uniting the qi, hastening the ascent of the immortals."

Supreme Talismanic Mandate, universally proclaimed to the ten directions.
Sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the Five Peaks and sacred mountains.
Above heaven and below heaven, the great spirits of the hidden and numinous.
Overseeing life and presiding over records, the Southern Three Gates.
Unsealing the jade tablets, inscribing names in cinnabar script.
Striking from the ledgers of transgressions, the Earth Palace’s Lord Emperor.
A thousand generations of ancestors, the nine clans of kindred.
All delivered, freed from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties.
Departing the Three Evils, souls ascend to the Nine Heavens.
Formerly deceased, initiated and delivered; eternally preserved through ten thousand kalpas.
Today’s supplication, heard by all spirits.
Respectfully with a golden clasp, pledged to the Perfected Officials.
May the petition be as stated, transmitted by golden dragon couriers.

Earth Palace Incantation
Knock the teeth twelve times in the central courtyard.
Securely stabilize the stellar measures for urgent use.

Heaven opens, earth unfolds; the nine qi divide their numinosity.
The Three Origins’ cavernous talismans, the ten directions radiantly clear.
The Five Elder Lords of the Supreme, opening the Perfected and presiding over life.
Cinnabar script and crimson text, the Primordial Origin’s Supreme Clarity.
Universally proclaimed beneath heaven, the imperial numina of the nine lands.

Today’s mandate proclaimed, heard by all spirits.
Respectfully with a golden clasp, inscribing names with utmost sincerity.
May the petition be as stated, transmitted by golden horse couriers.

Further Method.

Whenever the Hidden Script’s Five Directions’ Vermilion Writ of True Text is placed in the five directions, the immortal officials of the Five Peaks will arrive. After a hundred days of strict fasting and concentrated meditation, the celestial deities will descend. Merely wearing this text also enables *shijie* (corpse-liberation). Inscribing the Five Directions’ texts in vermilion on five-colored stones causes disasters to vanish and inauspicious omens to dissolve.

The Five Peaks need not be the true mountains; one may designate the mountains of one’s dwelling as the Five Peaks, aligning the directional mandate to summon the numinous *qi*. The spirits of the peaks will invariably respond. Even upon a person’s face, the Five Peaks are fully present.

**Method of Employing the Fivefold Writ**
The Master said: *"Brahmā’s vast expanse unfolds, revealing charts to deliver the world. Without script, no radiance; without script, no establishment; without script, no completion; without script, no deliverance; without script, no life."* Thus, the hundred demons conceal their rhymes, their coalescence natural. Govern affairs through script; establish chapters through intent.

Within the numinous writs, both upper and lower ranks may be separated or combined for use, always employing the *General Inspector of Ghosts and Spirits Seal*.

**Ritual Incantation for Presenting Petitions to the Peaks of the Numinous Mountains**
On each *benming* *jiazi* day or at the *Lichun* solar term, inscribe the Eastern Vermilion Writ, beginning from the East and concluding at *"Immortal Dwelling"*, comprising twenty-four characters. Write it upon the *Nine Heavens’ Primordial Terrace*. At *Lixia*, inscribe the Southern Vermilion Writ, beginning from the South and concluding at *"Great Yang Dwelling"*, comprising thirty-two characters. Write it upon the *Nine Heavens’ Cavern Yang Lodge*. At the equinoxes and solstices, inscribe the Central Vermilion Writ, beginning from the Center and concluding at *"Myriad Spirits Dwelling"*, comprising forty characters. Write it upon the *Great Mystery Jade Treasure Mystic Terrace*. At *Liqiu*, inscribe the Western Vermilion Writ, beginning from the West and concluding at *"Upper Immortal Dwelling"*, comprising forty-eight characters. Write it upon the *Nine Transcendents’ Pure Numinous Palace’s Northern Pavilion*. At *Lidong*, inscribe the Northern Vermilion Writ, beginning from the North and concluding at *"Jade Staircase Dwelling"*, comprising forty characters. Write it upon the *Mystic Origin Purple Tenuity’s Northern Pavilion*.

The celestial writ must adhere to the directional color: inscribe on white paper, noting the name, day, and month. If submitting a petition, after nine years, the immortal officials of the Five Directions will arrive, dispatching the *Azure Waist*, *Vermilion Jade Tablet*, *Yellow Silk*, and *Great Jade Maidens*. First, knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

*"Mystic and exalted numina, Primordial Venerable Deities,
Great Sages meander, myriad sages attend the pavilion.
Three luminaries spread their radiance, auspicious clouds array on four sides.
Upward, the celestial charts are submitted, the reckoning of the Nine Heavens advanced.
Today, this vow is initiated, a petition presented to the numinous peaks.
Vermilion writ of cinnabar script, natural true text.
Reporting to the Five Thearchs, names recorded in the Jade Chapters.
Myriad spirits oversee and reflect, sun and moon bear witness.
May deliverance be granted, may life be bestowed,
May divinity be attained, may immortality be achieved.
Heaven and earth, stars and constellations, mutually illuminate this body.
Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, Five Peaks and Great Spirits,
Universally proclaim without end, transgressions and roots of sin erased.
The Primordial Beginning grandly opens, none fail to receive these words.
Nine generations of ancestral souls, naturally receive blessings.
Three Paths and Five Sufferings, forever parted from the Eight Difficulties.
Attaining union with the Three Luminaries, together radiant in the Purple Court.
Revolving without extinction, this body ascends as a flying immortal."*

Conclude the reading, cast the petition into a secluded fork in the path, then scatter incense upon the numinous peaks. Knock the teeth three more times and face the *benming* direction, reciting:

*"The Primordial Beginning oversees and reflects, immortal names already inscribed.
Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, no sin remains unabsolved.
Scatter incense to the Five Thearchs, report to the overseer of the Great Void.
As herein stated, may [this petition] abide for ten thousand kalpas."*

**Incantation for Pacifying and Stabilizing the Stars and Celestial Disasters**
To pacify the Five Directions’ Vermilion Writ and summon the stellar officials of a given direction, rectify the celestial divisions. If pacifying celestial disasters, they will subside according to the direction. For the East, begin from *Jupiter* and write to *"Disaster Flock Dwelling"*, comprising thirty-two characters. Inscribe in vermilion on blue paper, expose in the central courtyard for nine days and nights, then burn according to the method and scatter the ashes into blue smoke. Also carve and inscribe on green stone, then bury it. For the South, begin from *Mars* and write to *"Life Spirit Dwelling"*, comprising thirty-six characters. Inscribe in vermilion on blue paper, expose in the central courtyard for three days and nights, then burn as before. Also carve and inscribe on red stone, then bury it. For the Center, begin from *Saturn* and write to *"Courier Relay Dwelling"*, comprising forty characters. Inscribe in vermilion on blue paper, expose in the central courtyard for twelve days and twelve nights, then burn as before. Also carve and inscribe on yellow stone, then bury it. For the West, begin from *Venus* and write to *"Northern Primordial Dwelling"*, comprising twenty-four characters. Inscribe in vermilion on blue paper, expose in the central courtyard for seven days and seven nights, then burn as before. Also carve and inscribe on white stone, then bury it. For the North, begin from *Polaris* and write to *"Moving Radiance Dwelling"*, comprising thirty-two characters. Inscribe in vermilion on blue paper, expose in the central courtyard for five days and five nights, then burn as before. Also carve and inscribe on black stone, then bury it.

Face the respective direction, scatter the hair, and knock the teeth twelve times. Recite the incantation:

*"Primordial Beginning of the Upper Heavens, Three Officials exalted and luminous,
Revolving radiance and effulgence, the four directions resplendent and clear.
Where the celestial revolutions clash, meteors surge and stream.
The Three Realms are disordered, the Three Sequences lose their peace.
Five Celestial Ladles unite, Seven Lodgings brightly numinous.
True Lords, Great Leaders, their tabooed names are Jade Essence.
The Sovereign’s Consort, styled ‘Nurturing Infant’,
Together governs the Mystic Pass, revolving all heavens.
Now, an ominous calamity arises, darkly reported as inauspicious.
Respectfully presenting the true text, the Vermilion Writ is submitted above.
Scattering hair to atone for transgressions, baring the cinnabar sincerity.
May the Mystic Overseer deign to observe, restoring the celestial canon.
Let *qi* not stray, disasters not arise wantonly.
Burn the numinous writ, scatter the smoke in the Jade Court.
Upper luminaries oversee and reflect, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
*Qi* dissolves the Three Passes, disasters vanish in the Nine Netherworlds.
Yin and yang harmonize, the land attains great peace.
Respectfully with a golden dragon, swiftly transmitted by wind-driven couriers."*

Conclude by exposing the true writ in the central courtyard, stabilizing it with a golden dragon, which dissolves with the passing days.

Moreover, according to the directional colors and numerical correspondences, employ lamps for illumination and use silk as tokens.

**Method of Summoning and Incantation**
Whenever receiving the supreme method, one must first subdue demonic spirits.
Once demonic essences are subdued, divine luminaries naturally transform.

For the **east**: inscribe from "Dongshan" to "Jiyan zhu" (32 characters), written in vermilion on a green wooden tablet. Address it to the **Hall of Eastern Florescence and Mystic Numinosity**.
For the **south**: inscribe from "Beishe" to "Cuwang zhu" (36 characters), written in yellow on a red wooden tablet. Address it to the **Jade Palace of the Southwestern Yang Rectitude**.
For the **center**: inscribe from "Chishe" to "Dangqian zhu" (16 characters), written in white on a yellow wooden tablet. Address it to the **Jade Terrace of the Mystic Metropolis**.

For the **north**: inscribe from "Beishan" to "Mie cui zhu" (24 characters), written in green on a black wooden tablet. Address it to the **Northern Cavern of Yin and the Northern Wilderness**.

When reciting the incantation:
- Face north five times,
- Face east nine times,
- Face south three times,
- Face the center twelve times,
- Face west seven times.
Each time, strike the teeth thirty-six times, hold the *qi* for nine breaths, and, looking upward, recite the incantation:

*"The Three Origins illuminate, revolving the celestial constant.
The reckoning of fate concludes, ascending the Hundred-Six.
At the great kalpa’s convergence, myriad demons contend.
The Northern Feng defies restraint, releasing the ancestral ghosts.
Hordes of demons rampage, obscuring the celestial light.
The Supreme Emperor commands, universally proclaiming to the ten directions.
The celestial measure is expounded, the Dharma’s teachings unfold.
The true Dao governs the people, sweeping away inauspiciousness.
What petty fiends gather to cause harm?
The vermilion writ and jade script restrain and subdue the demonic realms.
The Three Officials of the Northern Feng swiftly transmit the decree.
A thousand demons are bound, ten thousand ghosts surrender their forms.
Interlocking bells radiate, stirring the *qi* of the Great Yang.
Golden tigers patrol the four quarters, celestial soldiers seize the fugitives.
Great and small assemble together, none may conceal or hide.
What the Primordial Beginning proclaims is reported to the celestial bureaus."*

**Incantation for Summoning the Dragon, Celestial Water Deities, Halting Floods, and Crossing Waters**
When the great kalpic disasters of heaven and earth arise, and floods surge from all directions, this talisman may avert or halt them. Alternatively, it may command dragons to open waterways, creating passages to ferry one’s form across.

For the **east**: inscribe from "Xiazhi Donghe" to "Wuwen zhi" (32 characters), written in yellow on green paper, and cast it into the water.
For the **south**: inscribe from "Nanhe" to "Bucong zhi" (14 or 8 characters).
For the **center**: inscribe from "Zhongshan" to "Puwenzhi" (48 characters).
For the **west**: inscribe from "Xishan" to "Yichuan zhi" (48 characters).
For the **north**: inscribe from "Jiuhe" to "Fengchi zhi" (24 characters).
For all directions, follow the eastern method: strike the teeth five times, hold the *qi* for thirty-five breaths, and visualize fire arising from the heart and mind, emerging from the crown of the head to burn the mountains, forests, grasses, and even one’s own body entirely into ashes, all scattering and ascending into the azure smoke without remnant. Then, envision the great waters surging and billowing, while one’s own form transforms into a dragon, drifting with the current.

Next, strike the teeth twenty-five times and recite the incantation:

*"The Supreme Origin revolves the numinous, illuminating the Nine Heavens.
The primordial impels the earth’s turning, the Three *Qi* flow in transmission.
The Five Phases press upon one another, the mechanism of fate’s reckoning turns.
Yin and yang clash in opposition, congealing into calamitous collisions.
The great kalpa’s record topples, sweeping away filth and dispelling miasma.
The Nine Rivers receive their retribution, torrents surge through the streams.
Water mothers wander, crows and horses gather in flocks.
Sun and moon darkly converge, the Three Luminaries halt at the passes.
The Supreme selects its ministers, examining the jade script.
Abandoning evil and esteeming good, the clear and turbid waters part.
I partake in the imperial decree, my name listed in the Nine Heavens.
At the convergence of the four great disasters, the vermilion writ absolves all.
On this day, the mandate is proclaimed, and the myriad spirits all hear.
Sun, moon, and the five planets illuminate my soul.
The numinous light of the Five Peaks, the mountains float to ferry my body.
The water palaces of the Nine Rivers, the vast and cold great spirits,
Open and clear the waterways, dredging the river fords.
Dragons respond to the talisman, drawing mountains and sending clouds.
Bearing me, ferrying me, startlingly reversing the celestial patterns.
Vermilion script and jade characters, the Primordial Beginning’s true writ.
Golden dragons swiftly transmitted, the moment unheard.
This must be reported above, presented before the Imperial Honored One."*

Conclude by swallowing *qi* twenty-five times. Shortly thereafter, water deities will naturally open the passageways. In the mountains, the mountains will float; in the waters, the waters will part. This may be called deliverance in times of urgent peril.

**Chapter One: The Dragon Whip**

The Master said: When a Daoist disciple studying the Way wears this numinous script and employs it in divine incantations, pointing the inscribed staff toward heaven will cause celestial spirits to descend; pointing it toward earth will make the earth spirits prostrate in reverence. The Three Realms will gird themselves in submission. Pointing at spirits will command their respect; pointing at demons will annihilate them; pointing at water will make the water deities open the passageways.

When great kalpas shift and cataclysmic floods converge from all directions, wield the staff to summon dragons, and they will shield your body. Through prolonged cultivation of good deeds and the penetration of sincere devotion, the divine and numinous will commune with you. Wherever you invoke them, they will arrive at once upon your gesture—transforming endlessly in myriad wonders, conforming to your will. In your comings and goings, movements and stillness, your position will be exalted to the Supreme Ultimate. Flying dragons will lead the way before you, while the Celestial Harmony of the Nine Heavens follows behind. Phoenixes will cry and simurghs will sing. Twelve radiant floral lights will shine forth, bearing the nine-colored standards and the banners of the summoned spirits.

After nine years of concentrated contemplation, the celestial regalia will naturally be complete. Regularly inscribe in cinnabar the *Script of the Three Heavens’ Supreme Highest for Summoning and Subduing Flood Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, and Mountain Spirits* upon one tablet. On another tablet, record the year, month, and the names of the master and disciple. Bind these two tablets together and enclose them in a pouch. On a third tablet, inscribe in cinnabar the secondary script. Altogether, three tablets are sealed to form the divine staff, resembling a booklet in shape.

All tablets are to be made of silverwood, each one foot and four inches in length and two inches and four *fen* in width. The pouch is fashioned from crimson-patterned silk, measuring two feet and four inches in total length, and is used to encase the sealed tablets. On the exterior, the upper and lower seals bear the talismans of the Five Venerable Ones of Primordial Beginning. The inner tablets follow the prescribed format, while the outer tablet bears the secondary script of Luo.

Inscribe the inner and outer tablets with the master’s taboo name and style, along with the year, month, and day. Include the master’s native place and dharma rank, and the disciple’s horoscopic signs, age, and so forth. Reverently declare: "Within the qi of such-and-such celestial region, I have invoked and received the Three Tablets of the Most High Numinous Treasure’s Eightfold Might Staff Text, transmitted by the Most High to the Yellow Emperor. These are sealed together to form the staff, to be employed in the rites of prostration and reverence."

Whenever used, first make a declaration, then recite the incantation. Upon completing the incantation, strike the teeth nine times, perform three bows toward heaven, draw in celestial qi three times, and swallow it. Point the staff toward the place of invocation, hold the breath for nine cycles, and then cease.

The incantation reads:
"Primordial Beginning, Supreme Perfected,
Five Numinous Ones of Lofty Honor,
Radiant as Mount Taihua’s brilliance,
Illuminating the Eight Gates with clarity,
The Five Venerable Ones issue their decree—
No hidden realm remains unheard.
Above, they disrupt the Nine Heavens;
At center, they restrain Mount Feng;
Below, they pacify rivers and seas,
The twelve sources of all waters.
Eightfold Might Divine Incantation,
Numinous Staff and Jade Text:
Summon dragons to bear the waters,
Gather qi and amass clouds,
Bind demons and dispatch ghosts,
Sweep away and scatter demonic hordes,
Crush the myriad spirits,
None slain shall escape.
Sun, moon, and five planets,
Northern Dipper’s seven origins,
All heavens, all earths,
All waters, all mountains,
The hosts of the Five Perfected,
The vast spirits of the boundless,
Immortal Kings in their feasts,
Five Emperors with their banners,
Heavenly Soldiers as vanguard,
Golden Tigers in pursuit.
Fierce beasts of heaven,
Arrayed to guard the four gates—
What is called arrives at once,
What is summoned stands before.
Crimson Script shines resplendent,
Wind and fire cease not.
Wherever there is command or verification,
Golden dragons swiftly convey it."

The master says: "The Numinous Chart, Crimson Script, and Jade Formula, the Dragon Staff’s chapters—all briefly recount the unfolding of the Crimson Radiance’s revealed chart, extending to the myriad models’ expansion. Every passage records the Crimson Script’s resplendence, its unfolding and deployment for the salvation of even a fraction of living beings. Though its gates are many, one cannot recall them all. The scholar who masters one thereby masters all things—what need is there for multiplicity?"

If one can cultivate with single-minded devotion, what endeavor cannot be achieved? Yet if one seeks each detail one by one, even exhausting brush and ink would not suffice for its application—how could this be considered excessive? This is what is meant by "the myriad models’ expansion."

**Chapter Two: The Primordial Net**

The Primordial Net flows and unfolds,
Through thirty-two heavens.
Revolving without form,
Circling the ten directions.
Spinning the Dipper, traversing the Winnowing Basket,
Revolving through the five constants.
Thirty-five divisions,
Converge in the qi of the Upper Prime.
Eight luminous scenes merge in darkness,
Qi enters the Mystery of Mysteries.
Within the Mystery, the Grand August,
The Highest Perfected of the Supreme Emperor.
Floating upon the radiance of the great rosy clouds,
Chanting and intoning the cavernous chapters.
Golden perfection shines resplendent,
Its resonance flowing through the cloudy encampments.
Jade tones gather qi,
Spiritual winds amass mist.
The Purple Void flourishes in elegance,
Assisting and sheltering the myriad immortals.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
Naturally attain perfection.
Within perfection dwells the spirit,
The Ever-Living Grand Lord.
The Peerless Duke,
The Venerable White Prime.
The Great One who Oversees Destiny,
Peach and Health unite to prolong life.
Grasping talismans, holding registers,
Preserving life and planting its root.
Ascending to the Upper Clarity,
Entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers.
Within the darkness,
In the subtlest of subtleties.
Below, it governs the human body,
In the Crimson Palace of the Mud Pill.
Centering the five qi,
Blending with the hundred spirits.
Ten revolutions return the numinous,
Myriad qi ascend as immortals.

The master says: "The Primordial Net is the essential path of ascending immortality, the supreme vista of the celestial steps. Once the source of the Dao divides, the divine heavens reside above the Hollow Cavern—beyond what words can exhaust, beyond what sight can perceive or hearing can grasp. Those who awaken to its perfection, through perfection cultivate perfection, and external perfection naturally responds. Those who recognize its subtlety, through subtlety attain subtlety, and external subtlety naturally responds. Observing the image of the divine heavens, the position of the Primordial Net—whether distant or near—can be known at once.

The human body possesses primordial qi, connected through the bone’s hidden apertures, ascending to the crown, just as the Primordial Net’s path exists in the heavens. The human soul and spirit within the body are like a person within the heavens—knowing their entry and exit leads to long life and flight; ignorance makes one a common fool, unlearned in arts and skills, unaware of the order of offices and ranks, yet seeking an audience with the sovereign.

When primordial qi fuses and gathers, it nourishes the soul and spirit, giving rise to true essence. The root of true essence lies between the left and right kidneys, called the Gate of Destiny, located in the spring bone’s aperture. Below it lies the great bone, its marrow penetrating the nineteenth vertebra. This aperture is often likened to the Tail of the Tortoise, its spirit the Queen Mother, who faces south to govern affairs. As the Emperor faces her, it is called the Mountain of the Western Tortoise—a metaphor adopted by Daoists. It is also called the Golden Watchtower, for its residence in the west. The right is termed the Golden Watchtower, the left the Jade Chamber. The Jade Chamber signifies jade within the mountain, its wood moistened, residing in the east. Moreover, jade is the origin of water, the transformation of yang essence, where essence congeals—named the Pure Abyss. This is the place from which the qi of the Primordial Net originates, the foundational site of its emanation. The establishment of the precious chart’s high altar begins here. The discourse on the Threefold Storage, the Terrace of Luxuriant Mist, is based upon this. The honored center of the terrace aligns directly with the heart—what is called the Numinous Terrace, the scene of the Upper Clarity. The upper boundary of the Grand Clarity lies below the heart.

The heart’s suspended root extends downward to the liver. Two divisions below the liver, the Northern Dipper’s seven stars reside. Its qi reaches the heart, its origin ascending to the tongue’s underside—named the Bubbling Spring. Its qi descends to the right kidney; the kidney’s qi leaks when the Bubbling Spring’s qi fails to restrain the crossing blades. The crossing blades refer to the Dipper’s handle star, the great □ illuminating the earth—its nature stern and deadly, its spirit the realm of desire. Those who know the Dao press the tongue against the upper palate, directly guiding the qi to ascend along the spine, connecting the spine to the head. The head is the essential path to the Upper Clarity’s Jade Capital. The so-called Western Tortoise and Jade Capital as neighboring realms—some today, unaware, mistakenly place the Western Tortoise in the brain. Yet the Tortoise lies forty million miles from the Jade Clarity’s qi—its remoteness is evident.

The heart resides in the center, its qi ascending directly to the heavens, where the Fire Star is lowest and its qi reaches first. Moreover, the heart pertains to fire, as does the Gate of Destiny’s qi—speaking of their mutual ascent and resonance. The heavens’ sun and moon align with the Fire Star, hence called the lunar triad. In the human body, the two breasts align with the heart. The two breasts are the root origin of the two eyes. The human’s two breasts store essence to nourish the eyes. Thus, when old age depletes qi and the eyes dim, the breasts lose their root, the kidneys lack essence.

The Dipper in the heavens’ northeast serves as the heavens’ pivot, the position of the mountain. In humans, this corresponds to the Shoulder Well point of the right hand. The human’s qi vessels begin on the right. The heavenly Dao moves, beginning in the northwest, proceeding west to the Ox Mansion, completing celestial affairs. Though celestial affairs conclude, generation cannot yet begin—thus creation arises in the north, re-entering the Fire Star. Though the human’s qi completes one cycle, its ebb and flow depend on re-entering the heart. Proceeding through fire, wood, water, and metal is the heavenly measure. Proceeding through heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs is the path of qi along the face and spine’s apertures. Observing the spine’s apertures reveals the above and below, left and right. Seeking its subtlety and tracing the throat’s ring, penetrating the crown gate—this is the subtlety of the Mystery of Mysteries. Subtlety cannot be fully expressed in words, nor can it be pointed to and named.

The formless realm lies below the heart, in the hollow space to the □’s left. From the Dipper’s mouth, the tongue presses the upper palate—this is called the Upper Heavenly Bridge, transcending the Upper Clarity. Thus, the scene of the Jade Clarity is the head, the scene of the Grand Clarity is the cinnabar field..."

The scene of the Upper Clarity is the Crimson Palace. The heart as the Spirit Terrace reveals the teachings of the Numinous Treasure. Thus, in guarding, one guards the heart. Thus, in audience, one attends the head. When the Three Flowers depart from their stems, the court of the Great Existence is revealed. Therefore, within the Heaven of Heaven, the assembly of Wu Ying and Bai Yuan occurs in the heart. Naturally attaining perfection, they assemble in the head. Having cultivated the Upper Dao to this point, the task is complete—no sound can contain it. Thus, it is recorded as the method of the Primordial Stem’s flying steps. Its subtleties are expounded in the *Pure Brightness* teachings; the Stem Diagram is presented below.

The Master says: The affairs of the Primordial Stem, when aligned within the body, pertain to the practices of whistling and chanting the Cavernous Chapters. Discussed in the scriptures, it is called the *Great Sovereign within the Mysterious*, culminating in the state of *Naturally Attaining Perfection and Abiding*. In essence, this is the scene of the Jade Clarity. The Jade Clarity is the Heaven above all heavens. Gazing upward, it is the Supreme; peering downward, it is the spirits of the sun, moon, five planets, and constellations, the emperors of the thirty-two heavens. This describes the assembly and audience before the High Perfected and Great Sovereign. The Great Sovereign resides in the Cavern Chamber, surrounded by the thirty-two heavens in array, encircled by the twenty-eight lunar lodges, with the sun, moon, and five planets standing in attendance—truly the court of the Great Existence.

Seeking this within the human body: the head is the Upper Heaven. The space between the eyebrows is the dwelling of the High Perfected and Great Sovereign. The floating radiance of the Great Auroras is the light within the eyes. Whistling and savoring the Cavernous Chapters are the breath entering and exiting the nose and mouth. The Metal Perfected corresponds to the nose. The flowing resonance of cloud formations and the jade tones that gather qi are the breath of the nose and mouth, their harmonics thus. The Purple Void is the space between the eyebrows. Assisting the myriad immortals, uniting the thousand harmonies and myriad unions, are the ears, eyes, and nose. Without reckless ingress or egress, true youths and children abide within. Their voices harmonize with the celestial sounds, resonating with the Cavernous Chapters. The balanced qi of central rectitude divides, and by its tone, one summons the harmonious qi to emerge, forming the incantation for spreading qi and sprinkling water.

The Master says: The Lord of Longevity is the true star of fire, the qi of the Great Sovereign within the Mysterious. Wu Ying, the Venerable Youth, and Bai Yuan, the White Prime, are the spirit-stars of metal and wood. The Supreme Unity Controller of Destiny is the honorific of water. Peach Prosperity and Union Court are the true emperors of earth. Verified through the Cavern Chamber’s immortal arts, secular texts differ in their discussions. Now, rectifying the original method and exhaustively pursuing its essential purport, we establish the *Cavern Chamber Method*.

**Method for Sprinkling Water and Spreading Qi**
For all incantations of water and spreading of qi: visualize the Great Sovereign within the Mysterious, clad in Upper Clarity robes, holding a green jade tablet, seated upon a lion throne. To his left stands the Lord of Longevity, to his right the Supreme Unity Controller of Destiny, both dressed in Upper Clarity robes and holding jade scepters in attendance. His form is the size of a jujube, located between the eyebrows, one inch square, resembling a golden palace pavilion, radiant with light like blue-red lapis lazuli illuminating water. When spreading qi, visualize the afflicted person and recite the incantation from the *Great Sovereign within the Mysterious* to *Naturally Attaining Perfection and Abiding*, nine times in total, contemplating the ears and eyes. From the nose, hear the immortal music of the Cavernous Chapters and the *Steps in Void* melody. When incanting water, blow qi into the water nine times. When spreading qi over the afflicted, blow nine breaths. If the spreading of qi proves ineffective, repeat the visualization and blowing three more times before ceasing.

**Cavern Chamber Method for Cultivating Perfection**
For all who cultivate perfection in the Cavern Chamber: this is also the essential method of *Three Guarding One*. At any time of day, sit in stillness and visualize the Great Sovereign within the Mysterious, clad in Upper Clarity robes, holding a green jade scepter, seated upon a lion throne. The Lord of Longevity stands to his left, the Supreme Unity Controller of Destiny to his right; Wu Ying to the left, Bai Yuan to the right; Peach Prosperity to the left, Peach Child to the right. The Lord of Longevity is fire. Fire transmits the kitchen without cease, hence it is called Longevity—the heart. The Supreme Unity is the spirit of the Gate of Destiny, hence the Controller of Destiny. Wu Ying is the spirit of the liver. Bai Yuan is the spirit of the lungs. Peach Prosperity and Union Court are the spirits of earth. Things entering earth decompose and generate, hence their spirits are two. These spirits reside in the navel, the root of life, as earth is the root of the Five Phases. To consider them as kidney spirits is incorrect. The kidneys are water, which is known through earth. Thus, when visualizing the kidneys, one also contemplates the two peaches. In visualization, proceed step by step: from their original palaces, each dons Upper Clarity robes woven with golden threads and auroral hues, attending the Central Venerable. The Great Sovereign resides between the eyebrows, clearly and distinctly. Within the inch between the brows lies the vast palace. The subtle incantation says: *"Within the true, the spirit abides; the myriad qi unite with the immortals."* Recite this eighty-one times, taking one breath per recitation. Next, visualize one’s own hun-soul clad in crimson silk, wearing a *Far-Wandering* crown, paying audience to the High Venerable Great Sovereign, sitting opposite him, with the host of perfected in attendance as before. Recite the previous incantation nine times, swallowing saliva eighty-one times before ceasing.

**Chapter Three: The Spirit Sprouts**
The Master says: The scriptures derive from the Brahman qi, their words encompassing myriad principles, all elucidating the Brahman qi’s distribution and the generation of numinous excellence. Thus, one knows that the red-script characters coalesce into the Five Sprouts. In heaven, they are the essences of the Five Emperors; in humans, the excellence of the five viscera. Governing the Five Qi at their center is to stabilize and pacify the One. Therefore, in cultivating the Cavern Chamber, practicing the Primordial Stem, spreading the spirit-qi, and ingesting the Five Sprouts, one employs the method of visualizing and consuming the generative qi.

**Method for Ingesting the Five Sprouts**
The Master says: The Nine Qi Azure Heaven, the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven, the Central Yellow Heaven, the Seven Qi White Heaven, and the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven each possess the Five Emperors and Five Numinous Youths. The Azure Numinous Youth of the East oversees the books of the Pure Emperor, his name is Kai Yang, nine inches tall, clad in kingfisher-feather robes, holding a green banner, attending the left of the scripture.

The Vermilion Numinous Youth of the South oversees the books of the Vermilion Emperor, his name is Dan Zhu, three inches tall, clad in vermilion-feather robes, holding a vermilion staff, attending the front of the scripture. The Yellow Numinous Youth of the Center oversees the books of the Yellow Emperor, his name is Hong Ying, one inch and two fen tall, clad in yellow-feather robes, holding a yellow halberd, attending the center of the scripture. The White Numinous Youth of the West oversees the books of the White Emperor, his name is Ming Shi, seven inches tall, clad in plain-feather robes, holding a white banner, attending the right of the scripture. The Black Numinous Youth of the North oversees the books of the Black Emperor, his name is Yu Zi, five inches tall, clad in black-feather robes, holding a black standard, attending the rear of the scripture.

The practitioner visualizes these Five Numinous Youths descending into their body for a hundred days, and wears the true scripture for a hundred days. Their spirits reside within the five viscera, bringing forth the essence of the Five Sprouts.

On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face east and bow nine times, sit upright, and click the teeth nine times. Visualize the Azure Emperor, whose name is Ling Wei, nine inches tall, wearing a crown of azure jade and a flying robe of nine-qi azure feathers, riding a jade chariot drawn by green dragons, bearing an owl banner, followed by ninety myriad officials of *jiǎ-yǐ* and the Elder of Beginnings descending. In an instant, generative azure qi transforms, like clouds enveloping one’s form, entering directly through the mouth into the liver viscera. Then visualize Jupiter gleaming brightly in the east, illuminating one’s body. Open the eyes, recite the incantation nine times, and swallow the twelve true characters of the Eastern scripture.

On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face south and bow three times, sit upright, and click the teeth three times. Visualize the Vermilion Emperor, whose name is Piao Nu, two inches tall, wearing a crown of vermilion jade and a flying robe of three-qi cinnabar feathers, riding a jade chariot drawn by vermilion dragons, bearing a multicolored banner, followed by thirty myriad officials of *bǐng-dīng* and the True Elder descending. In an instant, generative vermilion qi transforms like fire, enveloping one’s form, entering through the mouth directly into the heart viscera. Then visualize Mars gleaming brightly in the south, illuminating one’s body. Open the eyes, recite the incantation three times, and swallow the twelve true characters of the Southern scripture.

On the four days of the equinoxes and solstices, at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face the center and bow twelve times, sit upright, and click the teeth twelve times. Visualize the Yellow Emperor, whose name is Han Shu Niu, one foot and two inches tall, wearing a crown of yellow jade and a five-colored feathered robe, riding a jade chariot drawn by yellow dragons, bearing a yellow banner, followed by twelve myriad officials of *wù-jǐ* and the Primordial Elder descending. In an instant, generative yellow qi transforms like clouds, enveloping one’s body, entering through the mouth directly into the spleen viscera. Then visualize Saturn at the center of the heavens, illuminating one’s body. Open the eyes, recite the incantation twelve times, and swallow the sixteen true characters of the Central scripture.

On the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face west and bow seven times, sit upright, and click the teeth seven times. Visualize the White Emperor, whose name is Yao Po Bao, seven inches tall, wearing a crown of white jade and a flying robe of seven-qi white feathers, riding a jade chariot drawn by white dragons, bearing a plain banner, followed by seventy myriad officials of *gēng-xīn* and the August Elder descending. In an instant, generative white qi transforms like clouds, enveloping one’s form, entering through the mouth directly into the lung viscera. Then visualize Venus gleaming brightly in the west, illuminating one’s body. Open the eyes, recite the incantation seven times, and swallow the twelve true characters of the Western scripture.

On the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face north and bow five times, sit upright, and click the teeth five times. Visualize the Black Emperor, whose name is Yin Hou Ju, five inches tall, wearing a crown of dark jade and a flying robe of five-qi black feathers, riding a jade chariot drawn by black dragons, bearing a black banner, followed by fifty myriad officials of *rén-guǐ* and the Mysterious Elder descending. In an instant, generative black qi transforms like the light of a shooting star, enveloping one’s form, entering through the mouth directly into the kidney viscera. Then visualize Mercury gleaming brightly in the north, illuminating one’s body. Open the eyes, recite the incantation five times, and swallow the twelve true characters of the Northern scripture.

Irrigated with jade nectar.
Drink and attain long life,
Lifespan ever lengthening.
Afterward, with the tongue stroke the upper, lower, and center of the mouth, allowing jade mushroom to fill the mouth, then swallow three times.
The method is now complete.

**Chapter Four: The Benevolent Salvation**

The Dao of immortality values life, delivering boundless beings.
Above, the eight gates open, the celestial Dharma-wheel takes flight.
Karma and prohibitions, karmic causes from past lives—
Universally received and delivered, the dead soul revives in the body.
Once the body attains rebirth, it ascends to the heavens above.
Above the heavens, each has its gate of life.
Within lies the hollow void, the sound of chants and songs.
The *Lingpian* of demon-kings, its verses match the lofty perfected.
The master says: This saliva is easy to cultivate.
Its spirit constantly gathers above the *niwan*, within the human head,
Ever summoning the true spirits of hun and po for those whose allotted years have not yet run out—all are saved.
Its name is *Fazong*, three brothers, each wielding a celestial Dharma-wheel,
Sons of the demon-kings of the Three Heavens.
The verses of the *Lingpian* follow; their meaning is expounded to form the *Dongzhang*.
The *Tuoyi Xiumo* talisman comes from the *Pure Brightness Sutra*.
This chapter is now separately made into a talisman for worldly salvation and protection.

**First: The Sound of Flight in the Desire Realm**
The human Dao is vast and distant, the immortal Dao boundless and wild.
The ghostly Dao delights—yet it is the gate of human life.
The celestial Dao values life, the ghostly Dao values endings.
The immortal Dao is ever auspicious, the ghostly Dao ever inauspicious.
The master says: This song can sever all evil.
If a household has long harbored demons or spirits and one does not wish to drive them away but only to disperse them so they no longer cause harm,
Use this sound to govern them.
Press the *you* seal, recite the incantation seven times, inscribe one talisman to suppress them, and the specters will vanish forever.
**Talisman**
The above is to be carved into a seal on the fifth day of the fifth month.
If afflicted by fox spirits, have the person wear it, and the ghost will depart of its own accord.

**Lofty, pure, and numinous, resounding through the great void,**
I only wish the immortal Dao to succeed, not the human Dao to languish.
In the Northern Capital’s Winding Springs Prefecture, a myriad ghosts gather,
All seeking to cut short human fate, to sever the gate of life.
Ah! Sing the *Dongzhang* to subdue the Northern Fengdu.
Bind and send off demonic spirits, sever the blades of the six ghostly hordes.
The qi of the heavens surges boundlessly; my Dao daily flourishes.
The master says: This song can drive away and capture evil spirits.
If a household is troubled by malevolent spirits that refuse to leave,
Use this sound.
Press the *you* seal, write the true character in cinnabar once, and entrust it to the dispatched officer to apprehend them.
First, write an introductory note explaining the matter, then affix this to the front of the alley or attach it to a petition.
If there is a seal, press the seal and affix it.

**True Writ in Jade Script**
**Second: The Chapter of the Demon-Kings of the Form Realm**
Lofty and vast, the bright qi soars in all four directions.
The pure conduct of the Brahma heavens encircles the ten directions.
The boundless great spirits all arise from my body.
The master says: This song can ward off and suppress.
If a household is unsettled, plans go awry, or life is beset by misfortune,
Use cinnabar to write the talisman and wear it.
While writing, recite this incantation seven times, and press the *chen* seal with the left hand.
**Talisman**
I possess the *Dongzhang*, perfected ten thousand times to become immortal.
The immortal Dao values deliverance; the ghostly Dao must follow.
Heaven and earth are vast and dim, foul qi swirls thickly.
The three realms delight—pass through them and abide forever.
When the body crosses my realm, it enters spontaneity.
At this time, delight—all by my grace.
The master says: This song can resolve entanglements, flying curses, and lingering grudges.
For those afflicted, write the talisman on paulownia wood, recite it seven times, press the *xun* seal with the hand, draw in one mouthful of eastern qi, and blow upon it.
Once written, rewrite this passage on all four sides.
Write in cinnabar; it may also be worn to harmonize people and ensure success in all endeavors.
**Talisman**
Once written, cover it with the character and place it above the door.
To resolve grave disputes, drive it into the side of the tomb.

The Dragon-Han era surges boundlessly—how can truth be discerned?
My realm is hard to cross, so I compose the *Dongwen*.
Transform and fly through the void to test your body.
Success or failure, slackness or retreat—how many are delivered?
I laugh at those who fail to cross, so I sing this song.
The master says: This song can treat demonic afflictions.
For heart ailments with no apparent cause, use this incantation and talisman five times.
Draw in one mouthful of *wu* qi, write the talisman, and have the afflicted swallow or wear it.
Press the *wu* seal on both sides.
**Talisman**

**Third Song of the Formless Realm’s Demon King**

The Third Song of the Formless Realm’s Demon King says:
Above the Three Realms, vast and boundless is Great Luo.
Beyond the root of form, clouds tower in layered majesty.
Only the Primordial Beginning dwells in the kalpas’ abode.
It governs my realm, ruling over the Mysterious Capital.
Those who transgress my domain enter the Jade Void.
I, the supreme king, command and govern the demon hosts.

The master says: This song may be worn as an amulet—all spirits bow in reverence. For public or private calamities, if no talisman is inscribed, recite this incantation instead. Press the *yin* seal with the left hand, chant the spell thrice, and draw one mouthful of *qi* from the east and west. When the writing is complete, seal it in red, inscribing and pressing the characters on both sides.

**Talisman**

In the void, ten thousand transformations swirl—filth and *qi* bloom in profusion.
Those who preserve the truth are few; the deluded are many.
The Dao of immortality is hard to secure; the demonic path strays easily.
The human path lies in the heart—truly, it does not depend on others.
The immortal Dao values substance; the human path values splendor.
If you do not delight in the immortal Dao, how can you pass the Three Realms?
Should you wish to traverse the Five Paths, what can I do for you?

The master says: This song is an exorcism incantation. For ancestral spirits causing harm—when their transgressions cannot be restrained—inscribe this talisman with the song, then burn it. While writing the talisman, press the *you* seal again.

**Talisman**

Above the Three Realms, within the flying void,
the Demon King’s song interweaves with the cavern’s verses.
Recite it a hundred times, and your name enters the Southern Palace.
Recite it a thousand times, and the Demon King escorts you.
Ten thousand recitations perfect the Dao—ascend to the great void.
Cross the Three Realms, and your rank becomes that of an immortal lord.
Those who hear this numinous song, the Demon King honors in form.

The master says: Inscribe this song in its true form to seal the previously burned talisman. Bind the talisman like a letter, writing this text upon it:
*"By decree, the earth spirits are restrained; attendants escort and receive.
Draw forth from the earth’s gate, deliver from the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend as immortals, forever freed from the ghostly bureaus.
The soul crosses the Crimson Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn."*

The master says: This chapter can rescue those mired in stagnation. For lost souls, first burn the exorcism talisman, then the sealing talisman. When summoning and delivering them, inscribe the text as a celestial pass, detailing the matter in the pass’s preface. For disciples performing deliverance, proceed as with the celestial passes. Write the talisman in ink on yellow paper.

**Talisman**

*The Upper Chapters of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity Flying Immortals Scripture for Delivering Humanity, Scroll Four Concludes*

*The Upper Chapters of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity Flying Immortals Scripture for Delivering Humanity, Scroll Five*

*Revealed by the Most High, the Illustrious Great Envoy, the Perfected Lord of Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation, Xu Jingyang*

**First Chapter: The Secret Treasury**
This is called the Boundless, universally delivering the inexhaustible.
There are secret celestial texts, revered by all heavens.
To leak or slight them is to fall into hell, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.

The master says: This is the Scripture spoken by the Primordial Beginning; it must not be treated lightly. All are the heavens’ secret treasures—leakage or disdain invites disaster. Thus, those who study the Dao as immortals guard them in secrecy.

Now, for the method of gathering and sealing the scriptural texts: When collecting secret texts, press the left hand at the *wu* position, drawing inward and downward while reciting this incantation. Then the method becomes numinous, spirits protect wherever one is, and the household is secured and at peace.

**Second Chapter: The Model Precedents**
The Dao says: These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the Celestial Thearchs and the Kings of the Numinous Demons—all are the words of the Great Brahma, not common speech of the mundane world. Their language lacks ornate rhythm, their melodies lack florid embellishment; thus, they are called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail.

The heavens treasure them, secreting them in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mystic Metropolis. According to the Mystic Regulations, they are transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas. If there is a perfected person whose heart is as precious as gold and jade, they must follow the old protocols, pledging an oath before the Ten Heavens, and only then are they entrusted with them.

The Dao says: The revolutions of heaven and earth also have their ends. The sun, moon, and five planets also wax and wane. Even the most sagely and divine persons have their times of rest and decline. Those of shallow learning also suffer illness and harm. When such disasters occur, all of like *qi* should unite in mind to perform purification rites, offer incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times. Blessings and virtue will descend at once, dissolving all inauspiciousness.

The boundless text universally delivers the inexhaustible.

The Dao says: Those of shallow Daoist learning, whose immortal rank is not yet full, when their destined time of passing arrives and their bodies enter the Great Yin, at the moment of their departure, their fellow perfected students should offer incense on their behalf, recite the scripture ten times, and deliver the corpse according to the method. Then the soul will ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and according to the merit of their studies, after a calculated number of days, they will attain rebirth, transcend transmigration, and become immortals.

The Dao says: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, one should perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scripture. When the stellar lodges are misaligned and the sun and moon lose their proper times, one should perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scripture. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang are unbalanced, one should perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scripture. When the sovereign faces disaster and warfare arises on all sides, one should perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scripture. When pestilence spreads and the multitudes suffer death and injury, one should perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scripture. When masters or fellow students pass away, one should perform purification rites, offer incense, and recite the scripture.

The merit of purification rites and scripture recitation is weighty. Above, it dissolves celestial disasters and secures the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the multitudes. In life and death, all rely upon it—its blessings are beyond measure. Thus, it is called the Boundless, universally delivering gods and humans.

The Dao says: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for heaven and earth, the sovereign, and the multitudes—on days of disaster, if they resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times—all the heavens will record their names, myriad spirits will attend and protect them, and those of exceptional attainment will become sagely lords and ministers of the Golden Towers. The heavens record the merits and transgressions of people without the slightest error. Even the Demon Kings of Heaven will safeguard and recommend them. Those who attain the Dao will thoroughly comprehend these ultimate words.

The master says: This is the Scripture spoken by the Primordial Beginning. It clarifies that those who possess the scripture may act accordingly. For each matter undertaken, the memorials and documents should state: "In accordance with the scriptural protocols," declaring obedience to the Celestial Worthy’s instructions, and proceeding accordingly without daring to establish separate intentions.

Now, one example is recorded as a model: For instance, when performing scripture recitation and purification rites for a deceased fellow student, the text should state: "In accordance with the scriptural protocols, the Dao says that one may thereby attain immortality. The humble [name], respectfully submits this on behalf of [so-and-so]..."

The master says: The jade characters of the celestial script congeal the *qi* of soaring mystery, inaugurating the epochs of destiny. They form sounds through eight meetings and compose chapters through five unions, resplendent throughout the heavens, radiant in the Great Obscurity. They evolve together with the Dragon Han and Red Brightness kalpas, refining water and fire at the end of the Five Phases, containing metal and wood at the beginning of the Five Phases. They inaugurate the Three Luminaries, divide the Two Modes, establish the Five Peaks, transcend life and death, and rouse those in hidden depths—such is the natural script.

On the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month, should one purify oneself in fasting and recite the *Fei Xuan Zi Wen* of Guishan’s Cinnabar Sovereign, contemplating and intoning it in sequence, then one’s name shall be inscribed in the Nine Heavens, demon-kings shall safeguard one’s ascent, and the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears shall all receive blessings and shade. The subtleties of recitation and intonation are manifold. Here, we extract what is convenient and easy to practice, ensuring that contemplation and intonation remain unbroken, as set forth below.

**East**
Knock the teeth nine times. Envision nine-colored dragons dwelling to the left, with nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body. The secret incantation reads:
*"Red Brightness unfolds the chart, ninefold *qi* returns to truth.
Mastering the Mysterious Pass, Azure Emperor, great spirit.
Flowing transformations beyond the nine realms entwine my form.
Sacred sounds of eight scriptures, sixty-four chapters.
Illuminating heaven and earth, merging with me in transcendence.
Conveying the dragon-chariot, ascending to the imperial axis."*
Conclude by drawing in *qi* and swallowing nine times.

**South**
Knock the teeth three times. Envision the Vermilion Bird and phoenix soaring before you, with three layers of crimson clouds enveloping the body. The incantation reads:
*"Threefold *qi* lingers, sacred phoenix takes flight.
Jade sounds of eight characters, resplendent in the Purple Tenuity.
Auspicious day, great celebration—my Dao unfolds in radiance.
Crimson cinnabar nourishes, I gaze upward to absorb the numinous brilliance.
Body generates water and fire, crimson shatters the feathered robe.
Ascending emptiness, treading the void, feet climb the cinnabar ladder.
Circling the eight heavens, seven ancestors follow in tow."*
Conclude by drawing in *qi* and swallowing twice.

**West**
Knock the teeth seven times. Envision the White Tiger and lion dwelling to the right, with seven layers of white clouds enveloping the body. The secret incantation reads:
*"Sevenfold *qi* of golden numen, eight heavens’ honored spirits.
White Tiger steers the chariot, lion bears the shaft.
Sevenfold *qi* entwines, refining me into immortality.
Body emits golden light, illuminating the white numen.
Inner and outer transformations, ascending into the Golden Gate.
Seven ancestors emerge from night, nine depths awaken souls.
Three paths and five karmas—sever the roots of evil forever.
Together we bathe in the abode of blessings, receiving joy by nature.
For kalpas unbound, following destiny, we endure eternally."*
Conclude by drawing in *qi* and swallowing seven times.

**North**
Knock the teeth five times. Envision the feathered canopy and Dark Warrior following behind, with five layers of black clouds enveloping the body. The incantation reads:
*"Primal Heaven lingers, flowing radiance ascends to the Upper Clarity.
Great Dao inaugurates destiny, eight characters reveal illumination.
Flying heavens clarify the void, cavernous sounds arise daily.
Fivefold *qi* entwines, bathing my form.
Crowned and girded in the Northern Unitary, today I receive refinement.
Illuminating the numinous kidney-palace, inner and outer radiance.
Soaring through the Three Realms, roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.
Seven ancestors rejoice together, delighting in kalpic ages.
Within the Forest of Seven Treasures, reborn with transformed form.
Emerging from eternal night, names recorded in the Southern Palace.
Yellow registers and white tallies—erasing death, inscribing life."*
Conclude by drawing in *qi* and swallowing five times.

The master says: Should one inscribe the true script on yellow silk, wear it, and constantly contemplate the preceding chapters, then the body shall accord with the mysterious register, and ninefold ancestors shall ascend as immortals. The method of wearing the script has already been expounded in the *Ascension Charter*. Here, further methods of ingesting characters and the like are set forth below, forming the *Jade Characters Chapter*.

**Jade Characters Chapter IV**
The master says: The numinous script of jade characters embodies the marvel of nature. Its *qi* emerges from the Nine Brahmās, its illumination revealed in what follows. Thus, the selection of these characters holds meaning, and their differentiation possesses form. Those who ingest them receive the *qi* they bear, nurturing harmony to govern the immortal records. From *qi* issuing forth as characters, characters dispersing as talismans, their separation and union arise from the mysterious and subtle, their purport and meaning rooted in profound obscurity. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign recorded them as the supreme seal-script; the Dao Lord Heavenly Worthy harmonized them into song; the Queen Mother of the West translated them to instruct Emperor Wu of Han. After Emperor Wu, they were rendered into the flying seal-script of the Dao’s essence, and what is now preserved in the *Lingbao* methods are the sounds and characters the Queen Mother of the West revealed to Emperor Wu. Should one employ them as seal-script and talismans to prolong life, preserve destiny, and remedy calamities, one must draw from the ancient texts. Here, I have compared the ancient texts with those in the immortal chambers, grasping their subtle purport to elucidate them. Their characters, their talismans, the days and months of their ingestion, and the significance of their application—may these serve to aid the noble adept. The true script of jade characters emerges from the *Ascension Charter*; it shall not be reiterated here.

**True Talismans Chapter V**
**East**...

**South, Center, West, North**—The right talisman is used for others; for self-ingestion, one consumes the characters. The methods and procedures vary according to the direction from which qi is drawn.

**Chapter VI: Ingesting the Characters**
The Master said: All who study the Dao must grasp its purport, its meaning, and its sequence.

What is meant by grasping its purport? To perceive without delusion, to apply with response, to trust and practice it.

What is meant by grasping its meaning? To base oneself on what is unerring, to seek with reason, to penetrate and awaken to it.

What is meant by grasping its sequence? To employ it with order, to keep it simple yet not cumbersome, to practice it with ease—then natural attainment will follow. How much more so for those with jade-like bearing and golden resolve, who diligently ponder and recite, not treating it as a hasty inquiry?

Now, according to the days and months, I have compiled their use for the entire year, and the work of ingesting the characters is complete. Combined with dispatching spirits, cultivation, ingesting sprouts, and guarding the center, each has its appointed days. Within a single year, this requires but a few days, and when practiced together, the initial effort of vigorous practice—whether to aid the ruler, benefit the people, serve one’s parents, or govern one’s household—is grounded in action, supplemented by merit, and assisted by divine illumination. Its transcendence is beyond measure.

**Chapter Seven: The Secret of Characters**
The Master said: When Brahma-qi unfolds in clarity, characters are fashioned according to their origin and held in accord with what is fitting. Some erase names from the ledgers of death and inscribe them in Southern Prosperity; some illuminate the essence of wondrous dharma and seek the profound and obscure—none fail to attain their desire.
Great indeed is the transformation of the natural! Parting and uniting, blending and merging, scattering and diverging without bound, yet meaning returns to one body. It is like the rivers and the Yangtze—luminously verifiable.

**Chapter Eight: Spontaneity**

The Master said: The Dao’s wondrousness encompasses all without omission, vast or minute. Through its patterns—whether vertical or horizontal, inverted or direct, dispersed or coalesced—none fail to serve their purpose.

The Primordial’s middle-section jade script emerges from the Great Brahma’s qi. Divided, it becomes characters; combined, it becomes sound; refined, it becomes talismans; condensed, it becomes incantations. In the Western Han’s *Numinous Treasure* texts, there are forms of flying seal-script and scattered graphs, all derived from the scriptures to serve their use.

My present method of flying immortals and delivering humankind is rooted in ancient records, augmented by the immortal chambers, with additions and omissions to verify the *Numinous Treasure* teachings, ensuring thorough transmission without loss. Here, I briefly select one or two examples from the *Numinous Treasure* to demonstrate their unity.

First, the Five Thearchs’ Great Demons were originally for recommending the stagnant and obscure. Yet in the *Numinous Treasure*, they become deities who break altars and topple temples, governing mad, evil, martial, and valiant spirits—summonable and employable to protect and aid the weak and wandering disciples.

Second, the Eight Heavens of the East were originally four texts all serving as passports to ascent. Yet the *Numinous Treasure* retains only one, taking the East’s generative qi.

Third, the Eight Heavens of the South were originally only for praying for clear skies in the supremely yang regions. Yet the *Numinous Treasure* also employs them to pray for rain and uses their characters as talismans to command dragons.

Fourth, *Hua Mo Yan You* originally governed nightmares. Yet the *Numinous Treasure* employs it to halt thieving ghosts and bandits, for their natures are one.

Fifth, *Form Subduing the Supreme Mystery* was originally a talisman to restrain water. Yet the *Numinous Treasure* employs it to halt monstrous beasts and water spirits, for they are all yin types.

Sixth, *General Overseer of the Supreme Heavens* was originally a character governing qi. Yet the *Numinous Treasure* employs it to halt monstrosities, aid difficult childbirths, and affix it to the inner chambers to summon generative qi.

In these six cases, the *Numinous Treasure* methods differ from the *Deliverance of Humankind*. Yet if one seeks their spontaneous convergence and divergence, they are one.

**Chapter Nine: Returning to the Mandate**

The Dao said: Within these heavens, the Great Brahma’s hidden language and boundless sounds—ancient texts all measured a full *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign of Old inscribed their script to establish the correct pronunciation. Those who know these sounds and fast while reciting them will have the Flying Celestial Divine Kings of all heavens descend to observe their bodies, record their merits, and ascend to report to the heavens. Myriad spirits will pay homage, earthly deities will attend at the gates, great merit demon-kings will protect and recommend them as superior immortals. With the Dao perfected, they may roam the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.

The Master said: This is the origin of the scripture’s compilation. If one can contemplate this and awaken, they will strive without forgetfulness.

These sounds repel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all—sounds of the Heavenly Perfected’s spontaneity. Thus, reciting them summons the Flying Celestials to descend and observe; the Supreme Thearch chants from afar; myriad spirits pay homage; the Three Realms attend at the carriage; demonic hordes bow their heads; ghostly essences perish of themselves. The jade-like resonance vibrates, the ten directions grow solemn and clear; rivers and seas fall silent; mountains and peaks swallow their mists; myriad spirits tremble and submit; immortals are summoned and gathered. The heavens are free of defilement, the earth free of demonic dust; dark wisdom is thoroughly purified, and the vastness of the Mystery of Mysteries is attained.

The Master said: This is the method of reciting the cavernal chapters. The Way of visualization values the severance of thought. Truly knowing the spontaneous sounds of heaven’s midst can summon the Flying Celestials to descend and observe. Thus, one must respond with authenticity, not false observation. Only by knowing the jade-like resonance and reciting and savoring it can the ten directions grow solemn and clear, free of external turbidity; rivers and seas fall silent, free of reckless movement; mountains and peaks swallow their mists, free of reckless leakage; myriad spirits tremble and submit, free of reckless harm; immortals are summoned and gathered, free of reckless monopolization. Thus, the nature and mind of heaven and earth become vast and empty. This is how dark wisdom is thoroughly purified and the vastness of the Mystery of Mysteries is attained.
