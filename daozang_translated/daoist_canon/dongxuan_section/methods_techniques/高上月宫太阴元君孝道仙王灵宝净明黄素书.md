**Preface to *The Highest Celestial Palace of the Moon, Supreme Dark Lord of Filial Dao, the Soul-Treasuring Immortal King’s Scripture of Pure Clarity and Yellow Essence***

The Preface states:

The **Supreme Ultimate**—the loftiest origin—is the **Azure Heaven** of the first beginning.
It lies **five thousand li** beyond the palaces of the Sun and Moon,
where the **divine mechanisms** of the Dao unfold in radiant distinction,
yet remain difficult to discern.

Does Heaven’s Way return?
This is the **dim and silent void**, beyond naming.

When the **Imperial Sovereign** issues the **Shocking** (震),
it is called the **Azure Heaven** of the first beginning.
Heaven’s creation was yet in **primordial chaos**,
before the Five Phases had fully manifested—
it could not yet be seen.

Thus it is said: **"Five thousand li beyond the palaces of the Sun and Moon."**

The **pure essence of the Sun** is the **Supreme Yang**,
the **pure essence of the Moon** is the **Supreme Yin**—
this interplay of **Yin and Yang** is the **Dao**.

Its waxing and waning have their seasons,
its swiftness and slowness follow their measures.
The **divine mechanisms** operate under the **unfathomable governance of Yin and Yang**.
Thus it is said: **"The divisions are manifest, yet not easily distinguished."**

The **Celestial Sovereign**, moved by pity for the **premature deaths** of living beings,
summoned the **Two Celestial Lords of the Sun and Moon Palaces**
to expound the **Four Great Methods**:
the **Soul-Treasuring Method (灵宝大法)**,
the **Yellow Essence Method (黄素法)**,
the **Pure Clarity Method (净明法)**,
and the **Method of Salvation (度人法)**—
each one in turn.

When **Heaven and Earth bind and restrain**,
all things refine into **purity**.
When **male and female merge their essences**,
all things generate anew—
none of this is without the **collision and transformation of Yin and Yang qi**.

Yet when **internal injury** strikes the **Seven Essences**,
and **external malevolence** assaults the **Six Qi**,
then the **plagues of Yin and Yang** take hold,
and living beings suffer the **misery of untimely death**.

Thus the **Celestial Sovereign** summoned the **Two Celestial Officials of the Sun and Moon**,
declaring that **only the most refined essence of Yin and Yang qi**
could **revive the dying, restore the fallen, and reanimate the stiffened**—
granting them **full years of life** and **eternal longevity**.

Yet among these, the **Soul-Treasuring Method** is the **root of the Dao**,
the **Yellow Essence Method** is the **repository of life**,
the **Pure Clarity Method** is the **source of innate nature**,
and the **Method of Salvation** is the **gateway to the Dao**.

The **Dao descends in its proper order**—
thus it is taught.

When the **Law** was expounded,
the **multitude of True Ones** gathered in assembly.

The **Dao Sovereign**, the **Supreme Celestial King**, ascended to the **Hall of the Penetrating Spirit**, seated upon the **Jade Pivot Throne**, and reverently imparted this scripture.

Some may be lost in **delusion**, squandering the **true for the false**.
Yet return to the **original source**, and the **true abides eternally**—
thus the **multitude of True Ones** gathered in assembly.

For there exists a **True Sovereign**—
the **Dao Sovereign**, the **Supreme Celestial King**, is He.

**Penetrating** like water’s depth, reaching all things,
**Spiritual** like fire’s transmission, responding to all things.
Ascending to the **Hall of the Penetrating Spirit**,
seated, the **transformations of Dao-Law** become boundless.
Seated upon the **Jade Pivot Throne**,
the **pure Yang essence** is refined and given form.
Reverently imparting this scripture—
how could one dare neglect it?

Its text is **broad as a yard**,
yet this book shines with **intermingled Yellow and White Essences**,
its radiant bristles dazzling,
illuminating the **Moon Palace**.

Thus it was entrusted to him,
and he was named **Moon Palace’s Supreme Sovereign of the Great Yin,
Pious Dao King of the Soul-Treasuring, Pure Clarity, Yellow Essence**.

While the **Pure Clarity Soul-Treasuring Method** was entrusted to the **Sun Palace’s Supreme Sovereign of the Great Yang,
Pious Dao King of the Bright Sovereign, Soul-Treasuring, Pure Clarity**.

The *Yijing* says:
*"Things intermingle, hence called **pattern (wen)**."*
The **qi of Yin-Yang, firm and yielding**, intertwines to form **pattern**,
and thus the **heavens and earth revolve in cycles**.
Hence its text is **broad and long, a yard in measure**—
**yellow earth in hue**, governed by the **spleen**.
**White**, the color of **metal and water**, governed by the **kidneys**.
At the **receipt of life’s mandate**, the **spleen and kidneys** are the **root of original qi and penetrating qi**.
While the **fetus nurtures within the womb**, it depends upon the mother’s body.
Thus the **intermingled Yellow and White Essences** radiate,
illuminating the **Moon Palace**.
Yet when **inherited nature is perfected**,
it rests upon the **father’s essence**.
The **Pure Clarity Treasure Method** belongs to the **Sun Palace’s Great Yang**.

These two scriptures are **profound and subtle**, beyond comprehension.
They can **reward sovereigns and parents**,
can **forge the Great Elixir**,
can **subdue calamities and demons**.
Those who **behold them** dissolve stagnation,
those who **hear them** are cured of illness,
those who **carry them** attain longevity.

The *Cold Clarity Yellow Essence Scripture*—
its **principles are subtle**, its **Dao concise**, its **meaning profound and difficult to fathom**.
For the **inner** is the **mirror of the outer**,
and **one body** is the **embodiment of heaven and earth’s reverence**.

「When the **Heavenly Sovereign** aligns with the **spirit**,
and the mind extends it outward,
then **loyalty and filial piety** can repay **sovereigns and parents**.
To **extract lead and mercury**,
to **refine water and fire**,
and to **verify them externally**,
then **alchemy** can be achieved.

Medicine forged by **fire** is the **reversal of qi**.
Yet this **guides the common spirits**—the **perverse qi** of demons.
And this **restores the upright stagnation**—the **suppressed qi** of calamities.
Hence, those who **behold the flowing qi** dissolve their afflictions,
for **excessive qi** is their undoing—thus, those who **hear the central qi** are cured.

As for those who **guard the primordial qi** without loss,
even if they endure with **heaven and earth** as eternal companions,
it can be done.
Thus it is said:
*"Those who carry it attain longevity."*
Those who **grasp its meaning** achieve **transcendence**.

**Embracing the harmonious transformations of yin and yang**,
**illuminating the celestial movements of stars and constellations**—
the **Four Turnings of the Northern Dipper**,
the **Eastern and Western divisions** governing the **cosmic axis**.
**Qi’s responses and interactions**,
the **early and late** separations of **cosmic candidates**.
None but those who have already **obtained the Pure Clarity Treasure Method**
can easily comprehend this.

The **transformations of yin and yang** are **activated by qi’s resonance**.
The **Four Turnings of the Northern Dipper** revolve **by the void’s operation**.
The **eastern and western divisions** govern the **cosmic axis by qi’s penetration**.
**Unfolding and extending it**,
it **spans the ages without end**.
**Condensing and gathering it**,
it **shortens the years to mere moments**.
None but those who **exhaust the principles and perfect their nature**
can truly partake in this.

Thus it is said:
*"Without the responses of cosmic candidates,
and the early and late separations,
none but those who have already obtained the Pure Clarity Treasure Method
can easily comprehend this."*

The **Yellow Emperor’s Essence Scripture on Human Dao** states:
*"All who study the **Yellow Essence Scripture**,
by **aligning the Five Qi with the Primordial**,
and **converging the Three Yang at the Vertex**,
may either **ascend to sainthood** or **transcend to transcendence**.
The **young**, with **thousand-day devotion**, may achieve greatness.
The **middle-aged**, with **thousand-day cultivation**, may still attain fulfillment.
The **elderly**, with **thousand-day perseverance**, may yet establish merit.
All disciples, once **obtaining the method**,
should **treasure the fleeting moments of day and month**,
forging **longevity’s foundation**—none surpass this in enduring calculation.*

At **human birth**, the **primordial qi** resides at the **navel**.
Yet the **Five Phases’ qi** disperse through the **five viscera**.
**Governed by the Three Palaces**,
they are the **Elixir Field**, the **Crimson Palace**, and the **Mud Pellet**.

Mortals, **lost in desires**, fail to **gather and preserve**,
thus their **Five Qi scatter**, and their **primordial qi perishes**.
**Ascension and descent misalign**,
and the **Three Palaces are obstructed**.
**Refinement and dissipation exhaust**,
so **premature death** ensues.

Studying the **Yellow Essence Scripture**,
one must **direct the Five Qi to the Primordial**,
so that the **Golden Elixir** is perfected.
And **converge the Three Yang at the Vertex**,
filling the **Marrow Sea** with abundance.
Some **ascend in spirit**, their **vital functions unbounded**,
and **enter sainthood**.
Others **shed their mortal shells**, **resolving the corpse**,
**transcending the dusty net**,
and **ascend to transcendence**.

The **young**, with **qi and blood firm and intact**,
if they **proceed steadily**, may achieve greatness.
The **middle-aged**, with **qi and blood diminished**,
if they **act with vigor**, may still attain fulfillment.
The **elderly**, with **qi and blood decayed**,
if they **strive with strength**, may yet establish merit.
It requires **thousand days’ duration**,
for **numbers begin at one**,
**stand at two**,
and **complete at three**.
**Accumulated over three years**,
they **span the times** and achieve **fullness of numbers**—
thus their success is ensured.
Learners who **realize the swiftness of sun and moon**,
and **know the fleeting nature of each moment**,
should **devote their efforts here**.

All who study the **Yellow Essence Scripture** must **prioritize loyalty and filial piety**.
The **loyal and filial**,
with **upright and honest hearts**,
**bearing qi that is temperate and respectful**,
cannot be swayed by **right and wrong**—
**perverse desires** cannot enter them.
**Ten Virtues are complete**,
**Five Transgressions are dissolved**,
and within their **single heart**,
**external defilements** cannot **disturb**—
naturally, they **achieve perfection**, and **ultimately succeed**.
Thus, the **adepts of the Yellow Essence** regard **loyalty and filial piety** as their foundation.

Moreover, the **loyal and filial**,
**serving their parents internally**,
**serving their sovereigns externally**,
with **no guilt nor fear**,
can **reach the profound and bright**.
Their **names and deeds** are **recorded**,
their **merits at the Elixir Platform** are **preserved in the Purple Register**.
Coupled with **Daoist study**,
they are **like fine gold meeting the forge**,
or **jewel meeting the chisel**—
few are those who, **already carved**, fail to become **vessels of excellence**.

**Loyalty and filial piety** derive their names
from **serving sovereigns and parents**,
all **resting upon upright hearts**, **honest judgments**, **bearing temperate qi**, and **respectful demeanor**.
Yet in **serving the public**,
**honest judgment** is paramount.
In **serving one’s parents**,
**respectful demeanor** is paramount.
**Honest judgment** brings **clarity**—
thus **right and wrong** cannot sway them.
**Respectful demeanor** fosters **abundance**—
thus **perverse desires** cannot enter them.
From **loyalty and filial piety**, they **extend outward**:
**Wealth** becomes **generosity**.
**Speech** becomes **caution**.
**Dwelling** is **spacious and tolerant**.
**Conduct** is **regulated by ritual**.
**Words** are **sincere in truth**.
Thus the **Ten Virtues are complete**.

**Sovereign and subject** uphold **justice**—
do not **reverse the cosmic order**.
**Parent and child** share **affection**—
do not **reverse their natural divisions**.
**Husband and wife** observe **distinctions**—
do not **reverse their harmonious accord**.
**Elders and juniors** follow **sequence**—
do not **reverse their ritual precedence**.
**Friends** keep **trust**—
do not **reverse their hearts of communion**.
Thus the **Five Transgressions are dissolved**.

With **one heart pure and serene**,
like **water clarified and clean**,
how can **external filth** **disturb** it?
Then, in **Daoist study**, can there be any **failure**?

The *Scripture on Guiding Others* says:
*"All heavens record human deeds of virtue and vice,
without the slightest loss.
When the **Ten Virtues are complete**,
and the **Five Transgressions are dissolved**,
then the **register of evils** has no names,
and the **register of merits** is fully inscribed.
The **Purple Register** of the **Elixir Platform**—
what more need be doubted?"*

*The Rites* say:
*"Jade unpolished does not become a vessel.
Humans unlearned do not know the Dao."*
*The Commentary* says:
*"If gold is in the crucible,
only the smith can cast it.
With **inner conduct refined**,
and **Daoist study added**,
is it not like fine gold and precious jade—
**polished to enhance their utility**,
**carved to perfect their beauty**?
**Dryfowl and Hu Lian**—
who would say such vessels are **difficult to forge**?"*

「Now, the disciples may be divided into those who enter public office, those who serve the people while in office, those whose parents are both alive and honored, those who have lost both parents, and those who are the sole support of their parents yet face partiality. When reflecting on their past, they must carefully examine their intentions.

Those who tread the path of public service must understand the true purpose of their office.
Those who wield the people’s strength must know the proper way to serve them.
Those who have living parents must recognize that the debt of filial piety cannot be repaid with tears, nor can the dead be consoled with lamentations.
Only those who have lost both parents know the unbearable weight of grief.
Yet if they can grasp that those who turn toward the Dao will succeed, transcending worldly records and rising above ordinary status, their teachings will be universally followed. Extend this to the world, and there will be none who cannot be reached.

The loyal will revere it to its utmost; the filial will follow it to its utmost. If one embodies both reverence and filial duty without failing, then those in public service will labor night and day without rest to serve their superiors, and with kindness and benevolence to nurture those beneath them—thus knowing the true purpose of their office.

By following the Dao of Heaven, sharing the benefits of Earth, moderating oneself and regulating expenditures, and remembering one’s sovereign and parents, one knows the proper way to serve the people.
The body, flesh, and bones are received from one’s parents, and the debt of gratitude is boundless as the sky. Filial children cherish each day because they fear failing to repay this debt, even in death.
Without a father, where would one find refuge?
Without a mother, where would one find support?
When leaving home, they must protect against cold and heat;
When returning, they must guard against harm.
Those who, after joy, fear what follows—
this is the sorrow of remembering the dead.

*The Classic of Filial Piety* says:
*"To establish oneself in the Dao and act accordingly, to earn a name in future generations, and to honor one’s parents—this is the ultimate expression of filial piety. But if one can turn toward the Dao, succeed in its practice, transcend worldly bonds, escape the cycles of fate, attain extraordinary status, and be ranked among the immortals, then what greater fulfillment of filial duty could there be?"*

All who study *The Yellow and White* must prioritize **frugality and caution**.
The frugal and cautious have no greed or desire, yet maintain steadfast principles.
Without greed or desire, one naturally upholds virtue.
With virtue upheld, there is no shame or defilement.
Without anger or agitation, one avoids suffering.
Without suffering, one can practice the Dao.
Once the Dao is practiced, one naturally becomes expansive and tolerant.
In ease, in stillness, in emptiness, in tranquility, in longevity, in constancy—
only then can success be achieved.

The contented see gain and ponder justice, thus having no greed.
The cautious speak and act without recklessness, thus maintaining virtue.
Greed is enticed by external things;
virtue is rooted in the self.
Interaction with others may lead to conflict,
and daily battles of the mind can never be won by clinging to the form.
Thus it is said:
*"Without greed, one naturally upholds virtue.
With virtue upheld, there is no shame."*

Those who indulge in drink and force themselves to drink cannot escape **drunken excess**.
Those who dwell in damp, low places cannot avoid **moisture’s harm**.
Thus, with virtue upheld, there is no shame.

If three calls go unheeded, one must resort to harsh words.
If strictness is pushed too far, one will inevitably harbor resentment.
Thus, without shame, one avoids anger.

When profit and harm clash, flames arise abundantly,
and common folk are consumed by them.
Thus, without anger, one avoids suffering.

The serene and effortless are the foundation of **Daoist virtue**.
All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures* must focus on harmonizing their nature.
The nature’s operation mirrors still water:
like its reflections, it accepts all without favor,
yet cannot distinguish right from wrong.
Act when necessary, rest when necessary—
to follow this naturally is to grasp its essence.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, once they understand the principles of conduct, must also learn to guard them.
The method of guarding lies in contemplating:
where did this body originate?
Where will it return?
Within this coming and going,
if one recognizes its source,
one will naturally attain **spiritual insight**—
and thus the Dao of the immortals will be fulfilled.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, once they understand the origin and return, must strive with determination.
Striving is not difficult,
but preserving constancy is.
What is meant by the difficulty of preserving constancy?
When food and clothing press in, greed follows—**this is the first**.
When superiors impose restraints, worldly affairs swirl around—**this is the second**.
When children and spouse entangle one, worries and calculations arise—**this is the third**.
When fame and gain ensnare one, they refuse to let go—**this is the fourth**.
When illness torments one, their practice remains incomplete—**this is the fifth**.
When teachers are chosen carelessly, their methods are not properly absorbed—**this is the sixth**.
When debates arise, doubts multiply, and one cannot remain focused—**this is the seventh**.
When resolve wavers, diligence fades, and one forgets their initial efforts—**this is the eighth**.
When time slips away, success cannot be achieved—**this is the ninth**.
All these circumstances lead to **deviation from the Dao**.

When encountering such trials, one must persist with effort, seeking not immediate gratification, but ultimate fulfillment—
then success will be attained.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, once they grasp the way of constancy, must also know the methods of attainment.
What is meant by attainment?
To know Heaven and Earth,
to know the Four Seasons,
to know the Sun and Moon,
to know the Five Phases,
to distinguish Water and Fire,
to harmonize Dragon and Tiger,
to understand alchemical medicines,
to master lead and mercury,
and to perfect the techniques of **distillation and sublimation**, as well as **revolving the cinnabar furnace**.
Then, the arts of refining the form,
the methods of returning to the **Primordial Origin**,
the trials of **demonic obstacles**,
and the enlightenment of **verification**—
all will be fully realized.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures* know the attainment of Heaven and Earth,
yet do not yet know the mysteries of Heaven and Earth.
What are the mysteries of Heaven and Earth?
They are the origin of one’s parents.
Heaven’s black essence descends like a father’s **vital seed**.
Earth’s **qi** ascends in response like a mother’s **transforming blood**.
Within this union,
this body is formed.»

「The Dao of Heaven and Earth, being both vast and enduring, lies in the interplay of **movement and stillness**, and in the **law of repose within motion**. Knowing repose within motion reveals the Dao of Heaven and Earth.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures* know the **four seasons**, yet do not grasp their **mechanism**. What is the mechanism of the four seasons?
A human life spans a hundred years—from youth to vigor, it is the time of **weakness and infancy**. From vigor to the decline of life at sixty, it is the time of **senility and decay**, the moment of **corruption and failure**.
Thus, a single human body embodies the **seasons of Heaven and Earth**.
Therefore, the **seasons of one’s own body** are rare and precious,
while the **hours within a day** are even more fleeting.
Understanding their mechanism,
the youth should apply themselves diligently,
knowing the **seasons of their own body**.
No moment should be wasted,
knowing the **hours within a day**.
Within the body, there are **years**; within the years, **months**; within the months, **days**; within the days, **hours**.
Only then can one align with the **Great Dao**.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, having known the **solar and lunar**, must also comprehend their **numerical correspondence**.
*The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* states:
*The Great Dao is formless*, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth.
*The Great Dao is nameless*, yet it governs the **cycling of the sun and moon**.
Silently recalling the **Two Principles**—
the interplay of **yin and yang**—
assists in fulfilling the **functions of day and night**.
Thus, when **Chaos first divides**,
the **Primordial Yellow and Dark** distinguish their positions.
The forms of Heaven and Earth
are like **joined vessels**.
Within the **Six Extremes**,
they resemble **a single egg**.
The **palaces of the sun and moon**,
ascending and descending by their **numerical order**,
are like the **vital essence (魄)** of a human.
Therefore, the adept
must **nurture the spirit to govern the vital essence (魄)**,
and must not fail to know the **birth and setting of the sun and moon**.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, having known the **Five Phases**,
yet do not grasp their **proper application**.
They **generate and restrain** one another,
as **father and son**,
as **husband and wife**,
as **lord and subject**,
as **male and female**.
The human **Five Zang and Six Fu organs**,
each correspond by analogy,
while the human body contains all **Five Phases** in full.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, within the **Five Phases**,
know **water and fire**.
Yet how does one **discriminate between them**?
The **kidneys** and **heart**,
eight inches and four divisions apart,
mark the **fixed positions of water and fire**.
The **vital essence (氣)** and **body fluids (液)**,
the **Great Sources** of **yin and yang**,
are the **interplay of water and fire**.
The **heart produces fluids**,
descending from the **lung’s fluids** to the heart.
These **fluids** are the **yin**, the **home** of the **transforming blood**.
The **kidneys produce qi**,
ascending from the **kidney’s qi** to the heart.
This **qi** is the **yang**, the **chamber** of the **vital seed**.
Sometimes it flows **from above to below**,
sometimes **from below to above**,
as the **Two Essences** unite,
thus it is called **True Fire, True Water**.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,
having mastered the **union of Dragon and Tiger**,
must yet clarify the **nature of the elixirs**.
For **elixirs** have **internal and external** forms.
The **Internal Elixir**—
its **medicinal ingredients** arise from the **heart and kidneys**,
which all humans possess,
yet one must seek the **Sacred Embryo**,
whereby **True Qi** is generated.
Within the **Qi**, there is **Qi**,
like **Dragon’s Pearl** or **Ox’s Yellow**,
rooted in the **Primordial Yellow Sprout**.
Once the **Internal Elixir** is formed,
one can **store external medicines** in the **breathing exercises (呵呼)**,
such as the **fusion of lead and mercury**,
or the **refinement of cinnabar and silver essence**.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,
having mastered the **union of Dragon and Tiger**,
and discriminated the **medicinal ingredients**,
must also explain the **nature of lead and mercury**.
Within **cinnabar**, there is **mercury**,
comparable to the **Yang Dragon**.
Within **lead**, the **silver essence**,
comparable to the **Yin Tiger**.
**Lead** is the **mother** of **silver**,
**mercury** is the **child** of **cinnabar**.
When **lead and mercury** unite,
**refinement and tempering** naturally occur.
Placed in the **alchemical furnace (鼎器)**,
paired with the **medicinal decoctions (药饵)**,
nourished without deficiency,
then the **Golden Elixir** can be attained.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,
having mastered **lead and mercury**,
must also know the **methods of distillation and sublimation**.
**Distillation (抽)** means **to extract**,
**sublimation (添)** means **to supplement**.
The **principles of extraction and supplementation**
are the **foundation of transformation**.
Thus, Heaven and Earth—
**yin and yang** ascending and descending—
**transform the Six Qi**.
The **sun and moon cycling**—
**transform the Nine and Six** (i.e., the **Nine Stars of the Sun and Six Stars of the Moon**).
If one does not grasp the **mechanism of Heaven and Earth**,
then **True Lead** will scatter in an instant.
This must be carefully remembered.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,
having mastered the **principles of distillation and sublimation**,
must also know the **operations of the Cinnabar Furnace (河车)**.
What is the **Cinnabar Furnace**?
There is the **Great Cinnabar Furnace**,
the **Small Cinnabar Furnace**,
and the **Purple Cinnabar Furnace**.
The **Cinnabar Furnace** is the **orthodox Qi of the North**,
constantly revolving,
encompassing the **beginning of yin and yang**,
and **matching odd and even pairs** in succession.
Internally, it **concentrates the spirit**,
then **harvests medicines from Nature**,
advances **True Qi’s Fire**,
**supplements mercury and extracts lead**,
and this is the **first matter of the Small Cinnabar Furnace**.
When one **passes the Three Passes with a single strike**,
directly transcending to the **Inner Palace**,
**retrieving and refining** the **posterior and anterior**,
**nurturing the upper and lower**,
while the **Great Elixir of the Yellow Court** gradually forms,
this is the **Great Cinnabar Furnace**.

When the **Great and Small Cinnabar Furnaces** are both in operation,
and the **art is fully realized**,
the **form and Qi are unharmed**,
the **Dao is harmonized**,
then it is called the **Purple Cinnabar Furnace**.
With these **Three Furnaces** mastered,
all take meaning from the **operations of revolving**.
Thus, **refining the form**
is the **art of Primordial Inner Observation (元内观)**,
all within oneself.

All who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,
having heard the **precepts and prohibitions**,
must **diligently uphold them**.
Time passes swiftly like a flowing stream,
and the **pills of Qi** and **form** dissipate,
like **burning flames melting into embers**.
Once the **flames are extinguished**,
they **must** be **quenched**.
Each should **early exert their efforts**,
so that the **Six Relatives** may harmonize,
and one may **ascend to the Six Heavens**,
while the **Nine Clans** receive blessings.

From the **origin of the Qi and pulse pathways**,
one must **obtain the smooth path**.
The **Scriptures of the Immortals** are near—
each should **strive earnestly**.」

「High Above the Moon Palace, the Supreme Lady of Primordial Yin (太阴元君) and the Daoist King of Filial Virtue (孝道仙王) preside over the *Lingbao Jingming Huangsu Book* (灵宝净明黄素书), Volume One: *Ziming Right Canon* (紫微右典). The *Lingbao Jingming Academy* (灵宝净明院) oversees the *Right Canon* (司察右演), with Master Fu Feizheng (傅飞卿) as its interpreter.

When **heart** and **kidney** are harmonized,
the **couple** is formed—
for they possess **constancy**.

When **body fluids** and **essence** intermingle,
**lead** and **mercury** emerge—
for they are **boundless**.

Their union has **beginning and end, dawn and dusk, singular pairs, and fullness and emptiness**.
Trace it to **ultimate truth**,
verify it with **ultimate numbers**,
and within one’s **body**,
nothing is left **unaccounted for**.

Thus, **Yin and Yang** alternate in **ascension and descent**,
with **due season** for each.

When **heart** and **kidney** resonate,
**essence** and **Qi** circulate—
and their **flow** follows **numbers**.

The **timing** and **count** are **fixed by nature**,
hence recorded in **authentic scriptures**.

Though **similar**, they are **not identical**—
**extend** to grasp their **principles**,
**exhaust** to fathom their **mysteries**,
yet they never **transcend** the **body**.

Therefore, the **kidney** belongs to **water**,
in **season** the **winter**,
its **number** one.
The **heart** belongs to **fire**,
in **season** the **summer**,
its **number** two.
The **liver** belongs to **wood**,
in **season** the **spring**,
its **number** three.
The **lung** belongs to **metal**,
in **season** the **autumn**,
its **number** four.
The **spleen** belongs to **earth**,
its **number** five.
And each **season** flourishes in its **fourfold**,
with the **viscera** peaking at their **due numbers**.

The **kidney** is the **north**, the **hour of Zi** (子).
**Zi hour** marks the **beginning of Yang**,
the **first Yang number**—
hence the **kidney** belongs to **water**.

The **heart** is the **south**, the **hour of Wu** (午).
**Wu hour** marks the **beginning of Yin**,
the **second Yin number**—
hence the **heart** belongs to **fire**.

By **self-observation and deduction**,
the **five viscera** align with **heaven and earth’s Yin and Yang**.

Humans receive **heaven and earth’s true Qi** to **be born**—
if **harmonized** like a **tuned instrument**,
their **lifespan** equals that of **heaven and earth**.

At **birth’s origin**,
**wood** takes **form** from **water**—
thus *Taiyi* (太一) is **water’s** honored title.

**Prenatal** is the **mother of Primordial Qi**,
**Postnatal** is the **root of the five viscera**.

Examine their **fetal membranes**—
before **grasses and trees** mature,
open and observe them—
they are all **water**.

Thus, human **birth** relies on **water** to **take form**.

Once **form** is established,
**spirit** and **essence** are **complete**.

Then **heart** emerges,
then **spleen**,
then **liver**,
then **lung**.

**Water** has its **master**,
**fire** has its **dwelling**,
**wood** has its **source**,
**metal** has its **restraint**—
all **depend on earth**,
and the **spleen** is **central**.

**Water** is **pure**,
**spleen** is **yellow**—
the **Dao/Way of pure-yellow** is here.

**Form** is **true lung**,
**Form** is **true liver**.

**Form** is **true kidney**,
**Form** is **true heart**.

The five viscera each have their **spirit**,
Each **spirit** has its **form**,
Each **form** has its **qi**.

**Qi** is the **root of spirit**,
**Form** is the **body of qi**.

Yet the **spleen’s form** resides among the four,
This is why humans fail to grasp its **Dao/Way**.

To **master the five viscera**, first know their **spirit**,
To know their **spirit** is to achieve **longevity**.
There is a **method** to guide them,
A **technique** to visualize them.

Now, the **practices** follow:

From **Fighting** (戊) to **Ha** (亥), until **Ox** (丑) at its midpoint—
when the **celestial degree** reaches here,
**kidney qi** flows to the **right eye**.
With **intent** and **visualization**, the **spirit** appears—
wearing **black robes**, a **dark crown**, wielding a **sword**,
commanding it to guard the **cinnabar furnace** with **water**.
The **method**: With hands, trace from the **left sole** upward,
close the **qi** at the **mouth** and draw it in.

From **Fighting** to **Ox**, until **Mao** (卯) at its midpoint—
when the **celestial degree** reaches here,
**liver qi** flows to the **ears**.
With **intent** and **visualization**, a **cup** appears—
wearing **green robes**, a **green crown**, wielding an **axe**,
commanding it to guard the **cinnabar furnace** with **charcoal**.
The **method**: Press both hands to the **ears**, close the **qi** at **three orifices**, and draw it in.

From **Fighting** to **Mao**, until **Si** (巳) at its midpoint—
when the **celestial degree** reaches here,
**kidney qi’s sovereign** flows to the **left eye**.
With **intent** and **visualization**, the **spirit** appears—
wearing **purple robes**, a **crimson crown**, wielding a **sharp blade**,
commanding it to guard the **cinnabar furnace** and **augment fire**.
The **method**: Grasp and press with both hands, then ascend to the **right foot**, close the **qi** at **two orifices**, and draw it in.

From **Fighting** to **Si**, until **Wei** (未) at its midpoint—
when the **celestial degree** reaches here,
**heart qi** flows to the **central palace**.
With **intent** and **visualization**, the **spirit** appears—
wearing **red robes**, a **crimson crown**, wielding a **sharp blade**,
commanding it to guard the **cinnabar furnace** with **fire**.
The **method**: Open the **mouth**, draw the **qi** at **two orifices**, and swallow it.

From **Fighting** to **Wei**, until **You** (酉) at its midpoint—
the **position of Greater Yin damp-earth**,
Thus, **spleen qi** flows to the **elixir field**.
With **intent** and **visualization**, the **spirit** appears—
wearing **yellow robes**, a **yellow crown**, holding a **wish-fulfilling jewel**,
commanding it to **oversee the four spirits**.
The **method**: Press the **abdomen**, draw the **qi** at **five orifices**, and swallow it.
For **water, fire, wood, and metal** all **depend on earth**,
drawing **qi** at **five orifices** is the **number of earth**.

From **Fighting** to **You**, until **Ha** (亥) at its midpoint—
when the **celestial degree** reaches here,
**lung qi** flows to the **nose**.
With **intent** and **visualization**, the **spirit** appears—
wearing **white robes**, a **plain crown**, wielding a **knife**,
commanding it to **stir the bellows**.
The **method**: Press both hands to the **nasal bridge**, draw **qi** left and right at **two orifices each**, and swallow it.

The **ebb and flow** of a single **body** aligns with **Heaven and Earth**,
resonates with **all things**.
Observing **spring, summer, autumn, winter**—
**birth, growth, harvest, storage**—
reveals the **qi-pulses** of the **four seasons** and **five viscera**.

**Spring’s** gentle warmth—**all things** sprout,
before **branches and leaves** mature—
their **qi-pulses** stretch and lengthen.
**Summer’s** scorching heat—**all things** flourish,
**branches** droop, **leaves** spread—
their **black pulses** swell and expand.
**Autumn’s** crisp cool—**all things** withdraw,
**leaves** wither and fall—
their **black pulses** grow light and float.
**Winter’s** frozen stillness—**all things** retreat,
each returns to its **root**—
their **qi-pulses** sink and grow heavy.

When **pathogenic qi** thrives, it **congeals**—
thus, **disease** manifests **externally**.
When **essence-qi** is depleted, it **weakens**—
thus, **disease** manifests **internally**.

Therefore, those skilled in **nurturing life**,
**exhale** to **dispel** the **pathogenic**,
**inhale** to **consolidate** the **essence**—
the **circulation of essence-qi** never strays from the **four seasons’ essence**.

Now, the **veritable secrets** follow:

Raise both hands in **crossed arcs**, left and right, **three times each**.
Lower both hands in **crossed arcs**, left and right, **seven times each**.
Bend the hands **inward**, left and right, **seven times each**.
Clasp the hands **at the waist**, left and right, **seven times each**.
Embrace the **neck** with both hands, strain the **shoulders** left and right, **seven times each**.

Practice these **methods** at all times—
then **qi** will **harmonize**.
When **qi** harmonizes,
then **spirit** harmonizes.

The **Dao of Yellow and White**—what is it?

Yellow is **earth**. White is **water**.
With earth to harmonize with water,
and through refining and smelting,
great vessels may be formed.

At birth, the **spleen** and **kidneys** nurture the **honoring** and **defensive** *qi*,
and the **paths** flow through them.
Now, here is a **treasure map**—
place it afterward to study thoroughly.

The **Left and Right Great Surge** (*Taichong*)—
where **honoring** and **defensive** *qi* converge,
all generated from the **two yin** *qi*,
intermingling at the **left and right kidneys**.

First, **twist** at the **spleen’s junction** and enter the **liver**,
then proceed to the **heart**,
then to the **lungs**.
From the lungs, descend into the **two great mother fingers**.
From the **two great mother fingers**, return to the **nose**.
The **nose** draws in **pure** *qi*,
entering the **two eyes**.
The **eyes** circulate **true** *qi*,
reaching the **two ears**.
The **ears** are the **gates of water**.
The **two ears**, listening back,
enter the **Great Sea**—
the **mouth**, where the **spleen’s inhalation and exhalation** reside.

All **true** *qi* of **Heaven and Earth**
originates from **yin and yang**.
The **true essence** of yin and yang
divides into the **Five Phases**.
The **wondrous functions** of the Five Phases
disseminate into **ten thousand things**.
A single human body
resonates with **Heaven and Earth**.
Thus, the **Dao of Yellow and White**
is attained through the **interchange of** *qi*.

What is **interchange**?
It is **inhalation and exhalation**.
The **methods of inhalation and exhalation**
have **when to exhale and when to inhale**—
the principles of **supplementation and drainage**.

If the **kidneys** overpower the **heart**, exhale.
If inhaling, it is to **restrain** the **fire** *qi*.
Fire, when restrained, generates **smoke**,
smoke, when burned, rises as **flame**—
thus it is.

The **Most High** says:
*"On Earth, it takes form; in Heaven, it is* **qi** *.*
*The marvel of form and* **qi** *is called* **root and branch** *.*
*The root of Yellow and White lies in the **spleen** and **kidneys**,
the branch in the **mouth** and **ears**."*

**Volume Two of the *Lingbao Jingming Huangsu Shu* by the Highest Moon Palace Sovereign, the Filial Daoist King of the Dark Celestial Yuan**

A human body has **spirit**,
**spirit** has **qi**,
**qi** has **gates**,
**gates** have **locks**.
Opening and closing have their times—
knowing when to open, it does not stagnate or cling.
Knowing when to close, it can flow and move.
Thus, follow it to make it ascend.
Like **flame**, when nurtured, it shines;
like **accumulated water**, when lost, it flows.

The **Heavenly Lock** connects to **Heaven**,
**Heaven** connects to **caverns**,
**caverns** connect to **channels**,
**channels** connect to **links**,
**links** connect to **towers**.
The **tower** is the **chest**—
to make the **ears** desire clarity,
to make the **eyes** desire brightness,
to make **qi** desire circulation,
to make **fluids** desire flow—
this is called **illumination**.

The **Most High** says:
*"The* **qi** *rises from the **Surging Spring Lock**,
ascending to the **Morning Palace** of Heaven.
The **Morning Palace** has a **Supreme Gate**,
its lock sealed, unopenable.
If one seeks to unlock its key,
they may ascend the **Cinnabar Steps**.
Do not mistake the **Morning Palace** for your home—
your home is where you dwell among the **soaring mists**.
The wind drifts, drifting,
in **brocade robes**,
left and right attendants like clouds flying.
Out through the **Heavenly Gate**,
into the **Heavenly Gate**—
which is the true **Dao** of the **Yellow and White** *jing*?
The **Awakening** is within.

Beat the **Heavenly Drum**,
sing the **Heavenly Song**—
the **Heavenly Drum** and **Heavenly Song** hold **ultimate harmony**.
In the **feast of song and drum**, obtain **true wine**,
**true wine** flowing like **jade springs**.

Thus, all delve deeply into its **meaning** and perceive its **mechanism**.
The **spirit’s mechanism** operates—
**supplementing the center**.

「The method of **supplementing the center** lies in **reversing the qi**.
The method of **reversing the qi** is to **swallow the saliva**.
The principle of **swallowing the saliva** is **gargling and refining**.
Like the whiteness of ghee, the sweetness of honey, the fragrance of milk.
All who practice **reversing the qi** may thus **quell their hunger**.

The method of eating **three-one** nourishes the **three elements**, yet returns to **oneness**.
Above is without the **brain center**; the **middle element** is the spleen, the **lower element** is the **Cinnabar Field**.
Refine within and nourish below, **propel it upward**.
The use of ears and eyes is valued for their **acuity**.
Yet those who listen well are not truly **acute**, and those who see well are not truly **clear**.
To listen is to hear the **soundless**, to see is to perceive the **formless**.
None are more adept than **ghosts and spirits** in discerning the **soundless and formless**.
The **Divine Light** illuminates, the **Divine Valley** receives.
Illuminated, it cannot escape its form;
Received, it cannot withhold its words—this is so.

The teachings of **Yellow and White** are profound yet difficult.
**Gather the central qi** to nurture it,
hence, **earth contains water**—it cannot be surpassed.
Use **water to nourish the essence**, so the essence is complete and the **spirit thrives**,
reaching the ears and eyes—then their functions are fulfilled.
**Sooth the spirit and concentrate the essence**, cleanse the ears and wipe the eyes.
**Steam the mists** as they rise from the peaks,
clouds emerging from the mountains **enveloping the center**.
The **Spiritual Pass** opens and closes—**a hundred mountains** lie within.
**Earthly qi** responds, and **all things grow** therefrom.
**Purity begets clarity**, clarity begets **illuminating power**.
Sit without leaning, think without deviation.
When the **spirit gathers and is soothed**, the essence is whole and undiminished.

Mountains give rise to clouds,
clouds are **heartless yet directed**.
Sometimes they become **nourishing rain**,
rain ceases and they return.

Let your **face always be lustrous**, your **hair always well-ordered**, your **hands and feet always moistened and cleansed**.
Avoid **prolonged sitting**, avoid **prolonged rising**, avoid **prolonged sleep**.
Always study the **Yellow and White** *shu* teachings,
so that your **mind may know them instinctively**.
Study the **swallowing** of the **Yellow and White** *wen*,
so that your **qi may be complete and full**.
Study the **wearing** of the **Yellow and White** *wen*,
to ascend to **Heaven**.

The **Yellow and White** *wen* exists within the human body,
yet people do not know it or see it.
To not know the **meaning of Yellow and White**,
one cannot yet **communicate with Dao/Way** and **spirit immortals**,
nor enter the **mysterious realm**.

The **Yellow and White** *Zhenren* teaches:
All who wish to **learn the Dao/Way of immortality** must know the **true text**.
The **true text** is the **Heavenly Dao/Way’s primordial qi**.
**Yuan Shi** obtained it, **preceding Heaven and Earth**;
**Dao Jun** obtained it, **walking the Dao/Way’s methods**;
**Lao Jun** obtained it, **guiding others**.

The bodies of mortals cannot be born without the **Yellow and White** *Zhenwen*.
They are all **Heavenly Treasure**, **Spiritual Treasure**, and **Divine Treasure’s** ancestral **qi**.
The ancestral **qi** coalesces to form **characters**,
uniting to form **humans**.
**Sai Ming** descends, and **Yellow and White** are spread.
When **Yellow and White** are complete, then **life begins**.
Thus, **Yellow and White** is inherently **internal**, not external.
Those who lose it cannot be born.
Those who do not know it cannot **cultivate and practice**.

The **true text** of eighty-one characters is the **qi** of the spleen and kidneys.
The five phases of Heaven and Earth—earth and water **qi**—are obtained from it, hence life arises.

Those who study the Dao/Way, if they daily burn incense and observe the **true text**, will perceive the **qi** forms of the spleen and kidneys in inhalation and exhalation. From one to eighty-one, exhaling reveals its outward flow; swallowing reveals its inward return. Each measures three inches in length and breadth.

The **Yellow** and **White** **qi** merge—**Yellow** unites, **White** harmonizes—together forming twenty-four feet three inches, all radiant with five colors. When **qi** is still and preserved, this **qi** remains. Stored in the **Dan Tian**, it enters the spleen, enduring without dispersion. Though five colors appear, they all emanate from **Yellow** and **White**.

**Highest and Most Venerable Moon Palace Sovereign of the Dark Yin, Filial Dao Immortal King, Sacred Treasure Pure Clarity Yellow-White Scripture, Volume Two Complete**

**Highest and Most Venerable Moon Palace Sovereign of the Dark Yin, Filial Dao Immortal King, Sacred Treasure Pure Clarity Yellow-White Scripture, Volume Three**

**Yellow** gives rise to **White**, **White** to **Blue**, **Blue** to **Red**, **Red** to **Yellow**.
**White** shares its function with **Black**, thus **White** also pertains to the lungs—this is the fixed **master qi**.

When the two **qi** merge to form male and female, the **Yellow qi** coalesces within, the **White qi** forms the female, and the **Red qi** forms the male. Thus, the distinction between male and female lies here.

Within a single body, the kidneys form first—they are purely **yin**, hence their adaptability. The heart, paired with **Red**, requires **Yellow** to suffice. Visualize a **Yellow** crone leading a **Red**-clad man and a **White**-cloth woman to unite, as a bride through mediation—thus called **Yellow-White**. The **Red qi** seeks union; without **White** as mediator, they cannot merge. This is the meaning of **Yellow-White** union.

Now, the **qi** of the five **zàng** organs throughout the body unifies, completing **Yellow** and **White**. The **Yellow-White** **qi** begins to mediate—thus, the spleen’s **qi** and the kidneys’ **Black** give rise to **Red** within.

When **Red** meets **White** in union—**Yellow** and **Red** merge, binding heart and kidneys through the spleen’s mediation. This extends to the liver and lungs, harmonizing **Blue** and **White** **qi**. This is called the **central harmony of the five qi**.

The mingling of **qi** reaches the Five Heavens.
The Five Heavens’ **palace** is the ancestral **qi**.
The ancestral **qi** is the **clan origin of ten thousand spirits**.
The **clan origin of ten thousand spirits** is the **Immortal Capital’s palace**.
When the utmost subtlety is united, **True** life is born.

**The Scripture of the Central Harmony of the Five Qi**

Only when the five **qi** are centrally harmonized do transformations occur.
Transformations generate the six **fǔ** organs; their ancestral **qi** originates from the **true text**.
The ancestral **qi** of the six **fǔ** organs is the **total qi** of **yang** and **yin**.
Within a single body, the **true qi** of the five **zàng** and six **fǔ** ascends to the **top gate**.
A **auspicious cloud** arises at the crown—this is the **yin-yang** celebration.
The **yin-yang** celebration descends to the lower **orifice**, generating clouds.
Above and below unite, emerging from the two feet—**yin-yang** alternates, left and right, permeating the body.

Thus, within the body, **qi** and **spirit** naturally merge when preserved. Sound can then spontaneously ascend.
The **Heavenly Ear** hears, the **Heavenly Eye** sees. When ears and eyes are purified, **Heavenly Mysteries** are illuminated, and **Heaven and Earth** harmonize in **Great Peace**. One may enter the **Mystic of Mystics**, attain the **Void**, and ascend to the **True Saints**, registering in the **Morning of Origins**.

**The Essence of the Qi for the Morning of Origins**

**Highest and Most Venerable Moon Palace Sovereign of the Dark Yin, Filial Dao Immortal King, Sacred Treasure Pure Clarity Yellow-White Scripture, Volume Four**

The movement of **Yellow-White** begins with ears and eyes.
The verification of ears and eyes manifests in the **Yellow** core, originating from **White qi**—the true essence of the spleen and kidneys.
When the spleen and kidneys are rectified, perception and hearing become precise.
**White** nourishes from below, **Yellow** circulates above; their interplay births the **True Elixir**.

**The *Yellow-White Scripture* says:**
*"The **Clear and Bright** open, their radiance revealed,*
*Long hidden beneath green mountains and stone.*
*Do not gaze recklessly with both eyes.*
*Within lies a **Jade Boy**, named **Yao Light**—*

「The **Spirit Essence** moves, and the heart responds in welcome—
when the heart thinks, the eyes see, the ears hear.
Naturally, their interplay is like sovereign and minister:
like minister bowing to sovereign,
the sovereign must answer in kind.
When man bows to **Spirit**, the **Spirit** responds likewise.

Though foul demons may lurk, unable to hide their forms,
if one’s **Spirit Essence** is vigorous,
evil cannot disrupt the upright.
Evil **qi** is absorbed by the **Heavenly Qi**,
so it abides—
in secret, aligning with the **Yellow-Subtle Cavern**’s vision method.
This is the **Golden Elixir** of **Day-Moon**’s radiance—
one’s **Inner Elixir** is near completion.

There has never been a fixed method for the **Yellow-Subtle Cavern**,
yet throughout life, one must never lose its nature.
This is not taught by a master.

A **child**—
one who does not spill.
Not spilling, so **Essence** thrives.
One who does not think—
not thinking, so **Spirit** gathers.
When **Spirit Essence** is complete,
it must be nourished.
The method of nourishment is **Fetal Breathing Qi**—
**Fetal Breathing**, the inhaling and exhaling,
with the left hand cradling the head,
the right hand cradling the feet.
Do not let the **Essence** scatter easily and be lost—
nor must one indulge in excess.
Man has **Upper, Middle, and Lower Elixir Fields**—
when **Essence** scatters and is lost,
the **Middle Elixir Field** is unstable,
and **Water** disrupts it.

Within **Elixir** lies **Elixir**,
within **Lead** lies **Lead**—
the **Heart-Kidney Fluids**.
Take one to draw the **Kidneys’ Essence**,
take two to draw the **Heart’s Essence**,
the **Heart-Kidney Odd-Paired Fluids**,
intermingling and uniting.
The two ears are the **Kidneys’ Gates**,
the two eyes are the **Heart’s Gate**.
With **Water** merging into **Fire**,
**Elixir** lies within **Water**.
When **Elixir** is within **Water**,
then the **Nasal Breathing Qi** regulates inhaling and exhaling.
The **Nose** is **Metal**,
the **Lungs** belong to **Metal**,
so the inhaling and exhaling through the nose
is named **Golden Elixir**.

Who can master the **North Dipper’s** true **Heavenly Qi**,
where the **Soul-Spirit** naturally does not stray west or east?
They guard the **South-North True Positions**,
to govern **Day-Moon**.
Those who push the **Heart** into the **Kidneys**—
the **Heart-Kidney Qi** flows in harmony.
The **Heart-Kidney**, when **Essence** is complete and **Spirit** is vigorous,
unite in their coupling.
When the **Heart-Kidney**’s union is precise and unerring,
then **Day-Moon** naturally shine.

To open **Eyes-Ears** is to harmonize the **Heart-Kidney Qi**.
The **Loyal**—
do not act rashly.
The **Filial**—
do not grieve in vain.
If one pushes and practices thus,
it is to serve the **Sovereign** and the **Father**.
If one guards and applies it,
then the **Heart** is the **Sovereign**,
the **Kidneys** are the **Father**.

These eleven chapters of **True Doctrine**,
one must ponder their meaning—
then the heart’s intent will naturally be clear,
the mind’s understanding will release the **Spirit**,
and the **Dao of Immortality** will be realized.

**Practice and Cultivation: Aligning with the **Spirit’s** True Doctrine** (Sanskrit: *Dhyāna*)
The **Central Yellow** generates the **True Colors**,
its position is inherently without deviation.
The four **qi**s unite harmoniously,
preserving me as I ascend to the **Mysterious Mysterious**.

The **Subtle Luminance** guards the **Elixir Chamber**,
the **Caverns** conceal without reckless emission.
The **Spirit’s** true form remains,
this is the method for eternal life.

The **Heart**’s **True Sovereign**,
capable of emitting the **Resplendent Light**.
Descending to merge with **Yellow-Subtle**,
encountering the **True Center**.
The **Green-White Qi**’s origin,
in peace, stabilizes **Yellow-Subtle**.

May I now practice this **Precious Method**,
to enter the path of **Ascending Immortality**.
These four chapters of **Sacred Verses**,
are the **True Spirit** of the five **Zang Organs**.

To practice **Yellow-Subtle**,
one must first engrave this text,
or inscribe it on one’s bedchamber—
then naturally, the five **Zang Organs’ Qi** will be seen,
and the incantation will be sung as such.

**The Sacred Scripture of the **Dark Palace’s** High **Lunar Sovereign**,
the **Filial Immortal King**,
the **Precious Treasure of Purity**,
the **Luminous Yellow-Subtle**—
**Chapter Five** ends.

**The Sacred Scripture of the **Dark Palace’s** High **Lunar Sovereign**,
the **Filial Immortal King**,
the **Precious Treasure of Purity**,
the **Luminous Yellow-Subtle**—
**Chapter Six** begins.

To learn **Yellow-Subtle**,
one must adjust and regulate the **Nodal Principles**,
the key is in **Harmony**.
Do not let **lustful, licentious thoughts and desires** arise,
the mind must be upright,
actions and stillness must not deceive.
For the **Soul** has never been unclean,
the **Spirit** has never been turbid—
when the clear and turbid intermingle,
then **Soul-Spirit** wage war.
The **Soul** does not accept what is upright,
the **Spirit** does not submit to control.
**Lustful desires** and **errant thoughts** drain the inner,
**gluttony and licentiousness** harm the outer.
**Spirit Essence** and **blood-qi** reside in the body,
yet there are subtle weeping and lamenting—
this must not be unknown to man.

Some say the **Dao of Immortality** is difficult,
yet it is not necessarily true.
The **Hell Realms** are mere empty words.
Even if one chases after life,
let alone the past—
this is the true folly of man.
Do you not see?
Even a **grass or tree**, without knowledge,
a **creeping insect**, most minute—
**Cinnamon** gains **Scallion** and becomes **Water**,
a **rat** gains **Croton seed** and grows fat—
none can transform without nourishment.
Now, man refines and ingests,
to attain **Immortality**—
this is its principle.

Again, there is **Master Dong**,
who with four **sutra**-verses:
"Make **ginger** not spicy,
and **salt** not salty."
He also uses **mantra** to influence things.
And there is **Ze Sheng**,
who can exhale **qi** to stop **Water**,
making it flow backward;
exhale **Fire**,
making it not burn.
Even the **Black Qi** can inhibit things.
Now, man recites **True Scripture** in the morning,
practices **mantra-qi** in the evening,
ingests and refines with method—
how can **Immortality** be unattainable?

Now, there are methods of **regulated eating**,
detailed below.

**The Method of Morning Hair-Combing**
In combing one’s hair,
must face east to preserve **Green Qi**.
First, use the left hand to grasp the hair,
the right hand to hold the comb,
imagining as if within **Green Clouds** there is **Mysterious Thread**.
Recite the **mantra**:
*"The **Great Summit** scatters its **Spirit**,
hair becomes **Green Cloud**.
I now comb my hair,
to preserve **Eternal Life**."*

This hair-combing must not leave the bedchamber—
comb in one place.
The **East** is where **Life-Giving Qi** originates,
**Wood** governs **spreading and flourishing**.
Man’s hair and fur,
like **grass and trees**’ branches and leaves,
thus its method is to face **East**,
and preserve **Green Cloud**.

**The Method of Clothing**
Clothing must be donned toward the **Moon’s Direction**.
The **mantra** says:
*"Heaven bestows **Golden Thread Clothing**,
**Golden Clothing** fits when worn.
Warmth is regulated with moderation,
wearing it, disease departs."*

This method of clothing,
preserves as if the **Five-Colored Clouds** cover the body.
The **Moon’s Direction** is where the **Ladle Star** points.
Upon rising and dressing,
one must follow the **Moon’s Direction**.
Preserve the **Five-Colored Clouds**,
taking the **qi** of the five **Phases** to envelop the four limbs.»

**The Method of Inviting the Body’s Form**

When one awakens from sleep, having combed the hair and donned the clothing, let them sit quietly for a moment, contemplating how all the myriad **spirits** (神) and **souls** (魂魄) gather within the body, then proceed outside to perform **ablutions** (盥漱).

The **mantra** states:
*"The Three Souls and Seven Spirits return to the **Zheng Palace**,
The Six **Organs** and Five **Visceral Stores** dwell within.
Each guards and protects its counterpart, none may be disturbed,
All malevolent spirits and demons cannot approach.
Having thus invoked the **spirits** (神), one exits the door to perform ablutions."*

When a person sleeps, their **spirit** (神) and **souls** (魂魄) scatter and fly abroad; hence, upon waking, they must summon and gather them back.

**The Method of Ablutions and Washing the Face**

In all four seasons, use water from the **well’s blossoms** (井花水) to wash the face, preserving the **qi** of **sun and moon intersecting light** (日月交光之气), ensuring the **five colors** (五色) fill the center, then proceed to wash.

The **mantra** says:
*"Nectar of jade transforms the flesh,
Repelling age, restoring youth.
Auspicious blessings gather ceaselessly,
Granting me the visage of a child.
**Yin and Yang**, the **Five Phases**,
All things that retain them live, that lose them die.
Thus, one must preserve the **qi** of **sun and moon intersecting light**.
The **five colors** filling the center refers to their never leaving the body for an instant."*

**The Method of Taking Medicine**

When taking medicine, one must follow the **original direction** (本方) accordingly.

**The Method of Taking Medicine (Continued)**

There are those who take medicine after eating, and those who first enter stillness and invoke the spirit—both follow their accustomed ways. The key is simplicity, avoiding excess, lest **qi** and blood be overstrained.

**Mantra for Taking Medicine:**
*"Immortal elixirs of Penglai secure eternal life,
The **Dao**-medicine kings of sun and moon aid my path.
Taken, one may live a thousand years or more,
All malevolent **qi** departs, vanishing like dust and smoke.
All things possess sentience; they nourish the human.
When **essence** gathers, the spirit follows—thus, invoke the **Dao**-medicine kings.
When spirit and **qi** align, righteous **qi** thrives, malevolent **qi** dissipates—
Thus, they depart like smoke and dust.*

**The Method of Entering Stillness**
When entering stillness, one may recite scriptures, cultivate **qi**, or pay homage to the divine—each follows its own tradition. Yet the human soul and spirit intermingle with **yin qi**; fear may arise, so first calm them with a mantra.

**Mantra for Calming the Spirit:**
*"The five **zàng**-organs, fragrant officials of the sun-king,
Join me in this departure toward the True.
Guide my spirit and cognition to clarity,
May no fear or terror cause them to scatter."*

Reciting scriptures, cultivating **qi**, or paying homage—all involve directing one’s own spirit toward another’s, uniting **yang** with **yin**. Thus, one must first calm the spirit before offering reverence.

**The Method of Eating and Drinking**
When consuming the five flavors, regulation must be observed, never neglecting the proper timing, so that harmony comes naturally. As for fasting and **intermittent abstinence**, one must do so with discipline—until the Great Medicine of **golden elixir** is attained, such practices should not be undertaken lightly.

Meals should be taken before the hour of *shen* (3–5 PM). Beyond this time, even abundant food yields no benefit.

**Mantra for Meals:**
*"Divine kitchen of Heaven, grant me sustenance.
Divine kitchen of Heaven, grant me sustenance."*

**The Method of Regulating Qi After Eating**
After eating, wipe the face with a hand to induce perspiration, making it radiant.
Then, massage the abdomen gently while walking slowly along the veranda for five to seven *li*, before stopping.

**Mantra:**
*"The True One of Heaven’s center gathers within me,
A hundred malevolences dare not approach or harm.
Wherever I walk, ghosts and spirits recoil in awe,
Dispelling demons and calamities, leaving no trace."*

**The Method of Using the Toilet**
When using the toilet, impure **qi** arises, risking harm to the spirit **qi**. One must first shake out the clothing.
After reciting the mantra, repeat:

*"With the five **zàng**-organs and five grains, I nourish my **essence**.
I purge the rotten remains, lest they harm the spirit.
When the matter is concluded, know this."*

**The Method of Using the Toilet (Continued)**
When using the toilet, avoid doing so beneath the sun, moon, stars, or constellations, nor facing east or northeast.
Impure **qi** and corruption are contrary to the divine, so one must recite the mantra to dispel filth and preserve the spirit.

**The Method of Sleeping**
When lying down, one must face east or south to align with the convergence of the two *dou* (cosmic poles).
The mantra states:
*"The Five Celestial Guards and the Spirit **Qi** enfold my body,
Within dreams and waking, the soul and spirit remain at peace."*

East and south are where the **yang qi** resides.
Those who cultivate the **Dao** refine **yin** to return to **yang**, so their sleep should mirror Confucius’ eastward posture or Guangchengzi’s southward one.

Further, align with the two *dou* of south and north to absorb the **Dao’s** true **yang** and **yin**, thus sheltering the body.

**End of the Sixth Volume of *The Yellow Silk Scripture of the Highest Purity and Divine Treasure of the Moon Palace’s Sovereign, the Mother of Great Darkness***

**Seventh Volume of *The Yellow Silk Scripture of the Highest Purity and Divine Treasure of the Moon Palace’s Sovereign, the Mother of Great Darkness***

The **spleen** is the central sovereign, governing the **zàng**-organs’ **zhèng qi** (true **qi**).
The **lungs** are the general, commanding the five **qi**’s breath.
If breath falters even once, illness arises; if **qi** does not generate, death follows.
Thus, the **lungs** must cover above, and the **spleen** must support below—this is the fundamental principle of the *Yellow Silk Scripture*.
At the hours of *zi* (11 PM–1 AM) and *wu* (11 AM–1 PM), visualize a child holding a yellow banner within the **spleen** and **lungs**.
If **white qi** appears, like wind stirring the banner,
close the breath and focus the mind—then all distractions will cease.
The five **zàng**-organs all nourish **essence** and **qi**, yet here the emphasis lies on the **spleen** and **lungs**.
The **heart** and **kidneys** are husband and wife,
while the **spleen** and **lungs** are mother and child.
Only after mother and child nourish each other does the father-son relationship arise—thus the **liver** generates, and the **liver** gives birth to the **heart**.
The **heart** is the sovereign; thus, this is the **Dao** of lord and minister, preserved in sequence.

Heaven is high, Earth is low; the three **yin** and three **yang** circulate within.
In one’s body, **yin** and **yang qi** flow through.
Harmony brings peace; imbalance brings illness.
Thus, when cold or heat overpowers, it becomes *nuè* (malaria-like fever) or *lì* (severe cold).
If **yang qi** is excessive while **yin** is suppressed, it becomes *lì*.
If **yang qi** is suppressed while **yin** is excessive, it becomes *wēn* (epidemic disease).
If **yang qi** is stagnant and does not circulate, it becomes *jū* (ulcerous sores).
If blood and **qi** are blocked, it becomes *yǒu* (a wasting disease).
All these manifest as bear-like afflictions, threatening life itself.

Many know how illness harms, yet few grasp cultivation to achieve longevity.
They see distant threats yet fail to observe those near at hand.
If you cover one eye, you cannot see.
If you pinch one ear, you cannot hear.
If you hold your breath, internal **qi** cannot escape.
If you sneeze, external **qi** cannot enter.
Understanding this, how can you doubt that focusing the mind and calling **qi** can bring harmony?

Only by mastering focused contemplation and **qi**-invocation can one grasp the *Yellow Silk Scripture*’s true essence.
What is the true essence?
All else is not the true essence.
The eyes perceive color, the ears hear sound, the nose smells fragrance, the mouth tastes flavor—
lust for clothing, money, or filth; or entanglement in debauchery and deceit—
all arise from imagination.
If you focus correctly, what you attain will also be effortless.
Thus, the **Dao** of *Yellow Silk Scripture* is easier than pursuing the pleasures of the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.
Those who attain this **Dao** will prevail.

What does it mean to prevail?
No one does not desire longevity, yet this method can grant it.
No one does not desire divinity, yet this method can achieve it.
Thus, the **Dao** of longevity and immortality lies not in idle thought but in focused contemplation to align with the true essence.

The **Dao** is without contemplation or action.
Without contemplation does not mean one never contemplates—
contemplation is the rectification of nature.
Without action does not mean one never acts—
action is the fulfillment of principle.
If one insists on "without contemplation," they are no better than beasts.
If one insists on "without action," they are no better than stone.
To mistake beasts and stone for the **Dao**, saying,
*"I have no contemplation; I have no action,"*
is false.

Now, if a person sits in a grand hall,
fire rising from above—they will flee;
water overflowing from below—they will flee.
If they do not flee, it is because they discern whether the threat is true or false.
If they can discern correctly, they must say:
*"Fire and water approach, threatening my life—I must flee!"*
Yet if the **Dao** is claimed to be without contemplation or action,
while also relying on focused visualization and **qi**-invocation,
this is a contradiction—and it is not so.

Thus, the mind feels, the spirit condenses, the **qi** interacts, and sincerity is achieved.
What is *feeling*?
It is responding to sound.
What is *condensing*?
It is focusing on one thing and becoming still.
What is *interacting*?
It is stillness that allows interaction.
What is *achieving*?
It is interaction that brings fulfillment.

For the silent morning audience method of communicating with the heavens,
this principle applies—then the soul and spirit will not wander,
and the audience will not be lost.
If, during this time, a boy stands beside you,
striking the *zhèng* (metallophone) or walking in empty space,
and your spirit rises with the sound,
then upon returning, it will also seek the sound—
this is the supreme method.

These techniques vary widely, yet beyond them lies an essential truth.
Now, many cultivate the **Dao** and seek the spirit,
yet they only refine **yin qi**—like the *Yuángāng* (primordial **qi**) walking method.
Within *Yuángāng*, there is also the method of **yang qi**.
Directly within the physical form, its benefits are immediate,
though refining **yin qi** for ten years is still difficult.
Methods like the *Rìyuè Jié Lún Gāoběn* (sun-moon purification of the essence’s foundation) are **yang**-based,
requiring deep familiarity—if not, one will be attached to other practices.

Few can ascend and transform, yet many can shed their bones.
At the moment of shedding bones,
one must be thoroughly familiar with the *Yuángāng* walking method,
the palace courts and morning audiences,
and the proper responses to the celestial throne.
Ignorance here will invite the *Luóxiá* (demons) and a hundred ghosts
to deceive and ensnare you within the realm.
Only those who recognize this danger will succeed.

The eyes round—these are evil ghosts.
When my mind knows this, ghosts and spirits will fear death as well.
To hear and see spirits, one must scrutinize carefully.
Pure and refined ghosts may feign true immortals,
leading astray by calling error truth and truth error—
most misleading to later learners.
Only by recognizing sincerity can one discern.
Temple hair greenish-blue, face red with square eyes—
these are the true high immortals.
Should any of these signs be lacking, it is not so.
At this time, with right mindfulness, demons and evils will retreat and submit.

**Yellow Silk Canon, Volume Seven of the High Celestial Moon Palace, Great Yin Yuanjun Filial Dao Immortal’s Sacred Treasure Pure Bright Yellow Silk Scripture** ends.
**Yellow Silk Canon, Volume Eight of the High Celestial Moon Palace, Great Yin Yuanjun Filial Dao Immortal’s Sacred Treasure Pure Bright Yellow Silk Scripture** begins.

**Yellow Silk Inner Classic, Upper Section**
The divine palace looms atop Kunlun’s peak,
Beneath Kunlun’s mountain, the Double Bay flows.
Clear and turbid *qi* divide into dark and yellow,
Dark and yellow *qi* settle into round and square.
The two *qi* intermingle, generating yin and yang,
Yin and yang illuminate the central hall with soul and spirit.
To gather them requires the art of the heart-mind,
When refined, they become nourishment like rich grains.
No need for five grains to fill the storehouses—
Consuming them long enough ensures well-being.
Dragon chariots and phoenix attendants enter the round light,
Each diagram’s secret installed within the palace.
The Yang Emperor and Yin Child bow in reverence,
At seventy-seven breaths, spirit and *qi* unite.
Returning to the chariot’s wheel, back to the original palace,
Naturally, the Dao is complete—soaring through empty space.

**Yellow Silk Inner Classic, Middle Section**
The marvel of husband and wife lies in primal function,
One inhalation, one exhalation—*qi* grows dense.
Seal the lips, swallow gently like wind through clouds,
Sweet as ghee and milk, filling the heart-chest.
Naturally plump with spirited vigor,
Augmented by the great elixir’s nourishment.
Nurtured thus, *qi* and blood flush the cheeks red,
No need for five grains—swallowing wind-clouds instead.
Five grains originally nourish *qi* and blood,
Seven days without them exhausts human fate.
The Master abstains—there must be method,
Gradual and sudden techniques honed together.
Pine, cypress, hempseed—*qi* flavors blend,
Mountain grains and surplus stores preserve the center.
Must daily consume *qi* to fill the void,
Only then can the great elixir perfect primal function.

**Yellow Silk Inner Classic, Lower Section**
Human elixir cannot be forced—
To forge it requires virtue and wisdom.
The five viscera need no filth to cleanse,
But must preserve whole spirit, essence, and *qi*.
Full essence, robust spirit—endure a hundred ages,
Naturally, heart and spirit align.
All learners must unite in intent,
Not in abstinence alone, nor swallowing *qi*.
Swallowing *qi* after fasting—quick ascension,
But ascension demands restraint—great fate depends.
Otherwise, mere longevity extends years,
Longevity’s elixir delays but does not transcend.
Mountain grains refined with water decoction,
Bee’s wax refined a hundred times into pills.
If taken properly, *qi* remains whole,
Fasting allows the form to transcend.

**Yellow Silk Outer Classic, Upper Section**
Garden osmanthus guides the five flavors’ master,
Balancing the five *qi* to generate vital resources.
Repelling filth, dispelling serpentine toxins,
Turning back age—most wondrous for longevity.
Emerging from water, entering fire—rare and strange,
Chewing finely, swallowing saliva while riding swift.
Five clouds converge—most harmonious,
Drinking and pecking naturally cease hunger.
Growing plump without peril, branches and leaves transmit essence.
Winning pure saliva from the Flower Pool,
Adding primal essence to the four limbs.

**Yellow Silk Outer Classic, Middle Section**
Erratic heart-mind—how can it cease?
Dao scriptures and spirit medicines suit this.
Chewing hempseed finely, swallowing it,
Can moisten and dispel the Three Corpses.
No errant thoughts—corpses return not,
Naturally, soul and spirit wander not east or west.
Long practice erases all thought—
Or grind *fu-ling* into paste,
Or crush *mài-fú* for its fat,
To make the spirit swallow the Flower Pool’s essence.
Prevent greed’s saliva from causing calamity,
Guarding elixirs requires careful seeking.
The great elixir’s power must be sustained.

**Yellow Silk Outer Classic, Lower Section**
Without learning abstinence, no ascension.
Within abstinence, *qi* is most refined.
No glutinous rice—no demonic stench,
Natural purity returns to the central court.
Ten years within the heavenly kitchen’s refinement,
Morning and evening, feasts arrive in procession.
Moreover, restraining desire preserves essence,
No craving for the three repugnant or five pungent.
The Supreme’s medicine is in the prior classic,
Further sacrificial rites require meat and blood.
To repel the nine ranks of spirits,
The nine ranks take worm-like form.
Mixing meat with medicine dissolves their shape,
*Fu-ling* and hempseed—two refined essences.
Forming thin porridge at dawn,
One dose per decade—
One dose dissolves the nine ranks like ice.

Yellow Silk says:
Abstinence cannot grant longevity,
But it can refine spirit and attain immortality.
To attain immortality requires virtue’s function,
Function demands years of cultivation—
Thus, elixirs seek longevity,
Abstinence aims for ascension.
Function lies in dual accumulation,
Practice must be complete in both.
Filial piety hides within the heart’s knowing,
Cultivation and refinement perfect conduct.
Without slacking in practice,
A single leap returns to the Azure Sky.

Ascension has its method,
Not in bodily flight.
Flight while bearing the elixir’s decree—
Only then is one a true great immortal.
If only skilled in rising,
This is called the Empty-Walking Immortal.
Riding on pretense or falsehood—
This discerns our true function.

Yellow Silk says:
The true Dao originates from the mind’s intent.
All false perceptions arise from the mind itself.
As with abstinence—
Years pass without hunger.
Seven days without food—
Illness comes, and death follows.
Man can endure years without hunger,
Or perish in seven days.
Life and death differ,
Yet their methods are the same.
Not hungry, not desiring—
This comes from the true and real.
Talismans and spell-water
Also stem from thought and deliberation.
Spirit and *qi* in harmony—
Naturally, they fill and overflow.
Thoughts of death arise from false perception.
Five flavors’ fragrance—
Greed’s saliva overflows.
Spirit disperses, causing hunger and thirst.
Truly, all human action—
Some true, some errant—
Must be approached with caution.
Like

If sweat does not originate from the hand,
then from where does sweat come?
Thus, sweat arises from the mind,
while evil arises from the hand.
Mind and hand in resonance—
naturally, sweat emerges.

Again, the fragrance of fine aromas—
seeing them provokes swallowing.
Filth and impurity in drink—
hearing them provokes vomiting.
Swallowing and vomiting originally arise from the fragrance of fine aromas and filth.
Thus, before tasting fine aromas or filth,
one assumes they do not enter the body,
believing that swallowing and vomiting come from within.
Then fine aromas are not vomited,
and filth is not swallowed—
thus, fine aromas and filth also arise from the mind’s thought.

Since it is known that thought originates from the mind,
one must guard against the mind’s false thoughts.
This is what is meant by thought—
as such.

**The Sacred Scripture of the Yellow Silk, Volume Eight Complete**
**The Sacred Scripture of the Yellow Silk, Volume Nine**

Yellow Silk says:
The Celestial Palace exists within the body—
yet it is not the body itself;
The Underworld exists within the body—
yet it is not the body itself.
The Celestial Palace exists outside—
yet it is not outside;
The Underworld exists outside—
yet it is not outside.
If it is neither within the body nor outside,
then where does it reside?
Ten thousand attachments give rise to thought,
and thought truly originates from the mind.
Arising from the mind, it is as if the scene lies outside.
Just as in a sealed chamber,
where no other things exist,
the flowers outside the chamber
are unseen within.
Yet when one closely contemplates the flowers before them,
the floral scene appears before the eyes.
Thus, the Celestial Palace and Underworld
enter clearly through false perception.

Yellow Silk says:
The desire between male and female
arises from yin and yang.
Within yin and yang,
the distinction of male and female emerges.
A beautiful husband and ugly wife—
though they do not please each other;
A beautiful wife and ugly husband—
it is the same.
The difference between beauty and ugliness
lies in the male and female distinction.
Some find each other pleasing,
others do not—
thus, the desire of male and female
is like beauty and ugliness.
The perception of beauty and ugliness
does not depend on male and female.
Once, a blind man
coupled with an ugly woman,
yet found her as beautiful as a fair one.
Thus, the perception of beauty and ugliness
is like the distinction of male and female.
Therefore, the so-called male and female distinction
is irrelevant.
The mind’s desire for beauty arises from lust,
lust arises from lewdness,
and lewdness’s fluids intermingle,
rooted in false perception.
Controlled by false perception,
the essence is not true—
this is called *Jingming* (Pure Clarity).

Yellow Silk says:
Fluids arise from the mind,
the mind arises from fluids—
the thought of mind and fluids
is where they originate.
The fluids of tears and mucus,
the kinship of flesh and bone.
When the close one dies,
one weeps before seeing them.
When the distant one dies,
one covers their nose and passes by.
Though tears and mucus are one,
proximity and distance lie in the mind.
The mind’s thought generates fluids,
fluids transform into tears and mucus.

Yellow Silk says:
To be steadfast and responsive—
steadfastness is unity.
Responsiveness is thought.
Unity in what is contemplated
is the true and real.
The *qi* within the mind
originates from the formless.
The bone at the crown
is form and thus firm.
The thought of the body’s *qi*
shatters this firm bone.
Bone is black, void within—
bone opens due to *qi*.
*Qi* is formless,
yet thought makes it pass through.
As with false thought,
how could the bone open?
Pressing the crown with the hand,
the crown is already open.
Seizing *qi* with the hand,
*qi* has never existed.
What thought touches
results in the bone’s opening and closing.
When *qi* attacks,
the body’s firmness and *qi*’s completeness—
why could they not be one?
Guiding and drawing *qi* generates *qi*,
*qi* generates essence and fluids,
essence and fluids generate spirit,
thus achieving longevity and clear vision.

Yellow Silk says:
The Heavenly Palace is in the crown—
yet it is not in the crown.
Within the crown is a palace,
named the Heavenly Palace.
The layered towers are in the lungs—
yet they are not in the lungs.
The Mysterious Capital is in the kidneys—
yet it is not in the kidneys.
The Yellow Court is in the spleen—
yet it is not in the spleen.
The Red Suspension is in the heart—
yet it is not in the heart.
The Azure Capital is in the liver—
yet it is not in the liver.
If they are not truly there,
then where do they reside?
Within the five contemplations,
thought truly arises.
The Hidden Heaven is in Heaven,
Heaven within Heaven.
The Concealed Earth is in Earth,
Earth within Earth.
The true forms of Heaven and Earth—
what other forms do they have?
Thus, the true forms of Heaven and Earth
are also generated by thought.
What thought generates
is originally complete and real.
Thus, the mind’s true contemplation
truly contains Heaven and Earth.

Yellow Silk says:
All beings of every kind
have not yet been born.
In the Northern Heaven, there are countless affections and desires,
thus there are Heavenly Palaces and Underworlds.
Egg-born, womb-born, damp-born, and transformed-born—
all arise from lewdness.
One must know that entanglement,
with love as its root.
With all false perceptions,
fostering attachment and affection,
thus the cycle of birth and death ensnares.
Desire arises from love,
life from desire’s attachment.
From desire’s thought,
all adverse and favorable circumstances arise.
Turning away from love,
anger and resentment emerge.
Creating countless evils—
this is the Underworld.
Knowing desire’s repugnance,
abandoning pleasure and fleeing evil,
thinking with goodness—
this is called *Jingming* (Pure Clarity).
Sealing the true mark in the Clear Bright Realm,
one attains the Dao.
All dharmas arise from original desire,
unfolding false perceptions,
thus generating afflictions.
From these afflictions,
one falls into birth and death,
manifesting the prisons of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, there are *Tángdū* demons devouring bodies—
all due to false union,
accumulating karmic offenses.
But if one awakens to *Jingming*,
entering the true mark of the Extreme,
first, one must take the vow,
achieving the Eight Extremes,
obtaining *Jingming*—
this is the true and real,
entering the Great Dao.

Yellow Silk says:
*Sincere loyalty* is the present meaning of *Jingming*.
To die for one’s body is filial piety—
this is *Jingming*’s benevolence.
To achieve a good name and purity—
this is *Jingming*;
To not covet profit or fame—
lawful forbearance is *Jingming*;
To not be rash in anger—
self-restraint is *Jingming*;
To act with reverence and caution—
tolerance is *Jingming*;
To be vast and luminous—
magnanimity is *Jingming*;
To rejoice in one’s portion—
forbearance is *Jingming*.
Hidden in illness,
within *Jingming*, the thought is true.

The thought, when kept pure,
has never failed to attain immortality.
Thus, those with *Jiawei*—
possess an unassailable countenance;
those who weep—
utter sounds that cannot be heard by others;
those who commune with ghosts and spirits in sacrifice—
all arise from this.

Yellow Silk says:
If thought is deemed delusion, who is without thought?
If thoughtlessness is true, who has thought?
If thought is delusion, how do you know?
If it is not, then it is not—it is not existence.
If thoughtlessness is not delusion, how do you know?
If it exists, then it is existence—knowing that non-existence is non-existence.
If non-existence is non-existence, then it is the law of *Jingming*.

A mirror reflects—water becomes that mirror,
and in water, *Jingming* is seen.

Yellow Silk says:
When facing the water’s reflection,
it only shows me—
not my true form—
thus, there is no true mirror.
If water reveals my true eyebrows, eyes, ears, and nose,
how do I know it is true?
You do not see the form—how do you know it is yours?
If you pinch your face with your hand,
the shadow in the mirror, the shadow in the water—
also shows the hand pinching the face.
If others do not pinch, they see no hand.
Thus, the hand is inherently mine, not theirs.
The hand is in me—
thus, this face is truly my face,
knowing the Eight Extremes through hand and face.
If it is in me, it is not the Eight Extremes;
if it is in another, it is not *Jingming*.

Yellow Silk says:
The origin of *Jingming* lies in true nature.
Within nature, there is function,
rooted in true thought.
Within thought, there is delusion—
thus, *Jingming* is lost.
Like a mirror in water,
if dust and filth obscure it,
it cannot reflect objects—
when objects obscure nature,
thought is not true,
and *Jingming* is lost.

**Volume Nine of the *Lingbao Jingming Huangsu* by the Highest Moon Palace, Taoyin Yuanjun, the Daoist King of Filial Piety, concludes.**
**Volume Ten of the *Lingbao Jingming Huangsu* begins.**

Yellow Silk says:
Parents are the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.
The sovereign is the Sun and Moon.
There has never been one who existed before Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon,
yet could act in the world.
Thus, the foundation of filial piety
scatters as loyalty and filiality.
The virtues of loyalty and filiality
are perfected in the Great Dao,
transcending the immortal realm—
thus, their rightness.

A person’s body is like Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth as parents are like Original *Qi*.
The sovereign as Sun and Moon is like the heart and kidneys, ears and eyes.
There has never been one without these who could attain longevity—
it depends on steadfast loyalty and filiality.
Life is the Eight Extremes;
when the Eight Extremes are complete,
like a sturdy beam,
who could topple it?

Yellow Silk says:
*Xin* (faith) is *qi*.
A person’s *qi* flows continuously,
like the four seasons of Heaven—
breathing and pulse numbers—
if disrupted, it becomes illness.
Cold, heat, yin, and rain transform—
then disaster arises.
When a person lacks faith,
disaster and illness emerge.
Thus, beyond the Eight Extremes,
there is also faith.
Yang *qi* sprouts in the Yellow Bell organ—
faith arises within it.

Yellow Silk says:
The *Jing* (essence) of Yellow Silk has inner and outer aspects.
The inner *Jing* is clear and bright,
the outer *Jing* is luminous and transparent,
like a *liuli* (glazed) pearl—
also able to illuminate.
Like ice, clear and pure,
it melts and dissolves.

Yellow Silk says:
Those who know *Móming* (enlightenment)
are like casting a name into a *liuli* bottle—
visible both inside and out.

Yellow Silk says:
To study the Dao broadly,
broadness must be precise.
Once precise, one must know its principles.
Knowing the principles,
focus on what is essential.
Once the essential is grasped,
the Dao becomes easily known.

Yellow Silk says:
All under Heaven converges in unity—
attaining the hundred concerns.
The Dao is attained through unity—
there is no other way.
Like the paths of east, west, south, and north,
converging at the center.
Rivers and lakes,
all flow into the sea.

Yellow Silk says:
True nature is nature;
habit is not nature.
The ten habits are:
1. Lustful habit.
2. Greedy habit.
3. Arrogant habit.
4. Angry habit.
5. Deceitful habit.
6. Fraudulent habit.
7. Resentful habit.
8. Superficial habit.
9. Crooked habit.
10. Litigious habit.
When these ten habits are polished away,
the Dao of *Jingming* emerges.
If thought is impure,
the true is lost.
Losing the true,
true nature is obscured—
thus, *Jingming*’s principles are lost,
giving rise to false perceptions.

Yellow Silk says:
The Dao is originally empty yet real.
What is emptiness?
That which has no foundation is emptiness.
That which has a foundation is reality.
Heaven’s reality is in its height.
Earth’s reality is in its breadth.
Ghosts and spirits’ reality is in their numinousness.
The reality of *Jingming* is in *Jingming*—
thus, *Jingming* is reality.
Beyond true reality,
all else is illusory.
What is illusory?
If one takes intelligence as reality,
the Dao of *Jingming* cannot be founded upon it.
If one takes speech as reality,
the Dao of *Jingming* cannot be founded upon it.
If one takes cleverness and deceit as reality,
the Dao of *Jingming* cannot be founded upon it.
What can be relied upon
is what is practiced in true reality.

Yellow Silk says:
What is *shǒu* (guard)?
To guard in unity.
Unity is unchanging—
only the unchanging can transform endlessly;
one transformation leads to seven,
seven transformations lead to nine,
nine transformations return to unity.

Yellow Silk says:
The Dao is not distant—
it lies in the eyebrows and eyelashes.
The Dao is within—
in the chest and abdomen.

Yellow Silk says:
The Dao values essence,
essence lies in simplicity,
simplicity lies in detail,
detail lies in principles.
Thus, Yellow Silk is the framework of *Jingming*.
Like grasping the collar of a robe
to know the order of the collar and lining.

Yellow Silk says:
The three *Ling* (numinous) scriptures have a unified law.
The essential principle of the Supreme Sovereign
can be expressed in one phrase
to equal the three *Ling* scriptures.
If held steadfastly,
its efficacy is equal.
It can calm concerns and gather *shao* (summon),
concentrate the spirit and nurture the true—
this is essence and detail.

Incantation:
*Om* Sūluónà Sūlūsūshāfúhē.

The learned scholar, like holding a *lunzhū* (wheel-bead),
called the *jièzhū* (precept-bead),
from beginning to end—
the hundred spirits guard and the five *qi* settle,
inner thoughts cut off evil,
outerly welcoming the true—
this is called *Zǒng Xuán* (Total Mystery).

Yellow Silk says:
The *Jingming* (Pure Clarity) defense has a precept:
Hold the *shūzhū* (output-bead) and *lunzhū* (wheel-bead),
never release them without cause.
Maintain the right mindfulness
and return to right thought.
Before seeing the *bǎoyìn* (treasure-seal),
first perceive the *shūzhū*.
The *lunzhū* is boundless—
this is the *Jingming* method,
thus it can equal my mirror-water.
Mirror-water as the seat,
while the *shūzhū* moves and stops in accordance.

Yellow Silk says:
With the mirror reflecting form,
within form there is spirit.
With spirit merging with water,
within water there is the true.
Through prolonged practice,
one can see the numinous spirit
and repel demonic forces.

Yellow Silk says:
The *Yuāngāng* (Primordial Rigidity) flying spirit
must recognize the Dao’s pathways.
The *yángshén* (yang spirit) knowing the path
is how one attends the Primordial and does not err.

Yellow Silk says:
The *Yuāngāng* rigid path—
the *qi* of intersecting *gāng* (rigid lines).
Its firmness is like steel;
practiced long, one treads and ascends to empty space.
But with right thought,
leaping with both shoulders,
the spirit’s transformation comes naturally.

Yellow Silk says:
Heaven and Earth move the true,
the sun and moon move clarity,
the four seasons move sequence,
yin and yang move harmony.
When Heaven issues killing intent,
when Earth issues killing intent,
the sun and moon alternate with the four seasons,
yet the *wǔ* (martial) *yin-yang qi* alternate as dust.

Yellow Silk says:
Fortune and misfortune
are used to admonish the virtuous—
this is *pǐ* (stop).
Regret and hesitation
are used to clarify movement—
this is *zhǐ* (halt).
Disaster and filth
are used to repay the noble—
this is the petty.

Yellow Silk says:
The *língxiǎng* (numinous echoes)
are born from the heart.
When the heart reaches,
the numinous responds.
When the heart does not reach,
none can attain the numinous echoes.

Yellow Silk says:
The sun and moon in the sky—
their essence can be obtained and savored.
Yin and yang, formless—
their *qi* can be obtained and breathed.
Ghosts and spirits, most subtle—
their emotions and forms can be obtained and summoned.
This is the heart reaching,
and the numinous responding.

Yellow Silk says:
The Dao has a beginning and end,
yet its beginning cannot be exhausted.
Only because it cannot be exhausted,
does it begin at the beginning and end at the end.
