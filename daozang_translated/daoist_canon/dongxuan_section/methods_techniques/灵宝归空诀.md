### **Versified Summary**

When the embryo is perfected and the spirit transforms, the hero,
Sheds the body freely, unshackled by fear.
The diligent practitioner, having realized non-arising,
Must remain vigilant in action, undisturbed by chaos.

The superior adept, having completed the elixir and perfected the Dao,
Moves freely in coming and going—my life is mine,
No longer subject to Heaven.
The middling adept and below, though able to progress in the Dao,
At the moment of returning to Emptiness, must first awaken,
Lest they fall into confusion.

### **Signs of the Return to Emptiness**

**The Heavenly Drum at the Crown:**
If the Heavenly Drum at the crown roars like thunder,
This is the sound of Heaven collapsing and Earth crumbling.
Three sounds, two sounds—three or two years;
One sound, one year—so must it be reckoned.

On New Year’s Eve or at midnight each night,
Sit in stillness, gather the mind, and contemplate the crown—
This is called the *Gate of Great Clarity*.
Suddenly, a sound like the brain splitting,
Clear and sharp as a thunderclap, shall be heard.
Count the number of sounds to determine the time remaining.

**The Drum at the Back of the Head:**
Cover both ears with the hands,
And with two fingers, strike the back of the head thirty-six times.
If the sound resembles a drum, peace shall follow;
If like a bell or chime, a year remains;
If like a cicada’s cry, a hundred days;
If like an earthworm’s wriggling, seven days—
Thus is the time of return foretold.

**The Collapse of the Heavenly Pillar:**
If the drum at the back of the head and the Heavenly Drum both fall silent,
The Heavenly Pillar and Kunlun have already toppled.
Before the lamp, raise the left hand to the forehead—
If the arm appears small, it is auspicious; if large, ominous.
The front teeth serve as the *Dharma Drum*;
If striking them yields no sound, all are signs of departure.

**The Fading of Light and Vital Signs:**
In utter darkness, flick the eyes with a finger—
If no light appears above or below, it is called *the Sun and Moon extinguished*,
A sign of impending return.
If the pulse before the ear ceases to move,
It is called *the angler lays down his rod*—a sign of one day remaining.
The pool behind the upper gums is the *Flowery Pond*;
If the fluids dry, it is called *the Cao Creek’s waters exhausted*—
A sign of seven days remaining.
At midnight, burn incense, light a lamp, and bow in worship;
If, upon turning, no shadow appears to either side,
It is called *the shadow no longer follows the form*—
A sign of departure on that very day.

**The Movement of the External Kidneys:**
The left external kidney is called the *Yin Mother*,
The right, the *Yang Duke*.
If the left enters the abdomen and returns, it is a sign of two mornings,
Or, if it remains, a full day.
If the right enters the abdomen and returns, it is a sign of seven nights.
If both enter together, death shall come within half a day.
If, at the moment of departure, they enter again,
It is called *Yin and Yang hastening*, or *the coiled rock*.
Bind them tightly with silk or cotton cord to the thighs,
Preventing their entry, so the corpse does not die.

When the five viscera stir, it is the time of returning to quiescence.
At that moment, consciousness arises from the soles of the feet
And ascends through the crown—
If the corpse moves, compose the mind and face the Heavenly Gate to depart.

**Pain at the Moment of Urination:**
At the moment of urination, if both kidneys contract,
Piercing pain unbearable as a drill—
This is called *the Hell Gate suddenly stirring*.
If the left foot (for men) or right foot (for women) stabs with pain,
It is called *the Life Gate severed*.
Sit upright, steady the spirit, and firmly grasp the *Mind Seal*,
Lest it wander.
Press the hands tightly to the heart, preventing confusion—
When the pain subsides, departure shall come within half a day.

**Sensations Throughout the Body:**
If the entire body feels as though ants are crawling,
Or suddenly as though a serpent slithers,
And these sensations reach the heart,
Causing the joints to ache until one faints—
After three or five such episodes,
It is called *all desires leaving the body*,
Or *the myriad spirits departed*—
Certainly an ill omen.
One must concentrate the spirit and stabilize the mind;
A single errant thought, and one falls into the *karmic paths*—
This must not be taken lightly.

**Final Preparations:**
On the night of departure, after washing the hands, rinsing the mouth,
And donning proper attire,
Burn incense as before and carefully examine the signs.
If two or three portents appear,
Bathe in peach-blossom water, change clothes, and enter the chamber.
Sit in stillness and drink white tea or pure water.
If any other visions suggest departure, yet doubt remains,
Drink one or two more mouthfuls of pure water and compose oneself again.

**Illusory Visions at the Hour of Death:**
All manner of beings and visions may arise,
Luring one into the *karmic paths* to suffer defeat.
Hold fast to the *Mind Seal*, free from attachment,
Like an axe splitting wood—fear not, nor suspect, nor doubt.

At the moment of death:
The eyes transform into the *Nameless Ghost*,
The ears into the *Who-Is-It Ghost*,
The nose into the *Dead Tree Ghost*,
The tongue into the *Swift Soldier Ghost*,
The body into the *Pondering Ghost*,
The heart into the *Male-Female Ghost*.
All ghosts and spirits arise from the mind—
They are not external intrusions.
One must first recognize them as such.

If one encounters visions of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, masters, or sages,
Or processions of attendants beckoning,
These are the realms of *heavenly demons* and *external paths*.

Encountering vengeful foes or kin,
Or paths of yellow, red, or white—
These too are *karmic paths* and demon realms.

Where lamplight glows, the inner demons’ kin appear.
In desolate wilds, the human womb awaits.
Meeting sisters or relatives—
This is the gateway to rebirth, womb or wombless, in the wilds.

Encountering black-and-white carriages with flags and brushes—
The wombs of oxen and horses.
Palaces and halls—
The wombs of swine and sheep.
Yellow-robed or white-clad figures—
The wombs of cats and dogs.
Yellow banners and leopard tails—
The wombs of beasts that run.
Elephants—
The wombs of foxes.
Where flutes are played—
The wombs of earthworms and cicadas.
Where drums and music sound—
The wombs of crows, sparrows, insects, and ants.
Flower-lined streets and willow lanes—
The wombs of serpents.
Markets, gates, and bustling crowds,
Or hues of black, white, blue, or purple—
All are the *animal realm*.

Encountering wine, meat, or feasts—
The *hungry ghost realm*.
Scenting wondrous fragrance—
The womb of heavenly beings.
Meeting parents or kin—
The gods of village shrines, born from the *Six Desire Heavens*.
Gold-armored deities who summon—
The blood-fed gods of human and heavenly realms, great in fortune.

All such visions of gods, men, and phenomena
Are illusions of one’s own consciousness, luring external demons—
They are not the true *Way*.
Do not heedlessly follow or flee;
Neither fear nor doubt, neither grasp nor cling.
A single stray thought—
And you fall into their womb.

At the moment the *qi* severs,
It may feel like an axe’s split—
Do not be alarmed.
In the hour of deepest stillness,
Do not flee or wander.
Firmly grasp the *Mind Seal*,
Unmoving, thus and thus,
And after a long while, you will settle.

Only then will you see:
The path of thunder, fire, and lightning,
The sun’s rays stretching a thousand leagues.
Rush forward with the body, yet the heart remains unmoved—
Thus you will attain the human or heavenly realms and return to the *Pure Land*.
These four visions alone are trustworthy,
Sure to guide you to the *good paths*.

If you meet a yin-being offering tea,
Do not taste the *soul-bewildering* brew.
Should you firmly remember this vision,
You will gain knowledge of past lives, never to forget.

When women offer tea—whether as gift or sale—
To accept and drink is to fall into the *evil paths*.
If you refuse and secretly discard it,
You will in future lives gain knowledge of past existences.

Fourfold assembly of noble ones, students of immortals and Buddhas—
Swift is impermanence; do not take it lightly.
A hundred kalpas of suffering in the *wheel of rebirth*,
The *Six Thieves* and *Three Corpses* rampant on the path of delusion.

The fourfold assembly refers to those in Daoist teachings: male monastic Daoists, female monastic Daoists, male lay Daoists, and female lay Daoists. In Buddhist teachings, monastics are called *bhikṣu* (monks) and *bhikṣuṇī* (nuns), while lay practitioners are called *upāsaka* (male devotees) and *upāsikā* (female devotees). When the Heavenly Worthy and the World-Honored One expounded the Dharma in the past, these four assemblies were always present to listen.

Impermanence refers to the illusory, borrowed form of the body, which cannot escape decay and transience. The *Six Thieves* are the six desires. The true nature is thusness—neither moving nor still—responding to phenomena as they arise. When the eye faculty sees, it covets forms; when the ear faculty hears, it craves sounds; when the nose faculty smells, it desires fragrances; when the tongue faculty speaks or eats, it hankers after flavors; when the body faculty moves, it indulges in improper actions; when the mind faculty devises plans, it clings to deluded dreams. Once these six dusts enter the six faculties, the six desires flare up, obscuring and deluding the true nature—hence the name *thieves*.

When passions run high, essence and spirit congeal into the *Three Corpses*, causing insatiable craving, deluded dreams, and endless wandering through birth and death in the *wheel of rebirth*, suffering without respite. Only with the courage of Guan, Zhang, and Zhao—subduing without even drawing the sword—can the world be pacified and the Way restored. Surrender to the command of the *Great Dharma King of No-Birth*.

The Dharma-body of self-nature is fundamentally unborn and undying. You cannot see its beginning when you seek it, nor its end when you follow it. It shines through past and present, standing alone and unchanging. Yet when it is drowned in the faculties and dusts, it is led into the various destinies, forgetting its original nature. If you can rouse the power of great wisdom and see through the faculties and dusts, passions will vanish instantly, and the Dharma-body will manifest. Though the four elements dissolve, it remains untouched—this is the *Great Dharma King of No-Birth*.

**Postscript**
Once a human form is received, it undergoes formation, dwelling, decay, and dissolution. A hundred years pass like a dream. At the moment of death, consciousness becomes confused, and one drifts into the various destinies according to karmic habits, with no hope of escape. This is what is meant by the swiftness of impermanence and the gravity of birth and death. The method of returning to emptiness has long existed.

This text is traditionally attributed to Chan Master Bodhidharma, but upon examining its style and meaning, I find it riddled with errors and inconsistencies, unlike the language of a Mahāyāna bodhisattva. Moreover, Bodhidharma came from the West without relying on written words—could this not be a later fabrication, falsely attributed to a great name for credibility? Based on the old version and supplemented with other accounts, I have corrected errors, removed redundancies, and distilled the essence into a seven-character verse of fourteen chapters, each with four lines, for ease of memorization. Each chapter is accompanied by annotations for clarity.

Those who encounter this text should treasure and guard it, never carelessly divulging it. Urgently awaken, see through karmic conditions, forget phenomena when facing them, practice skillful means widely, and cultivate good roots. In the twelve hours of the day and the four postures of conduct, uphold precepts and samādhi unwaveringly—neither clinging nor forgetting. With sincere effort and dedicated practice, the original wisdom-nature will one day become clear. Directly take it up, become your own master, and when the time comes, hold fast to the mysterious pass. Test its workings, and when the moment arrives, act without hesitation—this is the true work of a great being. Thus, the method of returning to emptiness is not without benefit.

I have also observed that among immortals and buddhas, some meet unfortunate ends. For instance, Master Guo Jingchun, having awakened to the true and constant Dao, was unjustly executed, and the upright path of loyalty met a violent end. Chan Master Dahui, having realized the treasury of the true Dharma-eye, died from a carbuncle on his back, seeing through the five viscera in agony. Yet in the sea of humanity, some luck out: ignorant men and women, sunk in worldly toil without cultivation, may foresee their death and pass away peacefully. These are all due to past-life fixed karma, each reaping what they sow according to conditions. The common folk, not understanding, often use such cases of peaceful or violent deaths as fodder for gossip, revealing their own lack of wisdom.

Know this: those with clear eyes and lofty natures have already penetrated the celestial mind. Even amid blades and winds, they remain at ease; though poison is administered, their leisurely self-nature and Dharma-body roam beyond the world. If worldly attachments remain unwashed and the Dao-eye is still clouded, when the time of dissolution comes, it will be like a dream within a dream—unaware it is a dream, unable to forget familiar realms, drifting blindly in darkness. In the end, delusion and awakening differ not between saints and ordinary beings.

Only the fourfold assembly of Daoist and Buddhist practitioners—awakening early to the fleeting nature of illusory scenes and the difficulty of escaping the *wheel of suffering*—can together ascend the shore of enlightenment. Is this not excellent?

Thus, I write this preface and offer a verse:

Birth and death, impermanent, are not inherently ours—
Only through clinging do they spawn endless woes.
The method of returning to emptiness is no-method,
Like the sun moving east and west, all is one.
