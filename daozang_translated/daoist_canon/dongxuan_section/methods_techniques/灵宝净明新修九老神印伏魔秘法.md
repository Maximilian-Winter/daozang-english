*The Precious Scripture of the Purified and Luminous Newly Revised Nine Elder Spirit Seals for Subduing Demons*
Compiled by He Shoucheng, Assistant Instructor of the Yi Zhen Altar

The Three Caverns’ true scriptures are treasured by the sagely ranks, concealed within the Upper Palace, bound by precepts and prohibitions. Unless heaven and earth are newly opened, their texts do not emerge. Those who encounter them are always persons of golden names and jade characters, long inscribed in the registers of immortals.

Now, the secret methods of the *Upper Clarity Spirit Seals for Subduing Demons and Refining Form and Spirit* were personally received by the Nine Elder Lords from the Primordial Honored One at the dawn of the Dragon Han kalpa, transmitted to instruct those who study immortality. They constitute the pivotal essence of the *Lingbao* tradition. Since ancient times, those who have succeeded in attaining realization as perfected immortals are too numerous to recount in detail.

Formerly, the Highly Illuminated Great Master Xu, having received the method from the Dao Lord, the Great Immortal Chenmu, served in seclusion during the Eastern Jin, capturing demons and slaying monsters, marking rivers and enchanting waters to alleviate the afflictions and illnesses of the people. Through accumulating merit and virtue, he later ascended his entire family to the celestial realms. Though his disciples followed in succession to become immortals, and those who inherited the method have never been lacking, the texts have been transmitted and practiced for so long that errors have inevitably multiplied, leaving no means of verification.

During the revival of the Great Song, in the year *zuo’e*, the Six Perfected descended in spirit upon the Yu River, revealing the *Lingbao Purified and Luminous Secret Methods*. They transformed the people through the teachings of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and caution, and appointed the Divine Cavern Immortal Minister as the instructor of scholars. Two years later, in the eighth month of autumn, the Highly Illuminated Great Master suddenly manifested at the former site of his traveling tent—now the Jade Dragon Longevity Palace in Jiangxi. Thereupon, he established the immortal altar, naming it *Yi Zhen* ("Winged Perfection"), to welcome those of superior knowledge. All doubts and difficulties regarding the scriptures were to be freely inquired. At that time, newly initiated disciples of the Nine Elder Method requested clarification of the text. Through the true compassion of the immortals, the essentials of the Dao were elucidated, expounding the two chapters on the *Qi Mirror* and the *Spirit Seals*, correcting omissions and errors. Subsequently, he entrusted his disciples to revise all talismans, incantations, and methods. Upon completion, the text was presented for the true inspection of the immortals, who granted their approval. He Shoucheng was then commanded to compose a preface, fully expressing the intent behind the revision to ensure its enduring transmission.

Shoucheng, ashamed of his coarse nature and limited understanding, can offer little to the sacred teachings. Yet, having been graciously accepted by the true master as a disciple of the Lingbao tradition for three years now, I humbly set forth this account at the beginning of the text.

Consider this: when the sands of the Long River converge, within the Five Tombs, eight hundred earthbound immortals are destined to emerge. The master hailed from Yuzhang, a fact recorded in the local annals. Today, even yellow-haired youths and white-haired elders recite it familiarly—surely this is no falsehood.

All who enter the gate of the true master and receive this method should cultivate it with diligence.

Respectfully composed on the Double Ninth Festival of the *xinhai* year of the Shaoxing era.

**General Discourse on the Nine Elder Lords’ Spirit Seals**

Master Danyang said: The Dao is fundamentally *qi*. It coalesces *qi* to form its body and disperses *qi* to enact its function. The Great Dao is the profound obscurity of *qi*, born before heaven and earth, diffused beyond existence and non-existence. Characters are structured by *qi*, texts are composed by *qi*, forms are gathered by *qi*, and sounds are harmonized by *qi*. The Dao is fundamentally *qi*.

The superior adept unites *qi* with the Dao, thus never squandering their *qi*, which abides in oneness. Oneness is the true unity: spirit merges with the heart, the heart interacts with spirit, and spirit is united through *qi*. As the lodestone attracts iron or kingfisher feathers shatter gold, this is the nature of things. When nature unites with the Dao, the Dao is indeed *qi*.

Now, with true essence—essence is oneness, and oneness is the Dao. By virtue of true essence, one summons the correct *qi*; by uniting with the Dao, one becomes a great immortal. The immortal refines essence to unite with *qi*, and *qi* to unite with the Dao. The spirit’s radiance is purified and luminous, unburdened by external things. As the burning mirror faces the sun and fire arises, or the *fangzhu* vessel responds to the moon and water arrives, water is the great *qi* of spontaneity. The Dao unites with spontaneity, attaining the correctness of yin and yang, harmonizing their center. Pure and undispersed, refined and unadulterated, the sun thus possesses radiance, and the moon its brilliance.

Humans, when they embody stillness, attain the fullness of their nature; when they attain clarity, their hearts become penetrating. With nature fulfilled and heart enlightened, they resonate with the palaces of the sun and moon. The Dao is fundamentally round and empty: roundness is the body of *qi*, emptiness is its function. Attaining the Dao of roundness and emptiness is called *purified and luminous*. Purified and luminous, one harmonizes with correctness and attains the center, uniting with the affective.

The supreme Dao is not sought through affect, yet here affect is spoken of. Truly, affect arises from sincerity, and when affect stirs, the Dao naturally emerges. The Dao is *qi*; uniting the heart with *qi*, when the heart moves, affect arises—affect is fundamentally born within. The superior adept studies the Dao without clinging to any single thing, nor abandoning any thing. To say the Dao can be sought through affect is incorrect; it is merely employed as a provisional means.

The Dao does not reside in breathing or absorption; breathing and absorption are external, while the Dao is internal. Since the Dao is internal, it can be known through breathing and absorption, yet this knowing is also external. The Dao pervades the great void, encompassing and unifying all. Grasping the intent of the Dao, one understands that what is called affect makes the *Spirit Seals* readily comprehensible.

The superior adept regards the seal as the Dao, for the Dao is entrusted to the seal to enact it. The seal is like the moxa placed upon the burning mirror. The *Spirit Seals for Subduing Demons*—variant edition of this seal.

**Seal Exegesis**
The Nine Elder Lords of *Upper Clarity* reverse corpses, revive the dead, cure illnesses, subdue demons, and expose transgressions.

**Chapter on the Rectification of Ghosts and Spirits Across the Three Realms**

This talismanic text comprises thirty-five characters, to be carved in standard script upon the reverse side in white relief. The seal may be fashioned from gold, silver, jade, or stone, or from thunder-struck jujube wood or other hardwoods. Its dimensions are as follows: two *cun* and four *fen* in width, corresponding to the twenty-four *qi*; two *cun* and eight *fen* in length, corresponding to the twenty-eight lunar lodges; and one *cun* and two *fen* in thickness, corresponding to the twelve earthly branches. It is to be crafted on the days of the Three Origins and Eight Festivals, or on *jiazi*, *gengshen*, or days governed by the *nayin* of Water or Fire, with the artisan purified and facing east. Upon completion, a petition is submitted to the *Dushi* (Ordination Master) for presentation to the Supreme Mystery Capital. On the night of ordination, the seal is placed upon an altar in the open air, offered with incense, flowers, and consecrated water, and venerated until dawn before being withdrawn. Neither fowl nor dog nor layperson may witness this. After three such nights of veneration, the seal may be employed.

**Method for Receiving and Maintaining the Seal**
Each day at dawn, burn incense, form the Mudrā of the Day Lord, and gaze upon the seal while reciting:
*"Successor of the Dharma, so-and-so, respectfully offers this incense to the divine spirits and guardian officials of the Heavenly Seal, proclaiming: When the Primal Beginning unfolded its chart, it arose from the East. The Nine Qi Sovereign Lords obtained this divine seal. With vermilion script and jade characters, heaven and earth are pacified. Concealed tones and inner names serve as the talismanic signs for ghosts and spirits. I bear this seal and execute the Mandate of Heaven. It guards my person, aids others, subdues demons, and rectifies the perverse. Wherever I go, none may obstruct; all responses follow my invocation."*
Then, facing east, draw in the *qi* of the sun and blow it into the seal before releasing the Mudrā.

**Method for Using the Seal**
When administering aid, first burn incense and, according to the petitioner’s circumstances, invoke the Nine Elder Lords of *Upper Clarity* and all divine spirits of the Dharma, entreating their salvific protection. When imprinting, hold the Mudrā with the left hand, bending the middle finger to press the center of the palm. With the right hand, grasp the seal and visualize it transforming into the bodies of the Nine Elder Lords, clad in the regalia of *Upper Clarity*, flanked by their attending officials. Then, facing east, draw in the true *qi* of the sun and blow it onto the imprinted characters. If the seal is used exclusively for healing, inscribe the characters *"Seal Arrives—Swift Peace"* upon it. After affixing the signature, draw in the sun’s true *qi* once more, blow it onto the seal, release the Mudrā, and visualize the divine generals following the seal to its destination.

**Method for Dispatching the Seal**
To expel malevolent spirits or suppress demonic influences, imprint the petitioner’s condition in the usual manner and command the local Controller of Destiny and Earth God to execute the decree by burning the document. To dispel malevolent entities, inscribe the matter, imprint it, and affix it to the site for pacification. For injuries or fractures, apply the imprint to the afflicted area. For seasonal epidemics or malarial fevers, affix it to the front and back of the heart. For sores, ulcers, or abscesses, burn the imprint to ash and apply it as a salve or wash. For possession, nightmares, or demonic assaults, wear the imprint or ingest it. For eye ailments, steep the imprint in pure water and use it to wash the eyes. In each case, healing and peace will be attained.

**Seal Design**

The right seal may be carved from any wood. Once completed, submit it alongside the previous seal. When the master encounters an *shen* day, use this seal on memorials and official documents, both for superior and subordinate communications. When employing the seal, form the Big Dipper mudra.

**Daily Cultivation Method**
**Upper Prime: Yellow Court True Talisman for Dispelling Impurities**
Inscribe this talisman in cinnabar. Each morning at dawn, face east, form the *wu* mudra, recite the incantation, and swallow one talisman with pure water to dispel impurities, purify the body, and gather vital *qi*.

**Incantation:**
The Five Thearchs command the demonic legions,
Iron blades strike front—demon kings submit.
Four fierce steeds spread forth, safeguarding life and root.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Nine Elder Thearchs of Supreme Purity.

**Daily Cultivation Method**
**Upper Prime: True Talisman for Guarding the One and Prolonging Life**
Inscribe this talisman in cinnabar. Each day at noon, face east, form the *zi* mudra, recite the incantation, and swallow one talisman with pure water to pacify the spirit, guard the One, protect life, and prolong existence.

**Incantation:**
Prolonging life and augmenting destiny, revered spirits transcend calamity,
Reviving the dead from their skeletal frames, immeasurably delivering beings.
Holding registers and grasping ledgers, all ascend before the Thearch.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Nine Elder Thearchs of Supreme Purity.

**The Mirror of Pure Bright *Qi***
Master Danyang said: *Qi* is emptiness that responds with efficacy; it is the marshal of spirit and the master of the body. Heaven possesses *qi*, thus it arches high and vast, and by its height, it descends to nourish below. Earth possesses *qi*, thus it is thick and expansive, and by its depth, it ascends to interact above. The sun, moon, and stars possess *qi*, thus they are luminous and shine upon the world. Rivers, seas, mountains, and peaks possess *qi*, thus they coalesce and take form. Humans possess *qi*: the head is round, modeling heaven’s *qi*; the feet are square, modeling earth’s *qi*. The eyes and hair emulate the sun, moon, and stars; the pores and hair resemble mountains, rivers, and seas. The circulation of this single *qi*—yin and yang, odd and even—flows in communion with heaven and earth. Heaven and earth endure because their *qi* circulates without obstruction. Yet humans often die prematurely—why? It is merely a matter of whether one can or cannot employ *qi*. Thus, the movement and concealment of *qi* follow a principle, called *pure brightness*. When *qi* is pure and bright, it fills and completes; when filled and complete, it pervades all, reaching the essence of destiny. This is the subtle principle of heaven and earth, the interplay of yin and yang, the timing of ascent and descent, and the generation of beings. Within the human body, one may emulate heaven above and earth below, drawing the upright *qi* of heaven and earth to harmonize with the self. Through this, one may transform essence, alter fate, and traverse life and death, thereby attaining numinous efficacy—this is called *inner refinement*. With inner refinement, the elixir crucible forms, the yellow sprout arises, and auspicious clouds flourish. One may then exhale wind and clouds, sneeze forth thunder, command summer and winter, summon autumn and spring, transform sunlight into rain, and rain into prolonged showers. The upright *qi* of heaven and earth resides within me, not in others. The dead may be revived; the living may be extinguished. When the human Dao is upright, perverse *qi* that invades will be pacified by my *qi*. When the demonic Dao is perverse and oppresses humanity, it will be subdued by the *qi* of my Dao. Those who study the Dao and attain this are said to possess the *qi* mirror’s secret. The method of circulating and nourishing *qi* must grasp its mechanism. To grasp its mechanism, one must understand its discourse.

**Daily *Qi*-Ingestion Method**
Each morning, face east, burn incense, form the Solar Lord mudra with both hands, and click the teeth nine times. Visualize the Nine Elder Thearchs and the Solar Supreme Thearch within the solar orb. The sun’s hue is purple-red, its nine rays of rosy light illuminating the vast sky like the dawn. Release the mudra, clasp the hands, and bow while reciting the prayer:

*Disciple of the lineage [Name], burns incense and offers it to the Nine Elder Thearchs and the Solar Supreme Thearch. At this dawn hour, I burn incense, purify my heart, and cleanse my intent. I pay homage to the Solar Palace, ingesting and absorbing the upright *qi*. I humbly beseech the Solar Supreme Thearch to bestow radiant light, dispelling all darkness and stagnation, nurturing the upright and true, and sweeping away perverse impurities. May the hundred spirits be pacified, the myriad demons retreat, my ears hear clearly, my eyes see brightly, my heart attain communion, and my nature gain wisdom. May I unite with the Dao and attain longevity and enduring vision.*

Click the teeth three more times, visualize the sun’s purple-red light illuminating your face, then inhale through the nose and swallow, as described below for ingesting the four *qi*, totaling thirty-six breaths.

**First *Qi* Incantation:**
Centered within the five *qi*, harmonizing the hundred spirits.
When ingesting the first *qi*, let both hands hang naturally, form the mudra for the affliction, and recite the incantation seven times. Release the left-hand mudra, switch to the throat mudra, clasp the waist, inhale one breath, and swallow. With the breath, reform the mudra, recite the incantation seven more times, release the right-hand mudra, switch to the throat mudra, clasp the waist, inhale one breath, and swallow. With the dark *qi*, reform the mudra, then raise both hands, crossing the throat mudras before the mouth—left hand above, right hand below. Recite the incantation seven more times, open the mouth, inhale one breath, and blow onto the mudra before releasing it. This completes one cycle. Perform this three times, ingesting a total of nine breaths of *qi*.

**Second *Qi* Incantation:**
Noble Lord Yuan Ying, Venerable White Prime,
Great One Controller of Destiny, Peach and Plum unite to prolong life.
When ingesting the second *qi*, let both hands hang naturally, form the Northern Asterism mudra, and recite the incantation. Inhale *qi* as in the first *qi* method, only changing the mudra’s name. Perform three cycles, ingesting a total of nine breaths of *qi*.

**Third *Qi* Incantation:**
Eastward, expel demonic essences,
Sever the blades of the six ghosts.
The *qi* of all heavens surges—
My Dao daily ascends in glory.
When ingesting the third *qi*, let both hands hang naturally, form the Purple Court mudra, and recite the incantation. Inhale *qi* as in the first *qi* method, only changing the mudra’s name. Perform three cycles, ingesting a total of nine breaths of *qi*.

**Fourth *Qi* Incantation:**
Demons dare not trespass,
Ghosts and malevolent spirits vanish.
The Three Officials of Mount Fengdu,
Inspect the demonic encampments.

When ingesting the fourth *qi*, let both hands hang naturally, form the Solar Lord mudra, and recite the incantation. Inhale *qi* as in the first *qi* method, only changing the mudra’s name. Perform three cycles, ingesting a total of nine breaths of *qi*.

The mudra’s name: Palm Circle.
