---

Disciple Fang Wen, bowing deeply to the Perfected Master, ventures to inquire about several matters in the *Yellow Plain Scripture*, humbly beseeching the Jade Decree to reveal the root and source with luminous instruction.

The Scripture states: *"The five qi converge at the Origin; the three yang gather at the crown."*

Fang Wen observes that the Perfected Immortal Zhongli and the Perfected Immortal Lü, in their *Anthology on the Transmission of the Dao*, speak of refining the Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar, saying: *"The five qi converge at the Origin; the three flowers gather at the crown."* The five qi are inseparable from the Five Phases—or perhaps the five viscera. Here it is called the "three yang," while there it is called the "three flowers." Yang is also qi. Moreover, at birth, all yang in a person gathers at the head, and the qi of the five viscera naturally ascends to the Mud Pill Palace. Thus, the eyes can see, the ears can hear, the nose can smell, and the tongue can taste. Yet in the refinement of the Golden Elixir, it is said: *"The five qi converge at the Origin; the three flowers gather at the crown."* I fear there may be a distinct transformation at work. I humbly beg for clear instruction.

The five qi are the qi of the five viscera, which unite and ascend to the Origin Palace. The Origin Palace refers to the Lower Elixir Field. When the Lower Elixir Field is firmly guarded, one may then ascend to the Middle Elixir Field. Having ascended to the Middle Elixir Field, one then converges at the Upper Elixir Field—this is called the "three yang." The "flower" is another name for the three yang. This is the movement of the primordial yang, which condenses into five and operates as three. At such a time, the Elixir is already formed. Auspicious clouds arise at the crown gate, and the qi of the crown opens, bright as the sun and moon. The ears hearing and the nose smelling are not mere convergence but true gathering.

The Scripture states: *"One should contemplate: from whence does this body arise?"*

Fang Wen reflects: People of this world do not know why they die. The origin of the body lies in the union of the two halves of the one qi of Heaven and Earth, the qi of father and mother—the very beginning of creation. Knowing that we arise from this, we should cultivate from this root, thereby aligning with the investigation of creation’s origin. If one cultivates from solitary yin alone, it does not accord with the intent. I humbly beseech the secret transmission of luminous instruction.

At the inception of human life, there is fundamentally the One. The One and speech become two—this is the discourse of the One and Two. The One and Two transform each other, giving rise to true Water and true Fire, wherein spirit and essence are complete. Once true Water and true Fire are recognized, one can then know from whence one comes.

The Scripture states: *"When the sun and moon are misaligned, success cannot be achieved."*

Fang Wen carefully examines the *Elixir Scriptures*, which all take the celestial bodies of the sun and moon as their model—this is the true Dharma-image. If one can emulate the sun and moon, one can seize the transformative workings of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. Yet why does misalignment prevent success? The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* states: *"The sun and moon intermingle, holding the yang’s male banner. Yin bestows yin, and the female transforms into yellow hue."* It also says: *"The slightest deviation brings regret and misfortune, becoming a thief to yin."* The *Perfected Lord’s Elixir Scripture* says: *"There is a time for gathering, a season for harvesting."* And the poem by Perfected Master Zhang says: *"Even a hair’s deviation will fail to produce the Elixir."* How, then, does deviation occur? What method ensures no misalignment? This pertains to the fire-phase. I humbly beseech the oral transmission of the esoteric method.

The images of the sun and moon originate in spirit and essence. The generation of spirit and essence resides in the One and Two. The One and Two are the correct numbers of the fire-phase. Water and Fire have the functions of withdrawal and addition. Thus, one selects the month within the year, the day within the month, and the hour within the day—thereby avoiding misalignment. This principle is recorded in the fire-phase.

The Scripture states: *"Discern Water and Fire; unite Dragon and Tiger; clarify the Elixir Medicine; comprehend Lead and Mercury; master withdrawal and addition; revolve the River Chariot."*

Fang Wen has exhaustively studied the *Elixir Scriptures*, which do not depart from yin and yang yet generate myriad names—dozens of terms such as Water and Fire, Dragon and Tiger, Lead and Mercury, River Chariot, all referring to the same thing. Yet here it says: *"Discern Water and Fire; unite Dragon and Tiger; clarify the Elixir Medicine; comprehend Lead and Mercury; revolve the River Chariot."* Why? If one recognizes Water and Fire, one recognizes Dragon and Tiger. If one recognizes Dragon and Tiger, one recognizes Lead and Mercury—this is the very material of the Elixir Medicine. Why then speak of "discerning," "uniting," "clarifying," "comprehending," and "revolving"? As for the numbers of withdrawal and addition, they pertain to the fire-phase. If one does not recognize the medicinal materials, how can one master withdrawal and addition? I humbly beseech instruction on the essentials, that they may not conflict, so as to facilitate ease of understanding for later learners.

Water and Fire refer to nature, hence "discern." This is before their application. Dragon and Tiger refer to emotion, hence "unite"—this is their application. Lead and Mercury refer to their form, so one may know them as the material of the Medicine—thus "comprehend." Mastering withdrawal and addition enables one to revolve the River Chariot.

The Scripture states: *"By using the hun to control the po, one knows the arising and setting of the sun and moon."*

The arising and setting of the sun and moon are the Dao of Heaven, the ultimate numbers of yin and yang. The hun and po are the spirits of humans, by which one may know these. Yet why must one use the hun to control the po before one can know them? This refers to the two kidneys. The right is the Gate of Life, belonging to yang—this is the hun. Yin is on the right, yang on the left, yet here it is on the right—this is the meaning of controlling the po. The qi of the right kidney ascends to the left eye at midnight. The qi of the left kidney arises in the right eye at noon. Thus one knows the arising and setting of the sun and moon. The hours of *zi* and *wu* are the ultimate numbers of the sun and moon’s generative qi.

The Scripture states: *"When the qi of the Heart and Kidneys interact, this is called true Water and true Fire."*

The Heart and Kidneys are Kan and Li, Water and Fire—every person possesses them. Yet the *Elixir Scriptures* speak of gathering at a certain day and harvesting at a certain time, not in the Heart and Kidneys. Zhang Yifu’s *Elixir Scripture* even says: *"It is delusory to point to the Heart and Kidneys as Kan and Li."* Why, then, does this text speak of true Water and true Fire?

When the Heart and Kidneys interact, only then can one speak of the true. Without interaction, they cannot become true. For only through interaction can the child be born. The Scripture states: *"The dragon is the Heart; the tiger is the Kidneys."* The qi of the Kidneys is easily depleted, while the fluid of the Heart is difficult to accumulate—this hinges on knowing the time of their union. The method of gathering and harvesting involves generating Water within Fire and Fire within Water, for the art lies in inversion. The tiger and dragon are but alternate names for Water and Fire.

It is also said: *"The dragon is Wood; the tiger is Metal."* If they belong to Metal and Wood, why then is the Heart called the dragon and the Kidneys the tiger? Why is the qi of the Kidneys easily depleted, while the fluid of the Heart is difficult to accumulate? The time of their union is the moment for inner work—when dragon and tiger unite, the qi of the sun and moon converge. The qi of the Heart and Kidneys naturally interact at specific times. But what does one gather and harvest? From what does one gather? Is the gathered substance visible or invisible? Can it be named or not?

Generating Water within Fire and Fire within Water is indeed an inversion. Yet how, within the human body, can one readily generate Water within Fire and Fire within Water? I humbly request detailed instruction. These words and the previous explanation are mutually illuminating.

Fire is born of Wood, and Metal is born of Water—just as the child follows the father to attain true nature. Yet if Fire and Water remain uncrossed and unchanged, they cannot be of use. This is the supreme art of generating Water within Fire and Fire within Water. When Fire is employed, Water can be generated—this is the oral instruction not to be committed to paper.

The Scripture states: *"The inner elixir’s medicinal ingredients arise from the Heart and Kidneys, which all people possess."* The numinous embryo is born of true qi, just as dragons have pearls and cattle have *huang*, originating from the yellow sprout to form the inner elixir. Yet according to Fangwen’s examination of the *Elixir Scriptures* and the writings of the perfected in the *Ancient Records of Cultivation*, the medicinal ingredients do not lie between the Heart and Kidneys. If they did, then all people could form the numinous embryo. Solitary yin and orphaned yang cannot complete the work of creation. By what Dao does the dragon possess its pearl? Through what cultivation does the ox acquire its *huang*?

As for the yellow sprout—what is it? Can it be seen? Why is it called the yellow sprout? The yellow sprout is the great beginning of the elixir. Once obtained, one must then proceed with the fire phases of refinement before the inner elixir can be completed. By what method does the yellow sprout arise? If the medicinal ingredients are not in the Heart and Kidneys, where then do they return? The function of the Heart and Kidneys has its own root.

The dragon does not listen with its ears but with its mouth, excelling in inner vision. The ox can churn its throat, yet humans cannot. Thus, the medicinal substances of the Heart and Kidneys cannot become true. The Scripture states: *"Unite dragon and tiger, discern the elixir medicine. Within cinnabar lies mercury; within lead lies silver. When lead and mercury combine, refinement naturally succeeds."*

Yet before discerning the elixir medicine, how can one unite dragon and tiger? The dragon and tiger *are* the elixir medicine—only by discerning the medicine can one cause the dragon and tiger to unite. *"Within cinnabar lies mercury; within lead lies silver"*—this is the elixir medicine, though it is not ordinary mercury. The Scripture says: *"Ordinary mercury and ordinary lead are not worth the effort."* This is precisely the reason.

As for *"warm refinement,"* this refers to the fire phases. Yet how does one apply the fire phases? The texts do not explain—only speaking of refinement, but not how to apply the fire. I earnestly request detailed instruction. This is the matter of the fire phases, as well as the principle of the *hun* controlling the *po*. To know how the *hun* controls the *po* is to perceive the fire phases. The fire phases can be measured in hours instead of months, in moments instead of days, and need not require years of gathering.

The Scripture states: *"The method of withdrawing and adding lead and mercury must grasp the mechanism of Heaven and Earth."* Generally, withdrawal and addition occur only after the medicine is obtained in the crucible. Withdrawal and addition refer to the fire phases. To grasp the mechanism of Heaven and Earth is to align with the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. The Scripture says: *"Though a thousand texts and ten thousand discourses expound the truth, none commit the fire phases to writing. To know the oral instructions that penetrate the mysteries, one must discuss them in detail with the immortals."*

Since ancient times, the fire phases have not been transmitted in writing. I humbly beseech a dream transmission of the oral instructions or direct instruction from the perfected. Though Fangwen has already gained some understanding, I fear it may not be authentic. When it comes to inner work, discrepancies may arise. How fortunate I am to have encountered this opportunity today—I reverently knock and request correction of my learning. I would be most grateful.

Fangwen presents his inquiry: The method of severance includes the fire phases, which should be transmitted face-to-face. Fangwen has observed that the true master, in former days at Yuzhang, composed poems in harmony with the immortals, saying:

*"At the tip of the blade’s two horns,
The flying golden elixir descends.
Wait for the mid-autumn eighth month—
Take special note, lest you forget."*

And again:

*"At the tip of the blade,
Two horns give birth to the golden elixir,
Which forms at the very top."*

These all refer to the supreme great elixir. Though Fangwen has already gained some understanding, he does not know whether it is correct. I humbly request the true master’s past cultivation practices for instruction.

Fangwen has observed the true master’s practice of the *"three-five flying steps"*—is this not the hidden script? Does the Supreme Micro Emperor guard the Celestial Flower, presiding over the extended term and storing the primordial auxiliary? Fangwen has witnessed this practice and humbly requests annotation.

Fangwen has also observed the true master’s attainment of the *"divine method of the lower meaning"*—is this not the oral essentials of Lord Lao, the affairs of the Six Ding Jade Maidens? I respectfully request annotation.

Fangwen presents his inquiry: This is the method of severance in elixir refinement. Later generations, relying on their cleverness, have fabricated false and erroneous teachings, misleading later students so that they ultimately fail to succeed. They do not understand that *"the tip of the blade"* refers to gold within Water, and *"the two horns"* to Wood within Fire. Only by Wood entering Fire can Water boil. *"The mid-autumn eighth month"* refers to the number fifteen.

Fifteen is the number of the *Hetu*. The eighth month corresponds to Metal. The theory of "drawing the Spleen" does not directly refer to the fifteenth day of the eighth month. The "three-five flying steps" does not speak of three-six or four-five, but of three-five—the Star of the Perfected. The Star of the Perfected means emptying the self to employ the One, preserving the body as a Perfected One, and guarding the completion of the three-threes. The Star of the Perfected is the third star. Only by preserving the Perfected can one attain transformation—this is not the oral essentials of Lord Lao or the affairs of the Six Ding Jade Maidens.

As for Ding Yi: This refers to one person. The art of the Golden Elixir is commonly spoken of as not bearing the surname Ding and given name Yi, but rather concealing the name as Ding Yi. Ding is Fire; Yi is also Fire. This is Fire within Fire, uniting true Fire with ordinary fire—this is precisely the method of fire timing. It has never been transmitted to others and should be separately demonstrated.

Fangwen has observed the True Master’s revival of the *Lingbao Jingming* teachings. Within the *Scripture of Salvation*, the wondrous Dao of *Lingbao* contains many doctrines. Fangwen has explored one or two of its mysteries and humbly requests that the True Master expound the *Scripture of Salvation* in full, establishing it as the foundation of all teachings. The practice of talismanic methods lies in accumulating merit through repeated effort.

Fangwen has also observed that the *Scripture of the Nine Elder Lords on Reviving the Dead* originates from the *Authentic Scripture of Salvation* and belongs to the *Lingbao* tradition. He respectfully beseeches the True Master to bestow the authentic text to instruct those at the altar.

Fangwen presents his inquiry: The *Scripture of Salvation* was first transmitted by the Most High to the Lord of the Dao, who then passed it to me. I have not fully grasped its wonders, so the Lord of the Dao directly pointed to the *Jingming* teachings as the throat and collar of salvation. Like the primordial net, it is supremely wondrous—diligent practice, not extensive reading, is key. As the saying goes: "One strike opens the three gates, straight to the ninefold thoroughfare." Do you understand?

It speaks of the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, and the Three-Nines—these are its essential mysteries, which you may not yet know. What is the Three-Nines? It is the number twelve. Setting aside three to make nine yields the Nine Cauldrons; preserving three as three yields the Three Passes. This is the true method of the Three Ones. One generates three, two generates four—this is the function of Metal and Wood.

Formerly, the *Scripture of Reviving the Dead* was a technique of the *Lingbao* teachings for salvation. Now, the authentic text is corrupted beyond recognition. Those who take liberties with it have altered it, so the *Qi Mirror* chapter has misled many. Recently, the *Affair of the Elixir Well* was composed, but its timing remains undetermined. This scripture will require several more days before it can be revealed and ultimately transmitted.

Fangwen: *"The Crimson Golden Elixir forms in a day—*
*This ancient immortal’s words are worth heeding.*
*If one speaks of nine years or three,*
*It is all but procrastination and delay."*

It also says: *"In but a moment’s effort,*
*Eternal ease and joy are secured."*
I do not know what method could be so swift. It further states: *"Mercury cast into lead, lead cast into mercury—*
*Thus transformation is achieved in but a moment."*
And: *"True lead is the gold within mercury."*
An ancient immortal’s poem says: *"The world does not recognize the gold within water."*
It continues: *"Those who know are true immortals."*
Thus, a single speck of true gold makes one an immortal.

Master Lü’s poem says: *"Seize the essence of Metal to establish the foundation of life."*
And: *"You must refine true lead with Jia and Geng,*
*Fire draws the crimson phoenix marrow from the south,*
*Water seeks the black turtle essence from the northern sea."*
Here we see that Water and Fire are indeed Water and Fire, and Water and Fire reside in the Heart and Kidneys. True lead is indeed true lead, not the Water and Fire of the Heart and Kidneys. Refining this true lead is the Great Dao.

I hope the True Master, in his compassion, will not conceal it but clearly and secretly reveal it. Fangwen presents his inquiry.

Within a single day, one may absorb the *qi* of the Yellow Simplicity—eighty-one measures in all. What is the eighty-one? It is the total *qi* of the nine nines of Yellow Simplicity. If you wish to know how to refine the turbid and retain the pure, the work lies in leaving the turbid and keeping the pure. There is no other task—it can be accomplished in an instant.

Mercury cast into lead, lead cast into mercury—this is the method of transformation. Heart joins with Kidneys, Kidneys join with Heart, and the two *qi* mutually merge. It does not depart from the One and Two of Metal: the child within lead. Know the mother, and you will recognize the child.

This is the *qi* of the left Kidney ascending to the Liver, reaching the Lungs, and entering the crown, then returning from the crown to the center. As the saying goes: *"Above and below, fivefold division—*
*The total qi ascends to the Mysterious."*
From this, we know that the gold of true lead is the meaning of Jia and Geng.

Fangwen received the *Five-Thunder Divine Method* from the True Master, who encountered it at Mount Hua in the Jade Grotto from the Perfected Lord Wang Ling’an. Now, only the five talismanic scripts remain; the rest—the ritual methods for the four directions, the *Red Goose* talismans, and related oral instructions—are incomplete and may not be authentic. I further beseech the True Master to specially bestow and reveal them. Fangwen presents his inquiry.

The present *Orthodox One Five-Thunder Method* is far superior, and the former efforts were in vain. The other day, the True Master supervised the *Five Thunders* transmission—this is its essence.

Since the *guiyou* year, when Fangwen was but twenty, he met a Daoist Li from western Shu who spoke of mercury and sought its method of extraction. In the *gengzi* year, he encountered a Daoist Chen from the Eastern Capital, who transmitted to Fangwen the *Elixir Scripture* on lead and mercury. In the *guimao* year, he met Master Wang from the Hebei region and a Daoist Shu from the capital, and he paid respects to the scholar Wang of his hometown to study the *Can Tong Qi*’s elixir furnace, lead, mercury, and fire timing. Last year, while serving as an official in Chongren, he met a senior disciple of Master Wang of Jiangzhou, who transmitted the method of the Fire Elixir in great detail. He has already reported this to the Most High, formed a bond with fellow elixir companions, and discussed fire timing in meticulous detail. Since fire timing is not established in writing, it is preserved only in oral instructions.

Now, I humbly report to the True Master to discern the right from the wrong, that Fangwen may proceed without doubt. I intend to commence the work in the *gengxu* year to accomplish the Great Medicine, and I earnestly hope the True Master will assist and instruct me.

Fangwen now silently inquires about the matter of fire timing and seeks a detailed response.

Fangwen respectfully submits:
Without entering the gate, one wanders lost among many divergent paths. The matter is not extraordinary, yet I dare not speak of it in full. Take, for instance, the method of extraction—one must ask: what medicine is to be gathered? Is it visible or invisible? Audible or inaudible? Some require neither sight nor sound, while others demand one or the other—all hinges on a single principle or two.

As for the method of fire timing, it pertains to the fire timing of the celestial cycle. The secret of refining form alone is insufficient to complete the Golden Elixir. To achieve the Elixir, one must distinguish the fire timing within the Elixir itself, and the technique of application also exists. To know the affairs of the heart, one must seek them in the kidneys. Within the kidneys lies true fire, and the lead tripod gives birth to golden liquid.

What does it mean for the lead tripod to give birth to golden liquid? Wood gives birth to fire, metal gives birth to water. Water and fire are the functions of husband and wife; metal and wood, the functions of father and son. Only with father and son can there be a household. What is a household? It is the Elixir within the spleen.

Yet to seek husband and wife, they must be able to overcome one another. Without overcoming, there can be no governance; without governance, there can be no generation. To know this technique, it rests upon one or two principles. Reflect deeply upon these one or two principles.

For now, let us discuss this single aspect. If there is anything not yet understood, do not hesitate to clarify.

Fangwen respectfully inquires on the following points:
1. In the sword technique, how does one determine the day when metal and wood overcome one another? Thereafter, should one contemplate it daily—yet at what time? Or is there no fixed occasion?

Should one contemplate only on the days when metal and fire interact—what of the nights? Secondly, on the day when metal and water generate one another, one begins forging. Yet if forging daily, is there a fixed time, or none? And what of the nights? Thirdly, how does one nurture for a full year? Fourthly, how does one grind the sword? Fifthly, on the day when metal and water generate one another through water, what is the method? Lastly, the oral instructions at the end of the technique speak of heart-transmission.

The overcoming and generation of one another are called the days when stems and branches mutually generate or overcome. Heart-transmission is the hidden technique. Its application follows the master’s guidance—it is a secret art.

Fangwen practices the Eight Hidden Arts of the Dao of the Cinnabar Landscape, yet within them, the true names and hidden titles of the Jade Emperor Dao Lord differ, and the celestial script remains unrecognized. The following questions are posed:

1. The true names of the Jade Emperor in the Eight Palaces:
   - Gen Palace: Great Vessel
   - Zhen Palace: Dark and Remote (or Dark and Desolate)
   - Xun Palace: Without Heroism
   - Li Palace: Earl Shi
   - Kun Palace: Moving Pearl
   - Dui Palace: Two Principles (or Two Polarities)
   - Qian Palace: Primordial Assistant
   - Kan Palace: Yin Essence

2. The Purple Clarity Emperor Lord:
   - Pronounced *Ming*
   - Pronounced *Ting*
   - Pronounced *Ling*

Though the actual names differ, the Eight Palaces all refer to the hidden titles of the Jade Emperor of the Northern Dipper. Each is employed according to its position, just as metal in stone is ore, yet when smelted, becomes elixir.

Fangwen further inquires: Is there a swift method to summon the Jade Maidens? The names of the Six Ding Jade Maidens and their talismans vary greatly—guidance is sought.

The methods of the Jade Maidens all derive from a single source, yet sincerity makes them easier to invoke. Among the unerring methods of today, none surpass *The White Ape Classic*.

The secret oral instructions on the esoteric meanings of the *Yellow Register of the Numinous Treasure Pure Clarity* are now complete.
