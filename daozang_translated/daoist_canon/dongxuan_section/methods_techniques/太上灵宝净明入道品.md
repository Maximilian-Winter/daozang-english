*The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture on Entering the Dao through Purity and Brightness*

The Supreme Numinous Treasure Purity and Brightness Secret Sanctuary resides west of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Supreme Clarity Mystic Metropolis in the Upper Clarity Heaven. It is the sanctuary where the Dao Lord practices the Daoist rites, unifying the methods of the Three Luminaries to harmonize Heaven and Earth, serve ruler and kin, command spirits and gods, deliver beings, and expel demonic forces.

Those who receive this teaching style themselves as "Disciples of Loyalty and Filial Piety of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Registers." They preside over the Purity and Brightness Secret Sanctuary, jointly administering its ritual affairs. Those of profound merit and distant service are addressed accordingly herein.

One must practice with utmost sincerity, adhering to three principles: first, filial piety and fraternal duty; second, refining the body; third, delivering beings. Daily, one burns incense and performs morning rites, prostrating to the myriad heavens to accumulate blessings and longevity for the king and parents. Next, for all sentient beings, one summons the divine spirits in proper order—consulting them when matters arise, dismissing them swiftly when none.

Within the bounds of the heart, one must always uphold uprightness, filial piety, and friendliness, never indulging in licentiousness, flattery, deceit, or contempt for the Dao and its methods. To avert future transgressions, keep a small ledger, daily recording one’s deeds. If deceit lurks in the heart, it will remain unrecorded. Upon discovering such faults, correct them at once, and the methods will naturally prove efficacious. Should one violate these precepts, calamity will swiftly follow. By adhering to this path, distant merit and proper investiture will elevate one beyond the mortal dust. Celestial scriptures and secret methods will suddenly arrive—ask the disciple: can you practice thus?

Those who receive the Purity and Brightness method must hold themselves in awe, daily revering their sovereign, honoring their six relations with filial piety, enduring hardship in cultivation, and diligently aiding and delivering others. Within the heart, one should feel as though bearing an unrepayable debt, yet strive to repay it. Thus, the voice softens, the breath calms, and anger dissipates—this is the essence of Purity and Brightness. In one’s dwelling, keep a mirror and a basin of water to understand the intent behind this method.

All who receive the Purity and Brightness method are recorded by the Celestial Emperor and entrusted with no light duty. Their transgressions are erased in the Northern Bureau, their names inscribed in the Southern Palace. Twelve officials stand before them, twelve behind, accompanying their every move, regardless of purity or filth. Even mortal attendants, who follow one’s left and right, dare not act wantonly. How much less should one disregard these celestial gods, whose names are inscribed in the immortal registers and who guard and protect you?

Those who receive the Purity and Brightness method possess bones of gold and flesh of jade, already in communion with the divine. Their hands judge the hidden yin realms, their words bridge the numinous and wondrous. If one harbors licentiousness, it is as though casting gold and jade into the dirt. Beware of agitation, lest it disturb the qi and blood. When qi and blood remain firm and whole, demonic forces cannot enter, and one attains true perfection, avoiding premature death. The foundation of ascension and transcendence lies in eschewing lust and desire—remember this well.

Those who receive the Purity and Brightness method remain in the world temporarily, as their kalpas are not yet complete, and they do not immediately ascend. Yet by accumulating merit and piling up deeds, they will surely depart the mortal and enter the sacred. Kindness may arise from harm, so do not casually abandon wife and children. Harm may arise from kindness, so do not covet wife and children, lest you drown within the inner chambers. Sever affection with righteousness, relinquish love and emotion, and together ascend to the celestial realms.

As for those who greedily amass wealth, insatiably craving without end; who harm others to bequeath to their children; who exhaust their bodies and deplete their marrow to please women—all such actions must cease. If one can transform others with the Dao and cultivate together, this is true understanding of the root. Should they refuse, then on the day of your enlightenment, they too will reap vast blessings—why cling to trivial matters of the present?

Those who receive the Purity and Brightness method must prioritize aiding others. Seeing another’s father, another’s mother, regard them as your own. Pity the aged, succor the orphaned, pity the poor, and tend the sick. When others face peril or illness, feel as though it were your own. With such a heart, you grasp the principle herein—remember this.

Those who receive the Purity and Brightness method must value integrity and fairness. Those in office must not rely on wealth and power; the poor must not shame their poverty and lowliness. The Celestial Lord apportions fate without the slightest partiality. I observe that many disciples, after receiving this method, practice with reckless intent, often harming beings. They arbitrarily execute gods and spirits, command thunder and clouds as though ordering servants. The wealthy, when summoned, do not come; the poor, seeing profit, rush to obey. Or, in anger, they curse and employ gods and spirits to exact vengeance and kill foes. They distort celestial decrees, dismantle statutes, and alter characters—all of which I deeply deplore.

Those who receive the Purity and Brightness method, even if they do not ascend to perfection, can achieve liberation through the corpse. Though they may not openly command spirits, the hidden realms will still obey. Do not grow impatient or restless; perseverance is key. Many of my disciples, after receiving the method, fail to measure their accumulated merit and immediately blame their masters. Without an inch of merit, they seek to ascend; lacking divine clarity, they demand the profound mysteries. Let this serve as a warning.

Those who receive the Purity and Brightness method must not recklessly transmit it to others; first, perfect yourself as a master of deliverance. Wait until you perceive, in the unseen realm, that your position is among the officials of yin. When you encounter one whose karmic conditions align, face east, burn incense, and inquire of me. If I permit it, then transmit it. Thus, I am the master of deliverance, and you become the master of transmission.

The Sun Palace’s Filial Piety Luminous King is the ancestral master. Master Wu is the registrar, Matron Chen the scripture master, and Lord Zhang of the Daily Office the supervising master of deliverance. When dozens of disciples attain the Dao, then one day, upon ascending to perfection, you shall be as I am.

Those who receive the Purity and Brightness method must transmit it only to those whose karmic conditions align, who embody loyalty and filial piety, whose qi and blood are full and complete, and whose integrity is unyielding. Do not withhold it from the poor nor grant it solely to the wealthy. To violate this is to incur guilt across three generations.

When one who has received the Purity and Brightness method seeks to transmit and deliver it, they must prepare a memorial and submit it to the ancestral master, the Supreme Emperor of the Sun Palace, performing the customary jiao rites for the Three Realms to bear witness and give thanks. Act within your means; do not borrow or squander wealth, for this would contravene my immediate decree. There is no fixed ritual.

When transmitting the method to another, after submitting the memorial, include within it a pledge attesting to the nine generations of the disciple. Upon their promotion to an immortal office, they shall be appointed as a Four-Character Immortal Aide. That night, inscribe nine talismans and fashion nine straw figures. Burn them facing the Heavenly Gate, and these straw figures shall transform into nine Direct Talismans. With these talismans in hand, one may traverse the Six Paths of Hell without hindrance, for wherever the talisman arrives, liberation follows. Present this talismanic script to the Celestial Pivot Bureau to receive official documents as an immortal officer. Those already holding immortal offices shall ascend in rank thereafter.

When inscribing the talismans, wear the sun upon your crown and tread upon the Dipper. Transmit the words orally and receive them in the heart, inscribing them while facing the Heavenly Gate. Write the talismans in cinnabar. The incantation for inscribing the talisman reads:

The *Secret Canon of Pure Clarity* for Ascending to Immortal Office. The loyal and filial child brings blessings upon their kin. For nine generations, they receive rank and are ordained to ascend as immortals. Wherever the precious register is carried, all defer and yield. Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

Thereafter, transmit the aforementioned script and carry it in practice. Clasp the Zi talisman and pace the Dipper, envisioning the sun above your head. Here ends the *Scripture of the Most High Numinous Treasure: Pure Clarity’s Entry into the Dao*.
