**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Upper Chapter on the Roots of Transgressions Through Wisdom, Scroll One**

At that time, the Supreme Dao Lord was in the Cypress Tumulus Lodge of the Southern Vermilion Cavern’s Yang Upper Palace. Bowing his head in reverence, he inquired of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy: "By virtue of the karmic blessings of past lives, through countless kalpas of cyclic turning, I have been granted the fortune to encounter this sagely and luminous age. Formerly, I was exalted beyond merit to join the ranks of the Upper Perfected, further receiving instruction in the divine scriptures of the Three Treasures and bestowed with the Great Precepts, wherein the Dharma’s resonance was proclaimed. The joy of such boundless grace is truly immeasurable.

Since receiving these teachings and admonitions, I have maintained perpetual abstinence in the empty mountains, reverently upholding the Dharma precepts without敢怠 or weariness. My Daoist practice has come to fruition, opening the gateway to deliverance for gods and humans alike—all men and women universally behold the Dharma gate, their lifespans prolonged, and their lands secured in peace. My heart delights in this bliss, my resolve unwavering. Yet though I have been awakened, there remains that which I have not yet heard.

I do not know whether the roots of transgressions through wisdom, the numinous resonance of past lives, and the profound secrecy of these teachings may briefly be glimpsed in their entirety. If you would deign to show compassion and once more bestow the words of the precepts, it would be as though the darkest night were illumined by the sun’s radiance, and the suffering souls of endless kalpas, drawn forth from their torments, might be reborn in halls of blessing. The Dao’s salvation would extend without limit, and its grace would universally flourish. Though my petition is trifling and fragmented, I fear it may offend the celestial countenance. My earnest and reverent heart truly hopes for your merciful favor."

At that moment, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy bestowed upon the Supreme Dao Lord *The Scripture of the Upper Chapter on the Precepts of the Roots of Transgressions Through Wisdom*. The Five Elder Thearchs, the Great Sagely Honored Gods, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Immortals of the Heavens, the Jade Maidens of Mystery and Harmony, and an assembly of fifty-two thousand five hundred gathered before the seat. Heavenly perfumes and blossoms rained down, while divine dragons and celestial musicians in countless numbers played. Heavenly immortals and jade maidens, bearing the Ten Absolute Numinous Banners, circled the radiance of the sun and moon. Divine winds converged from all directions, wafting incense and scattering dust. Purple clouds emitted their glow, crimson auroras suffused the sky, and the Three Luminaries shone in unison, illuminating all heavens with brilliance. Rivers and seas stilled, mountains and peaks concealed their mists, dragons and pearls leapt in joy, and gods and humans rejoiced together. Birth and death ceased as one, blessings and felicity universally flourished, the Five Sufferings were all dissolved, and the Three Wretched Realms were simultaneously absolved. Those long confined in hells were reborn in celestial palaces, and all sentient beings attained longevity.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Flying Celestial Beings of the Ten Directions to open the Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms, the coffer of eternal night, and bring forth the records of transgressions in life and death, the roots of karmic adversity. The Flying Celestial Beings of the Ten Directions each recounted their causes and conditions, reporting them to the Supreme Great Dao Lord.

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed: "In the era of Dragon Han, I emerged to establish the Dharma and guide humanity. The people of that age were ignorant and deaf to the Dharma’s resonance, living in unadorned simplicity without malice, unaware of propriety or righteousness, without rulers or subjects, ignorant of past lives or karmic causes. Through the Dharma’s instruction, they gradually entered its gate, wholeheartedly believing and turning toward it, free from the roots of transgression. Their lifespans were long, untouched by premature death.

After my passing, heaven and earth collapsed, light vanished, and men and women were reduced to ashes, sinking into the era of Yan Kang, plunged into darkness for countless kalpas. When the Crimson Radiance dawned and heaven and earth were restored, I emerged once more, known as the Nameless Lord, to proclaim the Dharma and transform the gods and humans. The people of that age varied in the refinement of their conduct, their hearts not unified. Those who believed and turned toward the Dharma attained long life, while those who harbored jealousy, malice, treachery, and disloyalty met with premature death, thus giving rise to the roots of karmic blessings and transgressions.

After my passing, a kalpa turned, and heaven and earth were again destroyed, plunged once more into darkness for five kalpas. In the first year of Kai Huang, the True Writ of the Numinous Treasure opened the Three Symbols, heaven and earth were restored to order, and the Five Scriptures shone forth in brilliance. In the Celestial Realm of Beginning Azure, I was known as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, unfolding the Dharma’s teachings to transform and deliver the heavens. At the dawn of this era, the people were unadorned, conducting themselves by knotted cords, their minds in primordial chaos, harmonious with the natural. All lived long, their lifespans reaching thirty-six thousand years.

By the first year of Shang Huang, their hearts gradually decayed, and I feared the Dharma would decline. Thus, I traversed the lands, proclaiming and bestowing the celestial writ, guiding all to enter the Dharma and perfect their hearts. Within half a kalpa, lifespans gradually diminished, reduced to over eighteen thousand years.

After my passing, the turning of heaven’s destiny hastened, and the hearts of humanity decayed further, turning to mutual deception and treachery. They envied and harmed those superior to themselves, contended for fame and merit, disbelieved the scriptures and Dharma, and doubted the Perfected of Heaven. Their words and hearts were at odds, each creating their own Dharma, worshipping heterodox spirits with licentious rites, and slaughtering living beings in prayer. Bewildered and uncentered, they mutually harmed one another, bringing upon themselves premature death, their lifespans devoid of principle, their years uncertain. Thus arose the records of transgressions and the seeds of evil, revolving endlessly within the Five Paths and Eight Difficulties, sinking into the Three Wretched Realms, ignorant of the roots of their destinies. Plunged into eternal night for countless kalpas, they drifted through the mire of suffering, a pitiable and grievous fate.

Now I shall proclaim to you the precepts for governing the body, the karmic retributions of merit and transgression, the adversities of evil, and the roots of life and death. Listen carefully, receive them with reverence, and never forget. Widely proclaim and disseminate them to universally instruct gods and humans, guiding all men and women to return their bodies to the Dharma gate, uphold the precepts, practice abstinence, and distance themselves from the sources of evil. Thus may the joys of life and death be secured, and the Dao attained naturally."

The Dao Lord rejoiced and prostrated himself to receive the precepts.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "If one desires to pacify the body and govern the state, to render one’s household pure and noble, to receive the protection of celestial gods and the reverence of earthly spirits, one must cultivate meritorious deeds, diligently practice abstinence and precepts, and broadly bestow the Dharma gate."

"First the others, then oneself—bestowing kindness upon the myriad beings, extending merit to all things. When merit fills the three thousand, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight; with virtue cultivated in abundance, clouds and chariots descend from the heavens. To propagate the Dao without cease is to attain immortality of oneself. These are the supreme precepts of fundamental conduct—how could one not reverently uphold them?

First: One must succor the dying and protect the living, rescuing those in dire peril, that life may fulfill its destined span without untimely harm.
Second: One must heal the sick and treat the afflicted, carrying those in grave distress, that the body may attain safety without enduring agony.
Third: One must bestow kindness upon the destitute, deliver those in peril, and sacrifice one’s own to aid others, without stinginess or reluctance.
Fourth: One must serve and honor the masters and treasures, establish quiet abodes, and broadly perform meritorious deeds, without weariness or slackening.
Fifth: One must transcribe and collate scriptures, recite and pay homage morning and evening, offer incense and lamps, and maintain a mind free from negligence or arrogance.
Sixth: One must cultivate abstinence and contemplate the Dao, reverently uphold the Dharma, purify both inner and outer, and refrain from generating defilement or evil.
Seventh: One must withdraw from worldly pursuits to protect righteousness, avoid contention for fame and merit, embrace simplicity and preserve purity, and act in accordance with the natural.
Eighth: One must enlighten the ignorant and vulgar, admonish and dispel evil, guiding all to single-minded devotion in venerating the Great Dharma.
Ninth: One must dig wells along roadsides, plant orchards and groves, instruct the young and unlearned, and exhort others to perform good deeds.
Tenth: One’s conduct must serve as a model, movements and stillness must be worthy of observation, teachings and systems must provide guidance, and actions must always remain thus.

These ten meritorious causes are the supreme precepts of the precept-code, revered by the Ten Heavenly Kings. Those who practice them attain merit equal to that of the flying immortals.

Next, one must maintain vigilance in conduct and speech: when addressing a ruler, one’s words should benefit the state; when addressing a father, they should foster kindness toward his children; when addressing a teacher, they should inspire love for the multitude; when addressing an elder brother, they should cultivate fraternal respect in action; when addressing a minister, they should uphold loyalty to the sovereign; when addressing a child, they should nurture filial piety toward parents; when addressing a friend, they should foster trust in fellowship; when addressing a wife, they should encourage chastity toward her husband; when addressing a husband, they should promote harmony in the household; when addressing a disciple, they should cultivate reverence for propriety; when addressing a rustic, they should encourage diligence in agriculture; when addressing a Daoist, they should rectify the Dao; when addressing a foreigner, they should ensure each remains within their own domain; when addressing servants and maids, they should exercise caution in their duties.

These fourteen precepts on maintaining personal conduct are constantly revered by the Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings. They are universally proclaimed to the noble spirits of the four directions, the people of all walks, and men and women alike, that all may practice these supreme precepts and ascend to the natural halls of bliss of the Four Heavens. Those who practice them are esteemed by the Four Heavens, praised by the earthly spirits, and their rank equals that of the Immortal Kings.

Next, there are the one hundred and eighty upper precepts, eighty middle precepts, and forty lower precepts, together with the three grades of the Primordial Beginning’s wisdom precepts, compiled into the *Great Precepts for Observing the Body*, totaling three hundred. Unless one possesses the virtue of a superior immortal, with a body pervading the Three Clarities and a nature merged with the natural, none can uphold them.

In the degenerate age, the minds of men and women will be corrupted, their conduct gradually lax and indulgent, filled with doubt and division. Pursuits and competitions will be myriad, and those who preserve the truth will be few. They will surely be unable to revere and uphold the *Precepts for Observing the Body*. Having failed to observe them, they will inevitably incur great calamity.

Now, the upper ten precepts are compiled to deliver beings and broadly propagate transformation, guiding them into the Dharma gate. Those who diligently uphold them will attain the blessings of the natural and the Dao of non-action.

The Ten Precepts are as follows:
First: Do not envy those superior to oneself or suppress the worthy and wise.
Second: Do not indulge in wine or licentiousness, defiling the Three Palaces.
Third: Do not commit adultery with another’s spouse or covet sensual pleasures.
Fourth: Do not abandon or despise the elderly, sick, destitute, or lowly.
Fifth: Do not slander the virtuous or malign fellow practitioners.
Sixth: Do not hoard treasures and refuse to bestow or distribute them.
Seventh: Do not kill living beings to sacrifice to the Six Heavenly Ghost-Spirits.
Eighth: Do not arbitrarily discuss scriptures, dismissing them as false and absurd.
Ninth: Do not betray the kindness and righteousness of one’s teacher, feigning devotion as a new disciple.
Tenth: Maintain an equanimous mind and practice benevolence and filial piety toward all.

These Ten Precepts are universally taught throughout the boundless worlds to deliver all beings. Those who uphold them will have their merit recorded in the Ten Heavens, their blessings extending to seven generations of ancestors, lifting them from the long night of the Nine Dark Realms to ascend to the Southern Palace. Their bodies will enter the radiance of light, their karmic connections unbroken, and they will attain the state of divine immortals. With all practices fulfilled, one must avoid the Ten Evils, distance oneself from the blind path, and sever the roots of sin.

The Ten Evils are as follows:
First: Indulging in wine and lust, with insatiable greed and desire.
Second: Secretly harming the world and slandering Daoists.
Third: Disrespecting teachers and the Dharma, arrogantly neglecting the Three Treasures.
Fourth: Stealing scriptures and recklessly proclaiming the essentials of the Dao.
Fifth: Borrowing and failing to return, deceiving and misleading the people.
Sixth: Killing living beings for taste, with a mouth that praises but a heart that denies.
Seventh: Being unfilial, betraying kindness, violating righteousness, and transgressing all prohibitions.
Eighth: Reciting scriptures carelessly, being haughty and self-righteous.
Ninth: Demanding compliance with one’s expectations, harboring anger toward the four classes of beings.
Tenth: Distorting the meaning of scriptures, altering or diminishing the sacred texts, disbelieving in past lives, indulging in reckless desires, defiling and disdaining the Four Great Elements, and neglecting the path of life.

These Ten Evils cannot be separated from the body. Those who violate them will suffer myriad misfortunes, their lives harmed by ghosts and spirits, enduring endless torment without a moment’s peace. Though they tread the path of goodness, they will encounter evil, and all their endeavors will fail. Upon death, they will enter hell, confined in the heavy barriers of the long night, never beholding the Three Lights, drifting day and night. They will embrace the bronze pillars, tread the knife mountains, traverse the sword trees, plunge into cauldrons of boiling water, swallow fire and eat coals, enduring the five sufferings in full. They will be eternally submerged in the Nine Dark Realms, without hope of rebirth. Even if they attain liberation, they will be reborn among the six kinds of animals, never regaining human form. Evil draws evil, just as goodness begets goodness. The retribution of sin and blessing is like the sunlight descending, while the unceasing cycle of life and death follows the shadow accompanying the form. Karmic consequences accumulate like the turning of a wheel."

Here now is the precept expounded, to shield and ferry gods and humans, to illuminate and discern, to receive with clarity, and to practice diligently without forgetfulness.

If faithful men and women can steadfastly uphold the Ten Precepts, their capacity and strength both ample, and aspire to practice with diligence and advance in purity, widely bestowing manifold goodness, they may be conferred the Twelve Permissible Observances, and instructed in the Ten Virtues and the Fourteen Rules for Conduct.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: Those who study, perform purification rites, and seek the Dao, who deliver gods and humans and perform all meritorious deeds, ought to practice the Twelve Permissible Precepts. Through these, they may attain deliverance from the world. You should follow them, thereby attaining true perfection and ultimately entering the realm of non-action, with all aspirations fulfilled.

The Twelve Permissible Precepts are as follows:

First, upon encountering true scriptures and the orthodox Dharma, delivering all beings, one should awaken the Dao-mind, vowing that in future lives one may ascend to the rank of great sage.

Second, one should constantly practice a heart of compassion, wishing that all beings may behold the Dharma, be delivered far and wide, without obstruction.

Third, one should delight in the scriptural teachings, deeply and broadly comprehending them, with a will firm and bright, enlightening the ignorant and benighted.

Fourth, one should follow the instructions of one’s teacher, widely exhorting and transforming others, guiding them into the enclosure of the Dharma, far from blind paths.

Fifth, one should trust in and turn toward the profound and wondrous, reverently upholding the scriptural instructions, reciting and studying them morning and evening without weariness or sloth.

Sixth, one should not pursue glory and splendor, severing karmic entanglements, concentrating the mind and fixing the will, with all endeavors directed toward the Dharma.

Seventh, one should diligently recite the great scriptures, wishing for all beings, widely building bridges, and creating good causes for future lives.

Eighth, one should constantly generate a heart of goodness, neither deviant nor false, without jealousy or harm, without malice or obstruction.

Ninth, wherever one is reborn, one should always encounter a sagely age, with the Lingbao teachings flourishing, never failing to meet them.

Tenth, one should purify the body and uphold the precepts, perform purification rites and establish merit, widely rescuing all beings, that all may attain deliverance.

Eleventh, one should broadly study and comprehend the teachings, propagating and communicating them to fellow practitioners, thereby including gods and humans, universally delivering all.

Twelfth, one should always encounter enlightened teachers, life after life, receiving instruction and propagating transformation, delivering countless beings. All good intentions shall attain the true Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: The method for scholars to cultivate conduct lies in practicing the Twelve Permissible Precepts. If one can practice these good intentions with a single mind, life after life one will behold the sagely, form karmic bonds with the Dao, befriend the gods, and walk alone through the Three Realms without hindrance. One will forever depart from the Three Evil Paths, the Five Destinies, and the Eight Difficulties. Divine spirits will respect and protect, earthly deities will surround and guard. One’s household will be pure and solemn, myriad calamities will not encroach. Truly, one may sit upright and attain the Dao.

Diligently study and recite, widely propagate to fellow learners, that all may together enter the Dharma-gate.

At that time, when the Heavenly Worthy had finished expounding the precepts, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Boundless Great Sages, and the Lofty Transcendent Ones all rejoiced, made obeisance, and simultaneously faced east, prostrating themselves to the ground.

The Most High Lord of the Dao advanced, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "All the Perfected in attendance, having heard the Dharma-sound, and the gods of the heavens, leap for joy, their delight beyond measure. As the Great Dharma flourishes, it universally delivers gods and humans. In future lives, men and women shall receive this grace. Yet we see that the world’s foolish and deaf do not perceive the root of destiny, nor know the consequences of sin and blessing, whence they arise. Though exhorted and awakened, many do not believe. Having already bestowed instruction and admonition, we now pray that Your August Grace be universally bestowed, that the men, women, and children of the boundless worlds in the ten directions may simultaneously awaken, perceive the karmic conditions of past lives—good and evil, the retribution of sin and blessing—and know the root of destiny. May all under heaven attain deliverance, and the Dharma-teachings daily flourish."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy emitted the radiance of his majestic body, illuminating within and without, shining through the ten directions. No darkness remained hidden, no bound was left unpervaded. All was instantly illuminated, as if seen before one’s eyes. All men and women were revealed as blessed beings from the halls of goodness above the heavens, carefree and at ease, their joy natural. Below, they beheld the Nine Dark Realms of the earthly prisons, the long night’s confines, where prisoners toiled, hungry ghosts and beasts, drifting dead souls, their heads and bodies shorn and severed, no longer possessing human form. They were shut in heavy barriers, never beholding the Three Lights. All men and women saw the root of destiny, the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, the retribution of good and evil. None were not struck with awe, all simultaneously turned their hearts, revered and upheld the Great Dharma, practiced manifold goodness, entrusted their lives to the Heavenly Worthy, and submitted to the prohibitions and precepts, never again turning back. Blessings and virtue universally pervaded, their joy indescribable, their delight beyond measure.

The Great Sages of the heavens all extolled the good, and composed a hymn, saying:

The Ten Heavens wheel through the empty void,
Life and death return therein.
Good and evil each bear their roots,
Karmic conditions never fail in their response.
Of old, we saw the faithful,
Thus ascending the Ten Heavens.
Gazing upon the long night of the Nine Dark Realms,
The suffering souls climb the sorrowful peaks.
The Long River cannot be dammed,
The Knife Mountains cannot be turned back.
Revolving in the Five Paths,
Pity and sorrow fill the heart.
The Heavenly Worthy expounds the prohibitions,
Brightly dispelling the long night.
The heavens all rejoice,
This joy cannot be matched.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: Now I shall command the divine messengers and gods of the heavens to proclaim the records of sins, propagate the Dharma-sound, awaken all beings, and enlighten the gods and humans—good men and good women. Let them know the karmic roots of bodily actions, sin, and evil, the unbroken conditions, the calamitous consequences that pursue, drifting in the Three Wretched Paths and the Five Destinies, where souls and forms suffer torment, for kalpas without return. Therefore, these precepts are expounded, to guide them into the Dharma-gate, deliver the Nine Dark Realms, extract the roots of suffering, that the living may behold the Dao and escape the Eight Difficulties, the dead may rejoice and ascend to the heavens, be reborn early among humans, become Wheel-Turning Sage Kings, and in life and death know peace, existing for ages unending. Those who beforehand trust and turn toward the Dharma should all concentrate their minds, uphold the precepts and perform purification rites, thereby attaining the true Dao. Be cautious in practice, diligent in cultivation, receive with clarity and never forget. Those who can align with the Great Dharma should now submit and listen.

The Lower Scroll of the *Highest Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Wisdom Roots of Transgressions, Upper Grade Precepts* begins.

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Eastern Ultimate World declares: In the Eastern Boundless World, the multitude of beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—those who have already attained the Dao in past lives and those presently virtuous men and women of good fortune who have yet to attain the Dao—who cultivate and uphold the Ten Upper-Grade Precepts of Wisdom, when their merit is complete and their blessings fulfilled, shall ascend through the void, soaring in broad daylight, riding upon the radiance and spurring dragons, ascending to the Jade Purity, and roaming amidst the Nine Qi Heavens of the Eastern Ultimate.

Those who have not yet attained the Dao shall be born into wealth and nobility in the world, occupying honored positions among humans, with long lifespans and no premature death.

The Azure Emperor of the East shall inscribe their names and memorialize the Nine Qi Heaven, the Nine Qi Heavenly Officials, who shall then decree to the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Eastern Earthly Prisons, erasing their names from the Azure Register of the Nine Dark Realms and the Everlasting Night Scrolls of the Jade Casket, severing the roots of their past-life transgressions.

The Life-Commanders of the Azure Heaven shall record them in the registers of heavenly immortals, and their seven generations of ancestors shall all ascend to the heavens, clothed and fed by nature, reborn in successive generations into the gates of emperors and kings, rejoicing in life after life, forever dwelling in good fortune, their karmic conditions unbroken, thus attaining the root of faith.

The Most High Dao Lord turned and asked the Flying Heavenly Deity of the Eastern Ultimate World: "I have often traversed the heavens and journeyed through the Eastern Gate, where I beheld in the Eastern Boundless World’s hells the common folk—men and women—enduring floggings and torments, their bodies afflicted with every pain, their forms emaciated and withered, their suffering beyond words. Witnessing this, I grieved deeply. How many years must they endure this penal servitude before they may be released, return to the human realm, and escape their evil karmic conditions? What meritorious deeds must such beings perform to extricate themselves from this enmity, attain deliverance, and re-enter the gate of goodness?"

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Eastern Ultimate World replied: "The transgressions of these beings are recorded in the Everlasting Night Scrolls of the Nine Dark Realms. The Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, the Azure Heavenly Numinous Officials, and the Three Realms’ Registrars have tallied their offenses. According to the statutes of the Left Bureau of the Jade Maiden of the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Palace, they must endure ninety thousand kalpas before they may return, reborn into non-human destinies, and undergo transmigration for ninety million kalpas. Only when the reckoning of heaven and earth is exhausted may they serve as laborers in the Nine Rivers, their hardships beyond description. To attain deliverance and sever their evil karmic conditions, they must follow the regulations of the Luminous Perfected Jade Casket and the Jade Maiden of the Upper Palace’s statutes: present ninety feet of azure-patterned silk (or nine feet), and one golden dragon, to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord of the East and the Eastern Numinous Officials of the Nine Dark Realms, to redeem and extricate the suffering souls, cutting off the roots of their transgressions. For nine days and nine nights, they must illuminate lamps, burn incense, and prostrate in repentance before the Heavenly Lord. Then, in the depths of the Nine Dark Realms, they shall behold the light and attain liberation, re-entering the conditions of goodness. Within nine years, they shall all be reborn among humans, rejoicing in life after life, their blessings and felicity boundless."

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southeastern World declares: In the Southeastern Boundless World, the multitude of beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—those who have already attained the Dao in past lives and those presently virtuous men and women of good fortune who have yet to attain the Dao—who cultivate and uphold the Ten Upper-Grade Precepts of Wisdom, when their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, shall receive the blessings of the Cinnabar Heaven. Those who have attained the Dao shall ascend to the rank of Highest Perfected, become immortals or numinous officials, or attain extinction.

Their names shall be inscribed in the Upper Clarity, and they may ascend to the ranks of highest sages or become immortals, roaming the Five Peaks, riding dragons and traversing the void. In the present world, they shall serve as teachers and exemplars to humanity, revered by the myriad clans, respected by the Three Realms, their households noble and pure, their blessings and felicity boundless.

The Southeastern Earthly Offices shall inscribe their names and memorialize the Brahma Qi Heaven, the Brahma Qi Heavenly Officials, who shall then decree to the Three Offices, Nine Courts, and One Hundred Twenty Bureaus of the Southeast, erasing their names from the Yellow Register of the Nine Dark Realms and the Everlasting Night Scrolls of the Jade Casket, severing the roots of their past-life transgressions.

The Life-Commanders of the Brahma Heaven shall record them in the registers of Brahma Heaven’s immortals, and their seven generations of ancestors shall all depart the Three Wretched Realms, ascend to the heavens, and feast upon the celestial kitchens. Within twelve years, they shall all be reborn into the gates of good fortune and virtue, the households of emperors and kings, rejoicing in life after life, their karmic conditions revolving until they attain the flight of immortals.

The Most High Dao Lord turned and asked the Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southeastern World: "I have often traversed the heavens and journeyed through the Southeastern Gate, where I beheld in the Southeastern Boundless World’s hells the common folk—men and women—enduring these evil retributions, their suffering beyond words. Witnessing this, I grieved deeply, filled with pity. How many years must they endure punishment before they may be released? When pardoned, they shall be reborn among humans, assuming whatever forms they may. What meritorious deeds must such beings perform to attain deliverance?"

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southeastern World replied: "The transgressions of these beings are of the cruelest and most perverse kind, recorded in the Everlasting Night Scrolls of the Nine Dark Realms. The One Qi Heavenly Lord, the Brahma Qi Numinous Officials, and the Three Realms’ Registrars have tallied their offenses. According to the statutes of the Central Bureau of the Jade Maiden of the Mysterious Capital’s Central Palace, they must endure ten thousand kalpas before they may return, reborn among the lowly, their bodies afflicted with the Six Extremities, bearing deformities or chronic illnesses. They shall undergo transmigration for twelve myriad kalpas without number before they may serve as laborers in the Eastern Peak. Their hardships are beyond description. To attain deliverance and return to the conditions of goodness, they must follow the regulations of the Luminous Perfected Jade Casket and the Jade Maiden of the Central Palace’s statutes: present one hundred twenty feet of yellow-patterned silk (or twelve feet), and one golden dragon, to the Brahma Qi Heavenly Lord of the Southeast and the Southeastern Numinous Officials of the Nine Dark Realms, to redeem and extricate the sinful souls. For twelve days and twelve nights, they must illuminate lamps, burn incense, and prostrate in repentance before the Heavenly Lord. Then they shall attain deliverance, behold the light, and within twelve years, all shall be reborn into the gates of good fortune and virtue, rejoicing in life after life, forever enjoying boundless blessings."

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southern Boundless World declares: In the Southern Boundless World, the multitude of beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—those who have already attained the Dao in past lives and those presently virtuous men and women of good fortune who have yet to attain the Dao—who cultivate and uphold the Ten Upper-Grade Precepts of Wisdom, when their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, shall receive the blessings of the Cinnabar Heaven. Those who have attained the Dao shall ascend to the rank of Highest Perfected, become immortals or numinous officials, or attain extinction.

In the present world, they possess keen intelligence and wisdom, foreseeing fortune and misfortune, or they attain spiritual clarity and far-seeing vision, commanding ghosts and spirits, or dwell within the gates of wealth, nobility, and imperial power. The Southern Red Emperor and the Southern Pole Earth Controller shall inscribe their names in the registers of the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven and the Three Qi Heavenly Officials, and proclaim to the Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, and One Hundred Twenty Offices of the Southern Realm to expunge the karmic roots of their past sins from the Crimson Prime Nine Dark Hells and the Jade Casket of Eternal Night. The Cinnabar Heaven Controller of Destiny shall record them in the divine register of Cinnabar Heaven immortals, and their seven generations of ancestors shall universally depart from the Three Wretched Realms, ascend to the Heavenly Palaces, and roam freely in the Southern Palace. Within three years, all shall be reborn into the gates of good fortune and virtue, rejoicing in life after life, their blessings and joys beyond measure, their good affinities unbroken, and they shall attain the rank of divine immortals.

The Most High Dao Lord turned to the Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southern Boundless World and inquired: "I have often surveyed the heavens and journeyed through the Southern Gate, where I beheld in the hells of the Southern Boundless World the common folk—men and women—naked and without clothing, swallowing fire and consuming coals, their faces scorched and bodies aflame, their forms no longer human, enduring cruel retributions, their suffering beyond words. Witnessing this, I was moved to tears, my heart grieved with sorrow. How many years must such beings endure their retribution before they may be liberated? When the day of their pardon arrives, in what form shall they be reborn among humans? By what merciful method and what meritorious deeds may they be delivered and restored to good affinities?"

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southern Boundless World replied: "These individuals were cruel and perverse in life, devoid of the Dao. Their sins bound them to the Nine Dark Hells of Eternal Night. The Three Qi Heavenly Lords, the Cinnabar Heaven Numinous Officials, and the Three Realms’ Controllers of Destiny have recorded their transgressions. According to the statutes of the Mysterious Capital’s Female Azure Yang Palace and the Greater Yang Officials, their penal servitude spans thirty thousand kalpas, after which they shall be reborn among the six kinds of livestock to repay their karmic debts. After three million kalpas, cycling through the reckonings of Cinnabar Heaven, they may become laborers in the Three Rivers’ offices, their toil and suffering beyond description. If one wishes to deliver them and sever their evil affinities, hastening their return to the human realm, they must follow the statutes of the Luminous Perfected Jade Casket and the Female Azure Lower Palace: with thirty feet of crimson-patterned silk (or three feet), and one golden dragon, they shall journey to the Southern Three Qi Heavenly Lord and the Southern Region’s Numinous Officials within the Nine Dark Hells to redeem the sinful souls. For three days and three nights, they shall light lamps and burn incense, bowing in gratitude to the Heavenly Lords. Thus, they may swiftly emerge from the Eternal Night, behold the radiant lights, and within three years, all shall be reborn among humans, their affinities unbroken, and they shall turn toward the root of faith."

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southwestern World declared: "In the Southwestern Boundless World, the multitude of beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—those who have already attained the Dao in past lives and those presently virtuous men and women of good fortune who have yet to attain the Dao—who cultivate and uphold the Ten Upper-Grade Precepts of Wisdom, when their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, shall receive their karmic rewards. Those who have attained the Dao shall ascend to the rank of Highest Perfected. Those who have not yet attained the Dao shall, in their present lives, be praised by earth deities and revered by heavenly spirits. Upon death, they shall ascend to the Southern Palace, receive the title of Heavenly Official of the Upper Supplement, and govern ghosts and spirits. The Southwestern Primal Qi Heavenly Lord shall proclaim to the Earth Deities, Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, and One Hundred Twenty Offices of the Southwestern Realm to expunge the karmic roots of their past sins from the Yellow Prime Nine Dark Hells and the Jade Casket of Eternal Night. The Primal Heaven Controller of Destiny shall inscribe their names in the divine register of Primal Heaven immortals. Their nine generations of ancestors shall universally depart from the Three Wretched Realms and the Five Sufferings, ascend to the Southern Palace, and roam freely in the Hall of Blessings. After twelve years, all shall be reborn into the gates of wealth and nobility, their affinities unbroken, and they shall attain the rank of divine immortals."

The Most High Dao Lord turned to the Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southwestern World and inquired: "I have often surveyed the heavens and journeyed through the Southwestern Gate, where I beheld in the Eternal Night Hells of the Southwestern Boundless World—within the Three Rivers, Nine Streams, and Five Peaks—the common folk, men and women, enduring cruel retributions, their suffering unbearable. Witnessing this, I was filled with sorrow, my heart grieved. How many years must such beings endure before they may be liberated? When the day of their pardon arrives, in what form shall they be reborn? By what meritorious deeds may they be delivered and restored to good fortune?"

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Southwestern World replied: "In their past ten human lives, these individuals committed no good deeds, living in constant rebellion. The Primal Qi Heavenly Lord, the Primal Qi Numinous Officials, and the Three Realms’ Controllers of Destiny have recorded their transgressions. According to the statutes of the Mysterious Capital’s Female Azure Lower Palace and the Right Officials, after ten thousand kalpas, they may be reborn as lowly servants. After cycling through one hundred twenty thousand kalpas of countless revolutions, they may become laborers in the Southern River offices, their toil and suffering beyond words. If one wishes to deliver them and restore their good affinities, they must follow the statutes of the Luminous Perfected Jade Casket and the Female Azure Lower Palace: with one hundred twenty feet of yellow-patterned silk (or twelve feet), and one golden dragon, they shall journey to the Southwestern Primal Qi Heavenly Lord and the Southwestern Numinous Officials within the Nine Dark Hells to redeem the sinful souls. For twelve days and twelve nights, they shall light lamps and burn incense, bowing in gratitude to the Heavenly Lords and the Southwestern Numinous Officials. Thus, they may be delivered from the Eternal Night and behold the radiant lights. Within twelve years, all shall be reborn into the gates of good fortune and blessings."

The Flying Heavenly Deity of the Western World declared: "In the Western Boundless World, the multitude of beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—those who have already attained the Dao in past lives and those presently virtuous men and women of good fortune who have yet to attain the Dao—who cultivate and uphold the Ten Upper-Grade Precepts of Wisdom, when their merit is complete and their virtue rewarded, those who have attained the Dao shall ascend to the rank of Highest Perfected. Those who have not yet attained the Dao shall have their names inscribed in the Mysterious Terrace of the Great Simplicity, their lives transcended and their souls ascended to heaven, becoming guests of the Most High. The Western White Emperor shall inscribe their names in the Seven Qi Heaven. The Seven Qi Heavenly Lord shall proclaim to the Three Officials of the Western Realm and the Nine Offices of the Earthly Prisons to expunge the karmic roots of their past sins from the White Prime Nine Dark Hells and the Jade Casket of Eternal Night."

The Director of Destiny in the Plain Heaven shall inscribe their names in the registers of divine immortals among the heavens. Their seven generations of ancestors shall universally depart from the Three Wicked Paths and the Five Sufferings, ascending to the Golden Portals to receive natural blessings, roaming the Hall of Fortune, and enjoying boundless joy. In later rebirths among humankind, they shall be revered as human dignitaries, respected by the Three Realms, and praised by ghosts and spirits. As their wheel of fortune turns, all shall attain the rank of divine immortals.

The Most High Dao Lord turned to the Flying Celestial Beings of the Western Realm and inquired: "I have often surveyed the heavens and journeyed through the Western Gate, where I beheld the Nine Dark Hells of Eternal Night in the Western Realm of the Infinite, as well as the Three Rivers and Nine Streams among the mountains, where male and female ghostly souls are punished and toil, drifting through the Three Wicked Paths and enduring the full weight of the Five Sufferings. What past karmic retribution has brought these beings to suffer such punishment? In how many years may they attain liberation, and what meritorious deeds may redeem and deliver them?"

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Western Realm replied: "These beings, in their past lives, acted contrary to the Dao. The Seven Qi Heavenly Lord, the various spirit officials of the Western Realm, and the governing authorities of the Three Realms have recorded their transgressions. According to the statutes of the Dark Bureau of the Right Palace of the Mysterious Capital’s Lady of Qing, after ten thousand kalpas, they may be reborn in the frontier barbarian lands, possessing human form but lacking human sentiment. After seventy thousand kalpas, when the reckoning of the White Emperor has completed its cycles, they may become laborers under the command of the Western Peak. This suffering is endless, their toil beyond words. Should one wish to deliver them and restore them to good karmic conditions, they must follow the regulations of the Jade Casket of Luminous Perfection and the statutes of the Right Palace of the Lady of Qing: present seventy feet of white silk—or seven feet—and one golden dragon to the Seven Qi Heavenly Lord, the various spirit officials of the Western Realm, and the Nine Dark Hells to redeem their karmic roots. For seven days and seven nights, keep bright lamps lit and burn incense, prostrating before the Heavenly Lord to seek deliverance. Thus may they behold the light. After seven years, all shall be reborn into the families of the virtuous."

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northwestern Realm declared: "Among the boundless multitudes of the Northwestern Realm of the Infinite, both those who have attained the Dao in past lives and those good men and women of present good fortune who have yet to attain the Dao—who cultivate and uphold the Ten Upper-Grade Precepts of Wisdom—when their merit is complete and their virtue rewarded, those who have attained the Dao shall ascend to the rank of Highest Perfected. Those who have not yet attained the Dao shall have their names inscribed in the Nine Heavens, their lives transcended and their souls ascended to heaven, where they shall consort with the Five Emperors. The Yellow Emperor shall inscribe their names in the Heaven of Brahma Qi. The Heavenly Lord of Brahma Qi shall proclaim to the Three Officials of the Northwestern Realm and the Nine Offices of the Earthly Prisons to expunge the karmic roots of their past sins from the Yellow Prime Nine Dark Hells and the Jade Casket of Eternal Night."

The Director of Destiny in the Brahma Heaven shall inscribe their names in the registers of divine immortals among the heavens. Their seven generations of ancestors shall all depart from the Five Paths, ascending to the Nine Heavens to receive boundless blessings. In later rebirths among humankind, they shall be courageous and diligent, their might prevailing over the Five Directions. With unbroken karmic conditions, they shall be appointed as Perfected Ones of the Five Emperors.

The Most High Dao Lord turned to the Flying Celestial Beings of the Northwestern Realm and inquired: "I have often surveyed the heavens and journeyed through the Northwestern Gate, where I beheld the hells of the Northwestern Realm of the Infinite—the Nine Streams of Eternal Night and the Frozen Courts of Darkness—where the common folk, men and women, suffer in filth and drift in torment, their bodies lashed and afflicted with unbearable agony. How many years must such beings endure punishment before they may attain liberation? When pardoned, what form shall they take upon returning to the human realm?"

If pardon has not yet been granted, what merits or virtues may be cultivated to deliver them?

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northwestern Realm replied: "Such beings have committed acts of extreme cruelty and transgression. The Qi Sovereign of the Northwest and the various spirit-officials, along with the overseers of the Three Realms, have recorded their sins in the ledgers. According to the statutes of the Mysterious Capital’s Lady of the Dark Yin, the Water Bureau, and the Palace of the Hidden Moon, they are condemned to ten thousand kalpas of rebirth in realms of ignorance and darkness, afflicted with deafness, blindness, and the six maladies, no longer retaining human form. They shall revolve through the Five Paths for one hundred twenty thousand kalpas, countless cycles, before they may be appointed as laborers in the Long River Bureau. This suffering is boundless, their toil beyond description.

Should one wish to deliver them and guide them back into the gate of goodness, they must follow the statutes of the Luminous Perfected Jade Treasury and the Lady of the Dark Yin’s Palace. Offer one hundred twenty feet of yellow-patterned silk—or as little as twelve feet—and a golden dragon, presenting them to the Qi Sovereign of the Northwest, the various spirit-officials of the Northwest, and the Nine Dark Prisons to ransom the sinful souls. For twelve days and twelve nights, light lamps and burn incense, bowing in repentance before the Sovereign. Thus may they attain deliverance and behold the radiant light. After twelve years, they shall gain freedom, be reborn among humans, and re-enter the gate of good karmic conditions, enjoying boundless joy for generations to come."

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northern Realm said: "In the Northern Realm of the Infinite, among the countless sentient beings—both those who have already attained the Dao in past lives and those presently abiding in blessed goodness, the virtuous men and women who cultivate and uphold the Ten Precepts of Supreme Wisdom—when their merits and virtues are complete, their celestial rewards shall be inscribed in the Upper Clarity. Some ascend to the rank of highest sages, roaming the Three Clarities; others, upon the end of their lives, become Illustrious Lords of the Four Poles. In their present existence, they dwell in blessed virtue, revered by spirits and protected from the myriad calamities. The earthly bureaus of the North shall report to the Celestial Palace, where the Five Qi Sovereigns instruct the Three Officials, Nine Courts, and One Hundred Twenty Offices of the North to erase from the Jade Treasury of the Nine Dark Prisons and the Eternal Night Archives the roots of their past sins. The Northern Celestial Bureau of Destiny shall inscribe their names in the registers of divine immortals. Their seven generations of ancestors shall universally ascend to the Heavenly Halls, clothed and nourished by nature. Within five years, they shall all be reborn into the gates of emperors and kings, revolving through cycles of blessed virtue, forever abiding in good karmic conditions."

The Most High Dao Lord turned to the Flying Celestial Beings of the Northern Realm and inquired: "I have often surveyed the heavens and journeyed through the Northern Gate, where I beheld the hells of the Northern Realm of the Infinite—the Three Rivers, Nine Streams, and myriad mountains—where the common folk, men and women, suffer their retributions, dragged through filth and torment, bearing mountains and stones upon their backs, blocking the eternal springs, swallowing fire and gazing upon coals, their bodies no longer retaining human form. How many years must such beings endure punishment before they may attain liberation? When pardoned, what form shall they take upon returning to the human realm? May they be delivered, or not?"

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northern Realm replied: "Such beings, in their past lives, committed acts of extreme cruelty and lawlessness. The Five Qi Sovereign of the North and the various spirit-officials, along with the overseers of the Three Realms, have recorded their sins. According to the statutes of the Mysterious Capital’s Lady of the Luminous Yang, the Fire Bureau, they are condemned to ten thousand kalpas of rebirth among the six livestock. They shall revolve through the Five Paths for fifty thousand kalpas, countless cycles of the Northern Celestial reckoning, before they may be appointed as laborers in the Northern Marchmount Bureau. Their retribution is vast, their repayment not swiftly fulfilled.

Should one wish to deliver them and swiftly restore their life’s root, they must follow the statutes of the Luminous Perfected Jade Treasury and the Lady of the Luminous Yang’s Palace. Offer fifty feet of dark-patterned silk—or as little as five feet—and a golden dragon, presenting them to the Five Qi Sovereign of the North, the various spirit-officials, and the Nine Dark Prisons to ransom the sinful souls. For five days and five nights, light lamps and burn incense, bowing in repentance before the Sovereign. Thus may they attain deliverance and behold the radiant light. Within five years, their bodies shall be reborn into good karmic conditions."

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northeastern Realm said: "In the Northeastern Realm of the Infinite, among the countless sentient beings—both those who have already attained the Dao in past lives and those presently abiding in blessed goodness, the virtuous men and women who cultivate and uphold the Ten Precepts of Supreme Wisdom—when their merits and virtues are complete, those who have attained the Dao ascend to the rank of highest perfected ones, while those who have not yet attained the Dao, in their present existence, are revered by the Three Realms and feared by earthly deities. Upon death, they ascend to the Heavenly Halls, where divine beings welcome them. The earthly bureaus of the Northeast shall report to the Celestial Palace of Brahma Qi, where the Brahma Qi Sovereign instructs the Three Officials, Nine Courts, and One Hundred Twenty Offices of the Northeast to erase from the Yellow Prime Jade Treasury of the Nine Dark Prisons and the Eternal Night Archives the roots of their past sins. The Brahma Celestial Bureau of Destiny shall inscribe their names in the registers of divine immortals. Their nine generations of ancestors shall ascend to the Southern Palace, departing the Five Paths to dwell in the Halls of Blessedness. Within five years, they shall all be reborn into the gates of blessed virtue, their karmic conditions spanning generations, enjoying boundless felicity."

The Most High Dao Lord turned to the Flying Celestial Beings of the Northeastern Realm and inquired: "I have often surveyed the heavens and journeyed through the Northeastern Gate, where I beheld the hells of the Northeastern Realm of the Infinite, where the common folk, men and women, endure their past retributions, suffering every torment, dragged through filth and mire, their bodies no longer retaining human form. What crimes did they commit in past lives? What offenses did they incur? Whose lives did they take, that they now endure such retribution? What merits must be cultivated to ransom their sinful bodies and guide them back into the path of goodness?"

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northeastern Realm replied: "In their past lives, these beings lacked compassion. During the three spring months, they roamed hunting, setting nets and snares, burning mountains, and shooting wild beasts, slaughtering countless lives. Their sins are grave, and in death, they suffer the consequences—beaten with clubs, a thousand pains assailing them, driven through the hundred extremes, never resting in eating or sleeping.

To deliver them from such sins and restore them to blessedness, one must follow the statutes of the Luminous Perfected. Offer one hundred twenty feet of yellow-patterned silk—or as little as twelve feet—and a golden dragon, presenting them to the Brahma Qi Sovereign of the Northeast, the various spirit-officials, and the Nine Dark Prisons. For twelve days and twelve nights, burn incense and light lamps, illuminating the hells of heaven and earth, so that the long-imprisoned souls may behold the radiant light, their sinful roots dispersed. Thus may they return to the gate of blessedness, their souls ascending to the Southern Palace to receive natural rejoicing."

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Lower Realm declare: In the boundless worlds of the Lower Realm, among the countless sentient beings—those who have attained the Dao as Earth Immortals and the Perfected of the Five Peaks, as well as the virtuous men and women still abiding in blessedness who have yet to attain the Dao—those who cultivate and uphold the Ten Precepts of Supreme Wisdom, their merits complete and virtues fulfilled, shall ascend as Highest Perfected if they have already attained the Dao. Those who have not yet attained it shall have their names inscribed in the heavens, and upon the passing of their lives, they shall ascend directly to the Hall of Blessings. The Five Emperors of the Five Peaks in the Eastern Florescence Palace shall proclaim to the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords of the Heavens, and command the Eight Extremes, the Three Officials, the Nine Bureaus, and the earthly prisons to erase the records of their sins from the Jade Archives of the Nine Dark Prisons, severing the karmic roots of their past lives. The Heavenly Registrars shall inscribe their names in the Golden Register of Divine Immortals. Their seven generations of ancestors shall be freed from earthly toil, ascending to the Southern Palace. In their next lives, they shall be born into gates of wealth and nobility, where they may accumulate merit through diligent cultivation, tirelessly turning the wheel of existence until they attain flight and ascend to the Great Ultimate, achieving the rank of Divine Immortals.

The Most High Lord of the Dao turned and asked the Flying Celestial Beings of the boundless worlds of the Lower Realm: "I have often observed the Lower Realm, journeying through the Eight Extremes. I have seen in the hells of the boundless worlds below men and women enduring cruel retributions, bound together in suffering, mired in the filth of the Eight Extremes among the imprisoned multitudes. For what crimes were they born? What transgressions did they commit in life? Which scriptures or laws did they violate to suffer such retribution? What meritorious deeds must be performed to redeem their past offenses, allowing them to be reborn into the human realm?"

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Lower Realm replied: "These beings, in their past lives, disrespected spirits and deities, rejected the teachings of the scriptures, and offended the Earth Spirits, the Five Peaks, and the Four Waterways—sins beyond reckoning. After death, they endure cruel punishments, sinking into the dark hells, and without the statutes of the Luminous Perfected to deliver them, they would remain bound for ten thousand kalpas without release. To liberate them, one must offer thirty-two feet of yellow-patterned silk and a golden dragon, presenting them to the various earthly administrations, the Five Peaks, the famous mountains, the Three Officials of the waters, the Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources, and the Nine Dark Prisons to redeem the sinful souls. For one day and one night, through the twelve hours, burn incense and light lamps, illuminating the depths of the earth and the Nine Dark Prisons, so that the long-imprisoned dead souls may behold the radiant light, receive deliverance, and return to the gate of blessedness."

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Upper Realm declare: In the boundless worlds of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Upper Realm, among the countless sentient beings—those who have attained the Dao as Highest Sages, Lofty Spirits, and the various Perfected Ones, as well as the men and women still abiding in blessedness who have yet to attain the Dao—those who cultivate and uphold the Ten Precepts of Supreme Wisdom, their merits complete and virtues fulfilled, shall ascend as Highest Perfected if they have already attained the Dao. Those who have not yet attained it shall have their names inscribed in the Thirty-Two Heavens. Upon the passing of their lives, they shall ascend directly to the Hall of Blessings, roaming freely above the Three Realms and the Great Veil, where the heavens make special distinction for them. In the long nights of the Nine Dark Prisons, their records of sin shall be erased, their seven generations of ancestors delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace. Reborn into the human realm, they shall cultivate the good Dao, their karmic affinities spanning lifetimes, their joys unending. They shall attain the rank of Divine Immortals, soaring through the Three Realms and the heavens of the Great Veil.

The Most High Lord of the Dao turned and asked the Flying Celestial Beings of the Upper Realm: "I have often observed the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Upper Realm, journeying through the Three Realms. I have seen in the Northern Prison of Heaven, the Azure Luminous Upper Prison, and the Three Rivers’ Repository of Accumulated Darkness men and women naked and bare, deprived of clothing and food, their bodies beaten with iron rods, enduring unbearable suffering. They are dragged through the Three Rivers, drawing and hauling floodwaters to irrigate the Four Waterways, toiling day and night without rest. For what crimes in life did they transgress? Which scriptures or precepts did they violate to suffer such retribution? What meritorious deeds must be performed to redeem them, allowing them to be reborn into the human realm?"

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Upper Realm replied: "In their past lives, these beings did not believe in the Great Dao, doubted and defiled the scriptures, and violated the Ten Precepts, thus receiving their present retribution as forced laborers in Heaven. Without the illumination of the true statutes and deliverance, they shall remain bound for ten thousand kalpas without return. To liberate them, one must offer thirty-two feet of azure-patterned silk and a golden dragon, presenting them at the celestial palaces and bureaus to redeem their past transgressions and deliver the imprisoned dead souls from the Nine Dark Realms. For twelve hours day and night, burn incense and light lamps to illuminate the heavens, the River of Accumulated Darkness, and the Nine Dark Realms, allowing the toiling spirits to behold the light, receive deliverance, and return to the Gate of Blessings."

The Most High Lord Dao turned and bowed, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "Today, seated in attendance, I have heard the Flying Celestial Beings of the Ten Directions expound upon the superior methods for uprooting karmic transgressions. The living are delivered, the dead are restored, and within the Nine Dark Realms, all receive illumination. In future lives, men and women who cultivate goodness and faith shall attain this blessing. Through endless kalpas, their affinities shall flourish without cease, their bodies attaining immortality. With incense and lamps offered in devotion, their households shall prosper, guarded by the Three Realms, attended by the myriad spirits. Demons shall be subdued, and a thousand calamities averted. The Great Dao unfolds, its boundless virtue resplendent, towering and unmatched. Rejoicing in the blessings bestowed upon future generations, I cannot contain my joy and have composed this hymn."

At that moment, all the heavens as one voiced their approval.

**Hymn of Everlasting Joy by the Most High Wisdom**
In the Dragon Han, the people were pure,
Their hearts in harmony with the natural Way.
The five emotions knew no strife,
Their forms possessed undying spirits.
The Dragon Gate severed the long river,
The Three Paths no longer enslaved men.
Resting in the Five Dao sanctuaries,
The Mountain of Swords and Blades was abolished.
Vast and boundless within the Primordial Han,
The Nine Dark Realms held no suffering souls.
No wailing of the dead was heard,
Only words of everlasting joy.
No long-night ghosts were seen,
Only soaring celestial immortals.
What joy surpasses this world’s joy?
Thus I chant this hymn of jubilation.
The heavens bowed in celebration,
Together proclaiming this blessed kalpa.
In the Seven Jeweled Grove of the Mysterious Capital,
The Ten Heavens enveloped in radiant mist,
Purple clouds observed the numinous glow,
Cloudscapes adorned the jade peaks.
Above stood the Hall of Blessings,
Its palaces and chambers arrayed in splendor.
All were faithful devotees,
True immortals and celestial families.
The Three Realms opened the path of mystery,
The Five Paths purified, free from deviation.
Good roots arise from karmic conditions,
Accumulated merit yields abundant blessings.
Karmic ties follow in succession,
The Great Dao is surely not in vain.
No man lives ten thousand years,
All share the same origin as the kalpa.
In this joyous world of harmony,
Words become songs of celebration.
Gazing upon this boundless realm,
What shall become of the ages to come?

At the Cypress Mound Abode within the Grotto of Radiant Yang, the Most High Lord Dao received the precepts and beheld the celestial halls of blessings, where the karmic kin of countless kalpas dwelled in carefree non-action, their clothing and sustenance naturally provided, their bodies radiant with light, accompanied by flying immortals. Free from sorrow and grief, unaware of suffering and hardship, he was moved by both sorrow and joy, and thus composed the *Hymn of Everlasting Joy*.

**Hymn of the Suffering Spirits by the Most High Wisdom**
Born into the realm of suffering spirits,
They revolve through the courts of the Five Paths.
The Nine Dark Realms enclose the eternal night,
Through countless kalpas, no light shines.
Blade mountains and sword trees stand tall,
Their poisoned edges gleaming sharp.
No flocks of birds gather,
Only the cries of suffering souls are heard.
The whirling winds sway the long branches,
Mournful echoes drift through the cold courts.
Above, the mountain-treading souls,
Toil ceaselessly, without respite.
Hungry, they eat the crooked spring’s charcoal,
Thirsty, they drink the smelting fire’s essence.
Dragged through the Three Paths,
Do they even know their names?
Pitying their ignorance of fate,
Alas, how it grieves the heart.
Karma arises from good and evil,
Virtue and vice surely stem from the mind.
The wheel of rebirth never ceases,
Like sound that never fades from echo.
The Nine Dark Realms hold primordial records,
Through ten thousand kalpas, they seek one another.
The source of endless icy cold,
The long night pierced by layers of darkness.
No halls of blessings are seen,
Only forests of destitute ghosts.
The long river cannot be dammed,
Suffering souls cling and wail.
Their solitary cries reach the edge of the sword,
Their lamentations fall upon the blade peaks.
These forms are no longer forms,
Alas, how it wounds the heart.

The Most High Lord Dao, journeying through the Eight Gates, beheld the prisons of the underworld, their layered barriers, the Three Rivers and Nine Streams, the mountains of blades and forests of swords, the imprisoned hungry ghosts, the toiling dead souls, dragged through the mire and ashes, their forms no longer recognizable. Unable to bear the sight, he was moved to sorrow and thus composed the *Hymn of the Suffering Spirits*.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord Dao: "Today, together with the perfected beings of the Ten Directions and the boundless assembly of great sages, we share the joy of this kalpa, a happiness beyond compare. Our words cannot express it fully, nor can our hearts comprehend it entirely. The teachings of good and evil, the precepts and statutes, have been revealed without concealment. The heavens rejoice as one, proclaiming the Dharma, universally delivering the boundless multitudes. How fortunate are those born in this age, encountering these scriptural teachings! By cultivating goodness, their lives shall be long, free from untimely death. When their final day arrives, they shall ascend directly to the celestial halls, their karmic ties unbroken, all attaining the true Dao.

Yet I pity the men and women of future degenerate ages, who shall follow the turning of the kalpa, their hearts constrained by urgency, unknowingly committing sins. Their karmic roots shall sprout, casting them into the Five Paths. Once they stumble from the path of faith, there shall be no return. They shall wander through the Three Paths and the Five Sufferings, amidst blade mountains and sword trees, where blood flies for ten thousand miles, through endless icy cold, where destitute souls fill the night, their wails and lamentations grieving the heart. Alas for their misfortune, once gone, they cannot return.

Thus, I expound this scripture for the faithful of future generations, opening the bridge to liberation, enabling all to sever the roots of evil karma, enter the light, and return to goodness. Those who wholeheartedly revere and uphold it shall attain its blessings; those who do not believe shall incur its misfortune.

After my departure, this text shall return to the Seven Jeweled Mysterious Terrace within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Great Luo. In accordance with the statutes of the Illuminated True Mystery, after forty thousand kalpas, it shall descend to the world to teach and deliver the heavens and humanity."

Now, I make this known to you, that you may clearly comprehend it.

At that moment, the assembly of sages and the Most High Dao Lord rejoiced, bowed in reverence, and withdrew.

The *Upper Scroll on the Roots of Transgression in the Daoist Canon of the Numinous Treasure’s Wisdom* from the *Supreme Cavernous Mystery* thus concludes.
