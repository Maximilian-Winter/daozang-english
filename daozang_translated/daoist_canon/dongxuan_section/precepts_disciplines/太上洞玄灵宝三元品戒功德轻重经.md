# 太上洞玄灵宝三元品戒功德轻重经

*The Scripture on the Merits and Gravity of the Three Primal Precepts from the Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*

Thus spake the Heavenly Worthy:

In the Upper Primal Realm, the Celestial Officials of the First Order, where primordial qi first congeals and the Three Luminaries dawn in radiance, the essences of azure, yellow, and white qi coalesce to establish the Three Palaces of the Upper Primal. The first of these is named the Supreme Cavernous Mystery Primordial Yang Seven-Jewel Purple Tenuity Palace. Therein resides the azure primordial yang qi, governing the Perfected of the Upper Realms, the Celestial August Emperor of the Jade Void, the Divine Sovereigns of the Heavens, and the exalted deities of the highest sanctity.

This palace is arrayed in fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five myriad, five myriad layers, enveloped likewise in fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five myriad, five myriad layers of azure yang qi. Within it, the divine immortals and their retinues number fifty-five myriad, five thousand five hundred fifty-five myriad, five myriad, as do their multitudes—all formed from the spontaneous coagulation of azure primordial qi into human form. Their raiment is of azure feathered flight-garments.

Within the Purple Tenuity Palace lies the Talisman of Prolonged Life. When this talisman is inscribed and placed in the eight directions, the qi of those regions rushes forth in response, manifesting as human beings. Should the talisman be destroyed and burned in fire, the people dissolve with the smoke, reverting to qi. None but those who have attained the Dao with golden tablets and jade names may wield it. Its script emerges but once every forty thousand kalpas, overseen by the Fire Officials of the Great Yang and enacted by the Upper Repository of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery.

The Purple Tenuity Palace contains three bureaus: left, right, and central. The Left Bureau governs life, examined by the Fire Officials of the Great Yang. The Right Bureau governs death, examined by the Water Officials of the Great Yin. The Central Bureau governs the records of life, death, transgressions, and the trials of the Wind Blade.

Each bureau commands a retinue of ninety million officials, collectively administering the twelve departments of life, death, transgressions, and blessings:

Each department comprises one hundred twenty examining officials, one thousand two hundred examining scribes, twelve thousand examining soldiers, and one hundred twenty thousand examining scholars. They oversee the registers of the Upper Perfected who have attained the Dao in past kalpas, those yet to attain it in the present blessings, and the merits and transgressions of all men and women among the common folk.

Major trials occur every three years, intermediate trials every nine years, and minor trials every twenty-four years. Major blessings are bestowed every three years, intermediate blessings every nine years, and minor blessings every twenty-four years. Transgressions and blessings are meted out together, merits and demerits recompensed alike. The ledgers of good and evil are stored within the Seven-Jewel Casket of the Illuminated Perfection Jade Coffer in the Cavernous Mystery Capital.

In the Upper Primal Realm, the left palace of the primordial yellow qi of the Central Yellow is named the Supreme Cavernous Mystery Primordial Yellow Supreme Ultimate Left Palace. Therein resides the primordial yellow qi of the Origin, governing the registers of life for the Upper Perfected who have attained the Dao in past kalpas, those yet to attain it, and all men and women among the common folk.

Each department comprises one hundred twenty examining officials, one thousand two hundred examining scribes, twelve thousand examining soldiers, and one hundred twenty thousand examining scholars. They oversee the comprehensive registers of the Upper Perfected who have attained the Dao in past kalpas, those yet to attain it in the present blessings, and all common men and women whose names are to be erased from the immortal records due to transcendence or death, recording their dates. They determine the ranks of immortals, the retribution of sins and blessings, following the same time limits as those of the Purple Tenuity Palace. The registers are sealed within the Northern Repository Case of the Nine Dark Jade Coffer of the Everlasting Night Bureau.

The three palaces of the First-Rank Upper Primordial Heavenly Officials—Left, Right, and Central—each govern twelve departments, totaling thirty-six departments. They universally administer the natural titles within the Supreme Void of Primordial Yang, collectively overseeing the registers of merits and demerits, life and death, of the Upper Perfected who have attained the Dao in past kalpas, those yet to attain it in the present blessings, and all common men and women.

On these days, the examining officials of the Three Bureaus—Yin-Yang, Water-Fire, and Wind Blade—and the thirty-six departments’ officials and subordinates meticulously calculate the weight of merits, demerits, sins, and transgressions, along with their time limits. Each matter is distinctly recorded in the Green and Black Registers and presented to the Purple Tenuity and Supreme Ultimate Palaces—Left, Right, and Central. Those whose merits are complete and who are destined for immortality are recorded in the Purple Tenuity Palace. Those who have accumulated good deeds, reverence, and faith, and who uphold the Great Dao, are recorded in the Supreme Ultimate Left Palace. Those who have amassed evil and are unfit for the Dao, whose sins warrant death, are recorded in the Supreme Ultimate Right Palace.

For the Purple Tenuity Palace, names are inscribed in the Golden Register of Jade Records, and the Earthly Bureau is notified to erase their mortal records, while the Water Bureau removes their names from the registers. They are protected across the Three Realms and may not be violated, as decreed in the Writ of the Lady of Azure. For the Supreme Ultimate Left Palace, names are inscribed in the Azure Primordial Register and the Jade Calendar of Longevity in the Southern Upper Realm. The Water and Earth Bureaus are notified to provide separate protection, ensuring no violation, as decreed in the Writ of the Lady of Azure. For the Supreme Ultimate Right Palace, names are recorded in the Black Register and transferred to the Everlasting Night’s Nine Dark Bureau. The Water and Earth Bureaus are notified to seize and record the sinful souls, delivering them to the Execution Department for servitude. If the merits, demerits, and qi of the examined are not yet balanced, the matter is referred to the Three Assemblies for further review and rectification.

They also oversee the long-term penal servitude of the dead, the karmic assembly periods of the myriad spirits, fish, dragons, whales, and other beings in the water palaces.

The great sages of the various heavens, the perfected ones of wondrous conduct, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the jade pivots and armillary spheres, as well as the immortals, perfected ones, jade maidens, and officials of the Five Peaks on earth, along with all the honored spirits, regularly descend on the days of the Great Year, the jiazi, and the gengshen to the Yang Valley, the Clear Cold, and the Northern Fengdu Palaces. There, they gather to review the registers of life and death from the Nine Rivers, the Four Seas, the Three Rivers, the Huai, and the Ji; the penal servitude terms of the long-night dead souls; and the great and small karmic assemblies of the spirits in the water palaces.

On these days, all the spirits of the water palaces invariably arrive in solemn assembly. The examining officials of the three palaces, nine bureaus, and forty-two departments each hold the blue and black registers of life and death, the penal servitude terms of the long-source dead souls, and the affairs of the great and small karmic assemblies of the myriad spirits in the waters. They distinguish between the blue and black registers and report to the three palaces.

On the fifteenth day of the first month, the seventh month, and the tenth month, they present the registers of merits, transgressions, transgressions, blessings, life, and death to the three palaces of heaven. Those fated to live are reported to the Left Palace; those destined for immortality, to the Central Palace; and those doomed to die, to the Right Palace. The matters of penal servitude, long-term labor, and the great and small karmic assemblies of the myriad spirits in the waters are reported according to their origins, ensuring correspondence between upper and lower realms. If any qi remains unexamined or unrectified, it is submitted to the three assemblies for further examination and reporting.

The Upper Primordial’s Heavenly Officials establish three palaces, three bureaus, and thirty-six departments. The Middle Primordial’s Earthly Officials establish three palaces, three bureaus, and forty-two departments. The Lower Primordial’s Water Officials establish three palaces, three bureaus, and forty-two departments. Together, the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials comprise nine palaces, nine bureaus, and one hundred twenty departments. The three ranks succeed one another, governing life, death, transgressions, blessings, and the depth of merits and transgressions, assigning penal servitude, conducting examinations, and setting time limits for days, months, and years without error.

The merits of those who cultivate immortality and the retributions for their evil deeds are each recorded by their respective examining officials according to their jurisdiction. The Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials each establish separate palaces, bureaus, and offices without limit in number—all branches and designations of the offices that prohibit, inspect, and punish, impeaching those with merits, transgressions, or sins, and reporting them to the proper bureaus. The one hundred twenty bureaus are the principal bureaus of the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials.

Within the human body, there are likewise three palaces, six viscera, one hundred twenty joints, and thirty-six thousand spirits. When the body commits evil, the body’s spirits also report it to the Three Officials. When the body performs good deeds, its name is recorded for transcendence. Life and death, sin and blessing—none fail to originate first with the body’s spirits, which respond in resonance according to nature.

Humans are born by receiving qi, and qi coalesces into spirit. If one can nurture qi, the spirit will abide long; if one inwardly contemplates and guards the true, the true will not depart from the body. Those who obtain the talisman of the Great Mystery for extending life will see the thirty-six thousand spirits coalesce qi and manifest form, jointly elevating the body to ascend to heaven in broad daylight, riding cloud chariots into the void. If essence is lost and qi dissipated, the myriad spirits scatter and flee; the spirit wanders, qi disperses, and the empty corpse perishes.

In the Heavenly Official’s one palace and central bureau, there are twelve bureaus; in the Earthly Official’s one palace and central bureau, fourteen bureaus; in the Water Official’s one palace and central bureau, fourteen bureaus.

These sixty transgressions are overseen by the twelve bureaus of the Heavenly Official’s Right Palace and Right Mansion, the fourteen bureaus of the Earthly Official’s Right Palace and Right Mansion, the fourteen bureaus of the Water Official’s Right Palace and Right Mansion, and the Examiners of the Great Yin Water Official.

The Three Primordials’ Precept Categories each contain sixty precepts, totaling one hundred eighty precepts, each governed by the yin and yang, left and right, water and fire, wind and blade officials’ examination registers.

The fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Primordial’s Precept Examination Day.
The fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Primordial’s Precept Examination Day.
The fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Primordial’s Precept Examination Day.

On these three days of the year, the earthly and Five Emperors’ sacred mountains, the divine officials of the Three Realms, and all the water palaces’ Three Officials administer punishments. Without bound or depth, near or far, great or small, all divine spirits ascend together to the Upper Three Heavens’ Mysterious Capital Three Primordials’ Palace, bearing the records of those who have attained the Dao on heaven and earth, those who have not yet attained it but dwell in blessings, and the karmic roots and ledgers of the living and the dead, their merits and transgressions, their light and heavy deeds, all reported to Heaven.

On that day, the Boundless Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Directions’ Great Sage Assembly, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Supreme Jade Void Perfected Great Spirits, the Boundless Great Dao’s Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Masters, the Five Elder Emperors, the Southern and Northern Poles and Eastern and Western Flowers, the Nine Numinous Perfected Mothers, the Southern Upper Primordial Lady, and the Jade Maiden of Supreme Harmony all arrive together at the Three Primordials’ Palace. Once the assembly of sages is gathered, the flying immortals, divine immortals, Perfected Ones, Jade Maidens, the Longevity Directors of Life and Death, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the celestial sun, moon, and stars, the Jade Armillary Sphere, and all divine beings arrive in solemn array.

The Three Primordials’ left, right, and central palaces’ Three Officials and nine mansions’ one hundred twenty bureaus, the yin and yang, left and right, water and fire, wind and blade examination officials, each calculate the ledgers of life and death in heaven and on earth, cross-examining one another. Those with good deeds are recorded in the Azure Register; those with heavy transgressions are inscribed in the Black Register. Each is reported to the Three Officials with their merits and transgressions, good and evil, without the slightest error.

On that day, those who follow the Three Primordials’ method of repentance, purify themselves with fasting, burn incense, and act in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations for one hundred days will have their earthly dwellings specially guarded, their gates and defenses secured. After eight years of practice, they will all receive the Three Officials’ protection and recommendation, their names inscribed in the Azure Register, and they will attain the rank of Upper Immortal, never losing their destined place in the Dao.

The Dao Lord bows his head and respectfully asks the Heavenly Worthy: What determines the weight of merits, the stages of deliverance, and the order of precedence? Past-life heavy debts are repaid by oneself and may extend to one’s descendants. The evil one commits in this life brings retribution upon oneself and may also mislead the deceased. Now, as we see among the common people—men and women—those who suffer in this life, enduring all manner of hardships and a hundred afflictions, unable to free themselves.

Moreover, we witness the tormented forms and souls of the deceased, dragged and tossed amidst the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings, forever bound to the Long River’s icy courts, where wind and blade torment them across ten thousand kalpas without release. Scriptures and transmissions speak variously: some say the evil of past lives brings calamity upon descendants; others, that one’s own grave sins mislead the departed ancestors; still others, that good and evil each have their karmic counterparts, and that the roots of life and death, sin and blessing, lie in one’s own fate. If such karmic retribution—good or ill—belongs to each individual alone, why then do we speak of delayed or extended consequences? Yet it is also said that without the merit of deliverance, the condemned souls of past lives have no means of liberation. Once merit is established, the gates of life and death open wide. But if each bears their own karmic ties, and those who commit evil perish only to sink into eternal darkness for ten thousand kalpas, how could they ever amass such great merit to redeem themselves? If descendants build merit on behalf of the deceased, this would differ little in principle from the notion of delayed consequences. My understanding is shallow and narrow; I cannot fathom this. Since the Heavenly Worthy has inaugurated the teaching of great forgiveness, illuminating both life and death, it is fitting that the hidden and the manifest be made entirely clear, lest the ignorant remain confused by these two doctrines.

Having been elevated to this office and entrusted with its oversight, I must proclaim the true Dharma and enlighten future generations. May the sound of this teaching flow through all heavens, enduring for billions of kalpas, preserving the Orthodox Unity, so that all beings—living and dead—may receive its blessings, and the light of great forgiveness be made manifest. For this reason, I humbly present this inquiry, beseeching the Heavenly Worthy to grant a measure of compassion.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy replied with joy: Excellent, excellent. Your question is of profound importance. Though you have penetrated the cavernous depths of the numinous, the hidden sources remain not fully exhausted; though you have surveyed the vast expanse, the Dragon Han remains obscure. Qi cannot be exhausted, numbers cannot be fathomed; death gives way to rebirth, darkness to light. The turning of heaven and earth is like a wheel’s revolution; the arising and ceasing of human life is like a shadow following form—thus, it is difficult to bring to an end. Qi flows in ceaseless succession, giving rise to manifold conditions of birth. Good and evil, fortune and misfortune—each has its root in fate. It is neither heaven nor earth, nor even other people, but precisely the mind. The mind is spirit. The body is not truly ours. That by which we live comes from the void and the natural, dwelling temporarily in the womb, transformed and born. The parents who conceived us are not our original parents; our true parents are not here. The love and reverence we owe our parents are supreme and without equal. Yet the parents who bore us in this life are but the karmic conditions of our temporary lodging, the source of nurture and upbringing to whom we repay gratitude with propriety, calling them father and mother.

Thus, the body we receive is not truly our own. It is but a dwelling, a temporary abode, a shelter for the self. We cling to it as form, manifesting existence and nonexistence. Therefore, those who attain the Dao no longer possess a body. When I have no body, what suffering can I know? Suffering arises only because I have a body. With a body, a hundred afflictions arise; without a body, one enters the natural, aligns with the Dao, and body and spirit become one. When body and spirit unite, it is the true body, returning to the original parents and attaining the Dao—free from suffering, never to die. Even if one enters nirvana, the spirit departs while the form does not perish to ash. In the end, it returns to its origin, never parted. If the body commits a hundred evils and dies after exhausting its sins, this is called death. Death is dissolution, a return to the parents of the borrowed womb. If the karmic conditions are not yet fulfilled, it cannot return to the true parents. The spirit, bound to toil and drudgery, the form reduced to dust, the dust scattered and transformed into *shuang*. When the soul is liberated, it merges with the *shuang*, and thus soul and *shuang* transform as one, gaining rebirth and becoming human again. Body and spirit follow one another, never parting.

In this way, good and evil each have their counterparts, belonging to the individual alone. How can blame be laid upon ancestors or descendants? Before the Dragon Han, extending to the Red Clarity, the old texts state that life and death arise from the self, neither extending upward nor flowing downward; sin and blessing are borne by the individual alone. After the Red Clarity, reaching the High Antiquity, the human heart was corrupted: men and women lost their purity, jealousy and harm arose, and they turned to mutual destruction. The heart could not stand firm, drawing in ancestors above and descendants below as witnesses, swearing oaths before the gods. Yet they lacked self-trust, violating their vows, leading the Three Officials to record their transgressions. Upon death, they became ghosts, misleading the departed above and burdening descendants below, entangling all in calamity, great and small, without end, bringing ruin to the entire clan. Such evil-doers bring great misfortune upon themselves. The clear teachings of the Dharma state that they shall never be equaled. Those of insight accumulate merit, seeking it within themselves, not from others. Are the ancient texts of the Perfected not to be trusted?

The Heavenly Worthy further addressed the Most High Dao Lord: The Dao of great compassion places the deliverance of others first. Without merit, there is no reward; without virtue, no promotion; without faith, no deliverance; without practice, no immortality. Those who establish merit do so for the sake of heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries, the sovereign, the myriad people, their ancestors, their family, all beings, and themselves. The scriptures say: If you wish to deliver yourself, first deliver others. If all others are not delivered, you yourself will never be delivered. Great compassion is vast and boundless, extending mercy without end, revered by heaven and humanity—how much more so for the seven generations of ancestors? Sin and blessing may not be transferred, but when it comes to merit, there is the bond of karmic gratitude. Sincere remorse moves heaven to reverse one’s fate; the power of single-minded devotion opens the way for both humans and spirits. How much more so for those who, born of borrowed qi and nurtured in the womb, owe their existence and upbringing to others? When love and affection run deep, how can one not strive to build great merit, to deliver and repay the destitute souls?

Since the Dragon Han era through to the Red Clarity, those who attained the Dao and abide in present blessings—whose households are pure and noble, whose good affinities extend into future lives—have all accumulated merit and piled up virtue, their achievements moving the various heavens to bestow reciprocal rewards. As for those bound in the long night of the Nine Dark Realms, whose karmic debts have been resolved, none have escaped through anything but the power of merit: ransoming, delivering, and returning them to the human realm. In the Southern Ridge’s Vermilion Palace and the Nine Capitals’ upper registers, all their names are recorded—such is the principle of karmic retribution, precise to the finest detail. The reckoning of years and months is utterly clear.

The Dao Lord bowed in reverence: Having now heard the Heavenly Worthy expound the karmic correspondences of merit and retribution, all doubts have instantly dissolved; my heart rejoices and my mind is at ease, with no lingering obstructions. I shall diligently apply my heart to propagating the Great Dharma, universally revealing it to all the people—men, women, and children—throughout the boundless worlds of the various heavens, that all may comply and fully perceive its truth.

The Most High Dao Lord addressed the Heavenly Worthy: Since you have deigned to awaken and resolve all doubts, I now inquire which among the merits should be prioritized. Are the revealed true statutes, the supreme wisdom of the highest grade for ransoming the roots of sin, sufficient in themselves, or are there additional methods? Does the solemn vow to ransom sins, the instruction of the young and ignorant, the establishment of quiet abodes, the offering of reverence to masters and treasures, the distribution of incense and oil, the lighting of lamps to illuminate the night, the cultivation of good thoughts, the deliverance of sentient beings, the practice of compassion, loyalty, and filial piety, the relief of the destitute, and the feeding of the hundred birds—all without stint—carry varying degrees of merit? Are they of the same rank, or do they differ in nobility and humility? I humbly request your instruction.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: In the establishment of merit, there is no great nor small, no high nor low—its power is equal. The weight of karmic retribution depends on the heart of the practitioner. If one’s heart remains unwavering in diligence, enduring hardship without retreat, such merit is beyond measure, and its virtue beyond naming. Yet if one merely possesses sincere intention but does not persist in practice, one may only escape sin without attaining further reward. Those who act without true heart, offering empty gestures, gain nothing from their efforts.

The wealthy, cherishing their treasures, refuse to distribute or ransom the roots of sin; they merely contemplate the Dao in their hearts, hoping for great reward—such efforts are futile and profitless. How could the heavenly Dao demand one’s wealth, compelling merit-making? It observes the stinginess of the heart and examines the sincerity of intent: if one possesses but does not give, what can one seek? Yet the poor who arouse the heart, whose will is firm and bright, who toil without complaint in the master’s gate—such individuals are seen by the Dao, and their merit moves the various heavens. Thus, offering wealth corresponds to the heart, and offering the heart corresponds to wealth—their merit is equal.

The ancients sought the heart; the degenerate age seeks wealth. The ancients attained immortality through nothing but the heart; the degenerate age attains deliverance through nothing but wealth. Why is this so? In the degenerate age, wealth is prized over the Dao. If a thousand pounds of gold and a scroll of immortal scripture were placed in a barren mountain, the people of this age would covet the gold, not the scripture. Gold can only bring bodily affliction; the scripture can extend one’s life. One ought to know this, yet one cannot escape stinginess and greed. If one cannot free oneself from greed and stinginess, how can one fully realize the Dao? Thus, it is not that the Dao fails to flourish among people—this is what is meant.

The statutes of luminous truth and the supreme wisdom of the highest grade for ransoming the roots of sin, applied to the realm of birth and death, are of the utmost gravity. As for scholars who have not yet entered samadhi, dwelling amid the clamor of the world, how can they avoid gains and losses? In every action and deed, sin and blessing proceed together. Thus, the Three Bureaus, Nine Courts, One Hundred Twenty Offices, and the left and right officials of yin and yang, water and fire, who oversee human gains and losses—those who accumulate good merit have their names recorded in the left registers, while those who commit evil have theirs in the right. Each is assessed according to the years, months, days, and the nearness or distance of their merit, with the weight of days determining the gravity. Karmic retribution converges like the meeting of tidal waters, its appointed time inevitable, with not a single error. The difference lies only in the weight and proximity of the reckoning.

I now declare this to you so that you may diligently proclaim it, that all good men and women of future generations may universally know that heaven and earth possess an unerring resonance, and that these words are truly real. I now transmit the method of atonement for the Three Primes. The ancient texts of the Primordial Dao of the Origin were concealed in the Three Prime Palaces, revealed but once in ten thousand kalpas, never passed down to the lower worlds. Those who behold their titles may uproot their karmic roots and untie their bonds of their own accord. Treasure and practice them, and great fortune will surely follow. Treat them lightly or leak their secrets, and calamity will strike, annihilating one’s clan. With utter sincerity, deeply guard these statutes.

The Dao Lord rejoiced, bowed his head, and paid homage. At that moment, all the heavens simultaneously proclaimed their approval, bowed their heads, and received the teaching. Thus concludes *The Scripture on the Weight of Merit in the Three Prime Precepts of the Upper Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.
