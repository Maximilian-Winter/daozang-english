**The Supreme Purity Inner Scripture of the Great Cavern of Primordial Perfection**

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly King of the Supreme Purity and the Lofty Perfected, together with the Five Venerable Thearchs, the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, the Great Sage Assemblies of the Ten Directions, and the boundless hosts of the Utmost Perfected Lords and Elders, were gathered in the □ Ling Residence within the Scarlet Bright World, seated amidst the Fragrant Garden beneath the Long Mulberry.

The Heavenly King turned his chariot, and the hosts of heaven descended from their mats. Then, clouds and mists surged thickly, the four seasons merged into darkness, and for nine days and nine nights, the mysterious yin did not disperse. Heaven and earth were without light, as if before the Dragon Han era, deep and obscure.

The Five Venerable Perfected Ones advanced and bowed, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "Today, as we attend your seat, we have never before witnessed such a sight. As the Heavenly Worthy departs on his journey, the hosts of heaven turn their chariots, the Lofty Perfected and Thearchs, the divine immortals and jade maidens, the sun, moon, and stars, the jade armillary sphere, the officials of the Three Realms, the mountain spirits of the Five Peaks, the water deities of rivers and seas—all spirits and numina tremble in reverence, attending and guarding the Heavenly Perfected.

Yet now, the heavens are clear and the qi serene; the wind does not stir the branches; the earth is free of flying dust; rivers and seas are still; mountains and peaks conceal their mists. The seasons are harmonious, and the qi is settled, causing the living and the dead to rejoice together. Yet the light of heaven is sealed, and the bright day is shrouded in darkness. Heavenly beings are alarmed, and the four assemblies are uneasy. We do not know the reason for this, nor why it has come to pass. We humbly beseech your instruction, that all may see the light, and that all beings may universally attain peace and security."

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Lofty Perfected and Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning, declared: "Today, as we share this seat, our joy is rare and hard to encounter. Heaven has manifested auspicious signs: the natural jade scripts and golden writings shine brilliantly. Yet the obstruction of heavenly light at the outset of its unfolding has caused the day to darken, a celebration of this time’s convergence, seldom seen before.

Now, I shall reveal to the four assemblies the wondrous and true mysteries of heaven, the correct names and true taboos of the Nine Heavens, to deliver those who are destined to attain the Perfected and unite with the Dao. Let all concentrate their minds, close their eyes, and prostrate upon the earth."

Thereupon, the Great Sages and Lofty Immortals, the hosts of the Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, and the innumerable multitudes, beyond reckoning, prostrated simultaneously to receive the command.

In an instant, the heavenly qi cleared, the darkness dissipated, and five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions. Suddenly, a celestial scripture emerged spontaneously in the void, each character a *zhang* in size, naturally manifesting in the empty sky above, within the five-colored light of the mysterious void. Its resplendent patterns and eight-cornered rays dazzled the eyes, making it impossible to gaze upon directly.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies and the boundless hosts of the Ten Directions: "This is the *Numinous Scripture of the True Taboos of the Nine Heavens*, the harmonized qi spontaneously born of the void, the profound and abstruse teachings spoken by the Nine Heavens, difficult to fathom in detail.

In the past, I entrusted the oral instructions to the Perfected Ones, concealing them in the Golden Flower Chamber of the Cavern Palace. Today, I reveal them to you, that you may swiftly attain the Perfected and unite with the Dao, whether in the morning or by evening. Be vigilant and discreet, cultivate and practice them."

The Primordial Beginning addressed the Most High Lord of the Great Dao: "The wondrous Dao should be made clear. You may now transcribe and elucidate its correct sounds, so that the August Dao may flow freely, its blessings extending to the ten directions, pervading the eight extremities and the six directions within and beyond. If, within the six directions, there appear auspicious signs in response to the turning of the kalpa, or those with profound karmic affinities destined to unite with the Perfected, you should report this to the Upper Immortals, who will then address the Heavenly Worthy."

The Primordial Heavenly King said: "I shall forthwith ride the currents and spread the waves, hoisting the banner upon the wind. Since the turning of the wheel through countless kalpas, I have repeatedly attended your seat, teaching and guiding all beings. Yet never before have I encountered such a sacred Dao as today, opening the gates of all dharmas and beholding the celestial scripture, the natural and utmost truth. Its skeletal patterns align with the charts, harmonizing with the fivefold sounds of harmony—beyond the comprehension of foolish minds and shallow thoughts.

Now that I have been granted a place in this assembly, I rejoice in gazing upon the mystery and dare not conceal my feelings. I shall follow the model, traversing the eight extremities and the six directions within and beyond, transmitting what I have seen in the scripture, hoping that even one in ten thousand may attain union."

He bowed his head in reverence and received the command, then composed this hymn:

The Primordial Beginning opens the Great Existence,
And the boundless heavens shine resplendently.
Wondrous is the Dao of the Dragon Han,
Where the Eight Assemblies compose the scriptures.
Resplendent, they soar within the void,
Their flowing light filling the courts of the Three Realms.
The divine Perfected initiate the numinous gathering,
And jade characters arise in response to the scene.
The Heavenly Perfected commune with the wondrous essence,
The five harmonies unite to form the chapters.
Brightly rings the jade sound,
Wafting and gathering in the Supreme Purity.
Opening deliverance without end or beginning,
The Nine Dark Realms receive illumination.
Majestic is the Great Dharma Gate,
Teaching and guiding all beings.
Its merit is beyond reckoning,
And joyous celebration endures for ten thousand ages.

The true names and styles of the Highest Nine Heavens’ True Kings above deliver those destined for the Dao, but not those destined for Middle Immortals. Seal your lips in reverent cultivation, conceal them within the Golden Flower Palace of the Cavernous Chamber—do not recklessly show them to others. Should you leak the secret names, your body will sink into the Nine Springs. Be vigilant and prudent in your practice.

The *Dao-Delivering Immortal Talisman of the Eastern Azure Emperor’s Jade Office and Primordial Numinous Spontaneity*, with the true name and style: *Qugengsheng*.

The names and styles of the Jade Offices of the Nine Heavens and Five Directions above are concealed in the Nine Heavens, where they gather the true qi of the Ten Directions and harmonize with the spontaneous qi of the Five Directions, congealing and refining their essence to form true names. These are worn within the Thirty-Two Heavens to examine and select those with the bone structure of destined immortals. According to the established standards of the Mysterious Capital, they swear oaths upon golden silk, pledging their hearts to the scriptures. Only then are they informed. Those who bear the true names and styles of the Nine Heavens’ True Kings upon their persons are certain to attain Highest Immortality—not in months or fortnights, but through sincere devotion and unwavering diligence. Conceal them deeply within the Golden Flower Cavernous Palace, seal your lips in reverent cultivation, and never transmit them recklessly. Should you leak the true names, you will be tried and your body destroyed. Scholars of the highest learning, be meticulous and prudent in your practice.

The *Highest Lord of the Yellow Center’s Regulated Qi and Ninefold Microcosmic Mysterious City’s Essence-Infused Great Harmony* presides over the *Eternal Non-Passing Nine Heavens’ Long Ladder*, with the *Numinous Attendants of the Central Primordial* and the *Red Child of the Upper Primordial* approaching to serve the *Elder of the Lower Primordial*, commanding a thousand spirits. The *Primordial Flying Perfected of the Mysterious Upper* and the *Life-Nourishing Highest Primordial Lord* augment the *Heavenly Essence of the Purple Tenuity* and the *Vermilion Palace*, proclaiming the *Great Peace Fierce Beasts* as the four guardians of your form. We, the nine-mouthed, long-fanged *Heavenly Hounds* with four eyes, devour tigers, level rivers, consume golden pillars, and stir the eight winds to blow the seas asunder. We strike mountains with flames, burn birds to ashes, gnaw serpents with chisel-teeth, and seize the peaks of ten thousand fathers. The eight-patterned serpents of the stellar years hiss at the Dipper’s *Jiuqiu*, while the ten-thousand-toothed axes and fierce-eyed beasts crunch stones, seize leopards, and dance with lion-gold heads to devour ghosts. The *Mountain-Shaking Thunderous Beasts* and *Heavenly Oxen* shatter mountains, while the *Despised Leaping Hundred Spirits* fly and run, clinging to the mighty. The divine beasts hasten your body, and the Highest True Elder safeguards your long life, enabling you to attain immortality and ascend the Ninefold Microcosmic Mystery.

The *Upper Perfected of the Highest Clarity and Purple Simplicity Primordial Lord* compiled these true texts as a *reversible script*. The *Highest Primordial Lord* employs this true script to deliver those in the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Purple Tenuity Upper Palace who bear the mysterious names recorded in the Celestial Registers—those destined to become Highest Immortals. It is not transmitted to Middle Immortals, and Earth Immortals are not permitted to hear of it. Without planting merit for ten thousand kalpas, with blessings flowing into this life, one will never behold it. Those who obtain it will attain Highest Immortality, their bones and flesh ascending together. This true essential scripture, transmitted to those in the Highest Clarity’s Purple Terrace and Mysterious Gate who bear golden names and jade registers, ensures immortality even if they do not study it. It is also called the *Supreme Perfected Register of Yin and Yang* and the *True Book of the Nine Streams*. This true essential scripture repels all and dispels all. To study the Dao of Highest Immortality, one must receive and wear it—do not recklessly show it to others, lest you incur the trial of the Wind Blade, in strict accordance with the statutes of the *Four Poles’ Luminous Regulations*.

Here ends the *Cavernous Perfected Highest Clarity Inner Scripture*.
