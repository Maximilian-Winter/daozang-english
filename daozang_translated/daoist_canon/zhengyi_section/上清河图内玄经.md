### *The Supreme Clarity Inner Mystery Scripture of the River Chart, Scroll One*

The mysterious masters and sagely artisans, transmitting from generation to generation, have sensed this flourishing age. When its radiance wanes and fades, the cycles of good and evil alternate—now declining, now rising; sinking, then reviving; severed, yet reconnecting. Arrogance and negligence forever sever good causes, while single-minded reverence and secrecy nurture the growth of virtue. Through virtue, one may perceive the Dao’s response, and where the response gathers, anomalies arise. Anomalies lead to communion with the divine, and divine masters bequeath sacred texts—secret graphs and essential writings—naturally manifesting to cleanse filth and dispel dust. Silent recognition and adherence bring longevity and transcendence, delivering the self and saving all beings. The Three Vehicles unfold in mutual exposition, neither the hidden nor the manifest discarded. Those who defy the Dao sink into ruin, and the suffering of ruin is grievous. Each should heed this warning, remaining vigilant to the end as at the beginning, for only then do they align with the Dao.

All natural true writings exist inherently in the void. Thus, they may soar or sink, conceal or reveal. Dragons, horses, tortoises, and fish bear the charts and images, all born from the beginningless, emerging in response to karmic resonance. Their manifestations vary, yet only virtue is their companion. Those who attain them come later, though the writings have long preceded them. What is obtained today is shared with those who receive them—all inscribed on jade and gold tablets, meticulously carved and secretly preserved. Mastery comes through recitation, memorization, and profound understanding. Through recitation and cultivation, one may also transcribe them in cinnabar on silk, wearing them on the body to guard against forgetfulness. In urgency, one may consult them, and their practice dispels calamities, averts misfortune, and extends blessings. With unwavering diligence over time, one ascends to the ranks of sagely transcendents.

Disciples must maintain purity and reverence when invoking the mysterious and petitioning the divine. These teachings must never be rashly transmitted to the unworthy, for reckless disclosure invites profound misfortune. All should exercise caution, upholding secrecy and adherence.

### *The Secret Taboo Names of the Great One (II)*

The Great One is the child of the Dao. When the Dao responds to the resonance of beings, it manifests the divine and generates the One. The One, through divine guidance, gives rise to and completes all things, boundless and infinite. For learners, the first step is to awaken and cultivate this, thereby attaining utmost authenticity. Authentic sages transmit it to guide later learners. Later learners, through compliance and awakening, unite with those who came before, and in this unity, they merge with the Dao.

The Three Powers, the Five Virtues, and the nine august numinous spirits arise from transformation and serve as the foundation for saving all beings. This Great One, the Three and Five, and the Nine Spirits are the ultimate source of the Dao. The One governs both the hidden and the manifest, serving as the origin of the formless. The Two represents the primordial exchange of qi, giving rise to Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Humanity possesses varying degrees of acuity, and Heaven and Earth respond accordingly, forming three grades. Separation and union produce the Five, and the tripling of three yields the Nine, wherein all transformations are complete. Refining the insubstantial into the substantial, and penetrating the interrelation of being and non-being, all depends on the perfected person.

Humanity follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows spontaneity. The Three Powers possess form and are capable of practicing the Dao. Through practicing the Dao to its ultimate end, one ascends to the level of spontaneity. Though their ranks differ, all share a single source. Thus, the spirit of the Great One is most revered and exalted, giving birth to Heaven and establishing Earth, and bringing forth all beings.

Those who do not receive the original source of the River Chart, do not wear the true graphs, do not recognize the primordial Great One, do not preserve the Five Spirits, do not uphold the Three Ones, and do not serve the Nine August Ones shall be unable to perform the Great Petition. The Great Petition’s invocations and supplications must encompass all directions. The most exalted and sacred taboo names, the hidden names of the inner spirits—without receiving them from a master, one must not rashly practice them. Practice should follow proper transmission, and transmission requires seeking a master. When the karmic conditions align to receive the text, one must adhere to the rites of the Mysterious Covenant.

Under the rites of the Mysterious Covenant, no one may arbitrarily perform any method or forcibly undertake its practice. Practicing it improperly incurs guilt, harming both oneself and others. Those who sincerely wish to practice must discreetly seek an enlightened master and obtain the rites of the Mysterious Covenant. Purify the heart and cleanse the self, and the encounter will occur naturally. Follow the precepts to prepare the petitions, and once the memorials are presented, perform the jiao offering with utmost sincerity. Be reverent and discreet, for violations invite investigation and punishment. Diligence and devotion over time bring blessings, and accumulated blessings cultivate virtue, which endures with the Dao.

The most revered spirit of the Great One has the taboo name *Wuyou Shou*, the style *Gui Huichang*, and alternate names *Jieming* and *Jipin*. Through the accumulation of virtuous causes, one may encounter these true taboo names. Silently recognize and inwardly preserve them, reciting them in secret during movement and stillness. Whatever one seeks or desires, focus the mind and direct the intention—yet one must not reveal them to others. If shared with the unworthy, both parties incur guilt. To avoid guilt and attain blessings, silently preserve them in the heart. Constantly visualize the radiant image of the Great One’s spirit, resplendent and extraordinary, by one’s side—whether sitting or walking, in leisure or urgency, day and night. Through unwavering contemplation, misfortune dissipates and fortune arrives. Over time, one may converse with the spirit, and speech and form will merge, becoming one.

Those unable to maintain constant visualization may focus on it at night, within the Sixfold Palace of the self. Enter between the eyebrows and retreat one inch to reach the Hall of Light; two inches to reach the Grotto Chamber. The Grotto Chamber lies to the south, the Hall of Light to the north—this is the Sixfold Palace, above which is the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. The Great One dwells in the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate by day and in the Sixfold Palace by night. Constantly preserving this practice brings daily renewal of merit and conduct, and demons dare not intrude. Without knowledge of the Great One, even virtuous deeds performed in vain will be corrupted by evil, and one’s cultivation will bear no fruit. For learners seeking accomplishment, preserving the One is of utmost urgency.

To accuse another’s wrongs and clarify one’s own rightness, to suppress another’s evil and extend one’s own goodness, to reproach oneself rather than resent others, to comprehend principle and each seek blessing—thus eliminating transgressions and prolonging fortune—one petitions the Heavenly Grand Commandant, the First Jade Thearch.

For those studying the offices of yin and yang to seek rank and emolument, one petitions the Heavenly Grand Steward, the Second Jade Thearch.

For those studying the Dao in hopes of becoming immortals, to communicate with spirits and attain sagehood, one petitions the Heavenly Minister of Works, the Third Jade Thearch.

To subdue the malevolence of humans and ghosts, to punish and execute the wicked and perverse in the hidden and manifest realms, one petitions the Heavenly Mobile Strike General, the Fourth Jade Thearch.

To establish merit and build virtue, to increase one’s lifespan and prolong one’s years, one petitions the Dipper Lord, the Fifth Jade Thearch.

To alleviate distress, illness, and hardship, to beseech relief and exemption, one petitions the Heavenly Grand Constancy, the Sixth Jade Thearch.

When heaven and earth are obstructed and *qi* conditions are unbalanced, one petitions the Heavenly Supreme Thearch, the Seventh Jade Thearch.

To dispel and avert manifold disasters, to ascend above and tread below, one petitions the Heavenly Jade Thearch, the Eighth Jade Thearch.

For boundless transformations to respond and save all, one petitions the Supreme Thearch, the Ninth Jade Thearch.

The inner names and hidden styles of the Nine Thearchs and Nine August Ladies—those who know them shall extend their lifespan by seven thousand years.

Each evening at dusk, one observes and visualizes the august forms and majestic radiance of the Jade Thearchs and August Ladies, recalling their inner names and hidden styles. With focused contemplation, if one succeeds in beholding the eighth and ninth stars, one’s lifespan shall become boundless.

The Nine Thearchs and Nine August Ladies are the refined essences of the nine *qi*, the numinous spirits of the Nine Heavens, the wondrous manifestations of the Nine Stars, and the awe-inspiring deities of the Nine Transformations. Men and women who study the Dao, wear and offer them in ritual, and in all activities—whether coming or going, sitting or reclining—meditate upon the true, shall find that in times of sorrow or joy, illness or hardship, they bring healing and support, cultivate the self and aid others. By constantly bearing them in mind, disasters dissolve, misfortunes scatter, and profound blessings commune with the divine.

In times of urgent need, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on bamboo or silk according to the method, face north, bow twice, and ingest it with well-flower water. After completing one cycle of nine watches, a dose of one or two measures, taken thrice, will cure illness—then one may cease. There is no other incantation; one need only hold the nine hidden names in mind. Diligently performing good deeds without slackening for nine years will assuredly grant divine transcendence.

The essentials of the Jade Thearch must not be recklessly disclosed; cultivate them in secrecy, and one shall attain the rank of Perfected Person and Primordial Lord, associating with the supreme sages—the Three Pure Ones and the Primordial Perfected of Yuanshi. Upon receiving this, inscribe it on silk and illustrate it, presenting it with reverent petition. By secretly preserving the hidden names in one’s heart, one shall achieve immortality.

When receiving the *Hetu*, one must first petition the inner names of the Nine Thearchs. After observing a nine-day, seven-day, three-day, or one-day retreat as circumstances permit, submit a petition to announce the transmission. Within three days, in a mountain retreat, altar hall, or secluded chamber—wherever it is pure and tranquil—present the memorial as follows:

The Most High Master of the Cavernous Law of [Your] Peak, the Perfected of the Nine Palaces, your humble servant [Your Name], bows twice and respectfully addresses:

The Most High Boundless Dao, the Supreme Non-Being and Perfectly True Heavenly Worthy; the Lofty Myriad Perfected, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord; the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley; the Thearchs and Emperors of all heavens; the Nine August Lords of the Posterior Saints and Nine Mysteries before the Golden Portal of the Jade Palace; the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad and Supreme Perfected; the Great Master of the Mysterious Center; and all luminous spirits within and beyond the Three Realms:

Since the beginningless kalpas, your servant has revolved through cycles of good affinity, attaining this humble and ordinary form. By grace, I have heard the wondrous Dharma, received its secret essentials, and bear its profound indebtedness. Through fortunate karmic convergence, I have traversed many lands. On the [day] of [month] in the year [year], in the [prefecture], [commandery], [county], and [village], I received from the male/female master [Name] the precious scripture of the *Hetu*, the hidden names of the Supreme Clarity, and the practice of wearing and cultivating them.

Today, I have witnessed the strictness of the Dharma’s prohibitions against reckless transmission and the requirement to seek worthy recipients, yet I cannot withhold it. Now, in the [prefecture], [commandery], [county], and [village]—or presently residing in [location]—the male/female Daoist [Name], in the mountain retreat or hall of [prefecture], [commandery], [county], and [village], has submitted a petition seeking to receive it. Their sincerity and earnestness are fully sufficient, and their worthiness is evident.

Yet your servant, being dull and obscured, has not yet attained spiritual penetration. Discerning others is ever difficult, and I dare not presume to guarantee secrecy. Thus, in strict adherence to the precepts and methods, I solemnly transmit the true teaching, announcing this sacred transmission to the mysterious overseers.

I humbly pray that the Most High Boundless Dao and Heavenly Worthy, pervading all within the Three Realms, may command all divine beings to descend with responsive numinosity, rewarding the resolve to perform good deeds. After this transmission, may the recipient reform past transgressions and cultivate future conduct, with divine Perfected protecting them and evil demons daring not intrude. May they encounter virtuous companions, subdue malevolent forces, open their hearts to enlightenment, and align their actions with the true.

Your disciple [Name], vowing to focus the mind and return to the source, shall not dare to drift with the currents. Through ascetic practice and reverent adherence, I shall first relinquish all faults, rescue my kin, and establish new merits. I swear never to scheme for glory or desire, nor indulge in treachery or licentiousness. I shall sever ties with thieves and robbers, block the paths of recklessness, refrain from killing or lewdness, falsehood or theft, arrogance or violence. I shall guard the One and preserve the Three, practice the Five and embody the Seven, and perfect the Nine Treasures and Ten Virtues. I shall purify the filth of jealousy and envy, wash away the dust of yin oppression, not suppress the worthy or betray the Way of the master, not revile or insult anyone, nor reveal essential teachings. I shall not mourn excessively in grief, nor collude with women to usurp the true, nor indulge in drunken singing to disrupt propriety, nor deceive others with harsh words, nor act cunningly toward spirits or belittle beings. I shall not rely on high status to bully the lowly, steal or alter scriptures, tamper with diagrams or decrees, slander sacred texts, create my own methods, lead others astray, or misguide the masses. For all such past transgressions, I beseech forgiveness; henceforth, I shall not dare to repeat them.

I implore the lofty sages and great deities—the Jade Dawn Great Emperor and the Great Master of the Mysterious Center—to deign to witness this. May they command the benevolent spirits of the ten directions and the officials of the Three Realms to follow the karmic sequence, protect and bestow compassion. In great mercy and magnanimity, may they perfect goodness and bestow blessings, purify the turbid, enlighten the ignorant, secure the imperiled, and reconnect the severed.

May your servant’s talents and wisdom be outstanding, spared from all disasters, with lifespan prolonged and virtue harmonized with the Perfected. May my ancestors of a hundred million generations ascend to the Hall of Blessings, and may all kin—inner and outer—attain peace. May my transformative deeds and merits be unimpeded wherever I tread, my wisdom illuminate all, and my constant preservation be boundless. May my descendants flourish, their wisdom exceptional, their heavenly and earthly ranks enduring and secure. May the Dao’s influence spread widely, and may all—seen and unseen—receive its grace.

Should my prayers be granted, I shall inscribe this profound mercy in my heart. Though my presumption knows no bounds and may offend your majesty, I prostrate myself in shame and trepidation. Relying on the grace of your benevolence, I nourish this withered form, diligently purifying myself in reverence, awaiting the response of the wondrous gate. I exhaust my sincere devotion, awaiting the verification of divine efficacy.

Your servant and [Name], together, pledge our bodies and minds, aspiring to the ultimate. We shall not betray what has been declared.

We beseech the Most High and Perfectly True Heavenly Worthy, the Lofty Myriad Perfected and Jade Dawn Dao Lord, to bestow your compassionate discernment.

Your foolish servant, through the Nine Thearchs’ divine officials, the Flying Dragon Riders, and the Embroidered Robe Envoys, respectfully presents this memorial for the male/female Daoist [Name], petitioning to receive the precious scripture of the *Hetu*, the hidden names of the Supreme Clarity. A vermilion memorial is hereby submitted to the Supreme Three Heavens, the Nine Thearchs, and the Jade Emperor’s Three Primordial Courts, awaiting your decree.

Your servant [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows repeatedly to make this known.

Your servant, of the surname [Name], hails from [State], [Commandery], [County], now belonging to [State], [Commandery], [County].

To the Supreme Primordial Great Dao of the Utmost Origin, the Most Perfectly True Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Origin, the Lofty Myriad Perfected and Jade Dawn Dao Lord, the Great Emperor of Fusang and Lord of the Sun Valley, the Thearchs and Emperors of the Myriad Heavens, and the Golden Gate and Jade Steps of the Nine Mysterious Imperial Lords of Later Sagely Worthies:

On the day and hour of the [Year-Star] in the [Month] of the [Year], at the mountain forest abode in the village of [State], [Commandery], [County].

The memorial body is made of yellow silk, one *chi* in length and two *chi* and four or five *cun* in width, with the content adjusted to fit. The beginning is left blank for one line. On the next line, the character *tai* (太) is placed above the central division, and *shang* (上) below it. Below this, three characters per *cun* are written in sequence. The column headers are marked in vermilion, each extending five *fen* outward, and bordered with vermilion. Within the columns, nine *cun* accommodate twenty-seven characters as the standard.

After the initial prostration, the remaining space is left blank. On the next line, the character *yan* (言) is written one character below the top, with the rest left blank. On the following line, the divisions are filled sequentially to the edge of the column, ensuring no misalignment within the borders. After the border, three lines are left blank, followed by the servant’s name [Name]. Three lines later, the Year-Star’s surname is recorded. In the central line, the forty-five characters from *Tai Shang* (太上) to *Bi Xia* (陛下) are written in smaller script, divided into three sections

Here follows the translation of *Shangqing Hetu Neixuan Jing*, Scroll the Lower:

**Incense, Lamps, and Prayer of Thanksgiving (Fourfold)**

Nine lamps are lit: seven with oil, two with incense, arrayed universally toward the north.

A mat is spread south of the lamps, upon which nine trays of jujubes are set. Nine slices of dried meat are placed atop the jujubes, and nine measures of salt are positioned behind the trays. Nine cups of wine are arranged before the trays.

Another mat is laid separately, facing the lamps, where the incense burner is placed. The disciple kneels in reverence, offers incense nine times, and with eyes closed, visualizes the Nine Star Spirits in the heavens above.

Upon completion, the disciple strikes the teeth nine times and rises.

The disciple, a servant of the Three Treasures, [Name], now respectfully invokes:

The Imperial Seat of the Auxiliary Star, Purple Qi Jade Tower, Imperial Lord of the Nine Mornings, August Sovereign, and the August Consort, the High August Left Consort;

Together with the Lord of Central Harmony, the Lord of Myriad Blessings, the Lord of Extended Longevity, the Lord of Cherished Life, the Lord of Bright Calculation, the Lord of Preserved Records, the Lord of Fixed Destiny, the Lord of Rewarding Goodness, the Lord of Answering Wishes, the Divine Lads and Jade Maidens, the Direct Talismans and Direct Officers, the Perfected Generals and Cavalry Attendants, and all their official retinues—may they all descend upon this open altar within [Name]’s village, observe the earnest devotion of this supplicant, and partake of this humble offering.

This servant, [Name], shares a bond of Dao and righteousness with [Name], enduring and karmically linked, their affection akin to flesh and blood, their hearts united in devotion.

[Name] surrenders life to the Nine August High Ones, the Seven Sacred Great Spirits, the Supreme Perfection of the Great Dao, and the Venerable Lords.

This servant, [Name], with awe and trepidation, bows twice in reverence.

Further, the wine is poured into cups, lifted three times, and offered thrice, completing nine offerings of wine, thus fulfilling the ninefold libation.

The disciple, a servant of the Three Treasures, [Name], now addresses the Seven Numinous Great Spirits, the Nine Essences of the Imperial Dawn, the Illustrious High Ones, the Lords of Virtue and Power, and all the Perfected Spirits:

Today, with utmost sincerity, [Name], of [State], [Commandery], [County], [Village], [Residence], presents this written petition, humbly reciting as follows.

This servant prostrates in hope that all the divine luminaries will reflect upon these words and, together with the modest offerings now set forth, accept the life-bound silken banners of [X] feet, presented before the Jade Mechanism of the August Sovereign and Consort corresponding to [Name]’s destiny. May they redeem and ransom [Name]’s fated expiration, beseeching the grace of renewal.

May the August Sovereigns and Consorts, moved by this sincere plea, partake of these humble offerings and bear witness to this covenant.

It is humbly prayed that the assembled spirits will exhort the August Sovereigns and Consorts to bestow compassionate grace, respond to this entreaty, and grant [Name] perpetual freedom from calamitous illness, sparing them from the sorrow of mortal affliction, delivering them from unforeseen misfortune. May all disasters dissolve, every endeavor align with the heart’s desire, and every aspiration be fulfilled. May this sincere devotion be conveyed through this servant.

This servant, though unworthy, has presumptuously joined the true teaching, aspiring to propagate the mysterious wind, to succor all beings, placing others before self, and never daring to slacken.

Now, unable to contain this earnest and reverent devotion, this servant ventures to present this humble plea.

Yet human life is ever in motion, truly beset by many [lacuna]. Through ignorance and darkness, one strays from the true path, leading to delusion and loss of the correct Way.

Upon reflection, principle resides in the realm of existence, and one cannot be without mind. What the mind pursues must be to dispel darkness and seek illumination. Illumination must be polished and brought forth by the sacred and numinous. When the mysterious reward is granted, the sacred permits gratitude; when the divine permits mercy, mercy arises from sincerity. Gratitude is tied to the purification of the heart. When the heart is exhausted, repentance for boundless transgressions begins; when sincerity is complete, the rites of offering must be respectfully presented. When the rites are perfected, divine protection will surely arrive; when transgressions are absolved, virtuous wishes will surely harmonize.

In accordance with this principle, this servant dares to lay bare this sincere heart.

The ancient sages offered sacrifices to Heaven in the wilds and to Earth in the open, gazing in reverence toward mountains and rivers. The former sages bequeathed these rites in their external counsels, and later sages upheld them to perfect virtue. As for invoking the Five Elders to pray to the Great One, summoning the Eight Numinous Ones to attract the Six Spirits—these mysteries were already expounded in the inner teachings, and the luminous decrees followed to propagate the Dao. Ranks and positions are ordered, their wonder lying in the absence of deviation.

Thus, in offering and cultivation, one acts according to intent, presenting gifts in due season. The noble do not disdain abundance, nor do the humble restrict themselves to frugality.

Azure silk adorned with *lin* and *feng* birds, jade-like wine and nectar of jasper—these are the provisions of those who ascend to the heights, not the means of the lowly and impoverished.

As for the offerings of swans and egrets to the Supreme Emperor, or the tender *ping* and *zao* herbs presented to the august deities—these are not rites this humble servant may perform, nor are they the ultimate expression of this sincere devotion.

This humble servant, though impoverished, has prepared according to the law offerings of wine, dried meats, salt, and fermented beans, and kindled lamps to illuminate and invoke the radiant numen. I burn incense to ascend my prayers, hoping for a response. Thus, I purify my body and spirit, entrusting my fate to the Mysterious Ultimate, exhausting the cinnabar sincerity of my devotion, undeterred by the meagerness of these humble offerings.

I humbly beseech the luminous spirits, the great sages, the perfected and august deities to bestow their compassionate protection and fulfill my earnest supplications. This servant fears that my transgressions are grave while my merits are slight, that I may soon suffer calamity and affliction, my life imperiled, my descendants lost, and all my aspirations thwarted.

Now, relying on the Mysterious Perfection to bring good to completion without abandonment, I have meticulously cleansed myself, washing body and heart, offering myself first to atone for all transgressions.

From the beginningless world through countless kalpas, I have transmigrated without cease—now as man, now as woman—until this present life. At times, my nature has been base and obscured, my resolve reckless and wild. I have failed to believe in the Great Dao, failed to revere the divine. As a child, I was unfilial; as a father, unkind. As a ruler, I lacked the Way; as a minister, loyalty. As an elder brother, I was unfraternal; as a younger, discordant. As an elder, I was careless; as a youth, irreverent. As a teacher, I was disrespected; as a disciple, negligent. As a friend, I was unrighteous; as a companion, insincere. As an aunt, I was unkind; as a wife, irreverent. As a mother, unloving; as a sister-in-law, undutiful. To my maternal uncles, I was disrespectful; to my paternal uncles, unbenevolent. To my sisters-in-law, I was unyielding; to my concubines, arrogant. With my spouse, I was disharmonious; among my children, unjust. Within, I was restless; without, unclear. To my superiors, I was unruly; to my subordinates, impure. To the lowly, I was insolent; to the noble, corrupt. As a man, I was unclean; as a woman, unchaste. I failed to grasp the principles of righteousness, failed to comprehend the subtle wonders. I was ignorant of the Mysterious Origin, entangled in worldly affairs, my thoughts mired in the dusty paths, forgetting to transcend the sea of俗. The five passions and six desires disturbed my spirit; the three poisons and seven accumulations confounded my heart. My deeds lacked focus, my choices were inconsistent, my conduct wavering. Heretical thoughts filled my mind, the Dao’s influence waned, and the world’s standards crumbled. My body and years declined, my transgressions accumulated daily. In action, I disregarded benefit; in stillness, I neglected precepts. Profound blessings and great goodness I never considered; vast calamities and grievous evils I committed day and night.

At times, in urgency, I briefly upheld the Dao, only to forget the True when circumstances eased. I acted perversely, indulging my will without restraint. Sometimes, I relied on power and influence, wielding authority with arrogance. At others, I undermined the Dao and corrupted virtue, harming rulers and kin, destroying scriptures and diagrams, assaulting my teachers, injuring my peers, slaughtering friends, oppressing all beings, and scorning the spirits. I desecrated tombs, opened coffins, mutilated corpses, punished ghosts, disturbed bones, and startled the dead, causing pain to my companions and distress to heaven and humanity. I hacked at spirit tablets, burned shrines, secretly plotted rebellion while outwardly feigning obedience. I envied those superior to me, slandered the loyal and steadfast, unleashed cruelty, suppressed the worthy, abandoned friends, tormented my homeland, slandered the good, mocked the talented, hoarded for myself, and refused to give to others. I seized from all quarters to enrich myself alone, devoured the people’s livelihood, and extorted in myriad ways, never satisfied, encroaching upon gods and men.

At times, I exploited my status or wealth to bully the lowly and orphaned, or seized what others loved, severing the six relations, cutting off kin, and isolating neighbors. I violated the nine degrees of kinship, indulged in myriad perversions, lost all restraint, schemed without scruple, cursed others, and falsely accused the virtuous. I railed and reviled, invoking ghosts and spirits, pointing at the sun and moon, and lodging complaints with the stars. I encouraged others to do evil, failed to teach the young, acted recklessly in darkness, and watched others succeed or fail. I indulged in lust and wine, adorned myself for vanity, my heart and mind inverted, my nature coarse, cruel, and violent. My laughter and tears were erratic, my conduct unchecked. I struck out in all directions, overturning all before me. At times, my hands committed violence; at others, I abetted others’ cruelty. I recklessly offended gods and men, disturbed the pure and tranquil, and arrogantly defied the luminous spirits. I criticized the scriptures and teachings, slandered the true Dharma, betrayed promises, deceived with cunning, flattered with seductive words, and fawned with insincerity. I was wrathful and resentful, cruel and domineering, arrogant and overbearing, my greed growing daily. I gambled for victory, mocked the weak, deceived the court and the countryside, and ridiculed the inner chambers. Outwardly, I feigned integrity while inwardly harboring treachery, manipulating right and wrong to advance my ends. I forcibly claimed the stars, boasted of my divination, falsely predicted fortune and misfortune, and acted duplicitously, praising to the face and slandering behind the back. With honeyed words and false smiles, I misled my homeland and disrupted my ancestral state. I disrespected the virtuous, rejected loyal advice, secretly envied the excellent, and covertly harmed the capable. I impersonated gods and spirits, falsely invoked the celestial, spoke deceitfully, and bewitched the people, stirring heaven and earth, startling the divine. I blocked roads, separated mother and child, obstructed the good, and suppressed the virtuous. I stockpiled medicines to wish illness upon others, hoarded coffins to await their deaths, disparaged others’ learning while praising my own, fabricated empty doctrines, and misapplied a single method, failing to grasp the subtleties of transformation and harboring doubts. I used public office for private gain, misled later generations, delighted in foulness, and shunned purity. I galloped in the hunt, cursed the wind and rain, committed robbery and theft, and shot arrows at heaven and earth.

My transgressions—whether hidden or manifest, mortal or spiritual—are known throughout the unseen and visible realms. I have defied reason, violated the scriptures, broken the laws and precepts. Above, I have betrayed the Three Luminaries, the Four Seasons, and the Five Phases; below, I have offended the myriad phenomena, the Nine Palaces, and the Six Jia. In between, I have disturbed the local deities, the spirits of tombs and dwellings, the souls of my ancestors, the hearth and gate gods, the spirits of roads and thresholds, and all the deities of the paths I have trodden. Wherever I have gone, I have neglected sacrifices, violated harmony, and broken prohibitions, accumulating transgressions in every place.

Should some transgressions be committed knowingly, others by unwitting error; some under coercion by others, others self-wrought in body and mind; some endured without remorse, others repented yet unatoned; some atoned yet repeated, never fully reformed; some long exiled by fate’s probing, never truly reformed; some accrued day by day, month by month, boundless and immeasurable, beyond full recounting—

Or entangled by kinship, tainted by inner and outer influences, where men and women, young and old, all kinfolk, in past lives and this, share in guilt, each leading the other astray. Some conspire together, some act at the behest of superiors, some bound by mutual pledges, sowing the roots of sin in others, their karmic ties unseen.

Or wavering in resolve, failing trials, incurring the wrath of gods and ghosts, entangling masters and disciples in misfortune; old grudges unresolved, new faults compounding, growing ever more intricate.

Or once enslaved, made to serve Hu, Yi, Man, Mo, Rong, Di, Qiang, fish and birds, insects and beasts, demons and malevolent spirits—creatures coarse and vile—devouring one another in endless cycles of vengeance unfulfilled.

The offenses listed here are but a fraction, unending through kalpas, beyond memory or reckoning. Whether committed or not, one cannot discern, for all are recorded in the Two Palaces and the Seventy-Four Bureaus, their cases reviewed by the Three Primes and the One Hundred Twenty Offices. With guilt so deep, judgment lies beyond measure—fearing that in a single day, one may return to dust, and even minor matters may fall short of worldly expectations.

Now, I entrust my fate to the Nine August Great Sage Honored Deities, beseeching their supreme virtue to bestow protection. May they grant compassion, commanding the Envoys of the Five Peaks to dispatch their agents, tracing the roots of my transgressions to dissolve all records of guilt and entanglements, pardoning my exile, severing the roots of evil, washing away accumulated offenses and burdens. May they guide my faithful heart, open the path of goodness, let the flow of upright qi flourish, and grant the protection of noble spirits.

May all my past offenses be cleansed, present faults erased, and future wrongs never arise. May my resolve to do good grow daily, my aspiration for higher learning never wane, and my study of scriptures and precepts begin anew from this day.

May the Lords of the Three Realms, the Five Emperors, the Six Jia, the Nine Palaces, and the Mystic Continent’s Cavern Masters, along with the countless immortals and sages, all benevolent spirits, heed my plea. Take note of my earnest repentance, pity my resolve to renew myself, accept my vow to encourage goodness, and fulfill my sincere devotion. May the Overseers of the All-Heaven Judgment Bureau, the Bureaus of Longevity and Fortune, together erase my name from the Black Register and inscribe it in the Azure Script. May all disasters be averted, my lifespan extended, and lasting blessings secured for my family’s prosperity. May malevolent omens dissipate, all good wishes be granted, dreams be true, tombs and dwellings peaceful, calamities cease, and inner and outer realms harmonize—revealing the efficacy of the mysterious and divine, repaying my deepest hopes.

Now, as I continue my words, let them remain measured and concise.

I offer wine once more, thrice in all.

I, [Name], humbly address the Nine August Honored Deities, the Seven Illustrious Spirits, and all the righteous gods. Born of humble origins in the mundane world, untrained in subtle Dharma, I fear my offerings may lack propriety, my words coarse and excessive, offending your majesty, my conduct violating ritual, my actions deeply flawed. I dread failure and the return of blame.

May your luminous spirits graciously look upon me with compassion, pitying my inadequacies, fostering my good intentions, and sparing me from punishment. May past offenses be pardoned, and all my wishes fulfilled.

Should I have further desires, I shall express them as I will.

From the day I receive your grace, I shall offer sincere rites as prescribed, just as tonight.

I prostrate myself, praying that the luminous great spirits and all true officials bestow their compassion, guiding me toward goodness, delighting in my devotion. May all my petitions and wishes be heard, and tonight’s pleas granted as my heart desires—so that I may forever bear the boundless grace of your renewal.

Now, I beseech your vast blessings to saturate my being. I offer the remaining wine, asking you to drink and let the divine qi descend upon me, fulfilling my good intentions.

I take this cup of wine, belonging to the star governing my life, and drink it.

I, [Name], address the Nine August Great Deities, the Illustrious and Exalted, the Lords of Dao and Virtue, and all benevolent spirits. Regarding [Name]’s matter of [specific request], bound by Dao and righteousness, I have presumptuously entreated your majesty to witness my plea for some time. I dare not delay your divine presence further. May you return to your respective offices, settle your spirits, and resume your thrones, bestowing divine grace to extend blessings and longevity. I command the local earth deities, the household spirits, the officials of halls and chambers, to safeguard [Name] and myself, permanently erasing our accumulated sins and renewing our fortunes. May all requests be granted as stated, all wishes fulfilled, and my devotion never in vain. Should future petitions arise, I humbly await your return.

I, [Name], in awe and reverence, bow twice in prostration.

Send off the deities in due order, bowing as you do.

When sending off the deities, one may simply bow twice, then kneel and kowtow, beseeching the grace of their ascent. If further words are needed, speak them privately as you wish, then rise and close the incense burner.

If the ritual follows immediately after the matter’s resolution, do not close the incense burner; instead, proceed with the offering. After the offering concludes, then close the incense burner.

Upon completing the offering, pour a small amount of the first cup of wine onto the ground—no need to empty it.

If treating an illness, take the cup belonging to the patient’s governing star and let them drink.

If no illness or misfortune afflicts others, have them all step outside, perform rites of respect, and present the wine.

Do not involve strangers or arouse suspicion, lest both parties incur offense.

Only those known and trusted without doubt may partake.

If, after the matter’s resolution, a separate offering is held at another time—whether for oneself or another, to seek blessings or grace—once the invocation of spirits concludes, strike the teeth and open the incense burner.

If entering the altar hall, rinse and recite the incantation according to the proper method.

For those whose cultivation is shallow and who have not yet received the transmission of sacred texts from the Dao, they may mutually initiate and guide one another, establishing virtue and merit. On an auspicious day and at a propitious hour, they may pray for profound grace, first giving thanks for past transgressions.

Life arises from the nine *qi*, completion from the nine heavens, learning from the nine disciplines, and rank culminates in the nine grades. Immortals and sages each possess their own scriptures and methods; if one’s practice is incomplete, one cannot avoid fault. Whatever one undertakes must begin with repentance for sins, and only then will grace and protection arrive unbidden.

To seek blessings, proceed from the subtle to the manifest—thus, begin with *Yangming* and proceed to the *Fubi*. To remove transgressions, proceed from the manifest to the subtle—thus, begin with the *Fubi* and proceed to *Yangming*. The efficacy of repentance lies in its sincerity; the opening words must convey the ebb and flow of intention. When receiving tasks or seeking grace, follow the original decree from the celestial court. The primary repentance should be uniform, and the rites of welcoming and sending off should not differ. In times of peril, the repentance may be abbreviated.

**Essential Methods for Observing the Stars**

After receiving the taboo names of the Nine August Ones, on a clear night, invoke the heavens and diligently observe the Northern Dipper. Visualize and memorize the order of the stars, their inner and outer names, and imagine the descent of the deities, speaking with them in your mind. Next, seek the *Fubi* stars, striving to perceive their forms. With focused concentration and reverent gaze, you will eventually behold them.

The observation of stars must be kept secret; do not let others know. If questioned, respond vaguely. Do not reveal anything, whether you see them or not—utter no word of it. Only the heart and eyes may share this knowledge.

When observing the stars, purify your body and *qi*. If defiled, bathe; if impure, change your garments. Clothing should be fragrant, and both inner and outer aspects immaculate. Where incense burns, invoke the mysterious spirits. Study the scriptures and charts carefully, memorizing them clearly before gazing outward. Do not speak carelessly or boastfully, and do not gather many people—only two or three like-minded companions. If a companion lacks the proper resolve, do not observe with them; each should practice separately, without visiting or inquiring of one another.

If fatigued, intoxicated, sated, or after conjugal union, or if one’s *qi* is unsettled, do not look upon the stars. Furthermore, if offerings, repentance rites, prostrations, or prayers for grace yield no signs over time, it is due to a lack of observation. Though one may not yet see the stars, sincerity and devotion will gradually bring results. Persist without slackening, and you will surely attain clarity. Once seen, the deities will descend, the offerings will prove efficacious, and boundless aid will follow. If one does not diligently study and observe the stars with a focused mind, demonic forces may assail them, inauspicious omens arise, and offerings will be wasted, laboring in vain while incurring transgressions. Those of resolute intent should take heed and be warned.

The nine stars govern distinct regions, and their configurations foretell fortune or misfortune in travel, residence, and all undertakings. Both Daoists and laypeople must examine them carefully to determine what is fitting, whether to proceed or withdraw, to transform failure into success, to seek the worthy and find them, to consult the sagely and encounter them. All actions will be upright and enduringly auspicious.

In serving the Nine August Sovereign Lords, whether by day or night, in movement or stillness, eating, drinking, or conjugal union, constantly visualize their presence. In every posture and gesture, never forget them. After nine years, the deities will descend, and you will receive the secret of eternal life.

The center of the heavens is called the Northern Asterism, comprising five stars. The first, the great star, is named *Tianshu* (Celestial Pivot), the Mother. The second is the Son, the third the Crown Prince, the fourth the Second Son, and the fifth is called *Beiji* (Northern Pole), born of *Tianyi* (Heavenly One). *Taiyi* (Great One) resides in the Purple Palace. To the east of the Purple Palace are eight stars, to the west seven, arrayed as vassal ministers. At its center lies the Purple Tenuity Palace, where *Taiyi* dwells, governing the five officials and the twenty-eight constellations. The five planets—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—correspond to the five stars, and the five stars correspond to the five phases. The Northern Dipper belongs to *Taiyi*, and *Taiyi* is the Pole, occupying the most exalted position.

The nine stars of the Northern Dipper guard *Taiyi*, and their auspices—whether fortunate or ill—are determined as follows:

The Northern Pole is the hollow center of the heavens. The Northern Pole lies south of this hollow, and the hollow lies north of the Northern Pole, hence it is called the Northern Asterism, around which all stars revolve.

1. The first star is the head of the Dipper, named *Tianshu* (Celestial Pivot), also called the *Zhengxing* (Principal Star) or *Tanlang* (Greedy Wolf). It holds the position of Imperial Censor and represents the heavens and the sun, governing yang virtue and symbolizing the Son of Heaven. Its domain is *Xuzhou*, corresponding to the constellations *Bishu*, *Kui*, and *Lou*, and it governs the fifth earthly branch (*chen*), associated with Jupiter.

2. The second star is *Dixuan* (Celestial Rotator), also called the *Faxing* (Law Star) or *Jumen* (Great Gate). It holds the position of Grand Marshal and represents the earth and the moon, governing yin punishment and symbolizing the Queen. Its domain is *Liangzhou* (later divided into *Yizhou*), corresponding to the constellations *Wei*, *Mao*, and *Bi*, and it governs the fifth branch (*hai*), associated with the Grand White Star.

3. The third star is *Renji* (Human Axis), also called the *Mingxing* (Life Star) or *Lucun* (Salary Storage). It holds the position of Chamberlain for the Palace Revenues and represents humanity, governing calamities. Its domain is *Jizhou*, corresponding to the constellations *Shen*, *Jing*, *Gui*, and *Liu*, and it governs the fifth branch (*xu*), associated with Mars.

4. The fourth star is *Wuquan* (Material Balance), also called the *Faxing* (Punishment Star) or *Wenqu* (Literary Curvature). It holds the position of Minister of Education and Grand Master of Ceremonies and represents the four seasons, governing the punishment of the unrighteous. Its domain is *Jingzhou*, corresponding to the constellations *Qixing*, *Zhang*, *Yi*, and *Zhen*, and it governs the fifth branch (*mao*), associated with Mercury.

5. The fifth star is *Yuheng* (Jade Balance), also called the *Shaxing* (Execution Star) or *Lianzhen* (Upright Integrity). It holds the position of Grand Herald and governs the execution of the guilty. Its domain is *Yanzhou*, corresponding to the constellations *Jiao*, *Kang*, *Di*, and *Fang*, and it governs the fifth branch (*chen*), associated with Saturn.

6. The sixth star is *Kaiyang* (Opening Yang), also called the *Weixing* (Danger Star) or *Wuqu* (Martial Curvature). It holds the position of Commandant of Justice and governs the sustenance of grain. Its domain is *Yangzhou*, corresponding to the constellations *Xin*, *Wei*, and *Ji*, and it governs the five colors, associated with Jupiter.

7. The seventh star is *Yaoguang* (Luminous Jade), also called the *Buxing* (Department Star) or *Pojun* (Breaking Army). It holds the position of Commandant of the Capital and governs warfare. Its domain is *Yuzhou*, corresponding to the constellations *Dou*, *Niu*, *Nü*, *Xu*, and *Wei*, and it governs the fifth branch (*wu*), associated with Venus.

8. The eighth star is the *Waifu* (Outer Assistant), located below the sixth star of the Northern Dipper, approximately one *cun* away.

9. The ninth star is the *Neifu* (Inner Assistant), a single star above the third star of the Northern Dipper, which is not ordinarily visible. If seen, it portends the attainment of divine sagehood.

When divining the eight stars, examine their positions within their domains. If a star’s position portends disaster or its domain suffers harm, one should avoid it. For minor afflictions, perform exorcisms, cultivate merit, establish rites, and offer repentance to invoke grace—all in secret, without speaking of it. Thus, misfortune will dissipate, and blessings will gather.

Virtue is the myriad of good deeds. Though the myriad practices bear myriad names, their essentials number nine: first, refraining from killing; second, refraining from licentiousness; third, refraining from falsehood; fourth, refraining from theft; fifth, refraining from perversity; sixth, refraining from wrath; seventh, refraining from envy; eighth, refraining from arrogance; ninth, refraining from stagnation. These are the Nine Virtues, possessed by those who attain the Dao.

The Nine Meritorious Deeds are these: first, releasing life and rescuing the dying; second, rewarding chastity and encouraging purity; third, offering loyalty and demonstrating trustworthiness; fourth, bestowing alms and eliminating greed; fifth, moderating wine and upholding integrity; sixth, reconciling disputes and admonishing strife; seventh, prohibiting villainy and halting jealousy; eighth, respecting and loving both high and low; ninth, alleviating sorrow and resolving distress. These are the Nine Meritorious Deeds, impartial and selfless.

Merit is cultivated outwardly, while virtue is established inwardly. With inner foundation and outer practice, the divine will surely descend upon you in secret. Those of exceptional talent and diligent practice may verify this in silence; transmit it only to those of like mind, and reveal it to no others. Observe the differences, and let your heart discern their significance. By this method, the efficacy of past and present may be known. Those lacking merit and practice will perceive it dimly, or their eyes may be deceived by malevolent spirits, seeing what seems but is not—proclaiming misfortune as fortune, or fortune as misfortune—contradicting the scriptures. In such cases, one should reflect on one’s transgressions and repent inwardly before observing again.

The above are the Nine Imperial Lords and the Nine Hidden Consorts of the Dipper’s Central Palace, along with their Yin names. When invoking or reciting them, mention only their titles and names, without describing their attire, mantles, or hairstyles.

If you can master the Nine Yin [names] of the Imperial Lords, you will ascend at dawn to the heavens and be enfeoffed as a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity. Throughout your life, you will be spared the disasters of mourning and calamity. The spirits of the Great Yin will guard and attend you, and the myriad numinous beings will bow in reverence. You will divide your form and disperse your transformations, merging with Heaven and Earth.

These Nine Ladies of the Great Yin are the Yin officials and spirits of the Imperial Lords. If you practice the Dao, untie karmic knots, present talismans to the celestial registers, pacify the hun-soul, control the po-soul, transform and generate the body’s spirit and qi, and refine essence to seek longevity—yet remain ignorant of the names of the Imperial Consorts and fail to practice the Nine Yin to achieve union—you will never attain immortality.

One *cun* inward from the space between the eyebrows lies the Hall of Light, a perfect square of one *cun*, where the Nine Yin Consorts of the Imperial Lord constantly reside. Always on the even days of the month, during the hours of living qi, burn incense and enter a separate chamber. Sit or recline as you wish, close your eyes for a long while, and visualize the Imperial Lord seated in the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Ultimate. Then visualize the Five Spirits of Taiyi within the Six Harmonies, the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper within your heart, and the Nine Yin Consorts within the Hall of Light. Next, visualize the Luminous Essence Lad of the Grand Tenuity standing before the Imperial Lord, the lad holding the Five Talismans in his left hand and the Five Registers in his right. Then visualize your own form standing behind the lad. Afterward, visualize the Nine Yin Consorts ascending from the Hall of Light into the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Ultimate, standing in a horizontal line behind you in order. Then visualize the Five Spirits of Taiyi ascending from the Six Harmonies into the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Ultimate, standing in a horizontal line behind the Nine Yin Consorts.

Once all is complete, the Imperial Lord and the host of spirits suddenly merge into one, transforming into a single being resembling a newborn infant, named the Eternal Lad, styled Transformation. In his left hand he holds the Nine Stars, on his head he wears the sun, and in his mouth he holds the moon. The lad illuminates your entire body with the light of the sun, moon, and Nine Stars, penetrating you inside and out. You will feel your body suffused with red, ablaze like fire, with no distinction between inner and outer—all radiant and luminous.

This is the myriad transformations of the Imperial Lord, Taiyi, and the Nine Yin in union. After a long while, conclude by knocking the teeth twenty-four times and swallowing saliva nine times. Then softly intone the incantation:

"Radiant spirit of the Grotto-Heaven,
revolving and illuminating the Purple Clarity,
Nine Mornings of the Dark Yin,
concealed and submerged in the unfathomable.
Ladies of the Dipper’s midst,
Three Maidens dispersing their forms..."

The divine consorts transform within, and the myriad things instantly take form. Lightning flashes and thunder crashes, clouds and mists flow like ringing bells. Nine transformations and ten evolutions give rise to cinnabar and bring forth verdant hues. The Nine Maidens of Taiyi unite in harmonious fusion, while the Lad of Impermanence roams freely, vanishing into the void and weaving through the obscure.

Adorned in brocade capes and resplendent sleeves, their skirts of purple feathers take flight. To their left, they bear concealed talismans; to their right, tiger-patterned sashes. They hold the Dipper in their mouths and wear fire upon their heads, grasping the banner of absolutes. Beside them, they command the Eight Winds, and from all four directions, they draw forth radiant clouds. Roaming the celestial net, they dissolve the Seven Origins, concealing mountains and rivers. They turn the Five Celestial Bodies, eclipsing the sun’s brilliance, and the constellations lose their true forms.

Dividing into a hundred shapes, their transformed bodies enter a thousand. In fire, they become fire; in forests, they become forests. In water, they become water; in mountains, they become mountains. What is sought arrives in an instant; what is summoned appears before one. In the blink of an eye, desires are fulfilled, and with a glance, all is attained. A thousand kinds and ten thousand things follow the heart’s command.

The Imperial Lord takes form, and the Supreme Jade Clarity of Tai Shang shares the same radiance. The Primordial Hero and the Four Scripts of White Origin endure with heaven and earth, preserving and nurturing my body. Whatever the mouth utters, transformations follow intent. Jade lads attend in service, jade maidens hold towels, divine consorts offer incense, and the Four Perfected share the same carriage. Every matter and thing conforms to my words.

*The Inner Mystery Scripture of the River Chart of Supreme Clarity* concludes.
