### *The Supreme Highest Cavernous Radiance Golden Prime Jade Clarity Hidden Book*

The Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven, dwelling in leisure above the luminous rosy clouds, within the jade towers of the Golden Flower Chamber, harmonized the Dark Pivot and the Void Axis, ascending to the curved repose of the Jasper Chamber. There, he feasted upon Dragon Mountain and observed a three-year purification fast. Then, he summoned the Celestial Guests of the Three Primes and the Five Worthies of the Grand Simplicity, dispatching writs to the myriad spirits and convening the thousand perfected. The Nine Heavens aligned in formation, the Eight Emperors halted their chariots. Crimson seals were unveiled at the Jade Gates, and the Yin Armor arrayed before the Jasper Portals.

Thereupon, the Nine August Perfected Sovereigns and the Upper Prime Forbidden Lords transcended the Jade Void Heaven, unsealed the chambers of the Five Perfected, girded the talismans of the Transcendent Records, and mounted the chariots of the Three Simplicities. Ascending to the Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Jade Clarity Heaven, they manifested their divine canopies before alighting.

At that moment, the Primordial Illumination shone resplendent, the Celestial Origin unfolded in full array. Rivers and seas stilled their waves, the Eight Winds dispersed the mists. Auspicious clouds met the Dragon Carriages, radiance soared above the Nine Mysteries. Golden Immortals wielded their halberds, Great Masters lowered their banners. Heavenly Soldiers led the vanguard, their lofty blades cleaving the sky. The Nine Numinous Ones opened the path, the Four Luminaries supported the procession. Flying banners filled myriad roads, mounted warriors numbered in the billions. They lingered beneath the Jasper Towers, displayed their splendor atop the luminous rosy clouds. Their divine regalia were fully arrayed, with none unpresented.

Thereupon, the Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven resumed his curved feast in the Jasper Chamber, reciting the Cavernous Chapters anew. He chanted the numinous verses of the Purple Void, resonating the Jade Microtones through the Seven Mysteries.

Then, he commanded the Supreme Perfected of the Supreme Tenuity to order the assembled spirits to align their armor and sharpen their blades. Mounting the Eight-Jasper Jade Chariot, they harnessed the radiance of the Dark Effulgence. The Rosy Clouds marshaled the spirits, escorting the sun and flanking the moon. The Seven Dawns merged their brilliance, the Upper Stars drove away obstacles. Fire-armored soldiers flared their essence, the Eight Simplicities unfurled their carriages. The Primordial Hardness guarded the troops, feathered canopies hovered in the void. Ten thousand riders vied in splendor, venomous dragons flanked the chariots. Swirling mists coiled around the carriages, bearing the flowered banners of the Dark Above, gleaming with the fire-bells of flowing gold. The Five Rosy Clouds displayed their radiance, the Six Perfections shone in clarity. They struck the resonant bells of the Nine Flowers, beat the azure drums of the Dark Florescence. They clanged gold and shattered jade, struck the jasper chimes and tapped the jade zithers. Dragons roared and tigers howled, phoenixes danced and luan birds sang. The Eight Sounds harmonized as one, the myriad rhythms rang in unison. Cloud chimes soared into the mysteries, heavenly maidens arrayed their zithers. Dharma melodies played in due time, rhythmic sequences ascended in offering. The Celestial Harmonies spread in four directions, the vast music filled the empty courtyard. Divine tigers raised their voices, heavenly beasts arrayed their troops. Reverse-scaled and four-throated, they shook their manes and bared their forms. Clenching blades to sever demons, brandishing swords to capture spirits, they lay in wait for the fiends of the Six Heavens, beheaded the mountain-and-peak malevolent essences. Feathered riders floated in the void, divine blades blazed with light. They brandished the Wheel of Jade Characters, displayed the splendor of the Supreme Clarity. Gazing upon the cloud radiance, they lingered in ranks, pursuing the tilting canopies through the Rosy Cloud City.

After a long while, the August Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign then commanded the Jade Gentleman of the Dark Wings, the Grand Guardian Perfected, to go forth and welcome the Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven. Gently guiding him forward, they turned their gaze toward the Jasper Chamber.

The Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven then prostrated himself beneath the latticed window, bowing before the imperial throne of the August Emperor. Leaning upon the jasper countenance, he perceived the subtle resonance; gazing up at the divine eyes, he addressed the Emperor, saying:

*"This humble servant, fortunate in his transformation, has deeply awakened to the congealed mystery. Having been granted the imperial throne, I oversee the assembly of the perfected. I have scattered the dews of emptiness across the Seven Awakenings, sounded the jade chimes in the heavens above. Yearning for the divine path of the Pure Mystery, I aspire to the divine kingship of the Jade Void. Truly, I am but a subtle speck in the Dark Flow, offering my hidden heart to distant realms. Yet the Heavenly Honored One stands lofty and transcendent, his divine canopy shining in illumination. Casting his gaze upon the lower currents, he has already bestowed his great mercy."*

Thereupon, the August Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign inclined his throne and chanted in repose, gazing emptily into the vast sky. He intoned the *Hidden Book of the Jade Clarity*, singing the numinous verses of the Primordial Radiance. The jade tones gleamed afar, the pure and subtle sounds resonated clearly.

The verses said:

*The upper radiance emits the dawn’s glow,*
*The golden heavens dense with purple clarity.*
*The Three Simplicities illumine the jasper doors,*
*The Dark Above shines upon the void’s numina.*
*Hand plucking the blossoms of the azure groves,*
*Turning the canopy toward the Great Nothing’s court.*
*Feasting in repose within the emerald chambers,*
*Striding aloft the resplendent Jade Capital.*
*Upholding the crimson radiance’s jade,*
*Long mists scatter the void’s encampments.*
*The Dark Return may surely be preserved—*
*Why resent the lack of birth?*
*The Four Kings dwell within whose body?*
*Transformations divide—how could forms be one?*
*Swiftly, swiftly, discern the wondrous ranks,*
*Merge with your qi’s luminous clarity.*

Thereupon, the Jade Emperor concluded his chant and commanded the Lord Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven to be seated, leading the myriad spirits into the chamber’s pavilion. They scattered flower incense throughout the Jade Palace, arrayed the vast music of the Celestial Harmonies, resonating the numinous tones across the Eight Seas, stirring the dark waves beyond the heavens. Beating drums and fanning winds, the thousand divine feathered guards poured jade goblets, gazing upon the Jasper Flower Chamber. The Nine Flowers offered their fruits, white essences and cinnabar elixirs. Hidden mushrooms formed the feast, phoenix platters and moon nectars. Jade ladles served in succession, dark-feathered attendants circulated the cups. They lingered in the chambers of the Eight Jades, feasted in the halls of the Nine Gemstones.

Thereupon, the August Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign, concentrating his spirit in distant contemplation, chanted the mysteries of the Dark. Suddenly, he sighed and said:

*"To align with the Dark Model, to penetrate the subtle and profound—how deep indeed! You, having been granted the imperial throne and received the affairs of the Jade Void, lead flying immortals to court at the Golden Gates, with the Four Luminaries assisting at the wheels’ sides. Gazing afar upon the empty mountains, overseeing the celestial peaks, responding in harmony to transcendent songs, unfolding and praising wondrous wisdom—truly, you should thoroughly observe the hidden texts, align with the supreme methods, and elevate your gatherings to subtle resonance. Strive on!"*

Then the August Jade Emperor commanded the Supreme Venerable Perfected, opening the casket of luminous pearls to retrieve the *Jade Purity’s Hidden Writ of the Concealed Dark Plumes*, bestowing it upon the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. Thereupon, the Emperor descended from his seat, bowing deeply before the August Sovereign to receive the scripture. He then entrusted it to the Supreme Perfected of the Grand Tenuity, the Dark Plume Jade Lord, who in turn transmitted it to the Perfected of the Highest Clarity and the exalted guests of the Three Primordials’ Great Simplicity.

Moreover, the Emperor surveyed the hosts of heavens, examining those among the ten directions who bore predestined affinities—those who had gathered in assemblies of true immortals or whose names were inscribed in the imperial registers of golden script and the hundred-jade ledgers—only these were deemed worthy of its transmission. Forty-five Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, attendants of the scripture, oversaw the bodies of its recipients, reporting transgressions to the Lords of Destiny and recording faults in the registers of the Three Primordials. Those who guarded its secrecy would enjoy blessings, while those who leaked it would be ensnared by calamity; suffering or joy would manifest instantly for their seven generations, and the consequences of sin or merit would converge in the present year. The inspectors of the Three Heavens would report to the Emperor, inscribing sins and recording faults without fail. Good and evil, truth and deceit—how could one not be vigilant?

The *August Jade Wisdom and Jade Purity’s Hidden Writ* is the esoteric discourse of the Highest Sovereign, the sacred text of the Jade Emperor. It is also named the *Cavern Radiance and Golden Mystery’s Concealed Dark Plume Scripture*. The Emperor concealed it within the *Cloud Radiance Pavilion* and the *Luminous Rosy Chamber*, sealing it in a casket of cinnabar petals and wrapping it in a cloud-brocade pouch. The Supreme Venerable Perfected was appointed its guardian, attended by the Dark Radiance Jade Lads. It was decreed that within seven hundred years, it might be transmitted to only three individuals. Unless one’s name was inscribed in the imperial charts and jade registers of true immortals, one could neither hear of nor behold this scripture. Those who beheld it would ascend as flying immortals of the Highest Clarity.

The method of transmission required the Five Elders to bestow the charts, the Great Unity to examine the candidate, and the ability to govern life across the ten directions, convene assemblies in the cavern-heavens, and swear oaths in cinnabar script, sealing them with blood pacts. First, one must fast for seven hundred days before receiving it. The oath was sworn upon thirty feet of azure silk and two pairs of golden rings, solemnizing the covenant before the Emperor, ascending to the Jade Clarity, and ensuring the transcendence of one’s ancestors as embryonic immortals. Should the sacred text be leaked, seven generations would suffer misfortune, their souls bound to the gates of death, their lifespans severed at the ford of the Five Paths. The Three Officials would inflict torment, extinguishing all hope of immortality; their bodies would endure the perils of fire and water, their trials more treacherous than treading upon ice. How could one not be vigilant? How could one not be vigilant?

The *Jade Purity’s Hidden Writ and Golden Mystery’s Dark Plume Scripture* are the treasured texts of the Primal Sovereign, concealed by the Jade Emperor and overseen by the inspectors of the Three Heavens, who punish all violations of its sanctity. On the day the disciple begins the fast, the Jade Lads and Maidens attending the scripture report to the Emperor. Once the numinous voice resounds, the Great Unity examines the candidate, the August Lord observes from above, the Supreme Venerable attends at his side, and the plume immortals preside over the truth. The disciple must enter the chamber in purified robes, burn incense, and cultivate utmost sincerity and focus before reciting the scripture ten times over.

Myriad branches of layered splendor—eternally preserving the immortal spirits. Grasping the jade talismans, ascending to the feathered court. Circling winds merge in transformation; the Jade Emperor’s Hidden Scripture. Long bound in singular destiny, the supreme vow must be fulfilled. Receiving the Emperor’s grace, ascending to pay homage in the Jade Clarity.

The Jade Clarity’s Hidden Scripture, the Hidden Feathered Classic—also named the Cavernous Radiance Golden Mystery—is the secret treasure of the Jade Emperor. To practice this method, one must first perform the Great Unification of the Hundred Spirits, mastering the transformations of yin and yang and the Supreme Unity’s Upper Dao, before proceeding further. These sacred verses are the precious scrolls of emperors and sovereigns, untying the knotted bonds of the seven ancestors, safeguarding the myriad spirits within the primordial womb, and gathering the life-Dao from the ten directions, their numinous resonance ascending to fill the heights.

Once the ten thousand cycles are complete, the body shines with golden dawn. Then, wondrous radiance subtly stirs, lingering upon the cloud-wheels; the jade bells chime in the Great Empyrean, and the perfected take their places among the Upper Immortals. Thus, in every movement and stillness, one must not neglect its weighty purpose.

On the day of one’s natal destiny, purify the fast and enter the chamber. Burn incense to the left and right, face north, and bow twice. Then, with the heart fixed upon the Jade Emperor and the Primordial Lady of the Jade Clarity, seek deliverance from the transgressions of the Seven Mysteries and petition for one’s own immortality. When finished, sit upright and recite the scripture.

After reciting the scripture three times, read once the *Highest Jade Emperor’s Divine Wisdom for Annihilating Demons*. That evening, perform ten recitations of the Hidden Scripture and four readings of the *Divine Wisdom*. Upon completion, close the eyes, inwardly gaze, calm the spirit, and regulate the qi. Sit or lie as one wishes, then knock the teeth thirty times and softly intone the prayer:

*"Great Wisdom of the Five Emperors, this is the Hidden Mystery.
Ten cycles and four returns—annihilate demons, summon the perfected.
Seven spirits unite in harmony; the Great Unification gathers the Five Spirits.
Jade resonance shakes the Eight Directions; the Upper Primordial’s Seven Mysteries.
Mysterious wind scatters the gates, fanning away the roots of the womb.
Eternally safeguard the fetal infant, eternally receive the true immortals.
Ascend to the Upper Clarity, to the Jade Emperor’s celestial chariot."*

Then knock the teeth thirty times again and swallow saliva ten times. Thereupon, the hundred spirits assemble, the five viscera become tranquil, the Imperial Lord rejoices, the Great Unity preserves life, the body is purified, the qi is fortified, the hun is softened, the po is pacified, the Director of Destinies records one’s fate, and the Royal Elder inscribes one’s name. No one may weep for oneself; the flying wheel ascends to the Jade Clarity. The knots of the womb unravel, the Eight Radiance unite in form, great fortune entwines, and the Seven Mysteries share in glory.

When the ten recitations are complete, bow to the four directions in reverence of the wondrous and exalted spirits. Those who maintain long fasts, sever worldly ties, purify the body, and wear clean garments may dwell in seclusion and recite daily. Alternatively, on the days of *jiǎzǐ* or the eight solar terms—times of the Upper Primordial’s courtly feasts—one need not wait for the natal destiny day to proceed.

During the ten recitations of the Hidden Scripture, the Great Unity oversees, the Director of Destinies determines life, the myriad spirits merge in unity, the Imperial Lord solidifies form, the Three Palaces convene with the perfected, and the Nine Chambers receive the numinous. On that night, wondrous responses and auspicious signs will manifest, whereupon the Eight Purities will envelop the body, and the Three Primordials will confer perfection.

In practicing this Dao, one must focus the essence, preserve the true, and concentrate the qi. With a sincere and earnest heart, enduring hardship and adversity without forgetting the Supreme Dao, subtle resonance will readily converge, the Dharma-wheel will swiftly ascend, and at dawn, one will ascend to the Great Empyrean, soaring through the chambers of yin.

If, however, the mind scatters into myriad thoughts, sincerity falters, the body remains defiled and impure, the heart lacks supreme longing, and one violates the numinous prohibitions or transgresses the sacred statutes, then the Imperial Lord will censure one’s sins, calamity will entwine the body, no hope of immortality will remain, the Seven Mysteries will be further imprisoned, the hun and po will enter wind and fire, and the kalpas will multiply one’s transgressions. Those who uphold the prohibitions become numinous immortals; those who violate them face execution.

If a Daoist’s body is unwell and illness is perceived, one may seclude oneself in a separate chamber, invoke the divine luminaries, and seek deliverance from the entanglements of transgressions and the sins of the Seven Mysteries. Upon receiving permission to recite the scripture, visualize the true qi and perform the rites and prayers as prescribed. When all is done, calm the body and rest. Naturally, the hun and fetal spirit will be fortified within, the Three Passes will receive the numinous, evil toxins will disperse, and the body and qi will become tranquil. Upon awakening, the body will be healthy and at peace, free from all illness.

If others are afflicted with illness or face dire straits, one may recite the scripture on their behalf. First, invoke the divine luminaries, face north, bow twice, and state the person’s name to the Primordial Lady of the Jade Clarity. Seek deliverance from their transgressions and the sins of their seven ancestors, salvation for the living in the ten directions, and relief from the eight difficulties. Then burn incense, recite the scripture in seclusion, and perform the prayers as prescribed. Great fortune will manifest in the body.

Entering the fast and secluding oneself for seven days to recite the scripture is called the *Great Unification of the Hundred Spirits*, the audience with the Imperial Unity, the deliverance from transgressions and entanglements, the gathering of life and salvation from peril—none will fail to receive grace. This is the supreme method of the Jade Emperor. One must not tread upon it with a defiled or impure body, nor profane it with contamination. The Three Heavens will察 transgressions, and the punishment will be equal to that for leaking secrets. Be cautious, be cautious.

The *Highest Upper Clarity Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Cavernous Radiance Golden Primordial Hidden Book for Annihilating Demons* ends here.
