The Supreme Three Sovereigns and Great Perfected of the Mystic Cavern, the Upper Cavern Dao Lord, declared:
The true talismans of the Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writ were issued by the Celestial Parents of the Supreme Perfected, transmitted by the Supreme Perfected Elder from the Three Sovereign Lords, and passed through kalpas to the Youth of the Eastern Sea. The Nine Heavenly Kings conveyed them to the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, who treasured and concealed them within the Jade Chamber of the Numinous Capital of the Grand Tenuity, guarded by the Great Beasts of the Vast Heavens, defended by Poisonous Dragons and Golden Tigers, and escorted by seven thousand attendants. Within the Jade Palace, three hundred Golden Dawn Jade Lads and three hundred Pure Numinous Jade Maidens served to protect the sacred writ. Its numinous radiance illumined the void, purple mists dispersed across the celestial court, its majesty resounding through the nine distant realms. The great deities of the August Heaven shone resplendent in the Supreme Clarity, its wondrous harmony unfolding in spontaneity, its wisdom penetrating the formless.

The Divine Tiger adorned its head, the Golden Tiger guarded its truth, wisdom marked its trunk, and demonic roots were severed at their source. Its subtle meanings were profound and obscure, its marvels too intricate to detail—all inscribed with the hidden taboos of heavenly demons and the inner names of the hundred spirits. Reciting its chapters startled a thousand essences into motion; chanting its verses bound ten thousand demons in form. At the inception of governance in the Three Heavens, it was transmitted to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, empowering him to command the Six Heavens, decapitate myriad spirits, subdue mountain valleys, and summon the gods of the seas. All essences girded themselves in submission. The host of spirits deployed talismans, their mighty awe shaking demons, evil vanishing in form, the true gods of the earthly prisons realigning the net of the Five Stars.

Thereupon, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity received the *Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writ of Demonic-Dispelling Wisdom*, bearing its talismans in roaming play. He traversed the Supreme Clarity, soaring beyond the void, floating upon the wheel of the firmament. The Grand Tenuity’s radiance settled in the lofty hall; the Supreme Perfected paused upon the palace steps, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth in covenant, illuminating the Seven Luminaries in sublime brilliance. Aligned with the revolutions of the Three Sovereigns, its light shone through the Nine Nether realms. He grasped the cloud tablets upon the cliffs, his jade chapters gleaming in the numinous mechanism, encompassing the myriad transformations in profound wisdom, summoning divine perfected and the hundred yang. Thus, lightning flashed against ten thousand poisons, sweeping away billions, causing all malevolent spirits to perish and toxins to vanish. Its majesty resounded through distant courts; the Golden Dawn unfurled the Dao, leaving no room for self-concealment. Above, he gazed into the inner Golden Palace, where the Eight Luminaries responded to his command. Numinous officials mounted Golden Tigers, bearing him to soar beyond the void. A host of dragons opened the immortal path, ascending afar to pay homage to the Grand Tenuity. The Three Terraces led the way; the Seven Stars followed in swift pursuit. He flew and soared, galloping upon the divine steed, exuberantly attuned to the celestial mechanism. Gazing through the Nine Mystic Gates, he roamed to the farthest reaches of Heaven. Resting in the jasper chambers of the Phoenix Pavilion, his comings and goings flowed without cease. Subtle indeed was the celestial true talisman; the august numen bore its wondrous title.

#### **The Earthly Sovereign’s Exposition on the Phoenix Writ**
The Earthly Sovereign transmitted the talismanic chapters of the Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writ to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity then informed the Most Sage Azure Youth Lord. Thereupon, the Lord of the Western City declared:
*The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Great Wisdom for Dispelling Demons*—this is the Phoenix Writ of the Three Sovereigns, the inner script of the Great Ultimate, the hidden taboos of the host of spirits, the jade chapters of the Supreme, the precious formulas of the Upper Sovereign, the precious writ of the Golden Tiger. Its wisdom can expel filth and annihilate demons, perform great exorcisms to restrain poisons, and discern evil—no malevolent spirit shall remain unshattered in form. Bearing it, one harmonizes with form to ascend and transcend, scattering radiance in all directions, roaming the ford-crossings of the seas. No harm shall befall, and one may sit or stand in vanishing presence, communing with the Mystic, attaining desires in an instant—what wish would not be fulfilled?

Now, with divine majesty, I transmit it to you. Cultivate it diligently, for this true scripture is lofty and wondrous. Recite it ten thousand times to achieve mastery, and proclaim it to encourage later worthies to receive the true teachings. Adhere to the regulations of the Supreme Perfected; do not casually reveal it to the unworthy. In an age devoid of faithful and compliant individuals, after seven hundred years, it shall reemerge at the end of the Ma clan, when virtuous power reaches the Song region. Its mighty efficacy shall assist three transmissions, ascending to the Grand Ultimate Duke. Unless one possesses the bearing of dragons and phoenixes, how could one share in the treasure of the worthy?

#### **The Human Sovereign’s Phoenix Writ**
The Phoenix Writ descended from afar,
The Golden Tiger illumined the divine perfected.
Its application bore primordial merit,
Never bestowed upon the impure and defiled.
It covered and sustained the masters of the Three Caverns,
Ascending to the guests of the Supreme Mystery.
Passing the gates of the Queen Mother of the West,
Roaming the ford-crossings of the Celestial River.
First paying homage to the Emperor of the Great Ultimate,
Traversing thirty heavens through kalpas.
Frequently receiving the descent of celestial perfected,
With jade maidens numbering in the thousands.
Golden lads descended to the left,
Jade maidens attended to the right.
Bestowed with the Nine-Bend Staff,
How resplendent was its jade!
Celestial officials descended in its train,
The Five Peaks led the way before.
Heavenly beings played flutes and struck chimes,
Pipes and songs guarded the space between.
Mountains and seas stilled into waves,
The pure path free of dust and shadow.
Descending to play in the Four Waterways,
The Five Peaks briefly revolved.
All demons hid in submission,
Malevolent spirits perished in form.
Flying radiance within the crimson palace,
Exuberantly following the host of immortals.
With focused intent, receiving Heaven’s descent,
Ascending to the August Heaven in broad daylight.
Why not strive with diligence,
To broadly seek the ford-crossings of enlightened masters?
The Heavenly Sovereign’s Dao was lofty and wondrous,
Penetrating above to the sage perfected.
The Earthly Sovereign followed in clarity,
His virtue aligned with the Emperor’s causes.
The Human Sovereign’s transformation was sagely,
His virtue equaling the celestial wheel.

Masters transmitting this to disciples must all observe a pure fast for ninety days, or thirty days, or a minor fast of seven days. They must present seven taels of refined gold as a token of faith for the Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writ. Ninety feet of cinnabar-red brocade shall be offered to swear an oath to the Nine Heavens. Forty feet of azure silk shall be used to pledge allegiance to the scripture.

Those who cherish the Dao and align with the True, who diligently focus their hearts on the Mysterious, who spare no wealth nor treasure their bodies but hold fast to faith—nothing shall fail to descend upon them, nor shall anything remain unchanged. Those who receive this teaching must seek with diligence, never rushing ahead in transgression. Day and night, they must remain unsleeping, striving ever to surpass others. Why indulge in laziness and neglect, sitting idly to incur faults? To embody the Law is to unite with the Dao; those who do not embody it must not speak recklessly. If both inner and outer are but superficial adornments, how can one truly associate with others? Beware: wealth becomes a burden, and slander may ruin both name and self. Even the slightest misdeed is known to Heaven—do not claim that trifles do not entangle. I urge you to evade the snares of the world, gradually retreat to shelter in the famed mountains. In the stillness of mountains and marshes, devoid of distraction, the myriad spirits may be preserved. Frequently disperse your treasures to redeem past-life transgressions. In every generation, become a bridge to ferry those lost in darkness. Diminish excess to supplement deficiency, and your merit shall spread to the eight directions. When calamity arises, it is through the Dao that deliverance comes; the Dao’s descent offers sheltering wings. When bestowing grace, act swiftly—do not wait until disaster strikes. Once disaster has struck, fault is already sealed; it cannot be undone. Though you may strive to undo it, your strength may prove insufficient, leaving you to sit in helpless poverty.

Wear the Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writ as an upper talisman, inscribed in cinnabar. Alternatively, it may be written in cinnabar upon an azure ground.

The August Dao declares: Daoists who study the Way of Immortal Perfection must establish merit among humankind. After years of practice, they should enter the Five Marchmounts and other sacred mountains. If scholars endure hardship yet have not yet refined their reclusion, or if they set their sights on divine herbs and directly journey to the mountains—though the path be long and distant—should they suddenly encounter the Three Calamities or Five Adversities, unable to deploy their arts, finding themselves amidst evil bandits, ghosts, or malevolent spirits, they must invoke the might of divine power in a grand incantation. Facing the perilous place, they shall strike the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times in unison, summoning the gods within their bodies, and pray thus:

*"May the Mystic Sound of the Nine Heavens descend in perfect harmony, governing the Four Directions and unfolding the myriad divine blossoms. May it transcend stagnant celestial traces, embracing the Three and Five in boundless array. May it turn the plain into radiant splendor, chanting the swift decree of fate. By cinnabar oaths and solemn vows, may afflictions be dissolved and maladies dispelled. May luminous glory shine on high, its radiance filling the household. Like Bo Le wielding his whip, may it vanquish demonic hordes, reclaiming lost lineages and obliterating the Nine Netherworlds. By the tiger talisman’s divine might, may all evil be subdued, all adversaries—great or small—annihilated. May the Nine Yin’s perversity be severed, and misfortunes buried in the shifting sands. May all poisons be subdued, and a hundred trials overcome. Let this be proclaimed as merit worthy of reward, unbetraying the Great Harmony."*

**Lofty Phoenix Writ of the Most High**
Resplendent upon the Five-Rayed Peak,
A solitary summit gleams with celestial radiance.

The scholar lacks strict purity,
The officers and soldiers fail to comply.
I follow the Orthodox Dao in practice—
How dare the myriad evils assail me?
My body bears the Golden Spirit’s token,
Tinkling bells fly beside me in flight.
Talismans of the Three Heavens and Five Peaks
Guide my path before and behind.
The Heavenly Net is cast wide,
The Earthly Snare is set in place.
Ghosts, demons, and venomous beasts—
At the sight of me, they crumble and fall.
How dare thieves and bandits approach?
The Golden Phoenix devours their decay.
A thousand spirits lose their eyes,
Ten thousand demons flee like thunder.
How can thieves and bandits be tolerated?
The Three Officials shall sternly pursue them.
Hasten their flight, drive them in rout—
Tiger Soldiers shall strike with pain.
Swiftly, swiftly, by imperial decree,
Proclaim the awe of the Supreme Might.
Those with merit shall be promoted and rewarded,
Those without shall be pursued by ten thousand mechanisms.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Bright Heaven’s curse and command!

There is also the Great Talisman for Dispelling Demons,
Found in the *Scripture of Heavenly Water for Dispelling Demons*,
Which may be preemptively employed to repel evil,
Followed by the divine incantation’s execution of command.
This is the hidden sound of the Demon Kings of the Nine Heavens—
It should also be worn and recited to subdue demons.
When no recitation is used for control,
First ingest a talisman to strengthen the inner spirits’ resonance.

In the third year of the Xingning reign, the *yichou* year, the seventh day of the seventh month,
Tongbo Perfected received from Le Zichang and Master Anqi
The *Golden Tiger Phoenix Writ Talismans* concealed within the Three Sovereigns’ treasury,
Commanding the late-learning Daoist Xu Yuanyou to receive them
For the subduing of the myriad demons.
The divine incantation’s efficacy extends to the years *yiwei*, *jiashen*, *yihai*, *renchen*, and *guisi*,
On the first day of the ninth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the eighth day of the fourth month—
On these three days, there shall appear worthy persons and Daoists,
Clad in seven-colored ritual robes, staff in hand,
Upon the sacred altar or among the people, making petitions.
At such times, they chant scriptures, recite texts,
Or raise voices in wild song.
If you encounter such a person,
Diligently inquire and fully explain your circumstances—
They shall surely bestow upon you the *Upper Talisman of the Golden Tiger*,
Along with essential teachings.
Take care not to slight them—
These are Perfected Ones in hidden transformation.
The Perfected of Mount Nanyue are often dispatched
By the Most High Lord of the Boundless Dao and the Heavenly Thearch,
Sometimes descending among the people
To observe the earnestness of late-learning Daoists in the degenerate age.

The *Upper Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Radiant Light: Golden Tiger Phoenix Writ* concludes.
