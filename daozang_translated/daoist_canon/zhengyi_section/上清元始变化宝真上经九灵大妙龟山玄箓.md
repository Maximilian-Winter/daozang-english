### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Transformations and Treasured Perfections: The Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise, Scroll One*

The treasured scriptures of Supreme Clarity arose at the very inception of the Nine Heavens, born of spontaneity and coexisting with *qi*. The Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, manifesting above the Nine Heavens and within the Great Void. At times, they coalesced into soaring, mysterious purple *qi*, forming numinous texts—celestial writings of subtle wonder, their strokes sinuous and intricate, each character a full *zhang* in breadth, their depths beyond easy comprehension. None but the True Kings of the Nine Heavens could fathom their profound resonance.

In the first year of the *Above-Void* era, the True Kings of the Nine Heavens commanded the Supreme Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Capital to cast gold into tablets. The assembled sages, enlightened to the luminous meanings and the supreme oral transmissions, compiled the numinous chapters. The Jade Emperor inscribed the brushstrokes, engraving the tablets into scripture. Their postures and rhythms—whether rising or descending—followed a hierarchy of ranks and prohibitions, each category derived from the esoteric intentions of the exalted sages. These were sealed above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chambers of the Grand Existence Palace, guarded by the Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence and the Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn of the Primordial Numinous Palace.

The Mountain of the Western Tortoise, also called Dragon Mountain, serves as the root and pivot of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal repository of the myriad *qi*. Located at the northwest corner of the heavens, it spans four hundred thousand *li* in circumference, its height bordering the Jade Clarity Heaven. To the southeast, it connects with the rosy clouds of the *Through-Yang* realm, ascending to the Gate of the Divine Tiger of the Azure Palace. To the northwest, it intersects the wilds of the *Cold Cavern*, rising to the Court of the Immortals of the Golden Portal. To the south, it extends to the Crimson Floating-Ripple Land, its *qi* harmonizing with the radiance of the *Cavern-Yang*. To the north, it points toward the *Curved Array*, linking with the *Flourishing Canopy*, its *qi* treading the vast numinous expanse. At its center, it soars directly toward the Eightfold Crossroads of the Jade Capital atop the summit of the Intersecting Winds Mountain. Thirty thousand *li* of level heavens are encircled by walls of surging gold and gates of wrought jade, adorned with golden terraces, jade towers, and twelve divine palaces.

Above stand halls of naturally flowing essence, the Purple Portal and Golden Florescence Chambers, and chambers of jasper and jade, flanked by nine cavernous grottoes. Spontaneously arising purple clouds interweave with phoenix-script patterns, their nine hues cascading in array. Cliffs bear purple cassia, ridges flourish with jade groves, coral branches intertwine, and jade roots take hold. The *Kan* trees bear fruit, the *Red Children* and *White Rings* gleam, the *Three Florals* radiate blossoms upon the crimson radiance, and *reverse fragrance* flows through the *Great Mystery*. The eight *qi* fan the winds in ceaseless motion, jade flutes resound in the void to form celestial music. Dragons roar from cloud towers, phoenixes cry atop distant peaks. Venomous beasts gather in the thousands, serpents coil a thousand *xun* in length. Divine palaces stand majestic, cloud-borne immortals swarm in multitudes. The towering primordial halls brim with emanations of every kind—such are the wondrous transformations of the Primordial Beginning, the true numinous root of the Celestial Origin.

Within the Hall of the Golden Florescence, above the northern window, a spontaneously arising purple *qi* coalesces into mysterious script, each character a full *zhang* in breadth, its rays cascading in luminous splendor. The celestial writing is of subtle wonder, its depths beyond easy comprehension. In the first year of the *Shangjia* era, the Venerable of the Nine Heavens ascended to the Cloud Palace to perform the purification fast. Gazing upon the radiant scene of Mount Tortoise, he engraved golden tablets and transcribed the mysterious script, dispelling its long-standing obscurities and expounding its numinous resonance. It was recorded as *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery and Purple Writ of Mount Tortoise*.

On the first *yin* day of the first month of the first year of the *Kaihuang* era, the Queen Mother of the West rode the void upon a numinous vessel, soaring through the Nine Empyreans. She purified herself upon Mount Tortoise and ascended the naturally flowing essence of the Purple Portal and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Wandering to the northern window, she paid homage to the mysterious script, gazing upon the cliffs in contemplation of the numinous and directing her thoughts toward the Supreme Perfected Ones. Thereupon, her wondrous perception awakened to the mystery, and her cinnabar heart revealed itself.

Suddenly, a great celestial perfected one appeared, bearing the sun and moon, a halo encircling his neck, accompanied by a retinue of feather-canopied immortals. He arrived upon a flying chariot of purple clouds and ninefold luminous auroras, prostrating before the Queen Mother. He announced: "I am the Perfected King Governing the Phoenix Palace of the Nine Heavens, surnamed *Supreme Mystery* and styled *Kaiming*. By the command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I have descended to bestow upon you the golden script of the Nine Heavens, the purple characters of the *Azure-Golden Crimson Sovereign’s Writ*." He conferred upon her the title *Supreme Perfected Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Origin* and enfeoffed her as the sovereign of the Western Tortoise Peak. He further bestowed a plain scripture scroll, the *Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, which oversees the registers of immortals and upholds the lineage of the Jade Clarity.

Additionally, he presented a tablet of azure jasper and granted her the *Flying Azure Feather Robe of the Phoenix Garments of the Nine Heavens*, the *Morning Infant Jade Crown*, the *Phoenix-Cloud Sandals*, the *Divine Phoenix Purple Wheel Flying Feather Canopy* of twenty-four carriages, and the *Five-Colored Command Banners of the Numinous Standards*. He also assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace’s Golden Florescence to attend and protect the Perfected Mother. She was charged with governing the Jasper Hall of the Flowing Essence Purple Portal and Golden Florescence, ascending thrice monthly to the Jade Clarity, twice feasting upon Kunlun, and reviewing the multitudes of immortals every five assemblies.

Thereupon, the great celestial perfected one completed his mission and returned to his jade palace. The Perfected Mother, having received her mandate, ascended her throne and addressed the assembly in the Jasper Hall. She commanded her attendants, the Jade Maiden Wang Zideng and Dong Shuangcheng, to receive with reverence the golden script of the purple characters upon the azure jasper tablet, the *Azure-Golden Crimson Sovereign’s Conferral Writ*, the *Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, and the *Flying Mystery and Purple Writ*—four items in total—sealing them with the *Crimson Sovereign’s Seal* and entombing them within the Jasper Chamber. She appointed thirty Jade Maidens of the Golden Florescence and thirty Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn to guard the numinous script.

Following the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens regarding postures and rhythms, she proclaimed to the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the numinous mountains, rivers, and seas, commanding their divine officials to submit the names of practitioners every five days, distinguishing merits and transgressions, and reporting them according to rank. The Perfected Mother customarily observes the eight solar terms, and every five days, she feasts in the Cloud Palace, traverses the Five Peaks, surveys the sources of the rivers, and roams the eight directions.

At this moment, the Five Stars emerge in their stations, the sun and moon halt their radiance, the hundred yang forces surge like lightning, molten metal gleams with refined essence, the Heavenly Warriors march as vanguard, and the Five Elders bear the banners. The Perfected Mother customarily rides her nine-hued chariot of purple clouds and flying wheels, attended by five thousand Heavenly Immortals and Jade Maidens. The women ride phoenixes, the men spur dragons; the Flying Immortals in feathered robes all hold floral banners, their reed pipes and flutes resounding in harmonious chorus. The cries of simurghs and the calls of phoenixes echo through the cloud formations, while radiant lights intertwine, the Three Luminaries merge in brilliance. The Purple Lads waft incense to dispel impurities, the Divine Consorts scatter blossoms to bathe the Perfected; the celestial scales unfurl their canopies, purple mists veil the empty courtyard, jade light streams across the firmament, and numinous transformation commands the myriad spirits. At this time, the Six Heavens obey her command, all malevolent forces bind their forms, demonic perversities lose their sight, the heavens grow bright and the qi pure—such is the wondrous vision of the loftiest immortals, the luminous efficacy of the Crimson Sovereign’s cavern-spirit.

*The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Text*
Flying Mystery Purple Qi congeals the numinous root,
The net of Jade Void governs the myriad spirits.
In the emptiness, it billows and coalesces naturally,
Above stand twelve towering peaks,
Jade towers soaring high amid luminous clouds,
Flowing essence and purple pavilions girded with golden portals,
Resplendent jasper halls encircling the Eight Transcendents,
From their midst emerge the Nine Numinous Immortals of Azure Gold.

The Crimson Sovereign Perfected Mother is styled *Essence-Extension*,
Clad in flying azure feathered robes and a morning-infant crown,
In her left hand she holds the Jade Staff, in her right the Numinous Banner,
Commanding the Five-Colored Demons to attend the August Honored One.
She grasps the talismanic registers at the Gate of Life,
Chewing the moon and sipping the sun, inhaling jade springs,
The Net of Separation emits its radiance to refine the five souls,
Internally replete and externally overflowing, the Crimson Palace rejoices.
Golden light shines resplendently, her form perfectly round,
From the new moon she enters the Metal phase, her color murky and profound.

Only the Enlightened One understands these words:
On the fifth day of the fifth month, the essence of the Northern Prime appears,
Engraved in sight is the Floral Canopy leading the Immortal Lords.
Purple Qi revolves leftward with the Dipper’s motion,
Traversing the twenty-eight lunar lodges to enter the Golden Gate.

This is when the Crimson Sovereign reviews the myriad immortals.
Those who illuminate this secret with diligent devotion,
Clothing their forms and concentrating their thoughts to discern its divisions,
Shall perceive the wondrous vision and attain the essential text.
After three years, they shall surely preserve their longevity,
After nine years, they shall ascend the void and don feathered skirts,
Lightly soaring in phoenix robes to ascend Dragon Mountain,
Bowing and rising to pay homage to the Nine Numinous Ones and the Jade Dawn.

The Southern Culmen Supreme Prime Lord states: This is the text of *Congealed Purple Qi and Flying Mystery*, engraved upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, its flowing essence inscribed upon the northern window of the Purple Pavilion, Golden Florescence, and Jasper Hall. The Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder titled this work *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Text of Tortoise Mountain*. The Queen Mother of the West treasures and conceals it; its purport is profoundly recondite, all being the subtle rhythms of the Nine Heavens. Without an immortal name, one cannot approach its chapters. Those who obtain it are recorded in the Nine Heavens’ registers, their names inscribed upon Tortoise Mountain.

The Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Cultivate this Dao during the ten months of the year—namely, the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth months. On the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—five times monthly—purify yourself and recite the text once. After midnight, step into the central courtyard, gaze upward, and observe the Floral Canopy within the Northern Dipper, where Purple Cloud Qi revolves leftward from the Dipper’s net, traversing the twenty-eight lunar lodges before returning above the Golden Gate. If the sky is overcast and devoid of light, perform this inwardly within your chamber, visualizing the method as described. Upon completing the visualization, bow four times toward the Purple Cloud, click your teeth thrice, and raise your gaze to pray:

“The night sky gleams clear, the hidden void reveals the Perfected,
Flowing clouds linger, golden florescence guards the four quarters.
The Crimson Sovereign spreads its radiance, the numinous flies in purple chariots.
This evening, the azure gold bestows immortality,
Fulfilling my supreme aspiration, my body aligns with spontaneity.
I bind my life to the moon’s essence, preserving the root of years and days.
The Three Numinous Ones merge in splendor, eternally abiding on Dragon Mountain.
In the secrecy of night, my devotion is unveiled—may it be as I have spoken.”

Conclude by drawing in Purple Qi twenty-eight times and swallowing it. Practicing this for three years, divine immortals shall manifest signs upon your sleeping mat. Your body shall be enveloped in Purple Qi, your form interwoven with its glow, and your name inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ registers—you shall surely ascend as an immortal.

The Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Though the celestial scriptures number in the thousands, each expounding its wonders, even this single practice suffices to summon numinous immortals to descend, to spread their wings across the Nine Empyreans, to soar through the Jade Clarity, and to roam and feast in the Cloud Palace. Were this not a wondrous method, the Queen Mother of the West would not have concealed it within her inner robe, nor would the Great Existence have left its prohibitions unspoken.

The Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen states: The heavens possess clouds of forbidden qi that encroach upon the divisions of the sun, moon, and Five Stars. In those regions and kingdoms, there are those who align with the Dao and attain immortality as lords. When such omens appear, their signs manifest of their own accord.

The Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder says: Upon witnessing these clouds, perform the rites and prayers as prescribed, not merely on the appointed days. Apply diligent mindfulness, and when the clouds descend, you shall ascend to meet them. Seal this within your heart; do not lightly reveal it to others. If the Dao is divulged, its numinosity disperses, and immortals shall have no means to respond.

*The Highest Primordial Bestows the Azure Gold Crimson Sovereign Jade Text upon the Queen Mother of the West*
The Supreme Primordial addresses the Numinous Nine Heavens and the Ancestral Void: The Queen Mother of the West, named *Graceful Robe*, is the essence of the Nine Numinous Qi of Heaven, the coalescence of the Western Metal’s spirit, the knotting of Purple Cloud’s embryonic bones, the refinement of the sun’s radiance, the inhalation and exhalation of the Seven Luminaries’ splendor. She harmonizes with the morning mist to feast upon the marrow of the Great Yang Phoenix, sips the moon’s essence and orchid brain, congeals within the jade root and golden treasury, binds her cinnabar form, and enfolds her purple heart. Her manifestation is revealed in the Crimson Sovereign’s wondrous chart, her rank exalted among the imperial chariots. She reposes upon the numinous peaks, her heart stilled in the upper clarity, her merits aiding the ten thousand kinds, her beneficence overflowing all life. Holding fast to her singular integrity, she endures through kalpas unending—thus the Highest Primordial bestows upon her the *Curved Florescence*.

Lady Wanjin, by virtue of her golden perfection, is granted the title of "Meditation Mistress of the Western Primordial Nine Numinous Supreme Realized Immortal Mother, Azure-Golden Cinnabar Sovereign." She is enfeoffed to govern Tortoise Mountain, overseeing the primordial registers. In accordance with celestial protocol, she receives the azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, is bestowed the nine-heaven phoenix robes of flying azure plumes, the morning-infant jade crown and phoenix-cloud sandals, twenty-four divine phoenix purple-wheel flying feathered canopies, five-colored ritual banners and spirit-summoning staffs, flowing-gold fire-bells and night-glowing candles, demon-quelling jade talismans and nine-heaven celestial missives. To her defense are assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace and Western Florescence, who attend her at the Flowing Essence Purple Pavilion of Golden Florescence within Tortoise Mountain. Thrice monthly she ascends to the Jade Clarity, twice feasts upon Kunlun, and oversees the five assemblies of immortals, the five marchmounts, rivers and seas, and the ten directions’ numinous officials—none are beyond her governance, as fully set forth in the records.

All ritual protocols follow the ancient statutes of the Jade Terrace’s *Great Possession* and the Three Heavens’ orthodox scriptures. The azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, along with the Azure-Golden Cinnabar Sovereign’s investiture texts, all derive from the celestial norms of the Great Possession Palace’s *Reciprocal Protocol*, composed in the spontaneously arisen chapters of the Highest Mystery’s Empty Cavern. These are conferred upon the palaces of the loftiest realized immortals and exalted sages, not upon neophytes.

As in the Golden Watchtower of the Eastern Florescence and other celestial palaces, there exist protocols for summoning neophytes and fledgling immortals—these too issue from the *Great Possession*’s norms, differing only in rank and dignity. Unless one’s name is recorded in the Nine Heavens or registered in the *Square Cauldron*, one shall never glimpse their contents. Those who do behold their texts are destined for rebirth upon inscribed tablets, their names inscribed in the imperial registers, and shall attain immortality—thus their destiny is foretold in the numinous statutes. On the day of Dao attainment, celestial perfected beings shall descend to receive their texts and investiture.

The Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The golden script and jade characters are engraved upon azure-jade tablets, or inscribed upon green-jade tablets. Each tablet measures nine inches and nine fen in length, two inches and four fen in width, with characters threaded in gold. Two jade lads and two jade maidens attend each tablet, tending incense and overseeing transmission. According to the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*, if a qualified recipient exists within a century, a single transmission is permitted.

The Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: Azure-jade is not within the capacity of mundane persons to employ. If one’s name is recorded in the *Square Cauldron* and one beholds the texts, they may be engraved upon green-wood tablets, with characters threaded in gold, stored in azure-silk pouches. After nine years of burning incense and reverent worship, celestial perfected beings shall descend to bestow the azure-jade tablets.

The Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The primordial registers of initial transformation and the nine *qi* of the primordial cavern coexist with birth. The Highest Jade Sovereign, supreme sage and imperial perfected, all coalesce the *qi* of the primordial cavern to form their names and titles. Their robes, crowns, and adornments all derive from the *Reciprocal Protocol* of the Nine Heavens’ *Great Possession*, while their dwelling places and village names arise spontaneously. Heaven possesses the *qi* of eight assemblies and the revolutions of four transformations, which, through the brazen canopy and jade emptiness, govern yin and yang, initiate the mysterious workings, and bring forth the ten thousand kinds. The transformations and luminous manifestations of the loftiest sages follow the four seasons’ governance, aligning with the revolutions and responding to destiny, advancing with transformation, without decline or aging, enduring eternally. Thus it is said: the Dao has no constant name—this is what is meant.

As the Queen Mother’s virtue repays the Highest Mystery, she is made the mother of the ten thousand *qi*. Thus the Primordial Beginning bestows upon her the title of Cinnabar Sovereign and confers a scroll of the *Primordial Register of Plain Script*, to be transmitted to later sages and immortals. Through it, they may know that the Dao of the Primordial Beginning coalesces spontaneously arisen names and possesses the *qi* of transformation. Those who behold its chapters shall have their names inscribed in reverse upon the immortal registers of the Nine Heavens, their names engraved upon the Cinnabar Terrace of the *Square Cauldron*. With focused contemplation, within nine years they shall attain union with the perfected, repose in chambers of countenance, and transform with the four seasons, soaring through the Nine Heavens.

The Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: The Dao of the Upper Clarity’s *Highest Mystery’s Precious Scriptures* relies upon visualization for resonance and swallowing *qi* for communion. Once one has accessed its chapters, one should clarify the visualizations of the Primordial Beginning’s transformations, discerning their forms, colors, luminous *qi*, and adornments as they change with the four seasons. Then, with eyes closed and without speech, one shall spontaneously arrive; swallowing *qi* without effort, one shall spontaneously commune. Thus, within ten days one shall behold the divine, and within ten months one’s *qi* shall be replete.

Later learners and worthies may diligently refine their contemplation, thereby illuminating the mysterious emptiness and finding the path to immortality.

The Southern Culmen’s Upper Primordial Lord states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the loftiest immortals—visualizing deities, invoking the perfected, ingesting *qi*, and swallowing saliva—yet remain ignorant of the Primordial Beginning’s names, the four seasons’ transformations, and the root sources of luminous manifestations and *qi*, merely close their eyes in vast obscurity and swallow emptily without intent. How then shall the divine perfected descend? How shall *qi* and saliva be replenished? Gazing upon countenances, one perceives only dimness—how much more so in the boundless expanse, where forms and *qi* remain undiscerned. Such efforts are but vain labor in repose, profitless in empty chanting.

The *Primordial Register of Initial Transformation of the Upper Clarity*:
The Primordial Beginning’s August Supreme Elder, born of the primordial jade emptiness’s *qi*, bears the taboo name *Yanshiyin* and the style *Guanwujue*. His form measures ninety million *zhang* in height. During the three months of spring, he wears the nine-*qi* flowing-essence purple-radiance crown, robes of nine-light brocade, and a sash of nine-colored seamless spontaneous silk. Girded with the six-mountain fire-jade, he rides clouds of azure and deep green. When seated, he rests upon nine-colored lions, their brilliance resplendent in the Upper Clarity’s jade emptiness. When visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches and nine *fen*.

During the three months of summer, the Primordial Beginning’s August Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine heads, measuring seven thousand *zhang* in height. He wears a nine-colored cloud crown, a robe of cinnabar brocade woven with boundless radiance, and a girdle of the nine great immortals’ refined swords. He rides clouds of cinnabar and purple, seated upon nine-colored dragons, their luminosity flowing and resplendent in the jade emptiness’s purple clouds. When visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches.

In the three months of autumn, the August Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine phoenix heads, measuring five thousand *zhang* in height.

When visualized, he returns to a height of seven inches and seven *fen*.

During the three months of winter, the August Supreme Elder transforms into a luminous glow of azure and black, its brilliance surging like the moon’s essence. This is the reversal of the jade emptiness’s *qi*, where he refines and receives the essence of the Primordial Beginning. When visualized, he reverts to his original true form.

To cultivate the Dao of the Primordial Beginning, one should, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, bathe and enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times to the August Supreme Elder of the Primordial Beginning. Then, turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the August Supreme Elder assuming his four seasonal forms in the Golden Radiance Palace of the Upper Clarity’s Jasper Heavenly Court, within the Eightfold Brilliance Precinct of the True Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Hall of Light, and softly intone the incantation:

*"August Supreme, opener of truth,
Nine Ways unite in clarity,
Transforming and refining the void,
Illuminating the Upper Clarity.
Shapes divide, radiance shifts,
Four seasons flow in harmony.
I partake of the true,
Merge with truth’s numinous power.
Within, jade immortals coalesce,
Without, the Eight Darknesses entwine.
Eight luminaries lend their wings,
Conveying the cinnabar chariot.
Riding clouds, driving mist,
Whip in hand, I ascend the Upper Clarity,
Soaring through cloud chambers,
To pay homage in the imperial capital."*

Conclude by gazing upward and swallowing nine breaths.

One who knows the Primordial Beginning’s transformations of form and radiance, along with his inner secret names, shall live nine hundred years. After nine years of cultivation, one’s countenance shall commune with the divine, enabling the adept to transform and soar through the great void.

The Lofty Numinous Lord of the Nine Heavens, born of the *qi* of the Primordial Void, bears the inner name *Supreme Vision of the Grotto* and the style *Moving Brahma*. His form measures ninety million *zhang* in height. In the three months of autumn, he wears a golden-flowered crown, a cloud-patterned brocade robe, and a girdle of nine luminous, chiming bells interwoven with a purple sash of intersecting numina. He rides clouds of cinnabar and azure, seated upon nine-colored lions, their radiance blazing in the Upper Clarity. When visualized, he returns to a height of seven inches.

In the three months of winter, the Lofty Numinous Lord of the Nine Heavens transforms into nine heads, each crowned with a sun. His single body is clad in a nine-colored, striped phoenix robe.

During the three months of spring, the Lord of the Nine Heavens divides his form into nine persons, each mouth holding a moon. They wear feathered robes adorned with phoenix patterns, constantly riding nine-colored clouds, seated upon nine-colored mists, their radiance dazzling in the Upper Clarity’s Great Void. When visualized, they revert to their true forms.

In the three months of summer, the Lord of the Nine Heavens unites into a single form, a light of four hues—purple, azure, cinnabar, and red—its *qi* blending and illuminating the nine heavens. This is the reversal of the Great Void’s form, where he refines and receives the essence of the nine heavens. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.

To cultivate the Dao of the True Lord of the Nine Heavens, one should, on the winter solstice, bathe and enter the chamber, face west, and bow nine times to the Lord of the Nine Heavens. Then, turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Lord of the Nine Heavens assuming his four seasonal forms in the Golden Orchid Palace of the Upper Clarity’s Grand Clarity Court, within the Open Brilliance Precinct of the Permeating Truth Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Upper Cinnabar Field, and softly intone the incantation:

*"Ninefold numinous primordial essence,
Refining and transforming the supreme brilliance,
Three harmonies align in radiance,
*Qi* scatters, forms divide.
Emerging from emptiness, entering mystery,
Above yellow, below azure,
Cycles turn with the dawn,
Interweaving the cinnabar chariot.
Wandering the high void,
Reflecting into my courtyard,
Merging with true light.
Divine transformations arise,
Enabling cloud-borne flight,
To sport in the Upper Clarity."*

Conclude by gazing upward and swallowing nine breaths.

After nine years of cultivation, one shall ascend to move the nine heavens, and the divine immortals shall descend to bestow upon the adept the true scriptures. Naturally, one shall ride the nine-colored cloud chariot and soar through the Upper Clarity.

The Jade True Elder of the Nine Heavens, born of the *qi* of the Purple Void, bears the inner name *Prolonging the World’s Brilliance* and the style *Linked Above*.

In the three months of autumn, the Jade True Elder of the Nine Heavens transforms into a light of purple and green, their *qi* intertwining like the sun and moon overlapping. This is the reversal of the Purple Void’s form, where he refines and receives the essence of the nine heavens. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.

To practice the Dao of the Jade True Elder of the Nine Heavens, one should, on the day of the Beginning of Winter, bathe and enter the chamber, face northwest, and bow nine times to the Elder of the Nine Heavens. Then, turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Elder of the Nine Heavens assuming his four seasonal forms in the Cinnabar Numinous Palace of the Upper Clarity’s Open Clarity Court, within the Threefold Union Precinct of the Primordial Brilliance Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Grotto Chamber, and softly intone the incantation:

*"Numinous one of the nine heavens above,
Primordial and self-so,
Containing and refining the eight Ways,
Ninefold true embryonic immortals.
Within, the purple primordial treasure,
Without, the three simplicities entwined.
Transforming radiance, refining *qi*,
Flowing with the seasons’ cycles.
Penetrating transformations, entering subtlety,
My Dao is early apportioned.
Eyes summon divine splendor,
Heart unfolds the five clouds.
Whip in hand, riding the eight luminaries,
I fly into the imperial dawn."*

Conclude by gazing upward and swallowing nine breaths.

Upon completion, gaze upward and swallow nine breaths to conclude.

Knowing the Nine Heavens’ Venerable One’s transformations and manifestations, inscribe his inner secret name upon the Nine Heavens. After nine years of cultivation, one may behold the true spirit, ride the void in flight, and ascend to Jade Clarity.

The Dao-root of the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father is the *qi* of the Primordial Grotto’s root. His secret name is Ninefold Numinous Guide, and his style is Primal Great Perfected. His form spans ninety million *zhang*.

In the three months of spring, he wears a crimson jade headband of seven measures, the Crown of the Treasure Heaven of the Boundless, and dons the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Robe and Divine Cloud Phoenix Sandals. Girded with the embroidered Sash of Plain Numinosity, he ever rides the Azure Mist Flying Chariot, attended by twelve flying dragons. When seated, nine-colored radiant light emanates from him, high above Jade Clarity, his brilliance shifting a hundredfold to illuminate the vast firmament. In meditation, his form extends to nine *cun*.

In the three months of summer, the Primordial Father transforms into a single body with nine heads, each crowned with a sun. Clad in a tiger-fur robe adorned with red phoenix patterns and girded with twelve-colored ribbons, he rides a nine-hued phoenix. When seated, he rests upon the yellow and white *qi*, his luminosity blazing through the void, illuminating Jade Clarity’s depths. In meditation, one reverts to his true form.

In the three months of autumn, the Primordial Father divides into nine figures, all identically robed in nine-colored feathered gowns. Each bears the Dragon Abyss Sword at his waist, a tiger-headed pouch, and the intertwined Sash of Plain Numinosity. Seated upon the nine *qi* of the Dark Void, their radiance shifts and gleams, illuminating the subtle intricacies of Jade Clarity’s Grotto Root. In meditation, one reverts to his true form.

In the three months of winter, the Primordial Father transforms into the radiance of solar essence, intermingling with the purple brilliance. This is the Primordial Father’s reverted form of the Dao-root’s *qi*, further refined into the essence of the Grotto Root. United with the Mysterious Mother, they merge into the dual lights of primordial chaos. In meditation, one reverts to his true form.

To practice the Way of the Primordial Father, on the day of the Grand Year Star, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing northwest, prostrate nine times to the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father. Then, turn north, sit upright, close your eyes, and visualize the Nine Heavens’ Father in his seasonal forms above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Treasure Precinct of the Supreme Ultimate’s Jeweled Palace, the Cinnabar Numinosity Precinct of the Grotto Primordial Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Upper Primordial Kunlun. Softly intone the incantation:

*"Exalted Lord of the Highest,
Primordial Great Spirit,
Uniting true *qi* to rectify the form,
Your splendor graces the Purple Heavens.
Riding clouds, driving the floating,
Interlacing radiance with the eight mists,
Turning the wheel in sinuous descent,
Your Dao shades my body.
Grant me the cloud carriage,
To attend the numinous axle.
Today at the Eight Assemblies,
I humbly present my supreme wishes.
All I seek, all I beg,
Shall be as your grace decrees.
Ever abiding in primal fortune,
Abiding with the Emperor,
Whip in hand, riding the eight luminaries,
I fly into the Jade Dawn."*

Upon completion, gaze upward and swallow nine breaths to conclude.

After nine years of practice, one may witness his true form. The Primordial Father descends to your side, converses with you, and bestows the precious scripture, the Nine Heavens’ Upper Register, inscribed on jade tablets. Your body ascends to Upper Clarity.

To recklessly divulge this Way is to consign oneself to the offices of the ghostly bureaucracy, bringing calamity upon seven generations, who shall forever toil in the River’s source.

The Dao-apex of the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Mother is the *qi* of the Grotto Abyss. Her secret name is Bearing Chaos, and her style is Yellow Great Cover. Her form spans seventy million *zhang*.

In the three months of autumn, she wears the Purple Primordial Dark-Yellow Treasure Crown and dons the Frosty Gauze Robe of Nine Colors, woven with luminous green spirit-light brocade. Adorned with twelve-colored intertwined ribbons of numinous purple, she ever rides the Purple Cloud Flying Wheel, attended by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six immortals. When seated, she rests upon nine-colored lions, her radiance flowing and gleaming high above Upper Clarity. In meditation, her form extends to six *cun* and six *fen*.

In the three months of winter, the Mysterious Mother transforms into a human-headed crow-mouthed figure, her beak holding the essence of the moon. Clad in a flying gauze robe of green essence, girded with flowing tassels and the purple sash, she ever rides twelve-colored clouds. When seated, her hundredfold radiance illuminates the subtle intricacies of Upper Clarity. In meditation, one reverts to her true form.

In the three months of spring, the Mysterious Mother transforms into a phoenix-bodied, unicorn-headed figure, her seven-colored splendor adorned with twelve radiant lights, their luminous essence interlacing to illuminate the subtle intricacies of Upper Clarity’s eightfold obscurity. In meditation, one reverts to her true form.

In the three months of summer, the Mysterious Mother transforms into the dual radiance of purple and yellow, like the moon’s brilliance, its five colors flowing and gleaming to illuminate Upper Clarity. This is the Mysterious Mother’s reverted form of the Grotto Primordial’s *qi*, further refined into the essence of the Nine Yin’s Dao-apex. United as the Feminine One, she rejoices in harmony, giving birth to the myriad spirits. In meditation, one reverts to her true form. After nine years, the Primordial Father presents the register in Nanyang, while the Mysterious Mother descends in the Cinnabar Chamber.

To practice the Way of the Mysterious Mother, on the day of one’s life-destiny, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing southeast, prostrate nine times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, turn north, sit upright, and knock the teeth nine times. Close your eyes and visualize the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Mother in her seasonal forms above the Nine Heavens, within the Jeweled Forest’s Sevenfold Radiance Palace, the Jade Treasure Precinct of the Grotto Primordial’s Ninefold Brilliance Settlement. Let the true light descend and reflect into the adept’s Gate of Life below the navel, within the Cinnabar Field Palace. Softly intone the incantation:

*"Triple union, quintuple separation,
Primal chaos merging the dual origins.
*Qi* congeals to form spirit,
Spirit transforms to unite the hun-soul.
The Feminine One embraces the true,
Embryonic breathing births the gate.
Yin essence darkly descends,
Washing and irrigating the wellspring of form.
Refining and transforming luminous radiance,
Numinous splendor arises naturally.
Today I humbly present my plea,
Mysterious Mother, reveal your grace.
Twelve supreme wishes,
Preserve and perfect the Jade Perfected.
Five forms receive the effulgence,
Bones refined into jade immortals.
Lightened body, soaring flight,
Riding the void, interlacing mists,
Ascending to the Purple Ultimate,
To attend and behold the divine countenance."*

Upon completion, gaze upward and swallow twenty-seven breaths to conclude.

After nine years of practice, the Mysterious Mother is moved to joy, as the dual radiance harmonizes. The Northern Emperor is stirred to erase one’s name from the register of death, and the Nine Heavens’ Record of the Purple Scroll is bestowed. One may behold her true form and ascend to Upper Clarity in flight.

To recklessly divulge this Way is to die and be consigned to the River’s source, with seven generations bearing servitude, enduring ten sufferings and eight hardships—blade mountains, sword trees—through ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Those who obtain it must treasure its secrecy, for they shall naturally attain immortality.

The August Elder of the Three Heavens, Person of Ten Thousand Zhang, is the primordial qi of the Void Cavern. His taboo name is Shang Dingba, and his style is Ming Fanzong. His form measures three hundred thousand zhang in height. In the three months of spring, he wears a crown of Seven Treasures adorned with penetrating essence, dons a robe of flying clouds and flowing-light purple brocade, and bears the divine seal of the Single August Mandate.

This is the August Elder of the Three Heavens reverting to the qi of the Void Cavern, further refining the essence of the August Elder of the Three Heavens. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.

To cultivate the Way of the August Elder of the Three Heavens, Person of Ten Thousand Zhang, one must on the days of *jiazi* and *gengshen*, bathe, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing west, bow thrice in reverence. After paying homage to the August Elder of the Three Heavens, Person of Ten Thousand Zhang, turn north and sit upright. Knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and visualize the August Elder of the Three Heavens in his four seasonal forms, residing in the Jade Flow Palace of Upper Clarity, within the Golden Fusion Prefecture at the Open Village of Primordial Rectitude. As the true form descends and reflects, it enters the canopy of the practitioner’s radiance. Then softly intone:

*"Three Spirits transform and change,
Five gods intermingle and commune.
Within, I contain the Golden Immortal;
Without, I refine my true visage.
Jade Pool’s flowery dew
Moistens the Purple Chamber.
The returning true form casts its shade,
Illuminating the Five Palaces.
Inner fragrance and outer purity,
Bones like orchid, stomach like musk.
Nine apertures receive the numinous,
Immortal light overflows and fills.
I ascend upon flying clouds,
Rising into the Emperor’s Hall."*

Upon completion, swallow twenty-seven breaths to conclude.

This is the secret scripture of the Nine Heavens, mystically transmitted to perfect the Realized One. After nine years of cultivation, one may meet the True One face to face, have their name inscribed in the Emperor’s register, and be listed in the charts of the Three Primordials. To recklessly divulge or slight this Way is to be punished by the Nine Heavens’ Blade of Wind, with nine generations condemned to servitude, barred from entering immortality.

To cultivate the Way of the Jade Lad of the Three Heavens, one must on the day of the Great Year Star, purify, and enter the chamber. Facing south, bow thrice in reverence. After paying homage to the Jade Lad of the Three Heavens, turn north and sit upright. Knock the teeth three times, close the eyes, and visualize the Jade Lad of the Three Heavens in his four seasonal forms, residing in the Jasper Upper Palace of Upper Clarity, within the Cinnabar Bright Prefecture at the Primordial Rectitude Village of the Three Pure Realms. As the true form descends and reflects, it enters between the practitioner’s brows. Then softly intone:

*"Three Lights shine brightly,
Six qi rise in purity.
Containing the true, I solidify my radiance;
Qi flourishes, and flowery life is born.
Golden Immortal parents
Nurture the fetal infant.
A hundred spirits feed and nourish,
Mystically bathing my form.
May my radiance take flight,
Bones ascend, flesh grow light.
Wandering the cloud palaces,
I traverse the Eight Darknesses.
With the Dao, I equal the true;
The Three Primordials share my age."*

Upon completion, swallow three breaths to conclude.

This is the secret Way of the Three Heavens, the Jade Scripture of the Orthodox Unity, concealed within the Palace of the Three Treasures. It must not be recklessly transmitted. Merely seeing its title and cultivating for nine years, one merges with the True One in radiance and soars through the Jade Clarity. To recklessly divulge the Heavenly Treasure is to be punished by the Blade of Wind, with the Nine Heavens piercing the traitor. Seven generations are condemned to servitude, barred from entering immortality.

Facing west, perform nine prostrations to the Person, then turn north, click the teeth three times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Person’s form as it changes with the four seasons, residing in the Golden Palace of the Jade Clarity’s Mystic Darkness Prefecture, within the Convergence of the Six Assemblies. As the true form descends and reflects, it enters the nine apertures of the adept’s body. Then softly intone:

"Ninefold radiance of the Jade Empyrean, divine spirits scatter their numen,
The Six Voids pour forth primordial essence, the exalted flow with refined power.
Merging and returning to the womb, receiving refinement and transformation,
Four cycles complete their revolutions, my Dao gleams with clarity.
The Great One inscribes the record, the Primordial Lord notes my birth.
Five talismans interweave, nourishing my form,
The Three Palaces and Eight Effulgences convey the purple chariot.
I ascend as a flying immortal in feathered robes, emerald skirts and azure brocade,
With paired pendants tied at the waist, golden talismans and jade bells.
The Perfected descends to bestow, enabling my ascent to the Clarity,
Riding the void, treading emptiness, I ascend to pay homage at the Imperial Court."

When finished, tilt the head back and swallow the nine qi.

"Ninefold Dao radiates brilliance, the Purple Empyrean divides its flow,
Three qi merge in chaos, uniting with the Mystic Pivot of the True.
The Dark Numen spreads primordial essence, dispersing and transforming the Upper Void.
The Peerless leads the Aged, the White Prime transmits the talisman,

The Dao coalesces into truth, the Primordial Emperor joins the ranks,
Ascending to partake in the Mystic Chart, flying upward into the Great Void."

When finished, tilt the head back and swallow the nine qi.

Securing and stabilizing the Upper Prime, illuminating my body.

Three transformations, nine unions, conjoining to form the Cavern Gate.

His true form descends and reflects into the opening of your nine intestines, beneath the Hidden Wish. Then recite the incantation:

The Great Mystery generates the divine, safeguarding and stabilizing the Gate of Life. The hidden corpse dissolves and vanishes; the spirit is pacified, the hun-soul settled. Reverting the light to the Emperor’s chamber, one receives the Jade Maidens of the Immortals. The Great One carries and uplifts, joining the assembly of the Emperor’s guests. Long abiding in the Golden Chamber, years merge with the mist of months. Endlessly partaking, one’s lifespan connects with Heaven.

This is the Supreme Way of the Lord of the Great Mystery’s Immortals, concealed within the Golden Chamber and Jade Casket. Emerging but once in ten thousand kalpas, those who attain it do not die; those who practice it become divine immortals.

Essence and hun-soul face the Emperor’s child.
Five talismans safeguard the register of life,
Passing through years as at kalpa’s dawn.
The flying cloud chariot of the Eight Effulgences
Ascends you to the Cloud Gate’s realm.
The body soars into the Great Void,
The dead soul suddenly revives.

Conclude by raising the head and swallowing eight times to finish.

This is the Mysterious Secret Way of the Upper Clarity, concealed by the Most High in the Golden Register. Those who attain it do not die; those who practice it ascend as flying immortals. To lightly reveal the sacred text condemns seven generations to servitude, while one’s own life perishes, bearing guilt in the dark mountains.

The Lord of the Azure Lad of the Highest Dawn, the Jade Guardian King of the Eastern Florescence’s Square Simurgh Palace, is the *qi* of the Primordial Solar Essence, his form stretching seventy million *zhang* in length. In the three months of spring, he wears the Azure Floral Treasure Dawn Crown upon his head, clad in an azure feathered flying cloak and azure brocade flying skirt, girded with the Azure Essence Sword of Luminous Passage, holding a nine-colored demon banner in hand and bearing the talisman of the Divine Tiger. Seated upon azure clouds amidst purple mist, envision him reverting to a length of seven *cun* and seven *fen*.

To cultivate the Way of the Azure Lad, on the day of the Beginning of Winter, as well as on one’s natal day, the days of *gengshen* and *dingmao*, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. After paying homage to the Azure Lad, turn north and strike the teeth twelve times. Envision the Azure Lad assuming his seasonal forms, dwelling in the Upper Clarity’s Square Simurgh Palace, Azure Prime Precinct, Passage of Radiance Village, and Eastern Florescence Hamlet. His true form descends and reflects beneath the hundred joints and severed nodes of your body. Then recite the incantation:

Azure Florescence blends the distant,
Five paths radiantly divide.
The Golden Dawn erects its tally,
Receiving and upholding the Seven Gates.
The Great One safeguards life,
The numinous banner orders the hun-soul.
Ascending the Yang Mound, the register is passed,
The Prime Duke summons the spirit.
Escorting you to ascend the clouds,
Resting in the Jade Pavilion.
Fortune accumulates by the billions,
Blessings flow by the thousands.
Inscribed in the Eastern Florescence,
Forever partaking as an Upper Immortal.

Conclude by raising the head and swallowing nine *qi* to finish.

This is the Secret Way of the Upper True One of the Eastern Florescence’s Jade Register. When the great kalpa cycles and heaven and earth transform, its text shall appear in the chambers of the Five Marchmounts. Those who attain it do not die; those who practice it transcend the great deluge, ascending in broad daylight. To lightly reveal it condemns seven generations to servitude, while one’s own life perishes, bearing guilt in the river’s source.

To cultivate the Way of the Nine Qi Immortal Sovereigns, one should, on the day of the Spring Equinox, as well as on one’s own life-destiny day and the eighth day of the fourth month, enter the chamber, face the northeast, and bow three times. After paying homage to the Immortal Sovereigns, turn north, click the teeth twenty-four times, and envision the Immortal Sovereigns assuming their seasonal forms within the Upper Clarity’s Pure Primordial Palace, the Court of the Sunlit Valley in the Mingjing Village of Fusang. Their reverted true essence descends and illuminates, entering the root of one’s life-destiny within the great knot of the womb. Then recite the incantation:

*"The Supreme Thearch transforms the luminous,
The Dawn Upholder governs the primordial,
The four qi refine and transmute,
A hundred changes, a thousand divisions,
Entering the womb of the destined,
Severing the roots of death.
The Great One guards the gate,
The Jade Perfected protects the portal.
Delivered from the Three Realms,
The body becomes a Golden Immortal of treasure.
Divine laws overflow,
Feathered wheels unite and ascend.
Inscribed upon the jade register,
The world preserves the source of fortune.
Calamitous death is extinguished,
Reborn as an immortal soul.
The Seven Mysteries soar together,
Ascending to transform at the Gate of the Thearch."*

Upon completion, tilt the head back and swallow the qi twice, then cease.

This is the arcane and secret text of the Supreme Thearch, concealed within the Jade Chamber. Once in ten thousand kalpas it is practiced. Those who attain it endure forever; cultivating it leads to immortality. To recklessly divulge it invites misfortune and punishment, drowning one’s life in the River of Origins.

His reverted true essence descends and illuminates, entering the philtrum beneath one’s nose. Then recite the incantation:

*"The Lesser Existence knots the true,
Conjoining essence and refining spirit.
The great reversion transforms,
Six harmonies, seven divisions.
The Thearch of Unity governs life,
The Peerless guards the soul.
Seven flowers bloom from decay,

Celebrating the deliverance of the Seven Mysteries.
The form unites with sun and moon,
The Three Luminaries link as one.
Riding feathered chariots and roaming,
Ascending into the lofty dawn."*

Upon completion, tilt the head back and swallow the qi three times, then cease.

This is the Golden Standard and Jade Text of the Central Heaven of Xiaoyou. Those who attain it enjoy a lifespan equal to heaven and earth; through cultivation, they ascend to become Perfected Ones.

Preserving the immortal rank of the destined.
Returning to youth, beholding the countenance,
Halting the years, stopping the white.

Forever enjoying the rank of the Mystic Elder."*

Upon completion, tilt the head back and swallow the qi three times, then cease. This is the supreme Dao of the Great Simplicity. Those who obtain it extend their years by millions, and through cultivation, become Perfected Ones, their names inscribed in the Nine Heavens.

The Highest Clarity Primordial Beginning’s Transmutations and Primordial Registers

The High August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sage Lord, the Nine Heavens Jade Perfected—all receive qi naturally, entrust their forms to jade wombs, conceal their brilliance in the Purple Prime, and through numinous harmony and resonance, attain personhood. Descendants of the imperial lineage, born as perfected beings, they knit the hollow cavern to form their script and unite the Three Qi to compose their names. Receiving the title of Thearch, they respond and transform in Highest Clarity, governing the immortals of the High Void, presiding over the Mysterious Mysteries. With the four seasons’ changes, they adjust the nodes and adapt, bathing, donning crowns and sashes, refining and adorning to endure forever. Their transformations of form and shadow respond to resonance and arise, obscure and indistinct.

Thus the Dao has no constant name; its depths cannot be fathomed, its subtleties cannot be exhausted. Heaven and earth rely upon it to stand, the Grand Mystery harmonizes with it to attain clarity. Sun and moon hold to it to shine brightly; the Five Phases receive it to attain numinosity. Vast is its virtue’s origin, boundless its lofty honor. Its Dao is exalted and wondrous, beyond all comparison.

The Primordial Beginning’s recorded registers are concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Supreme Lord’s Sixfold Union Palace. Transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas, they are the Nine Heavens’ forbidden scriptures, not to be heard by ghosts or spirits.

Those who obtain and behold their chapter titles shall rejoice in the flourishing of their ancestral leaves, their blessings flowing to the mysterious root. Their souls ascend to the Southern Palace, their seven ancestors share in the joy. Their names inscribed on jade tablets, they attain immortality in life and death.

Later sages studying the Way of the Supreme Perfected should refine and master the forms of the Primordial Beginning’s transmutations, adapting with the seasonal nodes to communicate with the true, revert the qi, and refine the spirit.

For instance, the Primordial Beginning’s August Elder of the Above, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, receives the qi of the Primordial Jade Void and assumes the title of August Elder of the Above. These are all true forms, their garments of proper colors. Throughout the ninety days of the three spring months, he resides in truth and presides in rectitude. By the day of the Beginning of Summer, the August Elder of the Above transforms his proper form, receiving the seasonal transmutation. Bathing in the divine and perfected, this is called “transmuting the immortal and exchanging the radiance,” communicating with the true and receiving the numinous, causing the qi to endure forever.

In the ninety days of the three summer months, the immortal soul bathes, the divine and perfected resonate and communicate. By the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the August Elder of the Above transforms his form with the season, donning the Five Constants’ crown and sash, called “immortal transmutation.” The qi communicates with the Mysterious Mysteries, filling within and overflowing without. Radiance and brilliance manifest, transforming the true and nourishing the qi, causing the qi to be inexhaustible.

In the ninety days of the three autumn months, donning the Nine Heavens’ crown and sash, the immortal transmutation is perfected. By the day of the Beginning of Winter, the August Elder of the Above contains the true, embraces fetal breathing, reverts the qi to its natural state, liberates the bodily form, transforms the radiance to enter the light, and returns to his primordial beginning. Receiving refinement and reverting the essence, he nurtures and polishes the divine and true. His radiance and color blend into chaos, like misty clouds.

In the ninety days of the three winter months, he congeals the qi and concentrates the spirit, returning to his proper form. Four revolutions complete the cycle, and the cycle renews. These are the Primordial Beginning’s four seasonal transmutations, adapting appearances with the nodes.

The revolutions of heaven and earth all have flourishing and decline, closure and opening, rest and activity, responding to the Celestial Pass. When flourishing, they preside in rectitude; when resting, they nurture and cultivate. Donning crowns and sashes, refining the essence, they do not lose their constancy. Thus heaven and earth endure forever, and this is the wondrous Way of transmutation, beyond all recording.

Those who study the true should each follow their season, cultivating and visualizing the host of perfected beings, all according to the method of the Primordial Beginning’s August Elder of the Above. Within eight years, without losing the seasonal nodes, they shall surely cause the perfected to descend, behold the divine forms with their own eyes, and by following the qi’s transformations, ascend and fly into the Great Void.

In practicing the Way of the Four Transmutations, one should follow the season and ingest the Four Transmutations’ talismans.

For instance, in the three spring months, when practicing the Way and visualizing, one should first ingest the Talisman of Eastern Brightness Communicating with the True and Transmuting the Yang Radiance...

In the three summer months of practice, one should ingest the Talisman of Southern Radiance Eightfold Refinement and Fourfold Clarity of Cinnabar Radiance. In the three autumn months of practice, one should ingest the Talisman of Western Essence Vast Numinosity Transforming Radiance and Supporting the Rare. In the three winter months of practice, one should ingest the Talisman of Northern Mystery Profound True Refinement of Radiance and Whispering Wind.

If practicing the Way of the Yellow Emperor, one should ingest the Talisman of the Yellow Above Eight Directions Generating Radiance and Jade Gate during the seasonal transition months.

This is the Primordial Beginning’s transmutation and conjoining of the true to ascend the Dao. Those who practice it shall communicate with the celestial qi, summon spirits to attain immortality, cause divine countenances to descend in winding paths, and reflect them within their chambers. It regulates the practitioner’s form, harmonizes the qi of the Four Brahmā Realms, illuminates the Five Palaces, opens the gates to receive the true, and settles the spirits within the Jade Treasury. Following the seasonal nodes, it binds the immortals, harmonizes yin and yang below, orders the portals of observation, and revolves heaven and earth, encompassing the eight directions.

Its scriptures are lofty and wondrous, the foundation of divine immortals. Those who know its method shall sit and behold the true numina, capable of transmutation and transformation, refining their forms in accord with the seasons. With the myriad spirits at peace and complete, they shall ascend and fly into the Upper Clarity. If kept secret, the spirits descend; if divulged, calamity befalls.

**Talisman of Eastern Brightness Communicating with the True and Transmuting the Yang Radiance**
In the three spring months of practice, when visualizing the spirits and summoning the numinous, one should inscribe it in black upon blue paper, face east to ingest it, and after a hundred days, attain communion with the numinous. After a thousand days, one shall see the spirits; after thorough vision of ten thousand li, one shall sit and behold the natural. It commands nine Jade Maidens of the Azure True, who bring the treasure scriptures of the Azure Palace and the true writings of divine immortals.

Alternatively, inscribe it in blue upon yellow silk and place it to the east of one’s seat or bed. Clad in azure brocade for a hundred days, the Azure Elder shall descend to one’s side, and the divine officials of the Azure Emperor shall attend with sacred writings, shielding the practitioner’s body. After nine years, one shall naturally attain the azure clouds of radiance, which shall bear one aloft in flight.

This is what is meant by "through essence, one senses the descent of spirits, and sits to attain flying immortality." Its script is the essence of the Eastern Azure Radiance of Yang Brilliance, Opening Clarity and Communicating Light. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Nine Origins, whose brilliance illumines the eastern heavens, flourishing in ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad layers. Its essence whirls in verdant clarity, while azure clouds billow in the Great Void. Resplendent splendor shines upon the Nine Mysteries, flowing nectar beyond the groves of fine herbs, and jade springs pour into abysses of ten thousand fathoms. Within the groves dwell flocks of azure fowl, and in the abysses reside the divine kings of the Yang Valley. Above lies the Abode of Primordial Azure, and within stands the Palace of Azure Splendor. The abode contains the palaces of the Nine Qi Primordial Elders, where the Azure True Sage Sovereign is attended on the left by Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist and on the right by Azure-Feathered Numinous Lads. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Tai, driving and guiding the Nine-Light Divine Dragons. In the third month of spring, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the source and flow of the Liver Palace. When the two qi intersect in resonance, transmutation occurs in an instant.

Thus, qi is congealed to form the talisman’s name, and essence is concentrated to form its script. By swallowing its qi, one may instantly behold the divine forms; by consuming its essence, one may transform and enter the Nine Heavens. This is the wondrous numinous transmutation—majestic and boundless in the Great Void, gathering myriad marvels too vast to record in full.

**Talisman of Southern Radiance Eightfold Refinement and Fourfold Clarity of Cinnabar Radiance**
In the three summer months of practice, when visualizing the spirits and summoning the numinous, one should inscribe it in blue upon red paper, face south to ingest it, and after a hundred days, attain communion with the numinous. After a thousand days, one shall see the spirits; after ten thousand days, attain flying immortality. It commands eight Jade Maidens of the Great Cinnabar, who bring the cinnabar chapters of ascending immortality with flowing gold and fire bells.

Alternatively, inscribe it in red upon white silk and place it to the south of one’s seat or bed. Clad in red brocade for a hundred days, the Vermilion Elder shall descend to one’s chamber, and the divine officials of the Red Emperor shall attend with sacred writings, shielding the practitioner’s body. After eight years, one shall attain the vermilion clouds of radiance, which shall bear one aloft in flight to ascend the Palace of Cavernous Yang.

Its script is the essence of the Southern Cavernous Radiance of Eightfold Refinement and Fourfold Clarity. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Eight Heavens’ emanation, whose brilliance shines resplendently, illuminating the eight directions beyond. Its radiance flows and scatters like swift lightning across eighty-eight thousand eight hundred eighty-eight myriad layers. Its essence flames in cinnabar splendor, its light blazing and towering like auspicious clouds billowing in the court of the Great Yang. Jade nectar surges abundantly beyond the flowing fires, where dwell the deathless ones. Above stands the Terrace of the Southern Culmen, and within lies the Palace of Cavernous Yang. The terrace contains the abodes of the Lords of Immortality and the Directors of Destiny, where the Upper Perfected of Great Harmony is attended on the right by Jade Maidens of the Great Cinnabar and on the left by Azure-Round Numinous Lads. They ever gather the beasts of Mount Huo and guide the nine-colored phoenixes. In the third month of summer, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the bright beams of the Crimson Palace. When the two qi intersect in resonant transmutation, numinous transformation arises from the faintest glimmer.

Thus, essence is concentrated to form the script, and qi is congealed to form the stars. By swallowing its qi, one causes the numinous lords to descend to one’s chamber; by consuming its essence, one may fly through the Eight Voids, command the Six Jia, and summon the Six Ding. This is the wondrous Way of transmutation, elevating one’s rank to the Highest Clarity.

**Talisman of Western Essence Vast Numinosity Transforming Radiance and Supporting the Rare**
In the three autumn months of practice, when visualizing the spirits and summoning the numinous, one should inscribe it in yellow upon white paper, face west to ingest it, and after a hundred days, attain communion with the numinous. After a thousand days, one shall see the spirits, and the perfected shall descend to meet one’s countenance. It commands six Jade Maidens of the Great Simplicity, who bring the golden essence, solar radiance, and refined mushroom herbs.

Alternatively, inscribe it in white upon blue silk and place it to the west of one’s seat or bed. Clad in white brocade for a hundred days, the White Elder shall descend to one’s side, and the divine officials of the White Emperor shall attend with sacred writings, shielding the practitioner’s body. After six years, one shall attain the Three Simplicities’ cloud chariot, which shall descend to bear one aloft, ascending in form to the Great Void and flying into the Jade Clarity.

Its script is the essence of the Western Vast Numinosity Cavernous Refinement Supporting the Emperor’s Golden Soul and White Gate. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Six Evolutions’ golden illumination, whose brilliance shines resplendently, illuminating the western lands. It flows and spreads in sixty-six thousand six hundred sixty-six myriad layers. Its essence gleams purely like jade, its light blazing and towering, vast and boundless—above without color, below without abyss. Vast and indistinct, it resembles the layered mists of white clouds, resplendent in...

Above the Cavernous Void’s Golden Gate, the flowing nectar pours into the Smelting Refinement Courtyard. Within this courtyard lies the Pool of Returning Countenance, where immortal lingzhi blossoms are refined. At the Golden Gate stands the Azure-Gold Elixir Terrace, upon which rises the Dragon Mountain’s divine tower. At its center lies the Palace of Primordial Numinosity, and within the tower are twelve Jade Immortal chambers. The Western Florescence Perfected One attends on the left, accompanied by the Primordial Numinosity Jade Maiden, while the Golden Florescence Youth guards on the right. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Hua, driving the White Tiger King. In the third month of autumn, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the true essence within the Lung Palace. The two qi respond and transform in mutual convergence, giving rise to life at the Western Pass. Thus, congealing essence forms talismans, and binding qi forms spirits. One who swallows this qi shall instantly summon the divine countenance; one who consumes its essence shall ascend through the Golden Gate, command the Five Peaks, summon the Ten Directions, summon clouds and dragons, and follow their will. Its script is lofty and wondrous, beyond all praise.

The Northern Mystery’s Dark Refinement Radiant Whirlwind Talisman
In the third month of winter, perform the Dao and meditate upon the spirits to summon the numinous. Inscribe in black upon white paper, face north while ingesting it. After a hundred days, one shall attain spiritual communion; after a thousand days, one shall behold the true. Perceiving the subtle and unseen, one shall converse face-to-face with the divine, command the Five Supreme Mystery Jade Maidens, and summon the Five Stars’ High Consorts, the Lady Immortals, and the Numinous Perfected Ones to ascend the Central Mystery’s Chart of Divine Immortals and Treasured Script. Inscribe in black upon crimson silk and place it at the northern side of one’s seat or bed. After a hundred days clad in dark brocade, the Black Emperor shall descend to one’s mat, and the Black Emperor’s divine officials shall attend with protective talismanic script, shielding the practitioner’s body. After five years, the Dark Clouds shall descend to cover one’s form, ascending into the Great Void and flying to the center of the Northern Asterism.

Its script is the essence of the Northern Mystery’s Dark Profundity Whirlwind Florescence Dawn. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the inception of yin and yang, its brilliance chaotic, now merging, now parting. Five-colored and mysteriously luminous, it illumines the Dark Solitary Heavens, flowing and spreading in fifty-five thousand five hundred myriad layers. Its essence is profoundly obscure yet mutually conjoined, resembling layered brocade clouds, merging with golden blossoms yet without glare, engendering the Five Phases and establishing the Mystery. Its divine transformations are manifest in the Northern Darkness’s wilds, its true nectar flowing into the Frigid Waters’ realm. In the Northern Darkness grows the refined immortal jade cream; in the Frigid Waters resides the Demon-Quelling King. Above is the Seven Dawns’ Florid Canopy; at its center lies the Hall of Vast Numinosity. The Florid Canopy shades the Dark Dipper’s True Chamber, where the August Jade Dawn attends on the right with the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden and on the left with the Jade Dawn Youth. They ever ride the numinous beasts of Mount Chang, driving the Flying Tortoise’s purple wheels. In the third month of winter, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the flowing springs of the Kidney Palace. The two qi converge in divine communion, giving rise to transformations within a ten-day cycle. Thus, congealing essence forms scripture, and binding qi refines immortality. One who swallows this qi shall summon the Seven Dawns to descend to their chamber, gazing upon the divine countenance. One who consumes its essence shall reverse the transformations of yin and yang, summon clouds and dragons, ascend the Florid Hall, and witness the wondrous transformations of the divine script—the primordial origin of Heaven and Earth.

The Yellow Center’s Eight Directions Life-Radiance Jade Gate Talisman
During the four seasons, perform the Dao and summon the numinous. Inscribe in red upon yellow paper, face the Seasonal King while ingesting it. After a hundred and twenty days, one shall attain spiritual communion and penetrating vision, foreknowing fortune and misfortune. After a thousand days, the Heavenly Perfected shall descend, and one shall converse face-to-face with the divine, command the Twelve Yellow Simplicity Jade Maidens, and summon the Yellow Center’s Eight Dao Intersecting True Mystery Record, the Flying Immortal’s Phoenix Robe, and the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Chapters. Inscribe in yellow upon black silk and place it at the center of one’s seat or bed. After a hundred days clad in yellow brocade, the Yellow Elder shall visit one’s chamber, and the Yellow Emperor’s divine officials shall attend with protective talismanic script, shielding the practitioner’s body. After twelve years, the Yellow Clouds shall descend to cover one’s form, and a jade chariot with feathered wheels shall ascend one to fly into the Supreme Mystery’s Palace.

Its script is the essence of the Central Yellow Center’s Earth Mother Jade Gate Life-Radiance Illuminating Clarity. Its qi is the primordial radiance of the Heaven and Earth’s warp and weft, the twelve celestial stems’ transformations. Its brilliance illumines the Eight Directions; its mists swirl and scatter in all four directions. Its light shines resplendently, penetrating the Void, flourishing and guarding the Supreme Mystery’s capital. Its layers number twelve hundred myriad myriad. Its splendorous radiance bursts forth in the Nine Mysteries; its flowing essence overflows into the Four Seasons’ realm. Above is the Jade Capital’s mansion; at its center lies the Florid Canopy’s palace. Within the mansion are the Supreme Dao Lord’s chambers, where the Jade Dawn Sovereign attends on the left with the Flying Immortal’s Feathered Staff Azure Florescence Jade Maiden and on the right with the Golden Numinosity Divine Youth, Leading Immortal. They ever ride the Nine-Titled Numinous Beasts, driving the Supreme Mystery’s Yellow Dragon. They govern the Five Qi to assist the celestial stems, commanding the Twelve Celestial Hooks. They ascend to guide the source and flow of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw forth the Yellow Spirit of the Spleen Palace. The two qi converge above the Muddy Pellet, refining and blending within the Three Elixir Chambers. Thus, congealing essence transforms the spirit, and binding qi refines immortality. One who swallows this qi shall summon the Yellow Elder to descend in form; one who consumes its essence shall emit a diamond hue, their body generating water and fire, their neck crowned with a halo of light. Myriad wonders shall transform, and one shall ascend into the Great Void—such is the wondrous efficacy of this numinous script, its lofty transformations beyond measure.

These Five Elders’ secret scriptures are concealed within the Nine Heavens’ Five Numinous Jade Capitals’ Golden Florescence Purple Chambers, attended by the Five Emperors’ Numinous Youths and the Five Emperors’ Jade Florescence Jade Maidens, fifty each, who burn incense, scatter flowers, and guard the divine script. According to the Nine Heavens’ ancient statutes, they are transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas, all bestowed upon the Perfected Immortals to become True Ones. Should any of the Mysterious Simplicity’s Imperial Charts, inscribed with the Three Clarities’ characters, be destined for later sages, they shall behold the numinous scrolls, cultivate and transform, meditate upon and invoke the spirits, and ingest the jade script. Within nine years, they shall summon the Five Elders to descend to their chamber, converse face-to-face with the Heavenly Perfected, penetrate the unseen and void, sit and stand without substance, transform water and fire, and ascend at dawn in broad daylight. To lightly divulge or profane these teachings shall bring calamity upon the Seven Mysteries, forfeit one’s own life, and consign one to eternal oblivion in the River Source.

When ingesting the talisman, one must face the sovereign of the season and strike the teeth twelve times, then softly intone the prayer:

*"The heavenly wheel turns, the earth revolves,
Four seasons merge with the True,
Five phases guide and refine,
Congealing into Jade Immortals.
The Upper Origin congeals essence,
The Middle Origin transforms spirit,
The Lower Origin nurtures and nourishes,
Distant form returns to the True.
The Three Origins blend as one,
I receive the natural endowment.
The numinous talisman fills and guards,
The sovereign qi billows like mist.
Within bright, without resplendent,
The infant rests in peace,
Descending flying auroras,
Ascending into the imperial terrace."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi five times and cease.

The method for transmitting the Great Register follows the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*: within seven hundred years, three transmissions are permitted; within a hundred years, if a worthy recipient appears, a second transmission is allowed. Master and disciple must face each other in purification for a hundred days, or seventy days. The disciple presents nine taels of refined gold, forty-seven feet of crimson brocade from the cinnabar earth, twenty-two feet of blue cloth, one golden dragon, and one jade fish. Facing north at the altar, they invoke the Nine Heavens to transmit the scripture, while the disciple bares his heart to heaven to receive it. Should the master transmit without regard to the time limit, he shall suffer the trial of the wind-blade. Should the disciple seek the True without sincerity, thus belittling the celestial treasure, his wealth and body shall sink into the River Source, and he shall never attain immortality. The celestial statutes warn to be prudent—clearly and carefully observe these precepts.

The Nine Perfected of the Eightfold Mystery of the Mystic Capital of the Nine Heavens roamed the void, their numinous feet transcending the Jade Hall. Their radiance floated upon the Purple Clarity of the Great Mystery, as the Jade Emperor sported amidst the Nine Phoenixes’ dragon chariot and jade carriage, riding five-colored flying clouds, followed by twelve dragon-drawn chariots. Twenty-four celestial officials and jade maidens accompanied them, along with eight simurghs and white cranes, nine phoenixes soaring and singing in cloud formations, nine-colored standards, ten tasseled banners, three celestial treasure canopies, and nine heavenly mounts flying through the vast sky, arriving directly at the Five Marchmounts and renowned mountains. There, they met with the True Lords of the Five Marchmounts and together declared their intent to visit the Eightfold Radiance Grotto within the cavern-chamber of Tortoise Mountain, where they would meet with the Perfected of the Jade Emperor of the Most High in the golden hall of the grotto. With jade rings, they swore oaths to heaven, obtaining the right to transcribe the grotto scriptures and inscribe their names in the celestial records. The jade characters were engraved upon golden tablets, pledging the mysterious words.

The *Luminous Writ of the Great Empyrean*, the flying splendor of sun and moon, the radiant ornaments of the sun’s chariot, and the dark mushrooms of the mysterious—all were consumed by the Nine Mothers and the True Lord Consorts of the Five Emperors, who descended together. In a single day and night upon the terrace of Tortoise Mountain, the great sages and true officials of the ten directions, heaven and earth, sun and moon gathered, spreading golden couches and azure mats to convene the assembly of celestial sages. Again, they performed the hundred arts of cloud music, praising the natural emptiness of the void, harmonizing a hundred tones. Their long chants and oath-songs soared into the Nine Empyreans, ascending in response to the Heavenly King and the Lord Emperor of Jade Capital.

Upon the completion of one cycle of the numinous hymn, the immortal officials, soldiers, and cavalry of Tortoise Mountain—numbering a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders—along with the Perfected, the Merit Officers, the Flying Generals, the Direct Talisman Clerks, the Jade Lads, the Divine Maidens, and the envoys and officials of the Nine Heavens, totaling nine hundred million myriad beings, obtained the True Talismans of the Nine Heavens, the celestial writings in jade script, and the melodies of the Twelve Phoenixes’ mysterious songs. These were divided into two scrolls, the upper and the lower, stored upon a golden terrace within the Purple Chamber of the Nine Heavens, wrapped in brocade and sealed in a golden casket, locked with silver bolts in a jade chamber. The transmission was commanded to the Lady of Purple Tenuity, who was to bring them forth.

On the day of their unveiling, a pure wind swept through the forests, and the Threefold Simplicity’s clouds illuminated the ten directions. Divine radiance and mysterious brilliance suffused the chamber of the golden terrace. Thereupon, the Lady of Purple Tenuity knelt to receive them, while the True Demons and Kings of the Nine Heavens rejoiced and prostrated in homage.

The *Orthodox Writ of the Nine Heavens* of the Great Clarity’s Mysterious Elder, the *True Jade Emperor of the Cavern-Real and Spontaneous Emptiness*, was expounded within the grotto-chamber of the Jade Capital’s Flowery Mountain, amidst the rosy clouds and kingfisher plumes. At that time, forty million myriad golden lads and ninety million myriad jade maidens attended to his left and right. The grotto-chamber was spread with yellow gold, its couches of white silver, and when the Heavenly Worthy descended, the mats were of yellow and dark cloud brocade. The divine kings and immortals entreated, kneeling long to inquire of the Mysterious Emperor of the Nine Heavens:

*"We humbly hear that the Most High and the myriad sages, the Great Emperors, the jade hymns of the mysterious songs, the radiant splendor of cinnabar flowers, the soaring kingfisher phoenixes, and the dragon-drawn chariots journeyed afar to the capital of the Flowery Emperor. Together, they chanted the Nine Shao and the numinous hymns of Great Harmony, inscribing the cavern-real true writ upon stone to proclaim the Upper Origin’s Great Mystery of Tortoise Mountain, harmonizing with the immortals of the Nine Heavens’ cavern-chambers. The True King of Jade Emptiness commanded the demonic and numinous banners to review the registers of the thirty-two heavens, the canons of sun and moon, where clouds travel and rain descends, moistening the world below. A hundred flowers burgeon together, jade trees with branches of green, blossoms of cinnabar, fragrant gardens and fruit groves, the seven treasures and threefold radiance.*

*The Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Lads of the Upper Clarity, the True Flower Jade Maidens, the Jeweled Chambers of Na Forest, transform and enlighten the multitudes. The lords of kingdoms and emperors, the Jade Lords of the Four Heavens, the Han Controllers and Han Lords, the myriad officials and immortal lords of the ten directions, the hundred demon kings of Human Radiance, soar through the empty void to transform and cover the multitudes. Flying jade cloud chariots, a thousand two hundred mysterious dragon-drawn carriages, thunder and lightning, their brilliance illuminating the ten directions, descend into our chamber, bowing and kneeling in praise and song. The incense and flowers of the myriad heavens, the hundred pipes harmonizing as one, the chiming of jade and the natural bells and chimes, the celestial processional music, the three luminaries of the seven treasures, the hundred harmonies—all delight and rejoice together.*

*The demonic kings and deviant spirits of the Nine Heavens, the celestial emperors, all attend at the side. Flying cloud feathered canopies, twelve silk banners, standards and drums, arrayed before the Emperor, the myriad heavens chanting in unison, praising and reciting together."*

The Twelve Celestial Worthies and the host of perfected immortals and orthodox officials each recite the *Odes of the Cavernous Numinous and the Three Primes of the Jade Treasure*:

The swift canopy wheels with the returning wind,
Ten sages follow the Worthy in roaming.
The numinous odes harmonize with the divine banners,
The purple chariot floats upon the radiant qi.
The Celestial Worthies of the Great Clarity,
Tilt their carriages at the Jade Capital’s corner.
The host of immortals sport with celestial music,
A hundred harmonies naturally encircle.
Together they rejoice, dancing amidst cloud blossoms,
The joy of the assembled perfected—who can fathom?
The jade tortoise within the Seven Treasures Grove,
Chants and praises, wishing to share the same vessel.
The cinnabar radiance illumines the essence of the sun,
Making my heart hesitate in wonder.
The immortals recite the Emperor’s odes—
This joy cannot be matched by mortal schemes.
The heavens chant in Brahmanic tones,
Faintly soaring at the clouds’ edge.
The host of sages sing the *Cloud Melody*,
Jade maidens chant the *Mystic Joy*.
Together they wander the chambers of the Queen Mother,
Lingering by the Jasper Terrace’s balustrades.
The host of immortals, with jade-blossom forms,
Gleam resplendent as orchids and magnolias.
The Jade Pool rinses with pure springs,
The treasure groves of Kunlun Mountain shine.
Gracefully soar the fluttering dragon hosts,
Luminously stands the Purple Phoenix Altar.
At dusk they wander Penglai Isle,
At dawn they face the banquet of radiant splendor.
The divine immortals sport in the eastern hall,
Their flowing brilliance entrusted to literary elegance.

The Nine Elders of the Upper Clarity, the *Cavernous Numinous* and *Innate Void* Perfected Merit Officers, emit the radiance of flying cinnabar blossoms. The Nine Elder Supreme Sage Lords, omens of numinous response, by the imperial resplendent *Prime Void* Jade Mountain’s canonical texts, in the first year of the Human Sovereign’s reign, the *shangjia* year, on the seventh day of the first month, at the Hall of the Seven Treasures Grove within the Chaos Terrace, the Three Prime Jade Emperor commanded the texts of the Nine Heavens to be conferred upon the Cinnabar Elder Nine Emperor Perfected Lords.

To the right: the Cavern Spirit Three Clarities’ Tortoise Mountain *Primordial Void* *Purple Hall* *Golden Chamber* stone-inscribed *Floral Jade* *True Writ* officials, soldiers, and sagely registers.
The Upper Palace’s Proper Position, Middle Prime Envoys, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, Heavenly Perfected King Spirits Great Sages, *Eight Radiance* Three Divisions Generals, Merit Officers and Direct Talisman Clerks, Envoys and Flying Dragon Mounts, Three Primes Perfected Officials, Primordial Sovereign Jade Immortals—all in accordance with the mysterious statutes, let the disciple be diligent and cautious.

At that time, the Supreme Perfection Sovereign Lord, the Lord of the Realm and King of Kings, the Upper Sages leading the Perfected, and the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Emperors—naturally divine immortals with cinnabar radiance, sun-and-moon dragon scripts, the Eight Arts of Immortals, the *Mysterious Flight* of the Seven Luminaries, and jade registers—concealed within the earth the *Mysterious Cinnabar* and *Vermilion Writ* jade formulas. Could the Earthly Perfected’s phoenix scripts be attained?

Since the separation of Heaven and Earth, the hundred poisons have spread, and all creatures—winged, crawling, and moving—along with immortals riding their mounts and the host of Perfected driving cloud chariots, have come to assemble at the imperial court. Hundreds and thousands of sagely Perfected stand guard over the numinous writs, while jade lads and maidens stand in attendance beside the true texts. Within the golden halls and jasper chambers, amidst the seven-jeweled floral groves by the emerald waters, they gather with the jade Perfected, the dragon kings, the celestial treasures and earthly spirits, the Eight Might and Nine Domains’ million-strong immortal officials. In their hands, they hold incense, flowers, banners, and canopies of nine hues and eight nodes, standing resplendent in the vast sky, their brilliance equal to the sun and moon. The hundred sounds flow in harmony, celestial maidens and immortal music fill the air, rare birds and strange beasts abound, a hundred million lions, giant serpents stretching a thousand fathoms—no darkness remains unilluminated, no distance left unlit. The ten directions are wholly radiant, as the flying Perfected tread the void, feasting in jade chambers, golden terraces aglow with precious light, and the eight delicacies laid before them.

Ascending the Cavern Tortoise Mountain to attain immortality, they sup on jasper mushrooms at dawn and rinse with jade springs at dusk, all coming to assemble here. The Twelve Mystic Dragons, purple phoenixes and cloud-serpents, divine birds and sagely *luan*-spirits, cinnabar carriages and feathered canopies of true mounts, the many gods’ resplendent nine-hued radiance, the Five Perfected of Jade Capital, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, Kunlun’s famed mountains, the dragon spirits of rivers and seas—all the sagely hosts of Perfected and immortals, ten million times nine thousand eight hundred ranks, the cloud spirits of the *Purple Void* and Upper Cinnabar Lords, descend with the spirit officials to meet me.

First, the invocation to the Supreme Perfection of the Nine Heavens, the Nine Elders of the *Purple Void* Immortal Capital, the hundred thousand myriad venerable Perfected and sagely immortals, the *Eight Radiance* August Spirits, the natural and the void, illumining the sun, moon, and subtle mysteries.

At that time, the celestial officials spoke this eulogy:

Clouds and purple grace the Upper Numinous Palace,
Naturally a hundred immortal lads.
Literary radiance mirrors sun and moon,
The Nine Elders’ splendor everlasting.
Lunar blossoms gleam in the Three Yang,
Manifesting this union of the Four Vastnesses.
Resplendent, the host of immortals roam,
Infinitesimal, they ascend the Upper Palace.
Halting their chariots at Penglai’s ridge,
They lead companions to climb the lofty peaks.
Sun and moon illuminate the immortal capital,
Where they sport with the Queen Mother’s wall.
A lifetime transcends the mundane dust—
Who can fathom this realm?
At dawn they soar to the Sun Observation,
At dusk they rest in secluded Langfeng.
The immortals lead their companions,
Bright and dim, naturally harmonious.
Jade maidens ride sagely phoenixes,
Divine immortals mount true dragons,
Drifting together in graceful flight,
Feathered canopies solemn and reverent.
They summon me, Wang Qiao’s friend,
To join them soaring in the clouds.
Purple clouds are my domain—
Who in the mortal world shares this path?
The immortals sport amidst cloudscapes,
Cinnabar blossoms unfold in spring’s radiance.
None fail to sing this refrain,
The blessed Dao-ground of the Perfected.
The imperial chariot halts with cloud companions,
Drifting, drifting, they soar freely.
Gazing beyond the Eight Extremities—
Whose power sustains eternal existence?
Sun and moon share benevolence and wisdom,
The empty valley bids farewell to dawn’s light.
Turning to the host of immortal lads—
Who knows the measure of a century’s span?
The Ten Sages welcome the omen-body—
Excellent! Do not forget.
Addressing the worldly scholars,
These immortal lads are not for you.
A thousand years flourish like morning blossoms,
A hundred years bloom like evening’s splendor.
The host of Perfected roam Mount Taihua,
The immortals soar freely.
Turning their radiance to sport at the Nine Doubts,
Above, they wander with the Supreme Perfection.
Infinitesimal, the host of immortal scholars,
Purple canopies tilt with gentle light.
Halting their radiance to rest in harmonious dawn,
The divine phoenixes plot no schemes.
Supreme harmony soars in Langfeng,
Assembling at the ridge, their floral barges gleam.
Nine circuits share one vision—
Gazing back, none share this realm.
Infinitesimal, the Supreme Unity’s palace,
Drifting, drifting, the companions of the Nine Ridges.
Sun and moon gleam with floral radiance,
Their light illumines the true floating.
Soaring *luan*-birds arrange the morning dawn—
Strive on, seekers of the Upper Perfection!
Countless kalpas differ in measure,
A thousand years pass without blame.
Illuminating meetings with divine lads,
Nine circuits follow nature’s course.

To the right: *One Mystic Dragon Riding Purple Clouds to Soar the Void and Chant Eulogies*, recorded.

And these Eight Levels and Eight Gates, thus the incantation:

Clouds fly, Upper Sagely Ones,
Who lead the Supreme Perfection Lord.
Riding dragons, driving purple phoenixes,
They come to the Queen Mother’s palace.
At dawn they feast on jasper mushrooms and treasures,
At dusk they rinse with jade pool’s sweet wine.
Roaming together at the Sun Observation,
Resting amidst secluded Langfeng.
Bowing below the Nine Doubts’ ridge,
Looking up to the imperial center’s zenith.
Stepping calmly to ascend the Five Ridges,
Guiding reins to follow nature’s end.
Ingesting and nourishing to cultivate longevity,
A thousand years without end.
You possess the art of nurturing nature—
Cherish the void and preserve harmony.

At that time, another arrived at the Upper Palace, descending to the Numinous Mystery to bow before the Nine Elders and the Nine Heavens’ Upper Perfection officials. They inquired: The Lords of the Three Upper Heavens, the Perfected and Envoys, the Immortal Capital’s Chief Ministers, the silk brocades of mysterious yellow—then commanded the Immortal Capital’s Attendants to lead the jade lads and transformed immortal maidens to the upper seat, and again to proceed to the Mystery.

If the Nine Palaces command the Supreme Mystery Capital, then summon the *Bright Immortal* and *Supreme Perfection* venerable sagely officials, and command the Tortoise Immortal’s Cavern Chamber to inscribe the stone true writs, the Three Primes’ Perfected registers, the jade lads, Perfected immortals, and envoys. Command the true celestial sagely immortal officials, the Nine Elders and Upper Sages, to ascend in broad daylight, together roaming the *Purple Void*.

We prostrate to see the Upper Perfection immortal officials inscribing the stone numinous writs and jade characters, the natural cavern chapters of the Five Florals’ two eulogies. Their words:

Above, roaming the Five Ridges’ peaks,
Together soaring at Taihua’s observation.
The Three Elders chant jade chapters,
The Three Radiance cavern texts resplendent.
At dusk they recite the jade immortals’ verses,
At dawn they wander until morning’s end.
A thousand years bid farewell to the host of immortals—
Who through ten thousand generations can fathom the reckoning?
Infinitesimal, the Five Florals’ earth,
Serene, the Nine Yang’s Han.
The ridge’s heights host the immortals’ play,
Radiant scenes, spring blossoms in full bloom.
Leading me to roam the cloud peaks,
My heart awaits the divine dawn.
Lofty as a hundred blossoms’ clouds—
Who knows the cloudscape’s clarity?
Warm qi unfolds the cinnabar trees,
Green leaves reflect purple glory.
Above, I ascend the Five Peaks’ heights,
Below, I wander the Four Streams’ numina.
Within the Jade Sovereign’s cavern hearth,
I behold the *Great Clarity* scriptures.

The Nine Elders’ Register of the Immortal Capital,
How sublime the jade-true texts!
May you preserve this longevity,
A thousand years without decay.

Resplendent, the Nine Florals’ Dao,
Gazing up and down toward Yang City.

Invocation:
Spirits soaring, supreme sages,
Divine hosts and perfected officials,
The Nine Elders in their natural state,
The cinnabar of Great Florescence’s truth,
Feasting on the Five Fungi,
Bones sacred, spirit at peace,
Ascending the Five Peaks in strides,
Joining the Shao dance in joy,
Bowing to the numinous immortals,
Gazing up in gratitude to cloud phoenixes,
Fifty years and more,
Soaring and playing amid the clouds,
Riding feathered chariots, dragon-drawn,
Roaming among the Queen Mother’s courts,
Ten thousand kalpas in a single cycle,
Departing the valleys’ lingering,
Treading upon purple clouds,
Swept along by cloud officials.

The *Genuine Talisman of the Tortoise Mountain Cavern Texts of the Supreme*
Those who ingest this talisman for nine years,
Closing their eyes to meditate for a single day and night,
Shall behold the celestial immortals of the Nine Heavens,
Riding dragons, driving dragons,
Soaring through the Purple Void,
Ascending to the Jade Court,
Forever in the company of perfected immortals,
No longer wandering the mortal world,
Attaining eternal peace,
Revolving from you to mao,
Body freed from the Five Sufferings,
The pains of hell’s realms—
These shall surely be extolled in later ages.
Be ever vigilant, ever vigilant.

Amid the Jasper Terrace.
On the seventh day of the seventh month in the jiaxu year of the Great Epoch,
From the Kun Terrace and Phoenix Mountain,
It emerged from the Golden Gate and Jade Portal,
Bestowed upon the Supreme August Purple Tenuity Lady,
To transmit to those of later ages destined for immortality.
Those who receive and uphold it
Shall surely ascend in broad daylight upon clouds,
Becoming companions to the host of immortals,
Gaining audience with the supreme sages,
Themselves becoming lords of the highest perfected.
Swiftly adhere to the mysterious statutes and orthodox decrees.

The Cinnabar Radiance of Nine Sovereigns’ Numinous Elixir, the inscribed chapter of *Pushing the Luminaries*, the script of the Perfected Gazing Afar, transmitted by the Lady of Purple Tenuity.
Consuming this for ten years, the Lady of Purple Tenuity naturally ascended upon clouds to the Golden Terrace, facing the Queen Mother of the West, and became companion to the host of immortals.
The practitioner may write this in vermilion upon purple silk.

The natural celestial script of the Heavenly Writ within Tortoise Mountain’s cavern chamber.
Consuming this for nine years, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness naturally ascended to the Terrace of Cavernous Empyrean, becoming companion to the host of sagely perfected.
The practitioner may write this in vermilion upon purple plain silk.

The golden perfection and yellow radiance of the natural celestial writ within Tortoise Mountain’s left cavern.
Consuming this for thirty years, the Jade Youth of True Splendor may ascend to heaven.
Write this in yellow upon azure silk.

Within the right cavern, inscribe in blue-green upon green stone the natural writ of the perfected, transmitting it to later immortals—be cautious, be most cautious.
When consuming this talisman, write it in blue-green upon yellow plain silk.

For these four talismans, inscribe in blue-green upon white plain silk and hang them in the four directions to subdue demon kings, evil spirits, and their ilk, compelling them to submit.
All immortals and sagely perfected may then roam above the Upper Clarity, ascend into the Purple Void, and together with the divine emperors and transcendents of the highest heavens, ascend to the Purple Terrace and Jade Capital atop the sacred mountains. With the host of immortals and perfected, the recitation of the wondrous scriptures complete, they then enter the Primordial Cavern of Tortoise Mountain to obtain this true writ. Thus say the Most High Venerable Lord, the Elder Lord, and all the sages.
