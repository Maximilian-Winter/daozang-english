**Daily Practice**
In daily use, one must observe dietary restraints and sit upright without a single stray thought, forgetting all worldly affairs to preserve spirit and settle the mind. The eyes should not gaze upon objects, the ears should not heed sounds—guard the heart within, regulate the breath in an unbroken stream, exhaling gradually without interruption, as if present yet absent. Naturally, the heart’s fire descends, the kidneys’ water ascends, and saliva is born in the mouth. The numinous true self attaches to the body, and the path to longevity is attained.

Throughout the twelve hours, one must remain pure and still. "Pure" means no thought arises; "still" means the spirit terrace is empty. The body is the dwelling of qi, the heart the abode of spirit. Where intention moves, spirit moves; where spirit moves, qi scatters. When spirit gathers, the five phases’ true qi coalesces into the elixir pellet. Naturally, a body arises within the body, and the harmonious qi surges through, like ghee pouring over the crown. In motion and stillness, sitting and lying down, one should always feel the body as light as the wind’s passage, the intestines rumbling like thunder. The ears catch immortal melodies, music without strings—soundless yet resonant, drumless yet resounding. When spirit and qi intertwine, the male principle reverses its course. One beholds the inner landscape, speaks spontaneously, perceives the formless, and dwells among the sages. Spirit moves freely in and out, and one’s lifespan aligns with heaven and earth, transcending birth and death.

Do not allow any harm. Throughout the twelve hours, remain pure and still. Spirit is the child of qi, qi the mother of spirit—like a hen brooding her egg. In preserving spirit and nurturing qi, how could they ever part? Wondrous! Most wondrous!

**Excerpts from Master Guan Yin**
Master Guan Yin said: Without the Dao, speech is impossible; yet what cannot be spoken *is* the Dao. Without the Dao, thought is impossible; yet what cannot be thought *is* the Dao. Speech is like blowing on a shadow; thought is like grasping at floating dust. Even sages and wise men become deluded—ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it.

He also said: Those who do not know the Dao yet recklessly divine with intent are like archers shooting at an overturned vessel. The lofty claim to "preserve gold and jade"; the mediocre, "horns and feathers"; the base, "tiles and stones." Is this so or not? Only the one who placed the object knows.

He also said: The Dao can never be attained—what *can* be attained is called virtue, not Dao. The Dao can never be practiced—what *can* be practiced is called conduct, not Dao. The sage employs what can be attained and practiced to perfect this life; employs what cannot be attained or practiced to perfect death.

He also said: One whose emotions are utterly quiescent is a sage; one whose emotions are good is a worthy; one whose emotions are base is a petty person. The utterly quiescent emotion arises from the self-existent void—it cannot be displayed. The good or base emotion arises from nothingness into being—it cannot be concealed. Good and base emotions belong to conscious beings, for only sentient creatures possess them. The utterly quiescent emotion belongs to the unconscious, and beneath all heaven, the Dao is nowhere absent.

He also said: A single spark can burn ten thousand things, yet when the things are gone, where does the fire remain? A single breath of Dao can pervade ten thousand things, yet when the things are gone, where does the Dao abide?

He also said: My Dao is like dwelling in darkness. One who dwells in brightness sees nothing in the dark, yet one who dwells in darkness can see all things in the light.

He also said: A bean does not question the pot, nor does the pot answer the bean. A tile does not question the stone, nor does the stone answer the tile. The Dao likewise does not err—whether questioned or answered. Qi flows to and fro, yet where is the Dao?

He also said: The image of a single revolution is bound within the great void. From its center it ascends to become heaven; from its center it descends to become earth. There is nothing that ascends without descending, nothing that descends without ascending. What ascends is fire; what descends is water. What longs to ascend but cannot is wood; what longs to descend but cannot is metal. As for wood: when drilled, it yields fire; when wrung, it yields water. As for metal: when struck, it yields fire; when smelted, it yields water. Metal and wood are the intercourse of water and fire. Water is essence and heaven; fire is spirit and earth; wood is the hun-soul and humanity; metal is the po-soul and things. That which revolves without cease is time; that which contains and yet abides is space. Only soil marks both beginning and end.

He also said: Though heaven and earth are vast, they possess form, color, number, and direction. Yet I possess that which is neither form nor color, neither number nor direction—and yet it is heavenlier than heaven, earthier than earth.

He also said: In dreams, in mirrors, in water—there too heaven and earth exist. To dispel the heaven and earth of dreams, one must not sleep. To dispel the heaven and earth of mirrors, one must not reflect. To dispel the heaven and earth of water, one must not draw from the vessel. Their being or non-being lies here, not there—thus the sage does not dispel heaven and earth, but dispels perception.

He also said: Heaven and earth are lodged, the myriad things are lodged, I am lodged, the Dao is lodged. If one departs from lodging, the Dao cannot stand.

He also said: Though one’s conduct be most lofty, it does not escape high and low. Though one’s words be most impartial, they do not escape right and wrong. Though one’s abilities be most divine, they do not escape skill and clumsiness. Though one’s appearance be most singular, it does not escape beauty and ugliness. The sage employs these to manifest to the world, and when the world becomes quiescent in them, it sees the sage.

He also said: The Dao has no body—those who respond to the world with Dao are engaged in affairs, not Dao. The Dao has no direction—those who lodge the Dao in things are dealing with things, not Dao. The sage ultimately cannot depart from the Dao to display it to others.

He also said: Maggots eat snakes, snakes eat frogs, frogs eat maggots—each devours the other. The words of sages are likewise: they speak of being and non-being, then of neither being nor non-being, then of transcending neither being nor non-being. Their words are like the drawing of a saw. Only the truly sagely do not cling to a single word.

He also said: The clearer the mind of profit and harm, the less harmony among kin. The clearer the mind of worthiness and foolishness, the less fellowship among friends. The clearer the mind of right and wrong, the less accomplishment in affairs. The clearer the mind of beauty and ugliness, the less resonance with things. Thus the sage blends them all.

He also said: The sage employs speech, action, and thought to be one with others; employs non-speech, non-action, and non-thought to be distinct from others.

He also said: One who takes the sage as teacher of the sage is a worthy; one who takes the worthy as teacher of the sage is a sage. For one who takes the sage as teacher of the sage follows traces and forgets the Dao; one who takes the worthy as teacher of the sage returns to traces and unites with the Dao.

He also said: The multitude use the po-soul to restrain the hun-soul; the sage uses the hun-soul to move the po-soul. The po-soul stores the hun-soul and accompanies it; the hun-soul roams while the po-soul follows. By day the hun-soul lodges in the eyes, by night the po-soul abides in the liver. Lodging in the eyes, it can see; abiding in the liver, it can dream.

He also said: For a fruit to have a pit, it must await the presence of water, fire, and soil—only then can it generate endlessly. If these three are not present, as in great drought, great flood, or barren earth, nothing can be born. Essence-water, spirit-fire, and intent-soil—these three do not originally interact; only humans unite them through the root.

He also said: A cook boiled a crab, leaving one leg on the table. Though the crab was boiled, the discarded leg still twitched. Life and death are but the gathering and scattering of a single qi. Not born, not dead—yet people arbitrarily calculate life and death.

He also said: Without the one mind, the five senses race in all directions—the mind cannot be unified. Without the empty mind, the five phases are all present—the mind cannot be empty. Without the still mind, the myriad transformations shift imperceptibly—the mind cannot be still. If one could unify it, duality would arise. If one could empty it, it would be filled. If one could still it, it would be set in motion. Only the sage can gather the ten thousand existences into a single breath, so that not one thing can enslave his clarity; can scatter a single breath into the ten thousand existences, so that not one thing can inquire into his actions.

He also said: What flows is the boat, yet what causes it to flow is the water, not the boat. What moves is the cart, yet what causes it to move is the ox, not the cart. What thinks is the mind, yet what causes it to think is intent, not the mind.

It is so of itself, yet one knows not why it is so. Only by not knowing why it is so can its coming have no source, its going no place. With its coming having no source and its going no place, it can thus merge with the original essence of Heaven and Earth, neither ancient nor modern.

He also said: Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness—these are the workings of the Creator. All arise from clinging to private perceptions, and thus even when one dispels them with non-being, they remain; even when one dispels them with neither being nor non-being, they remain. It is like revisiting a place from the past—memories arise vividly, which cannot be forgotten or dismissed. The skillful transcend perception by transforming it into wisdom. Do you understand this teaching on transforming perception into wisdom?

He said: "Thought" is like fearing ghosts and trembling, or fearing bandits and panicking. "Perception" is like mistaking millet for sorghum, or jade for stone. Both are drifting illusions without foundation. For example, seeing a strange object gives rise to thoughts of strangeness, which in turn give rise to perceptions of strangeness—yet neither these thoughts nor perceptions have their root in oneself. It is like today: as for tomorrow, thoughts and perceptions cannot be foretold. When tomorrow comes, all the scattered thoughts and perceptions arise from what has come into being—these are called thoughts and perceptions. It is like a rhinoceros gazing at the moon: the moon’s reflection enters its horn, and from this thoughts and perceptions arise, producing the form of the moon—yet the true moon was never in the horn. The myriad things in the mind’s heaven and earth are likewise.

One who understands this teaching sees nothing outside, feels no emotion within.

He also said: Emotion arises from the mind, the mind arises from nature. Emotion is the wave; the mind, the current; nature, the water. What comes to disturb me passes like a spark struck from stone. If one receives it with nature, the mind does not give rise to things, and all remains buoyant.

He also said: Of worthies and fools, the genuine and the false, some perceive them, some do not. Though there are indeed worthies and fools, the genuine and the false, what we call worthies and fools, the genuine and the false, strike against our perceptions. Knowing that all are formed by perception, even the genuine becomes false.

He also said: Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they can command the formed but cannot command the formless. Though yin and yang are subtle, they can command the qi-endowed but cannot command the qi-less. Knowing that my mind is without qi and without form, then Heaven and Earth and yin and yang cannot command it.

He also said: When a person in ordinary times suddenly sees an extraordinary thing, it is always because essence has congealed to make it so. When a person in illness suddenly sees an extraordinary thing, it is always because something is lacking in the mind to make it so. If one knows that my mind can manifest being from non-being, then one knows that my mind can manifest non-being from being. But if one does not believe this, it will naturally not be numinous.

Someone asked: When perception is already clouded, who can avoid belief? He replied: Like a snake-catcher who does not fear snakes, though he may dream of snakes, he feels no terror. Thus the Yellow Emperor said: "The Dao has no ghosts or spirits; it comes and goes alone."

He also said: Someone asked me: "What is your clan name, your given name, your courtesy name? What do you wear, what do you eat?"

"What friends, what servants? What zither, what books? What ancient, what modern?" At that moment, I remained silent, not uttering a single word. When the questioner persisted without cease, I could not but reply: "If you do not even see me, what use have you for what belongs to me?"

He also said: Qi, as a thing, may gather or disperse. The reason I circulate qi is that it has never truly gathered, nor has it ever truly dispersed. That which gathers is born; that which disperses dies. But that which has never gathered nor dispersed knows neither birth nor death. Guests may come and go, yet the post station remains unchanged.

He also said: To confound the world’s wisest is not wisdom but folly; to exhaust the world’s eloquence is not eloquence but inarticulateness; to subdue the world’s bravest is not courage but timidity.

He also said: He who speaks little is not envied by others; he who acts little is not criticized by others; he who is sparing in wisdom is not wearied by others; he who is sparing in ability is not enslaved by others.

He also said: When speaking of a certain matter, one says it is beneficial, another says it is harmful, a third says it may be either, and a fourth says it is both beneficial and harmful—it must fall into one of these. But he who expounds the Dao does not speak.

He also said: Speaking of the Dao is like speaking of dreams. One who speaks of dreams says: "Such gold and jade, such vessels, such birds and beasts." The speaker can describe them but cannot take them and give them; the listener can hear them but cannot receive and obtain them.

Only the adept listener remains unentangled, uncontentious.

He also said: The arts and methods in the world are manifold—some esteem obscurity, some clarity; some strength, some weakness. To cling to any is to engage in affairs; to cling to none is to abide in the Dao.

He also said: My Dao is like the sea—billions of gold cast into it vanish, billions of stones cast into it vanish, billions of filth cast into it vanish. It bears tiny shrimp and minnows, it bears great leviathans and whales. Gathering all waters to receive them, it is not full; dispersing all waters to divide them, it is not empty.

He also said: The people of the world number beyond reckoning. Each person’s dreams differ, and each night’s dreams differ. There are heavens and earths, humans and things, all shaped by thought—so numerous they cannot be counted as dust. How can we know that this present heaven and earth are not likewise shaped by some thinking being?

He also said: Those who die in the womb, those who die in the egg—these too are human, these too are things. Though heaven and earth are vast, they remain unaware. Those who calculate heaven and earth are but confined within their own perceptions. It is like a hand that does not touch the blade, a blade that does not wound the person.

He also said: That which has time is qi; that which is not qi has never known day or night. That which has direction is form; that which is not form has never known south or north. What is meant by "not qi"? That from which qi arises—like fanning a fan to produce wind. Before the fanning, there is no wind’s qi; once fanned, it is called qi. What is meant by "not form"? That from which form arises—like drilling wood to produce fire. Before the drilling, there is no fire’s form; once drilled, it is called form.

He also said: The sage does not differ from the multitude; it is merely that things cannot constrain him.

He also said: Abiding nowhere in oneself, yet form and things manifest of their own. In movement, it is like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Vague as if vanished, silent as if pure. Those who harmonize with it are at peace; those who grasp it lose it. Never preceding others, yet always following them.

He also said: The light and pure ascend with the hun-soul; the heavy and turbid descend with the po-soul. When hun and po are evenly balanced, one dwells among humans. Ascending hun is noble; descending po is base. Spirited hun is wise; oppressive po is foolish. Light hun is luminous; heavy po is dark. Soaring hun becomes feathered; sharp po becomes furred. Radiant hun is spirit; shadowy po is ghost. Their forms, their dwellings, their perceptions, their affinities—all correspond to the Five Phases.

He also said: Love is essence; contemplation is spirit. Though love and contemplation differ, both arise from perception. Only when love is without perception is it like the interlocking of a lock; when contemplation is without perception, it is like the illumination of a lamp. If my perception does not stir, what existence can I have?

He also said: From a single kernel, countless sprouts arise—who knows how many tens of thousands? Though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot sprout a kernel in empty space. From a single hen’s egg, countless birds arise—who knows how many tens of thousands? Though yin and yang are subtle, they cannot hatch an egg from a barren hen. Only that which comes to me can I gather in a single breath, transforming things into myself, so that nothing is not myself. As for the Five Phases—who can alter them?

He also said: Like a drumstick striking a drum—the drum’s form is my possession; the drum’s sound is my resonance. Though the stick has departed, the lingering sound remains, yet in the end, it too fades away. The drum’s form is like my essence; the drum’s sound is like my spirit; the lingering sound is like my hun and po. Knowing how it comes and goes in an instant—what have I to do with the qi of the Five Phases?

He also said: Know that this body is like a body in a dream, appearing as emotions dictate—then you may send forth your spirit to roam the Great Purity. Know that this thing is like a thing in a dream, appearing as emotions dictate—then you may concentrate your spirit to become that thing and traverse the Eight Wastes. This Dao—it can perceive spirit and prolong life, or forget spirit and transcend life.

Inhaling qi to nourish essence is like metal giving rise to water; inhaling wind to nourish spirit is like wood giving rise to fire—thus borrowing the external to extend spirit. Rinsing with water to nourish essence, so that essence does not exhaust; rubbing with fire to nourish spirit, so that spirit does not exhaust—thus borrowing the internal to extend spirit. As for forgetting spirit to transcend life, I have already spoken of it.

He also said: Those who calculate life and death say: death is already existent, or death is already nonexistent, or death is both existent and nonexistent; some say one should rejoice, some say one should fear; some say one should accept it, some say one should transcend it. The more perceptions shift, the more the mind races without cease. Yet they do not know that my life and death are like a horse’s hand or a cow’s wing—originally non-existent, and then not even non-existent. It is like water and fire: though they encounter each other, fire cannot burn them, water cannot drown them.

He also said: When things and I interact, mind arises—like two sticks rubbed together to produce fire. One cannot say it is in me, nor in the other; one cannot say it is not me, nor not the other. To cling to a division between self and other is folly.

He also said: Do not measure others by your own mind; measure them by their own mind. One who understands this can manage affairs, practice virtue, penetrate the Dao, engage with others, and forget the self.

He also said: You see those with serpent heads and human bodies, ox arms and fish scales, ghostly forms and avian wings—do not be astonished by these. Astonishment falls short of dreams; dreams fall short of waking. Having ears and eyes, hands and arms—this is even more astonishing. Great words cannot be spoken; great wisdom cannot be thought.

He also said: The eye sees itself but perceives no color; the ear hears itself but perceives no sound; the tongue tastes itself but perceives no flavor; the mind measures itself but perceives no thing.

The multitude chases the external; the worthy cling to the internal; the sage feigns them both.

He also said: People mistake the absence of knowledge and action for the absence of self, yet even with knowledge and action, this does not impair one’s true nature. The absence of self is like fire—restless and ceaseless, never possessing a self.

He also said: The wall is like the great sea, able to transform into countless dragons and fish, yet the water remains one. The self and the myriad things, lush and flourishing, exist within the great transformation—only their nature is one. One who knows this unity knows no person, no thing, no death, no life.

He also said: Water, sinking, condenses into the five essences; fire, soaring, disperses into the five odors; wood, flourishing, blossoms into the five colors; metal, firm, solidifies into the five sounds; earth, harmonious, nourishes into the five flavors. Their constancy is five, yet their transformations are incalculable. Their forms are five, yet their combinations are incalculable. Thus, the myriad things within heaven and earth cannot be rigidly called ten thousand, nor rigidly called five, nor rigidly called one; nor can they be rigidly called not ten thousand, not five, not one. Some unite, some separate—through this, form is determined, number is determined, qi is determined—yet all is but self-exertion. Things do not know me; I do not know things.

He also said: Birds and beasts now cry *you-you*, now *xun-xun*, now flee in haste; grasses and trees now sprout *zhuo-zhuo*, now stand *ting-ting*, now wither *xiao-xiao*. Heaven and earth cannot retain them; the sage cannot bind them—only the turning of fate sustains them. Presence lies there; absence lies here. A drum does not sound without a drumstick; evenness lies there, oddness lies here—a drumstick does not strike without a hand.

He also said: Though it is one thing, the multitude is deluded by its name, seeing things but not the Dao; the worthy dissect its principle, seeing the Dao but not things; the sage unites with heaven, seeing neither Dao nor things. The Dao is always the Dao—grasping it makes it a thing; not grasping it, it remains the Dao.

He also said: Those who once debated the Dao spoke of it as obstructing and vast, as profound and deep, as limpid and clear, as empty and unified, as obscure and luminous—beware of encountering such descriptions and retreating in fear. The supreme principle of the world utterly transcends words and concepts. Only when one knows it is beyond words and concepts, existing above subtle words and wondrous meanings, does one align with my teaching.

He also said: Affairs have their place in affairs; words have their principles. The Dao has no place in the Dao; words have no principles. Knowing that words have no principles, every word becomes the Dao. Not knowing this, even holding the most profound words becomes an obstruction, a veil.

He also said: People merely recognize that within false gains lies true loss, yet fail to see that within true gains lies true loss; they merely recognize that within false rightness lies true wrong, yet fail to see that within true rightness lies true wrong.

*Tan Jing’s* *Shenghua Shu* states: The Dao’s descent unfolds thus—emptiness transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into form, form into life, and thus the myriad things are filled. The Dao’s application unfolds thus—form transforms into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into emptiness, and emptiness illumined, the myriad things are made free. Thus, the ancient sages explored the origins of obstruction and freedom, grasped the source of creation and transformation, forgot form to nurture qi, forgot qi to nurture spirit, forgot spirit to nurture emptiness. Emptiness and fullness interpenetrate—this is called the Great Harmony. Thus, concealed, it is primordial essence; applied, it is the myriad spirits; contained, it is the Great One; released, it is the Great Clarity. Therefore, Kan and Li wax and wane within the body; wind and clouds issue forth from the seven orifices. True qi steams and rises, and the seasons know no cold or heat; pure yang flows and circulates, and the people know no death or life—this is the way of spiritual transformation.

He also said: Before the empty void, one sees the clod but not the void. Grinding the clod to seek the void, one sees the void but not the clod. Form does not hinder, yet people hinder themselves; things do not stagnate, yet people stagnate themselves. The dragon treads the empty void—void is not nothing. It can solidify metal and stone—metal and stone are not being. Being and non-being interpenetrate; self and things are the same. Its birth is not a beginning; its death is not an end. One who knows this Dao cannot be destroyed in form, cannot be lost in spirit.

The child plays with its shadow, unaware it is the shadow playing with the child. The madman mocks the statue, unaware it is the statue mocking the madman. The one who transforms the household does not know they are transformed by the household; the one who transforms the state does not know they are transformed by the state; the one who transforms the world does not know they are transformed by the world.

Emptiness transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into blood, blood into form, form into infancy, infancy into childhood, childhood into youth, youth into maturity, maturity into old age, old age into death, death back into emptiness, emptiness back into spirit, spirit back into qi, qi back into things. Transformation upon transformation is unceasing, like a ring without end. The myriad things do not desire life, yet cannot but live; they do not desire death, yet cannot but die. One who comprehends this principle may keep spirit from transforming, form from being born.

Nails and hair are part of my form, yet cutting nails causes no harm, severing hair causes no pain—for they lie beyond the reach of *ying* and *wei*. Thus, I am originally unharmed, yet sinews and bones harm me; I am originally without pain, yet flesh and blood pain me. Joy and anger do not arise from me; sorrow and happiness do not move me. I am obscured by form; form is cherished by me. One who comprehends this principle can transcend beyond birth and death.

The Most High is the spirit of emptiness and nothingness. Heaven and earth are the spirits of yin and yang. Humans and insects are the spirits of blood and flesh. What they share is spirit; what differs is form. Thus, form is not numinous, yet qi is numinous; qi is not numinous, yet sound is numinous; waking is not numinous, yet dreams are numinous; life is not numinous, yet death is numinous.

Water, at its utmost clarity, congeals into ice that is no longer clear; spirit, at its utmost luminosity, congeals into form that is no longer luminous. When ice melts, clarity returns; when form scatters, luminosity returns. One who knows the truth of death may wander the capital of the Most High.

The void transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into qi, qi transforms into form—form and qi intermingle to produce sound. The ear does not listen to sound; sound comes to it of its own accord. The valley does not respond to echoes; echoes fill it of their own accord. The ear is a small aperture; the valley, a great one. A mountain ravine is a small valley; heaven and earth, a great valley. When one aperture resounds, ten thousand apertures all resound; when one valley hears, ten thousand valleys all hear.

Sound guides qi, qi guides spirit, spirit guides the void; the void contains spirit, spirit contains qi, qi contains sound. Guiding and containing one another, even the faintest hum of autumn mosquitoes or the ceaseless drone of flies reaches everywhere. From this we know that even the subtlest thought is perceived, and the faintest whisper is heard. Only the mechanism of the great person—neither heaven nor earth can see it, neither yin nor yang can know it, neither ghosts nor spirits can glimpse it.

A block of wood, a foot square, placed upon the ground leaves ample room for a person to tread upon it. The same block, placed at the tip of a pole, leaves no room for a person to stand upon it. It is not the object that has grown larger or smaller, but the mind that has become empty or full. Thus, fanning a great heat only makes it hotter; fearing scorching pain only makes it more painful. People have no constant mind; things have no constant nature. From this we know that water can be made not to wet, and fire not to burn.

There are sea fish that use shrimp for eyes—people laugh at them. Yet they do not realize that the ancients used fireflies in bags as lamps, nor that without the sun’s light by day, one cannot travel, and without the candle’s light by night, one is deceived. They see the falsity of puppets but do not doubt themselves; they sigh for departed friends but do not grieve for themselves. Neither the wise nor the foolish understand—only those who embrace pure whiteness and nurture the Great Mystery avoid falling into its mechanism.

The mirror does not seek to reflect objects; objects come to it of their own accord. The bellows does not seek to contain qi; qi fills it of its own accord. Thus, the nose receives scents through emptiness, the ear receives sounds through emptiness, the eye receives colors through emptiness, the tongue receives flavors through emptiness. When the mind is as dark as the unseen depths, nothing is not received; when spirit is as void as nothingness, nothing is not known. Therefore, the great person seizes the mechanism and conceals the subtle.

Feathered talismans are most strange; yin fluids are most wondrous. With them, one may guard a kingdom, rescue an age, or sit as the teacher of emperors and kings. Yet the world’s wise and foolish bustle about, laughing at moths that fly into night candles and flies that strike morning windows—knowing how to advance but not how to retreat, seeking profit while courting harm, unaware that profit gathers only to invite harm.

To be wise toward others but not toward oneself—what wisdom is that? To be learned in things but not in oneself—what learning is that? Thus, the great person forgets both profit and harm; what is there that cannot be concealed?

What difference is there between birds and beasts and humans? They have nests and dens for dwellings, mates for pairing, the nature of parent and child, the feelings of life and death. The crow returns to feed its parents—this is benevolence. The falcon pities its unhatched young—this is righteousness. Bees have a ruler—this is propriety. The lamb kneels to nurse—this is wisdom. The pheasant does not mate twice—this is trustworthiness. Who has fully explored their ways? Among the ten thousand things, the Five Constants and a hundred virtues are all present. Yet humans cast nets and snares to teach them the pursuit of hunting and fishing.

Moreover, burning their nests and dens is not benevolence. Seizing their loved ones is not righteousness. Offering them as sacrifices is not propriety. Teaching people cruelty is not wisdom. Causing the ten thousand things to harbor doubt is not trustworthiness. When the desire for rank odors does not cease, the mechanism of killing and harming does not end. Though birds and beasts have no words, they must depict us as ravenous wolves and giant boars. Though fish and shellfish have no knowledge, they must call us great whales and monstrous serpents. How can we be at ease? How can we not feel shame? Alas, one might suspect there have never been true noble persons.

Those who rescue others and call it righteousness—people do not deem them righteous. Those who bestow kindness and seek repayment—people do not repay them. This is the nature of people: yield, and they take more; contend, and they take less. Approach them, and they leave; avoid them, and they come. Give to them, and they treat it lightly; cherish it, and they seize it. Thus, great righteousness has no form; great kindness has no image. When great righteousness is achieved, even the unknowing bear its burden; when great kindness is realized, even the ungrateful repay it.

Those who can sing are heard by those who cannot; those who can dance are watched by those who cannot. The skillful are discerned by the unskillful; the worthy are employed by the unworthy. Those who tend trees must fell them; those who rely on scholars must lose them. They are ensnared with caps and robes, hooked with ranks and emoluments. Like horses harnessed to a carriage, their value is not for themselves; like swine fed on husks and chaff, their fatness is not their own.

Thus, the great person’s Dao is not vainly exalted; their virtue is not vainly preserved. In poverty, they have something to rely on; in retreat, they have something to depend on. Those who retreat do not delight in cold and lowliness and willingly cast themselves aside. Those who do evil fear being recognized—yet there are always those who recognize them. Those who do good desire to be known—yet there are always those who do not know them. Therefore, those unrecognized by others are called great evildoers; those unknown by others are called supreme goodness.

*Master Wu’s Mystical Principles*
The Dao is the lineage of emptiness and nothingness, the root of creation and transformation, the origin of spirit and luminosity, the source of heaven and earth. Vast beyond all bounds, subtle beyond all interiors, boundless and without limit, dark and without counterpart. Profoundly obscure yet unable to be scrutinized, its great brightness sheds light; utterly still and without intent, yet the ten thousand things have their proper places. Vast and formless, silent and soundless—from it the ten thousand images arise, and the five notes are perfected. That which is born has its limit; that which is completed must wane. Birth and completion, completion and birth—unchanging from ancient times to the present.

This is called the Dao.

Virtue is what heaven and earth receive, what yin and yang rely upon, ordered by the five phases, woven by the four seasons. Governed by lords, instructed by teachers, the hidden and the manifest, the moving and the still—all flourish in due measure. Its beneficence flows without end, yet grasses grow unaware of its merit; its grace extends without limit, yet the hundred clans know not their dependence on its power. This is called virtue.

Thus, that which pervades and gives life is called the Dao, yet the Dao inherently has no name. That which accumulates and brings to completion is called virtue, yet virtue inherently has no designation.

Let us attempt to discourse upon it: Heaven and earth, humans and things, spirits and immortals, ghosts and gods—without the Dao, none could be born; without the Dao, none could be perfected. The born know not their beginning; the perfected see not their end. Who, delving into mysteries and seeking the hidden, has glimpsed its source? It enters the end of being, emerges before non-being, yet none fathom its traces—it is called the natural. The natural is the constant of Dao and virtue, the warp of heaven and earth.

*On Dao and Virtue*

Before the great void, what was there in the boundless silence? Through the utmost essence’s stirring, the True One arises. The True One moves spirit, and primordial qi transforms of itself. Primordial qi is the being within non-being, the non-being within being—vast beyond measure, subtle beyond fathoming. Steaming and spreading, it thickens into boundless obscurity; the ten thousand images’ inception, their first signs, arise here. The qi of clarity, purity, and luminosity floats upward to become heaven. The qi of turbidity, stagnation, and dullness accumulates to become earth. The qi of harmony, gentleness, and compliance coalesces into human relations. The qi of discord, rigidity, and perversity disperses into miscellaneous kinds. From the nurturing of this single qi, myriad differences are sown and kinds divided. Once entering the mechanism of transformation, change knows no end.

Thus, the forms of heaven and earth, humans and things, are primordial qi. That which receives the numinous brilliance of heaven and earth, humans and things, is spirit. Therefore, Qian and Kun govern heaven and earth, while essence and soul direct humans and things. Qi undergoes the alternations of yin and yang, but spirit knows no change with cold or heat. Though the myriad movements intertwine beyond reckoning, perishing and reviving, ending and beginning again—yet the body of Dao and virtue, the mind of spirit, respond and perceive without exhaustion, never wearied in the realm of activity.

*On Primordial Qi*

**Essentials of the Chapters**

Heaven and earth cannot exist of themselves; that which possesses heaven and earth is the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate cannot move of itself; that which moves the Supreme Ultimate is true essence. True essence is natural—only spirit, only luminosity. Without ancestor, without origin, without beginning, without end. It contains harmony and harbors compassion, pitying the vulgar and mourning the benighted. Clear and turbid receive different endowments; the true and the common are not the same. Descending qi divides its light, and thus humans are born within. The wise and enlightened, broad in understanding, take universal relief as their work. As rulers and leaders, they enable all things to flow freely.

Pure yang blazes above, and above the nine heavens there is no yin. Pure yin lies darkly below, and below the nine earths there is no yang. The steaming intermingling of yin and yang to generate the ten thousand beings occurs precisely between heaven and earth. Thus, the configurations of qi shift and communicate, obscurity and brightness take form. Yang is bright and upright—its essence is true numen. Yin is dark and perverse—its essence is demonic illusion. Therefore, those born with the endowment of yang’s numen are wise and sagacious; those nurtured by yin’s dullness are fierce and stubborn. Yang delights in life, so the wise and sagacious are necessarily kind and harmonious. Yin delights in killing, so the fierce and stubborn are necessarily perverse and violent. As for those who are sometimes good and sometimes not—these are the mediocre, born of the equal blending of the two qi.

Each of these receives its own endowment—where, then, is instruction to be applied? Instruction is applied for the mediocre. Why? The wise and sagacious know without teaching; the fierce and stubborn, though taught, do not change—both receive the pure qi of yin and yang. It is like fire, which can be extinguished but cannot be made cold, or ice, which can be melted but cannot be made hot—the principle is thus.

That which gives me life is the Dao; that which endows me is spirit. Yet longevity or early death, departure or abiding, do not depend on oneself. Why? Because when nature moves, it becomes emotion; when emotion returns to the Dao, one is thus moved by the mechanism of transformation and cannot maintain control.

To transcend the realm of existence and non-existence, to dwell in the realm of self-attainment—one may take the Dao as teacher and spirit as friend. What does this mean? The Dao and spirit act without acting, and qi transforms of itself; they deliberate without deliberating, and things complete themselves. They enter the ranks of the myriad kinds yet emerge beyond the bounds of life and death.

Thus, the noble person rejects desires, dismantles cleverness, sees without color, hears without sound. Serene and pure, embodying harmony and spirit clear—void and equanimous, forgetting form—one unites with the utmost essence. This is called returning to one’s origin, reuniting with the Dao. Creation cannot fathom it; ghosts and spirits cannot know it—how much less can humans?

One who is attuned to the Dao, though soaring beyond the cosmos, remains ever at peace in heart; though resting within the finest hair’s breadth, qi moves of itself. Thus, if the heart is not at peace, there is nothing by which to unite with the Dao; if qi does not move, there is nothing by which to preserve form. When form is preserved and the Dao is united, this is the virtue of heaven and earth.

Therefore, one who moves yet does not know movement has transcended movement. One who is still yet does not know stillness has emerged from stillness. One who has transcended movement cannot be reckoned by yang. One who has emerged from stillness cannot be shifted by yin. If yin and yang cannot alter it, how much less can the ten thousand things? Thus, one who is not enticed by things is called utmost stillness. Utmost stillness can unite with utmost emptiness. When emptiness reaches its limit, there is clarity; when clarity reaches its limit, there is luminosity; when luminosity reaches its limit, there is penetration. The penetrating one—though heaven and earth are vast and the ten thousand things abundant—cannot escape the mirror of a single square inch.

The Dao encompasses countless numbers yet is not great; it penetrates the tip of an autumn hair yet is not small. It precedes the void yet is not a beginning; it follows heaven and earth yet is not an end. It ascends through accumulated yang yet is not bright; it sinks into layered yin yet is not dark.

Fundamentally, there is no spirit—only when emptiness reaches its limit does spirit arise of itself. Fundamentally, there is no qi—only when spirit moves does qi transform of itself. Qi is originally without substance; when it congeals and accumulates, it forms shape. Shape is originally without sentiment; when it moves and functions, it harms one’s nature. Once shape is formed and nature is set in motion, one drifts ever farther from the Dao.

Thus, one drowns in the cycle of life and death, drifts amid yin and yang, and cannot halt of one’s own accord—not because the Dao exists while things perish. If the Dao can generate being from non-being, how could it not make being merge with non-being? When being merges with non-being, being does not perish.

Yin and yang unite, and thus humans are born. The hun-soul is the yang spirit; the po-soul is the yin numen. They bind the embryo, circulate qi, nurture the body, and construct its form. Yet if their power is not equally complete, each returns to its origin. Thus, when yin prevails, yang is exhausted and one dies; when yang prevails, yin is consumed and one becomes an immortal.

Gentleness, kindness, integrity, and purity belong to yang. Harshness, cruelty, jealousy, and impurity belong to yin. When the mind is tranquil and empty, yang harmony pervades; when intent is restless and desirous, yin qi enters. Understanding these two, when yang prevails and yin submits, is the beginning of long life.

The Dao does not desire a mind, for if there is a mind, true qi does not gather. Yet one should not forcefully forget the mind, for if the mind is forgotten, external demons take residence. Thus, when my mind does not incline, nothing is not upright; when thoughts attach to things, nothing is not perverse. The coming of perversity or uprightness lies within me alone.

Therefore, advanced students who are negligent in maintaining mindfulness are overcome by the yin corpse; those who delight in diligent purity are overcome by the yang spirit. Those who alternate between negligence and diligence remain in unresolved conflict. Resolution lies in disciplined effort and steadfast conduct, in resolutely opposing indolence, so that concentration persists without interruption for even a moment. Those who endure in this practice will see the corpse dissolve and the spirit flourish—this is called yang prevailing. When yang prevails, one draws near the Dao.

Moreover, when the body moves yet the mind is still, when the spirit is concentrated yet one’s traces shift—this is non-action. When one dwells in leisure yet the spirit is disturbed, when one sits in silence yet the mind wanders—this is action. Non-action brings order; action brings chaos. Though non-action is supremely easy, only those of utmost clarity can attain it.

Heaven and earth practice non-action by day and by night; in non-action they are one, yet order and chaos differ—why? By day, non-action is luminous, so the host of yang appears and the multitude of yin submits; by night, non-action is obscure, so the multitude of yin moves and the host of yang rests. Thus, when a ruler is enlightened and practices non-action, loyal ministers advance, treacherous officials hide, and the world is ordered. When a ruler is benighted and engages in action, loyal ministers withdraw, treacherous officials take office, and the world falls into chaos.

Therefore, the wise practice non-action with wisdom, while the deluded practice non-action in confusion. Wisdom aligns with the Dao; confusion merges with things. Advanced students sometimes feel elation, indulging in pride, reveling in their self-satisfaction, believing they can commune with true immortals and ascend to the celestial realms—this is the flourishing of spirit. Though the spirit flourishes, one must still guard against the dissipation of yang harmony and the encroachment of yin demons.

One should enter a quiet chamber, pacify the mind, suppress arising thoughts, and abide in stillness and single-mindedness—thus the spirit does not scatter, and yang numinosity remains whole. One must carefully avoid indulging in feelings of ease and joy, lest yin demons draw near.

If at times one feels restless, competitive, or agitated, this is the refining of the many po-souls within the body by the numinous qi of the spirit, as the accumulated stagnation of the yin corpse disperses and disturbs the true within the Crimson Palace. One should enter a quiet chamber, maintain a firm grip, and await the spirit’s clarity and the mind’s calm, uniting with emptiness and stillness—this too is a method for cleansing the mind.

Words should not exceed actions; actions should not shame the heart. Persisting in such conduct, heaven and earth cherish one, divine spirits protect one, misfortune cannot befall, and ghosts and spirits cannot disturb.

If one’s words are pure yet actions are impure, if one’s reputation is spotless yet one’s traces are defiled—though shame is concealed externally, the heart is ashamed internally. Heaven and earth detest such a one; divine spirits punish them. Though they may strive mightily for the Dao, they cannot attain it.

Thus, it is better to endure slander from others than to incur heaven’s censure. Human slander can still be dispelled; heaven’s censure cannot be evaded. What the Dao most abhors are licentiousness, killing, yin treachery—these are truly easy to avoid. As for minor likes and dislikes, judgments of right and wrong, these are common human tendencies, yet most difficult to guard against.

One should not allow even the slightest matter to disturb the square inch of the heart. When thoughts are still and the spirit is at ease, demonic qi cannot enter; when my will is undisturbed, the perfected become my companions.

Seeking praise and resenting slander—even the worthy and enlightened are not free from this. Yet if one examines oneself and finds no goodness yet receives praise, this is inauspicious; if one reflects and finds no fault yet is slandered, what harm is there?

The essence of yang is the hun-soul and spirit; the essence of yin is the corpse and po-soul. When the spirit prevails, one does good; when the corpse is strong, one does evil. Restraining evil and promoting good brings order; forgetting good and indulging evil brings chaos. With prolonged order, the corpse perishes and the po-soul is refined; with prolonged chaos, the spirit departs and the hun-soul dissipates.

When the corpse perishes and the po-soul is refined, spirit and form unite to become an immortal. When the spirit departs and the hun-soul dissipates, the corpse and po-soul merge to become a ghost—this is the natural Dao.

The eye delights in seductive beauty, the mind values fame and reputation, the body favors light and fine adornments, the mouth craves rare and exquisite flavors, the ear enjoys beautiful sounds, the nose delights in fragrant scents. These six senses all corrupt virtue, harm one’s nature, and sever one’s spiritual root. Thus, if one possesses them, one should distance oneself; if one lacks them, one need not seek them.

Only clothing and food are daily necessities for people, yet even these are one of the pitfalls for Dao cultivators. Nevertheless, one should entrust the heart to natural processes, and there will be no lack of what one needs.

Moreover, when heaven and earth generate birds and beasts, they still cover them with feathers and provide them with insects and grains—how much more so for humans? One must forget one’s pursuits and follow nature.

Waking unites with yang, sleep merges with yin.
Excessive waking strengthens the hun-soul; prolonged sleep fortifies the po-soul.
Those with strong hun-souls belong to the living; those with robust po-souls belong to the dead.
If one consumes primordial harmony, purges rich flavors, and attains a state where spirit is clear and qi is crisp—even to the point of remaining awake day and night—nothing surpasses this goodness.

When the human heart is left to its own devices for long, it becomes vast and forgets to return;
when abruptly restrained, it leaps without root.
Letting it roam obscures one’s nature; confining it wearies one’s spirit—how then can the Dao-seeker attain stillness?
For nature is fundamentally most serene, yet stirred by external stimuli.
Once habituated to movement, how can it suddenly find peace?
Having grown accustomed to movement and dispersal, one may instead cultivate stillness and tranquility.

Thus, those who cultivate stillness well become serene yet abundant;
those who do so poorly grow restless and achieve nothing.
Therefore, when agitation arises, restrain it with calm;
when deviance emerges, guard it with rectitude;
when seeking begins, suppress it with relinquishment;
when turbidity appears, clarify it with purity.
Leisurely and carefree, neither desiring nor scheming—
acting thus, abiding thus, hastening thus, wandering thus.
With long practice, external things grow dim while the inner spirit becomes luminous.
Without seeking stillness, one naturally attains it.

Thus, treading on frost marks the beginning of solid ice;
cultivating stillness is the step toward uniting with the Dao.
As the ancients said: "Accumulated habits become nature."
This is what they meant.

Someone asked: "Many have sought immortality through the ages, yet few have attained the Dao. Why?"
The answer: "Among a thousand who study the Dao, one understands it;
among a thousand who understand it, one aspires to it;
among a thousand who aspire to it, one specializes in it;
among a thousand who specialize, one persists long enough.
Thus, many study, but few succeed."

Another asked: "Immortality is humanity’s highest beauty;
death is humanity’s greatest evil.
All gentlemen know this, yet most follow convention while few cultivate immortality. Why?"
The answer: "There are two reasons.
First, those whose endowment of qi is not lofty find their aspirations difficult to broaden.
Thus, they drown in immediate affairs, forget long-term vision,
are submerged by sensual pleasures and deluded by desires,
ultimately entangled in the world’s net, never stepping into the realm of truth.
Second, though some possess pure and empty qi, with spirit and bearing refined and transcendent,
if their merit in aiding others remains incomplete,
the path to immortality remains distant.
Thus, they linger in worldly ranks, unable to untie the celestial bonds."

Another asked: "The Dao is originally formless, while immortality values form.
To unite the formed with the formless—how can this endure?
Would it not be better to attain the wonder of preserving one’s nature while discarding form?"
The answer: "The Dao is utterly empty and boundless,
encompassing spirit and moving qi, generating being from non-being.
Thus, the vast and obscure is the formless form of the Great Dao;
heaven, earth, sun, and moon are the formed forms of the Great Dao.
The formless connects to the formed; the formed contains the formless.
Thus, heaven and earth endure forever, and immortals and sages never perish.

Life is the great virtue of heaven and earth,
demonstrating the vastness of the six directions and the luminosity of the Three Origins—all because we possess form.
Once we succumb to dissolution, heaven, earth, and the myriad things no longer belong to us.
Death is the bitter poison of human relations.
Therefore, refine the mortal to become immortal,
refine the immortal to become perfected,
refine the perfected to unite with the wondrous,
unite with the wondrous to merge with the spirit.
When spirit and Dao unite, the Dao becomes one’s body—
thus ascending to Jade Capital, wandering in Golden Towers,
able to be and not to be, neither ending nor perishing.
How can this be said to lack enduring principle?

If one mistakes attaining nature while neglecting the refinement of form as the ultimate wonder,
one becomes merely a clear and intelligent ghost—
how can this compare to the lofty immortals?"

The Reverted Origin Daoist Dong □ Chun’s Compilation
*Master Xuqing’s Heart Discourse*

The heart is the origin of the ten thousand dharmas, the master of the nine apertures, the root of life and death, the source of good and evil. It comes into being alongside heaven and earth, governing the radiance of spirit. Some call it the True Lord, for it presides over the body as teacher and elder. Some call it the True Constant, for it transcends antiquity and modernity without decay. Some call it True Suchness, for it remains quiescent and unmoving.

When activated, it pervades the six directions of emptiness; when abandoned, none know its whereabouts. Vast beyond measure, the cosmos lies within it; subtle beyond limit, it enters the tip of an autumn hair yet cannot be sought through form. This is what we call our fundamental heart, the original self before the empty kalpas.

Yet what, truly, is it? Vague and obscure, evanescent and elusive—it cannot be known through knowledge, nor grasped through perception. Forced to name it, we call it the Dao; forced to name it, we call it spirit; forced to name it, we call it nature; forced to name it, we call it heart. Only thus.

Beholding it, how can one not exclaim its greatness! How can one not revere its preciousness!

Yet why do we revolve through birth and death without self-mastery? For when a single thought stirs within, the six senses flow outward—turning toward good or toward evil. Thus arise the retributions of heaven and hell, the karmic consequences, the endless cycles of the six realms of rebirth. How grievous! How lamentable!

The enlightened, however, are not thus. Through fasting and abstinence, they clarify their virtue in utmost sincerity; with the One True settled and limpid, ten thousand calamities dissolve. As *Laozi* says: *"Attain utmost emptiness, abide in profound stillness; while the ten thousand things arise together, I observe their return."* The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root—returning to the root is called stillness, stillness is called reverting to life’s mandate. To revert to life’s mandate is called constancy; to know constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune. What is called *constancy* endures beyond past and present without decay; what is called *recklessness* arises the moment a single thought stirs. *Zhuangzi* says: *"Once you have become a thing, to return again to the root is difficult."* Is this not the way of the *Great Person*?

From this point onward, be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, eliminate defilements, halt thoughts, still the heart, and guard the One. Embrace emptiness, tranquility, and non-action; withdraw the gaze, reverse the hearing; harmonize with light, merge with dust. A fleeting thought’s arising is the illness; its non-continuation is the cure. Fear not the thought’s arising—only the delay in awakening. *Wall.*

If thoughts arise, each morning reflect and order them. Having body and mind, why not act thus? In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, let not a single moment pass without this practice. In the land of *Nothing-Whatsoever*, the realm of *Huaxu*, I shall wander.

**Song of the Great Dao**
The Dao is not far—it dwells within the body.
All things are empty, yet nature is not.
If nature is not empty, harmonious *qi* abides;
*Qi* returns to the primordial sea, and life knows no end.

To keep the spirit within the body unscattered,
let not a single thing linger in the numinous terrace.
If things remain in the heart, the spirit grows clouded,
draining true essence and wasting sinew and bone.

Spirit governs *qi*, *qi* sustains form—
no need for miscellaneous arts to attain long life.
Arts are easy, but the Dao is hard to encounter;
even if encountered, few practice it single-mindedly.
Thus, of a thousand or ten thousand who study,
scarcely one or two ever succeed.

If the spirit departs, draw it back;
when the spirit returns to the body, *qi* naturally follows.
Practice this morning and night,
and the true embryo of the *Red Child* will naturally form.

**Wang Chongyang’s *Fifteen Discourses on Establishing the Teaching***
**Discourse on Sitting in Meditation**

Sitting in meditation does not mean merely straightening the body, closing the eyes, and stilling the gaze—this is false meditation. True meditation occurs in all twelve hours, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, in every moment of movement. The heart remains steadfast as Mount Tai, unshaken and unmoving, sealing the four gates—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and mouth—so that nothing enters from without or departs from within. This is true meditation. One who achieves this, though dwelling in the dust of the world, is already enrolled among the immortals. No need to seek afar—such a one is a sage in the flesh. After three years of such practice, the shell is shed, and one ascends as an immortal. With the elixir formed, the spirit roams the eight directions.

**On Subduing the Heart**

The Way of subduing the heart is not stillness so profound that one is dull and silent, perceiving nothing of the myriad things, lost in darkness without inner or outer, devoid of the slightest thought—this is the heart in samādhi, not to be subdued. If the heart follows circumstances, rising and falling in confusion, chasing after beginnings and ends, this is the scattered heart, which corrupts virtue and power, harms the nature and the life, and must not be indulged.

In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, one must diligently subdue the heart. To hear, see, sense, and know—these are already afflictions.

**On Refining the Nature**

Refining the nature is like tuning a zither: if the strings are too tight, they may snap; if too loose, they will not resonate. Only when tension is just right can the zither be played. It is also like forging a sword: too much steel makes it brittle, too much tin makes it bend. Only with the proper balance of steel and tin can the sword be wrought. Those who refine their true nature should embody these two principles.

**On Transcending the Three Realms**

The Desire Realm, the Form Realm, and the Formless Realm—these are the Three Realms. When the heart forgets thoughts and cares, one transcends the Desire Realm. When the heart forgets all phenomena, one transcends the Form Realm. When the heart does not cling to emptiness, one transcends the Formless Realm. Departing these Three Realms, the spirit dwells in the land of immortals and sages, and the nature abides in the Jade Clarity.

A poem says:
Abandoning wakefulness to learn dullness,
At the place of non-doing, nothing is left undone.
Worldly affairs are but this before the eyes,
While thunder and wind pass unheard at the ear.
The feet wander where they will,
The single spirit ever follows the qi.
At times the four great elements grow drunk—
I ask the blue sky: Who am I?

**Inscription on Sitting in Forgetfulness**

Ever silent, the primordial qi remains unharmed;
Less thought, the lamp of wisdom shines within.
No anger, the hundred vessels flow smoothly;
No vexation, the heart-ground is cool and clear.
No seeking, no flattery nor deceit;
No attachment, neither square nor round.
No greed is true wealth and nobility;
No impropriety fears even kings.
Taste fades, the numinous spring descends of itself;
Qi settles, the true breath lengthens naturally.
Touch, and the form perishes while the spirit roams;
Thought, and the dream departs while the corpse stiffens.
Qi leaks, the form returns to the thick earth;
Thoughts leak, the spirit hastens to the ghostly realm.
Only when the heart dies does the spirit live;
Only when the po is extinguished does the hun flourish.
Turning things, the wondrous principle is inexhaustible;
Responding to change, the true constant is never lost.
Supreme essence hides in the indistinct;
The great image merges with the boundless.
If creation knew its compass and square,
Even ghosts and spirits could not fathom its movements.
No drinking, no eating, no sleeping—
This is the true person’s sitting in forgetfulness.

**Song of the Great Dao by Immortal Cao the Female Adept**

I speak the truth to you all:
Life has always been borne by the true breath.
Illuminating the body, long life is empty yet not empty;
The numinous mirror embraces heaven and holds the ten thousand things.
The Supreme Polarity spreads its wonders, and humans obtain the One.
Having obtained the One, guard it well and never lose it.
The palace chambers are empty and tranquil, the spirit dwells of itself;
The numinous house is scorched, the blood and fluids wither.
A single sorrow, a single joy, a single thought or care,
A single indulgence, a single toil—these gnaw at the form.
Harm at dawn, damage at dusk, deluded and unaware,
The spirit and essence scatter, with no place to rest.
Gradually worn away, slowly declining,
The primordial harmony is spent, and the spirit departs.
They say walking is meditation, sitting is also meditation—
The sage may be thus, but the common cannot.
Tender sprouts must be nurtured,
For the root-awareness is dim and easily shifts.
Wasting time without clearing the thorns,
Who has heard of fine grain growing in a barren field?
After nine years, the work is complete, the fire-tending sufficient;
Responding to things without heart, the spirit transforms swiftly.
The heartless heart is the true heart;
Forgetting both movement and stillness is to leave desire.
Spirit is nature, qi is life;
When the spirit does not stray outward, the qi settles of itself.
These two things were originally close—who is closer?
Lose them, and what remains to grasp as the root?
Merge them into one, then forget even the one—
Then you may appear and disappear with the primordial transformation.
Piercing metal and stone is no difficulty;
Sitting in liberation, standing in forgetfulness—swift as lightning.
This Dao is easy to know but hard to practice;
Forgetting the practice, the Dao is complete.

Do not mistake breath-holding for the true task;
Counting breaths or following diagrams—both are wrong.
Lately, lay down the toils of the external world,
Yet within, the heart is still entangled—what difference is there?
Observe the infant in the womb—
Does it scheme in secret with a calculating heart?
Focus the qi to achieve softness, the spirit lingers long;
The true breath comes and goes, naturally at ease.
Gently, sinuously, it returns to the primordial life;
Without drawing from the numinous spring, it flows of itself.
Thirty-six thousand days make the great work,
The nodes of yin and yang lie within.
Steaming and fusing, the passes and vessels transform the sinews and bones;
Everywhere, light shines, nothing is obstructed.
The Three Corpses depart the yin abode of the corpse;
The ten thousand nations come to pay homage at the Crimson Emperor’s palace.
I ask the true person: Where have you come from?
From the beginning, you were only in the numinous terrace.
In former years, clouds and mist deeply veiled you;
Today, we meet, and the Dao’s path opens.
This is not the work of a morning or an evening—
It is my original true nature, not some technique.
Firm as metal and stone in the cold of winter,
Repelling yin demons with the power of wisdom.
All arises from emptiness and tranquility, returning to concentration—
This is the Land of Peace and Clarity in the realm of Hua Xu.
What was first established as the root?
At the place of non-doing, nothing is left undone.
Images in thought must be swept away;
Spirit in dreams must be firmly held.
Neither movement nor stillness is the great essential;
Neither square nor round is the supreme Dao.
Refining the primordial harmony within makes one true;
Seeking breath without is never complete.
If the primordial qi does not abide, the spirit is not at peace—
Like a worm-eaten tree with no roots, its branches and leaves wither.
No need to speak of tears, saliva, or essence and blood—
Tracing to the source, all are the same.
This thing has never had a fixed place;
It transforms with time according to the heart’s intent.
In the body, when moved by heat, it becomes sweat;
In the eyes, when moved by sorrow, it becomes tears.
In the kidneys, when moved by thought, it becomes essence;
In the nose, when moved by wind, it becomes mucus.
Flowing and circulating, it moistens the entire body,
Yet in the end, it does not depart from the numinous water.
The numinous water is hard to describe—few recognize it—
It nourishes all things through the true qi.
Simply know tranquility and non-thought,
Fast, quiet the heart, and moderate speech.
A single taste of ghee and nectar,
Hunger and thirst vanish, the true simplicity appears.
When the work is complete in time, you will be naturally free—
At first, the refining and cooking were truly arduous.
Yet within arduousness, there is no arduousness;
Leisurely, one need only nurture the primordial spirit.

How then can the heart be made to rest,
When at this point, capture or release lies wholly with the man?
I now suffer within suffering—yet more suffering still—
Eating bark, clad in grass, solitary and still.
Though the heart knows the Great Dao, it cannot be practiced,
For near fame and the body itself are grave maladies.
Better to cultivate in quietude with diligence,
Than to strive anxiously for the Great Samādhi.

Though form and spirit are said to be two and hard to unite,
One cannot complete destiny without first completing nature.
Cease chasing fame and profit,
Sever all worldly ties—then nothing remains to trouble you.
Resolute action lies with man—why linger?
Who else can restrain or command me?
What use are sky-high reputation,
Or swift, polished compositions?
Fine robes and rich food hold no allure,
What good are heaped jade and piled gold?
Clever craft and literary flourish,
Only obstruct the path of cultivation.

Like thin mist or drifting smoke,
Idle, they cling to falling blossoms and willow fluff,
Drifting ethereal between heaven and earth,
Yet in the end, cannot become rain or dew.
Which is closer—name or self?
Half a lifetime spent in idle procrastination.
Of late, cultivation relies on spirit and qi,
Yet if spirit and qi are unsettled, all toil is in vain.
Pity the fine foundation,
A golden hall and jade chamber without a master.
If only the master could dwell long within,
Placed in emptiness and idleness—of what use?
The wondrous existence within non-being is hard to grasp,
To nurture the infant, one must cherish the mother.
Seal away sharp eloquence, set aside cleverness,
Gather the spirit and feign foolishness.
With steadfast heart and single intent, follow the path ahead,
For the Great Dao will never betray man.

*Returning to the True Collection*

For those who cultivate, if one awakens to the ground of the heart and applies effort, one must avoid discrimination. If discrimination arises, it belongs entirely to the realm of thought.

What is effort applied to the ground of the heart?
First, one must abruptly abandon all conditions,
Next, extinguish self and others,
Eradicate greed and wrath completely,
The body like withered wood,
The heart like cold ashes.
Within and without undivided,
All observed as one body,
Luminous and crystal-clear,
The numinous light appears of itself.

This numinous light is the light of spirit.
Light is illumination.
When the light of spirit illumines within, there is no darkness,
And external states cannot invade.
If day and night the numinous light does not fade,
Naturally, spirit settles and qi harmonizes—
This is true cultivation.

As *Zhuangzi* says: "When the universe is at peace, it emits celestial light."
This celestial light is the functioning of the Dao of spirit.
Once celestial light descends,
Yin and yang interact,
The purest essence is released,
Like the sea surging with rolling waves,
A single qi ascends to the Mud Pill Palace,
With a thunderous crack,
All gates and spirit cavities open fully—
This is the arrival of the numinous light.
Naturally, the five viscera generate harmony,
The heart channel wells upward,
The tongue produces sweet nectar,
The nose detects rare fragrances,
Appetite gradually diminishes.
Refining with fire and timing, the dross in the intestines and stomach is expelled,
Clearing the turbid and retaining the pure,
Reversing yin and restoring yang,
Primordial qi fills the abdomen,
Enabling abstention from food,
All yin dissipates entirely.

As the Most High said: "Simply ingest primordial harmony to dispel the five grains."
When such signs appear,
One must not treat body and mind lightly,
Nor let the spirit of wisdom leap exuberantly,
Nor allow the heart to grow lax,
Nor engage in idle discourse on the profound and wondrous.
If harmony scatters,
And prior merit is not carefully preserved,
Losing constancy,
One will be secretly reproved by sages and worthies.

*On Recognizing the Heart and Awakening to Nature*

For those who wish to cultivate,
First recognize the heart, recognize thought,
Then awaken to nature.
What is the heart?
What is thought?
That which can perceive is called the heart,
The myriad thoughts and reflections are called thought.
Thought arises from念,
The heart arises from objects.
Once the root of arising is known,
It lies solely within the square inch.
This square inch is the original true heart.
The heart is originally without heart,
Thought is originally without thought.
Yet from long familiarity, past states are hard to forget,
The heart floats, thought stirs,
Obscuring true nature, preventing its radiance.
One must settle the heart and stabilize thought,
Inwardly observe the heart—serene and unmoving—
This is called *ding*;
Within *ding*, awakened awareness is called *hui*.
*Ding* is the essence, *hui* is the function.
When *ding* and *hui* are both complete,
Daily practice remains unbroken.

*On the Dharma Realm*

The dharma realm is the great void,
It is the great nothingness,
Empty, still, and without form.
If we speak of a year,
It is the eleventh month, when yang builds at *zi*,
Yang light falls to earth,
Sinking beneath the nine springs,
Belonging to the northern *ren* and *gui* water.
All things vanish,
Utterly dark and traceless,
Vague and formless—
The *Yijing* calls this "mountain and water veiling."
Above is mountain, below is water,
Water and fire unjoined, awaiting their time—
This is called "youthful veiling."

If we speak of a month,
To distinguish the dark and new moon phases,
The moon’s end is called *hui*,
When the sun refines the yin essence completely,
Sun and moon share the same crucible,
Light is unseen,
All images vanish,
Yet within, the yin essence receives a speck of true embryo from the great yang,
Dim and obscure,
Hushed and silent,
Like the Supreme Ultimate unseparated,
The Two Modes undivided—
Within lies the image of layered veiling.

*On the Two Carts Transporting*

The goat cart carries fire,
The deer cart carries water.
The goat and deer carts travel between the three palaces,
Up and down without cease.
The upper field returns to the middle field,
The middle field returns to the lower field,
The lower field returns again to the upper field,
The upper field returns to the qi sea,
Joining with true qi,
The three matters gather,
Then fire is rekindled.
This is the fire timing of the celestial cycle,
Called the great ox cart,
Accumulating and refining the golden body.

Beyond the three carts, there is another—
Called the broken goat cart.
Some cultivators,
In accord with heart and thought,
Impatient and excessive,
Yin and yang unceasing,
Dream of heaven collapsing and earth splitting,
Smashing the goat cart,
The body unwell,
Limbs weak,
Illness arises,
The heart becomes demonic.
Or seeing demons and ghosts,
The spirit confused,
Advancing and retreating erratically,
Entering deviant paths,
Unable to attain the true.

*White Jade Vows: Revealing the Secrets of the Mysterious Pass*

A single word or half a phrase may penetrate the mystery—
Why pore over ten thousand scrolls of alchemical scriptures?
If one is not burdened by the form of the body,
Before one’s eyes lies the Great Heavenly Net.

To refine qi and congeal spirit,
One must recognize the return to the root and restoration of life.
Thus the Dao speaks of returning to the root,
For the root has its own aperture.
Restoring life means seeking the Gate of Life-Restoration—
Consider this very gate and aperture.
If one grasps the true reality,
Then returning to the root and restoring life is no difficulty.

Hence it is said:
Whoever seeks the immortal’s secret
Need only search for the root of creation.
Of old, Emptiness gave rise to the spontaneous,
The spontaneous gave rise to the Great Dao,
The Great Dao gave rise to the One Qi,
The One Qi divided into yin and yang,
Yin and yang became heaven and earth,
Heaven and earth gave birth to the myriad things—
This is the root of creation.
This is the True One Qi,
Prior to all phenomena,
The Great Void, the Utmost Non-Being,
The Great Emptiness, the Utmost Mystery.
Vast and obscure, beyond measure by inches;
Boundless and expansive, beyond reckoning by shores.
Its greatness has no exterior,
Its smallness has no interior.
It encompasses heaven and earth,
Yet enters the tip of a hair.
Above, it has no further hue;
Below, it has no further abyss.
A single thing, round and luminous,
Manifesting through the ages—
Unnameable, yet the sage intuits it with the heart,
And, compelled, names it the Dao.

Thus we know the heart is the Dao itself.
Without heart, one merges with the Dao;
With heart, one strays from the Dao.
This single word *wu* (non-being)
Embraces all existence without remainder,
Gives birth to the myriad things without exhaustion.
Though heaven and earth are vast,
They can command the formed,
But not the formless;
Though the Five Agents are most refined,
They can command the numbered,
But not the unnumbered;
Though the hundred thoughts surge,
They can command the conscious,
But not the unconscious.

Now, for those who cultivate this Dao,
It is best to first refine the form.
The subtlety of refining form lies in congealing spirit;
Congeal spirit, and qi gathers;
Qi gathers, and the elixir forms;
The elixir forms, and the body is firm;
The body is firm, and spirit is whole.
Thus Song Qiqiu said:
Forget the form to nourish qi,
Forget qi to nourish spirit,
Forget spirit to nourish emptiness.
This single word *forgetting*—
It is the absence of things.
Originally, not a single thing exists—
Where could dust alight?
This is what is meant.

If one comprehends this principle
And takes *forgetting* as the work,
One may enter the profound subtleties of the Great Dao,
Seize the wondrous functioning of spontaneity,
Establish the foundation of the elixir in an instant,
And circulate creation within the body.
Yet this Dao, when seen, appears desolate and nothing is perceived;
When heard, it is obscure and nothing is heard.
Only with the heart can one see its images,
Only with the heart can one hear its sounds.
If the adept stills the heart and congeals spirit,
Attains emptiness and guards quiescence,
Then the empty chamber generates brightness—
Truly, it is the spontaneous.

Only the Most High, in delivering beings,
Teaches refinement:
Taking heaven and earth as the crucible,
The sun and moon as the medicinal substances,
The rising and sinking of the sun’s essence corresponding to the ascent and descent of qi,
The waxing and waning of the moon’s spirit corresponding to the ebb and flow of vitality,
The seasons of the four quarters corresponding to the hours of a day,
The stars of the celestial revolution corresponding to the transformations within the furnace.

Thus, gathering spirit as the medicine,
Refining it with the fire of stillness and concentration,
One forms the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor.
For the union of true yin and true yang,
The pairing of one water and one fire,
One must first distinguish floating and sinking,
Then clarify host and guest,
Discern the operation of withdrawal and addition,
And examine the safety and peril of return and reversal.
Thus Gao Xiangxian said:
There is a day for gathering,
A time for taking.
Hai Chan said:
The mechanism of creation opens and closes heaven and earth,
Forging a furnace of true sun and moon.

Those who awaken to this
Emulate the functioning of sun and moon,
And share the achievement of heaven and earth.
How could they know that heaven nourishes without form,
Earth nourishes without substance?
Thus heaven endures and earth persists,
The sun shines and the moon glows,
The True One abides forever,
And emptiness does not decay.

Now, I model myself upon this:
No heart for affairs,
No affairs for the heart.
Inwardly observe the heart—
The heart has no heart;
Outwardly observe the form—
The form has no form;
Observe things afar—
Things have no things.
Know the heart as no-heart,
Know the form as no-form,
Know things as no-things,
Transcend the myriad illusions,
And emerge as the solitary numinous.
The ancient scripture says:
It gives me birth in emptiness,
It leads me to non-being.
Thus one should return to the primordial root of nature,
Revert to the time before birth.
Hide the heart within the heart, yet the heart is not seen;
Hide spirit within spirit’s penetration, yet spirit does not emerge.
Thus one may penetrate the three times,
Settle the myriad conditions,
Purify the six senses,
And the square inch of the heart becomes empty and luminous.
Not clinging to emptiness,
Not clinging to non-being,
Emptying all that can be named,
Eliminating all that is without—
Until emptiness is empty of emptiness,
And non-being is non-being of non-being,
Pure, bare, and utterly unadorned—
Then the numinous alone abides.

The Dao does not desire emptiness,
Yet emptiness naturally returns to it.
If one can empty the heart,
The Dao naturally returns to one.
The Dao originally has no name;
It cannot be grasped when near,
Nor abandoned when distant.
It is neither square nor round,
Neither inside nor outside—
Only the sage knows it.

The three poisons have no root,
The six desires have no seed.
Suddenly awakening to this principle,
One returns to emptiness and non-being.
*Laozi* said:
Between heaven and earth,
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
The more it moves, the more it produces.

If, within stillness and concentration,
One embraces the qi of harmonious balance,
And guards the essence of the True One,
This is sealing the furnace and securing the crucible
To enact the fire timing.
Fire originates from the southern *li* trigram,
Which pertains to the heart—
The heart is spirit, spirit is fire.
Qi is the medicine;
Refining the medicine with fire forms the elixir—
Thus it is using spirit to guide qi and accomplish the Dao.

If one can grasp the sun and moon in hand,
Hold the primordial chaos in the heart,
One naturally perceives the opening and closing of the bellows,
The ascent and descent of the river chariot,
Water irrigating the Palace of Life,
Fire nourishing the Elixir Terrace,
Metal and fire intermingling, water and earth harmonizing,
The maiden riding the dragon,
The old man straddling the tiger,
Passing through the three barriers,
Ascending to the inner court,
Transforming into jade mercury,
Descending into the multi-storied tower—
Within it lies a cavity,
Called the Elixir Terrace.

Lead and mercury unite, water and fire merge—
The movement of movement arises from stillness,
The action of action emerges from non-action.

At this moment,
White snow blankets the sky,
Yellow sprouts carpet the earth,
Dragon hums, tiger roars,
Husband sings, wife follows,
The jade crucible simmers,
The golden furnace blazes,
Thunder crashes, lightning flashes,
Shaking heaven and earth,
All meridians tremble,
The three barriers open wide,
The mysterious pearl takes form,
The Great One returns to truth,
Winds stir in the Mud Pill Palace,
Moonlight fills the Crimson Palace,
Mists warm the Elixir Field,
Waves in the Valley Sea grow still—
Refining the returning elixir
Is as easy as turning one’s palm.

Seven reversions, nine returns—
Only then is the great medicine complete.
Refined by day, simmered by the hour,
Until ninefold transmutation is achieved,
The celestial gate and earthly axis
Lie within one’s grasp.

As the scripture says:
*If one can abide in constant clarity and stillness,
Heaven and earth all return to them.*

Thus the three flowers gather at the crown,
The five qi converge at the origin,
One may enter the gate of myriad mysteries,
The profound beyond the profound.

If one further cultivates the spirit banner by day
And nurtures the fiery zhi by night,
Warming the sacred embryo,
Forming the crimson child—
Then, through embryonic transformation and divine alchemy,
Reverting yang and renewing the bones,
One safeguards the spirit with the jade talisman,
Refines the body with golden liquid,
Until form and spirit are both perfected,
And merge with the true Dao.

Zhang Ping Shu said:
*All this takes but a moment’s effort,
Yet secures boundless ease and joy.*
Truly, these are wise words.

For the foundation of the Dao,
The root of virtue,
The origin of dragon and tiger,
The ancestor of lead and mercury,
The convergence of the three fires,
The return of the eight waters,
The gate where all spirits gather,
The source of the golden elixir’s wondrous work—
This is the pivotal aperture of returning to the root and restoring life.

Once this is known,
Desires need not be banished—
The heart grows still of itself.
The heart need not be clarified—
The spirit grows clear of itself.
With no thought arising,
All illusions subside.
The body rides the whirlwind,
The spirit roams the ethereal void.

Only then does one realize:
The breeze’s clarity, the moon’s purity
All reveal the foundation of lead and mercury;
The green of water, the blue of mountains
All disclose the essence of tiger and dragon.

Bai Zi Qing of Hainan,
Who first learned the elixir method from Chen Ni Wan,
Would at the winter solstice at high noon
Open Qian and break Xun,
Retain Kun and block Gen,
Grasp the celestial pivot,
Wield the Dipper’s handle,
Pay homage to the Xuanyuan,
Pass the Fusang,
Enter the Guanghan,
Face the Quail’s Tail,
Raise the Yellow Bell,
Sail the sea raft,
Ascend Kunlun,
Bear the Tang talisman,
Shake the celestial thunder,
Wander Wu Mountain,
Summon the Yellow Lad,
Call the Vermilion Child,
Take the green dragon’s liver,
The white tiger’s marrow,
The red phoenix’s blood,
The black turtle’s essence,
Place them in the earthen crucible,
Awaken the Fire Star,
Command Guan Bo,
Transform cinnabar,
Open the Flower Pool,
Absorb the divine water,
Drink the medicinal spoon,
Move from non-being into being,
From formlessness into form,
Withdraw lead and replenish mercury,
Forming the sacred embryo.
After ten months,
Qi is full, form is complete,
A body exists beyond the body—
This is called the embryonic immortal.

Its secret states:
*With undivided focus, one may concentrate the spirit;
With an ashen heart in profound stillness,
The golden elixir forms within.*
Such is what I have attained.

Master Shi Jianwu says:
Qi is the medicine that adds years to life,
The heart commands the spirit of qi.
Whoever grasps the secret of circulating qi
Is already an immortal.

This verse is concise yet profound, penetrating the mysteries to their subtlest depths. Thus, I carry it upon my person and recite it, naturally arriving at the realm where the autumn moon graces the sky and the void dissolves into nothingness. Only those who are like withered trees or cold springs can comprehend this. Having attained this knowledge, I cannot remain silent.

The Supreme Mysterious Statutes state:
To meet someone and not transmit is to lose the Dao of Heaven;
To transmit to the unworthy is to leak Heaven’s treasure.
Though I have searched to the ends of the earth, I find no one—
I dare not lightly transmit it, lest I incur Heaven’s punishment.

Deeply concerned that the Great Dao may go untransmitted and the cinnabar classics may fade into oblivion, I compose the *Treatise on Revealing the Mysteries of the Mysterious Pass*. This is to enlighten this world, instruct later generations, and preserve the lineage of the golden elixir.

Yet fearing that people may still remain ignorant of this principle, I further explain:
With the eye, see the eye;
With the ear, hear the ear;
With the nose, regulate the nose;
With the mouth, seal the mouth.
Concealment and soaring flight lie within the single heart.

First, one must practice stillness and concentrate the spirit,
Curb anger and restrain desire—
Then water and fire achieve harmony,
And metal and wood unite.
When metal and wood unite,
The true earth returns to its place.
When the true earth returns to its place,
The golden elixir naturally grows as large as a millet grain.
Consuming one pellet daily,
The spirit and qi will once more fill Heaven and Earth.

As Mencius said: *"This is what it means to well nurture my vast and flowing qi."*
Let the seeker reflect upon this.

Respectfully inscribed and bestowed upon Liu Ziyuan.
—The Straightforward Words of Perfected Man Ma Danyang

Sever emotions, eliminate desires, and subdue the heart-mind.
Cease meeting with relatives, and do not let the heart-mind wander.
In walking, standing, sitting, or lying—even in carrying firewood or drawing water, or when relieving oneself—maintain a settled heart-mind, thoughts stilled, serene and unshaken: this is the true heart-mind.
Seek quietude, still the heart-mind, speak little, and keep good company.
Do not generate thoughts, for thoughts are the root of karmic action.
If nothing enters from without and nothing issues from within, and if speech is sparse, the heart-mind will naturally settle and qi harmonize.
If one does not purify the heart-mind and still thoughts, sever desires and cut off emotions, but instead allows external distractions to enter and internal impulses to exit, wandering abroad—how can natural breath-regulation be achieved?
Such a person is but an empty dwelling, and what departs is none other than the monkey and horse.

Since ancient times, all immortals have never dared to transgress the two words: *clarity* and *serenity*.
Moreover, the heart-mind must not chase after external things.
Firmly seize the heart-monkey to ensure the elixir remains without leakage,
Constantly restrain the intent-horse so that inherent nature becomes luminous.

Master Zuo Yuan said:
*"That which moves is the heart-mind; that which arises is thought; that which departs is intent.
When the heart-mind is clear and intent is settled, self and other are both forgotten—serene and still.
Only the single nature responds to phenomena.
All is the heart-mind perceiving things; one must not obscure this single nature.
If one sees only things and not nature, one clings to the margins and cycles through rebirth."*

He also said:
*"Only because one sees things and not nature does one obscure everything.
In walking, standing, sitting, or lying, one must only subdue the heart-mind,
So that the single nature remains ever-present and unobscured."*

To still thoughts is to constantly awaken to the fact that all worldly thoughts are the root of karmic action.
One must purify and still this single nature, illuminating and dissolving the ten thousand conditions—all illusions.
Thoughts should be fine and subtle, so refined that they do not arise.

Someone asked: *"What does it mean to respond to phenomena without obscuration?"*
The answer: *"Though the ears and eyes hear and see, and the mouth speaks, the heart-mind must not cling to them."*

Another asked: *"Where is the unfathomable realm of spirits and gods?"*
The answer: *"It is precisely that state of utter emptiness and stillness."*

Yet another asked about the *"Gate of the Mysterious Female, called the root of Heaven and Earth."*
The answer: *"The Mysterious is the father; the Female is the mother.
Each person possesses eight ounces, which together make one catty.
A single spark of primordial yang qi is the root itself."*

Someone asked about *"returning to life and reverting to the root."*
The answer: *"One must only ensure the heart-mind does not chase after external things, remains unstained and unattached, the heart-mind unaroused, qi undispersed—this is reverting to the root.
If one cannot do this, one does not return to the root."*

Another asked: *"What is seeing nature?"*
The answer: *"It is that state of no heart-mind, no thought, not clinging to a single thing—serene and still, like the moon in the sky."*
