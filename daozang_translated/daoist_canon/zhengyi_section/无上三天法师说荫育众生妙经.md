**The Supreme Three Heavens Master’s Sublime Scripture on Nurturing and Sheltering All Beings**

The Celestial Master proclaimed: Excellent, excellent! I observe the heavens and earth in flux, the sun and moon shifting, the stars losing their courses. The kalpa’s end approaches, hungry ghosts emerge into the world, and myriad calamities arise. From the void, I pity all beings and wish to reveal this scripture. Yet I see the multitudes starving, forced to eat grasses and herbs, many perishing, few surviving. Whether rich or poor, granaries lie empty, silkworms and wheat fail, buckwheat and beans wither. Trees bear no blossoms, blossoms bear no fruit.

Three kinds of ghosts scatter among humankind, devouring people’s grain, reducing them to starvation and death. Poverty ghosts spread every manner of disease to slay mortals:
1. Those who seek passage along roads are murdered.
2. Those who eat kudzu roots die with swollen bellies.
3. Those who consume meat perish from grave illness.
4. Those who travel to and fro cannot give alms.
5. Those whose qi and strength are feeble die.
6. Lands grow unstable; bandits and wars claim lives.
7. Insects and tigers devour people.
8. Those who search for food along roads starve.
9. The emaciated waste away.
10. Those who eat roots find no relief and die.

When the day of disaster and kalpic destiny arrives, wind and frost snap trees, ghostly soldiers appear, and chaos reigns. Ghosts deploy poison to kill, seize people, and ravage the five grains, consuming all sustenance. They relentlessly deplete people’s grain and rice, leaving them to starve. Even the wealthy find no harvest; the dead lie unburied, granaries stand empty. The poor suffer most, eating grasses and herbs until their faces turn sallow and black. Even roots vanish; rice and beans are exhausted. People lose their strength, growing ever thinner, their vitality waning.

Now I proclaim to all under heaven: To escape these calamities, commission *The Sublime Scripture on Nurturing and Sheltering All Beings*. Let every household, young and old, each copy one volume. Perform sacred incantations, hold the Numinous Treasure purification fast, and dispel the poisonous ghosts. Invite the Three Caverns Masters to cultivate roots of goodness, establish fasts, and offer repentance—thus shall all people be saved. If each household devotes one night to this practice, all may commission this scripture, return home to venerate it, and thereby attain health, robust qi, and ample food. Silkworms and fields shall yield double, the five grains ripen, and all endeavors prosper. Those who disbelieve shall fall prey to demonic forces and suffer disaster.

Then the Celestial Master spoke this verse:
*Beings who cultivate no goodness*
*Starve to death, their lives undone.*
*Kudzu roots cannot suffice,*
*Where shall rice and millet come?*
*Seeking brings no gain—*
*Do your hearts not tremble?*
*Seeing bodies endure such torment,*
*How can you fail to act?*
*This year, minor disasters rise;*
*Next year, great trials come.*
*Hungry ghosts roam the world,*
*Devouring all people’s grain.*
*Ghosts send messengers to demand,*
*Feasting full at dawn,*
*Yet by dusk, hunger returns.*
*Voices grow faint, strength fades,*
*Wasting into inhuman forms.*
*To escape disaster,*
*Each household must recite this scripture,*
*Offering three hundred coins,*
*Passing blessings from home to home.*
*Now I speak for your sake—*
*Read and find peace.*
*Rich or poor alike,*
*Let all who hear come and listen.*
*Every living person,*
*Every household, recite this scripture.*
*Summon the Dharma Masters,*
*Let no strife arise among kin.*
*The five grains shall flourish,*
*Ghostly disasters vanish without trace.*
*Those who defy the Heavenly Worthy’s teaching*
*Shall see seven generations languish in darkness.*
*Witnessing their own suffering,*
*How can their works succeed?*
*Trust in heresy, enter hell;*
*Devote yourself to the Dao, attain immortality.*
*Transmit talismans, bestow this scripture,*
*To rescue and protect all beings,*
*Deliver them from the great kalpa of famine,*
*Forever freeing them from hunger’s form.*

The Celestial Master said: Not only households of the Central Lands and border regions must universally perform exorcisms, repent with sincerity, serve their lords with loyalty, and honor parents with filial piety. Refrain from killing and stealing, and amass abundant merit. When rebellious demons arise to deplete the people and harm the five grains, leaving households starving, forced to live on grasses and herbs—such suffering defies description.

Prepare incense, oil, rice, and flour in a pure place, establish a ritual arena, and follow the natural fast to offer repentance. Let each household contribute according to its means, without regard to amount, giving as their hearts dictate. Let the Dharma Masters act in harmony, without contention. Those who disregard the scripture’s intent shall waste incense, oil, and offerings, failing to align with the sages’ will and gaining no merit. Enduring hardship, poverty, and hunger—how does this compare to each cultivating the power of merit?

If the Heavenly Worthy’s scripture comes to your home, receive it with faith, without doubt. If you redeem it with gold and silver, you shall reap gold and silver in return. If with silk and satin, you shall reap silk and satin. If with money and wealth, you shall reap money and wealth. If with base goods, you shall reap base goods.

The Celestial Master said: Good deeds bring good retribution, as virtue shines forth from goodness. Evil causes bear evil fruits, as wickedness entangles those who accumulate it. I observe the beings of the lower realms, who neither revere the true Dao nor worship the Perfected. They toil endlessly for survival, ceaselessly chasing profit and desire. They plant no roots of goodness, yet vie to commit evil. They sacrifice to ghosts and spirits, indulging in heterodox teachings. Though they endure hardship, who among them shall escape unjust death?

In the gengxu year, during the eleventh month, I revealed the *Supreme Numinous Talisman for Nurturing and Protecting the Wondrous Scripture* upon Cloud Terrace Mountain. I entrusted it to the Three Caverns disciples who revere the Dao, that they might widely exhort the world, disseminate it across the land, and urge all people to swiftly cultivate merit and virtue. Delay may leave them unable to escape the nets of flood, fire, pestilence, and plague—when great calamities arise, lives will be lost. Let this be clearly proclaimed and followed.

Wherever there are faithful men and women in prefectures, counties, villages, or hamlets who heed this teaching and encourage others to embrace it, I shall constantly shield and protect them. Their years shall be prolonged, their lives enriched, disasters dispelled, and fortune harmonized. The four paths shall open before them, wealth and treasures shall overflow, and prosperity shall never cease.

In Fengrao Village of Cloud Terrace Mountain Prefecture, there lived a Daoist named Cheng Fadao, who had reached sixty years of age. On the first day of the eleventh month in the gengxu year, at dawn, he went into the mountains to gather medicinal herbs. There, he chanced upon a Perfected One, clad in a five-colored golden robe, a radiant halo crowning his head, attended by immortals on either side, descending upon Cloud Terrace Mountain. Fadao immediately prostrated himself, kowtowing thirty-two times, and beheld the Celestial Master in person.

The Celestial Master spoke to Fadao: "Do not be afraid. I am the Orthodox Celestial Master of the First Heaven, and I have descended personally to dispatch you and transmit my secret words. In the eighth and ninth months, newly emerged ghost masters shall lead countless starving ghosts to roam the world. Some will take the form of rats, entering homes to devour the five grains and gnaw at the foul odors and sounds within. Others will assume human shape, lurking by doorways, watching for food to be prepared, then seizing it to consume. They shall drink the flesh and blood of people, causing them to grow emaciated and weak day by day, their limbs withering, their bodies afflicted with sores and swellings, leading to sudden death or injury by insects and beasts. Unable to bear witness from the heavens, I now entrust this scripture to you, that you may widely disseminate it among the people. Those who heed it shall be spared from calamity, their households secure, their food abundant, their qi robust, and their strength vigorous. In the coming spring, autumn, winter, and summer, their fields and silkworms shall yield double harvests, and their families shall thrive in health and fortune. Let each household establish an altar in their courtyard and perform the rites of the Numinous Treasure Purification Fast for one day and night, following the prescribed methods to avert misfortune. When I hear the sound of bells and chimes, I shall descend and dispatch my attendants, the Perfected Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, bearing the Supreme Numinous Talismans to sever all demonic afflictions and ensure the peace of all people.

If you doubt my secret words, indulge in indolence or anger, and remain ignorant of the causes of sin and fortune, you shall be pitiable indeed. I earnestly admonish you: each must arouse a heart devoted to the Dao, swiftly transcribe this wondrous scripture, and perform the Numinous Treasure Purification Fast. Then shall you dwell in safety. Lest some fail to believe, I reiterate my charge: spread these teachings far and wide, that all people may forever avoid untimely deaths from plague and calamity.

Now I declare to you: upon receiving the talismans, act accordingly. The Supreme Celestial Master’s talismans, inscribed in cinnabar, shall protect the master and disciples, ensuring the well-being of every household, great and small. Their fields and silkworms shall yield double, their five grains ripen, and their six livestock thrive. Demons shall be subdued, and ghosts severed—hasten, as the decree commands!

Thus concludes the *Wondrous Scripture for Nurturing and Protecting All Beings*, spoken by the Supreme Master of the Three Heavens.
