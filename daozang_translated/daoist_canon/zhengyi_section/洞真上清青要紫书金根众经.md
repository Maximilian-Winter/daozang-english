### *The Supreme Cavern-Perfected Azure Essentials and Purple Writ of the Golden Root: A Compendium of Scriptures, Fascicle One*
**Composed by the Most Exalted Azure Youth Lord**

The Azure Essentials Emperor is a disciple of the Primordial Yang Jade Emperor of the Nine Heavens. In the first year of the Central August Era, when the year stood in the Eastern Pivot and the heavens first proclaimed their radiance, he was born in the Jade Realm of the Boundless Heaven upon the Dark Mound, beneath the Seven Jeweled Forest of the Luminous Grove, by the shores of the Nine Domains. His transformation in accordance with the cosmic pattern occurred at dawn on the third day. His surname was Yao, and his personal name was styled Bokai.

Nine dragons flanked his sides, while seven-hued jade phoenixes shaded his form. Divine scales bore sacred mushrooms to nourish him with the dark essence, and celestial maidens exhaled their essence to behold his truth. Jade lads scattered blossoms to dispel impurity, and spirit consorts diffused incense to repel dust. He contained his breath in embryonic respiration.

His dharma was naturally resplendent, his cap adorned with the twelve celestial signs. His face radiated a golden countenance, his body bore numinous talismans, and his speech resonated with golden verses in seventy-two hues, illuminating the Jade Clarity. For three dawns, his splendor shone; the six *qi* aligned in harmony. Dark clouds and purple canopies arose in his chamber, while flying essences and streaming light illumined his courtyard. Abiding in solitary integrity, he nurtured his spirit in the sacred recesses. His bearing followed the cosmic order, rising and falling with the turning of the ages. He dwelled in the realm of luminous rosy clouds and roamed the wastes of the Jade Realm, wielding the strategies of the Primordial August Emperor, descending upon the mounds of the Nine Domains.

Wandering at ease, his gaze flowing freely, he traversed countless kalpas before returning to the cloud chambers of the pure retreat. There, purple clouds formed his dwelling, azure mists his city walls, yellow gold his halls, and white jade his couch. The five *qi* intertwined, high terraces connected by eaves, jade steps adorned with patterns, and phoenix towers opened on four sides. Golden lads attended him, jade maidens held his towels, and celestial immortals—over five thousand in number—arrayed themselves as his celestial guard. Feathered riders thronged like scales, dragons and tigers warded off evil, and pairs of divine beasts crouched in symmetry. The dark *qi* convened in nine assemblies, numinous winds stirred the mist, and fragrant incense ascended to the heavens. The void gave birth to jeweled palaces, and flowing essence radiated jade light, illuminating the Ten Heavens. In lofty seclusion, he alone expounded the sacred texts, consuming essence and swallowing *qi*, chewing upon the dark root. He ingested the returning white jade wine, the golden liquid flowing with essence, while jade forests blossomed. The sun and moon were his imperial springs, refining his bones and transmuting his marrow, his entire being attaining perfection.

At that time, the Primordial Yang Jade Emperor of the Nine Heavens rode a nine-phoenix flying chariot of azure mist, its wheels of jade and canopy of feathers. Accompanied by a thousand perfected ones from the Mulberry Grove and a retinue of ten thousand chariots and a hundred million riders, with thirty-six flying immortals in attendance, he descended to the Azure Court of the Radiant Heavens to visit the Azure Essentials Emperor.

Together, they ascended the capital of the Nine Elders’ Immortal Metropolis and entered the Ninefold Chambers. The Western Terrace’s Tortoise Mother was commanded to open the cloud-phoenix repository and the purple brocade satchel, from which she produced the Purple Writ of the True Oral Instructions and the Jade Fascicle, bestowing them upon the Azure Essentials Emperor.

Having completed his cultivation of the Dao, the Azure Essentials Emperor ascended to the Jade Clarity. The Most High Lord of the Great Dao conferred upon him a flying cloud feathered canopy, the flowing purple phoenix script, the golden true jade light of the Seven Primes’ divine tiger tally, the flowing gold fire bell, the azure essence jade seal, the nine-hued seamless seal, and a feathered skirt of pure azure, enabling him to soar through the Highest Clarity.

Thereupon, he commanded the myriad transformations of light, revolved the five dawns, summoned the moon through the void, and seized the sun to set its wheel in motion. His transformations penetrated the mysteries of separation and union, uniting with the perfected in numinosity. Liberating his form, he traversed countless myriad changes, ascending to the Three Primes to pay homage at the Jade Palace. He roamed the boundless, traversed the Nine Heavens of Yin and Luo, entered and exited the cavern portals, and forged pacts with the jade immortals. Gazing upward, he received the decrees of the Most High Primordial Perfected of the Supreme Origin, aligning with the *qi* and following the mandate. His position governed the imperial dawn, and he oversaw the myriad Dao, none of the immortals being beyond his purview. Below, he oversaw the mountain spirits and river sources of the Ten Heavens, the Five Peaks and Four Seas—none failed to submit to his authority.

Since then, he has soared through the Purple Void, his golden name inscribed in the Azure Palace. The Purple Writ cannot be glimpsed, nor the Golden Root heard.

"Azure Essentials" is an alternate title of the Purple Clarity Emperor. Having received the Purple Writ of the Jade Emperor’s wondrous oral instructions—all essentials of the scriptures—he concealed them above the Nine Heavens, inscribing the hidden texts of the Eight Assemblies.

The Jade Emperor commanded the Most High Attendant Perfected Lord of the Assembly of Immortals to compile and collate the precious catalog, uniting them into a compendium of scriptures. With purple brush, he transcribed the texts, binding them in golden orchid fascicles—all derived from the Dao of the Supreme August and the Primordial Ancient, compiled by the loftiest sages. Gathered into fascicles, they were transmitted to the Azure Essentials Emperor, who passed them to the Supreme Void August Primordial Numinous Lord of the Dao. The Lord of the Dao transmitted them to the High Numinous Cavern Radiance Lord of the Great Simplicity, who passed them to the Supreme August Lord of the Southern Culmen. The Supreme August Lord transmitted them to the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who passed them to the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity. The Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted them to the Posterior Sage Lord of the Nine Mysteries, who finally bestowed them upon the Most Exalted Azure Youth Lord, keeper of the registers in the Jeweled Palace.

Those with predestined affinity who encounter this text have surely been divinely chosen to open the celestial assembly and are destined to receive the immortal registers.

The Jade Emperor treasures and conceals these scriptures, forbidding their transmission to the world. Those who recklessly divulge them shall be denounced by the Nine Heavens as deceivers and reported to the Emperor Lord. The Most High shall dispatch the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors to punish their bodies, condemning them to death as lowly ghosts, filling the river sources. Their seven generations of ancestors shall suffer torment in the Water Bureau. Scholars must heed the regulations and guard these secrets with reverence.

If one possesses a golden skeleton and jade bones, their name inscribed in the imperial records, and gains access to this text, they must follow the mysterious regulations of the Nine Perfected, cultivate the dharma disciplines, and present offerings in accordance with the covenants: one golden dragon and one jade fish as tokens, a hundred feet of purple silk, and forty feet of azure damask. They shall seek out a master of the scriptures to receive transmission.

Master and disciple shall perform a seven-hundred-day retreat in mutual purification. According to the regulations, only after seven hundred years may one be deemed worthy of receiving the three transmissions. Those who fail to adhere to the scriptural precepts and lightly divulge the secret fascicles shall be consigned to the Bureau of Ghosts upon death, their seven generations of ancestors held accountable, and they shall never attain immortality.

Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfection must recite the *Yellow Court Jade Radiance* ten thousand times as the foundation, penetrate the Three Palaces, and open the obscure barriers—only then may they practice the methods of the *Purple Script Jade Formulas* and summon the true and invoke the numinous, ascending to the Mystery in broad daylight. The *Purple Script Formula* states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfection must practice the *Shangqing Jade Rosy Clouds Purple Illumination Inner Vision* method.

Regularly on the first day of the upper decade of one’s birth, bathe and purify oneself in fasting, don immaculate ritual robes, and at dawn enter the chamber. Use the inner vision to illuminate the jade talisman, wash the eyes with limpid radiant water facing east, and rinse the mouth and cleanse the abdomen, ensuring inner and outer purity—no lingering tastes in the mouth, no residual warmth in the abdomen, no extraneous sights in the eyes, no dust on the body. In profound stillness, one’s being becomes the Dao alone.

Then turn to face south, sit upright, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize purple qi emerging above the crown of the head, surging vigorously toward the heavens, crowning one’s form with a canopy of qi, shrouding both inner and outer in mist. Draw in the purple qi, swallow it thirty-nine times, and as warmth arises, follow the swallowing into the mouth and abdomen. Upon completion, open the eyes to a sudden clarity, then knock the teeth three times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Shangqing streaming rosy clouds, dawn of true auspiciousness,
Purple clouds illumine the numinous, yang accumulates in radiant exchange,
Flowing inward through the Golden Gate, the Jade Portal receives the vision,
Treasure spirits harmonize within, hun and po remain undispersed,
Luminous Sovereign of the Nine Perfected, the Eight Dao flow in abundance,
Grasping clouds to summon the void, the numinous descends from the Purple Han,
Penetrating the obscure origin, the Three Mornings feast as one,
Roaming and ascending the Jade Hall, paying homage at the Emperor’s abode."*

After reciting, swallow three times to conclude.

For the *Inner Vision Illuminating Jade Talisman*, write in vermilion on white paper, cast it into water, face east, knock the teeth three times, and recite the incantation:

*"The heavens bear no flying obscurities, the earth bears no drifting dust,
The jade talisman dispels filth, washing away the inauthentic,
Penetrating the mysterious void, summoning the numinous immortals."*

Upon completion, use the water to wash the eyes and rinse the mouth, purifying both inner and outer. Discard the remaining talisman water into the eastward flow.

The *Purple Script Formula* derives from the middle fascicle of the *Shangqing Jade Rosy Clouds Purple Illumination Inner Vision Scripture*. After eight years of practice, purple clouds will cover one’s body, the eyes will see with penetrating clarity, the Nine Heavens will be perceived in full, the body will emit wondrous light, and one will traverse myriad transformations, soaring through the Great Void. This Dao is most wondrous, transmitted only to those who have attained Perfection and not disseminated in the world.

Those whose names are inscribed in the *Mysterious Chart of Golden Characters* with green script from the Eastern Florescence, having obtained this text, must guard and practice it in secret. The true and numinous will readily respond, the summoning of immortals will easily succeed, the Dao will be complete, and qi will be abundant—ascending in broad daylight. Beware of careless transmission, lest the numinous fascicles be divulged.

The "first day of the upper decade of one’s birth" refers to those born in the *jiazi* decade, who should take the *jiayin* day as the first day of the upper decade; others follow accordingly.

The *Purple Script Formula* states: To practice the *Shangqing Jade Rosy Clouds Purple Illumination Inner Vision* Dao, regularly on the first day of the lunar month, take three *sheng* of westward-flowing water, place it in a golden vessel (a bronze vessel is also suitable), and add one *liang* of true cinnabar into the water, calling it the *Golden Essence Stone Radiance Water Mother Jade Embryo Essence*. Expose it in the central courtyard.

On the fifteenth day of the month at noon, let the essence of the sun’s light mystically illumine the *Stone Radiance Water Mother*, so that the sun’s image shines brilliantly within the water mother. Facing east, write the *Streaming Rosy Clouds Illuminating Penetrating Vision Jade Talisman* and cast it into the *Stone Radiance Water Mother*. Turn to face south, knock the teeth sixteen times, and recite aloud:

*"Solar soul, Pearl Radiance, Embryo Veil, Green Illumination, Rosy Clouds, Crimson Youth, Mystic Blazing Whirlwind Image."*

After reciting these sixteen characters, close the eyes and visualize five-colored streaming rosy clouds descending from the sun to crown one’s body, illuminating the entire form. Envision a celestial being within the sun, eight *cun* in height, wearing a vermilion yang-red crown, clad in crimson brocade and cinnabar skirts, standing above the crown of one’s head. The being draws the sun’s red cinnabar golden essence and *Stone Radiance Water Mother* radiance, pouring it over one’s form, then approaches the vessel containing the water essence and sunlight. Softly recite the incantation:

*"Radiant net of cinnabar yang, primordial radiance unfurled,
Crimson furnace of great brightness, the Nine Qi harmonize as one,
Three and Five refine the essence, the Two Images intertwine,
Jade embryo, stone marrow, refining the old to return to the new,
Streaming rosy clouds mystically infuse, the Water Mother congeals the spirit,
Harmonizing the hun, softening the po, inner and outer merge as mist,
Gaze upward to consume cinnabar blossoms, sip the sun’s root,
Spiritual mushrooms overflow, the face emits golden immortality,
One’s body merges with qi, one’s existence merges with the sun,
Riding the radiance to soar through space, ascending to the Emperor’s Morn."*

Upon completion, face the sun and swallow sixteen times. Take the *Stone Radiance Water Mother Essence*, face the sun to wash the eyes and bathe the body, then discard the remaining water into the westward flow.

After nine years of practice, the face will bear a golden countenance, inner and outer will be thoroughly illuminated, one’s radiance will match the sun’s, and one will soar through the mysterious void, ascending to the Gate of the Sun. This Dao is lofty and wondrous, not transmitted to the lower world. Those who lightly divulge its treasured text will be punished by ghostly soldiers, their bodies consigned to the Bureau of Ghosts upon death, and their seven generations of ancestors will suffer calamity.

For the *Streaming Rosy Clouds Illuminating Penetrating Vision Jade Talisman*, face east, write in vermilion on white paper, knock the teeth twelve times, and recite the incantation:

*"The Nine Paths of the Great Yang, the Eight Perfected shine as one,
Three and Five revolve and transform, merging with the cinnabar numen,
Stone Radiance Jade Embryo, essence of vermilion cinnabar,
Gather and absorb the flying mystery, descend to my form,
Ever united with the Three Mornings, sharing life and death together."*

Upon completion, cast the talisman into the *Stone Radiance Water Mother*.

The above is the *Shangqing Jade Rosy Clouds Purple Illumination Inner Vision* method, also called the *Golden Essence Stone Radiance Water Mother Jade Embryo Scripture* or the *Method of Gathering and Ingesting the Sun’s Root to Summon Rosy Clouds*. The Lord Emperor treasures and guards it in secret, inscribing the text in purple ink on purple-gold slips, sealing it within the chambers of the Nine Elders of the Supreme Immortal Capital, in the Jade Palace of the Jeweled Abode. According to the regulations, it emerges once every seven hundred years. Those whose names are inscribed in the *Mysterious Chart of Golden Characters* with green script from the *Shangqing* tradition, having obtained this text, will be attended by twelve *Taiyang* Golden Lads sent by the Emperor. After nine years of practice, they will attain transcendence, ascending to heaven in broad daylight to roam the Jade Palace of the Dark Mystery.

The Purple Writ’s Oral Instructions state: To cultivate the *Shangqing* Way of the Jade Radiance and Purple Reflection Inner Vision—the method of ascending to the Dark Mystery by daylight—one should, on the third day of the waxing moon, gather three *sheng* of the essence of the Eastern Well’s imperial blossom, which is the well’s first-drawn water. Store it in a golden vessel (a bronze vessel is also excellent) and expose it in the central courtyard. By the night of the sixteenth day of the moon, at midnight, let the moon’s essence and dark radiance reflect upon the imperial blossom’s cinnabar brilliance within the vessel. Face east, inscribe the *Yellow Qi* Yang Essence *Dongming* Numinous Talisman, and cast it into the imperial blossom vessel. Turn to the west, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and intone aloud:

*"Lunar orb, warm and fragrant, misty and graceful, empty and numinous, orchid-lush and blossom-twined, still as gold, pure as camp, fiery as the Terrace of Countenance’s standard."*

These are twenty-four characters in all. Upon completion, close the eyes and visualize the moon’s five-colored flowing essence and purple light descending to crown the body, enveloping it entirely. Within the moon, envision a perfected being, nine *cun* in height, wearing a purple coronet, clad in a yellow brocade flying skirt, standing above one’s head. This being draws the imperial blossom from the moon and pours it over the body. Then, facing the imperial blossom vessel and reflecting the moonlight, softly recite the incantation:

*"Numinous unfolding, radiant blossom,
Three and Five interpenetrate the pure,
Purple and yellow intertwine and descend,
Dual qi merge as one,
Celestial origin divides and unites,
Revolving through waxing and waning,
Imperial mushroom overflows,
Yellow embryo crystallizes essence,
Perfected within the radiance,
Mold and bathe my form,
Moon Sovereign and Lady,
Secure my yellow tranquility,
Jade pendants and golden bells,
Render me utterly luminous,
Wane with the moon,
Wax with the moon,
Ever feast on imperial blossoms,
Ascend to the Emperor’s court,
Float through the great void,
Pilot the flying wheel,
Supreme offering without end,
Eons of longevity."*

Upon completion, face the moon and swallow twenty-four times. Then, take the imperial blossom and, facing the moon, wash the eyes and bathe the entire body. Finally, release any remaining water into an eastward-flowing stream.

Practicing this for nine years, the eyes will perceive the empty and boundless, seeing clearly for ten thousand *li*, discerning fortune and misfortune in reverse. The countenance will be refined, the body transformed, the face suffused with jade essence, the form emanating purple light. One will ride the void, soar through the heavens, and ascend to the *Shangqing* realm.

This Way is lofty and wondrous, not to be transmitted to the lower world. Those who recklessly divulge its sacred writ will be punished by divine soldiers, their bodies consigned to the dark springs, their misfortune flowing through ten thousand generations, forever bound to the offices of ghosts.

This *Yellow Qi* Yang Essence *Dongming* Numinous Talisman is inscribed facing east, with a yellow brush on blue-green paper. Knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

*"Yang conceals, Yin arises,
Dual qi circulate and converge,
Celestial origin blends and unites,
Three and Five respond to the tally,
Ingest and command imperial blossoms,
Numinous descent into my frame,
Ever partake of radiant qi,
Abide with the spirits in repose,
Transcend the Nine Mysteries,
Join the flying chariot’s ascent."*

Upon completion, cast the talisman into the imperial blossom vessel.

This *Shangqing* method of the Jade Radiance and Purple Reflection Inner Vision is also called the *Scripture of Concealing Heaven and Hiding the Moon’s Jade Embryo* or the *Eight Simplicities Perfected Scripture of Ingesting the Moon’s Imperial Blossom*. The Lord Emperor treasures and guards it in secret, inscribing the text in purple ink on purple-gold slips, sealing it within the chambers of the Nine Elders of the Supreme Immortal Capital, in the Jade Palace of the Jeweled Abode. According to the regulations, it emerges once every seven hundred years. Those whose names are inscribed in the *Mysterious Chart of Golden Characters* with green script from the *Shangqing* tradition, having obtained this text, will be attended by twelve *Xihua* Jade Maidens sent by the Emperor. After nine years of practice, they will attain transcendence, ascending to heaven in broad daylight to roam the Emperor’s chambers.

In practicing this Way, for three days prior, one must bathe with orchid fragrance, maintain a pure fast in a separate chamber, avoid worldly affairs, and meditate upon the perfected and numinous. Facing the dawn’s radiance, proceed as if gazing upon the Emperor’s visage, accumulating resonance until the appointed day of transformation into an immortal. If the sky is overcast, one may also perform the practice indoors through visualization, for the Way lies in concentrated thought, and resonance will thus be achieved.

The Purple Writ’s Oral Instructions state: To cultivate the Way of the Supreme Perfected, one should practice on the third, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the third, ninth, and twelfth lunar months—three months a year, three times each month. These months are when the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens undergoes transformation, and these days are when he roams and feasts in the upper palaces of the Nine Heavens, aligning with the celestial tally.

On these days, bathe and fast in seclusion, avoiding worldly affairs. Face the northeast and visualize the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens: his name, his height of nine *cun* and nine *fen*, his sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk, his head adorned with a vermilion jade cap of seven measures, and the *Wuji* Advancing Worthies’ coronet. He resides above the Nine Heavens, in the Jade Treasure Palace of the Supreme Ultimate’s Jeweled Abode, within the Cinnabar Numinous Village and Cavern Origin Hamlet. At times, he rides a flying chariot of azure radiance, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, with cranes flanking the wheels, roaming above the empty and mysterious.

Visualize him clearly, as if facing his countenance. Then, bow nine times to the Primordial Father and silently invoke him three times, saying: *"I, so-and-so, have a request: grant me ascent to serve the Emperor’s numen."* Knock the teeth nine times and intone the incantation:

*"Supreme Lord Emperor,
Primordial Great Spirit,
Conjoined with the true qi of lineage,
Form resplendent in the purple heavens,
Riding clouds and driving the floating,
Trailing radiance through the eight mists,
Turning the wheel in graceful descent,
Sheltering my body with the Way,
Grant me to ride the dawn’s radiance,
To serve the numinous axle.
Today at the Eight Assemblies,
I humbly present my supreme wish:
All I seek and petition,
May it be as spoken,
Ever partake of primal auspiciousness,
Abide with the Emperor in eternity."*

Upon completion, face upward and swallow nine times.

If the Primordial Father is moved and the Emperor pleased, they will command the recording of one’s name in the golden register of immortals. After nine years of concentrated practice, a jade chariot will be dispatched to welcome the body, ascending in broad daylight to the Emperor’s dawn.

This Way is lofty and wondrous, not to be shared with the lower world’s ordinary learners. Without one’s name inscribed in the *Mysterious Chart of Golden Characters* with green script from the *Shangqing* tradition, none may know or see it. If, by chance, one encounters this sacred text, it is because one is destined for transcendence. One should treasure and secretly practice it.

To speak lightly of this is not true devotion—such transgression extends to seven generations of one’s ancestors, condemning them to eternal imprisonment in hell, never to be absolved. The body perishes under the jurisdiction of demonic officials, and transcendence becomes forever unattainable.

The *Purple Script Formula* states: For those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, the months of the second, seventh, and tenth lunar months—specifically the fifth, sixteenth, and twenty-ninth days of each—are appointed times. These three months in a year, with three days in each, mark the months when the Primordial Mother of the Nine Heavens begins her transformative generation, and the days when the Celestial Origin converges in celebration, shifting the feminine virtue of heaven.

On these days, one must bathe in purity, fast in seclusion, and withdraw from worldly affairs. At midnight, step into the central courtyard under the open sky, face the southwest, and with upturned gaze, meditate upon the name of the Primordial Mother of the Nine Heavens. Envision her as six inches and six parts in height, clad in a luminous divine robe of emerald brocade and nine-colored frost-silk sashes. She wears a crown of purple and primordial yellow, abides above the boundless qi of the Nine Heavens, within the Sevenfold Radiance Palace of the Jasper Forest, the Jade Treasure Cavern of the Primordial, and the Upper Clarity Precinct of the Ninefold Radiance Realm. At that moment, she rides a purple cloud beneath a canopy of flying essence-feathers, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, with phoenix-attendants and immortal escorts, roaming above the Great Clarity and within the boundless expanse.

Visualize her with utmost clarity, as if she stands vividly before you. Then prostrate nine times before the Primordial Mother, and thrice invoke her in silent reverence, confessing: "Impure and defiled, my base form yearns for the true. I aspire to Upper Clarity, beseeching your gaze and reception, that I may serve the Jade Spirit." Strike the teeth nine times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Three unite, five disperse,
Dual origins merge and transform.
Qi congeals into spirit,
Spirit transmutes and unites with the soul.
Nurtured in the womb of the Nine Heavens,
Guard the gate of life.
Yin essence descends in mystery,
Purifying the source of form.
Refine the substance, infuse with qi,
Receive transformation by nature.
What day is this?
The Primordial Mother reveals herself.
Eight vows, nine assemblies,
Attain the Celestial Perfected above.
Resonance responds to the subtle,
Gaining audience with the Jade Dawn.
Bones ascend, flesh takes flight,
Riding the void, threading the mist,
Ascending to the Purple Chariot,
To eternally assist the Emperor’s ministers."*

Upon completion, swallow nine times and cease.

If the Primordial Mother is pleased and the Empress delighted, the Celestial Perfected will descend, allowing one to behold her divine countenance. She will then command the Azure Palace to inscribe one’s name in the jade register. After nine years of concentrated practice, the Emperor will dispatch jade maidens riding clouds to welcome the practitioner, ascending to the Jade Clarity to serve in the Mysterious Palace.

This Dao is lofty and wondrous, unknown to the world. Only those whose names are inscribed in the imperial records of the Golden Register may encounter this text—all such individuals are destined for transcendence, fated to ascend and roam the Nine Heavens in celestial feasts. Guard this secret closely; to reveal it lightly is to invite the Three Officials to seize one’s body, subjecting seven generations of ancestors to torment in the Yellow Springs. Never speak of it carelessly.

All who practice this Dao must cultivate with utmost sincerity, gazing upward to behold the divine countenance and yearning for the descent of the mysterious. Only thus may one attain flight as an immortal. Avoid defilement, lest one offend the Supreme Perfected and incur divine prohibition, forever barred from transcendence.

If the sky is overcast and the sun obscured, the practice may be conducted in a quiet chamber. As long as heart and eyes align, voice and resonance harmonize, no spirit will remain unmoved, no Dao will fail to descend, no learning will go unfulfilled. When the Dao descends and the spirit attaches, one may soar through the vastness of the heavens.

The *Purple Script Formula* further states: For those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, the ninth day of the ninth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the third day of the third month are appointed times—days when the Perfected Ladies of the Nine Heavens celebrate the Jade Peace, roaming and feasting in the celestial courts, unfolding and receiving the numinous.

On these days, bathe with five fragrances, fast in seclusion, and withdraw from worldly affairs. At midnight, step into the open, burn incense, face north, and with upturned gaze, meditate upon the name of the Perfected Lady of the Nine Heavens. Envision her as seven inches and seven parts in height, clad in a seven-colored radiant cloud-gauze and a luminous nine-colored purple brocade flying skirt. She wears a crown of primordial yellow with seven tiers, the *Advancing Worthiness* diadem, and resides in the Supreme Purple Jasper Palace, the Jade Radiance Terrace of the Sevenfold Radiance Precinct, and the Golden Radiance Realm of the Non-Action Precinct.

At that moment, she rides a purple mist beneath a flying canopy of green and a vermilion chariot, accompanied by thirty-six jade maidens of the Upper Palace, each holding divine mushrooms and five-colored banners, escorting flying phoenixes and white simurghs, roaming above the Nine Mysteries and the edge of the Azure Heavens.

Once the visualization is complete, bow four times in reverence to the Perfected Lady, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"The Celestial Perfected returns in celebration,
Roaming and feasting in the Purple Heavens.
Unfolding and receiving the numinous,
Harmonizing movement without pause.
Above, ascending to the Jade Palace;
Below, gazing upon your servant.
Eight assemblies open,
Nine vows intertwine.
Subtle thoughts establish resonance,
Above, the divine spirits are moved.
Flowing essence refines and pours,
Jade splendor descends upon the body.
Boundless blessings,
Eternally cultivating the field of mushrooms."*

Upon completion, swallow twenty-four times and cease.

If the Perfected Lady is moved and the Divine Consort delighted, they will report to the Jade Emperor, presenting one’s jade name for inscription in the Eastern Florescence and inclusion in the jade records of the Jade Clarity. After nine years of cultivation, one’s face will radiate golden countenance, the body will shimmer with jade light, the Divine Consort will commune, and the spirit will stand before the Perfected. One will then ascend in a flying canopy to roam and feast in the Purple Courts.

This method is lofty and wondrous, unknown to the world. Only those whose names are inscribed in the purple records of the imperial register may encounter this secret text—such individuals are destined for transcendence. Treasure and practice it in secrecy, and one may attain immortality in due time. To reveal it lightly is to invite divine punishment, eternal servitude in the dark springs, and suffering for seven generations of ancestors, never to be absolved.

The *Purple Script Formula* further states: For the Dao of the *Sun’s Radiance within the Mysterious*, one should choose the days of *bing-wu* and *geng-wu*, at noon. Place a nine-inch bright mirror in the central courtyard under the open sky, allowing the sunlight to reflect within it. Face south toward the mirror, strike the teeth twenty-four times, and recite the incantation:

*"Sun’s essence, radiant net,
Flowing light illumines the numinous.
Eightfold brilliance, celestial weft,
Traversing the heavens in due course.
Jade embryo fills,
Mysterious light child,
Sun’s radiance, red essence,
Returns the true, curves the reflection.
At noon’s stillness, all is luminous.
Golden mirror gathers mist,
Merging with my form.
Dual luminaries align,
Joining the sun as one.
Eighty-one breaths,
Stomach blooms with splendor.
Eternally preserve sun and moon,
Heaven and earth incline in harmony."*

Look up to the heavens and draw the sunlight into the mouth, inhaling and swallowing thirty-six breaths. When finished, return to face the mirror once more, then inhale and swallow the sun’s essence within the mirror forty-five times. Together, these make eighty-one breaths. This is the Dao of the Mysterious Within the Sun’s Radiance. Practicing it for three years, the pupil of the eye will emit flowing purple jade light, seeing clearly for ten thousand miles and perceiving all without limit. The face will glow like red cinnabar, the body will radiate a golden countenance, and when walking, one’s shadow will follow as if flying through the void. This is the supreme method of the Jade Emperor, transmitted to the Woman of Lu, who refined the essence to ascend to the Jade Court. This method is a precious secret; it must not be carelessly transmitted. If transmitted to the unworthy, calamity will extend to the seven generations of ancestors, and the body will be consigned to serve as a lowly ghost, never attaining immortality.

When cultivating the Dao of the Mysterious Within the Sun’s Radiance, if the sky is overcast and the sun is not visible, one may practice indoors, but the breaths swallowed should be doubled to one hundred sixty-two. The mirror must always be kept bright and free of dust or grime. It must not be carelessly allowed for others to gaze into, for this is a grave taboo. If three people have gazed into it, the Sun’s Radiance Child and the Red Essence Two Lords will descend in clouds, causing one to lose sight and spirit—beware of this.

This method was regularly practiced by the Queen Mother of the West, who transmitted it to the Azure Essentials Emperor Lord. The Azure Essentials Emperor Lord passed it to the Woman of Lu, and the Woman of Lu transmitted it to the Sun Woman. The Sun Woman constantly practiced it in the world, perceiving the mysterious void with clarity, her face radiating golden light. Though she lived for seven hundred years, in the era of harmonious balance, people thought her no older than seventeen or eighteen. She often rode a flying phoenix, traveling throughout the world, overseeing those of the Dao. Sometimes she descended with true qi to those with predestined affinity, or encountered them in visions to awaken them, allowing them to receive her true form and thus gain the ability to fly.

The Purple Book’s Oral Instructions state: On the days of conjunction at the new moon, when the qi of Heaven and Earth intermingle and the cycle completes, yin qi surges while yang essence wanes. At that hour, the heavens dispatch their forces, the ten thousand perfected descend to their thrones, the five stars shift their courses, and the ten heavens resonate as one. On such a day, when practicing the Dao of the Mysterious Within the Sun’s Radiance, one should go out into the central courtyard, face the sun with a bright mirror, and hold a great blade. Facing south, strike the teeth thirty-six times and recite the incantation while looking up:

*"Sun Radiance Child, yang light and red essence,
Radiant Net Perfected, jade spirit within the reflection,
Traversing the course borne by qi,
Above and below, all is solemn and clear.
Yin’s encroaching schemes
Invade the sun’s court.
Heaven dispatches its arms,
Imperial ministers lead the troops.
The Three and Five stand in rectitude,
Yang’s light shines through.
Heaven and Earth alternate in sustenance—
What merchant dares arise?
Return each to its place,
Let none diminish or overflow.
The Jade Emperor’s decree commands,
None dare disobey."*

When finished, inhale qi twenty-four times and stop. Thus, Heaven and Earth return to their positions, the Three and Five align in brilliance, the Child is moved to joy, the sun’s radiance returns its spirit, and flowing light mysteriously pours down, refining and descending into one’s body. One’s name will then be inscribed on the purple tablets and recorded in the Jade Clarity Register. Within nine years, one will ride a green chariot, soaring through the void to ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Purple Book’s Oral Instructions state: On the day of a lunar eclipse, when yin qi wanes and yang qi waxes, the degrees of their courses intersect, and the two luminaries contend. This is when Heaven and Earth experience the separation and union of the sun and moon’s distinct qi. On the evening of a lunar eclipse, when the proper qi is encroached upon, the Five Stars, the Morning Department of the Imperial Bureaus, and the commands of the Great Yin marshal their forces to guard the spirit. On such an evening, go out into the central courtyard with a vat of clear water. Hold a blade, face the moon over the water, and strike the teeth sixteen times while reciting the incantation:

*"Heaven and Earth separate and unite,
Bearing qi, they exploit the waning.
Encroaching upon the moon’s abode,
They offend the yellow radiance.
Imperial ministers wield their staves,
The Jade Morning captures the transgressors.
Heavenly soldiers encircle the domain,
Divine lords unleash their might.
What merchant dares arise,
Riding shadows, exploiting the faint?
Swiftly return to your original place,
Let nothing transgress."*

Recite this three times while facing the moon, then stir the water in the vat three times with the blade in the right hand. Face the water and inhale, swallowing qi sixteen times. When finished, the lunar eclipse will dissolve, the celestial scene will be solemn and clear, the Three and Five will align in splendor, and the ten thousand palaces will be at peace. The Lady of the Moon’s True Person, her spirit radiant, will be moved to joy, returning her spirit’s mysterious reflection and descending her favor upon you. She will then report to the Northern Emperor, erasing your name from the register of the dead and inscribing it in the Jade Register of the Upper Clarity Palace. She will assign you twelve jade maidens to attend and guard your body. Practicing this for nine years, you will ride flying rosy clouds to ascend to the Moon Court. This method is most wondrous and not practiced in the world; those who receive it must treasure and keep it secret, never transmitting it lightly.

The Purple Book’s supreme method was practiced by the Emperor Lord, transmitted to Wang Lingzi, whose neck constantly emitted purple light, illuminating ten miles around. His eyes shone with flowing essence like stars, his face radiated a golden countenance, and at night, his empty brightness blazed. He commanded the Twelve Golden Lads of the Great Yang and the Twelve Jade Maidens of the Great Yin. This method is most secret and must not be lightly transmitted.

If the sky is overcast and the sun or moon is not visible, one may practice indoors, for even then, the hidden forces conspire to encroach—one cannot fail to rescue the proper luminaries.

The Purple Book’s Oral Instructions state: For those cultivating the Dao of the Upper Clarity who have not yet ascended to the Cloudy Court or soared in the Purple Void, even if one’s aspirations are set upon secluded mountains, maintaining long fasts in remote forests, one may still not escape the calamities of the *yang-nine* or the years of *cheng-tang*. The Precious True Jade Talisman for Deliverance from Calamity, bestowed by the Primordial Heavenly King, can guard against and traverse these disasters. This talisman existed with the Nine Heavens at the dawn of creation, enduring with the sun and moon. It passes through vast floods without sinking, treads through raging fires without burning, withstands sharp blades without injury, and grants longevity for ten thousand years before one’s life naturally ends. Wearing it for nine years, one’s form will transform, the body will generate wondrous light, and one will ride the void to ascend to the Jade Clarity.

According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, once every seven hundred years, those with golden names and jade characters inscribed on purple slips within the Azure Palace may transmit this teaching to three persons. If lightly divulged or falsely imparted, the body shall descend to the offices of ghosts, the seven ancestors shall be tortured and bound, eternally confined to the Dark Springs, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas.

**Great Kalpa Deliverance-from-Calamity Talisman for Longevity**
This is the third of the Primordial Nine Mysteries Talismans of the Original Beginning. When the Grand Solar Conjunction occurs and floodwaters surge to the heavens, inscribe it in azure on white silk and wear it upon the head. One shall float upon the clear waves, untouched by the myriad disasters, preserving the body and prolonging life. With long wearing, one becomes an immortal.

**Lesser Kalpa Deliverance-from-Calamity Talisman for Longevity**
This is the Supreme Perfected Talisman of the Nine Heavens. When the Lesser Yang-Nine cycle arrives, with water and fire crossing in chaos and the myriad disasters arising together, inscribe it in vermilion on white silk and wear it upon the left elbow. One shall enter the depths without sinking, enter fire without burning, and remain unharmed by the myriad disasters. Preserving the body and prolonging life, one’s lifespan shall equal that of heaven. With long wearing, one becomes an immortal.

**Great Hundred-Six Deliverance-from-Calamity Talisman for Longevity**
This is the Jade Talisman of the Supreme August Jade Heaven. When the Great Hundred-Six Calamity arrives, inscribe it in vermilion on white silk and wear it upon the head. Flowing disasters and violent calamities shall not harm one, preserving the body and prolonging life. One’s lifespan shall equal that of the Three Luminaries. Wearing it for nine years, one shall ascend as an immortal in broad daylight to the Grand Clarity.

**Lesser Hundred-Six Deliverance-from-Calamity Talisman for Longevity**
This is the Supreme Purple Void Jade Talisman. When the Lesser Hundred-Six Calamity arrives, inscribe it in yellow on white silk and wear it upon the left elbow. The thousand demons and myriad spirits, pestilences and epidemics flowing wildly, shall not harm one. Preserving the body and prolonging life, one’s lifespan shall equal that of heaven and earth. Wearing it for nine years, one shall ascend in broad daylight.

**Yin-Yang Deliverance-from-Calamity Talisman for Longevity**
This is the Jade Talisman of the Three Heavenly Lads. When heaven and earth undergo transformation, with the myriad epidemics crossing in chaos, water, fire, weapons, and illnesses—all thousand disasters—arising together, inscribe it in black on white silk and wear it. One’s lifespan shall equal that of heaven, one’s radiance that of the sun and moon. After nine years, one shall fly and ascend to the Grand Clarity.

The above *Deliverance-from-Calamity Talismans for Longevity* were transmitted by the Primordial Heavenly King to Ninefold Perfection. Ninefold Perfection is none other than the Nine Heavens Venerable, whose body stands nine feet tall, with round eyes and a square mouth, a voice like thunder, and a purple radiance crowning his head, illuminating the Ten Heavens and penetrating the Grand Void. Twenty-four maidens attend him on either side, clad in nine-colored patterned furs, wearing crowns of purple dawn, seated upon the Purple Void amidst the Empty Mystery. At times, he rides a flying phoenix and a dark dragon, roaming above the White Water Sandbar and the Empty Mountains.

Since receiving these talismans, Ninefold Perfection has passed through over seven thousand kalpas, repeatedly traversing the Yang surges and Yin obstructions, the cycles of the Hundred-Six. He soars above the vast waves without fear of calamitous encounters. He summons the Water Mother to fill the sources, commands the Nine Rivers to halt their flow, orders the officials of the underworld to welcome him, and employs the Six Dings to assist him. He subdues the Five Peaks to serve as dark beams, guides the feathered riders to sail the boat, and roams carefree through the Clear Void, indulging in boundless wandering. He receives the celestial reckoning and transmits the method to worthy successors.

If one’s name is recorded in the imperial registers with green characters in the Supreme Clarity, one may obtain this text. Those who obtain it shall rank with the numinous immortals, transcend the Hundred-Six, ascend in broad daylight to the morning court, and be granted twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens by the Emperor to attend their person. This must be treasured and kept secret; do not lightly transmit it.

When receiving the talisman, master and disciple shall face each other in a nine-day fast, or three days, and present one foot of white silk and thirty-two feet of purple silk as a pledge of trust before the Nine Heavens. On an auspicious day at midnight, expose the offerings in the central courtyard, facing north. Prepare one *sheng* of clear wine, one piece of dried meat, fifty dates, and one nine-layered cloth. Place the talisman upon the altar. The master shall strike his teeth twenty-four times and reverently invoke the Messengers of the Nine Heavens and the Inspector of Perfected Ones: "Now there is a perfected man or woman, so-and-so, who delights in the Way of immortals. Born in this declining age, with the myriad disasters flowing, they humbly receive this supreme talisman to deliver and preserve their life. After wearing it, they shall commune with the Perfected, avoid encountering calamities, become a Supreme Perfected, ride the void, and soar to the Grand Clarity." Upon transmitting the talisman to the disciple, the rite is complete. The remaining offerings may be dispersed as one wishes.

The *Purple Writ Formula* states: For those cultivating the Supreme Clarity Dao, if the disciple’s parents, uncles, brothers, or other relatives die in the world while the disciple has not yet severed their traces and remains among people, their body shall tread upon the impurities of death. On the third day, take one jar of clear water and one *liang* of true cinnabar, cast them into the water, and stand in the courtyard facing south. Strike the teeth nine times before the water and recite the incantation: "Qi transforms into spirit, the corpse changes to enter the Mystery. Three transformations and five refinements ascend into the kalpas of the Nine Heavens. The body is delivered anew, the body transforms anew, becoming a Perfected One." When finished, if the deceased is male, summon three jade lads; if female, summon seven jade maidens. Pour the consecrated water over the corpse of the deceased. When done, take the water to wash one’s hands and face, look up to the heavens and spit, then silently recite: "The heavenly qi is now clear, the human transformation is now complete. Born anew in the heavens above, undergoing nine transformations to receive form. The Five Sufferings and Three Paths sever the name of death. Deliver the destitute souls, return them to the Southern Court." Cease.

Thus, the deceased shall be reborn and transformed in the heavens above. After nine years, they shall ascend to the Jade Clarity Palace. This method surpasses the Great Cavern’s method for delivering the seven ancestors. It is a secret of the Jade Emperor, not to be transmitted to unworthy persons. Only those with golden names and imperial registers, green characters and purple texts, may behold this text. If one has not yet practiced it and lightly reveals it to others, their seven generations of ancestors shall be eternally confined to the offices of ghosts, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments for ten thousand kalpas without release. According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, only after seven hundred years may a Perfected One transmit it.

The *Purple Writ Formula* states: For those studying the Supreme Dao who travel the world’s paths and suddenly encounter a corpse along the way, with its impure qi assailing their body, the disciple shall take twenty-four steps and stop, face due north, and strike their teeth nine times.

When encountering a male corpse, visualize three Jade Lads; for a female corpse, visualize seven Jade Maidens. They come to invite the disciple into the Jade Valley, where they pour white fungus and pure water over the corpse. In an instant, imagine the corpse reviving and becoming human once more. Then recite the yin incantation:

"Withered, revive in glory;
Extinguished, live again.
Attaining life in Heaven above,
Receiving once more the Supreme Numinous.
Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens,
Reversing the cycles of womb and infancy,
Accumulating and dissolving away,
The white corpse returns to life."

After reciting, wipe the eyes fourteen times. Thus, the impure qi is immediately dispelled, the dead person is transformed anew, and later becomes a spirit-person.

If the disciple encounters this twenty-four times and practices this refining incantation, merit is fulfilled and virtue is augmented. Their name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity, and after twenty-four years, they shall ascend upon cloud chariots, soaring through the Nine Mysteries.

The *Purple Writ True Formula* originates from the Supreme August, the Dao of primordial antiquity, composed by the loftiest sages. The Primordial August Jade Emperor transmitted it to the Azure Essence Emperor Lord, marking its wondrous efficacy and compiling it into the *Golden Root Scriptures*.

The Supreme Emperor appointed twenty-four Golden Dawn Jade Lads and twenty-four Western Florescence Jade Maidens to attend and guard the numinous text, recording merits and clarifying goodness. Should one violate the superior statutes, the transgression is reported to the Jade Emperor, and the Five Emperor Divine Soldiers are dispatched to punish the disciple’s person. Their seven generations of ancestors shall be bound and interrogated, eternally confined to the River Source. Practitioners, be cautious.

Here ends the first scroll of the *Cavern-Real Upper Clarity Azure Essence Purple Writ Golden Root Scriptures*.

The second scroll of the *Cavern-Real Upper Clarity Azure Essence Purple Writ Golden Root Scriptures* was composed by the Upper Minister Azure Lad Lord.

The *Scripture of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning*

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning received the natural progeny of Heaven, coalescing form from the undifferentiated mists of chaos, entrusting his essence to the womb of emptiness, and emerging amid the boundless void. At that time, the dark radiance was yet undivided, the celestial light shrouded in obscurity, and the vast expanse of the Great Void stretched endlessly. After seven thousand kalpas, the heavens brightened and qi purified. The twin luminaries intertwined, dark clouds and purple canopies crowned his head, and the six qi’s lightning bore his true form on their wings. Born of the night, he shone with innate light, his divine radiance illuminating the chamber. He dispersed the fragrant mists of emptiness, dwelling in the realm of dawn clouds, refining his countenance by the shores of the Cavernous Abyss. Alone, he rode the tally of numinous talismans, wielding the chapters of profound descent. Within, his qi ascended the dark cliffs, his thoughts delved into the hidden depths. Suddenly, he roamed freely, his gaze wandering without constraint. Jade wheels and jasper chariots, azure carriages and dark dragons—his flying essence trailed mist, his radiant lightning illuminated the void palace. He journeyed east to the realm of Azure Waters and Luxuriant Forests, ascending to rest in the Nine-Bend Chambers of Blue Dawn. Proceeding to the Golden Portals, he received the title of Supreme Primordial August Emperor of Jade Purity and Purple Emptiness.

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao presented a golden tablet and jade writ, commanding that his name be memorialized in the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence and Square Cauldron. Upon receiving his mandate, he governed the myriad streams, and three thousand Jade Maidens of the Dark Efflorescence and three thousand Lads of the Golden Dawn descended. Flying dragons and venomous beasts, colossal serpents a thousand fathoms long, and simians of the heavens brandished their claws, standing guard at the Jade Pass. Heavenly majesty blazed in the vast courtyard. Azure feathered canopies streamed with purple phoenix sigils, golden perfection and jade radiance blazed through the Seven Origins. Divine tigers bore the upper talismans, flowing gold and fire bells entwined the Primordial August Emperor. Ascending to the Jade Purity, he took charge of the true forms of the Supreme August High Emperor, his Dao perfected and qi clarified. He then expounded the thirty-nine numinous chapters, their jade wisdom flowing in boundless eloquence. Wondrous sounds issued from the Primordial Heaven, jade echoes resounded from the Cavernous Gates—thus was it named the *Numinous Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Its Dao is supremely venerable, coeval with the Primordial Beginning. Lofty and wondrously transformative, its measure is beyond reckoning. Its flowing tones endure for billions of eons without cease, its scripture renewed after ten thousand kalpas. Without a golden tablet or jade name, none may partake of its teachings.

Later disciples who diligently aspire to lofty heights, casting off burdens and forgetting the dust, calming their hearts and fostering constancy, facing the dawn clouds and morning radiance, purifying their essence and enduring hardship in devotion—even if weary, they dare not sleep. They present golden tablets and jade writs, inscribing their names in Jade Purity, and only then may they receive the *Oral Instructions of the Scripture of the Great Cavern*. When the Three Origins stand in attendance, their voices shake the Nine Heavens. Those who obtain this chapter rank among the roots of the Upper Perfected. With a golden tablet and memorial writ, their names are presented by the Jade Lads to the Eastern Florescence, and they become Perfected Ones. Their chambers summon the radiance of emptiness, their halls descend the hundred harmonies’ incense. Jade maidens attend at their sides, golden lads guard their forms. Their cavernous insight pierces the cliffs of the farthest heavens, harmonizing with the Three Luminaries to commune with the true, commanding the Five Dawns to drive their chariots, urging flying dragons to pull their wheels. Ascending to the Three Simplicities’ palace, they bow before the Supreme Emperor.

The transmission of the Supreme Primordial August Emperor’s legacy, the ultimate truth of the Most High Great Dao—this subtle, wondrous, and numinous transformation of the Primordial Beginning’s secret writ was entrusted to the Upper Minister Azure Lad Lord, who oversees its recording in the Eastern Florescence and transmits it to later sages destined to become Perfected Ones. This Dao is a precious secret; it is not transmitted to the lower world. Those who lightly disclose its divine scripture shall be consigned to the Dark Source, their persons tormented by wind blades. Their seven ancestral generations shall bear the burden of Mount Meng’s stones, filling the River of Night. They shall never attain immortality.

The Upper Minister Azure Lad Lord said: The golden tablets and jade writs issue from the Numinous Capital of the Most High. Jade is carved into writs, gold is forged into tablets, inscribed with vermilion script and bound with purple cords. They are perpetually shaded by dark clouds and purple canopies in their chambers, while the hundred harmonies’ incense perfumes their courtyards. Three hundred Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence and three hundred Lads of the Golden Dawn are appointed to guard the numinous scripture.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning received it from the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, whose true precepts were transmitted thrice every seven hundred years. All disciples, though they may not yet have obtained this scripture, have already had their names presented in reverse order to the Azure Palace—only lacking the golden tablet and jade characters.

The Attendant Immortal Gentlemen and Recorders of the Jade Bureau constantly observe in secret the diligence or negligence of practitioners. Those who are earnest and endure hardship are commanded to receive this scripture in mystery, presenting their names to the Jade Emperor of the Three Origins and the Eastern Florescence. The Most High shall dispatch Perfected Ones to transmit the true scripture to them. Later sages and all Perfected Ones must first present tablets to the Eastern Florescence and submit jade writs to the Upper Clarity before they may receive the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Through purifying their essence and enduring hardship, they ascend to become Perfected Ones.

Later disciples whose names are not recorded on golden tablets in the Azure Palace, whose jade registers bear no entry in the dark compilation, may not receive the divine scripture. Heavenly demons may not claim them, true numina shall never descend, and jade maidens shall not guard their persons. Therefore, I now transmit the precepts of the Supreme August Emperor, compiling and arranging them to open a ford for later disciples. Those with resolve should intensify their purification, redouble their diligence, and focus their thoughts on the dark truth, moving the Jade Emperor to compassion. Presenting tablets to the Azure Palace, they may then recite the divine scripture, penetrating the hidden mysteries. The Most High shall dispatch cinnabar chariots and flying carriages to welcome their persons, ascending to Jade Purity.

Yet the prohibitions of this scripture are especially weighty; it is not transmitted to the untrue. The method for sealing golden tablets and jade writs upon the Five Marchmounts: The Most High regularly dispatches the Jade Dawn Primordial August Emperor, the Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate, and the Attendant Immortal Gentlemen to the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence on the first day of the first month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month—three times yearly—to review and verify the registers of true immortals. Those whose names are inscribed on golden tablets are reported to the Three Origins, and according to the depth of their study, jade lads and jade maidens are assigned to guard their persons. Should any leak its secrets, disdain the true, or slight the Dao, they shall be reported by the jade lads. Even with a golden tablet, their names shall be struck from the rolls and transferred to the offices of ghost officials. Their persons shall be tormented by wind blades, and their seven ancestral generations shall bear the burden of Mount Meng’s stones, filling the River of Night.

All diligent disciples, on these days, should calm their hearts in secluded chambers, purify their essence in quiet devotion, and scatter incense to left and right. They shall inscribe eight golden tablets in vermilion, bind them with purple cords, and present them to the Supreme Jade Emperor and the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence.

Eight jade tablets shall be presented to the Three Origins. First, within the chamber, face east and strike the teeth nine times. Read through the tablets once, then conclude with the oral invocation, thus addressing the Supreme:

To the Most High Supreme Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Sovereigns, and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones: born in the final kalpa of this generation, long stained by the clamor of dust, yet by the accumulated blessings and virtue of former lives, I have been granted the vision of the true scriptures. Now I present these golden tablets, inscribing my name in the Jade Purity, sealing them to the sacred peaks, that I may forever serve as a celestial minister. I humbly beseech the Most High to record my name in the registers of the Three Origins, to bestow jade lads and jade maidens for my protection, and to permit me to ride the soaring rosy clouds, ascending to the imperial palace.

This done, rise and bow twice.

The first tablet presented to the Most High Supreme Jade Emperor shall read:
The Master of [Name] Peak, Wang Jia, styled Jia, born in the [Year] Zi month, on the first day of the [Month] Zi hour of the [Year] [Month], presents these golden tablets, purple registers, and jade-script treasures, ascending to the Most High Supreme Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Sovereigns, and the Twenty-Four Exalted Perfected Ones, in the Jeweled Palace of Golden Tablets, Purple Radiance, and Jade Splendor.

The above shall be inscribed on one tablet for presentation. The petition continues:

Conclude, rise, and bow twice.

Born into the human realm, he is bound to the qi of the Perfected, his aspiration fixed on leaving no trace, his body dwelling upon the eternal heights, sheltered beneath the sacred peaks. Reverently following the mysterious statutes, he presents this golden tablet, recording his name in the Upper Palace, beseeching that he be granted enrollment in the Jade Clarity, that divine Perfected Ones descend, that he may depart the lower world, ascend to the Golden Portal, and advance to pay homage before the Jade Emperor.

Respectfully submitted.

The above shall be inscribed on one tablet for presentation.

Eight golden tablets in total shall be used, bound with purple cords. Facing east, the tablets shall be read through once. Upon completion, the following invocation shall be recited:

To the High Minister of the Grand Clarity, the Jade Treasure of the Golden Portal, the Master of the Lofty Dawn, and the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea: Jia, by virtue of past karmic blessings, has been filled with felicity in later generations. Through the cultivation of a true master, he has received the supreme scriptures. Reverently presenting this golden tablet, he records his name in the Azure Palace, beseeching that he be granted enrollment and that the Jade Youth be entrusted with his record. May this be universally proclaimed to all heavens and earths, the Caverns of Clarity, Depth, and Origin, and the immortals of the Five Peaks. May all witness this separate decree, and may true numina descend, allowing him to ride the flying clouds and ascend to the Three Clarities.

Upon completion, rise and bow twice.

After presenting the tablets on all three sides, turn again to the east, click the teeth nine times, and recite the incantation:

The primal net stretches into the distant, the celestial Perfected dwell in the hidden. By the blessings of former lives, felicity extends to this rebirth. Through the karmic bond with a true master, the precious scriptures were faithfully transmitted. Daring to inform the Three Origins, I present this memorial to the Jade Clarity. Inscribed in gold for the Eastern Florescence, my name is recorded in the immortal registers. May I forever be a servant of the Emperor, and may true numina descend. Grant me Jade Youths and Jade Maidens to guard my form, that I may ride the flying clouds, ascend to the Golden Portal, and prostrate before the Jade Court.

Upon completion, swallow the saliva nine times and cease.

After all is done, bury the tablets at the affiliated peak, with the Jade Emperor’s tablet to the north, the Three Origins’ tablet to the west, and the Azure Palace’s tablet to the east, three feet deep into the earth, and firmly tamp the soil above.

Upon completion of the burial, prostrate facing north, click the teeth nine times, and recite the incantation:

My name is memorialized in the Jade Register, my record inscribed in the Upper Clarity. Golden tablets and jade missives compose this imperial missive. The lofty and distant, the Three Origins and the hidden—true officials descend. Reverently, I invoke the numinous. Sealing the tablets in the sacred peak, the memorial is presented to the Three Clarities, listed in the Eastern Florescence, and my jade name is recorded. May I ride the mysterious chariot, the flying clouds and green carriage, ascending to the Three Origins, my body soaring to the Imperial Dawn.

Upon completion, rise and bow twice.

The method of presenting tablets to seek immortality, as received by the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning from the Most High, requires three presentations of tablets and missives. Within nine years, the Jade Emperor will bestow cinnabar essence, jade mushrooms, dragon seals, and phoenix insignia. The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate will descend to your chamber, and the Three Origins will dispatch thirty-six Jade Youths and Jade Maidens. The High Minister Azure Lad will inform the Five Peaks and grant you the office of immortal, along with a canopy of flying clouds, to welcome your body’s ascent to the Palace of the Golden Portal.

This precious and secret text of the Most High is not transmitted to the world. It is entrusted to the High Minister Azure Lad for safekeeping, to verify the registers of true immortals and transmit it to those destined to become Perfected Ones. If one’s bone and qi are suitable, or if one seeks with utmost sincerity and devotion, moved by the Upper Clarity, and beholds this text, their name shall be retroactively recorded in the Azure Palace. Following the statutes and presenting the tablets, they shall become a Perfected One.

The Most High has assigned thirty-six Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence to attend and guard the sacred text, recording merits and manifesting virtue. If you possess this text, you must constantly burn incense, pay reverence, and recite it as if serving a sovereign or father. The divine and numinous will naturally descend and appear in your chamber.

Those who violate the statutes or reveal it carelessly shall perish and be consigned to the offices of ghosts, eternally confined in hell, never attaining immortality. Be warned and cautious.

Those who study immortality but lack this text may not recklessly recite the thirty-nine chapters of the *Jade Clarity’s Precious Scriptures*. Whenever the Jade Scriptures are chanted, they shake the Nine Heavens, and all Celestial Kings prostrate themselves to listen. Their resonance is lofty and far-reaching, their power not insignificant. On the day of recitation, the Azure Lad of the Eastern Florescence, leading the immortals, shall verify the jade names. Those who have presented golden tablets shall be universally proclaimed to all heavens, earths, and the Three Realms, and all shall come to their domain to bow in reverence. Those without a jade name or golden missive who recite the thirty-nine chapters shall disturb the Most High, and the officials shall be dispatched to restrain them.

Those who recklessly invoke the sacred scriptures shall lose their spirit and essence, their minds and natures become disordered, their emotions unstable, shifting between anger and joy. Among countless scholars, not one in ten thousand achieves Perfection. Though they seek diligently, few avoid failure midway. Some grow lax, others become resentful, cursing and reviling, striking gods and ghosts, or slandering sacred texts, doubting their authenticity. Some leak precious secrets, exposing them to the world. All this stems from the Eastern Florescence lacking their golden name, so they are not praised by the Three Realms and are instead assailed by demonic forces, failing in every trial—a sign of impending death. Thus, the thirty-nine chapters may not be recklessly recited.

Those who obtain this scripture should pay reverence, purify themselves, and cultivate it with devotion. Do not recite it carelessly. Over time, you will naturally receive golden tablets and jade missives.

**Presenting Golden Tablets to the Upper Register at the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence**

All who study the Dao and achieve Perfection as true immortals must first journey to the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence in the Land of Square Cauldrons to present tablets and pay homage to the Azure Lad. The Eastern Florescence has six gates, each encompassing a circuit of three thousand li.

The Eastern Gate is named the Gate of Azure Florescence, guarded by Gatekeeper Qiu Boyuan, who oversees the registers of immortal studies.

The Southern Gate is named the Gate of Divine Florescence and Jade, guarded by Gatekeeper Yu Zusi, who oversees the comings and goings of true immortals and divine transcendents.

**Western Gate** is named the Gate of Jade Grotto, guarded by Gatekeeper Yu Shangjie, who oversees the comings and goings of the Supreme Assembly of Perfected Ones—Jade Sovereign, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Jade Perfected, and the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise.

**Northern Gate** is named the Gate of Jade Shade, guarded by Gatekeeper Shi Shaohua, who oversees the registers of true immortals and beginning disciples, as well as those subject to reprimand, demotion, or expulsion.

**Southeastern Gate** is named the Gate of Heavenly Pass, guarded by Gatekeeper Wu Che, who oversees the ledgers of karmic causes and conditions, and the records of those who attain immortality.

**Northeastern Gate** is named the Gate of Cold Waters, guarded by Gatekeeper Tong Lindu, who oversees the registers of wandering spirits and their reincarnations.

These six gates govern the Eastern Mound Mountain. At each gate stand three hundred lions and colossal beasts, with three thousand guardian soldiers stationed as attendants. Those who study the Dao should first learn the names and order of these gates; those who know them shall not die, and their names may be presented to the Azure Palace.

Upon entering the chamber, one must burn incense and constantly visualize the names of the gates and their gatekeepers. After nine years of such practice, one may ascend through the gates upon clouds.

This Dao is secretly preserved within the Jade Treasure Palace. Those who attain this knowledge shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. If lightly disclosed or transmitted to the unworthy, one shall be eternally confined to the Night Prison and never be permitted entry into the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence.

Within the gates lie three palaces:

The **First Palace** is named the Azure Palace of Square Cauldrons.
The **Second Palace** is named the Jade Treasure Azure Palace.
The **Third Palace** is named the Jade Florescence Azure Palace.

Within these palaces stand hundreds of jade trees, upon which perch kun-pengs and phoenixes, along with birds of nine colors. Below grow lingzhi herbs and jade wells, with springs that flow of their own accord. Those who drink from them shall enjoy a lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries. Lions and celestial beasts stand guard along the walls.

The **Upper Minister, Azure Lad**, governs within the Azure Palace of Square Cauldrons, dwelling in a golden hall with chambers of jasper. Three thousand Perfected Maidens attend him on either side. A radiance of dark splendor shines of itself, and divine candles illuminate the halls. Azure mists shade the palace above, while purple clouds encircle its chambers.

In the northern hall of the palace stands a golden register, upon which rests a jade register. Within lie the ledgers of immortal studies, the golden tablets and jade missives of those whose Dao-names have deepened or shallowed over time—numbering one hundred thousand in all. These are overseen by the Jade Lord of Immortal Records. Those who attain this knowledge shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The **Upper Minister, Great Marshal Gao Chenshi**, governs within the Azure Purple Palace of the Jade Treasure. Clouds encircle its chambers, and ethereal mists arise within its halls. Divine candles illuminate its interiors of their own accord. Three thousand Perfected Maidens of Jade attend him on either side.

In the northern hall of the palace stands a golden register, upon which rest golden seals, phoenix insignia, jade missives, vermilion and azure feathered canopies, and the vestments of ascended immortals—bestowed upon those who attain Perfection. Also recorded here are the ranks of immortal studies, the ledgers of promotions and demotions, overseen by the Jade Dawn of Attendant Immortals. Those who attain this knowledge shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

The **Azure Florescence Lad of the Eastern Sea** governs within the Jade Florescence Azure Palace. Purple clouds shade its halls above, while the sun and moon flank its eaves. Three thousand Perfected Maidens of Jade attend him on either side.

In the eastern hall of the palace, upon a jade register, rest three hundred volumes of precious scriptures and nine thousand jade instructions. These govern the ledgers of immortal studies and are bestowed upon those destined to become Perfected Ones. They are overseen by the Jade Dawn of Attendant Immortals. Those who attain this knowledge shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

**The Protocol of Reverence and Posture at the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence**

The Azure Lad states: All who study the Dao and seek immortality should know the protocol of reverence and posture. Those who master it shall have their names inscribed in reverse order in the Azure Palace.

One must diligently focus the mind, enter the chamber, burn incense, and visualize the six gates and three palaces in vivid detail. Then, knock the teeth together three times and recite the following incantation while looking upward:

*"Supreme Clarity of the Mystic Dawn,
Three Palaces and Six Gates,
Inscribe my jade name,
Send down my divine Perfected Ones.
Dragon skirts and feathered regalia
Shall adorn my body.
Ascending to Jade Clarity,
Presenting my missive to the Eastern Florescence,
My name engraved upon the golden register,
I shall forever be a guest of the Emperor."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi nine times and cease.

After nine years of such practice, true spirits shall descend, Perfected Maidens shall appear, and clouds of dark radiance with green chariots shall come to welcome your body.

In cultivating this Dao, one must not tread upon defiled ground or enter impure places. One should constantly maintain purity, fast, and invoke the Perfected Ones—then the true shall unfailingly descend.

This method is secret and essential; it must not be lightly transmitted. If transmitted to the unworthy, calamity shall extend to the Seven Ancestors, and one’s body shall be subjected to the tortures of the Wind Blade.

**The Proper Rites for Presenting Golden Tablets**

All who study the Dao and attain Perfection must first journey to the Azure Palace of the Eastern Florescence to present golden tablets and receive their immortal titles.

Upon arriving at the Gate of Divine Florescence and Jade, before reaching the gate, one shall see two jade towers flanking it. Prostrate to the left of the towers and present the tablet. After a moment, a report shall be given; then rise and proceed to the gate, prostrating again to its left. After a moment, four Perfected Ones shall emerge to guide you forward. Rise and proceed directly to the Azure Palace of Square Cauldrons, prostrating at the base of the steps.

At the appointed time, an attendant shall chant the praises. Upon hearing the chant, rise and bow twice. The Perfected Ones shall lead you up the hall, ascending from the left of the southern steps. Prostrate before the hall, and after a moment, the Jade Lord of Immortal Records shall arrive bearing golden tablets and purple registers to verify your jade name. Once your name is confirmed in the purple ledger, you shall be granted a jade missive and bestowed a new title as a true immortal, ascending to Jade Clarity.

Thirty-six Feathered Lads in vermilion and azure, thirty-six Perfected Ones of Gold with flowing golden fire-bells, and thirty-six Jade Lads and Maidens—along with thirty-six Immortal Officials—shall be present.

Upon receiving the title, rise and bow twice, then retreat to the base of the steps and bow twice more. Proceed to the gate and bow twice again, always facing the palace.

At this time, you shall be assigned a governing office, a place of residence, and the protocols for roaming the Five Peaks.

This is the old protocol of the Azure Palace, observed by those who have not yet attained Perfection.

**Presenting at the Azure Palace of Square Cauldrons before the Upper Minister, the Azure Lad:**

[Your name], Master of [Your Peak], Wang [Your Surname], aged [Your Age], also named [Your Dao-name], styled [Your Style], born in the [X] month.

**Protocol for the Golden Tablet:**
Inscribe one tablet and present it above.

This is the rite for those who have attained the Dao, journeying to the Azure Palace to present golden tablets and receive their titles as true immortals of the Upper Register.

The Upper Minister’s records are stored in the Palace of Jade Treasures, not transmitted to the lower world. Should one obtain them, it signifies that their bone-configuration aligns with immortality, their name corresponds to the Jade Register, and they shall naturally ascend to the Azure Palace. This method is especially solemn; it must not be rashly disclosed. Violators will be interrogated by the Three Officials—exercise utmost caution.

**Protocols for the Upper Clarity Golden Gates Palace**

The Upper Clarity Golden Gates Palace lies north of the Three Origins Palace, five myriad *li* distant. To the east of the Highest Abode, nine thousand *li* west of the Black Feather Wilds’ Western Ridge Mountain, it stands west of Jade Clarity, conjoined with the Celestial Pass. Four gates flank its exterior, each gate flanked by two towers—one golden, one jade—positioned to the left and right. At each gate stand three hundred feather-robed guardian officers and three hundred lion-headed colossal beasts. Within flow the Pure Essence Jade Mushroom and Flowing Rosy Mist Springs.

The Eastern Gate is named the Jade Radiance Golden Fusion Gate. Two Jade Dawn Kings, wielding nine-jointed banners, each guard one half. This is the passage through which the Highest Jade Clarity Void Sovereign’s perfected guests enter and exit.

The Southern Gate is named the Cavern Treasure Rosy Cloud Gate, through which perfected ones and flying immortals roam the Eight Poles, traverse the Five Peaks, and come and go.

The Western Gate is named the Mystic Capital Jade Treasure Gate, through which those studying immortality receive their perfected titles and proceed to have their names inscribed in the registers.

The Northern Gate is named the Northern Darkness Ultimate Cloud Gate, through which perfected ones who have committed transgressions are demoted to the ranks of the Lesser Sovereigns, and through which those studying the plain tablets pass.

Each of the four gates has two towers: the golden tower on the left, the jade tower on the right, both nine thousand *zhang* in height. The golden towers are supported by golden pillars, shaded by purple clouds, their surfaces inscribed with the names of the host of perfected ones and flying immortals. The jade towers are supported by azure jade pillars, shaded by green clouds, their surfaces inscribed with the names of the Supreme Perfected. All eight towers are thus.

Beneath the towers stand Azure Dragons and White Tigers to the left and right, celestial beasts and colossal serpents guarding the jade towers. Three hundred jade lads and jade maidens scatter incense among them. Atop the towers rise nine-tiered golden platforms, where the Void Sovereign’s Jade Dawn Commanding Immortal Lords reside.

The palace grounds span seven thousand *li* in circumference, with the Golden Gates Palace at its center. Within stand golden-hued purple halls, jasper chambers, and jade rooms, where the Latter Sage Golden Gates Emperor Lord dwells. Purple clouds shade above, green mists coil around the halls, sun and moon illuminate from either side, divine candles glow of themselves, golden perfected and jade maidens scatter incense in the empty courtyards, flowing light suffuses the Eight Mysteries, winds stir the dark banners, dancing pennants and canopies revolve, jade trees emit sounds, jasper branches murmur of their own accord, and a hundred harmonies arise in concert—this is the upper guesthouse of the Golden Gates, the passage through which the host of perfected ones travel.

The Four Poles Perfected Ones oversee those studying immortality, transmitting registers, advancing or demoting ranks, and all protocols for beginning students. All matters proceed through the Four Poles Perfected Ones.

**Protocol for Presenting Jade Tablets**

When one’s study of the Dao is complete, they proceed to the Eastern Florescence Azure Palace to verify their golden name. Afterward, they undergo a three-month purification fast, inscribe one jade tablet, and present themselves at the Golden Gates to pay homage to the Golden Gates Emperor Lord. The protocol requires that at the Cavern Treasure Rosy Cloud Gate, they prostrate and present the jade tablet. After a moment, upon receiving a response, they rise, bow twice to the Four Poles Perfected Ones, who then lead them forward to the base of the Golden Gates. They prostrate again between the golden tower on the left and the jade tower on the right. The perfected one leads them into the Purple Hall.

They proceed leftward, circling the Jade Radiance Golden Fusion Gate, then move southeast, ascending the palace steps to prostrate at the base of the hall. The Left Commanding Immortal Jade Gentleman, bearing the Purple Phoenix Vermilion Seal, Flying Jade Sentiments, Flying Azure Feather Canopy, Vermilion Brocade Flying Skirts, Tenfold Absolute Dragon Banners, causes them to ascend the Three Origins Palace. With flowing gold fire bells, jade tablets, and golden seals, they summon the thousand spirits, flowing clouds, dark rosy mists, and nine-dragon jade chariots to confer the title of Perfected Immortal, enabling flight through the Great Void and attendance at the chanting ceremonies. Once the matter is concluded, they rise, bow twice, and offer three bows of gratitude.

This is merely the conferral of the title; they have not yet been granted an audience with the Emperor Lord. Upon completion, they proceed directly to the base of the Northern Darkness Ultimate Cloud Gate’s golden tower, prostrate facing east, and declare: “Wandering Student Master Wang [Surname], having now received the title of Perfected Immortal from the Emperor Lord, is overwhelmed with joy and celebration. I humbly present myself at the tower to express gratitude and seek an audience with the Void Sovereign’s Jade Dawn Commanding Immortal Lord, to record my name in the Golden Gates and list it among the Perfected Immortals.”

They rise and bow twice, then proceed to the base of the Mystic Capital Jade Treasure Gate’s golden tower, prostrate facing south, and declare as above. Next, they proceed to the base of the Cavern Treasure Rosy Cloud Gate’s golden tower, prostrate facing west, and declare as above. Finally, they proceed to the base of the Jade Radiance Golden Fusion Gate’s golden tower, prostrate facing east, and declare as above.

After visiting the four gates and eight towers, they return outside the Jade Radiance Golden Fusion Gate, prostrate again, and bow twice. The Four Poles Perfected Ones then bestow upon them the golden tablet and jade seal. At that time, cloud chariots from the immortals of the Five Peaks shall naturally arrive to welcome them. They shall then be assigned a direction and entrusted with the governance of a sacred peak.

**Presenting at the Upper Clarity Golden Gates Palace before the Latter Sage Emperor Lord:**

[Your Peak] Master, Your Servant Wang [Your Surname], aged [Your Age], styled [Your Style].

**Golden Tablet Text:**
Inscribe one tablet and present it above.

This is the upper protocol for those who have attained the Dao, journeying to the Golden Gates to present tablets and receive their titles as Perfected Immortals from the Golden Gates Emperor Lord. The rites of homage and gratitude are treasured and concealed by the Emperor Lord, bestowed only upon those who have attained Perfection, not transmitted to the lower world.

Those who obtain the name of the Golden Gates Palace and the protocols for the golden tablets are recorded in the Inverted Golden Register and shall naturally ascend to the Golden Gates. The names of the Golden Gates Palace’s gates are all hidden names of the Nine Heavens, differing from the sounds of the earthly realm. Thus, the *Highest Void Sovereign Dao Lord’s Scripture on the Easy Possession* states: “In the northwest of the Nine Heavens above, the name is *Easy Possession*, three thousand five hundred *li* from the Mystic Capital Treasure Gate. Yet the *qi* of the Luminous Beam connects them, and the two gates communicate.”

The assembly of perfected beings roam here, the sequence of their progression hinges upon this: once ascending through the Gate of *Easy Possession*, they then rise to the Emperor’s Hall, gaining audience with the Mystic Radiance Jade Treasure, and thus proceed to present themselves at the court of the Three Primes. Scholars who have not yet ascended this gate should know its name. In vain do they traverse mountains and forests, severing their ties to the human world, yet remain ignorant of the gate’s origin, the protocols of the Heavenly Perfected—how then may they ascend to the Golden Gates Palace?

In the practice of meditative visualization, if one does not know the name and location of the spirit, the spirit will certainly not descend. Those who wish to ascend the Golden Gates and journey to the Eastern Florescence must know its name and protocol—how else could they ascend the palace? This knowledge emerges from beyond the Nine Heavens, concealed within the Golden Gates. Those who know it shall not die; those who obtain it shall become flying immortals, and scholars shall attain the rank of Perfected Beings. Among the unlearned of the world, even those who know the name of the Golden Gates Palace are praised throughout the Three Realms, revered by the myriad spirits, and feared by the thousand demons—how much more so for those of cultivated learning?

This Dao is precious and must not be lightly transmitted. If imparted to the unworthy, calamity shall befall seven generations of ancestors, and the transgressor’s own person shall face tribulation, with no hope of attaining immortality.

**The Perfected One’s Method for Parting the Celestial Pass and Ascending as a Flying Immortal**

The Celestial Pass is the Gate of Life of the Nine Heavens. It governs the southeast corner of the Nine Heavens, also called the Celestial Chart or the Celestial Pass—thus, it is known as the Three Passes. It is the path traversed by the assembly of perfected beings, the course taken by divine immortals, and the route by which scholars ascend. It lies five thousand *li* from the Golden Gates and seven thousand *li* from the Jade Purity Upper Palace. Those who part the Three Passes may then ascend to the Golden Gates and wander in the feasts of Jade Purity.

The First Celestial Pass stands atop a nine-tiered jade terrace, rising one thousand two hundred *zhang* above the earth. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass. Three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand at the gates’ thresholds. The Grand Void Jade Dawn Overseer, whose name is *Void Upper Radiance*, resides upon the jade terrace. Flying clouds and flowing rosy mists flank his chamber; the sun and moon’s mysterious illumination penetrates the Jade Purity, casting light throughout. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, overseeing the passage of the highest perfected beings as they enter and exit, opening the pass.

The Second Celestial Chart stands atop a six-tiered jade terrace, nine hundred *zhang* in height. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass. Three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand at either side of the gates. The Supreme Overseer of Perfected Jade Lords, whose name is *Mysterious Upper Elder*, presides upon the jade terrace. Cinnabar clouds and purple canopies shroud his chamber; the mysterious radiance of paired moons illumines the space. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, overseeing the passage where the assembly of perfected beings gather and feast.

The Third Celestial Pass stands atop a three-tiered jade terrace, six hundred *zhang* in height. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass. Three thousand mighty warriors, clad in interlocking golden armor, stand guard at either side. The Supreme Thearch’s Overseer of Perfected Jade Officers, whose name is *Eternal Unchanging Life*, governs from the jade terrace. Dark clouds veil its summit; ethereal mists perfume its courtyard; the light of self-illumination gleams upon its form. Three hundred perfected immortals attend him, overseeing the registers and records of the perfected beings of the upper heavens and the earth below.

For those who receive the method of submitting golden tablets and jade names, they must cultivate the practice of parting the Celestial Passes. Regularly, at dawn and dusk, they should enter their chamber, burn incense, and strike their teeth twelve times. Facing east, they bow in reverence to the four directions, visualizing the boundaries of the Nine Heavens and the Three Passes below, each clearly distinct. When the vision is complete, they next visualize the Seven Stars in the heavens above, revolving in their course. Their own body stands upon the Celestial Pass Star, and the Seven Stars convey them to the base of the jade terrace of the Celestial Pass. There, they cast a jade tablet, submitting their name to the Grand Void Jade Dawn Overseer, who records it upon a jade register, permitting their passage to the base of the Celestial Chart.

Next, they visualize their body returning to the Seven Stars, which convey them to the base of the jade terrace of the Celestial Chart. There, they cast another jade tablet, submitting their name before the Supreme Overseer of Perfected Jade Lords, who records it upon a jade register, permitting their passage to the base of the Celestial Pass.

Then, they visualize their body returning once more to the Seven Stars, which convey them to the base of the jade terrace of the Celestial Pass. There, they cast a jade tablet, submitting their name before the Supreme Thearch’s Overseer of Perfected Jade Officers, who records it upon a jade register, permitting their passage to the base of the Golden Pass and the Jade Purity Palace.

Next, they visualize the Seven Stars vanishing, their body suspended in the boundless void, adrift in the primordial chaos, with nothing to rely upon. In an instant, they find themselves above the Golden Gates’ Jade Radiance Golden Fusion Gate, where they cast a golden tablet. The Four Poles Perfected Beings receive it upon a jade tray and present it before the Golden Gates Emperor Lord. The Four Poles Perfected Beings report back, ascending together with them to the Jade Purity above.

Then, they visualize the Jade Purity above, its four extremities boundless and without edge. Only a dense, verdant *qi* is visible; above, there is no heaven; below, there is no earth. They see only a central golden gate with four pathways, within which stands a jade palace and jade trees, golden branches growing on either side, with mighty dragons and beasts frolicking upon their peaks. They visualize themselves wandering among them for a long while, until they feel as if awakening from sleep, far from their bed, their body faint and indistinct, as if treading upon emptiness.

When their journey through the Grotto Metropolis is complete, they strike their teeth thirty-six times and, gazing upward, recite the incantation:

*"The Three Flowers’ precious radiance illumines the Jade Capital, revealing its brilliance;
The Mystic Splendor unfolds, casting light upon the formless.
Golden tablets with green characters perfectly submit the jade name,
Brightly beholding the Nine Heavens, ascending to sport in the Three Purities.
The Three Celestial Charts of the Celestial Passes are traversed, returning to the Purple Court;
The Golden Gates bestow a title, the Eastern Florescence records life.
Attaining the Eight Effulgences, they join the flight of the cloud chariot."*

When finished, they swallow *qi* nine times and cease.

For those who study yet do not know the method of parting the Celestial Passes or the way of submitting tablets and recording names, all their efforts shall come to naught.

The Three Passes govern all the heavens, all the earths, the perfected *zhenren* who ascend as flying immortals, and even the initial records of beginning students—none fail to pass through these Three Passes. For all who accumulate learning, if they can ensure their jade names are inscribed within the Nine Heavens’ Three Passes, and if the Jade Morning of the Three Passes submits to the Palace of the Supreme Great Emperor, then the Imperial Lord shall dispatch twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens to guard and protect their person. This is the supreme scripture of the Supreme Emperor, transmitted to the Celestial Imperial Lord; the Celestial Imperial Lord transmitted it to the Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen; the Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen transmitted it to the Celestial Imperial Lord of the Grand Tenuity; the Celestial Imperial Lord of the Grand Tenuity transmitted it to the Imperial Lord of the Golden Gates; the Imperial Lord of the Golden Gates transmitted it to the Azure Lad, the Supreme Minister, instructing him to teach later students who are destined to become *zhenren*. According to the mysterious statutes, within seven hundred years, three transmissions are permitted.

The Upper Prime Lord commands ninety maidens of the Western Florescence to guard within the Purple Chamber of the Southern Culmen. The Azure Lad says: Those whose bone configurations align with the mysterious may behold this Dao, and knowing the method of submitting tablets, they shall become *zhenren*. Yet the statutes are exceedingly weighty, and it must not be lightly disclosed. Among the multitudes of scholars, how few encounter the true! Thus the Yellow Elder of the Central says: To behold the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* is to ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Yet some who cultivate it for years achieve nothing and then claim the scripture is not true. This is entirely due to the absence of a golden tablet’s entry in the Eastern Florescence and the lack of a jade slip’s name in the Golden Gates. The perfected do not descend for them, and they are instead ridden by celestial demons, thus failing to achieve resonance, merely obtaining spirit scriptures, and accomplishing nothing. Had they first submitted a golden tablet to the Azure Palace and presented a jade slip to the Imperial Sovereign, receiving the attendance of the Golden Morning’s jade lads and the Western Florescence’s jade maidens to guard the numinous text, with all heavens and earths universally approving, chanting the verses ten thousand times—would they not have evoked the response of jade chariots and purple carriages?

**Text for Parting the Three Passes and Submitting Jade Slips to Ascend as an Immortal:**

*At the Jade Terrace of the Celestial Pass, beneath the Jade Morning’s Supervisory Bureau:*
[Name of commandery, county, village, and hamlet], *zhenren* Wang [given name], aged [number] years, styled [courtesy name].

*At the Jade Terrace of the Celestial Chart, beneath the Jade Lad of the Supreme Direct Perfected:*
[Name of commandery, county, village, and hamlet], *zhenren* Wang [given name], aged [number] years, styled [courtesy name].

*At the Jade Terrace of the Celestial Pass, beneath the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Emperor’s Perfected:*
[Name of commandery, county, village, and hamlet], *zhenren* Wang [given name], aged [number] years, styled [courtesy name].

Write the above on three jade slips, each one foot and six inches in length.

**Text for Parting the Golden Gates and Submitting Jade Slips to Ascend as an Immortal:**

*Before the Imperial Lord of the Golden Gates Palace:*
[Name of commandery, county, village, and hamlet], *zhenren* Wang [given name], aged [number] years, styled [courtesy name], born in the [ordinal] month.

Write the above on a jade slip, one foot and six inches in length.

The Azure Lad says: If one lacks a golden tablet, silver or wood may suffice; if one lacks a jade slip, paulownia wood may suffice. Let them be refined and fine, with straight grain and no knots.

The Azure Lad says: When visualizing parting the Celestial Pass, the Celestial Chart, and the Celestial Pass to ascend the path to the Azure Palace, the Golden Gates, and the Jade Purity, one must inscribe the jade slip. First, enter the chamber, click the teeth twelve times, face east, and read the slip. Then, complete the method of cultivation, visualization, and contemplation. Place the slip in a cloud-brocade pouch, constantly burn incense beside it, and do not lightly reveal it. This is the supreme title of the highest perfected, the numinous scripture of the Jade Lads.

If one’s golden name and jade characters are retroactively inscribed in the Azure Palace and one beholds this Dao, they must follow the statutes of the Supreme Perfected. Prepare one golden tablet and one jade slip, each one foot and six inches long and two inches and four *fen* wide, along with one golden dragon and one jade fish. Use one hundred feet of purple silk and forty feet of green damask as the covenant of the Supreme Perfected, offering them to one’s master who possesses the scriptures. The master faces east, the recipient faces north, and they report to the Northern Emperor as a covenant, swearing to the Seven Ancestors as a pledge, vowing not to divulge the secret. According to the mysterious statutes, within seven hundred years, three transmissions are permitted. If transmitted to an unworthy person, the seven generations of ancestors shall be consigned to eternal ghostly servitude, the body shall perish in the Nine Springs, and immortality shall never be attained.

Those of steadfast resolve, those who aspire to immortality, must follow the statutes and serve the perfected, cultivating in accordance with the text.

Here ends the final scroll of the *Scriptures of the Golden Root of the Purple Writ of the Azure Essentials of the Highest Purity of the Great Cavern*.
