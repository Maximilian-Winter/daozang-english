The *Supreme Clarity Jade Axis Scripture of the Perfected of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels*

The Most High Great Dao, the Primordial Ultimate, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: "You seek the essentials of governing others yet do not know the safeguards of governing the self. You cultivate others but not yourself, refine the external but not the internal—is this not a grave error?"

The Yellow Emperor bowed his head, prostrated himself, and knelt in reverence, replying: "How fortunate! How fortunate! With this unworthy body, I await the mysterious decree. I humbly beseech your compassionate salvation and lift my gaze in awe of the sagely teaching."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "When a person is born, they possess a form of eight *chi*, a body uniting the myriad existences. Externally, there are the four limbs and nine orifices; internally, the five viscera and six bowels, each governed by its own spirit, with metal and fire scrutinized in precision, and qi harmonized with water and wood.

The five viscera are the palaces of the five spirits, the vessels of embodied life. For the spirit to be at peace, the qi must be at ease—such is the subtlety of nurturing and cultivation.

Fire is restless and corresponds to ritual; metal is courageous and corresponds to righteousness. Restlessness and courage pertain to yin; righteousness and ritual pertain to yang—such is the principle of yin and yang. When yin prevails, there is destruction; when yang prevails, there is life—such is the principle of life and death.

Thus, to restrain restlessness and practice ritual and righteousness is to live; to indulge in courage and abandon ritual and righteousness is to die. Externally practicing ritual and righteousness while internally pacifying the spleen and gallbladder—this is the secret of nurturing and cultivation.

Regard loyalty and filial piety as foremost. Those who do not recognize their source follow the path of harming life; those who know their root abide in the numinous safeguard of the mysterious.

If one can pacify the spirit, refine the form, gather life through qi, return to correctness and turn from falsity, emerge from the indistinct and enter the profound and wondrous, discern the principles of supplementation and drainage, and master the methods of nurturing and prolonging life, one may ascend as an immortal.

You should take this as your mirror and model, for the Dao resides within it."

The Yellow Emperor respectfully received the numinous instructions and practiced them with single-minded devotion. Before a full twelve-year cycle had passed, his divine insight became manifest. He cultivated kidney qi, refined heart essence, walked beyond the mysterious, embraced the numinous contract, and trod upon water without sinking, entered fire without burning. Qi circulated within, and spirit responded without—was this not the perfection of the utmost truth?

The Yellow Emperor practiced this secret method, supplementing the six bowels, refining the five essences, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, so that true qi penetrated fully. Later, he entrusted the task of casting the tripod cauldron at Mount Li and ascended as an immortal.

**Illustrations and Text of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels**
*Diagram of the Lung Viscus*

To treat the lung, one should employ the *yan* (swallowing) method: *yan* serves as purgation, while inhalation serves as supplementation. The lung is the qi of *Dui* (the trigram), the essence of Metal, its color white, its form like a suspended chime. Its spirit resembles a white beast. The lung generates the *po* (corporeal soul), which transforms into a jade youth, seven inches in height, staff in hand, moving to and fro within the lung viscus. When its spirit is prone to anger, this arises from the lung viscus. To pacify the *po* and preserve its form, one must gather thoughts, restrain desires, embrace benevolence, nurture righteousness, refrain from indulging anger, and avoid amplifying its voice. By stilling its vitality, one aligns with the Great Harmony.

The lung is paired with the large intestine and governs the nose above. Thus, when wind invades the lung, the nose becomes congested. A withered complexion indicates lung dryness. A person with a runny nose harbors worms in the lung. Excessive fear signifies the *po* departing from the lung. White spots on the body indicate lung weakness. Excessive speech reveals lung strength. Intolerance of cold signifies lung taxation. A preference for pungent flavors indicates lung insufficiency. A fresh, white complexion signifies the lung is free of malignance. Rumbling in the large intestine indicates lung qi congestion.

The lung governs the note *Shang*; when the lung is afflicted, one should employ *yan*. *Yan* is the lung’s qi. Its righteous qi dispels illness, and prolonged practice calms the spirit. When resentment and anger fill the chest, one should *yan* to discharge them—this is the natural principle. Without *yan*, harm and decay are inevitable; through *yan*, one attains life. Thus, *yan* is used to treat illness. If one suffers without employing *yan*, it is inauspicious.

The lung resides in the seventh palace, the Gate of Surprise, governing trust. It makes one upright and honest; in martial practice, loyalty comes first, ensuring the *hun* is at peace and the form intact. Moreover, the lung governs autumn’s affairs. During the three months of autumn, heaven and earth’s qi is bright, and all things are culled. Sparrows retire early, and roosters rise at dawn. To stabilize the utmost essence, one should practice generosity, suppress anger, and regulate breath—this is the Dao of autumn. To act contrary injures the lung.

Regularly, on the mornings of the full moon in the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, face west, sit upright, strike the Heavenly Drum seven times, and drink the Jade Nectar thrice. Then, close the eyes, inhale the white qi of the *Dui* Palace, draw it into the mouth, and swallow it to replenish the depletion from *yan*, rectify the white’s function, and send off the jade youth. Thus, the spirit is at peace, thoughts are keen, qi is whole, the body is balanced, no evil can afflict one, blades cannot harm, lifespan is extended, and one’s name soars as a flying immortal. This is the result of supplementing and purging spirit and qi, pacifying and stabilizing the numinous soul.

*Diagram of the Heart Viscus*

To treat the heart, one should employ the *he* (exhaling) method: *he* serves as purgation, while inhalation serves as supplementation. The heart is the qi of *Li* (the trigram), the essence of Fire, its color red, its form like a lotus blossom. Its spirit resembles a vermilion bird. The heart generates the spirit, which transforms into a jade maiden, eight inches in height, holding a jade bloom, entering and exiting the heart palace. Its spirit is restless and unsteady; a person’s impetuosity arises from the heart viscus. To pacify the spirit and preserve its form, one must uphold loyalty, practice filial piety, assist righteousness, stabilize benevolence, quell agitation, quiet haste, still its fervor, and clarify its spirit—thus preserving its form and aligning with the Central Harmony.

The heart is paired with the small intestine and governs the blood vessels, presiding over the tongue above. Blood congestion indicates heart alarm. An inability to discern flavors signifies heart depletion. The wise possess seven heart orifices, the moderately wise five, the lesser wise three; the enlightened have two, the ordinary one, and the foolish none. Forgetfulness indicates the spirit’s departure. A preference for bitter flavors indicates heart insufficiency. Excessive sorrow signifies heart injury. Repeated responses indicate heart disorder. A greenish-black complexion signifies heart freezing. A ruddy countenance signifies the heart is free of malignance.

The heart governs the note *Zheng*; when the heart is afflicted, one should employ *he*. *He* is the heart’s qi. Regulating its qi and form, *he* calms the heart and harmonizes the spirit. Thus, when the heart is disordered, one often *he*—this is the sign of celestial wholeness, though people perform it unawares. Without *he*, frustration and anger arise. Thus, *he* is used to treat heart illness, expelling perverse qi.

The heart resides in the ninth palace, the Gate of Surprise, governing ritual. It makes one delight in goodness, practice generosity, and cultivate benevolence through reverence and filial piety—thus harmonizing the heart and preserving the form. Moreover, the heart governs summer’s affairs. During the three months of summer, heaven and earth’s qi intermingles, and all things bloom and bear fruit. One retires late and rises before dawn, never tiring of nurturing. Flourishing growth and fruition are summer’s virtue; to act contrary injures the heart.

Regularly, on the mornings of the crescent moon in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, face south, sit upright, strike the Golden Beam nine times, and rinse the mouth with Dark Spring thrice. Calm the thoughts and inhale the red qi of the *Li* Palace into the heart’s palace, drawing it into the mouth and swallowing it thrice to replenish the depletion from *he*, plant its numinosity, open the heart’s cavities, nourish the Fire of *Li*, and bathe the jade maiden. Thus, the spirit is balanced, the body whole, no misfortune can harm, metal and fire cannot injure—this is the numinous efficacy of governing the spirit.

*Diagram of the Liver Viscus*

To treat the liver, one should employ the *xu* (hissing) method: *xu* serves as purgation, while inhalation serves as supplementation. The liver is the qi of *Zhen* (the trigram), the essence of Wood, its color green, its form like a suspended gourd. The liver generates the *hun* (ethereal soul), its spirit like a dragon, which transforms into two jade maidens and youths—one clad in green, the other in yellow, each an inch in height—one bearing a dragon, the other holding jade nectar, entering and exiting the liver viscus. Its spirit delights in benevolence; a person’s acts of kindness arise from the liver. To pacify the *hun* and extend longevity, one must bestow blessings upon all beings, then preserve life—thus aligning with the Great Clarity.

The liver is paired with the gallbladder and governs the eyes above. When the liver is replete, the eyes redden; it also governs the sinews. When the liver is depleted, the sinews contract.

Dry skin indicates liver heat. Darkened complexion signifies liver wind. A craving for sour flavors reveals liver insufficiency. A greenish hue marks liver excess. Sweating palms and soles shows the liver harbors no malignance. Withered hair and nails denote liver damage. Now, the liver governs the *jiao* note, so for liver ailments, one must employ *xu*. *Xu* is the liver’s qi—its nature benevolent, thus dispelling pain and injury. When one suffers wounds or aches, exhaling *xu* relieves the pain—all natural proofs, yet deemed no marvel? Such is the profound principle, the Dao of penetrating mystery.

Moreover, the liver presides over spring, the season of activation. During spring’s three months, heaven and earth’s qi engenders the myriad beings; flowers and leaves flourish abundantly. Both humans and sprouting grasses follow the Yang’s way—opposing it harms the liver. Such injury leaves hair and bones unnourished. Regularly, at the *yin* hour of the first, second, and third lunar months, face east in level repose, click the teeth thrice, hold the breath for seven cycles, and inhale the green qi of the *Zhen* Palace, swallowing it three times to replenish the losses from *xu*, to offer the prayer of green, and to sate the hunger of the two jade youths. When the essence of Wood prevails, the liver rejoices, free of sorrow—such is the marvel of essence.

**Diagram of the Spleen Viscus**
To regulate the spleen, employ *hu*; *hu* purges, while inhalation tonifies. The spleen is the qi of *Kun*, the essence of Earth, its color yellow, its form like an inverted basin. The spleen governs intention, its spirit like a phoenix, transforming into a jade maiden, six inches in height, circulating within the spleen viscus. Its spirit is prone to jealousy and illness—human jealousy arises from the spleen. Earth has no fixed form, so jealousy lacks consistency; in women, jealousy intensifies due to prevailing Yin qi. To pacify its spirit, one must reduce desires, moderate lust, minimize thoughts, and dispel worries, cultivating Earth’s virtue to preserve life—thus aligning with the Great Yin.

The spleen connects to the stomach, governing the mouth above—it is the granary that transforms food, like a mill grinding raw into cooked. Indigestion stems from the spleen’s failure to rotate; hard foods resist grinding. One should not lie down immediately after eating, lest the spleen tilt and cease turning. Consuming hard or raw foods leads to stagnant food disorders. Thus, when the viscus is imbalanced, the spleen is harmed; when the spleen is disordered, the constitution suffers; when both constitution and spirit are impaired, the person is swiftly injured. Therefore, avoiding hard, raw, or astringent foods is the way to preserve health. Loss of appetite indicates undigested food in the spleen. Excessive confusion reveals a restless spleen spirit. Overeating signifies spleen deficiency. Difficulty swallowing marks spleen obstruction. Pallor indicates spleen damage. A craving for sweetness reveals spleen insufficiency. A radiant, smooth complexion shows the spleen harbors no malignance.

The spleen governs the Central Palace—Earth—so for spleen ailments, employ *hu*. *Hu* draws out spleen illnesses; when internal heat arises, exhaling *hu* dispels the harm of warmth. Without *hu*, heat congests within, Yin suffocates without, leading to distress and oppression—how can the body remain at ease? The spleen’s position is lodged in the two palaces, its duty impartiality, fostering generosity and magnanimity, humbling oneself to aid others, seeking benefit without contention.

Moreover, the spleen has no fixed season, lending its power to the four seasons, assisting the six qi in nurturing the myriad beings. The spleen nourishes the intestines and stomach—this is the Dao of righteousness. It does not claim virtue for itself nor compete with things for merit, embodying the principle of *Kun*. Opposing it harms the spleen. Regularly, on the eighteenth day before the end of each season, at dawn, sit upright in the Central Palace, hold the breath for five cycles, sound the Heavenly Drum seven times, inhale the yellow qi of the Earth Palace, and swallow it five times to replenish the losses from *hu*, drink jade nectar to harmonize the spirit, tonify the spleen, and assist the spirit’s qi. Thus, one may enter mountains unafraid of tigers or wolves, traverse perilous paths without fear of stumbling—such is the essence of qi circulation.

**Diagram of the Kidney Viscus**
To regulate the kidneys, employ *chui*; *chui* purges, while inhalation tonifies. The kidneys are the essence of Yin, the qi of *Kan*, their color black, their form like a round stone. Their spirit resembles a white deer with two heads, transforming into a jade youth, one foot in height, entering and exiting the kidney viscus. Its spirit is harmonious—human gentleness and compliance arise from the kidneys. To pacify its spirit, one must cultivate benevolence, generosity, and moistening care for all beings, nurturing essence, aligning with aspirations, and preserving life—thus aligning with the Great Clarity.

The kidneys govern the bones and teeth above. Toothache signifies kidney damage. They also govern the ears. Bone pain reveals kidney deficiency; hearing loss, kidney depletion. Sensitive teeth mark kidney deficiency; blackened teeth, kidney wind. Ear pain indicates kidney qi congestion. Inability to straighten the waist signifies frozen kidneys. A yellowish hue marks kidney decline. A complexion with purple radiance shows the kidneys harbor no malignance. Creaking bones reveal kidney emaciation.

The kidneys govern the *yu* note, so for kidney ailments, employ *chui*. *Chui* is the kidney’s qi, capable of extracting kidney illnesses. When stagnant qi surges into the chest, forceful *chui* dispels it. If kidney qi is sluggish, prolonged *chui* restores flow.

Moreover, the kidneys preside over winter. During winter’s three months, heaven and earth’s qi seals, the myriad beings lie dormant. One retires at *xu* and rises at *yin*, aligning with the Dark Yin, outer Yin and inner Yang, to nourish bones and teeth and regulate the spirit. Opposing it harms the kidneys. Regularly, in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth lunar months, face north in level repose, sound the Golden Beam seven times, sip jade spring thrice, and inhale the black qi of the Dark Palace, holding it in the mouth before swallowing to replenish the losses from *chui*, to recite the deer’s invocation, and to summon the jade youth’s offerings. Thus, kidney qi is enriched, spirit harmonized, body at ease—no malevolent forces can harm, and the Dao of longevity is attained.

The Gallbladder Chart

Formerly, the five viscera were named, with the gallbladder added to form the six bowels. The gallbladder also receives the water qi, sharing the Dao with Kan. When the gallbladder is afflicted, one should employ *xi* to purge, and inhalation to tonify.

Its diagram is already appended to the Liver Visceral Chart.

The gallbladder is the essence of metal and the qi of water. Its color is green, its form resembles a suspended gourd. Its spirit takes the shape of a turtle and serpent, transforming into a jade youth, one foot in length, brandishing a halberd in hand as it dashes through the gallbladder’s domain. Its spirit is courageous—human bravery arises from the gallbladder. To pacify its spirit, one must cease anger and avoid contention, aligning with benevolence and upholding righteousness. Thus, life is preserved whole.

The gallbladder pairs with the bladder and governs the hair above. When hair withers, the gallbladder is depleted. When hair is dry, the gallbladder harbors wind. Those without fear possess a vast and great gallbladder. A complexion with a greenish luster indicates no other gallbladder malady. Dry nails signify gallbladder deficiency. Frayed hair denotes gallbladder heat. Spontaneous tears without cause reveal gallbladder taxation. A preference for sourness indicates gallbladder insufficiency.

The gallbladder resides in the Kan Palace, enabling one to observe wisdom, admire goodness, cast aside deceit, and reject flattery, thereby governing uprightness. Moreover, the gallbladder is born of metal, and metal is born of martiality—hence its abundance of courage. Yet restraining it brings great fortune.

The gallbladder rides the qi of Yin and holds the essence of metal, thus presiding over execution. Execution engenders sorrow, for metal is born of water, and tears fall from the eyes. The heart governs fire, the gallbladder governs water; fire governs acridity, water governs bitterness. Thus, when people suffer hardship, they speak of "bitter toil." This arises from the opposition of water and fire: fire is scorched by water, Yin and Yang contend, and water overcomes fire. Hence, tears overflow—bitter and flowing—thus named *lu*. The cries of sorrow and weeping are termed "bitter" because *lu* issues from the gallbladder, and bitterness becomes its expression.

The gallbladder is water and governs Yin; the eyes are bright and govern Yang. Yin follows Yang, thus tears emerge from the eyes.

Regularly, at the start of the first lunar month, sit upright in contemplation, face north, and inhale the black qi of the Dark Palace nine times, holding it in the mouth before swallowing to replenish the losses from *xi*. Consume the flavors of turtle and serpent, drink the nectar of the jade youth—thus, spirit is governed, the body harmonized, no misfortune can assail, and no evil dares approach, for the gallbladder’s qi prevails.

Ordinary and foolish people, who disbelieve in the profound and mysterious, slander the true principle—how lamentable! They bring ruin upon themselves. Yet if even one person possesses gallbladder qi and encounters extraordinary spirits or uncanny apparitions, their glaring eyes and gritted teeth, their strong spirit and steadfast gallbladder, will surely subdue the netherworld’s spirits. Is this not the work of divine qi? Why then disbelief?

Generally, tapping the teeth serves as drainage. Another method states that holding the breath and rinsing with spring water tonifies and benefits the essence of the six bowels—this too is drainage, not merely the mysterious breath alone.

The Yellow Emperor knelt to receive the teaching, tears streaming, kowtowing and bowing his head. He addressed the Supreme Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning: "I reverently uphold the profound and wondrous decree. Who could have foreseen that this mortal would encounter such a prior convergence? Raising my impoverished bones from eons of obscurity, I carve my flesh and pulverize my bones, yet can never repay the sagely grace. I shall treasure it within my breast—through heaven and earth’s enduring span, I dare not forget."

The Celestial Venerable said: "You possess the bones of an immortal. I transmit this arcane essential to repay my favor—do not recklessly impart it to the unenlightened."

The Yellow Emperor reverently received the august decree and dared not disobey its transmission.

Qibo said: "Humans receive the qi of heaven and earth to live. The arrival of qi is called essence; the union of essence is called numen; the transformation of numen is called spirit; the evolution of spirit is called soul; the soul’s comings and goings are called consciousness; the entry and exit of essence are called corporeal soul; the governance of essence and corporeal soul is called heart; the heart’s inclination is called emotion; emotion’s attachment is called intent; intent’s direction is called will; will’s contemplation is called thought; thought’s distant yearning is called consideration; consideration’s application is called wisdom. Wisdom encompasses all these manifestations—the workings of spirit, soul, corporeal soul, intent, will, thought, consideration, emotion, wisdom, and perception."

Baopuzi said: "The human form embodies the image of heaven and earth. Within the body, the chest and flanks are palaces, the four limbs are outskirts, the head is round like heaven, the feet are square like earth, the left eye is the sun, the right eye the moon, hair is the stars, teeth are gold and jade, the large intestine is the rivers, the small intestine the streams, the two breasts, navel, and knees are the Five Peaks, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, lungs, and heart are the Five Phases. Thus, those who cultivate the Dao must constantly regulate them. Without cultivation and repair, ruin and decay inevitably follow: the constructive and defensive qi fail to circulate, blood and qi stagnate, teeth and hair weaken, the five viscera fall into disharmony—then collapse and transformation ensue. Therefore, the perfected person repairs what is broken and governs what is free of illness."

The Yellow Emperor said: "Each of the five viscera in a person has its spirit and palace. Cultivating the Dao, refining qi, and preserving spirit—casting off evil and returning to the true—thus the upright Dao is made manifest."

The *Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning’s Supreme Mystery True Scripture* states: "Joy and anger harm one’s nature; sorrow and delight injure the spirit. Nature harmed, life is impaired; spirit injured, destiny is encroached. When qi is whole and the body balanced, spirit is at peace and form at ease—this is the secret to preserving life."

Here ends the *Supreme Clarity Yellow Court Scripture of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels True Persons’ Jade Axis*.
