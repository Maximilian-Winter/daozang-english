**Ritual of the Three Caverns True Scriptures: Five Methods of the Rectified One Alliance-Oath Talisman’s Established Rites**
*Composed by Zhang Wanfu, a Disciple of the Three Caverns*

All who perform the *jiào* ritual do so to offer sincerity to Heaven and Earth, and to pray for blessings from the numinous spirits. If one is not wholly devoted, one cannot hope to move them. If one’s sincerity is not absolute, yet still expects a response—such a thing has never been heard. Those who cultivate must exhaust their sincerity.

As for the ritual setup, a named mountain or cavern is ideal. If not, then a secluded, quiet place will suffice for arranging the implements and seats. The offerings must be fresh and abundant. In mountain caverns where mats are unavailable, use grass or leaves instead. The ritual cloths must be scrupulously clean, both inside and out, free from contamination by dogs, rats, or livestock. Avoid unclean meats and greasy foods, and refrain from ascending or touching the altar, or from shouting or scolding—whether to elders or juniors.

The offerings must be prepared as in the *zhāi* fast, though common folk, unaware of subtleties, may dismiss even wine and preserved meats as insufficient. Indeed, the Dao’s methods are pure and refined; they especially abhor filth and impurity. The stars, constellations, and sacred peaks are all domains of the true immortals. To ignore their origins and blindly follow false teachings—such errors are grievous indeed! To know the labors of the sage and yet mock them with vulgar laughter—how lamentable!

---
**First: Establishing the Altar and Seats**
The Dao’s spirits are formless; only the utmost sincerity can move them. The numinous souls are without manifestation, yet they must be invoked with proper rites. Those who practice must erect the altar and arrange the seats to invite blessings.

The altar shall follow the *Lingbao* method of summoning the true, opening the five gates—East, West, South, North, and the Celestial Sovereign—each spanning twenty-four feet, with railings as prescribed. Why? The Three Caverns’ teachings place *Dongxuan* at the center, and thus its rites are used to harmonize above and below.

Once the altar is erected, place the *Shangqing* seat in the center, slightly forward-facing south, draped with a green-and-purple patterned cloth. Open the talisman and place it upon the seat, with three trays before it: one divided into nine parts, one into six, and three lamp stands—one tray divided into one part—totaling sixteen divisions and sixteen cups, with three incense burners.

Next, to the north and near the west, place the *Liujia* (Six Celestial Stems) seats, facing south, draped with a crimson cloth. Open the talisman and arrange the seat, with six trays before it: each divided into one part, one incense burner, six cups, and one lamp.

Next, at the eastern end, place the *Sanhuang* (Three Sovereigns) seats, facing south, draped with a green cloth. Open the talisman and arrange the seats—*East Heaven Sovereign, Earth Sovereign, and Human Sovereign*—with three trays before them: each divided into one part, three incense burners, three cups, and three lamps.

Next, to the east and facing north, place the *Five Sacred Peaks True Forms Diagram*, facing west, draped with a crimson cloth. Arrange the talisman-diagram upon the seat, with three trays before it:
- The nearest tray to the north, divided into five parts, for the *Five Peak Lords*;
- The next tray to the south, divided into two parts, for the *Assisting Command Lords*;
- The *Qingcheng-Lushan Envoys* seat, with three trays divided into nine parts.
Total: nine cups, four lamps, and four incense burners.

Next, to the south, place the *Five Talisman Seats*, facing west, draped with a cloth. Arrange the talismans upon the seats, with three trays before them, each divided into one part. Place a separate mat with a black cloth slightly forward, or on another seat:
- *Renwu Mountain Seat*: one tray, one cup, one incense burner, one lamp.
- The next two trays: the *True Scripture Five Talismans Eight Scenes Inner Sounds Seats*, each divided into five parts, totaling ten parts, ten cups, one incense burner, and one lamp.

Next, to the south, place the *Alliance-Oath Seat*, facing east, draped with a crimson cloth. Arrange the talisman upon the seat, with three trays before it:
- Each tray divided into eight parts, totaling twenty-four parts, with twenty-four cups (or twelve, or eight, or three, as the method dictates), one incense burner, and one lamp.

Next, to the north, place the *East and West Two Prohibition Seats*, facing east, draped with a green cloth. Arrange the talismans upon the seats, with three trays before them:
- The nearest tray to the north, divided into one part, for the *West Peak Lord*;
- The next tray to the south, divided into one part, for the *Central Yellow Taiyi*;
- The next tray to the west, divided into four parts, for the *Four Spirit Lords*.
Total: three trays, sixteen parts (or six trays, three parts), two incense burners, and two lamps.

If the *Seven Stars* are being invoked, place their seats within the altar, behind the *Shangqing* and before the *Liujia*, facing south, draped with a purple cloth, with seven trays: each divided into one part, seven cups, one incense burner, and one lamp. Even if not invoked, this seat must still be arranged.

The *Hetu* (River Diagram) may also be placed behind the *Shangqing* and before the *Sanhuang*, draped with a green cloth, facing south, with one tray divided into nine parts, one incense burner, nine cups, and one lamp.

After the ritual, place the *zhènxìn* (ritual purity offerings: salt, pickled vegetables, rice, etc.) before the *Shangqing* seat, slightly to the east on a small mat.

If a teacher is present, the arrangement must be as described. The incense, lamps, and *zhènxìn* offerings must all conform to the rites. If possible, each seat should have its own table, draped with a clean cloth, and the talismans placed upon them—this is even better. Each altar must be surrounded by a crimson rope barrier on all four sides. If rope is unavailable, use ash or wheat bran instead. To help the numinous souls focus, a clean curtain may be hung around the altar to prevent the incense smoke and lamps from scattering.

**Purification of the Altar and Cleansing of Impurities (Second Section)**

The purpose of purifying the altar is to dispel the lingering *qi* of defilement, to perfume and honor the numinous souls, so that the inner and outer spaces may be cleansed and harmonized, and both humanity and the divine may be moved.

For all rituals that begin, this method must be followed—it is not limited to this alone.

Previously, the *Xiangwang* scripture (the "King of Incense" text) was inscribed on paper to dispel impurities. The water was prepared with peach bark, bamboo leaves, *chénxiāng* (aloewood), *jīshé* (chicken tongue herb, *Houttuynia cordata*), and *xiāngbǎi* (sweet osmanthus) leaves, finely chopped and boiled in a silk pouch filled with water, then sprinkled over the altar and all ritual objects, and used for bathing as well.

Alternatively, pure spring water or fresh water may also be employed.

Following the previous chapter’s arrangement, after the water has been spread, the practitioner dons the prescribed ritual attire and sprinkles *jiànshuǐ* (sword-water) upon the earthen doorway. The sword is applied first, then the water, with each three steps apart. Upon beginning the invocation, the steps are taken in the manner of the *Three Powers* (Heaven, Earth, and Humanity).

After completing the steps, the practitioner clenches their fists, closes their eyes, and mentally invokes the presence of the *Scriptures, Registers, and Degrees of the Master* to the west, the *Tang General* (唐将军) and his mounted troops, bearing sword and seal, to the left, the *Ge General* (葛将军) and his troops, wielding halberds and bearing swords, to the right, and the *Zhou General* (周将军) and his troops, holding scepters, to the front. The *Zhenren* (True Person) descends in crimson robes, riding the *Nine Phoenix*, stepping through the *Dǒu* (ritual step formation) to receive the impurities.

The *Seven Stars* (七星) cover the practitioner’s body, with the head raised and the fingers pointing forward, not shielding the eyes.

When complete, the practitioner opens their eyes and recites the **Incantation of the Four Spirits** (四灵咒):

**Incantation of the Four Spirits:**

*"Chant to be inserted here."*

The **Eastern Azure Dragon** (East方青龙), whose essence is the brilliance of the Horn and Tail constellations (角亢之精), likewise follows the usual method.

When complete, the practitioner presses their hands to their heart, standing in the **Dingzi posture** (丁字立), and recites the incantation as follows:

*"I summon the hundred spirits—now that they have assembled,
I shall traverse the clouds—then proceed with the **Three Talents Steps** (三才步).
Next, I command the waters of the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Hai rivers,
which are not ordinary waters—
I spit water once (乃噀水一下),
and chant to absorb it three times (唱摄三下).
Then, having invoked the names, I solemnly request the **Eastern Azure Dragon** (东方青龙),
to descend with **true qi** (真气) into my body—
as it is.

Next, I perform the **Three Talents Steps, Nine Phases, or the Completed Hexagram** (九迹或既济卦).
Then I request the **Five Pure Boy Lords** (五童君), and the rest follows the usual method.

Next, I perform the **Seven Stars Firm Steps** (七星刚步), and place the water bowl (水椀) to completion.

Upon entering the gate, the **Third Invocation** (入户祝) is chanted:
*"Four Heavenly Functionaries* (四上功曹),
*Dragon-Tiger Envoys* (龙虎使者),
*True One of the Three Talents* (正一生炁),
*Attendant of the Pure and Silent Maiden* (侍静素女),
those who appear at night—
I beseech the **Bright Clarity Pure Boy** (开明童子)
and the **Supreme Mystic Maiden** (上玄少女)
to enter with me into the **Yellow Palace’s embrace** (黄宫之裹),
to traverse and fulfill all that is summoned,
and to make it heard above.

When done, I enter and circle the altar once,
then face west-north and stand where the **initiated** (事人) are positioned.
The remaining **palace attendants** (宫男) take their places facing east,
first offering incense to all the seats,
then offering the **Invocation of Announcement** (启告香) incense.
Next, I chant—
each bows to the Master and meditates as prescribed.
Then I meditate on the **Three Masters** (三师) as usual.

The **Fourth Invocation** (发炉第四) is chanted:
*"Rumble the sacred drum thirty-six times* (吒法鼓三十六通).
To the **Supreme Three Heavens, Primordial Beginning, Three Talents, and the Venerable Lord Lao** (无上三天玄元始三炁太上老君),
I summon from my body the **Thirty-six Heavenly Functionaries** (三五功曹),
the **Left and Right Official Envoys** (左右官使者),
those who bear incense on the **Left and Right** (左右捧香),
the **Stationary Dragon and Mounted Messenger** (驿龙骑吏),
the **Golden Boy Attendant of Incense** (侍香金童),
the **Jade Maiden Scattering Flowers** (散花玉女),
the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans** (五帝直符),
and the **Directing Day Incense Officials** (直日香官),
all thirty-six in number, to depart from the gate (出关),
and I summon the **State and County Earthly Deities, Local Domain Officials, and True Gods** (启州县土地里域真官正神).
I now properly burn incense and establish the **rites of purification** (设醮),
wishing the **Ten Directions’ True Gods of the Three Talents** (十方正真生炁) to descend and flow into my body,
so that all that is summoned may swiftly reach and directly ascend to the **Jade Emperor of the Three Pure Ones** (三清玉帝) at the **True Virtue’s few** (至真几) before me.
Next, I present the **Supplication of Appeal** (上奏按香),
and all the officials bow twice (再拜).*

Then the **Fifth Invocation** (出灵官第五) is chanted.

Long kneeling, striking the teeth twenty-four times.

Your servant, **Certain** (臣某),
through seven generations of accumulated **virtue** (积德),
now rejoices in this present life (庆及今生).
From youth, I have aspired to the **Dao** (慕道),
my thoughts ever seeking the **wonderful methods** (妙法).
With a **pure and austere resolve** (洁志清严),
I submit to the **Master’s Gate** (归命师门),
and with **diligent reverence and humility** (勤求俛仰),
I seek to attain the **door of Certain Lord** (以诣某君门下),
to receive the **precious scriptures** (宝经),
**celestial texts** (天书),
**jade characters** (玉字),
**talismans and diagrams** (符图),
**essential keys** (要诀),
and **inner and outer ritual ordinations** (内外治箓).
I wear the **auspicious tokens** (佩服),
preserve the **forms of the body** (身形),
and diligently practice **offerings and nourishment** (供养),
yet have not yet attained the **True Spirits** (未契真灵).

On this auspicious day and favorable occasion (今吉日良会),
after **bathing and purifying with incense** (沐浴熏修),
I **spread out the ritual seat** (敷陈法座)
and **offer fragrant delicacies** (施设芳馔),
to **invite and present the True Spirits** (启荐真灵).

I humbly pray that the **Venerable Sages** (大圣众尊),
may **return to their cloud-borne carriages** (回云驾),
and **condescend to accept my offerings** (俯垂采纳),
to **illuminate my mortal sentiments** (鉴映凡情),
and **examine what I have spoken** (省理所言),
thus **bestowing blessings and granting fortune** (留恩降福).

I, your humble servant, prostrate myself with two bows.
**Three times offering incense.**
**Three times offering water.**

Your servant, with utmost reverence, now humbly presents this petition:

The Great Dao is subtle and wondrous,
its divine functions boundless.
It inhales and exhales yin and yang,
giving birth and nurturing all things.
All beings with form
are born of the Dao,
nourished and perfected,
as a mother bears her child.
All things that return to it
are in communion with its power.

I humbly pray to the Most High and the Venerable Sages,
that in their compassion for those with sincere hearts,
they grant me the blessing of enlightenment.

If my seven generations of ancestors
have committed great sins—
transgressing laws and taboos,
defiling heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stars,
or blaspheming gods and spirits,
reviling the True Spirits,
slandering scriptures and the Dao,
oppressing the weak and deceiving the poor,
their threefold karma and six senses
filled with arrogance and disrespect toward elders,
committing murder and theft,
countless crimes and offenses—
I beseech the boundless mercy of the Great Forgiveness,
that all seven generations of my ancestors,
their souls now transformed,
may be universally pardoned,
freed from the nether realms,
transcending to blessed lands,
refining in the Southern Palace,
achieving Daoist perfection,
ascending to the Nine Heavens,
and dwelling in effortless freedom.

My own deep-rooted karma has brought me grave illness and misfortune,
yet my diseases fade unseen,
all calamities vanish,
evil schemes and malevolent spirits,
all banished—
my celestial blessings everlasting,
joy and fortune boundless.

Together with my master and fellow practitioners,
and my kin and relatives,
may we all attain longevity,
our lives steadfast and auspicious.

I pray that my heart may be illuminated with clarity,
my wisdom perfected and boundless,
that the True Saints may secretly guide me,
the spirits descend to meet me,
that noble teachers and kindred friends
will appear without seeking,
that elixirs of jade and gold
will come naturally,
that the Way may be practiced and attained,
that immortality may be sought and found,
that my intentions align with my heart,
and all my endeavors succeed.

I, your servant, prostrate myself with two bows.
**Three times offering incense.**
**Three times offering water.**

Your servant, **prostrate with two bows**, respectfully and solemnly presents this petition to the Most Exalted and Revered Celestial Worthies, the Most Venerable and Divine Saints, the Three Caverns of Divine Truth, and the Four Directors and Five Emperors.

By the grace of fate, the deep kindness of past lives has endured, and through the nine heavens’ calamities, its blessings now extend to this humble body. Encountering the auspicious era of the Way’s flourishing, I have been granted the opportunity to partake in the sacred texts, the lofty and secret scriptures, and the talismans and diagrams of the Three Caverns.

Since my first, unworthy contact with these teachings, I have revered the Most High and True Ones, my heart yearning for the divine, yet my devotion remains shallow and insufficient. I fear not being able to move the spirits, and thus dread that my sinful self may sink into filth and decay, lost forever in the nine depths.

But the Heavenly Mercy is vast and boundless, its efficacy ever-present. With a heart steadfast in sincerity and a will of infinite resolve, I now humbly lay forth my ten thousand wishes, my mind clear and my gratitude sincere, revealing both old and new vows.

I pray that the Most Venerable and Exalted Saints, the Noble Masters, and the Most True Heavenly Worthies may, in their infinite grace, look down upon this lowly one. I am deeply ashamed and fearful, not daring to rest in ease, for the Heavenly Light shines far and wide, illuminating even the most hidden places. With my heart laid bare, I present this petition, boldly offering it for your consideration.

I beg for the talismans and sacred scriptures of the True Ones, and for divine spirits to guard and protect me, that I may ascend mountains and traverse dangers, move through forests and ravines, and that all my requests and aspirations may be fulfilled as I speak.

May the Way’s mysteries be revealed, and the divine intelligences converge; may my ten thousand wishes be realized in my heart.

Let me gather the elixir herbs and medicines without concealment.
Let mountain spirits submit and hide themselves, never interfering in my trials.
Let poisonous beasts and venomous creatures never harm this body.
Let celestial youths and jade maidens attend me, east and west.

May all the spirits of **qi** descend into my form, calming the five viscera, granting clarity within and without, opening my mind and awakening my understanding, enabling me to foresee fortune and misfortune, and may the Three Corpses be banished, the Nine Parasites never take root. May my body bear divine markings, and I soon attain the state of the **Saints**.

Only through the grace of the Most Exalted and Great Emperors and True Worthies, who bestow blessings and mercy, may their favor flow down to all the common folk, granting me the fulfillment of my prayers. I am overwhelmed by their boundless kindness and will strive to repay it.

Your servant, **prostrate with two bows**, is sincerely awestruck and trembling.

**Three times offering incense.**
**Three times offering water.**

**Ritual for Escorting the True Spirit (7th True Ritual)**

Your servant, **prostrate with two bows**, humbly states:
The Most Exalted Spirit has labored to descend from the heights and enter the profane realm below, yet has been burdened by my meager offerings of food and drink, and my crude words and simple reasoning. I have long delayed the True Ritual’s observance, and my guilt is boundless.

Now the **cloud-chariot** is prepared, and the path has been cleared. I pray that the Most Exalted Spirit may return and ascend to the **Golden Gate**.

Unworthy as I am, I beg for the grace to be permitted to ride the chariot and ascend. I humbly await Your boundless mercy.

Your servant, **sincerely awestruck and trembling**, **prostrates with two bows**.

**Four times offering incense and water, and presenting the sacrificial offerings of the jiao ritual.**
**Collecting the dharma talismans and position tablets, then commanding the minor spirit officials.**

**Commanding the Minor Spirit Officials (8th True Ritual)**

The hierarchy of high and low, the order of human and divine—all must follow proper paths, without error or excess. The sequence must be respected.

Now that the Most Exalted Spirit has ascended, all those who tend, guard, and serve—including the **True Officials of the Land** and the **soldiers and officers within my body**, who wield talismans and diagrams—though their ranks are low and duties minor, have not yet participated in the **Dharma Seat**. I pray that each may be assigned their proper station, according to their rank, and receive my humble words.

**Offering incense.**
**Offering water.**

**Humbly praying that the Celestial Chariot be properly guided, I dare not delay it further.**

May it be that after the Most Exalted’s descent, each return to their proper duties, as usual, guarding and protecting, bestowing blessings and warding off calamities, leaving behind grace and spreading virtue.

The **Jade Boys and Jade Girls** who attend the scriptures, the **Left and Right Jade Officers**, along with the **True Officials** entrusted to me—may they each take their appointed stations, united in heart and body with me, moving and resting without separation.

Should there be disasters, dangers, or afflictions—spirit vexation, qi confusion, or breach of oath—then the officers and soldiers shall bear the first blame. The **Mysterious Laws and Ritual Codes** are strict; the penalty is not light. The spirits must take heed.

**Dispersing incense and water.**

**The Inner Officials (9th True Ritual)**

Having completed the *jiao* ritual, I now summon the **Five-Body True Officials** of my origin, the **Three-Cavern Jade Officers**, and all **Spiritual Cavalry**—may they return to my body, each taking their proper station: left to the left, right to the right. May they sit in tranquility within the **Golden Hall and Jade Chamber**, preserving the **vital essence** and **perfecting the True**. Only when I later summon them forth again shall they emerge, as in past practice. I remain in silent meditation for a long while, striking my teeth three times, visualizing the spirits, and they return to my body in perfect harmony—like soldiers of a state returning to their barracks, all still and serene—before the incense burner is extinguished.

**Extinguishing the Incense Burner (10th True Ritual)**

From this point onward, the chapter shall be recited in a high, level tone, as in the *zhai* ritual.

The **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon and Tiger Lords**, and the **Attending Spirit Officials of Incense**—at this moment of altar stillness, the **Golden Pillars and Jade Flowers** shall naturally manifest.

I, [Name], having sought the Dao and attained it, having sought immortality and attained it, with the **Seven Ancestors and Three Teachers** all granted ascension—now bathed in the **Mysterious Grace**—pray that the **Ten-Directional Immortal Boys and Girls** attend the incense smoke, swiftly conveying my petitions to the **Three-Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Formless, Nameless, Supreme Primordial Emperor**.

**The Hymn for Sending the Spirits (11th True Ritual)**

Vast and boundless, without form,
Yet moved by the emotions of the living.
With reverence, blessings descend from heaven;
With transgression, demons are drawn near.
Fortune and misfortune arise with fate;
Prosperity and adversity follow their causes.
The Dao does not value jade and pearls;
The spirits fear only sincerity of heart.
Enduring toil in refining elixirs,
I pour forth my earnest devotion.
Naturally communing with the Great Saints,
All descend with enlightened grace.
With incense in hand, I present my wishes,
Bowing in hope of virtuous approval.

The Celestial Sovereign abides in eternal stillness,
Turning the heart toward the boundless void.

Upon completion, the disciple of immortality descends from the altar, as is customary.

**The Doorway Blessing (12th True Ritual)**

The **Supreme Dark Principle**, the **Eight Windows of Light** now open.
What was petitioned has been communicated to the **Spirit of the Maiden**.
The rites now concluded, all spirits return to their stations,
And the myriad spirits rest in hidden tranquility.

**Taboos After the Jiao Ritual (13th True Ritual)**

The ritual food may be given to **worthy men, Daoists**, but not to **common, impure folk**—especially not to **filial sons or women**, who are strictly forbidden. Nor should it be given to ordinary people as alms. According to ancient law, it must be cast into **long-flowing waters** or buried in the earth.

Do not drink alcohol—it disturbs the *qi*;
Do not eat the **Five Spices**—it clouds the mind;
Do not share meals with others—it mixes the *qi*;
Do not gaze upon the dead or living—it pollutes the *qi*;
Do not be angry—it scatters the *qi*;
Do not grieve—it harms the spirit;
Do not see blood—it defiles the *qi*.

The **Seven Precepts** above must be observed for seven days, or at least fourteen—though forty-nine days would be ideal. These prohibitions apply not only after the *jiao* but are also strictly observed by **all Daoist practitioners**.

All items procured for the *jiao* must be fresh, abundant, and pure—free of holes, cracks, or filth. They must not be purchased through bargaining or buried for profit. Impure items are unfit for ritual use, such as **sugarcane, taro, or medicinal herbs**—though **ginseng or poria** are permitted, as these are sacred substances nurtured by spirits. When preparing them, one must first bathe in purity, cleanse the utensils and tools with incense, and avoid loud speech, anger (great or small), or mingling with outsiders.

If unable to prepare them oneself, one must seek a **ritual cook**, who must first be instructed to bathe, change into clean clothes, and oversee the preparation personally.
