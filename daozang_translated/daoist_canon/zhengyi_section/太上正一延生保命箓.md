The *Supreme Orthodox Unity Register for Prolonging Life and Preserving Destiny*

According to the native place and official position of the faithful Daoist devotee [Name], born in the year, month, day, and hour of [Birth Details], under the celestial governance of the Star Lord of the Northern Dipper [Specific Star], it is humbly stated:

Having long borne within myself the divine *qi* of the Supreme High Emperor Wang, yet unable to discern its workings, I now sincerely confess before the Dao: summoned by the Three *Qi* Lords, I today reverently present ritual offerings and, with bowed head, approach the gate of the Heavenly Master of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, successor of the Han, to receive the *Supreme Orthodox Unity Register for Prolonging Life and Preserving Destiny* of the first rank. Through cultivating the body and refining the self, I seek to preserve my destiny and shield my person, transcend a thousand calamities, dispel ten thousand evils, prolong my years, and augment my allotted span. Should I violate the precepts and covenants, may I suffer immediate harm. I humbly pray that the primordial grace of the Great Dao bestow its aid, augment my spiritual vitality, and circulate the true *qi*, bringing blessings to all beings. May my seven ancestors and nine generations alike be delivered and uplifted. By inscribing talismans and consecrating water, I shall heal the sick and succor the perilous, placing others before myself, bestowing without expectation of reward, and accomplishing without self-aggrandizement. Through such conduct, the Dao shall swiftly manifest.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees descended from the Supreme Orthodox Unity!

The Most High Lord Lao, upon the Three Heavens of Primordial Origin, together with the perfected and sagely deities of the ten directions, the Celestial Worthies of Longevity, Life-Preservation, and Body-Protection, and the host of attained immortals—true immortals, flying immortals, merciful deliverers from distress, those who respond to cries for aid, those who rescue the living and ferry the dead, and the myriad-fortune guardians of the body—surveyed the world and beheld men and women, each beset by the three disasters and nine calamities, the ten sufferings and eight hardships, encountering misfortune and meeting with woe, without means to expiate or avert them. Sinking into the three lower realms, adrift among the six destinies, they were forever consigned to hell.

The Celestial Worthy, witnessing this, took pity on all beings and taught the method of expiating transgressions, rescuing the living and ferrying the dead, that they might escape the torments of sin. Should any man or woman be afflicted by the pestilential poisons of the Six Heavens, by water or fire, bandits or thieves, serpents or tigers, demons or malevolent spirits, by the curses of wicked persons, or by the cumulative misfortunes of karmic retribution, or the illnesses wrought by the five earthly influences, let their household unite in heart to perform the fast, establish an altar, and array incense, flowers, lamps, and candles. Let them invite a Daoist priest of the Three Caverns to burn incense, perform the Dao, recite scriptures, and wear the register, cultivating in accordance with the proper method. Thereby, all disasters and misfortunes shall be forever dissolved.

On the ten auspicious days, the eight solar terms, the Three Primordials, one’s own natal day, and the birthdays of one’s parents, let them perform the fast and wear the register to safeguard their household. Thus shall they receive the descent of great divine power, preserving their destiny and protecting their person. Should one’s original destiny be afflicted by the six harms or ten evils, let them perform the fast and wear the register, and they shall dispel calamities and eradicate misfortune, preserving their destiny and protecting their person. Should one’s parents, spouse, or partner have passed away, let them perform the fast and wear the register with the aspiration that their departed kin ascend to heaven. Thus shall they deliver the deceased from distress and protect the living. Should one’s original destiny be afflicted by the six harms or the baleful *qi* of death, let them perform the fast and wear the register, and they shall dissolve harm, extinguish demonic influences, and remain free from disaster, hardship, and unexpiated sins, preserving their destiny and protecting their person, forever attaining purity.

The immortals and true clerks shall guard and protect their persons, their names inscribed upon golden tablets, enabling them to attain longevity. Their seven generations of ancestors shall ascend, their positions elevated among the heavenly beings. Let them diligently observe and uphold this.

The disciple [Name] hereby presents sincerity and faith, respectfully approaching the gate of the Heavenly Master, to receive the *Tai Shang Zheng Yi Yan Sheng Bao Ming Lu* of the first rank. I vow to cultivate and uphold it, never daring to treat the sacred script lightly. Should I violate this, I willingly accept the judgments of the unseen realm, never blaming the Dao or faulting my master, in accordance with the mysterious statutes and ordinances.

**Method for Requesting the Register**

**Prayer for Requesting the *Tai Shang Zheng Yi Yan Sheng Bao Ming Lu*:**

On this day, month, and year of [Date], I, [Name], a Daoist believer residing in [Place], humbly state: Born on [Birth Date and Hour], my life is governed by the oversight of the [Specific] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper. Today, I respectfully present ritual offerings and bow my head, reverently approaching the gate of the Heavenly Master of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, Successor to the Han, to receive the *Tai Shang Zheng Yi Yan Sheng Bao Ming Lu* of the first rank.

I reflect that the Dao bestows form, and the hundred spirits silently attend within the *niwan* (mud-pellet palace). Heaven endows the body, and the myriad *qi* collectively sustain the jade chamber. Cultivating correctness, the numinous and the hidden mutually assist; succumbing to delusion, calamities and harms assail from all sides. The majesty of the body’s radiance ensures that destiny does not await protection to protect itself. Receiving the celestial register and its methods, the spirits, though not consciously preserved, are silently preserved. Extending blessings and prolonging years, the self-inflicted demonic afflictions are dispelled. Abiding in constant purity and stillness, one safeguards the auspiciousness of ultimate cessation. Having beheld the compassionate light, I reverently adhere to the solemn precepts. I am utterly sincere in my supplication. Respectfully, this prayer.

At the gate of the Heavenly Master, the disciple [Name] presents sincerity and faith, approaching the Dao to declare the request for the *Tai Shang Zheng Yi Yan Sheng Bao Ming Lu* of the first rank, and to seek the sacred name of the true master for lifelong reverence. Today, based on the submitted prayer, I swear an oath before Heaven and Earth, pledge before the Three Officials, break the contract and divide the ring, and transmit and confer the register in accordance with the statutes. As follows:

**Officiating Master’s Dharma Name**
**Witnessing Master**
**Oath-Swearing Master**

**Supervising Transmission Master**  
**Recommending Master**

The Orthodox Master of the Celestial Masters, Zhengying, declares: The profound words of the Mystic Sages and the secret writs of the Heavenly Perfected serve to sustain the declining and deliver the distressed. One must recognize the numinous power of the Three Primes’ Flowery Canopy, which preserves life and prolongs existence—this is what is meant by the Register of the Five Dipper’s Concealing the Body. Its resonance is effortlessly efficacious, its blessings and benefits boundless. Thus did the Most High establish the teachings, transmitting them as a worldly learning. Thereupon, successive generations of Perfected Masters upheld and proclaimed the precious instructions, drawing in those with karmic affinity, their lineage unbroken through the ages.

By virtue of my ancestral blessings, I have borne the grace of the state through the generations, inheriting the transmission of the Orthodox Unity lineage and reviving the ancestral thread of the Heavenly Eye. Yet as the transmission of the Dharma Registers and the succession of generations grow ever more distant, I have selected skilled artisans to carve wood into books, ensuring the perpetuation of their legacy.

As for the observance of precepts and the cultivation of compassion, from ancient times to the present, all perfected beings have acted thus. Those who ascend the altar as devout believers must purify their inner vision, accumulate merit through virtuous deeds, and thereby fulfill their vows, transcending the mundane to enter the wondrous. The covenant thus illuminated—how could one not be vigilant?

The Celestial Master, Guangwei Zi, declares: For over fifteen hundred years, my family has employed the talismans and registers of the Most High to deliver beings across heaven and earth, safeguarding the nation’s destiny. The ancestral teachings are resplendently clear—what need is there for superfluous praise?

When my predecessor, the Perfected Lord, encountered the sagely dynasty’s unification of the realm, he was first to receive veneration. The cap-and-robe-clad of Jiangnan were all placed under his jurisdiction. Since I inherited the teaching, the imperial courts of three reigns have bestowed their radiant favor upon me. At the ascension of the dragon-throne, I was honored with a special edict of exalted titles, my reverence likened to that of Xu Jing, my solemnity compared to the harmony of Chonghe. Official ranks were conferred following the precedents of the Tang, while enfeoffment and advancement of territory followed the model of the Liu state.

In performing good deeds and transmitting talismans and registers, I carry forward the ancestral legacy. In praying for blessings and averting calamities for the people, I reverently uphold the sagely instructions. In beseeching heaven for enduring mandate, how dare I not exert myself with utmost diligence? In transmitting registers and bestowing talismans, I further manifest the transformative power of the teachings—above, to requite the august mandate of the Son of Heaven’s illustrious decree; below, to extend the imperial favor of the Supreme Polaris to the common people. May I ever fulfill my timely devotion, thereby securing abundant fortune.

The Recommending Master of the Orthodox Unity Mystic Altar, holder of the Supreme Clarity Three Caverns Scripture Register, [Name], hereby recommends the devout believer [Name], who has received and vowed to wear the *Most High Orthodox Unity Register for Prolonging Life and Preserving Destiny*. Apart from the matters of the register already recorded at this altar, and the personal request made to the Orthodox Unity Succession Celestial Master Perfected Person to report to the Ancestral Celestial Master, the Orthodox Unity Perfected Person, for transmission according to the ritual statutes, this certificate is hereby issued as proof, that the recipient may adhere to the teachings and put them into practice. Should one violate this covenantal oath, one will incur the divine judgment of the Mystic Tribunal.
