**The Scripture of the Western Royal Mother’s Precious Spirit and Daily Practice**

Upon waking at night or rising at dawn, first close both eyes tightly. Then, click the teeth nine times, swallow saliva three times, and press the tongue against the throat. Next, shake the head and move the neck seven times. With the hands, press along the sides of the nostrils, moving up and down dozens of times on the left and right. When finished, softly recite the following invocation:

*"The Nine Heavens’ Supreme Emperor, the Three Origins’ Protector of Infants,
The Supreme One unfurls the flower, the Jade Chamber emits essence.
The Seven Gates summon the spirits, the Nine Chambers receive illumination.
Ears keen, eyes clear, penetrating the true and reaching the numinous.
The Heavenly Peak of the Central Realm, harmonizing qi and balancing equilibrium.
The Proud Maiden’s cloud-like bearing, the Eye Lad’s radiant brightness.
The Mystic Window gleams, the Hundred Portals shine.
Preserve harmony in the Upper Origin, wander the Golden Court.
The five viscera glow with splendor, ears and eyes ever renewed.
The Spirit Terrace stands towering, its pillars and beams unshaken.
The Seven Po dissolve and refine, the Three Hun rest in yellow tranquility.
The Supreme One takes my hand, walking beside me as one.
The Five Elders merge in unity, the Peerless assists and guards.
Myriad evils vanish, all wishes surely come to pass.
Sun and Moon stand guard at the gates, the heart dwells with the auspicious star.
As the Immortal Sovereign declares, the ten thousand spirits heed with reverence."*

Upon waking, always perform this pressing and invocation—never forget it. Though the true Dao may be attained, still practice this without fail.

This is the Supreme Highest Western Queen Mother’s *Precious Scripture on the Jade Arts of Rising and Resting*. It sharpens the ears and brightens the eyes, strengthens memory and clears the mind, harmonizes the breath within the nose so that no foul mucus arises, illuminates the Four Ministers and Eight Penetrations, and restores the complexion to youthful radiance. It governs the hun and records the po, repelling the ten thousand demons. This is the wondrous Dao of the Perfected One’s rising and resting.

The term “rising and resting” means that this practice should be performed regularly upon waking and before sleep. Additionally, one should rub the hands together until slightly warm and then massage the face and eyes as a daily habit, repeating this several times.

The Divine Mother says: When a person begins to age, wrinkles first appear beneath the eyes. When the body’s vitality declines and qi diminishes, it first manifests between the nostrils. These two areas are the doors and windows of wrinkles and decline, the passes and fords of qi and strength. Thus, regularly practicing this method wards off wrinkles and decline, preserving qi and strength in constant health and harmony.

The *Jade Scripture of Deathlessness* states:
Hands part the blossoming courtyard’s side,
Lingering to harmonize with Heavenly Perfection.
Above, enter the Spirit Gorge’s chamber,
Jade Valley fills the Celestial Mountain.
The inner source reveals the Mysterious Numinous,
The ten thousand demons self-destruct.
Eternal life without death,
Jade registers return to the Lord Emperor.
Through you, harmonize with Heavenly Perfection,
Press this secluded mountain source.

Heavenly Perfection resides between the eyebrows, at the inner corners of the brows—one fen below the ears is the upper chamber for drawing in the numinous. The mountain source lies beside the philtrum above the upper lip, slightly within the nostrils’ hollow—this is the gate that seals and extinguishes the ten thousand demons. The blossoming courtyard is below the eyebrows, at the center directly beneath them—this is the bridge for penetrating vision.

At dawn upon rising and at dusk before sleep, swiftly close both eyes, curl the tongue back toward the throat, and swallow saliva three times. Then, with urgency, press these three places nine times each, pressing inwardly without lifting the hands. Make this a constant practice, and it will grant long life without death, descending spirits and penetrating vision, sealing and extinguishing the path of the ten thousand ghosts.

After pressing the hands, softly recite the incantation:
Supreme Void Sovereign,
Open and scatter the Jade Court.
The Golden Chamber gleams radiant,
The Emerald Terrace stands lush and green.
I gather the Three Paths,
Extinguish demons and give birth to spirits.
I attain deathlessness,
And also transcend life.
Eternal life is free,
Reversing age to return to infancy.
Hun and po are refined,
The Five Spirits rest in peace.
The whirlwind’s chariot wheels turn,
Northward I visit Jade Clarity.
Ascending to the Great Origin,
I merge with the sun.
Thus I become a Perfected One,
The Lord Emperor unites in darkness.
Proclaimed by the Three Origins,
The ten thousand spirits heed with reverence.

During the reign of King Zhuang of Chu, there was a market chief named Song Yuanfu, a man of good heart who regularly swept the entire market himself. After some time, a beggar entered the market and stayed for a year. Each morning, he would beg while singing loudly:
The Heavenly Court births golden blossoms,
The inner source blocks yin evil.
Jade Valley joins the Mysterious Minister,
Jade qi mutually supports the web.
Heavenly Perfection stands above the sun,
Flying medicine spouts numinous wonders.
At dawn, press the Heavenly Steed,
Linger and drive to the Spirit’s Mysterious Home.
The Immortal enters the chamber,
And thus extinguishes the hundred demons.

Before leaving, he inscribed these words on the market gate. No one in the Chu market understood them, but Yuanfu suddenly grasped their meaning and suspected the beggar was an immortal—though he did not comprehend the song’s deeper import. He knelt and repeatedly entreated the beggar for instruction. After some time, the beggar said: “I am indeed a Perfected One. These words are the *Precious Song of Deathlessness* from the Kunlun Western Queen Mother. Those who know it transcend death.” He then transmitted the essential method and secret instructions to Yuanfu. After practicing for twenty years, Yuanfu ascended to heaven in broad daylight and now resides on the Dark Continent, where he holds the rank of Immortal Minister. The beggar in the Chu market was none other than the Perfected One of South Mountain, Red Pine.

At times, he divided his form and scattered his radiance, temporarily descending into the dust and filth to wander and observe the clamor, summoning and welcoming true encounters.

The *Divine Precious Scripture as Told by Perfected Lord Pei of Pure Emptiness* states: To seek the Dao, one must first make the eyes clear and the ears sharp, for these are the primary agents of all affairs. The ears and eyes are the ladder for seeking the Perfected and the gate for gathering the numinous. Success and failure depend on them, and life and death are determined by them. Now I transcribe this scripture to share—practice it diligently.

The *Upper Chapter on Dispelling Demons* says: Frequently press and rub the left and right ears, without limit—this is called “tending the city walls,” and one’s name is recorded in the Emperor’s register. Also frequently press the left and right sides of the nose, without limit—this is called “irrigating the Central Peak,” and one’s name is recorded in the Emperor’s ledger. These two methods originate from the oral instructions of Lady Li of Bright Numinosity on Bright Terrace, imparted on the night of the twelfth day of the ninth month.

The Dao says: Regularly press the small hollows behind the eyebrows three times. Also, use the palms and fingers to massage the area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones. Grasp the ears and pull thirty times. Massage frequently, without fixed timing. Upon finishing, reverse the hands and stroke the forehead twenty-seven times, beginning at the space between the eyebrows and moving upward into the hairline. Meanwhile, swallow saliva, without limit to the amount. If practiced regularly, the eyes will grow clear and bright by day, and within a year, one will be able to write at night. This may also be done discreetly at the philtrum, without speaking of its form.

The small hollows behind the eyebrows are the mansion of the Upper Origin’s Six Harmonies, governing the generation of eye radiance, harmonizing and polishing essence and light, preserving the long pearl and penetrating the child’s vision, refining and training the eye spirits. This is the supreme Dao of the Perfected One’s sitting and rising—also called the *Perfected One’s Scripture of Constant Abiding Within*.

The Perfected One sighed and said: If you wish to write at night, you must cultivate the *Constant Abiding*. The reason the Perfected One can observe all four directions and illuminate the eight distant realms is truly due to the clarity of this *Constant Abiding* practice.

The area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones is the *Hall of Bright Resolution*, the *Returning to Infancy’s Supreme Dao*. Grasping and pulling the ears is the art of deep illumination. Through this, the blood flows smoothly, wrinkles and blemishes do not form, the eye’s brilliance shines mysteriously, and spirit and essence flourish in harmony.

When a person begins to age, it seldom does not first manifest in the ears and eyes.

The signs of aging also first appear at the outer corners of the eyes. Place your hands upon the forehead, inwardly visualize the *Red Child* and the *Dual Brightness of Sun and Moon*, and rejoice in the *Upper Prime*. Perform this for three cycles of nine repetitions, ceasing only when the count is complete. This is called the *Morning Practice of the Three Primes to Fortify the Brain and Strengthen the Hair*.

For the four sides of the head, use both hands to stroke along the hair, following its natural flow to gather and bind it, ensuring frequent repetition. Thus, the blood in the head flows freely, and *wind-dampness* does not congeal. When finished, press the four corners of the eyes eighteen times until light is distinctly perceived—this verifies the *Way of the Eye Spirit*. With prolonged practice, one may behold the *Hundred Spirits*.

The *Scripture of Master Stone Scenery* states: Often cover the mouth and nose with your hands, bringing them near the eyes while gently exhaling *qi*. After some time, fluid will form in the palms; use it to anoint the face and eyes. Regular practice imparts fragrance to the body.

The *Jade Scripture of the Three Celestial Passes* says: Frequently press the areas near the eyes and beside the nose, closing the breath to perform this. Cease when the *qi* flows through, then exhale and begin anew. With constant practice, the eyes gain penetrating vision.

The above two methods originate from *Lady Wei of South Mountain*.

The *Scripture of the Three-Five Sequential Flow in Cinnabar Script* states: When seated, often close the eyes and inwardly observe, visualizing the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, they become distinctly clear.

The *Scripture of the Cinnabar Scenery of Grand Simplicity* says: On the face, frequently use both hands to rub and wipe, generating warmth. Follow the contours of the face, ensuring thorough coverage. The face will gain luster, wrinkles and blemishes will not form, and after five years of practice, the complexion will resemble that of a maiden. This is what is meant by *"the qi of mountains and rivers, ever full and never depleted."*

The *Scripture of Cinnabar Scenery* further states: First rub the hands together until hot, then wipe the face and eyes. Next, stroke the hair as if combing it, and alternately massage the arms with the hands. This prevents hair from whitening and keeps the vessels from floating upward.

The *Section on Massage from the Scripture of Grand Cavern’s Essence and Scenery* says: Upon rising, sit upright and regulate the breath. First clasp the hands, then raise them to cover the back of the neck. Tilt the head back to gaze upward, creating tension between the neck and hands. Perform this three or four times to harmonize essence and circulate blood, preventing the intrusion of *wind-qi*. With long practice, one attains freedom from death and illness. Afterward, bend and stretch the body, extend the limbs to their utmost, arch backward, and twist to the sides, activating all joints—each movement performed three times.

Upon rising, first use a towel or thick cloth to wipe the neck on all sides and behind the ears until warm. Then stroke the head as if combing the hair, ensuring thorough coverage. After some time, massage the hands and tend to the face and eyes. With prolonged practice, the eyes become bright, evil *qi* does not invade, the body remains free of grime, and impurities are dispelled. Conclude by swallowing saliva thirty times to guide the inner fluids.

The above method is from the *Scripture of Grand Cavern’s Essence and Scenery*.

**The Jade Scripture of Queen Mother of the West’s Reverse-Womb Massage**

The *Way of Nurturing Life* takes the ears and eyes as its foundation. Scattered vision dims the eyes, and excessive worry blocks the ears—these two afflictions arise from within the body and form illness, not from external misfortune. Thus, it is said: *"Hearing the Dao is not difficult; practicing it is difficult. Practicing it is not difficult; completing it is difficult."* If the ears and eyes are beset by chaotic thoughts and hardships are not dispelled, even if one treads the halls of immortals or grasps the reins of dragons, it will be of no benefit.

For *Reverse-Womb Massage*, use *yang days*—the first day as *yang*, the second as *yin*. On each *yang* morning and *yang* night, upon waking from sleep or rising at dawn, promptly close the eyes and face the direction of one’s *life destiny*. First rub the palms together until slightly warm, then use each hand to press the corresponding eye and trace downward to the ear openings, bringing both palms to meet at the nape nine times. Next, visualize within each eye *purple, red, and yellow clouds of qi*, which descend into the ears. After a long while, recite the *yin incantation*:

*"The Three Clouds of the Eye Youths, the True Lords of the Two Eyes,
Radiant and luminous, they infuse essence and open the divine gates of the Supreme Mystery.
The Cloudy Standards of Grand Simplicity, the Jade Spirits unfold their chapters,
Safeguarding the twin gates, illuminating the nine portals.
All joints respond in resonance, the fluid returns to the Mud-Pill Palace.
The body ascends to the Jade Palace, ranked among the Highest Perfected."*

After reciting, swallow saliva three times, then open the eyes. Make this a regular practice; on *yang* days, it may be performed upon sitting or rising, not only at dawn and dusk. After three years, the ears and eyes will become keen.

When combing the hair, always face the direction of one’s *life destiny*. At the start of combing, recite the *yin incantation*:

*"The Supreme Thearch scatters numinous power, the Five Elders return their spirits.
The Mystic Flower of the Mud-Pill Palace preserves essence and ensures its enduring presence.
On the left, it gathers the Hidden Moon; on the right, it draws the Root of the Sun.
The Six Harmonies refine and purify, and the Hundred Spirits receive grace."*

With constant practice, the head and brain will not ache.

The *Scripture of the Grand Ultimate* states: When combing the hair, face the *Jade Pool*. At the start of combing, softly recite:

*"The Mystic Flower of the Mud-Pill Palace preserves essence and ensures its enduring presence.
On the left is the Hidden Moon; on the right, the Root of the Sun.
The Six Harmonies refine and purify, and the Hundred Spirits receive grace."*

After reciting, swallow saliva three times. With regular practice, hair will not fall out and will grow anew. Frequently change combs, ensuring thorough combing without causing pain, or have an attendant comb the hair extensively. Thus, blood and fluids will not stagnate, and the roots of the hair will remain firm.

The above two methods were taught by *An Jiuhua* for application.

When sitting or lying down, always direct the nostrils toward one’s *life destiny*; this also applies to eating and drinking. If unable to face one’s *life destiny*, orient toward the northeast or northwest—these are also auspicious, being the *gateways of the soul and spirit of Heaven and Earth*. Additionally, upon rising, often gently shake the body from side to side dozens of times.

Then, place both hands behind the back, lift the head toward the heavens, and gently shake the neck left and right twenty times. When finished, sit upright and raise both hands to prop up the sky for a long while. Next, rub the palms together and use them to wipe the sides of the eyes, reaching the ears, and continue for a long while. Then recite the following incantation in secret:

*"Front clasp, rear point—celestial guest of the Emperor on High.
Left glance, right gaze—great measure of long life.
Lifting the head to pant—Taiyi’s utmost extreme.
Crescent-moon dragon weir—Controller of Life in shared alignment.
Drinking and eating the primordial embryo—interlocking with Kunlun.
Inverted double kneel—true person of shared aspiration."*

After reciting, immediately draw in *qi* and hold it. Visualize a red *qi* within the navel, as large as a thread, emerging from the navel and entering the nostrils. Do this three times, and the method of pressing and rubbing is complete. This practice unblocks the hundred joints, ensuring long life without illness.

The *Purple Capital’s Radiant Light Inner Vision Central Method* states: Always lie down with eyes closed, settling the body with subtle *qi*, appearing as if merely asleep so that others remain unaware. Then, inwardly gaze and listen afar to the four directions, directing one’s ears and eyes to ten thousand *li* beyond. With prolonged practice, you will naturally perceive events ten thousand *li* away. If you focus your spirit, you may even see a hundred thousand *li* beyond. Within the ears, one may constantly hear the sounds of gold and jade, the melodies of silk and bamboo—this is the wondrous method. The "four directions" are merely a general term; one should begin with a single direction, applying the inner method of vision and hearing. Initially, there may be no semblance of success, but with time and sincerity, one will naturally enter the marvelous.

The *Highest Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfection Scripture’s Supreme Inner Method for Suppressing Demons and the Great Incantation* states: Whenever traveling through perilous paths or passing by ghostly shrines, or when the mind harbors doubts and fears, or when slight apprehensions arise regarding the places one traverses, first curl the tongue inward, swallow saliva three times, then use the third finger of the left hand to press the base of the philtrum beneath the nostrils—specifically, the inner edge of the nasal diaphragm—thirty-six times. Press firmly without lifting the finger to count. The edge of the nasal diaphragm is called *Mountain Source*. *Mountain Source* is also named *Ghost Well*, *Spirit Pool*, *Root of Evil*, and *Terrace of the Soul*. After pressing, knock the teeth seven times, then advance the palm to cover the nose. With eyes closed, softly recite:

*"Vermilion Bird soars above heaven, divine might inwardly expands.
Mountain Source’s four fills—Ghost Well flees in flight.
Spirit Pool exhales *qi*—Root of Evil hides in submission.
Terrace of the Soul shines in four directions—Jade Chamber’s chimes resound.
Jade Perfection stands majestic—seated, it guards the Hall of Light.
Hands radiate purple mist—head bears the dawn’s glow.
Grasping and chanting the Cavern Scripture’s thirty-nine chapters,
Within dwell demon-repelling dragons and tigers,
Weapon-severing, jar-smashing,
Fierce beasts like galloping oxen,
Sword-swallowing, blade-devouring,
Mountain-lifting, heaven-scaling apes,
Divine birds and poisonous dragons,
Six leaders spewing fire,
Ghost-devouring kings,
Lightning swine and thunder fathers,
Star-snatching, meteor-streaming,
Owls and blazing swift ones,
Moving crosswind,
Great birds and net-spirits—
All stand beside me,
Spitting ten thousand *zhang* of fire to dispel misfortune.
Multitudes of spirits open the Dao—sealing and casting them into mountain villages.
A thousand gods and hundred spirits clasp hands and bow their heads.
Marshals and constables hold lamps to burn incense for me.
Wherever I go, the myriad spirits welcome me."*

When finished, knock the teeth three more times, then slowly remove the left hand. Pressing *Mountain Source* closes the *Ghost Well*; clasping *Spirit Pool* scatters the *Root of Evil*; pressing the *Terrace of the Soul* stations *Jade Perfection* to guard the gate. Thereupon, the numinous root is stirred, celestial beasts come to protect, and a thousand spirits tremble and submit, none daring to disturb my *qi*. This is the natural principle, causing it to occur in an instant.

The *Mountain Source* beneath the nose is the stagnant fluid of the entire body, the thoroughfare of true and evil *qi*. For those who are not true, it generates evil *qi*; for those who are true, it suppresses the myriad evils—all depends on my control and regulation. Thus, good and ill omens manifest here. The *Hall of Light* is also the literary hall of the body, the repository of life and death, the original chamber of the seven *po*, and the numinous abode of the three *hun*. Preserving its spirit enables inner vision; neglecting its Dao leads to decay and rot. Therefore, it is for me to govern—carefully follow its principles of life preservation, and there will be no regrets or faults.

The above four methods are from the *Highest Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*.

The *Great Numinous Perfected One* states: Wind diseases arise from dampness in burial mounds, graves, and the three springs where *qi* stagnates. Thus, the earthly officials stir water and *qi* to create wind impediments. Severe wind impediments render the entire body immobile; milder cases affect half the body or cause the loss of hands and feet. If one frequently dreams of wandering in the northeast or northwest, passing by former dwellings, or seeing places where spirit beds were laid, it is precisely because one is about to connect with the *qi* of the tomb. The northeast of a grave is *Zheng Jue Ming* (Death by Decree), and the northwest is *Nine Calamities*—both are inauspicious grounds for tomb disputes. If one dreams of the deceased in these places, the omen is even more evident. Upon encountering such dreams, upon waking, face upward and knock the teeth three times, then recite:

*"Supreme Primordial, Nine Capitals’ Purple Heaven,
Ordering the soul and protecting life—High and Pure Perfected One.
I receive the supreme method, taught by the Great Mystery,
To attain long life and enduring vision, body soaring as an immortal.
Tombs forever peaceful, ghostly disputes cease,
Soul and spirit harmonious, evil *qi* dispelled.
Wandering demons and specters dare not disturb my spirit.
The Northern Emperor breaks and restrains, drawing *qi* into the abyss.
Attaining the register of the Supreme Emperor, my name inscribed before the throne."*

Recite this twice, then knock the teeth three times, and one will no longer dream of tombs or deceased family ghosts. This is the secret incantation of the Northern Emperor; those with sincere and virtuous intentions may practice it. If one frequently experiences inauspicious dreams, this method may be applied, causing ghostly *qi* to vanish and evil spirits to scatter.

When arms and limbs fail to move, it is because deep wind-toxin *qi* lodges in the meridians, binding and adhering to the bones, causing this condition. Acupuncture and moxibustion are appropriate; with treatment, recovery will follow.

Moreover, one should apply the Northern Emperor’s winding incantation; if performed a hundred times, the illness will swiftly dissipate. First, gently massage the afflicted area with one hand for a long while, then lie down. Inwardly visualize, swallow saliva three times, and knock the teeth three times. Compose the mind and softly recite:

*"Supreme Four Mysteries, Five Flowers and Six Courts,
Three Hun and Seven Po, Celestial Pass and Earthly Essence,
Divine Palace and Guarding Spirits, Heavenly Womb and Supreme Clarity,
Four Limbs and Hundred Spirits, Nine Joints and Myriad Numina,
Receive the Register of Jade Dawn, inscribe it in the Jade City.
Jade Maidens attend my body, Jade Lads protect my life,
Forever aligned with the Two Radiant Ones, ascending as an Immortal to the Upper Clarity,
Ever in step with the sun and moon, sharing their boundless years,
Transcending to rise as an Immortal, attaining Great Peace.
Yet pernicious winds congeal into afflictions, demonic *qi* infuses the Five Dragons,
Specters and tomb-*qi*, yin-*qi* intertwined,
Assailing my four limbs, disrupting my flourishing and decline.
Supreme Heavenly Soldiers, Dragon and Tiger manifest their might,
Severing inauspicious ghosts, dispersing wind and evil at once.
Examine and expel hidden grievances, all poisons and concealed wrongs,
Restore me to normality, that I may shine with the radiance of sun and moon.
Should any transgression be detected, the Northern Ghosts shall seize and crush it;
If they dare offend the luminous above, their punishment shall be recorded by the Chief of Stars."*

From the *Scripture of the Supreme Inscription of Lingering Flowers on Scattered Petals*, the method of massage prescribes: At the time of *qi*-generation, swallow saliva fourteen times, then press the painful area while facing the ruler and recite:

*"Left Mystery and Right Mystery, Three Spirits unite in perfection,
Left Yellow and Right Yellow, Six Flowers harmonize,
Wind-*qi* and malignant illness, subdued and concealed in the four directions.
Jade fluid flows with grace, circulating above and below,
Internally dispatching Water and Fire, externally repelling inauspiciousness,
To attain long life as a Divine Immortal, with a body ever strong and at ease."*

Conclude by swallowing saliva fourteen times again. Practicing this regularly will ensure freedom from illness.

Press the painful area urgently thirty-one times.

The above method was revealed on the twenty-second day of the tenth month by the Right Radiant Lady Wang of Cloudy Waves and Verdant Grove Palace.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Numinous Eradication of Demons* states: If the body feels unwell, curl the tongue to block the throat, rinse with saliva, and swallow it without count. After a moment, the discomfort will naturally dissipate. At that time, one will also commonly feel the body relaxed and supple.

The above method is excerpted from the *Supreme Numinous Eradication of Demons*.

If dreams are unclear and the *po* soul aligns with malevolent *qi*, it is as though something examines the heart, seeking to ambush the spirit in its moments of vulnerability. Whenever encountering a nightmare, simply face north and invoke the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, recounting the details. After no more than four or five repetitions, the disturbance will vanish of its own accord.

The above is a secret oral instruction of the Azure Lad.

When encountering ill or inauspicious dreams day or night, upon waking, immediately turn the pillow over and recite while reclining upon it:

*"Jade Maiden of Supreme Harmony, attend the true and guard the soul,
Six Palaces’ Golden Lads, come to defend the Gate of Life,
Transform evil into good, inscribe it above the Three Origins,
Grant me long life, to ride the radiance and mount the clouds."*

Conclude by swallowing saliva nine times and clicking the teeth seven times before sleeping. After four or five repetitions, all such disturbances will naturally cease entirely.

This incantation also reverses inauspicious dreams to auspicious ones.

*Recorded on the night of the thirteenth day of the eleventh month by the Lady of Right Radiance.*

The numinous pivot of the celestial patterns lies in the clarity of one’s vision; the profound and empty heart, serene and luminous, drifts like mist, savoring the Great Harmony, embodying the qi of the vast and silent. Thereupon, jade chimes resound, and the myriad sounds are summoned in profound stillness.

Qi is the craft of spirit and brightness, the wellspring of purity and turbidity. Abiding in the mysterious, it clears the heavens; dwelling in man, it preserves the body. Life knows neither loss nor excess, for it follows the art of nurture and restraint.

To ingest the Six Qi, one must always begin at dawn, during the hours of *yin* and *chou*, when the celestial timing commences, and the directions align with this moment. As the great rosy clouds part and radiance emerges, when the cinnabar sun rises and the luminous dawn breaks, and the vermilion essence first shines—first visualize the sun as an egg within the *Niwan* Palace. Then exhale one breath, imagining the qi as black, naming it the *Corpse Qi*. Next exhale a second breath, imagining the qi as white, naming it the *Old Qi*. Exhale a third breath, imagining the qi as gray, naming it the *Dead Qi*. Focus on each color while exhaling for a long while. In total, three colors are exhaled, comprising the Six Qi.

Afterward, slowly draw in and guide the qi, inhaling the yellow qi four times. Visualize the qi descending from the sun within the *Niwan* Palace. After four inhalations, swallow saliva three times, completing three full cycles. Then visualize the qi within the *Niwan* Palace descending from the ears and appearing before the mouth, nine inches from the face, so that it seems almost visible to the eyes. Again, riding the sun, draw in and guide the red qi seven times. After seven inhalations, swallow saliva three times to conclude. Then rise and move the four limbs, bending and stretching to harmonize the joints and meridians, completing the practice. When visualizing and swallowing saliva, always imagine it as green.

At night, one may also visualize the moon within the *Niwan* Palace, following the same method as for the sun. For moon visualization, begin at midnight on the first day of the lunar month and continue until the fifteenth. From the sixteenth to the thirtieth, the moon’s qi wanes and diminishes, and the celestial embryo contracts—do not visualize the moon at night during this period.

This method is most wondrous; those who practice it attain immortality. It is the art of exhaling and inhaling the primordial embryo, rinsing and absorbing the luminous truth. By timely invocation and fivefold swallowing, one attains the natural state, the hun-soul returns to its abode, and the po-soul rests in the *Niwan* Palace—thus is long life achieved. How can it compare to gathering the yin qi of secluded valleys, seeking the swift spirits of galloping horses, treading the sea in search of passage, or driving feathered chariots upon fiery mountains? Be cautious, be most cautious.

*Secret Instructions of the Queen Mother of the West.*

On the night of the fourth day of the seventh month in the third year of *Xingning* of the *Yichou* era, the Lord of Life, Eastern Minister, descended with seven attendants entering the chamber. One held a flowered banner, also called the *Tenfold Numinous Pennant*; another bore a ring and a satchel of seals; three carried white ivory boxes, within which appeared to be books. Another grasped a flowing-gold fire-bell. The attendants were all clad in vermilion.

The Lord of Life appeared far younger than his two younger brothers, clad in a green brocade skirt, a purple fur cape, and a lotus crown at its center. His two brothers had likewise come to stand in attendance, and only after being bidden to sit did they take their seats. They spoke at length.

On the night of the sixth day of the seventh month, the Lord of Life descended once more to deliver a written admonition, saying: Should one truly model oneself upon the profound and embrace the symbolic, maintaining purity and tranquility in rare moments, then one may pluck the hidden blossoms from the thronging shadows, fold one’s wings and nest in lofty seclusion, savor the resonance of higher accord, abide in the stillness of deep pools and the steadfastness of mountains, wander through jade-like scriptures in serene solitude, and nurture the divine within by treasuring the sacred. Casting aside worldly attachments, one harmonizes and plays the pure numen, clarifying the inner vision within emptiness. The Five Ways become luminous, form transcends the waves of transformation, desire merges with stillness, and emptiness unites with the obscure thoroughfare. With neither sight nor hearing, one thus aligns with the subtlest truth, reawakens profound awareness, perfects virtue within, and stabilizes the spirit without. In the end, one may ride cloud chariots to ascend the heavens and inscribe the Lord of Life’s cinnabar register.

Yet if the mind scatters into ten thousand thoughts and life is not firmly rooted, if qi follows the dust and waves while the heart does not truly dwell in its abode, then one merely wearies body and spirit among the mountains and valleys, truly misleading those who come to learn. The Way is subtle yet easy to seek; the Way is arduous yet difficult to attain.

On the night of the fifth day of the month at midnight, visualize the solar image within the heart, allowing the sun to enter through the mouth. Let it illuminate the heart’s interior, merging its light with the sun’s radiance. When the union is complete, one should feel warmth in the heart, suffused with rosy glow as verification. After a long while, recite the incantation: *"Great brightness nurtures essence, refining the cinnabar heart within. Light and radiance merge, and the divine and true come to the body."* Upon completion, swallow saliva nine times.

Repeat this practice on the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days of the month. Through this, one’s perception becomes keen and clear, the hundred passages unobstructed, the face radiant with jade-like light, and the body suffused with golden liquid. After five years of practice, the Great One will dispatch a protective chariot to welcome you, ascending to the Supreme Empyrean. The practice need not be confined to these specific days but should be frequent.

This passage is excerpted from the *Scripture on Dispelling Demons*, an inner method of the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount.

It further states: When partaking of meals, do not speak of matters of death, nor expose food, lest it attract the qi of manifold malevolent spirits.

It also advises: Bathe frequently, and on the day of *jiazi*, one must wash one’s hair. If not, then at dawn on the first day of the month, one should bathe to facilitate communion with the numinous. The concern is not with the frequency of bathing but with the practitioner’s inability to do so. By scouring and refining the stench of the corpse, the true qi enters.

These are the instructions of the Mystic Master, Lady Wei, to be implemented as directed.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Nine Transformations and Ten Transmutations for Renewal* states: When treading upon filth or any unclean place, one should first bathe to dissolve and dispel it. The method employs ten ounces of bamboo leaves and four ounces of peeled white peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water in a cauldron. Before boiling, remove the liquid, adjust to a suitable temperature, and bathe the body, thereby eliminating all filth. This not only dispels impurities but also prevents damp impediment, sores, and itching.

Moreover, bamboo is hollow, plain, and inwardly white, while peach repels evil and breaks filth. Thus, these two substances are used to purge the turbidity within the body. When celestial beings descend to the mortal realm and return, they invariably use this water for cleansing. Compared to the common techniques of talismanic water, incantations, and external rinsing, none match this method. While bathing with this water is even more beneficial, it should not be used for washing the hair. The pure essence for refining the corpse is precisely suited for bathing—truly wondrous and secret.

These are the directives of the Lady of the Purple Tenuity of the Mystic Mound Feather Palace, to be employed as commanded.

At dawn on an auspicious day, face the *wang* direction, write in vermilion, bow twice, and ingest.

The incantation reads:
"Five spirits open the heart, penetrating hearing and absolute sound;
Three souls gather essence, steadfastly guarding the cinnabar heart.
Let me not forget, as the five viscera seek afar."

First bow, then recite the incantation upon completion of the bow. After reciting, ingest the talisman, then swallow saliva five times and click the teeth five times. Do not let others witness this.

If an *opening day* is not used, employ the first day of the month, the fifteenth day, and the twenty-seventh day—three ingestions per month. Within a year, efficacy will manifest. This is a secret talisman.

Oral instructions of the Perfected One of Great Emptiness:
On a *yi-mao* day in spring, *bing-wu* day in summer, *geng-shen* day in autumn, or *ren-zi* day in winter, at the hour of dark repose, first grind cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment—each in equal thirds—finely, then wrap them in silk to form a ball the size of a jujube. At bedtime, insert these into both ears. This is the wondrous and secret method for dissolving the Three Corpses and refining the Seven Po. Let no one know of this.

The next day at noon, bathe in east-flowing water. After bathing, rearrange the bedding and mat, change into fresh clothing, wash the old garments, replace worn shoes, and cleanse them thoroughly. Once all is done, sweep and sprinkle water beneath the sleeping couch, ensuring the entire chamber is pure and clean. Then, recline upon the pillow, face upward, close the *qi*, clench the fists firmly for a long while, and softly recite:
"The Dao of Heaven is constant, renewing the old and making it new.
On this auspicious day of the Supreme Thearch, bathing refines the true.
The Three *Qi* dissolve the corpse, cinnabar and yellow settle the soul.
Precious refinement of the Seven Po, may they draw near to me."

Upon completion of the recitation, this method is the supreme technique for dissolving and refining corpse impurities, the essential secret for transforming and renewing the form. Perform this once in each of the four seasons.

The Perfected One of Great Emptiness said:
"As my former master taught, on the *Five Pervading Days*, when the sun has risen three or four *zhang*, stand upright facing the sun. Visualize the Three Soul spirits entering the heart together with the sunlight, perfectly aligned and inwardly penetrating for a long while. Close the *qi* for three breaths, swallow saliva three times, and softly recite:
'The radiance of the Great Yang scatters its brilliance, casting purple and azure light.
Enter my body, illuminate my five forms.
Repel demonic trials, steady and align my heart.
Inwardly penetrate the Nine *Qi*, outwardly connect with the embryo’s destiny.
Ascend as a flying immortal to the Jade Purity, my name inscribed in the Jade Register.'

After the incantation, wipe the eyes fourteen times and click the teeth fourteen times. Once all is done, this method causes the Three Souls to congeal in clarity, the cinnabar heart to become upright, all myriad evils to hide and submit, and demonic trials to cease. Truly, this is an essential Dao. You should practice this regularly on the *Five Pervading Days*, facing the sun to induce sneezing. If sneezing does not occur, use a soft object to gently stimulate the nose while facing the sun, and sneezing will follow. Upon sneezing, recite:
'Heavenly light advances, the Six Embryos ascend and connect.
Three Souls guard the spirit, Seven Po do not perish.
Receiving the sun’s sneeze, I share its form.
Fly as an immortal to the Jade Purity, attaining the rank of Perfected Lord.'

After reciting, wipe the eyes fourteen times. This causes the inner essence to ascend and merge with the sunlight, the Three Souls to radiate brilliance within, opening the heart and enlightening the spirit, while the hundred essences flow and circulate within the inner palace. If it is not one of the *Five Pervading Days*, this need not be done.

On the *Five Pervading Days*, face north and bow five times. With a sincere heart, invoke the names of the Supreme Perfected Sovereign and the Sovereign’s Lady three times. After completing this, click the teeth five times, remove your headscarf, and kneel lengthwise. Reverently address the August Perfected of the Five Stars, the Sun, the Moon, the Highest Perfected of the Dao, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Purity, the Supreme Purity, the August Thearch of the Highest Purity, and the Sagely Lord of the Great Dao before the few, stating:
'From my seven generations of ancestors and parents down to myself, for the thousand transgressions and myriad faults committed since past lives, I beseech deliverance. May the Three Offices report to the Heavenly Thearch, causing my sins to be absolved, my name stricken from the black tally. I pray to receive the true essence of the Five Stars, hastening together to the Flowery Dawn, ascending to the Supreme Purity, and traversing the Jade Gate.'

The *Five Pervading Auspicious Days* are:
- First month: sixth day at noon
- Second month: first day at dusk
- Third month: seventh day at midnight
- Fourth month: ninth day at breakfast
- Fifth month: fifteenth day at midnight

Method for Ingesting the Essence of the Sun and Moon:
On the first day of the lunar month, when the sun has risen two *zhang* high, gaze toward it from afar, clench the fists, take three *Yu* steps facing east, and draw in the sun’s essence fourteen times with the mouth, swallowing it. After fourteen days, you may enter a household afflicted with warm disease, and no other illness will touch you. Those who accompany you will feel light, and if you sleep thus, you will attain longevity.

On the third day of the lunar month, when the moon rises in the *geng* position, clench both fists, walk southwest, face the moon, take three *Yu* steps, and draw in the moon’s essence fourteen times with the mouth, swallowing it. For the entire year, you will be free from illness and may also enter households of the deceased.

The sun and moon illuminate impurities and filth. These two methods—ingesting the sun’s essence and drinking the moon’s essence—dissolve and eliminate the myriad illnesses.
