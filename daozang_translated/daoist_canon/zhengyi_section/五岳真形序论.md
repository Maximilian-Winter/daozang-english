# 五岳真形序论

**Preface and Discourse on the True Forms of the Five Sacred Peaks**

*Scripture Title:* Preface and Discourse on the True Forms of the Five Sacred Peaks. The compiler is unknown. Citing the sayings of Ge Hong, it likely dates to the Wei-Jin period. One fascicle. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Proper Section I. See also: *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, Fascicle 79.

In ancient times, Emperor Wu of Han was fond of the Dao of longevity. He frequently offered sacrifices to famous mountains and great marshes, praying to the sacred peaks in hopes of divine transcendents’ response. In the first month, the *jiazi* day of the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era, he sacrificed at Mount Songgao, erecting a Daoist palace. The emperor observed a seven-day retreat, and upon completing the rites, he returned. By the fourth month, the *wuchen* day, as he sat in quietude at night, Dongfang Shuo and Dong Zhongshu were at his side.

Suddenly, a woman appeared, clad in azure robes, of extraordinary beauty. Startled, the emperor asked, "Who are you?" The woman replied, "I am the Jade Maiden of the Jade Palace, sent by the Queen Mother of the West from Mount Kunlun to speak with you. I hear you wish to relinquish the emoluments of the Four Seas, seek the Dao, and pursue life, descending from your exalted throne to repeatedly pray at the sacred mountains. How diligent and sincere! You seem one who may be taught. From this day, observe a hundred days of pure retreat, abstaining from worldly affairs. On the seventh day of the seventh month next year, the Queen Mother of the West shall briefly descend."

Emperor Wu descended from his seat and knelt in assent. As her words ended, the Jade Maiden vanished without a trace. Thereupon, the emperor ascended the Terrace for Seeking the True, fasting and cultivating the Dao. He temporarily entrusted the affairs of the four quarters to his chief minister.

On the seventh day of the seventh month, he swept and purified the inner palace, arranging a seat in the great hall. He spread purple silk upon the ground, burned incense of a hundred harmonies, hung cloud-patterned brocade curtains, lit nine lamps of subtle radiance, laid out robes of jade maidens, and prepared grape wine. He personally oversaw the preparation of delicate viands, making offerings fit for the celestial palace.

The emperor donned his finest robes and stood at the foot of the steps, ordering the gates to be firmly secured, forbidding any from peering in. Within and without, all was hushed and still, awaiting the arrival of the immortals.

After the second watch of the night, suddenly the southwestern sky appeared as a white cloud, dense and billowing, advancing directly toward the palace. In an instant, it drew near. From within the clouds came the sounds of flutes and drums, the clamor of men and horses. After the time it takes to eat half a meal, the Queen Mother arrived. She alighted before the hall like a flock of birds descending. Some rode dragons and tigers, others white deer, white *lin* beasts, or white cranes; some drove carriages of jade, others celestial steeds. Thousands of immortals illuminated the courtyard with their radiance.

Upon arrival, her attendants vanished from sight. Only the Queen Mother was visible, riding a chariot of purple clouds, drawn by nine multicolored striped dragons. Fifty celestial immortals accompanied her cloud-borne carriage, each over ten feet tall, all bearing staffs adorned with colored tassels, girded with belts of adamantine seals, and holding the staves of perfected beings. They all halted below the steps.

The Queen Mother, supported by two attendants, ascended the hall. The attendants appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years old, clad in azure damask robes. Their eyes sparkled, their spirits were luminous, and their beauty was unmatched in the world.

The Queen Mother took her seat facing east, wearing a yellow brocade robe with a lustrous, resplendent pattern. Her great sash of the *Lingfei* shimmered with golden light. At her waist hung the *Fenjing* sword, and upon her head rested the grand floral knot, crowned with the *Tai Zhen Chen Ying* coronet. Her shoes bore the phoenix patterns of dark jade. Her presence illuminated the vermilion pillars, her divine radiance blazing forth.

She appeared to be about thirty years old, her stature perfectly proportioned. Her celestial countenance was veiled in mist, her spirit visage unmatched in the world—truly a divine being.

Descending from her chariot and mounting the dais, Emperor Wu knelt and bowed. After inquiring after her well-being, he stood at attention. She then summoned him to sit beside her. The emperor faced south as the Queen Mother personally prepared the feast.

The feast was extraordinarily refined and splendid. The delicacies were sumptuous, the fruits fragrant and diverse—purple mushrooms, ferns, and water chestnuts filled the platters. The wine was of celestial purity, its sweet aroma unmatched in the mortal world, its flavor unlike any common brew. Emperor Wu could not name it.

She then commanded her attendants to fetch peach fruits. In a moment, they presented seven peaches on a jade platter, each as large as a duck’s egg, round and green in hue. The Queen Mother offered four to the emperor and ate three herself. The peaches were so sweet and delicious that their flavor lingered in the mouth.

As the emperor ate, he saved the pits. The Queen Mother asked, "Why do you keep the pits?" He replied, "I wish to plant them." The Queen Mother said, "These peaches bear fruit but once every three thousand years. The soil of the Central Land is too thin; they will not grow here." The emperor ceased his intent.

Then, descending from the dais, he kowtowed and confessed, "I, Liu Che, am unworthy of my nature, sunk in the dust of the mundane world. Inheriting the legacy of my ancestors, I have been shackled by worldly burdens."

The governance falters, the myriad people lack harmony, wind and rain lose their season, the five grains fail to ripen, virtue’s grace is unestablished, and bandits and thieves arise on all sides—all this stems from the ruler’s sins, heaped high as mountains. Yet in youth you cherished the Dao of life, gazing upward in admiration of the numinous immortals. Unable to abandon rank and renown, to dwell hidden in the mountains and forests, or to sever the dust’s allure, you know not where to turn. To cast off the world and seek the Real, to inquire without a teacher—time presses on, and you ever fear the swift approach of mortality.

Never did you imagine that the Celestial Perfected would descend in an instant, that today this humble servant would be so fortunate as to behold the Supreme Sage. This is your destined fate, to attain deliverance in this life. I beseech you to take pity, to bestow upon me what I have failed to comprehend, that I may receive and uphold your most intimate teachings.

The Queen Mother replied: "If you can scorn glory and delight in humility, if you can immerse yourself in the savor of the Dao, this would indeed be excellent. Yet your passions run rampant, your desires overflow, your licentiousness and excess know no bounds, your killing and violence defy all law, and your nature is steeped in extravagance. Passion is the chariot that rends the body; lust is the axe that shatters the years. Killing invites retribution; extravagance rots the heart. Desires accumulate and harm the spirit; filth gathers and severs the life-thread. With this tiny frame, you harbor the thieves that destroy form; with this foot-long talent, you are assailed by a hundred blades. To seek liberation from the Three Corpses and make the body endure forever—this is scarcely attainable.

It is like the flightless quail longing to beat its wings over the Celestial Pond, or the ephemeral insect delighting in the span of spring and autumn. If you can sweep away these manifold disorders, purge the foul and restore the pure, preserve the spirit-qi within the Crimson Palace, seal the Palace of Lust and leave it unopened, still the extravagance in the chamber of silence, cherish all living beings and bring them no peril—if you can guard these Daoist precepts, contemplate the savor of the numinous, strive to bestow kindness and harmony, refine the essence and treasure the qi, early cast off superficial splendor, and hasten the departure of all strife—then in your conduct, will there not be some semblance of the Way?

If you do not do so, it will be as futile as embracing a stone to cross the vast river."

The emperor knelt and received the sacred admonitions, vowing to follow these words.

The emperor saw in the Queen Mother’s basket a small scroll encased in a purple brocade pouch. He inquired, “Is this a divine elixir formula? Might I know its title and gaze upon it?”

The Queen Mother took it out and showed him: “This is the *Chart of the True Forms of the Five Peaks*. The immortals of Mount Qingcheng recently sought it from me, and I am now passing it to them. It was issued by the Supreme of the Three Heavens, its scriptures profound and its prohibitions weighty—how could your impure frame be worthy to bear it? For now, I shall give you the *Scripture of Numinous Radiance and Vital Flourishing*, which may open your spirit and inspire your resolve.”

The emperor persisted in his request, so the Queen Mother said: “In the first year of Supreme Sovereign Qingxu, the Supreme Lord of the Dao of the Three Heavens descended to survey the six directions, observing the length and breadth of rivers and seas, examining the heights and depths of hills and mountains. He named the celestial pillars and established them in the earth’s patterns, stabilized the Five Peaks and likened them to the supporting ministers of the realm. He honored Mount Kunlun as the dwelling of divine immortals, revered Penglai as the abode of perfected beings, settled the water spirits at the source of utmost yin, and lodged the Supreme Thearch in the ruins of Fusang. Thus, the mound of Fangzhang became the chamber of governance, the isles of Canglang nurtured the hall of the Nine Elders, and the primordial streams of Zuying and Xuanyan sustained the eternal flow of life. Phoenixes and unicorns gathered in their caves, each forming the names of the isles—all lying amidst the vast expanse of the dark currents of the great sea. Its waters flowed in jade and ink, while its waves surged with the essences of all things. Divine immortals and jade maidens dwelled together in the azure radiance, their names elusive yet their forms distinct.

Thereupon, following the contours of the mountains’ origins and beholding the winding paths of rivers and peaks—where ridges coiled and mounds turned, where mountains rose high and ranges stretched long—he traced their revolving, sinuous shapes, which resembled written characters. Thus, he fashioned names according to their forms, establishing titles that matched their true natures. He concealed their complete forms in the Dark Terrace, then revealed them as tokens of the numinous and true. All immortals wear them as one would a transmitted seal. When Daoist adepts carry them while traversing mountains and rivers, the hundred spirits and host of divinities honor and personally welcome them.

Though you are not yet perfected, your repeated journeys to mountains and marshes, your earnest seeking of the Dao, have not been forgotten. Delighted by your sincerity, I now bestow this upon you. You must revere it with utmost care, as you would serve a sovereign or father. Should you reveal it to the common folk, calamity will surely befall you.”

According to the statutes of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital and the Thousand Luminaries, the talismans of the Nine Qi Venerable Lord and the Radiant Life, along with the myriad numinous scripts, were all composed by the Great Dao Lord of the Three Heavens. Some were crafted by the Heavenly Perfected of the Three Sovereigns, others issued by the Crimson Youth, the True Person and Parent of the Nine Heavens. These transmissions are granted but once every forty years to a single recipient. If no worthy candidate appears in forty years, the term extends to eighty, allowing two to receive them at once. To confer them upon the unworthy is to leak the Dao of Heaven. To withhold them from the deserving is to seal Heaven’s treasure. To bestow them recklessly without regard for limits is to trifle with the Heavenly Elder. To receive them without reverence is to slight Heaven’s ornament. Leakage, sealing, trifling, and disdain—these four are the chariots that bear extended calamity. Leakage brings death upon the roads, rebirth in fractured form with shattered bones. Sealing brings blindness and deafness in the next life, a withered fate cut short. Trifling brings misfortune upon one’s parents, summoning punishment in the Dark Capital. Disdain brings a violent end and descent into grievous illness in later generations. Worse still are those whose crimes surpass these: their clans are severed, their lineages extinguished.

Those of the same Dao are called Heaven’s kin; those of the same heart, Earth’s beloved. In transmission, one must cherish mutual affection, share honor and disgrace, cultivate a mind of true unity, treasure the essence of life, and together nurture harmonious qi. When qi converges and spirit returns, one will surely ascend to the numinous assembly. Should you fail in this, Heaven will visit plague upon you. These are the statutes and prohibitions of the Dao—now I warn you, you must not be careless.

If you wish to pass this on, Dong Zhongshu appears to be the right candidate. The Queen Mother then commanded her attendant to retrieve another scroll. The attendant reached into her robe and produced a volume, its form and script as luminous and precise as the one before. The Queen Mother placed it in the Emperor’s hands, and he received it with two bows, kneeling. She said, “Should you succeed in clarifying your true nature, turning from evil to cultivate goodness, return in three years and seven months, and I will teach you further of the Dao.”

Suddenly, from the Vermilion Bird window in the southern hall, a figure peered in at the Queen Mother. The Emperor, startled, asked who it was. The Queen Mother replied, “Do you not recognize him? That is your attendant, Dongfang Shuo. He is a mischievous neighbor’s child, always full of jest, who has thrice stolen these peaches. Formerly an immortal official under the Most High, he was sent to Mount Fangzhang to assist the Three Heavenly Directors of Destiny in gathering the records of all households. But upon arriving, he indulged only in wandering mountains and waters, neglecting to cultivate harmonious qi. He wantonly manipulated thunder and lightning, stirred waves and winds, disrupting the timely order of wind and rain, throwing yin and yang into chaos. This caused dragons and leviathans to crawl on land, mountains to collapse and borders to crumble, the seas to dry in sudden drought, and the Yellow Horse constellation to sink into the abyss. He harmed the fields of medicinal herbs, drowned himself in jade wine, lost the harmony of his charge, and violated the statutes of his commission. Thus, the Venerable Lord of the Nine Springs reported him to the Most High, who demoted and banished him to the mortal realm, exiling him from the court of the Grand Clarity to dwell among the foul and base.

Recently, two immortals of Golden Flower Mountain and the Lord of the Nine Doubts have petitioned on his behalf, seeking clemency for his conduct. Only then did the Emperor realize that Shuo was no ordinary man. As they spoke and drank, the Queen Mother revealed the names of the immortal officials in attendance, along with the titles of their regalia and the names of the objects they bore. The Emperor committed all this to memory.

As dawn approached, the Queen Mother prepared to depart. Her retinue of men, horses, dragons, and tigers, with drums and pipes leading the way, mirrored her arrival—clouds and mist surged, now transformed into fragrant vapors. Gazing southwest, the Emperor watched until the vision faded entirely.

After witnessing the Queen Mother, the Emperor came to believe in the existence of divine immortals throughout the world. He began to contemplate plans for transcending the mortal realm, yet his nature remained bound to excess and lust, and his wars of conquest never ceased. The people groaned under the burden of labor, and the innocent dead cried out in resentment. He did not heed the Sacred Mother’s words, and so she never returned.

Before parting, the Queen Mother had spoken at length to the Emperor—of methods to prolong life, arts to summon spirits. The Emperor compiled these into a single volume. Along with the scriptures and diagrams she had bestowed, he had them all placed upon a table of yellow gold, sealed in a casket of white jade, and stored in the Hall of Cypress Beams. In the first year of the *Taichu* era, a heavenly fire consumed the hall, and with it, the *True Forms*, the *Scripture of Numinous Radiance*, and the Emperor’s own compilation of essential teachings were all lost to the flames. The Queen Mother had often warned the Emperor, and this was her punishment for his disobedience.

However, the Emperor had earlier heeded the Queen Mother’s words and entrusted the diagram to Dong Zhongshu. Through his transcription, it survived. Later, Dongfang Shuo one day ascended on a cloud-dragon and flew away. Many witnessed him rising slowly toward the northwest, until a great mist enveloped him, and his whereabouts became unknown. The Emperor deeply regretted his failure to grasp the Dao.

That December, he performed the *Haoli* sacrifice to the Earth God, then journeyed east to the Bohai Sea, where he gazed in worship toward Mount Penglai. In spring, he returned to receive the annual reports at Sweet Springs. In the second month, he began construction of the Hall of Established Brilliance.

In the summer, the fifth month, the calendar was rectified, establishing the first month as the beginning of the year. The color yellow was designated as supreme, the number five was adopted, official titles were standardized, and musical tones were harmonized. General Gongsun Ao was dispatched to construct the Outer Wall Reception City beyond the frontier.

In autumn, the eighth month, the Emperor visited Anding. He sent General Li Guangli of Ershi to mobilize valiant troops from across the realm and march west to campaign against the kingdom of Da Yuan. The calendar was reformed to commence the year in the first month—this accorded with the Queen Mother’s intent.

Bao Jing remarked: “I observe that the Queen Mother, sovereign of all immortals, treasures this text. How could one of common or petty stature presume to covet it?”

Emperor Wu of Han inquired of Dongfang Shuo regarding the Queen Mother’s words. Dongfang Shuo replied as follows:

“Zuzhou, Yingzhou, Xuanzhou, Yanzhou, Changzhou, Yuanzhou, Liuzhou, Shengzhou, Fenglinzhou, and Juquzhou—these are the names of the Ten Isles, all situated within the vast sea, in places beyond the reach of mortal footsteps.

Zuzhou lies in the Eastern Sea, spanning five hundred *li* in each direction, seven myriad *li* from the western shore. Upon it grows the herb of immortality, resembling the shoots of wild rice, three or four *chi* in length. When placed upon the dead, they revive at once. Consuming its root grants longevity. In the time of the First Emperor of Qin, many in Da Yuan perished unjustly along the roads. Birds resembling crows often carried this herb in their beaks, covering the faces of the dead, who would then rise immediately. Officials reported this to the First Emperor, who dispatched envoys bearing the herb to consult Master Guigu of Beiguo. The master declared: ‘This is the herb of immortality from Zuzhou in the Eastern Sea. It grows amidst white jade, and is also called the *yangshen zhi* (Spirit-Nourishing Mushroom). Its leaves resemble those of wild rice, and it does not grow in clusters. Harvesting it revives but one person.’ Thereupon, the First Emperor sent five hundred boys and girls into the sea in search of Zuzhou, but none returned.

Yingzhou lies in the Eastern Sea, spanning four thousand *li* in each direction, opposite Kuaiji, seventeen myriad *li* from the shore. Upon it grow divine immortal herbs and jade stones towering a thousand *zhang*. Springs flow forth with a taste like wine, called jade wine or jade cream. Drinking several *sheng* induces intoxication and grants longevity. The isle abounds with immortal dwellings, and its customs resemble those of the people of Wu.

Xuanzhou lies in the northwest of the Northern Sea, spanning seven thousand two hundred *li* in each direction, thirty-six myriad *li* from the shore. Upon it resides the Immortal Earl of the Great Mystery, who governs Mount Xuanshu. There is also Mount Feng, where the sounds of wind and thunder resound, facing the northwestern gate of heaven. Many palaces of the Great Mystery Immortals stand there.

Yanzhou lies in the Southern Sea, spanning two thousand *li* in each direction, nine myriad *li* from the shore. Upon it dwells the wind-born beast, resembling a marten, azure in color, and as large as a raccoon dog. When captured in nets and burned with piles of firewood, the beast remains unscathed amidst the ashes, its fur unscorched. Blades cannot pierce it, and striking it feels like beating a leather sack. Only after hammering its head thousands of times with an iron mallet does it die, yet if its mouth is turned toward the wind, it revives in an instant. Plugging its nostrils with *shichangpu* (stone calamus) kills it. Consuming its brain mixed with chrysanthemum blossoms—ten *jin* in total—grants five hundred years of life. There is also Mount Yanlin, spanning roughly two hundred *li*. Within it dwells the night-glowing beast, as large as a rat, with fur three or four *cun* long, either red or white. On dark nights, the mountain and its beasts glow as if ablaze. Weaving the beast’s fur into cloth produces *huohuan bu* (fire-washing cloth). Garments made from this cloth cannot be cleansed of grime with lye water; only by burning them for the duration of two meals, then shaking out the ashes, does the fabric become as white and pure as snow. Many immortals also dwell there.

Changzhou, also called Qingqiu, lies in the southeast of the Southern Sea. It spans five thousand *li* in each direction, twenty myriad *li* from the shore. The isle abounds in mountains and rivers, as well as colossal trees, some two thousand *wei* in girth. The entire isle is covered in forests, hence its alternate name, Qingqiu (Green Mound). Immortal herbs, sweet liquors, and jade blossoms—nothing is lacking. There is also Mount Feng, vast and resonant with thunderous echoes. Atop it stands the Purple Mansion Palace, where many celestial immortals and fairy maidens gather.

Yuanzhou lies in the Northern Sea, spanning three thousand *li* in each direction, ten myriad *li* from the shore. Upon it grow the Five Mushrooms of the Dark Gorge. The gorge’s waters resemble honey; drinking them grants longevity. Consuming its mushrooms bestows immortality. The isle also abounds with immortal dwellings.”

Flow Isle lies in the Western Sea, spanning three thousand *li* in each direction, ten myriad *li* from the shore. Its surface is rich in mountains, rivers, and piled stones, known as Kunwu Stone. When refined, this stone becomes iron, and when forged into swords, their radiance illuminates caves like crystal, cutting jade as easily as slicing mud. Immortal dwellings also abound here.

Sheng Isle resides in the Eastern Sea between *yin* and *chou*, seventeen myriad *li* from Penglai, spanning two thousand three hundred *li* in each direction, twenty-three myriad *li* from the shore. Tens of thousands of immortals dwell upon it. The celestial *qi* is tranquil and harmonious, grasses and trees flourish perpetually, nurturing all things. The land knows no cold or heat, and is likewise rich in mountains, rivers, and immortal herbs. The waters of another isle here are all sweet as maltose or cream—the finest of their kind.

Fenglin Isle lies in the Western Sea, spanning one thousand five hundred *li* in each direction. Its four sides are encircled by weak waters, where even goose feathers cannot float, making passage impossible. The isle teems with phoenixes and unicorns, gathering in flocks of tens of thousands. It also possesses mountains, rivers, marshes, and a hundred varieties of divine herbs, along with many immortal dwellings. Boiling phoenix beaks and unicorn horns together and refining them into glue yields *Jixian* Glue, also called *Lianjin* Mud. This glue can mend broken bowstrings and rejoin fractured metal. Even if struck again, the repaired joint will not break—only elsewhere will the fracture occur.

Juqu Isle lies in the Western Sea, situated in the *shen* and *wei* quadrant. It spans three thousand *li* in each direction, ten myriad six thousand *li* from Kunlun, and twenty-four myriad *li* from the shore. Upon it stand the palaces and halls of true immortals and spirit officials, their gates too numerous to count. The isle is also home to lions, *pixie* beasts, chisel-toothed creatures, celestial deer, and beasts with long fangs, bronze heads, and iron brows. A great mountain rises upon the isle, its form resembling a human-bird hybrid, hence its name: Human-Bird Mountain. The mountain abounds in colossal trees resembling maples, their branches and leaves exuding a fragrance detectable for hundreds of *li*, known as the *Fanhun* Tree. When struck, the tree emits a sound like the lowing of a herd of oxen, startling the heart and unsettling the spirit of all who hear it. Felling the tree and boiling its roots and core in a jade cauldron yields a syrup, which, when gently simmered, thickens into a black maltose-like substance. Rolled into pellets, it is called *Jingjing* Incense, or *Zhenling* Pills, or *Fansheng* Incense, or *Zhentan* Incense, or *Renwu* Essence, or *Quesi* Incense—one substance with six names. This divine marvel’s fragrance carries for hundreds of *li*. When a corpse on the ground inhales its scent, it revives, requiring no further fumigation to restore life.

Canghai Isle lies in the Northern Sea, spanning two thousand *li* in each direction, twenty myriad *li* from the shore. The sea encircles the isle on all four sides, each stretch five thousand *li* long, its waters all deep blue—hence the name Canghai (Azure Sea). The isle is entirely composed of great mountains and vast accumulations of stone. A hundred varieties of herbs grow here, including Eight-Stone *Zhi*, Stone Brain, Stone Cassia Blossoms, and Flowing Cinnabar Seeds. Consuming these stones grants longevity. At the isle’s center stand palaces of purple stone, the administrative seat of the Nine Elders’ Immortal Capital, where ten thousand immortal officials reside.

Fangzhang lies at the center of the Eastern Sea, equidistant from its eastern and western shores, spanning three thousand *li* in each direction. It is the gathering place of countless dragons, with palaces of gold and jade where the Three Heavenly Directors of Destiny hold court. Those immortals who do not wish to ascend to heaven receive the Register of Great Mystery’s Life here. Tens of thousands of immortals dwell on the isle, tilling fields and cultivating *zhi* herbs, measuring their plots in *qing* and *mu* as if planting rice. There are also jade springs, and atop them stands the Palace of the Nine-Source Elder, who governs the world’s water spirits, dragons, serpents, and yin beasts.

Fusang stands on the eastern shore of the Eastern Sea. A journey of ten myriad *li* inland from its coast leads to another vast sea, its breadth and expanse equal to the present ten thousand seas. Its waters are neither salty nor bitter but shimmer in azure clarity, sweet and fragrant to the taste. Fusang spans ten myriad *li*, and upon it resides the court of the Supreme Emperor and the Great Perfected Eastern King. Forests grow abundantly, their leaves resembling those of the mulberry. There are also *zhen* trees, some stretching thousands of *zhang* in height, over two thousand *wei* in girth. These trees grow in pairs from the same root, leaning against one another—hence the name Fusang *Zhi* (Supporting Mulberry). Immortals who consume its fruit turn golden in body. Though the trees are immense, their leaves and fruit resemble those of the Central Land’s mulberries, differing only in their surpassing sweetness and fragrance. The land yields yellow gold, white jade, and tiles shaped like immortal figures, some ten *zhang* tall, others five or six *chi*.

Pengqiu is Penglai Mountain. It faces the northeastern shore of the great sea, its circumference spanning three thousand *li*. Beyond it lies a circular sea encircling the mountain. Its waters are pitch-black, hence the name Ming Sea (Dark Sea). Though windless, waves tower a hundred *zhang*, making passage impossible. Atop the mountain stand the Palace of the Nine-*Qi* Elder and the Palace of the Nine Heavens’ True King, accessible only to flying immortals.

Kunling is Kunlun Mountain. It lies on the western sea’s edge in the *shen* and *wei* quadrant, forty myriad *li* from Xianyang. The mountain rises ten myriad *li* above the flat earth, its summit spanning a thousand *li*. Its shape resembles an upturned urn, narrow at the base and broad at the top—hence the name Kunlun. Weak waters encircle the mountain, and upon it stand five golden cities, twelve jade towers, towers of flowing essence, halls of luminous jade, chambers of *qionghua*, and secluded chambers of purple and emerald. Here, the Queen Mother of the West holds court, revered by all immortals. Above, it connects to the Nine-*Qi* Celestial Mechanism, distributing the imperial jade balance to all things. The rare and wondrous creatures of the world all emerge from this place, though they cannot all be recorded.

The Supreme One’s sacred mountains stand as tripods in the five directions, anchoring the earth’s principles. The Heavenly Pillar is named in Min City, symbolizing the unseen support. Though the hundred rivers reach their deepest extremes, where water spirits dwell, their yin shores are difficult to reach. Thus, their governance has no fixed abode, unlike hills and mounds that can be readily discussed.

Thus, Heaven and Earth establish their positions, adapting to the suitability of things and their forms. The supreme sages observe the directions, manifesting in accordance with shape. Thereupon, the Mysterious Wind is stationed in the northwest, and the Queen Mother is seated in the *Kun* region. *Kunwu* anchors the flowing marshes, while the Great Mulberry stands by the Azure Ford. The convergence and separation of celestial essence give rise to luminous beasts in the fiery wilds; the *Kan* trigram gathers all yin, and thus the immortal capital resides on the sea isles. The *Gen* position governs the mountain quadrant, where Penglai fills the *yin* and *chou* directions; the *Xun* trigram embodies the Primordial Maiden, nurturing giant trees on the Long Isle. The lofty winds stir the positions of the myriad dragons, enlivening the transcendent ones on distant mounds. Profound and wondrous, abstruse and divine, these mysteries are inexhaustible. The hidden abodes of true immortals and numinous mounds exist throughout the Six Directions—how could they be merely a few places? This merely touches upon their outward signs.

What I have seen is not extensive, and I cannot fully expound the sacred words. Formerly, I heard from those who attained the Dao that these Ten Isles and great sacred mounds are all secluded realms of true immortals, governed by divine officials. Among the myriad mountains and rivers, none compare to these. During the reign of Yao, Yu was dispatched to regulate the floodwaters. He traversed the Five Peaks, carving stones to record their distances, heights, and depths. The script was in tadpole characters, unintelligible to men of Han. The measurements of length and distance today all derive from Yu’s inscriptions. Not only were the Five Peaks thus marked, but so too were other renowned mountains—only the highest solitary peaks were carved. The places I have personally witnessed are those Yu inscribed; the numinous marshes described by the Queen Mother, which Yu never trod, were recorded only on the stones of the Central States’ mountains.

Lu Nüsheng was a native of Changle. From youth, she loved the Dao. Initially, she consumed sesame seeds and later sought to abstain from grains for over eighty years. Each day, she grew younger, her complexion like peach blossoms. In a single day, she could traverse three hundred *li*, outrunning roe deer. She was seen across generations for over two hundred years. Later, while gathering herbs on Mount Songgao, she suddenly encountered a person seated by a stream. Nüsheng bowed her head, prostrated herself, and kowtowed, beseeching the essentials of longevity. The person said: “I am an attendant official of the Supreme One of the Three Heavens. You are destined for immortality, which is why you have met me. I shall bestow upon you the precious script and secret essentials, with which you may command the Five Peaks and employ the myriad spirits.” After a long while, he presented her with the *True Forms of the Five Peaks Chart* and instructed her in its application and regulations. Nüsheng attained the Dao and one day, riding a dragon, bid farewell to her acquaintances, saying she was entering Mount Hua.

Fifty years after her departure, an old acquaintance encountered Nüsheng before the shrine of Mount Hua. She rode a white deer, accompanied by thirty jade maidens, and sent clear greetings to her hometown kin and friends. She said her complexion had grown even younger. The *Chart of the Five Peaks* and the Queen Mother’s instructions are identical to those now seen in the world, originating from Dong Zhongshu and Nüsheng. Before his departure, Zhongshu transmitted it to Yue Ba. Nüsheng later passed it to Feng Junda. During the Jin and Wei dynasties, Junda entered Mount Xuanqiu and, before leaving, transmitted it to the Zheng family.

Ge Hong, a disciple, said: “The supreme Dao is formless, its subtleties difficult to discuss. The affairs of immortals are truly not for the petty to pursue. Yet, as the world does not witness its gate, all call it nonexistent. Even upon seeing true verification, they refuse to speak of it to others. Thus, purity and turbidity diverge, and fragrance and stench stand apart. If Daoists who obtain the sacred books of immortals all seal them within their own mouths, then the texts of the numinous and true would perish in solitary sight—how could they endure and flow through a hundred generations? I hold that transmission should depend on finding the right person, not on complete secrecy.”

Since the lands east of the Jiang have lacked this text, if Master Zheng had again concealed it without revealing it, this scripture would have been forever obscured. Formerly, I once brought this matter to Master Zheng’s attention. He said: “Daoist texts are possessed by all. Like the great celestial script of the Three Sovereigns and the most wondrous numinous books, those who diligently seek and yearn may occasionally hear or see them. The *True Forms of the Five Peaks Chart*, however, has never been transmitted among the people of Wu and Yue since its first recording. Is this because the text is too precious to be imparted? I do not know whether you, sir, possess this book or not.”

Should a fish-eye pearl chance to gleam amid the radiance of the nine suns, or a shard from a filthy mound briefly catch the eye in the marketplace of Nanhuo—if one then lifts one’s gaze to the celestial truth, my resolve only deepens.

Master Zheng said: “This book—I seem to possess it. The prohibitions on its transmission are weighty; it must not be recklessly divulged. To transmit it to the wrong person invites certain calamity. Though many Daoists aspire to purity and uprightness, their conduct is often deficient. Deficiency breeds anxiety, and anxiety brings misfortune. Why rush to procure a text that invites disaster, only to become its victim? Thus, those who first obtained it dared not lightly pass it on, and so it nearly vanished entirely. This is the reason.

You, however, are deeply sincere and will surely penetrate the mysteries and illuminate the obscure. For this reason, I tell you—but do not spread it further. I first received this book from Master Green Ox. Since obtaining the chart, I have transmitted it to no one. According to the immortal statutes, it may be passed to only one person, who must then sever all worldly ties and vanish without a trace. The world’s tumult affords no respite; I shall soon entrust this text to you.”

A year later, on a quiet night in the seventh month, he summoned me and said: “I am about to depart. Prepare silk to copy the chart.” I then purified myself with a solemn fast and received it. All the rituals and protocols I employ today originate from Master Zheng.

Master Zheng spoke of Master Green Ox: the immortal Feng Junda was originally from Longxi. He first consumed yellow coptis for over fifty years, then entered Mount Wushu, where he refined mercury for another hundred years. When he returned to his hometown, he appeared no older than thirty. He often rode a green ox, hence the name “Green Ox Daoist.” Whenever he heard of someone gravely ill—whether acquaintance or stranger—he would administer medicine from the bamboo tube at his waist or apply acupuncture, and all were cured instantly. Many witnessed his miraculous efficacy, yet he never revealed his surname or given name; people knew him only as the one who rode the green ox. He lived among mortals for over two hundred years before entering Mount Xuanqiu, where he vanished without a trace.

Master Green Ox said: “My family possesses the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. Each peak dispatches five spirits to guard the charts. For those dwelling near mountains and rivers, the local deities of mountains and marshes constantly send attendants to protect both body and household. If malevolent forces seek to harm you, they will instead suffer the consequences. The charts repel the five weapons and the five fevers, allowing one to tread unscathed upon blades. They also expose human deceit and unrighteousness: the unrighteous bring ruin upon themselves, and the deceitful bring ruin upon their families. Thus, one must be deeply cautious.

Whoever carries this text or holds it while traversing mountains and forests will be met with bows of reverence from the spirits governing the earth’s veins. Even ghosts and deities observe the rites of humility before its sacred authority—how much more should mortals refrain from negligence?

Master Zheng said: “When residing at home, one should perform a ritual offering to the chart each year. This brings prosperity to the household, advancement in official rank, harmony in all undertakings, the distancing of misfortune, the fulfillment of desires, and the prolongation of life. If dwelling alone in the mountains, the offering may be reduced. The reason is this: in the seclusion of mountains and forests, the heart remains free of impurity, and no wine or meat is produced. Reverence alone suffices. In a household, however, chaos reigns—women, chickens, dogs, and dust defile the space; negligence and careless speech arise; the divine *qi* is polluted, or childbirth occurs within the chambers. Thus, one must perform a fast and offer to the sacred chart to avert disasters and pestilence.

The ritual requires a three-day fast during the month’s designated period, conducted at midnight in a courtyard or secluded room, facing west, without anyone’s knowledge.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor traversed the six directions and later created divine altars. He observed that the eastern, central, western, and northern peaks each had auxiliary mountains, while Mount Heng stood alone without support. He then petitioned the Three Heavens of the Supreme, commanding Mount Huo and Mount Qian to serve as the deputy lords of the Southern Peak, appointing Mount Qingcheng as the Elder and Mount Lu as the Envoy, ordering them to collectively govern Mount Heng and uphold its virtuous truth as its sovereign. The deputy lords are the vice-regents of Mount Heng. Some in Wu and Yue mistakenly regard Mount Huo as the Southern Peak, but this is incorrect.”

**Text for Transmitting the Chart (as transmitted by the Zheng lineage):**
I, [Name], born of flesh and blood, descendant of the hundred officials, have wallowed in clamor and vice, mired in worldly affairs. By fortunate fate, I have encountered the great transformation, cleansed my defiled nature, and been granted a new beginning. I cultivate my heart, guard against transgressions, and aspire to the numinous truth, striving day and night without rest.

On [day, month, year], in the year of [cyclical sign] at [location], I received the *True Forms* of the former masters [A] and [B], in accordance with the statutes of the *Nine Capitals and Thousand Luminaries*, and was permitted transmission. In strict adherence to the Daoist laws, it must be entrusted in utmost secrecy.

Now there is a fellow Daoist, [Name], of [prefecture, county, village], a man of [age] years, diligent and reverent, who will surely propagate the numinous transformation and disseminate the correct *qi*. Thus, in this [year, month], I swear a blood oath and transmit the *True Chart* to him, binding it with silk and making a covenant, forbidding further transmission.

May heaven and I share one heart, ever protecting and cherishing each other. One must not abandon the fundamental for the trivial or seek glory and profit. The general principles of the Five and Eight determine the timing of fortune and misfortune. Assess yourself and others carefully, and act accordingly.

With a purified fast, I offer this transmission in a single presentation, that it may ascend to the Three Heavens.

**Text for Receiving the Chart (as transmitted by Master Zheng):**
I, [Name], born of flesh and bone, descendant of withered remains, have grown up in a defiled age, stained by chaos and the sins of my ancestors. My past transgressions have piled high as hills. Heaven has opened my heart, allowing me to hear the sagely transformation. My mind awakened, I reformed my ways, delighting in life and loving the Dao. I yearn for the numinous and seek true resonance, hoping to be cleansed and prolong my life. I have abandoned impurity and embraced goodness, aspiring to join the seed people. In my quest for long life, I await heaven’s guidance.

Ascending mountains and crossing rivers, I rely on numinous aid. With my heart fixed upon the Daoist gate, I dare not harbor divided loyalties. Together, I offer tribute of local products to strengthen my faith. From this day forward, I receive the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, concealing and guarding them within myself, to remain with them from beginning to end. The cycles of the Five Eights shall come to pass, yet never shall this be leaked or betrayed. Transmission is reserved for those bound by kinship, cherishing our shared qi, transcending honor and disgrace, blessed by Heaven’s statutes. I dare not grow lax or violate the sacred prohibitions. I reverently receive the esoteric instructions, sealing them within my heart.

With a purified fast, I offer this declaration as its inception, presenting it in a single transmission to ascend to the Three Heavens, submitting a memorial to the Most High. May the Three Worms of my body be expunged, my name inscribed in the Register of the Living, carved upon jade tablets, and sealed within the Crimson Palace. Let the numinous peaks of the Five Directions each dispatch their five spirits, and the myriad mountains and rivers appoint attending officials to safeguard this chart and protect my person, that I may attain long life and endure for countless eons.

**Bao Shi’s Instructions for Wearing the Chart**
According to the *True Writ in the Five Vaults of the Yellow Emperor’s Mystic Casket*, this text was compiled and transmitted by the Most High of the Three Heavens. As recounted by those of former attainment, the Purple Orchid Palace of the Queen Mother of the West was adorned with this image. The jade maidens and immortals of the celestial halls wore robes embroidered with its form. In ancient times, the Central Yellow Great One bestowed this chart upon reclusive adepts of the sacred mountains destined for immortality, binding them to transmit it only after the cycles of the Five Eights. Without the destined encounter, none have glimpsed its contents. Such was the case with Lu Nüsheng, who received it in the mountains—all of this kind.

The immortals say: When a Daoist wears this writ into mountains, forests, rivers, or marshes, all the numinous spirits along the way emerge to welcome them beyond the borders. Yet each of the Five Peaks governs its own domain: the mountains of the East belong to the Eastern Peak, and likewise for the Western, Southern, and Northern Peaks. Only the rivers of the plains—Jiang, He, and Huai—and the mountains of the Central Region fall under the jurisdiction of the Central Peak.

Those who enter the mountains to gather the Eight Stones, stalactites, cinnabar, flowing pearls, flying stalks of yellow essence, stone marrow, cassia blossoms, and the divine herbs of the immortals shall never obtain these treasures without the talisman of the Five Peaks. The method of wearing it: wrap it in blue or white silk, encase it in a purple pouch, and fasten it to the head, over the heart, or behind the elbow. No mountain, great or small, lacks its spirit. When they appear, they will announce themselves as the welcoming emissaries of such-and-such a mountain. The True Persons of the Most High command them as their agents, wielding the writ of the Five Peaks to guard this chart. Just as mortals today revere the insignia of local officials, so too do the spirits of mountains and hills come forth to pay homage.

The method of transmission restricts it to once every forty years, sealed by a blood oath. Whoever keeps this writ at home will have the Lords of the Five Peaks each dispatch five spirits to safeguard the chart. The spirits of the mountains, rivers, springs, and marshes where one dwells will send attendants to protect them. Should others harbor malice, plot slander, or seek harm—even if officials strike them—the twenty-five spirits of the Five Peaks and the attending officials of the mountains and rivers will report to the Lord of their respective peak. The peak lord will then command spectral forces to turn the harm back upon the aggressors.

Those who receive this must maintain purity of body and spirit. Should they act with perversity, disrespect the transmission, scorn the sacred trust, or belittle its lineage, disaster will befall them, annihilating their household. None may be careless.

Without the True Form, mountain spirits will corrupt one’s person. Without the True Form, gathering herbs will be obstructed by the host of spirits. Without the True Form, a Daoist’s hun and qi will be unsettled, and the Three Worms will wreak havoc. Without this writ, no adept shall achieve mastery. But with it worn upon the body, one may command all spirits and traverse heaven and earth at will. At home, divine beings will guard them; in the mountains, the spirits will welcome them. Gathering herbs and consuming divine fungi, the True Immortals will protect them. Facing plagues or calamities, disasters will vanish of their own accord. Thus, one may depart in emptiness and return in fullness, witnessing the true verification of fortune and misfortune. Those of the Dao must treasure and revere it.

In the first year of *Yuanfeng* of the Han, the Queen Mother of the West bestowed it upon Emperor Wu of Filial Piety. The True Immortals of the Most High transmitted it to the immortal Chang Le, Lu Nüsheng.

**Preface to the Charts of the Five Peaks** *(by Dongfang Shuo)*
The *True Forms of the Five Peaks* are the likenesses of mountains and waters. Their winding paths, undulating ridges, and varying heights—long and short, coiled and stretched—resemble the flourish of a brush, their peaks and crags sharp as blades. Clouds and forests in hues of dark and yellow take the shapes of written characters. Thus, the Heavenly Perfected Lord of the Dao observed their patterns, emulating their contours and directions, naming the mountains as though composing verse.

Should you possess the form of the Eastern Peak, your spirit will be at peace, your life prolonged, your body preserved for ages. Crossing mountains and rivers, the hundred fungi will gather of their own accord.
Should you possess the form of the Southern Peak, the Five Fevers will not afflict you, fire and flames will be averted. Those who plot evil against you will suffer harm in return.
Should you possess the form of the Central Peak, all your endeavors will prosper, bringing wealth beyond measure. Every wish will be fulfilled without toil.
Should you possess the form of the Western Peak, you will repel the Five Weapons; blades will not wound you. The numinous spirits of mountains and rivers will honor and welcome you.
Should you possess the form of the Northern Peak, entering water will dispel disaster; all poisons will be subdued. You will command dragons and enjoy boundless fortune.

Should you possess the forms of all Five Peaks, you will traverse heaven and earth, encompassing the four directions. All who behold you will rejoice, and gods and mortals will be as one.

In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor marshaled the feudal lords to battle Chiyou in the wilds of Zhuolu, where he captured him. The lords all acclaimed him as Son of Heaven, succeeding the Divine Farmer. Thus was he called the Yellow Emperor. When any in the realm refused submission, he would campaign against them, breaching mountains to open roads, never resting in peace.

To the east he reached the sea, ascending Mount Tai and Daizong; to the west he came to Kongtong, ascending Jitou; to the south he arrived at the Jiang, ascending Xiongxiang; to the north he pursued the Chanyu to Jinfu Mountain of the Golden Talisman, and there established his capital at the slopes of Zhuolu. His movements and sojourns knew no fixed abode.

Observing that the Four Peaks each had auxiliary mountains of destiny, yet the Southern Peak stood solitary without support, he revealed this to the Three Heavens’ Supreme Dao Lord, appointing Huo Mountain and Qian Mountain as its reserve lords. The petition was granted. The Emperor then personally crafted the mountains, inscribing their forms and images, appending them to the Five Charts.

He further commanded that Qingcheng be honored as the Venerable Elder and Lushan be designated as the Envoy. Their forms followed in succession, this practice originating with the Yellow Emperor.

The Lord of the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, commands a host of five thousand nine hundred spirits, governing life and death as the marshal of all ghosts. He receives blood sacrifices and ancestral rites, revered as the patriarch of the common world. The misguided spirits and heterodox deities worshipped by the vulgar all return to Mount Tai after death to receive judgment and punishment.

Those who bear the forms of the Five Peaks, when entering sacred mountains or visiting Mount Tai, will be met at the border by the Lord of Tai and all the spirits of mountains and rivers, who will come forth to welcome and bow to them. The Lord of Mount Tai wears a cyan robe, a seven-tiered azure crown, and bears the Seal of Tongyang and Great Origin. He rides a green dragon, accompanied by his retinue of officials to welcome you.

The Lord of the Southern Peak, Mount Heng, commands seventy thousand seven hundred immortals. When entering the domain of the Southern Peak, all the mountain and river spirits under his jurisdiction will come forth to welcome you. The Lord of the Southern Peak wears a robe of vermilion radiance, a crown of Nine Elixirs and Solar Essence, and bears the Luminous Celestial Perfection Seal. He rides a red dragon, accompanied by his retinue of officials to welcome you.

The Lord of the Central Peak, Mount Song, commands thirty thousand jade maidens. When entering its mountains, all the renowned spirits under the Central Peak’s jurisdiction will come to welcome you. The Lord of the Central Peak wears a robe of yellow silk, a crown of Yellow Jade and Great Unity, and bears the Seal of Divine Clan and Yang Harmony. He rides a yellow dragon, accompanied by his retinue of officials to welcome you. The Central Peak governs the five soils; treat it with utmost reverence. The Supreme One often appoints the most virtuous and esteemed of the Three Heavens’ Perfected to reside there.

The Lord of the Western Peak, Mount Hua, commands four thousand one hundred immortals and jade maidens. When Daoists enter the mountains and rivers under his jurisdiction, the spirits will all come forth to welcome them. The Lord of Mount Hua wears a robe of white silk, a crown of Great Beginning and Nine Streams, and bears the Seal of Opening Heaven and Communing with Perfection. He rides a white dragon to welcome you.

The Lord of the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, commands seven thousand immortals and jade maidens. When entering the mountains and rivers under his jurisdiction, the spirits will all come forth to welcome you. The Lord of the Northern Peak wears a robe of dark flowing silk, a crown of Supreme Perfection and Mystic Spirit, and bears the Seal of Long River and Awakened Perfection. He rides a black dragon to welcome you.

The Venerable Elder of Qingcheng, appointed by the Yellow Emperor, governs the earthbound immortals and oversees the Five Peaks, unifying all officials. The Venerable Elder commands ten thousand immortals. When Daoists enter his mountain, he wears a robe of vermilion radiance, a canopy crown, and bears the Seal of the Three Courts. He rides a ceremonial chariot, accompanied by a host of spirits to welcome you.

The Envoy of Lushan, appointed by the Yellow Emperor, holds a rank equivalent to the Imperial Censor, presiding over the office of all immortals as the inspector of the Five Peaks. When Daoists enter his mountain, the Envoy wears a crimson and purple robe, a crown of level splendor, and bears the Seal of the Three Heavens’ Perfected Form. He also rides a ceremonial chariot, accompanied by a host of spirits to welcome you.

The Reserve Lord of Huo Mountain, appointed by the Yellow Emperor, serves as the deputy of Mount Heng. Commanding thirty thousand spirits, he regulates the harmonious qi above and succors the common people below, examines and registers all immortals, and issues commands to the water spirits. He is the court of rigorous verification and is obeyed by all spirits. When Daoists enter his domain, the Reserve Lord wears a robe of azure brocade, a crown of Dawning Light, and bears the Jade Staff of the Dao Lord. He may ride a ceremonial chariot or mount a dragon-tiger to welcome you.

The Reserve Lord of Qian Mountain, appointed by the Yellow Emperor, serves as the secondary deputy of Mount Heng, occasionally participating in governance with duties akin to an assistant minister. When entering his mountain, the Reserve Lord wears embroidered robes of purple radiance, a crown of Three Spirits, and bears the Seal of the Vermilion Office. He rides a chariot drawn by a red horned dragon to welcome you.

The lords of the auxiliary mountains of destiny all assist and counsel the peak lords, partaking in governance. When Daoists enter their mountains, the auxiliary lords wear crimson robes, crowns of immortal splendor, and bear the Seal of the Supreme Perfected Form to welcome you, their mounts varying without fixed form.

Dongfang Shuo remarked: The ancient depictions of the Five Peaks’ true forms, beginning with the head and eyes, originated from the Flying Celestial Script of the Eight Assemblies of the Supreme One in the era preceding the Divine Farmer—antedating even the age of bird-track writing. Without translation and explication by immortals, their meaning remains forever unknowable.

Whenever Daoists wish to bear the charts and seek the mountain forms, or complete the transcription of ancient scriptures, they should inscribe this on the exterior before securing them with the talisman. This should be done in the first month, during the establishment of the Tiger (yin), after a seven-day purification fast. Upon completing the transcription in white, perform the libation rites as in the transmission ceremony, though the invocations may be adapted to the individual. Whenever transcribing the scriptures, burn incense to the left and right.

Here concludes the preface and discourse on the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*.
