**The Supreme Esoteric Method of the Jade Bureau of the Left Court of the Great Clarity**
*Compiled by Master Xiaying of Dongshan*

The method of the Jade Bureau of the Left Court of the Great Clarity takes the Central Yellow Lord of the Great Clarity, the Celestial Master of the Supreme Clarity—namely, the Most High Lord Lao—as its teaching master. It also corresponds to the brightest star among the Six Stars of Gouchen, known as the **Celestial August Emperor Yaopo Treasure Lord**.

The "Jade Bureau" refers to the bureau of the Jade Emperor of the Great Clarity. The division into left and right courts distinguishes the offices for male and female officials who receive the method. Its governance extends to the Palace of the Great Clarity and the Supreme Ultimate, overseeing worldly illnesses, water and fire, celestial disasters, human affairs, ghosts and spirits, the Three Primes, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Eight Seas and Nine Provinces—nothing lies beyond its purview. Unlike other methods, it is the method of the immortals of the Great Clarity.

In ancient times, the Immortal Elder of the Great Clarity transmitted it to the Treasure Chastity of the Great Clarity. Treasure Chastity of the Great Clarity then bestowed it upon the Perfected Wang of Donghua, who, upon achieving the Dao and departing the world, became the Left Minister of the Supreme Ultimate. At that time, the method of the Jade Bureau of the Great Clarity was employed to protect the world and save the people.

Now, this compilation of esoteric essentials is presented as a complete text, dispensing with oral instructions, to be transmitted to the descendants of the Wang clan, that they may serve as hereditary masters generation after generation, practicing the method of the Jade Bureau of the Great Clarity. They shall swear an oath to Heaven, seal the pact with cinnabar, and perpetuate the transmission of the method to assist in the transformation of the Dao, bringing blessings to the celestial and human descendants. Though ten thousand years pass and kalpas turn, should the world perish, the method shall endure. If greed, licentiousness, or unvirtuous conduct arise again, the method shall cease to be practiced.

When transmitting the method of the Jade Bureau of the Great Clarity, one must select an auspicious day for fasting and purification, then prostrate and present a memorial. Address the realm of the Great Clarity, the Most High Lord Lao, and the August Emperor of the Golden Watchtower, stating the intent to receive the method. Perform two bows to the master as a memorial.

Next, on a *jiazi* or *gengshen* day, or another auspicious day for cultivating the Dao, enter the chamber facing north and silently pay homage to the Nine Immortal Teaching Masters, the Central Yellow Lord of the Great Clarity. The Celestial Master of the Great Clarity, the Yellow Lord, resides within the Golden Palace of the Supreme Ultimate of the Great Clarity, its golden watchtower enclosing him. Within the human body, he dwells in the Mud-Pill Palace of the Cavern Chamber at midnight, in the left spleen at dawn, and in the lower cinnabar field at dusk. The Yellow Lord has distinct names in the Cavern Chamber, the spleen, and the cinnabar field, as recorded in the superior scriptures and methods.

Visualize entering two inches between your brows, where within the golden palace and yellow watchtower, you behold the Yellow Lord wearing a golden hibiscus crown, his countenance like that of a newborn infant, clad in a yellow brocade robe adorned with dragon and tiger emblems. He sits amidst golden lungs and purple clouds, facing outward. The recipient of the method, now diminished to the size of a lotus seed, stands before the Yellow Lord, kowtowing and entreating to practice the Supreme Method of the Jade Bureau of the Great Clarity, commanding and restraining ghosts and spirits.

Next, visualize the Yellow Lord personally bestowing a jade seal and sash. From between your brows, one thousand two hundred divine youths of the Great Clarity leap forth, arrayed around you at a distance, each clad in embroidered robes and golden armor, their jade axes bristling. Then visualize Tang Ju of the Upper Prime, Li Ju of the Middle Prime, Xu Kangcha of the Lower Prime, Tang Hong of the Upper Prime, Ge Yong of the Middle Prime, and Zhou Wu of the Lower Prime. Additionally, Generals Xu, Li, Yue, Li, Huang, and Wang emerge from your Three Departments, standing to your left and right in golden armor, swords in hand.

Next, visualize the armies of the Great Clarity from the five directions—fifty thousand celestial soldiers and mounted officials—each clad in robes of their respective directional colors, emerging from your five viscera and arraying themselves in formation on all sides. Then visualize within the golden palace a purple cloud like incense smoke rising from the crown of your head, spreading to form a vast purple canopy filling heaven and earth. Above the clouds, the Yellow Lord manifests a nine-foot-tall form, golden in hue, with a beak-like nose, eyebrows five inches long, ears seven inches long, and three lines on his forehead running from top to bottom. His feet bear the Eight Trigrams. He sits upon a divine tortoise as his throne, within a hall of gold and jade, its steps of white silver, his robes woven of five-colored clouds. He wears a tiered crown and wields a sharp-edged sword. One hundred twenty yellow youths attend him; to his left are twelve azure dragons, to his right twenty-six white tigers. Before him stand four vermilion phoenixes, behind him seventy-two dark warriors. Twelve *qiongqi* beasts lead the procession, followed by thirty-six *pixie* spirits. Thunder and lightning surge within, boundless and radiant, as a million celestial soldiers in golden armor stand in solemn array.

At this moment, form the mudra of the Great Clarity—its root lies at the base of the middle finger. Visualize yourself as the Celestial Youth of the Great Clarity, wearing a crown that pierces the heavens, a jade pendant, a sword at your belt, a red brocade robe, and vermilion shoes. Prostrate and declare: *"Your servant [Name], charged with the affairs of the Jade Bureau of the Left Court of the Great Clarity, humbly addresses [matter at hand]. If receiving the method, present a memorial here and proceed to the Yellow Lord. When inscribing talismans, suppressing demons, or summoning spirits, conclude each matter by visualizing the spirits returning to your body."*

From midnight until dawn, the Yellow Lord resides in the Cavern Chamber; at noon and dusk, he dwells in their respective places. Enter the chamber free from defilement, without need for additional rituals. The above visualization is best performed daily, though it may also be done as needed. When lying down, align with the Celestial Dipper; when sitting or standing, constantly contemplate the Northern Dipper, with five-colored clouds covering your head and body.

**Seal of the Teaching Master of the Great Clarity**
**Seal of the Jade Bureau**

Carve the Dipper beneath with jujube wood from a thunderbolt-struck tree, and offer sacrifices on the day of Gengshen. For matters addressed by talismans from the True and Sacred Writ of the Jade Bureau of the Great Clarity, invoke and pray thus:

To the Supreme Venerable Lord of the Golden Portals, Heavenly Emperor of the Great Clarity’s Immortal Realm; the Nine Immortals’ Teaching Master, the Central Yellow Lord and Great Clarity Immortal King; the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven; the Primordial Sovereign of Earth; the Primordial Sovereign of the Jade Emperor; the Perfected Lord of Heavenly Treasures; the Perfected Lord of the Great One; the Left Primordial Lord of the Great One; the Right Primordial Lord of the Great One; the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper; the Divine Lord of Heavenly Commission; and the Heavenly Youth of the Great Clarity.

To the twelve hundred Divine Officers of the Great Clarity, the twelve hundred Immortal Youths of the Great Clarity, and all the true gods, generals, and names of the spirits within one’s body:

All memorials, petitions, and documents from the Left Bureau of the Jade Bureau shall first be presented to the Palace of Primordial Generation of the Great One. Urgently request the Earthly Thearchs and their attendants to expedite matters of governance, dispatching the appointed youths of the day for major affairs. Dispatch the Divine Officers, summoning the soldiers and cavalry of the Great Clarity’s Divine Officers and Youths, with twelve hundred as the standard complement. Assess the merit of the petitioner’s virtue and request the descent of an appropriate number to assist in executing the celestial laws. The handling of documents and dispatch of orders follow the protocols of worldly offices, with ranks and measures adjusted as circumstances require, contingent upon the petitioner’s conduct.

Use the celestial script of the Perfected Ones of the Great Clarity.

When the master inscribes talismans, face north on the days of Gengshen or Jiazi, writing in cinnabar. Visualize as prescribed above, and when activating the talisman, recite the Life-Protecting Incantation, which may also be used universally with the Life-Protecting Incantation of the Heavenly Youth of the Supreme Great Clarity:

*"Heaven above gives me life, and I uphold my own words."*

To the recipient, declare: *"You must act with utmost urgency, as decreed by law!"*

The Life-Protecting Talisman of the Heavenly Youth is completed by combining the incantation with the talisman. Write with proper brush technique and ink.

All methods may be adapted or employed as circumstances demand.

The Twenty-Four Talismans of the Supreme Clarity

These twenty-four talismans may all be swallowed, worn, or employed for exorcism, suppression, summoning, and binding—specific applications are noted below. Place them as directed by the master’s instructions.

Whenever inscribing talismans, first visualize one’s own spirit entering the Dipper’s mouth, then manifest the Seven Sovereigns of Heaven, Earth, the Jade Emperor, Heavenly Treasure, Grand Unity, Left Origin, and Right Origin, standing as a subject before the lord. Grind cinnabar and ink without counting, grasp the brush, and silently recite the incantation:

*"Seven Sovereigns, aid my brush to drive away evil and save the myriad spirits!"*
*"Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law!"*

Only then set brush to paper.

**Talisman of the Supreme Clarity’s Lord, the Yellow Elder Lord**
Press the middle joint of the middle finger while visualizing. The spirit is the Heavenly Youth of the Supreme Clarity, with the Yellow Elder seated above the head. Hold the breath, focus the mind, and inscribe in a single stroke.

By command of the Supreme Clarity’s Jade Bureau, the celestial soldiers, mounted officers, numinous officials, and spirit youths—hasten to transmit and bind the qi of illness! The eight evils of the five directions, seize and deliver to Heaven! The Big Dipper’s power subdues the earth spirits.

Let the great gods of the Five Roads capture and bind the lawless dead, the mountain specters of the Five Yous, the descendants of Xiao Wenzhe—fifteen kinds of demonic thieves—cut off their heads, sever their feet, and cast them into the prison of restraint, never to move recklessly again.

*"Slay, slay, slay!"* By the seal of command.
Sealed by the Seven Origins’ Celestial Big Dipper qi.

**Gathering Form**
The Twenty-Four Brush Techniques of the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, Orthodox Unity Perfected Person, inscribed in secret script on stone within the Ghost City Grotto of Mount Qingcheng.

All twenty-four talismans above are to be completed in a single stroke, prizing likeness to their forms. As for the brush’s descent—whether reversing, following, coiling, or bending—adjust up and down, giving and taking, as intention dictates. Observe the speed, weight, and momentum to capture the essence, naming and employing them accordingly.

For example, in the *Sun Crow’s Pecking* technique, visualize one’s hand and brush as the Sun God descending to peck and slay demonic entities. For *Sharp Blade Dispelling Evil*, envision wielding a sword to slash—brush must move swiftly to embody this force.

**Talisman of the Heavenly Commissioner’s Divine Generals for Curing Myriad Evils**
Four talismans transmitted by Master Xuan of the Eastern Florescence King Perfected Person.
All above are universally applicable for curing illness and dispelling evil.

**Hand Seals for Talisman Script**
Press the second finger with the thumb, then the fourth finger, using the thumb to draw qi while pressing the middle joint of the fourth finger.

**Hand Seal for Treating People**
Press the second finger against the upper line of the thumb.

**Hand Seal for Treating Ghosts**
Press the second finger against the lower line of the thumb.

**Oral Formula of the Supreme Clarity Perfected Person**
Constantly visualize the true form of the Yellow Elder Lord, swallow the purple qi from his mouth a hundred times—then ghosts and spirits will fear and submit.

One who knows the Yellow Elder’s inner taboo name may be appointed as a Grand Master of the Great Ultimate, a minister or high official.

When inscribing talismans, draw the true qi of the Yellow Elder, combine it with the Big Dipper’s power, and absorb the red light of the Northern Dipper—then commands and restraints will be as effective as before.

Here concludes the secret essential methods of the Supreme Clarity’s Left Academy.
