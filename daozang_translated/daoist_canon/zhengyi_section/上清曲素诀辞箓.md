**The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Winding Simplicity Formulary and Register**
*Also titled: The Great Writ of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi and the Mysterious Mound*

Transmitted by the Left Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate.
The Most High bestowed it upon the Left Perfected, who in turn conveyed it to the Azure Lad of the Fangzhu Palace in the Eastern Sea, to be transmitted only to those superior adepts whose names are inscribed in jade—those destined to become Perfected Immortals. After wearing it for thirty years, one may behold the Three Primordial Lords and be welcomed by the Sagely Lord in the Golden Towers of Upper Clarity. Every seven hundred years, it may be passed to two recipients.

Within the oratory, one pound of incense is burned. Upon completion of the transmission, the initiate swears a blood oath upon golden silk, substituting for the blood covenant of ascending the altar.

**#1. The Winding Simplicity Formulary**

The Winding Simplicity commands the ghosts of the Six Heavens, enslaves the spirits of the myriad essences, summons the Five Thearchs, governs the Five Marchmounts, seals the rivers and marshes, and calls forth the hundred ghosts. Its formulary subdues the tigers and leopards of the famed mountains, tames the dragons of the hundred rivers, commands the ten thousand ghosts, and drives away the ten thousand perversities.

All the above talismans are to be inscribed in cinnabar.

**The Covenant Formulary**

Three bolts of white silk, thirty feet in length, serve as the covenant of blood and fluid, substituting for the blood oath of the Winding Simplicity. Without purification and solemnity, the register cannot be unbound.

Twenty feet of plain brocade safeguard the covenant of immortals and transcendents, serving as the oath for three transmissions over seven hundred years. When entering peril, water, fire, mountains, or chambers, the register must be worn.

Three pairs of golden rings secure the covenant of great deliverance and eternal life, ensuring the heart’s unobstructed pact. Without this writ, a Daoist may not behold the Lords of the Three Origins.

Nine ounces of incense uphold the covenant of communion with the numinous, forming the pact with the spirits of the unseen. Without it, the ghosts of the Six Heavens cannot be summoned or subdued.

When a man receives the transmission, he faces north while the master faces south. When a woman receives it, she faces south while the master faces north. The submission of documents and offerings must be orally transmitted according to the master’s instructions. At the time of transmission, face north.

For men, after ten years, another purification rite and document submission are required. For women, after ten years, one offering is made.

The register, wine, and dried meats are arranged in a single chamber, invoking the Highest Clarity’s Lofty Perfected, the Radiant Spirit Realized Person, and the Venerable Master of the Celestial Palace to uphold the precepts.

If the recipient receives the register in person, the oral transmission suffices—no written covenant on silk, rings, incense, or bodily oath is needed.

The Highest Clarity’s Lofty Transcendent, the Radiant Cloud Realized Person, initiates the Great Register of Heaven. The Venerable Master of the Celestial Palace bestows it upon the Lords of the Five Marchmounts. Wearing it dispels misfortune, averts calamity, repels evil, expels perversity, shields against myriad essences, disperses the hundred beasts, commands ghostly beings, extends life by ten years, revives the soul, reverses aging, stabilizes the body, and ensures enduring existence. It is also called the *Inevitable Life Contract of the Three Heavens*.

The Venerable Master of the Nine Heavens, accompanied by ten female officials of the White Silk Jade Court, stations them to the left and right of the disciple.

For the above talismans, unless specified by brush and fixed colors, all are to be inscribed in cinnabar.

The *Mysterious Mound Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi*, the *Immortal Regulations of the Venerable Master of the Dark Capital*—after three days of wearing, the transmission is sealed with green silk, three pairs of rings, incense, and silk, pledging before the records of the Year-Star: no negligence, no deceit, no malice, no haste, but the practice of benevolence, the accumulation of virtue, the preservation of spirit, and the contemplation of the real. The bearer of the register is a transcendent.

The *Register of the Seven Origins of the Vast Expanse*
The *Vermilion Script Talisman of the Solar Radiance and Cinnabar Origin*

The *Lunar Radiance Yellow Origin Azure-Script Talisman*
The *Year-Star Vermilion-Script Talisman*
The *Blazing Deluder Yellow-Script Talisman*
The *Great White Black-Script Talisman*
The *Ephemeral Star Azure-Script Talisman*
The *Quelling Star Vermilion-Script Talisman*
The *Vermilion Talisman* (vermilion-script)
The *Vermilion Talisman* (vermilion-script)
The *Black Talisman* (black-script)
The *Orpiment Talisman* (yellow-script)

The above section is to be transcribed and worn by the disciple.

These are based on the sun, moon, and five planets as the Seven Origins, with an additional five talismans corresponding to those in the *Scripture of Dispelling Demons*. However, the *Scripture of Dispelling Demons* contains forty-nine talismans in total, each placed in varying spaces of differing widths. Here, only a few remain, the rest having been lost.

Another yellow talisman is said to originate from the *True Reports*, described as the *Talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, Commanding the Northern Emperor of Fengtai Peak*, found in the *Scripture of the Jade Horse*. The details remain unclear.

Otherwise, the talismans of the Seven Origins are roughly described in transmitted scriptures with methods for their application, though this is a manual for wearing them, hence no further explanation is given. It is fitting to follow the *True [Reports]*, inscribing them in mixed colors upon varied silks, receiving and wearing them.

One account of the *Command of Fengtai Peak* states in the talismanic decrees: "Whoever carries this talisman shall enclose it in a layered purple pouch and wear it upon the head."

The Nine Stars’ inner taboo and hidden secret names are as follows:
The Nine Stars’ taboo names are all inscribed in vermilion.

The Nine Sovereigns’ inner taboos on the right are to be kept secret by the recipient, transmitted orally at the river’s mouth as true esoterica.³ The Nine Openings Star Chart, along with pacing the hours and meditative visualization, should be practiced at dawn and dusk—first knocking the teeth nine times, then silently intoning the names of the stars:

First, the essence of the Supreme Star, named *Dark Pivot*.
May this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, riding the void and mounting the floating.

Second, the essence of the Primordial Star, named *Northern Terrace*.
May this disciple’s body attain flying immortality, roaming the grotto-chambers.

Third, the essence of the Perfected Star, named *Northern Culmen Supreme Perfected*.
