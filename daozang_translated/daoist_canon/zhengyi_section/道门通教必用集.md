The Celestial Master established his teachings in the Western Shu, while Guangcheng attained final repose in Yizhou, hence the people of Shu revered the Dao in great splendor and observed its rites meticulously.

Upon examining the traditions passed down by the various lineages, it was found that there were no authoritative editions, and errors were indeed numerous.

Recently, observing the completion of the Zhongzang Canon, I encountered Liu Gong of the Left History Bureau and Zhu Gong of the Tai Chang Office, both officials in the capital. Li Gong of the Two Rivers, a disciple of the Master of the Daoist Lineage, requested that I obtain several hundred Daoist scriptures from the capital, all of which were texts missing from Shu.

Among them, ritualistic liturgy was predominant, so I commissioned Master Taigu to compare and reconcile their differences, to examine antiquity and distinguish the present.

From the foundational teachings for novices to the advanced rites of practice, he meticulously compiled them into a collection for the benefit of future generations, coinciding with my tenure as the Yellow Arrow Register of the Two Rivers.

Scholars and practitioners from all directions gathered in homage, and thus the texts were engraved upon wooden tablets for all to share.

I have often lamented my inability to contribute, as some merely stand by with folded arms, while others mock or even suppress these teachings, unwilling to utter a single word to my disciples.

Is this not contrary to the Celestial Master’s intent, which was to foster growth and abundance? If the Daoist lineage lacks scriptures, should not those who share this vision strive to emulate the spirit of Zhengyi and Guangcheng, thereby upholding the grand tradition?

In the summer of the year *Jiaxu* of the *Jiatai* era, Master Lü Yuansu of Jiangyuan, the recluse of the Northern Peak, composed this work.

In ancient times, the Son of Heaven sacrificed to Heaven and Earth, communing with the divine, all with solemn rites—pure offerings, meticulous attire, preliminary fasting, and then the full observance, lest the ritual fail to honor the spirits and the sacrifice be incomplete. How much more so for commoners?

Thus, the Celestial Master expounded the scriptures and established precepts, prioritizing compassion over killing. Following this, the Celestial Master established his teachings, transforming sacrifices into *zhaijiao* rites, mirroring Heaven and Earth, offering reverence, reciting scriptures, and dispatching talismans to convey prayers, all to elevate grand rituals and refine pure sacrifices.

Therefore, hymns and odes were composed to praise the Daoist temples, where words became music, and it was said that sound could reach the divine, invoking blessings from above and below. The *Changxu* (recitation of talismans) and *Yongdong* (chanting of scriptures) were derived from this principle, and their essence was unchanging.

Since the Celestial Master’s establishment of his teachings, those among the Daoist lineage who focused on ritualistic precepts often neglected the study of sound, while those who mastered sound often lacked the full complement of ritualistic observances.

This is akin to Gongshu Bu’s skill—without the compass and square, how could he measure the perfect circles and squares?

In the Song dynasty, the Lü family of Helin compiled the Daoist scriptures, gathering their mysteries into a collection they titled *The Comprehensive Teachings Collection* (通教集).

From the imperial court to the common folk, for the sake of the nation, the family, the living, and the dead, those who practiced *zhao* (ritual fasting) and *jiao* (exorcism) revered Daoist teachings universally, all finding partial illumination.

It was also to ensure that students of the Dao would master the precepts through ritualistic discipline, thereby comprehending its teachings. His intent was indeed broad.

He Gong of Yuntai further elucidated these principles, enabling practitioners to refine and master the rituals, and compiled *The Refined Teachings Collection* (炼教集), which has since circulated widely.

Within these two collections, there are mutual strengths and weaknesses, and those who study them cannot help but raise questions.

Now, Master Ma Daoyi of Jincheng’s Three Wells Observance, who has long resided among the Daoist elite, has devoted years to the study of ritualistic texts without ever abandoning them.

Thus, he merged *The Comprehensive Teachings Collection* (通教集) and *The Refined Teachings Collection* (炼教集), selecting their finest elements, categorizing them into a single volume, and engraved it for wider dissemination.

He entrusted me with a preface to explain his purpose. I replied: In matters of scholarship, I have always taken care. Within the realm of ritual teachings, my knowledge has been neglected for many years.

Yet you have taken this as a teaching, and I dare not fail to encourage its completion for the sake of its beauty.

Students of the Dao may use this to understand its standards, and those with noble aspirations may practice it to commune with the divine.

This is indeed a grand event for the Daoist lineage—who could not rejoice in it?

In the mid-autumn of the *Yuan Zheng* year, Master Han Hongcheng, the Senior Lecturer of Ren’an Observance and the Great Master of Proliferating the Dao and Awakening to Truth, respectfully composed this preface.

**Essential for the Daoist Comprehensive Teachings Collection (通教集):**
At the outset of seeking the Dao, one must first seek its standards. Those who take vows must possess the complete scriptures and precepts.

From the Han dynasty to the present, all who upheld the lineage and established teachings followed the Celestial Master’s model, and their practices can serve as exemplary standards. Thus, the first section is established as *Standards of the Celestial Master*:

- *Scriptures and Precepts of the Celestial Master’s Ascetic Life*
- *Brief Biographies of Successive Masters*

For novices entering the Dao, the hymns of response must come first, from the *Opening Hall* to the *Farewell to the Sage*, all can be praised and recorded in the ritual scriptures.

At the beginning of initiation, one may lack a good edition, hence the second section is established as *Verbal Praises*:

- *Words of the Step-into-Void Rite and Praises*
- *True-Writing Talismans for Invoking All Kinds of Perfected Ones*
- *True-Writing Talismans for Disaster Dispersion in the Five Directions*
- *Twelve Vows of Mindful Retention*

---

「As the child grows into maturity, instruction in phonetics and metrics follows, with single-tone recitation and chanting to assist in ritual practice. Yet errors in transmission and repetition may lead to crude and unrefined imitation—all such flaws must be corrected to achieve precision and solemnity. Thus, the third section is established as *Chants and Praises*:

- *Five-Directional Protective Spirits' Incantations*
- *Chapter on the Five Kalpas of the Living Corpse*
- *Outer Altar Chants and Praises*
- *Legal Bridge Texts*
- *Two Chapters for the Departed to Take Refuge in the Triple Gem and Repent Sins*
- *Comforting the Departed and Offering Farewell Texts»

In the fourth section, the *Step-into-Void* (originally), the current edition removes the *Step-into-Void* and refines the *Teachings, Invocations, and Petitions* section. Included are:

- *Petitions and Declarations to the Celestial Official*
- *Incense Offerings at the Imperial Desk*
- *Post-Incense Mindful Entry*
- *Declarations to the Altar*
- *Texts for the Yellow Arrow Rite After Incense Offerings*
- *Five Masters' Host Petitions*
- *Establishing the Altar and Igniting the Furnace*
- *Petitions Before the Five Masters at the Rite’s Commencement*
- *Yellow Arrow Rite’s Three Times National Petition to the Master*
- *Original Commandment Scripture*
- *True Martial Scripture*
- *Peaceful Abode Scripture*
- *Crown Talisman’s Commencement, Necessarily Requires Praise and Assistance*

Inner and outer ritual affairs are not confined to a single path—some texts may be incomplete, and some originals may contain errors. For beginners, caution is advised, selecting the best and following it. Thus, the fifth section is established as *Assistants and Praises*:

- *Three-Day Lamentation Scripture*
- *Yellow Arrow Rite Petitions and Repentance for Dispersal*

**Dispersing Calamities and Illuminating True Repentance**
- *Opening the Five Directions Scripture*
- *Threefold Invitation Scripture*

**Ritual of Blessing Food and Bathing Ceremony**
- *The Office of Elevation and Display*
  - *Division of Ceremonial Authority*
  - *Rhythm and Meter, Detailed and Refined*
  - *Harmony and Eloquence, Exemplified by Guangcheng’s Writings*
  - *Established as a Special Discipline*
  - *Requiring the Right Person to Move the Assembly*
  - *Thus, the Sixth Section is Established as the **Praise and Guidance Chapter***
    - *Du Tian Shi’s Preface to the Daoist Praise and Ceremony*
    - *Ritual of Opening the Altar*
    - *Ritual of Host Petitions*
    - *Ritual of the Daoist Procession*
    - *Various Repentance Rites and Their Methods*
    - *Ritual of Turning the Sutra*
    - *Ritual of the Fasting Hall*
    - *Ritual of Offerings for Merit and Expiatory Rites*
    - *Anciently Called "威仪" (Awe-Inspiring Ceremonies), Now Known as "都讲" (Grand Lectures)*
    - *A Single Altar’s Rhythm Follows the Previous Section*
    - *Imperial Edicts for Water Stewardship and Strict Adherence*
    - *Opening the Sutra and Praise—All Are Critical*
    - *Yet Many Errors Persist*
    - *Thus, the Seventh Section is Established as the **Ceremonial Awe Chapter***
      - *Imperial Edict for Altar Rituals*
      - *Nine-Times Invitation of the Sutra*
    - *The High Master’s Duties*
      - *Daoist Virtue and Ceremonial Awe*
      - *Summons and Solemn Reflection*
      - *All Spirits Attend in Reverence*
      - *Each Has Its Own Ritual Regulations*
      - *Examined from Predecessors*
      - *Compiled into One Section for Study*
      - *Thus, the Eighth Section is Established as the **Precision Reflection Chapter***
        - *Method of Issuing Imperial Edicts*
        - *Announcing Matters and Explanations*

**Elevation of the Platform and Ritual Announcements**
- **Morning and Night Incantations at the Gates**
- **Ritual for Honoring the Master and Cultivating Mindfulness**

- **Proclamation and Recitation of the *Taiqing* Titles and Songs**
- **Seal of the Seven Primordial Symbols and Their Announcements**
- **Symbol of the Celestial Gate: Gathering and Dispersing Forms with Incantations**

The above eight sections are all drawn from Daoist scriptural canons and meticulously examined through the teachings of past masters and renowned scholars of recent times. Compiled into one volume, no presumption is made, lest later sages be misled. If kept as a private family secret, it would not be a universal doctrine. Therefore, it is engraved upon wood to share with fellow students, serving as an essential guide for transmitting the Dao and saving others.

Do not lightly impart this to uninitiated laypersons, lest you invite regret. For if this collection is even slightly comprehensive, they may abandon their original path, devoting themselves to this instead—only to meet ruin later, inviting censure and blame.

As for the profound teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, or the methods of Golden Elixir cultivation, those who follow the Dao must each have their share. This is not the Dao’s presence in the world, but rather the imperial institutional framework. The enlightened will surely recognize this truth.

Composed in the late summer of the *Xinyou* year of the *Jiatai* era (1201) by the Daoist Lu Taigu of Hèlín Yuan, a native of Jiàn’ān.

**Volume One of the *Daoist Universal Teachings Collection***
**Lu Taigu’s *Hèlín Collection***
**The *Jīnshì* Chapter**
**The *Tàishàng Out-Home Sutra Instructions***

The *Sutra of the Causes and Conditions for Leaving Home* states: The Daoists have seven stages in total. The Celestial Venerable says:

1. **Celestial Purity**—that is, the body harmonizes with Nature, and the inner and outer are perfectly tranquil.
2. **Divine Immortals**—that is, transformations beyond measure, transcending the realm of the ordinary.
3. **Secluded Elegance**—that is, containing light and hiding brilliance, unburdened by worldly entanglements.
4. **Mountain Dwellers**—that is, secluded in study of the Dao, with wisdom and benevolence naturally at ease.
5. **Those Who Leave Home**—that is, abandoning all attachments to the world, casting off the dust and clamor of mortal life.
6. **Those Who Remain in the World**—that is, blending with the world’s light, embracing the Dao and nurturing virtue.
7. **Sacrificial Attendants**—that is, humbling oneself among the vulgar, rescuing and delivering those in peril.

Thus, the term *Daoist* refers to one who, in all actions—moving, standing, sitting, or lying down—every thought and intention is devoted solely to cultivating the Dao and attending to virtue. They observe fasts and pay homage, chant scriptures and burn incense, uphold precepts and refine their conduct, light lamps for repentance, make offerings with sincere vows, expound the Great Vehicle, and guide all beings. They awaken the great mind of the Dao, create boundless merit, benefit all without distinction, and always place others before themselves, free from worldly toil. Their sole pursuit is the Dao’s work, and thus they are revered as the most exalted among the Six Paths and Fourfold Existence—both heavenly and earthly. They do not bow to the Son of Heaven nor salute the feudal lords, becoming fields of blessing for humankind and the refuge for the Three Realms.

The **Seventeen Vows of Daoist Aspiration for Leaving Home and Attaining the True Body**:
1. I vow never to kill living beings, for it severs the sacred lineage.
2. I vow forever to abstain from alcohol, for it corrupts pure nature.
3. I vow forever to abstain from blood, for it defiles the body.
4. I vow not to consume the five pungent herbs, for they obstruct the paths of Heaven and Earth.
5. I vow not to indulge in lustful desires, for they disturb the mind.
6. I vow not to speak of others’ faults, for it invites hatred.
7. I vow not to covet wealth, for it hinders the Dao.
8. I vow to diligently cultivate merit, for it adorns oneself.
9. I vow not to disturb or anger others, for it breeds karmic enmity.
10. I vow to benefit others without hesitation, for it is no different from benefiting myself.
11. I vow forever to speak no falsehoods, for it makes others distrustful.
12. I vow never to grow weary or negligent, for it dulls the resolve of the Dao.
13. I vow to study all methods with effort, for it ripens the wisdom of the seed.
14. I vow never to steal from others, for it demands double repayment.
15. I vow to always observe inner fasting, for it attains pure harmony of mind.
16. I vow to constantly reflect upon the emptiness and tranquility of all dharmas, for it swiftly advances the Dao.
17. I vow to always be humble and silent as the foolish, for it ensures inner peace.

All the above vows are upheld by novices who enter the Dao.

The *Sutra of Ascending the Mysterious* states: The Daoist’s conduct is entirely opposite to that of the common person. Their eyes do not gaze excessively, nor are they startled by beauty. Their ears do not listen to slander nor to chaotic sounds. Their noses do not inhale fragrant scents, nor do they relish the pungent stench of decay. Their mouths do not crave sweetness, nor do they consume what violates all life. Their hearts do not dwell on desires, whether for wealth, sensual pleasures, or honor. Their hands do not act deceitfully, nor do their feet tread upon evil.

The *Sutra of Ascending the Mysterious* also states: All who leave home must discard ornamentation and fine attire, wearing only coarse cloth and simple garments, dwelling in lowly beds and modest huts—merely to sustain their bodies. They must not indulge in luxury. Except for treating illness or traveling, they may not seek permission to go outside. They must reside in clean, secluded places, indulging in the Dao’s subtle and boundless joys. This is called the **threshold of hearing the Dao** and the **foundation of great virtue**.

The *Sutra of Fixing the Will* states: In the past, there was a youth of twelve who lived in idle pleasure, preparing fine food together, drinking deeply and reveling in games. Sometimes they would debate whether the practice of the Dao and the upholding of precepts were difficult or easy. The Celestial Venerable, in great tranquility, perceived them and knew that in their previous lives, each had been a teacher to others, hoarding scriptures and grudgingly sharing them, causing their disciples to hesitate. Now, they had fallen into the dust of the world through this slight cause, yet still could be saved. The Celestial Venerable then transformed into a mortal man, passing through their gathering and overhearing their conversation. The man said: *"Upholding precepts is very easy; not upholding them is far more difficult."* The youth, hearing this, asked in unison: *"How so, sir? You say upholding precepts is easy, yet not upholding them is difficult?"* The man replied: *"Standing upright like a precept is easy—one need not fear the Son of Heaven nor the spirits and gods. But breaking a precept is difficult: such a person fears all mortals and fears the spirits and gods even more. How could it not be difficult?"* Thus, the twelve youth, upon hearing the man’s words, all recalled their past lives, resolved to uphold precepts, and together attained the fruit of the Dao.

The *Sutra of the Dharma Wheel* states: The Celestial Venerable of Oneness and Mystery instructed Ge Xian Gong, saying: *"In my past, I received my teacher’s instruction with utmost severity. The lessons cut deep as a knife, stung like a poisoned thorn. I bowed and knelt in service, never daring to slacken, never daring to refuse the pain or speak of the poison. Now that I have attained the fruit of the Dao, I cannot repay my teacher’s kindness."*

The *Great True Precepts* state: Daoists must first master the **Five Thousand Characters** of scriptural study. They must expound and comprehend the teachings, guide others, and benefit themselves, opening boundless enlightenment. This is the mark of the **Great Vehicle Practitioner**.

The *Great True Precepts* also state: At the dawn of creation, the **Sage-True Immortals** all proclaimed the Dao’s *qi* and established laws, passing them down through generations. They shared the same lineage as the Celestial Venerable, all called **Learned Masters**. Their work was the Dao, and their devotion to the Dao bore fruit, earning them the title of *Daoist*.

The *Sutra of Illuminating the Threat* states: **Study must never be superficial**, for false and true teachings may appear similar. One must not fail to discern them, for failure leads to perilous paths, while clarity grants ease. The difference between clarity and obscurity lies in the mind’s careful examination. The method of discernment is to **pervasively study all scriptures**, test them through experience, and verify their truth. Thus, one naturally attains luminous understanding—whether of worldly or transcendent laws, of actions with or without purpose. One will naturally fathom the subtleties of the **Three Pure Ones**.

**Brief Transmission of the Lineage Across Generations**:
The Daoist teachings are ancient. **Huangdi and Laozi** championed the Way of **Purity and Stillness**. The disciples **Yin Ling, Zhang Tao, Lie Yukou, and Zhuangzi** expanded upon it, and the tradition flowed down to **Le Su Gong**. Gong taught **Ge Xian Gong**, and Ge Xian Gong taught **Cao Can**.

The efficacy of these words in governing the world is as described—how much more so the Dao of **Huang-Lao**!

Alas, the world now indulges in extravagance and excess, and thus this Way grows hidden. The study of **immortality and transcendence** flourishes, and rites of supplication and sacrifice thrive. From the Eastern Han onward, until the beginning of the **Sui Dynasty**, **Pengqiuzi Jia Shanheng** and over a hundred others proclaimed this Way to the world, compiling *The High Dao Transmission*. From these, I have selected the most distinguished ten or so, distilling their essence and appending them to the scriptural teachings, so that my disciples may know whom to emulate and revere.

**Zhang Tian师**
Tian师 bore the surname Zhang, given name **Dao Ling**, and courtesy name **Fu Han**. By nature, he was silent and revered antiquity, mastering both scriptures and histories while also excelling in **celestial omens and divination**. He relieved the urgent needs of others without distinction of familiarity or distance, and thus the world esteemed him, drawing many to his discipleship. When the **Emperor Zhang** summoned him, he declined, sighing as he parted from his disciples—only **Wang Chang** remained to attend him. He then retreated to **Qian** and **Heng**, reaching **Zhongyue Mountain**, where he obtained the **Nine Elixir Scriptures**. Upon refining the elixir, he told Chang: *"I have yet to fulfill a great deed—how dare I hastily consume it? I must first benefit the state and family, eliminating harm and promoting good, before I may act lightly."* Thus, he moved the **Celestial Sovereign** to descend, granting him the **All-One Alliance and Awe** methods, subduing the **hosts of demons and jade maidens**, and establishing **twenty-four administrative precincts**. He taught people to confess sins and apportion blessings, instituting systematic precepts. The people of Shu were transformed, abandoning vice and fleeing crime. Later, upon **Yuntai Peak**, the Celestial Sovereign dispatched a **cloud-chariot** to descend and welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

**Ge Xian Gong**
Xian Gong bore the surname Ge, given name **Xuan**, and courtesy name **Xiao Xian**. From his youth, he loved learning, mastering all **scriptures, histories, and classics**, and his fame spread across the **Jiangzuo region**. He often played the zither and recited **Zhuangzi and Laozi**, content and serene, needing nothing within. He then entered **Chicheng Mountain** to cultivate the Dao, later wandering through **Kuaiyang, Luofulou, Jinjing, Hezao, Yushi, and Tiantai Mountains**, refining his practice and recitations. Thus, he was visited by the **Three Pure Ones of the Supreme Polarity**, who bestowed upon him the **Three Cavern Treasure Scriptures**. At eighteen, he achieved Dao-completion, his transformations beyond measure. He compiled the essentials of the Three Caverns into the *Nine Abyssal Confessions* and authored over ten volumes on **Laozi and other scriptures**. One day, he told his disciples **Zheng Siyuan** and others: *"The Wu ruler detains me, preventing me from reciting the Cavern Scriptures. I must first achieve **corpse dissolution**, then ascend to heaven."* When the time came, his body softened like silk, filling the room with fragrant qi. By the fifth day, a great wind arose, extinguishing all lamps. When the fire was lit, his corpse had vanished.

**Wang Zuan**
The Daoist **Wang Zuan** resided on **Maji Mountain**, often performing **meritorious deeds in secret** to save others. During the late **Western Jin**, as the Central Plains fell into chaos, famine, pestilence, and disease ravaged the people, many perishing without relief. Moved by pity, Zuan composed a **petition in seclusion**, weeping profusely. After three nights, light filled his chamber as at noon. Soon, auspicious winds and clouds gathered in the sky, strange fragrances and celestial music descended to his courtyard, accompanied by **banners and flags**, **green boys and jade maidens**, and **dragons and tigers** as guards. Suddenly, the sounds of **mouth organs and flutes** came from the northwest. Amidst five-colored light, a **celestial official** announced to Zuan: *"The Dao Sovereign of the Celestial Sovereign arrives."* A **treasure-seat** then descended from the sky, and the Dao Sovereign took his place. Zuan knelt and prostrated himself before him. The Dao Sovereign said: *"You pitied the living, your petition sincere, your heart laid bare—this moved both the seen and unseen. The earthly officials have reported you, and I have come to observe."* The Dao Sovereign then expounded on **the cycles of yin and yang**, the **ascents and descents of humans and spirits**, the **Six Heavens’ demons and fallen generals**, who preyed on the weak, seizing opportunities to harm the living. *"I have subdued them with solar might and divine incantations, and their chaos has naturally ceased."* He then commanded his attendants to grant Zuan the **Scriptures of Divine Transformation and Divine Incantations**, along with the **Three-Five Fast Precepts**, saying: *"Diligently practice these—true stages may yet be attained."* As Zuan traveled through **Jiangbiao**, the plagues ceased.

**Lu Tian师**
Lu **Xiujing**, courtesy name **Yuande**,

The Dao Sovereign said: *"Your steadfast devotion to tombs and classics, your wide exploration of symbols and celestial omens—this is admirable. Yet you sighed, declaring: 'I wish to refine my form and merge with the Dao, to attain harmony with Heaven and complete my destiny, but this is not what you mean.' Thus, you devoted yourself exclusively to Daoist teachings, never ceasing in your studies, even in sleep. When you heard of a master of strange arts, though distant, you would seek them out. Dwelling in the rugged peaks of Jing, the people of Jiang and Han would come to listen, arriving empty-handed but returning with true understanding.

By the end of the Song dynasty’s **Yuanjia** era, Emperor Wen could not summon you. But when Emperor Ming ascended, desiring to bring **purity and stillness** to guide the people toward simplicity and sincerity, he deeply admired you. Thus, he repeatedly invited you, and you finally accepted the imperial command to descend from the mountains. Bears, tigers, monkeys, and birds lamented along the road, their sorrowful cries echoing—such was your influence on all things.

Upon reaching the capital, you were lodged in a guesthouse outside the palace gates, allowing both officials and commoners to receive instruction from you. You then clarified the distinctions between **heresy and orthodoxy**, examining and verifying the authenticity of teachings. From this, the corrupt customs of the age transformed in unison. You once blended the **Three Caverns’ scriptures and methods**, but later corrected and refined them.

You also composed **rituals for fasting and purification**, establishing them as enduring precepts for future generations. Your friendship with **Tao Yuanming**, a fellow **outsider to formal ranks**, reveals much of your character.

In the fifth year of **Yuanhui**, on the first month, you suddenly told your disciples: 'I am pressed by imperial favor, forced to abandon my lifelong resolve. Now I shall return to my old mountain retreat.' Your disciples were astonished. On the second day of the third month, you quietly ascended, your skin radiant and luminous, a fragrant scent lingering in the air. Three days later, your disciples on Lushan saw a carriage adorned with **rainbow-colored banners**, and in an instant, you vanished, returning to your former abode.

The emperor posthumously conferred the title **Simple and Tranquil Master** upon you.

**Kao Tian师**
**Kao Qianzhi**, courtesy name **Fuzhen**,

At eighteen, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Dao, his spirit subtly attuned to the **Supreme Mysteries**. There was a **Celestial Master**, Cheng Gongxing, who took him as a servant in his household. One day, as Kao Qianzhi calculated the **cosmic resonances** of the **Five Phases** and **Six Qi**, he found the **Celestial Patterns** misaligned. Gongxing instructed him, and with a single adjustment, it was perfected. After some time, Gongxing said to him: *"The Daoist Master has the will to cultivate the Way—perhaps you and I may withdraw together."* He then took him to **Hua Mountain**, where they gathered herbs for sustenance. From that point on, Qianzhi never again felt hunger. One day, he said: *"I shall depart, but someone will bring you medicine."* He ate it, and indeed, it was as he had spoken. Upon examining the herbs, they were foul and venomous—poisonous creatures and noxious substances. He grew fearful and left. Gongxing returned and explained, sighing: *"The Daoist Master is not yet ready for transcendence, but he may become a teacher for kings."* He added: *"I shall depart tomorrow."* True to his word, he ascended at the appointed time. Qianzhi then settled in **Songyang**, never emerging again.

In the second year of **Shenrui**, on the first day of the fourth month, two men suddenly arrived, riding dragons and bearing **auspicious banners**, declaring: *"The **Celestial Worthy** has come."* In an instant, the **Most High** descended in a **Nine-Dragon Jade Chariot**, surrounded by divine attendants, gathering atop the mountain. Qianzhi bowed in reverent devotion. The **Most High** commanded **Wang Fangping** to bring Qianzhi forward, saying: *"I have received the **Celestial Register of the Central Peak’s Gathering of Immortals**, which states that since **Zhang Daoling** attained **True Perfection**, those who cultivate the Way have lacked a true teacher. Now there is the **Daoist of the Central Peak, Kao Qianzhi**, whose conduct aligns with **Natural Principle**. He should be placed in the **Master’s rank**, and thus I entrust you with the **Celestial Master’s mission**, along with the **Cloud-Middle Chanting**—the **Precious Scripture of the **Harmonious Precepts** and the **Newly Codified **Void-Wandering** Rituals**. You must proclaim them, assist the empire, and transform the people."* After Qianzhi accepted, the **Five-Cloud Platform Hall** vanished. From then on, his resolve and conduct grew ever more refined.

During the **Shiji** era, the imperial court sent officials to summon him to the capital. **Sima Chengzhi**, the **Grand Tutor**, became his disciple, and the emperor himself knelt before him, asking questions with the utmost reverence. A **Celestial Altar** was erected in his honor, and thus the entire realm turned to him in veneration. The **Celestial Master** once performed rites at the **Central Peak** for the emperor’s blessings, and through his profound sincerity, the **Most High** secretly bestowed upon the emperor the title **Emperor of True Peace**. That year, the era was renamed **True Peace, First Year**.

By the ninth year, he told his disciples: *"I dreamed of Cheng Gongxing, who summoned me to the **Celestial Palace of the Central Peak**."* In the fifth month, he **ascended in spirit**, with a **green vapor** like mist emanating from his mouth, rising to the heavens before dissipating. His body gradually shrank, and those who understood it called it **corpse dissolution**. He lived to eighty-four. Later, **Shen You** saw him atop the **Central Peak**, his body radiant silver, shining like the sun—thus proving him to be an **Immortal**.

**Celestial Master Wang Daoyi**
Wang Daoyi, a **Daoist** of the **Wei Dynasty**, was well-versed in all scriptures and mastered the **divinatory classics**. Learning of the **Empress Yin’s retreat** at **Zhongnan**, he came with six or seven disciples to dwell there, joining **Daoist Yin Lingjian** and forty others in spreading the **Great Dao’s transformation**. Though times were famine-stricken and provisions scarce, Daoyi expanded the **observatory halls** with hundreds of artisans, yet expenses never faltered. All knew it was due to the **Master’s divine influence**, as if secretly aided by the **Celestial**. Thus, every **pavilion and hall** was renewed.

He ordered his disciples to gather **True Scriptures**, amassing over ten thousand volumes—all through his own efforts, never seeking aid from others. His nature was boundless and unencumbered; even in his inner chambers, those who eavesdropped on his disciples found only **gathered Immortals** in speech. During the **Yongping** era, as he was about to **ascend**, white clouds and strange fragrances filled the room, lingering for days. A villager returning from afar saw Daoyi depart riding a **deer**.

**Master of Rectification, Sima Chengzhen**
Sima Chengzhen, courtesy name **Zimwei**, served **Pan Shizheng** and mastered the **Alchemy of the Form**. His teacher, recognizing his extraordinary nature, fully transmitted the **Dao of Tao Yuanming’s Rectification**. After some time, he declined and wandered the sacred peaks. Arriving at **Tiantai**, he built a **multi-tiered pavilion** on the altar, naming it the **Pavilion of Universal Marvels**.

The **Empress Wu** summoned him, but he soon departed. He was counted among the **Ten Friends of the Daoist Sect**, alongside **Chen Zhi’ang, Lu Zangyong, Song Zhiwen, Wang Shi, Bi Gou, Li Bai, Meng Haoran, Wang Wei, and He Zhizhang**.

The **Emperor Ruizong** summoned him again, commanding his brother **Sima Chengyi** to deliver the imperial edict, insisting he come. Upon arrival, he was led into the **inner palace**, where the emperor questioned him on his arts. The Master replied: *"Cultivating the Dao is daily subtraction, until one reaches **non-being**—what the vulgar eyes and ears perceive. Each subtraction is already difficult; how much more so to attack heterodoxies and inflate one’s cleverness?"*

The emperor asked: *"This applies to refining one’s self, but how does it govern the realm?"*
The Master answered: *"The realm is but an extension of the self. Thus, one must **harmonize the mind with stillness**, **blend the qi with emptiness**, let **things follow their nature**, and abandon all **private scheming**—then the realm will be governed."*

The emperor sighed: *"The words of **Broad-Nurturing Child**!"*
He then requested permission to return to the mountains, receiving a **jewel-veined lute** and a **cloud-patterned robe** as gifts. The emperor ordered officials to compose poems in farewell.

The **Emperor Xuanzong** decreed the construction of **altars and chambers** on **Wangwu Mountain** for his residence. At that time, **Jiao Jingzhen**, a **Female Immortal** of the **Mohe**, sailed to **Penglai** in search of a teacher. Upon reaching a mountain, she was told by a **Daoist** that *"Sima Zimwei of Tiantai Mountain is renowned in the **Jade Hall**, dwelling in **Chicheng**—he is truly a noble teacher."* Jingzhen returned to receive the Dao from the Master and soon ascended.

Once, descending to speak with **Xue Jichang**, he said: *"The Master has attained the Dao higher than **Tao Dunshui**; he shall become the **Eastern Heaven’s Pure and Clear True Person**."* One day, the Master suddenly told his **grass-clad disciples**: *"From the **Jade Mist Peak’s east**, I see **Penglai’s** Immortals descending. Now the **Eastern Heaven’s Green Boy Lord** summons me—I must go."* In an instant, he ascended.

The emperor posthumously honored him as **Silver Green Light-Lucre Grand Official**, with the posthumous title **Master of Rectification**. The emperor himself inscribed his stele.

Among his works, the *Secrets of True Cultivation*, *Diagram of the Celestial Treasury*, *Treatise on Sitting-Forgetting*, and *System of Ascension* circulate in the world.

Li Han Guang
The Daoist Li Han Guang, at the age of thirteen, was deeply devoted to Daoist learning. Though in seclusion, he conducted himself as if before sovereign and father. Skilled in seal and clerical scripts, men praised him as surpassing his own father. Once he heard the Dao, he never again engaged in worldly affairs.

His master, Master Sima Zhengyi, upon seeing him, declared: *"He is indeed a guest of the True Celestial Purity."* He admonished him: *"Hold fast to emptiness, accumulate no attachments, and your Way shall know no end. Entrust yourself to the hidden peaks and efface your traces—your virtue is profound."* Thus, he entrusted him with all his sacred texts, bidding him first save others.

Han Guang, having received this teaching, forgot himself in the Dao and aided others in their needs. Whenever he conducted rituals, he purified his heart and body without slacking. The Tang Emperor Minghuang summoned him to inquire about his practices, and he replied: *"The Dao De Jing is the sovereign’s teacher. When the Han Emperor Wen practiced it, he elevated the people to benevolent longevity."*

The emperor further asked about the Golden Cauldron, and he answered: *"The Dao and its virtue are public. Lightness of action is private within the public—if one seeks life while indulging desires, it is like harnessing the wind; how difficult!"*

The emperor praised him and treated him with great honor. Soon after, Han Guang requested to return to Jùqū. The emperor established the Zǐyáng Observatory for his residence.

When the emperor received the *True Scripture of Blessings and Auspiciousness*, he again requested Han Guang as his teacher, but he declined, offering his refusal from the Dàtóng Hall. The emperor posthumously honored him as **Master Xuánjìng**, and his works *The Transmission of Immortal Learning* and *On the Differences and Similarities of the Celestial Mysteries* circulate in the world.

At eighty-seven, he told his disciples: *"I shall go to Mount Mao."* He then ascended in due time, with auspicious clouds descending and elixir grasses sprouting. His rank was that of an Immortal Official of Mount Mao.

Wu Zongyuan
Wu Jun, styled **Zhēnjié**,

「Mastered the *Classics of Dao* and refined eloquent prose. Though he failed to pass the *Jìnshì* examinations, he departed to dwell at Yǐdì Mountain. In the early years of *Tiānbǎo*, he was summoned to the capital, where he petitioned to be enrolled among the *Daoists*, studying under Master Pàn Shīzhèng. He journeyed south to *Tiāntái*, gazed upon the *Cānghǎi*, and consorted with eminent scholars, whose literary works spread back to the capital.

Emperor *Mínghuáng* summoned him and conversed with great delight, commanding him to serve as a *Hànlín* scribe and presenting him with three essays on the *Xuángāng*. The emperor inquired about the Dao, and he replied: *"None surpass Laozi in profound understanding of the Dao; Your Majesty may seek it within the *Wǔqiān Wén*."* When further questioned about the arts of *shénxiān* (immortals) and alchemical cultivation, he answered: *"This is the concern of rustics, not of a sovereign—it is unwise for rulers to dwell upon such matters."*

Yet whenever he spoke, his discourse centered on *orthodox teachings* and worldly affairs, employing subtle language to admonish and advise. The emperor held him in high regard. The *Sāmén* (Buddhist monks) resented his favor, and *Gāolìshì*, who had long served the *Fútóu* (Buddhist) sect, together defamed him before the emperor. He then requested to return to *Sōngshān*, and the emperor decreed the establishment of a pavilion for him.

He expounded on the *mysteries of the Grain Spirit* (*Gǔshén*), producing *The Treatise on the Xuángāng*. Mournful for the *blue-pine heart* and *withered gaze* of those distant from the Dao, he wrote *The Treatise on Immortality as a Learnable Art*. He composed *The Heart-Washing Ode* and *The Éxī Retreat Ode* to clarify the *transcendent purity* and *liberation from worldly entanglements*. His works on cultivating sincerity within the chest to rest in *Tianjūn* (Celestial Balance) include *The Theory of Heart and Mind* and *The Hymn of Divine Accord*. His poems on *wandering among immortals*, *treading the void*, and *mixed reflections on royal governance* total over four hundred and fifty, collected and prefaced by *Guān Déyǔ*.

Later, he attained *spiritual dissolution*, and the emperor posthumously honored him as **Master Zōngyuán**. His works were compiled by **Liú Zhīgǔ**, styled **Xiānxián** (Celestial Hidden), a native of *Pèi*. A descendant of the *Zhèng King of Zhōngshān*, his ancestors served as officials in *Línqióng*, and the family settled there. His mother, of the *Hào* clan, conceived him after a divine dream, and she was endowed with wisdom and virtue, taking no delight in worldly gain or fame. She devoted herself solely to the Dao, later joining the *Tàiqīng Guān* (Great Clarity Monastery) and receiving the *sāndòng jīnglù* (triple cave scriptures and talismans).

She mastered the *Bāgōng Bǎozhāng* (Eight Immortals’ Precious Scriptures), the *sāndòng bǎolù* (triple cave talismans), the *Dānjīng Màijué* (Alchemical Canon of Veins and Pulse), and the *shēngshēng rùsǐ* (methods of birth-and-death transcendence), all without exception. The *Ruìzōng* emperor summoned him for inquiry, and his Daoist attainments pleased the sovereign, who bestowed special honors upon him before he returned to his mountain.

During the *Kāiyuán* era, he was summoned again to alleviate the people’s suffering. As a *Zhēnrén* (True Person), he observed the *yùsè* (color of the complexion) and *dàimài* (pulse), dispersing *qì* to remove ailments. Eighteen out of every ten people benefited and found peace. The emperor’s gifts he declined, instead requesting permission to return to *Shù* (Sichuan), and he was granted a decree to establish his residence as the *Dàqiānqiū Guān* (Great Thousand Autumns Monastery). The emperor inscribed the name himself, and **Lǐ Yōng** composed the stele.

Later, during the *Tiāncháng Jié* (Heavenly Length Festival), the monastery was renamed *Tiāncháng Guān* (Heavenly Length Monastery), and further arrangements were made for its expansion. When visitors came, he imparted the *Huángbái shù* (elixir arts of gold and silver). Though their dwellings were grand and splendid, costing tens of thousands, he never relied on human labor to complete them.

Visitors returned, and he was advised by divine figures to dwell at *Dōngyáng Fùniú Shān* (East Yang’s Hidden Cow Mountain). Upon arriving, he found an ancient monastery renovated and ready for residence. He practiced the *sānbēn jiǔdào* (three sprints, nine methods) for ten years. Suddenly, a radiance filled his chamber, and a single *dānzhī* (elixir grass) sprouted, striking the stone beneath it and producing a resonant metallic sound. In a dream, a divine person told him: *"Beneath the dripping spring of the mountain behind lies a stone where a golden fish crosses it—you may ascend to heaven with this."*

He was instructed that only this grass striking the stone would summon the fish. Later, he sought it out, and when he struck the stone with the grass, a thunderous force shook the earth. The massive stone cracked open, revealing the golden fish, three *chǐ* in length, which then soared into the sky, surrounded by swirling clouds and mists. The True Person once prayed for his mother’s blessings, placing nine *yōnghuā dēng* (lanterns of the Nine Abysses) in the *Jīn lù bái jiǎn* (golden talismans and white tablets) style, which remains in use to this day. The benefits to the *yōumíng* (netherworld) are immeasurable.

He also authored *The Celestial Pivot of Sun and Moon* and *The Song of Pointing Out Errors*, which circulate in the world.

In the *Xuān Hé* era of the *Shèngsòng* (Revered Song), the monastery was renamed *Xiānyǐn Guān* (Hidden Immortal Monastery), located within the northern city walls of *Chéngdū*.

**Fù Liànshī** (Fù Xiānzōng), styled **Xiānzōng** (Immortal Ancestor), was from *Cháng’ān*. His father, **Lún**, served as the magistrate of *Zīyáng*. **Xiānzōng** from a young age took delight in Daoist learning, thus secluding himself at *Zīyáng Shān* (Resource Yang Mountain). Soon after, a divine person revealed to him that *Yù’àn Shān* (Jade Button Mountain) was suitable for cultivation, so he constructed the *Qiānlíng Guān* (Thousand Autumns Monastery) and resided there for a decade.

One day, several divine figures appeared and said: *"Master, this mountain is our deity. Since you have taken up residence here, we have not known a moment’s peace, let alone this place being a blessed domain. The *Pínggāng Shān* (Flat Ridge Mountain) to the west of the prefecture is where you should dwell."* Heeding their words, the mountain spirits served as his attendants, and he built an altar and chambers at the site.

When Emperor *Mínghuáng* championed the Dao, he summoned **Xiānzōng** to the court. Passing through *Lìzhōu*’s *Jiúpóbó Jīn* (Orange-Bamboo Ferry of Lì Prefecture), water demons plagued the locals. **Xiānzōng** inscribed two stone tablets with talismans and cast them into the water, whereupon two massive fish stranded on the shallows, their bellies bearing the inscription: *"Red carp, red carp, dwelling in river waters, not avoiding the Immortal Officials—your fate is sealed by justice."* The prefectural magistrate reported this, and the emperor decreed the establishment of a shrine for **Xiānzōng** at the ferry.

Upon arriving in the capital, he was assigned to preside over a *jiào* (ritual) at the *Shàngqīng Gōng* (Upper Clarity Palace). The emperor personally attended the altar. When **Xiānzōng** arrived, he requested the presence of the *Qīngtóng Jūn* (Youth Lord of the East) and his officials and attendants. In an instant, celestial soldiers filled the eastern side of the altar, and the emperor was filled with fear.

After the ritual concluded, he asked **Xiānzōng** how he had achieved such power. **Xiānzōng** replied: *"My cultivation focuses solely on pacifying the people and benefiting all things. I maintain a tranquil and unadorned simplicity, clear as still water, undisturbed as a calm mind. Thus, I overcome myself."* The emperor was deeply moved and pleased.

In time, he requested to return to his mountain, and the emperor ordered the expansion of his monastery, personally inscribing the name and renaming it *Yìngzhēn Guān* (Responding to True). On the fourteenth day of the tenth month in the third year of *Qiányuán*, he suddenly heard a voice from the sky: *"The Most High commands your return."* He bathed, ascended his platform, and attained *spiritual dissolution*. Some saw him in *Jiǎnzhōu*, riding a green donkey as he departed—this was surely an instance of *shījiě* (body dissolution).

**Lǘqiū Xiānshēng** (Lǘqiū Fāngyuǎn), styled **Dàfāng** (Great Rectitude), was from *Yùn* (Yun). At sixteen, he mastered the *Classics and Histories*. At twenty-nine, he entered the Dao, studying under **Yóu Yuánzé**.

The Master of the Marsh said to him: *"Have you not heard the Master Lao say, 'My greatest affliction is that I have a body'? Truly, the body arises from non-action (*wuwei*) and gives rise to action (*youwei*); now you return to the root, which is called non-action. Non-action means that when one speaks of 'non-being,' one attains emptiness (*kong*); when one speaks of 'being,' one meets obstruction (*zhe*). Grasping both being and non-being leads to stagnation (*zhi*). Only when you harmonize being and non-being, extinguishing all thought and resting in thoughtlessness (*wu xin*), will you approach the Dao. And indeed, the Master Shakyamuni (释氏) established this as the foundation of the Zen School (禅宗).*

Confucius said: *"The stillness that does not move—its measure is singularity (一)."*

The Master Lao further asked: *"What is that which, when faced, has no front, and when followed, has no back? What is this thing?"*

If you can grasp this in silence, what more do you need to seek? Why must you dwell beneath the long pines of an empty mountain? What is lamentable is that your talent and capacity are sufficient to become a true exemplar for the Daoist School (*Zhenmen*).*

Fāngyuǎn received his teachings and departed, then further studied under **Liú Chǔjìng** and **Yè Zàngzī** for the Daoist initiation (*dàojì*). Admiring **Zhìchuān Zhēnbái** for his upright character, his reputation grew even greater.

The ruler of **Wúyuè** (Wu and Yue), **Qián Liú**, revered his purity and simplicity, visiting him at **Dàdí Dòng** (Great Filtration Cave) and constructing a dwelling for him to reside in.

Emperor **Zhāozōng** repeatedly summoned him in edicts, but he did not attend. The emperor then granted him official robes, bestowing the titles *Miàohǔo Dàshī* (Master of Marvelous Being) and *Yuántóng Xiānshēng* (Master of Original Harmony). His disciples numbered over two hundred, but only a dozen or so truly grasped the essence of cultivating *virtue/power* (*xiūzhēn*) and refining the *qi/spirit* (*liànshén*). Later, one day, he suddenly bathed, sat upright, and attained *spiritual dissolution* (*shījiě*). When his coffin was opened, only an empty casket remained.

**Dù Guāngtíng**, styled **Bīnshèng**, the Daoist Master of the Dù lineage.

For his time, he was a renowned Confucian scholar, yet failing the *million-word essay* examination, he turned to the Dao/Way, becoming a foremost disciple of **Yìng Shì** (Responding Master). He once remarked that the Daoist teachings and rituals, since compiled by **Hàn Tiānshī** (Han Heavenly Master) and **Lù Xiūjìng** (Lu Modesty of the Pure), had over time fallen into disuse and decay. Thus, he scrutinized their authenticity, systematically recording their origins, and so the Daoist clergy across the land followed his arrangements to this day.

Emperor **Lǐzōng** summoned him to serve as a literary draftsman in **Lín Dé Diàn** (Lynx Virtue Hall). At the time, he was praised as saying:
*"A forest of words, a sea of learning;
Upholding the lineage, establishing the teaching—
the foremost under heaven."*

During the **Zhōnglǐ** era, he accompanied the imperial procession to Shu, where he grew old in **Chéngdū**. When **Wáng Jiàn** ruled Shu, he summoned him as a teacher for the royal prince. He once told **Xú Guāngbù** (Xu Broad Virtue), *"In my youth, I studied at the imperial university, where all texts were available. Within a month, I divided each day’s study:
The first day, I recited the Classics;
The second, I read the histories and commentaries;
The third, I practiced composition;
The fourth, I recorded anecdotes;
The fifth, I rested leisurely to cultivate my will.
This cycle completed in five days, repeated monthly.
In less than five years, I mastered all the texts."*

**Guāngbù**, the Shù chancellor, had once been his disciple.

The Heavenly Master first encountered the **Chén Tǐ** (Body of Truth) scripture and later obtained divine elixirs. In **Chéngdū**, he resided at **Zhū Xiān Yīn** (Jade Immortal’s Retreat), where his teachings resonated widely. In autumn, he declined further invitations and never met again. One day, he suddenly told his disciples, *"Last night, I dreamed of presenting myself to the Celestial Sovereign as the overseer of Mín Yuè (the sacred peaks)."* At that time, the **True Palace** was being constructed on **Qīngchéng Shān** (Green City Mountain), and its completion was announced. He then donned his ritual robes, performed farewell rites, and ascended the hall, bidding his disciples farewell before attaining *spiritual dissolution* (*huà*). His remains were buried on **Qīngchéng**, but his coffin was found unusually light—upon opening it, only a single sandal remained.

He authored numerous works, including the *Hùnyuán Tú* (Mixed Primordial Diagram), *Yìjì Shèngfù* (Sacred Ode of the Epoch), *Guǎngshèng Yì* (Expanded Sacred Meaning), *Lìdì Jì* (Record of the Imperial Lineage), *Língyàn Jì* (Record of Miraculous Verifications), *Kējiào Yífàn* (Ritual Standards of Teachings), *Zhāngcí Biǎoshì* (Models of Chapters and Proclamations), and hundreds of songs and miscellaneous writings, collectively titled *Guǎngchéng Jí* (Collection of Broad Achievement). He was posthumously honored as **Guǎngchéng Xiānshēng** (Master of Broad Achievement).

**Sū Chéngyǐn** (Su Concealed Virtue)
The Daoist **Sū Chéngyǐn** resided at **Zhèn Yáng Lóngxīng Guàn** (Dragon’s Ascension Hall in Zhengyang), mastering the teachings of **Lǎozǐ** and **Zhuāngzǐ**, and excelling in *qi* cultivation and nourishment. In the **Kāibǎo** era (968 CE), Emperor **Tàizǔ** stationed in **Zhèn Yáng**, summoned him to the palace. The emperor said, *"Master, you are over eighty yet appear youthful—this is the art of nurturing life. Please instruct me."* **Chéngyǐn** replied, *"My method of nurturing life is no more than refining thought and cultivating the spirit. For rulers, the path differs."* He cited **Lǎozǐ**:
*"If I act without action, the people transform themselves;
If I desire nothing, the people return to simplicity.
Without action, without desire—
the spirit merges with the Great Harmony."*

The emperor praised his words and bestowed extraordinary honors.

**Zhāng Wúmèng** (Zhang Dreamless)
**Zhāng Wúmèng**, styled **Língyǐn** (Hidden Forest), was renowned for his filial piety. He favored solitude, studied the *Yìjīng* (Changes Classic), and at adulthood, entrusted his wealth to his younger brother before entering **Huà Shān** (Flowery Mountain), where he befriended **Zhǒng Fàng** (Seed Release) and **Liú Hǎitán** (Liu Sea Pot), serving **Xīyí Shì** (Harmonious Master). He gained profound insights. Afterward, he wandered to **Tiāntái Shān** (Heavenly Terrace Mountain) and **Chìchéng** (Scarlet City), dwelling there for over a decade. His cultivation was refined, and he expressed his inner truths in poetry, composing *Hái Yuán Piān* (Hundred Verses of Returning to the Primordial) with a hundred stanzas. **Xià Yīnggōng** (Summer Noble Lord) visited him in the mountains, obtaining the poems to present at court. **Wáng Jìgōng** (Wang of Ji), as chancellor, received the poems and later submitted them to the throne.

Emperor **Zhēnzōng** inquired about strategies for longevity. **Wúmèng** replied, *"I am a rustic—only reciting the *Lǎozǐ* and *Zhōuyì* in the mountains."* The emperor commanded him to lecture on the *Yìjīng*, and he expounded on the **Jiǎn** (Modesty) hexagram. The emperor asked, *"Why only the Modesty hexagram?"* **Wúmèng** answered, *"In times of great abundance, one must govern with modesty."* The emperor delighted in his words and offered him the post of **Zhuózhuò Zuǒláng** (Literary Draftsman), which he declined. Later, the emperor summoned him again to lecture on *Hái Yuán Piān*, offering wine and gifts, which he also refused. The emperor then bestowed the title **Chùshì Xiānshēng** (Recluse Master), which he declined as well. The emperor composed a poem in reply:

*"The Dao of Mixed Primordial contains pure essence,
Observe it—no trace, listen—no sound.
Only the enlightened attain this truth,
Adrift beyond the world, immersed in stillness.

Floating clouds unfold beyond ordinary form,
Flowing water circles without fixed shape.
On impulse, I left the mountain’s gate,
To discuss the Dao, I briefly visited the royal court.
With the wind, I heard the essence of the lineage,
Returning to the stone, I sought my natural ease.

Jade and silk, cap and sash—unworthy of my regard,
I sang long and now return with imperial favor.
The next day, I departed by decree,
The court ordered my stipend from Tàizhōu—
I did not request it.
Thus, my life’s end was pure and untainted."*

He died at ninety-nine in **Jīnlíng**. Three days later, white *qi* emerged from his crown, rising three feet high. His *Jūn Tái Shī* (Jade Terrace Poems) circulated in the world. His disciple, **Bìxū Zǐ** (Azure Void Child) **Chén Jǐngyuán** (Chen Scenic Element), inherited the essence of **Lǎozǐ** and **Zhuāngzǐ**.

**Liú Shì** (Master Liu)
**Liú Cóngshàn**, styled **Shùnfū** (Obedient Husband), from a young age, favored Daoist learning. He took ordination at **Jiànlóng Guàn** (Observing Dragon Hall). In the early **Tiānshèng** era, he resided at **Jǐnglíng Gōng** (Scenic Spirit Palace) by imperial decree. The emperor and empress desired to receive Daoist initiation. **Shàoguān Miào Shì** (Mysterious Observation Master) **Zhū Zìyīng** (Zhu Self-Cultivation) established an altar at **Yùqīng Zhāoyìng Gōng** (Jade Purity Responsive Palace), commanding **Cóngshàn** to participate in the ritual. The emperor was strict in filial offerings, sending envoys to instruct him on the taboo dates of the late emperor, ordering him to recite incantations before the deities during the ritual meal.

Thus, **Cóngshàn** compiled the incantation formulas from the **Sāndòng Jīng** (Three Caverns Scriptures) and later submitted the ritual texts. The emperor praised him, bestowing the title **Quánsù** (Complete Purity), and ordered his compositions to be inscribed in all Daoist halls. The ritual of *zòushí* (ritual meal offerings) originated with him. When the **Yánníng Gōng** (Serene Peace Palace) was completed, many submitted poems for the imperial portrait’s five-viscera inscriptions, but only **Cóngshàn’s** met with approval. His text was engraved on gold and jade plaques.

When Emperor **Rénzōng** fell ill, he summoned **Cóngshàn** to present petitions inside the palace, commanding officials to relay his words. After kneeling and presenting his memorial, the emperor asked, *"Did your words reach me?"* He replied, *"They have reached you."*

When the emperor’s passing was near, after but a few moments, he suddenly regained his vitality and clarity, and commanded that it be announced: *"Ask the General Bo of what divine origin?"*
**Cóngshàn** replied: *"Beneath the Three Heavens’ Gate stands a deity—the General Bo of Zhōngyuán, who governs the spirit of petitioning."*

Again, the proclamation came: *"Set up his station."*
The next day, the imperial health fully recovered. He instructed his attendants: *"Last night, I reached the Celestial Gate, where General Bo said, ‘The Emperor has not yet arrived; I must borrow a steed to return you swiftly.’ Thus, I awoke."*

The emperor removed his imperial robes, offering gold and silk in gratitude, and sought to bestow upon him the title of *xiānshēng* (Immortal Master). **Cóngshàn** declined with humility.
In the reign of Emperor **Yīngzōng**, the Chancellor **Hán Wèigōng** (Han of the Wei clan) again petitioned for the title to be granted, but he refused once more.

On the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month of **Xīnníng the Third Year**, after bathing in purification, he gathered his disciples and declared: *"I await the great wind’s arrival, then I shall depart."*
Soon after, the wind arose as foretold, and he ascended in transformation.

Later, a traveler returning from **Shǔ** (Sichuan) reported seeing the Master riding a white horse into the region, with the parting words: *"If you encounter my disciples, convey this message to them."*
Thus, it was known that he had achieved *shījiě* (embodied ascension).

He compiled ritual fasting procedures, methods for petitioning the Dao, and left behind hymns and poems in circulation.

**Daoist Canon’s Universal Teachings (Required Texts, Volume II)**
*Hèlín Dàoshì Lǚ Tàigǔ Ji* (Collected Works of Lü the Ancient, the Crane Forest Daoist)
*Cí Zàn Piān* (Hymns and Praises)
*Qǐtáng Sòng* (Hymn of the Awakened Hall)

「To cultivate the Dao, one must be diligent and earnest, gathering sincerity and refining the elixir of truth.
Burn incense to honor the *Tàishàng Lǎojiūn* (Supreme Venerable),
where the *zhēnqì* (true *qi*) mingles with fragrant smoke.
Only may the Great Compassion be opened,
as the Seventh Patriarch departs from the shadowed realm.
**Hymn of the Offerings**
The *Xuánxī* (Suspended Pivot) stars turn in their course,
the *Yùlòu* (jade water clock) chimes its first resonance.
Having conveyed the offerings to the True Officials,
with devout sincerity, the *qiè* (sacrificial) feast is now begun.
With earnest words, I pray to the *shèmàn* (wild tribes of the south),
my revelation all the more focused and refined.
Gazing upward toward the multitude of True Immortals,
they seem to descend from the Ninth Heaven in faint outline.

**Hymn of Wisdom**
Wisdom arises from the root of *jiè* (precepts),
and the True Dao finds its master in precepts.
From these Three Treasures, all flourishes,
as the Highly Authentic ones revere and accept.
This vessel of non-perishing traverses boundless seas,
in a flash, it crosses the Great Void.
At this moment of preaching precepts,
all the heavens come to pay homage with folded hands.
**Hymn of Revering Precepts**
The Dao is the school of the *wúxīn* (heartless/non-dual) principle,
and all things become fields of merit.
The rewards of deeds are without fixed master,
for each is born from their own original vows.
To empty oneself for all beings,
to pour one’s heart out—none may be excluded.
The Great Sage upholds the utmost teachings,
just as the heavens are nourished by rain.
The lofty peaks are never left unvisited,
yet the humble valleys become profound depths.
The sea is king of all streams,
yet it willingly sheds its dragon scales.
Through countless *jié* (kalpas), wisdom is preserved,
not merely confined to a single age.
To revere precepts brings no loss,
through all lifetimes, one sows good connections.
With focused contemplation, I aspire to the Great Vehicle,
to ultimately embody the True Dao.

**Hymn of Inviting the Master**
All should show reverence.
In ancient rites, inviting the Master refers only to the Three Masters—*Scripture*, *Canon*, and *Transmission*—
and threefold invocation is made.
Even before the proper altar is established to honor the Master’s presence,
it is the *self*-transmitted Three Masters of the Three Worlds.
Later generations failed to examine this closely,
mistaking the Three Masters for celestial Daoist officials,
thus adding them to the Five Masters.
Since this is now the case,
it cannot be altered again—
let the Three Masters among the Five be honored as:
*Yùluóqiào Zhēnrén* (Idyllicly Elevated True Person),
*Zhēndìngguāng Zhēnrén* (True Person of Illuminating Stability),
and *Guāngmiàoyīn Zhēnrén* (True Person of Resplendent Sound).
These are the Three Masters who witnessed the *Scripture* on Tiantai,
the ancestral teachers of transmission,
never forgetting their origins.

As for the *Sānián* (Three Sovereigns),
they are also called the Three Masters,
already revered in the proper altar rites—
they cannot be reduced to the Five Masters.

In the *Xuánzhōng* (Mysterious Central) hierarchy,
the first rank belongs to the Master,
followed by the Three Masters,
then the *Jiānyàn* (Supervising Feast) Grandmasters.
**For rites of fasting and Daoist practice:**
Invite the *Xuánzhōng Dàfǎshī* (Grandmaster of the Mysterious Central) to descend and preside.
**For rites of fasting and Daoist practice:**
Invite the Three Masters—*Scripture*, *Canon*, and *Transmission*—to descend and preside.
**For rites of fasting and Daoist practice:**
Invite the *Jiānyàn Dàfǎshī* (Grandmaster Supervising the Feast) to descend and preside.

When the *yún yǔ* (cloud chariot) has descended,
and the *hè jià* (crane carriage) arrives,
the feast is complete in all its rounds—
then it is time to offer farewell.

**Singing the Daoist Praises**
All assembled at the *Dàocháng* (Daoist Hall),
each focusing their hearts,
united in harmonious reverence,
all Three Treasures invoked in prayer.

**Praise of the Chinese Realm**
To study speech and to study conduct—
both are *xuéyán* (learning of words).」

Thus, the Master of the **Scripture** takes precedence,
the **Canon** and **Transmission** Masters follow next,
and the **Jiānyàn Dàfǎshī** (Grandmaster Supervising the Feast) ranks below them.

**For Daoist fasting and practice:**
The **Mysterious Central** Grandmaster is revered as the **Léfǎ** (Law of Music),
and the **Scripture** is cherished like pearls and jade.
With **precepts** held firm and the **Six Emotions** subdued,
one recites the **Dao/Way** to dispel all cravings.
In **dampness and stillness**, the **orthodox qi** is stilled,
and in **serene silence**, the spirit finds repose.
Both **celestial demons** and **earthly spirits** are honored and protected,
so that in this life and the next, one attains **great blessings**.

The **Chinese Realm** flourishes in **profound harmony**,
and the **Scripture** and **Dao/Way** thrive in splendor.
Heaven and man share the same aspiration,
and **Lofty and Mysterious** enters the **Great Vehicle**.

**Establishing the Field of Merit through the Mind**,
the **Dharma Wheel** ascends without end.
The **Seven Ancestors** are born in the **Celestial Hall**,
and my body soars like the **White Sun**.

The **Great Dao/Way** penetrates the **Mysterious and Profound**,
and with every thought, none fails to resonate.
Refining the essence, one attains **Immortal Truth**,
and thus becomes a **Golden Body** (Vajra-like).

To **transcend and guide** the **Three Realms** is difficult,
yet the **Five Torments** of the **Underworld** are dissolved.
All return to the **Scripture of the Most High**,
and with every recitation, one prostrates in homage.

**Ten Verses of the Jade Capital (Yùjīng) on Lofty and Mysterious (Xūwú)**
With prostrations to the **Most High**,
incense is burned to return to **Emptiness**.
The **radiant light** follows me back,
and the **Dharma Wheel** revolves three times.
**Mysterious Aspirations** flourish in the **Four Great Elements**,
and **spiritual rejoicing** extends to **kings and nobles**.
The **Seven Ancestors** are born in the **Celestial Hall**,
their **resplendent brilliance** spreading far and wide.

**Singing and dancing** in the **Great Desert’s** vastness,
the **Heavenly Music** delights me in its harmony.
The **fragrance** of the **Supreme Virtue** is unmatched,
and **lower immortals** cannot compare.
**Wondrous thoughts** awaken **profound awareness**,
and **serene** movements traverse **Emptiness**.
With **swift steps** along the **cloudly cords**,
one rides the **Void** and walks the **Mysterious Path**.

**Reciting** to the **Sovereign of Unity**,
all **passes** are naturally regulated.
Gazing downward, one commands the **Eight Seas** to tremble,
and upward, one ascends with **High Immortals**.
The **Heavens** scatter **incense and flowers**,
and the **serene spirit-wind** stirs.
**Past aspirations** are rooted in **destiny’s foundation**,
thus achieving **Lofty and Mysterious** emulation.

With **joy** before the **Most High**,
even **ten thousand kalpas** are but the beginning.
**Majestic** is the **Mysterious Capital Mountain**,
the **Ten Directions** all revere the **Imperial One**.

**Dazzling** is the **Celestial Treasure Platform**,
its **radiant flames** flowing like the sun.
**Gleaming** is the **Jade Forest’s** splendor,
and **clustered** are the **Seven Treasures** of the **Luminous Grove**.
Ever **nourishing** the **Essential Precision**,
one refines the **elixir** to solidify the **form and substance**.
**Golden Light** scatters across **Purple Micro**,
and **Lofty and Mysterious** ascends in **effortless grace**.

Gazing downward and upward, one reveres the **Most High**,
and the **Jade Capital’s** brilliance adorns the **Dan Tian** (Elestial Field).
To the left, one raises the **Idyllic Ritual**,
and to the right, one embraces the **Jade Luminaries**.
With the **Six Perfections**, one observes **Brahman’s conduct**,
and **Daoist Virtue** renews itself daily.
**Past lives’** accumulated **merit** manifests,
and hearing the **Scripture** feels like encountering a **kin**.
The **Heavenly Sovereign** elevates **great talent**,
and one recites **sacred texts** with **profound reverence**.

**Orthodox qi** flows in **Great Harmony**,
and one **inhales and exhales** the **Luminous Elixir**.
**Embryonic Breathing** calms the **Hundred Passes**,
and **Lofty and Serene** explores the **Three Treasures’** essence.
The **Earthly Pill** shines with **illuminating clarity**,
and thus one becomes the **Jade-Hued Immortal**.

The **Demon King** respects and receives this,
so one may **audience the Heavens**.
All begin with **fasting and precepts**,
and through **accumulated merit**, past **karmic ties** are fulfilled.

**Soaring** in the **Great Void**,
one **ascends** with the **Highest Immortals**.
With **reins in hand**, one traverses the **Ten Directions**,
and in **swift rotation**, one rests in the **Mysterious and Profound**.

Gazing upward, one beholds the **Effulgent Platform of the Kalpa**,
and downward, one surveys the **Purple Cloud Array**.
**Adrift in Lofty and Mysterious**,
one sits together on the **Lotus Flower**.

Through **accumulated learning**, one becomes a **True Person**,
and in **serene composure**, the **vital energies** harmonize.
**Endlessly** enjoying **boundless longevity**,
what need is there for **ten thousand autumns**?

The **Great Dao/Way**’s **Master** is **Mysterious and Profound**,
and **True Immortals** possess **unfathomable brilliance**.
The **Prince** transmits **spiritual talismans**,
and **Taiyi** (Great Unity) presents **illuminating scrolls**.
The **Sacred Relics** gleam in **golden splendor**,
and the **Dragon Chariot** swiftly comes to welcome.

The **Heavenly Sovereign** gazes from the **clouds**,
and **floating**, one rides the **Void**.
**Incense and flowers** fall like **flying snow**,
and **abundant** **spiritual winds** adorn the **Mysterious Beams**.

With **head and hands** in homage to the **Golden Gate**,
one **clasps hands** and **wanders** in the **Jade Capital**.
**Circular trees** enclose the **Garden of Radiance**,
and **dazzling** is the **Seven Treasures Forest**.
**Heavenly beasts** number in the **thousands**,
with **Lions** vast in the **ten thousand leagues**.
**Flying Dragons** pace and **roar**,
and the **Divine Phoenix** responds with **melodic chirps**.

**Spirit-winds** fan **wondrous flowers**,
and **pure fragrance** scatters across the **human breast**.
Without **Lofty and Mysterious talent**,
how could one **attain this necessity**?

**Admonish** my **Nine Dragon Chariot**,
and ride the **Void** in **effortless grace**.
The **Eight Heavens** are as near as **one’s fingertips**,
and the **Six Harmonies** are but a **brief span**.
The **multitude of Immortals** recite **sacred texts**,
while the **Most High** sings **pure melodies**.
**Incense and flowers** drift with the **wind**,
and **jade-like sounds** rise to the **Purple Expanse**.

The **Five Torments** burst forth at once,
and the **Eight Difficulties** are overcome by the **Scripture’s** vastness.
**Wondrous** indeed is the **Enclosure of Spirit-Treasures**,
and this **Great Law** is the **Bridge of the Dao/Way**.

The **Celestial Hall of Unity**,
**vague and bright** in its **spiritual radiance**,
the **Dharma Wheel’s** **cord** revolves,
and **Void** enters **formlessness**.

The **Void Sovereign** strokes the **cloudly jade**,
while the **multitude of True Ones** recite **sacred texts**.
**High Immortals** extend their **palms** in praise,
and **through kalpas** they safeguard the **Sacred Body**.

**Absolute Truth** awaits nothing,
yet at times one **guides the flying Dragon**.
**Long fasting** gathers in the **Mysterious Capital**,
and **jade chimes** strike the **Lotus Bell**.

**Ten thousand Immortals** assemble at the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** abode,
their **flying sandals** stepping on the **cloudly roots**.
**Misty** like **fine dew**,
**gradually** they trail **filmy robes**.
**Wondrous** and **light**, they follow **auspicious clouds**,
and **graceful**, they ride the **colorful phoenix**.

Near **accompanying** the **Jade Pool’s** feast,
suddenly one is **pointed** to return to the **Mysterious Heaven**.
Standing still at the **Firmament’s** shore,
one **ascends** to the **radiance of the Sun Sovereign**.

With **swift steps** along the **cloudly cords**,
the **heavenly wind** **rustles** and blows.
**Floating** in the **handle of the Dipper**,
one **holds the broom** and **salutes the celestial flags**,
the **lion** **adorns** the **red sash**,
and the **qilin** leads the **emerald carriage**.

**Soaring** around the **Eight Extremes**,
almost **witnessing** the **chestnut branches** bloom.
**Green locks** cascade in **cloudlike chignons**,
and **blue mists** weave **feathered robes**.
In the **morning**, one **proceeds** to the **Hall of Yang Virtue**,
and at **night**, one **visits** the **Moonlight Gate**.
**Fanning and stirring** the **circular heavenly fire**,
one **conceals and stores** the **spirit of the Sixteen Machines**.

The **Jade Chamber** cannot **detain**,
and one **returns** to the **Nine Heavens** to **fly**.

The **White Crane Hymns**

**White Crane** at first was born in **Purple Forbidden**,
and now **dwells** in the **Celestial Abode** to nurture **feathered robes**.
**Asking** the **Daoist Immortal** when **one shall depart**,
**do not say** one **cannot** **accompany** the **clouds** in flight.

The **White Crane** returns to the **Nine Heavens** after **thousand springs**,
while **mountains and rivers** remain unchanged—**mortals** are not.
Had it not been for the **Clear Proclamation** of **Ding Lingwei**,
who would **recognize** the **White Crane** of old?

The **White Crane** **flies** down from the **Nine Heavens**,
its **clear calls** **piercing** through **auspicious mists**.
The **sun and moon** **urge** one another—**mortals** age swiftly,
yet **better** to **cultivate the Dao** and **learn from the Immortals**.

The **Virtuous Sovereign of Great Unity** has a **snow-white visage**,
**Soaring in the Void**, coming and going with **no trace**.
**Penglai** must be **sought**—and now **one goes**,
while the **qilin** **stands** at the window, the **crane** among the **pines**.

The **White Crane**, born of **Heaven**, has a **long lifespan**,
**soaring** in the **Immortal Realm**, attending the **Void Sovereign**.
When **thousand springs** arrive at the **Clear Proclamation**,
**one returns** to the **Nine Heavens**, the **Natural Homeland**.

The **White Crane** **flies** in the **Jade Capital**,
**traversing** the **Three Realms**, **manifesting** **Eternal Life**.
If **cultivation** reaches the **Immortal Realm**,
**one shall ride** the **True Vehicle** into the **Cloud Court**.

**White Crane Hymns**
The **White Crane**, **congealed** in **frost**, wears a **crimson crest**,
**Ever dwelling** in the **Empty Verdant** **withdrawn** in mystery.
The **Three Pure Ones** **love** this **place of carefree ease**,
for **Heavenly** and **Earthly** affairs are **not the same**.

---

**White Crane Hymns**
At the **Eight Scenic** **period**, **ascend** to the **Forbidden Palace**,
and the **Nine Pure Ones** **bestow blessings** with the **Auspicious Scriptures**.

and **under the fierce sun**, **one lingered** in the **Court of Fortune**.

for it **brings auspicious omens**—**prosperity** for **ten thousand years**.

**Hymn of Departure**
**The Dao** **begins** with **fasting**,
**diligent practice** leads **one** to the **Golden Gate**.

**The Music of the Jade Purity**
In the **Purple Pure** **Heavens**, the **Flowery Forest** **nurtures** life,
where the **Crimson Realms** and **Jade Branches** **hide** deep **bamboo leaves**.
**Chewing** and **savoring** **abundant blossoms**, **one’s body** **does not age**,
**Gazing downward**, **one observes** the **Black Hare** **changing** **light and shadow**.

The **Original Sovereign** is **known** as the **Eight Qi** **Green Spirit**,
with **brocade robes** **fluttering** in **flying skirts**, **dwelling** in the **Jade City**.
**Holding** the **Imperial Talisman**, **one governs** the **Daoist Register**,
**Removing** **dust and filth**, **one aids** the **multitude of living beings**.

In the **Nine-Day Palace**, the **Four Elderly Immortals** **gather**,
and at the **Mountain of Broad Mists**, **one feasts** the **Celestial Guests**.
**Resounding bells** and **plucked strings** **move** the **Spiritual Wine**,
while the **Empty Verdant** **melts** in warmth—**another spring** **emerges**.

---

**The Music of the Supreme Purity**
The **Original Sovereign of Great Unity** **commands** the **ranked Immortals**,
with **scarlet radiance** and **crimson hues** **illuminating** the **Cinnabar Fields**.
**Perfect merit** **encounters** **those who erase** the **Dark Register**,
and **one awaits** the **Laughing Scholar of Hongya** **to clap the shoulder**.

Behind the **Golden Gate**, the **Luminous Sovereign** **shines**,
**Emitting essence**, **one’s brilliance** **forms** the **Cinnabar Clouds**.
Had it not been for the **Supreme Sage** **passing on** the **transmission**,
how could **mortals** possess the **Jade Texts**?

At **midnight**, the **Five Nodes** **burn** with **pure incense**,
and **Heavenly** and **Human** **Immortal Maidens** all **hear** from afar.
**Flavors** and **breaths** **harmonize**, **one responds** in **unison**,
as the **Crimson Talismans** and **Rainbow Banners** **descend** from the **Five Clouds**.

**The Great Law Bridge Hymn**
The **Great Law Bridge** is established to **universally deliver** all **celestial beings** and **sentient things**.
The **virtue/power** of **past-life kindness** is repaid,
and the **Dao-heart** **naturally ascends** and **emerges**.
One’s **body flies** to the **Immortal Capital**,
where the **Seven Patriarchs** all **attain liberation**.

The **Sutra and Rituals** praise the **Three Refuges**,
and **each person** **reverently obeys**.
With **wholehearted devotion**, one **takes refuge** in the **Ten-Directional Dao Treasures**,
and **vows** that all **sentient beings** may **arise** in **aspirations** and **dedications**,
**completely** **pay homage** in **faith**.

With **wholehearted devotion**, one **takes refuge** in the **Ten-Directional Sutra Treasures**,
and **vows** that all **sentient beings** may **open their minds** to **enlightenment**,
**receive, uphold, and recite** them.

With **wholehearted devotion**, one **takes refuge** in the **Ten-Directional Teacher Treasures**,
and **vows** that all **sentient beings** may **universally ascend** the **Law Bridge**,
**without obstruction**.

At the **Dao Assembly**, all **gathered ones**,
each **holding a tablet**,
**calmly seated** in **mind**,
**chant** as **prescribed by the Law**.

**The Hymn of Past Lives**
**Past lives** have **faithful causes**,
the **weak and lost** call it **none**.
All **desire** to **see** it **before their eyes**,
and **speak of its vastness** **once glimpsed**.

The **Great Sage** **illuminates the Dao**,
**grieving** and **pitying** the **stubborn** **fool**.
**Grievously** **remembering** my **child’s suffering**,
**diligently** **ordering** my **own sorrow**.

**The Hymn of Invoking the Sutra**
**Prostrating** before the **Vast Sovereign Heavenly Worthy**,
**The Sutra** **is sent forth**—**limitless**, **profound**, **profound** indeed.

**The Hymn of Liberation from Seated Postures**
For all **future lives**,
to **create auspicious causes** for **doing good**,
as if **granted enlightenment**,
**relying upon** the **Holy Virtue**.

**The Hymn of the Seven True Ones**
The **Supreme Sage of the Vast Void School**,
**proclaims the Dao** and **honors its Sutras**.
**Bowing and rising**, one **already attains immortality**,
**through countless kalpas**, **without aging**.

The **lofty virtue** of the **Supreme True One**,
**silent**, **rooted in the non-born**.
The **celestial scenery** **forms void structures**,
**riding the void**, one **naturally ascends**.

The **sun and moon** **shine brightly**,
**serene harmony** **endures without end**.
**Seeking immortality**, one **abandons worldly thoughts**,
yet **each thought** **begets** and **accumulates**.

**Coming and going** **disturb my spirit**,
**spirits restless**—**none escape**.
**Extinguishing thoughts** in the **void’s interval**,
**rustling**—**entering emptiness** and **stillness**.

**Invoking the Sutra** like **one parched with thirst**,
**holding firm** the **will** as **gold and stone**.

**Guarding my child** on the **path to immortality**,
the **Five Spirits** **cross** the **talismanic records**.

**Rescuing me** from the **Six Perfections**,
thus **liberating** the **Three Realms**.

**Pure fasting** **honors** the **Supreme Sage**,
**breathing exercises** **nurture** the **cloud-sprouts**.
**Playful and carefree** within the **Golden Gate**,
**Jade Capital** is my **home**.

**Naturally born** of the **Seven Treasures**,
each **person** **sits** on a **lotus**.
**Feasting upward** on the **Vast Capital’s** □,
**drinking deeply** from the **void’s hollow gourd**.

**My countenance** **radiates** like **ten suns**,
what **reckoning** of **years and kalpas**?

The **Law Drum** **gathers** **celestial immortals**,
the **bell** **summons** the **Great Demon**.
**Divine winds** **fan** the **fragrant blossoms**,
**brilliant**—**opening** the **abundant robes**.

The **Supreme True One** **plucks** the **cloud zither**,
**all immortals** **strum** the **spirit strings**.
**Elegant songs** **echo** the **Three Celestial Realms**,
**scattering blessings** in the **Jade Blossom Grove**.

The **Seven Patriarchs** **are born** in the **Heavenly Hall**,
thus **walking** the **Vast Sound**.

**Past-life virtue** was **insufficient**,
this **scripture** was **distant** and **hard to find**.
**Faith in the Dao** **overflows**,
yet **aspiring to fly** brings **only sinking**.

The **Supreme Sage’s** **non-action Dao**,
**proclaimed** in the **myriad hearts**.
**Learning the Dao** **begins** with **crimson faith**,
**serving the Teacher** like **one’s closest kin**.

**Drawing celestial scenes** in **pure void**,
**diligently** **following** the **daily renewal**.
While **all mortals** remain **undelivered**,
I **shall never** **deliver myself**.

**Great vows** bear **heavy recompense**,
**Vast virtue** **must be believed**.
**Dark misdeeds** and **deep crimes**,
when **facing them**, **like turning a wheel**.

**Learning the Dao** is **truly arduous**,
**morning and night** **establishing** the **Field of Merit**.
**Cultivating virtue** **like planting trees**,
**layering** until **mountains rise**.

If **you** can **embrace** the **Vast Reverence**,
then **lightly** you **ascend** to **Pure Heaven**.

**Practicing** this **non-action Dao**,
you **shall** **join** the **auspicious causes** of the **good**.

The **Supreme Sage’s** **most hidden scriptures**,
named **"The Chapter of Wisdom"**,
**extract suffering** through **great talent**,
**transcending mundanity** to **attain immortality**.

**Divine form** **rare** in the **world**,
**radiant** like **lotus** in the **depths**.

**Each person’s path** **has its root**,
all **stem** from **past-life merit**.
**Establishing virtue** **must** **seize the moment**,
**making vows** **must** **never delay**.

**Good and evil** **both await** their **retribution**,
**submission and exaltation** **follow** the **principle** beyond **exhaustion**.

The **worthy scholar** **serves the Law** and **speaks**,
**"The Dao** **lies** in **both holding and releasing**."

**Liberation** is **great wisdom**,
this is the **Supreme Ultimate Sage**.

**Jade canopies** **link** with **jade carriages**,
**commanding** the **Nine Dragons** to **drive**.

The **Golden Void Hollow Sutra**,
**immortal children** **present incense** in **reverence**.
**Singing** **pierces** the **Vast Capital**,
**resounding jade** **strikes** the **celestial bell**.

**Standing erect**, one **transcends** the **Supreme Clarity**,
**rising above** the **scenery** to **drift** in the **Purple Expanse**.
**Guarding the Primordial** and **upholding the Law’s principles**,
**wandering** in the **Extreme Void**’s **playful freedom**.

**Ten thousand kalpas** **like yesterday’s night**,
**a thousand springs** **like morning’s dawn**.
**Lofty and majestic**, **shaded** by **cloudy splendor**,
**hand** **clasping** the **treasure grove’s branches**.

**Fragrant smoke** **naturally arises**,
**Vast Steps** **blaze** with **rising winds**.
**Divine banners** **follow** the **wind** and **unfurl**,
**proliferating thoughts** **dissolve** with the **times**.

**Extinguishing wisdom**, **proclaiming** the **Great Mixture**,
**non-action** **becomes** the **Pure Melody**.

**The Small Hymn of Learning Immortality**
**Learning immortality** **acts** with **urgency**,
**observing precepts** **restrains** the **emotional heart**.

**Praise and Chant: The Five Directions’ Guardian Spirits’ Spells.**

「This spell is not originally compiled in the *Praise and Chant* section, yet many afflictions arise from hearsay and oral transmission, with numerous errors and distortions. Hence, it is recorded here, so that from childhood one may be instructed in it, and thus apply it throughout one’s life.

Moreover, examining this spell, all its verses are texts to subdue evil (*制邪*), so each contains the character *wǒ* (我, "I/we"). Some mistakenly alter it to *chén* (臣, "subject"), which is incorrect.

After reciting the spell, igniting the furnace, and focusing one’s mind (*存神*), then comes the moment of invoking the *Upper True* (上真) and sealing the decree. There is no taboo in this sequence; it follows the *Golden Talisman Rites* (*金箓仪*) and cross-references the *Dao藏* (*Dao Canon*) for verification.

**East:**
Nine *Qi* of Azure Heaven, the Great Spirit of Bright Stars,
Illuminating the Eastern Region, piercingly revealing the Nine Gates,
Turning radiant the Yang Light, sweeping away filth and dissipating the *fēn* (氛, malevolent influences).
The *Kāimíng* (开明, "Illuminating") Child, guarding my hall (*我轩*),
Binding demons and subduing *yāo* (妖, spirits),
Standing before the Imperial Lord, offering the True *Dao*.
The *Chìshū* (赤书, "Red Scripture") and *Yùzì* (玉字, "Jade Characters"),
the Nine Heavens’ True Commandments, summoning the *Lóngyì* (龙驿, "Dragon Post") to transmit,
universal peace and stability throughout the heavens—*I* attain flying immortality (*飞仙*).
All in harmony; the remaining verses follow the same pattern.

**South:**
The Southern Region of Vermilion Heaven, where the Three *Qi* flow with radiance,
the Glowing Stars revolve like torches, piercingly illuminating the Great Sun.
Above, the *Chìjīng* (赤精, "Vermilion Refined") and *Kāimíng* (开明) Spirit Child,
commanding the Fire Soldiers, guarding the Three Palaces,
beheading evil and binding *yāo*, severing the *Mówáng* (魔王, "Demon King"),
as decreed by the Northern Emperor.
This spell is entirely for subduing demons and spirits, preventing them from disturbing the *Dao*’s sacred grounds (*道场*).

All who practice the *Dao* must subdue the multitude of demons—all belong to the Northern Emperor.
The Northern Clouds are under the Northern Emperor’s jurisdiction; some mistakenly claim this is a Southern spell, altering it to be recited by the *Chìdì* (赤帝, "Vermilion Lord"), which is incorrect.
This confusion is harmful and must be clarified.
The Eight *Chōng* (冲, "Assaults") of Wind and Fire,
jingling bells in alternating brilliance—dare any resist?
The True *Dao* spreads, *I* reap the rewards, safeguarding Heaven’s eternal preservation,
for countless *jiè* (劫, eons), without end.
The phrase "Severing the Demon King" is derived from the *Dao藏*’s ritual procedures (*科仪*), where "魔" (*Mó*, "Demon") is pronounced *xiān* (凶, "calamitous").

**West:**」

The Seven *Qi* (气) of pristine Heaven,
the *Taìbái* (太白, "Great White") pours forth its essence,
illuminating the Golden Gate, piercingly enlightening the Great Darkness.

Within lies the *Sùhuáng* (素皇, "Pristine Sovereign"), named *Dìlíng* (帝灵, "Imperial Spirit"),
preserving and calming the divine, guarding my form,
severing the source of evil—*Wángdào* (王道, "Sovereign Dao/Way") stands clear,
palaces in solemn order, the Three *Jǐng* (景, "Luminaries") aligned,
the Dao/Way harmonizes naturally, ascending to the Purple Court.

The *Língbǎo* (灵宝, "Numinous Treasure") talisman’s efficacy,
universally benefits all beings,
its merit encompassing all—Heaven and Earth alike are pacified.

**North:** The North’s Mysterious Heaven,
where the Five *Qi* (气) linger in motion,
the *Chénxīng* (辰星, "Star of Destiny") blazes resplendent,
illuminating the *Tàiwēi* (太微, "Great Subtlety").

The *Hēilíng* (黑灵, "Dark Spirit") Venerable Deity,
clad in *Fēixuān* (飞玄, "Ascending Mysterious") robes—
some mistakenly alter this to *Fēixiān* (飞仙, "Ascending Immortal") robes, which is incorrect.
This confusion is harmful and must be avoided.

Defending the Five Gates,
refining essence and capturing transgression—
dare any attempt intrusion?
They shall be shattered and annihilated.

The *Yùfú* (玉符, "Jade Talisman") decrees,
the Deity’s might resounds with the Eight *Wēi* (威, "Awe"),
evil gates sealed shut, the True Dao/Way brightly revealed,
its radiance reflected upon my person—
the Three *Guāng* (光, "Luminaries") shine together.
Some mistakenly alter this to *Sānguān* (三官, "Three Officials") piercingly enlightened, which is incorrect.

Riding the void and mastering the floating,
lifting my form to ascend as an immortal.

**Central:** The Yellow Center gathers all *Qi*,
overseeing the governance of immortal truth,
the *Zhènxīng* (镇星, "Guarding Star") emits its radiance,
illuminating the Nine Heavens.

The *Kāiguāng* (开光, "Awakening Light") *Tóngzǐ* (童子, "Boy/Child"),
twelve in number—
their *yuángqi* (元气, "Original Qi") flares with *fánhuá* (梵华, "Buddha-Light") essence,
and the flame ascends as *zhūyān* (朱烟, "Crimson Mist").
Some mistakenly alter this to *yānshàng* (焰上, "Flame Ascends") or *yánshàng* (炎上, "Heat Ascends"), which is incorrect.

Piercingly enlightening the altar and my form,
vanquishing myriad demons,
repelling ten thousand ghosts—
the *Shāngshān* (中山, "Central Peak") Deity’s spell,
universally compels all under Heaven,
the Five *Líng* (灵, "Spirits") are calmed,
and my form ascends to the immortals.

The Five *Liàn* (炼, "Refinements") Generating Corpse Treasure Talisman:

**East:** The Dragon Han (龙汉) initiates the *Jiǔyáng* (九阳, "Nine Yang") *Fánhuá* (梵华, "Buddha-Light") *Qi* Essence Treasure Talisman.
The Nine Yang returns with marvelous *Qi*,
the Three *Jǐng* (景) disperse the Original Essence.

The *Bì’ǎi* (碧霭, "Azure Mist") floats with numinous inscriptions,
the *Qīnglín* (青林, "Green Forest") displays refined *Shùyīng* (淑英, "Pure Brilliance").
Ascending to the *Yùqīngfǔ* (玉清府, "Jade Purity Palace"),
boundless as *Péngláiyíng* (蓬莱瀛, "Penglai Isles").

The True Transformation penetrates the *Wújiàn* (无间, "Immeasurable"),
the *Shénfēng* (神风, "Divine Wind") nourishes all beings.

**South:** The *Chìmíng* (赤明, "Vermilion Clarity") *Dānguāng* (丹光, "Cinnabar Light") Three Yang *Fánlíng* (梵灵, "Buddha-Spirit") *Hēi* (黑, "Black") Treasure Talisman.
Across boundless *jiè* (劫, eons), the Deity’s movement unfolds,
the Dragon’s script radiates with *Chìxiá* (赤霞, "Vermilion Mist").

The Eight *Wēi* (威) charge like lightning, the Nine *Fèng* (凤, "Phoenix") shatter calamitous evil.
Refining and liberating the *Dānhuáng* (丹皇, "Cinnabar Sovereign") Palace,
ascending to the *Yuánshǐ* (元始, "Primordial Origin") clan.

The *Yánmíng* (炎明, "Flame Clarity") endures in perpetual radiance,
the *Língqìng* (灵庆, "Spiritual Celebration") follows the morning’s brilliance.

**West:** The *Yánkāng* (延康, "Prolonging Health") *Sùlíng* (素灵, "Pristine Spirit") Seven Yang *Fánshùyīng* (梵淑英, "Buddha-Pure Brilliance") *Qi* Treasure Talisman.
The *Huánglǎo* (皇老, "Sovereign Elder") stores the refined essence,
the *Jīnxīng* (金精, "Golden Essence") radiates with *Dòuwēi* (斗威, "Combat Awe").

The Six Heavens are all cleansed and extinguished,
ten thousand treasures return to their hidden depths.
The *Shuǎngqi* (爽气, "Purifying Qi") floats at the High Gate,
the *Hán’ǎi* (寒光, "Cold Light") veils the pristine radiance.

The void is pierced, the *Yùlè* (玉勒, "Jade Inscription") unfurls—
the *Lè* (勒) refers to the *Yùjiàn* (玉简, "Jade Slips"), hence "Jade Inscription unfurls."
The glory ascends to the Nine Exalted Heavens.

**North:** The *Kāihuáng* (开皇, "Opening Sovereignty") *Xuānshàng* (玄上, "Mysterious Ascension") Five Yang *Fánhùn* (梵混, "Buddha-Blending") *Qi* Treasure Talisman.
The Five *Qi* (气) correspond to the Original Marvel,
the Heavens blend with the Great Darkness.

The *Shénjīng* (神旌, "Divine Standard") flies with black plumes—
the *Shénjīng* is adorned with black plumes and soars.
The *Yùnǚ* (玉女, "Jade Maiden") scatters green flowers.

The *Zǐcè* (紫策, "Purple Tablet") seals the Heavenly Treasure,
the *Xuānwén* (玄文, "Mysterious Script") stands solemn in the Imperial Court.
The *Xuāntiān* (玄天, "Mysterious Heaven")’s script is stern,
its secrets deeply concealed in the Emperor’s ear.

**Text:**

The *Xuānwén* (玄文, "Mysterious Script") is stern—*Xuāntiān* (玄天, "Mysterious Heaven") and *Xuānfēng* (玄风, "Mysterious Wind") are both erroneous.
Demons in throngs revere the Transformed Virtue,
ten thousand realms secure in peace.

**Central:** The *Shànghuáng Zhōnglíng Yīyáng Fánhùo* (上皇中灵一阳梵宝, "Supreme Sovereign’s Central Essence—One Yang Buddha-Treasure") *Qi* Treasure Talisman.
The Yellow Void generates the One *Qi*,
sensing transformations to form the True Essence.
The *Shàngdé* (上德, "Supreme Virtue") upholds gentleness,
golden light piercing the boundless void.

It establishes the Center, encompassing the Nine Extremes,
grasping the Root to govern the Three Celestial Stems.
Its radiance shines at the Heavenly Summit,
its flying beams dazzle the Jade Spirit.

**External Altar Praises**
The rites beyond the altar—each word rooted in *bádú* (拔度, "Extraction-Transformation"),
no trifling matter, especially at this time of mourning.
The host’s sorrow weighs heavy; chanting hymns is ill-suited.
Now, taking previous verses and newly added ones,
to aid the rites, ensuring elegance and propriety.

**Opening Chant (Zhào Míngjǔ’s *Kāifāng Jì*)**
First recite this verse, then open the talisman.
Four voices respond, extolling with intent.

*The Six Glasses* (六璃) reverse the *Yúquán* (虞泉, "Yu’s Spring")’s flow,
city walls and towers dissolve into evening mist.
When the night-watch’s chime first stirs the stillness,
the *Yīnguān* (阴关, "Dark Pass") reopens, ghosts scattering as dust.

At *Yùlóng* (玉隆) the gathering—how shall it proceed?
The inner realms divide their guardians, firm in defense.
To seek the Great Talisman wherever it may be,
one must rely on the True Edict for its proclamation.

**First Degree: Invocation of the Gods’ Verse (Newly Added, for *Dàshèng Xiānyuán Jiàozhǔ*, "Great Sage, Daoist Patriarch")**
Four-toned chant:
The Dragon Chariot descends with *Zǐqīng* (紫清, "Purple Clarity") in tow,
summoning all noble visions, banners unfurled.
The gods arrive from boundless realms,
cloud-wrapped, following the rhythmic beat of the procession.

**Second Degree: Invocation of the Departed’s Verse**
The Nightly Bureau’s cold seals tormented souls,
the *Nǚqīng Tiānzǔ* (女青天诏, "Celestial Decree of the Green Maiden") warms with mercy.
The *Língshěn* (灵婶, "Spiritual Attendant") opens the Dao’s path for wandering spirits,
the *Fǔlì* (符吏, "Talisman Scribes") hasten like swift steeds.

**Third Degree: Invocation Verse**
The Great Dao’s pity fathoms the Six Realms’ depths,
ferrying across the Sea of Suffering with a vessel of mercy.
The Purple Altar’s night opens its conveniences,
ascending to the Great Balance’s unified *Qi*.

**Bathing Verse**
First, recite the Eight Heavenly *Fànwén* (梵文, "Sanskrit Scripts"),
commanding the master to visualize—
draw the *Sānshíèr Tiān Zhēnqì* (三十二天真气, "True *Qi* of the Thirty-Two Heavens") into the bathing water,
then chant this verse.

When the verse ends, a junior disciple recites the script,
leading into the *Kējì* (科偈, "Structured Verse").

All because the heart’s defilements resist cleansing,
drifted in the Sea of Suffering, the body unclean.
The clinging stains of evil barriers remain unremoved,
the serene radiance of purity cannot be revered.
The *Jīnlóng* (金龙, "Golden Dragon") bears the *Chánggēng* (长庚, "Long Star") waters,
the *Yùnǚ* (玉女, "Jade Maiden") distributes the Imperial Seat’s incense.
Three fumigations, three washings—composing dignity,
ascending the *Yǐng* (景, "Shadow") to ride the Void, paying homage to the *Tàishàng* (太上, "Supreme Sovereign").

**Newly Added: Invitation to the Bathing Rites**
Having answered the summons, the departed—
by your recommendation, they have received the warm decree,
escaped the cold realm.
Following the scribes’ hasty steps, they arrive without walking;
glimpsing the distant banners, they respond to the call.
At the veranda’s threshold, they receive the transmitted talismans.
First, they must bathe their bodies, purify their virtue,
adjust their robes, brush their crowns,
reverently relying on the divine incantations,
the protective talismans—
lantern-waters pour to cleanse them,
the Four Spirits guard in attendance,
the Nine *Qi* weave a dense net.

Now, proclaim the Bathing Rites’ script.

**Law-Bridge Verse**
Universal offerings to the Boundless Sage,
incense smoke dispersing across the Ten Directions.
May I ride the Seven-Treasure Platform,
casting light upon the Five Turbid Worlds.
Forever guiding beings of heaven and earth,
all ascending the Law-Bridge.
Gathered in harmony, witnessing the Effortless,
diligently cultivating without retreat.

**Law-Bridge Scripture**
Assemble the Dao Assembly’s participants,
with sincere devotion, pay homage to
the Holy One of the Ten Extremes, the Five Spirits’ guiding youth.
May you grant compassion, specially descending to save and guide.

Indeed, the Sea of Desire is deep and easy to drown in—
one must trace its origins.
The Dao’s shores are high and difficult to ascend—
who will lend a hand?
Through the nature’s enlightenment and delusion,
one’s fate rises or falls between heaven and earth.
Alas, these beings in the turbid world—
their love flows like an ocean, their cruelty surges like waves,
the tides of greed and wrath churn violently,
habits accumulate like drops into torrents,
chasing after objects, the dead fill the sight—
all are self-inflicted.
Yet those who reach the shore are rare in the world.
Is there no path to draw them out?
To rescue those drowning in suffering.

Only the *Tàishàng* (太上, "Supreme Sovereign") pities all beings drowning together,
establishing the wondrous Law as a bridge,
commanding the Ten Extremes’ Celestial Lords to be the sacred pillars of the Dao’s shore,
instructing the Five Spirits’ children to be the ferry across the Sea of Paths,
pulling the lost from their wanderings,
leading them to the other shore.
Crossing the Weak Waters—three million *lǐ*,
transmitting the *Tuánjiāng Fēng* (团刚风, "Clustered-Firm Wind") five hundred billion *zhòng*,
without delay, ascending in a breath—
immediately reaching the realm of unbounded ease.
It depends on the heart’s source,
reflecting the Law’s power,
ever more—
a single step does not stray from the true cause,
nine prostrations to the Primordial Sovereign,
furthermore, the multitude of saints secretly protect,
so that the suffering sea’s souls
all ascend the Law-Bridge.

**Responding Chant**
*Dàdù Tiānzūn* (大度天尊, "Great Virtue Celestial Venerable")—
guide the departed onto the Law-Bridge.

**Next Step**
**Descending the Bridge Verse**
The Law-Bridge spans the Sea of Suffering as a crossing,
the *Tàishàng*’s compassionate vows are boundless.
In the raging waves, they encounter the *Dǐzhù* (砥柱, "Pillar"),
at the love-river’s broken bank, they meet the immortal’s *Yīnyīn* (音雕, "Echo-Carved") sound.
The *Gōngzǐ Língwén* (公子灵旛, "Noble Prince’s Spirit Banner") dispels stagnation,
the Celestial Venerable extends a hand in mutual invitation.
Taking up the martial arts, they descend the bridge toward the Jade Terrace,
the Great Talisman’s unfettered faith in unbounded ease.

**For the Departed: Taking Refuge in the Three Jewels and Repenting Sins**
The departed’s offenses—having received the summons,
they arrive at the Dao Assembly.
Now, the Golden Mouth’s precepts will be transmitted,
the *Dānwén Jiǎnzhù* (丹文简箓, "Cinnabar Script Talismans") will be bestowed.
Yet lingering obstacles remain unremoved,
fearing they may not awaken to the True Words,
reverently relying on the Three Jewels’ radiance,
repenting the Six Roots’ sins.

For sins arise from the heart—
extinguishing the heart dissolves ten thousand faults;
the will finds peace in the Dao—
seeing the Dao, the single spirit shines through.
It is fitting to purify emotions and thoughts,
cleanse the nature’s purity,
quickly abandon illusion to return to the True,
thus hearing the scriptures and attaining the Dao.

Those who perform meritorious deeds, establish vegetarian offerings,
receive talismans and precepts—
first, they must take refuge in the Supreme, True, Ten-Directional Three Jewels,
relying on the Three Jewels’ holy power,
repenting the departed’s threefold karma and transgressions.

Thus the scripture says:
*If one does not take refuge in the Three Jewels,
then all good deeds have no foundation to depend upon.*

The gathered assembly of the Dao-field,
united in sincere devotion.

**Taking refuge in the Ten-Directional Dao Treasures,**
we prostrate to the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven, the Origin,
who can absolve the departed souls of their **body-karma sins**.
We repent the departed’s boundless **body-karma sins**—
their countless transgressions too vast to measure.
In every movement, coming and going,
they were entangled in dust and defilement.
Adorned with vanity, indulging in idle pleasures,
they scorned and mocked the people of the world.

Now before the Great Compassionate Sage,
with one heart, we confess our sins.
May these **body-karma sins** be erased,
never to arise again.
In purity and stillness, we align with the Immortals,
forever free from the Three Boundaries.

**Taking refuge in the Supreme Clarity Scripture Treasure,**
we prostrate to the Highest Dao Lord,
who can absolve the departed souls of their **mind-karma sins**.
We repent the departed’s boundless **mind-karma sins**—
their countless transgressions too vast to measure.
Anger, joy, and love for the clergy,
delusion arising from the heart.
Lust and emptiness, deceit and envy,
they wronged the people of the world.

Now before the Great Compassionate Sage,
with one heart, we confess our sins.
May these **mind-karma sins** be erased,
never to arise again.
With wisdom and insight, our minds now clear,
penetrating the profound and mysterious principles.

**Taking refuge in the Supreme Purity Teacher Treasure,**
we prostrate to the Highest Old Lord,
who can absolve the departed souls of their **speech-karma sins**.
We repent the departed’s boundless **speech-karma sins**—
their countless transgressions too vast to measure.
Double-tongued and slanderous,
they defamed the sacred scriptures.
Devouring living beings, they humiliated the people of the world.

Now before the Great Compassionate Sage,
with one heart, we confess our sins.
May these **speech-karma sins** be erased,
never to arise again.
Cutting off false speech, we forever recite the True Scriptures.
In past devotion to the Three Treasures,
our repentance was the supreme cause.
May the departed now ascend to the celestial realms—
flower-adorned canopies await,
cloud-bound messengers come to welcome.
Crimson banners and azure banners,
midair guides lead the way.
Beneath the cypress groves, they forever hear the Dao’s teachings.
By the Pearl Moon Pool, only sacred hymns resound.
All sins of their past life,
now forever dissolved.

「After death, the Three Realms are traversed through present explanations.
Ascending on dragons and riding phoenixes, they wander freely through the ten highest heavens;
Realizing the Dao and attaining transcendence, they dwell in the boundless realms of the Three Pure Ones.

Blessings flow and manifest in this life and the next,
with constant fruits of merit arriving—
in this world and the next,
everlasting kinship with the Way is achieved.

The Great Sage of the Highest Path,
in His boundless compassion,
rescues all living beings,
together ascending to the Dao’s shore.

**A Second Hymn on the Inconceivable Virtues**

With humble obeisance, I take refuge in the Dao,
the Venerable Primordial Lord of Great Unity.

In the boundless void of ancestral kalpas,
from the chaos of the primordial root,
I pray You descend the Teachings of Clarity and Tranquility,
to deliver this departed soul.

All the departed,
ascend to the realm of the Immortals—
*(below follows the same for the other two Treasures)*

With humble obeisance, I take refuge in the Scriptures,
the True Words radiant in all eight directions.

Refining gold into phoenix seals,
molding jade into dragon characters,
I pray You open the Golden Mouth to expound,
and deliver this departed soul.

With humble obeisance, I take refuge in the Master,
the Venerable One among the Three Vehicles.

From before the heavens, You show boundless mercy,
through kalpas, You guide the lost and the deluded.
I pray You descend infinite teachings,
to deliver this departed soul.

I repent the sins of the departed’s eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—
the six senses, six desires, and six afflictions.
Flutes and strings resound with little true sound,
while ears delight in purple and green hues, not pure colors.

Noses compete in perfumes of orchids and musk,
tongues revel in the clamor of chariots and horses.
The body indulges in spicy excess, harming the spirit,
the mouth speaks in unchecked wrath, only seizing others’ wealth.
The mind clings to the six senses’ sins—
each sense draws the wheel of rebirth,
or even the Three Paths of suffering—
this is an error.

The Three Treasures always open the gates of salvation.
With present sincerity, I confess past transgressions,
and utterly wish for all sinful roots to be extinguished.

Next, I repent the sins of greed, anger, delusion, and ignorance—
of licentiousness, theft, killing, and falsehood.
Of defaming the Scriptures and destroying the Teachings,
not taking refuge in the Dao.
Of blaming the Way and faulting the Master,
breaking solemn vows.
Of restless fantasies in body and mind,
of senses ever stirred by greed.
From past, present, and future lives,
the sins of the Three Worlds are immeasurable.
Today, with heartfelt repentance, I confess,
and pray that all past obstructions and afflictions be removed.

Having now confessed with words to the Dao’s presence,
the multitude of saints, seated in the void,
will surely witness and judge.
The inconceivable virtues are invoked—
each with a finger-snap,
to atone for the departed’s sins.

May the departed’s bodily sins be erased,
their mental sins be erased,
their speech-karma sins be erased,
their six senses be purified,
their grudges be dissolved,
their karmic obstructions be dissolved,
all their sins be dissolved.
May the departed’s countless sins melt like frost and dew,
under the universal rays of grace.

In this life and the next,
their inherent nature remains forever serene and tranquil.
The departed soul emerges from the endless night,
no longer stagnant, now bound for the Immortal Source.

The Northern Capital cleanses the texts of past offenses,
the Southern Palace inscribes the characters of eternal life.
The Immortal hymns echo through the void,
no longer hearing the agonized voices of the underworld.

All present here vow with utmost sincerity—
may the departed ascend to heaven and find joy.

The above two hymns,
both from the *Nine Abysses Rite*,
are attributed to the Venerable Master Guangcheng.

After repentance and the granting of precepts,
the departed are guided back to their proper place—
now follows the consolation:

The departed, [name],
having already taken refuge before the Three Pure Ones,
received the Nine Precepts in person,
now stand in solemn reverence,
listening with awe and accepting with devotion.

Again, prepare the ceremonial feast,
each in their proper order,
partaking of fragrant offerings,
awaiting the completion of the grand auspicious cause.

The host gazes upon the spirit,
with pious sincerity, offering homage.
If [the departed] were fed by incantations,
then do so now.
If not fed by incantations,
then dedicate this feast back to them,
and perform the *Nine Abysses Rite*.

The *Rite for Escorting the Departed* is now complete—
the feast has ended, the law-assembly dispersed.

Receive the blessings of goodness,
and together bathe in extraordinary merit.
Following the radiant wisdom-light,
they behold the Celestial Sage.
Holding the talismans of fate,
they ascend to the Immortal Realm.

The departed, [name],
having now heard the Scriptures and listened to the Teachings,
must surely perceive their true nature and know the heavens,
and in reverence, await the Alchemical Chariot,
then rise upon the Cloud Path,
crossing the Immortal Bridge,
and at this moment, ascend to the **Red Peak Palace**.

Having now attained transcendence in this time,
each carries forth blessings—
the host, with pious sincerity,
will dutifully escort them.

**Verse**

The law-assembly’s grand merit is now fulfilled,
the departed, though distant, are fully delivered.
All together cross the Immortal Bridge,
each bearing virtues to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.

**For Daoist Communal Teachings**
The Daoist communal teachings must employ the *Three Chapters of the Scripture of Gathering*.
The Daoist communal teachings must employ the *Four Chapters of the Scripture of Gathering*.」

「The Daoist Master Lü Taigu’s *Collection of Petitions*
**Petitionary Verse**
To the Highest Functionary’s Imperial Desk—
Fragrant incense ascends, its prayers like jade flowers blooming,
Nine breaths of *qi* enfolded in mist,
Dense incense clouds weave through the heavens,
Directly piercing the Nine Celestial Realms.

The Golden Boy attends with incense,
The Jade Maiden relays the words,
Before the Celestial Sovereign,
All who hear my humble plea
Grant their favor as I speak.

**Hand-Held Incense Petition**
The Dao/Way arises from heart-mind study,
Mind transmitted through fragrant incense,
Hand clutching the jade burner,
Heart set toward the Nine Celestial Heights.

The True Spirit descends in grace,
Divine adornments attend the court,
My Lord commands me to proclaim—
Directly ascending to the Three Heavens.

**Incense on the Alchemical Altar Petition**
The Crimson Sun soars through the Nine Exalted Realms,
The luminous essence of the Primordial Crystal refined.
The Spirit Phoenix comes to perch,
Ascending to the Celestial Court of Jade.

Karmic bonds dissolve through transformation,
The Daoist Path achieves its triumph.
May this Alchemical Prayer,
Like smoke, swiftly ascend.

**Hand-Held Incense Petition**
A hundred deities arrayed in ritual,
Mind focused on the Cavernous Sun.
To the left, the True Marshal commands,
To the right, the Primordial Sovereign draws near.
Unfolding the Sacred Scroll,
The Great Brahman flourishes.
Purple smoke ascends to the heights,
Ten thousand Dao/Paths expand in splendor.

**Petitionary Verse for the Incense Offering**
Humbly heard, the boundless realm of the **Great Clarity (Taiqing)**,*
Across lifetimes, mere dust;
The august, peerless **Supreme Venerable (Wushang)**,**
Ever distant, no trace among mortals.
With reverent fasting and purification,
I now present my earnest supplication,
Hoping for a private descent of scrutiny,
A slight display of the wondrous transformation of **sentient response (ganhua)**.

Gazing afar upon the Cloud Chariot,
Temporarily departing the **Purple Expanse and Vermilion Gate’s** solemn grandeur,*
Adorned with celestial crowns and stars,
Together revealing the **Jade Treasury and Pearl Banner’s** sacred mysteries.**
With utmost sincerity, I humbly pray—
May the Heavens accept my words, as spoken.

**Altar Petitionary Text**
Humbly heard, the lofty tiers of clouds,
The Heavens do not close the path of **sentient response (ganhua)** and communion;
The human Dao/Way is vast and distant,
Yet the Saints ever descend in private grace.
With solemn reverence in my home,
I now devote myself to the **Pure and Exalted Rites (jingjiao)**.
I present the humble offerings of earthly plants,
I kindle the sacred incense to the heavens,
Daring to reveal my simple thoughts,
Humbly seeking the **Great Construction’s** divine favor.

Now, with respectful devotion to the **Celestial Science (xianke)** of this year,
I pray for the extension of the True Chariot,
Truly marking the beginning of this **fasting assembly (jianzai)**,
The first expression of my sincere service to the **Celestial Sovereign (shidi)**.

Though my offerings are meager,
The Dragon Chariot’s blessings I earnestly await.
Only this turbulent, defiled land,
Fearing to offend the Highest Clarity,
Gazing upon the **Buddha’s** fragmented form,
Increases my trembling awe.

Humbly I hope for the Cloud Chariot and Crane Procession,
Descending through the **Ninefold Celestial Gate (tiantian)**;
Vermilion banners and rainbow flags,
Halting in the **Five Impurities of the Human Realm (wuzhu)**.
The **Three Realms of Jade Emptiness (Yuxu)**,**
The **Ten Thousand Spirits of the Golden Gate (wanzhu)**,
Temporarily leaving the distant heavens,
Descending to fulfill my devout and earnest prayers.

I command the **Spirit Official of the Realm (Lingguan)**,
To solemnly oversee this **rite of purification (jiao)**.
I decree the **Guardian Officers of the Altar (weitanjiangli)**,
To drive away all malevolent influences.
May my sincere intentions resonate in **sentient response (ganhua)**,
And my fasting rites achieve their purpose,
So that I may immediately receive the **Highest Saint’s** descending grace.

**The Petitioner’s Words**
The **Altar Petitionary Text** is thus universally employed.»

The Petitioner’s Humble Words

I have heard that the **Supreme Immortal of Tranquil Stillness** acts without doing yet responds perfectly; the **Mysterious Void Dao** ever subtly communicates through attunement. Without sincere invocation of the **Numinous Methods**, how could one aspire to the **Sacred Workings**?

Now that the **Sacred Altar** has been established and the **Rite of Purification** is about to commence, I first humbly pray to the **Celestial Spirit**, then unfold the **Dao’s Precepts**. May it penetrate the **Nine Heavens above**, so all may hear and know; may it illuminate the **Three Realms below**, so all may be moved and respond. May the **Supreme Virtue** be broadly bestowed, encompassing all sentient beings.

**The Yellow Register Rite’s Sacred Petitionary Text**
The **Yellow Register Sacred Rite**, the **Purple Yang Secret Pattern**, above can **stabilize Heaven and pacify Earth**, below can **protect the nation and bring peace to the home**. It rescues the living and saves the dying, extends life and delivers from peril—held in reverence by the **Ten Thousand Heavens**, followed by the **Thousand Saints**. Its teachings unfold across the **Nine Periods**, drawing from the **Nine Yang Numbers**; its altar is structured in **Three Levels**, branching into the **Three Qi Blossoms**. It aligns the **Eight Trigrams** with the **Eight Directions**, fixes the **Ten Celestial Stems** in their **Ten Positions**. It opens the **Heaven Gate** and the **Earth Portal**, the **Ghostly Path** and the **Human Way**. The **bows and flags**, **mirrors and swords** are arrayed in solemn order; the **trays and vessels**, **earthen jars and gourds** are offered in humble simplicity. Thus does it **model Heaven and mirror Earth**, **communicate with the True and summon the Spirits**.

We, the petitioners, now begin our **first reverence**, our **initial homage**. Before the **Jade Stair’s** infinitesimal space, we dare not be disrespectful; beneath the **Celestial Countenance’s** near presence, we stand as if already above. We humbly pray that the **Three Pure Ones and Ten Extremes**, the **Ten Thousand Saints and Thousand Immortals**, temporarily leave the **Golden Gate’s** lofty heights, descending to survey the **dusty world’s** confined depths. May this humble abode become the **Pure Capital’s** celestial residence, awaiting Your gracious descent—our reverence and longing know no bounds.

**The Petitioner’s Words on the Rite’s Sacred Petitionary Text**
Thus, when the altar is first opened, the **Heavenly Gates** stand wide, the assembly is solemn and silent, our hearts pure and sincere. We emulate Heaven’s grandeur and Earth’s humility, arranging the **Heavenly and Earthly** in order; we gaze left to the **Ceremonial Standards**, right to the **Jade Carvings**, the gates aligning with **Sun and Moon**. We focus our intent within the **elaborate scriptures and ritual systems**, attuning to the **dim, elusive** yet **manifest** Spirits. With **seven days of abstinence** and **three days of fasting**, we honor the ancients’ devotion to the **Celestial Sovereign**; with **inner resolve and outward sincerity**, we pledge today’s unyielding honesty. We open the **Treasure Altar of All Marvels**, fulfilling the **past year’s and present wishes**, inviting the **feathered sages** to chant the **Deep Chapters**. The **Celestial Procession** ascends with thunderous might, the **Sacred Waters** flow like clouds and rain.

We humbly pray to the **Star Palaces and Moon Halls**, the **Vermilion Gates and Pure Capitals**, the **Deepest Mysteries**, the **Saints of the Triple Profound**. From the **Heaven of Heavens**, descending from the **Symbol Beyond Symbols**, You traverse the void with flying steps—**Zhi-Tong children** bearing **feathered banners** lead the way; **dragon chariots** and **wind-riding steeds** bring You swiftly down. You deign to observe the **fragrant offerings**, to accept the **humblest sincerity**, bestowing blessings on the living and the dead, extending mercy to the hidden and the manifest. We have already received the **Highest Spirit’s** oversight—how could we forget the **Great Response’s** omen? We await Your descent with reverent longing.

**The Petitioner’s Words on the Altar’s Sacred Petitionary Text**
All **Three Realms’ responsive Spirits**, all **True Essences**, may You hear our petitions and descend to the **fragrant altar**. Having bathed in Your radiance, we now humbly present our earnest prayers. We envision the **celestial melodies**, the **feathered retinues** standing in solemn ranks. The **wind-blown canopy** and **cloud-borne palanquin** drift near; the **rainbow banners** and **vermilion flags** appear and vanish. The **Supreme Truth** descends to this mortal realm—the **Purple Palace’s** and **Cinnabar Sky’s** processions arrive. You pause at the **changing world**, the **Jade Pool’s** and **Moon Gate’s** splendor, temporarily halting the **phoenix carriage** to survey our sincere hearts, revealing our hidden devotion, and ascending to the **Great Workings**.

I have heard that the **Dao ever responds to humanity**, Heaven ever listens below. With our **sincere devotion**, how could we neglect the **solemn beginning**? We exhaust our **inner sincerity** and **outer offerings**—the altar follows the **law’s measurements**, the **earthen jars** prioritize **substance over ornament**. The **sacrificial tokens** are arranged, each symbolizing the **Five Directions’ colors**; the **headgear and robes** are arrayed, dividing the **multitude’s ranks**. The **Dragon-Torch** flickers in **divine light**, the **incense beasts** congeal in **auspicious mist**. The **willow branches** are purified, the **flower petals** scatter in profusion. When the **high and low** take their positions, it is the moment of **Heaven and humanity’s mutual response**—**Heaven’s威** is near, the **clouds** rest in serene stillness, the **Spirits descend**, demanding utmost solemnity.

We humbly pray that the **Celestial Countenance** grant favor, the **Heavenly Gates** open wide, the **Ten Thousand Chariots** begin their journey, the **Hundred Spirits** guard the path. The **Lion and White Crane** bear the **Heavenly Standards** forward; the **Responding Dragon and Azure Qiu** guide the **Imperial Chariot** swiftly. May You not reject our **mortal sincerity**, so that the **rite’s purpose** may be fulfilled, and we may receive the **Saints’ descending grace**.

**The Petitioner’s Words on the Sacred Petitionary Text for Inviting the True**
Furthermore, we pray that the **Xiao-Shao melodies** lead the way, the **canopied carriages** follow behind. The **mist wraps the rainbow robes**, the **clouds float above the moon veils**; the **Wind Lord** clears the path, the **Rain Master** washes the dust. The **Celestial Procession** moves through the **Heavenly Roads**, scattering **treasure flowers** across the **Dharma Realm**. The **swift-flying retinues** descend to the **Dao Field**. We hope to glimpse You through the **dissipating mists**, to bare our hearts in **sincere entreaty**.

Now, as the evening’s **sincere devotion** begins and our **earnest prayers** are presented, the **rites of welcome** are complete, and our **attunement** is without flaw. The **round altar** is arranged, the **ranks of High Immortals** take their places. The **group of Spirits** departs from the **Emerald Caverns and Jade Palaces**, the **assembly of Saints** descends from the **Golden and Jade Halls**. They bear **banners and canopies**, **treasure umbrellas** following the **celestial carriages**, their **clouds** ascending like **jade**, their **light** gleaming like **stars**. The **Celestial Countenance** is solemn, **dark robes** held in readiness to listen to mortal pleas; the **Tai Mountain’s** grandeur stands firm, **golden tablets** presented to inspect the **rite’s solemnity**. The **Southern Bureau** takes up the brush to record the **virtuous** for **rebirth**; the **Northern Bureau** awaits to inscribe the **meritorious** for **salvation**.

At this very moment, even a fragment of virtue shall not fear the Three Realms’ ignorance;
With this resolve, even a slight merit shall not be surprised if the multitude of Immortals fail to record it.

How much more so when one’s devotion is profound and the assembly is sublime—
When the incense altar is solemnly arranged,
And one cultivates the twelvefold mind of virtue,
Following the three-nine gradations of fasting discipline—
Who would dare say the Saints and Worthies do not respond to mortals?
Why doubt that the hidden and manifest alike are not touched by their grace?

It is not the Dao that expands humanity—
Humanity that expands the Dao.

Now, we invite the Immortals’ passing gaze,
Follow the ritual protocols to seal the covenant,
Unfold our sincere pleadings,
And humbly appeal to the Great Work.

We humbly pray that the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms,
The Ten Directions and Ten Glories,
The Marvelous Conducted Immortals,
The True Great Saints,
The Nine-Heavenly Star Manifestations,
And the Three Realms’ Awe-Inspiring Spirits—
May they emit the five-colored auspicious light,
Cast the Nine-Peak treasure canopy,
Descend upon this sacred assembly,
Accomplish our virtuous deeds,
All as we supplicate—
And thus, the response shall be immediate and resonant.

Your servants, in reverence, declare:

Previously, we submitted a white petition to the Five Masters.
Now, the ritual feast begins, the fasting rites commence.

We gaze upon the Three Realms’ idyllic groves,
Concentrating our hearts in silent contemplation;
We summon the Nine Pure Ones’ swift celestial chariots,
Raising our hands in earnest devotion.

The array of crowned and adorned Immortals stands majestic,
Their awe-inspiring presence hovering in ethereal form—
Yet how can we reach the Jade Capital’s golden gates,
The Purple Palace’s alchemical platform,
The Celestial Palaces of Sun and Moon,
The Azure Sky’s starry halls and the Pole Star’s domain?
They soar beyond all earthly symbols,
Far beyond mortal reach—
How can we convey the sincerity of the humble,
Or offer the modest rites of the lowly?

The Masters’ treasures have long encompassed the Dao’s grace.
Now, this ritual fasting is established—
Its sincerity must be spread, its devotion must reach.

Your servant, [name], humbly reflects:
For long have I partaken in the Mysterious Transformation,
Long basked in the True Wind’s breath.
Today, I choose this auspicious hour,
Reverently fulfilling my heart’s wish.
Whether fortune or misfortune, I offer rites with utmost reverence and respect,
Speaking truth, not empty words.
Yet, alas, my understanding of the Dao’s worth is unheard,
And I am ignorant of the True Methods.
By mistake, I have been entrusted with this proclamation.

We humbly beseech the Five Masters of the Numinous Treasures,
The Moral and Daoist Saints—
Do not reject our earnest plea,
And grant us the boundless embrace of the Great Virtue.

We request that the Four Departments and Five Imperial Officials,
Along with their attendants,
Attest to this fasting ritual,
Ascend our sincere wishes,
Examine our petitions,
And in secret bestow their blessings.
May they ensure that at each moment, our prayers are relayed,
Our supplications answered,
Our wishes fulfilled,
Our virtuous deeds made manifest,
Our oaths steadfast and sincere—
So that we may, in reverence, repay their grace.

Your servants, in devotion, declare:

The altar is erected, the furnace ignited.

The **prayer** is earnestly offered to the lofty heavens,
The **heart** devotes itself to serving the **Celestial Sovereign**;

The **Purple Clouds** descend to this humble earth,
And the **Method** of summoning the **True One** is solemnly observed.
At the moment when the **Sage** first responds through **spiritual resonance**,
When the **ritual platform** is established and the **auspicious rites** commence,
We uphold **sincerity** and **earnestness**,
And dare to invoke the **Celestial Majesty**.

This **servant of the Dao**, by virtue of past **karmic causes**,
Was born in the **Land of the Five Directions**,
Possessing the **Four Great Virtues** of the realm,
And sharing in the **numinous essence** of all ten thousand things.

Our **fleshly bodies** are frail as silk,
Yet we endure the **sufferings** of the **hunted hare**;
Our **forms** are human, yet our **Daoic countenance** remains,
Fortunate to retain the **compassionate grace** of the **Sage**.

The **recompense** has not yet appeared in the **smallest particle**,
Nor has the **gratitude** faded from **day and night**.

On this **auspicious day** of **good fortune**,
With **reverence** and **resolve** in our initial **vows**,
As the **water clock’s arrow** first begins its passage,
And the **ritual bell’s tone** is newly struck,
We light the **Nine Veiled Lamps**,
Burn the **sublime incense** of myriad wonders—
Cleansing the **dusty tumult** so that the **celestial breeze** is pure,
Raising the **yin-qi** so that the **night’s luminosity** grows cold.

All the **three or four nights** of **devoted practice**,
Are fulfilled in **one step** of **sincere observance**.

May our **humble supplications** ascend and be heard,
May the **Celestial Sovereign’s** wisdom pierce through the **distant void**,
Temporarily leaving the **Primordial Chaos**,
And descending to this **jewel-pure ritual field**.

The **Celestial Maidens** and **Golden Boys**,
Dispense **heavenly fragrance** in **dense clouds**;
The **rainbow banners** and **crimson flags**,
Mingle with the **flowering rain** in **splendid array**.

Not neglecting the **lowliest blade of grass**,
Nor failing to **slightly comfort** the **long-held wishes** of the years.

Thus do we humbly address the **Five Masters of the Daoic Rituals**,
At the **forefront of the fasting assembly**.

...your humble servant hears that the **Primordial Dao** established its teachings first,
And the **Great Unity** (*Hunyuan*) already receded into **non-action** (*Wuwei*).

Across countless **kalpas** (*eons*), the **Sage** dispenses salvation to all beings,
And the **treasure of the Teacher** (*Shifu*) rests upon the **favor of the Celestial Sovereign** (*Jianming*).

Thus, in the **Mysterious Core** (*Xuanzhong*), the **Celestial Master** (*Xuanzhong*) assumes his sacred office,
Overseeing the **fasting assembly** (*Zhai*) with solemn vigilance—
Transmitting the **canon** (*Jingji*) through successive generations,
Relying upon the **Three Realms** (*Heaven, Earth, and Humanity*) for shared support,
Responding to each **spontaneous impulse** (*Suijin*) as it arises,
Granting every **sincere wish** (*Yuan*) without fail.

Now we establish this **Treasure Fasting Hall** (*Baozhai*),
Uniting the **visible and invisible** (*Youming*) to bring benefit and deliverance.
We pray that the **Celestial Sovereign** may descend upon the **dusty world** (*Chenjie*),
Bestowing grace and blessings to **pervade and extend**.

With utmost reverence, we lay bare all **common sentiments** (*Fanqing*),
And humbly beseech the **Teacher’s craft** (*Shizao*).

**At dawn** (*Qingdan*), when **Great Clarity** (*Daming*) arises from the **eastern quarter** (*Shufang*), free of all **dusty veils** (*Chenyi*),
Even as **night qi** lingers in the **level dawn** (*Pingdan*), how could **illness** (*Juezhuang*) perish?
The **Cloud Chariot** and **Crane-Drawn Vessel** hover in **leisurely flight** (*Paihuai*),
While the **wild horses** of **earthly turbidity** remain **unmoved** (*Buzheng*).

If we **entrust our fate** (*Chenming*) to the **Celestial Master’s** decrees as **disaster dissolves** (*Xiaozai*),
And **renew our stored blessings** (*Zai’chu*) with **sincere devotion** (*Qing*),
His **pity for all life** (*Haosheng*) shall be our guiding virtue—
Entering our **intentions**, may the **pure dawn** (*Jingdan*) now **practice the Dao** (*Xingdao*),
Sealing the **ritual petitions** (*Guanzou*) to the **Highest Spirit** (*Shangling*),
Humbly awaiting the **Teacher’s True Essence** (*Shizhen*), that he may **descend and grant his blessings** (*Chui’ao*).

May our **sincere devotion** (*Daocheng*) be **guided and perfected** (*Daocheng*) as the **radiant sun** (*Rao*) ascends,
And our **hidden faults** (*Qianxia*) be **subtly cleansed** (*Qianxue*) like **thin ice** melting away.
So that each **fragment of virtue** (*Pianshan*) may **prevail** (*Kexu*) beyond **demonic obstacles** (*Mozhang*),
And the **vast Teacher’s blessings** (*Hong’en*) may **pervade** (*Tian*) both **visible and invisible** (*Youming*),
Our **grateful hearts** (*Gandai*) ever **present in our thoughts** (*Shizai*).

**At noon** (*Linwu*), the **fasting rites** are **strict** (*Zhiyou*),
Beginning and ending with solemn reverence—
The **Sage’s heart** (*Shengxin*) is **unimpeachable** (*Gezhong*), neither **partial** nor **biased**.
See how the **Sage** reveals the **Great Centrality** (*Dazhong*) to all,
Like the **sun’s chariot** (*Yijiu*) driving **true and upright** (*Zhengli*), beneath the **midday sun** (*Zhongri*).
No **hidden darkness** escapes its light,
All **ten thousand things** draw upon it for their **formation and growth** (*Shengcheng*).
Every **sentiment** finds its way through,
A **single thought** strikes at it and **resonates** (*Koudazhou*).
Thus, when we now **stand at noon** (*Linwu*),
We **again approach** (*Zai*) to **offer our sincerity** (*Shucheng*),
Unveiling our **heartfelt words** (*Ciqing*),
And **daring to petition** (*Maogan*) the **Teacher’s ear** (*Shitong*).

As it has been spoken above (*Yuruyun*).
**In the still night** (*Jingye*).

The **Four Seasons** resound with clarity,
The sky is free of haze and filth,
The **Divine Wind** stirs in silence,
The earth is cleansed of all malevolent dust.

The **Big Dipper’s handle** stretches across the void,
Lifting **heartfelt words** to the celestial expanse;
The **moonlight** washes the night,
Chilling the **qi** in bone and hair.

Trembling with reverence, we **diligently** extend our offerings;
With **lofty sincerity and depth**, we humbly await the **Teacher’s** gracious hearing.

We **press upon** the **True One’s** essence,
Hoping to fulfill all that should be done.

As it has been spoken above (*Yunyun*).

**The Original Command Scripture**

Above, it mirrors the **Heavenly Vault** (*Huntian*),
Dividing the **Three Celestial Exaltations** (*Sanxing*) along the **Lunar Lodges** (*Jingwei*) and **Solar Paths** (*Wei*).

**Great Clarity** establishes its teachings,
Spreading the **Two Dipper Stars** (*Erdou*) across the **Water** (*Kan*) and **Fire** (*Li*) constellations.

It proclaims the **Original Command’s** grand framework,
Unfolding the **Mysterious Spirit’s** essential keys.

For **humanity’s foundation** lies in the **Seven Elements** (*Qi Yuan*).
Heaven’s **Dipper’s Crown** (*Doubei*) measures the **Original Qi**,
Binding **life and fate** to the **Five Bodies** (*Wuti*).
It governs **longevity and early death**,
Determining a life’s rise or fall.

Thus, when the **cosmic cycles** unfold,
One must **contemplate the Six Degrees** (*Liu Du*),
To descend blessings upon the mortal realm,
Extending the **fragrance and light** for all to **return and invest**.

Therefore, those who attain **three lifetimes’ merit** as **sons of the Dao**,
Should **observe fasts and establish rituals** (*Zhai Jiao*),
Contribute according to their means,
Offer water and flowers in gratitude,
Repaying **karmic roots** as circumstances allow.

At the **Boar Hour** (*Jianchen*), they must not let the moment pass in vain,
But **ascend in reverence**, extending **longevity’s blessings**—
Their voices should rise like **grain’s resonance**,
Their light should answer like **reflections**.

**The True Martial Scripture**

**Entering the Mind**

**The True Martial Scripture**

In the **Pure Celestial Domain** (*Ta Qing*), the **forms and colors** (*se xiang*) are not absent but **serene and still** (*zhan ji*). Descending to the **Northern Pole** (*Bei Ji*), its **awe and authority** (*wei quan*) are **fierce yet benevolent** (*he her yi ci ren*).

It **views the people as wounded** (*shi min ru shang*), **grinding its teeth** (*qie chi*) against the **proliferation of demons** (*qun mo zhi si kuo*). **Compassion for life** (*hao sheng wei zhong*) is paramount, **pushing forth its heart** (*tui xin*) to stir the **sorrow of all beings** (*zhao shu zhi xing ai*).

It **assists the upright and crushes the perverse** (*fu zheng cui xie*), **dissipating calamities and bestowing blessings** (*xiao zai jiang fu*). Though **forty-two years of Daoist cultivation** (*sui shi er jian chen xiu dao*) and **thousands of rituals’ fulfillment** (*san qian yu hang zhi cheng gong*) may be required, the **origin from the Golden Gate’s transformation** (*ben cong jin que zhi hua shen*) and the **manifestation of all beings’ proof of enlightenment** (*ming shi zhong sheng zhi zheng guo*) are what enable it to **circulate through the six directions** (*zhou xing liu he*), **commanding awe in all beings** (*wei she wan ling*).

**All five pestilences** (*wu wen*)—**minor demons** (*xiao mo*)—
and the **six heavens’ malevolent qi** (*liu tian zhi gu qi*), **ensnared in white dragon shadows** (*zhong bai hong ying guo*), **dissolve into dust** (*hua zuo chen ai*).

With **dual eyes flashing like lightning** (*shuang jing dian zhong*), **it exterminates all remaining evil** (*chao wu yu lei*).
Thus, **demonic evils are annihilated** (*de yi mo ying mie*), **and households and states alike are at peace** (*jia guo xian ning*).

On the **seventh day of each month** (*mei yue san qi zhi chen*), the **True Lord descends to the mortal realm** (*shi zhen jun jiang fan zhi ri*), one should **extend offerings of fragrance and light** (*yin xian huo zhi gong fu*), **to repay favors and rest** (*yi da en xiu*).

**The Scripture for Pacifying the Dwelling**
Hearken to the **age of Youxiao** (*You Chao Shi zhi shi*), when people **ate acorns and chestnuts** (*shi xiang li zhi*) and **lived in trees, nesting** (*qi mu ju chao*).
In the **time of Xuanyuan** (*Xuan Yuan Shi zhi shi*), they **changed their homes** (*yi dong yu*) to **shelter from wind and rain** (*dai feng zhi yu*).

Thus, the **old and young among the people** (*shi min ren zhi lao you*) may **rest securely** (*an zuo xi*) in **dawn and dusk** (*xiao hun*).

Only the **Sage** (*Sheng Ren*) **adapts to the needs of things** (*qi wu zhi yi*), **for the greatest benefit of all under heaven** (*wei tian xia suo li zhi da*).

Yet, **Yin and Yang have shifts of ascendance and decline** (*yin yang you yi fu zhi bian*), **cold and heat bear pestilential evils** (*han shu you ci li zhi xie*). When people **transgress these** (*ren huo mo zhi*), **calamities are unavoidable** (*zai suo bu mian*).

Thus, the **Highest Sovereign** (*Tai Shang*) **commands the spirits and assigns duties** (*ming shen ling er shou zhi*), **to guard the dwellings of common folk** (*wei fan fu wei zhe yu*). **Dividing their roles** (*yi fen si*), **the Grandfather Star** (*Tai Sui*) is held in **highest reverence** (*wei zun*), **and one year is taken as the standard law** (*yi yi nian wei zhun fa*). **Compassion for life** (*hao sheng wei zhong*) is their **primary duty** (*zhu yu*), **and banishing evil comes first** (*qu e zhi ju xian li*).

The **spirits of the Heavenly Pit and Magua Mouth** (*tian keng ma kou zhi shen*), **swallowing demons and devouring ghosts** (*tun mo shi gui*).
The **clan of Yellow Grinding Wheels** (*huang mi zhi shu*), **with leopard tails** (*bao wei*), **protect the righteous and crush the perverse** (*hu zhe cui xie*).

**In their proper positions, they discern directions** (*zheng wei bian fang*), **securely maintaining their duties** (*tuo ling shou zhi*).
They **declare the Highest Sovereign’s awe and authority** (*xuan tai shang wei quan zhi hua*), **warding off all beings’ potential for harm** (*fang zhong sheng heng hai zhi yu*).

Who would have thought that **people vary in wisdom and folly** (*shi ren you xian yu mo*), **ignoring prohibitions and warnings** (*wang ming jin ji*)?
The **spirits are bold and fierce** (*shen wei yong han*), **knowing no distinction between light and dark** (*mo jian you ming*).

To **offend them** (*fan zhi*) is to **invite calamity without cause** (*wu gu mo zhi fen*).
To **provoke them** (*gan zhi*) is to **ensure disasters and misfortune** (*bi shi zai xiong zhi bian*).

Fortunately, the **Highest Sovereign** (*Tai Shang*) **twice pities common folk** (*cai min fan fu*), **issuing talismans** (*chu fen wen*) **to bring peace** (*an ning*), **proclaiming incantations** (*xuan zhou fa*) **to serve as warnings** (*jing jie*). All **hundreds of spirits obey its commands** (*bai shen ting qi ling*), **and hidden ghosts submit to its oaths** (*you gui qing qi meng*). Thus, **those who transgress in ignorance** (*mo fan zhe zhuan huo wei xiang*) **turn misfortune to good fortune** (*huan zai zhi fu*), **and those who return and invest** (*gui tou zhe que zai zhi fu*) **avoid disasters and attain blessings** (*xu zai zhi fu*). **Humans and deities alike benefit** (*ren tian meng li*), **and households and states share its grace** (*jia guo zhan en*).

The **Daoist Gate’s universal teachings** (*dao men tong jiao*) **must employ the four final volumes** (*bi yong ji juan zhi si jing*)—
**The Yellow Arrow Talisman** (*Huang Que Dao Shi Lü Tai Gu Ji*), **Volume One: For the State’s Scripture** (*Guo Zhi Tan Jing Wen*).

The **Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue** (*De Dao Jing*) is **the text of non-action** (*wu wei zhi wen*), **the transformation of nature** (*zi ran zhi hua*). It stands **unbounded beyond the Great Desert** (*luo luo tai mo zhi biao*), **towering before the August Emperor’s image** (*wei wei xiang di zhi xian*). **The two qi** (*er qi*) **rely upon it to establish their roots** (*zi zhi yi li gen*), **the three luminaries** (*san guang*) **hold it to form their manifestations** (*chi zhi yi cheng xiang*). **Subtle yet all-pervasive** (*xi wu bu ru*), **vast yet all-encompassing** (*da wu bu bao*), its **true essence** (*qi zhen*) **governs the self** (*yi zhi yi shen*), **and its practice** (*qi tu*) **extends to all under heaven** (*yi xing jia qie yu shen zhi yi cheng xiang*). Its **function** (*qi gong*) **elevates all beings** (*du qun pin*), **and its profound subtlety** (*qi wei miao*) **can attain immortals** (*zhi shen xian*).

In ancient times, **Laozi passed through Hanguang Pass** (*Lao Zi zhi guo Han Guan*), **bestowing eighty-one chapters** (*shou ba shi yi zhang*) **before departing**. **Emperor Wen of Han** (*Han Wen zhi cong*) **followed the Yellow River’s teachings** (*cong he shang zhi jiao*), **and though seventeen centuries passed**, **the transmission remained** (*gai qian qi bai nian er jin chuan*). **Exhausting the inexhaustible** (*qiong hu wu qiong*), **reaching the limitless** (*ji hu wang ji*), it **proclaims the essentials of the Dao and Virtue** (*xuan dao de zhi yao*), **serving as the teacher of emperors** (*wei di wang zhi shi*).

As for **ascending to the Mysterious** (*sheng xuan*), **it expounds the sounds of purity** (*yan qing jing zhi yin*), **entering the gates of myriad marvels** (*ru zhong miao men*), **while transcending all defilements** (*li zhu ran zhe*). It **expiates calamities and lists the ranks of repentance** (*rang zai lie chui hui zhi pin*), **delivering all beings from adversity** (*du yi qie e*). **Whatever it treads upon is secure and at peace** (*suo li ping an*).

**The Yellow Emperor composed the Scripture of the Dark Symbol** (*Huang Di zhuo yin fu zhi shu*), **which can be employed as a teacher against ten thousandfold adversaries** (*ke yong shi yu wan bei*).
**The Green Silk robe transmitted the incantations of celestial luminaries** (*qing luo chuan xing yao zhi zhou*), **which can manipulate the cycles of the Five Phases** (*ke tui yun yu wu xing*).

All these **unlock the singular decision** (*jie yi jue*), **revealing the mysteries of the Dao** (*shen dao zhi yu wei*), **and expound the hidden profundities of the Mysterious Pivot** (*yan xuan zong zhi yin ao*). **Reciting it makes one’s voice resonate with the Supreme Ultimate** (*song zhi ze sheng can tai ji*), **studying it elevates governance to peace and harmony** (*yan zhi ze zhi hua sheng ping*). **Disasters vanish from the Nine Yin** (*huo mie jiu yin*), **and blessings permeate all ten thousand realms** (*ze han wan yu*).

**The blessings flow to the lineage and community** (*qing liu zong she*), **and sitting in meditation, one faces boundless rest** (*zuo dui wu jiang zhi xiu*).
**The incantations align with the Sage and the Deity** (*qing ge shen ren*), **silently dissolving the insoluble adversities** (*qian xiao nan jie zhi e*).

Again, **offering hymns of praise** (*zai yin ji zong*), **to complete the eulogy** (*yi jin zan yang*).

**The ten directions reverently uphold the sacred treasure of salvation** (*shi fang yan jiu ku zhi bao jun*), **and the Nine Abysses receive the spiritual scripture of the seal of the heart** (*jiu you shou xin yin zhi ling pian*). **All beings are universally delivered** (*pu du tian ren*), **the ferry across life and death** (*jin liang sheng si*). Thus, **those who face the long night of suffering** (*ba dui zhi chang ye*) **are all listed among the ranks of the Highest Purity** (*xian lie ming yu shang qing*).

Again, **reciting verses** (*zai yin ji zhang*), **to extend salvation and deliverance** (*yi jin ji du*).

矧乃玄元之教，莫非清静之门。

**We cannot transcend the body, thus incurring many bodily afflictions; we cannot seal our mouths, thus accumulating many verbal transgressions.**

意有所至，爱有所忘；

今则对列真而忏悔；
**Now, we stand before the numinous and true, and repent.**
体妙道以修为。
**We embody the profound Dao to cultivate our practices.**

诸业生於诸根，尘尘是妄；
**All activities arise from the Six Senses, and each particle of dust is illusory.**
有身孰不有患，物物迷真。
**With a body, who does not have afflictions? Each thing veils the true.**

爰即灵坛

**The flattering deceits of insincerity are all removed,
the clinging evils of greed are utterly purged.
Past deeds already wrought shall never again tread the wheel of retribution;
future calamities yet to befall shall never be cast into the abyss.

Thus may we preserve the body whole and keep harm at bay,
never chasing profit while forsaking the True.

With humble devotion, we pray to the Radiant Saints:
May their luminous insight pierce through all darkness,
and with the waters of the Jade Pool,
purify the hearts of all;
with the blossoms of Ambrosial Dew,
cleanse away all defilements.

May the roots of guilt wither and vanish,
and the luminous wisdom-nature shine perfectly round.
With reverence, we follow the rites of storing virtue,
to fulfill the pattern of prolonging life.

If not the birthday of the Sage,
then let us instead cultivate a steadfast heart for goodness,
awaiting the blessings of benevolent grace.

May misfortune sink into the Nine Abysses,
and blessings spread across the Ten Directions.

We, the humble servants, prostrate and offer thanks to the Supreme Triple Jewel of the Most High True One.

**On Repentance:**
This repentance is for living beings still in existence,
to purify the mind and still the thoughts,
to serve the Celestial Sage with clarity—
not for the departed, lest there be misunderstanding of intent,
and names of the dead be mistakenly invoked,
for human affairs and the Dao are utterly distinct.

I have heard:
To seek the True Essence beyond form,
the Dao is pure and boundless;
To awaken vast aspirations within the world,
its principle returns to purity and stillness.

「To purge the external afflictions is not enough—
only then may one behold the Celestial Sage’s luminous presence.

To repent and cleanse the dust of worldly attachments—
only then may one properly fulfill the rites of the **sacrificial hall (斋直)**.

Now, we humble servants repent and dedicate ourselves to the Dao,
from the distant past through countless **kalpas (劫)**, down to this very life.
All deeds of body, speech, and mind,
witnessed by Heaven, Earth, and humanity—**the Six Perceptions (六见)**.

Where there is a body, there is great affliction,
long-accumulated sins and transgressions;
all actions arise from the **Six Senses (六根)**, yet the **evil obstructions (恶障)** remain unremoved.

To indulge in **sensual pleasures (声色)**, to abandon oneself in licentiousness,
when **vital energy (血气)** is strong, the calamity of strife arises;
when **desires (嗜欲)** overflow, the sickness of life and death beckons,
ever turning from the True to the False,
struggling to free the mind while binding the spirit.

At the commencement of these **sacrificial rites (斋事)**, we fear the **Nine Heavens (九霄)** may remain distant.
We wish to bathe in the **Great Mysterious Waters (太玄之水)**,
to wash away the **Six Evil Roots (六恶根)**;
to seek the **Six Perfections (六度)** as a vessel,
to reach the **Dao’s shore (道岸)**.

To cultivate the **fruit of non-outflow (无漏果)**,
to block the **pathways of all malevolent forces (众邪门)**;
to cleanse the **Five Poisons (五菔)** and **Six Dusts (六尘)**,
to sever the **Ten Fetters (十缠)** and **Nine Bonds (九结)**.

With one heart enlightened,
all sins dissolved into emptiness.

We vow from this day until the next life,
never again to ensnare ourselves in the **net of karma (业网)**.

May the **Pure Celestial Court (清都)** observe our sincere devotion,
and the **Supreme Polarity (紫极)** return its boundless grace,
acknowledging our earnest striving,
and bestowing its vast benevolence generously.

For **past sins (阴愆)** and **present transgressions (阳过)**,
whether **retribution from former lives (上世流注之殃)**,
or **entanglements with the Six Relatives (六亲)**—
these ties, whether **fated in past incarnations (宿世所造)** or **slandered by enemies (仇家所诬)**,
the **poisonous winds and malevolent qi (毒风恶气)**,
the **torment of demons and malevolent beings (魔鬼凶人)**—
we pray that the **Dao’s wind (道风)** may sweep them all away,
cleansing and purifying the **form and spirit (气形)**,
so that at the **sacrificial altar (坛枪)**,
we may stand upright before the **Nine Ancestral Spirits (九祖)**,
and attain the **fruit of the Celestial Sage (上仙)** in the future.

May we ascend to the **Everlasting Spring of the Nine Heavens (九天不夜之长春)**,
and reach the **Realm of the Celestial Caverns (洞阳)**;
with **Three Kinds of Karma (三业)** unrooted, we depart forever
from the **host of malevolent ghosts (万鬼)**.

Blessings spread across the **Ten Directions (十方)**,
misfortune sinks into the **Nine Abysses (九夜)** forever.

We, the humble servants, prostrate and offer thanks to the **Supreme Triple Jewel of the Most High True One (无上至真三宝)**.

**On the Opening of the Way (外坛开方):**
The texts for opening the way are not singular;
the most fitting originates from **Master Chao (巢先生)**’s cultivation of goodness.
Others may recount the **virtues of the Five Phases (五行之德)**,
or explain the **origins of ghosts and gods (鬼神之由)**—
these too are appropriate, yet none surpass the efficacy of this text alone.

The **Nine Dragons (九龙)** bear the decree,
ascending the spirits accumulated in darkness;
the **Six Ghosts (六鬼)** clash in battle,
cutting off the path to rebirth.

The **Most High (太上)** manifests through the **illuminated teachings (明训)**,
and the **Divine Official (神公)** sweeps away the inauspicious.
With reverence, we present the **sacred rites (典彝)**,
and humbly extend our **petitions (关告)**.

To hope for the **Bright Spirits (明灵)** to respond,
we first rely on the **chanting of the Daoist hymns (梵呗)** to exalt their names.
We invoke the **Universal Compassion (众慈)**,
and all voices resonate in harmony.

We take refuge in the **Eastern Lord (东方主)、Jade Treasure Emperor of Heaven (玉宝皇上天尊)**,
the **Southern Lord (南方主)、Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Truth and Ten Thousand Blessings (玄真万福天尊)**,
the **Western Lord (西方主)、Heavenly Emperor of Ultimate Marvel and Supreme Polarity (太妙至极天尊)**,
the **Northern Lord (北方主)、Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Mystery and Jade Purity (玄上玉宸天尊)**,
and the **Central Lord (中央主)、Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Unity and Rescue from Suffering (太乙救苦天尊)**,
whose **inconceivable merits (不可思议功德)** are vast.

With incense now burning,
we earnestly invoke the **Five Directions’ Open Path Great Gods (五方开路大神)**,
the **Earthly Sovereigns (地界主)**.

May the **Divine Benevolence (神慈)** descend and accept,
the **sacrificial altar (香坛)** bear witness,
and our **sincere prayers (虔祷)** enter their hearts.

Indeed, the **unfathomable interplay of yin and yang (阴阳不测)** is the **Divine Mystery (神之妙)**;
the **limitless transformations (变化无方)** are the **True Dao (道之真)**.

Only the **Most High (太上)** encompasses the **Divine Mystery of yin and yang (阴阳不测之神)**,
and exhausts the **True Dao of endless transformations (变化无方之道)**.

With **Six Penetrations (六通)** and **Four Liberations (四辟)**,
its power endures eternally;
instantaneous departures and sudden arrivals,
piercing all obstructions with clarity.

Descending as spirits to fulfill **manifestations (赴感)**,
embodying the Dao to respond to humanity.

Those who receive **transmission (受度)** are not divided by life or death,
and those who return to the **True Dao (皈真)** are not bound by distance or proximity.

Let it be so that a thousand years may pass in an instant,
and ten thousand miles become as near as a hand’s span.
At the **sacrificial rites (醮席)**, we listen to the **lawful sounds (法音)**,
and in the **Celestial Court’s morning (朝上帝)**, we ascend to the **True Dao (登真)**,
hearing the **song of the void (空歌)** while awakening to the **Way (悟道)**.

Should any **pursued spirit (灵识)** fail to arrive at the altar,
or if **all earthly officials (地司)** dare to obstruct with deceit,
hindering the **wandering souls (幽魂)** or blocking the **path to rebirth (生路)**,
the **Heavenly Decrees (天宪)** are stern,
and the **True Dao’s rites (真科)** will not be forgiven.

Now, the **sacrificial official (斋官)** of this household
commences these **extraordinary rites (殊常之斋范)**,
inviting all **high Daoists (高真)** of the **Three Realms (三界)**.
Lanterns and stars stretch across the **Jade Slip (玉绳)**,
and incense smoke ascends to the **Golden Gate (金阙)**.

Hearing the **hidden melody of the Celestial Courts (诸天一声之隐韵)**,
all **karma of a hundred lives (百生之业障)** dissolves;
listening to the **piercing chapter of the Nine Judgments (司马九过之洞章)**,
the **forms and spirits of the Three Thousand (三万之形神)** are fully manifested.

The **departed ascend, the living are transformed (前亡后化)**—
at every moment, spirits rise.
Yet we still fear the **three worlds’ lost souls (三世幽魂)**,
and **nine springs’ trapped spirits (九泉滞魄)**,
those who have not yet been **offered salvation (荐拔)**,
suffering the utmost **pity and lamentation (悲酸)**.

Thus, we request the **talisman of eternal life and rescue from suffering (长生救苦之符)**,
and humbly accept the **precepts of earnest devotion (克勤之戒)**,
to proclaim within the **Yellow Talisman Altar (黄箓坛内)**,
and present before the **Most High’s Court (太上御前)**.

First, we admonish the **spirits and deities (神祇)**,
and open the **Five Pathways’ messengers (开辟五路使者)**,
like an **unstoppable boat (不击之舟)**,
coming and going without obstruction.

Like **cranes freed from their cage (出笼之鹤)**,
soaring unrestrained in the sky.
Oh, you **multitude of spirits (众灵)**,
clear the path!
All **petitions and records (文牒)** are solemnly declared.

Once declared,
present the **petitions and records (文牒)** above,
and instruct all **gentle deities (柔祇)** broadly.
If there are no records,
descend from the path below,
and ascend to report,
instructing all **gentle deities (柔祇)** broadly.

Oh, **responsible deities (神司)**,
swiftly follow the **Dao’s teachings (道训)**!

To the **local deities (界土地)**,
the **village and city spirits (里社城隍)**,
the **guardians of boundaries and protectors of realms (守疆护界)**,
and all **upright spirits (正神)**—
we command you to **clear the path (辟道路)**,
and **guide the departed (接引亡人)**.

Where there are **barriers (关者)**, swiftly open them;
where there are **ferries (津者)**, swiftly transport them.
Do not **block or hinder (勿壅勿遏)**,
do not **delay or pause (勿稽勿停)**.
To those **entangled in litigation (阴讼者)**,
do not **detain or imprison (勿得拘留)**.
To those **bound by grievances (冤对者)**,
do not **entangle or bind (勿得缠缚)**.

For those coming from the **East (东来)**,
the **Green Cavalry General (青骑将军)** shall escort them;
from the **West (西来)**,
the **Great God of the Gui Trigram (兑卦大神)** shall protect them;
from the **South (南来)**,
the **Red Bird’s (朱雀)** earthly pathways are made smooth;
from the **North (北来)**,
the **Dark Tortoise’s (玄武)** realm is opened wide.

Without **far or near (无远无近)**,
without **affinity or estrangement (无亲无疏)**,
we follow the **Green Decree’s (依女青)** command,
and review the **names and surnames of the ancestral spirits (先灵之名姓)**.

「沿路关报，逐界申闻，
along the way, announce to the officials,
and in each domain, proclaim the message.

拨发前来，斯须无滞，
dispatch them forthwith—
no delay shall hinder their passage.

即使亡过某等，
Even if they have committed grave offenses,
如晨风之趋林，
like the morning wind rushing toward the forests,
如夜蛾之赴火，
like the night moths drawn to flames,
如水之东注，
like water flowing eastward,
如马之出奔，
like horses breaking free from their bonds,
径赴道场，
they shall proceed directly to the Daoist ritual hall,
领沾功德。
to partake in the merit and virtue of the rites.

若有六天故气，
If there are lingering resentments from the Six Heavens (*liùtiān*—六天),
孽鬼妖神，
or malevolent spirits and demonic deities,
妄肆猖狂，
acting recklessly and without restraint,
敢生邀阻，
who dare to obstruct or hinder,
请戮路左，
let them be slaughtered by the wayside—
以明天诛。
to make manifest the Heavenly punishment.

道法甚严，
The Daoist laws are strict,
天威难犯，
and Heaven’s wrath is not to be provoked.
度人功大，
the merit of guiding souls is vast,
风火不停，
and the winds and flames shall not cease.
道路山川，
Let all paths and rivers
急急传命，
swiftly convey this command:
载伸偈颂，
carrying forth hymns of praise,
感格神灵。
to move and honor the divine spirits.

举不可思议功德。
All these inconceivable merits are invoked.

ascending to the Fire-Purification Pool (*huǒliànchí*—火炼池).
空洞谣歌齐赞咏，
Let all empty and resonant hymns unite in praise,
敢凭道力拯灵仪。
and let them rely on the Dao’s power to rescue the sacred souls.

黄箓大斋第一度：
The First Degree of the Grand Fast of the Yellow Offerings (*huánglù dàzhāi*—黄箓大斋):

召请祀典神祇，
I summon and invite the deities of the ritual traditions,
泬寥戒夜，
on nights of solemn purity (*pǒngliáo jièyè*—泬寥戒夜),
沆瀣澄空，
when the *Hángxiè* (沆瀣) clears the heavens,
伫神听之格思，
awaiting the divine response with reverent contemplation,
控忱诚而惕若。
holding my sincere devotion in check with utmost vigilance.

入意以今恭率法众，
With this solemn intent,
I lead the assembled ritualists (*fǎzhòng*—法众)
in the First Degree’s invocation—

召请古先帝王、

凡该祀典诸庙福德灵享，
all deities enshrined in temples of ritual tradition,
伏愿暂迂飙驭，
I humbly pray that they temporarily abandon their swift celestial chariots (*biàoyù*—飙驭),
降赴道场，
and descend to this Daoist hall,
领录斋功，
to receive the merit of this fast,
证明修奉。
and witness its observance.

伏以大道弘化，
I humbly submit that the Great Dao/Way (*dàdào*—大道)
has spread its vast teachings,
真一播灵，
and the *True Unity* (*zhēnyī*—真一) has disseminated its sacred influence.
三清为众圣之先，
The Three Pure Ones (*sānqīng*—三清) are the foremost of all saints,
弥罗冠万天之首。
and *Mile* (*mílúo*—弥罗) is the crown of all heavens.

旁分九气，
They govern the nine breaths of *Qi* (*jiǔqì*—九气),
复品四人，
and embody the four cardinal virtues.
踰劫历之先，
Before the eons of the past,
出阴阳之表，
they transcended the realms of *Yin* and *Yang* (*yīnyáng*—阴阳).
三界为超凡之始，
The Three Realms (*sānjiè*—三界) mark the beginning of their transcendence,
八梵为元阳之初。
and the Eight *Brahmins* (*bāfàn*—八梵) are the origin of the Primordial Yang.

The Mysterious Yellow (*Xuánhuáng*—玄黄) intermingles in resonance,

and the Great Primordial Essence (*tàisù*—太素) manifests its forms.

对越在天，
They face each other in the heavens,
准尊元首。
and align with the august Primordial Sovereigns.

於是冬居营室，
Thus, in winter they dwell in *Yingshi* (营室),
夏处层巢，
and in summer they reside in *Cencháo* (层巢).
饮血茹毛，
They consume blood and raw flesh,
结绳识事。
and use knotted cords to record matters.

迨及燧人钻火，
When the time came for *Suirén* (燧人) to drill fire,
伏牺画爻，
and *Fuxi* (伏牺) to inscribe the *Yao* (爻),
炎帝肇基，
*Yandi* (炎帝) established the foundations,
有熊御世，
and *Youxiong* (有熊) ruled the age.
帝誉顺天而行义，
The Sovereign *Yuyu* (帝誉) followed Heaven’s will
and practiced righteous governance,
高阳任地以依神，
*Sovereign Gaoyang* (高阳) entrusted himself to the Earth
and relied upon the divine.
夏后祖于唐虞，
The *Xia* sovereigns (*Xiàhòu*—夏后) succeeded the *Tang* and *Yu* (唐虞) eras,
殷命法乎三圣，
and the *Shang* dynasty (*Yīn*—殷) took its mandate
from the Three Saints (*sāshèng*—三圣).
文武为继代之主，
The *Wen* and *Wu* (文武) sovereigns were the successors of their age,
汉唐宗拨乱之君，
and the *Han* and *Tang* (汉唐) emperors were the ancestral lords
who calmed the chaos.
莫不龙虎勃兴，
None failed to rise like dragons and tigers,
风云际会。
or gather the winds and clouds in auspicious confluence.

又况世分治乱，
Moreover, in an age divided between governance and chaos,
臣有忠良，
there were loyal and virtuous ministers,
莫非理国以辑民，
who did not fail to govern the realm
and bring order to the people.

泽流万世，
and their blessings flow through countless ages.
膺上帝之休命，
They received the Heavenly Mandate of auspicious fate,
授列职之仙班。

All these divine, sagely, and enlightened sovereigns
皆证清高崇峻之位，
have attained the lofty and pure ranks,
曳裾八极，
their robes trailing through the eight cardinal directions,
腾景九天。
and their radiance ascending to the Nine Heavens.

经若不传，
Had the scriptures not been transmitted,
世莫能显。
the world would not have known their glory.

复有忠臣贤佐、良辅元勋，
There are also loyal ministers, virtuous counselors,
and meritorious aides and great officials of merit—
位列仙阶，
their ranks listed among the celestial immortals,
名垂信史，
their names recorded in trustworthy histories.
或享世间庙食之盛，
Some enjoy the grand offerings of mortal temples,
或主岳渎鬼神之权。
others hold authority over the mountain altars and waterways of spirits.

故风后为太华真人，
Thus, *Feng Hu* (风后) is the True Person of the *Tai hua* (太华),

---

...and those who govern the authority over the mountain altars and waterways of spirits.

Thus, *Zhao Gong* (召公) and *Ji Zi* (季子) are both the Lords of *Southern Brightness* (南明) and *Northern Brightness* (北明);
*Qi Heng* (齐恒) and *Jin Wen* (晋文) hold the office of *Director of the Celestial Command* (司命都禁).

*Yuan Gui* (元规) and *You Yu* (幼舆) serve as *Left Celestial Guards* (左司禁);
*Yuan Zhi* (元直) and *Shen Yuan* (深源) are the *Morning Attendants of the Sovereign* (侍帝晨).

*Tao Shiheng* (陶士衡) is the *Marquis of the Western River* (河西侯),
*Wen Tai Zhen* (温太真) is the *Duke of the Supervised Sea* (监海伯).

All these virtuous sages have their appointed duties,
Their advancement is reckoned by years of service,
Their promotion is determined by merit and diligence.

Thus, the *Northern Sovereign* (北帝) changes every three thousand years,
The mountain altars and waterways are relocated every six hundred years.
*Wu Jie* (武解) is the *Ghost King beneath the Earth* (地下鬼王),
*Wen Jie* (文解) is the *Master beneath the Earth* (地下主者).

Those of utmost loyalty and filial piety,
Of utmost chastity and integrity,
Initially serve as *Ghost Officials* (鬼官),
Then ascend to the *Caverns of the Dao* (洞府).

Most are promoted every one hundred and forty years,
Entering the feast at *Eastern Hua* (东华);
Their ranks advance through *twenty-seven grades* (二十七品),
Only then escaping the *Great Calamity* (大劫).

The *Heavenly Court’s* (上天) promotions and demotions are profound and mysterious,
Not discernible by the limited senses of the mortal realm.

Only through accumulated merit and virtue do they gradually attain *Daoist immortality* (仙位).
How much more so in this land of *Sichuan’s* (兹庸蜀) *abundant Daoist networks* (井络之地),
Which truly rests upon the auspicious foundation of *Zeng Chang* (曾昌)!

The *divine horses of gold and green birds* (金马碧鸡) are revered by imperial decree,
The *copper gates and jade ramparts* (铜关玉垒) of their temples protect the *Earthly Foundation* (坤维).

The *group of celestial lords* (群望) governs in appointed roles,
While the *mild and virtuous* (柔示) are stationed in their places.

From *Sichuan* (蜀郡), this system is extended by analogy,
Covering all lands—each has its *Daoist framework* (纲维).

Mountains and rivers, the nine regions,
Jade and silk offerings from myriad lands,
All are governed by spirits.

The *hidden and distant temples* (幽隐庙貌) are everywhere,
From near to far—those who benefit the people
Are honored by all spirits.

Now, there is a family dedicated to the Dao,
Who follows the *Nine Altars’* (九坛) traditions and rituals,
Who observes the *Three Arrow* (三箓) rites of the Dao,
Ascending to the *Idyllic Heaven* (郁罗之天),
Encompassing the *Heavenly and Earthly Realms* (乾坤之界),
Descending to the *Abyssal Daoist Caverns* (洞渊之府),
And reaching into the *Remote Northern Lands* (朔都之乡).

With a single thought, they resonate with the *True and Authentic* (真灵),
And all spirits gather in response.

To the *Heavenly, Earthly, Watery, and Land-based* (天地水陆),
They pray and make offerings in all directions;
The spirits of mountains and rivers, of all lands,
Assemble in the *boundless* (无方).

I humbly pray that the *One True Spirit* (大恢得一之灵)
May come from the *boundless* (无方),
To fulfill the command of *summoning the True Person with the Jade Tablet* (碧简招真),
And to join the ranks of *those who attend the Golden Portal* (金阙朝真),
To exalt the *Heavenly Auspices* (天休),
And to safeguard the *imperial lineage* (国祚).

May they *seal the powers of life and death* (封掌生死),
And open the *path of ease and convenience* (方便之门);
May they *grasp the balance of yin and yang* (把握阴阳),
And ascend to the *Age of the Sovereign’s Supreme Dao* (皇极之世).

I humbly pray that they may *temporarily dwell in the celestial chariot* (暂驻风云之驭),
And *descend to partake in the offerings of the Daoist community* (俯歆苹藻之羞),
To *bestow blessings upon the solemn rites* (阴佑斋功),
And to *fulfill the harmonious aspirations* (克谐愿望).
May they *extend their praise again* (再伸偈颂),
And *touch the hearts of the mighty and numinous* (感格威灵).

The *emperors and kings* (帝王) study ancient traditions and emulate the *Heavenly Craft* (代天工),
Different teachings converge in the *Great Central Dao* (建大中).

The *sovereign’s loyal ministers* (元首股肱) serve with unwavering devotion,
And the *spirits and Daoist saints* (鬼神贤圣) are revered in equal measure.

In mortal rites, they honor the *ancestors and sages* (祀典思遗列),
While in the celestial ranks, they *respond to the swift and mighty* (仙班答骏功).
With incense and fire offerings, they strictly adhere to the *broad Daoist precepts* (溥告),
And pray to *align the celestial chariot with their sincere intentions* (愿驱云驭格精衷).

**Second Degree: Inviting the Departed Souls**
The *wandering soul* (游魂) is restless, and the *Great Night* (大夜) never brightens.
They must *lean upon the Nine-Colored Golden Light* (必倾九色之金光),
And *use the Iron Locks of Darkness* (用掣重阴之铁锁).

The *Great Dao is without obstruction* (大方无碍),
And the *myriad laws are illuminated* (万法昭融).
The *Celestially Revered* (举天尊) proclaims:

There is a *formless substance* (有物混成),
From which the *Sovereign* (皇) gives birth to *Heaven and Earth* (生天地).
The *round and clear* (圆清) and the *square and turbid* (方浊)
Within it give rise to humanity.
This is called the *Three Talents* (三才),
Each possessing its *Daoist nature* (道性).

*Heaven endures, Earth lasts* (天长地久),
Without beginning or end,
They *propel the flow of yin and yang* (推荡阴阳),
And *divide the cycles of darkness and light* (裁割昏晓).
The *uninterrupted breath of qi* (一气不息)
Gives birth to all forms (万形以生),
Distinctly manifesting as *divinity* (卓然有神),
Known as the *Creative Transformation* (造化).

Humans dwell within it,
Above, aligned with the *Two Principles* (两仪) of Heaven and Earth,
Though noble and humble differ,
The *virtuous and the foolish* (贤愚) are distinguished.

What they receive from this source,
Is the *same initial essence* (一初).
They *embrace yin and hold yang* (负阴抱阳),
With *round heads and square feet* (圆首方趾).

From infancy, they *preserve their pure spirit* (精守神全),
Their *Heavenly Truth* (天真) untainted,
Their *mixed and primordial state* (混沌) unbroken,
They do not covet wealth and nobility,
Nor do they scorn poverty and lowliness,
Though they possess *sentience and knowledge* (含识知),
Their essence remains *pure and untainted* (纯粹精白).
This is the *True and Authentic Nature* (真实性),
Without *deceit or falsehood* (无邪伪心),
And to be born as a human is what is most precious.

As they grow older,
Their bodies interact with the world,
Gradually losing their *Heavenly Truth* (天真),
And being *corrupted by human desires* (熏煎人欲).
The *innocence of childhood* (赤子之性) diminishes day by day, month by month,
Endless beings arise,
Endless streams of existence flow,
Yet they only *pursue worldly attachments* (务逐物),
And do not *know the love of origin* (爱缘).

How few recognize that this body,
Above, is aligned with *Heaven and Earth* (配天地),
That it *originates from the womb* (始从胎育),
And *descends from the Nine Heavens* (降气九天).
When the *ten months are complete* (十月既圆),
All *ten thousand spirits* (万神) guard it.
Once the form is born,
The *seven orifices* (七窍) open,
The *nine palaces* (九宫) are arranged upon the head,
Where the *Nine True Spirits* (九真) reside,
The *five viscera* (五藏) are divided within,
Each with its own *spirit* (神).

The *Three Souls* (三魂) dwell in the liver,
Desiring that humans act virtuously.
The *Seven Spirits* (七魄) reside in the lungs,
Desiring that humans act wickedly.
The *Twenty-Four True Spirits* (二十四真),
Are divided among the *three departments* (三部):
The *Purple Gates and Jade Pavilions* (紫户玉阁),
The *Crimson Palaces and Vermilion Fields* (绛宫丹田),
And within, the *True Person* (真人),
Known as the *Innocent Child* (赤子),
Where *ten thousand Heavenly Spirits* (天地神气) and *thirty-six thousand* (三万六千)
Converge—every *joint and subtle mechanism* (关节机微)
Is under their control.

How noble is the human body!
Most noble is the *One True Spirit* (一真),
The *original essence* (初生),
Pure and untainted,
And humans, in their worldly existence,
Each know how to *preserve their own* (自存).

The *divine spirits within the body* (周身中神) rejoice and surge.
The *stars upon the crown* (顶戴之星)
Shine brightly and radiate.

The **refined essence** (精炼),
Can attain the **Daoist Sage** (神仙).

The **true and genuine compassion and benevolence** (真正慈仁),
Also allow one to **long endure** (久视).

If one **contrary to this** (反此),
No **evil fate** (恶缘) will fail to befall them.

The **Heavenly Spirits and vital qi** (神气) daily **degenerate** (日衮),
The **stellar lights** (星光) grow dim each day.
The **original nature of the One True Spirit** (一真之性),
Even unto death remains **unrecognized** (不知).

They **betray the Great Dao** (上辜大道),
The **fate of transformation** (混成之缘),
And **fail the dual principles** (下负两仪),
The **path of equilibrium** (受中之道).

In **endless darkness** (冥冥),
They journey ever onward,
And **consort with ghosts** (与鬼为徒).
The **ten thousand spirits** (万神) mourn in sorrow,
Each **abandoning their mortal form** (各去其体).

Some **sink into eternal night** (沦幽夜),
Others **fall under the jurisdiction of ghosts** (属鬼官).
To **seek rebirth beyond** (超生),
Is **utterly without hope** (渺无涯涘).

Only **my Supreme Lord** (太上),
Through **countless kalpas** (历劫) **proclaims compassion** (宣慈),
In the **stream of life and death** (生死流),
**Clears the path** (辟津梁路).

The **divine banner** (神旛) **opens the Dao** (启道),
The **Golden Edict** (黄诏) **summons the spirits** (招魂),
The **fragrant waters** (香水) **purify defilements** (荡瑕),
The **Law Bridge** (法桥) **rescues the drowning** (拯溺),
The **sacred talisman** (灵符) **revives the dead** (起死),
The **wondrous precepts** (妙戒) **return one to the True** (归真),
The **cloud-inscribed charms** (云篆) **translocate the spirits** (迁神),
The **Law Lamp** (法灯) **dispels darkness** (破暗),
**Illuminating the Dao’s mysteries** (昭垂道妙),
And **restoring the True Nature** (还复性真).

Thus, **all beings** (诸众生),
From **post-mortem annihilation** (死灭后),
In the **various realms of suffering** (苦趣),
May **arouse the mind of repentance** (发回向心),
And **acknowledge the Heavenly True Self** (认处天真),
**Repenting evil deeds** (忏悔恶业),
**Riding the Six Powers** (乘六通惠),
To **escape the myriad ghosts** (出万鬼群),
And **behold the Heavenly Sovereign** (得睹天尊),
**Proclaiming the Supreme Dao** (说无上道),
**Refining the form in the Fire Palace** (炼形火府),
And **crossing to the Southern Celestial Realm** (度品南宫).

Each **follows their own inherent nature** (随本人),
With **roots and capacities deep or shallow** (根品深浅),
If **sudden enlightenment** (顿悟) is achieved,
They **transcend the human and celestial realms** (超人天).
Through **gradual cultivation** (渐进修),
They **reclaim their original nature** (复生正性).

As **previously expounded** (上所说),
**Fully recorded in the True Scriptures** (具载真经).

**Perilous is the single mind** (危哉一心),
Bound in the **wheel of life and death** (生死轮转).
Yet **my Supreme Lord** (太上),
**Vows unceasingly** (弘誓不忘),
That **all beings may awaken to the Dao** (皆得悟道).

Now, **a certain family** (某家),
Through **incense and refined offerings** (熏修妙供),
**Awakens the living** (启迪生方),
And **respectfully invokes the distant** (谨即长途),
To **extend their summoning** (以伸告召).

May the **departed** (亡者)
**Each recognize their Heavenly True Self** (各识天真),
With **their original spiritual essence** (以本性灵),
**Uniting all their vital spirits and qi** (合诸魂气).

**Loudly calling forth** (大声疾呼),
Their **names and lineages unconfused** (名姓不迷).
**Widely opening the paths of salvation** (广进康衢),
No **mountains or rivers shall obstruct** (山川不隔).
A **single thought spans a thousand miles** (一念千里),
With **a finger-snap across three lifetimes** (弹指三生).
**Arriving at the Dao’s threshold** (即到道前),
**No hindrance remains** (了无壅滞).

Again, **raising the Daoist hymn** (再伸仙偈),
To **invoke and guide the departed spirits** (招引亡魂).

---
*The Dao penetrates Heaven and Earth, unique among humanity’s paths*,
*A single gathering of Heavenly True Self yields a body of ten thousand treasures*.
*Chasing after worldly things brings one to sink in the sea of life and death*,
*Observing the body—who then becomes a Sage or Holy One?*
*The essence of gold, even refined a hundred times, still retains its nature*,
*Flame repeatedly kindled returns to its original True Self*.
**Hoisting the divine banner dispels all obstructions**,
**Summoning all spirits to emerge from the misty crossing**.

---
**Third Degree: The Night of Deep Obscurity** (沉阴戒夜),
Even **ghostly officials may be called forth** (鬼正可呼).
**Spirits lost in confusion** (滞爽迷方),
The **Dao always brings salvation** (道常善救).

**Invitation to the Mind:**
**Raise the Holy Name** (举圣号).

**The Origin of the Supreme Polarity**,
the Two Principles are thus divided.
The light and clear become Heaven, the Three Celestial Luminaries arrayed in order,
the heavy and turbid become Earth, myriad beings springing forth in clusters.
Between the Six Extremes, there is inner and outer,
in the movement of **One Qi** (One Breath), there is upright and perverse.
Within, there is harmony and balance—**virtue/power** (德) is the nature of humanity.
The accumulation of **One Qi** (One Breath) in moderation gives rise to Sages and Holy Ones.
Dwelling in the common crowd, they merge as ordinary folk.
Gathering in rebellion and inversion, they become ghosts and demons.
The remainder, mixed and confused, descend to beasts.
The world is thus created, and all beings are distinguished by their kind.

In the age of **grass and dimness** (primordial chaos), when life was unstable,
the ancient Sages arose and established these teachings.
Nobility and humility, honor and lowliness,
the refined and the uncivilized, human and beast—
each found its proper place,
so none would be overturned and inverted.

Where the **Kunlun Mountains** stand,
below lies **China** (the Central Realm),
and the Sages transmitted the **Dao/Way**,
steadfastly upholding its center.
With **virtue/power** (德) and righteousness established,
loyalty and filial piety emerging together,
through sincerity and reverence,
through propriety and law,
they ordained many ways to prevent even a single stray thought.

A thought aligned with uprightness,
not crossing into the improper—
this is to be Heaven, to be humanity,
to be divine, to be a Sage.

But if one turns to rebellion and inversion,
to ferocity and cruelty, to violence and retribution,
willing to join the demonic ranks and battle the heavens—
within the **Dao/Way of humanity** (人道),
to violate the fundamental principles,
is to lose one’s human form and fall into the earthly hells,
where iron cities encircle flames,
and copper pillars are slick with blood.
Endless debts of karmic recompense,
endless cycles of vengeance and suffering,
where specters question their shadows,
and skulls lament their solitude.
In the boundless void, without reliance,
they sigh and groan in endless despair.

**Greed, anger, and delusion** (三毒) fuel the karmic fire,
with no way to escape its burning.
Hungry ghosts wander beside,
receiving punishment for their deeds.
All realms rise and fall—
all originate from humanity.

**Beware, the heart’s smallest inch—**
its strength rivals creation.
A single awakening suffices to dispel all accumulation,
and the **Primordial Dao/Way** (先天) will not be obstructed.
A single delusion, once lost, cannot be retrieved—
even all the Buddhas cannot save.

Within the heart’s measure,
the Six Realms cycle endlessly.
Through the Three Realms,
one traverses countless kalpas.

The **karmic fire** blazes fiercely,
consuming the **Great Thousand Worlds** (大千).
Like fleeting water, it vanishes into the boundless,
and one drifts through the Eight Extremes.

At this juncture,
in frantic flight and haste,
they cry out in sorrow—
who then can rescue them?

Only our **Great Compassionate and Merciful Father, the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven** (元始天尊),
emits boundless radiance,
illuminating all without exclusion.
In the **sea of karmic forces** (业力海),
He steers the **compassionate vessel** (慈航).
In the **city of tormenting flames** (虐焰城),
He pours the **lawful rain** (法雨).
With **jade-like mercy** (玉颜恻隐),
His **golden hands** (金手) lift and guide.

Through His **Great Spiritual Penetration** (大神通),
He awakens their true nature.
In the blink of an eye,
they escape the wheel of suffering.
In the span of a closed breath,
each recognizes their past destinies.

While living beings remain undelivered,
His compassionate vow endures.
For all future beings,
He grants universal liberation.

Now, this humble household,
relying on His sacred oath,
proclaims the **auspicious cause** (良因),
for kin and kindred alike,
all may be elevated and saved.

From the **realm of desire** (色欲界) to the **abyssal depths** (洞渊泉),
from **China’s domain** (中华区) to lands without measure,
for **heavenly beings, humans, ghosts, and those in hell** (天人鬼狱),
of varied realms and ranks—
we turn the **Great Vehicle’s chariot** (大乘辕),
and all ascend together.

We humbly vow:
May each, through the **law’s power** (法力),
arrive at the **Dao/Way’s threshold** (道前),
and behold the **Heavenly Sovereign** (天尊),
receiving equal deliverance.

A single resonant void,
cleansing the sincerity of those entangled in filth;
all sentient beings,
entering the **suspended pearl’s aperture** (悬珠之窍).

Again, we recite the **verses of the Dao** (偈颂),
to gather wandering souls.

From the **uppermost darkness** (昙誓) to the **abyssal depths** (渊泉),
the Six Extremes are traversed, the **Great Thousand Worlds** (大千) all reached.
The enlightened dwell beyond form and vessel,
while the deluded cannot escape the bonds of life and death.
The **karmic wheel** ceases to turn with grasping,
who then knows the **transformation of the Dao’s essence** (体悟迁)?

The **void’s treasure-pearl aperture** (空际宝珠通窍道),
the **darkened heart** (冥心) pleads to the **Primordial Sovereign** (元始) for mercy.

Baptized in the **rites of deliverance** (度魂仪),
we humbly confess:
In the **yellow underworld’s abyss** (黄泉溟漠),
the **turbulent and impure qi** (凝浊滞染) clings to the spirit;
in the **black soil’s obscurity** (黑壤幽阴),
the **accumulated filth** (积秽) sinks deep into the **vital essence** (灵爽).
Through the endless night of darkness,
ascension is difficult to achieve.

Thus, the **Supreme Most High** (太上) in compassion,
the **Primordial Emperor** (元皇) in sorrow,
descends with the **law of cleansing toil** (洗涤尘劳之法),
and proclaims the **rites of baptism and purification** (沐浴炼度之仪).
Even if the **karmic net** is severed,
and the **roots of sin** (罪根) are absolved—
today, we solemnly prepare the **treasure-chamber** (宝室),
and purify the **fragrant bath** (兰汤).
We establish the **five-scented ablution rites** (五香澡盥之仪),
and follow the **three registers of exorcism** (三箓拯拔之格).

We invite the **departed souls** (亡过某等),
to attend the chamber and be cleansed,
to dispel the turbid and flow the pure,
and after the rites, to return to their place and listen to the **law**.

We humbly confess:
The **paths of the underworld** (泉路) are deep and dark,
the **cold halls** (寒庭) accumulate filth,
so the **spirit** (神魂) grows obscured,
and the **vital essence** (灵爽) is clouded by ignorance.
Without the **merit of recommendation** (资荐之功),
ascension is impossible to hope for.

We, the assembly of the **law**, (请法众等),
offer this for the **departed souls** (亡灵),
to aid their passage into the **immortal realm** (往生仙界).

We recite the **Bath of Purification Incantation** (沐浴荡秽咒):
*The skies are clear, the qi refined, five colors radiant and bright.*
*The sun and moon emit their splendor,*
*to wash and purify the body’s form.*
*The divine ford is dissolved,*
*fragrant waters flow with clarity.*
*The light shines forth in brilliance,*
*illuminating the Uppermost Purity.*
*The qi does not receive impurity,*
*the Five Palaces accept the essence.*
*Guilt vanishes from the Three Abysses,*
*calamity fades from the Nine Underworlds.*
*The roots of evil are severed,*
*blessings naturally arise.*
*Today’s great vow,*
*all is now declared.*
*The body receives liberation,*
*ascending to the Imperial Court.*

We humbly confess:
For the **spirit to fly into the Dao’s realm** (神飞仙境),
it must rely on the **merit of purification** (炼度之功);
for the **vital essence to depart from obscurity** (魄离幽阴),
it may attain the **fruit of ascension** (升真之果).
To sever earthly filth,
and swiftly gain passage—
to gather harmonious **qi** (气) in the **body-field** (身田),
and to resolve past grievances in the **karmic net** (业网).

We, the assembly of the **law**, (请法众等),
offer this for the **departed souls** (亡灵),
to aid their passage into the **immortal realm** (往生仙界).

We recite the **Bath of Purification Incantation for the Dao’s True Nature** (沐浴炼真咒):
*The Supreme Most High and True, the essence of the Nine Spirits.*
*May the spirit fly into the Dao,*
*and ascend to the Purple Court.*
*Baptized in the Pool of Splendor,*
*the body and spirit become clear.*
*The essence penetrates the Great Emptiness,*
*and ten thousand breaths arise anew.*

We humbly confess:
The **yellow register** (黄箓) descends with its teachings,
the **Purple Court** (紫清) establishes its doctrine,
to save the living and deliver the dead—
all enter the **law’s gate** (法门).
*We open the divine court of flowing fire,*
*to purify and remove obscurity;*
*We stir the lawful waters of radiant clarity,*
*to wash away the toil of the earthly.*
*One may ascend to the land of purity,*
*and behold the Sages of the Void.*

We, the assembly of the **law**, (请法众等),
offer this for the **departed souls** (亡灵),
to aid their passage into the **immortal realm** (往生仙界).

We recite the **Dan Yang Incantation for the Purification of Departed Souls** (丹阳炼度亡魂咒):

The Dragon Han flows boundless, formless, nameless.
Through countless eons, the Imperial Dao shines bright.
Divine clarity radiates—nine souls exhale their essence.
Jade Emptiness glows pure, the Great Vermilion ascends sublime.

The Primordial Origin opens cultivation;
All celestial hosts gather in attendance.
The Three Primordials nourish the Way,
The Two Symbols govern life’s transformation.
The unenlightened are enlightened,
The unformed are perfected.
The dead are transformed, the withered bloom anew.
All sentient souls—stirring, breathing—
Conceived in wombs, all receive rebirth.
This auspicious day, all attain radiance.
The Five Emperors gaze upon them,
Proclaiming to ten thousand souls.

Heaven and Earth’s deities,
And the rivers’ sources,
The Five Peaks and Four Seas,
And all named mountains,
The Cavernous Primordial, Cavernous Void,
Cavernous Emptiness, Cavernous Immortal,
The Boundless Great Sage, the Most True and Noble Deity,
The Boundless and Limitless—all compassionately oversee and deliver life.

When the earthly roots are severed,
The Primordial Register records their names.
All the True Ones respond,
All obey.

For the stagnant souls trapped in the springs,
By the law’s power, they ascend;
The suffering souls in the bitter sea,
Hear the immortal’s voice and attain liberation.
Swiftly depart the turbid waves,
Directly ascend the Pure Capital,
Transformed among mortals,
Forever dwelling in blessings and longevity.

We, the assembly of the law,
Offer this for the departed souls,
To aid their passage into the immortal realm.

We recite the **Bathing at the Eastern Well Incantation**:
The Heavenly River washes the Eastern Well,
Where the Stone Mirror’s water spirit resides.
Round light sweeps the luminous soul,
Dark radiance gleams high and clear.
The Primordial Origin sustains the heavy night,
Heavenly beings follow the moon’s birth.
Bathing in the Orchid Pool above,
A dragon bears the Long Star’s vessel.
The Golden Boy scatters fragrant waters,
The Jade Maiden flows the Five Stars.
Crowns and sashes are cleansed in jade dew,
Five immortals are refined in form.
Fragrance descends upon all gods,
Ascending the luminous heights on their shadows.

For the compassionate heart saves beings,
The scriptures deliver people,
Opening the path for all to return.
First, they are cleansed in purity,
Then their souls attain boundless freedom.

We, the assembly of the law,
Offer this for the departed souls,
To aid their passage into the immortal realm.

We recite the **Pure Water Soul-Delivery Incantation**:
Majestic is the Dao’s noble virtue,
Its merits already complete.
Descending to guide and lead,
The teacher and protector come together.
The compassionate, wondrous law-water
Washes away folly and delusion.
Forever crossing to the Three Pure’s shores,
Long farewell to the Five Turbidities’ mire.

For stirring the turbid and uplifting the pure,
Their ranks are already perfected;
Ascending the True and escaping calamity,
Their aid extends to both the living and the dead.
Now the bathing is complete,
Foulness has been dispelled,
The spirit and mind are pure,
Suffering and torment are removed.

We respectfully invite the departed,
Now adorned in new crowns and sashes,
To come before the Dao and pay homage to the compassionate sage,
To receive the seals and precepts.

We, the assembly of the law,
Offer this for the departed souls,
To aid their passage into the immortal realm.

We recite the **Incantation for Donning Robes and Sashes**:
The Five Turbidities are cleansed,
The Eight Sceneries are bright.
Today they undergo refinement,
Guilt is destroyed, blessings arise.
Forever equal to the Five Emperors,
They join the ranks of the Highest Spirits.
Form and spirit are both wondrous,
Ascending to be reborn in the Southern Court.

Now the bathing is complete,
Their purity is perfected,
Their rainbow robes flutter fragrant,
Their cloud-steps depart the chamber.
Respectfully facing the Three Pure’s throne,
They proclaim the Nine Keys’ true teachings,
Receive the seals and precepts,
Transcend the mundane to attain sainthood,
And surely achieve the wondrous fruit,
Swiftly realizing the immortal realm.

The spirit and soul abide,
Bowing to the summons.

**The Sweet Dew Law-Food Rite is invoked.**
The master sits and recites the **Primordial Lord’s Invocation for Invitation**:
The Primordial Lord issues the teachings,
Highest among all the Ways.
Through countless eons, He delivers beings,
Propagating the Heavy Darkness’ meaning.
To broaden the ferry’s path,
One must first perform the invocation ritual.
Hoping to observe the Great Construction’s wisdom,
To serve as the dependent refuge for the departed souls.
Where heavenly light illuminates,
The sweet dew is imbued with spirit.
Each must firmly grasp the sincere sincerity,
Ascending to the Void’s saints.

We recite the **Jade Purity’s Wise Command Invocation**:
With bowed head, we honor the Dark-Wisdom Void-Worthy,
With bowed head, we return to the Heavy Darkness Master.
The Heavenly Earth’s virtue is beyond measure,
All beings rely on You as their refuge.
With compassion, You turn the Five Paths’ wheel of souls,
With pity, You rescue the Three Realms’ hellish sufferings.
We return to the Golden Gate’s Heavenly Worthy,
We return to the Six Perfections’ compassionate father.
We return to the Supreme Jade Purity,
Forever free from birth and death’s endless cycle.
Exiting to enter the Void—no dependence remains,
Able to transform decay into immortality.
Encounters in countless eons are rare,
For all beings, You expound on karma’s causes and conditions.
Reviving the corpse, eternal life is raised,
Ensuring form and spirit suffer no change.

When gathered, they are life—
The four limbs rely on nourishment and drink;
When dispersed, they are qi—
A single soul needs no food to sustain it.
Knowing the truth of death,
The form becomes empty space;
Understanding life’s essence,
The qi encompasses ten thousand forms.
If the spiritual nature remains unenlightened,
Then karmic consciousness brings delusion—
Where does the soul’s qi not wander?
It binds itself to the decaying body,
Transforming with all things,
Ever more entangled.
When thoughts arise, calamities follow.
Bearing karmic obstacles,
The wind of karma blows harshly,
Enduring bitter suffering;
Craving food and drink,
The fire of hunger burns fiercely,
Never sated.

Such inversion makes transcendence difficult.
Thus, the Most High, in compassion,
The Primordial Lord, in pity,
Reveals the Dao’s wonders through fragrant offerings,
And washes away folly with law-water’s coolness.
They scatter the darkness of the underworld’s heavy gloom,
And moisten the inner heat of all beings.
The merits are profound, the benefits boundless.

Now, the officiant of this ritual, [Name]’s family,
Offers this for the departed [Name],
Who has departed the dusty world,
Fearing to sink into the dark night.
With sincere devotion, they revere and elevate them.
Purifying the world’s delicacies,
Relying on the Heavenly Lord’s law-bestowal.

You all should now sever the sound of withered hearts,
Taste the richness of the Dao,
Drink the elixir of the Heavenly and Immortal’s mingled essence,
Feast on the Supreme Ultimate’s harmonious qi.

Those who delight in the Southern teachings
Follow accordingly, taking Heaven and Earth as their spring and autumn;

---

They who return their heads to the Dao are born anew,
Standing tall as they see death and life as night and day.

A single word of insight unlocks boundless liberation—
They lean upon the *Ganlu*[1] scripture’s radiance,
To awaken the self-luminous nature of their hearts.

Reciting the *Open Business-Dao and Unlock True Paths*[2] incantation:
Its golden-lighted merits open the dim gates—
Subtle yet vast, dispelling the deepest obscurity.

From the *Hua Chi*[3] flows the scent of truth,
Lotus canopies drift with clouds.
A thousand spirits rejoice in the Primordial Harmony,
Dwelling eternally in the Twelve Palaces.

Swiftly proclaiming the *Lingbao*[4] essence,
They roam at will through the Heavenly Realm.

The *Lingquan*[5] enfolds the Five Phases,[6]
Nourishing all things yet preserving the Dao’s subtlety;
The *Fashui*[7] flows through the Hundred Valleys,[8]
Receiving all impurities yet containing none.

Bearing Heaven’s singular essence as their Sovereign,
They generate the Supreme Benevolence as their Virtue,
Conforming to the conditions to manifest as crooked or straight,
Adapting to the vessel to become square or round.

By reason tracing its origin—
The more exhausted the inquiry, the deeper the mystery;
By the Dao revealing its function—
The more refined the clarity, the more profound the unrest.

Externally, they purge the Six Senses and Ten Evils,[9]
Freeing them from heat and torment, from weariness and suffering;
Externally, they irrigate the Nine Orifices and Hundred Bones,[10]
Achieving the elixir of golden nectar and jade essence.

The Heavenly Lord establishes teachings,
To rescue the lost in the netherworld.
By this praise and offering, they extend boundless support.

For the departed, they recite the *Open Throat and Universal Moistening*[11] incantation of nourishment:

Alas, the endless night of suffering,
Tormented by the Three Paths of heat.
Fierce flames enter the throat—
The longing for eternal life, for quenchless thirst.

A single sprinkle of *Ganlu* nectar,
Cools the burning as the cold of clarity.

The spirit-soul ascends to the Great Luo,[12]
Moistening all things.

The scent of scentless fragrance is priceless—
Burn it, and it returns sevenfold in misty abundance;
The Dao permeates Nature—
Invoke it, and nine luminous rays radiate in splendor.

Thus, the Dao is learned through the heart,
Yet the heart relies on fragrance to transmit it.
Such is its use—
Neither fire nor smoke;
Such is its observation—
Neither millet nor barley.

Within it, no delusion remains,
Its fragrance drifts far.

Ascending to the Three Realms and Ten Heavens,[13]
Descending through the Nine Abysses and Five Paths,[14]
Revealing its profound mysteries,
They offer the departed soul,
Burning it toward the furnace,
Extending boundless support.

They present the scentless, priceless fragrances of the Heavens:
*Return-Soul Fragrance*,
*Reverse-Wind Fragrance*,
*Inverted-Wind Fragrance*,
*Seven-Colored Fragrance*,
*Heavenly Treasure Fragrance*—
Their scent misty and pervasive,
Radiating through the Ten Directions,
Extending boundless support.

The flowers:
Upon the *Yujing Mountain*[15], naturally arise the Seven Treasures Forest;
Within the *Dahai Courtyard*[16], spread the Eight *Qian*[17] Trees.
Lush and vibrant, their verdure unfolds in emerald splendor.
Feasting on the *Qian* Tree’s leaves,
They become the Jade Immortals—
Their bodies transparent as jade, luminous within;
Consuming the Seven Treasures Forest’s blossoms,
They transform into golden bones—
Their Five Viscera[18] like polished gems, round and clear.

Only the Heavenly Unadulterated remains unstained and unattached,
A single petal—how could it soil a robe?
Thus, in the mortal world, it neither grows nor is sown,
How could its five leaves bear fruit?

Golden flowers, jade petals,
*Huachi*[19] yellow sprouts—
No marvel blooms from a common body,
Yet through refining, it becomes the bone of the Immortal.
Three flowers converge at the crown,
Nine breaths[20] coalesce into form—
By this praise and offering, they extend boundless support.

They present the Heavenly wonders of strange realms’ flowers:
*Nine Spirits Supreme Marvelous True Flowers*,
*Five Spirits Minor Marvelous Strange Flowers*,
*Emerald Petals Golden Glow Flowers*,
*Golden Petals Purple-Gold Radiant Flowers*,
*Languan Gardens Azure Jade Orchid Flowers*,
*Jade Forest Flowing Light Treasure Flowers*—
Their light dazzling, illuminating the Ten Directions,
Extending boundless support.

The waters:
Before chaos was divided,
The Primordial Essence was but a single pitcher of sacred elixir—

The divine marvel is already complete,
Dispersed as nine refined elixirs of pure essence.
How few discern the sages’ wisdom,
To save the world, one must know depth and measure.

If one can taste the taste of flavors,
Only then does one perceive the pure of the pure.
Should one drink three cups,
Necessarily, the Great Dao will be understood.

With reverence, I present this offering,
Wishing its fragrance to be savored,
Gathering as the *yangchun*[21] of a full belly,
Scattering as the sweet dew of the heavens—
Penetrating the Three Realms in speechless, laughterless harmony,
Merging all things in one drunkenness, one awakening,
Striking the *Bai Xue Huang E*[22] on the zither,
Raising the cup to invite the Clear Wind and Bright Moon,
Rejoicing in the celestial realm within the vessel,
Roaming the misty peaks beyond the world,
Emulating *Dao Hongkai* in the pursuit of the Way,
Seeking *Bai Yunzi* in the quest for True Reality—
Divine elixirs of immortal alchemy,
The Great Saint’s Sacred Pill,
Holding this sacred nectar,
Extending boundless support.

I present the Seven Heavenly Sacred Elixirs:
*Solar Essence Elixir*,
*Lunar Luster Elixir*,
*Stellar Radiance Elixir*,
*Sweet Dew Elixir*,
*Golden Fluid Elixir*,
*Spirit Light Elixir*,
*Jade Vault Elixir*—
Drinking them brings endlessness,
Circulating through the Ten Directions,
Extending boundless support.

**Fruits:**
Fruits arise from flowers,
Their cultivation must be nurtured by planting.

The stillness of the heart gives birth to the Dao/Way,
Yet it must rely on the strength of cultivation and planting.
Thus there are the coiled peaches of *Zi Xiang*,
And the fire dates of mingled hues,
Nearly taken from the self, distantly drawn from things.

If the heart-field’s purity is clear and bright,
Then fruits flourish in abundance;
Or if thorns and brambles grow thickly,
Then roots and shoots wither away.

Their color like citrus, yet sweet as honey,
Some ripen after years, others at their appointed time,
Some take three thousand years to form,
Some mature in an instant’s flash—
Chewing them, the spirit feels invigorated,
Savoring them, the mind becomes lucid and clear.

If the fruit arises from its cause,
Then one must discard the flower and focus on the essence.
At this moment, the mind is fully illuminated.
Through this praise, boundless support is extended.

I offer the Seven Heavenly Sacred Fruits of *Qiónglín*:
The *Kōngdòng* spirit-gourd,
The *Wànsuì* immortal peach,
The *Jīnzhǐ* golden dates,
The *Yuánguāng* primal essence fruits,
The *Chìlíng* crimson spirit dates,
The *Fēidān* flying alchemy pomegranates—
Their fragrance thick and pervasive,
Eating them brings endlessness,
Circulating through the Ten Directions,
Extending boundless support.

**Food:**
Heavenly and human sustenance, bland and flavorless,
Recorded in the *Huángtíng* scriptures;
The *Shūmǐ* millet grains,
Refined without remainder, their merit marked in *Língbǎo*.
Thus the highest sages,
Only savor the *Chōnghé* balanced taste;
While those descending to the mortal realm,
Indulge in rich delicacies to repel demons.

The Four Heavenly Fragrant Rice of the celestial kitchen,
Born from the common folk’s grains;
Yet the world’s hundred varieties of rice and millet,
Each kernel earned through toil and suffering.

Those who enjoy blessings without laboring to eat,
Should reflect on their origins;
Those who have abundance yet know contentment,
Must not cast it away lightly.

In this *Fǎhuì* assembly of sacred practice,
I prepare the *Huìxiāo* fine offerings.
Thus I present these fragrant feasts,
To nourish the departed spirits.

Through this praise, boundless support is extended.

I offer the Four Heavenly Fragrant Rices:
*Fēngshān* Abundant Mountain Rice,
*Lóngshān* Dragon Mountain Rice,
*Qīngjīng* Verdant Essence Rice,
*Tàihé* Grand Harmony Rice—
Their fragrance thick and pervasive,
Eating them brings endlessness,
Circulating through the Ten Directions,
Extending boundless support.

The *heart-flower* of wisdom’s fruit,
The *golden rice* and *jade nectar*,
The *Língbǎo* spirit’s fragrant wisdom,
The *pífēn* subtle dharma-flavors—
All rely on things to manifest the Dao/Way,
Yet one should perceive the mind through their form.

Each should offer sincere and expansive devotion,
Turning it into boundless merit.
May all beings on the great earth attain fullness,
No creature left unnourished by its essence.

Further, through fitting praise,
To complete the awakening.

Hearing the *Fǎnwèi* wisdom’s radiance in the *Tàiwú* boundless void,
The *round penetration* of all mysteries;
Refining the true light within the dharma-body,
Savoring the *Chōnghé* balanced taste.

Able to draw sufficiency from all forms,
Initially not dependent on external things.

After the *spirit-food* incantation,
I hope for your departed soul,
To absorb the *Língmáng* luminous essence of the inner landscape,
To steady the central *zhōngzhuàng* true position,
To drink the *Qióngguì* dewdrops of the spirit-tree,
To eat the *Huánghuá* golden petals’ jade-like tenderness,
To grasp the Dao’s profound mysteries,
To congeal the spirit in the boundless expanse,
To rest in the *yuánfáng* primal chamber and lie at ease,
To aid the true transformation in its boundless circulation.

Offered to the departed,
To merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.
Recite the *Yùqīng Dàcí* Great Compassionate Sovereign’s *Gānlù* Nectar Law-Food Incantation:

Turn back and gaze upon the *Yuánluó* round canopy,
Uniting the scene and drawing the luminous essence.
Confining the soul, restraining the seven *pò*,
Focusing the mind, centering the *zhōngzhuàng*.
Moving, dwelling, walking in the boundless void,
Sleeping, resting in the *yuánfáng* primal chamber.
Hunger, feast on the *Huángbì* golden petals;
Thirst, drink the *Qiónggēn* dewdrop nectar.
The spirit-banners command the *tiān mó* heavenly demons,
Uniting the body, refining the true light.
Once more illuminating the *Tàiwú* boundless void,
Endlessly dwelling in the mid-air realm.
Round penetration fades at the *bōjí* wave’s edge,
True transformation knows no final limit.
Profound mysteries without beginning or end,
The practitioner must clearly understand.
Silent and vast, forgetting teachings and precepts,
Responding to the *yùn* cosmic flow, vast and unconstrained.
The Dao’s mirror does not shine by itself,
It must first be polished by what is offered.
Union finds no duality,
Separation follows the heart’s will.

Now mingled in the *mángwèi* murky and luminous,
Transformation not yet riding the single *qì* breath.

To reverse their original knowledge,
Form must arise from the *sān guāng* Three Lights.
Appropriate to sing and chant in the *qīngyáo* clear melodies,
To unfold the path of birth and rebirth.

After the *spirit-food* incantation,
I hope for your departed soul,
To embrace the *yīn* and cradle the *yáng*,
To draw the *rìyuè* sun-moon’s ascending *bēn* vital qi,
To mold the soul and cast the spirit,
To store the *kǎnlí* water-fire’s constructed essence.
The Three Palaces full and replete,
The Ten Aspects complete—
Early ascending to the *tōngdá* realm of boundless passage,
Endlessly roaming the *zhìhuì* gate of wisdom.

Offered to the departed,
To merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.
Recite the *Sānguāng* Three Lights Illuminating the Nectar Law-Food Incantation:

Vast and crystalline, the *yuángì* primal qi is born,
Perfusing the *tàikōng* great void.
The two *yào* luminaries shine together,
The five *wéi* constellations harmonize in turn.
The Three Lights radiant, their brilliance complete,
Sacred qi fills the Three Palaces.
The imperial domain gathers the *jiǔlǎo* Nine Elders,
Feasting on the *bǎitǐ* hundred forms of abundance.
The *Jīnhuá* golden petals illuminate the scene,
Body aligned with the sun and moon.
In thought of the Dao, before the highest sages,
Endless life through ten thousand kalpas.
Heavenly beings nurture the people,
Accumulating the *sānwānliùqiān* thirty-six thousand divine qi;
The world abandons the Great Dao/Way,
Destroying the *yībǎiliùshí* one hundred and eighty spirit-gates.
Self-corruption damages the true roots,
No nourishment blooms in the jade tree.
The spirit does not grant itself,
The shadow wanders with demons.

To reverse the source of life,
One must rely on the *fàn* sacred chant.
After the *spirit-food* incantation,
I hope for your departed soul,
To obtain the *zhònghuà* myriad transformations’ primal essence,
To restore the five *shén* spirits’ true dwelling,
The *Bái Yuán* White Sovereign on the right as guardian,
The *Gōngzǐ* Prince on the left as support,
The crown adorned with the *fēicùi* floating emerald canopy,
The feet encircled by the *jīnlián* golden lotus.
Fragrant clouds enfold the body,
Sweet nectar sprinkles the heart,
The *zhànhuǎng* profound and elusive primal spirit,
Nourishing the *xīyí* subtle true qi.

Offered to the departed,
To merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.
Recite the *Yùqīng Dàbēi* Great Compassion Cloud Palace’s *Yīnshēng* Dark Birth Incantation for the *Fànchàng* Sacred Chant and *Shēnghún* Soul-Bathing:

The cloud-root boundless, the myriad transformations’ essence,
The seven *pò* spirits congealed within,
The three *hún* souls inwardly knotted.
The *èrshí sì zhēn* Twenty-Four True Ones,
Enter and exit without gate.
The profound and elusive essence,
The profound and elusive primal spirit.
Following the *jié* kalpa’s rise and fall,
Born with the *qì* breath.
Internally congealed in the *hùnpò* mixed simplicity,
Externally nurtured by the seven *jīng* channels.
The five *shén* spirits planted in the *huá* petals,
The three *tái* platforms spread with luster.
The *zǐquè* purple gate and pristine *sùtóng* youth,
Returning the soul to its *yuán* origin.
Ascending on clouds to become immortal,
Ranging through mists, floating in the void.
Within lies the *Yùjīng* Jade Capital,
Called the *shén gōng* Divine Palace.
On the right, the *wúyīng* peerless guardian,
On the left, the *Bái Yuán* White Sovereign’s support.

The dark beasts block the rear, the vermilion birds guard the front.
Above, they float beneath the emerald canopy, below, they tread the golden lotus.
Fragrant clouds condense in the void, sweet dew flows endlessly.
Using it, it is never exhausted; seeking it, it is never found.

The Nine Abysses of black darkness, where the Six Bandits are confined in iron prisons;
A single thought of clarity, the Great Void knows no boundary.

To leisurely dwell in the True Realm,
One must savor the Great Harmony.

Further wield the **Treasure Scrolls** (*bǎozhāng*),
To uphold the strict **Dharma flavors** (*fǎwèi*).

After the **spiritual meal** (*zòushí*), I hope for your departed soul (*wánglíng*),

To ride the **Jade Sound’s** (*Yùyīn*) song and call, seated in divine wandering (*shényóu*).

While the **feast and wine** (*yáojiǔ*) remain,
The Eight Extremes are traversed.

Offered for the departed (*wángzhě*),
To ascend and nourish the **Pure Land of the Heavens** (*wǎngshēng tiānjiè*).

Recite the **Nine Abysses Transcendent Sweet Dew Dharma-Meal Spell** (*Jiǔyōu chāoshēng gānlù fǎshí zhòu*):

Forever banishing hunger and thirst.

To receive this **Dharma offering of food** (*fǎshí*),

Relying on the **golden light of ten thousand Dao** (*wàndào jīnguāng*),
Breaking the **Nine Yin paths** (*jiǔyīn quánlù*).

After the **spiritual meal** (*zòushí*), I hope for your departed soul (*wánglíng*),

**Master Lü Taigu of the Crane Forest Daoist School’s *Reading and Guidance* Section**
*Preface to the *Praise of the Guidance Rites* by Master Guangcheng*

The scriptures refer to **"fasting officials"** (*zhāiguān*) within the **ritual assembly**—those who practice the Dao of fasting. Today, this is mistakenly called the **"fasting master."**

Those of highest **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **Dao** are called **Lawmasters** (*Fǎshī*), equivalent to **High Functionaries** (*gāogōng*). Those well-versed in **ritual precepts** (*fǎdù*) serve as **Chief Lecturers** (*dūjiǎng*), responsible for chanting, guiding, and upholding the **rites and regulations**. To ensure the **officers** stand in order and the **ritual formations** stand solemn, the **drum and bell** must first be struck. Only then may the assembly gather, and the **Chief Lecturer** ascend the platform to chant.

If the **Chief Lecturer**’s years of **virtue/power** are slightly greater and they wish to avoid excessive labor, one may be appointed from among the officers to strike the bell and lead the rites. Though this practice arose from necessity, it is not the ancient custom. Now that the bell is established as fixed ritual, it has endured for long.

Ancient rites were simple, but modern rituals have grown elaborate. The **High Functionary** and **Lawmaster** lead the **supplications**, their bows and movements setting the example for the assembly. If they are aged or infirm, they may retire of their own accord—never should they be replaced by another, lest it appear as redundant office.

The **Supervisor of the Fasting** (*Jiānzhāi*) upholds the **ritual statutes** (*kēxiàn*) and corrects transgressions. If any offense occurs, they must first warn with a **penalty register**. Those punished must accept their guilt without grumbling, lest disputes arise during **ritual admonition**, bringing shame upon the assembly.

The **Divine Sage’s Attendant** (*Xuánshèng shìjīng*) oversees the **platform** (*tánchǎng*), arranging the **ritual seating** and ensuring all **offerings** are properly prepared. According to ancient practice, within the **fasting hall**—today’s **platform**—two high seats are placed for **morning, noon, and evening lectures**. Those who have mastered the scriptures below the **Lawmaster** may request to ascend the **Law Seat**.

When the **scripture recitation** begins, once the officers are seated, one performs **purification**, while the **Incense Attendant** tends the incense and the **Scripture Attendant** holds the scripture. After recitation, the scripture must be carefully stored in the **fasting hall**, held in strict **veneration**, lest the tables be left disordered, the platform defiled, or outsiders trespass, lightly profaning the **Divine Worthies**.

The **Incense Attendant’s** duties are detailed in the **ritual register**, yet many today neglect them through laxity. The **Lamp Attendant** must diligently maintain the lamps—extinguishing and relighting them as needed—this alone fulfills their role. Recently, some unqualified individuals have excluded the **Scripture Attendant** from arranging the **platform**, instead establishing a **"Direct Platform"** (*zhítán*) title. Today’s **Direct Platform** is what was once the **Scripture Attendant’s** duty.

Beyond the **six primary roles**, there are many redundant positions. This stems from **Sichuan’s** addition of **external platform rituals** beyond the ancient rites, which the officers did not originally perform. Due to neglect, the **three attendants** were made to also **recite repentance verses** and serve the **external platform**, leaving the **Scripture Attendant, Incense Attendant, and Lamp Attendant** unfulfilled in their own duties. Though divided among them, they must still wear **ritual attire** when performing **ritual duties**. This should be examined to align with proper **rites and regulations**.

According to the **Golden Register’s** ancient rites and the **Yellow Register’s** old laws, on the **night of the vigil** and during **meritorious recitation**, one first performs the **Natural Morning Rites**—that is, **paying homage to the Ten Directions** and offering **three repentances**. Only then does the ritual proceed.

Thus, the **fasting ritual sequence** begins at **hour *xū*** (7–9 PM), when the officers are summoned before the **Mysterious Teacher** (*Xuánshī*). One reads the **office statement**, then casts the **petition** onto the **main platform**, offers incense to the **Ten Directions**, ascends to the **inner altar**, offers incense, pays homage to the **Teacher**, lights the **incense burner**, and bows in **morning reverence**. Next, the **fasting petition** is read, followed by the **Great Thanksgiving** and the **proclamation of precepts**. The **Chief Lecturer**, having received their office, recites the **scriptural prohibitions**, makes a **vow**, relights the burner, and returns to stand before the **Mysterious Teacher** once more.

Hence it is said: *"At dawn’s first light, proceed according to the Dao’s law."* This method, transmitted from **Zhang Daoling**, **Lu Jianji**, **Kou Qingzhi**, and **Zhang Qingdu**, has endured through the ages, always maintaining that the **fasting rites** originate from the **Natural Morning Rites**, lest the source be forgotten.

Recently, some mediocre scholars, failing to grasp the intent of the ancients, have **prematurely appointed the six offices** before the **Mysterious Teacher**, proclaiming the **scriptural prohibitions** before ascending the platform, then claiming that **Lu Jianji’s fasting rites** are erroneous. Their false praise and slander only serve to confuse—how little they know! Even their followers imitate this, not only disrupting the **ritual order** but also slandering the **worthy teachers**. Those who understand the **Dao’s teachings** should reject them.

**Du Guangting of the Eastern Isles** writes: Examining ancient rites, there is no **"incense blessing"** (*zhùxiāng*), **"courtly attendance"** (*tíngcān*), or **"proclamation of supplications."** When **Yang Xue**, the **Master of Letters**, revised the **Golden Register rites**, he included an **"incense blessing"**—this was the **official Daoist assembly’s** fixed order. After offering incense and bowing, a **declared Daoist** would state the **fasting intent**, then retire to stand before the **Mysterious Teacher** to assume their office. Today, during **ritual exorcisms**, the **High Functionary** performs the **incense blessing**.

Ancient rites were not without **spirit invocation**—this was the **vigil night**. Hence, **Master Guangcheng** repeatedly expounds upon it. Therefore, the **appointment of offices** and **proclamation of precepts** must follow the **recitation of petitions**, first informing the **Highest Truths** of the **fasting intent**—this is not the time for **descending blessings** or **offering libations**.

Since **Master Wu Ruo** composed the *Critique of Errors*, he favored his own views, claiming: *"How could one appoint offices and proclaim precepts only after the sacrificial rites conclude?"* **Yang Xue**, following **Wu Ruo’s** mistake, moved the **appointment of offices** and **proclamation of precepts** to before the **ritual invocation**, greatly deviating from the intent of all past **lineage masters**.

Now we have **spirit invocation**, **vigil night rites**, and **initial platform announcements** outside the platform—this is like **building a house beneath a house and a roof above a roof**. Though practiced for long, it is difficult to alter. At least, one might eliminate the **vigil night invocation** and the **three-day morning announcements**, which would be somewhat acceptable.

「With reverence, I adopt the ritual sequences established by **Master Guangcheng**, **Yang Xue the Scholar**, and **Master Sun the Teacher**, cross-referencing them with ancient rites, compiling the *Praise of the Dao*, and adapting past traditions to present needs—all to aid the Dao’s transformation.

For the **Daoist common teachings**, the sixth and seventh volumes of the *Collected Scriptures* must be used.
The **Daoist common teachings** also require the *Crane Forest Collection* of **Lü Taigu the Daoist**, particularly the **"Wēiyí Rites"** (*Wēiyí Yì*) and **"Ordinating the Platform Rites"** (*Qìngtán Yì*), alongside the three concordant editions of **Du the Celestial Master**, **Yang Zigong** (次公), and **Zhang Wujin** (无尽).

In general, when the platform faces due north, the **Grand Invocation** (*Dūjiǎng*) should be performed at the **door of the platform** (*dìhù*), meaning the **platform exterior**—this is the **platform’s outer precinct** (*tánwài*). **Celestial Master Zhang Wanfu**’s preface to the *Ritual Procedures* (*Xùshì Yì*) includes a diagram of the platform, designating the **Grand Invocation** (*Dūjiǎng*) as the **Wēiyí Invocation** (*Wēiyí Jiǎng*), implying that all **Wēiyí rites** within a single platform are led by the **Grand Invocation**. Thus, the **ordination of the platform** should be conducted by the **Grand Invocation** alone.

However, **Yang Zigong** (杨杰次公) states: *"Appoint a Daoist of Wēiyí rank to ordain the platform."* This fails to recognize that the **Grand Invocation** itself is the **Wēiyí**. He further says: *"Place the **Jian Water** (*Jiànshuǐ*) at the **door of the platform** (*dìhù*)."* This overlooks the fact that the **Grand Invocation**’s designated position is already the **door of the platform**. If the platform does not face due north, it should be relocated accordingly.

**White Invocation** (*Bái Shì*) and **spirit contemplation** (*Cúnxiǎng*) are to be performed.

**Celestial Master Du** states: *"The Wēiyí Master, wearing the **mystic cap** (*Xuánguān*) and **crimson robe** (*Zhànghè*), stands at the **door of the platform**, and the **White Invocation** (*Bái Shì*) is performed to present the received **scriptures and ordination credentials** (*Jīngzhuó*) for the **appointment of offices** (*Zhìzhí*)."*

I, **Subject [Name]**, humbly hear that none surpasses the **hundred spirits** (*bǎilíng*) in harmonizing **yin and yang** (*Yùnyáng*); yet none can equal the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*) in **saving the realm and the family** (*Jìjiāguó*) or **communing with the luminous and the dark** (*Yōumíng*).

Thus, the **Jade Hall** (*Bìluò*) undergoes transformations of calamity and fortune, which may be dispelled; the **Yellow Register** (*Huánglù*) contains rites of deliverance, permitting their observance and practice. Your subjects, humbly emulating the **True Transformation** (*Zhēnhuà*), though unworthy, hold official rank. In all places traversed, how dare we forget to repay with devotion?

Now, we petition to construct a certain **ritual hall** (*zhāi*) at [location], for a span of [number] days and nights, performing **Dao rituals** (*xíngdào*) and **scripture-turning** (*zhuǎnjīng*), in accordance with the prescribed rites. Your subjects, refining our **form and qi** (*xíngqì*), purifying our **spirit and vitality** (*jīngshén*), shall diligently execute this, daring not to fail in reporting upward.

We humbly await the **Most High’s** (*Tàishàng*) proclamation of new decrees, the boundless grace of **covering and nurturing** (*fùyù*), commanding the **True Officials** (*Zhēnguān*) to oversee and descend in judgment. May the mists and clouds briefly cease at the **Three Canopies** (*Sānjǐng*), and winds and rains not assail the **Four Seas** (*Sìméng*). Our **confessions** (*chuànxiè*) shall surely be heard, and our petitions transmitted without obstruction. Your subjects, overwhelmed by such boundless grace, focus our thoughts on the **True One** (*Zhēn*), awaiting the response.

As **Master Yang** originally stated: Before the **White Invocation** (*Bái Shì*), first contemplate the **Three Masters** (*Sānshī*) in the west—then the **Three True Lords of Tang, Ge, and Zhou** (*Táng-Gě-Zhōu Sān Zhēnjūn*) before you. **Lord Tang** (*Tángjūn*), of **Júyáng**, with **celestial-crown** (*Tiānguān*) and **red scripture-register** (*Zhàngzhāng dān yī*), wields the **Dragon-Headed Treasure Sword** (*Lóngtóu Bǎojiàn*), his left hand holding a **talisman**. **Lord Ge** (*Gējūn*), clad in ritual attire, holds a **jade spear**. **Lord Zhou** (*Zhōujūn*), in his **crown and robes**, wields the **Jade Yang Node**. Next, contemplate the **True Official** (*Zhēnguān*) in **crimson robes**, riding the **Nine-Phoenix Chariot** (*Jiǔfèng Chéng*) and the **Big Dipper**, descending to purify the defilements at the altar. Then, contemplate the **Seven Stars** covering your head with their handles pointing forward, lest they obstruct your vision.

Only then proceed with the **White Invocation**—though it is better to first contemplate the **Four Spirits** (*Sìlíng*) at your left, right, front, and rear, with the **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars** (*Rìyuè Wǔxīng*) above your head. This is from **Du Yi’s** method.

Upon completing contemplation, pass the **tablet** (*jiǎn*) to the attendant. Next, **clasp the fist** (*wògù*), hands hanging naturally, and summon the **Four Spirits**.

**Clasping the fist**: With the **thumb pressing the middle finger’s middle joint**, the other four fingers drawn into the palm.

**Eastern Azure Dragon** (*Dōngfāng Qīnglóng*), essence of the **Horn and Kneecap** (*Jiǎo-Kàng*), exhales **clouds and suppressed qi**, roars with **thunderous voice**. Soaring through the **Eight Extremes** (*Bājí*), circling the **Four Seas**, come stand at my left.

**Western White Tiger** (*Xīfāng Báihǔ*), corresponding to **Zīshēn**, its **pure essence** and **solemn tones** awe birds and beasts, its howls stirring mountains and forests—come stand at my right.

**Southern Vermilion Bird** (*Nánfāng Zhūquè*), leader of all birds, born from the **Crimson Cavern**, its **azure sky echoes** resounding with **five-colored splendor** and **six symbolic forms**—come guide me before.

**Northern Dark Tortoise** (*Běifāng Xuánwǔ*), born of **Great Yin**, its **void and perilous essence**, **turtle and serpent** merged—circling the **Nine Terrains**, commanding all spirits—come follow me behind.

Next, **both hands pressed to the heart**, feet stepping into the **Ding-character stance**. Having summoned the Four Spirits, they shall now **circle like a belt**, the **Sun clasped by the Moon** in motion.

The **Sixteen Divine Generals of the Nine Regions** (*Jiǔzhōu Shíliù Shénjiāng*) serve as my emissaries. Under the **Great Unity Star Lord** (*Tàiyī Xīngjūn*), there are sixteen divine generals who know the **calamities and blessings of the world**. Some, unacquainted with this, mistakenly alter it to **sixty divine generals**. The **Heaven, Earth, and Water Officials** (*Tiāndì Shuǐguān*) share their auspiciousness.

The characters **Heaven, Earth, Water** (*Tiān-Dì-Shuǐ*) are stepped as **Ding, Gāng, and Sān Cái** (*Sāncái bù*), at the **sword-water** (*jiànshuǐ*), invoking **Yang Yi’s** method. The old rites speak of **Heaven, Earth, and Water Officials**, but **Yang’s** version is superior.

Next, the **right hand grasps the sword**. The **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*)—**Fire, Wood, Water, Earth, Metal**—are in motion. My **rigid sword** commands and restrains **ghosts and spirits**. The **Twenty-Eight Constellations** (*Èrshíbāxiù*) array before my will. The **Seven Stars of the Big Dipper** (*Běidǒu Qīxīng*) flank and assist the **Numinous True One**. Circling the ten thousand directions, all blessings converge.

Next, the **left hand holds the water vessel** (*shuǐkuàng*). The **Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Sea rivers** are not **Divine Water** (*Shénshuǐ*); **Divine Water** refers to **cauldron-water** (*zhuóshuǐ*), while those rivers are **mundane**. Some mistakenly alter this to **mundane water**, an error in their sight.

The **Five Dragons** exhale to purify **Heaven and Earth**. The **Great Emperor** (*Dàdì*) has worn it for ten thousand years; today, I shall cleanse the **demonic qi**.

Facing the **sword and water**, chant the incantation:
*"With reverence, I summon the **Eastern Azure Dragon** (*Dōngfāng Qīnglóng*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water. The **Southern Vermilion Dragon** (*Nánfāng Zhīlóng*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water. The **Western White Dragon** (*Xīfāng Báihǔ*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water. The **Northern Black Dragon** (*Běifāng Hēilóng*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water. The **Central Yellow Dragon** (*Zhōngyāng Huánglóng*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water.*

*My water is no ordinary water—it is the **Five Dragons’ and Five Stars’ True Qi Water**. My sword is no ordinary blade—**nine-fold refined**, its rigidity unyielding, the **Seven Stars** flanking it, **treading the Big Dipper**, **straddling the Arc of the General** (*Kuaì Gāng*). The **Great Unity** (*Tàiyī*) forms the **water character**; the **crossbar** (*gāng*) is also written as **‘action’** (*zuò*). **Yang’s** version uses **‘in’** (*zài*), which is superior.*

*Circling the ten thousand directions—three versions omit the lines ‘spraying water upon Heaven’ and ‘sprinkling water upon Earth.’ Water cleanses beyond measure; filth cannot surpass impurity. With purity, impurity is dispelled; with water, defilement is governed. There are no lines about ‘hurrying to depart ten thousand li’ or ‘not stopping.’*

*Urgent, as the **Law decrees** (*Lǜlìng*), commanding restraint.*

*Facing the **Break** (*Pò*)—as in **Yang’s** version—when the **Dipper’s Handle** (*Dǒugǎng*) points straight, its direction is **Break**. Though the altar’s orientation may be inconvenient, mental contemplation suffices.*

Next, proceed to the **southwest**, reciting the **Purification of Heaven and Earth Cauldron** (*Jìng Tiāndì Zhòu*):

*Urgent, as the command decrees.*
*—Dù Běn*—: Descending to the altar below, I proceed from the **northeast corner** to establish the boundary, reaching the **southeast** to deploy spirit and qi, and so on.
*—Zhāng Běn*— follows *Yáng Běn*, except for the **southeast corner**, where it adds:
*"All impurities, motionless and inactive."*

Next, chant the incantation, stepping the **Ding Step** to the **southeast**, facing south and spitting water.
Respectfully summon the **Southern Red Boy Lord** and his officials and soldiers,
Riding the **true qi of the Southern *Yīng Huò* Star**, descending from the void to the altar site, deploying spirit and qi, searching out malevolent essences, **burning ghosts and demons**—**no mercy for the guilty**.
I proceed from the **southeast corner** to establish the boundary, reaching the **southwest**.
*Urgent, as the command decrees.*

Next, chant the incantation, stepping the **Ding Step** to the **southwest**, facing west and spitting water.
Respectfully summon the **Western White Boy Lord** and his officials and soldiers,
Riding the **true qi of the Western *Tài Bái* Star**, descending from the void to the altar site, deploying spirit and qi, searching out malevolent essences, **slaying and beheading ghosts and demons**—**no mercy for the guilty**.
I proceed from the **southwest corner** to establish the boundary, reaching the **northwest**.
*Urgent, as the command decrees.*

Next, chant the incantation, stepping the **Ding Step** to the **northwest corner**, facing north and spitting water.
Respectfully summon the **Northern Black Boy Lord** and his officials and soldiers,
Riding the **true qi of the Northern *Chén* Star**, descending from the void to the altar site, deploying spirit and qi, searching out malevolent essences, **drifting away ghosts and demons**—**no mercy for the guilty**.
I proceed from the **northwest corner** to establish the boundary, reaching the **northeast**.
*Urgent, as the command decrees.*

Next, chant the incantation, stepping the **Ding Step** to the center of the altar, facing the **northwest** and spitting water.
Respectfully summon the **Central Yellow Boy Lord** and his officials and soldiers,
Riding the **true qi of the Central *Zhèn* Star**, descending from the void to the altar site, deploying spirit and qi, searching out malevolent essences, **burying and concealing ghosts and demons**—**no mercy for the guilty**.
I proceed from the **upper boundary** to establish the boundary, reaching the altar site.
*Urgent, as the command decrees.*

Next, stand at the earthly door and ascend the Seven Stars of the Dipper, facing the *jiàn* (建) and *pò* (破) directions—
that is, in the first month when *jiàn* is in the *yín* (寅) direction, turn your back to *yín* and step upon the first star.
Turn your body to enter the Dipper’s enclosure, visualizing the Celestial Official, the Sun and Moon, and the Five Peaks and Four Legions of Soldiers arrayed before you,
while the Four Spirits align in order at your left, right, front, and rear.

Then chant the incantation of the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper Lords**:

*"O radiant Seven Stars, the Dipper’s handle shines bright.
Acquisitive Wolf wields evil, devouring Ghost consumes essence.
Mighty Gate blazes red, illuminating the dawn’s light.
Luck Store gallops swift, commanding celestial armies.
Scarlet Trumpet’s grace, its brilliance pierces the Pure and Chaste.
Majestic Threat looms, the True Person’s guiding star.
The Heavenly Marshal commands—Break Army Star Lord, seal the Four Gates,
and let turbid *qi* surge forth.
Ever wielding axe and halberd, seizing Heaven’s *Dīng* (丁),
a single shout to the south—terror strikes, hearts shatter.
Summon the Patrol Inspector, heed the voices sought,
the Nine Regions’ community officers—none escape uncalled by name.
Slay the wicked, punish the guilty—no crime is light.
The rebellious perish, the merciful live on.
Heads severed, limbs chopped, bodies crushed to dust—
demons and monsters purged, humanity at peace.
Healing sickness, banishing malevolence—
by imperial decree, this is to be carried out.
*Urgent, as the command decrees."*

「Next, the invocation of officials by rank.
With all ranks now humbly petitioning, I respectfully request this below for the construction of a grand ritual hall (*dàzhāi*) for my family, following the prescribed rites.

Conveniently, as the patrol progresses to the Ghost Gate (*guǐmén*), I humbly invoke:
- **Heavenly Immortal** armies and cavalry (*tiānxiān bīngmǎ*),
- **Earthly Immortal** armies and cavalry (*dìxiān bīngmǎ*),
- **Flying Immortal** armies and cavalry (*fēixiān bīngmǎ*),
- **True Person** (*Zhēnrén*) armies and cavalry,
- **Sun and Moon, Star Host** (*rìyuè xīngxiù*) armies and cavalry,
- **Nine Palaces, Five Emperors** (*jiǔgōng wǔdì*) armies and cavalry,
- **Three Rivers, Four Seas** (*sānhé sìhǎi*) forces,
- **Five Mountains, Four Great Waterways** (*wǔyuè sìdú*) armies and cavalry—
each is respectfully summoned in full array, to proceed in orderly succession to the ritual platform (*tánchǎng*).

Circumambulate the platform three times, first observing its breadth and narrowness, then reciting the incantation (*niàn zhou*).

At each invocation of full array, when the feet reach the Ghost Gate, strike the earth with the sword’s tip, then turn left three times.

Cover the platform threefold:
- Above, deploy the **Heavenly Net** (*tiānluó*), drawing seven strokes horizontally,
- Below, spread the **Earthly Net** (*dìwǎng*), drawing seven strokes vertically.

All fallen corpses and lingering *qi*, earthly and wooden spirits (*tǔmù bǎi jīng*), those who obstruct the Dao—
collect and consign them beneath the **Pole Star Marshal** (*kuígāng*), descending into the earth ten thousand *zhang*, motionless and inert.
*Urgent, as the command decrees.*

Write the **Ghost Character** (*guǐzì*), plant the sword at the Ghost’s Heart, and spray water while reciting the incantation:
*"The Five Phases (*wǔxíng*) mutually propel, the Pole Star Marshal holds supreme authority.
The Six Celestial Periods (*liùjì*) aid me, the Three Sovereigns (*sāntái*) banish the unrighteous.
Heaven revolves, Earth turns—yin and yang [?] open.
Eternal life transcends the world, Sun and Moon shine together.
*Urgent, as the command decrees."*

Heaven’s amnesty shines resplendently, Earth’s amnesty extends squarely.
With the **Yú Steps** (*yǔbù*) performed, all ghosts submit in hiding.
*Urgent, as the command decrees.*

Spray water and chant the **Summoning Incantation** (*shè*), then turn right, circling the body while exiting the **Fighting Formation** (*dǒu*), avoiding the **Star Host’s Ranks** (*xīngxiù jīngyīn*) and the **Pole Star Seal** (*tīngyìn*), and recite:
*"All malevolent and impure forces—
motionless and inert, strike the teeth three times, then return to their positions.
Turn right and draw the Ghost Character, overlapping it repeatedly—
this is called the **Seal of All Malevolent Impurities** (*shōu yīqiè xiéjì yìn*)."*

**Du Tianxiān’s (杜天师) Sword-Killing Incantation**
By the **Supreme Emperor’s** (*Tàishàng*) decree, I universally proclaim to all spirits (*wànlíng*).
Hurry the **Heavenly True Ones** (*tiānzhēn*), all convene at the Imperial Court (*dìtíng*).
With a single command, the **Double Sovereigns** (*shuānghuáng*) descend, their essence refined.
Overseeing and inspecting, repelling evil, regulating *qi*, and summoning life.

If any omen is unauspicious, testing the divine—
the Seven Gods (*qīshén*) wield their axes, the **Heavenly Thunderbolt** (*tiānfēng*) strikes rightward.
Brandishing the sword to lead the charge, hurling the **Fire Bell** (*huǒlíng*), summoning the **Divine Armor** (*jiàmìng jiǎzhōu*), and the **Tiger Soldiers** (*hǔzú tiāndīng*).
Wind and fire wage battle together, slaying evil and binding spirits.
Above, they threaten the Six Heavens (*liùtiān*), below, they subdue demonic spirits (*móolíng*).
Once demonic spirits are subdued, all ten thousand malevolent forces perish—
lances strike, lightning sweeps, no wicked demon survives.

The **Former Emperor** (*xiānhuáng*) established the decree—
who dares defy it? Those who resist the decree shall be exterminated.
Each must respect and be cautious, safeguarding this **Yellow Peace** (*huángníng*).
The Nine Heavens decree, all spirits heed.
*Urgent, as the command decrees.*

**Deploy the Endless Golden Talisman Rite (*wújìn jīnluó yí*) to Subdue the Sword-Killing Incantation** (*zhōngjiàn*)
By the **Supreme Emperor’s** decree, I universally proclaim to all spirits.
Command the **Heavenly Generals** (*tiānjiāng*), lead the **Heavenly Soldiers** (*tiāndīng*), strike the **Heavenly Drum** (*fátiāngǔ*), raise the **Heavenly Banners** (*yáng tiānjīng*), brandish the **Golden Star** (*huáng jīnxīng*), hurl the **Fire Bell**, capture the **Shadowless** (*wúyǐng*), search the **Soundless** (*wúshēng*), align at the **Tranquil Stage** (*zhèngtàijiē*), sweep away the **Interfering Bandits** (*sǎochāndiào*), and disperse the **Evil Wind** (*yáng xiéfēng*) at the **Ten Extremes** (*shíjí*), spreading **True *Qi*** (*zhēnqì*) across the **Eight Strings** (*bāxián*).

The **Heavenly True Ones** descend, their威光 ascending pure.
All demons vanish, ten thousand monsters obliterate—
the Nine Heavens proclaim the decree, all spirits obey.
*Urgent, as the command decrees.*

**Yang Zigong’s (杨次公) Imperial Edict to Water for Summoning the White** (*shuǐqǐ bái*)
The **River Chart** (*Hétú*) ascends as an auspicious sign, revealing Heaven’s bright intent.
The **Golden Talisman’s** grand rites (*jīnluó hóngyí*) are established in the sacred age.
I, the subject, humbly emulate the **True Transformation** (*zhēnhuà*), presuming to be a **Ritual Officer** (*zhìguān*).
What I pray for is truly answered—how dare I forget to report my gratitude?
*[My intent is as follows:]* The rest is the same as above.

**Deploy the Endless Summoning Edict** (*zhāng wújìn qǐbái*)
The **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*) contains the Three (*sānhé*), indistinct and formless.
The **Great Uncarved Block** (*Dàkuài*) breathes forth ten thousand, uneven and disordered.
Numbers come and go—Dao ever rescues.
**Yuan Shi** (*Yuánshǐ*) issued the **Jade Writing** (*yùwén*), **Zǐhuáng** (*Zǐhuáng*) bestowed the **Golden Talisman** (*jīnluó*).
I, the subject, presuming to be a **Ritual Officer**, carry out the **True Teaching** (*zhēnjiào*).
Receiving words to pray and supplicate—how dare I not report them?
*[My intent is as follows:]* The rest is the same as above.

Again...」

**True Riding Descends and Soars Below** (*Zhēnyù xià xiáng*)
The **Dao’s Sovereign** (*Tàijí*) rests the **Divine Wind** (*shénfēng*), calming all into stillness;
The **Fragrant Field** (*xūncháng*) spreads open in the center, sweeping away the **impure qi** (*jìqì*) in its chaotic dispersion.

Ten directions radiate with the **jewel-like clarity** (*yùguāng*) of the void,
The Four Seasons reveal the **serene expanse** (*chéngqīng*) of the heavenly firmament.

How could I allow malevolent forces to persist?
I dare not let them linger unchecked.

I shall summon the **Sword-Wielding Spirit of Water** (*jiànshuǐ shén*) to purify the **ritual grounds** (*táncháng*).

Thus, the **tempestuous miasma** (*biāojǐng*) may recede,
And the **divine inspection** (*jiàn*) descend upon the clear and bright.

**My intent is as follows:** The subjects, how dare we not **refine our form and qi** (*dǎoliàn xíngqì*), **dispel our turbid spirit** (*shūluán jīngshén*), **cleanse impurities and dispel the thick haze** (*jiěhuì chú fēn*), and **invite the True and Descend the Sacred** (*yánzhēn jiàngshèng*)?

The **Grace of the Most High** (*Tàishàng*) is the **New Edict** (*Bùxīn*), the **Heavenly Venerable** (*Tiānzūn*) bestows the **Great Benevolence** (*Zhìdà*).
The **True Teaching** (*Zhēnjiào*) is proclaimed, and **Divine Officers** (*Jiàngguān*) are dispatched to **Descend and Inspect** (*Jiàngjiàn*).
Thus, Heaven remains free of **thick miasmas** (*fēn*), Earth free of **malevolent dust** (*yāochén*).
The **yin mists** (*yīnyǎ*) are dispelled, the **yang light** (*yángguāng*) shines pure and clear;
The **Wind Master** (*Fēngshī*) restrains all movement, so not even the finest specks stir,
The **Luminous Clouds** (*Léimài*) rise to **exalt their brilliance** (*yánghuī*), and **auspicious qi** (*ruìqì*) floats through the sky.

Thus, the **sincere and earnest** (*chéngqūn*) may ascend in prayer,
And the **divine response** (*shén*) will come as if in answer.

The subject, prostrate in thought, **focuses the mind** (*shénniàn*) upon the **True Dao** (*Zhēndào*).
Humbly awaiting the **retribution of response** (*bàoyìng*).

---

**The Source of the Ultimate Dao** (*Zhìdào zhōng*)
Its **hidden mysteries** (*yǐnmiào*) are found in the **formless origin** (*hùn máng shǒu*);
Its **divine virtue** (*shénzhēn*) manifests the **sacred transformation** (*dé*) before the **beginning of creation** (*kāipì zhī qián*).

From this stem the **models for all sovereigns** (*mófàn bǎiwáng*), the **birth of myriad things** (*shēngchéng wànhuì*).
As the **Ancestor of the Void and the Perfect** (*Chōngxū Dàodé*), it **bestows the Eight Auspicious Signs** (*chuí bājǐng*) with **luminous scriptures** (*zhì língwén*);
As the **Heir to the Mysterious Origin of Purity** (*jì xuānyuán qīngjìng*), it **descends the Precious Talismans** (*jiàng sāntiān bǎoluó*) of the **Three Heavens** (*Sāntiān*).

The **Dao** is transmitted through the **Zhèngyī** (正一) lineage,
Its duty lies in **Yángpíng** (阳平) governance,
Thus it aids the **Xuānyuán** (玄元) transmission of the **Teaching** (*jiào*),
The **Celestial Master** (*Tiānshī*) receives it,
And **subdues the perverse** (*shè yé*) to return to the **Way**.

Water is the **first of the Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*),
And all impurities are removed;
The sword is the **refined strength of a hundred forges** (*Bǎiliàn zhī gāng*),
And no malevolent force (*miǎo* 妖) remains unsevered.
Your servants have long awaited the **hosted blessings** (*sùqìng* 宿庆),
And now follow the **true wind** (*zhēnfēng* 真风).

The **yellow silk** (*Huángsū* 黄素) bears the **flying scriptures** (*fēizhāng* 飞章),
Transmitting the **Precious Talismans** (*bǎoluó* 宝箓) of the **Nine Auspicious Dragons** (*Jiǔfèng pòhuì* 九凤破秽);
The **green thread** (*Qīngsī* 青丝) binds the **sacred knots** (*jiéniǔ* 结纽),
Receiving the **scriptures** (*wén* 文) of the **Ten Heavens** summoning the **Dragon** (*Shí Tiān zhāo Lóng* 十天召龙).

Bound by **conduct** (*xíngchí* 行持) and **pledged to benefit beings** (*jìwù* 济物),
We have accepted the **urgent words** (*lái cí* 来词) with sincerity,
And dare not neglect the **broken oath** (*liè quàn* 裂券) of our **vows**.

Entering the heart, Your servants refine the **water of the Jade Pool** (*Huápí* 华池),
And spread the **great Teaching’s** (*Dàjiào* 大教) **wind** (*fēng* 风).
With reverence, we uphold the **feathered standards** (*yǔyí* 羽仪),
Clearing away the **malevolent qi** (*miǎoqì* 妖氛) that disrupts;
Purifying the **cloud paths** (*yúnlù* 云路), we **forebearingly await** (*qián zhān* 前瞻) the **shattered and solemn** (*suīmù* 碎穆) **form**.

Greatly, the **Highest Dao** (*Dà Yǒu* 大有) and **Most Exalted Truth** (*Gāozhēn* 高真)
The **Ultimate None** (*Tài Wúshàng* 太无上) and **Most Holy Sage** (*Shèngshèng* 上圣)
**Gather the clouds and rainbows** (*guà yún ní* 廓云霓),
And **descend upon the gathered** (*fù jí* 俯集) to **oversee the opening** (*pì Chānghé* 辟阊阖);
They **admonish their appointed officers** (*shēn yōushī* 申饬攸司),
And **purify the sacrificial altars** (*sù qīng tán lǘ* 肃清坛驴),
So that **heaven and humanity may harmonize** (*shù Tiānrén* 庶天人),
And the **profound and manifest may communicate** (*bǐ yōuxiǎn* 俾幽显),
Thus fulfilling the **ordinary expectations** (*shì fù fánqíng* 式副凡情)
And **making clear the Dao of Heaven** (*Kǒngzhāo Tiāndào* 孔昭天道).

Your servants concentrate our **spirit** (*shén* 神) in the **Emerald Deeps** (*Bìluò* 碧落),
And focus our **aspirations** (*zhì* 志) in the **Crimson Expanse** (*Dānxiāo* 丹霄),
Humbling ourselves in **spiritual contemplation** (*sī shén* 思神),
And **reverently awaiting** (*gōngsì* 恭俟) the **radiant response** (*zhāobào* 昭报).

**Newly composed** (*Xīnxiū* 新修).

With deepest reverence, we acknowledge that the **Celestial Chariot** (*Dìchē* 帝车) descends—how could we tolerate any defilement lingering?
Our **inner chambers** remain unemptied; how could external malevolence dare intrude?

We **align with Heaven** (*shì Tiān* 事天) to **nurture our nature** (*yǎngxìng* 养性), and dare to clear the earth as our altar.
Though we profess reverence without exception, we still fear our devotion may fall short.

To **honor the Venerable Ones** (*Chóngzhēn* 崇真), we first **perform the rites of purification** (*jiěhuì* 解秽).
Where the **spiritual incantations** (*shénzhòu* 神咒) are invoked, the **malevolent qi** (*yāofēn* 妖氛) is utterly dispersed.

In accordance with this intent, the subsequent text follows as before.

We dare not fail to **purify our hearts and minds** (*xǐqīng xīndì* 洗清心地) and establish an altar **akin to the Sovereign’s** (*lèidì* 类帝).
We **cleanse and refine** (*quánjié* 蠲洁) the ritual implements, and **properly display** (*shìzhǎn* 式展) the rites to Heaven.

We greatly fear that **malevolent dust** (*yāochén* 妖尘) may obstruct, making it difficult to approach the **sudden divine descent** (*biāoxū* 飙欻).
With deepest humility, we pray that the **Most High** (*Tàishàng* 太上) may **reiterate commands** (*shēnchì* 申敕) to the **thousand officials** and **warn** (*jiéyán* 戒严) the **ten thousand cavalry**.

Let the **four boundaries be cleared** (*guòqīng sìjiè* 廓清四界), and the **auspicious formations** (*sēnzǎo* 森藻) stand guard at the **fragrant ritual grounds** (*xūncáng* 熏场).
Let the **exorcisms** (*zhènfú* 振祓) subdue the **malevolent forces** (*tánxiōng* 覃凶), and the **divine winds** (*biāo* 飙) descend upon the **embroidered seat** (*fǔzuò* 黼座).

May the **howling winds, rain, and thunder** (*língyǔzhènfēng* 凌雨震风) cease at dawn and dusk,
And may we behold the **auspicious stars and luminous sun** (*jǐngxīngruìrì* 景星瑞日) in darkness and light.
Thus may **flourishing virtue** (*màoduì* 茂对) answer to **manifest authority** (*míngwēi* 明威),
And may our **ritual endeavors** (*lící* 厘事) be fulfilled.

We, your servants, **direct our hearts to the Crimson Steps** (*Dān Bì* 丹陛),
And **still our breath at the Purple Altar** (*Zǐ Tán* 紫坛),
Humbling ourselves in **spiritual contemplation** (*sī shén* 思神),
And **reverently awaiting** (*gōngsì* 恭俟) the **radiant response** (*zhāobào* 昭报).

**The Daoist Canon’s Universal Teachings** (*Dàomén Tōngjiào* 道门通教) must employ **Volume Seven** (*Jíjuàn zhī qī* 集卷之七竟) and **Volume Eight** (*Jíjuàn zhī bā* 集卷之八).

**The Daoist Master Lü Taigu of Hèlín’s Collection**
**Chapter on Ritual Dignity**
**Yellow Talisman Nine-Hour Invocation Scripture**
**First Hour**
*With this first recitation today,*
We **divine auspicious omens for the realm** and **pray for the sovereign’s eternal life.**

**Gathered Daoists ascend the altar**, holding in mind the **Celestial Worthy’s sacred name**,
And **recite in rotation** the *Supreme Daoist Classic of the Primordial Origin and Supreme Virtue: The Dao and Its Power*,
**The True Scripture of the Yellow Emperor**.

For this Scripture—
From the **Five Phases’ inception**, before **Heaven and Earth were divided**,
When **spiritual winds gathered in mystery** and **void and substance congealed in brilliance**,
When **precious texts formed in the Primordial Mixture** and **jade characters emerged from Solitary Transformation**,
When it **stood forth in the depths of obscurity** and **shone before the Dark and Yellow**,
The sun and moon **received it to illuminate**, and **Heaven and Earth relied upon it to move**.

Thus, the **Emperor of the Void** commanded **Lord of the Primordial Beginning** to
**Inscribe it upon jade tablets**, **compile it in jade slips**,
**Store it in a treasure chest**, **gather it in a jade terrace**,
**First concealing it in the Upper Primordial**, then **flowing it to the lower lands**,
**Descending to enlighten the virtuous**, and **bestowing this culture**.

**Fu Xi received the Spiritual Diagram**, **Huangdi received the Symbolic Talisman**,
**Emperor Shao received the Sacred Edicts**, **Yu the Great received the Luo Book**.
Thus, **the Dao’s teachings were established**, and **cultural texts descended from this moment**.

When the **Primordial Origin descended as Sage**,
And **served as imperial preceptor**,
Yet **the Great Dao was not practiced**, and **human morals grew corrupt**,
He **proclaimed the Five-Thousand-Word Doctrine of Dao and Virtue**,
To **restore the source of purity and simplicity**.

Its words—
**Boundless yet encompassing all**, **minute yet including all**,
**Exhausting all mysteries in principle**, **harmonizing with the Void in meaning**,
**Internally governing the body**, **externally ordering the state**,
When **studied, resonate with the Supreme Ultimate**,
When **practiced, bring peace and prosperity to the land**,
**As the ancestral root of all things**, **the origin of Heaven and Earth**.

This Scripture’s **sublime excellence** is **beyond full praise**,
Yet we **assemble these extraordinary merits** in reverence,
And **pray for the longevity of the present Emperor**.

May the **Sovereign’s person be at ease and flourishing**,
May **years match the celestial poles** in length,
May **Heaven’s writ descend** and **great undertakings prosper**,
May **imperial reigns extend** and **the nation’s foundations deepen**,
May **weapons rest** and **the world be tranquil**,
May **pure customs revive** and **the age of peace prevail**,
May **rains be timely and winds harmonious**, **wealth abundant for families and state**.

All **sentient beings** shall **align with the Dao’s truth**,
And **distant lands and remote regions** shall **return to the Right Path**.

Then **calamities or blessings manifest accordingly** [祸福應見 *huòfú yìngjiàn*].

The **Nine Yang Solar Calamities** [陽九 *yáng jiǔ*] and the **One Hundred and Six Terrestrial Calamities** [百六 *bǎiliù*]
Cause the **eclipse of the sun and moon** [日月失昏 *rìyuè shīhūn*],
And the **erratic movement of the stars and constellations** [星宿錯度 *xīngxiù cuòdù*].
The greater disasters **imperil the august sovereign** [忧形帝主 *yōuxíng dìzhǔ*],
While the lesser afflict **all living beings** [災及生靈 *zāi jí shēnglíng*].
Or they **ignite fourfold wars** [兵革四興 *bīngé sìxīng*],
Or **spawn calamities and omens in competition** [災祥競起 *zāixiáng jìngqǐ*],
Bringing **the sufferings of famine, epidemics, insects, and locusts, floods, and fires** [饥荒疾疫之苦 *jīhuāng jíyì zhī kǔ*],
And **the perils of plagues, droughts, and conflagrations** [虫蝗水火之虞 *chónghuáng shuǐhuǒ zhī yú*].

To **eliminate disasters and dispel evil** [兔災以除凶 *tìzāi yǐ chúxiōng*],
One must **recite the scriptures and practice the Dao** [當誦經而行道 *dāng sòngjīng ér xíngdào*].

In ancient times, upon the **Great Luo Celestial Realm** [大羅天上 *Dàluó Tiānshàng*],
The **Primordial Compassionate Sovereign** [元始慈尊 *Yuánshǐ cízūn*] sounded the **law-drum** [法鼓 *fǎgǔ*],
And struck the **jade chimes** [琼钟 *qióngzhōng*],
Summoning the **ten directions** [十方 *shífāng*] and gathering the **multitude of saints** [眾聖 *zhòngshèng*],
To expound upon the **retribution of virtue and vice** [善惡之報應 *shàn'è zhī bàoyìng*],
And demonstrate the **causes of sin and blessings** [罪福之因緣 *zuìfú zhī yīnyuán*],
Displaying this scripture, **compassionate toward those yet unaware** [愍兹未悟 *mǐn zī wèi wú*],
With **merits profound and weighty** [功德深重 *gōngdé shēnzhòng*],
Whose **joy and celebration are beyond expression** [喜慶難言 *xǐqìng nányán*].

All who **aspire to cultivation and reverence** [有修崇 *yǒu xiūchóng*]
Should **diligently recite** [當勤訓誦 *dāng qín xùnsòng*].

May the **Seven Celestial Officials** [七政 *qīzhèng*] align in harmony,
And the **sovereign’s sacred deeds** [聖功 *shènggōng*] manifest in splendor,
May the **Five Stars** [五星 *wǔxīng*] converge,
And the **national fortune** [國祚 *guózhuó*] flourish in prosperity,
May **latent solar calamities** [潛消災變 *qiánxiāo zāibiàn*] be dispelled,
And the **radiant virtues of celestial illumination** [丕顯照臨之德 *pǔxiǎn zhàolín zhī dé*] shine forth,
May **auspicious clouds** [景雲 *jǐngyún*] present **divine omens** [呈瑞 *chéngruì*],
And **malevolent energies** [妖氣 *yāoqì*] be **banished** [屏收 *píngshōu*],
May the **world attain the utmost peace and order** [世臻極治之安 *shì zhēn jíjì zhī ān*],
And all **sentient beings recognize the joy of life** [人識有生之樂 *rén shí yǒushēng zhī lè*].

We now rely upon the **Pure and Numerous** [清眾 *Qīngzhòng*],
Each **invoking the sacred titles** [各持念 *gè chíniàn*] of the **Supreme Sovereign Lord of the Upper Eon’s Solar Palace** [上元日宮皇極天尊 *Shàngyuán Rìgōng Huángjí Tiānzūn*],
The **Sovereign Lord of the Middle Eon’s Lunar Palace** [中元月宮正一天尊 *Zhōngyuán Yuègōng Zhèng Tiānzūn*],

The **Sovereign Lord of the Radiant Opening and Preservation of Life** [開輝保生天尊 *Kāihuī Bǎoshēng Tiānzūn*],
The **Sovereign Lord of the Luminous Sun and Moon** [日月光明天尊 *Rìyuè Guāngmíng Tiānzūn*],
The **Sovereign Lord of the Pure and Flowing Light** [清淨流光天尊 *Qīngjìng Liúguāng Tiānzūn*],
The **Sovereign Lord of Subduing Demons and Quelling Disturbances** [收魔滅惱天尊 *Shōumó Miènǎo Tiānzūn*],

The **True Person of the Solar Light** [日光真人 *Rìguāng Zhēnrén*],
The **True Person of the Lunar Light** [月光真人 *Yuèguāng Zhēnrén*],
And the **True Person of the Stellar Light** [星光真人 *Xīngguāng Zhēnrén*],
Whose **inconceivable merits** [不可思議功德 *Bùkě Sīyì Gōngdé*] are profound.

Next, we **each recite** [各轉 *gè zhuàn*] the **Scripture of the Great Incantation for Disaster Elimination by the Eleven Luminaries** [《十一曜大消災神咒經》 *Shíyīyào Dàxiāozāi Shénzhòu Jīng*],
And the **Scripture of the Spirit Treasure for Disaster Warding and Eon Salvation** [《靈寶禳災度厄真經》 *Língbǎo Rángzāi Dùè Zhēnjīng*].

In the **third recitation** [第三時 *dì sān shí*],
We now **recite this third time** [以今第三遍 *yǐ jīn dì sān biàn*],
To **offer reverence to all beneath the universal canopy** [溥天之下 *pǔtiān zhīxià*],
Who have **contributed to the realm** [有功於國 *yǒugōng yú guó*],
And **should be honored with sacrificial rites** [應當祀典 *yìngdāng sìdiǎn*],
To the **divine officials of merit and virtue in all temples** [諸廟福德正神 *zhūmiào fúdé zhèngshén*],
To **augment their sacred radiance** [增助威光 *zēngzhù wēiguāng*],
And **secure the peace of the national borders** [保寧國界 *bǎoníng guójiè*].

We rely upon the **converged Daoist assembly** [坛道眾 *tándào zhòng*],
**Invoking the sacred titles** [持念天尊聖號 *chíniàn Tiānzūn shènghào*] of the Celestial Sovereigns,
And **recite in succession** [轉誦 *zhuàn sòng*] the **Scripture of the Supreme Ascension to the Mysterious for Disaster Elimination and Protection of Life** [《太上升玄消災護命妙經》 *Tàishàng Shēngxuán Xiāozāi Hùmìng Miàojīng*],
And the **Scripture of the Yellow Emperor’s Dark Sympathy** [《黃帝陰符經》 *Huángdì Yīnfǔ Jīng*],
To **extend reciprocal kindness** [以伸回施 *yǐ shēn huíshī*].

The **sweating wooden horse** manifests the **Divine General of Jin’s** extraordinary merit.
**Civilization flourishes in the realm**, and **sovereign majesty extends to the four seas**—
the **nation relies upon this for stability**, while **scholars and commoners alike turn to it in prayer**.

Now, the **Yellow Altar is erected**, and **reverently unveiled are the purple scrolls**—
**trusting in the Dao’s power**, we **aspire to exalt the sacred radiance**.

May **blessings perpetuate the imperial vision**, ensuring **eternal peace for all lands**;
may **names be inscribed in the Celestial Register**, ever **witnessing the boundless transformations of virtue**.

Then, **bestow blessings upon the ritual officers**, let **auspiciousness flow through the household**—
**no calamity shall remain unresolved**, and **every wish shall be fulfilled**.
**Relying upon this grace**, we **pledge with solemn devotion to repay with reverence**.

With **deepest reverence**, we **invoke the Pure-Origined Celestial Sovereign of Revealed Teaching**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Great Auspicious Virtue**,

the **Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Spiritual Response**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Transformed Manifestation Without Limit**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Unobstructed Divine Power**,
the **True Person of Marvelous Conduct**,
the **True Person of Broad Faith**—
**inconceivable merit and virtue**.

Next, **recite in succession** the *Scripture of the Supreme Ascension to the Mysterious for Disaster Elimination and Protection of Life*,
and the *Scripture of the Yellow Emperor’s Dark Sympathy*.

---
**Fourth Session**
With this **fourth recitation**, we **offer on behalf of the ritual officer’s family**—
for **ancestors and departed kin**—
to **transmigrate and elevate their spirits**, ascending to the **Pure Realms**.

**Relying upon the assembled Daoist congregation**, we **invoke the Celestial Sovereigns’ sacred titles**,
and **recite in succession** the *Supreme Scripture of the Mysterious Treasure’s Boundless Liberation of Beings (Upper Grade)*.

For **Mysterious Treasure** is **one division of the Three Caverns**,
and **Boundless Liberation of Beings** is **one scroll of that division**.
Its **practices encompass many gates**,
while **its hymns commence with this volume**.

In ancient times, within the **True Realm of Floating Reeds**,
it was **first transmitted by the Sage of Memorized Discourse**,
initially **concealed in the Purple Micro Palace**,
its **manifest traces sealed away**—
a **hidden verse of the Celestial**, a **great scripture of the Dao**.
**Eight-cornered with radiant spikes**, it **originates from the Sovereign’s decree**;
**thousands of divine attendants** **universally guide humanity**.

Those who **nurture innate purity and rectitude**, harmonizing **heaven and earth**,
with **few desires and sincere thoughts**, abandoning **deceit for authenticity**,
**cleansing their minds through fasting**, **reciting with pure devotion**,
**accumulating inner concentration**, **radiating outer purity**—
**they may thus transform obscurity into clarity**, illuminating even the deepest darkness.
Like **white generated in an empty chamber**, or **evil dispelled by the Warm Springs**,
they **ascend joyfully to the Spring Terrace**, **crossing to the Realm of Longevity**.
**Sincerity’s reach knows no limit**; **auspiciousness is boundless**.

The *Scripture of the Treasure’s Liberation* **praises beyond measure**—
**gathering these wondrous virtues**, we **universally liberate the departed souls**.

May the **ancestors of past generations**, hearing this Scripture,
**pierce the True Principle**, **never forgetting their origin**,
soaring through the **forest of merit**, **freed from the duality of darkness and light**.

**Sacred texts transmute fate**; **alchemical fire refines the form**,
dwelling in **rewarding bodies within the Dao’s domain**.
Then, **ascending to the Azure Void**, **descending to the Golden Wheel**—
**all sentient beings alike attain the Dao’s shore**.

**Relying upon the Daoist assembly**, we **pray as above**,
each invoking the **Pure Heavenly Sovereign of the Void**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Mystic Dao**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Golden Gate’s Ultimate Truth**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Supreme One’s Rescue from Suffering**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Ever-Aiding the Ocean of Sorrow**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Law-Bridge’s Great Liberation**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Fragrant Grove’s Dharma-Talk**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Liberating Darkness and Light**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Unobstructed Soul-Protection**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Broadly Opening Expedients**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Willing Birth**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Allotted Rebirth**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Effortless Joy**,
the **True Person of Great Compassion and Rescue from Suffering**,
the **True Person of Great Pity and Eradication of Offenses**—
**inconceivable merit and virtue**.

Next, **recite in succession** the *Supreme Scripture of the Mysterious Treasure’s Boundless Liberation of Beings (Upper Grade)*.

---
**Fifth Session**
With this **fifth recitation**, we **offer to the Great Emperor Deng of the Underworld**,
the **officials of the Night Realm in the Yin Palace**,
the **Great Emperor Fu-Sang of the Water Palace**,
and the **spirits of the Pearl and Shell Palaces**.

**Relying upon the united Daoist congregation**, we **recite in succession** the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord’s Ever-Pure and Immaculate Teaching*,
and the *Scripture of True Ascension to Heaven and the Dao*,
**extending reciprocal kindness**.

For **the Earth governs the Water Palace**, and **judges the guilty spirits**;
the **Northern Sovereign’s Yin Officials** **once received transmission from the Teachings**.

With **reverence for these sacred texts**, we **aspire to exalt their radiance**,
hoping to **align with the True Virtue**, **elevating all to celestial ranks**,
**granting eternal night**, **enabling all to witness the light**.

Next, **even the living** shall **dissolve their transgressions**.

**Relying upon the pure assembly**, each **invokes the Celestial Sovereign of the Law-Treasury’s Jewel Script**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Compassionate Encirclement of the Three Realms**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Universal Transformation in the Six Paths**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Dragon King’s Transmutation**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Wheel-Turning Holy King**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Law-Realm’s Responsive Compassion**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Universal Liberation’s Marvels**,
the **True Person of Marvelous Conduct**,
the **True Person of Marvelous Appearance**—
**inconceivable merit and virtue**.

Next, **recite in succession** the *Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s True Ascension to Heaven and the Dao*,
and the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord’s Ever-Pure and Immaculate Teaching*.

---
**Sixth Session**
With this **sixth recitation**, we **offer for the six paths of the Nine Abysses**,
the **five solitary souls of the underworld**.

**Relying upon the law-assembly**, we **invoke the Celestial Sovereigns’ sacred titles**,
and **recite in succession** the *Scripture of the Supreme Lord’s Heart-Seal for Extracting Offenses from the Nine Dark Realms*,
and the *Scripture of the Ten Directions’ Wondrous Rescue from Suffering*.

For **countless kalpas of sinking**, **originating from a single deluded thought**;
**nine abysses of darkness**, **arising from ignorance of the Three Lights**.
Without **ferries of salvation**, who **borrows ladders of transcendence**?

Now, the **Law Assembly is convened**, **broadly rescuing the submerged spirits**,
wishing to **hear the True Dharma’s sound**, **fully awakening to the Eternal Principle**.

**Relying upon the law-assembly**, each **invokes the Celestial Sovereign of Transforming the Three Paths**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Rescuing the Eight Sufferings**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Eliminating Afflictions**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of Transcending Birth and Death**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Formless**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Void of Characteristics**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless**,
the **Celestial Sovereign of the Ocean of Merit**,
the **True Person of Great Concealment**,
the **True Person of Rescue and Liberation**—
**inconceivable merit and virtue**.

Now, each recites the *Nine Abysses Extracting Offenses Heart Seal Scripture* and the *Ten Directions Miraculous Scripture for Rescue from Suffering*.

**In the seventh session**, with this seventh recitation, we solemnly offer prayers for the **host of the ritual** [certain family] to **alleviate disasters and escape calamities**, to **invoke blessings and prolong life**.
Relying upon the **congregation of Daoists** at the assembled altar, we invoke the **sacred names of the Celestial Sovereigns** and recite the *True Scripture of the North and South Two Luchres for Prolonging Life*, praying for **auspicious blessings**.

**Indeed, the human body is hard to obtain**, and **birth in the Central Realm is rare**; even if one is born, **encountering the True Dao is difficult**.
The **wondrous teachings of the immortals** alone can **fully grasp the Dao’s power**—once the mind of faith arises, **illumination follows from past practice**.

In antiquity, the **Daoist Ancestor of the Mixed Primordial** **compassionately surveyed the lost multitude**; the **True Person of Oneness** **personally transmitted the sacred texts**.
Some were received from the **Jade Bureau**, others descended through **Crane’s Call**—all are the **true scriptures of the Nine Heavens and Eight Assemblies**, the **highest Dao of the Three Caverns and Three Purity Realms**, benefiting all beings and serving as the **ferry for crossing the sea of existence**.

**All who witness or hear**—how could they **lightly abandon life** while **ignoring their true origin**?
**Those who diligently read and recite**—thus do they **come to know their fate and return to the True**.

Here, we establish the **precious altar** and **unveil the profound essence**.
We wish the **ritual officials** [certain names] to **follow this practice and solemnly observe**, to **devote themselves to recitation**, so that the **Northern Treasury dispels calamities**, the **Southern Palace bestows wealth**, the **Dao-heart unfolds**, the **wisdom-nature clarifies**, **dusty toil is cleansed**, and **delusion is dispelled**—gradually ascending to the **wondrous fruit**, firmly rooted in the **mysterious merit**.

**Blessings extend to the living and the dead**, **merit permeates land and water**—forever transcending the **profane net**, all entering the **Golden Gate**,** fulfilling the True Oneness’s doctrine**, and **aligning with the Hermit’s intent**.

Relying upon the **pure assembly**, each invokes the **sacred names of**:
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Infinite Transformation**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Worldly Salvation**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Perfect Right Wisdom**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Attending to Karmic Responses**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Remote Dao Propagation**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Karmic Recompense**,
- the **True Person of Dharma Liberation**,
- the **True Person of the Supreme Polarity**,
- the **Natural Wisdom Law-body True Person**,
- the **Mysterious [True Person of] Peerless Supreme Virtue**—
**inconceivable merit and virtue**.

Next, each recites:
- the *Supreme Scripture of the Primordial Mysterious Northern Luchre for Prolonging Life and Original Fate* (one scroll),
- the *Supreme Scripture of the Southern Luchre’s Six Offices for Prolonging Life and Guiding People* (one scroll).

**In the eighth session**, with this eighth recitation, we **repay the labor of the host’s parents** and **honor the profound debt of great kindness**.
Relying upon the **congregation of Daoists** at the assembled altar, we invoke the **sacred names of the Celestial Sovereigns** and recite the *Supreme Scripture of True Oneness for Repaying Parental恩重*, the *Scripture of the Spiritually Martial for Repaying Parental恩重*.
**Since the Primordial Unity’s judgment**, the **Nine Qi** have **formed the body**—each breath of *qi* ceases not, each life perpetuates.
**Among all things**, only **humanity is most refined**.
Though we **draw our breath from Yin and Yang**, truly we **receive our form from our parents**.
**Hair and skin, flesh and bone**—each generation **passes the torch**.
**Countless kalpas** have come and gone, **numberless beyond reckoning**.
**The self-image arises**, then **decay begins**.
**Because of the self-image**, the **Six Kinships** emerge.
**Branches spread**, the **source fades**.

**Discussing lineage**, though ancient and modern differ—
**regarding virtue and vice**, past and present are **inextricably linked**.
Like **shadows following form**, they **cannot be separated**.

In days of old, the **Celestial Sovereign of the Western Jade Realm** **expounded the hardship of repaying恩**, and in the **Kaihuang Kalpa**, the **Supreme One** **admonished the unfilial child**—
**those who come after**, how could they **fail to reflect**?

**Through the ritual of the Yellow Register**, we **formally enact the secrets of the Lingbo**.
**For the parents now in the ancestral hall**, we pray they be **granted supreme longevity**, like **pine and cypress at a thousand years old**; we pray this **face may flourish**, like **peach and plum in spring’s breeze**.
**With reverent and humble devotion to their porridge and water**, we hope to **slightly repay their toil**.

**For the parents of the past**, may their **bodies escape the Abyssal Realm**, their **ears hear the True Dharma**—
so that **beneath the Nine Springs**, no **unanswered grudge remains**, and **within the Three Realms**, they **attain unbounded joy**.
Thus, **their endless longing is fulfilled**, and **their eternal thoughts are slightly consoled**.

Relying upon the **pure assembly**, each invokes the **sacred names of**:
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Infinite Transformation**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Karmic Recompense**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Perfect Right Wisdom**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Attending to Karmic Responses**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Remote Dao Propagation**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Karmic Recompense**,
- the **True Person of Dharma Liberation**,
- the **True Person of the Supreme Polarity**—
**inconceivable merit and virtue**.

Next, each recites:
- the *Supreme Scripture of True Oneness for Repaying Parental恩重*,
- the *Scripture of the Spiritually Martial, Responsive True Lord, for Repaying Parental恩重*.

**In the ninth session**, with this ninth recitation, we **offer solemn prayers to the Three Caverns’ ritual officials, the generals and attendants of the Three Realms, the Four Direct Messengers, the local deities, and the gods of petition**—to **guard and protect the sacred altar’s officials and retinue**.
Relying upon the **congregation of Daoists** at the assembled altar, we invoke the **sacred names of the Celestial Sovereigns** and recite the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Purity Heavenly Child for Protecting Life* and the *Scripture of the Wisdom Observation of the Body*, to **extend our gratitude**.

**Since the Four Exaltations and Three Days**, the **Dao has ascended to the common realm**;
**when blessings are fulfilled**, the **Supreme One has labored through divine aid**.
Though **petitions are made for merit and demotion**, and **recitations are offered in gratitude**—we further **seek protection**, relying upon **beginning and end**.

Relying upon the **pure assembly**, for the **Supreme Cause**, each invokes the **sacred names of**:
- the **Celestial Sovereign of True Response**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Endless Response**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Ever-Increasing Merit**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Illuminating Divine Merit**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Harmonizing Spirits and Benefiting Things**,
- the **Celestial Sovereign of Perfect Merit**,
- the **True Person of Precious Form**,
- the **True Person of the Turning Wheel**—
**inconceivable merit and virtue**.

Next, each recites:
- the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Purity Heavenly Child for Protecting Life*,
- the *Scripture of the Wisdom Observation of the Body*.

**The Daoist ritual concludes with the eighth scroll of the General Teachings.**
**The Daoist ritual concludes with the ninth scroll of the General Teachings.**

*«The Daoist adept Lü Taigu of the Crane Forest School’s *Essentials of Refined Thought* (精思篇) – A Ritual Invocation*

**Ritual Invocation (发奏):**
Without first announcing to the Earth and Land deities (*告土地*), the adept proceeds to the **outer altar** (*外坛*) and performs the **host’s preliminary rites** (*宿启*). Later generations expanded these rites with formal compositions, reducing them to mere announcements and the placement of written petitions (*寻置文牒*).

For those who practice the ritual while seated in the **Master’s position** (*师位*), additional **seals, incantations, and talismans** (*印诀符咒*) are employed, summoning the Earth and Land deities (*土地诸神*)—this tradition stems from the *Heavenly Heart Orthodoxy* (*天心正法*).

Now, this has become established practice: once the deities are seated, the adept must **invoke the talismans for divine transformation** (*如法文变神搯诀*) in accordance with the prescribed rites before proceeding.

As recorded at the beginning of this section:
**Ritual Invocation (发奏):**
The adept arranges the Earth and Land deities (*土地等神*) at the **Celestial Gate** (*天门*), and the **Daoist Master** (*法师*) sits at the **southeast corner** (*东南隅*).

Upon taking his seat, the Master first **harmonizes his own person** (*存己身*), donning the **Fish-Tail Crown** (*鱼尾冠*), wrapping himself in the **Fish-Mane Robe** (*鱼鬣衣*), and wearing **crimson shoes** (*朱履*), as prescribed by the **Celestial Master** (*天师*).

Then, he performs the **talismans for divine transformation** (*搯变神诀*):
With the **left hand’s ring finger** (*左手小指*), he curves it backward from the **fourth finger** (*四指*), bending it into the **root of the middle finger** (*中指根*). The **fourth finger** (*四指*) is curled inward toward the **palm** (*掌心*), while the **middle finger** (*中指*) hooks and secures the **ring finger** (*小指*). The **thumb** (*大指*) then presses against the **middle joint of the middle finger** (*中指中节*). After releasing the **thumb** (*弹了大指*), he presses the **root of the second finger** (*第二指根*).

This is the **original Master’s seal and talisman** (*本师印诀*), invoking the **Six Jia and Six Ding** (*六甲六丁*), the **Four Celestial Gate Kings** (*四天门王*), the **Azure Dragon and White Tiger** (*青龙白虎*), and the **Vermilion Bird and Dark Tortoise** (*朱雀玄武*), arrayed in concentric ranks around him. Next, he invokes the **Earth and Land officials** (*土、地申奏官属*), who stand at the **Celestial Gate** (*天门*) awaiting command, each distinctly recognized.

Afterward, he **proclaims the summons** (*宣召*), directing them with his intent (*入意指挥*), and concludes with the **dismissal and farewell invocation** (*发引遣表*).

The Master, with his **left hand forming the talisman** (*搯印诀*), raises his **two fingers** (*二指*) to summon the scripture. With his **right hand wielding the Threefold Fire** (*仗三昧火*), he strikes the **roots of his four fingers** (*四指根节*) and recites the **Sword-Water Incantation** (*剑水咒*). Upon finishing the incantation (*噀水讫*), he **plants the sword** (*卓剑*).

At the **right side of his seat** (*坐右*), he forms the **Sword Talisman** (*卓剑诀*), striking the **root of his middle finger** (*右手中指根节*) toward the sword. Next, he **burns incense** (*焚香*), repeating the earlier **talisman for divine transformation** (*仍搯前变神诀*), visualizing the **Three Platform Stars** (*三台星*) upon the **back of his thumb** (*大指背*), known as the **Seven-Star Talisman** (*七星诀*).

After reciting the scripture and proclaiming the petitions (*念文宣牒讫*), he **dismisses the deities with incantations** (*遣牒诵咒*), invoking the **True Qi of the Great Sun** (*太阳赤气*), the **True Qi of the Great Moon** (*太阴白气*), and the **Three Platform Seven-Star True Qi** (*三台七星真气*), channeling them into the water (*流注水中*), and **drawing the qi with the sword** (*执剑取气*).

Upon finishing the incantation (*噀水讫*), the Master **directs his tongue to the upper palate** (*以舌主上腭*), transforming it into a **Golden Bridge** (*化为金桥*), allowing the Earth and Land officials to **deliver their petitions directly to the Celestial Gate** (*令土地申奏，从桥上径达天门*).

When the ritual is complete (*事讫*), he **restores the deities and offers repentance** (*还神回向*).

Extracted from the *Heavenly Heart Orthodoxy* (*天心正法*), recorded as *White Announcement of the Deities* (*白事*).»

The **Master of Qingdu Dao**, Zhang Wanfu, states:

*"The Daoist ritual of fasting is strict and exacting; all celestial deities and sages descend to observe. Every matter must conform to proper ritual standards, without neglecting or abandoning the prescribed rites and procedures."*

The **Great Cavern Master**, Xie Fanglai, further says:

*"When performing high-level petitionary rites, one must face east and stand upright. Below the rank of *Dujian* (都讲), all should face west to form a single rank. Standing upright, holding the tally tablet and bowing respectfully, one must regulate one’s breath and steady one’s *qi*, speak in measured, modest words, and maintain simplicity in ritual language. One must not raise one’s voice harshly, nor indulge in excessive ornamentation. Words should be concise, and meaning must be clear—avoid artificial embellishments, lest sincerity be lost."*

*"In all supplications, one must first repent of one’s transgressions before reporting the matter."*

Zhang Wanfu again says:

*"When ascending the platform to practice the Dao, one must first purify with incense and water, known as *Dangji* (荡秽). To draw forth and seal the *qi*, one must also purify, known as *Bizhenqi* (闭真气). When ascending the platform, one must strictly follow the ritual procedures established by the two Masters Zhang and Du. Before performing any rites, one must first go before the **Mysterious Master** (*玄师*), arrange the ranks, and chant the Dao. Upon reaching the platform’s entrance, one must hold the incantation and circle counterclockwise before ascending the **Celestial Gate** (*天门*) and offering incense to the Ten Directions. Then, one proceeds to the uppermost rank and performs the rites there—never omitting the proper announcement at the base of the platform, for such an omission is unknown in the original traditions and deviates from their intent.*

*"Indeed, from the **Ritual Master** (*礼师*), the **Qi-Storing Master** (*存神*), and the **Furnace-Opening Master** (*发炉*), all are meant to harmonize the inner and outer *qi*. Only after the **Spirit Official** (*灵官*)’s solemn rites are completed does one then invoke the **Daoist rank** (*法位*) and petition the **True Saints** (*诸真圣*). The logic of the announcement is clear and direct—omitting the base-platform announcement leaves no room for doubt or confusion.*

**Nighttime Entrance Incantation** (*夜入户咒*):
*"Standing to the left of the earthly entrance, thrice strike the teeth in reverence, and in secret invoke the **Four Bright Officials** (*四明功曹*), the **Dragon-Tiger Envoys** (*龙虎使者*), the **True One Originating Qi** (*正一生气*), and the **Attendant Pure Maiden** (*侍靖素女*). If there are matters to be reported at night, I pray for the **Open-Mind Child** (*开明童子*) and the **Upper Primordial Maiden** (*上元少女*) to accompany me into the hall and platform, conveying my petitions so that they may be heard above."*

**Nighttime Exit Incantation** (*夜出户咒*):
*"Exit the **Great Cavern** (*大洞*), ascending the **Great Yin** (*太阴*), the eight windows of illumination open, and all that has been presented is conveyed by the Pure Maiden."*

*"After the rites are finished, return to one’s proper station, and all the deities retreat in solemn rest. In the morning, the **Entrance Incantation** (*入户咒*) is:*
*'Four Bright Officials, the **Pure Truth Envoys** (*通真使者*), the **Jade-Tongued Youth** (*传言玉童*), and the **Attendant Pure Maiden**, I pray that you convey my petitions to the **True Deities** (*正神*) of the hall and platform, the **Primordial Originating Qi** (*上元生气*), and that they descend into my body.'*

**Morning Exit Incantation** (*朝出户咒*):
*'Exit the **Great Yin** and enter the **Great Yang** (*出阴入阳*), and all the deities are opened and communicated.'"*

Extracted from the *Heavenly Heart Orthodoxy* (*天心正法*), recorded as *White Announcement of the Deities* (*白事*).

After the rites are completed, the **Yellow Chamber** is closed. The **Attendant Pure Maiden** (*侍靖玉女*) stands vigilant in the sacred hall.

From the *Clarified Truth Rites* (*明真科*) of **Lu Tian师**, preserved by **Jianji Lu Tian师**:

*"The Dao begins with fasting; fasting begins with scripture. In observing fasting rites, one must first focus the mind with precision. In honoring the scriptures’ authority, one must ground oneself in stillness of thought. If the foundation is not upright, the ritual decorum will falter, failing to align with the scriptures—how then could one invoke the Mysterious Saints and attain virtue and wisdom? Drawing from myriad scriptures, I have marked their essential truths, following the ancestral traditions to aid practitioners.

Here is the **Essential Method for Concentrated Dao Practice and Spirit-Nurturing** (*道法精思存神诀*). Each practitioner must observe the teacher’s presence in accordance with the method.

Stand upright, close the eyes, and focus the spirit.

First, focus on the **Three Supreme Sovereigns** (*太上三尊*), seated upon the **Celestial Treasure Platform** (*天宝台*). To their left stand the **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures** (*三十六部尊经*), and to their right, the **Grand Master of the Mysterious Middle** (*玄中大法师*), the **Ten True Ones and Five Emperors** (*十真五帝*), with the assembled immortals and celestial attendants arrayed as in a grand court audience.

Next, focus on the **Scripture Master’s** presence, bowing inwardly three times, honoring the master’s lineage. Then focus on the **Transmission Master’s** presence, bowing inwardly three times, honoring the master’s lineage. Then focus on the **Initiation Master’s** presence, bowing inwardly three times, honoring one’s own lineage.

May my three masters ascend to the heights of the immortals, opening the way for my seven ancestral parents to swiftly attain the Celestial Hall, and may my name be inscribed among the immortals, forever as a **True Person** (*真人*).

At dawn, the **Yin Hour** (*寅时*), visualize **Green Qi** (*青气*) rising from the liver, ascending like clouds, encircling the altar hall. The **Azure Dragon** and **Lion** guard the fore and aft.

The **Celestial and Earthly Immortals**, **Heavenly Maidens and Jade Boys**, the **Solar, Lunar, and Stellar Hosts**, the **Five Emperors’ Armies**, each numbering ninety million, along with the **Supervising Officials of the Fast** and the **Three Realms’ Attendants**, array themselves on either side, enveloping the disciple’s dwelling—great and small—with cloud-mist.

At noon, the **Yang Hour** (*午时*), visualize **Red Qi** (*赤气*) rising from the heart, ascending like clouds, raining down upon the altar hall. The **Vermilion Bird** and **White Crane** guard the fore and aft.

The **Celestial and Earthly Immortals**, **Heavenly Maidens and Jade Boys**, the **Solar, Lunar, and Stellar Hosts**, the **Five Emperors’ Armies**, the **Supervising Officials of the Fast**, and the **Three Realms’ Attendants** array themselves on either side, enveloping the disciple’s dwelling—great and small—with cloud-mist.

At nightfall, the **Hai Hour** (*戌时*), visualize **White Qi** (*白气*) rising from the lungs, ascending like clouds, encircling the altar hall. The **White Tiger** and **Qilin** guard the four quarters.

The **Celestial and Earthly Immortals**, **Heavenly Maidens and Jade Boys**, the **Solar, Lunar, and Stellar Hosts**, the **Five Emperors’ Armies**, the **Supervising Officials of the Fast**, and the **Three Realms’ Attendants** array themselves on either side, enveloping the disciple’s dwelling—great and small—with cloud-mist.

Further, visualize the **Five Stars**, **Five Sacred Peaks**, and **Five Emperors** guarding one’s form. The **Five Zang Qi** ascend in radiant disorder, crowning the body like mist, as if enshrouded in vapor. A **Golden Radiance** (*金华*) crowns the head, transforming the body into gold, first emerging from the lungs, with a round luminous orb atop the crown—like the sun’s symbol—illuminating the ten directions. Within the body, all is clear, both inner and outer, fully revealed.

Then, practice the **Mysterious Observations**, penetrating the **Void and Profound**. This method is to be employed day and night, at the three critical hours."

Next, strike the **Law Drum** twenty-four times. The **Law Drum**—by gathering inner **qi** and aweing external spirits—is the first act of ritual. When striking the door’s upper and lower beams in rhythm, this is called the **Law Drum**. After every eight strikes, pause briefly, symbolizing the twenty-four **qi** phases of the cosmos.

Master Wanfu of the Celestial Masters said: *"The scriptures state that the Law Drum has three methods. First, strike silently without sound; second, strike so that it is heard; third, strike with an open mouth and relaxed cheeks, producing a deep, resonant sound—this is the method of self-cultivation. If the ritual assembly is large and noisy, striking silently is best, for then one’s mind may focus with precision, and the **qi** remains tranquil."*

The above method of **mindful striking** is recorded in the *Treatise on Natural Etiquette* and the *Golden Talisman Simplified Texts*.

According to the **refined contemplation** decreed by Master Lu, now called **"commanding demons through visualization"**—this is specifically for **Stepping Through the Void** (*bùxū*). Since **Stepping Through the Void** follows **commanding demons**, one first visualizes, then commands the demons, and proceeds to **Stepping Through the Void**. Indeed, all matters within **Stepping Through the Void** align with the *Jade Capital Stepping Through the Void Scripture*, hence the reliance on Master Lu’s teachings, detailed here.

**Refined Contemplation for Stepping Through the Void**
Master Lu said: *"When reciting the Stepping Through the Void Scripture, first strike the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and visualize the sun and moon upon your face. Let them enter through your nostrils into the Golden Flower Palace of the Inner Chamber, their radiance emerging from the nape, forming a nine-colored circular luminosity that descends into the Jade Pillow, illuminating the ten directions. As you circle the scripture in rotation, complete the practice, then strike the teeth three times and swallow saliva three times."*

*(Excerpted from the *Supreme Jade Scripture’s Hidden Commentary*)*
*The explanation of this method is also by Master Lu.*

**Refined Contemplation for Stepping Through the Void** *(continued)*

*"Visualize the sun and moon upon your own face. The sun’s hue is red, with a purple radiance of nine rays. The moon’s hue is yellow, with a white radiance of ten rays. The sun stands to your left, the moon to your right, nine chi distant from your face. The sun’s rays descend straight from the left, entering through the left nostril. The moon’s rays descend straight from the right, entering through the right nostril. Together, they penetrate into the Golden Flower Palace of the Inner Chamber. The Golden Flower Palace is the point five cun directly inward from between the brows. Their radiance then descends into the Jade Pillow, emerging from the nape. The entire head is called the Níhuán Palace; one cun inward from the brows is the Míngtáng Palace, two cun the Dòngfáng Palace, three cun the Dāntián Palace, four cun the Liúzhū Palace, and five cun the Jīnhuá Palace—also known as the Inner Chamber of the Female Golden Flower. It is also called the Palace of the Jade Emperor, each palace being one cun in depth, thus forming the Níhuán Dòngmíng Mirror, which completes the likeness of the Golden Flower Immortal. Once the visualization is complete, then recite the verses of the Stepping Through the Void Scripture.*

*According to Master Dù’s established ritual, the Daoist Master of Exorcism is stationed at the Ghost Gate, facing west. The Grand Master is stationed at the Heavenly Gate, facing east, and each chants while visualizing the nine-colored circular luminosity and swallowing saliva to invoke the secret exorcism spells. From the High Functionary downward, each performs the visualization in turn. Since Master Yáng’s establishment of the Golden Talisman Ritual, the Master of Exorcism has been stationed at the Heavenly Gate. Now, no further changes are made; instead, each follows the prescribed method as recorded in the scripture. The Exorcism Spell reads:*

*'Huángzhōng cè qì zhǎn yāo zōng,*
*Chá zhì qiáng jīng duàn xié wēng.*
*Tàishàng yǒu mìng Tàishàng fáng,*
*jí chào běi dì yì yù gōng.*
*Shòu chéng wēi lìng xuān máo wáng,*
*wǔ qì wěng yù yǔ mìng chōng.*
*Bì cáng yù wén fāng jiù lóng,*
*sān tiān yùn míng liù tiān zhōng.*

*Master Dù said: ‘This spell must be recited silently; do not let your own ears hear it. Violating this brings misfortune—be cautious, be cautious.’*

*From the *Wǔ Fú Rén Niǎo Jīng*, Master Zhào Míngjǔ states: ‘Though divided into nine colors, the essence remains the Primordial Xuan Yuan alone. For the nine colors originate from the Three Qi—Qīng, Huáng, and Bái. If further divided into colors like Zǐ and Bǐ, it becomes overly complex and loses its simplicity. Thus, the Three Qi are divided into Nine Qi for the exorcism.’*

**Explanation of the Exorcism Ritual**
*Master Zhāng Wànfú of the Qingdū School says: ‘Before the Celestial Venerable spoke the scripture, the demon kings of the Three Realms and Ten Thousand Worlds were the leaders of all ghosts, wielding power and poisoning the world, harming living beings. After the Celestial Venerable spoke the scripture, the demons submitted and transformed, guarding the Dao and protecting the law. They restrained the myriad demons, safeguarding those who practice genuine cultivation, thus enabling their ascension into the ranks of immortals. Hence it is said: “Any who dare to obstruct those practicing genuine cultivation shall be slain by the Golden Axe and punished by the Great Queen of the Afterworld.” It is also said: “The Great Demon King, upholding the Ascended Immortal, has fully attained the Dao and now wanders the Three Realms, entering the Golden Gate.” And again: “The Eastern Extermination of demonic essences, the beheading of the Six Ghostly Chiefs—this is the meaning.” Thus, the invocation of demons refers to summoning the demon kings of the Ten Thousand Worlds to uphold the merit of the ritual, to restrain and subdue malevolent ghosts. The *Stepping Through the Void Scripture* states: “The demon kings respectfully receive the ritual’s command, thus able to attend the Celestial Assembly. Both celestial and demonic beings respect and protect, receiving great blessings in this world and the next. The scattered flowers express my vow, the clenched talisman summons the demon kings.”*

**Refined Contemplation for Reciting the Scripture**
*According to Master Dù’s ritual guidance, when reciting the scripture’s verses, one must reach the stage of silent, lawful contemplation. Then, the Master follows the scripture’s instructions, visualizing while reciting the spells. However, the ritual text does not specify the method of visualization; thus, it is recorded here according to Master Lu’s diagrams and instructions.*

**Visualization and Spiritual Preservation from the *Dào Dé Jīng***
*The *Tàijí Yǐnzhù* states: ‘When reading the *Dào Dé Jīng* of the Celestial Venerable, first burn incense, adjust your attire, and bow three times. Visualize the Primordial Daoist Master, the Celestial Venerable Lǎojūn, who in the past was the Primordial Daoist Master of the Riverbank, Yín Xiansheng. Recite the spells while visualizing:*

*"Xuán xuán zhì dào zōng,*
*Shàng dé tǐ hóng yuán.*
*Tiān zhēn suī yuǎn miào,*
*Jìn yuán níhuán jūn.*

*Though distant, the Celestial Venerable is near in essence—*
*the Níhuán Palace, where the Jade Emperor resides,*
*is the brain’s center. Its halls are adorned with seven treasures,*
*its windows and doors self-illuminating.*
*The ever-present purity and tranquility bring forth the True,*
*ascending in the radiance, riding upon the purple clouds.*
*The sun and moon shine left and right,*
*eternal immortality is preserved within.*
*The Seven Ancestors ascend to Heaven,*
*through generations, they guard the Dao of Virtue and Power.*

*Complete the recitation with thirty-six strikes of the teeth,*
*thirty-six swallows of saliva,*
*and visualize the Azure Dragon to your left,*
*the White Tiger to your right,*
*the Vermilion Bird before you,*
*the Dark Tortoise behind,*
*the Eight Trigrams Spirit Tortoise,*
*and thirty-six lions arrayed ahead,*
*the Seven Stars of the Head bowed inward,*
*with the Dipper’s handle pointing forward.*
*The five zàng-organs’ five-colored qi*
*cover your body like a brocade pattern.*
*The Three-One True Person stands before the scripture,*
*your own Three Teachers arrayed in ten thousand chariots,*
*guarding left and right.*
*Once fully comprehended,*
*then recite the scripture.*

*The *Sìjí Kē* states: ‘When reading the scripture, let your heart and mouth move in harmony, your eyes see nothing else, your mind harbor no other thoughts. Complete each phrase without omitting or rushing the Celestial Venerable’s words—three violations bring blame.’*

*The *Tàijí Yǐnzhù* states: ‘After reciting five hundred words of the scripture, strike the teeth three times, let the tongue moist the upper and lower lips, and swallow saliva three times—this prevents exhaustion.’*

**Visualization and Spiritual Preservation from the *Dù Rén Jīng***
*The scripture states: ‘On the day of practicing the Dao, bathe in fragrant water and purify yourself in seclusion. Facing east, strike the teeth thirty-two times, invoking the thirty-two heavens above. Bow thirty-two times in your heart, swallow saliva thirty-two times. Close your eyes and sit in still contemplation, your body resting within the three-colored clouds of Qīng, Huáng, and Bái. Within and without, all is dense and mysterious. Visualize the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lions, and White Cranes arrayed to your left and right. The sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber within. A circular luminosity forms at the nape, its light reflecting in the ten directions—thus, all is clear and distinct."*

**Secret Incantation:**

*"Thus it is spoken."*

**Explanation of the Method:**
Strike the teeth and bow in heart—
store the thirty-two heavens in the four directions:
the Azure Dragon to the left,
the White Tiger to the right,
the Vermilion Bird before you,
the Dark Tortoise behind.
The White Crane and Lions arrayed in their places.

The sun and moon stand nine *chi* before you,
their light illuminating the ten directions.

Draw *qi* through the nose thirty-two times,
ensuring no sound escapes the ears.
Face east and recite the scripture.

---
**From the *Nán-Běi Dǒu Jīng* (Scripture of the Southern and Northern Dipper):**
**Method of Concentrated Thought and Spirit Preservation**

Face north and sit upright.
Strike the teeth twenty-four times.
In heart, store the Most High Laozi,
the Three Heavenly Masters,
and the True Persons of left and right above.
Bow three times in heart.

Next, store the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper to the right,
the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper to the left.
With sincerity, pray and wish for the Ten Precepts of the Immortal Officials,
the Three Thousand Southern Envoys,
the Seven Thousand Northern Divine Generals,
and the attendants on either side—
all clearly manifest.

Then recite the scripture and chant the incantation:

*"In the late Eastern Han, at the start of the Yongshou era,
the Celestial Master rode a White Crane,
the Most High drove a Dragon Chariot.
Five clouds descended from heaven,
the Celestial Procession arrived in Chengdu.
Earthly gods surged forth with a jade array,
its height exceeding ten *chi*.
The Most High ascended the jade seat,
transmitting the Nine Heavenly Scriptures,
the method of cutting death and prolonging life,
and the Seven Elements governing the world.
The Scripture of Prolonging Life and Saving Others—
the Six Ministries all bear talismans.
Those who practice the Dao and cultivate,
reading this, shall have their calamities removed.
Now I recite the sacred text,
and officials and ministers aid me in secret.
I shall establish the Mysterious Merit,
and through wondrous Dao attain the Void."*

---
**Incantation of the *Dàodé Jīng* (Classic of the Way and Its Power):**

*"The Heavenly Teacher of countless eons,
the Great Sage, the Primordial Lord,
once in the Palace of Great Clarity,
wrote five thousand characters.
Shun, the filial son of Yu,
transmitted it to the Most High,
its secrets not revealed to the world,
its mysteries passed down without end.
In the late Zhou, during King Zhao’s reign,
he rode the winds on a purple cloud,
Yin Xi guarded the Gloomy Pass,
gazing to welcome the flying wheel.
Crossing the Western Sands, the Most High arrived at the Pass,
and at noon again transmitted the *Dàodé Jīng*.
Its meaning encompasses all that is great and small,
nothing too vast or minute to discuss.
Now I expound the True Scriptures,
unfolding the roots of heaven and earth.
I wish to follow the Supreme Dao,
that my family and nation may share its blessings.
May the Emperor-King preserve his ten thousand years,
ultimately ascending to the Celestial Gate."*

---
**Incantation of the *Dù Rén Jīng* (Scripture of Saving Others):**

*"Blessed be the Primordial Lord,
who in the Beginning of Azure Heaven
suspended pearls like millet grains,
drawing ten-directional immortals.
He taught the Dao to save others,
the precious chapter named *Dòng Xuán* (Mysterious and Profound).
The Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,
their inner names and hidden titles complete.
The Great Demons of the Three Realms,
sing only hollow verses.
The Great Brahman’s hidden speech,
the Sovereign’s own compilation.
The High True Ones descended to rescue,
transmitting the method of saving fateful souls.
For five eons, the teachings spread far,
those saved without number.
Now I face east and recite,
wishing to match the heavens in years.
May the Emperor-King preserve his peace and stability,
and the Nine Ancestors all ascend as immortals.
When merit is complete and virtue fulfilled,
I shall rise on clouds and mist."*

---
**Incantation of the *Shēng Shén Jīng* (Scripture of Nourishing the Spirit):**

*"Blessed be the Primordial Lord,
reclining in the Yellow Palace.
Qi Yi cultivated the Great Primordial,
refining the void and blending the pure.
He flew from heaven to pay homage,
laying out the end of the eon.
It is fitting to practice the Great Method,
broadly saving the ignorant and deluded.
The Heavenly Sage rescues the wise and foolish,
the jade case opens with clarity.
He revealed the *Shēng Shén* Chapter,
unfolding the Nine *Qi* Principles.
With focused heart, I bow and recite,
those saved without end.
Now I unfold the Cloud Brocade,
completing the Nine Transformations of humanity.
When merit is complete and virtue fulfilled,
I shall ride the Light and the Cloud Dragon."*

**Upon completion of the ritual:**
Concentrated thought and spirit preservation.
Strike the teeth twenty-four times.
Before opening your eyes, first store the Three Pure Ones at the crown,
the assemblies of the *Dàodé* honored ones gathered before you.
The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Tortoise
stand to your left, right, front, and back.
Your body grows over ten *chi* in length,
your form radiant as golden flowers.
The crimson gate of your door opens at the crown.
True officials, soldiers, and ministers
all emerge from the crown.
The Tiger General stands at the nose,
the Heavenly Laborers at the shoulders,
the Wolf Officials at the neck,
the Directing Messengers at the cheeks,
the Heavenly Steeds at the arms,
the Armored Soldiers at the fingertips,
the Deliberate Cavalry and Hooked Riders in the abdomen,
the Three Generals in the heart,
the Science Carriages and Red Talismans at the navel,
the Three Officials and Secretaries in the stomach,
the *Gāngfēng* Cavalry stationed at the knees,
the Relay Horses bearing dispatches at the calves,
the *Qi*-Collecting Officials along the twenty-four vertebrae,
the Green-Robed Village Lords before you.
The Directing Functionaries hold the tablets and staves—
each clearly manifest.
Then open your eyes and conclude the ritual.
Strike the teeth three times,
swallow saliva three times.
Proclaim the chapter,
recite the *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity) text.

From *Yīn Zhēn Rén’s* *Wèn Kē Jīng* (Scripture of Questioning the Laws)
and the Celestial Master’s *Wèn Fǎ Jīng* (Scripture of Questioning the Dao):
The Celestial Master told the Most High:
*"There are those who read the *Tàiqīng* first, then report it;
or report it first, then read the *Tàiqīng*;
or read the *Tàiqīng* characters first, then report, then state their surname;
or break off and read the *Tàiqīng* last.
These differ—what is the correct method?"*

The Most High said:
*"When reporting is complete, then state your surname,
then read the *Tàiqīng*, then the year number,
each separated by three lines—
this is the unchanging method of writing the chapter.
But when proclaiming aloud,
reporting is complete, then kneel deeply and grasp the extreme,
first read the *Tàiqīng*, speaking the fine characters softly.
Do not let the voice rise sharply—
do not cough or swallow saliva.
Recite in one breath, then state your surname,
then the year number—
this is the Heavenly Emperor’s complete method."*

---
**Zhào Míngjǔ’s Master’s Method of Spreading *Qi* and Chanting the Seal:**

*"The Three *Qi* originally merge to form the body,
the Primordial Sovereign’s features now clear.
Within lies the Dao of the Mysterious and the Void,
but fear the times may lack precision in learning."*

**Seal of the Seven Elements, the Leader, the Dipper, and the True Form Talisman:**

*"The chapter’s seals and all ritual diagrams
are unseen in the scriptures—
such as the *Bǎozhāng Lì* of the Red Pine Child,
the talismans of Broad Achievement Master,
and the *Jīn Guàn* ritual diagrams—
none are recorded."*

*"One must inquire of the venerable past masters and say: 'In my youth, I still saw my predecessors, at the moment, use a red brush to inscribe this talisman upon the ritual diagrams, its height and depth forming the **Northern Dipper** constellation. Truly, this was meant to guard and protect the ritual diagrams, ensuring their efficacy must reach its fullest extent.

'Later, upon examining the **Broad Achievement Master’s Purple Court Ritual** of the Northern Obscurity, I saw the **Seven Elements Seal** inscribed upon yellow silk, wrapped around the words of the ritual, and sealed within the case. Only then did I believe the words of the venerable past masters were not false.

'With reverence, I publish this method, and further explain their reasoning: 'Nowadays, these talismans are made as seals, but this is a later private interpretation. The **True Form Talisman** of the **Heavenly Emperor’s Supreme Seal**—I bow twice to report this. Bow twice, then state your name: **"Uppermost Way" (太清上) and "Lowest Way" (太清下)**, the **True Form Talisman** of the **Heavenly Sovereign (太歲)**, and the **Three Generals Seal** are inscribed upon the right side of the ritual case.

'The **Six Celestial Stems Seal** of **Yin-Yang**—two talismans, one for each—from **Jiazi (甲子)** to **Yihou (乙丑)**, each having its own seal. The lower one must always conclude with the **Yin Seal** and the **Yang Seal**. **Jiazi** represents **Yang**, **Yihou** represents **Yin**; **Yang** governs the **Yang Realm**, **Yin** governs the **Yin Realm**.

'Now, when spreading the talisman, this involves matters of the **Yang Realm**, so one must use the **Yang Seal**. Yet, in common practice, many inscribe the **Yin Seal** upon the case and use both talismans together, with incantations beneath them. The **Yang Seal** reads:

*'**Midheaven Great Sage** (中天大聖), **Flying Heaven Swift** (飛天捷疾), seizes and apprehends the **Yang Jade Realm’s** ghosts—those within the **Yang Realm** and the lower **Yin-Yang Void**—and delivers them to the **Northern Prison of Heaven One** (天一北獄), where they are judged according to the **Dharma Law** (律). The **Tang Gezhou Generals** (唐葛周將軍) and the **True Martial General** (真武將軍) await with drawn swords.'

The **Yin Seal** reads:

*'**Midheaven Great Sage** (中天大聖), **Flying Heaven Swift** (飛天捷疾), seizes and apprehends the **Yin Jade Realm’s** ghosts—those within the **Yin Realm** and the five **Void Directions** (五方無道之鬼)—and delivers them to the **Northern Prison of Heaven One** (天一北獄), where they are judged according to the **Dharma Law** (律). The **Tang Gezhou Generals** (唐葛周將軍) and the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water** (天地水三官) come to their aid.

'The **Dissolving Form Talisman** follows the same structure as above: **"Midheaven Great Sage" (中天大聖), "Flying Heaven Swift" (飛天捷疾), seizing and apprehending the **Yang Jade Realm’s** ghosts—those within the **Yang Realm** and the **Yin-Yang Void**—as the **True Martial General** (真武將軍) awaits with drawn swords, up to the **Tang Gezhou Generals** (唐葛周將軍). The **Yin Seal** follows this pattern accordingly.

'The **Supine Talisman** and the **Stepfighting Dipper Diagram** (伏章步斗圖) are also included."*

At this juncture, the **Celestial Rotation** (乾旋) is invoked within the **Fighting Man** (人斗) through the **Supine Talisman** (伏章) and the **Stepfighting Dipper Diagram** (步斗歌):

*"Kàn* (坎) and *Gèn* (艮) move in paired single steps, crossing *Qián* (乾);
*Zhèn* (震) advances in double ranks, as does *Duì* (兑) likewise.
*Kūn* (坤) follows *Lí* (离) in paired single steps, while *Xùn* (巽) turns—
When the **Three Stars** (三台) return, they ascend to **Heaven** (朝天).

The **Preserved Talisman** (存章) reflects the **Divine Method** (神法), as recorded in **Master Sun’s** teachings within his collection.

This is the **Most High’s** (太上) hidden secret—though preserved in written scrolls, the **heart-method** (心法) is a self-realized mystery, beyond words.

Since **Master Sun** has already revealed it, yet instructed that my disciples should guard this doctrine, lest it be carelessly disclosed to others, I refrain from further engraving or mass reproduction, lest the **Heavenly Secrets** (天秘) be widely leaked. Future seekers who pay heed should consult **Master Sun’s** original text and inquire into its hidden meanings from those of earlier attainment.

This is the **Dao Gate’s** (道門) universal teaching, which must be found within the **Ninth Volume** (集卷之九) of its compilation.
