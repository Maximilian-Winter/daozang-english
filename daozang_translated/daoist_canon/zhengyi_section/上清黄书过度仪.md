**The Yellow Book of Shangqing Rites for Crossing Over**

When disciples receive the Dao under a master’s guidance, they must not exceed twenty years of age for the Crossing Over; if they receive the Dao beyond twenty, it is considered an overstepping, and they must bathe, observe prohibitions, and burn incense. Upon entering the oratory (*jing*), they must first report to the master before proceeding. Upon entering and exiting, they bow to the oratory and express gratitude.

**Entering the Oratory**
For the first entry into the oratory, the yang disciple stands at the *yin* position (north), and the yin disciple stands at the *shen* position (west). The one seeking the Crossing Over kneels and says: *"I, a mortal of flesh, am fortunate beyond a thousand generations to have been touched by the transformative power of the Dao. Having sought the Dharma for some time yet remaining uninitiated into the Crossing Over, I bow my head in reverence and take refuge, begging for the gift of life."* They then bow twice.

The master responds: *"Today is auspicious; it is fitting to serve as your bridge."*

The seeker repeats: *"I humbly pray for its fulfillment."*

The master replies: *"I shall make the announcement."* The disciple, overwhelmed by the grace received, bows twice more to the master, who then takes their hand and leads them to face east.

**Visualizing the Officials and Soldiers**
Both stand facing east, the yang on the left and the yin on the right, hands clasped together. The yang disciple interlocks fingers, with the second finger inserted between the yin disciple’s second and third fingers. Each sounds the drum twelve times in their mind, visualizing the Registrar Officials and Envoys, Generals, and Soldiers from the talismans they wear. These figures are adorned in resplendent robes, arrayed in ranks, guarding the disciples front and back, left and right. They are to summon the life-generating *qi* of the four directions to dispel calamities and disperse misfortune, reporting and distinguishing matters with clarity.

This visualization is performed once and then concluded.

**Visualizing the White Qi**
Each visualizes a white *qi* from the cinnabar field (*dantian*), as large as a six-inch mirror, emerging between the eyebrows. It gradually expands, radiating brilliance that illuminates the head above and showers the body below, penetrating to reveal the five viscera, six bowels, nine palaces, twelve chambers, four limbs, five constituents, joints, sinews, vessels, pores, and defensive and constructive *qi*—both exterior and interior—all becoming luminously clear.

This visualization is performed once and then concluded.

**Visualizing the Royal Qi**
Each visualizes the royal *qi* according to the season:
- In spring, visualize the green *qi* of the east nourishing the body, accompanied by red *qi*.
- In summer, visualize the red *qi* of the south, accompanied by yellow *qi*.
- In autumn, visualize the white *qi* of the west, accompanied by black *qi*.
- In winter, visualize the black *qi* of the north, accompanied by green *qi*.
- During the four seasons, visualize the yellow *qi* of the center, accompanied by white *qi*.

Tilt the head back to inhale the *qi* through the nose, then lower the head to swallow it, guiding it down to the cinnabar field. From there, it ascends to the Kunlun (head). This is done three times, with three swallowings, and then concluded.

**Swallowing the Three Palaces**
Each visualizes the life-generating *qi* of the Three Origins descending in pure whiteness, enveloping the body. Tilting the head back, they inhale the life-generating *qi* through the nose and say: *"Palace of Heavenly One, may the life-generating *qi* come to enliven me."* Lowering the head, they swallow it, filling the lower cinnabar field, then guiding it upward to the Mud Pill (head). Following the method of Heaven, Earth, and Water, they recite the incantation and swallow. Tilting the head back again, they inhale the life-generating *qi* of the Three Palaces—Heaven, Earth, and Water—through the nose, saying: *"May the life-generating *qi* of the Three Palaces come together to enliven my body."* Lowering the head, they swallow it, filling the lower cinnabar field, then guiding it upward to the Mud Pill. The life-generating *qi* of the Three Palaces, vast and pure white, covers the body and permeates the five viscera, six bowels, and the twelve branches and trunks.

This visualization is performed once and then concluded.

**Initiating the Rite**

The Sixth Rite proceeds with all facing east in a long kneel, each sounding the drum twelve times. The functionary of my body, the *li* officials, emerge—from the Upper Transcendent and Upper Numinous Bureaus—along with the direct envoys of the Orthodox Unity, the *yin-yang* life-generating *qi*, the functionaries for healing maladies, the left and right officials, and the *yin-yang* divine *yu* scribes, two in number. Those who emerge don their solemn attire and stand before and behind me, all receiving the words from my mouth. They are to distinguish and relay the following to the relevant commanderies, counties, townships, and hamlets:

The Central Perfected Officials infuse *qi* and summon all the Lords, Generals, and *li* officials. The Four Beginnings stand vigilant, monitoring the four directions. All officials, lords, and generals who preside over the summons—with reverence, I humbly address:

The Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Most High Mysterious Elder, the Lords, Generals, and *li* officials of the Three *Qi*;
The Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, and all Lords, Generals, and *li* officials;

All Lords, Generals, and *li* officials;
The Perfected Lords and Generals;
The Lords and Generals of Supreme Harmony;
The Lords and Generals of the Yellow Writ and the Contract of the Abdominal Eye;
The Nine *Qi* Elders and the Lords and Generals of Summons;
The Lords and Generals of *Yin-Yang* Life-Generating *Qi* and Dao Transmission;
The Central Womb Perfected and the Lords and Generals of Preparation;
The Central Womb Red-and-White and the Lords and Generals of Discharge;
The Central Yellow *Wu-Ji* and the Lords and Generals of the Hundred Joints;
The *Yin-Yang* Functionaries and the Lords and Generals of Transformation;
The *Yin-Yang* Perfected *Qi* and the Lords and Generals of Transcendent Dao;
The Lords and Generals of Internal and External Supervision and Enlightenment;
The Lords and Generals of Disaster Dispersion, Calamity Dissolution, and Tribulation Resolution;

The Lords and Generals of the Three Officials—Heaven, Earth, and Water—summoning all officials;
The Lords and Generals of this hamlet and encampment, and the transforming spirits within;
The Lords and Generals of the One Hundred Twenty *Qi* and the Former *Qi*;
The Lords and Generals of Ghosts and Bandits.

I, [Name], prostrate in awe and trepidation, declare: I, in my foolishness and ignorance, delight in the Dao and cherish life. Previously, under the guidance of Master [Name], Libationer of *Qi* Cultivation and Perfected One, I received the essential teachings and the Eightfold Great Salvation Method. Bound by duty, I now uphold them.

There is a man/woman of [Commandery], [County], [Township], [Hamlet], named [Name], aged [Age] years, who delights in the Dao and aspires to transcendence. They have come before me seeking passage and salvation, vowing to practice the *yin-yang*, Five Phases, and Three *Qi*. Beginning with the Middle Prime’s first generation, then the Upper Prime’s first generation, and the Lower Prime’s first generation, the Three *Qi* intertwine to form the Dao.

I humbly beseech the Lords and *li* officials of Internal and External Supervision and Enlightenment, the Lords and *li* officials of Spirit Restoration and *Qi* Replenishment, the Lords and Generals of the Encampment’s Transforming Spirits, and the Lords and Generals of the Three Officials—Heaven, Earth, and Water—to act on my behalf and [Name]’s, absolving us of the Three Officials’ judgments, expunging our names from the Registers of Death, and inscribing them in the Register of Long Life under the King. May we be counted among the Seed People.

May my spirit and that of [Name] be steadfast and our life-generating *qi* firm, suffusing our four limbs and five viscera, free from harm. May our desires be fulfilled, our passages secured, our slander silenced, our tasks completed, and our words efficacious. May we not betray the trust placed in us.

I, [Name], prostrate in utmost reverence, kowtow twice and humbly submit this petition, awaiting your response and compliance.

[Clan affiliation to be specified]
[Supreme Purity to be invoked]

May the Year Star [to be specified] and the Earthly Net—on the seventh traversal of the Earthly Net’s three crossings, the first crossing to the left, the Supreme Center crossing to the right, the Mysterious Elder and the Most High joining hands—O Merciful Father and Holy Mother, release us from the snares, remove our names from the Registers of Death, and inscribe them in the Register of Life.

May the Heavenly Net—on the threefold release of the Heavenly Net, first in the Supreme Center to the right of the Mysterious Elder, then the Most High facing and joining hands—he who gave me life be Jiazi, Master Wang Wenqing, Father Kang; she who nurtured me be Jiawu, Master Wei Shangqing, Mother Niu, who bore me and sustained me, their deeds rooted in the Great Dao, together with my parents.

For the Eighth Rite, the Homage to the Four Venerables: cross both hands and raise them toward the *yin* direction, bow once, then kneel in full prostration. Declare: “Jiayin, Radiant Writ of the Dao, the Dao-Father praises and extends his grace, appointing [Name] as your servant, to dispel the great calamities of the world.” The Master says: “Let there be a man or woman born [Name], who through your servant seeks passage and deliverance.”

The disciple says: “Your servant now through Master [Name] seeks passage, that we may together uphold and practice the Dao and its virtue, beseeching harmony in the hidden viscera and the free flow of life-generating *qi* within your servant’s body. May the spirit be steadfast and firm, each free from harm.” Then turn toward the *shen* direction and declare: “Jiashen, Hu Wen, the Long Dao, the Mother who subdues the rebellious and restrains the violent—dispel for your servant the eight disasters of the eight directions on earth.”

Then turn toward the *zi* direction and declare: “Jiazi, Wang Wenqing, Master Father Kang of the Xia Hall—dispel for your servant the great calamities of the world.”

Then turn toward the *wu* direction and declare: “Jiawu, Wei Shangqing, Master Mother Niu—dispel for your servant the eight disasters of the eight directions on earth.”

The incantation follows the same form as that for the *yin* direction, once only.

For the Ninth Rite, Visualization: sit facing the *yang-yin* direction, with the *yin-shen* direction above. Those seeking deliverance place their knees outward, hands joined in the *yin* position and drawn back, palms covering the knees in the *yang* position, fingers interlaced and covering. Tap the teeth twelve times. Visualize the Supreme Black, the True Azure *qi* of the Mysterious Elder; the True Yellow *qi* of the Most High; the True White and the Three Blacks, all merging into a single state of primordial chaos, resembling a fledgling parrot, its five colors blending into yellow, descending into the Cinnabar Field.

Thus, once only.

The disciple responds: “Your disciple now entreats Master So-and-so for deliverance, that we may together practice the Dao and its virtue, entreating the harmony of *yin* and *yang*, that the *qi* of life may flow through this disciple’s body, that spirit and essence may be concentrated and firm, each free from harm. May the name be struck from the register of death and inscribed in the Jade Record of Longevity, that the nine calamities be transcended, and this disciple be made a seed-person of future generations.”

Direct left three times, declaring "Left, the Supreme"; direct right three times, declaring "Right, the Mysterious Elder"; direct upward three times, declaring "Center, the Supreme." Declare: "Your servant, so-and-so Jia, humbly seeks passage and transcendence, together upholding the Dao and virtue, beseeching longevity and enduring vision, to become one of the seed people." Direct the center three times, declaring: "Left, the Supreme; right, the Mysterious Elder; the Supreme’s Three Qi together generate your servant’s body, merging into one, named Peach Health, dwelling at the Northern Culmen, called the Cinnabar Child. Clothed in five colors, wearing a great red cap, upon a golden bed and jade couch, with five-colored railings, a canopy of pearls and jade, directly aligned with the Mingmen. Divine males and jade maidens attend on either side. Yang Qi revolves left, yin Qi spirals right, ascending to the Great Clarity, descending to the lowest depths, constantly roaming among the Nine Palaces, the five viscera, and the six bowels. Leading and recording the host of spirits, calling names by the register, they must not flee. Long abide within my body, ascending with me as immortals." Inhale the Qi of life through the nose three times, swallow the yang seven, nine, and eleven times. Declare: "The Dao of heaven proceeds." Declare: "The Dao of earth proceeds." Then enter the Gate of Life, half your head within. Again recite: "Willow Lord, Nü Lord, the myriad spirits live. I desire to shake heaven and move earth; let the Five Lords each attend carefully." Yi incantation: "Willow Lord, Nü Lord, Dantian Palace, I desire to move earth and shake heaven; let the five spirits within my body each firmly advance to the abyss’s depths." Close the mouth, inhale the Qi of life through the nose, exhale through the mouth, click the teeth three times, declaring: "Nine and one are born within." Slightly retreat, half a head’s distance. Jia first proceeds, beginning the Qi of life.

The lung is the Canopy Palace, the heart is the Crimson Palace, the liver is the Purple Tenuity Palace, the gallbladder is the Longevity Palace, the spleen is the Hall of Light Palace, the stomach is the Grand Granary Palace, the kidneys are the Twin Envoys. The Five Cities and Twelve Towers, ever accompanying the Red Child, each returns to my palace chambers.

**Royal Qi**
Nineteenth: Rub both hands together until warm, then massage the face and body. In spring, visualize the liver as the Purple Tenuity Palace, its color azure, moist and radiant. Azure qi emerges from the nose, large as a nine-inch mirror, gradually expanding to cover the face, the entire body suffused with azure. In summer, visualize the heart as the Crimson Palace, its color red, moist and radiant. Red qi emerges from the nose, large as an eight-inch mirror, gradually expanding to cover the face, the entire body suffused with red.

Then, with the right hand, massage between the breasts, then move the hand downward three times to massage the left and right sides of the cinnabar field, then further downward. Massage below the navel without fixed count. Cross the hands over the head, draw in qi from above, guiding it upward from both feet along the two meridians to the Pass of Origin, then along the three paths of the spine. Yin: right azure, left white, center yellow. Yang: left azure, right white, center yellow. Directly enter the Mud Pill Palace, then reverse the flow. Draw the qi downward: Yin: left azure, right white, center yellow. Yang: right azure, left white, center yellow. From the root of the hair and forehead, along the brows and face, descend through the mouth, nose, and throat, passing through the five viscera down to the feet and ten toes, then return upward as before. Perform three ascents and three descents, returning to store the qi in the lower cinnabar field.

Yin: bend the right foot beneath the left foot, grasp the right big toe with the left hand and pull. Then turn to the right, returning to the original position with feet apart.

Yang: first place the right foot against Yin, the left foot against Yin. Then place the right foot against Yang, the left foot against Yang. Again, place the right foot against Yin, the left foot against Yin. Then place the right foot against Yang, the left foot against Yang. With each movement, recite: *"Left, the Utmost Supreme; right, the Mysterious Elder Supreme."* Perform three cycles of advance and return, then stop.

**Severing Death**
Yang: Assume the crane-knee posture. With both hands, stroke from the forehead upward to the feet, then grasp the big toes while seated. Stroke both knees once—this is called "severing the path of death."

Yin: Face the origin of the Primordial Yang. With both hands, gather from the cinnabar field through the Gate of Life, returning to the Jade Father. Press the thumbs and the base of the palms against the face, raise the hands high above the head, then gaze downward toward the Jade Chamber. Lie on the back, slightly raise the head, and gaze toward the origin of the Primordial Yang soaring in the heavens. Soar in the heavens, tread upon the earth, then descend like a butterfly’s wings.

Yang: Press both hands against the yellow earth—this is called "treading upon the earth." Rise from the long kneel, raise the hands high above the head—this is called "soaring in the heavens." Then lower the hands behind—this is called "descending like a butterfly’s wings."

Yang: Cross the left hand over Yin, while the right hand performs the Dragon’s Inversion three times, passing over the head. Men turn left, women turn right, then return to face each other.

Next, traverse the Earthly Net as before. First recite: *"Left, the Utmost Supreme,"* then: *"Right, the Mysterious Elder,"* and finally: *"Supreme."* *"Compassionate Father, Holy Mother, unbind the nets and snares, remove my name from the register of death, inscribe it in the record of life."* Next, release the nets again. First: *"Left, the Utmost Supreme,"* then: *"Right, the Mysterious Elder,"* and finally: *"Supreme."*

*"He who gave me life is Jiazi, Royal Wencheng. My master-father is Kang. He who nurtured me is Jiawu, Minister Wei. My master-mother is Niu. He who gave me life and sustained me serves the Great Dao, alongside my parents."*

**Treading the Hours**
Tread the twelve hours, crossing Yang. Place the left foot on Yin, the right foot in the center. Recite: *"Jia-Yin, Dao Father, may you, as your servant, dispel the disasters of the four directions."* Place the right foot on Shen, the left foot in the center. Recite: *"Jia-Shen, Dao Mother, may you, as your servant, disperse the calamities of the four directions."* Yang next treads Mao, Yin next treads Wei, reciting as before. Alternate Zi and Hai, completing a cycle with Yin and Shen. With each cycle, recite: *"He who gave me life is my master-father Kang; she who nurtured me is my master-mother Niu. He who gave me life and sustained me serves the Great Dao, alongside my parents."* Perform three cycles, then stop.

**Thanksgiving for Life**

Next, give thanks for life, facing the *yin* direction toward *Mao*. Recite: *"Jia-Yin, Dao Father, the Ten Masters declare: Before you stands a man/woman born as [personal name], who through your servant [disciple’s name] begs for passage and transcendence."* The disciple recites: *"Your servant, through Master [name], begs for mutual passage and transcendence."* Together, we uphold the Dao and its virtue, receiving grace as wished, each spared from harm—grateful to the Dao Father. *"May the Ten Masters, as your servant, dispel the disasters of the four directions."* Bow twice. Next, for *Yi-Mao*, recite the Dao Father’s covenant, cycling through the twelve hours as with *Yin*.

**Declaring Merit**

Next, declare merit, all facing east with hands clasped, kneeling upright. Sound the drum twelve times.

*"Your servant humbly petitions the Merit-Recording Couriers, the Yin-Yang Deities of Merit, the Generals and Officers of the Qi of Life, the True Persons of the Central Womb, the Crimson and White Generals and Officers, the Yellow-Writ Covenant Generals and Officers of the Abdominal Eyes, the True Officials of this domain who infuse qi, the Overseers and Examiners who summon all officials, generals, and officers—those under the Three Masters: the Celestial Master, the Lineage Master, and the Female Master—alongside the Generals and Officers of the Qi of Life, the Generals and Officers of the Dao of Passage through Yin and Yang, the Nine Qi Venerable who commands summons, the Generals and Officers of the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water who examine and summon, and the Generals and Officers who dispel disasters, disperse calamities, and resolve adversities.*

*With trepidation, your servant [name] declares: Though dull-witted, I delight in the Dao and cherish life. As my master instructed, I now petition on behalf of [prefecture, county, village, and personal name], a man/woman who, through your servant, begs for passage and transcendence. Your servant, through Master [name], likewise begs for mutual passage and transcendence. In strict accordance with the master’s teachings, together with [name], we uphold the Dao and its virtue, embracing the transformations of Three, Five, Seven, and Nine, the bestowals of Yin and Yang, and the mutual passage of man and woman. By grace, our wishes are fulfilled, our spirits steadfast and whole, both containing life within, each spared from harm.*

*We reverently summon the Yin-Yang Merit-Recording Couriers and the Generals, Officers, and soldiers of the Qi of Life to ascend to the Three Celestial Bureaus, where the central offices shall record and transmit our merits, distinguishing and conveying them as per the ancient rites of the Celestial Bureaus, ensuring no intent is lost. Thus, our toils are proclaimed, and our merit duly received. May all return to their duties, safeguarding as before. We pray that your servants may enjoy long life and enduring vision, transcend disasters and adversities, have our names stricken from the ledgers of death, and be inscribed in the Jade Register of life, becoming exemplars among future generations as proof of this covenant."*

*[Personal name] and [disciple’s name], with utmost reverence and awe, kowtow twice in submission."*

*[Lineage affiliation to be recited]*
*[Celestial clarity to be recited]*

The Year-Star [recited as appropriate]. Next, the officiating officer declares: "We, your servants, dispatch the contract decrees to all the officials, the Six Jia spirits, and the various deities, commanding them to perform their Way-affairs for the day and return to the Central Palace, whereupon we knock the teeth thrice and swallow the qi. We now offer incense thrice in accordance with the ritual, focusing our intent to petition the master, requesting that those born under the Jia among men and women be allowed to seek passage and transcendence through us. The disciples state: 'We, your servants, beseech Master So-and-so to grant us mutual passage and transcendence.' Together, we uphold the Dao and its virtue, harmonizing the Three Qi, and pray for immortality and freedom from death. May this merit and power flow back to us, your servants—returning to the body upon the body’s end, to the spirit upon the spirit’s end, and to the life upon the life’s end, merging with the Great Dao."

"We, your servants, prostrate ourselves body and head to the earth, surrendering to the Three Honored Ones. May this merit and power flow back to us, your servants, so that in this body we may study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and achieve immortality, reverse aging and restore youth, enjoy boundless longevity, ascend into the formless, and unite with the Dao."

[Recite the incantation of the time of tranquility:]
"One Lord stands before me,
Two Lords stand behind me.
They break and dispel the disasters of the four directions for me,
Subduing all adversities.
With both hands, we break through and exit the door."

[Declare the merit accomplished.]

The officiating officer respectfully states in accordance with the document: "We, your servants, though dull-witted and beset by the Six Obstructions, delight in the safeguarding of long life. We reverently uphold the essential words of the true scriptures and adhere to the great methods of the Yellow Writ Contract Decrees. We are duty-bound to practice them faithfully. Here, in such-and-such commandery, county, village, and hamlet, a man or woman named So-and-so, aged such-and-such years, who delights in the Dao and rejoices in immortality, has come before us on this day and hour to seek passage and transcendence, upholding the Dao and its virtue, harmonizing the qi of Three, Five, Seven, Nine, Two, Four, Six, Eight, and the Three Threes. By grace, their wishes are fulfilled, their spirits steadfast and secure, each free from harm. In accordance with the master’s teachings, we submit a memorial, praying that the officials of the Three Offices within our bodies be summoned to examine and convene; that the Yellow Writ Contract Decree Generals of the Abdominal Eyes, the Generals of the Central Yellow Wu-Ji and the Hundred Nodes, the True One Generals, the Generals of Supreme Harmony, the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Human Standards, the Three Pennants and Established Standards, the Four Seasons and Eight Nodes, the Five Agents in harmony, the Three and Five Merit Officers and the Generals of the Dipper’s Handle, the Central Womb Realized Ones and the Generals of Red and White Surge and White Discharge, the Generals of the Nine Qi Venerable One and the Summoning Officers—all those who serve in such-and-such commandery, county, village, and hamlet, and all the qi-officials and generals—be recorded for three hundred merits; that the generals and officers be credited with two hundred merits; and that the soldiers be recorded for fifty merits. May they ascend to the Central Palace and the Second Palace to receive, record, and register their duties, their ranks increased accordingly, their regular allotments augmented, and none left resentful."

"We, your servants, have a thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults, all of which we pray may be pardoned. May the qi of life of yin and yang flow freely within us and within So-and-so, harmonizing the five viscera and six bowels, the twelve palaces, strengthening sinews and bones, moistening countenance and complexion. May we traverse the world unhindered, our undertakings accomplished under heaven and earth. We beseech that we may become seed-people for future generations, that evil and rebellion be eradicated, and that all slander, legal writs, and adversities be subdued as proof of this covenant."

"With compassion, O Merciful Father and Holy Mother, we humbly seek passage and transcendence, repenting of our transgressions and declaring our merits. We submit this central memorial, which ascends to the Three Celestial Bureaus of the Upper Heavens."

The Rite of Passage by the Yellow Writ of the Highest Clarity is thus concluded.
