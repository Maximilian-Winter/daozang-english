**The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Transforming Form, Concealing Radiance, Ascending, and Preserving Immortality**

The Central Yellow Venerable Lord received from the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity the *Scripture of Supreme Clarity on Transforming Form, Concealing Radiance, and Ascending to the Jade Clarity*, wherein one preserves the Eight Radiant Forms to animate the body, contemplates the Five Clouds to elevate the form, commands the Purple Transcendence to summon the void, and wields the Blazing Light to invoke the numinous. One reverses the Three Mornings to infuse the mysterious, draws the primordial essence of the Seven Stars, establishes the Moon Mechanism within the chamber, and accumulates spiritual resonance in the silent courtyard.

Since the golden scriptures of the Eastern Florescence and the mysterious registers of jade names were bestowed, none have been permitted to unfold and behold the chapters of the Supreme Thearch.

For all who cultivate the Dao of concealing radiance: on each of the Eight Seasonal Festivals, when the Eight Thearchs convene in celestial assembly, bathe in orchid incense, purify the secluded chamber, enter the room in stillness, and sit in meditation. With eyes closed, visualize and contemplate the Azure Thearch of the Subtle and Vast, whose name is recorded as Fengzi. He wears the Golden Flower of the Great Mystery and the True Crown, dons a cloud-luminous brocade robe, and bears the Nine Brilliances’ Radiant Yang Rosy Dawn Talisman. He rides the Eight Simplicities’ Purple Cloud Chariot of One Radiance, bestowing upon me the Nine Brilliances’ Great Morning Concealment Talisman. As cloud qi envelops my crown, my body senses ascent with the radiance. Strike the teeth twenty-four times and swallow qi eight times to conclude.

Next, visualize the Vermilion Thearch of the Central Subtle, whose taboo name is Ding Guangyan. He wears the Two Simplicities’ Treasure Unity Crown, a cloud-luminous brocade robe, and the Four Brightnesses’ Vermilion and Azure Talisman of the Primordial Morning. He rides the Seven Simplicities’ Crimson Cloud Chariot of Two Radiance, bestowing upon me the Cloud-Observing Primordial Morning Concealment Talisman. As cloud qi envelops my crown, my body senses ascent with the radiance. Strike the teeth nine times and swallow qi nine times to conclude.

Next, visualize the White Thearch of the Purple Tenuity, whose taboo name is Liang Yuanshi. He wears the Hibiscus Crown, a dark numinous brocade robe, and the Comprehensive Morning’s Luminous Support Talisman. He rides the Six Simplicities’ Red Cloud Chariot of Three Radiance, bestowing upon me the Comprehensive Morning’s Nine Ultimates Concealment Talisman. As cloud qi envelops my crown, my body senses ascent with the radiance. Strike the teeth eleven times and swallow qi six times to conclude.

Next, visualize the Black Thearch of the Mysterious Subtle, whose taboo name is Qi Yuanxuan. He wears the Nine Primordials’ Guest Crown, a dark cloud brocade robe, and the Overlapping Brilliance’s Numinous Flute Phoenix Talisman. He rides the Five Simplicities’ Azure Cloud Chariot of Four Radiance, bestowing upon me the Overlapping Brilliance’s Rotating Root Concealment Talisman. As cloud qi envelops my crown, my body senses ascent with the radiance. Strike the teeth nine times and swallow qi five times to conclude.

Next, visualize the Supreme Thearch of the Origin Subtle, whose taboo name is Jiekongzi. He wears the Mysterious Light Guest Crown, a cloud-luminous brocade robe, and the Mysterious Radiance’s Central Primordial Eight Directions Jade Gate Talisman. He rides the Four Simplicities’ Yellow Cloud Chariot of Five Radiance, bestowing upon me the Mysterious Radiance’s Morning Equilibrium Concealment Talisman. As cloud qi envelops my crown, my body senses ascent with the radiance. Strike the teeth twelve times and swallow qi four times to conclude.

Next, visualize the Central Thearch of the Numinous Subtle, whose taboo name is Kang Ewu. He wears the Far-Wandering Crown, a green brocade patterned robe, and the Converging Brilliance’s Mysterious Rosy Dawn Talisman. He rides the Three Simplicities’ Green Cloud Chariot of Six Radiance, bestowing upon me the Converging Brilliance’s Morning Mandate Concealment Talisman. As cloud qi envelops my crown, my body senses ascent with the radiance. Strike the teeth twelve times and swallow qi three times to conclude.

Next, visualize the Lower Thearch of the Proclaiming Subtle, whose taboo name is Hongfuzi. He wears the Three Treasures Divine Crown, a plain brocade patterned robe, and the Harmonizing Brilliance’s Preserving Luminance Talisman. He rides the Two Simplicities’ Purple Cloud Chariot of Seven Radiance, bestowing upon me the Harmonizing Brilliance’s Mysterious Morning Concealment Talisman. As cloud qi envelops my crown, my body senses ascent with the radiance. Strike the teeth nine times and swallow qi twice to conclude.

Next, visualize the Perfected Thearch of the Cavernous Subtle, whose taboo name is Sidengshu. He wears the Flying Cloud Purple Flower Crown, a dark numinous brocade robe, and the Primordial Mandate’s Preserving Form Mysterious Brilliance Talisman. He rides the One Simplicity’s Numinous Cloud Chariot of Eight Radiance, bestowing upon me the Supreme Dragon Mist Concealment Talisman. As cloud qi envelops my crown, my body senses ascent with the radiance. Strike the teeth thirty-six times and swallow qi once to conclude.

Next, visualize the Inner Thearch of the Nine Subtleties, whose taboo name is Shen Mingxian. He wears the Purple Primordial Three Treasures Crown, a dark cloud brocade robe, and the Morning Rosy Dawn’s Eight Transformations Flying Palace Talisman. He drives the Grand Rosy Dawn’s Purple Mist Cavernous Radiance Jade Chariot, coming to bestow upon me the Supreme Clarity’s Primordial Ultimate Boundless Supreme Dao Constant Concealment Talisman. With the cavernous radiance chariot, he comes to welcome my body, ascending to the Jade Clarity’s chamber.

When all is complete, strike the teeth thirty-six times and recite the incantation:
*"Eight Radiant Mysterious Mist, dispersing qi in the void courtyard,
Shrouding the body in nine rosy dawns, concealing radiance in the hidden and dark.
Precious talismans descend mysteriously, chariots of green jade turn and revolve,
Returning through the Nine Mornings, anchoring my form.
Ascending to the Jade Chamber, bowing in audience at the Purple Court."*

Conclude by swallowing qi thirty-six times.

Next, visualize the First Star Thearch of the Dipper transforming and concealing the Peach Primordial Inner Consort, named Taiyi Fatan, styled Xing Zhengfu, wearing a yellow brocade cloak and vermilion-green flying skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

The Second Star Thearch, Preserver of the Womb and Transformer of Form Inner Concubine, named Taiyi Sanpeng, styled Luo Zhuying, wearing a green brocade cloak and green-feathered flying skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

The Third Star Thearch, Six Escapes and Seven Stars’ Upper Primordial Cinnabar Mother, named Taiyi Yunyi, styled Chong Shuangzhao, wearing a green brocade cloak and embroidered-feather patterned skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

The Fourth Star Thearch, Concealer of Radiance and Hider of Light Central Primordial Inner Consort, named Taiyi Qilie, styled Qiu Hengying, wearing a purple brocade cloak and yellow-flowered feathered skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

The Fifth Star Thearch, Transformer of Body and Changer of Radiance Dipper’s Central Great Maiden, named Taiyi Yushu, styled Chou Qiulan, wearing a vermilion brocade cloak and purple-green flying skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

The Sixth Star Thearch, Concealer of Traces and Disperser of Forms Dipper’s Central Maiden, named Taiyi Qijing, styled Baoding Ling, wearing a vermilion brocade cloak and blue-embroidered flying skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

The Seventh Star Thearch, Divider of Radiance and Shaper of Myriad Forms Dipper’s Youngest Maiden, named Taiyi Duyi, styled Tian Fanshu, wearing a cinnabar brocade cloak and blue-flowered feathered skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

The Eighth Star Thearch, Transformer of Sun and Moon, Water and Fire Dipper’s High August Left Consort, named Taiyi Shiqizhu, styled Luomaohua, wearing a purple brocade cloak and embroidered-feather flying skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

The Ninth Star Thearch, Transformer of Metal and Stone, Mountains and Rivers Dipper’s High August Right Consort, named Taiyi Aitiao, styled Yun Yuxuan, wearing a green brocade cloak and kingfisher-flowered flying skirt, with cloud-like tresses.

Preserve the hidden names of the Nine Star Thearchs’ concealed consorts, their forms and colors, and their attire, all made luminously manifest. Descending from the Northern Dipper, their blazing radiance streams forth, resplendent in the void. Turning the spirit to mysterious reflection, they enter within my body, abiding in the Hall of Light and the Purple Chamber, flanked by the twin symbols of sun and moon, with the ninefold morning brilliance arrayed in order. They transform in succession into infants, the true forms of the Nine Thearchs, named the Eternal Youths. Settling within my body, both inner and outer become pervaded with clarity, their blazing radiance and mysterious reflection suffusing my frame with warmth. Then strike the teeth nine times and intone the incantation:

"Nine Mornings revolve on high,
Concealed transformations of the Primal Quadrant.
Cavern-Heaven’s Nine Origins,
True Youths within the Dipper.
Blazing radiance and mysterious reflection,
Spreading and suffusing the Purple Chamber.
A thousand changes, ten thousand transformations,
Exchanging radiance, infant illumination.
Following intent wherever it goes,
Emerging from being, entering non-being.
Attaining to ride the Eight Effulgences,
Ascending to audience with the August Thearchs."

When finished, swallow the qi nine times and cease.

This is the *Upper Scripture on the Concealed Forms and Hidden Radiance of the Nine Thearchs’ Yin Transformations*, wherein the Central Yellow Venerable Lord, the Southern Vermilion Essence Lord, the Eastern Azure Youth Lord, the Northern Supreme Lord, and the Western Primordial Simplicity Lord all revolve the Nine Yin to disperse their forms, move the Nine Mornings to conceal their bodies, cast the flying wheel to ascend the void, and ride the Dark Empyrean to roam at will. Their radiance transforms myriad times, drifting with the world’s vicissitudes. Should one practice this, the Three Luminaries shall share in one’s repose.

The *Upper Scripture on Ascending and Preserving Transcendence through Concealed Forms and Hidden Radiance* from the *Highest Clarity* concludes.
