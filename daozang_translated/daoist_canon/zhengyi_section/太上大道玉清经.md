**The Supreme Great Dao Jade Clarity Scripture, Fascicle One**
**1. The Origin of the Dao (Chapter One)**

The Dao spoke: In former times, the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, together with countless sages and worthies in the billions, roamed throughout the realms. Finally, he gazed down upon the Abandoned-Worthy World.

At that time, the people of the Four Continents had exhausted their merit and virtue, and before long, the great kalpa would shift its course. The people withered and perished, the world lost its stability, the Great Dao ceased to circulate, and all favored warfare. Punishments and killings knew no bounds; armies arose everywhere, and mutual harm was plotted. Neighboring states severed righteousness and ceased friendly exchange. The strong plundered the weak, seizing from the orphaned and widowed. Bandits and thieves arose on all sides, and Heaven sent forth omens of calamity. The sun and moon were eclipsed, stars fell from their lodgings, the Seven Luminaries moved in reverse, and thunder and rain came without clouds. At times, blood rained down along with other strange portents. Drought and flood were unbalanced, the hundred grains withered and dried, the great earth quaked and split open everywhere, mountains and peaks collapsed, gold and jade melted away, ferocious beasts devoured people, and malevolent spirits revealed their forms, spreading poison and pestilence. The earth sprouted hair, the six livestock spoke in human voices, and the countless people of the world were unsettled in heart. Rulers and ministers grew suspicious of one another, fathers and sons punished each other, and none cultivated the good Dao, favoring only evil. Over five hundred years, this grew ever more severe, and none could find life. Some, unable to bear the suffering and distress, threw themselves into abysses or fire, or hanged themselves to die. Hunger and hardship drove people to consume one another. The great earth grew parched, and springs ceased to flow.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly of sages, moved by compassion for the short-lived beings who had no refuge, saw them flee in terror, wailing in sorrow, their pain as if scorched by fire and poison. Thereupon, by the power of the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion, he and the assembly of sages sat together in the mysterious void, a hundred *zhang* above the earth. Then the heavens and earth trembled greatly for seven days and seven nights without ceasing. The empty sky announced auspicious signs: the sun and moon bore double wheels, their radiance resplendent; the stars shone brightly; wind and rain dispersed; clouds and mist spread forth; the sequence of *qi* was harmonious. Fragrant smoke coiled through the void, Brahmanic chants rang in unison, golden bells chimed clearly, jade chimes and bells resounded, the thunderous tones carried far and wide, and myriad celestial melodies played of themselves in the sky. Dragon thrones were arrayed, feathered canopies stretched high, numinous standards cast shadows in the heavens, long banners draped from the sky, immortal blossoms carpeted the earth, and cloudy curtains veiled the void. Lions raised their voices, divine deer bowed their cries, golden phoenixes sang in harmony, horned dragons intoned, jade chimes kept rhythm, and the ten thousand sounds hummed in unison.

The Heavenly Worthy and the assembly of sages together emitted the light of their bodies, illuminating the ten directions, leaving no darkness unlit. Their light was of a thousand kinds, shifting in myriad ways in an instant. Within each light appeared Perfected Ones, and each Perfected One had their own retinue. Clear voices rang out, expounding the wondrous Dharma.

All the kings, ministers, and people of the Four Continents, both human and non-human, each saw the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, seated in the void, conferring with the Great Creator Perfected Lord and the Mighty Numinous Immortals to determine the kalpa’s reckoning, rescue and deliver the myriad beings, re-examine the great register of the Azure Origin, and extend the appointed course. On golden tablets, they inscribed the true writs of the Five Thearchs and the cloudy, radiant chapters to pacify the five directions. He then commanded the Five Thearchs, the spirits of the rivers, and the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas to unblock the flow of springs. Heaven showered sweet dew to moisten the great earth. He ordered the Earl of Wind and the Master of Rain to harmonize *yin* and *yang*, making cold and heat appropriate. He commanded the Five Thearchs and the earth spirits to harmonize the hundred grains and cause medicinal herbs to grow. He dispatched the envoys of the Five Thearchs to slay and subdue demonic forces. He ordered the Heavenly Dragons and Thunder Gods to startle and discipline the treacherous and rebellious, striking fear into the *yin* evil. He commanded the Arrayed Immortals of the Gathering Winds to harmonize the *qi*, refine human conduct, and cause rulers and ministers to live in harmony, fathers to be kind and children filial. The murderous turned to goodness, the hidden and manifest returned to unity, poison and pestilence hid away, and evil demons concealed their forms. Fragrant blossoms and medicinal herbs flourished everywhere; the five grains bore fruit and ripened in winter and summer.

The sweet waters of flowing springs overflowed and spread in abundance. He further commanded the Five Dipper Immortals to align the celestial pivot, demarcate the sun’s path, and arrange the constellations. He dispatched the Four Heavenly Benevolent Spirits to assist the Son of Heaven. He assigned immortal officials to successively oversee state governance, causing the world to be transformed by virtue, the myriad people to live in peace and joy, neighboring states to engage in exchange, and resentments to dissolve. People upheld great righteousness, all walked the true Dao, and each kept to their proper place.

Thereupon, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, pitying the teeming masses in their perilous fragility, fanned the mysterious wind to guide all living beings. They feasted on harmonious *qi* and bathed in the transformative power of the Dao, returning from decay to flourishing, turning failure into success.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, together with the great sages and countless multitudes, each descended upon the various lands in jeweled celestial terraces. In those lands, the Son of Heaven, the kings, ministers, and all the people—men and women, young and old—everywhere made offerings with incense, flowers, banners, and music, singing praises as they listened to the Dharma.

At that time, the Dao Lord of the Southern Eight Barbarians, accompanied by sixty-four billion holy multitudes, descended from the Southern Prosperity Palace in crimson cloud chariots. From the Dark Heavens of the North, the True Lords of the Five Northern Tribes, with twenty-five million billion immortal officials, descended in black cloud chariots. In the void, they assessed the cycles of water and fire, the kalpas and their appointed times.

At that time, the Dao Lord of the Western Six Tribes, with thirty-six million billion perfected immortals, descended from the Luminous Origin Heaven in chariots of threefold radiant mist. At that time, the Dao Lord of the Eastern Nine Yi Tribes, with eighty-one billion multitudes, descended from the Primordial Azure Heaven in chariots of jade-green flying wheels. Together with the Dao Lord of the Six Tribes, they assessed the disasters of war and illness, recording the registers of good and evil deeds and their consequences.

Thereafter, the Central Void Sovereign, the Most Mysterious Ancient Lord, received the jade tallies from his left and right attendants and was entreated to expound the wondrous principles of creation, the profound and secret methods, to correctly determine the celestial origins, reverse the turning of the cosmic cycles, harmonize the four *qi*, and bring forth the myriad existences.

At that time, in the world of Abandoned Worthiness, there was a king named Virtue-Righteous, intelligent and upright, sharp-witted and discerning. He was a being of karmic fortune and virtuous power, descended in response to the times to serve as a guide for all living beings. He addressed all the ministers and people, men and women, within his domain, saying: “Now we have attained great peace, the world is at rest, fires and disasters have ceased, wars and illnesses do not arise, and the hundred grains ripen—all through the grace of the Dao, not by natural occurrence. How shall we repay this boundless grace? We must devote our hearts and minds, reverently make offerings, establish palaces and temples, present incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, and morning and evening perform rituals, recitations, fasts, and repentance to seek blessings and protection. Now is the very moment when the Heavenly Worthy is assessing fortune and misfortune, the appointed times of the kalpas. I shall act on my own behalf and on yours, prostrating myself to take refuge in the Most High and True, specially beseeching compassion and deliverance, that the supreme Dharma be bestowed upon us. May the lives of all men and women within my domain be prolonged, each completing their allotted span. Moreover, I wish to invite the Most High and True to descend upon my land, to express my humble devotion and the sincerity of my offerings. Do you, my people, share this wish?”

Thereupon, sixty thousand elders—including the Elder of Spiritual Mind, the Elder of Five Penetrations, the Elder of Literary Brilliance, and the Elder of Mystic Understanding—came from the four directions to pay their respects to the king. Hearing the king’s decree, they dared not fully believe. There were also eighty great ministers, with the Minister of Treasure Brilliance as their chief. The remaining ministers and elders harbored doubts, turning to one another and saying: “Since our birth into this world, from our ancestors and fathers, we have heard of the true Dao, yet our eyes have never beheld it. The great void is vast and empty—where is the proof? Now we enjoy peace and freedom from heaven; what has this to do with the power of the Dao?”

At that time, the Minister of Treasure Brilliance, wise and eloquent, upright in speech, whose words were always verified and trusted throughout the land, perceived the people’s skepticism and lack of pure faith. Before the king, he raised his voice and proclaimed: “I have heard that the Supreme Ultimate Heavenly Worthy established heaven and earth, covering and supporting the myriad things, opening the sun and moon, arranging the stars, circulating the true *qi*, and nurturing all living beings. Though dwelling in the upper realms, he responds and transforms the lower lands. The present great peace and the prolongation of the kalpa’s destiny are all through the power of the Dao. Yet living beings, dull and ignorant, know only their daily affairs, their hearts devoid of shame or reverence. They forget their origins and say that this peace and freedom come from heaven alone, unrelated to the power of the Dao. How can you deceive yourselves thus? I have heard that the Great Dao gives birth to heaven and earth.”

Heaven and earth honor the Dao, thus attaining tranquility; the myriad things value virtue, thus achieving full generation. If you do not believe in the Dao, this is your gravest fault—just as the foolish and deluded in the world, their hearts devoid of compassion, turn against their parents, abandon their siblings, and yet dwell complacently, claiming their well-being is self-derived, not owing to their parents. Your ignorance is no different.

As Baoming spoke these words, his virtue shook heaven and earth, the empty sky rained blossoms, and fragrant clouds enveloped the four directions. Then a voice from the heavens above resounded: *"The Dao does not proclaim itself; the true person does not boast of merit. Within the profound and obscure, there is faith—through kindness and benevolence, all may be united."*

The voice from the void had scarcely faded when, in an instant, from the northwest arose sudden winds, thunder, and lightning, clouds and mist obscuring the sky. Only the Heavenly King and Baoming remained bathed in light, each surrounded by a radiance spanning a *zhang*. From afar, the people witnessed these auspicious signs, their hearts stirred with remorse. They kowtowed, begging for mercy, surrendering to the great king, their faith now aligned with the unseen covenant.

In a moment, the winds and thunder vanished, the clouds and mist dispersed, and the entire kingdom’s ministers and people prostrated before the king: *"We do not yet understand the teachings Your Majesty has imparted. We beseech the descent of the Heavenly Perfected to your presence, that you may instruct us—what is required?"* They pleaded, *"May the great king take pity on living beings and awaken those who have not yet heard."*

The king replied: *"The Dao resides in the human heart. You must only offer reverent devotion, establish palaces and temples, provide for their needs, and morning and evening perform rites and prayers, repenting of transgressions and seeking blessings."*

Hearing this, the people rejoiced in their hearts, bowing in gratitude for the gift of rebirth. The king further instructed: *"Each of you may now return home, retreat in fasting to reflect on your faults, purify body and mind, and inform those who have not yet heard, as I have commanded."*

The people, having heard, took their leave at once and returned to their homes. The king then ordered the minister Baoming to announce throughout the city and its outskirts that all should prepare the palace halls, sweep and purify the streets, burn incense everywhere, and offer reverent devotion, arranging all worldly possessions—beds and seats—with utmost care.

When the day of retreat concluded, the people from the four directions gathered like clouds. The king, together with his inner and outer ministers and their families, sprinkled the ground with fragrant water, set out beds and canopies, and made all necessary preparations. The entire kingdom, great and small, bowed in reverence to the ten directions, performing rites and prayers for seven days and seven nights, beseeching the descent of the Supreme Perfected to the earth below. *"How pitiable are the dull and ignorant beings!"*

Then, at noon on the fifteenth day of the third month, from the northwest of the heavens suddenly appeared nine-colored streaming clouds, their radiance resplendent, fragrant winds pure and refreshing, celestial chants harmonious and refined, heavenly music flowing and bright. Sweet dew rained from the sky, the great earth trembled, and a shower of jeweled celestial blossoms fell, startling the land.

Cloud chariots and feathered canopies floated through the void, arriving in splendor. The multitude of perfected sages and great saints each rode upon celestial jewel platforms, within which shone a light that illumined the night. Five-colored divine radiance illuminated the empty sky, its brilliance surpassing sun and moon, descending upon the royal city and lingering for seven days and seven nights.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, through the power of compassion, accomplished great mercy, rescuing and protecting living beings, taking pity on them, opening the ears of the deaf and the eyes of the blind, healing all ailments, serving as their guide and ferry, safeguarding the kalpa’s destiny, and renewing the myriad things.

Thereupon, the king, his ministers, and all the people bowed again, earnestly entreating the Heavenly Worthy to unfold the great transformation, to compassionately instruct the multitude, to clarify their senses, and to guide them to the true Dao, that they might receive the secret essentials.

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Immortal of Vast Spirit to address the king: *"You, as ruler of a kingdom, are esteemed by all under heaven, having attained the highest earthly rank, a position of unparalleled honor. Yet if you govern with upright law and do not oppress the people, this alone is enough to move heaven with merit—why trouble yourself with the secret essentials? The secret essentials of the Dao are not easily heard in haste."*

The king and his ministers, being beings of accumulated virtue, sought through expedient means to open the eyes and ears of living beings. The Heavenly Worthy declared: *"The gateway to the secret essentials lies in nothing other than kindness and goodness; the method of kindness and goodness does not transgress the precepts and prohibitions. Through the power of great compassion, I perfect the realm."*

Hearing this, all rejoiced exceedingly, their hearts filled with the desire to uphold the precepts. The Heavenly Worthy continued: *"Precepts are of many kinds, and people are of many grades. The highest grade of person commits no transgressions in body. Having no transgressions, they have nothing to uphold. The middle grade of person has a heart that wavers between high and low; upon encountering circumstances, their nature changes. They restrain themselves with precepts, preventing recklessness. Such persons may receive the Ten Precepts or the Five Precepts to guard themselves. The lowest grade of person harbors myriad evil intentions, difficult to restrain. Among the lowest, there are two types: the higher of these desires to uphold precepts and may receive the One Hundred Ninety-Nine Precepts, or the Three Hundred Great Precepts of Observing the Body, or the One Thousand Two Hundred Precepts of Dignified Conduct, to protect themselves and prevent transgression. The lowest of the low are like beasts in body; though they possess human form, they lack a human heart. Even if they receive precepts, it will be of no benefit."*

*"For now, I shall bestow the second, middle-grade precepts—the Ten Prohibitions as the initial gateway to the Dao."*

Hearing this, the people rejoiced beyond measure, all prostrating themselves to receive the precepts. The Heavenly Worthy declared:

*"The first precept: Do not defy or disobey parents or teachers, nor commit the sin of filial impiety.*
*The second precept: Do not kill living beings, nor slaughter, harm, or sever the lives of creatures.*
*The third precept: Do not rebel against the sovereign or plot to harm the state or family. This precept is the weightiest. Why? Because all kings are those who govern through the turning of the kalpa’s destiny, ruling over all under heaven. They are the pivot upon which all people depend. Without a ruler, none would meet a proper end. For this reason, you must understand."*

The fourth precept: Do not engage in lewdness or disorder with kin—mothers, aunts, sisters, or other women.
The fifth precept: Do not slander the Daoist teachings or recklessly disclose scriptural texts.
The sixth precept: Do not defile or profane the sacred altar, nor expose yourself while wearing only a single garment.
The seventh precept: Do not bully the orphaned or impoverished, nor seize others’ property.
The eighth precept: Do not expose the Three Luminaries to contempt, nor mistreat the elderly or infirm.
The ninth precept: Do not indulge in wine to the point of recklessness, nor engage in duplicity or vicious cursing.
The tenth precept: Do not act with wolfish cruelty, nor wrongfully impose harsh punishments.

These Ten Precepts must be upheld throughout one’s life.

The Heavenly Worthy declared:
*"Those who are unfilial to parents or teachers will, upon death, fall into hell and remain there for ten thousand kalpas. Even if reborn among humans, they will be orphaned and destitute, subjected to others’ scorn, and forever dwell in lowliness.
Those who delight in killing will, for five hundred lifetimes, endure being cut and sliced, suffering myriad torments.
Those who rebel against their sovereign will, upon death, enter hell and endure ten thousand kalpas of agony. Upon rebirth, they will dwell in borderlands without a ruler, constantly besieged and living in perpetual terror.
The precept against lewdness is the gravest. If any man or woman, even for a single thought-moment, harbors lustful desires toward parents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, or any kin of the six relations, they will suffer hell’s retribution for eighty thousand great kalpas—pierced by iron nails, burned and boiled in countless ways. Emerging from hell, they will take the forms of the six livestock. After another eighty thousand kalpas, they will become worms in filth, and after yet another eighty thousand kalpas, their suffering shall continue.
Good men, you must now understand: even a single thought-moment of lust toward kin brings such retribution. How much greater, then, is the sin of those who commit such acts with their own flesh and blood? Their crimes are beyond description.
Such people must not share the same path, dwelling, seat, or bed. They must not live in the same village. I name them the Ten Evils. Though their bodies may appear strong, their souls are seized by malevolent spirits, and no benevolent deities will protect them. Their presence defiles the Dao; they must be swiftly expelled and barred from instruction. Those who would teach them would become their kind—doomed to rise and fall together.
Nine generations of their ancestors will be punished. I name them the Corrupters of Humanity.
Good men and women, you must now understand: lewdness, killing, plunder, theft, bullying the orphaned and weak, neglecting the poor and sick, slandering the true Dao, harming those of virtuous conduct, and profaning sacred texts—these sins are of the utmost gravity. I need not enumerate them all.
You must only guard the precepts with utmost sincerity, and the Dao will naturally descend upon you."*

Thereupon, the king, ministers, and all good men rejoiced and vowed to uphold them, daring not to transgress. The Dao Lord then commanded the Mighty Spirit True Lord to bestow upon the king the *Cloud-Script Heavenly Writ*—a thousand esoteric methods comprising the upper, middle, and lower chapters—inscribed on tablets of supple jade with characters of purple gold. The king received and recited them diligently.

The scripture was declared a celestial treasure: *"Those who recite it with devotion will gain the power of flight, never perish, and master the Six Penetrations, their will made manifest."*

The Dao Lord then addressed the king: *"You must understand: beneath the Four Heavens, all ages share the same fortune as this day. The majestic power of the Great Dao follows all beings, guiding and transforming them in ways beyond imagination. After a thousand days, you may transmit this dharma to the upright and worthy within your realm, that together you may govern the world, widely open the gates of the Mysterious, and let the Dao’s transformation flow freely. Let all men and women in the kingdom guard the precepts as they would a luminous pearl. Let the king and his ministers govern with righteousness and recite the true writ with single-minded devotion. Instruct the entire kingdom to establish temples, dedicating themselves solely to the Dao, seeking nothing else."*

The people of the kingdom bowed in reverence and departed. The king recited the true writ for a thousand days, then abdicated his throne to enter meditation, entrusting governance to his eldest son, named Good Cultivation, who followed his father’s example. After more than ninety years, the throne was passed to his younger brother, named Goodness, who likewise governed in his father’s manner. Over six thousand descendants of the royal line succeeded one another for thirty-six thousand years, and the world knew perfect peace.

The former king and Good Cultivation upheld the most wondrous practices for over forty years, attaining the Six Penetrations. Though they managed state affairs by day, their spiritual progress remained unobstructed. The Dao Lord had previously granted them the rank of Middle Immortals to oversee governance, though they had not yet ascended to the Great Ultimate. From this day forward, the Most High Dao Lord, recognizing their immense merit, bestowed upon them the secret essentials and appointed the king and his sons as Supreme Perfected Ones, commanding them to attend the Heavenly Perfected, teach the kingdoms, manifest in various forms to relieve suffering, expound the dharma, and deliver beings.

Thereupon, the Supreme Perfected and the assembly of sages alternately revealed their teachings, serving as masters and disciples to one another. In the first year of the Kai Guang era, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, they crossed the Dark Valley to the north and ascended the Terrace of Lofty Wind. There, they paid homage to the Supreme True Lord and entreated entry into the Great Luo Heaven to pay respects to the Ancestor of Primordial Qi and the Origin of the Lofty Mysterious.

The True Lord said: *"Though you have attained the Six Penetrations, your Daoist cultivation remains incomplete. Why? You are not self-so; you have become perfected through study. Yet the Origin of Primordial Qi is a being of true qi, spontaneously transformed—a natural body. The Ancestor of Primordial Qi is uniquely revered among the ten thousand Dao, the Great Sage who entrusts qi, the True One of Emptiness and Non-Being. To behold him is nearly impossible, for his transformations are as countless as one, vast and boundless, serene and tranquil, empty and still, expansive and profound, utterly beyond words and forms. The myriad Dao of the ten directions—thirty-six thousand kinds in all—trace their origin to the True One of Emptiness and Non-Being. Since my own attainment of the Dao, countless kalpas have passed, and I have met him but twice. Now, the Heavenly Emperor has reviewed the turning of the kalpa and issued a decree: you are to descend to the Four Heavens, teach the kingdoms, disseminate the Dao’s qi, and attend the Heavenly Worthy in guiding all beings."*

Why is this so? To prolong the calamity of this kalpa’s fire and qi, the Dao’s teachings must be practiced to suppress the misfortune of the Nine Yangs and extinguish the essence of fire. Yet when the kalpa’s end arrives and heaven and earth collapse, when the people’s fortune is exhausted, the Dharma will no longer save them. The extremity of fate’s reckoning is thus by nature. At the beginning of the water kalpa, my Dao flourished greatly, and for three hundred seventy thousand years, the people remained pure and simple. Thereafter, the Great Dao gradually waned, yin qi grew dominant, and the people turned to reckless fortune-seeking. They built empty tombs and erected temples across the world. Men and women, their hearts perverse, practiced destructive rites, disregarding proper forms. They wailed and begged for death, leapt into fire pits or plunged into deep abysses, slashed themselves or severed their own limbs. They gathered in crowds to perform the Dao, singing hymns and weeping bitterly. Some entered empty tombs to sit in silence; others embraced corpses or revered dry bones. They made altars of filth or smeared the ground with incense and ashes, disrespected their parents, and engaged in every manner of ascetic suffering. They consumed foul and vile things, committing every conceivable transgression—yet still could not attain the true and orthodox Dao. Their hearts grew crooked, and father and son abandoned righteousness, while factions thrived in false teachings.

Before the great water kalpa, there came a lesser water kalpa, lasting ten years before subsiding. Thereafter, for four thousand years, within the false teachings, wars arose, and men schemed against one another. Some proclaimed themselves kings, ruling for ten or a hundred days before perishing by their own hands. Father and son cast aside propriety, the strong oppressed the weak, and even those of the same bloodline debauched one another. Though they bore human form, they lacked human hearts—ruthless and reckless, trusting no one. When this time arrives, false ways will flourish, yin qi will reach its peak, and before long, floods will surge, drowning all, transforming men into fish, devoured by dragons and serpents. At this juncture, the Dharma demands the selection of the seed-people, to be placed in lands of blessing. You must toil diligently, never slackening from dawn to dusk. This is what it means for the Great Dao to be magnified through humanity: my destiny lies in my own hands, shaped by my conduct. A heart aligned with the Dao invokes its response; following perversity invites calamity. Those who delight in killing will be felled by their own violence—thus, one must practice great compassion.

**Chapter Two: Corresponding Retributions**

At that time, the Supreme Perfected, accompanied by thirty-six thousand newly attained Daoists from the Great Clarity Heaven, attended the Heavenly Worthy in teaching the farthest reaches of the celestial realms. They descended to the lower worlds, journeying among the barbarian lands, the kingdoms of birds and beasts, and all manner of beings. Adapting to their inclinations, they manifested diverse teachings, instructing and benefiting them through expedient miracles, subduing their hearts with majestic transformations.

They arrived at the western edge of the Blackwater, where there lay a world spanning eight thousand *li*. Its myriad beings, of every kind, dwelled in caves and devoured one another. The land bore thorny brambles, poisonous grasses, and toxic trees, while its springs ran black and foul, unfit for washing or drinking. On the western border of this land flowed a great river, square in shape and over five thousand *li* wide. Its waters were turbid and filthy, teeming with venomous dragons. The river’s winds and waves raged violently, making crossing by boat impossible.

Along the river’s eastern bank stretched a plain of three thousand *li*, rising five hundred *zhang* above the water’s edge. Half the people in this world were eyeless, groping their way forward, devouring one another when hungry and drinking blood when thirsty. Those with eyes suffered from loathsome diseases—brows and hair falling out, bodies festering with sores, oozing pus and filth. Serpents abounded, swallowing people whole. There was no order of ruler and subject, no bond of father and son; instead, they fought ceaselessly. The eyeless, hearing the clash of weapons, fled in terror, some tumbling into the river to be devoured by dragons. Those who avoided the river were eaten by marauding bands, their cries of terror and agony echoing in despair.

Foul ditches overflowed with putrid sludge, their stench unbearable. Within these pits writhed countless maggots, their heads resembling men’s, their bodies a *zhang* long, writhing on their bellies and wailing. Vultures and monstrous birds pecked at them, leaving the ground strewn with rotting flesh. Malevolent ghosts, their fur like needles, exhaled scorching breath that burned like fire.

To the north of this plain lay six great hells, their gates each a *zhang* square. Descending into them, the space widened endlessly, their depths unfathomable. Within, only the sounds of wind, thunder, fire chariots, wailing, and torment could be heard—the clamor of blades, saws, hammers, and cudgels. Voices cried out for rescue, for life. Smoke and flames raged, their fire and fumes billowing skyward.

In the first hell to the west, the roar of wind and water resounded, its air so bitterly cold it could not be approached. From the darkness came faint, mournful cries. The winds from all six hells carried an indescribable stench of burning and decay.

A *li* and a half north of the hells’ gates bubbled a scalding spring, six *li* wide. Its boiling waters churned with yellow fat, grease, rotting skin, bones, and flesh. From within came faint, pitiful wails, the spring’s vapors searing all they touched.

North of the spring rose mountains of blades and forests of swords, strewn with fresh and old corpses, severed limbs, and flesh hanging from the weapons’ edges. The sight of such suffering was unbearable to behold.

There was also a hell of flaying alive, where those who had slaughtered sheep in life fell after death. For five hundred years, they endured torment before being reborn as sheep, then spent another five hundred lives repaying their debt in kind, trapped in an endless cycle of retribution.

East of the boiling spring lay the Wind-Blade Hell, a *li* wide, where those who had corrupted the true teachings—violating precepts, leaking sacred texts, transmitting them to the unworthy, or peddling the Dao for personal gain—were cast after death. For a kalpa, they suffered as fierce winds hurled them against razor-sharp blades, dying and reviving a thousand times in a single day.

Having emerged from hell, they are reborn among humans, their bodies afflicted with perverse maladies, their faculties dull and benighted, forever dwelling in the lowest strata, never to hear the Dharma again. When the sinful souls of hell at last escape, they are mostly born in borderlands or godforsaken realms, constantly beset by raids and pillage, living in terror day and night, their bodies stunted and misshapen, their breath foul and rank, never to hear the Dharma.

Moved by the unceasing anguish of these sinners, the Dao Lord, together with the Supreme Perfected and the host of sages, came to the deliverance of the damned and the deaf-and-blind of this world, that they might awaken to life and death. Thereupon, in the void above this world, a hundred *zhang* from the earth, they bowed from afar to the primordial qi.

The Most High and Lofty Heavenly Worthy, through the divine power of the Dao, entered the Great Samādhi of the Six Voids. Splitting into a hundred million bodies, each body in turn radiated a thousand kinds of light, and within each light sat a perfected immortal upon a flying-dragon throne, expounding the wondrous Dharma. The jade-like voices resounded like thunder; to the left, golden bells tolled, to the right, jade chimes rang. A canopy of nine-colored radiant mist enveloped this realm, and within each mist sat a host of sages, preaching the Dharma. The great earth trembled, sweet dew rained from heaven, fragrant springs overflowed, all sounds stilled into emptiness, the Three Luminaries shone as one. The earth brought forth a hundred grains, waters turned cool and clear, human hearts grew pure and guileless, free from mutual harm. Venomous dragons sheathed their poison, plague demons hid their forms, hell’s sorrows ceased, the blades of sword-trees snapped, sinful souls were reborn, chronic ailments healed, the deaf and blind regained their senses, the maimed and crippled were restored to wholeness.

So vast was this transformation that no name could encompass it. Among the assembly, those newly attained to the Dao, not yet ascended to the highest mystery, beheld this divine marvel yet knew not its source. Then arose from the multitude a youth of the Five Penetrations, named Good Accumulation, together with Golden-Tressed Youth, Flower-Wisdom Youth, and Treasured Light Youth—eighty-four thousand in all—who rose from their seats, knelt with hands clasped, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:

“Since attaining the Dao, we have traversed eighty thousand great kalpas, journeying through the eight directions, reaching every place, yet never have we witnessed the majestic, divine, and sovereign power of the Great Dao as we do today. We rejoice in this assembly, having encountered this vast transformation. We only pray that the True and Perfected One take pity on the unenlightened, awaken the dull-rooted, and resolve all doubts.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy remained silent. The youths entreated thrice without cease, until at last the Heavenly Worthy gathered his thoughts into profound stillness, his divine radiance serene and luminous. He snapped his fingers, cleared his throat, and after a long while, spoke:

“Excellent, excellent! Your question is profound and subtle indeed. The Great Dao is vast and silent, its principle beyond perception or hearing, abstruse and recondite, obscure and deeply trustworthy. Though you have traversed kalpas and preserved the Dao and its virtue, the realm you inhabit lies close to the Supreme Clarity, yet remains utterly cut off from the Profound Mystery. How could you merge with the transformation, scattered among thirty-six thousand kinds, yet remain ignorant of the origin of the Highest Mystery of the Great Luo? Bound by what you see and hear, how can you fathom this wondrous truth? To wander freely without hindrance and attain enduring existence—this you may achieve. But to forget the Lord of Primordial Qi and the calamity of premature demise—from this, you have yet to be delivered.”

Then, upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse, Shanji’s mind opened and his understanding deepened. Together with the multitude of youths, he reflected inwardly: “By virtue of profound blessings accumulated in past lives, I have encountered this auspicious gathering—joy beyond all previous experience. Now that I have attained awakening, I vow to ascend to the Great Luo, to pay homage before the Primordial Qi’s Ancestor, the Highest Mystery Dao Lord, and to receive the secret teachings and the path of cultivation.”

Thereupon, Shanji and his retinue of eighty-four thousand advanced together and made obeisance, saying: “Most High Dao Lord, we have been graciously enlightened in matters never before heard. We now wish to lead this assembly in ascending to the Great Luo, to pay reverence before the Highest Mystery’s august presence. We beseech the Dao Lord to show compassion and grant permission.”

The Dao Lord replied: “If you wish to depart, you must relinquish all that is seen and heard. Though you lead a great multitude, let your mind remain without companions; devote yourself single-mindedly to stillness and resolve. Let cloud and mud be as one; withdraw your gaze and reverse your hearing—thus shall the Dao spontaneously unite with the Profound. ”

Shanji and his retinue, obeying the teaching, first paid homage to the upper realms, took leave of the Dao Lord, and ascended into the Great Void of the Great Luo Heaven, where they beheld the Lord of Primordial Qi, the Highest Mystery’s Ancestor.

At that time, the people of this realm all found respite and rejoiced, leaping with joy. They raised their hands toward the heavens, snapped their fingers, and exclaimed: “We, burdened by sins from past lives, were born in this wretched land, having forgotten the true mind and clung only to evil, passing it down through generations without awakening. Our sins and habitual defilements cast us into hell, where we cycled through suffering without self-awareness, bound by unyielding karmic bonds. Yet in a single moment, these bonds have dissolved—without the grace of the Dao, what could have saved us? We long to repay this debt, yet know not how. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to descend to this lower realm, to grant our humble request and fulfill our earnest hearts.”

The Dao Lord, foreseeing their intent, transformed into an ordinary person and wandered among them, conversing and imparting the Dao’s teachings. At times, he begged for alms and lodged among them, instructing them in building shelters and transforming raw into cooked. At times, he served as a guide, expounding the Dharma with skillful means. At times, he became a physician or shaman, healing their illnesses. At times, he was a farmer, teaching them cultivation. At times, he was a filial son, instructing them in kindness and righteousness. Adapting to their forms and inclinations, he established rulers and ministers, gradually reforming their ways, instilling order between elders and youth, and distinction between men and women. Through manifold teachings over fifteen years, harmonious qi flowed freely. The people gradually recognized the Dharma, erecting temples, transcribing scriptures, crafting images, and holding fasts and assemblies. They offered fragrant oils, lamps, and candles, joyfully dedicating their treasures, wholeheartedly revering the Dao. They practiced filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, observing the rites between ruler and subject. Beings of other kinds were reborn, the dark realms opened to peace, and all creatures kept to their proper places, refraining from mutual harm.

Then, the Dao Lord, assuming the guise of a great master, dwelled in the cold mountains and forests. Sometimes, his disciples observed precepts and expounded the Dharma; at other times, he sat alone in silent contemplation or lectured and recited scriptures for others. At times, his words foretold fortune or misfortune with uncanny accuracy. His transformations were wondrous and unpredictable, ageless in appearance. The entire realm turned to him in devotion, offering all they possessed—burning incense, scattering flowers, and each voicing their heartfelt wishes, longing for the Heavenly Worthy to descend into the dust and defilement to awaken all beings. They prostrated themselves, gazing heavenward, their blood and tears staining the earth, weeping and wailing without cease for seven days and nights.

Then, by virtue of his great compassion, the Dao Lord, accompanied by a host of sages, rode upon nine-colored flowing essence and the true light of qi. Divine youths led the procession, scattering flowers and burning incense. A sacred wind stirred the flutes, and celestial beasts harmonized in song. Qilin danced and phoenixes sang as they floated through the air, halting five measures above the earth.

At that time, the one previously transformed—named Kongsheng—who had served as the foremost guide for all beings, spoke: “Has the Heavenly Worthy, in guiding and transforming us, not wearied? In your compassion, you fashion all things—are you not exhausted? Delaying your cloud-borne chariot, you condescend to descend to this lower realm. We, long mired in kalpas of stagnation, bound by the fetters of sin and defilement, have in an instant been cleansed by the mist, bathed in the Profound Stream. Yet our gratitude overflows beyond measure. The true source is distant and vast, the upper realms empty and boundless, while we, in these defiled bodies, have suddenly encountered great transformation. Our lives, brief as morning mushrooms, now gaze upon the eternal sun; the withered and decayed have blossomed anew. Born in this day of fortune, we dare to voice our humble wishes, though we fear to offend your august presence. We pray that your great compassion may grant us the resolve of ants and insects, unwavering in retreat. If there remain doubts in our hearts, truths yet ungrasped, we beseech your heavenly mercy to reveal our past lives, the causes and conditions of this land, and the origins of its beings. Grant us the favor of your profound insight, and deign to explain.”

Then, all beings in that realm, great and small, prostrated themselves, their blood and tears mingling. The Dao Lord, moved by great compassion, reflected deeply for a long while. He commanded forty-nine left-attendant immortal youths to strike the jade chimes of the Profound Cloud in unison, their voices joining in the celestial harmony of the *Great Elegance*, a melody that unites the divine. He then commanded thirty-six right-attendant immortal youths to play the nine-harmony flutes, blending with the phoenixes’ songs and the ethereal tones of the Eight Assemblies of Jade Capital. He ordered the jade youths of incense to burn the hundred-harmony soul-returning incense. He commanded the long-fanged left officer to strike the golden bell, and the right steward to sound the jade chime. After a long while, the myriad sounds converged. Auspicious clouds wove through the void, streaming radiance in all directions. A divine wind reached the eight extremities, and the celestial music fell silent.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy exhaled a fragrant light, and a great thunderous voice resounded, addressing Kongsheng: “You and all beings born in this land must now understand: the Dao’s compassionate power gives life to and completes all things. Thus, the myriad sounds are played, transforming and harmonizing all existence, uniting and generating qi to dispel afflictions. You and this multitude have come from the midst of afflictions, creating manifold evil karma, cycling through retribution, and falling into this borderland, where you have never heard the good Dao and have forgotten your original mind. This world is called the *Realm of Retribution*; it is also named the *Hell of Birth and Death*.”

These hells exist everywhere, yet beings dwell within them unaware, scorched day and night, awaiting annihilation. This river is called the *Drifting Waves of Karmic Retribution in Birth and Death*. These six great hells correspond to the six senses through which one commits transgressions—upon death, one enters them accordingly.

This boiling cauldron is named the *Boiling Cauldron Hell*; those in the world who scald living beings to death fall into this hell, unable to escape for kalpas. These mountains of blades and forests of swords are for worldly fools who delight in stabbing and slashing animals—they suffer this torment after death. Those who are flayed alive in life are worldly fools who rob others’ wealth, carve flesh from living fish, and endure suffering after death, their flesh torn from their bodies while still alive.

These venomous dragons and pythons are the retribution for evil persons who destroy merit and oppress the virtuous. The worms in this cesspool are worldly fools who harbor murderous intent toward their parents, uncles, aunts, sisters, or kin of the same surname, or who lust after their uncles, aunts, sisters, the six relations, parents, or teachers—upon death, they enter hell, unabsolved for ten thousand kalpas, and now take the form of these worms, forever dwelling in filth, feeding on foulness.

Kongsheng, know that the sins of those in the world who betray kin, commit incest, or harbor murderous intent are so vast that even ten thousand kalpas of explanation could not exhaust them. Such persons are certainly barred from the Dao; no divine spirits descend upon them, and no life-giving qi is bestowed. Kongsheng, you must now understand: such evil persons are irredeemable in body and mind, beyond teaching or transformation. You must distance yourself from them, refuse their offerings, avoid sitting on their beds, and never enter their doors—those who do violate the precepts and incur the envy of demonic spirits. Among the thirty-six thousand rules of conduct, this precept is the weightiest.

Thus, I earnestly reiterate this for you. Now widely propagate and recite this scripture. Those who are deaf or blind and cannot read it should constantly burn incense, bow in reverence, and make offerings to the scripture—its merit is boundless. The impoverished who cannot copy the scripture should visit households that possess it to practice the Dao and pay homage.

Kongsheng, know that according to the statutes of the Perfected, good men and women who delight in releasing living beings, aid the destitute, heal the sick, honor their parents, dwell in mountain forests, and recite the true scriptures—these five virtues are equal in merit, and those who embody them shall be delivered in life and attain the true Dao. Kongsheng, you must enlighten the unenlightened and awaken their understanding.

At that moment, the great assembly, having heard the Heavenly Worthy’s words, experienced awakening in body and mind. Overjoyed, they received the essential teachings, bowed in reverence, and departed.

**Chapter Three: The World**

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, accompanied by his retinue of divine attendants and perfected sages, soared through the air over the southern reaches of the Fiery Continent and entered the Pool of Radiant Refinement. There, he subdued the fire spirits with a scripture of the Black Emperor, and all returned at once. Proceeding eastward, they passed the southern shores of Fusang, traversing ninety million miles to a land of virtue and goodness.

This land spans over eighty thousand *li* in each direction, bordered by four seas, and is also called the *Realm of Ultimate Bliss*. Its king is named Flower Splendor, with eight hundred ministers, thirty-eight thousand attendants, and sixty-four great cities, along with six thousand four hundred smaller cities. The king governs with righteous law, never oppressing the people. The land is prosperous, abundant in treasures, with temperate seasons, harmonious winds and rains, ample grain and silk, and free from illness and suffering.

In the northwest of this land lies another city, square in shape and spanning two thousand five hundred and forty *li*, its walls towering seven thousand *ren* high. It has four great gates, each six thousand *ren* tall and a *li* wide, with towers of extraordinary splendor and magnificence. Within the city stand seven thousand jeweled terraces, each emanating the radiance of luminous moons, illuminating dawn and dusk. The city is inhabited solely by immortals and Daoists, their forms like gold and jade, nourished by the celestial kitchens.

This king, his ministers, and all attendants are divine beings incarnate, governing the realm with wisdom. Thrice daily, fragrant winds sweep away the dust, and sweet dew falls to moisten the earth. The land abounds with springs and pools, all connected to jade springs, where yellow marrow flows—those who drink this water take on forms like gold and jade.

Thrice daily, phoenixes sing, myriad sounds resonate in the void, fragrant clouds gather in the sky, and celestial music fills the air—elegant and refined, its subtle tones clear and bright. This is not by chance but the result of accumulated merit.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy and nine hundred million sages rested in this city, seated upon flying dragon thrones of a hundred treasures, each throne ten thousand *ren* high, rising above the city. Cloud brocade and jade gauze served as their cushions, and nine-colored canopies of flowing mist were spread, each adorned with luminous moon-jewels. At the four corners of the canopies, within the void, dragon candles shone, and divine phoenixes danced in the air. The wind harps resounded through the heavens, and fragrant vapors wafted, celestial incense drifting on the breeze.

Then, the Heavenly Perfected commanded the left immortal attendant to strike the golden divine bell, the right immortal attendant to sound the luminous chime, and the jade attendant of incense to burn the hundred harmonies of incense in the nine-dragon brazier. The true forms arrayed themselves, and the celestial melody unfolded.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy emitted a fragrant light from his body, illuminating the world in myriad transformations beyond description. The sound of his finger-snap was like thunder. The men and women of the land, hearing it, awakened and said to one another: “What auspicious sign is this today? The fragrant light penetrates all, the winds and thunder harmonize, and all beings—whether rising or falling, flying or walking—leap and dance for joy. This is no ordinary event; let us hasten to see its cause!”

Then the king, princes, ministers, consorts, and royal kin turned to one another and said: “Our land is blessed with accumulated virtue, and great sages often descend here. This cannot be mere coincidence—it must be an auspicious omen. Each of you, prepare yourselves with all necessary provisions. Tomorrow, I shall lead you all to the jeweled city.”

The men and women of the realm arrived together, and from afar they saw the radiant brilliance within the city. Within that light, true immortals chanted sacred hymns. The king and his people bowed their heads in reverence, saying: “Today we are fortunate indeed to behold the Heavenly Worthy descending into this jeweled city. Joy and blessing converge beyond all thought.” Each burned incense and voiced their vows.

The king and his people stood at the southern gate, prostrating themselves upon the ground, remaining there for a long while. They reflected: “By what cause, through what blessed fortune, do we encounter this day? We dare not lift our gaze to the august countenance. We only pray that the great compassion of the exalted perfected ones may take pity upon us, awaken those who have not yet heard, and unravel the web of our doubts.”

After a long while, the Heavenly Worthy cleared his throat, snapped his fingers, and the celestial music ceased. He addressed the king: “This world of yours is a land of blessing, where exalted beings of the upper realms often wander. Yet the kalpas stretch far beyond your understanding. Before heaven and earth were illuminated, before the primordial chaos had divided, the Heavenly Worthy, the supreme sage, descended into this city. Even now, nine hundred million great kalpas have passed. Long ago, I came here with the Lord of Creation to assess the turning of the kalpas. Now I return to observe this world once more—such is the workings of karmic conditions, and I shall come again in due time.

Moreover, the late-learned immortals within this city have cultivated their practices to maturity. Though great sages descend, they have nothing left to teach. The men and women of this land have only just ascended to the first stage, reborn here through the karmic conditions of the Dao. Before long, a celestial assembly of perfected ones will convene, and the great transmission of the Dao will extend its grace to you. You must focus your minds, revere this jeweled city, uphold the precepts, practice generosity, and never waver in your resolve. Then the Dao will naturally descend upon you.”

Then from among the assembly, a youth named True Practice rose from his seat, stepped forward, and bowed. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Ever since I received the blessing of the celestial court and joined the ranks of the cloud-borne immortals, I have been steeped in the mysterious transformation for a hundred kalpas. I have wandered the ten directions, yet nowhere have I seen such splendor as this city—its magnificence and beauty, its prosperous people, its ranks of immortals arrayed like a forest, its jade groves and jeweled branches, its empty winds and myriad echoes, its return to pure simplicity, its harmonious qi, its towering virtue—all beyond measure. I only pray that your merciful light may illuminate our ignorance and grant this great assembly sudden awakening.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Your admiration for this city reflects the longing in your heart. Never before have you seen such a world. Though this realm is called the Land of Ultimate Bliss, residual habits still linger. The people, immortals, and Daoists here are all beings from various karmic paths who, though their merits were not yet complete, were reborn here. They have not yet reached the profound stillness of the Dark Mystery. From time to time, sages descend to serve as their teachers, though they do not remain long.

Know this, True Practice: it is like the case of the Fragrant Accumulation Youth, who once said, ‘When the Dao’s extremity brought me to your presence, I held your canopy for half a kalpa, entreating you to expound the subtle and wondrous Dao. Only then did I begin to awaken.’ I then revealed to him the names of the Great Loftiness and the High Mystery. The youth departed to pay his respects and inquire into the profound principles, and he has not yet returned.

What you see now is no different. The mysteries of the hidden and secret cannot be lightly spoken. When your own Dao cultivation reaches its limit, you shall naturally perceive them.”

Then True Practice and the virtuous king, along with the ministers and people, still uncertain, again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “We do not yet understand—by what past merits and practices did the immortals, Daoists, king, and people of the Land of Ultimate Bliss come to be reborn here?”

The Heavenly Worthy answered: “The methods of cultivation are many, not just one. Listen carefully, and I shall explain, transforming the understanding of this land.

There are four kinds of beings in the heavens and among men:

The first rank consists of those who in life honor and support their parents, serve their teachers, relieve the destitute, practice Daoist arts, uphold the precepts, recite scriptures, and never slacken in their morning and evening devotions. They perform rituals, make vows, repent their transgressions, and seek blessings, aspiring to ascend and be delivered. When their merits are complete and their practices perfected, they move the Paper-Heaven above. Their names are inscribed on the left register, their lives recorded in golden tablets. They gain mastery over their forms, soar through the Upper Clarity, conceal or manifest themselves at will, and their Dao equals that of the perfected ones. They become deathless, ascending to immortality in broad daylight, attaining the rank of the highest perfected, and serving as attendants to the Lord of the Dao. Though they may briefly pass through this realm—lingering for a kalpa or half a kalpa—they eventually return to the celestial realms. Such beings are called the highest rank.

The second rank consists of those who in life were wise and pure, aiding their nations and governing with beneficence. Their words brought benefit, their generosity was vast, and they promoted the true Dao, supporting the good. At death, they achieved liberation through the corpse, like a snake shedding its skin, and were reborn here. Such beings are also called those who ascend in their present forms.

Within this second rank, there is another kind: some encounter the grace of the Celestial Emperor, who delivers them from life and death. Their dry bones and lifeless corpses are transformed and refined into living beings, moved by the true qi to become immortals spontaneously. Others, having formed karmic bonds with the Dao in past lives, receive blessings that flow into their present existence, leading them to be reborn here.

The third rank consists of those who in life upheld the precepts and maintained goodness, refraining from wrongdoing. They built palaces and temples, provided incense and lamps, held fasts and lectures, organized assemblies, copied scriptures, and crafted images. Through their morning and evening recitations, they too achieved liberation through the corpse and were reborn here.

The fourth rank consists of those who, after death, are reborn here by inheriting the residual blessings of their ancestors’ accumulated virtue, even changing their surnames.

Then the youth True Practice and the assembly, still uncertain, again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “We do not yet understand—by what merits did the ancestors of the fourth rank cultivate such abundant blessings that their descendants might be reborn here?”

The Heavenly Worthy, may you deign to expound further, that our minds may awaken to understanding.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “When I speak of the causes of blessed fortune, it may be that their ancestors in former lives gave wealth and food, released living beings, clothed and fed the destitute and cold, aided the orphaned and weak, succored the aged and sick, or provided for those dwelling in mountain retreats. Though their merit was not yet perfected and they withdrew midway, failing to attain liberation themselves, their blessings extended to their descendants. Or they may have been born into noble and wealthy families, endowed with keen intelligence. Or they may have sought the Dao but not yet fulfilled their practice, their destined time of liberation having arrived, and thus were reborn here. Such persons’ virtue extends through nine generations.

True Practice, you must understand: good and evil are alike in this. Those who accumulate transgressions also bring calamity upon nine generations. Just as in the world, where fools may inherit ancestral blessings and be born into wealth and nobility, yet rely on their strength and arrogance, disbelieving in past karma, and indulge in cruelty and peril—slaying living beings, plundering others’ wealth, wielding punishment without restraint, undermining the good Dao, slandering practitioners, envying those superior to themselves, oppressing the orphaned and weak, flogging the lowly, hunting and killing, boiling and roasting creatures, stabbing and piercing beings, disobeying parents, rebelling against rulers, indulging in wine and lust, defiling kin, violating others’ wives, cursing and humiliating elders, exposing the Three Luminaries, disrespecting the virtuous, occupying high positions with malice, belittling sacred altars, divulging scriptural treasures, breaking fasts and violating precepts, constantly stirring chaos, exploiting others’ misfortunes, and mutually entrapping one another—killing to seek life, betraying the Dao and virtue.

Such persons’ calamities also flow through nine generations. Their descendants of the nine ranks face ruin wherever they turn, reduced to servitude, constantly bound in shackles, ensnared by wicked destinies, dying to enter hell, reborn as the six kinds of livestock, roasted and seared by humans, suffering myriad torments, revolving through evil destinies, born without fixed form, drowning in the cycle of birth and death, adrift in waves of suffering.

True Practice, you must understand: I observe that among the beings of the lower realms, the matters of suffering and joy are not so different. Why is this so? You speak of the Land of Ultimate Bliss, where cities, terraces, and pavilions are not natural but wrought by divine labor, unlike the palaces of the upper realms, which arise naturally. It is like the Fragrant Accumulation Youth, who, having never beheld the Great Void and the Boundless Dao Realm, believed the rewards of the Land of Mercy to be supreme. My observation of your mind is no different.

True Practice, you must understand: the thirty-six thousand kinds of Dharma arise from human conditions and karmic affinities. Through cultivating practices and deeds, though one may speak of attaining the Dao, the pace varies. It is like the Treasure Light Youth, who in his past life received the teaching of extinction from the Ancient Master, yet after eighty thousand great kalpas of diligent cultivation, still could not attain the Dao. Only in his final incarnation did he encounter the Dragon’s First Assembly, where the heavenly Dao is vast, and he first entered the Dao’s ranks, yet remained in the upper grade of the seventh stage. Had he not met the Perfected One of the Primordial Sovereign, how could he have ascended into the formless realm?”

Thereupon, True Practice and the assembly, having heard the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse, felt their minds open and their understanding deepen. They bowed their heads in reverence and returned to their seats. The king, princes, ministers, and all the people, having heard the origins of karmic causes and conditions, rejoiced exceedingly. Each offered luminous moon-jewel treasures, presenting them to the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy accepted them and placed them within the city. The king and the assembly, overjoyed and exultant, paid their respects and departed.

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly of great sages gathered their divine powers and ascended into the formless realm, suddenly vanishing from sight.

**Chapter Four: The Sequence of Compassion and Precepts**

At that time, within the Jade Clarity Heaven, in the jeweled palaces of the Golden Perfected Queen and Sagely Heavenly Worthy, there once lived in the world of Many Joys a child of the Ji family. At the age of six, he understood profound texts, deeply grasped subtle principles, and thoroughly comprehended the obscure and minute. Thereupon, he abandoned his home to seek the Dao, entering the Longming Mountains. After ten years of refined contemplation, he moved the Western Numinous Void Heavenly Worthy to bestow upon him the essentials of the Dao.

At twenty-seven, he attained the six penetrations. Since achieving the Dao, he had traversed countless kalpas, ever employing the power of his vow to deliver sentient beings. Roaming the ten directions like the sun circling in illumination, he manifested forms in accordance with kinds and harmonized with their voices, employing expedient means to guide and benefit all, equal and undivided, with a single thought for all beings.

In the eighth year of the Yuanhua era, in the gengzi year, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he descended with thirty-six thousand sages to wander the Mystic Heaven, arriving at the Northern Ultimate’s Long Darkness World in the midst of the empty sky. Together, they sat upon rosy clouds, gazing upon the six directions. For a hundred minor kalpas, their bodies and minds remained unmoving, like a precious mountain. The assembly of sages likewise remained unmoving in body and mind for a hundred kalpas.

At that time, the world suddenly became radiant, as if in spring. Harmonious qi flowed unimpeded, wind and rain were well-balanced, clouds and mist gathered and dispersed, thunder resounded clearly, medicinal herbs flourished, the hundred grains grew in winter, the earth yielded sweet springs, exquisitely fragrant and delicious. Dragons and scaled creatures leapt, phoenixes and simurghs soared in dance, and beings of all kinds gathered, all drawing close in kinship. People and non-humans transformed in body and mind, all as if long accustomed to cultivation and teaching.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly of sages, serene and quiescent, uttered no words. Yet through the power of compassion, the myriad things of heaven and earth transformed of themselves. There was no radiant sound to be seen or heard; the obscure and the manifest merged in profound union, and the spirits harmonized in perfect accord. The Dao of non-action brought this about, yet even I know not how it came to be.

Though the Dao does not speak, its virtue and transformation spread forth. True qi stirs and excites, subtle principles respond with precision, yet without movement. The people of that land were likewise unaware, their minds lacking discriminating wisdom. Each remained in their place, every person keeping to their allotted role, living out their years and lifespans.

On the fifteenth day of the third month, in the Snow Mountains, there was a youth named Dharma Joy, who styled himself an immortal. With his retinue of one thousand two hundred fifty, including the Golden Topknot Youth, Golden Grain Youth, Jeweled Crown Youth, Tamed Youth, Ten Abodes Youth, Ocean Wisdom Youth, Seven Awakening Youths, Pervasive King Youth, Self-Mastering Youth, and Good Wealth Youth—eleven youths in all—who led the assembly as chief chanters, each likewise styling themselves immortals, they all rode white elephants to descend to the earth. Circumambulating in praise, they bowed from afar to the Heavenly Worthy, burned incense, scattered flowers, and offered various forms of reverence. Each declared their original vows and inquired after the Heavenly Worthy, saying:

“We, this assembly, fortunately bear the blessings of past lives. In the primordial kalpa, we encountered the Ancient Master, who took pity and transformed us, enabling us to enter the ranks of the Dao. He bestowed upon us the eye of wisdom, allowing us to see from afar the Heavenly Worthy descending to this world. Overjoyed and fortunate, we have come to pay our respects and seek your counsel. We only hope the Heavenly Worthy will take pity and instruct us.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, knowing their intent, remained silent and did not reply. The immortals repeatedly entreated, each prostrating themselves upon the ground for a long while, bowing and raising their heads, saying: “We only hope the Heavenly Worthy will extend the power of compassion, take pity, and instruct us, revealing what we have not yet heard.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by their earnestness, commanded the Right Attendant Perfected Youth named Jeweled Form, saying: “What vows do you and this assembly seek, that you have come here?”

Thereupon, Dharma Joy and the great assembly bowed their heads again in reverence and said: “We see the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly of sages, their majesty and virtue solemn and awe-inspiring, as never before. This world now possesses such blessed virtue, yet without a word spoken, the myriad things transform of themselves. Heaven and earth are altered, the climate shifts, sun and moon shine brightly, stars align in proper measure, wind and rain disperse appropriately, the hundred grains ripen, medicinal herbs flourish, sweet springs flow abundantly, beasts leap in dance, beings of all kinds live in harmony, and the people abound in joy—never before has such a thing been seen. We do not know what meritorious deeds the Heavenly Worthy has cultivated to attain the secret and essential Dao of self-mastery over the transformation of the myriad things. We hope you will instruct and reveal it to us.”

Again, they prostrated themselves upon the ground for a long while, not rising.

Thereupon, Jeweled Form returned to the Heavenly Worthy and fully reported their intent.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed them, saying: “The supreme great Dao employs only the power of compassion to give life to and transform the myriad things, sheltering and protecting sentient beings, without speech. If there were speech, it would give rise to form and trace. Though teachings of form and trace may accord with the ultimate Dao, they do not reach the subtlest principle. Why is this? One cannot employ form, trace, or speech to transform heaven and earth and give life to the myriad things. Why? Because form, trace, and speech are not constant in principle. If principle is not constant, how can it bring about transformation? Therefore, the great Dao is without form, trace, or speech, allowing things to transform of themselves.

O good men, you suppose that I have cultivated and practiced to achieve this transformation. If you now cultivate and practice, you too should achieve transformation. O good men, holding such a view, you have not yet departed from afflictions and remain bound in fetters. The supreme great Dao long ago departed from such views, its mind free from knots and bonds, non-active and non-creating, without arising or ceasing, without form or appearance, where speech and the Dao are cut off. What you see as my majestic divine power and virtue, solemn and awe-inspiring in form, transforming heaven and earth and giving life to the myriad things—this is your perverse view, a deluded and discriminating thought. The supreme great Dao is apart from perverse views and the discriminating thoughts of delusion.”

O good men, you speak of encountering the Ancient Master and attaining transformation and deliverance through him. This Ancient Master is my disciple. I sent him to teach and transform the borderlands, expounding the Three Vehicles to extinguish suffering and instructing beings in cultivating the fruits of future lives. Because those lands are difficult to transform, their people lack harmonious qi, their natures incomplete like those of mixed beasts—they drink blood and eat raw flesh, acting with violence and arrogance. Thus, he performed divine transformations, broadly expounded parables, and awakened those of dull faculties. Such methods do not exhaust the ultimate truth but provisionally manifest forms and traces. After the Master departed, he withdrew his traces and returned to the origin, his forms and traces gradually vanishing. Even if some remain, they are largely erroneous. Some style themselves as immortals, others claim to be Brahma Heaven; some sit silently in empty chambers, some burn their bodies to extinction, some plunge from high cliffs, some make offerings to water and fire; some fashion images of heavenly beings with three faces and a thousand hands, or various deities, slaughtering and sacrificing, gathering in crowds to perform rituals, crying out to seek extinction; or they intently observe luminous signs. Such methods are called false and erroneous. Though scriptures may exist, there is no true Dharma in them—orthodoxy and heterodoxy are mixed, and the Way cannot be attained.

Thereupon, Dharma Joy and the great assembly, having heard the Heavenly Worthy’s words, awakened in their hearts. They realized that their previous cultivation had not reached the essentials of the Dao. Again they prostrated and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “As in our land, what we have cultivated accords entirely with the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassionate insight—there is no difference. Yet we fear that our assembly’s karmic defilements are too deep to be saved. We only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to bestow upon us the Dharma-water, gradually to clarify and purify, washing away filth and impurity, opening the gate of expedient means, demonstrating the power of expedient means, granting us entry into the Dao. First, let us hear the rules of deportment and the precepts of fasting, so that we may gradually cultivate them, restraining body and mind, giving them a foundation.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “The land and qi of your region are yin and malign, and the people born there are likewise. Why is this? This is called the Metal Region, where mixed kinds of beings are born in these borderlands. They do not hear the true Dharma but only the parables of the Three Vehicles. They do not know the secret treasury of the great Dao—the celestial scripts in cloud-seal and dragon-chapter, phoenix-brilliance, the methods of sudden teaching to achieve perfection and enter the wondrous with the embodied self.”

Thereupon, Dharma Joy and the assembly, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, feared their lives did not accord with the true Dao. The great assembly wept sorrowfully, kowtowing until blood flowed, and again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “The beings of that land dwell in a rank, foul, and stinking place. How could they hope to ascend and be delivered in this very body, forming a bond with the Dao? We only hope that in future lives we may be born in the Central Kingdom, a land where the Dao abides. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion to bestow upon us the rules of fasting, deportment, and precepts.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy, with the power of great compassion and not refusing their request, addressed them, saying: “The natures of the people of your land are manifold, and they should receive many precepts to restrain body and mind. They are not like the people of the Land of Abandoned Worthies, whose hearts are pure and simple. Even if they receive precepts, they do not exceed five kinds: the first, the Five Precepts; the second, the Ten Precepts; the third, the One Hundred Ninety-Nine Precepts; the fourth, the Three Hundred Great Precepts of Observing the Body. These are called the Four Categories. There are also the Thirty-Six Thousand Precepts of Deportment, which correspond to thirty-six thousand numinous powers. They encompass thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao, within which are thirty-six thousand life-spirits, and without, thirty-six thousand precept-spirits. Inner and outer guard and protect. Those who receive these precepts—if of the highest grade, achieve perfection; if of the middle grade, become immortals; if of the lowest grade, extend their lifespan. These precepts are the Jade Treasury’s Golden Rules, the prohibitions of the Highest Perfected. If one receives them and then lightly violates them, one’s body will be handed over to the dark officials, and nine generations of ancestors will suffer interrogation. Now I will briefly explain one category to you, dividing one category into three grades—high, middle, and low. Within each grade, further divide into three grades, making nine grades in all, completing the yang number. These nine grades of precepts require fasting and precepts together; they are not to be practiced singly or transmitted exclusively. Wherever you hold fasting lectures or establish assemblies, and on the days when kings, princes, great ministers, officials, scholars, men, and women gather for fasting, you should appoint one person with a clear voice to properly compose their deportment, face north, and read the precepts once to the assembly. The great assembly of people should prostrate and listen to the precept-words. Again, at the first night of the fast, read them once more to the assembly. This is the method for a one-day fast. For two, three, or seven days, you should read them once each day. If one is newly entering the Dao, first receive the precepts, and after a thousand days, gradually advance to other methods. If there are virtuous people who have previously committed no transgressions and have not yet been delivered, receive the precepts within three days—there is no need to wait a thousand days before transmitting the Dharma. If, after receiving the precepts, one commits the ten evils or the five rebellious acts, the Dharma-master should burn incense before the Three Treasures and repent, revoking the precepts. If one has not yet received the precepts, or after receiving them commits minor transgressions not among the ten evils, earnestly repent and seek to receive them again. The Dharma-master and disciple should face the fast, perform the six-times-daily prostrations and repentance, vowing never to transgress again, and then, after careful consideration, transmit the Dharma. You must be cautious, you must be cautious—do not violate my precepts, lest you incur the sin of rebellion and the gods not protect you.”

Thereupon, Dharma Joy and the great assembly each prostrated, brush in hand, listening as the Heavenly Worthy expounded the precepts.

**Precept Categories, Fifth Section**

1. **Do not kill**—do not kill for pleasure, in play, for sport, for gain, or by enticement. Do not crave meat to cure illness; even medicinal portions must be entirely abandoned.
2. **Do not rebel against parents or rulers**, or cause chaos and ruin to family and state.
3. **Do not commit robbery**—whether through enmity, slander, or false accusation. **Do not slander**—whether by speech, writing, or formal accusation.

**Precept Categories, Fifth Section (continued)**

4. **Do not expose the Three Luminaries**—do not revile Heaven or curse Earth.
5. **Do not commit incest with kin**, thereby engendering punishment and harm.
6. **Do not destroy the good Dao**, sever others’ bonds of kinship, or extinguish others’ ancestral lines.
7. **Do not indulge in wine**—whether poisoned wine, matchmaking wine, or lustful wine.
8. **Do not harbor secret malice**, harming others through bodily, verbal, or written acts.
9. **Do not encroach upon or exploit the good and virtuous**, or seize from the orphaned and impoverished.
10. **Do not rob or desecrate corpses**, or scatter others’ skeletal remains.
11. **Do not strip the dead on battlefields**, or sever and take their hair.
12. **Do not deceive or exploit the elderly and infirm**, seizing their possessions without compassion.
13. **Do not destroy nests or dens**, or harm embryos and fledglings.
14. **Do not traffic in lives** to enrich oneself.
15. **Do not deliberately observe warfare**, or intentionally incite conflict between states.

These constitute the **Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes**. Those who violate them will suffer manifold torments in this life, and after death, share the same punishment as their nine generations of ancestors, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas.

The Dao states: **In the rites of morning obeisance**, one must not perform obeisance from a high place to a low one; not glance about while performing obeisance; not perform obeisance in an impure state; not face the altar while spitting or sniveling; not gaze upward at the altar; not cast sidelong glances at the altar; not speak loudly at the altar; not raise one’s voice at the altar; not utter mistaken words at the altar; not speak perversely at the altar; not interrupt speech at the altar; not engage in extraneous talk at the altar; not gesture with the limbs at the altar; not touch one’s head while speaking at the altar; not speak with a playful expression at the altar.

The Dao states: **In entering the fasting and precept altar**, one must first cultivate compassion. First, do not harbor secret malice; second, do not dwell on lust; third, do not indulge in lewdness; fourth, do not contemplate killing; fifth, do not crave meat; sixth, do not seek dominance; seventh, do not practice deceit. Only then may one bathe with the five fragrant herbs, washing away worldly defilements, rectify one’s demeanor, and proceed to the altar.

Outside the altar, prepare two bathing areas with fragrant water, one each for men and women. Erect two screened enclosures, burning incense within, and set up proper clothing racks. In one enclosure, remove and hang one’s pure garments. Emerging from the screen, enter the bathing chamber, cleansing the body with towels and bean powder, ensuring all is in order. Do not boil and kill insects or larvae; strain water through silk to prepare broths and beverages. Do not burn worm-eaten firewood for the fast or offerings. Do not allow those who are menstruating, postpartum, afflicted with festering sores or pus, the licentious, or those guilty of the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes to approach the fasting kitchen.

Once the proper offerings are arranged, the master dons pure robes, takes a clean censer with burning charcoal, and kindles incense. After completing the obeisances and sitting in their proper places, they maintain solemn silence, upright and composed, reflecting on the superior precepts with body and mind—first compassion, second mercy, third goodness, fourth faith.

Good men and women, you must now understand: it is through these four principles that I attained the Dao. These four are the gateway to all good Dao, the foundation of all good Dao, the essential mechanism of the Great Dao. Apart from these four, there is no Dao. Thus, I possess these four stages of good Dao to safeguard Heaven and Earth, generate and nurture the myriad things, harmonize the qi and seasons, govern the unseen and visible, avert disasters and eliminate calamities, and rescue those in dire straits. If you abandon these four, you may not enter the altar, nor receive offerings from kings, princes, ministers, or the multitudes; you may not accept reverence and obeisance from kings, princes, or all men and women; nor may you seek blessings or fulfill vows for yourself or others. I decree such a person a thief within the Dao and its laws, unfit to dwell among us, despised by humans and spirits, unsaved by the gods.

Good men, within the altar there are **three further principles**: first, contemplate filial piety; second, contemplate forbearance; third, contemplate humility.

Good men, within the altar there are **seven further principles**:
1. Regard all men and women as your parents.
2. Regard Dharma masters and virtuous people as heavenly beings.
3. Regard the sacred scriptures as rare and precious.
4. Regard the sound of Dharma teachings as difficult to encounter.
5. Regard the sick, poor, orphaned, and destitute as your own self.
6. Regard the frail and elderly as reminders of impermanence.
7. Regard all living beings with equanimity.

Good men, you must now understand: whether entering or leaving the altar, do not abandon great compassion, nor allow the mind to discriminate. Through non-discrimination, no evils arise. In all that you see, hear, know, do, stand, sit, lie, or dwell—apart from these precepts, there is no peace. There is no such thing as attaining the Dao while violating these precepts.

Good men, if you seek the Dao and wish to ascend and transcend this life, there is no such thing as attaining the Dao while violating these precepts. Good men, if you wish to be free from illness and escape the cycle of birth and death, there is no such thing as fulfilling your aspirations while violating these precepts. Good men, if you transgress these precepts, you will be envied by evil forces, punished by royal law, and your life will be cut short—unsaved by the gods.

The Dao states: **Within the altar**, one must not consume meat, nor allow impurity; not engage in excessive speech; not cast sidelong glances; not disrupt the assembly; not eavesdrop; not spit or snivel; not wear light or soiled clothing; not snore in sleep; not sit improperly; not sit with one’s back turned; not gaze upward; not laugh loudly or speak boisterously; not eat with exclamations; not conceal food; not hoard food; not speak while eating; not laugh while eating; not glance about while eating; not eat while reclining; not rinse the mouth while eating; not clatter utensils while eating; not pick at food; not disparage food; not eat repeatedly; not eat at improper times—one should eat at the proper time, with compassion.

Do not walk hastily; do not drag your feet or make noise while walking; do not shuffle your heels; do not move your head or hands while walking; do not glance about while walking; do not look upward while walking—walk with composure and uprightness.

If a Dao disciple receives alms or offerings, accept them with compassion, and do not repeatedly express thanks, repeatedly decline, or repeatedly glance about. Once accepted, make offerings according to the proper rites and distribute them in accordance with the Way.

All Dao disciples, whether men or women, must not frequently enter the dwellings of kings, princes, great ministers, officials, or laypeople. If, for karmic reasons, entry is necessary, maintain proper dignity and demeanor, stand outside the gate, state your purpose clearly, and do not enter their homes or sit upon their beds.

When Dao disciples interact with their parents, uncles, aunts, brothers, or sisters, they should show utmost reverence—how much more so with others.

Unless there is a grave reason, Dao disciples must not enter military camps or bustling markets. Dao disciples, whether men or women, must not enter butcher shops, brothels, places of entertainment, or the dwellings of those who commit the ten evils or the five heinous transgressions.

Dao disciples, whether men or women, must not share quarters, beds, or meals with those of improper kind, nor share clothing or adornments.

Dao disciples, whether men or women, must not keep many attendants out of desire, nor possess defiled writings.

Dao disciples, whether men or women, must not contend with laypeople over profit. If there is profit, it should be yielded to laypeople and to the ignorant, the young, or the weak.

Dao disciples, whether men or women, must not keep weapons or musical instruments, nor burn or fumigate with hides, furs, horns, bones, or foul-smelling substances.

Dao disciples, whether men or women, must not defile living grass, insects, or ants.

Dao disciples, whether men or women, must not relieve themselves facing north, nor look upward while doing so; must not pollute mountains, springs, or pure ground; must not dwell in mixed company, in lowly places, against the wind, in dampness, or without careful protection.

Dao disciples, whether men or women, and all Dao followers should solemnly adorn the Dao sanctuary, maintain halls and quiet abodes with vigilance and secrecy, sweep and cleanse the inner and outer areas, keeping them always pure. They must not sleep late or rise late, miss the proper times for morning rites, neglect proper conduct in matters great or small, or fail to show mutual respect.

Do not open the doors of the quiet abode without reason; do not leave scriptures and teachings exposed; do not return from lay dwellings without washing and purifying; do not allow women or close kin to stay in the Dao sanctuary without grave cause, nor gather with Dao followers without proper reason; do not borrow or lend permanent sanctuary property for other uses.

All permanent sanctuary property—incense, oil, lamps, candles, treasures—should have fixed uses and must not be diverted for other purposes.

Within the boundaries of the pure dwelling, do not allow the entry of miscellaneous livestock or defilement; do not trade in slaves or the six livestock to acquire goods for the quiet abode; do not use wealth obtained through the ten evils or five heinous transgressions to build the quiet abode; do not establish a quiet abode on defiled ground.

Those who violate these precepts will suffer bodily afflictions, fail in their studies, and if they take what is not returned, three generations will be afflicted. Be cautious!

The Dao states: All good men and women should uphold the law both internally and externally, forming a fortress of the law. Do not encroach upon or damage the pure abode; do not strip away its protective barriers.

Do not steal or fell fruit-bearing trees; do not steal the master’s fruit; do not encroach upon the master’s fields; do not waste or deplete the master’s grain or silk; do not damage the master’s ritual implements; do not borrow the master’s belongings and fail to return them for a long time; do not privately expend the property of the Dao; do not privately exchange the property of the Dao; do not privately employ the master’s livestock; do not gather in the sacred precinct to expound heterodox teachings; do not gather in the sacred precinct to gamble or shoot arrows; do not assemble in the Daoist sanctuary to collect alms, eat meat, or drink wine; do not allow women to lodge within the sacred precinct.

The Dao states: If Daoist men or women violate these precepts, the guardian spirits of the law and the Earth Officials will examine and punish them, extending the affliction to three generations. Be cautious!

The Dao states: When Daoist men or women copy the precious scriptures, do not place them in impure locations; do not allow impure persons to see the scriptures; do not allow unbelievers to hear the scriptures; do not allow corrupt persons to know the scriptures; do not allow corrupt persons to see the paper on which the scriptures are written; do not use impure wealth to purchase paper for copying scriptures. The method of copying requires that the scriptures be placed in a separate chamber, with incense constantly burned upon the table. Once a day, wash hands and body with five-fragrance water, and after relieving oneself or changing clothes, maintain constant purity when entering or exiting. Those who copy scriptures must not secretly use or divulge esoteric words, nor chant them aloud. Those who violate these precepts will immediately suffer afflictions, endure the trials of wind and blade after death, and forever be barred from hearing the Dao. Be cautious!

The Dao states: Those who study the Dao and cultivate themselves must first broadly seek scriptures, verify the precepts and regulations, and seek the master’s judgment. Guard carefully what you receive, and do not self-promote or seek worldly gain. Form bonds of like-mindedness—no more than three men or four women—engaging in profound contemplation in seclusion to await spiritual communion. Do not let others become aware of or witness your practices, nor allow their praise or criticism. Withdraw to the mountains and forests, avoiding the company of worldly people. Those who violate these precepts will not be protected by benevolent spirits, and myriad demonic forces will disturb and afflict them. Be cautious!

The Dao states: If any virtuous man seeks to heal illness, he must first broadly prepare Daoist arts, clearly understand the principles of medicinal formulas, and carefully follow the rituals of fasting and jiao offerings. He must uphold the precepts, practice forbearance, and not violate the nature of things. He should not shrink from hardship or toil, nor shun day or night, regardless of distance, treating foe and kin with equal regard. He must not regard wealth or beauty, nor discriminate between high and low, male and female, nor demand repayment in spirit or material. Should repayment come unexpectedly, he ought to devote it to meritorious deeds and not hoard it for personal gain. He must not create difficulties, harbor no deceit in his heart, and ever practice great compassion. Those who heal illness in this manner will move the heavens with their merit, and their cures will be swift. If one violates the regulations and precepts, fabricating falsehoods, spirits and humans will swiftly punish them, and they will descend into hell upon death. Be cautious! Be most cautious!

The Dao states: If any virtuous man or woman has a heart inclined toward the Dao, yet encounters unfavorable times and cannot journey to famous mountains, they should uphold the precepts at home, construct a refined abode, and build thick walls with double partitions so that sounds inside and out cannot be heard. Let it be kept pure and meticulously maintained, no different from the mountains and forests. When merit is fulfilled and practice perfected, the Dao will come to the secluded chamber, and the body will attain the true Dao. If one violates the regulations and precepts, carelessly reveals secrets, allows foul odors or impurities to mingle, or exposes sacred texts, their efforts over countless years will be in vain. They will not hear of my Dao, their body will swiftly collapse, and myriad demonic forces will slay them. Their body will not attain the Dao, and their soul will suffer punishment. Be cautious!

The Dao states: If a student of the Dao, having received the master’s teachings and been entrusted with sacred texts, encounters a time when the destiny aligns and the law demands service to the state—whether already holding office before meeting the master or receiving the supreme law afterward, yet unable to attain pure emptiness—should they assist in governing the people and aiding the realm, they must inwardly uphold the precepts and guard carefully what they have received. They must not recklessly reveal celestial patterns, lightly transgress prohibitions, lack filial piety or compassion, indulge in harsh punishments, covet wealth, or exploit the people, causing the hearts of all under heaven to harbor grievances and bitterness. Such a person bears only the name of aiding the realm but lacks the virtue of integrity. They will suffer three kinds of punishment: first, the supervising spirits within their body will confuse their mind, leading all their endeavors to ruin; second, the spirits governing the state will cause them to break the law and face execution; third, the officials of the earth will examine them, and their misfortune will extend through seven generations. You must be cautious of this.

All the immortals, having received the precepts, rejoiced and leapt with joy, deeply counting themselves fortunate. Each rose to pay respects, faithfully accepting and practicing them.

*Thus concludes the first scroll of the Supreme Dao Jade Clarity Scripture.*
*Beginning the second scroll of the Supreme Dao Jade Clarity Scripture.*

**Chapter Six: The Skillful Means of Compassion**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, together with all the great sages, was in the empty void of the upper realms. Through skillful means, wishing to deliver sentient beings, he entered the Great Samādhi of Formless Great Emptiness by the power of great compassion. Though the assembled immortals possessed spiritual powers, they could not perceive him, nor did they know his whereabouts, and so they believed the Heavenly Worthy had returned to the upper realms.

The immortals were filled with sorrow, regret, and distress, unable to compose themselves. Each saw his own body devoid of majesty and virtue, like a corpse; moreover, the elephants they had ridden transformed into putrid flesh. The assembly was bewildered, their minds in turmoil, knowing neither how to advance nor retreat, uncertain what to do. Each entered meditation, carefully observing causes and conditions, yet their minds remained clouded, unable to comprehend. It was as if they had entered a dream, seeing various phenomena without any certainty or reality.

Then the celestial charioteers addressed the assembly: “Our merit and virtue are meager, our Dao-power weak. We have not yet fully grasped the subtlest principles. Having only just begun our practice, our cultivation is insufficient. Though we possess spiritual powers, we cannot perceive clearly. We must abandon all we previously knew and saw, and take refuge in the formless void. Perhaps through our devotion, we may once again behold the Heavenly Worthy.”

Hearing these words, the immortals gained slight understanding. Each concentrated their minds, recollecting and taking refuge in the Great Emptiness. For seven days and seven nights, they bowed their heads in reverence, making vows without rest. In an instant, their minds awakened, as if rousing from sleep. Looking up into the void, they suddenly saw the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly of sages, majestic and unmoving, no different than before.

The immortals bowed their heads in worship, repenting their faults and reproaching themselves. They offered thanks to the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We, this great assembly, have for kalpas uncountable cultivated narrow views and fragmentary understanding, discriminating with deluded thoughts, lost in confusion and perverse views. Deeply entangled and bound, our offenses are grave. We saw our own bodies like corpses, devoid of radiance, our mounts transformed into rotting flesh, the jewels in our topknots turned to shards of tile. Unpredictable changes befell us, leaving us bewildered and disoriented, as if seeing forms in a dream, unable to distinguish reality. We knew not what to do, but resolved in our hearts to abandon all we had previously known and seen, to take refuge in the Great Dao, and turn toward the void. Repenting our faults and reproaching ourselves, after seven days and seven nights, our minds suddenly became calm, as if awakening from a dream. Our joy is boundless. We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will take pity on us and open our minds to awakening.”

Before the immortals had finished speaking, the Heavenly Worthy once more entered the Great Samādhi of Radiant Light. His entire body shone with brilliance, like the unobstructed sun. He caused the assembly of sages to each ride a feathered canopy, seated upon flying-dragon thrones, at the tip of a single hair on his left brow. He further caused all the immortals, along with the lands of the ten directions—the mountains, rivers, seas, cities, and people—to abide within a single hair on his right brow, yet without any sense of confinement. Each saw the Heavenly Worthy before them as he expounded the wondrous Dharma. When the immortals beheld this, their perception was clear and unobstructed.

They also saw their former dwelling in the sacred mountain, which now seemed close at hand, though six kalpas had passed. They had been unable to recognize the Heavenly Worthy’s boundless and unobstructed divine power.

Then, with a single sound, the Heavenly Worthy universally addressed all beings, each awakening according to their kind. The Heavenly Worthy asked the immortals: “You have witnessed this power of the Dao. What do you make of it in your hearts?”

The immortals replied: “We, this great assembly, know only the joy of hearing the Dharma. Our minds perceive nothing else.”

The Heavenly Worthy continued: “The compassionate power of the Great Dao is neither real nor illusory, neither arising nor ceasing, neither empty nor existent, neither this nor that, without going or coming. It is called the self-existing power of the Middle Way, the power of great compassion, the unobstructed power. It brings peace to the minds of the immortals, leaving them unaware and unknowing, able only to hear the Dharma, with no other perception.”

Hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, the immortals began to awaken. The assembly snapped their fingers in unison, marveling at what they had never before encountered.

The Heavenly Worthy then addressed the immortals: “You must now understand that the majestic power of the Great Dao is beyond measure, without comparison. Among all other teachings, it is like fireflies compared to the sun and moon, or a handful of water compared to the great sea. You should rejoice in the Dharma. You, the ancient masters who have entered the gate of the Dao, practice the Three Vehicles, but these are merely names without fixed reality. They abound in similes, teaching those of lower capacity. They do not transcend birth and death, nor do they ensure enduring existence. Though you may see blessings in your present form, with bones and flesh ascending together, this is not the eternal Dharma of the Perfected Ones—the body like true gold, unchanging; like vajra, indestructible.

“Good sons, the teachings of similes are for instructing the foolish beings of border regions. Those of middle and superior capacity should not cultivate them. For thousands of lives, you drift through suffering, unable to transcend the river of birth and death’s attachments. It is like planting weeds in fertile soil, which will never yield the five grains. The teachings of similes are likewise unable to lead one to the attainment of the true Dao.

“Good sons, I know your minds are confined to lesser teachings, lost in delusion and straying from the true path. Thus, I gathered you here to awaken you. Good sons, though you dwelt on Snow Mountain for hundreds of years, without cultivating the Great Dao, you would not escape death and would surely fall into hell. Though you call yourselves immortals, you lack the essence of immortality. By your past good fortune, you have now seen me and received this further deliverance. This is your karmic affinity; you are destined to receive rebirth.

“Good sons, though you have been here for six kalpas, by my Dao-power, I have condensed these six kalpas into six days.”

Moreover, I perceive these six kalpas as but a single instant.

“Good sons, the majestic power of the Great Dao is inconceivable; even were one to expound upon it for kalpas unending, it could not be exhausted.”

Thereupon, Fa Xi and the assembled immortals, their doubts unresolved, addressed the Heavenly Worthy once more: “Formerly, we received the Heavenly Worthy’s compassionate power, awakening us to teachings never before heard—unprecedented Dharma. Our hearts rejoice beyond measure, yet we know not how to express our gratitude.

“We, benighted and confined by our limited perceptions, have taken these as the ultimate truth, unable to fathom the boundless. The supreme Great Dao is profound, wondrous, and deeply mysterious; its majestic spirit vast and unobstructed, transcending all thought.

“Our dust-laden burdens remain unsevered, our habitual tendencies deeply ingrained. Yet by good fortune, we have encountered this noble assembly and met with this auspicious time, casting off our defilements and filth to attend upon your celestial presence. We only pray for your compassion, to accept our already-lost lives and revive these polluted bodies, that we may bathe in the mysterious transformation.”

Then, the entire assembly bowed their heads until blood flowed, prostrating upon the ground for a long while without rising. The Heavenly Worthy, moved by great compassion, addressed them: “Though you have heard my teachings throughout these six kalpas, you remain unenlightened—such is the weight of your defilements. Why is this? The beings of borderlands subsist on raw flesh and blood, devouring sheep and horses alive. Though the ancient sages refined and purified them, residual habits persist, causing this to be so.”

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthy, through the power of great compassion and skillful means, suddenly caused one thousand two hundred and fifty white elephants to merge into a single elephant. He then caused one thousand two hundred and fifty immortals to coalesce into one immortal, who sat atop this elephant. Furthermore, he condensed the lands of the ten directions into a single realm, no larger than a mote of dust, wherein all beings and the great assembly were gathered into one person, dwelling within the infinitesimal space of this dust-mote.

In an instant, the two within the mote beheld a true person, a thousand feet in height, of extraordinary countenance, leading eighty-four thousand great sages into the mote. The two emerged from the tip of the mote, then re-entered through the left brow’s tip, returning to the Heavenly Worthy’s original presence. The thirty-six thousand of the great assembly entered through two points at the right brow’s tip, moving freely within and without, unconstrained and unconfined. For nine days and nine nights, their minds knew no weariness, as if but a moment had passed, unaware of any change, no different from before. The two, desiring to hear the Dharma, rejoiced in body and mind.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke again: “Good sons, in former times you formed affinities with the Dao, yet your merit was slight and your deeds shallow; the powers you attained were not true. Mountains yield fine jade, yet in the south there is a stone also called ‘jade.’ The two names are confused, and ordinary people cannot distinguish them, unaware of which is true jade. You who call yourselves immortals are like that stone-jade, not true jade—only those of wisdom can clearly discern the difference.

“Good sons, the pearl in your topknot is in truth a fish’s eye, not a true pearl. You, likewise, are not true immortals. Good sons, from this day forward, bathe in the Dao’s transformation, purge your dust-laden burdens, and only then shall you be called true and upright, only then shall you enter the current of the Dharma.”

Upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, the two exclaimed in awe, saying: “Today we are fortunate indeed, to have encountered the exalted Worthy and received the true Dao, awakening us, dispelling our afflictions like a snake shedding its skin.”

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by great compassion, addressed them: “Where now are all your assembled followers?” The two, at a loss for words, looked about and saw only the true person and the great sages seated upon dragon thrones, with but a single elephant remaining. They also beheld the lands of the ten directions close at hand before them. A glimmer of understanding arose in their minds, recognizing this as the Heavenly Worthy’s sovereign power.

Perceiving their thoughts, the Heavenly Worthy said: “Through my Dao-power, I take pity on you suffering beings, guiding you with skillful means and revealing these divine transformations to awaken your minds.” In an instant, all was restored to its original state. The great assembly, too, became aware of the coming and going of these manifestations. Such is the sovereign, divine power of the Dao—beyond conception.

It is not to be fathomed by the five supernatural powers, the three vehicles, the seven factors of enlightenment, the eight gates, or the three realms. It transcends thought, perception, knowledge, and awareness; it is neither existent nor non-existent, neither arising nor ceasing, neither cause nor effect. It cannot be spoken of, cannot be conceived; it is beyond all language, beyond all sight and sound. Only the ultimate power of the Dao fully penetrates all Dharma, leaving nothing unpervaded.

“Good sons, know this: though I manifest such transformations, my mind—from beginning to end—has never perceived them as transformations, as a single phenomenon. It is but the great compassion of a single childlike thought, universally delivering all beings.

“Good sons, though I deliver beings, my mind—from beginning to end—has never harbored the thought of delivering beings.

“Good sons, the power of the Great Dao, the spirit of the Great Dao, the transformation of the Great Dao, the mechanism of the Great Dao, the subtlety of the Great Dao, the emptiness of the Great Dao, the namelessness of the Great Dao—all are inconceivable. Liberation is inconceivable; knowledge and vision are inconceivable; skillful means are inconceivable; creation and transformation are inconceivable; arising and completion are inconceivable; activity and function are inconceivable.

“Good sons, you should cultivate a mind of rarity, a mind of rejoicing, a mind that cherishes the difficulty of encountering such teachings. Perfect your shame and reverence—all is inconceivable.”

Thereupon, the immortals, filled with joy and praise, exclaimed: “Our great assembly, bathed in the Heavenly Grace’s life-giving torrent, knows a joy beyond compare—like parting heavy clouds to behold the sun and moon, like a blind man seeing forms and colors, like a caged bird soaring freely, like a small fish swimming in the vast river and sea, like dry bones restored to life. Our boundless joy is lofty beyond description.”

At that moment, the Heavenly Venerable, moved by their earnest devotion, bestowed upon the one thousand two hundred and fifty individuals the office of True Youths, entrusting them to record the merits and transgressions of newly ordained Dao practitioners throughout the world, inscribing the ledgers of life and death. For the sake of karmic conditions, the assembly of thirty-seven thousand two hundred and fifty sages all radiated bodily light, illuminating the boundless worlds of the ten directions. Incense, flowers, banners, canopies, and ten thousand kinds of celestial music filled the air as the great earth trembled.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable and the assembly of sages each took their seats upon nine-colored cloud-dragon thrones, floating into the void and departing. In the vast, dark world below, the king, princes, ministers, and countless people gazed from afar as the Heavenly Venerable and the sacred host ascended toward the southeast. In an instant, streaming rosy clouds filled the four directions, and their whereabouts became unknown.

The men and women of the kingdom, now awakened, looked at one another in grief and weeping, repenting their past faults and reproaching themselves. In that world, there was a king named Zhenhui, wise and eloquent, who addressed the multitude, saying: “Do not grieve. Hear my words. Long ago, I once heard of the True One of Emptiness and Non-Being, who creates and transforms heaven and earth, gives life to the myriad things, wields divine power with ease, and dwells in profound stillness, enacting transformation without speech. The auspicious signs in our world must be the blessing of this True One of Emptiness and Non-Being, causing all this to be so. Now, we and all people should repay this grace. Let us seek the most exalted site in the gardens and erect a palace, offering incense and flowers in worship.”

When the people of the kingdom heard the king’s words, they spoke with one voice, all praising the plan. Each removed the priceless pearls from their bodies to pave the ground, and took fragrant woods to construct the palace. Towering and vast, it was adorned with a hundred treasures, furnished with various thrones, and arrayed with flowers, incense, lamps, and candles—every kind of offering, all the wealth of the world was poured forth.

From afar, the Heavenly Venerable perceived their intent and extended the ten-colored true light from the palm of his left hand, illuminating the palace. Morning and evening, it shone as brightly as daylight, and a constant fragrance pervaded the world. The people of that land, in dreams, beheld the Heavenly Venerable, who expounded the Dao to them, clarifying their minds and bodies. Upon awakening, they recorded the words in writing. When the people of the kingdom compared and verified the texts, the writings all matched perfectly, without a single discrepancy. Thus, they transcribed these words as the *Scripture of the Spontaneous Dao*.

Thereafter, the people redoubled their diligence. The kingdom knew great peace, the people prospered and rejoiced, and none died young. Moved by these extraordinary signs, where the unseen and visible worlds aligned, all cultivated with utmost devotion. Though without teachers, they refined their own minds, attaining immortal ranks and gradually merging with the subtle and wondrous—all inconceivable.

At that time, through the power of the Heavenly Venerable’s three great vows, the salvation of beings was accomplished, and his transforming presence knew no partiality. With the great assembly, he descended to the borders of the earthly realm and the abyss’s depths, entering a small heaven within the void. This heaven spanned six thousand seven hundred and fifty-four *li* in circumference, with a height of one hundred and ninety-nine *li*.

Within this realm, the transforming sovereign was named Immeasurable Life, and he had three great ministers: the first was named Virtue King, the second was named Abandoning Depravity, and the third was named Cloud Melody. All governed the world with the true Dharma, never wronging the people.

The men and women here stood seven *cun* tall, all discerning and clear-minded, wise and intelligent, filial and obedient to their parents, and reverent toward their transforming sovereign.

In this heaven, long ages past, the era was called the Dragon’s First Assembly. The Void-and-Without Heavenly Venerable commanded the Perfected of Creation and the Immortal of Vast Spirit to descend into this heaven, spreading boundlessly. They established a tranquil altar, inscribed jade tablets with script, and thereby secured this heaven. From then on, the people of this land cultivated the Daoist arts. By virtue of these merits, some were later reborn in the Middle Kingdom, changing their surnames to Yi, and were called divine youths—keen of mind and sharp of wit. Whether in one body, two, or no more than three, they encountered the Heavenly Venerable and attained deliverance, achieving immortality and never dying.

At that time, Dharma Joy and the twelve hundred and fifty divine youths, their minds unsettled by doubt, rose from their seats, stepped forward, and bowed. They addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: “We do not yet understand—how many kalpas have passed since the Heavenly Venerable spoke of the Dragon’s First Assembly? The Void-and-Without Heavenly Venerable commanded the Great Perfected of Creation to disperse primordial *qi*, transforming it into the ten thousand things. By what principle, through what method, was such effortless mastery attained? We beseech the Heavenly Venerable to take pity on our ignorance and instruct us in these unheard-of, unprecedented teachings.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable, moved by their earnestness, replied: “Good sons, this assembly took place in an age so remote that it spans the number of fine dust-motes in a hundred million worlds—an incalculable kalpas. Only the Dao and the Dao can truly know it. Even the fivefold-perfected immortals consider this a distant time. What I have witnessed does not exceed the fleeting instant between a downward glance and a blink. If you wish to know, the principle is this: the Dao of primordial *qi* is not something you have heard before.”

Then Dharma Joy and the great assembly bowed their heads again and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “Disciples were born in the defiled realm, our studies impure, our minds dull and deluded. We met a skilled master by chance, yet clung to narrow, partial teachings, our vision confined to shallow and cramped views. Our spirits were dimmed, our minds deeply obscured. Who could have foreseen that the sun, impartial in its radiance, would disperse the mist, illuminating the dark? The Dao does not bestow favoritism, yet in your compassion, you spoke of the Dragon’s First Assembly, resolving our doubts about the origin of primordial *qi*. We beg you to reveal its mysteries, that we may taste the sweet dew, revive what is withered and decayed, bestow divine talismans, and restore life to dry bones. Disciples and the assembly rejoice beyond measure. We never dared hope to ride the swift winds of rosy clouds, ascending to the mysterious gates, bathing in your transforming grace. Our hearts, forgetting all bounds, press forward—yet we know we have erred. We implore your forgiveness.”

As they spoke, the entire assembly wept, the earth trembled, and the sun lost its brilliance. In the empty sky above, a sound like a dragon’s roar arose. All people, winged insects and crawling creatures alike, joined in lamentation. Grass and trees withered, metal and stone lost their luster, fragrant clouds lingered and congealed in the void. A divine wind surged, and harmonious *qi* failed to flow smoothly.

Then the divine youths, moved by the resonance of heaven and earth, and the sorrow of all beings, were joined by the men and women of the land in their entreaty, all longing to hear the Dharma.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable, moved by their devotion, emitted a thousand rays of light from his mouth, illuminating all heavens and penetrating every realm. Heaven rained fragrant blossoms, and myriad sounds arose spontaneously in the air. The sun and moon shone doubly bright, a gentle breeze swept away the dust, and immortal flowers blanketed the earth. Canopies of rosy clouds veiled the sky, divine bells rang clear, true apparitions manifested on all sides, dragon scales gleamed, and lions uttered soft roars. Jade censers burned incense, and the divine youths scattered fragrant smoke. Heaven and earth proclaimed auspicious signs, and all beings united in harmony. The ten directions’ lands became radiantly visible. Heavenly sages from all realms descended through the void, and earthly immortals emerged from beneath the ground, all gathering in this heaven. The gods of heaven and earth, the lords of mountains and seas, and the kings of all beasts came to the assembly to listen to the Dharma.

Then the Heavenly Venerable cleared his throat, snapped his fingers, and addressed them: “Good sons, you asked about the Dao of primordial *qi* and its origin. Listen carefully now, and I will explain. Good sons, you should know that the Dao of primordial *qi* originates with the Void-and-Without Heavenly Venerable. It arises from emptiness and is naturally self-existent, enduring without end. It transforms and gives birth to primordial *qi*, primordial *qi* gives birth to the Supreme Ultimate, the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth, and heaven and earth give birth to the ten thousand things.

Good sons, the Dao of primordial *qi* is wondrous in this way. Thus, the Great Dao has no name, and primordial *qi* has no form. Because it is nameless, its activity is boundless. It flows and changes endlessly, and all—sentient and insentient—are born by virtue of the Dao. Those who treasure primordial *qi* endure forever. Primordial *qi* is spirit; when united with *qi*, one can enter the formless and merge with the true Dao.

Good sons, though the ten thousand kinds differ, primordial *qi* is one. It is like the great sea, boundless in its flow, allowing all to draw from it as they will. The wise dig deep channels to guide its current, enabling endless irrigation. The foolish clutch leaky vessels, approaching the river and sea, yet gain but little moisture. Some, like the blind, never see the sea at all and receive no benefit.

Good sons, you should know that the nature of water is still, yet its moisture varies in depth. The Dao of primordial *qi* is likewise—beyond conception.”

Then all in the great assembly, hearing the Heavenly Venerable’s words, opened their minds and understood, awakening to the principle of the formless and subtle. At that moment, heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, heavenly gods, earthly deities, and all creatures—winged, crawling, and moving—joined their voices in unison, like thunder, and praised:

“The Great Dao neither arises nor perishes,
Primordial *qi* never ends.
Those who lose it decay forever,
Those who attain it wander long.”

Gazing down upon the Six Directions,
all drift in the currents of birth and death.
Looking up to those within the rosy clouds,
they dwell in serene freedom, without sorrow.

Once this hymn resounded through the void, in but a moment, five-colored streaming rosy clouds gathered in the sky a hundred *zhang* above the earth, spontaneously forming the cloud-script of the Eightfold Celestial Writ. Each character measured a *zhang* square, its eight corners trailing radiant beams, their brilliance dazzling, illuminating the empty sky. The great assembly of people looked up at the celestial script, reverently prostrating in worship, and all spoke with one voice:

“This is the spontaneous true *qi* of the Heavenly Venerable, the primordial *qi* of the true youth responding to resonance, transforming to produce these words. We have only heard of the celestial writ but never beheld it with our own eyes—today, by fortunate chance, we have unexpectedly seen it. We dare not presume, Heavenly Venerable: though we are dust-laden and defiled, may we transcribe this celestial script, read and recite it?”

The Heavenly Venerable replied: “This is formed by the transformative power of the Great Dao’s majestic spirit. If you wish to transmit, transcribe, and venerate the true writ—its dragon-script and phoenix-characters—if you wish to worship, recite, and uphold it with single-minded devotion, you must first receive the precepts, refine your conduct, and distance yourselves from all defilement. Only then may you transcribe, receive, uphold, read, and recite it, in strict accordance with the precepts.”

Upon hearing the Heavenly Venerable’s instruction, the great assembly rejoiced and leapt with joy, faithfully accepting and vowing to practice. They bowed in reverence and departed.

**Chapter Seven: The Kalpa of the Auspicious Dragon—Expedient Means for Delivering Beings**

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable of the Golden Tower in the Jade Purity Heaven, together with the assembly of great sages as numerous as motes of dust, all embodied boundless compassion. With the six penetrations, they responded to transformations with effortless mastery, their divine power unhindered, enduring endlessly without beginning or end. In subtle resonance with the workings of the unseen, their refined perception was exquisitely attuned. Ever with the One Dao, they manifested in countless forms, adapting to each kind to bestow long life.

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable, through the power of great compassion, constantly roared the thunder of the Dharma to awaken beings, causing them to awaken. Ever did they cover beings with great clouds, shielding them from exposure. Ever did they moisten beings with the rain of the Dharma, quenching their thirst. Ever did they stir beings with the wind of compassion, establishing their roots of faith. Ever did they illuminate beings with the sun of wisdom, dispelling their darkness. Ever did they act as vast ferries, providing crossings, guiding beings to fulfillment, transporting them endlessly, nurturing, sheltering, and protecting them as their guiding teacher. With earnest instruction, like parents cherishing their children, they bestowed precious treasures upon all, allowing each to take what they needed, without the slightest reluctance.

Yet beings, unaware, turned to resentment and blame. Losing the Dao and corrupting virtue, they fabricated benevolence and righteousness, drifting with their karma, never turning back. Bewildered, they strayed onto crooked paths, forsaking the true Way. Each clung to their own heterodoxies, their five viscera assailed within; following evil factions, they contended with the six thieves without. Love and dust veiled them, their afflictions and knots multiplying. For the sake of the self, they created the three kinds of karma. Gradually, these multiplied until they committed the ten evils. A hundred blessings fled far away, and at death, they fell into the Nine Dark Realms, enduring every suffering. From attachment and love they arose, yet could not comprehend—how pitiable they were!

Unable to abandon them, the Heavenly Venerable earnestly taught and guided in myriad ways, lifting and leading them, preventing them from straying into perversity.

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable and the assembly of great sages, moved by compassion for beings, cared for them as a loving mother cherishes her child. Though the child might wander afar, the mother’s thoughts would inevitably turn to them, hastening to their side, providing food, shelter, and protection until they grew to maturity, never abandoning them. How much more so for an infant, whom she nurses morning and night, responding to their needs and wishes without fail.

At that time, six million years after the Kalpa of the Auspicious Dragon, the blessings of the people beneath the Four Heavens were exhausted. Heaven and earth collapsed, calamitous *qi* obscured the sky, the sun and moon lost their brightness, the stars deviated from their courses, wind and rain fell unseasonably, heaven and earth quaked, rivers and seas shrank, metals and stones scorched and withered, springs and sources dried up, the earth split open everywhere, mountains crumbled, ghosts wailed, medicinal herbs ceased to grow, trees withered and fell, the hundred grains bore no fruit. Black winds tore up houses, whirling sand and stones that struck together, sparking fires that burned across mountains and marshes.

A hundred thousand evil ghosts, each leading countless followers, raced across the world, breathing fire from their mouths that seared out people’s eyes. Birds fell from the sky, the six livestock died of themselves. Four great pythons, each six million *li* in length, coiled around Kunlun Mountain, their mouths gaping in the four directions. From the scales of these serpents emerged a hundred billion smaller snakes that scattered in all directions. Their venomous *qi* was fiercely potent—whoever was bitten instantly rotted away. Such suffering endured for six hundred years, and beings were utterly afflicted.

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable, together with an assembly of great sages as numerous as motes of dust, in the first year of the Mysterious Transformation, the year *xinmao*, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, at noon, within the Cloud Palace of the Jade Purity Heaven, all emitted divine radiance that illuminated the lower realms, the domains of the Four Heavens. The light transformed into countless millions of rays, each ray containing a boundless, vast Dao realm. Within each were sun, moon, and stars, mountains and rivers, cities and towns, towers and palaces—all surpassingly magnificent. Each city and tower was encircled by springs and pools, from which golden lotus blossoms emerged. A gentle breeze stirred the flowers, releasing wondrous fragrance that suffused the empty sky. The flowers, towering and grand, rose from the Jade Purity Heaven. Within each flower floated a dragon throne. Upon each throne sat a celestial perfected great sage expounding the wondrous Dharma. Around the springs and pools stood jeweled trees, their branches of jade and coral, their canopies casting shade over the world. Seven-jeweled leaves and night-shining pearls adorned them. A gentle breeze stirred the jeweled trees, and from their leaves arose wondrous sounds, chanting the *Spontaneous Brahma Hymns of the Void*, the *Precious Chapters of Spirit-Generation*, and the *Stanzas of Soul-Return*, harmonizing the Three *Qi* to generate and transform the myriad things. Above the void, condensed light of nine colors formed a jeweled canopy that filled the world.

Beneath the palace terraces, seven *qi* floated in the void, upholding the celestial halls. On all four sides of the palace, within the dark emptiness, arose spontaneous music—resonant, clear, and pure, surpassing all harmony and elegance. Upon each terrace, perfected beings chanted the *Hymns of Congealing Embryos and Primal Transformation*, nurturing the myriad things and dispelling calamities.

At that time, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month at noon, the Heavenly Worthy and a host as vast as the motes of dust in the Great Microcosm descended together from the Cloud Palace within the Jade Purity Heaven, floating through the void into the four heavens above the morning stars. The Dipper’s jeweled chariot bore his divine feet, the Eastern Dipper supported his left, the Western Dipper his right, the Northern Dipper served as his parasol, and the Southern Dipper as his footstool. The sun attended upon his left, the moon upon his right. Floral canopies cast their shade, fragrant clouds enveloped the four directions, divine winds harmonized the void, sweet dew flowed in streams, heaven and earth returned to their places, mountains and peaks surged into being, the source rivers flowed clear, the bitter seas turned pure, the four *qi* harmonized, the three luminaries shone equally, withered bones became immortals, the dying were reborn, the hundred grains ripened in abundance, and the world knew great peace. Demons lost their essence, the true Dao spread abroad, the wicked turned to goodness, and humans and spirits alike upheld purity. Vast and boundless was this transformation—beyond naming.

Then, beneath the four heavens, kings, princes, ministers, consorts, and all officials, along with the countless men and women, both human and non-human, each gazed upward into the dark emptiness above. From afar, they beheld the Heavenly Worthy’s true form—radiant and resplendent, his divine countenance serene and luminous, his light shining brilliantly, his august visage majestic. A jeweled canopy filled the sky, long banners fluttered, dragon censers wafted incense, spirit-fragrance revived the dead, and myriad sounds joined in unison with celestial music. All entreated the beings to deeply recognize the causes of their karma.

At that moment, those who witnessed this marvel felt shame welling within, desiring to offer reverence and gratitude. Yet they doubted the distance was too great, fearing their prayers might not ascend. In their hearts, they silently wished, entreating the exalted Heavenly Worthy and great sages to descend their cloud-borne chariots to the impure earth. Each remained in their dwelling, turning their thoughts upward, bowing their heads in devotion, their blood and tears staining the ground. For nine days and nine nights, they burned incense and scattered flowers, their prayers unceasing. Though exhausted and their spirits dazed, as if in a dream, they did not falter.

Moved by their sincerity, the Heavenly Worthy then divided his body into a hundred million forms, each seated upon a cloud-dragon throne. Before each being, he appeared, adapting his voice to their kind, expounding the Dharma so that all might awaken. Throughout the four heavens below, none were excluded—all were as one.

In an instant, the four heavenly kings, each with a retinue of ten thousand myriad beings, heard the Heavenly Worthy speaking the wondrous Dharma within their own hearts. Their bodies and minds rejoiced, filled with joy and peace. Though overjoyed, they could not fully comprehend. Each bowed in reverence and asked the Heavenly Worthy about the origin of the Dharma-sound within their hearts, saying: “We, your servants, are blessed beyond measure to behold the Heavenly Worthy descending to the lower realms and bestowing upon us this wondrous Dharma. We bear the profound grace of your compassionate favor, yet we are deeply ashamed, not knowing how to repay it. Moreover, we hear the Dharma-sound arising within our hearts, and our bodies and minds are at ease, filled with joy and peace. We do not understand—what is the cause of this?”

Then the Heavenly Worthy replied to the kings: “Excellent, excellent, good sons! You should know that the awe-inspiring power of the supreme great Dao is inconceivable, omnipresent. Why would the Dharma-sound reside only within your hearts? Even within your limbs, pores, and hairs, as well as in heaven above and earth below, within every mote of dust and blade of grass, the *qi* of the Dao abides.

“Good sons, you kings should feel deep shame. Within your hearts, let the Dharma-mind ever observe, removing your perverse views, your wayward thoughts, your restless cravings, and your greed and attachments. Bathe in the Dao, cleansing away the dust of your burdens. Ever practice great compassion, reverently offering devotion to the supreme great Dao. Uphold the precepts, give alms, cultivate patience and diligence. When the defilements of affliction are exhausted, the wondrous light of the Dao-nature will manifest among you.”

At that time, all the kings and their peoples beneath the four heavens simultaneously beheld the Heavenly Worthy’s earnest teachings. For a long while, they gathered their thoughts, their bodies and minds unmoving.

In an instant, each saw the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion, together with the host of sages, erecting within their hearts, limbs, pores, and skin countless banners and canopies, innumerable as the motes of dust, emerging in perfect order. The banners and canopies were vast and boundless, filling the world.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion, with these banners and canopies, guided all beings to the Kunlun Mountain within the four heavens. They halted in the void, ten thousand *ren* above the earth, entering the space within a single fine hair. There, with the great assembly, they sat in solemn stillness for nine days and nine nights. Divine light shone brilliantly, illuminating the void, and a great thunderous voice expounded the wondrous Dharma. Its sound carried far, pervading the ten directions without exception.

To all beings, he proclaimed in verse:
*The great Dao is ever compassionate,*
*Pitying all sentient beings.*
*The supreme Dharma universally transforms,*
*Both those who practice and those who do not.*
*I originally have no form or appearance,*
*Yet through movement, names and shapes arise.*
*Now, I freely allow your questions,*
*Responding to your thoughts with teachings.*
*Provisional and real—no dual wisdom,*
*Mysterious and quiescent—the one true essence.*
*The primordial qi flows widely,*
*Encompassing the insentient and the sentient.*

When the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion had spoken these words, he sat in silence with the great assembly.

Then, from the Azure Heaven of the East, the Heavenly Children, led by the Heavenly Child of No-Mind, arrived with their retinue—a host as numerous as the motes of dust in nine billion great lands—all to hear the Dharma. Bearing the treasures of the Azure Heaven and offerings, they burned incense, scattered flowers, and performed celestial music. Mounting their heavenly palaces, they raised azure standards, azure banners, azure canopies, and azure veils, seating themselves upon azure clouds at the highest peak. Their canopies stretched boundlessly, floating through the void to arrive.

By the power of the Dao’s majesty, they entered the infinitesimal realm, encircling, extolling, bowing, and greeting. Arranging the celestial regalia and offerings, they withdrew and sat facing east, solemn and unmoving.

Then, from the Vermilion Heaven of the South, the Heavenly Children, led by the Heavenly Child of Blazing Radiance, arrived with their retinue—a host as numerous as the motes of dust in eight billion great lands—all to hear the Dharma. Bearing the treasures of the Vermilion Heaven and offerings, they burned incense, scattered flowers, and performed celestial music. Mounting their heavenly palaces, they raised vermilion standards, vermilion banners, vermilion canopies, and vermilion veils, floating through the void to arrive. By the Dao’s spiritual power, they entered the infinitesimal realm, encircling the Heavenly Worthy to chant praises, bow in reverence, and present offerings. Arranging their majestic regalia, they withdrew and sat facing south, solemn and still.

Then, from the Luminous Heaven of the West, the Heavenly Children, led by the Heavenly Child of Pristine Truth, arrived with their retinue—a host as numerous as the motes of dust in six billion great lands—all to hear the Dharma. Bearing the treasures of the Luminous Heaven and offerings, they burned incense, scattered flowers, and performed celestial music. Mounting their heavenly palaces, they raised pristine standards, pristine banners, pristine canopies, and pristine veils, floating through the void to arrive. By the power of the Dao’s compassion, they entered the infinitesimal realm, encircling the Heavenly Worthy to chant praises, bow in reverence, and present offerings. Arranging their majestic regalia, they withdrew and sat facing west, solemn and unmoving.

Then, from the Mystic Heaven of the North, the Heavenly Children, led by the Heavenly Child of Profound Wisdom, arrived with their retinue—a host as numerous as the motes of dust in five billion great lands—all to hear the Dharma. Bearing the treasures of the Mystic Heaven and offerings, they burned incense, scattered flowers, and performed celestial music. Mounting their heavenly palaces, they raised mystic standards, mystic banners, mystic canopies, and mystic veils, floating through the void to arrive. By the power of the Dao’s compassion, they entered the infinitesimal realm, encircling the Heavenly Worthy to chant praises, bow in reverence, and present offerings. Arranging their majestic regalia, they withdrew and sat facing north, solemn and still.

Then, the great spirits of the Eight Seas and the Dragon Kings, Lords of Waters, arrived to hear the Dharma, riding towering waves that surged to the heavens. By the Dao’s spiritual power, they floated through the void and stationed themselves at the four quarters of the infinitesimal realm, vast as great clouds.

Next, the Five Emperors and the Earth Deity, with their retinues numbering five myriad billion worlds—each world complete with mountains, rivers, seas, lands, and peoples—came by the power of the Dao’s majesty to hear the Dharma. They gathered beyond the infinitesimal realm, standing with the Eight Sea Spirit Kings in the empty void, serene and still.

Then, the Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Primordial Sovereign Dao Lord of the Void, arrived to echo the Dharma, accompanied by innumerable sages from the ten directions, assembling upon golden clouds in the sky, five hundred *ren* distant from the infinitesimal realm. When the two assemblies had fully arrayed themselves, the Central Dao Lord summoned the divine winds to stir the celestial pipes, intoning the subtle verses of the *Empty Cavern* and the numinous hymns of *Pacing the Void*. The thirty-seven thousand kinds of perfected beings in attendance chanted for ninety-nine days before concluding.

Then, within the infinitesimal realm, the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion commanded the nine myriad myriad immortals of the Grand Tenuity to wield the six myriad forty-two thousand four hundred and twenty talismanic verses of the *Returning Soul* and *Dispelling Demons*, along with the *Yin-Generated Melodies*, harmonizing the multitudes for eighty-eight days until the symphony was complete.

When the Heavenly Worthy had accomplished these two tasks in full detail, he sat in silence with the assembled sages.

At that moment, the Eight Sea Great Spirits and the Five Emperors and Earth Deity were suddenly seized by doubt and disbelief. The Heavenly Worthy, perceiving their hesitation, employed his compassionate power to cause the earth and waters to overturn and reverse seven times. He then made the great earth quake, split, and shatter into motes of dust, only to instantly restore it, compact as a mustard seed. He further caused the Eight Seas to scatter their waves, suddenly drying them utterly, exposing the forms of the Water Lords, dragons, and fish. In an instant, he reduced the Eight Seas to a single droplet, fine as a needle’s tip, and blew it into the void. In the blink of an eye, he restored all to its former state.

Witnessing this sovereign transformation of power, the Earth Deity and the Eight Sea Great Spirits were overcome with awe, though by the Dao’s power, they could not fathom the nature of all dharmas. Why? The earth and waters are yin in substance, and their spirits’ minds are dull; thus, they could not comprehend. After a long while, their minds stirred slightly with understanding. Then, beyond the infinitesimal realm, they prostrated to the north, repenting and reproaching themselves. Their five limbs pressed to the ground like a collapsing mountain, their bodies bathed in blood, weeping bitterly for a long time.

Thereupon, the Earth Deity addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “I, born in darkness and obscurity, am charged with upholding the earth. Though I oversee the nine lands without rest, I ride the Dao’s upright qi to nurture the myriad beings, aiding virtue and fostering transformation. I dare not falter in my toil, yet for the sake of all dust-like beings, I have failed to attain the Dao. I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to bestow great compassion and mercy.” Having spoken, he wept uncontrollably.

Next came the great spirits of the Eight Seas, the dragon kings and their retinues, and all the water-dwelling beings—numberless in their multitude. The Dragon King of the Black Pearl, keenest of wit among them, led the chorus of aquatic deities. Rising upon the waves, he addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying:

“By great fortune, I am entrusted with the watery realm, aiding the passage of boats and ferries, moistening all below, and assisting the Dao in its transformative work, washing away filth and cleansing dust. Though I have rendered slight service, my heart knows no reliance. Day and night, I am submerged, adrift in the surging waves. My coarse and massive form cannot ascend lightly, bound as I am to the turbid qi. Yet my perception is narrow and feeble, and I have not attained the profound and subtle. For years uncounted, I have yearned for the Most Venerable. Now, by the divine power of the Dao, I have come to this assembly to hear the Dharma, yet beyond the merest hair’s breadth, I cannot enter. My heart is filled with doubt and uncertainty. I beseech the Heavenly Worthy, by the power of great compassion, to grant me guidance and reception, that I may enter the infinitesimal.”

Having spoken, he reproached himself, his waves surging and overflowing, the waters rising to the heavens in tumult. His lamentation boiled forth, his sobs dark and mournful, his grief bitter and profound. In an instant, all rivers and seas seethed with blood. The Five Emperors and Earth Ancestors trembled, the great earth quaked, sharing in his sorrow. Metal and stone wept, grasses and trees shrouded themselves in mist, springs flowed backward, and the earth itself groaned like thunder. The beings within the earth quaked in terror, their eyes unable to blink. Birds fell from the sky, beasts flung themselves to the ground. The Five Emperors and Earth Deities wept blood from both eyes, staining the vast earth. The land and seas turned crimson, like a dawn of cinnabar, the hue lingering for eight months before fading.

At that time, the great spirit-kings, the deities of heaven and earth, thunder and lightning, wind and storm, gathered for the Dharma. Their winds and thunder roared, their lightning flashed with fierce brilliance, startling the creatures in their deep burrows, uprooting all things by their roots, and sweeping away the dust to assemble from the four directions, halting in the empty sky.

Then, too, the various kings of the earth—kings of great mountains, fragrant trees, divine herbs, fish, turtles, birds, horses, oxen, lions, wind-beasts, fierce beasts, celestial unicorns, celestial birds, celestial horses, celestial deer—all followed the great earth to the assembly. Though their ears heard the Dharma, their mouths could not speak. Seeing the divine spirits’ sorrow and anguish, they too wailed in grief, their eyes streaming blood, each prostrating upon the ground, unable to rise.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by the divine spirits’ entanglement in impurity and their inability to hear the true Dao, their suffering so profound, spoke to them in a voice like thunder:

“Excellent, excellent! You should now understand the nature of this assembly and the cause of its arising. I say to you: after six million years following the kalpa of dragons, when the blessings of heaven and earth are exhausted and calamities arise, unable to bear the sight, I and the great sages descend to the four continents to safeguard the kalpa, renewing the myriad beings and responding to the mandate to deliver humankind. Thus, I have come to this assembly. By my sovereign divine power, I have summoned you here. You should know that the great assembly gathered here has entered the infinitesimal from the boundless Dao-realms of the ten directions, yet it is not cramped. How then can the multitudes of your five trillion worlds—your great earths and eight seas—be considered vast? To doubt that this infinitesimal can contain you is a sign of your spirits’ impurity, evil views, and narrow minds, your failure to deeply trust in the awe-inspiring power of the supreme Dao.

If you wish to enter this infinitesimal realm, you must cast aside distracting thoughts, afflictions, attachments of love, greed, anger, and delusion, all inverted and perverse views, all doubts and hindrances of worldly toil. Sever all fettering habits, and only then may you enter this wondrous assembly. If you cling to perceptions and distinctions, judging good and evil, harboring enmity or affection, you will remain bound and forever barred from this subtle and marvelous gathering.”

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, employing his skillful means to subdue the divine spirits, declared:

“Your spirits’ transgressions are deep, your impurity and defilement profound. You have not yet entered this wondrous assembly. You must reflect and distance yourselves from dust and filth. In the future, you may behold me.”

Having spoken these words, the Heavenly Worthy emerged from the eastern cloud-gate of the infinitesimal. With his left hand, he gathered the great earth and mingled it with the sea waters, compressing them into a single mustard seed. He cast it into the empty void above, where it remained serene and unmoving for eighty thousand great kalpas.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, within the infinitesimal, expounded the subtle and wondrous Dharma to the great assembly. After eighty thousand kalpas, when the teaching was complete, he retrieved the mustard seed from the empty void above and placed it upon the tip of the infinitesimal, restoring the great earth and seas to their original state. The Earth Deity, Water Emperor, human kings, and all beings remained unaware.

Then, perceiving that the hearts of these spirits had not yet awakened, the Heavenly Worthy manifested a vast form filling the empty sky. From the left side of the infinitesimal, he emerged with measured steps. With the tip of a needle, he drew in the great earth and seas, placing them within the infinitesimal’s northern void. Like a single speck of dust in the vastness of space, it caused no obstruction.

At that moment, the dragon spirits of the Eight Seas and the earth deities entered the infinitesimal, circling the Heavenly Worthy for kalpas uncounted, yet still unable to encircle him, even in flight. Only then did they awaken, marveling at what they had never before witnessed.

Within the great earth, kings, ministers, common folk, and all manner of beings who had entered from the earth remained unaware, perceiving neither departure nor arrival. Within this infinitesimal, there were boundless Dao-realms, each layered upon the next. Each realm contained all things—heavens and earths, suns and moons, mountains and rivers, seas and lands, countless peoples—numbering thirty-six thousand kinds of human and celestial beings.

At that time, among the assembly were twelve thousand kinds of beings from the Central Pillar, and among them was an elder named Wisdom-Life. Together with the great multitude, they beheld this divine power yet could not fathom it. Supporting one another, they came to the gathering place, bowed in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:

"We do not understand: when the Heavenly Worthy first descended from the heavens, within the palaces, towers, lofty pavilions, and lotus flowers, did the Heavenly Worthy—the Great Sage—and those who first heard the Dao each have the Heavenly Worthy expounding the wondrous Dharma within their bodies and minds? And did the Compassionate Heavenly Worthy emerge from their hearts in tranquil majesty, surrounded by jeweled trees and spontaneous celestial music? And within this infinitesimal speck, were there lands and cities, banners and jeweled canopies, each seat lofty and wondrous, with such extraordinary transformations? We do not know—is this a matter of constancy or impermanence?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent, good man! Listen carefully, and I shall explain. When I descend from the heavens to the realm of ordinary beings, I manifest seven kinds of subtle and wondrous phenomena. You should know that the Supreme Great Dao always descends to transform the world through the Seven Awakening Sagely Ways, responding to the seven subtle and wondrous qi of spontaneity to accomplish the seven transformative Dharmas. Because the world is limited, the Great Dao responds with names and numbers—these names and numbers all correspond to the subtle and wondrous Dharmas of spontaneity.

Good man, you ask whether this wondrous attainment is constant or impermanent. You should know that the Dharma of the Great Dao is neither born nor destroyed. How then can one ask whether it is constant or impermanent? Good man, the divine power of the Great Dao leaves nothing undone, is nowhere absent, adapts to all circumstances, and responds to all things. Its true transformations are boundless, its spiritual roots profound. It pities the multitudes, manifests palaces in response, and even the slightest causes and conditions are not worth questioning. If it wills existence, it exists; if it wills non-existence, it ceases. If it wills constancy, it endures; if it wills cessation, it is cut off. Through the divine power of the Dao, nothing is obstructed.

You further ask whether the Heavenly Worthy within the lotus is my true qi, vast and pervasive—whether this is my own essence, not that of another sage. You also ask about those who first heard the Dao: when the wondrous Dharma-sound emerges from their bodies and minds, is this because the first human king to hear the Dao deeply believed and matured in faith, free from all attachments? Is this very body thus transformed into the Dharma-body, with all its bones and nine orifices infused with the Dao’s qi, making this person’s body no different from the Dao? All in this assembly are likewise so. Therefore, the Great Dao, in its compassion, manifests within their bodies.

Good man, you also doubt the myriad wonders within this wondrous assembly. You should know that the Great Dao takes this infinitesimal speck as one Dao-realm, and from one Dao-realm creates boundless Dao-realms—these realms are constant. Why? Ordinary beings call them impermanent, but the Sagely Way of constancy names them constant. Why? Because the lifespan of ordinary beings is uncertain, and due to this uncertainty, they deem the Great Dao impermanent. Yet the Sagely Way of constancy endures eternally, clearly illuminating the constant Dao.

Good man, if one were to speak of the constant Dao to ordinary beings, their minds would be filled with doubt, inverted views, and the growth of unwholesomeness. Therefore, the Great Dao adapts to conditions and responds to potentials. Why? Because the ordinary beings of the lower realms are diverse, their natures and dispositions varied. Those of the highest grade who hear the Dao devote themselves to cultivation, attain true immortality, and never regress—they are taught the constant. Those of the middle grade who hear the Dao have not yet fully believed, their minds wavering—they may be taught either the constant or the impermanent. Those of the lowest grade who hear the Dao give rise to slander—they are taught the impermanent, and their perceptions are likewise.

Within this wondrous assembly, the Celestial Perfected Sages name it constant, yet the Dharma they expound may be either constant or impermanent. Why? Because the Celestial Perfected Sages teach the Dharma to the demonic spirits, gods, and miscellaneous beings in this assembly as impermanent. Good man, the infinitesimal is likewise so. Ordinary beings do not perceive the constant Dao, do not comprehend its wondrous principle, and cannot attain the subtle and true ultimate. Though they ride the power of the Dao and temporarily enter diligent practice, they may later regress—this is called impermanent. The Heavenly Worthy and Great Sages are free from mental fetters, emerging from emptiness and entering the formless, never obstructed—this is called constant.

Good man, the majestic power of the wondrous Dao is inconceivable. Because it is inconceivable, it can cause all things in the ten directions—heavens and earths—to enter the infinitesimal, without constraint or confinement. Good man, if the power of the Supreme Dao were conceivable, then the myriad things of heaven and earth could not enter this wondrous assembly. Good man, you should know that all the sages and multitudes who enter this assembly dwell in the inconceivable, in liberation and wisdom. Why? Those who enter this assembly do not enter with the body, nor with the mind; they do not act with the body, nor with the mind; they do not enter through principle. It is solely through the power of the Great Dao’s compassion, forbearance, and patience that they are able to enter this infinitesimal assembly."

Then, the elder Wisdom-Life, together with his retinue of twelve thousand kinds of beings—a multitude as numerous as motes of dust—heard the words of the Heavenly Worthy. Their minds opened in understanding, and they bowed again in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy, offering this hymn of praise:

"We bow to the Dark Wisdom, the Venerable of Emptiness,
We bow in devotion to the Lord of the Profound Mystery.
You fashion heaven and earth, yet cannot be named,
For all beings, You are the refuge and support.
Compassionate, You deliver the souls of the Five Paths’ turning wheel,
Pitying and rescuing those suffering in the Three Realms’ hells.
We devote ourselves to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Palace,
To the Compassionate Father of the Six Perfections.
We devote ourselves to the Supreme Perfected of Jade Purity,
Who transcends birth and death, eternally enduring.
Emerging from existence, entering emptiness, beholden to none,
You transform the withered and decayed into immortals.
Once in a thousand, ten thousand kalpas is such an encounter,
For the multitudes, You broadly expound the causes and conditions of karma."

Restoring the dead to life, granting eternal abiding,
You make my form and spirit free from change and decay.

Then, Elder Wisdom-Life, having spoken this hymn, prostrated himself fully to the ground, bowed in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy, and addressed him thus: "We do not know how many kalpas have passed since the Heavenly Worthy attained the Dao. What virtues have you cultivated? How have you reached such majestic heights? By what karmic conditions have you attained deathlessness? By what virtues do you deliver those suffering in hell?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Since I attained the Dao, the number of kalpas has been like the dust motes of the ten directions’ heavens and earths—incalculable. It is like empty space, immeasurable. Good man, I cultivate great compassion and great mercy, vowing to deliver all beings. I constantly practice forbearance and gentleness, never losing harmony and balance. Thus, I do not die. I constantly use the Six Perfections to deliver those in hell. Good man, though I have attained the Dao, I still do not depart from compassion, forbearance, and gentleness—how much more should ordinary beings do so?"

Then, Elder Wisdom-Life, together with his retinue of twelve thousand kinds of people, having heard the Heavenly Worthy’s words, rejoiced with great joy. They bowed their heads again, prostrated themselves before the Heavenly Worthy, and said: "By deep and abundant past blessings, we were born in this age of the Dao’s transformation. We have beheld the Compassionate Worthy face-to-face and heard the sound of the Dharma with our own ears. Yet our minds were once dim and dull, and though we received the secret essentials, we forgot much. Though foolish and ignorant, our hearts love virtue and the Dao. We fear that our bodies will decay and age, and we will not long remain. We constantly worry that one day we will suddenly be like ants, our bodies perishing into endless darkness, with no way to see the Dao. Once the root of life is lost, we will drift for ten thousand kalpas. Now, by good fortune, we have encountered a lofty sage. We wish to be delivered. We beg to receive the Dao of long life and enduring vision. We only hope that the Compassionate Worthy will bestow the gift of life."

Having spoken these words, they prostrated themselves fully to the ground, striking their heads in sorrow and weeping until their bodies streamed with blood. The Heavenly Worthy remained silent and did not consent. Then, the twelve thousand kinds of people, as numerous as dust motes, fainted in despair, beating their breasts upon the ground. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by their earnestness, rose and helped them up. After a long while, they revived.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "All of you, in past kalpas, once made offerings to the True Immortals of Emptiness and the Hosts of Virtue and the Dao. The blessings from this flow into your present lives, and your names are recorded in the left register. Moreover, our Dharma assembly has descended to teach in kalpa after kalpa. It is by this karmic condition that you have encountered me. You should diligently focus your minds, cast aside worldly entanglements, and retreat to fast and reflect on your faults. Return after three months, and I will transmit to you the essentials of the true Dao and long life."

Hearing this, the people rejoiced and leapt with joy. They bowed in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy and returned to their homes, washing away worldly dust and purifying themselves inside and out. When the three months had passed, each brought incense, flowers, and offerings, and came to the assembly place.

At that time, in the dust-mote worlds of that assembly, all the kings, princes, ministers, common people, men and women—numberless—heard that Elder Wisdom-Life was to request the essentials of the Dao. Together, with one voice, they addressed the Heavenly Worthy and spoke this hymn:

"Our hidden affinity is fundamentally impartial,
Yet it responds to karmic conditions as they arise.
We wish to attain the Dao of long life,
To scatter and sow it in the fields of our hearts.
The water of the Six Perfections’ pure source
Flows boundlessly without shore."

When the great assembly had spoken this hymn, they all prostrated themselves at once, together requesting to receive deliverance.

At that time, the Five Great Demon Emperors, seeing these people prostrated and requesting the Dharma, each played stringed instruments, sang songs, and struck up music. After a long while, they ceased.

Then, the Great Demon Emperor of the Blue Realm spoke this hymn:

"To cultivate the Dao, one must accumulate merit.
To enter the trial depends on the heavenly demons.
Do not let your body commit transgressions,
Or I will vainly sing in the empty sky.
In an instant, I will seize your form—
Who then could resist me?
First, you must send away all desires,
Bathe and rinse in the recesses of famous mountains.
Do not be a person of the dust,
Hastening and hurrying in the waves of the world."

The Demon King of the Red Realm spoke this hymn:

"The Flaming Palace illumines the cinnabar skies,
Bright and clear, its radiant qi floats.
Evil winds stir the turbid dust,
Ever swirling without cease.
My realm is difficult to cross—
Whether you leave or linger, the time is now.
Merit and transgression distinguish themselves clearly;
The demons do not forcibly seek them."

The Demon King of the White Realm spoke this hymn:

"The Silver Palace emerges from the Great Void,
Its circular net illumines the night’s glow.
Ten thousand times it recites the numinous chapters,
Guiding wandering souls to follow the qi and return.
Those who turn their backs on the Dao enter the dark tombs,
Where bitter mists ever swirl.
Love and attachment waste the spirit;
The buried corpse loses all hope of flight.
My realm will not permit passage—
The demons vainly lament in the empty sky."

The Demon King of the Black Realm spoke this hymn:

"The mysterious sap nourishes the jade roots,
The jade liquid refines the true form.
As the setting sun returns to Fusang,
Form and spirit never decay.
Why then betray virtue and the Dao,
Ever grieving over rot and decay?
Who among the Six Heavens seeks to preserve you?
At the brink of peace, you turn back to greater peril."

The Demon King of the Yellow Realm spoke this hymn:

"The Cloud Palace, serene and remote, emerges from the cinnabar skies,
Floating through the void, its flying canopy ascends at dawn.
Secretly aligned with the numinous source, the six qi soar,
In emptiness, the true master naturally summons.
The celestial thoroughfare is lush with purple mist,
The mysterious path is swift with rosy clouds.
Who knows the suffering of sinking in my realm?
Why hesitate and refuse to transcend?
The world naturally drifts into long night—
It is not that the demon hosts forcibly invite you."

When the Five Great Demon Emperors had sung these songs, each emitted fragrant qi from their bodies to envelop the people. They also played five hundred kinds of demonic sounds to confuse the minds of the assembly. They raised demonic banners to disturb their eyes. Some appeared as beautiful women, inviting in various ways. Some took on strange forms, unknown in the world. Some emitted light from their bodies, illuminating a hundred miles. Some uttered terrible sounds, making the hearers’ hair stand on end. Some spat fire from their heads. Some walked on empty space. Some entered the earth. Some transformed their forms—old or young—skilled in creating illusions, their qi striking against people. Some touched people with their bodies. Some transformed into human shapes, or into people’s relatives and old acquaintances, flattering in various ways. Some entered people’s bodies, causing them to attain concentration, their eyes able to see clearly, their minds knowing the karmic conditions of two lifetimes—past and future. Their demeanor was extraordinary, and they skillfully expounded the essentials of the Dharma, confusing and disturbing people’s minds.

Yet the great assembly at this gathering, through the divine power of the Dao, focused their minds unwaveringly. The demons could not defeat them.

In an instant, the Five Great Demons of the Five Directions, along with their retinues, withdrew their awe-inspiring power. Facing north, they stood in attendance beside the Heavenly Worthy, reverently still to hear the Dharma.

At that time, the celestial beings of the Eastern Azure Heaven, rejoicing to hear the Dharma, leapt with joy. Through the divine power of the Dao, they aided and encouraged those of later generations, strengthening their resolve. They sang in praise to gladden their hearts and guide them to the true Dao, chanting:

*"At Fusang, the first rays dawn,
Lush and verdant, the green sprouts rise.
Divine qi floats o’er the cosmic net,
Spirit birds illumine the purple haze.
Attaining the Dao of eternal life,
They dwell in the silent, true abode."*

Next, the celestial beings of the Southern Vermilion Heaven sang:

*"Fiery qi floats o’er the crimson sky,
True light shines with numinous signs.
Flying auroras gleam like eightfold jade,
Divine nectar transforms to frost-like pearls.
Ninefold radiance glows in sacred vessels,
Streaming hues illumine the Dark Capital.
Eons pass in the blink of an eye,
Yet form and soul never wither.
Ascending, they enter the Great Subtlety,
Nine generations escape the long road."*

Then, the celestial beings of the Western White Heaven sang:

*"Mysterious truth halts the fading light,
The setting sun returns to its first glow.
Divine nectar sprinkles golden streams,
Suddenly draped in robes of flowing haze.
Vast and boundless, they return to the Supreme Emperor,
Misty and ethereal, they ascend the Purple Tenuity.
Guiding their chariots of divine light,
They merge in flight as eternal immortals."*

Next, the celestial beings of the Northern Dark Heaven sang:

*"Whirling the net, they tread with divine steps,
Soul and spirit assist true essence.
To the right, they support the White Prime Lord,
To the left, they guard the Everlasting Hero.
Mysterious nectar exhales numinous streams,
Auras of light follow the moon’s birth.
Thus do they regulate the children of the years,
Neither decaying nor inclining."*

At that time, the celestial beings, for the sake of hearing the Dharma, enriching sentient beings, aiding the Dao with expedient means, unfolding the great transformation, liberating the living, and realizing the fruition of the Dao, chanted these hymns of praise in natural tones to instruct those of later generations who seek to attain the true Dao. By reciting and contemplating them, secretly seeking the true accord without reckless disclosure, they would surely achieve the Dao without doubt.

After these hymns were sung, each returned to their original seats.

Then, the Supreme Sage Primordial Sovereign of the Central Upper Realm, the Heavenly Worthy of the Void, along with the assembly of sages, manifested as an echo of the Dharma to establish great faith. They protected and cherished those reborn in the world, guiding them to rectitude, dispelling chaotic thoughts, and leading them into the current of the Dao, forever free from birth and death. Thus, they came to dwell in the empty space above, in perfect accord with the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity Heaven in the wondrous assembly, responding and transforming in the lower realms, rightly stabilizing the celestial origin. Through kalpas unending, they have appeared—not only today.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of the Void, for the sake of liberating beings, descended from the empty space above into the wondrous assembly with the hosts of sages from the ten directions, each riding celestial palaces. They arrived at the assembly of Great Compassion, sitting to the left of the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion on a shared seat—vast and towering, its summit reaching the limits of the ten directions. Through the power of compassion, even the tiniest hair’s original form remained unmoved, and the great assembly within it felt no constriction, as if unchanged from before.

At that time, the radiance of the two Heavenly Worthies’ bodies surpassed the rising sun, and the assembled sages shone likewise. To liberate sentient beings, they displayed the power of great compassion and expedient means. From the feet of the sages, light emerged in myriad transformations, gradually illuminating their entire forms until their bodies became translucent, like crystal. They gathered all heavens and earths, sun and moon, stars, mountains and rivers, seas, lands and peoples, and all sentient beings, lifting them into the instep of the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion’s left foot, within a single hair’s tip.

In an instant, they ascended to the instep of the Heavenly Worthy of the Void’s right foot, within a single hair’s tip. Then, in another instant, they rose into the empty space, nine billion miles above the earth, directly before the golden beak of the Heavenly Worthy of the Void. The Heavenly Worthy exhaled a subtle breath of fragrant qi, and all those heavens and earths crumbled into motes of dust, filling the void. Then, with another command, they reassembled as before.

In an instant, the Heavenly Worthy lifted all heavens, earths, and peoples into the empty space, directly before the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion. With the divine power of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy blew upon these heavens and earths, causing the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, seas, cities, peoples, birds, and beasts to merge into a single body, as small as a mustard seed—round, luminous, and translucent, indestructible as vajra. Then, in another instant, they were lifted into the palm of the Heavenly Worthy of the Void, within its lines, transforming into light and qi.

Within this light and qi, four kinds of qi appeared—clear, turbid, white, and black. Within the lines of the Heavenly Worthy’s palm, they gradually differentiated and expanded: the clear qi became heaven, the turbid qi became earth, the white qi became the sun, and the black qi became the moon. The sun became the essence of yang, the moon the essence of yin, giving rise to male and female, from which all things were transformed and born.

At that time, the celestial beings in the assembly witnessed this divine transformation and marveled, never having seen the like. Then, the Celestial Being of No-Intent from the Eastern Azure Heaven, for the sake of sentient beings, rose from his seat, advanced, and bowed. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: *"We beg to know—by what cause and condition did the Heavenly Worthy perform this divine transformation? By what cause and condition were heaven and earth destroyed and formed? By what cause and condition were things made to enter the void?"*

"By what cause and condition do things emerge from the void? This disciple’s understanding is shallow and fails to grasp the ultimate principle. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to bestow insight into the wondrous workings. May you show compassion and instruct us in what we have never heard."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of the Void replied in verse:
*"Originally, for the sake of human blessings exhausted,
I descended to the four heavens below.
The true body is fundamentally ever-quiet,
Yet for beings, it responds to the illusory.
Transformations arise from pity for the living,
And lamentation cannot cease.
When the kalpa arrives and heaven and earth are destroyed,
Their formation arises from this body of mine.
Unable to bear witnessing such suffering,
I descend to the world to display my majestic power,
Guiding beings to return to their root,
That they may truly believe in karmic conditions.
The dust and turbidity naturally dissolve into emptiness,
Following the Dao to become perfected immortals.
Once all worldly burdens are fully dispelled,
The pure and limpid remain untouched by the rest.
Forever severing the path of birth and death,
They emerge serene into the Great Void."*

Then, having spoken this verse, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of celestial beings, saying: "Good sons, you should know that the method of delivering beings must not be taken lightly. Through the compassionate power of the Dao, one must first manifest various divine transformations to subdue their minds, observe their capacities, and then perform the appropriate method. I constantly show compassion, guiding them by the left hand, though I display breath and influence, I do not allow them to be startled or terrified. Though I manifest these various divine transformations of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, their fundamental nature remains profoundly still and unchanging. I have never forcibly performed divine transformations—it is simply through the one Dao, the one method, the one power of compassion for beings that, according to their capacities, they perceive various phenomena, though the nature of this Dharma is truly not manifold.

Good sons, you should now understand that the methods for delivering sentient beings are also manifold. The Heavenly Worthy, through the great sage’s divine power and self-mastery, employs skillful means to liberate them without their awareness—this is called the treasury of the Dao’s skillful means. Worldly ordinary people, when aiding goodness and transformation, propagating the Dao and its teachings, necessarily rely on written words, speech, and parables. Without these, there would be no way to gain their trust.

Good sons, at this assembly, I now deliver all men and women, inscribing them upon the left register. These multitudes attaining the Dao, I subtly circulate the qi of life to render them deathless, gathering all demonic trials to eliminate their disturbances."

At that time, the Venerable Elder of Wise Life, together with the great assembly, heard the Heavenly Worthy’s words, and their minds opened in awakening. All attained the six penetrations and the supreme fruition of the Dao. Then, the Five Thearchs of the Great Demons, witnessing the Heavenly Worthy’s power of the Dao, transformed in body and mind for the good. With their retinues, they advanced, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "We ghosts and spirits, receiving our unfortunate retribution, are born into perverse paths and lack self-mastery. Some are employed by heaven and earth, roaming the four heavens below to carry out poisonous harms; others are invaded by those who expose transgressions, recording sins in the ledgers, testing the newly initiated, and verifying the truly upright."

Their ceaseless toil knew no respite. Yet ashamed of their foul, restless bodies and grotesque forms, they harbored a private devotion to the Dao, reproaching themselves day and night. Filled with remorse and shame, they longed to beseech the Heavenly Worthy for the gift of transformation, to join the current of the Dao, and cast off their demonic forms—even in death, they would have no regrets. They implored the Heavenly Worthy to bestow the grace of the Dao’s revelation, to broadly deliver all without limit, that humans and spirits alike might be universally liberated.

Having spoken thus, they leapt into the empty sky, soaring six thousand *zhang* high, then hurled themselves to the earth, their bodies streaming blood. All the demons simultaneously expired. The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, after a long while commanded the Incense-Bearing Golden Youth to burn the *Returning Soul Incense* and fumigate the demons. He then ordered the Supreme Harmony Immortals to disperse the *qi* of life, the Six Jia Attendants to bestow the talismans of *yin* rebirth upon the demons, the Lord of Life Dao Master to summon their hun-souls and po-souls, and the Master of Transformed Forms to alter their demonic bodies.

After a long while, the demons revived, their forms and spirits transformed, their essence and vitality pure and harmonious, their minds simple and unadulterated. Filled with great compassion, they attained the rank of the Dao’s portion and, in reverse contemplation, perceived the events of ninety thousand kalpas to come. All this was wrought by the power of the divine talismans.

The demons, now in attendance upon the Heavenly Worthy, bowed in gratitude for the gift of rebirth, leaping and rejoicing with delight. Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy bestowed upon the demons—five hundred million in number—the office of *Lingren*, commanding them to advance in the methods of the Primordial Upper Dao.

*Thus concludes the second scroll of the* Jade Clarity Scripture of the Supreme Great Dao.

**Chapter Eight: The Salvation of the Netherworld**

At that time, the *Lingren* and all others, having received deliverance and ascended to the realm of the Dao, felt shame and remorse in their hearts. They reflected thus: "Unlooked-for, in a single moment, we encountered the Heavenly Worthy, our bodies transformed and reborn, forever freed from affliction. We bear the grace of the Dao’s favor—such boundless mercy! In our private thoughts, we vow to rely upon the majesty and numinous power of the Dao, widely extending its reach to both the hidden and the manifest, swearing to deliver all from peril and hardship. We shall proclaim the teachings of the Dao, ensuring they never cease."

They spoke among themselves: "Recalling our past, we met no fortunate conditions, mired in filth and defilement, revolving endlessly through birth and death, falling into depravity, never hearing the true Dao. In those times of suffering, to whom could we turn? Though we now grieve and lament, the pain lingers in our hearts and eyes. Though we have been saved, we have not forgotten our former sorrows. Moreover, we fear that the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, is bound to the Upper Primordial, while those below in the lower realms are meager in fortune, steeped in impurity and evil. The Perfected Immortals, dwelling in emptiness, will not long remain in the world. Though we in this assembly have received deliverance, there yet remain the Nine Netherworlds, where suffering spirits languish unseen by sun or moon, trapped in endless night through countless kalpas, with no means of liberation."

Then the *Lingren* of the Eastern Azure Emperor advanced, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We humbly ask whether the Heavenly Worthy’s boundless transformation and deliverance extend to the Nine Netherworlds, freeing those in suffering from their torment. We, your disciples, remain ignorant and have not yet attained understanding. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy, in your great compassion, to deign to explain, that we may awaken."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent, *Lingren*! Your question is not amiss in its great compassion. I manifest a responsive body and descend to transform and deliver the suffering souls in the hells—those not of the ten evils’ category, who may yet receive rebirth. But if their sins are deep and grave, there are limits beyond which the Dao’s transformation cannot reach. Why is this? Those who commit the ten evils bring calamity upon themselves; none other inflicts it. They invite misfortune and guilt, falling into hell. Some, in their lifetimes, did not heed their teachers’ instruction or encounter scriptural teachings; others were born in borderlands, meeting no good companions, knowing only theft and killing, committing all manner of unlawful acts, and so died to enter hell. Such persons’ sins are relatively light. Even those born in the central lands, though foolish, have heard the Dharma, yet still transgress in life and die to enter hell. These, in the cycle of birth and death, never believe in the Dao, following their own natures to create evil karma, revolving through retribution. They are like worldly men, fierce and stubborn, unafraid of death; though threatened, they remain unshaken—what can be done? Or like children who love play, heedless of their parents’ admonitions; though given treats and taught, their hearts do not change; even if beaten, they do not awaken. Those who commit the ten evils are likewise. Or like flies drawn to rot and stench, their nature compels them, and they cannot change. Those who commit the ten evils are the same. Like moths rushing toward light, they bring about their own burning destruction. Those who commit the ten evils are the same.

*Lingren*, know this: where those who commit the ten evils dwell, many evil companions abound. They skillfully devise means to contrive wicked deeds, and through such causes and conditions, they mislead and fall into evil. Moreover, they instruct their families, wives, and children to act unrighteously, perpetuating their wicked ways. Through such causes and conditions, the living and the dead become entangled, mutually bearing one another’s burdens. When descendants seek peace, sinful spirits endanger them; when sinful ghosts seek escape, descendants hinder them. The retribution of karma in birth and death is like a wheel, its end unseen. Trapped in endless night, there is no liberation; they suffer ceaselessly, never knowing rest.

*Lingren*, know that the Great Dao is ever-diligent, never abandoning even these. Yet beings, unaware, instead grow resentful and harmful. They do not practice the supreme Dao’s methods, nor do they follow its majestic rites and precepts. They refuse to embrace purity and emptiness, instead plunging heedlessly into the turbid filth of the world. They indulge in sensual pleasures, chasing after distraction, gluttonous for rich flavors, seeking sustenance through devious means. Merchants and traders take only treacherous paths, never once treading the safe and level Way. They kill living beings and harm lives without shame. Seeking only warmth and fullness, they hoard without limit; when impoverished, they harbor thieving hearts. They devise a hundred schemes to fulfill their desires, harming others to benefit themselves, never reflecting or retreating. In life, they perform no good deeds, only accumulating evil day by day. In death, they enter hell, their souls enduring retribution, suffering every torment. They bring calamity upon themselves—what can be done? Though the Dao is ever-diligent, the ignorant do not follow.

*Lingren*, know this: it is like the spring rain, which moistens all things, yet there are withered trees that do not receive its nourishment. Those untouched by the rain only rot further, never sprouting branches, leaves, flowers, or fruit. Those who commit the ten evils are the same: though they hear the Great Dao, they never arouse the supreme mind of the Dao."

Then the *Lingren* addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We humbly ask: from what do those who commit the ten evils receive rebirth? Their perversity turns away from goodness, their evil roots run deep and cannot be uprooted."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Good and evil both arise from the same Dao. It is like travelers: one walks toward the Dao, the other turns away. Those who turn away from the Dao lose their way in dark mountains, straying into shadowed valleys. There, many vicious beasts, thorns, and poisonous brambles await; their clothes and provisions run out, and suffering presses upon them. A hundred afflictions arise, and they die in distress. Their souls revolve, receiving retribution according to their karma. Those who walk toward the Dao find their path unimpeded; whatever they seek, they attain. Moreover, they meet many good companions, finding shelter wherever they go. If they wish to see the king, they may go as they please. Because they walk toward the Dao, no benefit eludes them. These two kinds, though their practices differ and their directions diverge, are not so by the Dao’s design."

The Dao is inherently unobstructed; it is the practitioners who turn toward or away, their paths of opposition and compliance diverging. Those who commit the ten evils lose the Dao through their own actions, not because the Dao abandons them. Those who turn toward the Dao attain it through their own efforts, not because the Dao bestows it upon them.

Let the spiritually awakened know: our host of sages, kalpa after kalpa, descends to transform beings. Though those who commit the ten evils do not believe in the Dao, the Dao never departs from them.

Then the spiritually awakened one again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "I fear that those who commit the ten evils, their karmic habits deeply ingrained, turn away from the Dao in life and death, making them beyond transformation and deliverance. It is like shards of pottery—once broken, they cannot be rejoined."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The majestic power of the Great Dao is like a great forge, smelting all gold—nothing remains unrefined. Know this, spiritually awakened one: those among the ten evils whom I have not yet transformed, I first let them endure suffering, waiting until they grow weary and repentant before transforming them. I shall reveal to them the supreme, majestic, and freely wielded transformations of the Dao, compelling them to submit and return."

The spiritually awakened one again asked: "I wonder, Heavenly Worthy, whether you will demonstrate your divine power as before or employ another method. I wish to witness it, that the nets of bondage may be untangled, gods and humans may prosper, and all—both hidden and manifest—be universally delivered. Would not such a vast and boundless transformation be most joyous?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Wait but a moment, and you shall see."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, with boundless compassion unobstructed, transformed into one hundred thousand beings who had committed the ten evils. Their forms were tall and imposing, their strength robust, their words sharp and eloquent. Each confessed their crimes, unafraid of the karmic causes leading to birth, death, or hell. Before the Heavenly Worthy, in but a moment, he commanded a hundred thousand celestial immortals and direct envoys to bear banners of faith, descend into the Nine Dark Realms, and lead forth the sinful ghosts who had committed the ten evils. In an instant, all arrived together, joining the transformed beings in one place.

The Heavenly Worthy then transformed into a million mighty warriors, wielding great iron rods, interrogating the transformed beings about the reasons for their evil deeds. The transformed beings refused to submit. Thereupon, the warriors struck them with their rods, shattering them into fine dust.

Next, they questioned the sinful ghosts. Before the rods could be raised, the ghosts prostrated themselves in submission, begging to return to life and follow the Dao’s transformation.

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded a million spiritually awakened ones, each grasping a left-hand tally, to fly in all directions, pursuing the descendants of the ghosts. In but a moment, countless billions, moved by the Dao’s majestic power, gathered at the assembly. Yet they did not return to faith, their hearts devoid of shame, claiming they should not have been suddenly summoned thrice.

Thereupon, the sinful ghosts, seeing their descendants, wailed in grief and gnashed their teeth, saying: "From whence have you, my fivefold treacherous and evil kin, come? Long have I desired to kill you but found no opportunity. When I am free, I shall exterminate your lineage."

Hearing this, the descendants’ hair stood on end. Instantly, their heads ached, and they suffered from cold, heat, and poisonous afflictions.

At that time, the sinful ghosts’ bodies were mutilated beyond recognition—some lacked hands or feet, some were flayed, some had their bellies split open, some were burned by fire or boiled in cauldrons, some had their flesh carved away, some had their eyes gouged out, some had their tongues torn out, some had their bones sawed apart, some were pierced all over with awls, some had their intestines hooked out, some were devoured by the six livestock. Their myriad sufferings defy description.

Those among the ghosts’ descendants who were born in the world had incurred debts to their ancestors and committed the ten evils, enduring countless karmic retributions and receiving their due in life. Some were blind, deaf, mute, or dumb; some had withered or paralyzed limbs; some were covered in malignant sores; some had lost their eyebrows and hair; some were riddled with bone-eating leprosy; some suffered from ulcers, fistulas, or swollen tumors; some had twisted faces; some oozed pus and blood; some were impoverished and destitute.

At that time, the sins of humans and ghosts were alike. After a long while, they looked at one another, weeping in sorrow, unable to bear it.

Then the Heavenly Worthy softly asked: "Why do you, humans and ghosts, both in life and death, remain in such a state, inferior to others? I now pity you and cannot bear to abandon you, so I have gathered you here from afar with the power of the Dao."

At that time, humans and ghosts, inwardly ashamed, gazed up at the Heavenly Worthy’s sacred body, radiant with purple-gold light, while the spiritually awakened ones shone like ice and snow.

Then, among the ten evils, one named Seeker of Profit stepped forward, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "I wonder, Heavenly Worthy, what meritorious deeds you have accomplished to attain such an extraordinary form, unmatched divine power, and flawless eloquence, unlike anything in the world. I wish you would tell me, that I may know the cause and origin of this."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "There is no other practice among our sacred host but compassion, forbearance, diligence, upholding the precepts, generosity, and refraining from killing living beings. Through these causes and conditions, I have attained this state."

Hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, those who had committed the ten evils felt a slight turn toward goodness, silently repenting their past deeds, and prostrated themselves, unable to rise.

At that time, among the sinful ghosts, one named Return to the True saw his descendants and felt remorse for his past deeds. He also bowed and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "I wonder, in the ghostly realm, can one still hear the Dharma? I lament my lifetime of evil, enduring the trials of ghosts and spirits, my karmic retribution unfinished, with no escape."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "You need only contemplate the Dao, refrain from crooked ways, and in every place and circumstance, keep the Dao and its teachings in your heart. I shall save you."

At that time, the ghosts’ hearts turned toward faith, their sores and ulcers gradually diminishing, and the afflictions of the living also slightly improved.

In but a moment, the Ghost of Judgment and his underworld officers suddenly arrived, flying through the air. They addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Earlier, we received your strict command to release the multitude of ghosts and dared not detain them. We wonder, Heavenly Worthy, by what cause and condition you have suddenly bestowed such great mercy, absolving the ten evils and erasing their vast sins. The records of these evil ghosts’ sins still exist, and their karmic retribution is unfinished."

The Heavenly Worthy, knowing their intent, employed skillful means to ask the Ghost of Judgment: "For what reasons did these ghosts, in life, die and enter hell, and for how many kalpas must they endure suffering?"

The Ghost of Judgment replied: "First, these ghosts in their lifetimes wantonly murdered their fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters. Second, they rebelled against their sovereigns and wrongfully killed the multitudes. Third, during their lifetimes, they waylaid travelers on land and water, killing them to seize their wealth. Fourth, in their lifetimes, they defiled and scorned the Dao and its teachings, recklessly divulged scriptures, and undermined good deeds. Fifth, during their lifetimes, they trafficked their parents and kin for profit to enrich themselves. Sixth, in their lifetimes, they delighted in plundering households and nations. Seventh, in their lifetimes, they robbed corpses and desecrated tombs, scattering human remains. Eighth, in their lifetimes, they were unfilial to their parents, hoarding fine food for themselves. Ninth, in their lifetimes, they betrayed their teachers and turned their backs on the Dao, their hearts devoid of shame. Tenth, in their lifetimes, they bullied the orphaned and impoverished, secretly harmed the virtuous, and sowed discord with their tongues. For these sins, they died and entered hell, suffering for ten thousand kalpas."

The Heavenly Worthy, employing skillful means once more, further questioned the Ghost of Judgment regarding the ten evils: "What is meant by 'wantonly murdering fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters'?"

The Ghost of Judgment answered: "Among the ten evils, some men lust after their mothers and kill their fathers; some women lust after their fathers and kill their mothers. The same applies to uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters."

Upon hearing the Ghost of Judgment’s words, those guilty of the ten evils reflected on their own transgressions and the sins they had committed, which mirrored those of their ancestors. Fearing they too would descend into hell after death, their hair stood on end, their hearts trembled with terror, and they could not compose themselves. Overcome with remorse, they struck themselves until they bled.

The multitude of sinful ghosts wailed in unison, their cries like mountains collapsing.

The Ghost of Judgment continued: "The records of these ten evils’ sins in life and death are all in my keeping. I only inscribe their wickedness; no good is recorded. If neither the living nor the dead repent, how can the Heavenly Worthy intend to deliver these ten evils without meting out punishment, allowing them to ascend and be saved? If future fools see this and their sins multiply unchecked, where will the blameless seek refuge? I beseech the Heavenly Worthy not to deliver these people."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The Supreme Great Dao makes no distinction between friend and foe, ever extending impartial compassion and the power of a single vow to universally deliver all, without favor or bias. Know this, Ghost of Judgment: I first commanded one hundred thousand immortals of the middle realm to bear banners of faith and descend into the Nine Dark Realms, summoning forth the multitude of ghosts. Then I sent fifty thousand spirit messengers, clutching my left decree, to traverse the four directions and pursue the descendants of these ghosts. For these reasons, the law permits their deliverance, and the profound statutes of the Great Dao allow for their repentance. After repenting, if they transgress again, they may be seized, and my Dao will not save them."

Thereupon, the Ghost of Judgment, receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, dared not speak further.

At that moment, those seeking profit and their assembly, gripped by fear, found their illnesses worsening. They implored the Heavenly Worthy for deliverance.

The Heavenly Worthy, perceiving their intent, addressed them: "You have all followed the ten evil deeds of your ancestors. The underworld has recorded your sins, identical to those of your forebears. How could you act like beasts, wantonly harming your kin, killing your own flesh and blood, secretly injuring the good, and feeling no shame? With such sinful bodies, you are unfit to bear the Dao. You must only refrain from committing the ten evil deeds, cultivate diligently day and night, and you may yet attain deliverance. The supreme secret Dao cannot yet be revealed to you."

Thereupon, each person inscribed the ten precepts, vowing to restrain body and mind and never transgress again.

Then, those seeking profit again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We do not know how to rescue the sinful souls of our ancestors and free them from suffering."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Return to your homes and establish pure abodes, upholding the Dao and its teachings. Morning and evening, perform rites of repentance, observe the precepts, practice generosity, and prepare incense and lamps, dedicating all your worldly possessions. Hold a grand nine-dark-realm fast for three days and three nights, offering incense and circumambulating the Dao, pouring out your sincerity and devotion three times in succession as a great act of atonement. Additionally, conduct the Zhongyuan Grand Offering to relieve the hungry ghosts. At that time, invite the assembly of the Dharma to recite this scripture, proclaiming it to the foolish, urging them to exhaust all inner and outer wisdom, so that merit may be perfected. By the power of this Dharma, your ancestors’ souls will be delivered to the Southern Palace and reborn in a land of the Dao. Without this, there is no means of deliverance."

Upon hearing this, each person bowed in gratitude and vowed to follow the teachings.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the spirit beings, saying: "Out of great compassion, I have delivered these ghosts from suffering. Moreover, I wish to devise a skillful means to leave these teachings for later generations, thus commanding the establishment of fasts to restrain their minds. Future beings who seek to rescue the deceased should follow this method to atone for past transgressions and resolve the retributions of their ancestors. Further, by performing rites of repentance, they may dissolve past offenses, continuously cultivate their minds, prevent negligence, sever the roots of evil, and increase virtuous karma. You must now understand the method of transformation and deliverance—it ought to be thus."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Lord of Life in the Southern Palace to receive the multitude of ghosts and swiftly grant them rebirth, allowing no delay. The ghosts then bowed in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy and departed with sorrow and joy.

At that time, the spirit beings again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "With humans and ghosts now delivered, boundless joy arises. Yet there remain those in the animal realm who seek salvation. Their offenses, too, originate from the ten evils, cycling through retribution. Once fallen into bestial form, they lose their original nature. Though lacking full wisdom, they possess the Dao-nature. They nurture their young with affection, feed and raise them, gather in groups by kind, and dwell in forests and thickets. Fearful and startled, they guard their lives, thinking only of water and grass, knowing nothing beyond—truly beyond comprehension. Pitying their lack of wisdom, their kind does not cease; they multiply endlessly, devouring one another. Unable to bear this, my heart finds no refuge."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! Spirit beings, you must now understand that the Great Dao constantly teaches and transforms all beings with earnest care, delivering the suffering souls of hell and the tormented spirits. To sever the path of animals, one must first purify its source, for then its flow will easily clear. Why is this? The animal realm arises from the human realm. Therefore, one must first transform the human realm. Once humans are transformed, myriad evils will not arise; with no evils arising, the animal realm will be severed. Have you not heard how I once expounded the essential Dharma to the Dragon Kings and Water Deities? This was precisely the reason. Yet now you have forgotten and recall nothing."

The spirit beings then reflected inwardly and at last awakened.

At that time, the Five Emperors and the Ghost Kings of Epidemic Diseases, hearing that the Heavenly Worthy had descended to deliver humans and ghosts, led their legions—five hundred million strong—to the assembly. They addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "By the fruit of our karma, we have become Ghost Kings, governing all beings in the realms of form and desire under heaven. The registers of life and death are entirely within our grasp. We bring sickness or vitality, never passing an idle moment. When people pray to us, we are sated with offerings, and the lives we sustain never lack for a moment."

In recent millennia, blessings and destinies have all but vanished, and humans have received the qi of the Dao—yet our teachings no longer prevail. For this reason, our fortunes have dwindled, and all our legions suffer from hunger and emptiness. This is entirely the doing of the Heavenly Worthy’s Dao qi. We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will not remain in the world for long, for all things value self-preservation and do not harm one another. Yet today, the Heavenly Worthy has become a great harm to us."

Perceiving the intent of the ghosts, the Heavenly Worthy instantly transformed into a Great General of Ghost-Slaying, his body a hundred *zhang* tall, followed by countless legions of riders. On his left, he bore the Vajra-Shaking Divine Bell; on his right, he grasped the Jade Halberd, its radiance streaming like the Kunwu sword. In his hands, he wielded a divine sword and golden battle-axe, while thunder and lightning crashed around him. A dazzling brilliance flared, swirling and seething, as he descended before the Heavenly Worthy from the northwest upon a chariot of dark clouds. He prostrated before the Heavenly Worthy, offering boundless reverence. His vanguard and retinue resounded with ten thousand kinds of drums and horns.

At that moment, the transformed figure let forth a great thunderous voice, and all together they chanted the *Divine Chapter for Dispelling Demons*. The transformed figure then declared himself the Great General of Ghost-Slaying, attendant to the Heavenly Worthy. His eyes emitted streaming light like shooting stars.

When the Five Emperors and Ghost Kings, along with all their followers, beheld this awe-inspiring might, they trembled in fear, kneeling downwind and not daring to lift their gaze. The Great General rebuked the host of ghosts: "How dare you, demonic fiends and malevolent specters, act thus?" With a single roar, the Ghost Kings were thrown into disarray. After a long while, they rose, flustered and crawling on the ground.

The Great General then questioned the ghosts: "Beneath the Four Heavens, do the people suffer from unjust illnesses and untimely deaths—are these your doing?" They answered, "It is the gods who bring this about." The General asked again: "How many poisons can you ghosts inflict to afflict living beings with suffering? Answer me truthfully, and I shall spare you. If you conceal anything, I shall execute you."

Then the Azure Emperor Ghost King replied: "I govern the diseases of spring, causing people to suffer headaches, chills, fevers, and malignant sores." The Vermilion Emperor Ghost King answered: "I govern the diseases of summer, bringing scorching heat that torments people with agony and emaciation." The White Emperor Ghost King said: "I govern the diseases of autumn, causing people to suffer from cramps, vomiting, dysentery, wasting thirst, and vexation." The Black Emperor Ghost King replied: "I govern the diseases of winter, bringing damp and cold that penetrate people’s limbs and joints, causing swelling and pain." The Yellow Emperor Ghost King said: "I govern the diseases of the four seasons, causing people’s abdomens to harden and stab with pain."

When the ghosts had finished speaking, the transformed General commanded them to manifest these poisonous diseases. Then, brandishing the sound that dispels demons, he extinguished the ghosts’ qi. In that instant, the ghosts experienced a thousand deaths and ten thousand rebirths, their agony like being burned by fire, their cries of torment filling the air.

The Heavenly Worthy then commanded that the ghosts’ suffering be temporarily halted and addressed them: "You ghosts have accumulated evil, and today your sins are complete, hence you endure this suffering. The innocent among living beings suffer untimely deaths, and those who kill to prolong their own lives only compound their grave offenses, never to receive blessings or protection. All this stems from the greed, cruelty, and terror spread by malevolent spirits."

Thereupon, the transformed General glared fiercely once more, and the ghosts’ suffering redoubled, longing for death yet unable to die. Blood gushed from their pores, joints, ears, eyes, mouths, and noses. In such torment, their bodies and minds trembled, unable to flee, their limbs failing them as they writhed upon the ground. Like birds with clipped wings, they were utterly powerless.

The transformed figure then questioned the ghosts again: "Are the life records of all beings determined by you?" Terrified, the ghosts dared not lie and answered, "No." The General asked: "If not by you, then how can you cause living beings to suffer from illnesses?" They replied: "Ghosts cannot truly cause people to fall ill. Why? Because malevolent ghosts enter people only when they are already sick."

The General asked: "How do you enter those who are already sick?" They answered: "People living in the world fail to discern right from wrong. They indulge in anger, strife, gluttony, lust, and immoderate labor or leisure, exposing themselves to wind, cold, heat, and dampness, thus bringing illness upon themselves. Or, if not by their own doing, they may be unfilial to their parents, rebellious toward their teachers, disrespectful to heaven and earth, or fail to uphold the precepts—thus, heaven punishes them with illness. Malevolent spirits then exploit these circumstances, wielding their power to receive offerings and sustain their own lives. In truth, it is not the ghosts who kill the good and innocent. Those who turn their backs on the Dao and consort with evil, lacking moral discipline, are abandoned by protective spirits. But those who practice forbearance and diligence, cultivate great compassion, and harmonize body and mind with the Dao—such people cannot be harmed by ghosts."

When the spirit beings heard the ghosts’ words, they deemed them deceptive and evasive. They addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "We do not understand the principle behind the ghosts’ answers—what does it mean?" The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The ghosts’ answers are entirely reasonable. Witnessing the might of this transformed General, they marveled at what they had never seen before and now pay reverence to the Heavenly Worthy. You should know that the divine power of the Great Dao is unmatched, subduing all demons and crushing heterodox teachings. All dharmas return to the Great Dao. We petty ghosts, powerless to resist, have lost our original minds and no longer possess any might or virtue. We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will spare our lives and allow us to serve as attendants forever, providing for the great assembly, guarding and protecting the disciples, never daring to be negligent."

After the ghosts made this vow, their pain ceased. The Heavenly Worthy, perceiving their intent, asked again: "For what reason did you ghosts suddenly suffer such torment and affliction? And by what cause has it now abated?" The ghosts replied: "The suffering we endured earlier arose from beholding the awe-inspiring might and radiance of the Great General of Ghost-Slaying. Suddenly stricken with illness, we sought death in vain, losing our original minds. We did not know why the pain was so unbearable. Now, our suffering has lessened because we could no longer endure it, trapped between life and death. In our desperation, we vowed in our hearts to be spared by the Heavenly Worthy, to serve as attendants forever, providing for the great assembly, guarding and protecting the disciples, never daring to be negligent."

Having made this vow, they gradually recovered. The Heavenly Worthy addressed them, saying: "You ghosts who afflict all people—your hearts know no shame or remorse. Now you have received this evil retribution, yet it was not wrought by the Great General of Ghost-Slaying. Though this general is named 'Ghost-Slayer,' he has ascended to the stage of true forbearance, entered the realm of compassion, and attained the six supernatural penetrations. His heart is as vast as the sea, and with wisdom and power, he slays only the thieves of affliction, never harming living beings with his body or hands. For this reason, he is called the Great General of Ghost-Slaying: he leads the armies of the Six Perfections, shatters the demonic foes, and guides sentient beings to the land of forbearance. Thus is he named Great General. You ghosts must not harbor perverse views, suspecting this general to be a true slayer. If you persist in such misguided thoughts, you will forever fall into the paths of evil, your wickedness growing ever greater, and your afflictions never abating."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke this verse:
*"The perverse and the upright are not two paths,
Pure and turbid share a single source.
The breath that issues from emptiness
Divides midway into awe and grace.
The Dao is foremost among all blessings,
While evil is the foe of birth and death.
When perversity prevails, the upright naturally arises;
Delusion at its extreme returns to the root.
It is so of itself—
The Great Dao has never spoken."*

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished reciting this verse, he again addressed the ghosts: "You ghosts must turn away in revulsion, reflect deeply, feel shame and remorse, reproach yourselves, and ponder: what karmic causes led you to fall into this ghostly realm, reeking of filth and stench, ever awaiting human misfortune, seeking prayers and sacrifices, taking lives without shame? You band together in gangs, delighting only in evil, envying virtue and morality, disrupting the good. You become omens of disaster, terrifying sentient beings. How can you perverse ghosts ever serve as true fields of merit for the people? You know not great compassion, only the destruction of life. You ghosts have long indulged in wickedness, filling yourselves with impurity and sin, destined for hell—burned by fire, boiled in cauldrons, sawed apart by wind-blades, enduring every torment to repay the beings you have wronged."

Then, perceiving that the ghosts’ hearts had not yet attained pure faith, the Heavenly Worthy commanded them to reflect deeply for a long while. With his sovereign spiritual power, he gathered the ghosts and led them into the Flaming Furnace Hell, then into the Cauldron of Boiling Oil Hell, past the Sawing Hell, the Mountain of Knives and Forest of Swords Hell, the Frozen Hell, and the Eternal Night Hell. He ordered the hell wardens to drive them with rods, allowing no respite. As the wardens raged, fire erupted from their seven orifices, scorching the throng of ghosts, who shrieked and fled in terror. All the gates of hell were sealed, leaving no escape.

Then the ghosts thought to themselves: *"May the Heavenly Worthy save our lives!"* In an instant, the Heavenly Worthy transformed into a virtuous man, accompanied by attendants, and opened the gates of hell, leading the ghosts out while commanding the wardens to release them. He guided the ghosts back to the assembly, where from afar they saw the Heavenly Worthy. Weeping bitterly, they recounted their suffering, confirming all that the Heavenly Worthy had foretold—they had endured the full weight of their karmic adversaries, unable to bear the torment. In their agony, they had yearned for the Great Dao, and some had seen a virtuous man open the gates of hell, leading them back to once more behold the Heavenly Worthy. Joy and fear mingled in their hearts, for they dreaded being cast again into the hellish sufferings, their bodies unable to endure. They begged the Heavenly Worthy to grant them deliverance, to free them from the ghostly realm and release them from the myriad torments of hell.

The Heavenly Worthy again addressed the ghosts: "The suffering you have endured arises from your past lives’ wanton destruction of life, your harm to the good and innocent, your creation of omens and terrors to frighten sentient beings. This is your retribution—none other has imposed it. You ghosts earlier declared your desire to serve the Great Dao as attendants. But your sins run deep, your yin-thieving nature remains unexpunged, your foul stench and filth would alarm the assembly. How could you dare, without cause, bring such a sinful body to offend the Great Sage?"

The evil ghosts replied: "We beg the Great Dao for the water of the Dharma, to bathe away the dust and grime, to refine body and mind. If not for this, how would we dare, without reason, bring this sinful form to trouble the Great Sage? We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in his boundless compassion, will overlook our filth and bestow the flow of the Dharma, washing away our foul stench, so we may receive the true qi. This would be the fortune of a thousand lifetimes, realized today."

When the ghosts had spoken thus, their wailing shook the earth. They beat their heads upon the ground until their eyes bled, fainting and reviving in turn.

Then the divine assembly, moved by the ghosts’ profound sorrow, wept from the north and spoke: "Disciples are fortunate to have been delivered, to enter the stream of the Dao, to serve the Heavenly Worthy. Through eons of deep karmic affinity, we have been moved without motion, bearing the weight of your grace, our hearts overwhelmed. Without presumption, we have troubled your divine thoughts, entreating your compassion to extend mercy, to turn your mind toward us, to offend your sacred heart by delivering these lowly ghosts—so earnest and burdensome is our plea. We reflect that these ghosts are as we once were: before knowing the Dao, we saw only external obstructions, our doubts inwardly piled high, wandering in darkness without cause for awakening. But upon glimpsing the sun of heaven, the long night brightened. Meeting the Compassionate Honored One, all doubts dissolved at once. Sheltered beneath the *qian* tree, we bathed in the dark stream, the dust of our burdens swept away, the nature of the Dao revealed. Like the sun melting accumulated snow, like a torch in the night dispelling deep gloom, the mist vanished, the layered ice dissolved. The rain of the Dharma poured forth, broadly nourishing the fields of the heart. The sprouts of the supreme Dao grew in season; the clouds of compassion spread wide, reviving the withered and rotted, transforming white bones into living beings—this we witness today. We only pray that the Heavenly Compassion will deliver these ghosts, for though in the past we were not two, we diverged midway. Now, reunited in thought, we return together beneath the One Dao. These ghosts, devoid of kind hearts, confined to dull senses and ignorant minds, are truly pitiable."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "I shall display these rare and wondrous powers to entrust these ghosts to the Lord of the Southern Flourishing Palace, that they may be born into the world. By their earnest devotion, they shall serve as my attendants. I cannot bear to thwart the desires of these ghosts."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Left Immortal Youth to burn the incense of returning souls; He further commanded the Right Attendant Perfected to hold aloft the talisman of the Numinous Unity; and He commanded the Lord of the Spring Dao of the Azure Heaven to secretly infuse the qi of life, reviving the host of ghosts.

When the ghosts had thus been delivered, they rejoiced and gave thanks, encircling the Heavenly Worthy to bow and offer praise. They then made this vow: "Wherever the Heavenly Worthy may be, in any great assembly, should even a speck of dust arise, we shall lick it away—no sweeping shall be needed. If any newly ordained Daoist displays improper conduct, we shall correct it. Beneath the Four Heavens, all men and women who receive the Dao and its methods, we shall protect, ensuring their success. Should they require anything, we shall provide it, that they want for nothing."

Then the ghosts, their hearts and bodies transformed for the good, did not stray from their original vow. They cultivated merit to amend their faults, repaying the kindness of the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy asked the ghosts: "Now that you have escaped all suffering, do you wish to be reborn in the world, or to enter the true rank of the Dao?"

The Ghost King of the Azure Emperor replied to the Heavenly Worthy: "Before we knew the Dao, we drifted through birth and death, emerging into the human realm only to die before a hundred years had passed. Buffeted by demonic influences, we wandered the Five Paths, reaping the consequences of our deeds without respite. Now, having encountered the Heavenly Worthy, we wish to cast off all suffering as one spits out what was eaten—never to taste it again. We, too, do not wish to be reborn in the body of an ordinary mortal. To be born among the common folk would be like eating what one has vomited—a rare and undesirable fate. To emerge into the world of mortals would be like treading upon boiling water or burning coals—how could one not be scorched? We are fortunate indeed to have beheld the Compassionate Worthy and escaped the blind path. We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will take pity on us and permit us to serve as Your attendants."

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "The Great Dao is vast and unbounded; its Dharma knows no restrictions, save for the Ten Evils, and no goodness remains unmet."

Then the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for the ghosts and knowing their hearts had turned toward the Way, bestowed upon them the ranks of the Five Departments and the Five Hundred Million Hosts, appointing them to the station of Good Spirits. They were charged with protecting the Daoist precincts, aiding new disciples, tending the pure censers, and perpetually supplying fragrant wood and ashes for the sacred fires.

When the numinous beings witnessed the deliverance of these ghosts, their hearts swelled with joy, and they offered this hymn of praise:

*"The divine wind stirs the dark stream,
suddenly raising waves of great compassion.
It washes away the filth of ignorance,
lightly bearing us beyond the river of desire.
How we grieved for you before your deliverance,
sighing deeply in our sorrow.
The clouds of compassion spread wide,
and the withered and rotted bloom anew.
Who could have foreseen that the children of the Nine Nether Realms
would return to our eternal immortal home?"*

Then the numinous beings sang again:

*"The world’s path is tangled, ceaselessly churning,
drowning in the currents of love and attachment.
Why not turn wholly to the effortless Dao,
and cease making enemies of birth and death?
Why refuse to dwell in stillness and emptiness,
and instead seek the bitter, the pungent, the dust-laden?
Why not gaze up at the heroic ones,
who ride the clouds, wielding their regalia, roaming free?"*

When the numinous beings had finished this song, they addressed the ghosts: "You are fortunate indeed to have witnessed the Great Dao opening the way to your deliverance. You must day and night diligently advance, aiding the Dao in its flourishing, protecting and cherishing the good, ever practicing compassion, and merging with the Dao. I and you shall forever serve as attendants to the Heavenly Worthy, never far apart, wherever we may be."

The Azure Emperor of Good Spirits replied to the numinous beings: "The Supreme Great Dao—I alone heard of it last. Though the sun and moon shine brightly, the blind cannot see. Now that we have received deliverance, grief and joy mingle within us. We never expected the awe-inspiring power of the Great Dao to be so incomparable, nurturing all goodness, ferrying all transformations, serving as the supreme field of merit for both the hidden and the manifest—beyond thought, beyond measure. Overcome with sorrow and joy, we bow in gratitude to the numinous beings and say: How fortunate is this meeting of goodness, occurring on this very day! We pray that Your compassion will often summon and instruct us, revealing the good path, that we may awaken and understand."

When the Heavenly Worthy saw the Good Spirits humbly thanking the numinous beings and knew their faith to be profound, He advanced these two immortals one stage in their attainment of the Dao.

Then the Cloud and Mist Spirits, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the Eighty Heavenly Spirits of the Four Directions of Kunlun, hearing from afar that the Heavenly Worthy had opened the Mystic Enclosure, led their retinues—one hundred and forty thousand strong—riding the winds to the assembly. Arriving at the gathering, they beheld the Heavenly Worthy’s thirty-two marks, eighty excellences, and eighteen divine powers. His feet pressed the earth, shaking the world; his body emanated water and fire; light streamed from his brow. Barefoot and unclothed, they prostrated themselves, touching their heads to the ground, kneeling in reverence from afar before the Cloud Gate.

The Heavenly Worthy, knowing these to be outsiders, commanded the Immortal Holding the Canopy to display his divine powers, seating himself in the void before the gate.

When the outsiders had finished their worship, doubt arose in their hearts. After a long while, gazing up and down, they recited this verse:

*"I dwell in the Lofty Cleft Mountain,
revered throughout the Three Realms.
Long have I heard of the Supreme Dao,
riding the mists to enter the Cloud Gate.
This is called the Heaven above Heavens—
who could have foreseen an Immortal without form?
The five senses differ not from the world,
the spirit’s knowledge has not yet transcended.
Though dwelling in the Cloud Palace above,
how can one be free from the bonds of birth and death?"*

Then the immortal, moved by the power of the Dao, responded to the demons’ verse. His body manifested all marks, his divine powers transformed myriadfold, and light radiated from every pore. The great earth trembled, and the demonic hosts could not stand firm. The demons bowed their heads in worship, gazing up at the immortal. Their five limbs trembled, their bodies drenched in sweat, shaken and awestruck, losing their composure. Their radiance vanished, and their forms became like heaps of ink.

Then the immortal addressed the demons again: "Why have you come?" Thrice he questioned the demonic hosts, yet none could lift their gaze to answer. After half a time, they at last found their voices, bowing their heads once more in reverence to the immortal: "We have heard that the supreme Great Dao abides eternally in the upper realms, its divine power unconstrained, its majesty and virtue unmatched. Neither eye nor ear may perceive it, nor footstep reach its domain. Morning and evening we yearn in reverence, yet cannot advance of our own accord. Thus we have come together today, daring to present our homage and entreat your mercy. We prostrate ourselves before you."

The immortal replied: "You who dwell below are revered by the world, styling yourselves with ten titles, seeking worldly gain and self-sufficiency in karmic retribution—why have you come here? This is the realm of the Dao, not a place for demons to ascend. Your sins run deep and heavy; you are unfit to behold the Dao. In the Desire Realm, you delude and confuse ordinary beings, calling yourselves *Tamer of Men*; some name themselves *Brahmā*, others *The Capable One*, seeking worldly offerings. Or you claim the title *Great Teacher of Gods and Men*, leading the good and virtuous astray, casting them into the river of birth and death. Those who receive your teachings do not trust in the Great Dao, bound as they are by countless fetters, their minds ensnared by false thoughts. You declare all dharmas of action to be impermanent, yet assert that your own bodies cannot be destroyed. Some preach annihilation as the supreme bliss of the Dharma, urging men to take their own lives, to sever and mutilate their bodies, that they may swiftly shed their mortal forms and attain adamantine bodies. Others speak of a distant Pure Land where rebirth is wondrous, where one sits upon a lotus throne, clothed and fed by nature, leaving this flesh behind to forever escape the cycle of birth and death.

You demons compare your defiled, ashen forms to the adamantine, wielding the Dharma of ignorance to falsely expound the six supernormal powers. You confuse and mislead the world, causing men to abandon filial piety and disrespect their parents. Such perverse teachings, when spread abroad, incite disciples and masters alike to licentious disorder. You perceive bodily marks yet claim to see nothing, prattling of unimpeded emptiness while failing to grasp the ultimate Dao. Adrift and unmoored, you forget your origin and lose the true path. Your minds are dimmed to the Middle Way, ever dwelling in excess. Bound to the cycle of rebirth, you cannot abide eternally, shackled by names and numbers—the thirty-two marks, the eighteen divine powers, the eighty excellences—all fetters of attachment, all conditioned by action, all fabricated by contrivance."

Their toes press the earth, trembling in fear; they make offerings to water and fire through perverse views and gluttonous cravings. They claim ten benefits, lusting after rank flesh, falsely proclaiming merit and virtue. You demonic beings are true outsiders, concealing your evil deeds to silence worldly criticism. You speak of ash and annihilation, trivializing karmic causes, feigning celestial immortals come to hear the Dharma—yet I, a true immortal, have never come to hear demonic teachings. You are true outsiders: shaving heads, plucking hair, baring bodies, going barefoot, committing the ten evils and five rebellions, slandering by nature, loathing the loyal and good, and denouncing the great Dao.

Moreover, when your perverse sects perform their rituals, masters and disciples—men and women—mingle in secluded chambers, hidden from view, concealing their flaws, dreading exposure. Your words and deeds are coarse and vile, your teachings hollow and groundless. For these reasons, you are unfit to perceive the Dao, for you disturb the customs of the world, delude the foolish, and fabricate false doctrines. You teach deviant meditations, conjuring bizarre visions, spreading confusion and deception to mislead the innocent. Your schemes are treacherous, gathering wicked factions, shaving the heads of the ignorant. You defile mortal forms, filling the desire realm with your corruption; you build empty tombs, burning and slaughtering mortal bodies. In throngs, you praise such acts, and thus descend into hell. Ignorance grows, hair shorn and plucked, yet the roots of evil remain uncut. With these perverse arts, you hope to escape entanglement—like carrying dry grass to extinguish a fire, or a fool fleeing illness to avoid disease. Like children running to escape their shadows, your filth and depravity overflow, choking the world. With such sinful bodies, you are unworthy to behold the Dao.

Then, the demonic hosts, hearing the immortal’s words, were struck to the heart. As one, they wept in sorrow, wailing and lamenting, repenting their errors. They beat their breasts, their bodies streaming blood, tearing out their hair as if burning foul grass. Tears streamed from their eyes, their limbs trembled, and baring their shoulders, they begged for mercy, prostrating at the immortal’s feet. Their anguish was beyond measure. The Heavenly Worthy of the Cloud Palace, moved by their repentance, emitted a radiant purple light from his divine eyes, illuminating the immortal from afar. The immortal, sensing the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion, addressed the outsiders: “Those who seek the Dao should not grieve. If you repent, simply change your hearts—do not mutilate your bodies or destroy your nature to seek atonement.”

Hearing these words, the demons ceased their lamentations. Then, among the demonic throng, an outsider who called himself Brahma-King, the foremost leader of the sect, knelt bare-chested, joined his palms, and spoke: “We do not know whether the Heavenly Worthy’s Dao saves the hidden and the manifest, whether its grace flows to the withered and decayed. All living beings long for deliverance—we humbly beg your mercy, that you transform our lowly selves, guide us to renewal, abandoning the perverse for the true. May we shelter beneath your soaring tree, bathe in the stream of your Dharma, step into the pure abyss, and dwell in the mysterious path. May we sweep your altar, attend your comings and goings, hold your canopy, drive your chariot, and serve you morning and night. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to grant this in compassion.” With these words, he wept, his tears falling as he bowed his head.

The immortal replied: “I am not the Heavenly Worthy. My rank is but newly ascended to immortality, and I stand here to attend the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion.” Hearing this, the outsiders broke into a cold sweat, each thinking to themselves: “We dwell in the desire realm, having attained the four fruits of the path. Yet today, in this panic and dread, we lost ourselves—we know now that what we gained was not the true Dharma. The immortals of the upper realms possess unmatched divine power—how much greater must be the majesty and virtue of the Heavenly Worthy? We fear our defilements are too heavy, our impurities too thick, to be worthy of paying homage to the supreme Heavenly Worthy.” Hesitant and uncertain, they knew not how to proceed.

Then, sixty thousand outsiders at once removed the pearls and jeweled necklaces from their necks, piling them at the cloud gate, offering them from afar to the Heavenly Worthy. The immortal said: “The treasures of your lower realm are but gold, silver, lapis lazuli, giant clams, agate, coral, amber, and pearls. In the heavens above, there are ten thousand kinds of rare treasures—radiant mechanisms of the sun and moon, jeweled stars, golden essences in myriad transformations, lightning and flowing auroras. The Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion does not glance at such adornments; how could he desire your tainted necklaces in the Cloud Palace?”

The outsiders replied: “Beings of the desire realm value only these jeweled necklaces, for we do not recognize the wondrous treasures of the upper heavens. We offer them from the heart, to express our sincerity.” The immortal said: “The Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion treasures the jewel of the human heart, not these adornments.” The outsiders answered: “Our mortal bodies hold no jewel within.” The immortal said: “If your bodies lack jewels, why not offer your hearts?”

Then, the outsiders rose and sought a knife, intending to split open their hearts. The immortal, knowing their intent, gave them the blade. Brahma-King then opened his belly, revealing his five viscera. The other outsiders all wished to see their own hearts, but the immortal stopped them, saying: “To offer your heart is to remove your outsider views—your petty awakenings, petty knowledge, petty learning. Focus your minds on the great Dao—this is called offering the heart. It is not the offering of viscera, blood, flesh, bones, or marrow.”

Hearing this, the outsiders began to awaken. Then, the immortal, with a hand of great compassion, pressed Brahma-King’s intestines and viscera back into place, restoring them as before. The outsiders looked at one another, their qi harmonized and flowing smoothly. They all sighed in wonder: “Never have we seen the like!” Having heard the wondrous Dharma and witnessed divine power, they addressed the immortal: “Great Master of Heaven and Earth, you are truly the King of Physicians, curing chronic illnesses, resolving all doubts, restoring us completely without remnant. We wish to follow you and request the gift of life. Grant us the Dao of long life and deathlessness.”

The immortal replied: “What practices of the lower realm can prolong life for a kalpa or half a kalpa?”

The outsiders replied: “In the lower realm, beings who have not heard the true Dharma practice the Four Wishes. Though they may prolong life, it does not exceed eighty thousand great kalpas, after which they fall back and are reborn in the Desire Realm. I have already lived for over seventy thousand kalpas, yet I am constantly troubled by impermanence, birth, aging, sickness, and death. This method is limited—it does not transcend the Three Realms, nor does it surpass the Five Supernormal Powers, and it cannot escape birth and death.”

The immortal said: “The Dao of long life is not something ordinary beings can hear. You outsiders seek long life, but I fear your habitual tendencies run deep, your karmic roots are firmly bound, your years are advanced, your marrow and brain exhausted, your form and spirit sunk in turbidity, and your fluids stagnant and impure. Moreover, you have deceived and deluded the world, and your offenses are already recorded. The Three Offices pierce your deceit, and the Five Emperors expose your transgressions. For you to seek deliverance would be exceedingly difficult. Yet I follow the saving decree of the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy’s golden mouth. Even if the Heavenly Worthy were to permit your deliverance, you should still retreat and fast for a thousand days to reflect on your faults before being saved.”

Hearing the immortal’s words, the outsiders gathered outside the Cloud Gate, bowing from afar to the Heavenly Worthy. They burned incense and made vows for seven days and nights, prostrating and bowing in repentance, seeking a response. At the height of their devotion, they suddenly sensed a divine fragrance penetrating their nostrils and flowing into their hearts. Their hearts rejoiced, afflictions dissolved, hunger and thirst vanished, and their ears and eyes grew sharper, surpassing their initial state. The outsiders snapped their fingers and looked at one another, remarking how their skin and complexion had become radiant and moist.

The immortal, knowing the Heavenly Worthy’s intent toward the outsiders, saw that they too had inwardly awakened. Overcome with joy, they dared not speak aloud but expressed their gratitude through reverence, their thoughts fixed from afar on the Great Compassionate True Emperor. For another seven days and nights, they knelt and bowed before the Cloud Gate.

The immortal said: “The Great Compassionate True Emperor always employs a single compassion to deliver all beings of different kinds, even those who cannot be instructed through words—this is the teaching of the Great Dao that proceeds without speech. It is like a loving mother who discerns her infant’s needs: hearing its cries, she knows whether it is hungry or thirsty, in pain or discomfort, and provides food, drink, or medicine as appropriate. Now you have obtained the power of the Dao.”

The outsiders replied: “It is just as you have perceived.”

The immortal asked: “What have you realized?”

They answered: “We sensed a fragrance penetrating our nostrils and flowing into our hearts, suddenly awakening us. Our hearts are at peace, many times more so than before. Our ears and eyes are sharp—it is the same.”

The immortal said: “You have obtained the power of the Dao and already renewed your nature and life. What cause is there for worry? Yet because your bodies have long been solitary in the dust, you are not yet fit to behold the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy or to examine and wear the supreme essentials of the Dao. You and your followers should return for now to the Desire Realm, retreat in purification for three kalpas, refine body and mind, and only then come again to draw near the Heavenly Worthy.”

At that time, the outsiders replied to the immortal: “Our bodies are decrepit and aged; we fear our lives are not secure. Should we suddenly pass three kalpas in the lower realms, impermanence may swiftly overtake us, and we may lose the Dao in an instant. Our souls and consciousness would drift, following karma to receive retribution—when would we ever return to see the Heavenly Worthy? Great Master, you must know: in the Desire Realm, even the longest-lived heterodox immortals endure no more than eighty thousand great kalpas; those of middling lifespan, one or half a kalpa; and the shortest-lived differ not from ordinary mortals. This assembly cannot be assured of safety. Why then, Great Master, do you grant us only a minor method and merely prolong our years?”

The immortal answered: “The supreme Dao is greatly penetrating; there is no such thing as a minor method. Merely cultivating one practice, all may attain perfection.”

At that time, the outsiders persisted earnestly, each untying the precious pearl from their topknot to offer to the immortal. Knowing their wholehearted devotion, the immortal accepted their offerings and returned within the cloud gate. In but a moment, from within the cloud palace came the faint resonance of numinous tones, like the caress of metal and stone harmonizing with an ethereal zither—its melody flowing and turning, pure, elegant, and resplendent. Suddenly, seven-colored fragrant light lingered about the cloud gate, and within that radiance two immortal youths sat in empty stillness, facing east and west. Together they played cloud zithers and addressed the demons, saying:

“The true qi circulates, pervading the ten directions;
Thick darkness and vast night are illumined by dawn’s light.
The suffering in locked chambers awaits the hour of awakening;
Wandering souls, lost spirits, and divine fragrance draw near.
The hand of compassion wields the vajra sword;
The armor of gentle forbearance severs the blade of evil.
The mighty soldiers of the Six Perfections array their ranks,
All riding the dragon-drawn chariot of concentration and wisdom.
Loftily occupying the cloud gate, they dissolve the five sufferings,
Ever bearing the cinnabar banner to stabilize the eight directions.
Sweeping away the stench of marching corpses from the battlements,
Washing and anointing the withered bones, they make them fragrant and steadfast.”

When the two immortal youths had finished playing their zithers, they said to themselves: “The Desire Realm is thick with dust; its foul stench fills all, sweet dew does not moisten it, mists and veils obscure the heavenly court, and the stench of corpses assails one—ever more rank and surging. We marvel that the immortal can endure dwelling here so long.”

The immortal replied: “It is not that I am able to endure, but that I follow the luminous decree and have no choice.”

Then the immortal youths said to the outsiders: “The qi of humans in the realms of form and desire dries the heavens—why do you tarry? You should withdraw for purification. After three kalpas, when the fragrance of precepts has dispelled the turbid, when you have returned to rectitude and expelled evil, when you have consumed harmony and ingested the elixir, dissolving this demonic qi, your forms will become clear and bright, inwardly and outwardly fragrant and pure. Then you may ascend again. The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy has already bestowed profound protection: fragrant light has suffused and dispelled your evil roots, extended your lifespan, and removed the threat of premature death.”

At that time, the demonic assembly rejoiced anew. The two immortal youths said: “When you return to the lower realms, abandon your heterodox views. Do not roar and clamor, proclaiming your ten titles to solicit offerings and thereby grow your evil roots. Do not claim to be teachers of others, gathering the young and ignorant to lead them into perversity. Do not burn and kill the foolish with poisonous fire, rejoicing in their praise. These are the great yin thieves, who harm through expedient means, who teach and praise death, who shave and sever the lives of ordinary people. This sin is most grave; the supreme Great Dao, compassionate and loving of life, ever abhors such acts.”

At that time, the outsiders assented and received the teachings. They took leave of the immortal youths and withdrew to the Desire Realm.

*Thus concludes Scroll Three of the Supreme Great Dao Jade Clarity Scripture.*
*Scroll Four of the Supreme Great Dao Jade Clarity Scripture.*

**Chapter Nine: The Upper Prime**

At that time, during the grand celebration of the Upper Prime, on the morning of the fourteenth day of the first month, the twin luminaries exchanged their radiance. The moon’s splendor withdrew, the stars’ essence gathered its brilliance, and the circular net of heaven unveiled the dawn. Beams of light and rosy clouds alternated in illumination; the great void grew serene and bright. Fragrant blossoms unfurled in succession; primordial qi arose, harmonious fluids entered the firmament. The earth exhaled a delicate mist; the heavens scattered floating haze. The seas stilled without waves; the dark source flowed with nectar. Flying canopies spread across the firmament; vermilion banners exhaled clouds. Divine pennants fluttered; blossoms swirled in the air. Celestial drums resounded endlessly; ethereal winds chanted without cease. The five essences led the way; twin luminaries flanked the imperial chariot.

At that time, the Supreme Heavenly Honored One of the Upper Prime, the Celestial August Thearch, along with his retinue, descended from his cloud-and-radiance throne in the Palace of the Sun. Aligning their divine steps, they rose in measured dignity and ascended the whirlwind wheel and the jade-carved chariot of concentrated essence. Fragrant clouds entwined the canopy; auspicious mists enveloped the four directions. The August One soared forth, adjusting the reins, guiding the golden radiance.

At the hour of the zenith, he gazed down upon the ten heavens, surveying the six directions, then proceeded to the Palace of Yang’s Vastness. At that time, the Heavenly Honored One and all the great sages together emitted a radiance of compassion from their hearts, illuminating the hidden and the manifest without omitting even the finest speck of dust. The light was not of a thousand hues, yet it knew no bounds. Heaven above and earth below shone clearly without obstruction. The Dharma Wheel turned ceaselessly; all beings gathered in assembly. He exhaled the Great Harmony to awaken sprouts, inhaled the soft and yielding to disperse rigidity. Armor split and coiled serpents scattered; all living beings hastened in joy. Jade-like greenery unfurled its blossoms; coral roots put forth luxuriant branches.

By the hour of noon on the fifteenth day, the immortals of the Three Heavens—numberless, beyond reckoning—assembled. Their minds transcended the five penetrations; their bodies dwelt in the deathless realm. They could command the six armies and subdue the ten great adversaries.

Amidst the outskirts, upon the ground of forbearance, a provisional city was established—its height and breadth beyond compare. Four great gates stood tall, their towers soaring into the clouds, all secured with the seven treasures. Moats deep and vast plunged into the abyss. Along the city’s edges were thirty-six thousand portals, latticed with pearl and silk, its foundations laid with azure stone. The pathways encircled it, level and expansive.

Within the city, palaces and halls rose in sublime splendor, their radiance illuminating the night, bright and unobscured. Rare treasures and silken fabrics filled the storehouses to overflowing. The immortals arrayed the celestial rites, the thunderous Dharma drums resounding. They grasped the Great Cinnabar Scepters, raised the Great Cinnabar Banners, wielded the Great Golden Axes, brandished the Great Divine Swords—sharp and keen as the horns of unicorns. Clad in great Dharma armor, soft as cloud robes, they repelled poisoned arrows, invulnerable to the five weapons. In their hands, they held hooked blades, their edges finely honed, leading the vanguard and guarding the rear, their might like the claws of phoenixes.

At dawn, they harnessed six dragons, drawing forth jeweled chariots to the outskirts, where they arrayed their majestic regalia. The drums thundered, the horns blared—before the command could even be given, the adversaries had already submitted. Armor was cast aside, garments discarded; their fierce spirits instantly withered. Gold melted, drums shattered, banners and scepters lay broken. Hair unbound, sashes loosened, hearts laid bare, they crawled forward on knees and elbows, prostrating themselves to seek alliance, their very lifeblood manifest.

The immortals each unfurled banners of command over the demonic spirits, guiding those who surrendered onto the path of the Great Mystery, into the source of the Pure Cavern, ascending the slopes of Eternal Radiance, mounting the altar of the Golden Phoenix. They burned incense that defied the wind, recited the left-hand tally, and feasted with the Dark Fluid.

Beholding the wondrous power of forbearance, the great adversaries knew its unmatched might. Their hearts transformed in an instant, and they vowed to become immortals, to serve as virtuous companions.

By the hour of the meal, the immortals and their retinues returned to the great city. There, they set aside their majestic regalia and gathered a hundred precious treasures and rare wonders from the divine realms, ascending to the Upper Clarity to offer them to the Heavenly Worthy: the Sun-and-Moon Treasure Pearls, the Star-Essence Treasure Pearls, the Solar-Mirror Treasure Pearls, the Lunar Treasure Pearls, the Radiant-Electric Treasure Pearls, the Black-Dragon Treasure Pearls, the Forbearance Treasure Pearls, the Great-Compassion Treasure Pearls, the Great-Loving-Kindness Treasure Pearls, the Six-Pāramitās Treasure Pearls, the Dust-Transcending Treasure Pearls, the Harmonious-Light Treasure Pearls, the Flawless Treasure Pearls, the Desire-Free Treasure Pearls, the True-Embracing Treasure Pearls, the Flourishing-Essence Treasure Pearls, the Unyielding Treasure Pearls, the Diligence Treasure Pearls, the Precept-Holding Treasure Pearls, the Heart-Ocean Treasure Pearls, the Wisdom Treasure Pearls, the Skillful-Means Treasure Pearls, the Cloud-Thunder Treasure Pearls, the Gentle-Breeze Treasure Pearls, the Sprouting Treasure Pearls, the Sweet-Dew Treasure Pearls, and the Wish-Fulfilling Treasure Pearls. These treasure pearls each shone with distinct radiance, yet all were equally luminous and perfect.

There were also three priceless virtuous treasures: the Great-Compassion Virtuous Treasure, the Frugality Virtuous Treasure, and the Humility Virtuous Treasure. Should any being hold these treasures, their desires would be fulfilled, no wish left unanswered. If any being suffered from illness and held these treasures, their ailments would vanish of their own accord. If any being harbored rebellious thoughts and held these treasures, they would naturally become gentle and compliant. Should a ruler’s land remain unenlightened, disasters and omens repeatedly appearing, neighboring states at war, weapons clashing, the five grains failing to ripen, floods and droughts unbalanced, ministers plotting in secret—if such a ruler held these treasures, the land would transform of its own accord, disasters would cease, neighboring states would befriend one another, weapons would lose their edge, the five grains would flourish in all four seasons, floods and droughts would find balance, ministers would remain loyal, and treacherous plots would vanish.

The immortals also offered four kinds of fragrant rice: the Abundant-Mountain Fragrant Rice, the Dragon-Mountain Fragrant Rice, the Floating-Mountain Fragrant Rice, and the Great-Harmony Fragrant Rice—its fragrance spreading far and wide, inexhaustible to those who partook. They further presented seven kinds of precious nectars: the Sun-Essence Precious Nectar, the Moon-Splendor Precious Nectar, the Star-Essence Precious Nectar, the Sweet-Dew Precious Nectar, the Golden-Fluid Precious Nectar, the Divine-Light Precious Nectar, and the Jade-Casket Precious Nectar, each contained in the precious vessels of the heavens. They also brought priceless treasure robes: the Spontaneous Jasper-Silk Treasure Robe, the Spontaneous Cloud-Brocade Treasure Robe, and the Spontaneous Flowing-Radiance Treasure Robe; as well as priceless incense: the Returning-Soul Incense, the Wind-Defying Incense, the Wind-Resisting Incense, and the Seven-Color Incense. They further offered the various celestial fruits: the Ten-Thousand-Year Divine Peach, the Hollow Divine Melon, the Frost Pear, the Jade Date, the Golden Blossom of the Infant—countless rare and wondrous delicacies, all brought to the assembly to offer to the Heavenly Worthy.

The great presentation of treasures filled the Mysterious Center, their fragrance suffusing the ten directions. The radiance of a hundred treasures illuminated the boundless expanse. The immortals encircled the Heavenly Worthy in hundreds of thousands of layers, striking celestial music and the melodies of Great Harmony, their variations infinite, their sounds harmonious and sublime, pure and resonant. Divine birds flapped their wings in dance, spirit beasts kept time in unison. Dragons chanted, phoenixes sang—all sounds converged in harmony. A gentle breeze stirred the crimson trees, and the incense wafted beneath the canopies. The sun and moon paused in their courses, the stars shone brightly, fragrant smoke curled and drifted, sweet dew poured like rain.

After a long while, the immortals stilled the clamor of the assembly, quieted the lofty rhythms yet unmet. They furled their soaring canopies, resting beside the soaring chariots, withdrawing their swift wheels to stand empty in the cloud courts. As one, they bowed their heads, inquiring of the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We know not whether the Dharma-body of the Heavenly Worthy, in its boundless virtue, has wearied itself with earnest cultivation. The multitudes, lacking merit, weigh heavily upon your sacred mind. Yet the dust and filth obscure them, their roots and karma sunk in turbidity. We gaze in awe upon your mysterious blessings, our hearts ever open day and night. Our reverent sincerity ever before our eyes, we empty our forms to follow the Dao—yet we have no means to repay your grace.”

Once more, mindful of the gift of life and unable to forget its root, the dust-bound multitudes, following one another, have nurtured this humble resolve. Yet the Three Heavens are vast beyond measure—how dare we offer but specks of dust and dewdrops? Yet we rely upon the Great Celebration of the Upper Prime, the lofty assembly of the Merciful Honored One. The boundless grace of Heaven makes no distinction between dust and stench; we pray you accept the cinnabar hearts we offer.

With these words, they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves, awaiting the compassionate decree.

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthy gathered his thoughts and gazed into the distance, his divine radiance vast and serene. His golden countenance shone with brilliance, his true light illuminating all four directions. The myriad heavens dwelled within his eyes, his divine power fully arrayed. The dust-bound realms were not far—suddenly, the doubts in the hearts of the immortals dissolved like melting ice.

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Golden Youth of the Right to burn a hundred blended incenses, their fragrant smoke curling in the wind. He commanded the Left Perfected Ministers, one thousand two hundred in number, to strike in unison the cloud-harmonizing chimes. He commanded the Left Attendants, the True Governors of the Upper Prime of Spring, one thousand two hundred in number, to strike together the divine golden celestial treasures of the Heavenly Bell. He commanded the Great Immortals of the Eastern Pole, nine thousand in number, to sound the ten-thousand-stone purple jade chimes. He commanded the Great Immortals of the Western Pole, six thousand in number, to strike in unison the divine mountain celestial treasures of square gold. He commanded the harmonizing winds to blow forth the ever-changing sounds of the empty and profound.

As the myriad instruments played in harmony, for a long while, nine-colored cloud-dragons coiled and soared in dance, eightfold auroras swirled in the sky, fragrant winds turned through the gardens, and soaring simurghs and phoenixes circled above. Divine birds and immortal beasts chanted in the empty courts, neither too slow nor too swift—like flying clouds wheeling through the heavens, like returning waves drawing the current. Amidst the symphony of sounds, the subtle words of the empty and profound were intoned, and the Heavenly Worthy addressed the immortals, saying:

The primal qi of the Upper Prime is all-natural,
Governing life as the August Ultimate for all conditions.
The purple chambers stir the misty vapors,
The Great Harmony flows forth, dissolving hardness and rigidity.
The Dao’s creation and sustenance follow thus—
Therefore I have moved my abode to govern this heaven.
Wind and thunder dissolve all knots and tangles,
The six qi can rouse those who slumber through the long night.
This too is the wondrous workings of divine power,
Not that I by force compel it to be so.
The myriad treasures arrayed form the realm of profound principle,
Which is itself the empty heart’s field of supreme blessing.

At that time, the immortals heard the subtle sounds from the void, naturally wondrous and clear, penetrating and empty. The flow of Dao and virtue was all-pervading, every principle present without omission. Joy filled their hearts, divine light shone forth from their forms, and all living beings burst into radiant bloom. Those rising and sinking, flying and running, leapt and danced in exultation. Precious trees and fragrant herbs blossomed in season, while all manner of roots and branches sprouted buds and unfurled leaves.

The immortals attained the six spiritual penetrations, and nine generations of their ancestors received blessings, freed from sorrow and suffering. Such is the power of the Upper Prime—its virtue is thus.

For three days and three nights, the celestial affairs were brought to completion.

Then, having received the offerings, the Heavenly Worthy turned to bestow upon the Heavenly Perfected without omission. Through the gift of the formless, like the divine power of the Dao, the karmic retribution is boundless. The fragrant rice and precious nectar remained undiminished; the sun and moon’s jeweled pearls grew ever brighter; the incense of the time, its fragrance unceasing.

Among the great assembly of immortals, there was an Upper Immortal named Changqi, who intoned a *bu xu*:

We harness and ascend the August Ultimate,
Riding the turning wheel into the Central Heaven.
Parting the void, we offer the treasure of the heart,
The wondrous awakening illumines the field of the body.
From the Palace of the Sun, harmonious qi scatters,
In the vast courts, the smoke of vows ascends.
The Great Dao is beyond thought and discourse,
Its boundless blessings bestow wisdom without end.
The empty form roams the realm of the Dao,
The dark heart enters the Great Nothingness.
Unfolding the profound, we seek the edge of the treasure,
The hidden accord naturally aligns.
Thus we clarify what lies beyond the illusory,
Exhaling the burdens that shackle the foolish masses.
Who knows the Dao of undying?
Its distant cause lies in the *Kongdong* texts.
The mysterious wind stirs the Great Nothingness,
Heavenly music intones the subtle sounds.
Dragon scripts reveal phoenix splendor,
Jade characters pluck the empty zither.
Swift wheels ascend the cloud paths,
Loosened hair scatters jeweled pins.
We bow our heads to the August Ultimate,
Burning incense to lay bare our hearts.

When the immortal had finished reciting the *bu xu*, he bowed once more and inquired of the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “At this lofty assembly of the Upper Prime, we have been blessed to behold your presence, bathed in your grace and transformation. With empty hearts, we bear the weight of your favor, our blessings extending to the hidden and the manifest, the living and the dead alike. We forget our transgressions and faults, and pray for your forgiveness. We wish to follow the Heavenly Worthy and make a single request: that for all beings beneath the Four Heavens, you deliver them from suffering and distress, freeing them from all calamities and hardships. We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to descend into the divine terraces of the Divine Continent, to broadly deliver the people of the world and all non-human beings.”

Thereupon, the August Ultimate Heavenly Worthy addressed the immortals, saying: “You should know that the lofty assemblies of the Three Primes occur on auspicious days of good omen, rooted in the primal qi. The primal qi transforms into the One Qi, and the One Qi transforms into the Qi of Equilibrium. These Three Qi correspond above to the Three Prime Heavenly Treasure Palaces—the Palaces of the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars. Each palace has its Honored One: I dwell in the Palace of the Sun, named the August Ultimate Heavenly Worthy, governing the Upper Prime on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the time of spring yang, when the myriad things come to life. The Perfected One of the Palace of the Moon is named the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Worthy, governing the Middle Prime on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, when the myriad things reach maturity. The Perfected One of the Palace of the Stars is named the Multitudinous Wonders Heavenly Worthy, governing the Lower Prime on the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month, when the myriad things are stored and nurtured. You need only focus your hearts upon the Divine Continent and the realms beneath the Four Heavens, teaching and transforming beings, leading them far from heterodox paths, and proclaiming the names of the Three Honored True Emperors, morning and evening, with devoted aspiration. On these days, the Three Honored Ones will descend together, visiting the grotto-heavens, manifesting in myriad forms to deliver the beings of heaven and earth.”

At that time, the assembled immortals reverently received the luminous decree. On the seventeenth day of the first lunar month, at dusk, they took leave of the Heavenly Worthy and returned to the lower realms. Passing through the midst of the Northern Dipper, they awaited the Perfected Ones by night and paid homage to the Divine Youths by day. After lingering for seven days, they descended to the Divine Continent, gathering upon the summit of Mount Shou. After three days and three nights of deliberation on the propagation of the teachings, they traveled east to the sunny side of Fusang, south to the sunny side of the Fire Pool of Yanzhou, west to the flowing gold beyond Mount Yanzi, and north beyond the Yin Valley’s accumulated snows. Then they proceeded to the mounds of *Qilong*, the Green Hills, Mount Kongtong, and Mount Juci, in turn announcing the news to those who had newly attained the Dao, just as the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Prime August Ultimate had spoken from his golden mouth.

On the fourteenth day of the seventh month, the Grand Assembly in the Clouds saw the August Ultimate Heavenly Worthy of the Correct Dao descend to the Divine Continent. Each immortal was commanded to prepare in unison, singing hymns and chanting the names of the Perfected Emperors, so that the Four Heavens below might hear. On this day, all were to prepare celestial offerings, presenting every treasure of the world—arranging seats, banners, flowers, incense, and candles—while their hearts continuously held the thought.

On this day, beneath the Four Heavens, all minds harmonized as one. At dawn on the fourteenth, the immortals of the world, along with all kings and people, gazed upward, parched with anticipation. Then, the August Ultimate Heavenly Worthy, accompanied by a host of six thousand myriad perfected beings and great sages, each riding the palaces of the moon, descended among them. All witnessed their arrival, like clouds hanging low, alighting upon the earth to secure for humanity the supreme field of blessings.

The Heavenly Worthy, attended by two companions, descended to the Cinnabar Terrace, while the remaining perfected hosts dispersed to where they were summoned. The immortals of the Cinnabar Terrace stood in attendance around the Heavenly Worthy. At midday on the fifteenth, the immortals of Green Hills—eighty-one myriad in number—all rode chariots drawn by azure dragons, bearing offerings, and arrived at the assembly. The immortals of *Qilong*—sixty-four myriad in number—all rode chariots drawn by vermilion phoenixes, bearing offerings, and arrived at the assembly. The immortals of Mount Kongtong—thirty-six myriad in number—all rode chariots drawn by white tigers, bearing offerings, and arrived at the assembly. The immortals of Mount Juci—twenty-five myriad in number—all rode chariots drawn by dark warriors, bearing offerings, and arrived at the assembly. The celestial immortals of Mount Kongtong—twenty-five hundred myriad in number—all rode chariots drawn by yellow dragons, bearing offerings, and arrived at the assembly.

In an instant, from the distant lands of the Nine Yi in the east, the Eight Barbarians in the south, the Six Rong in the west, and the Five Di in the north, immortals bearing offerings arrived by the power of the Dao, floating through the air. Each presented their offerings to the Heavenly Worthy. Once the arrangements were complete, they circled the Heavenly Worthy, pacing the void while singing praises, burning incense, scattering flowers, and performing celestial music. The harmonious sounds filled the air, divine winds lingered, and fragrant light wove through the void. Taking their places in order, they bowed and rose in measured rhythm, aligning left and right, then knelt facing north, their words hushed and breaths still. They inquired after the Heavenly Worthy’s well-being and spoke thus:

“Though the multitudes teem in chaos, evil abounds while goodness is scarce. Unworthy as we are, we have moved your august presence to descend. We, these dust-born and defiled, dare to cherish the true Dao and presumptuously await deliverance. Our merits cannot outweigh our transgressions, nor can we rouse ourselves to effort. We fear that our nine generations of ancestors bear the burden of past faults, cast into dark prisons, or reborn in distant lands, assuming strange forms. Yet by this slender thread of fate, we have encountered the Great Sage. Though unmoved, you have responded, and this noble assembly marks a propitious hour. We, humble and fleeting beings, dare to seek abundant blessings. We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will instruct us in what we have not heard, open your golden mouth, and expound the *Precious Scripture of the Middle Prime* to deliver future generations.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy lifted his gaze and looked deeply for a long while before speaking:

“The moon’s essence gathers, its net cradling radiance. The lowlands dispel heat, and the golden winds display their might. Fire and wood nurture in concealment, as the qi of warmth and coolness intermingle. The imperial blossoms drip nectar, reining in the vapors of chaos. This auspicious hour unfolds forgiveness, and the myriad emperors come to pay homage. The six dusts grow still without, and the three poisons dissolve within. Both this life and the next find peace, and boundless blessings are summoned. Before there was anywhere to go, the uncarved block scattered into primordial qi. After forms and names arose, demons and evils bore grudges. The myriad things forgot their roots, advancing and retreating against their origins. The propitious hour passes unheeded, and none reflect on the grace of the Dao. Oh, the countless multitudes—how their pain defies words.”

When the Heavenly Worthy had spoken these words, he bowed his head and flicked his fingers several times. The earth trembled, rivers and seas surged, the spirit-qi grew unsettled, and mournful winds lost their harmony. The assembled immortals rose to bow in gratitude and spoke thus:

“We do not understand why the Heavenly Worthy bowed and flicked his fingers, causing the earth to tremble, the sun and moon to dim, the spirit-qi to grow unsettled, and the mournful winds to lose their harmony. Our Dao is shallow, and we fail to grasp the profound principle. Our hearts are filled with doubt and fear, and we cannot find peace. We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, will take pity on our ignorance and deign to explain what we have not heard.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied:

“Before I had a name, the great Dao flourished, and teachings had not yet been imparted. The world was transformed by virtue. But I see that in later ages, people grew cunning, each pursuing strange doctrines, prizing knowledge and appearances. Benevolence and righteousness arose in turn, while wealth and food became the bonds of kinship. The poor, the lowly, and the weak were abandoned. Fathers and sons grew estranged, rulers and ministers disloyal. The six relations fell into strife, neighboring states became enemies, and the four seas turned to war. For these reasons, evil multiplied, and the wheel of retribution turned without end. Even now, though the people are still good, and the first holy hosts have descended to the Four Heavens below, all beings seek wisdom to escape the path of folly. Yet gradually, deceit and competition will surge, and though the hells may now lie empty, they will soon be full again. It is for this reason that I flicked my fingers.”

When the immortals heard this, they could not help but grieve. Then the immortal of Mount Kongtong rose from his seat, bowed deeply, and asked the Heavenly Worthy:

“May we inquire whether the hearts of the deluded masses can be turned back? We pray that the Heavenly Worthy, through your boundless divine power, will suppress the roots of the myriad ills, restraining them before they sprout, so that all beings may return to their roots. Let the countless multitudes preserve their original nature, abide in the One Dao, and extinguish the distinctions among beings. Let their hearts know no arising or ceasing, and their forms merge with the Great Void.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied:

“Excellent, excellent, good man! What you have spoken is the twentieth child of the great Dao. Why is this so? The great Dao originates in the uncarved void. The void scatters into primordial qi, and the primordial qi naturally gives rise to forms and life. From life, names are established, and from names, words arise.”

From words arise the true teachings; from the true teachings, wisdom arises; from wisdom, craft and deceit arise. From craft and deceit, the distinctions between foolishness and wisdom arise; from these distinctions, right and wrong arise; from right and wrong, love and hatred arise; from love and hatred, conflict and war arise; from conflict and war, rulers and ministers are established; with rulers and ministers established, rewards and punishments sprout; from rewards and punishments, profit and harm appear; from profit and harm, hidden malice arises; from hidden malice, the tally of sins is bound; with the tally of sins bound, the Dark Bureau is established; with the Dark Bureau established, there come the punishments of water and fire. This cycle turns endlessly, unfolding thus of itself—not by the Dao’s design.

What you have spoken lies beneath the ten thousand mechanisms. Therefore it is said: My Dao, though luminous, when turned from, becomes dark; my Dao, though upright, when reversed, becomes perverse; my Dao, though yielding, when abandoned, becomes rigid; my Dao, though everlasting, when slighted, perishes. The great Dao shows no partiality; it befriends only the good.

I observe the transformations of the masses—they cannot be swiftly corrected. Yet among ten thousand, one may arise who responds to harmonious qi, returning to the root and restoring the origin. For this reason, the great Dao descends to establish the true teachings, illuminating the eyes of the multitude, that they may follow its shadow. And you, later disciples, are precisely such people.

At that time, the Immortal of Kongtong rose from his seat, bowed, and asked the Heavenly Worthy: “We do not yet understand the meaning of the punishments of water and fire. We humble ones fail to comprehend—we pray you distinguish them for us.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “The punishments of water and fire comprise four kinds, two transgressions of yin and yang, for which the Dark Bureau metes out retribution. Passing through water and fire—this is what is called the punishment of ice and embers. When filth accumulates equally, scorching and sinking calamities arrive; when heaven is obstructed and earth is negated, water and fire intermingle. When the yang of heaven reaches its extreme, the eight seas billow smoke, mountains and peaks turn to ash, the gates of heaven seal shut, gold and jade melt away, the three luminaries conceal their essence, wind and thunder fan the flames, fire veils spread their blaze, and heaven and earth become a furnace.

When earth is negated, yin completes its omen: the land shifts to become a vast sea, waves surge in the midst of heaven, and the assembled immortals relocate their abodes. The Water Mother of the northwest appears like a white banner. Flocks of birds fly south, gathering at the edge of the sky. Whirlwinds stir the waves, collapsing mountains and peaks. Metal and stone grind against one another, wearing away into mud and silt.

Good man, you must now understand: these two great disasters correspond to the world below and to the myriad people. Why is this so? When the world lacks the Dao, the myriad people fail to transform. These disasters are like the five viscera of beings turning against one another, their storage and discharge unregulated, naturally forming afflictions. How much more so when the world loses the Dao and virtue decays, and the dust of the multitude accumulates equally? Heaven and earth pity them and cannot desist. First they show the teaching as suffering, then they warn through qi, and finally they display the portent. Yet foolish people do not believe in the true teachings, do not understand the signs of qi, and do not reform their evil ways. Heaven has no choice but to display its great might.

It is like a minister or child whom the lord or father cherishes and thinks of with affection. Receiving favor, they grow arrogant and willful, their hearts change, and they lose loyalty, becoming unfilial to their lord or father, secretly harboring rebellion. When their schemes are exposed, even a benevolent lord or compassionate father does not immediately destroy them but first issues commands as a warning. If the minister or child still does not repent, they are then handed over to the executioners, though the lord or father still pities them—yet they can do no other. The Heavenly Emperor is the same.

When the assembled immortals heard the Heavenly Worthy’s words, they all sighed, saying, “Never has there been such a thing!” They bowed in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy: “We have wearied your golden lips, who took pity on us humble ones and revealed what we had never heard. We bear the burden of this grace, this flowing and abundant blessing.” After their bows of gratitude were complete, the Heavenly Worthy gave instructions for them to return to their seats.

On the morning of the seventeenth day, the Orthodox Heavenly Worthy first arrived. When the true assembly had fulfilled its karmic conditions, they returned from the four heavens to the Cinnabar Terrace, inquiring of the Heavenly Worthy: “In your arising, dwelling, and transforming of the Dao, have you not wearied?” The Heavenly Worthy replied: “The transformation of the true is without toil; the transformation of the Dao is without limit. Have you, who attend to the myriad masses, grown weary or discontented?” The assembled immortals answered: “By the power and spirit of the Dao, how could we grow weary or discontented?”

The Heavenly Worthy then asked: “Have the two conditions of birth and death attained liberation?” The assembled immortals answered: “When the Heavenly Worthy descended to the Cinnabar Terrace, the sinful souls of hell were immediately liberated. Yet all the people beneath the four heavens, though liberated, have not attained release.”

At that time, the assembled immortals of the Cinnabar Terrace, hearing the words of the highest immortals, did not understand. Then the Immortal of the Prosperous Epoch rose from his seat, bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, and asked: “How is it that the sinful souls of hell, though they have not seen the Heavenly Worthy, attain liberation? How is it that all the people beneath the four heavens, though liberated, have not attained release? We pray you distinguish this for us.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Good man, listen carefully, and I will explain it to you. The great Dao conceals its function: though it saves and delivers the myriad things, it does not claim credit. Its hidden virtue carries all—through this karmic condition, it enables sinful souls to attain liberation. Yet though they are liberated, they have not attained release—this refers to the people of the world, who, though they understand that the nature of afflictions is empty, cannot escape them. Why is this so? Ordinary people, though they understand the Dharma-nature, do not cultivate the true and constant. They merely comprehend the ultimate principle, their bodies remaining in accord with the Dao. Thus the Dao and principle diverge.

It is like a person sitting in a narrow room while their mind roams the ten directions without obstruction; or expounding the ultimate principle with unobstructed eloquence, separating and uniting at will—this is called the mind entering principle, not the body entering the Dao. For this reason, though principle accords with the Dao, it cannot enable the body to enter principle. It is like wandering in a dream: the body does not follow the mind. Thus beings’ minds may enter principle, but their bodies do not enter the Dao. The mind entering principle is called ‘understanding’; the body not entering the Dao is called ‘lacking understanding.’

The boundless great Dao is unimpeded in body and mind. It can cause the worlds of a mote of dust to respond to karmic conditions all at once—thus it is said that the great Dao is naturally liberated, able to make the worlds of the ten directions appear as if viewed in the palm of the hand. The same is true of the distant past.”

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthy, having spoken these words, extended the five fingers of his left hand, and ten kinds of radiance illuminated the empty void, causing the worlds of the ten directions to behold the light together. At that time, all the perfected, immortals, and numinous beings in the great assembly clearly perceived the worlds within a mote of dust. Within the light, they also saw the two bounds of time and the karmic deeds their bodies had undergone, all distinctly and vividly.

These immortals, gazing deeply into the subtle and profound, exhaustively witnessed the true and constant Dao. They all attained the sixfold spiritual penetrations and the power of spontaneous freedom. Nine generations of their ancestors received blessings, and they were reborn into the realm of the Dao. The Heavenly Worthy’s Middle Prime affinity having reached its fulfillment, at dawn on the seventh day, the Heavenly Worthy and the great assembly together ascended the cloud chariot. Mystic winds stirred the music, purple auroras soared through the void, empty valleys echoed with hymns, and celestial chants resounded in myriad tones.

Then the assembled immortals intoned the *Step Through the Void*, saying:

Auspicious light ascends in purple haze,
The cloud chariot glides through cinnabar skies.
Fragrant winds swirl and turn,
Canopies sway, floating mists arise.
Within the Dao, the Dao returns once more,
Within the Mysterious, the Mysterious deepens anew.
True radiance knows no bounds,
The great image ultimately has no form.
The Dharma-wheel turns of itself,
The subtle sound cannot be heard.
In emptiness, we attend the Three Treasures,
In stillness, we hear the *Cavern Scripture*.
Seven transformations—wandering souls return,
Myriad qi arrest the decline of years.
Fragrant winds waft the feathered canopy,
Ethereal breaths revolve the whirlwind car.
Cool and clear, we ascend the cloud path,
Subtle and distant, we enter the boundless void.
Pitying the dust-bound children,
We respond to the mandate and expound the sacred writ.
The wondrous fruit harmonizes with this day,
Darkly it accords with the natural tally.

Then the immortals, escorting the Heavenly Worthy on high, sang praises and hymns of admiration. They entered the cloud court and passed through forty celestial gates. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy halted the immortals, saying: “The celestial path is long and distant—there is no need for such a far send-off.”

The immortals hesitated, looking up and down, for a long while. The Heavenly Worthy, moved by their devotion, addressed them again: “You, in your future cultivation, though you attain the six penetrations and endure for thousands of millions of kalpas, will still possess human bodies. Compared to the natural essence of my great assembly, your luminous qi and subtle marvels cannot yet be fully the same.”

The Heavenly Worthy then commanded the perfected of the upper qi to harmonize the mystic winds. He exhaled the supreme, infinitely transforming numinous verses—thirty-nine chapters of cloud-harmonized, pure, and elegant *Great Mystery* hymns. At that time, the essence of the sun rose aloft, the fluid of the moon flowed downward, true qi followed its natural generation, the metal winds reversed to harmony, jade forests yielded their medicine, and jasper trees bloomed. The Dharma-wheel turned thrice, streaming auroras rippled in seven waves, celestial hymns echoed beyond the heavens, and empty voids resounded with songs. He enabled the immortals to discern the superiority and inferiority of the Dao.

He further addressed the immortals: “The rarity of the supreme Dao is most subtle; its divine power is most wondrous, beyond all description. I have briefly shown you these marvels to distinguish them for you.”

The immortals rejoiced, bowing in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthy: “We only pray that the Great Sage may often manifest his presence and influence.”

Having spoken, they took their leave and returned to the lower realms.

**Chapter Eleven: The Lower Prime**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Wonders, on the morning of the fourteenth day of the tenth month, descended into the world in response to the mandate, accompanied by a host of fifty thousand myriad billions of perfected immortals from the stellar palace within the Cinnabar Heaven. His majesty and virtue transformed all beings. First, he drew the sun into his left eye and the moon into his right; the Dipper of the Left ascended his left ear, and the Dipper of the Right ascended his right ear. The Southern Dipper capped the apex of heaven, the Northern Dipper lay beneath his jade hairpin, and the Central Dipper rested between his divine feet. Azure auroras coiled around his left temple, white auroras around his right, cinnabar auroras illumined the three principles at his center, and dark clouds floated above his jade pillow. The Azure Dragon chanted on the left, the White Tiger roared on the right, the Golden Phoenix sang before him, and the Dark Warrior kept the rhythm. The five planets exhaled their qi in revolving circuits, yin radiance paused in the void to cast its light, auspicious auroras draped the celestial curtains, and immortal clouds arose like canopies. They chanted the numinous scriptures, and empty voids resounded with myriad tones.

Earth brought forth jeweled trees, hidden grasses sprouted tender shoots, orchids and irises pulsed with vitality, accumulated snow and ice melted, cold valleys warmed with harmonious qi, and deep springs emitted warmth. Divine mists blew in reverse, summoning souls and calling back spirits. Clouds and thunder wielded their sounds. Mighty numinous pheasant spirits chanted the sacred hymns, and empty voids echoed with celestial songs. The deaf and blind regained their hearing and sight, the crippled walked again, rivers and seas stilled their waves, and murky mists dispersed. True light floated in radiance, the vast heavens grew bright and clear, the five celestial bodies aligned in harmony, and the three luminaries shone together. Beings of different kinds lived in harmony, the hundred grains flourished, enemies released their sieges, and the world attained great peace. The true Dao prevailed, and demonic forces vanished.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, riding the stellar palace, arrayed the cloud court. He announced auspicious tidings to all beings and responded to the numinous portents of the assembled immortals. He sounded the bellows of the floating void and gazed down upon the Great Nonbeing. The Lower Prime brought forth auspicious blessings, and boundless felicity was stored for all. Advancing the Dao and cultivating virtue, principle accorded with the divine tally. Purple treasuries intertwined, and the six palaces bloomed like flowers. Divine power transformed the lower realms, and true qi flowed through the great void. He governed the turning of the kalpas and wandered freely within the Mysterious.

Thus, myriad transformations were inexhaustible. In an instant, he caused winter forests to burst into bloom and withered trees to flower. He restored all living beings to their true nature and gathered all kinds to conceal their origins. The Dao withdrew into profound stillness, and he dwelled in lofty solitude. Such was his divine power, proclaimed from the golden mouth.

At that time, the immortal of the Cinnabar Terrace, having long received the decree from the golden mouth of the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Prime and Supreme Pole, beheld these auspicious signs and knew that the Heavenly Worthy was descending to the divine continent. He emerged from the Cinnabar Terrace and saw from afar the radiant brilliance within the Mysterious, the exalted wonder of the stellar palace, banners and canopies filling the heavens, and the true numinous forms arrayed throughout the empty void.

All the immortals bowed their heads and entreated the Heavenly Worthy to descend upon the Cinnabar Terrace. In an instant, the Heavenly Worthy commanded one of the perfected of the left to convey his decree to the immortals: “I descend in response to the mandate to teach and transform, presiding over the Lower Prime, to guide all newly cultivated immortals toward perfection. For those who have accumulated good deeds, whose names are inscribed in the Azure Register, who morning and evening seek their vows, whose incense smoke rises to the imperial court, and whose pure chants reach the Supreme Unity—I shall reveal to them the path of cultivation. I shall command the demonic hosts to guard and protect the worldly beings who turn their hearts toward true sincerity and observe the Lower Prime’s precepts and fasts. For their nine generations of ancestors, I shall deliver both the living and the dead, enabling those who have not heard to hear, those who have not seen to see, and those who have not attained liberation to attain it.”

Those afflicted with illness and suffering, I shall heal and cure; those gripped by fear and dread, I shall grant peace and safety. Now, by the Dharma’s decree, I shall descend into the earth to proclaim the Dao and spread transformation. When the time of the Middle Prime arrives, the Supreme Unity of the Correct Dao shall descend from the Cinnabar Terrace to expound the Dharma for you.

Your merit and virtue are complete, possessing the six penetrations and unimpeded wisdom. Yet because your bodies are not self-arising and your enlightenment is newly attained, you have not yet ascended to the Great Canopy above. Those who cultivate and achieve the Dao may attain freedom, abide in eternal life without death, and have their names inscribed in the Left Register. Though eons pass like a blink, your forms renew with each dawn.

You, all the immortals, are the chosen ones. How lamentable that the multitudes of beings are as ephemeral as mayflies, born at dawn and dead by dusk, forever severed from the Dao. You must take heed of this.

At that moment, the immortals followed the Heavenly Worthy to briefly govern the earth, bestowing transformation during the Lower Prime to deliver all living beings. Then, the Heavenly Worthy, accompanied by a host of perfected immortals as numerous as motes of dust, rode upon floating rosy clouds and luminous star palaces, descending to the earth. Midway, they arrayed the palaces of the stars, hovering seven *ren* above the ground. They condensed nine-colored clouds of auspicious radiance into a great city, its towers and terraces formed from sevenfold-transforming luminous qi, its four gates forged from myriad-changing golden essence. The bolts and bars were made of adamantine radiance, the watchtowers of primordial true qi, the defenses of forbearance’s jewel-light, the moats of wisdom’s jewel-light. The springs and pools were of dark origin’s pure clarity, the stairways of fourfold-trust’s jewel-light, the trees of six perfections’ jewel-light. The flowers and fruits were of precept-pearl’s jewel-light, the banners and canopies of vermilion sparrow’s jewel-light, the divine standards of azure dragon’s jewel-light, the auspicious staffs of white tiger’s jewel-light, the bells and chimes of dark warrior’s jewel-light, the immortal music of mysterious wind’s jewel-light. The thunder of the Dharma’s jewel-light awakened all beings, the wheel of the Dharma’s jewel-light proclaimed transformation, the empty cavern’s jewel-light emitted sacred scriptures, the myriad-qi’s jewel-light summoned living souls, the divine talismans’ jewel-light called forth the dead, the yin-life’s jewel-light revived withered bones, the ninefold-transformed jewel-light eradicated chronic ailments. The celestial kitchens were of grand harmony’s jewel-light, the sweet springs of sweet dew’s jewel-light, the lamps and candles of sun-and-moon’s jewel-light, the flying canopies of fragrant clouds’ jewel-light, the mats and cushions of heavenly flowers’ jewel-light.

Then, the Heavenly Worthy, with a single flow of compassionate power, emitted rays of light that ascended to the utmost heights and descended to the lowest depths, illuminating all worlds in the ten directions. From afar, the Heavenly Worthy appeared as if present before their eyes. The great assembly beheld the ten directions as clearly as their own palms. The souls of the living and the dead all rode the light, gathering like clouds in an instant. The demonic hordes, their essence spent, also rode the light, crawling forward in submission.

At that moment, the spirits of earth and water shattered the solid ice, cleared away the piled snow, and rose halfway from the ground, drinking in the harmony of supreme transformation. The grasses and trees beneath the earth stirred their hidden roots and dormant buds, all surging forth. Though touched by frost and snow, their coiled shoots split open, ascending in clouds and exhaling crimson blossoms. In an instant, the divine peaks’ ice melted, the frozen seas thawed, and the earth’s milk—nectar of jade—flowed forth as the heavens bestowed sweet dew.

The Heavenly Worthy gazed for a long while, rejoicing in the myriad beings, knowing their hearts turned toward the Dao. Then, revealing his golden countenance, he opened his Dharma-mouth and smiled serenely. Myriad-transforming true light streamed from his golden lips. All worlds in the ten directions beheld the true form within the light, leaping with joy, unaware of their own rapture. Humans and non-humans alike fixed their thoughts and focused their minds upon the true light, which entered their hearts and eyes. For three days and nights, they remained still, untouched by weariness.

Within the true light, each saw their own souls encircling the Heavenly Worthy. In an instant, they transformed into infants, entering their bodies and sitting within their palaces, serene and unmoving. They felt their bodies renewed as youths, their complexions radiant, their hair dark, their strength like clouds.

The dead souls drank the harmonious life-qi and took human form, returning to truth and rebirth. The demonic hordes transformed their standards, their hearts now aligned with virtue and the Dao. The earth and water spirits, half-illumined by the light, attained their utmost numinosity. Those conceived in wombs, eggs, or hidden gestation were all safeguarded by their mothers, imbued with true qi. On the day of their emergence, they achieved completion according to their nature, swift and agile in flight or movement, free from premature death or harm. Chronic and recent ailments vanished at once. Venomous creatures ceased to sting, and poisonous plants and trees withered away.

The Celestial Worthy addressed all living beings: "This is not by nature, but all through the transformation of the Dao. In a single instant, divine power is fully manifested, and the myriad things are complete, receiving the true and upright qi. By the midday hour of the fifteenth day, the common folk of the lower realms each present their sincere devotion, bringing offerings of all they possess to celebrate the Lower Prime, making offerings to the Celestial Worthy with all that exists in the world."

The Celestial Worthy then addressed the assembled immortals: "The common folk differ in their offerings—some present sincere devotion, others precious treasures, grains, or silks. Even a single incense stick, a single flavor, a speck of dust, or a single hue—through the compassion of the Great Dao, all are accepted. I expound the true Dharma, demonstrate proper dignity, strengthen their roots of faith, and bring them joy. Through this cause and condition, they depart from perversity, escape the cycle of birth and death, and forever enter the stream of the Dao. How excellent! How excellent!"

At that moment, all the immortals and non-human beings, all that exists between heaven and earth—whether formed or formless—joined their voices as one, praising in unison. At that time, fragrant light lingered, rosy clouds spread across the four directions, the three luminaries intersected their paths, moving west and east in turn. True hymns filled the vastness, and celestial songs resounded in the great void. Jeweled canopies floated in mist, long banners caught the wind. Dragon kings bore censers, scattering the qi of returned souls. Immortal youths struck chimes at the four gates of the celestial city. Heavenly music harmonized, its echoes boundless. This enabled all beings to don the mysterious within the void, sit in stillness upon flying dragons, silently recite sacred scriptures, plant roots in past kalpas, and bear fruit in the future. In the present, they transcended all limits, forgot the two extremes, dissolved all defilements, and rested in the silent abyss of no-mind. From the darkness, light and qi emerged—soft yet firm, yielding yet unyielding.

When the Celestial Worthy had finished expounding this Dharma, he entered the Great Compassion Samadhi. In an instant, cold valleys exhaled winds that stirred the jeweled canopies, their bells ringing with hollow echoes that transformed into mournful sounds. Dark clouds ceased to drift, true light shone resplendent, divine mist enveloped the cosmos, the seven luminaries withdrew their radiance, the sun’s path shifted south, the moon’s course turned to the yin. The nine earths solidified once more, all rivers froze into stillness, water essences floated in light, wandering qi concealed their forms. The damp-dwelling clans retreated to the depths, shelled creatures coiled in stillness, insects and worms hid in silence, swallowing their voices.

Then, at the midday hour of the fifteenth day, the Celestial Worthy slightly moved his left hand, aligning his divine mind, and snapped his fingers three times. At that moment, the assembled immortals and common folk saw the Celestial Worthy emerge from the Great Compassion Samadhi. Joyfully, they bowed their heads and said: "We are humbled by the toil of the Merciful Venerable in transforming and delivering beings, liberating both the hidden and the manifest without end. Our joy is boundless, and both the sacred and the profane rejoice. Yet we do not understand: before delivering all beings, why did the Celestial Worthy’s golden countenance first break into a smile? After delivering them, why did he then enter great sorrow, causing the sun and moon to dim, the seven luminaries to withdraw their light, frost to congeal, fierce winds to blow, the imperial path to shift south, the moon’s course to turn yin, all things to wither, and the five viscera to hold grief? The sound of your snapping fingers made all hearts grieve. We beseech you to explain and resolve our doubts."

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Good sons, you should know that my initial smile arose from joy at the turning of beings toward the Dao, for they are easily delivered. Yet after their deliverance, one must not forget great compassion. To forget great compassion is to deliver yet not deliver. For this reason, I entered the Great Compassion Samadhi for all beings, snapped my fingers at my heart, demonstrating the harmony of inner and outer, and turned the Dharma Wheel three times for the multitude. The supreme Great Dao operates thus."

Upon hearing this, all doubts were instantly resolved. Again, they bowed their heads to the Celestial Worthy, saying: "We thank you for dispelling our confusion with your golden words. The appointed hour has come, and we now humbly request that the Celestial Worthy and the sacred assembly, in your compassion, accept the offerings of all beings—countless as motes of dust—fulfilling their aspirations. We pray you bestow your kindness."

At that time, the Celestial Worthy did not refuse their request. The great assembly arranged their seats and received the offerings. Then, through the power of expedient means, as the Celestial Worthy was about to receive the food, he commanded the Central Perfected of his left retinue to swiftly ascend to the Great Luo of the upper realm and retrieve two vessels of Supreme Void Jeweled Light, each perfectly round. These were placed upon his seat. From the mysterious void, one vessel was first filled with the natural celestial cuisine of the Great Luo Heaven—essence of the sun and moon. The other, an empty vessel, was prepared to receive the sincere offerings of the beings below.

At that moment, all the people beneath the four heavens, along with various non-human beings, presented their offerings—whether by hand, mouth, or heart. All arrived simultaneously before the Celestial Worthy’s seat, each harboring doubts about the smallness of the vessel. The Celestial Worthy, knowing their uncertainty, said to them: "Simply offer your gifts; do not嫌 the vessel’s size." The people, still doubtful, dared not reply. The Celestial Worthy said again: "Your hearts are hesitant, unable to decide. I know you嫌 this vessel too small."

Then the Celestial Worthy commanded the Central Perfected to lower the vessel, slightly tilting its mouth toward the assembly, and said: "Those who wish to offer gifts should first have the kings, then the ministers, the multitudes, and all non-human beings enter my vessel, each holding their sincere hearts." The assembly received the command and looked down at the vessel, suddenly seeing it boundless, its depth unfathomable. All the people beneath the four heavens presented their offerings at once, entering the vessel—some by cart, some by carriage, some on foot, some riding—ascending, descending, flying, or walking, all without obstruction. Those who had not yet entered saw the vessel as small, but upon entering, they realized it had no bounds. They marveled, saying: "Our petty wisdom sought to measure the Celestial Worthy’s vessel of the Great Void, which does not even receive dust or dew. This is the covering of our afflictions and hindrances, preventing us from knowing the Dharma vessel of the Great Dao. Had the Celestial Worthy not commanded the Central Perfected to tilt the vessel and show us, our hearts would have remained doubtful, and our offerings would have gained no merit."

At that time, when all the people had entered the precious vessel, they traversed its expanse without finding its limits. They beheld therein boundless worlds. Gazing upward, they saw heaven upon heaven in succession, while the sun, moon, and stars shone twice as brightly as in the lower realms. Within the vessel were Celestial Perfected and Great Sages, the void’s vast emptiness, seas of sweet dew, mountains of a hundred treasures, celestial birds and beasts, hidden herbs and jade trees, fragrant clouds and winds, Dharma thunder and Dharma rain. Then the assembly looked again at their offerings, which now seemed insignificant beyond words.

As they continued their journey, they suddenly arrived at the place where the Celestial Worthy expounded the Dharma. Emerging from the vessel, they did so unknowingly. At that moment, the radiant light remained undiminished, timeless at its center. The Celestial Worthy, moved by their wholehearted presentation of offerings, wished to reveal through expedient means the rare delicacies of the celestial kitchen. He addressed the kings, princes, ministers, multitudes, immortals, and non-human beings within the great assembly, saying: "I am humbled that you have come so far for the Dao to present these offerings to me. I have accepted them on your behalf."

The people, ashamed of the meagerness of their offerings, remained silent. Perceiving their thoughts, the Celestial Worthy spoke again: "The Great Celebration of the Lower Kalpa has arrived, and myriad blessings converge as the time of the fast approaches. Fearing you may grow hungry, I have first filled this vessel with the celestial kitchen of the Great Void of the upper realms, wishing to offer you the supreme Dharma food. You should now take your seats and receive this Dharma nourishment."

The people sat in order, but as they did so, they recalled their earlier offerings and their entry into the precious vessel of the Great Void. Each grew doubtful, saying to one another: "Were our offerings and entry into the vessel a dream, or were they waking reality? The vessel was so small—if this were waking reality, we should not have been able to enter; yet if it were a dream, we should not have had the intention to offer." Moreover, though the vessel was but a few inches in size, all the heavens and earth were contained within it. Bewildered, they could not discern the truth.

Then, among the assembly, a king named Resolute Mind addressed them: "Our great multitude has not yet attained the true Dao and constantly wanders as if in a dream. Whether the Dharma vessel is large or small, whether we enter or not, whether we offer or not—all is as one in a dream. Say no more; simply reflect. The appointed hour has come, and the Celestial Worthy, in his compassion, offers us the supreme Dharma food."

In an instant, the Celestial Worthy commanded seven youthful messengers to harness a six-dragon chariot and carry the celestial vessel, serving the Dharma food in turn to the great assembly, immortals, and multitudes, allowing each to take as much as they wished. Once sated, they stored the remaining food within the vessel, yet the celestial kitchen did not diminish in the least. As they ate, the flowers of their five viscera bloomed, their intestines and stomachs filled, their ears and eyes grew keen, their joints harmonized, all illnesses vanished forever, the six senses opened, and they reflected on the grace of the Dao. They attained the six penetrations of wisdom, and in reflecting on past and future, the karmic conditions of ninety thousand great kalpas became as clear as their own palms. Only then did they realize that their former minds had been as dreams and illusions.

Then Resolute Mind and the great assembly bowed to the Celestial Worthy and asked: "Does the celestial kitchen ever come to an end?" The Celestial Worthy replied: "Only when the void itself comes to an end will the celestial kitchen be exhausted. Thus does the Great Dao possess the inexhaustible treasury to provide for all beings."

Resolute Mind asked further: "What is the karmic retribution for partaking of this celestial kitchen?" The Celestial Worthy answered: "Those who eat of the celestial kitchen shall have boundless lifespans, their forms becoming as the Great Void."

Then the Celestial Worthy commanded the Central Perfected to tilt the precious vessel, scattering its contents into the celestial kitchen, which then settled into the empty void. Where it touched grasses and trees, they transformed into flowers and fruits; the essence of the sun and the fluid of the moon became sweet dew. That which drifted in the void became the true light and harmonious qi. After ten thousand kalpas, if there be a virtuous Son of Heaven or any seeker of the Dao who drinks this sweet dew or consumes this harmonious qi, or if ordinary people eat of these fruits, each shall receive benefit according to their inherent nature.

At that time, the assembly, witnessing these wondrous and inconceivable marvels, jointly addressed the Celestial Worthy: "The supreme and subtle Dharma of the Great Dao is unmatched in its divine power. This great assembly, having already received the Celestial Worthy’s compassionate grace, though unworthy and impure, now wishes to accompany you briefly on your celestial journey, traveling to the upper realms to fulfill our rites and aspirations. We hope this may be granted by your great compassion."

The Celestial Worthy asked: "After partaking of the Dharma food, how do your hearts feel?" The great assembly each replied: "After the Dharma food, we are ten thousand times better than before."

The Celestial Worthy asked further: "What of the mind of your former dreams—does it remain or has it vanished?" They answered: "After the Dharma food, all dream-thoughts have vanished at once."

The Celestial Worthy said: "You all wish to see the upper realms. Reflect once more, and you shall see for yourselves." The great assembly reflected for a long while.

The Celestial Worthy asked: "What do you see?" They answered: "We see nothing at all."

He asked again: "What do you hear?" They replied: "We hear nothing at all."

He asked further: "Where does your mind arise? Your eyes see nothing. Where does your mind cease? Your ears hear nothing."

They answered: "The mind does not arise; the eyes see nothing. The mind does not cease; the ears hear nothing."

The Celestial Worthy said: "To see without seeing is called true seeing; to hear without hearing is called true hearing. The supreme Great Dao is without arising or ceasing. Without hearing, without seeing, without going, without coming, without body, without mind, without light, without form—its form pervades the Great Void."

After speaking these words, the Celestial Worthy gathered the great assembly into the precious vessel of the Great Void and cast it upward. The two vessels ascended simultaneously, reaching the Great Firmament of the Supreme Void in the time it takes to snap one’s fingers. Then each person saw the Primordial Qi’s Revered One, solitary and serene, seated in the profound void. From its midst emerged the spontaneous and numinous verses of the empty cavern, yet without light or form—profound, dark, and still.

At that moment, each person in the assembly offered their reverent vows, bowing their heads for a long while. They inquired of the Celestial Worthy, saying: "We know not how the Great Sage, the Celestial Worthy, abides in solitary serenity, forever apart from the world, utterly beyond fame or renown—leaving those below, the common folk, yearning with earnest devotion, seeking abundant blessings yet finding nowhere to turn. We only pray that the Celestial Worthy will proclaim the transformative power of the Dao and deliver future generations." Again they bowed their heads for a long while, prostrating themselves without rising.

The Celestial Worthy made no reply. In an instant, the empty void dissolved into nothingness. Only a drifting, floating qi remained in the heavens, as if present yet absent. Then, faintly from the pure heavens above, there arose the subtle sound of the numinous verses of the empty cavern—audible when one bent to listen, yet vanished when one looked up. Endless and obscure, upon careful listening, one might catch the words, yet their meaning remained elusive and indistinct.

Then the Celestial Worthy raised his hand of great compassion amidst the assembly, reaching into the summit of existence to draw all the people back into the gathering. In an instant, he cast them forth again, encircling the ten directions and the worlds as numerous as motes of dust. In the time it takes to snap one’s fingers, they circled seven times before returning to the assembly. Each person then knew within themselves that by the divine power of the Dao, they had witnessed the boundless realms of the Dao throughout the ten directions. Emerging once more from the vessel, all was clear and distinct, their minds free of doubt. Only then did they realize that in the upper realms, the empty void holds nothing at all.

At that time, as the Celestial Worthy and the assembled multitude reached the third watch of the night on the sixteenth day, he gathered the celestial treasures of the Great Void, along with all the luminous qi and every majestic adornment, and entered the stellar palace. Then, all the immortals, divine beings, numinous beings, human kings, and the countless multitudes below knew that the Celestial Worthy’s true transformative work was complete and that he was about to return to the upper realms. Fearing that thereafter there would be no place to resolve their doubts, the newly initiated Daoists and all future generations, wishing to establish the Three Primes Offering, yet unclear about its rituals and methods, realized that never again would they witness such effortless liberation as the Celestial Worthy’s transformative grace that day. Together, they earnestly entreated the Celestial Worthy to instruct future disciples on how to establish blessings and cultivate merit, ensuring their eventual success.

The Celestial Worthy then addressed the assembly, saying: "The Great Celebration of the Three Primes is by nature the most auspicious time of the Dao’s spontaneous workings, the propitious day when the multitudes of perfected beings pay homage to the Supreme Ultimate. It is the crucial moment for those below—immortals and common folk alike—to cultivate themselves and deliver the departed. At this time, merits and transgressions are examined, fortunes and misfortunes are assessed. The Celestial Emperor gazes down, the officials of wrongdoing investigate and impeach; the earthly administrators submit their reports, the watery bureaus record the accounts. Those with merit attain perfection, while those with transgressions are demoted and punished. The underworld’s tribunals impose their judgments, and suffering defies description. If you wish to perform the offering, you must follow the proper method: for three days and three nights, burn incense, make reverent repentance, concentrate your thoughts on the Dao, chant the scriptures and precepts, and constantly maintain the Ten Remembrances:

First, remember the grace of the Dao;
Second, remember the grace of the scriptures;
Third, remember the grace of the masters;
Fourth, remember the grace of heaven;
Fifth, remember the grace of parents;
Sixth, remember the grace of the benevolent spirits;
Seventh, remember the grace of benefactors;
Eighth, remember the grace of good friends;
Ninth, remember the grace of the past;
Tenth, remember the grace of the present.

The Celestial Worthy declared: "If there are good men and women who cultivate these Ten Remembrances, they will be born into the Ten Virtuous Paths. Within each single virtue, ten spirits will protect and guard them—thus they are called the body of a hundred spirits. Those who lack the Ten Remembrances are called the body of a hundred evils, for the hundred kinds of benevolent spirits will turn against and plunder them. The superior person who cultivates the Ten Remembrances will attain true immortality; the middling person will extend their lifespan; the lesser person will attain longevity."

The Celestial Worthy continued: "For the Three Primes Offering, whether abundant or modest, what matters is the盛 purity and unity of inner and outer devotion. On this day, all the great sages of the heavens descend to observe, and the benevolent spirits oversee the offering, standing at your left and right. For three days and three nights, your merits and transgressions are reported above. You must be diligent and earnest, never negligent. The Dao dwells within the profound, yet it gazes upon your heart from afar."

**Chapter Twelve: The Circulation of the Precious Scripture of the Three Primes**

At that time, the heavenly kings of the four heavens below stepped forward to bow. The Heavenly King of Resolute Mind addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: "We do not yet know by what name this scripture, expounded by the Celestial Worthy, should be called. How should it be upheld? How should it be circulated?"

"How is it to be revered? How is it to be entrusted? We humbly request that you distinguish and elucidate what we have not yet heard."

The Celestial Worthy declared: "Good men, this scripture is named *The Supreme Dao’s Precious Scripture of the Three Primes*. As the scripture instructs, it is to be reverently upheld and widely proclaimed throughout the four heavens below, ensuring it is never severed. Wherever this scripture resides, it shall be stored in a separate case, with incense burned in offering. It is to be entrusted to enlightened kings, princes, great ministers, and Dao-seeking scholars. In places of fasting and purification, they shall expound it to others, awakening those who have not yet heard."

At that moment, the great assembly, having heard the Celestial Worthy’s words, burned incense, scattered flowers, and circled in praise, obeying the divine command.

As the night reached the first watch of the fifth watch, the Celestial Worthy ascended into the void and departed. The immortals lingered upon the cloud-paths, gazing longingly at the celestial chariot, and chanted the *Step-in-Emptiness*:

*Swiftly we rise on the cloud-path,*
*Dimly we enter the endless dawn.*
*The star-officials recede into distance,*
*Eons stretch far beyond reckoning.*
*We strain to hear the golden countenance fade,*
*Yearning, we fix our thoughts on the divine radiance.*
*May we follow the rosy chariot,*
*Burning incense, bowing in reverence at dawn.*

*The mystic wind turns the flying canopy,*
*Purple qi suffuses the immortal carriage.*
*Floating aloft without need of steeds,*
*Merging with light, it suddenly ascends into nothingness.*
*Lingering, we mourn the world below,*
*Glancing back in compassion for all beings.*
*The true transformation of the Three Primes complete,*
*It vanishes effortlessly into the Great Void.*
*Myriad qi drift upward into the void,*
*A thousand lights merge with the Supreme Subtlety.*
*Between the clouds, we glimpse the radiant canopy,*
*In the emptiness, we catch sight of the rosy robes.*
*The true form enters the cloud-path,*
*Its perfect brilliance follows the wind in flight.*
*May we attend the assembly of the Three Primes,*
*And return with the golden countenance upon the turning of fate.*

Then, the immortals of the lower realms and the great assembly, having completed the *Step-in-Emptiness*, raised their gaze to the cloud-paths, straining to behold the divine radiance. Their eyes followed the rosy trail of the celestial chariot as they bowed in farewell to the True Emperor.

In an instant, purple clouds descended from the heavens, and a light mist arose from the earth. Mist and rosy clouds intertwined, and only the celestial music gradually faded into the distance.

The great assembly then returned to their respective lands, where they propagated the Dao and its teachings as proclaimed by the Golden Mouth, circulating the precious scripture, holding fasts, giving lectures, and convening assemblies. Throughout the four heavens below, all received the mysterious blessings, their fortune and virtue boundless.

Here ends Scroll Four of *The Jade Clarity Scripture of the Supreme Dao*.

**Scroll Five of *The Jade Clarity Scripture of the Supreme Dao***
**Chapter Thirteen: The Eight Seasonal Festivals**

At that time, the Western Numinous Supreme Immortal, together with one thousand two hundred attendants, on the morning of the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month in the third year of the August Emperor of the Void, harnessed their flying-dragon chariots, ascended the cloud paths, and entered the Jade Clarity Heaven to pay homage to the Highest Perfected Supreme Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion. They sought to receive *The True Scripture of the Eight Seasonal Festivals* and to behold the august majesty of the Most Sagely, the wondrous and subtle transformations of the Central Heavenly Blessed Realm governed by the Supreme Dao.

Their hearts advanced toward the Heavenly Gate, their steps traversed the cloud courts. They arrayed their dignified bearing, then prostrated and knelt as one. After a long while, gazing upward toward the cloud palaces above, they beheld the True Emperor of Great Compassion—his divine countenance serene and luminous, his radiance vast and distant, his presence tranquil and flowing, abiding at the heart of heaven, seated amidst the light of clouds like ethereal dawn, faint against the dark sky, enveloped in floating clouds that cradled the morning glow. His eyes shone like the rising sun, his brows arched like the crescent moon; his hair, deep blue, coiled like mist, his lips, crimson, exhaled rosy clouds. Upon his head rested the golden essence of ten thousand transformations; his body was adorned with the jade silk of a hundred million revolutions. His hands soared to sustain the heavens, his feet trod the Turning Celestial Pivot. In subtlety and obscurity, in emptiness and profundity, he dwelled—where the Dao abides eternally, where principle accords with non-arising. True communion responds with essence, wondrous resonance stirs the spirit. Neither concealed nor manifest, neither turbid nor clear; as if present, as if absent, as if dim, as if bright. Bending to the realm of sentience, ascending into formlessness, he dwelt in boundless seclusion, expounding the true scriptures in silence. His divine chant, though soundless, resounded; his true form unmoving, yet his transformative work never ceased. His hands revolved the eight qi, his feet turned the seven meridians. He gathered all living beings, yet claimed no merit in nurturing and sustaining; his hidden virtue defied description—how could it be forcibly named? The radiance of the Dao knew no limit, the dark origin was unfathomable. Where did his heart reside? His form wandered beyond all bounds, vanishing into dim obscurity, vast and ever-empty. Merging past and future, he needed not abide in the center. Without arising, without ceasing, without beginning, without end. The True Sovereign was attended by a host of divine beings. Jade bells marked the rhythm, golden censers wafted fragrant mists; sweet dew flowed as nectar, numinous qi congealed into clouds. True light shone through, incense winds suffused the air, luminous and primordial, where the germ and the decayed were indistinct. Beyond naming, all arose naturally.

At that time, the assembled immortals gazed upon the True Emperor, their hearts never wearying. They forgot their forms, their awe and virtue utterly lost. They wished to speak yet could not voice their silence; the Dao’s mysteries were inexhaustible, their sincerity rare and profound. After a moment, they bowed again, their hearts desiring to express something, yet fearing they could not articulate it. Daring to brave his majestic presence, they could only reflect on the grace of the Dao.

Then the True Emperor, moved by their trembling reverence, commanded the Left Attendant Supreme Perfected to address the immortals: “You are immortals of the Three Heavens, fortunate by past blessings to have entered the Dao’s current, already ascended to the stage of no retreat. Yet you must still cultivate the supreme and secret essentials, serving as salvation for the world, never resting for even an instant. Why have you come here, yet remain silent?”

“We, the great sages, though supremely exalted, have not forgotten great compassion. Our every movement and rest pervades the Six Voids; our hearts roam amidst ten thousand affairs. Sincerity inevitably evokes response—nothing can oppose it.”

Then the immortals knelt and spoke: “We, your humble servants, unworthy though we are, have long cherished the path of true immortality. Our forms are worn, our bones coarse, utterly dust-laden and defiled. Yet by the boundless, universal compassion of heaven’s grace, we who were scattered and withered have been restored to flourishing. We have been bathed in the golden talismans, our bones nurtured by jade inscriptions. Our living corpses have drunk from the vast springs of the dark origin, sipped the flowing blessings of the Cavernous Clarity. We have heard that when the Dao is exhausted, it returns; when things reach their limit, they revert. Even the dust-laden and defiled constantly yearn for their origin. For countless kalpas, we have longed to behold the august presence of the Most High. Yet we feared our habitual tendencies had not dissolved and dared not approach lightly. In hesitation, eons have passed. Unexpectedly, we seized the opportunity of fate, stepped into the celestial courts, and encountered the Heavenly Worthy, fulfilling our long-held aspirations. We have long wished to consult and inquire but dared not voice our words. Gazing upon your true majesty, we were suddenly lost, our five senses unmoored, our mouths unable to speak. Only by the profound and abiding love of the Compassionate Worthy, who deigned to bestow guidance and lend your majestic light, have we found the courage to speak. Daring to exert our humble efforts, we express these meager sentiments.”

Then the Left Perfected, obeying the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, propagated the Dao and its teachings, resolving the doubts of later learners. He addressed the immortals: “What is your wish? Speak freely.”

The immortals, overjoyed, bowed in gratitude to the Perfected and said: “Though the Dao resides in people, it is not a matter of valuing the law over life. Through eons of toil and suffering, we have scaled peaks and traversed perilous paths, crossed waters and passed through fire, undaunted by hardship and danger. Thus, the Highest Perfected took pity on our ignorance and bestowed upon us the sacred texts. True qi spread boundless blessings; the Great Dao descended talismans of yin generation. We revived the endangered souls of the departed, restored the withered and decayed forms of the living. Above, we were ashamed before the ever-renewing Dao; below, we daily renewed our virtue in the lower realm. For countless kalpas, we have cycled through the Three Heavens. Unexpectedly, we ascended by fate, and the dust-laden entered the Jade Clarity’s realm. We parted the six mists, emerged through the eight heavens, tore through the nets of the three realms, and ascended to the seventh stage of enlightenment. Though we have cultivated the Dao’s subtle merits, we have not yet dissolved into the formless. Today, we are fortunate to enter the birthless birth of the Supreme Mystery—our birth in the Dao is secure. Our long-held aspirations have reached their culmination here. Yet with hearts still stirred, we wish to hear the essentials of the Eight Seasonal Festivals. By establishing fasts and performing meritorious deeds, we seek blessings, atone for transgressions, liberate beings from sorrow and suffering, open the path to life and death, and ascend into the source of the Dao.”

Then the Perfected, hearing the immortals’ words, exclaimed in surprise: “How is it that you, who dwell in the Three Heavens, have come to hear of the essentials of the Eight Seasonal Festivals? This is none other than the first chapter of *The Treasured Writ of the Spirit-Generating of the Supreme Ultimate*—a scripture concealed by the Heavenly Emperor, cultivated by the Supreme Perfected, transmitted orally, its text unseen. It is to be bestowed only upon those destined to achieve perfection in the future.”

"How have you come to hear of this?"

Then the immortals kowtowed and replied: "This humble one dwells far from the sages, and the true writs have long been hidden and lost. It was only at the first assembly of the Nine Perfected at the Dragon-Initiation, when we celebrated the Supreme One of the Void and Non-Being, the Heavenly Venerable, that the Great Sage emerged to bestow the Dharma and instruct the Perfected. Though we heard the titles of the scriptures chanted, we never beheld their texts. We have held them in our hearts ever since, never once forsaking them. Now, in our longing and reverence, we dare to speak of this, though we fear offending the will of Heaven. Yet in Your great compassion, we pray You show us kindness and mercy."

The Perfected One declared: "You bear the marks of truth and are worthy to hear the supreme Dharma. Your destiny aligns with the time to achieve perfection. I shall transmit this treasured scripture to one such as you. But to violate the precepts by careless disclosure is to forfeit the Dao and lose one’s true nature."

Then the immortals bowed and assented to the Perfected One, vowing to obey His teachings and never dare to be negligent or reckless.

Thereupon, the Perfected One commanded the Golden Youth to burn celestial incense of precious names, open the golden terrace’s treasure store, unlock the casket and reveal its contents. He brought forth *The Treasured Scripture of the Eight Seasonal Festivals*, placing it upon a jade table before the Heavenly Venerable. All the immortals bowed as one, prostrating themselves for a long while, too awestruck to speak.

The Heavenly Venerable, perceiving their intent, inclined His head in compassion and commanded the Perfected One to present the treasured scripture to the immortals. Having received it, they bowed again to the Heavenly Venerable.

The Perfected One said: "This scripture is the sacred text of the supreme Dao. Long ago, the Heavenly Venerable of Great Compassion gathered the clouds of qi to form its words, and all the Perfected Ones looked up to follow its teachings. The true qi of the great Dao transformed into cloud-seal script, and once its qi dispersed, the numinous chapters vanished into emptiness. If you wish to copy it, carve jade into tablets and inscribe them with purple gold. When the transcription is complete, you must return it to me."

The Perfected One continued: "You immortals shall now retire to the Western Terrace of the Numinous Palace to transcribe the true writ. There, a celestial kitchen will provide for all who study, and a cinnabar terrace amid jasper groves awaits your leisure and repose."

All the immortals joyfully accepted the command. They withdrew to the Western Terrace, where they carved jade and inlaid gold, transcribing the numinous script.

The *Precious Scripture of the Eight Solar Terms* by the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy states:

On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), the warming qi first arises. The Cloud Palace opens its northeastern gate, and the Three Offices present themselves in audience to determine good and evil.

On the day of *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox), the harmonizing qi first takes form. The Cloud Palace opens its due eastern gate, and the Three Offices present themselves in audience to determine good and evil.

On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), the balmy qi first arises. The Cloud Palace opens its southeastern gate, and the Three Offices present themselves in audience to determine good and evil.

On the day of *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice), the scorching qi first takes form. The Cloud Palace opens its due southern gate, and the Three Offices present themselves in audience to determine good and evil.

On the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), the cooling qi first arises. The Cloud Palace opens its southwestern gate, and the Three Offices present themselves in audience to determine good and evil.

On the day of *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox), the chilling qi first takes form. The Cloud Palace opens its due western gate, and all the spirits assemble in audience to deliberate and record the registers of sin and blessing, life and death. Every deed of merit or transgression, no matter how minute, is laid bare. The Perfected Ones inscribe them in great detail, and all spirits receive their charges. Merit and fault, even to the finest degree, are reported without fail.

On the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), the stern qi first arises. The Cloud Palace opens its northwestern gate, and the Three Offices present themselves in audience to determine good and evil.

On the day of *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice), the congealing qi first takes form. The Cloud Palace opens its due northern gate, and the Three Offices present themselves in audience to determine good and evil.

The Heavenly Worthy instructs those who would come to study the true Way: Cultivate my Dao of the Eight Solar Terms, establish merit and practice the teachings. Let your body never tread the path of wrongdoing, nor your will stray into crooked ways. Always observe purification rites to seek ascent and deliverance. Be steadfast from beginning to end, and provide for all necessities. With a sincere and diligent heart, ever strive to save the burning; with unwavering devotion, never forget in movement or stillness. Constantly reflect on the Way of the master as if he were present before you. In solitude within secluded groves, sever all worldly affairs. Perform the six-hour rites and prayers to seek secret union. Tirelessly and subtly, neither rise nor cease. When merit is complete and practice perfected, you shall meet with the Perfected Ones.

One day before each solar term, perform the Dao, offer prayers, and present what your heart desires, so that your qi harmonizes with the incense smoke. Let your every action in the six hours be heard above, and let your conduct conform to ritual. Sit in silent meditation and refine your thoughts for three days and nights to lift the karmic bonds of your nine generations of ancestors and atone for the gravest transgressions of your own life. First for the Son of Heaven, then for all the people. In the gate of those who uphold the Dao, exert your strength to perform meritorious deeds, provide for vegetarian feasts, and make offerings together. On these days, sincerity reaches all without fail, and the Dao hears all without exception. Let those who cherish the Dao practice diligently.

The superior practitioner maintains perpetual purification, not only at these times, but constantly prays for ascent and deliverance without the slightest respite. Let your form sever all external wanderings, and your will not seek crooked ends. If you cultivate life and attain life, what cause for worry remains?

Thereupon, the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy expounded the *Scripture of the Lute-Heart, Upper Scroll*. Its text reads:

Turn your head to gaze upon the Round Net,
Converge the light to draw in the numinous radiance.
Restrain the hun-soul and govern the seven po,
In contemplation discern the central square.

In motion or stillness, bow to the Void,
In rest or sleep, repose in the Mystic Chamber.
When hungry, feast on the Yellow Jade Flower,
When thirsty, drink the Jade Root Nectar.
The spirit’s banner commands the great demons,
Unite the body to refine the true light.
Reflect again to contemplate the Great Nothingness,
Ever roaming within the emptiness.
At the edge of the people’s waves, the Perfect Permeation,
The true transformation knows no midway halt.
Profound and boundless, without end or beginning—
Let the practitioner clearly understand this.
In silence, forget doctrines and teachings,
Respond to the times to expound the grand principles.
The descending Dao does not reveal itself;
One must first enact what is to be bestowed.
Converging in the non-dual realm,
Following the heart, it naturally unites or parts.

The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy says: Those of later generations who attain the Perfected and receive this text of mine shall regulate the Void Lute and practice accordingly. They shall ever stand beneath the Azure Canopy, riding a pair of white tigers, flanked by two red dragons. Before the kalpas began, the sages knew no end. After eighteen years, they shall witness the Great Peace. The origin of the true Dao—guard it well, do not recklessly proclaim it. If one’s seven ancestors are subjected to judgment, their bodies shall not attain immortality, and for countless kalpas, all hope shall be lost, severed from the Dao.

At that time, the immortal carved the jade scripture, returned the sutra to the Perfected One, and presented the new text to the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy declared: This precious scripture of the Supreme Dao may be transmitted to three persons in seven hundred years. If no such person exists in the world, conceal it in a jade coffer and forbid its reckless dissemination.

Thereupon, the immortal bowed deeply in reverence and gratitude: "This humble one is fortunate to have received this secret dharma. By the boundless compassion of the Venerable One, I am filled with joy beyond expression." Again, he bowed deeply.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "You have received the precious scripture, and the true Dao is now complete within you. Diligently practice it, and you shall come to understand of your own accord."

The Heavenly Worthy continued: "Now go and wander through the jade realms of the Yuqing Dao. After the Autumn Equinox, return once more to the lower world."

Thereupon, the immortal, obeying the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, bowed in joyful reverence and gratitude, then paid homage to the Perfected One. The Perfected One said: "Your journey by grace follows the established law. In the Yuqing Heaven, the Heavenly Worthy possesses a chariot of true light, bestowed upon the immortals and perfected beings to traverse the ten directions. Those who ride this chariot shall circle the worlds of dust in an instant."

Having received these instructions, the immortal mounted the chariot of true light. In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the southwestern void of the Yuqing Heaven, a boundless expanse beyond measure. On the morning of the twenty-eighth day, at the time of the Autumn Equinox, he suddenly beheld countless heavenly immortals and perfected beings entering through the western gate of the cloud palace. They arrayed themselves in celestial order, setting forth offerings that filled the mysterious void. Incense burned, flowers scattered, and heavenly musicians played, singing praises as they paid homage to the Heavenly Worthy for three days and three nights.

The Three Offices reviewed the records of life and death, of sins and blessings. Those deemed worthy of deliverance had their names inscribed on blue bamboo slips. Cloud chariots descended from the heavens, lifting them into the void, flesh and bone ascending together, forever to become true immortals. Those whose sins piled like dust had their names recorded in the black ledger. Their years were diminished, their lifespans stolen, their corpses cast into the Nine Dark Realms, their sinful souls subjected to judgment, lost for ten thousand kalpas without hope of return.

At that time, the officials of the Three Offices each presented their reports. Ascending and descending in opposing motions, their tones differed in sorrow and joy. The celestial officials played harmonious and refined melodies; the terrestrial officials played solemn and measured tunes; the aquatic officials played the mournful songs of souls lost in eternal night. The winds howled, shattering metal and stone; the stern qi stirred the cries of wind and rain. These were the natural sounds of heaven and earth, ever present at the juncture of fortune and misfortune.

Though the cacophony was vast, the Great Dao’s Heavenly Worthy had never heard it. His mind remained serene in the mysterious, utterly undisturbed. The filth and clamor of the Three Offices did not reach his ears or eyes. In every response, he remained silent, communicating without words, intuitively perceiving the hearts of others. He weighed and acted as was fitting, bestowing life without claim to merit, his hidden virtues never erring.

Yet all living beings go about their days in ignorance. Though the Great Dao is lofty, its mirror is lowly. The Great Dao remains still, yet acts when the moment is ripe. It neither comes nor goes, neither hastens nor lingers, neither perishes nor endures, neither unites nor separates, neither empties nor fills. Its movements leave no trace.

My radiance unfurls like blossoms, twin lights gleaming. It cycles through the purple gates, resting in the golden chambers. The six qi flow downward, the three origins ascend. Neither swift nor slow, neither diminished nor increased, it shines of its own accord. It banishes death and welcomes life, acting without acting, moving without moving. The true spirit remains unmoved, yet transforms and harmonizes all things.

The true spirit’s original mind responds with original emotion. It can contract or expand, conceal or reveal. Neither dual nor centered, neither following nor meeting, neither rising nor falling, neither dying nor living. It takes form without form, is named without name. It is bright in darkness, clear in turbidity. Neither solitary nor gregarious, neither blended nor merged. Vast and subtle, it neither conforms nor resists. It goes without destination, comes without return, dwells without abode, moves without reliance. It strides the void without traversing, sits yet responds to all things. Elusive and indistinct, it remains undisturbed in profound stillness.

Many despise me, few cherish me. They chase foul scents like dust, how can they return to the numinous mechanism? Enveloped in delusion, their actions breed doubt. Turning from the Dao, they drift and perish—who shall return? Wandering alone on perilous paths, how pitiable their solitude. Adrift on the river without turning back, when shall they return against the current? Forever wailing in the Three Paths, eternally grieving through the Nine Nights, their suffering souls scattered, their sorrows heaped high.

I tell you, those yet to come: the Dao is like the morning sun, virtue like the flowing stream. It is ever new, ever returning. Below, it gathers the ten thousand rivers; above, it governs the thousand mechanisms. It illuminates without vexation, abides without dissipation. No emotion can reflect it, no mind can perceive it. The eight trigrams turn in emptiness, the seven luminaries revolve in void. Naturally, it weaves the warp and weft of existence, the essence of all living things. Subtle within the subtle, wondrous within the wondrous.

I tell you, those yet to come: in action, do not stray from the constant; in movement, do not depart from the void. Abide in constancy without faltering; root yourself deeply in the void. Constancy adapts to all, the void gives birth to all. Without moving, it reaches all; without effort, it brings forth life. Its reach is boundless, its generation all-encompassing. Pervasive yet not exhausted, all-encompassing yet never ceasing.

Its form is like clouds, its qi like flowing water. When the flow reaches its limit, it returns; when clouds sink low, they must rise. Returning, it holds being; rising, it holds emptiness.

I tell you, those yet to come: do not rely on your brightness. When brightness reaches its extreme, darkness follows; when darkness reaches its extreme, brightness returns. If you can constantly guard the dark, your body shall forever dwell in great peace. You shall repel the Three Disasters, dissolve the Five Weapons. The Ten Evils shall not approach, the Six Thieves shall not act. No battles shall arise at your borders, no alarms shall disturb your cities. A hundred harvests shall ripen, flowers and trees shall flourish. Wind and rain shall be harmonious, all things shall grow of their own accord.

I tell you, those yet to come: abandon emotion, forsake desire. Feast on the primordial, clothe yourself in the One. Embrace the Dao, hold fast to virtue. Gather good companions, drive away the yin thieves. Adorn yourself with majesty, restrain yourself with precepts. Indulgence in flavors harms the self; lustful cravings master the self. Your wishes shall not be fulfilled, your desires shall not be met.

Those who kill and steal to sustain themselves, who wield power and fortune with arrogance, who disregard the lowly, inflict harm, and mete out punishment—who curse heaven and revile earth, who rush about in distress—shall see their five spirits wage war within, their resentments bind without. Their yang qi shall leak and dissipate, their yin meridians shall meet with premature closure. Those who take the perverse as the Dao shall never reach its end.

Take heed, and do not treat these teachings lightly. Do not clothe the dead with my living scriptures. Do not harbor venomous intentions while holding my precious scriptures. Do not chant my true and orthodox teachings with perverse voices. Do not allow yin thieves into my Daoist sanctum. Do not entertain lustful thoughts while forcibly practicing my Dao. Do not seek the Way of wholeness with a corrupted body. Do not use a body steeped in the Ten Evils to destroy the Dao of the Ten Virtues."

Do not wield the sword of the Five Acts of Rebellion to sever your own five viscera. Do not cast evil eyes upon the virtuous. Do not enter my gate of stillness with a disordered mind. Do not seek my Six Penetrations with a body bound by the Six Obstructions. Do not gaze upon my soaring chariot with a body sunk in turbidity. Do not defile my Daoist sanctum with a body reeking of rot. Do not disrupt my Dharma with the heart of one who lusts after the mother and harms the father.

All good men who enter my Daoist sanctum—though but a single thought arise, though the mechanism has yet to be set in motion—already the tally of sins is established. How much more so when the body personally enacts them? Ten thousand blessings shall depart, a hundred calamities shall gather, the heavy sins of life and death shall be repaid without end.

Good men who practice my Dao: be vigilant in emptiness, do not deceive the Great Void, and take the Dao as your companion. Those who follow my precepts shall find the true Dao easy to seek; those who turn their backs on my precepts shall know endless sorrow in life and death. Can you not be cautious? Can you not be cautious?

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the immortals, saying: The rites of audience and reverence are not confined to the eight seasonal festivals alone. On the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month, on these days, cultivate the body and repent of transgressions. The Great Dao, carefree and all-seeing, shall witness as if present before you.

All who study the Dao—whether at the beginning, middle, or end—should maintain a mind of equanimity, seek blessings without surfeit, and cultivate the body without weariness. Good men and women who single-mindedly guard the One shall attain my Dao. Those who embrace emptiness and act with authenticity shall perfect my Dao. Those who practice compassion, forbearance, and unrelenting diligence shall fulfill my Dao. They shall be companions to divine beings and served by a multitude of spirits. If you do otherwise, you shall waste your life in vain. I speak to those yet to come: who among you will ponder my words?

At that time, the immortals, receiving the solemn decree of the Heavenly Worthy, rejoiced and bowed their heads in gratitude, their aspirations fulfilled. They dared not speak, fearing to profane the sacred, and silently prostrated themselves to receive the Heavenly Worthy’s luminous command.

Then the Heavenly Worthy again addressed the immortals, saying: The Jade Clarity Realm of the Dao is naturally unlearned, hence it is called "emptiness and spontaneity." The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning is not achieved through study. Out of great compassion, I bestow upon you the true Dao. Return to the lower realms and treasure it in practice. From this day forward, for ninety thousand great kalpas, the later sages of the Golden Towers shall descend to the Four Heavens and dwell in the divine continent. At that time, all the perfected ones of the upper realms, the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, and the upper immortals shall descend in accordance with the Dharma. At that moment, you shall naturally behold me. When these matters are concluded, you may return once more to the lower realms. Those who later attain the Dao and govern shall not remain here but may temporarily journey there to seek the Dharma and resolve doubts.

At that time, the immortals, receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, each burned incense, bowed their heads, and took leave of the soaring chariot of the upper realms to return to the lower heavens. At that time, the immortals, having sought the Dharma before and after, traversed thirty-six thousand celestial gates and paid homage to thirty-six thousand secret Dharma teachings. Though their rank was that of lower immortals, their conduct equaled that of the highest perfected. With minds and eyes clear, they comprehended the three times without omission. Through this cause and condition, they obtained the true essential teachings of the Heavenly Worthy. Through cultivation, they swiftly attained enlightenment and penetrated the future.

Good men and women who love the Dao but do not encounter a wise teacher often harbor doubts and lack steadfastness. As the years pass, the body decays, skin and flesh wither, marrow and brain are exhausted. Though they possess ears and eyes, in truth they are deaf and blind. Further bound by attachments, clinging to their dens of greed, entangled in myriad conditions, they cannot let go. Like birds tethered by a cord, their thoughts are spent in vain, ever craving sustenance and possessions, insatiable in their desires. A hundred illnesses arise, with no means of cure, gradually worsening. In but a moment, the hour of death approaches. Though they ransom their lives with all their wealth, they shall never attain the Dharma. At the final moment, they shall regret not having practiced goodness. What use are the last gasps of breath? What can they do then?

Good men and women, I ever pity all sentient beings. Though they know food, they rarely distinguish the five flavors. Though they know how to sustain life, they seldom nurture the Dao. They die for profit and harm, are ruined by sound and beauty. They gallop in reckless abandon, exhausted and distressed.

Resentment and hatred breed strife, turning kin into sworn foes. When smoke scatters and embers fade, and life’s breath is spent, vengeful spirits and sinful ghosts swarm in ceaseless litigation, their retributions unending. They are reborn among mortals, perpetuating wicked deeds, thus falling into such plight. Disregarding the Dao’s precepts, they scorn the law of karma, mock the most sacred, slander the virtuous, slaughter the innocent, steal and plunder, bully the aged and infirm, exploit the orphaned and weak. Relying on their power, they mete out punishments at will. Even before their qi is exhausted, they already endure the torments of the unseen realm—every deed, whether weighty or trifling, is recorded without omission.

I exhort those yet to come: dwell in tranquil reverence upon the sacred scriptures, diligently cultivate the precepts, and let no transgression mar your practice. The profound mirror of the Great Dao aligns the hidden and the manifest; when peril nears, safety is found—thus is the power of the numinous first revealed.

At that moment, the Immortal once more descended to the Western Numinous Treasure Palace in the Lower Heavens, his divine radiance shining afar, a thousand myriad times brighter than before. The Three Heavens’ immortals came to greet him, marveling at this rare sight, their eyes never having beheld the like. They discerned at once the disparity—how virtue and the Dao differed—and each bowed in reverence, longing to hear the essential teachings.

Then the Western Numinous Supreme Immortal addressed the assembled immortals: “Though the Dao has no intent, it may be sought through devotion. Defiance breeds discord, while compliance with goodness flows as naturally as a river. I have traversed the heavens without bound, and through the compassion of the True Emperor, who pitied my earnest seeking, I was granted the supreme essence. He charged me to refine my practice and, in turn, proclaim the precepts and dignified rites to future generations. Moreover, after ninety thousand great kalpas, the Golden Portal Emperor shall descend to the divine continent, accompanied by the celestial lords of the Upper Heavens. The Dao’s great deliverance shall prevail—what cause have you for sorrow?”

At that time, eighty myriad billion great immortals of the Yu-Yu Heaven, hearing that the Western Numinous Supreme Immortal had descended to the Western Numinous Treasure Palace in the Three Heavens, gathered with the multitudes to pay their respects. They burned incense, scattered flowers, and played celestial music, pacing the void in solemn procession as they encircled the Supreme Immortal. Bowing deeply, they inquired after his well-being: “Your journey through the ten thousand heavens in pursuit of the Dao must have been arduous. Your divine radiance now shines a hundred millionfold brighter than before. Since the Great Dao has flourished, it shall universally benefit all conditions.”

The assembled immortals prostrated themselves, entreating the Transcendent Sage with compassion and pity to disseminate the transformative teachings of the Dao and reveal what had not yet been heard.

The Supreme Immortal replied: “I have received the supreme precepts from the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity Heaven in the Upper Mystery, and their regulations are strict and clear. The esoteric essentials of the Great Dao must not be rashly proclaimed. If you but hold sincerity in your heart, you must refine your thoughts with utmost diligence. After ninety thousand kalpas, the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal shall descend to the Divine Continent. At that time, all the great sages of the heavens shall arrive together, and the vast deliverance of the Dao’s teachings shall universally succor gods and humans. For billions of kalpas, they shall admonish and instruct all future generations. At that time, you shall journey with me.”

Just then, among the assembly there was a lesser immortal named Rongzhen, who had attained the Dao only six years prior. Not yet comprehending the three temporal realms, he remained in the stage of study. His heart doubted the vastness of ninety thousand kalpas, and he further questioned whether a lesser immortal’s lifespan could endure until that time. He stepped forward to bow but had not yet spoken when the Supreme Immortal, already perceiving his thoughts, addressed him: “Good man, I know your heart harbors doubts about the kalpas and the lifespan of immortals. Good man, you must now understand: when mortals of the lower realms cultivate and attain the Dao, they are called ‘later sages.’ Once they enter the immortal rank, they never regress. I was born in the Western Numinous Treasure Palace, and though it seems but yesterday, already ninety trillion great kalpas have passed. To the eyes of the upper sages, this appears but the blink of an eye; ninety thousand kalpas are but a moment.

You have attained the Dao and become an immortal only six years ago, still like an infant seeking milk, lacking other wisdom, and thus doubting the kalpas and lifespan. Pitying your childlike ignorance of the supreme Dao, your dim and shallow understanding, you lightly voice such narrow views. Good man, the primordial source of the supreme Great Dao is profoundly pure, fathomless and immeasurable, the Great Mystery and Great Void, boundless and beginningless, naturally and utterly real. The later sages are likewise—unaware that in the dust-laden, foul, and perverse customs of the lower realms, those who cultivate heterodox methods may live for eighty thousand kalpas before regressing and falling. This is the way of demonic and worldly heterodoxy, which does not transcend the Three Realms, attain the Six Penetrations, comprehend the three temporal realms, or escape birth and death. With trivial and minor skills, they style themselves ‘great immortals.’

It is like the worldly term ‘vajra’—when the foolish hear it, they assume such a person is indestructible and mighty, their body imperishable. But the wise understand that this is not true indestructibility; ‘vajra’ is but a borrowed name, and in a moment, it shall perish. So too with heterodoxy: they usurp the title of ‘immortal’ to adorn their walking corpses. Just as worldly fools falsely claim the name of ‘heavenly beings,’ or as those in the dust-laden, perverse customs of the lower realms call themselves ‘great immortals.’ The wise clearly know that orthodoxy and heterodoxy are opposites, their lifespans and fates utterly distinct—eighty thousand kalpas are to them but a moment, like the fleeting life of lightning or mushrooms.

In the dust-laden lower realms, many falsely claim the name of ‘immortal.’ When they hear that immortals within the supreme Dao endure forever without perishing, yet their eyes and ears have never witnessed this, they assume the true Dao is no different from those demonic and perverse teachings. Through written records and transmitted accounts, they confuse and mislead the walking corpses. The weak and deluded, hearing such things, incline toward perversity. Deceiving themselves with illusory blessings, they invite retribution and punishment, drifting for billions of kalpas, turning their backs on the Dao in the cycle of birth and death. Practicing heterodox methods, they cry out for annihilation, amassing like ants and swarming like flies, performing all manner of ascetic practices, yet unable to attain the Dao—all because they have lost the true path and resorted to perversity.

They loathe and despise their bodies as if they were spittle, hastening to seek their own destruction, unaware that this body is the Dharma-body. In restless pursuit of external things, they abandon the inner Dharma, extensively practicing heterodox texts, slandering the Great Dao, forsaking the root to chase the branches. Such perversity arises from the borderlands and barbarian regions, and does not exist in the Divine Continent. How then, good man, do you harbor such perverse thoughts within the true Dao?

Good man, those who cultivate the inner Dharma and attain the Dao—regardless of whether they are early or late, high or low in rank—once they reach the immortal rank, endure forever, free and unobstructed. This is unlike the heterodox methods of the lower realms, where covering the body in ashes is deemed attainment of the Dao, and decay is taken as proof of fruition. These are the ways of heterodoxy, bound within birth and death, lacking freedom. They conceal their perversity and deceit to avoid worldly censure, hiding their cunning and treachery, gathering the young and ignorant, feigning marvels and wonders to mislead all, diligently seeking worldly trust, coveting wealth and sensual pleasures, their conduct deviating from the proper path, their clothing and food unjustly acquired. They nourish hidden malevolence, constantly scheming to harm others, sustaining their walking corpses, harboring the Three Poisons, corrupting good roots, killing to seek life, lacking merit to redress transgressions.

Some disobey their masters, secretly consuming potent medicines, stealing minor methods to slightly benefit themselves, then claiming to have reached the ultimate Dao. This is called ‘departing in darkness and arriving by night,’ allowing ignorance to grow. The heterodox and worldly who usurp the name of ‘immortal’ do not practice the Dao of pure and unwavering unity, nor the Dao of natural emptiness and non-being, nor the Dao of the Compassionate Worthy’s forbearance, nor the Dao of the Six Perfections and Six Penetrations, nor the primordial and supreme Great Dao, nor the Dao of unobstructed liberation, nor the Dao of eternal life and deathlessness.

Good man, if you hear of any miscellaneous methods that diverge from the Great Dao, know that these are heterodox methods, from which one cannot escape old age, sickness, death, hunger, cold, and suffering. Good man, do not harbor doubts about the Great Dao. Who is your master? What methods have you cultivated? Your aspirations are narrow and weak, utterly lacking the qi of the Dao. How can you transform the world, verify the blessings of others, and deliver beings from birth and death?

Good man, though you have attained non-regression and the freedom to fly, you are not yet equal to the great sages who are without self. You must continue your cultivation and not be complacent. When the measure of the Dao is fulfilled, your body and mind shall attain great penetration, and the affairs of the three temporal realms shall be as clear as your own palm. Ninety thousand kalpas shall not even amount to a single instant, for in my Great Dao, a hundred billion great kalpas as numerous as the dust motes of a hundred million lands are but a single breath.”

How could there be any doubt?

At that moment, the immortal Rongzhen bowed his head in reverence and offered his thanks: "This humble one is benighted, having defiled the celestial court with dust. Yet by past blessings, I have been fortunate to encounter the Perfected Ones of Heaven. Gazing down upon the six directions, I grieved with earnest sincerity and was granted the *Lingfu* of Hidden Life. Through its cultivation, I preserved my destiny and have witnessed this day—though the supreme Daoist methods remain beyond my comprehension. I humbly beseech your compassion for my ignorance and bestow upon me what I have never heard."

The Perfected One replied: "I recognize your heart, know your master, and see your cultivation. I now tell you all at once—this cannot be otherwise. In but a moment, the immortals of the thirty-seven heavens below, numbering in the billions, all assembled on the twentieth day of the tenth month to celebrate the *Lidong* festival, paying homage to the Western Numinous Perfected. Each burned incense of renown, ascending to the heavens to reverently bow from afar before the Great Emperor of the Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy. The Three Bureaus recorded their merits, and the Water Palace reported above. The thirty-seven heavens each arrayed their celestial rites, setting forth offerings to remotely present to the Supreme Lord of the Boundless Dao. For three days and nights, they circled the void in step, while the earthly realms resounded with music to delight the immortal perfected. The Five Demons chanted long, wishing all transformations to return to the Mysterious. Liezi tuned the winds, and Yunjiang gathered the mists. Heavenly blossoms swirled in the air, and fragrant vapors dispersed into the void. Attendant immortal youths chanted the sacred scriptures.

In but a moment, the Eight Qi warmed and softened, radiant clouds soared, the celestial court brightened, and the Mysterious Path opened in the heavens. Beholding the boundless vastness of the Great Void, they saw the Primordial Harmony spread wide. The Three-in-One Venerable Spirits and the Lords of the Myriad Qi—serene as abyssal depths, drifting like clouds—held no distinction between provisional and real, now merging, now parting.

Then, all at once, they abided at the center, their forms merging into the formless. Ascending to the immortal abodes, they wandered below in the Golden City, rinsing with jade nectar, inhaling purple clouds, exhaling luminous vapors. Their forms renewed with each day, and the dust-mote kalpas returned to infancy. Neither departing nor arriving, neither perishing nor arising, they dwelled in the subtle and indistinct, beyond all names. The Mysterious Dao is without intent, yet meets all who can practice. In that exalted state, the dust-mote kalpas abide in eternal peace. To turn from the Dao and oppose Heaven—I have never heard of such a thing."

At that moment, the Great Constant Void Sovereign Heavenly Worthy emitted a radiant light from afar, illuminating the ten thousand heavens. It warmed and nourished the hidden and the manifest, bathing the gloomy and the joyful, moistening the parched, washing away filth and defilement. It unsealed the deaf and blind, mended all insufficiencies, nurtured life and healed illness, subdued the myriad demons, dissolved calamitous qi, and bestowed blessings upon all worlds in the ten directions. Birth and death opened to prosperity, and gods and humans rejoiced. At this time, the majesty was beyond thought. In the span of a finger-snap, blessings and wisdom pervaded all. The awe-inspiring power of the Great Dao is inconceivable, immeasurable, and inexpressible.

At that moment, the great assembly fixed their minds in devotion, each wishing their Daoist practice to be universally perfected so they might ascend into the Great Void and personally attend the Heavenly Worthy. They wished the Mysterious Gate to open wide, delivering boundless beings; the Five Sufferings to cease, and the souls of the Three Wretched Realms to be pardoned; all beings in borderlands to practice the Dao; chronic and stubborn illnesses to be wholly cured; and all sentient and insentient beings to avoid premature death.

As the great assembly made these seven vows, the Seven Awakening Ways became complete, and the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords rejoiced in praise. Then, seven-colored auspicious clouds descended and enveloped the assembly. Seven-colored fragrant lights illuminated the Great Mystery, and sevenfold celestial music harmonized the Seven Spirits. The Seven Perfected Ones of the Void took form with the qi.

When the assembly of immortals had completed their homage, the sounds of light and music stilled. On the morning of the twenty-fourth day, they bowed from afar to the upper realms, took leave of the Perfected Emperor, and descended through the void.

At that time, the Western Numinous Perfected Immortal entered the Great Samādhi of Concentrated Spirit. His body and mind remained unmoving, his true light serene as the hanging moon. For nine great kalpas, he remained fixed without blinking.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Precepts of Fasting and Abstinence**

At that time, in the world of Abandoned Worthiness, the household of the Huang clan had long cultivated the Ten Virtues. Free from unjust punishments or harm, they constantly observed fasting and abstinence, establishing offerings in tranquility. On the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, they burned incense and bowed to the Void. On the ten auspicious days, they paid homage and repented of transgressions. Their devotion to the Great Dao was sincere, without flattery or desire. Their household was abundant in wealth and resources, with many servants. They often gave alms at crossroads, aiding the destitute and sheltering travelers, bestowing vast charity. Each winter, when frost accumulated in the wilds, they showed kindness to birds and beasts, pitying the poor, sick, elderly, young, orphaned, and weak, providing for their needs so nothing was lacking. In hosting fasting lectures and assemblies, their hearts never wearied.

The elder had a wife, née Feng, who one day at noon fell asleep at home. In her dream, she saw a bright pearl descend from the heavens into her bosom. Then, sunlight shone upon her body. Awakening from her nap, she realized she had conceived. From that time onward, her heart was joyful, her complexion radiant, her steps light, and her strength doubled. After ten months, on the eighth day of the fourth month, she ascended a terrace to enjoy the view. Suddenly, at noon, she saw a purple cloud hovering a hundred *zhang* above the earth, moving southeast. From within the purple cloud, she heard a voice say: "Immortal child, why do you not come forth?" The lady looked up and heard celestial music within the purple cloud. In an instant, fragrant light filled the terrace, perfuming her nostrils, and her heart felt at ease. Then, she felt an infant emerge from beneath her left armpit. Knowing this was no ordinary child, she instructed her maid to inform the elder.

In the blink of an eye, the Dragon King spat water to bathe the infant, and heavenly flowers rained down to serve as a mat. When the elder arrived and saw the child’s divine signs, he raised the boy on the terrace, naming him Immortal Child. A purple cloud constantly hovered above his head, his breath was fragrant, and his hair and complexion were purple. By the age of three, his nails were red as cowrie shells, his teeth like beads, his eyes bore double pupils, his arms hung past his knees, and his voice rang like a bell.

With the gaze of a tiger and the stride of a dragon, his movements were like a soaring phoenix—wherever he trod, no trace remained, and from his crown emanated a radiance of purple light.

By the age of five, he could recite ten thousand words in a day. Of all the classics, he grasped their depths entirely. His bearing was measured, his demeanor dignified. His eloquence flowed like a suspended river, his virtue akin to a dragon’s. His mystical insight reached its utmost, unmatched in the world. He honored and served his parents, often reciting the true scriptures at their knees, plumbing their profound meanings. He understood the principles of earth below, and there was no art he did not master.

At seven, wherever he wandered, he followed proper ways. His words revealed hidden truths, and his voice carried to distant lands. His virtue shone beyond the world, his fame reached the Heavenly Kings. Though offered the position of state preceptor, he declined the summons, devoting himself instead to filial piety. He attended his parents as though revering heaven, gazing upon their faces, ensuring warmth in winter and coolness in summer—never once failing in the slightest. Whenever he received fine food, he would not taste it first but always offered the freshest portions to his parents.

As his parents grew old, surpassing a hundred years, infirmity and illness assailed them. For three years, the Immortal Child tended to them day and night, enduring hardship. Moved by his sincere devotion, the heavens took pity, and the gods of the various heavens descended to his home. Earth Treasury emerged from the valley to provide sustenance. The Great Medicine True King transformed his appearance to that of an ordinary man and descended to heal their ailments, restoring them to health. They lived to the age of one hundred and thirty before passing away in their hall.

Though possessed of wisdom, he lacked steadfast cultivation and could not attain the true Dao in this lifetime. At that time, the Immortal Child cried out in grief, his sobs choking him until he fainted, reviving only to collapse again. His entire body was wracked with sorrow, tears mingling with blood, his lament shaking heaven and earth. Birds fell from the sky, beasts ceased nursing their young, bitter mists gathered, and desolate dew congealed. Earth spirits sounded their drums, and mountains echoed his sorrow. The king, upon hearing of this, sent silks as funeral offerings, while people from near and far, their faces gaunt with grief, rushed to his side. Birds carried soil in their beaks to build his parents’ tomb.

For three years, the Immortal Child prostrated himself at the burial mound, planting fine trees that spread their shade across the wilds. Birds gathered there, crying out mournfully morning and evening. After three years, he returned home, using his parents’ estate to fund meritorious deeds. He converted their residence into a Daoist sanctuary, lighting fragrant oil lamps and offering banners and flowers in worship. He swept the grounds himself, practicing the Ten Good Deeds his parents had observed in life, holding fasts and lectures, and aiding the poor and destitute.

Often in his dreams, he saw his parents, who said to him: *"In our lifetime, though we practiced the Ten Good Deeds and relieved the suffering of the poor, we lacked proper cultivation. Our lives were not firmly rooted, and we now cycle through rebirth, born into wealth and nobility. Yet by virtue of our past good deeds, we are not bound in confinement. Though we face no karmic retribution, we still bear the residual burdens of nine generations of ancestors, lingering in the Great Yin, unable to cross the Southern Palace. The fasts and offerings you have made on our behalf, though sincere, have not yet established a connection. You must perform a proper fast to deliver us and our nine generations of ancestors."*

Awakening from the dream, the Immortal Child sighed deeply, his thoughts turning to his parents, his sorrow redoubling. The next morning, he burned incense, kowtowed, and prayed, recounting the dream’s words to the Great Dao.

Then, the Jade Pure Heavenly Worthy, sensing his devotion from afar, commanded the Perfected One of Fixed Radiance, along with fourteen attendants, to descend to the southern slope of the Five Terraces. There, they manifested as the Cold-Dwelling Master, appearing in the world to respond to fasts and rescue those in peril.

Hearing that the Cold-Dwelling Master resided on the Five Terraces, the Immortal Child knew him to be a true immortal and sage. He prostrated himself and went to invite him, returning home to make offerings in his honor.

When the Immortal Child reached the southern slope of the Five Terraces, clouds and mist gathered, grasses and trees loomed dense, and fierce beasts blocked the path, preventing his advance. Leaning against a cliff, he sighed and addressed the beasts: *"I am a child of the Huang clan from the World of Abandoned Worthies. My family has long practiced the Ten Good Deeds and believed in the Great Dao, never harming living beings. I bear no grudge against you. I grieve for my parents, who have departed this world, and wish to perform meritorious deeds in their memory. There are no true masters in the world, but I have heard that a Cold-Dwelling Immortal dwells in these mountains, deeply versed in the highest principles and skilled in fasts and precepts. I have come from afar to invite him to my home for offerings. I beg you to clear the path so I may pass."*

Hearing the Immortal Child’s words, the beasts bared their fangs, unsheathed their claws, glared fiercely, licked their lips, and roared, their ferocity intensifying. The Immortal Child pondered for a long while, then thought to himself: *"I have lived without awareness of any transgression. Yet if I press forward, these beasts may devour me. If I abandon my filial resolve and fail to complete this meritorious deed, it would be unfilial. But if I do not force my way through, I will not meet the great master—this, too, would be unfilial."* Wiping his tears, he said: *"May the Great Dao have spirit and grant me distant aid. May the gods of heaven and earth take pity on me. Let the beasts open the path so I may see the great master, fulfill my meritorious deed, and realize my filial heart."*

After weeping for a long time, he suddenly heard a voice from within the clouds and mist: *"Good man, you have come for this purpose, but there is another reason as well."* The Immortal Child replied: *"I dare not seek other reasons—I have traveled through these famous mountains only for this."* The earth spirit, moved by his devotion, then addressed him: *"Your parents, in their lifetime, extended kindness even to insects. Heaven above and earth below praised them without cease. You have come for a great purpose, seeking a true master. I dare not obstruct you, but the great master has only recently descended here. We mountain spirits have not yet had our fill of gazing upon him, nor have we made offerings. For this reason, the beasts have blocked the path. You are a child of the Ten Good Deeds, supported by a hundred blessings. Though I am but a mountain spirit, I wish to hear the Dharma alongside you, a good child."*

The Immortal Child replied: *"A good guide need not be of one kind. The hidden and the manifest converge, humans and spirits are not divided. Inner and outer support one another—only then can good deeds be accomplished."*

The mountain spirit withdrew the ferocious beasts, then revealed its true form and conversed with the Immortal Child. After speaking, it led the way, and the Immortal Child followed, with the fierce beasts escorting them on either side. Ascending halfway up the mountain, they saw the Great Master of Cold Abode dwelling beneath a sheer cliff. His abode was of jade, his couch of gold, with dragons and tigers arrayed in attendance, divine beings and humans standing by. Purple clouds congealed above as a canopy, crystal trays bore incense burners, golden perfected ones held ritual tablets, and jade lads burned incense.

At that moment, the Immortal Child prostrated and rose, bowing deeply to say: *"This disciple was born under misfortune, spared not by calamity, my heart devoid of filial devotion, as heaven claimed both my parents. Above and below, I have no refuge—only the true Dao to rely upon. Entangled in worldly bonds and manifold burdens, the causes of birth and death torment my heart like poison, the pain beyond words. I wish to prepare a fast and invite you, Master, to sever the roots of my sins. I have heard of your compassion in responding to karmic conditions. Dare I humbly request your presence to witness this field of merit?"* Having spoken, he kowtowed, hoping to hear a reply.

The Perfected One declared: *"Your parents in life constantly cultivated the Ten Good Deeds, aiding the destitute and saving even insects. Their fame resounded in the heavens, their merit reached the imperial court. The Heavenly Worthy commanded me to descend. I am a Perfected One from the Cloud Palace, serving the Heavenly Worthy. For this reason, I have descended to this mountain. You are a divine child, born into the gate of the Ten Good Deeds, manifesting filial devotion as a model for the world. Though temporarily dwelling in a mortal womb, you will soon ascend as an immortal. When I once called you, it was my own self—briefly journeying to the lower world, sometimes riding the flowing clouds."*

Hearing the Perfected One’s words, the Immortal Child suddenly awakened, joy and sorrow mingling within. The Perfected One continued: *"If you wish to establish merit and hold a fast, do not proceed lightly. First return home and prepare a pure and solemn Daoist sanctuary."*

The Immortal Child bowed deeply, kowtowing to ask: *"I do not yet know the ritual forms for heavenly fasts, nor the requisite adornments for establishing a sanctuary. Pray, instruct me in their details."*

The Perfected One replied: *"The ritual forms for heavenly fasts differ from those below; the methods of the lower realm cannot compare. Immortal Child, first instruct your servants and laborers—those who perform tasks—to purify themselves of grime and grease, bathing in the five fragrances. Men and women should dwell separately, their impure breaths not intermingling. Scented mud should coat the ground, beds and seats thoroughly cleansed, all utensils and vessels for washing and drinking rinsed with fragrant water. The kitchen must be spotless, no worm-eaten firewood burned. Soap beans and floral water should be placed everywhere upon the yellow altar, fresh earth added and smoothed over. Ensure all is meticulous: vermilion pillars immaculate, lamps and candles radiant, every task executed with utmost care. Do not haggle over prices for market goods. Do not use impure wealth to fund the fast and precepts—such as ill-gotten gains or unjust acquisitions. Those lacking compassion should not enter the sanctuary or approach the fast’s kitchen. Guard these matters carefully for seven days before and after. Though the fast’s day concludes, maintain an equanimous mind, avoiding untimely or reckless eating—how much less should one tread in filth, drink wine, eat meat, indulge in wayward thoughts, or harbor unequal intentions. If, while seated in the sanctuary, one’s mind mingles with worldly defilements, such a fast will not offset transgressions. The incense smoke will be wasted, the Celestial Court will not hear, sins will remain unresolved, the sinful soul unliberated, a hundred blessings will not assist, calamities will not vanish, the true Dao will not descend, and demonic forces will respond instead."*

At that time, the mountain spirit and the host of Five Peaks deities stood attending the Perfected One. Hearing the Immortal Child’s intent to invite the Perfected One to his home to witness the field of merit, they all wished to follow the Heavenly Worthy on his journey to the human realm. Then the spirit of Mount Wutai stepped forward, bowed, and addressed the Perfected One: *"In this world, only the Immortal Child’s household, devoted to the Ten Good Deeds and harboring no enmity toward any being, is beloved by all—humans and spirits alike—who wish to aid in accomplishing his good deeds."*

The Perfected One assented. Hearing the mountain spirit’s words, the Immortal Child then asked the assembled deities: *"The supreme Great Dao is venerated in villages and hamlets. What offerings do the divine spirits require for the fast?"*

The mountain spirit replied: *"When the Great Dao descends to the world, the Five Emperors, great demons, and earth deities all attend in service, following its majestic power. They require nothing. We only wish to be your good guides, guarding and protecting the sanctuary. Should heretics, evil persons, or those with malicious intent disrupt or disturb good people—slandering, envying, flattering, or deceiving—we shall destroy them, causing their tongues to wither and retract, their bodies to erupt in leprous sores, their faces to break out in boils, their eyebrows and hair to fall out. Such external and internal retributions are called ‘Dharma protection.’ We have always aided the Dao, promoting and illuminating the true teaching—this is not merely for today."*

Hearing these words, the Immortal Child rejoiced and returned home, instructing his household to follow the Perfected One’s golden decree precisely. When his kinsfolk heard of his return, they hastened to inquire. The Immortal Child recounted all that had transpired. Hearing this, though their bodies sat still, their thoughts soared afar, pondering deeply day and night without sleep. All longed for the true Dao to descend upon their homes and sought the Immortal Child’s guidance. Then the divine instructions were revealed, and each person copied and transmitted them, teaching their households and instructing their relatives, all adhering to the precepts. Each purified their home according to their means, wholeheartedly making offerings, their thoughts reaching far as if the Perfected One stood before them.

The Immortal Child then prepared and adorned the altar sanctuary, completing every task. He returned to the mountain to welcome the Perfected One, and all wished to accompany him. At that time, one thousand two hundred people—including the Elders of Sun-and-Moon Love, Vast Heart, Great Authority, Virtue King, Life’s End, and Heart Ocean, who led the assembly—each bearing incense and flowers, followed the Immortal Child toward Mount Wutai. After twelve days, they arrived at the mountain gate, where all burned incense and bowed from afar to the mountain spirit.

In the space of a meal’s time, gazing upward toward the mountain, they beheld lions, tigers, and wolves flanking the path, while coiling dragons entwined threefold around the Perfected Lord. Earth spirits played music, immortal ministers burned incense, and the Immortal Child prostrated himself, inquiring after the Dao Lord, expressing gratitude above for his cloud-borne descent to this empty mountain, and lamenting below that the beings of the lower realms had nothing worthy to offer.

Again he bowed twice. At that moment, the six great Elders, beholding the true majesty of the Perfected One, all lost themselves in awe, their limbs trembling, joy and fear intermingling. They prostrated without pause, sweat streaming like water, gazing upon his golden countenance until words failed them. Overcome with reverence and dread, they stood unsteadily, unable to remain still.

Then the mountain spirit spoke: "Noble Immortal Child, you have returned once more. But who are these six elders? Do they possess roots of goodness from past cultivation, or have they only now turned toward the Way? I fear their hearts lack constancy, their resolve is not truly firm—what brings them here? Moreover, their minds have not yet merged with the true, their bodies remain impure and worldly. They defile my sacred precincts; their mortal stench is unfit to meet the Perfected Lord. Though I am but the spirit of this renowned mountain, my form is free of impurity, my shape fixed. Though I cannot embody the Dao, I have always served as an outer guardian to the Perfected Lord, and I do not wish for the foul and base to offend the true."

The Immortal Child replied: "These six elders are my kin in the Dharma. Hearing of my invitation to the Dao, their hearts rejoiced in support. Though they may not practice the Ten Virtues perfectly, they bear no grave transgressions. Though they dwell in the world, their hearts are good."

Hearing of the true Dao yet never having beheld it with their own eyes, their distant longing and yearning thoughts are truly pitiable. Upon hearing the Immortal Child’s words, the mountain spirit addressed the elders once more: "If what the Immortal Child says is true, compose yourselves and steady your hearts—there is no need for fear. Contemplate the orthodox Dharma and cultivate in accordance with its teachings."

Then the elders bowed and withdrew.

*Thus concludes Scroll Five of the Supreme Great Dao Jade Clarity Scripture*

*Scroll Six of the Supreme Great Dao Jade Clarity Scripture*
*Chapter Fifteen: The Luminous Numinous*

At that time, in the Southern Prosperity Palace, there was an upper immortal named Luminous Numinous, accompanied by fifteen thousand attendants—all of whom had first received deliverance in their mortal forms at the Assembly of Dragons, cultivated the Dao to attain sagehood, and possessed the power of compassion. Their bodies had achieved the six penetrations, allowing them to roam without obstruction, and their lifespans were fixed, like refined true gold, immutable and unchanging. They ascended in sovereign freedom, their wisdom vast and immeasurable, their bodies and minds unbound, like empty space itself.

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, they ascended to the Great Empyrean, entering the Jade Clarity Heaven to pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy in the Cloud Palace. Prostrating before the Dao, they inquired after his well-being and spoke thus:

"Though I am but dust, defiled and base, I have presumptuously undertaken the task of salvation. In the past, I was undeservingly favored by the great Dao’s compassion, lifted and granted longevity, and bestowed with the supreme Dharma. From that time onward, I have cultivated in accordance with the precepts, and my hopes have borne fruit. By right, I should attend upon the Heavenly Worthy morning and night, ever ready to serve. Yet I remain bound to the foul, decaying forms of the mortal realm below, and the path to heaven is long and distant, beyond the reach of ordinary beings—thus I have failed in my duty to attend you. Each day, I yearn for the azure clouds above and revere the purple gates of your compassion, but my person is humble and my Dao shallow, leaving my heart’s desire unfulfilled. This sorrow has lingered through kalpas, and my longing remains unassuaged. Unable to bear the sincerity of my devotion, I have ventured through clouds and mist to brave your august presence, that I might behold your sacred countenance and offer my reverent homage."

With these words, he prostrated himself again, overcome with joy.

The Heavenly Worthy, desiring to respond, addressed the immortal, saying: "The Dao of generation and transformation accords with spontaneity by principle. I have never deliberately bestowed anything, nor do I stir beings with emotion—how then could I have given birth to you? Good man, just as when a person loves extinction, the Dao has no mind to oppose their inclination and give them life; so too, when your heart cherishes life, the Dao has no mind to defy your inclination and diminish you. If one follows the inclinations of the myriad beings to their utmost, fulfilling their aspirations for ascent or descent, then in the meeting of circumstances, all is spontaneously accomplished. The Dao abides at the ultimate mystery, thus it can flow with things like water—whether in generation or extinction, the Dao cannot oppose it. If something is born yet does not perish, my Dao, though without mind, can diminish it; if something perishes yet does not arise, the Dao, though without mind, can give it life. That you have obtained life now is due to your own karmic power of aspiration—the Dao, without mind, gives life to you. Hearts turn toward or away, each upholding its own resolve; though the power of the Dao exists, it cannot precede them. When you first aspired to study the Dao, it arose from your own heart—self-cause, self-effect—it is not something I know. This is what is called the spontaneous Dao, the mind of spontaneity in its obscurity."

At that moment, the assembled immortals, hearing the words of the Heavenly Worthy, dared not offer any reply.

The Heavenly Worthy continued: "The path to heaven is long and distant—why have you come here?"

The immortal answered: "I came to offer my gratitude and to behold the subtle and wondrous supreme Dharma."

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "The supreme Dao blends and transforms all, indistinguishable as grains of dust, like an embryo yet undifferentiated, akin to primordial chaos without origin. It discards wisdom and abandons knowledge, neither obscure nor manifest, boundless as the cosmic waters—how then could there be anything wondrous for you to behold? The supreme Dao, whether in transformation, arising, ceasing, receiving, upholding, dwelling, raising, or revealing—when shown to the multitude, it becomes a matter of doubt. There is no such thing. The supreme Dao is also without subtlety or wonder—profoundly empty and still, self-awakening and awakening others, without mind to observe or discriminate. This and that—how could there be anything wondrous for you to behold? Without form or appearance, it is like empty space, without inside or outside.

"Good man, if you wish to behold it, go to the northeast of the Cloud Palace, a distance of as many miles as there are motes of dust in a great land. Within the Great Void, three supreme perfected beings are cultivating the supreme Dao there in the emptiness. Now they have entered the Great Samādhi of Congealing Spirit, which has already endured for nine hundred million great kalpas. Next, they will enter the Great Samādhi of Forgetting Form for eight hundred million great kalpas, then the Great Samādhi of the Six Voids for seven hundred million great kalpas, then the Great Samādhi of Unobstructedness for six hundred million great kalpas, then the Great Samādhi of the Great Void for five hundred million great kalpas. Afterward, they will enter the Samādhi of Penetrating Wisdom for one million great kalpas, then the Samādhi of Generative Wisdom for one hundred thousand great kalpas. In the future, they will descend to observe the thirty-seven heavens, then wander through the realms of mortals. Together, they will be called the Later Sage Heavenly Worthy of Great Peace. Leading their retinue of billions upon billions of followers, they will expound the Dharma of Non-Action to deliver sentient beings. At that time, the number of those who attain the Dao will be as countless as motes of dust. If you wish to behold it, behold the subtle and wondrous Dharma of this Heavenly Worthy."

Then, the immortal, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s instruction, bowed in joy and reverence, taking leave of the Heavenly Worthy. At that time, the assembled immortals together mounted auspicious clouds and drifted away through the sky. In an instant, they arrived at the Great Void and saw from afar the three perfected beings in the midst of emptiness—subtly veiled in the vast obscurity, resting within the purple clouds, faintly shimmering above the radiant rosy dawn. The cinnabar heavens wove their patterns, yellow essence formed their couch; the three qi congealed into nectar, the two luminaries held their brilliance. The Great Void served as their window, the empty realm as their casement. Before the beginning of the embryo, at the primordial origin of chaos, they absorbed qi and concealed their true nature, silent and remote, utterly devoid of form. The ten thousand transformations had not yet taken root; their spirit-bodies were empty and serene. The five flowers secretly bloomed, the three palaces nurtured the true; the six viscera congealed spirit, the three hun souls did not float, the seven po souls did not wander. Spirit and essence remained unmoved, true qi did not flow. Serene and limpid, they abided without seeking anything.

At that moment, the immortals, beholding this subtlety and wonder, descended from their auspicious clouds. Treading lightly upon the mist, they drifted through the void and approached, prostrating themselves and drinking in the qi, not daring to speak. Kneeling in the profound emptiness, they lost track of kalpas. Fixing their minds on observing the wondrous, they forgot their own bodies. In an instant, the three perfected beings vanished—the radiant canopy revealed nothing of their whereabouts. After a long while, the empty canopy suddenly disappeared, leaving only the luminous qi, faintly aglow. After another long while, the three perfected beings suddenly emerged from the void into the formless, now present, now absent, their breath stirring wind and clouds, now merging, now parting. After a long while, they vanished utterly, their forms and qi completely gone. After yet another long while, the numinous wind shook the eight directions, the divine qi surged in the four quarters, blowing and fanning, now manifest, now hidden. After another long while, they arose without movement, accomplished without effort. The three dawns spread their clarity, the ten thousand transformations secretly sprouted. The roots of numinous potency were planted in the purple essence, the spirit-souls dispersed into the cloud chambers. They stirred the dust of emptiness in the formless, flowed primordial harmony into the vast azure, exhaled the myriad qi into the thriving growth, spread true essence into the ten thousand sprouts. They extended their divine feet into the numinous net, firmly grasped the original infant. Emerging from the Six Voids yet without accomplishment, they became the window through which the multitude of beings peered. Neither sinking nor floating, they abided in emptiness; neither moving nor still, they traversed transformation. Form without form, life without life. Dwelling in darkness yet luminous, dwelling in obscurity yet bright. Turning inward to reflect, the wondrous body was without form. Eternally abiding, unchanging—how could it be altered? The mind, profoundly still, lodged without disturbance. Neither governing nor dividing, neither teaching nor commanding, neither wise nor foolish, neither commanding nor acting. Serene in the use of the Dao, without emotional contention, they cast aside mechanism and released defilement, their empty minds naturally mirroring."

Sealing cavities and blocking crevices, withdrawing sight and reversing hearing—though influences and echoes were manifold, the centered mind remained unchanged. Obscured within the Great Void, form knew no realm of death.

At that moment, the immortal, beholding this divine transformation, lost all five senses. Though eons passed, they remained oblivious, sunk in darkness. Suddenly, they saw the Perfected One enter the flux of life and awakening, only then realizing how wind and clouds shift and all things stir into being.

Thereupon, the immortal prostrated in midair, vowing vows amid the clouds. Though sustained by the power of the Dao, joy and fear left them unable to find peace. Then the Three Perfected Ones, moved by the immortals, discerned their intent and, with a thunderous whisper, addressed them: "Why have you come, enduring the hardships of the cloud-path? You and I share the same Dao—what is there to observe beyond?"

The immortal dared not speak, only pleading for compassion and the gift of deliverance. Then the Most Peaceful Dao Lord said to them: "Why not entrust your spirit and qi to the fleeting and boundless, surrendering to nature amid being and nonbeing? Follow union and separation, yield to the flow of change. In an instant, drift through emptiness—your body does not abide. Abide in formlessness, silence your voice, and cleanse your thoughts. Be vast as the endless void, your spirit obscure and unlocated, mirroring emptiness and reflecting the sky. Ingest qi and conceal the true. Merge with the numinous root of purple essence, conceal your soul in the cloud-chamber, dissolve the light dust in the Great Beginning, and still primordial harmony in the vast heavens. Let things arise on their own, follow the true through darkness and light. Light as the edge of a cloud-cliff, you may remain unmoving yet ever in motion; dwelling in inner emptiness, you stand as if an infant yet unborn. Neither listening nor peering, you follow the flow of feeling. Neither releasing nor grasping, neither full nor empty—obliterated yet boundless, this is called the Mysterious Sameness."

At that moment, the immortal, hearing the True Lord’s words as if in a void, uttered a faint assent—yet before the echo faded, they looked up to see the Perfected One already ascending to the farthest reaches of emptiness. They could not catch up, could not speak, could not be heard. Form entered the Great Nonbeing, qi dissolved like floating clouds. Their heart filled with longing and devotion, they wished to attend and follow. Half their sincere intent was voiced: "I am unattached and unbound—why should I linger? You have not yet wholly forgotten, riding clouds and commanding qi."

Just as the immortal was about to speak, they saw the Supreme Perfected One soaring through the void, swifter than a shooting star, faster than lightning. The immortal pondered for a long while, then suddenly beheld the True Lord’s golden countenance in the dark, its radiance pervading all forms, drifting like mist in the void—beyond sight or hearing, yet knowing the subtlety of divine transformation.

Then the immortal and their retinue stood in the void, their hearts empty as they gazed upward, longing to grasp the essential truth and follow the Most Peaceful Heavenly Worthy into the lower realms. Their thoughts and wishes remained unwavering. The Heavenly Worthy, moved by this, spoke to them from the darkness: "The supreme Dao of all laws is natural. Though divine power and transformation follow the mind, the mind is never wearied; though they follow the body, the body does not act. This is called *non-doing that does*, *non-acting that acts*. *Non-acting that acts*—there is nothing it does not accomplish; *non-doing that does*—there is nothing it does not fulfill. If one *does* in order to *do*, the doing is incomplete; if one *acts* in order to *act*, the acting is not universal. Not enslaved to the mind, not laboring the body—the mind, unburdened, becomes numinous; the body, unwearied, brings forth life. When life and numinosity merge, there is nothing that does not come to be. This is called *not acting yet accomplishing*, *not doing yet generating*. The Dao is ever without doing, yet there is nothing it does not do. The root of the Primal Chaos, its principle exhausted here.

Good man, I too have no mind in performing these divine transformations. I merely follow the turning of descent and union, harmonizing the qi of life, establishing the Dharma-gate for all sentient beings—it cannot be otherwise. You should now know that the supreme Dao, though it becomes the dust of the world, passes through heart and mouth. The way of compassion is such by nature. Just as you, in the past, dwelled in the dust and encountered the great Dao, widely establishing ferries and crossings, nurturing and embracing all, delivering the withered and decayed—this too is the great Dao bestowing the kindness of a compassionate mother. It cradles, nourishes, feeds, shelters, and teaches in myriad ways. Though it does not labor, it too passes through the heart.

The Dao of Heaven is vast, yet its responses are subtle. It does not move without being stirred, nor has it ever been known to refuse a plea. The Dao is like the sea, the destination of all streams; the Dao is like the sky, the support of all things.

Good man, the days I do not wander are few. In the blink of ten thousand eons, time has already passed. Before this, I must ascend to the Great Luo above to pay homage to the Primal Worthy. Then I will traverse the heavens to address the host of Perfected Ones. Though you are high immortals, your method of roaming has not yet reached the highest heavens. For now, return to the Southern Florescence Palace. After a hundred thousand eons, I will descend to the Southern Florescence, and you shall see me then."

Thereupon, the high immortal received the teaching of the Most Peaceful Heavenly Worthy, bowed in farewell, and departed for the Southern Florescence Palace. Then the Heavenly Worthy, with the fleeting life of mortals, ascended to the Great Luo to pay homage to the Primal Worthy. They met in silence, communing through spirit alone. Then they ascended above the Great Luo to pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Void, also in silence. The Most High remained in profound stillness, the realm of the Dao silent and unmoving—no homage, no speech.

Then they entered the realm of the Great Void, where nothing was to be seen, and the Most Peaceful Heavenly Worthy too was formless. After what seemed three eons, they drifted down like a faint breath of mist. Thus the Three Worthies ascended through the twelve thousand heavens above, formless and silent. Then they entered the twelve thousand heavens of the middle, where form existed but no words were spoken. Then they entered the twelve thousand heavens below, where speech at last began.

Later, the Heavenly Worthy arrived at the Jade Clarity Heaven, where within the Cloud Palace they saw the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion. They spoke of the turning of the kalpa’s days, the time having come to labor in the transformation of the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy of Great Peace replied, "For this cause, I ascended to pay homage to the True Thearchs, roughly completing the circuit."

At that time, the three sacred bodies of the Heavenly Worthy of Great Peace shared a single seat. After another ten eons had passed, they sat in silent stillness with the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion.

Then the Supreme Immortal of Southern Prosperity beheld the true radiance of the Heavenly Worthy shining afar—unlike anything ordinary. From the Jade Clarity Heaven downward, countless disciples who had attained the Dao—upper, middle, and lower immortals in the hundreds of millions—each bearing offerings, incense, flowers, banners, canopies, and performing various musical arts, floated through the air to come and celebrate the Heavenly Worthy of Great Peace, while also paying homage to the True Thearch of Great Compassion. They burned incense, scattered flowers, chanted praises, and played music, encircling the Cloud Palace for seven days and seven nights. The heavens rained blossoms, fragrant smoke congealed in the void, jeweled forests bloomed with flowers to receive the sweet dew. Golden mountains surged forth, jade nectar flowed in streams, dragon mushrooms rose in rosy clouds, hidden herbs lifted mist, dragons hummed in the empty sky, immortal mists veiled the heavens, white tigers sang in chorus, and gentle winds brushed the dust. The immortals surrounded the four quarters, while the true lords arranged the banquet.

Then all the immortals descended from the floating clouds, arrayed in solemn dignity, and at once prostrated themselves, kneeling to gaze upward. They beheld the Heavenly Worthies each seated in their three palaces, draped in rosy clouds, their spirit-awareness like that of infants. Before their gaze could fully take them in, the Worthies had already entered formlessness. The three palaces’ purple clouds arose in the empty sky, and after a long while, suddenly one Heavenly Worthy was seen sitting alone in a palace. After another long interval, two Heavenly Worthies were seen seated side by side in attendance. Sometimes they flickered between presence and absence, now merging three into one, now scattering one into three—emerging from being, entering non-being, their bodies never abiding in constancy.

Then the immortals bowed their heads for a long time. The Illuminating Immortal of Southern Prosperity’s Upper Palace, the Radiant Spirit Immortal, rose into the empty sky and spoke: "Long ago in the Great Void, I beheld the Heavenly Worthy and stood in attendance through countless eons in the empty sky, never wavering in devotion. I was undeservingly favored with your grace, shown the appointed time of meeting, and lifted beyond my station. Since taking leave, my sincerity has remained as it was before."

The lower realms have known repeated cycles of decay and renewal. My heart, ever earnest in its devotion, has remained as parched and hungry as ever. Suddenly, I beheld the true light shining from afar—no different from its original radiance.

When the Heavenly Worthy had completed this round of affairs, he led the assembled immortals to purify the celestial court of its dust and defilement. Again, they bowed twice. The Heavenly Worthy declared: "I know your heart; no further words are needed. Each of you, return to your seats."

Then the immortals bowed once more and, obeying the command, resumed their places. The Heavenly Worthy spoke again: "I have no words of my own, nor do I recall what is in my heart. Yet through the empty echo of response, I mysteriously meet the emptiness of your devotion. Do you understand?"

The immortals replied: "We humbly receive your instruction and dare not fail to comprehend."

The Heavenly Worthy acknowledged this. Then the great assembly sat in silence for a hundred eons, utterly still. At that time, from the cloud palaces in the four directions of the mysterious void, there arose the sound of a spontaneously generated four-character hymn in Sanskrit. Its meaning was elusive, flickering like the wind stirring empty strings, or jade trees yielding celestial tones—harmonious and flowing, its words and principles subtle and wondrous, beyond full comprehension.

The assembled immortals dared not gaze or listen directly; only in their hearts did they retain fragments, at times grasping half a verse. Its text read:

The灵芝 grows rootless, the origin of all transformations.
Within, the seven *po* congeal; the three *hun* are masterfully bound.
The twenty-four Perfected Ones enter and exit without gate.
The essence of the dark and obscure flickers, elusive and without emotion.
It endures through kalpas of existence and decay, born with the ebb and flow of *qi*.
Externally, it solidifies the undifferentiated primordial; internally, it nurtures the seven meridians.
The five spirits plant blossoms; the Three Terraces spread their glory.
The Purple Pass and the White Youth reverse form to return to infancy.
They ascend on clouds, gallop through mists to manifest in the void.
Within, the Jade Perfected One is named Divine Lord.
To his left stands Wu Ying; to his right, Bai Yuan guards.
The Dark Beast halts behind; the Vermilion Phoenix flanks before.
Above floats an emerald canopy; below surges a golden lotus.
Fragrant clouds congeal in the void; sweet dew flows without end.
Used without exhaustion, its source never exhausted.

At that time, the assembled immortals heard the inner scripture of the celestial hymn from the void above, yet could not retain it. After a hundred kalpas, the Illustrious Spirit Immortal lifted his gaze to the Heavenly Worthy’s countenance and saw five-colored fragrant clouds issuing from the Heavenly Worthy’s mouth, ascending into the Great Void. Then, the Illustrious Spirit Immortal rose with the assembly, bowed, and inquired: "We do not presume to ask why, after the Heavenly Worthy sat in silence for a hundred kalpas without sound, fragrant clouds now issue from your mouth. We wish to know the Heavenly Worthy’s purpose and cause—pray, distinguish and reveal it to enlighten the unenlightened."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The fragrant clouds from my mouth respond to the Golden Portal Sovereign of Later Saints. I previously descended among the Four Heavens, and the appointed time has now arrived. At this moment, each sage fulfills their destined task. When this occurs, Heaven and Earth also respond. When Heaven responds, the Three Luminaries herald auspices, and five-colored radiant clouds form a double wheel. When Earth responds, the Five Peaks manifest omens, the Earth Treasury releases its store, and gold and jade reveal their forms. Such are the signs: the Golden Portal Sovereign will soon descend to the world, though the exact day remains unappointed. At this time, I too observe these events."

Then, the Illustrious Spirit Immortal further inquired about the origin and cause of the inner scripture of the celestial hymn. The Heavenly Worthy of Great Peace addressed the immortal: "Do you not know? The Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion governs within this palace of the void, where true *qi* produces this sound—the spontaneous celestial scripture, numinous verses, and precious texts—rarely encountered. Even later sages and immortals who hear it do not comprehend. This sound harmonizes to generate spirit and regulate the true *qi*—a path unknown to the common world. I know your heart seeks to record what is not yours to record. You and these immortals are not yet destined to receive and uphold the spontaneous inner scripture of the celestial hymn."

The Illustrious Spirit Immortal replied to the Heavenly Worthy: "This disciple, though unworthy, shall recite and contemplate the scripture. I humbly beg your pardon and permission to receive and uphold it." The Heavenly Worthy said: "That you have heard it is your karmic destiny; the Dharma ordains your attainment of truth. Guard it well, and do not recklessly disseminate it. Cultivate it in silence, and your learning will not betray others. If you leak it, calamity arises; if you keep it secret, blessings accrue."

Then, the entire assembly rose and bowed, receiving the inner scripture. In that moment, within the void above, cloud-seal script appeared in the empty clarity—each character a *zhang* in size, with eight corners trailing radiance, glowing brilliantly. The immortals then inscribed the jade script anew, each treasuring a copy and concealing it in a brocade pouch. At that time, the cloud-seal script lingered in the void, never fading. The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Where true *qi* covers, the longer it endures, the more abundant it becomes. If you cultivate it, you too shall be thus—your lifespan boundless, your form renewed with each day. What the highest Perfected Ones treasure is not bestowed upon lesser immortals. Those whose Dao-number is insufficient—how much less the common world?"

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Illustrious Spirit: "Know that the supreme Dao in all matters must not be recklessly divulged—how much less the celestial scripture? Treasure it, and do not transmit the inner scripture downward." The minds of the common world cannot attain this.

Then, the Illustrious Spirit Immortal bowed and knelt, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "Though the common world below dwells in impurity, there are those who know the Dao and cultivate to attain truth. Might such a person receive transmission?" The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Such people are as rare as one in a hundred million. How can you discern one who harmonizes with truth?"

The Illustrious Spirit answered: "In your disciple’s Southern Prosperity Palace, there are records of true immortals. At the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, the lower offices report to the upper, presenting merits and transgressions without omission." The Heavenly Worthy said: "The minds of the common world below are difficult to distinguish. Some feign cultivation of my Dao, concealing impurity and harboring deceit, their hearts seeking external gains, their resolve unstable. Examine their faults, scrutinize their spirits. Without this, purity and turbidity remain indistinguishable. Some pursue fame and profit, clinging to the gate of mystery, peering at the lower currents, prizing only extensive learning. If you wish to teach the common world, you must clarify such people."

Then, the Illustrious Spirit Immortal, not yet understanding the sagely decree, further inquired: "I do not presume to ask how to scrutinize their spirits—pray, reveal it, for my heart delights in hearing it." The Heavenly Worthy said: "Within each person’s body resides a spirit, stationed in the heart. Whatever the heart desires, the spirit already knows. When the body intends evil, the spirit does not follow. The yin traitors within the body—the *hun* are not restrained, the *po* are not controlled—at the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, they report to the Supreme Emperor. Through this, one may know. If a person possesses hidden virtue, the three *hun* do not depart, the seven *po* do not scatter; good spirits assist, and heavenly soldiers guard. Through this, they naturally harmonize with the Dao.

"Good man, the supreme great Dao knows without being spoken. I fear you have not yet grasped this—you must deeply guard against it and not lightly disseminate it. Good man, you have encountered me in the Great Void across countless kalpas. Now, you have again met me and heard the wondrous Dharma. In no long time, you shall naturally comprehend all Dharmas. The hearts of truth and falsehood will be as clear as if before your eyes, with nothing left un-discerned. This is the thorough penetration of body and mind with the Dao, enabling unobstructed understanding."

Then, the assembled immortals, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion, rejoiced among themselves. They bowed and knelt, each commanding their attendants to perform music in celebration.

A thousand tones harmonized in resonance, the Dharma drums pierced the heavens. At that moment, floating rosy clouds drifted and swirled, incense smoke coiled through the void, flying canopies wheeled in the sky, long banners danced in the wind, dragons chanted across the distant heavens, phoenixes sang in the empty courtyard. Heaven and earth trembled; the two luminaries hung like wheels. The divine toad emerged from the moon, treading upon the numinous void, while the sun-crow flapped its wings and soared through the sky.

At this time, thirty-seven celestial disciples from the lower realms, having attained immortality upon witnessing these auspicious signs, simultaneously ascended into the void, rising to the Jade Purity Heaven like intersecting clouds. The Heavenly Worthy of Great Peace addressed Zhao Ling, saying: "Immortals, regardless of rank, can all move heaven and earth, command the myriad spirits. You should know the inconceivable power of the Dao, so that all lower immortals may hear and understand."

Then, the thirty-seven heavens’ immortals—countless millions—filled the Cloud Palace. They burned incense, scattered flowers, and each declared their original vows. The Heavenly Worthy, perceiving their intentions, entered the great samadhi of compassion, gathering their minds and inscribing them into the Register of the Numinous. There, they merged with the Dao of the Nine Natural Transformations, which manifested as the Nine Heavens. Within them, the Nine Qi coalesced, forming the Nine Palaces. The Three Worthies then divided and resided within the Nine Palaces, each seated upon a nine-dragon throne. At that moment, they were named the Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

The Lord of the Great Peace led the immortals into the Nine Palaces. The Heavenly Worthy then expounded the Dao of the Nine Immortals to them, aligning above with the Nine Heavens, at the center with the Nine Palaces, mysteriously corresponding to the Nine Qi, and below governing the Nine Springs—able to enter the unobstructed. This is what is meant by "one generates three, three generates nine, nine times nine is eighty-one," presiding over the law of primordial generation, endlessly revolving. Those who study hereafter, able to generate and perfect, will abide in the primordial and naturally attain perfection.

The assembled immortals, beholding this subtlety, dared not speak, each knowing they had thus received life, unaware that the Heavenly Worthy was now revealing it. With earnest devotion and humble reverence, they harbored shame, not knowing how to express their gratitude. The Heavenly Worthy, anticipating their thoughts, addressed them: "The supreme great Dao requires nothing; why speak further? My body sits in the Dao-field, my spirit communes with the myriad emperors. I am no ordinary being, yet I receive empty words. If one claims to have attained the Dao, even lowly ghosts and commoners—except for the mute—have never been without speech, yet cannot attain it. I do not say that when the great Dao responds to the mundane, all words are entirely absent. My true body is before you, and you are no ordinary beings. For this reason, you fail to comprehend here, seeking answers with your minds. Listen in silence: the supreme great Dao’s Dharma requires no words of gratitude."

The immortals, receiving the Heavenly Worthy’s teaching, each bowed their heads, contemplating the grace of the Dao. After a long while, Zhao Ling, the Supreme Immortal of the Southern Prosperity Palace, prostrated and said: "Formerly, I received the Heavenly Worthy’s decree to descend into the world, traveling the ten directions. The appointed time has not yet come. I humbly request the Heavenly Worthy to briefly descend to the Southern Prosperity Palace, if only for a fleeting moment, so that my long-held sincerity across ten thousand kalpas may be fulfilled in this wish." The assembly bowed their heads, prostrating for a long time, awaiting the response.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "I have already taken leave of the Great Emperor and bid farewell to all the Worthies. Upon returning to the Cloud Palace, my karmic conditions will be complete. If you wish to invite me, I shall not refuse your heart." The immortals, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s decree, rejoiced immeasurably.

The Heavenly Worthy continued: "You immortals should now depart. The Cloud Palace has always been serene; it is not fitting to linger amidst the defilements of the world. When the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion of the Cloud Palace formerly manifested in the world, there were brief teachings. Now, returning to the Cloud Palace, I revert to emptiness and non-being. I have come here for the sake of the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion, to look upon those who study hereafter. You immortals should understand this."

Then, Zhao Ling, the Supreme Immortal, again inquired of the Heavenly Worthy: "May I ask when the Heavenly Worthy will come again?" The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Before long, after twenty thousand kalpas, I shall soon return."

At that time, the immortals assented, bowing twice before taking leave of the Heavenly Worthy. They then bid farewell to the True Emperor of Great Compassion, prostrated, and withdrew. Looking up at the high seat, they no longer saw the Heavenly Worthy. Gazing around, they saw the Three Sages had also entered the void. Only the Cloud Palace remained, silent and empty, with a faint fragrant breeze stirring and incense smoke lingering. Flying canopies hovered in the sky, banners stood in the void, celestial music fell silent, and all sounds ceased.

The immortals, witnessing the majestic spiritual power of the supreme Dao—suddenly manifesting from being and returning to non-being—lingered for a long while, lost and without support. They boarded their cloud chariots and followed one another back. Then, all the immortals accompanied Zhao Ling, the Supreme Immortal, returning to the Southern Prosperity Palace, where they cultivated the *Heavenly Scriptures of the Hidden Life* and the *Precious Canon*. After eighteen years, they all attained the true Dao. For twenty thousand kalpas, they awaited with empty hearts.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, from within the Cloud Palace, saw from afar that the immortals had attained the true Dao. From the Cloud Palace, the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion manifested his left hand. At that moment, the thirty-three heavens opened their gates. All the celestial beings saw the Heavenly Worthy’s left hand, like a white rainbow spanning the great void, its five fingernails emitting five-colored radiance that illuminated the Southern Prosperity Palace.

The Perfected ones all prostrated and bowed twice to the left hand. Within its light, they saw from afar the Heavenly Worthy in the emptiness of the Cloud Palace, holding the Heavenly Script’s left tally, its single character radiating eight-colored light. The Perfected ones leapt with joy, knowing the Heavenly Worthy had come from afar to bestow his seal. The Dao is not dual in its words; seeing his left hand in the Cloud Palace, it remained for ten thousand kalpas before withdrawing back into the Cloud Palace. The light, likewise, after ten thousand kalpas, followed the hand and returned.

After twenty thousand kalpas, the Perfected ones trod upon the void and stood in emptiness, gazing afar toward the upper realms. At dawn on the first day of the first month, they saw a three-colored radiance of qi descending straight from the rising sun in the east into the Southern Prosperity Palace, coiling and swirling throughout the great void. The fragrance of the wind was intensely rich, unlike anything ordinary. For ninety thousand years, this occurred every morning without fail. Each dawn, the Perfected ones bowed their heads to receive the qi, performing ninety cycles of scripture recitation. After thirty years, the numinous qi permeated their bodies, congealing within, then emerged from behind their necks and surged upward into the heavens—azure, crimson, and white—never to fade again.

After another twenty thousand kalpas, at dawn on the first day of the seventh month, they suddenly beheld the Three Sacred Manifestations of the Heavenly Worthy of Great Peace seated within the threefold qi. Then, the Heavenly Worthy emitted his primordial radiance from the heart, at first faint as a firefly. In an instant, it suffused his entire form, inside and out, illuminating the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace. For a long while, the Heavenly Worthy’s Dao-body became like light itself, undifferentiated, merging with the heavens in boundless brilliance—like the full sun, yet without scorching heat. Its splendor dazzled the eyes, its rays piercing all, neither dim nor excessive. This endured for a thousand kalpas. The Perfected immortals, abiding within this light, rejoiced and delighted, their forms reverting to youth, their complexions like those of children. They trod upon the void as if treading on light clouds. Such was the power of the true radiance. Though countless kalpas passed, their hearts knew no sorrow, for they found joy in the Dao, forgetting all else.

After a thousand kalpas, the Three Sacred Manifestations suddenly saw within the light an innumerable host of Perfected immortals—myriad millions—gazing upward, standing in long obeisance, silent and reverent. The Heavenly Worthy knew their hearts. These immortals had all attained great penetration, possessing divine communion; they also knew the Heavenly Worthy’s compassion for the multitude, his broad opening of the Dharma-gate, and his merciful perfection of all beings. Unobstructed, they wielded the powers of the Dao—able to perform seven transformations and nine transmutations, perceiving all dharmas with clarity. Yet they knew not the Heavenly Worthy’s thousandfold, myriad transformations, his boundless mastery, his power to turn others’ mortal forms into Dharma-bodies in but a moment. Above heaven and below earth, he alone was revered among the ten thousand Ways. His divine power was peerless, beyond all conception.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Subjugation of Demons**

At that time, from the six desire-realms of the form and formless worlds, there came eighty-four thousand heretical immortals of the six rebellious factions, fond of debate and contention. They often vied in divine powers in the lower realms, skilled in illusions and transformations, their hearts arrogant and proud. They styled themselves great masters, roaming the three realms alone, possessing the five penetrations, and living for eighty thousand great kalpas. Hearing that the Heavenly Worthy had descended to the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, they led their followers, riding upon lions, and after six minor kalpas, arrived at the Southern Prosperity Palace, desiring to see the Heavenly Worthy and compare their divine powers, testing their Daoist arts.

The Heavenly Worthy, already knowing their intent, remained silent and unmoving with the great assembly, seated upon a dragon throne seven ren above the earth. Then, the eighty-four thousand heretical immortals arrived all at once. Gazing up at the sacred assembly, they felt no reverence, nor did they recognize the ranks of the Heavenly Worthy of Great Peace and the true immortals. They sought to ascend the high seat, yet none could mount it.

Among the heretical immortals was a great immortal named Rābila, the foremost leader of the heretical host. Changing countenance, he declared: “I am the great master of the three realms, uniquely enlightened to fortune and misfortune. I have heard of the supreme Great Dao—yet among this great assembly, who is the most revered?”

Then, the Heavenly Worthy pointed to the Illustrious Numinous Perfected One, designating him as the Heavenly Worthy. Thereupon, Rābila cried out harshly: “Do you possess the Dao?”

The Illustrious Numinous One replied: “I have no Dao.”

Rābila said: “If you have no Daoist arts, by what mysterious method do you claim this high seat? I wish to sit and discourse—let me ascend at once.”

The Illustrious Numinous One answered: “This high seat is named the Seat of the Great Dao’s Compassion. Even if you exhaust your strength to climb it, you will not ascend. If you force your way up, you will never succeed.”

Rābila asked: “Why can I not ascend?”

The Illustrious Numinous One replied: “You are a straight-legged demon of the lower form and desire realms, falsely assuming the guise of an immortal.”

Then, all the heretical immortals raised their legs, only to find them rigid and unbending, unable to flex. Even when they sought to sit upon the ground, they could not.

At that moment, Rābila exhausted his divine power, raising his voice to chant spells. His followers—eighty-four thousand in number—threw themselves from the sky, their movements synchronized with the urgency of his incantation. Then, Rābila once more summoned all his spiritual might, seeking to shake heaven and earth; his disciples all collapsed to the ground, rolling and flipping uncontrollably, unable to cease.

Yet Rābila’s heart remained unconvinced. He demanded to test his art of invisibility against the Perfected One, Illustrious Numinous. The Perfected One, moved by great compassion, granted his request.

Rābila said: “You conceal yourself first.”

At once, the assembly of sagely beings in the palace vanished entirely. The eighty-four thousand heretical immortals, though they soared through the air arm in arm, could perceive nothing. Returning to their original place, they marveled at what they had never before witnessed. In but a moment, the great assembly reappeared, as if they had never moved at all.

The Lord of the Dao, Illustrious Numinous, then commanded Rābila to conceal himself along with his followers. Rābila strained every ounce of his might and transformed into a mass of black qi. The Perfected One exhaled once, and the eighty-four thousand demons collapsed like lifeless corpses, senseless and inert. After a long while, the Lord of the Dao gently breathed upon them, and they revived as one, rising to repent their errors, their faith now turned toward submission.

Then, the Lord of the Dao intoned the Chapter of the Whisk for Subduing Demons with compassionate power, causing the eighty-four thousand heretical immortals to hover between life and death. After a long while, when the demons had revived and caught their breath, they became aware of their bodies reeking of decay and gasping for air. Bowing their heads before the Dao, they spoke: “We do not know by what method the Heavenly Worthy has cultivated, that his divine power is thus. How long is his lifespan?”

The Lord of the Dao replied: “I cultivate the supreme Dao, the practice of compassion, forbearance, and humility. My body knows no realm of death, and my divine power is unconstrained.”

The Lord of the Dao, testing them with his great compassion, asked in turn: “By what method do you cultivate? How long is your lifespan?”

Rābila answered: “I practice the divine spells of the Four Heavens of the Desire Realm, one of which is called *As-You-Wish*. It suffices to extend my life to eighty thousand great eons. No lifespan in the upper realms exceeds this. Yet when my allotted time ends, I shall be reborn according to my karma.”

And in my teaching, though one may cultivate diligently and attain the five supernatural powers, still one cannot escape old age and death; though one may comprehend the principle of emptiness, there is no method for eternal life.”

At that moment, the Lord of the Dao, perceiving their thoughts, did not answer. Instead, he asked Rābila: “Do you know the root of your own teaching?”

Rābila replied: “I do not. This matter is of great antiquity, difficult to investigate in detail.”

The Lord of the Dao said: “Your teaching originates from the spirit of Mount Kunlun in your heaven, who styles himself the Lord of the Four Heavens, or the Four Heavenly Immortal Kings, or the Divine Kings. He promulgated this teaching to transform the beings of the Form and Desire Realms in the borderlands. Your own master derives from this same origin—it is not the spontaneous, supreme Dao of the Great Way. In the lower two realms and borderlands, beings practice a minor skill and call themselves immortals. Thus, these false immortals imitate one another, unaware of the supreme, unsurpassed teaching of the Great Dao.”

Rābila asked again: “How many methods are there in the supreme Dao? How many ranks of immortals? What are the names of the scriptures? I have heard of the Heavenly Worthy but have never beheld him. Yet in this great assembly, all are called Heavenly Worthies, with other titles besides—all are upper immortals, though there are also lesser immortals.”

Then the Perfected One said to Rābila: “The supreme Dao is one, but in its branches, there are thirty-six thousand kinds of teachings, all originating from the one Dao. The ranks of immortals and perfected beings number one hundred and twenty grades, all revering the Heavenly Worthy. The cloud-script forms natural celestial writings—hence, the *Celestial Scriptures*. The Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Peace, the Void and Non-Being, ever abides in the Mystery. With your mortal eyes and the limited vision of the five powers, you cannot behold the true countenance of the Three Worthies. I have studied the Dao for countless eons and only now attained the rank of Perfected One. All in this assembly are upper immortals.”

Rābila asked again: “The divine power of the Perfected One is already incomparable. How much greater must be the majesty of the Heavenly Worthy?”

The Perfected One replied: “It is not what your eyes can see or your ears can hear. After tens of thousands of great eons, he will descend to transform the world. With your perilous lifespan of eighty thousand eons, you will not live to see that time. Do not ask of this—it is beyond your reach. Your body reeks of foulness and decay, the stench of impermanence. If you would not defile my celestial palace, you must depart at once and not linger.”

At that moment, Rābila had no place to stand. He returned to the lower realm. The celestial path was long, and though he had ascended in his youth, taking six minor eons to do so, he had dallied too long. Now, aged and decrepit, his divine power waning, his spirit confused, and his mind bewildered, he had no recourse. Gazing at one another in sorrow, tears streaming down, they bid farewell to the Perfected One and hastily returned to the Desire Realm. Circling Mount Kunlun, they sought out the False King and recounted their journey to the upper realms, their encounter with the Perfected Ones of the Great Dao, the display of divine power, and the revelation of their origins.

Hearing this, the False King trembled in all five spirits, swooned, and revived only after a long while. Coming to his senses, he said to Rābila: “Stop, say no more! If the gods hear of this, they will spread word among humans that our arts are ineffectual.” Thereafter, the false immortals retreated to the southern mountains, dwelling by the waters. At the four seasons and eight solar terms, they would possess people, singing, chanting, and roaring, calling themselves Immortal Kings. They sought offerings and prayers, practiced illusions, and roamed the lower world, creating branches of their own, altering and fabricating false teachings, and presumptuously establishing ranks—over six hundred in all. When the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal appears in response to the kalpa, these false immortals will be utterly destroyed, leaving no trace.

Then the Illustrious Numinous Lord of the Dao addressed the assembly of Perfected Ones: “When the false immortals first arrived, the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, did not personally confront these vulgar beings of the lower realms. He commanded me, a minor adept, to display divine majesty before them. It was by the power of the Great Dao and this assembly that I overawed these heterodox immortals—not by my own ability alone. Such defilement is truly unseemly. Yet when the supreme Great Dao responds to the needs of the time, such measures may be necessary. It is not to be wondered at.”

Then Dān Huò, the Cavern Perfected named Tōng Xuán, rose from his seat, knelt, and asked the Illustrious Numinous Lord of the Dao: “May the *Chapter on Subduing Demons* be recorded? I wish to receive and practice it.”

The Illustrious Numinous Lord of the Dao replied: “Though this is an assembly of celestial perfected beings, I dare not transmit it on my own authority. First, I must report above.”

Then the two Perfected Ones presented the matter to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Peace, who instructed: “To overawe the demonic beings of the lower teachings, first strike the golden bell thirty-six times on the left, then recite the *Mantra of Majesty* three times. Its text reads:

*Golden bells bound with lightning and fire,
Fierce roars shake the Nine Origins.*”

Murderous qi surges and flames scatter to dust,
Ten thousand demons are extirpated, a thousand fiends meet their end.
The Thunder Father treads the void,
Thunderbolts and whirlwinds reverse their course.
Sever heads and slit the noses of the vile,
Uproot the demonic and annihilate their roots.
Those who defy me perish,
Those who submit to me endure.
The Seven Stars drip blood,
The Metal Deity blazes with lightning.
The spirit blade flashes with lightning,
The jade axe bears frost.
Mighty warriors march ahead—
What ghost dares stand in their way?
Those who contend in qi are destroyed,
Those who resist meet calamity.
Above, the Purple Canopy floats,
Below, the Golden Throne is seated.
Cinnabar clouds interlace and shimmer,
Sun and moon serve as its light.
The gate is guarded by the numinous toad,
Corpses ward it with golden radiance.
The Five Poisons conceal treachery,
Ten thousand demons are annihilated.
The Seven Perfected cultivate within,
A thousand mights expand without.
Souls return to the Purple Palace,
Spirits enter the Cinnabar Chamber.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “This is the *Inner Might Mantra of Supreme Mystery*, which destroys the inauspicious and slays the perverse. Later learners among the immortals and Daoists who have not yet attained the utmost mystery may, if they fear much inauspicious killing, recite this divine mantra and, following the rites, secure their defense. A thousand perversities will lose their essence, ten thousand demons will forfeit their qi. The spirit will be at peace, the body secure, and all will be bright and fearless.”

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “The method of the Supreme Dao is perfected spontaneously without intent; there is no need to recite this mighty chapter. This is the *Mighty Register of Numinous Might* within the *Dao-Field of Supreme Mystery’s Emptiness and Quiescence*. To the left of the demonic gate, strike the golden bell thirty-six times to summon the mighty warriors. To the right, sound the jade chime fourteen times to gather the perfected numina. In the center, beat the Dharma drum twelve times to announce it to the Supreme Emperor. The gods of life array themselves within, the mighty warriors expand without. The twin luminaries enter the eyes, the mouth emits numinous radiance. The head bears the Seven Stars, the feet tread the Mysterious Net. The jade censer wafts incense, the body sits upon the Golden Throne. Ten thousand essences forfeit their qi, a thousand fiends perish of themselves.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “If mortals of the lower realms practice this method alone without grasping its true essentials, they may live to two hundred and forty years, and ghosts cannot harm them.”

Thereupon, Dān Huò, the Cavern Perfected, received the essential words with reverence, joyfully announced his gratitude, and bowed in thanks. He then put them into practice.

At that time, Dān Huò, the Cavern Perfected, together with thirty-seven heavens’ host of perfected immortals—countless myriads—simultaneously prostrated themselves, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “I have long been blessed with residual fortune and have chanced to encounter the Highly Exalted One. You have bestowed compassion upon me, lifting me from the depths of sinking, and enabled me to transform my mortal frame. I have presumptuously taken the foremost place, rashly ascending the heights of the mystery, and my excess is more than enough. Not measuring my foolish insignificance, I now resolve to abandon thoughts of retreat. I shall remain here, sheltered in the shadow of Nanchang, awaiting the time when the Compassionate Exalted One descends to the world. I wish to accompany your cloud-borne carriage, attending and guarding you morning and evening, bearing the canopy and tending the censer. I only pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in your great compassion, will grant this request.”

Having finished speaking, he bowed twice more and prostrated himself to receive the teaching.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “The Great Dao is impartial; good responds to good. You have inherited the power of your vow—what need is there for further entreaty? The appointed time is not far off. Within the span of tens of thousands of kalpas, the celestial halls are vast and distant—roam and dwell there as you will. When the time comes to descend to the world, you too must assist in proclaiming the true Dharma and spreading its transformation in the lower realms. We Three Sages each transform the Three Realms. At that time, the number of those delivered will also be beyond count.”

Thereupon, the perfected beings, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s gracious assent to their attendance, saw their deepest wishes fulfilled. Overjoyed and exultant, they all bowed in thanks.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the later perfected ones: “Your Dao is still shallow; you have not yet penetrated the ultimate principle. First, enter the *Great Samādhi of Concentrating the Spirit* for one kalpa and exhaust all thoughts. Next, enter the *Great Samādhi of Forgetting Form*, where all responses and perceptions are empty. Next, enter the *Great Samādhi of the Six Voids*, where you respond as circumstances arise. Next, enter the *Great Samādhi of the Supreme Void*, where you divide your body into ten thousand millions. Next, enter the *Great Samādhi of Dynamic Potency*, which is the root of all transformations. Next, enter the *Great Samādhi of Generative Potency*, which pervades and generates all things. Next, enter the *Great Samādhi of Great Compassion*, which nurtures and matures all things. Next, enter the *Great Samādhi of Great Mercy*, which conceals and sustains all things. If you can accomplish these eight, you will then ascend to the rank of the Supreme Perfected and be numbered among the Later Sages. You will be commissioned by the Great Dao to respond in due order to the movements of the times, and exalted titles will be bestowed upon you. If you wish to follow me in descending to the world to teach and transform, but your mind is not settled, you will be unable to generate transformations. Your true responses will be obstructed, and you will be unable to initiate resonances.”

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy, having spoken these words, immediately entered the *Great Samādhi of Concentrating the Spirit*, motionless and indistinguishable from his original state. The perfected ones also followed the Heavenly Worthy into the *Great Samādhi of Concentrating the Spirit*.

The Heavenly Worthy emerged from this samādhi and entered the *Great Samādhi of Forgetting Form*. The perfected ones likewise followed the Heavenly Worthy into the *Great Samādhi of Forgetting Form*.

Having emerged from this samādhi, the Heavenly Worthy entered the *Great Samādhi of the Six Voids*. The perfected ones also followed the Heavenly Worthy into the *Great Samādhi of the Six Voids*.

Having emerged from the *Great Samādhi of the Six Voids*, the Heavenly Worthy entered the *Great Samādhi of the Supreme Void*. The perfected ones likewise followed the Heavenly Worthy into the *Great Samādhi of the Supreme Void*.

The Heavenly Worthy emerged from this samādhi and entered the *Great Samādhi of Dynamic Potency*. The perfected ones also followed the Heavenly Worthy into the *Great Samādhi of Dynamic Potency*.

The Heavenly Worthy emerged from the *Great Samādhi of Dynamic Potency* and entered the *Great Samādhi of Generative Potency*. The perfected ones likewise followed the Heavenly Worthy into the *Great Samādhi of Generative Potency*.

The Heavenly Worthy emerged from the *Great Samādhi of Generative Potency* and entered the *Great Samādhi of Great Compassion*. The perfected ones also followed the Heavenly Worthy into the *Great Samādhi of Great Compassion*.

The Heavenly Worthy emerged from the *Great Samādhi of Great Compassion* and entered the *Great Samādhi of Great Mercy*. The perfected ones likewise followed the Heavenly Worthy into the *Great Samādhi of Great Mercy*.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy emerged from the samādhis of potency and, entering into the power of spontaneous spiritual freedom, suddenly ascended into the mystery. Treading the void in inverted light, in an instant he traversed the thirty-six thousand heavens and returned to his original place, motionless and still, harboring within himself thirty-six thousand suns and moons. Within his body, he opened thirty-six thousand celestial gates. Within his body, he manifested thirty-six thousand Heavenly Emperors, and within each Heavenly Emperor’s body, he beheld thirty-six thousand celestial gates. He also saw that each of the thirty-six thousand Heavenly Emperors had thirty-six thousand attendants, and each attendant sat upon a dragon throne. Each dragon throne was shaded by a flying canopy, and the canopies, vast and wide, covered all the realms.

In an instant, the thirty-six thousand heavens and earths trembled as one, celestial blossoms rained from the sky, and jeweled mountains surged from the ground.

Then, from within the Heavenly Venerable’s body emerged thirty-six thousand dragon wheels, bearing thirty-six thousand suns and moons, returning to the heavens.

At that moment, all withered bones within the three realms arose and transformed into living beings, reversing the course of age—hoary hair turned black, fallen teeth regrew, the five viscera bloomed like flowers, and ears and eyes regained their sharpness.

In another instant, the thirty-six thousand heavens were swept by great winds and thunder, sweet rains poured in torrents, all phenomena quickened to life, blossoms unfurled in splendor, celestial nectar descended, jade marrow flowed freely, perfected immortals of formless purity chanted in clarity, their voices resounding through the boundless void.

Then, the star palaces arrayed themselves in the empty sky as cloud chambers, above congealing into purple mists, below forming adamantine foundations. Tenfold radiance draped the heavens, jeweled canopies stretched high, windows opened to bright moons, doors gleamed with numinous light. White jade served as tables, golden essence as couches; true sovereigns stood in attendance, immortal youths burned incense.

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable and the assembled perfected ones took their places in the cloud chambers, seated upon dragon thrones. Phoenixes sang and dragons intoned, immortal birds danced in the courtyard, and the divine power shifted myriad forms at will.

The perfected ones marveled at what they had never before witnessed.

Then the Heavenly Venerable addressed them: "The methods of the supreme Dao—its divine power transforms endlessly. Yet if one has not awakened to its essence, stillness and wisdom remain empty and unobstructed, for it operates without intent. The mind does not strive, yet accomplishment arises of itself; wisdom does not act, yet illumination shines forth. Forced effort yields no clarity; forced action bears no fruit. It is most rare, most subtle—difficult to name. When you attain great penetration, it will naturally be thus."

All the perfected ones rose as one, bowing in gratitude, and vowed to receive these essential words.

The Heavenly Venerable continued: "Such divine transformations and the cultivation of stillness and wisdom are but steps upon the great Dao’s path. They are the methods of responding to the times and delivering the world—such is the Dharma."

Then, knowing that the perfected ones’ bodies and minds were unobstructed and their wisdom and power vast, capable of great tasks, the Heavenly Venerable led them to ascend above the Great Net, where they paid homage to the Heavenly Venerable of the Formless and received their appointments as supreme perfected ones. After countless kalpas, they would be granted honorific titles and ascend once more to the Great Net to pay homage to the Heavenly Venerable of the Formless.

The Heavenly Venerable declared: "Your Dao has reached its culmination; it is fitting to bestow upon you the office of supreme perfected ones. Each of you shall serve in the bureaus of the perfected ones." The jade scrolls and azure tablets were inscribed, and the perfected ones were commanded to read the tablets and behold their names, their honorific titles now fixed. They bowed again in reverence.

The Heavenly Venerable said: "Thus, in profound silence."

The perfected ones received their charge and returned to the cloud chambers of Southern Florescence. Seated in grand assembly, they celebrated for seven days and seven nights as celestial blossoms rained down, shaking the thirty-seven heavens. From the great earth, mountains and peaks surged forth in response to the heavens above. Heaven and earth resounded as one, praising the goodness of the moment.

At that time, the Three Venerables of Great Peace and the assembled perfected ones entered the great stillness of profound samādhi. The celestial palaces fell utterly silent, save for the fragrant smoke rising ceaselessly from the incense officials, enduring for a full kalpa.

After one kalpa, the Heavenly Venerable emerged from the great stillness and entered the wisdom of movement. In an instant, divine mists spread in all directions, warm qi surged from the eight directions, gentle winds stirred the fragrant smoke, and sweet dew softened the dust.

Then, the Heavenly Venerable emerged from the wisdom of movement and entered the wisdom of generation. In the blink of an eye, all phenomena arose from emptiness—clouds and mists soared upward, thunder rumbled and lightning flashed, divine herbs bloomed with blossoms, phoenixes sang in jade groves, and canopies stirred as rosy clouds arose.

The Heavenly Venerable addressed the perfected ones: "The method of movement and generation responds to the advent of the Later Sage of the Golden Portal, whose arrival is not far off. The great sages of the ten directions together proclaim these auspicious signs—not I alone."

When the Heavenly Venerable had spoken these words, all the assembled sages sat in silent stillness. The golden censers and fragrant blossoms remained ever fragrant and abundant. As they descended, myriad transformations unfolded. On that day, rare and wondrous divine powers manifested in full.

*Thus concludes Scroll Six of the* Supreme Dao Jade Clarity Scripture.
*Scroll Seven of the* Supreme Dao Jade Clarity Scripture *begins.*

**Chapter Seventeen: The Dao’s Transformation of the Four Barbarians**

At that time, in the Right Jade Terrace of the Jade Clarity Heaven, there resided a perfected one named Treasure Radiance, who served as the Supreme Prime. By reckoning the descent of his destiny, he descended to the gate of the Divine Continent’s Heavenly King, Haoyuan. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month at noon, he rode a chariot of purple clouds, accompanied by two immortals. Together, they transformed into sunlight and entered the womb of the Lady of the Xuanshi clan while she slept, entering through her mouth and dwelling in her womb for three years.

At that time, the lady was but eighteen years of age. One day, as she napped, she awoke to find herself with child. A divine fragrance arose, thick and intense, and her faculties grew keen. Her countenance bloomed with beauty, her form robust and flourishing. When alone, she constantly heard the sounds of metal and stone nearby, or faintly discerned the recitation of scriptures, as if chanting the verses of the true scriptures in harmony with her heart. Her body felt light and strong, surpassing her usual state.

Three months later, on the third day of the third month at noon, the lady, accompanied by three hundred maidens, went to the eastern city to enjoy the gardens. Resting upon the Fragrant Grove Terrace, she suddenly smelled a fragrance assailing her senses. In an instant, two embroidered-robed youths appeared beside her, each holding a golden tally. The lady asked, “Who are you?” The youths replied, “We are divine youths in service to the Jade Clarity Heaven, dispatched by the Heavenly Venerable of Jade Clarity. We have come here on his command.” The lady asked, “Why have you come?” The youths answered, “The Supreme Emperor has sent this tally to summon the Great King.” The lady replied, “The king is not here.” The youths said, “The king is within your womb.” Overjoyed, the lady immediately sat upon the edge of her bed. Suddenly, she felt the infant emerge from her left side. The lady then gathered her attendants to hold the newborn. The two immortal messengers knelt and greeted him, saying, “We have long awaited these three years, laboring for your descent into the world.” The infant shook his head, smiling for a long while. Beneath his eyes shone double pupils, casting a distant glow of purple light. He laughed three times, then ceased, his laughter vanishing in an instant.

At that moment, before the Fragrant Spring Terrace, the moon pond surged with waves. Five-colored dragon kings emerged from the pool, their mouths filled with fragrant water to bathe the infant. When the father-king heard the news, he hastened to the scene in his chariot. The ministers offered their congratulations, and the entire kingdom rejoiced with music. A general amnesty was declared throughout the land. The father-king commanded his ministers and the palace maidens to prepare grand music, lavish gifts of silk, and fragrant flowers beneath canopies to welcome the child back to the palace. As the procession entered the city, a seven-day celebration ensued.

The infant was brought forth, and the great ministers deliberated, investing him as the crown prince. They bestowed upon him a hundred offices, enriching him with favor and emoluments. At that time, auspicious clouds flowed downward, and celestial beasts came to guard him. The father-king named this child *Double Radiance*, with the style *Heaven’s Eminence*, and reared him in the Cloud-Soaring Palace. Five wet nurses took turns holding and nurturing him, while eight hundred maidens attended him day and night.

At times when he was carried from his bed curtains, the child would see the sky and sun, always laughing upward, his mouth emitting purple radiance that rose to the heavens like a cord, while sweet dew descended in strands straight into his mouth. Jade maidens scattered flowers to brush his body. Divine birds hovered in the air, spreading their wings to shade the sun, while fragrant officials wafted incense to perfume the palace.

By the age of three, *Double Radiance* could speak, his voice carrying a hundred paces, and he delighted in sitting alone, no longer needing to be held. At four, he laughed and conversed in solitude, his words transcending the mundane world. By seven, he knew without learning, his thoughts profound and gaze far-reaching, a light about him illuminating the entire chamber. He sat and stood as steadfast as a mountain, walked with the stride of a dragon, and when lying on his side, his head to the east, his limbs half-extended. His hair was dark blue, his brows emerald; his eyes opened wide at the temples, their light suffused with purple. His mouth was square, his nose rounded, his ears five inches long, with three perfect curves. His teeth were white and even, thirty-six in number, his lips red as cinnabar. His broad forehead was level, his cheekbones high, his philtrum marked by four ridges, twelve *fen* in length. His jade-like nape bore a star-like prominence, his hair neither tangled nor uneven, soft and lustrous. His neck bore three folds, his four nipples aligned with his elbows, his chest broad and slightly arched, his heart’s region deep and full. His arms were round and straight, his hands hanging past his knees, his nails firm and red, perpetually aglow. His palms bore floral patterns, three lines running clearly, their centers purple, his fingers six inches long. His navel was deep and round, with a hidden bone beneath; his cheeks dimpled, his flanks smooth, his abdomen marked by white moles. His shoulder bones were square and straight, his ankles concealed. His insteps were slightly arched, sinews and veins unseen, the soles of his feet full and level, their patterns like sun wheels. His toenails were deeply set, their tips slightly raised. His skin was fine and soft, suffused with fragrance and purity. His bones were blue, his marrow white, his five organs like lotus blossoms. His stomach and intestines were purple, and he ate but half-grains. Whether turning his gaze or shifting his body, he sat and stood with perfect poise.

By nineteen, he stood a full *zhang* in height, his voice resonant as a bell, its tones startling the dust to flight. From afar, a purple void canopy perpetually hovered above his head, and wherever he dwelled, frost and snow never fell. The air was harmonious and mild, winds never raged, and gentle rains fell in due measure. He was warm, benevolent, loyal, and forgiving, enduring insults with compassion and humility. Gazing at the clouds and sky, he discerned the warp and weft of the Dao with clarity.

All arts and skills he mastered without study. His profound communion reached its utmost, foreknowing all that had yet to unfold. The king his father treasured him, gathering his ministers to deliberate the abdication of the throne. Thrice he declined, yet could not refuse. At that moment, the Five Peaks echoed in response, and the void resounded with myriad cries of "Long live the king!" Auspicious omens assembled in full, the unseen and manifest harmonizing as one. With great reluctance, he at last accepted the throne.

He governed the people and served Heaven, propagating the Dao to pacify the world. His governance was upright yet effortless, never taxing the hearts of the people. He esteemed virtue and exalted goodness, so that all followed without command. His benevolence flowed to the orphaned and weak, his kindness extended even to insects. Humans and spirits alike submitted to him, and creatures of every kind lived in harmony.

Each autumn and winter, sweet dew descended from the heavens, and five-colored clouds encircled the sun and moon. City gates stood unbarred, borders required no defense. The Four Seas were as one, and the myriad states united. Auspicious grain and propitious grasses grew with shared roots and separate ears. A single tree bore ten branches, each ripening in its season. Celestial maidens spread across the fields, their radiant silks stretching across the plains, woven into patterns to clothe the people. Salt pools and sweet springs welled forth wherever needed. Glowing lingzhi and night-shining herbs flourished throughout the gardens. Divine birds and wondrous beasts grew tame along the palace walls. Unicorns and phoenixes gathered in flocks, their morning and evening calls harmonizing in song.

At that time, beyond the Black Waters to the north, among the Zang and Di tribes of the snowy highlands—where the river’s source winds slantwise and the sun shines upon the southern face of the Snow Mountains—there dwelt the mixed-herd Rong, a people of cunning nature and untamable disposition. Secretly they hatched a treacherous scheme, and hearing of the king’s virtuous governance, how he ruled without martial might, they mustered their forces and marched upon his kingdom.

No sooner had they reached the eastern slopes of the Snow Mountains than their sheep and horses sickened and died; the Di and Rong fell prey to plague. Ghosts materialized in broad daylight, slaughtering the barbarian hordes until only seven in ten remained. Midway through their march, the survivors repented in terror, falling to their knees in prostration.

The king, though aware of their treacherous intent, refused to strike, allowing them to advance or retreat as they chose. He issued a decree throughout his realm: “The border tribes, ignorant and rebellious, have harbored treachery in their hearts. Heaven has already punished them, and they have turned back of their own accord. No blade need be drawn; let the myriad people of the realm remain untroubled. If I were without the Dao, Heaven would surely cast me down.”

Within three days, word came from the frontier: the invaders had withdrawn. Yet as the tribes retreated, their armies were enveloped in a miasma of death. Heaven had claimed eight in ten of their number; pestilence and plague now raged unchecked. The borderlands trembled in fear, and the people gathered in dread, murmuring among themselves. They offered sacrifices to the spirits and prayed to Heaven, but the calamity only worsened.

Among the barbarian tribes, there was one chieftain who possessed some small understanding of worldly affairs. Addressing his people, he declared: “The lord of this great kingdom aligns his virtue with Heaven. He cultivates the Dao and upholds righteousness, his will unswayed by perversity. Ten thousand blessings sustain him; a hundred spirits guard his realm. How could we, in our folly, muster our forces and defy such supreme goodness? The disasters befalling our lands must surely stem from this. We must swiftly inform the neighboring kings, prepare our tribute, and hasten to offer our apologies.”

Thereupon, one hundred and twenty-five chieftains of the border tribes, along with eighty-four thousand attendants, mounted white elephants and bore offerings of incense, flowers, and jeweled garlands. They galloped into the great kingdom, their breath held as they approached the jade palace. Prostrating themselves before the king, they presented their treasures, their arms trembling, their voices breaking in supplication. Blood streamed from their noses; they tore out their hair in clumps, beating their breasts until their bodies were bruised and swollen. Their cries—half beast, half bird—were unintelligible, and interpreters struggled to convey their remorse.

“We of the borderlands,” they confessed, “do not follow the proper calendar. We are steeped in the turbid qi of the Three Realms, our forms misshapen like the Two Images. We are a mongrel breed, blind to kindness and beauty. Though we draw breath, we are not of the true qi. In our folly, we gave rise to wickedness, our hearts set on rebellion. We allowed our bestial natures to stir, defiling this great kingdom. No sooner had we gathered than Heaven struck us down. Our lands are ravaged by death, eight in ten of our people lost. The poisonous qi has not yet abated, and the calamity grows ever more severe. Those who sought to appease the spirits only invited greater wrath. Heaven has unleashed its fury, and our sacrifices have only worsened our plight. We dare now to beg the Great Heaven for mercy.”

With these words, they cast themselves to the ground, tearing their hair and wailing in despair. The king addressed them: “I have inherited the rule of a virtuous sovereign, entrusted with the governance of all under Heaven. I walk only the path of goodness, seeking nothing beyond. If I do not pity myself, how can I pity you? To me, all beings are as one child; I show no partiality, even to the hidden and obscure. You harbored treachery and came against me, but I remained unaware, leaving your fate to Heaven. I do not condemn you with emotion, nor does Heaven strike you with intent. The punishment you suffer is like spitting at the sky—it falls back upon your own face; like shooting an arrow at the heavens—it returns to pierce your own body. Such is the natural Dao; its principle admits no error.

The incense, flowers, and jeweled garlands you offer are not what I treasure. In this kingdom, we cultivate only virtue and power. As for the grains and silks, the necklaces and ornaments with which your people adorn themselves—these are the trappings of perverse customs, not true valuables. They only burden the body and cling like dust. Why? Because they are mere external adornments, and thus unworthy of esteem. In this kingdom, all people practice forbearance, humility, diligence, and frugality as their adornments. Virtue, precepts, and moral conduct are our incense and flowers; we have no need of your offerings.”

When the barbarian chieftains saw that the king would not accept their tribute, they grew fearful, believing their misfortune would not be dispelled. Weeping, they turned to one another and said: “The king’s refusal to accept our offerings may stem from their meagerness. Let us each present him with a white elephant, that he may show us mercy.”

The king replied: “Jeweled garlands and precious pearls are not what I value; how much less so white elephants, with their foul stench, their ravenous appetites, and their need for vast pastures and herdsmen? They would only burden my kingdom. Even the light and wondrous dragons and phoenixes I do not require.”

The barbarians, overwhelmed with grief and despair, tore out their hair and wailed: “The king will not accept our offerings. We are without fortune and shall surely perish. Better to take our own lives than face this calamity.”

The king instructed them: “Those who seek blessing must serve the Dao with an empty heart. When both body and mind are empty, the Dao too becomes void. Through this emptiness, misfortune is averted. Free from misfortune, one attains blessing. Moreover, those who seek blessing must harbor no desires, no expectations. Your offerings are made with hope, and thus I cannot accept them. In this kingdom, the wise and virtuous adorn themselves with goodness, not with garlands or white elephants.

The king continued: “In this kingdom, we strive only to follow the supreme Great Dao, seeking nothing beyond. You must understand: those who seek blessing must keep their hearts free from perversity, acting with impartiality. They do not chase profit, nor do they shun harm. They do not transform misfortune into blessing, nor do they cling to fortune. Thus they remain free from calamity. Why? Because evil cannot overcome goodness; the inauspicious naturally gives way to the auspicious. Misfortune vanishes of its own accord, and blessing is not something one perceives.

If you seek to avoid misfortune and pursue blessing, you are deluded, unable to grasp the true nature of fortune and misfortune. Your heart turns away from the truth. Why? Because fortune and misfortune share the same gate, rooted in the void.”

Consider carefully: from where does this misfortune arise as retribution? Know the origin of misfortune, and the root of blessing will become clear. Those who seek blessing must first understand misfortune. It is like a skilled physician who, wishing to cure all illnesses, first identifies their source before prescribing medicine. When illness and remedy align, no disease remains uncured.

Yet you, all you tribes, cling to misfortune while seeking blessing, failing to eradicate its root—hoping for blessing to descend is like one who grasps a staff to reconcile with an enemy, or carries water in search of fire. Though you toil for ages, you shall never attain it. The misfortune you face arises within your own being. How then can you seek blessing while destroying your very self? For to destroy the self is not called blessing.

Why do you, tribes of the wilds, willingly destroy yourselves? The body is the root of blessing—how can you destroy it? All who destroy the body are called destroyers of blessing. Moreover, the body is the root of the Dao; those who destroy the body are called destroyers of the Dao, not destroyers of misfortune.

Those who truly eradicate misfortune do not rely on blessing to dispel it; those who seek blessing do not achieve it through misfortune.

At that time, the tribes of the wilds, hearing the Great King’s decree, could not discern its meaning. They requested an interpreter to convey it, then gathered their robes in awe and trepidation. Unable to respond, they knew only to bow in reverence, their hearts filled with deep shame, kneeling uneasily.

Among the Yin tribes, there was a chieftain named Shitoufen, who asked the interpreter to relay his words. He declared himself the king of Jambudvīpa in India and spoke thus: “We are humbled that the Great Heaven has expounded such rare Dharma for our assembly. Yet we, dwellers of the frontier, possess shallow understanding and have not fathomed the ultimate Dao. Misled by distant hearsay, we have long languished in the ford of delusion, not only today but across kalpas. We beseech the Great Heaven to pity our benighted confusion.”

“These wild Hu, ignorant and unknowing, cannot grasp the truth. We implore you to grant us a single word to express our humble intent. We have heard the Great Heaven declare that this land reveres only the Great Dao, the supreme and most perfect. May we hear of it?”

The Great King replied: “The supreme Great Dao is ever subtle in its silence, yet the deaf cannot hear it. The Dao is most profound, yet the blind cannot see it. Though you beings possess eyes, you cannot gaze rightly; though you possess ears, you cannot hear rightly. A riot of colors distracts your clarity; the wails of false sounds stifle your wisdom. Though you have eyes and ears, you differ not from the deaf and blind. For this reason, you cannot hear the Dao.”

“If you wish to hear the Dao, rid yourself of false hearing. If you wish to contemplate the Dao, rid yourself of false thoughts. If you wish to cultivate the Dao, rid yourself of false cultivation. If you wish to practice the Dao, rid yourself of false conduct. To walk the path of right action—compassionate, kind, and yielding—is called the practice of the Dao. Those who walk this path shall naturally hear the Dao; having heard it, they shall also see it; having practiced it, they shall attain equanimity, perceiving all beings as no different from themselves. Their touch gives rise to compassion, and their minds make no distinctions. First establish this sincerity, then you may hear the Dao.”

Then the tribes again inquired: “Great King, what is the essence of the supreme Great Dao’s most wondrous practice? It preserves life in its perfection, ascends into formlessness, endures ceaselessly, and stands beyond all dependence or burden. We humbly beseech your instruction to dispel our confusion.”

The Great King declared: “The supreme Dao takes eternal life as its essence, and this very body as its Dharma-body. It holds compassion and equanimity as paramount, patience and gentleness as its function, expedient means and beneficence as its benefit, non-action and emptiness as its tranquility, wisdom and unimpeded insight as its penetration, the Dao-eye’s illumination as its attainment, vastness and receptivity as its emptiness, the form’s submission to the spirit as its formlessness, spontaneity as its naturalness, and formlessness as its eternal life.”

Upon hearing the Great King’s words, the tribes all exclaimed: “Never have we heard such! Though our minds are dull and our understanding dim, we have not fully grasped it and remain in doubt.”

Then the Great King resolved the doubts of the frontier tribes, opening their hearts and enlightening their minds. On the eighth day of the eighth month, he invited Master Hanlin for the tribes, summoning all ordained Daoists within the realm to assemble with full ceremonial dignity. For seven days and nights, they performed purification rites and repented of transgressions for the frontier peoples.

He also returned the precious offerings and jeweled garlands they had presented. The tribes said: “We dare not disobey your decree and must accept them.” Having received them, they then offered them to Master Hanlin. The Master accepted and divided the garlands into two portions: one for the poor and lowly attendants among the assembly, and the other for the tribes. The white elephant was returned to the tribes, and they adorned it with the garlands.

At that moment, twenty-four thousand great elephants, wearing the garlands, knelt as one before Master Hanlin. The elephants then scattered, plucking flowers with their trunks and offering them to the Master. The lowly attendants who wore the garlands felt shame arise in their hearts and sighed, saying: “The Master regards all things with impartiality, bestowing the treasure of jeweled garlands upon the people of the world and the white elephants alike.” They bowed their heads in gratitude.

Master Hanlin said: “The supreme treasure of the Great Dao transforms the mundane into the sacred, yet it bestows its blessings upon all beings with impartiality, without claiming merit. These garlands are mere external adornments, worldly embellishments for the body—what are they compared to the dust and blemishes of defilement? You, dwellers of distant lands, do not understand the offering of the heart. You presented these to me, and I accepted them, only to return them to you. Why do you thank me? Simply accept them without doubt.”

On the fifteenth day of the month at noon, the Master and ninety-seven thousand Daoist practitioners partook of their meal together. Afterward, he rinsed his mouth with a jeweled flask, and the remaining water, scattered toward the south, west, and north, instantly transformed into clouds and rain, accompanied by wind, thunder, and lightning. The Master then exhaled toward the three directions, and golden light issued from his mouth, illuminating distant lands. At that moment, those among the border tribes afflicted with illness were instantly cured, and all saw the Master from afar within the light as if he stood before them. The wind and rain cleansed their filth, the thunder’s voice proclaimed their transgressions, and every disaster and misfortune vanished in an instant. He also allowed eighty-four thousand barbarian warriors to see their families within the light.

By the twentieth day, the tribal chieftains each dispatched envoys to hasten into the great kingdom, reporting peace and recounting the auspicious signs they had witnessed as before. Then, the tribesmen, their hair unbound, prostrated themselves in repentance, rejoicing before the Way. They knelt, pressing their heads to the ground, and asked the Master: “We do not know what method the Great Master cultivates. How is it that your divine transformations are so boundless and unobstructed? Are you only called ‘Great Master,’ or do you bear other titles? We have heard the king’s decree that the great kingdom reveres the Great Dao. Is the Dao you practice the same as or different from the Supreme Great Dao? We are ignorant and do not understand. We only hope the Great Master will broadly distinguish and enlighten us on what we have not yet heard.”

At that time, the Master snapped his fingers and coughed lightly, then addressed the assembled tribesmen: “Excellent, excellent! You dwell in remote lands, yet you pity and inquire with such wisdom—this is inconceivable. Listen carefully, and I will explain to you. I am the Supreme Perfected One of the Eastern Terrace of the Cloud Palace in the Jade Clarity Heaven, naturally and emptily born, named the Supreme Dao. I cultivate nothing, yet through great compassion and great mercy, I manifest divine transformations in response to the world, accomplishing them as my heart wills. Without intention, I act, and my body is not wearied. The king and I appeared in the world at the same time to govern the multitudes and kings, temporarily dwelling in mortal form. I provisionally bear the title of Master, residing in Hanlin. We serve as guest and host, subtly influencing one another, neither identical nor different, neither residing in the middle. You, the various tribes, are born into the Desire Realm, assuming the form of border barbarians. Your hearts lack compassion, dwelling in desolation and depravity. By nature, you harm and do not cherish life. You drink blood and consume raw flesh, your bodies restless and foul, your spirits congealed with turbid qi, your forms bound by partial essence. You uproot the fundamental and obstruct the source, suppressing the root while exalting the branches. You value wealth and goods but do not treasure the Great Dao. This has been so for kalpas, not merely in this age. The Great Dao has not been practiced for a long time. Yet though you are thus, all things turn in cycles: sin becomes the root of virtue, and evil is the source of compassion. If you had not harbored rebellious hearts, you would never have seen me. The Great Dao is impartial, making no distinction between foe and kin. It repays enmity with virtue and does not abandon great compassion. Thus, the king invited me and my assembly of practitioners to repent on your behalf and dispel your disasters. With a heart of impartial compassion and no differing thoughts, I caused clouds and rain to scatter and light and sound to universally reach you.”

At that time, the Great Emperor of the kingdom, along with the Great Consort, the prince, and the assembled ministers, had not initially known that the Master of Hanlin and the king were both incarnations of the same divine Master. When he first arrived, the people of the kingdom, great and small, all believed the Master to be an ordinary man. Later, witnessing the Master’s divine transformations at will, the entire kingdom took refuge in him. Filled with remorse, they reproached themselves, and regardless of wealth or poverty, they prepared offerings. The land’s treasures gathered in the eastern city, filling the Terrace of Fragrant Spring. A grand vegetarian feast was held, and the kingdom’s men and women thronged the roads, their carriages stirring dust like mist. Then, the king had a high seat prepared, exhausting the kingdom’s treasures to adorn the ritual arena. He opened the great treasury, bestowing grain and silk to aid the destitute. Exquisite incense was burned, its smoke rising to the heavens, forming canopies of condensed clouds. Music and entertainment resounded, startling the sky and deafening the earth. The Five Peaks trembled, and the Four Seas surged. Cool winds harmonized the seasons, and the radiant springtime warmth returned. Forests bloomed anew, orioles sang again, birds soared and danced, fish and dragons leapt, and the kingdom was blessed with auspicious qi from heaven and earth.

The assembly rejoiced immeasurably, circumambulating in procession, their songs and praises overflowing. The practitioners chanted the *Step of Emptiness*, their Sanskrit hymns resounding in praise. Then, the Master ascended the seat, resting his hand upon the armrest, his presence as steadfast as a mountain. His heart was filled with a thousand virtues, his body formed of ten thousand blessings. The assembly gazed upon him with joy, beholding his true form. All awakened the heart of the Dao, their voices united as one, their hundred minds in harmony. They paid homage to the Lord of the Dao, wishing to hear the rare and wondrous.

Then, for the sake of all beings, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao commanded the king, Chongguang, to take three pinches of incense, bow from afar to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion in the Cloud Palace, and kneel to make vows. The first vow: may the transformative power of the Dao spread, and may all under heaven embrace virtue. The second: may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao. The third: may the sorrowful souls of the nine nights all be liberated. The fourth: may the lonely and unsupported all receive rebirth. The fifth: may the world be at peace and the hundred grains ripen. The sixth: may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind. The seventh: may the Four Seas be united, and foes and kin reconciled. The eighth: may those concealed in wombs and shells all be born and grow. The ninth: may chronic and new illnesses be instantly cured. The tenth: may the destitute and exposed all have ample clothing and food.

Then, the king presented these ten vows, rose to bow to the Master, and spoke: “We only hope the Great Master will remain among the people for a long time, descending in form to dwell among mortals, not abandoning the dust and filth.” After the king spoke these words, heaven and earth were moved. Flowers rained from the void, sweet dew descended from the sky, and myriad celestial musics resounded, startling the firmament. Heaven and earth trembled, unicorns hummed and phoenixes sang, dragons and fish stirred the depths.

At that moment, the Dao Lord’s countenance radiated with penetrating true light, vast and boundless, its numinous sound resonating afar, harmonizing and transforming all beings. The drowned in death received new life; withered forests burst into bloom. Sentient and insentient alike held their essence and blossomed. Though the Dao spoke not, all dharmas were already complete. This assembly was filled with awe, arising naturally, of itself—even I know not how it came to be.

Then, the various barbarians gazed upward, forgetting to blink, losing their forms, motionless as withered trees. In but a moment, the Cloud Palace Heavenly Worthy descended in response, accompanied by nine hundred million high perfected ones, alighting upon the azure clouds above. A canopy of auspicious mist coalesced, spanning ten thousand leagues. Its expanse stretched level as the earth in all four directions, where the perfected ones arrayed themselves at its edges. At the center of the auspicious mist stood a seat of purple radiance, borne by intertwining five-colored cloud-dragons. The seat rose eighty-four thousand nine hundred and nine *ren* in height. The Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion ascended and sat upon it, gradually descending through the mystery until seven hundred and eight *ren* above the earth, directly over the eastern city, profound and empty, serene and unmoving. Only the crimson glow above the luminous mist was visible, its vermilion hue blending indistinctly. As all eyes looked up, they suddenly beheld the Heavenly Perfected One’s emanation body ascend and enter the clouds, returning to the seat it had occupied before. Then, two true ones appeared, their countenances identical. For a long while, the two assemblies fell silent, without sound or movement, their true forms still as golden mountains. Their radiance shone brilliantly, its bounds unfathomable.

Within the great assembly, humans and non-humans alike sat motionless, their minds free from weariness or aversion. Joyfully they gazed upward, delighting in the vision of the true form, their hearts fixed in single-pointed devotion, forgetting even their own bodies. For nine days and nine nights, they remained without hunger or thirst, their bodies and minds unmoving.

Then, the barbarians beheld once more the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion upon the floating clouds, attended by his majestic retinue. Overcome with terror, they tore out their hair in remorse, blaming themselves, slashing their noses with blades until their bodies ran with blood. They leapt and flung themselves down as if mountains had collapsed. Witnessing this rarity, they cried out, vowing to offer their eyes, their heads, to burn their bodies, to break their bones as offerings, their voices reaching the king. The king then issued a decree, addressing the barbarians:

“The supreme Dao and its dharma cherish life and abhor killing. Do not defile our great realm with your crude and barbaric ways. To burn your bodies in atonement is to invite ruin—your souls will suffer harm, forever losing the human path. To burn the body in pursuit of the Dao is to seek the Dao through annihilation; to annihilate the body in pursuit of the Dao is to mistake the Dao for a path of destruction. How can one seek the Dao through self-destruction?

You barbarians have entered our great land, yet remain untouched by its refinement. How then can you hope to hear the supreme Dao? If you wish to hear the Dao, preserve the root of hearing—do not seek the Dao through the ear. If you wish to see the Dao, preserve the root of sight—do not seek the Dao through a ruined eye. If you wish to practice the Dao, you must preserve life—do not practice the Dao through death. If you wish to practice the Dao, first preserve your body—do not practice the Dao through a broken or defiled form. If you wish to embrace the Dao, first abandon the ten evils—do not practice the Dao with a heart of the five inversions.

You must now understand: those whose lives are not whole cannot hear the Dao; those whose bodies are not whole cannot study the Dao. Though you barbarians are not vessels of the dharma, having beheld the Heavenly Worthy, after ten thousand kalpas you will inherit this merit. You will be reborn in a great land, a realm of the Dao. If you can vow thus, you will never again be reborn in wild and uncivilized lands. From this day forward, preserve your forms. Do not tear your hair, burn your bodies, or break your bones—such acts defy heaven and earth, lack compassion and obedience, and lead to rebirth in evil paths, forever barring you from the Dao.”

Then, all the barbarians knelt and bowed, answering the king: “In our customs, to maim the body or destroy life, to burn the body to ashes or crush the bones, letting the smoke rise—this we call ascending to heaven. Or to cast the corpse into deep waters—this we call becoming a water immortal. Or to abandon the corpse in the wilds, to be devoured by birds and beasts.”

The barbarians do not value the deliverance of their living bodies, finding long life a burden. The king declared: “You Rong and Di regard longevity as toil and your own flesh as encumbrance. In this great kingdom’s law, birth and death are the true burden. Thus we seek the Dao of eternal existence without birth, ascending into formlessness, free from affliction. We do not maim the body or destroy life to escape toil—yet without such acts, toil vanishes of itself.

You barbarians cling to perverse minds, following heterodox ways. You do not abandon the ten evils, delighting in the cycle of birth and death, nor dispel the three poisons. Your forms are human, but your hearts are those of beasts—unworthy to behold the Dao. Do not defile my great land with your barbarian customs.”

Then, the barbarians bowed in apology, vowing never again to tear their hair, burn their bodies, or break their bones. They said: “We did not comprehend the supreme Dao and rashly spoke false words, offending the upright. We believed life must end in death, so we sought extinction. We did not know the boundless, supreme Dao grants eternal life, ascending into formlessness, free from all burdens. We beg your compassion and grant us renewal.”

The king then admonished the barbarians: “Your wild natures are dull and ignorant. Unaware of virtue and the Dao, you brought this calamity upon yourselves, inviting punishment. Now you come to repent. The Dao is merciful, pitying your ignorance. The True Master of Hanlin bestows upon you blessed fortune; the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy pities your foolish stubbornness. The Supreme Great Sage has come to our land. Ten thousand souls fall silent, their hearts fixed upon the mystery, devoted to the Great Dao. Yet you barbarians rashly voice shallow views, unable to remain still, disturbing the assembly, disrupting others and yourselves, forfeiting wisdom and benefit. Remain silent. Though you do not understand the law, your souls will gradually be nourished.”

The barbarians obeyed the king’s command, kneeling in silence without movement for seven days and nights. At dusk on the seventh day, suddenly three great heavenly demons from the south, west, and north flew from the earthly bureaus through the sky. They bowed to the True Lord, prostrated before the king, then turned to rebuke the barbarians, their eyes blazing with fury, teeth gritted, and spoke harshly:

“In the king’s land of the Dao, people are free from the three poisons, long removed from the ten evils. They uphold righteousness, cultivate benevolence, honor the Dao, and revere virtue. The kingdom has no treacherous ministers; households have no rebellious sons. Yet you mad barbarians bring these sinful ghosts and walking corpses to defile the royal land, seeking repentance and blessings, hoping to hear the Dao? Heaven’s statutes and earth’s laws allow no pardon for the ten evils. To rebel against one’s lord and father—no crime is greater! You deserve to be ground to bone-ash, your sinews torn and blood spilled, your five viscera carved out, your gall and heart exposed, your tongue ripped out—still insufficient to atone for your wicked words. Your eyes gouged out—still insufficient to repay your evil gaze. Your homeland will suffer disaster; your descendants will perish. One traitor brings ruin to ten thousand people.”

At these words, the barbarians’ hair stood on end in terror. Their sorrow and dread were so great their livers and gall seemed to split, their bodies convulsed, sweat poured like rain, their breath came in gasps, their mouths clamped shut, and their five spirits scattered in panic. The earthly officials presented their records to the king.

The king addressed the demons: “The supreme Dao makes no distinction between foe and kin. They cannot harm me—why would you attack them? Even if they could harm me, I would not retaliate.”

The king asked the demons: “Suppose an infant, holding tiles, wood, awls, or knives, wounded its parents—would you kill it?”

The demon kings replied: “No.”

The king said: “I am the same. I would rather suffer harm than ever intentionally injure a living being. How much less these mad barbarians, whose wisdom is shallower than an infant’s, who cannot harm me? If heaven strikes them, inflicting cruel suffering, my heart aches with pity.”

Hearing the king’s words, the heavenly demons snapped their fingers in unison, exclaiming: “This is unprecedented!” They looked at one another and said: “The sage-king of this great land is vast in heart and kindness. His great compassion extends even to you. His virtue equals creation itself. Though he is but a temporary king, he already possesses all the marks of perfection. His body is founded on ten thousand virtues; a thousand blessings shape his heart. Soon he will bear the title Heavenly Worthy. We have come to this assembly, which will not last long. He will surely deliver many. The Great Dao is rare to encounter; the wondrous law is rare to hear. We beseech the great king to remain.”

The king, understanding their intent, replied: “The Great Dao is vast and boundless, like empty space without obstruction. In this assembly, the Dao is the law. The law makes no distinctions, knows no arising or ceasing, no seeing or hearing, no inside or outside, nor any middle ground. The law transcends birth and death. In this assembly, all is pure and undivided, united in the single law of compassion. You demons who wish to remain must abide by this law.”

Hearing the king’s words, the demons stood in solemn reverence. They returned to stand among the barbarians for three days and nights. At dawn on the third day, they saw from the land of Jianmu sixty-eight thousand immortals and Daoist masters, each shaded by flying canopies, holding flowered banners, passing over the dragon palace. Each bore luminous moon pearls and purple jade灵芝, flying through the sky to offer them to the Heavenly Perfected. Behind them came eighty-one kings of island barbarians, each wearing robes of five-colored phoenix patterns, accompanied by eight thousand attendants. These kings brought divine medicines and rare incense, arriving together to present them to the great king: the seven luminous tiger foams, dragon embryo śarīra, golden radiance blazing brilliantly, illuminating the sky.

These śarīra were transformed from eight kinds of frost-like jade. If the king consumes them, his body will take on a golden hue and jade-like complexion. The seven luminous tiger foams and dragon embryo elixirs—if the king consumes them, he will instantly gain the power of flight, performing a thousand transformations, shaping all things at will.

In my past cultivation of the Dao, I studied under Master Changsang Daojun, who bestowed upon me divine medicines. By consuming them, I attained immortality. Later, I received the essential teachings of the Dao and descended to govern the Nine Barbarian Lands. I heard that you have descended into the world to bring joy to all beings. Furthermore, I learned that the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy has manifested in response, while the Left Terrace Perfected Ones have taken refuge in the Cold Forest. Drawn by this karmic convergence, the resounding echoes of rare harmony shook the eight directions, and all heard it; the empty radiance pierced the void, illuminating the ten quarters. Thus, I have come here to pay my respects.

At that moment, after the eighty-one immortals spoke these words, they ascended into the sky, rising a hundred *ren* above the earth. They bowed in reverence to the Heavenly Worthy and remained suspended in the air.

Then, from the eastern lands, a ghostly general named Lightning Boar appeared. His form stood three *zhang* tall, with jagged teeth and chiseled fangs, a copper head and iron bristles, a hooked tongue and fiery breath. His eyes blazed like shooting stars, his face was black, his body crimson, his teeth like those of a goshawk, and his hooves like those of a horse. His voice thundered like a struck drum, and his exhalations formed clouds. Leading a retinue of over six hundred million ghosts, he had heard from afar that a Perfected One had descended to become king, governing the realm with the Dao, never oppressing living beings. Wishing to guard the borders and assist the great king, they all rode black clouds and arrived floating through the air. Prostrating before the king, they spoke:

"Your servant is the king of the ghostly realms, commanding wandering spirits. Any demons or malevolent beings who refuse to submit, I devour at will, holding life and death in my grasp. From afar, I have heard that the people of your kingdom are kind and virtuous. Thus, I lead my followers to purify your land and humbly offer to serve as its guardians. Wherever great sages and immortals reside, I shall attend them, serving morning and night. At places of fasting and scripture recitation, I shall lead my followers to provide external protection. If any heretics or evil persons slander the true Dao or harm the community of the faithful, I shall destroy them, afflicting them with grave illnesses, causing their hair to fall out and inflicting them with severe maladies. If any beings within the sacred precincts behave improperly—casting sidelong glances or harboring impure thoughts—I shall punish them, causing these wicked ones to suffer bodily afflictions in life and descend into hell upon death, their sins extending to seven generations of ancestors. But if any beings are kind and filial, reciting scriptures and precepts, making offerings to the great Dao, and holding the Dao in their hearts, I shall draw near to them, constantly guarding and protecting them, ensuring no evil ghosts gain advantage over them. I only beseech the great king to permit my followers to safeguard the sacred precincts."

The king replied, "Excellent, excellent! I regard all beings as my own children. To you, I extend the same impartial heart. Though the seen and unseen differ, I grant your wish to join in virtuous recognition."

At that moment, the ghosts rejoiced, receiving the king’s words with gratitude. They encircled the Fragrant Spring Terrace east of the city, bowing in reverence to the Perfected One before prostrating and remaining in place.

Then, over sixty thousand fire-wreathed, murderous ghosts appeared. Each stood three *zhang* tall, their heads radiating light like scattered fireflies. Their bodies were entirely black, their eyes red as flames, and they wielded iron rods. Their breath scorched those it touched, causing them to collapse to the ground, their hair standing on end, their bodies wracked with cold, their senses reeling, and blood flowing from their noses and mouths. Having heard that the king governed with the Dao, never harming living beings, they wished to assist in subduing the wicked and rebellious. Riding black winds, they arrived from the north, kneeling before the king and speaking:

"We have heard that the king governs with the Dao, his benevolence vast and far-reaching, showering all—seen and unseen—with grace. Thus, we lead our followers, wishing to serve, bring peace to the kingdom, and protect the virtuous. At any gathering of the Dao, we shall provide external protection, crushing malevolent demons and rectifying deviant paths. If any beings desecrate the sacred precincts, secretly harboring malice, casting wicked glances at the faithful, we shall strike them dead with our iron rods, tear out their tongues, or cause their eyebrows and hair to fall out. If any beings enter the sacred precincts with defiled bodies or arrogant disdain, we shall afflict them with leprosy, various calamities, and unrest wherever they go, naturally filling them with terror."

The king then addressed the murderous ghosts: "Your radiance and venom are too fierce to approach people. Though you possess mighty spiritual power, do not harm the innocent. Instead, cherish all beings, support the virtuous, and wish to hear the Dao’s teachings, so that they may swiftly transform and attain the supreme Dao."

The murderous ghosts received the decree and remained in joyful compliance.

At that moment, eighty-five thousand Vajra deities descended from the sky. Each stood sixteen feet tall, their strength and valor unmatched, their divine power surpassing all but the gods of the path. They arrived in a sudden rush, their origin unknown. They served as guardians of the great Dao, first bowing to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion above, then to the Perfected One, greeting the king as if they were old acquaintances. They spoke:

"As a true immortal descends into the world, the Dao’s transformation nurtures all life. Inner and outer realms align, humans and spirits converge in harmony, and all nations gather, their borderlands submitting as one. Yet purity and impurity mingle, truth and falsehood blur. The great sage, in boundless magnanimity, does not distinguish between the wise and the foolish. This assembly’s karmic cause is neither trivial nor small. It is deeply fitting to enforce strict discipline to eradicate falsehood. I only beseech the true king to heed my counsel: rectify the sacred precincts, bestow blessings upon the virtuous, transform and eradicate the malevolent, so that both humans and non-humans alike revere the true Dao."

The king silently assented.

Then, amidst the great assembly, the Vajra deities closed their eyes and leapt once, ascending into the azure clouds. They surged forward, shaking the earth and splitting stones, whipping up winds and scattering dust until the sun was obscured. Their glaring eyes flashed like lightning, their gnashing teeth rumbled like thunder. With a single roar, they subdued a thousand spirits, driving away any who dared resist. Rolling up their sleeves and flexing their arms, they raised their voices in a mighty cry, causing heretics to lose their essence and ghosts to faint in terror.

At that moment, the Vajra deities glanced around and declared: "We are the Dharma-protecting Vajra deities, attendants of the great Dao, servants of the Heavenly Perfected. We shadow the sacred precincts, uphold the virtuous, expose sins and transgressions, and ferret out deceit and evil."

Let no being dare offend the might of these divine spirits. Minor transgressions shall bring bloodshed; grave offenses, annihilation of form. Maintain discipline within and without, and let no laxity arise.

Then, all in the assembly—men and women, young and old—rose in reverence, bowing to the Vajra deities before resuming their seats. At that moment, the Vajra, for the sake of protecting the Dharma, subdued the minds of both the seen and unseen multitudes, and spoke this incantation:

"Thunder and fire illuminate the void; divine radiance brightens the hidden.
Four venomous dragons encircle; eight spirit-tigers surround.
The headband bears the Seven Stars; the feet tread upon Dipper and Ox.
Celestial power arrays the constellations; golden hooks gleam with essence.
The primal sovereign commands the mighty host, striding through the empty sky.
At the center, demons and heretics are severed; below, wandering spirits are extinguished.
Livers are torn out, gallbladders drawn forth; intestines are overturned, veins ripped away.
Left they are slain, right they are crushed; before they are boiled, behind they are beheaded.
Demons are cut off without origin; grievances are gathered and bound.
Ghost-devouring messengers shatter and swallow them whole.
Sorcerers and shamans with their drums and songs, drinking blood and eating flesh—
their forms reek of stench, their bones of foulness; goblins and specters are overthrown.
Rank and filthy, base and restless, their hearts and forms full of deceit and slander—
the divine pestle smashes their skulls; the golden blade slits their bellies.
Those who conceal malice and harm are suddenly subdued.
In the left hand, the golden talisman; in the right, the ledger of sins.
The Great One’s golden bell, the Jade Stave of the Heavenly Sovereign.
Those who know their faults yet do not amend shall have their heads suspended and severed.
What demon shall not perish? What spirit shall not be destroyed?
The Six Spirits shall not hide; the Seven Stars shall split with blood.
Above stands the Perfected Master; below, the Vajra deities.
Together they descend with qi, their mouths emitting divine rays.
They drink from the Moon Pool, bathe in the Mystic Frost.
The five viscera bloom with flowers, enduring forever, never withering."

Then, the Great Ghost-King, his four eyes flashing like lightning, joined in protecting the Dharma, dispelling all misfortune. Guarding the sacred precincts, he examined for deceit and corrected transgressions, subduing evil men, heretics, and all those lacking true faith. He spoke this incantation:

"Divine winds sweep away dust, uprooting the roots of evil.
The Six Heavens lose their essence; the Five Poisons dispel their grudges.
Golden heads and iron teeth devour ghosts and halt souls.
They pierce the radiant door, twin lights illuminating the gate.
Shooting stars carry killing qi, resplendent and fearless.
A hundred meridians flow like rivers; the seven channels are harmonized.
Spirits are at peace, bodies balanced—ever abiding, never dying."

When the Great Ghost-King finished reciting this incantation, he bowed from afar to the heavens above, then prostrated before the Perfected Lord, and addressed the ghosts: "You are the guardians of the Dao, protectors of the virtuous. Those who expound the Dharma differ not from the Dao. You must not oppose the true and upright qi. Capture and report any who do—eternal damnation awaits."

Then, the Great Ghost-King spoke to all in the Dharma assembly: "I am the Heavenly Emperor’s servant, bound to the Dao in duty. I support the newly initiated, all men and women entering the Dao’s first gate. I quell wayward thoughts—you must not cast sidelong glances or heed those who violate the precepts. In vigilance and protection, both the living and the dead shall be examined. Not only do I slay ghosts, but I also subdue the violent, quell wayward hearts, and regulate the living. Those lacking true faith, upon hearing this divine incantation, should rise in reverence. This incantation is the Heavenly Emperor’s mighty decree, the scripture of the natural order. The demon kings of all heavens, the ghost-generals of the five directions, the Perfected Officials and earthly administrators—all assist the Dao’s flourishing transformation, guarding households and nations, pacifying sacred precincts, and protecting the virtuous. All recite this mighty decree to subdue the impure, behead the malevolent, and shatter the blades of evil. Heretics and wicked men lose their essence and qi; venomous specters and goblins, hearing it from afar, bow in awe. Wherever there are Dharma assemblies, fasting lectures, sacred precincts, or lay dwellings, my followers and I shall ever observe them, fasting and maintaining the precepts as prescribed. When sincerity guides the act, the great Dao descends, and blessings swiftly arrive. But those whose hearts are divided, who act for profit or fame, who fast only when compelled—we shall not guard them, nor shall the great Dao descend. Goblins, wandering spirits, venomous ghosts, and lesser demons shall attend their offerings. Those who slight the Dao and scorn the Dharma shall be investigated by the Three Offices. The Dao does not act in vain; it responds only to sincere hearts, not to barter or trade. Disciples of the Dao, take heed."

When the Ghost-General finished speaking, he stepped back and stood motionless, solemn and still.

Then, the Great King’s chariot journeyed to the Western Regions to welcome and escort his parents. The hundred ministers and nobles all held floral banners and played music, their grand procession resplendent in majesty. They welcomed his parents and returned to the Fragrant Spring Terrace, where they burned incense and bowed their heads. The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy next paid homage to the Perfected Master, inquiring after the Dharma assembly with joy and solicitude. The Heavenly Emperor was aged, and his consort likewise frail. The Great King, filial and devoted, watched their countenances with a heart ever torn between joy and fear.

Then, the Perfected Master bade them sit once more and addressed the Heavenly Emperor: "You and your son are noble friends in the Dao. You are the essence of the Purple Tenuity, incarnated in mortal form to rule as emperor by the mandate of heaven. The Great King Chongguang is an Upper Perfected of the Jade Clarity, born into your lineage. Though he reigns as a worldly emperor, his form does not age—all is the natural, supreme Dharma-body."

Then, the Perfected Master spoke to the Great King: "The immortals of the Nine Barbarians have bestowed upon you divine medicine to reverse aging. Bid your parents face east and take it with cinnabar water."

At that moment, Chongguang opened his treasure casket, took the medicine and water, and offered them to his parents. They received it, knelt facing east, and consumed it. The Great King took eighty cups, dividing them into three portions: one offered to the Perfected Master, who declined; the others given to his parents, who drank the cinnabar water. After seven days, their faces bore the luster of gold and jade, their steps light as flight. Their feet barely touched the ground, yet their bodies seemed to restrain themselves, yielding to their forms, and they rose into the air. They then received from the Perfected Master the sacred scripture of cloud-seal characters, the *Harmonizing the Spirits and Preserving Life* in thirty-six thousand words, which they recited morning and night. The five qi floated above their crowns; their eyes shone with radiant light. Their spirits were clear and serene, their bearing majestic and refined. Their voices carried with fragrance, piercing and pure; purple qi connected to the heavens. Their countenances reverted to youth, their white hair turned black. They moved between existence and non-existence.

Between their advances and retreats, they joined the assembly in joy, offering obeisance to the king. Gazing upward, they saw the azure vault suddenly transform into a radiance of blue light, illuminating the east. After a long while, it shifted into red light, illuminating the south. Again, after a long while, it turned to white light, illuminating the west. Once more, after a long while, it became black light, illuminating the north. And yet again, after a long while, it turned to yellow light, illuminating the center. Within each of the five colored lights resounded a tone, harmonizing and flowing in transformation, ethereal and pure, elegant and refined. The five lights stretched across the clouds like a celestial rainbow, luminous and penetrating.

In an instant, the Perfected Master at the assembly once more emitted from between his brows four hues of radiant light, responding to the heavens above—what are called the Light of Compassion, the Light of Mercy, the Light of Goodness, and the Light of Faith. At that moment, the entire assembly, gazing upon the true light, forgot their weariness in body and mind. They then heard within the eight-colored radiance the music of the natural realm, their minds awakening as if they had tasted sweet dew.

At that time, over eighty thousand of the Rong tribesmen, having witnessed this light, were struck blind and their hearts bewildered, as though deeply intoxicated. Their six senses sealed, they collapsed senseless. Then, a great minister of the kingdom named Shouzheng, seeing the barbarians fallen and insensate, stepped forward and addressed the Perfected Master, saying: "By our accumulated fortune, we were born in an age of the Dao and have been blessed to behold the Perfected Master, to witness the majesty of the Dao, our minds opened and our thoughts awakened, our ears and eyes made keen. Our hearts pour forth into the mysterious, joyful and tireless. Yet we do not understand why these tribesmen lie fallen, their six senses sealed, their spirits as though stupefied by drink."

"What sins have their bodies borne to fall thus into confusion and lose their will? We only pray that the Perfected Master reveal what we have not heard, that all may awaken and understand the causes and karmic conditions."

The Perfected Master replied: "Great indeed are the deep-rooted karmic bonds of their unwholesome deeds. Listen carefully, and I shall explain.

"Good man, you must now understand: these Rong and Di tribesmen first harbored rebellious hearts, gathering treachery and peril. Heaven loosed its poison upon them, and the underworld’s ghosts assailed them. All their valiant warriors were annihilated at once. Their lands lay desolate, nine-tenths lost. Then plague struck, bringing suffering and pestilence. Their sheep and horses perished, and the tribesmen, starving and freezing, died in numbers beyond count.

"These Hu ghosts all appealed to the Heavenly Emperor, lodging grievances against their lords. Their vengeful spirits seized them, their evil karma unforgotten. Though these Rong and Di tribesmen later repented their sins, never imagining they would encounter the Dao, even in this secondary birth, their death-qi remained unresolved. Their bodily spirits were bound, their forms hollow, their souls absent. For this reason, they lie fallen, lost in stupor, sunk in deep slumber—thus the work of evil.

When the Perfected Master finished speaking, the assembly turned as one to gaze upon the tribesmen. Suddenly, they saw black qi rising from the earth, leveling at a height of ten feet, shrouding the tribesmen. Its color was like pooled ink, dark and indistinct. From within the black qi came the wails of vengeful spirits, some loud, some faint, their cries mournful and choked.

In their sleep, the Rong and Di tribesmen saw their own kin, facing them in sorrow. They beat their eyes shut, their bodies streaming blood, howling and roaring, their shrieks like the cries of wild boars—terrifying to hear. The entire assembly grieved, snapping their fingers and weeping.

The Perfected Master declared: "The karma of good and evil follows one through life and death, like shadow clinging to form, never parting even for a moment. Though the Dao pities them, what can be done?

"This black qi is called yin-qi, also known as killing-qi, resentment-qi, corpse-qi, or turbid-qi. It is the qi of Kun-Mother Earth. Heaven rained black ash upon the tribesmen’s bodies, their hair curling, their forms filthy and greasy."

Then the Perfected One stooped and snapped his fingers. The great earth trembled. In an instant, from the auspicious clouds above, a fine sweet rain descended, bathing the Hu tribesmen. A fragrant wind flowed down, perfuming them. For six days and nights, their eyes could not open. After twelve days, the black qi began to dissipate.

The tribesmen’s bodies were all emaciated, their complexions gone. Boiling blood flowed from their noses, tears streamed from their eyes. Corpse-qi clung to their bodies, their forms blackened through. Their minds and eyes were dim, their sight and hearing unclear. They trembled and faltered, as if mad, each seeing in their eyes their enemies, along with various beasts and ghosts brandishing blades and driving them forth.

The tribesmen raised their hands to grasp at emptiness, scattering in all directions, fleeing beyond the city walls. The elephants they had once ridden, seeing them, bolted in terror, hiding in the grassy marshes, nowhere to be found.

The Rong and Di tribesmen, confronted by their karmic adversaries, lost their eyebrows and hair, blood flowing from their seven orifices. Worms and sores ate into their bones. They forgot their original minds, their good and evil karma responding like echo to sound, like valleys to voices—devoid of feeling, answering only to what was called.

All good and evil is thus, unchanging.

Then the great king, moved by their plight, emerged in distress and prostrated himself before the Dao. The Mystic Master gathered the vengeful spirits of the tribesmen and expounded the Dharma to liberate them.

At that time, the Mystic Master rose from his seat, thrice pinched incense, and bowed from afar to the Jade Pure Heavenly Worthy above. Having completed his obeisance, he returned to his seat. In an instant, his form multiplied into ten thousand millions, gathering the Rong ghosts and bringing them into the assembly. He taught them the foremost meaning of the Three Treasures: that compassion and forbearance lead all practices, the greatest of all virtues. All beings, seen or unseen, who depart from this will long fall into evil destinies, never hearing the Dharma.

He further expounded the Dharma of liberation from birth and death, of non-inversion and non-attachment. Again, he revealed the true mark of reality—emptiness, with nothing substantial. Discriminating thoughts create the illusion of enemies and kin. When the true mark is empty, enemies and kin are also empty.

Then the Perfected Master poured forth a great deluge of mysterious rain, bathing the multitude of ghosts. Next, he taught them the supreme Daoist Dharma: the One Dao, the One Dharma, the One Power of Compassion, the One Rebirth, forever unchanging. The Dharma transforms the Dharma, forever free from birth and death. Without birth and death, there are no karmic adversaries.

"All the fetters and attachments of the law plunge one into the bottomless river of birth and death, tossed by the winds of karma, its waves ceaseless. Departing from this shore of the Dharma, one sinks forever in the mire.

"You ghosts, if you wish to escape birth and death, you must relinquish great enmity and always practice single-minded compassion. Even if others harm or diminish you, receive it as emptiness, never repaying them with an evil heart. This is called relinquishing great enmity. If you relinquish great enmity, you will distance yourself from the enmity of birth and death. When the great matter is settled, nothing remains. No terror can shake you. Your roots will be deep, your stems firm, unshaken by the winds of karma.

"Like a great being who does not begrudge wealth, swiftly repaying debts, refusing to accept what is owed, cutting off and expelling all vengeful creditors—seek the treasure of the Dao, become a patron of the Dharma, not begrudging the filthy wealth of ignorance."

When the multitude of ghosts heard the Mystic Master’s subtle and wondrous Dharma, they abandoned their original minds, leaping for joy, all arousing the mind of forbearance and the supreme Dao. The Supreme Perfected Emperor of the Upper Primordial, his heart opened, radiated a flood of compassionate light, illuminating the multitude of ghosts.

The ghosts, witnessing this divine power, deeply believed in the Daoist Dharma. They awakened to the Dao of eternal life and abiding truth, their minds unwavering. They relinquished their karmic adversaries, emptied themselves, and cultivated harmony and reverence. All beings of different kinds became their companions, desiring to hear the Dharma and enter the Daoist sanctuary.

The Perfected One granted their request. The assembly bowed in reverence, then seated themselves facing north, composed and unmoving.

At that moment, the ailments afflicting the various barbarians were instantly healed, and each simultaneously beheld the Perfected One expounding the Dharma to them. Their bodies and minds awakened, all aroused the intention for the Dao, and together attained liberation.

The Mystic Master addressed them, saying: "You, the various barbarians, have sins and karmic obstructions deeply entrenched, your hindrances not yet dissolved, and thus cannot enter this assembly. For now, remain outside the city in tents of felt, single-mindedly vowing and reflecting, each repenting your transgressions. Six times daily, bow from afar toward the Dharma assembly within the city."

At that time, the gatekeeper named Shenling, having witnessed this, stepped forward, bowed, and inquired of the Perfected One, saying: "I do not understand—why, due to what past or present sins, are these barbarians unable to draw near the site of the Dharma assembly?"

The Perfected One, seated, explained in detail: "These various barbarians were once people of this very kingdom, dwelling on the shady side of the Dark Valley. In a former life, they served as patrons of a great fast. After the feast, they joined together in hunting, setting fire to the mountains and slaughtering over three hundred birds and beasts. Because the merit of their fast was incomplete, they were reborn in borderlands as barbarian chieftains, continuing thus for three lifetimes. Yet by the residual blessing of those creatures, they have now beheld me. Had they not killed living beings, they would have been born into wealthy and noble families within the Central Kingdom. In this life, their residual retribution is not yet exhausted; they conspire to rebel, plotting to harm the Heavenly King of Dao and Virtue. The multitude of ghosts unleashed their poison, slaughtering nine-tenths of their households and kingdom. The wronged spirits lodged their grievances above, and the spirits of these barbarians were seized. For these reasons, they cannot enter the Dao or partake of the Orthodox Dharma, and so are commanded to remain outside the city, bowing from afar toward the Dharma assembly."

The gatekeeper, having heard this, further inquired of the Perfected One: "Your disciple’s duty is to guard and protect, overseeing the imperial carriages. The city gates are bustling, with all directions converging. By imperial decree, I am stationed here, arranging the ranks, ensuring the order of chariots and cavalry as they enter and depart, and instructing those who come to hear the Dharma in proper conduct. Due to these pressing duties, I cannot enter the assembly to bow and listen to the Dharma. Morning and evening, I yearn with all my heart, longing to the utmost. I only beseech the Perfected One to take pity on this solitary and exposed one, and be my refuge and support."

The Perfected One replied: "As long as you possess the heart, single-minded and sincere in resolve, the Great Dao perceives from afar, making no distinction between inner and outer, near and far. The Great Dao ever aids beings with impartiality; even the distant barbarian souls are touched by its mysterious transformation. You, by virtue of your good fortune, personally guard the city gates. All good people come and go morning and evening. You have the most extensive connections with others—now, having beheld me, you have found a true and good spiritual companion."

Recalling past kalpas, I descended for karmic conditions, dwelling upon Mount Danhuo. For seventy minor kalpas, I sat within a forest, expounding to the immortals the method of dwelling and longevity in the Thirty-Two Heavens. At that time, you took the form of a mandarin duck. For three hundred lives, you nested in the cinnabar forest, beholding me morning and evening. At times, you would even carry jujubes and fruits in your beak to offer and supply the Dharma assembly. By virtue of this karmic affinity, you were born in the Middle Kingdom and have once more beheld me."

Hearing the Perfected One’s words, the gatekeeper wept in sorrow and lamentation, prostrating himself upon the ground. Then, the Perfected Lord again addressed the gatekeeper, saying: "Arise and fetch water to bathe your body." When the bathing was complete, the Perfected One said further: "Burn incense, pay reverence, and bow to the Great Compassionate True Emperor in the auspicious clouds above, then prostrate yourself upon the ground."

At that moment, the Perfected One employed his sovereign divine power, causing the gatekeeper’s heart to suddenly awaken. He beheld with perfect clarity the karmic conditions of his past lives. Rising to bow to the Perfected Lord, he wailed and wept in grief. The Perfected Lord said: "For a minor transgression, you have not yet attained the Dao in this life. On your account, I reveal that your beatings of men and beasts were recorded by the netherworld officials, for your heart was poisonous. Had you not committed these acts, your present body would have been liberated. You must strive diligently, ever vigilant and cautious, to avoid official transgressions and all evils. In your next life, you shall surely ascend and be delivered."

The gatekeeper wept and again addressed the Perfected One: "I do not know—can this fault be confessed and repented?" The Perfected One replied: "If you repent throughout your life, you may then be absolved of your sins."

The gatekeeper further inquired: "I do not know—might the secret essentials of the method by which the Venerable Dao expounded dwelling and longevity to the immortals in past kalpas be heard?" The Perfected One replied: "I have divided my body, and even now, within this assembly, I appear as immortals, Daoists, the Heavenly King Father, and the Great Emperor. I shall now expound the method of dwelling and longevity in the heavens above. If you wish to hear it, follow me and listen."

The gatekeeper answered: "I am bound by my duty to guard the gates and dare not wander far." The Perfected Lord said: "I have already divided your body into two." The gatekeeper looked back and saw another self attending to his duties. Thus, he knew the wondrous power of the supreme Dao of the Perfected Master, which transforms according to the heart’s intent. He then followed the Perfected Master into the assembly to listen to the Dharma.

Again, he saw upon the seat a Perfected Master whose golden countenance was identical, and the multitude of people could not distinguish between the true and the responsive manifestations. At that time, the gatekeeper asked the Perfected Master: "The Supreme Great Dao, most true and wondrous, divides its form and scatters its body—how many bodies does it assume?"

The answer came: "The Supreme Great Dao divides its body into qi, pervading everywhere between heaven and earth. Though spoken of as true and responsive, in truth, it is never distinct."

The assembly sighed, saying: "The Dao is present in all things." Then they understood that all beings possess the nature of the Dao, and those who attain the One Dao shall know perfect peace.

At that time, the Dao Lord addressed the great assembly, saying: "Within this Desire Realm, there is one heaven, yet in the four directions, it is spoken of as the Four Heavens. Within these Four Heavens, there are also true immortals who do not wish to ascend further, governing within these heavens. Though the names of the heavens differ, the longevity of the immortals above and below is equal, with no distinction of superiority or inferiority, and all abide without retrogression. Some manifest responsive bodies that undergo birth and death, while their divine transformations conceal and shift, subtly and eternally abiding, serene and unmoving.

Below these Four Heavens, good men and women who perfect their cultivation and become later sages may dwell in this world, their lifespans long or short as they wish. Some enter renowned mountains and grotto palaces, or dwell within the lesser heavens for hundreds of millions of kalpas. When they later wish to ascend, they first enter the Great Yellow Heaven, dwelling for one hundred million kalpas. Next, they ascend to the Great Bright Heaven, dwelling for two hundred million kalpas. Then, they ascend to the Heavens of Hétóng, dwelling for three hundred million kalpas. Next, they ascend to the Heaven of Peaceful Nurturance, dwelling for four hundred million kalpas. Then, they ascend to the Heaven of Primordial Brightness, dwelling for five hundred million kalpas. Next, they ascend to the Seven Luminaries Heaven, dwelling for six hundred million kalpas. Then, they ascend to the Heaven of Zhàohéng, dwelling for seven hundred million kalpas. Next, they ascend to the Heaven of Misty Veil, dwelling for eight hundred million kalpas. Then, they ascend to the Heaven of Harmonious Yang, dwelling for nine hundred million kalpas. Next, they ascend to the Heaven of Reverent Splendor, dwelling for one billion kalpas. Then, they ascend to the Heaven of Radiant Brightness, dwelling for eleven billion kalpas. Next, they ascend to the Heaven of Zhúlùo, dwelling for twelve billion kalpas.

For those true immortals who wish to dwell in these heavens and do not desire further ascent, they may follow their inclination, and their sublime retribution shall be inexhaustible, with no distinction between above and below.

Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Empty Brightness, dwelling for thirteen billion kalpas. Then, they ascend into the Heaven of Serene Stillness, dwelling for fourteen billion kalpas. Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Mysterious Brightness, dwelling for fifteen trillion kalpas. Then, they ascend into the Heaven of Ultimate Jade, dwelling for sixteen trillion kalpas. Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Primordial Bearing, dwelling for seventeen trillion kalpas. Then, they ascend into the Heaven of August Cliff, dwelling for eighteen trillion kalpas. Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Manifest Concentration, dwelling for nineteen trillion kalpas. Then, they ascend into the Heaven of Primordial August, dwelling for twenty trillion kalpas. Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Floating Capaciousness, dwelling for thirty trillion kalpas. Then, they ascend into the Heaven of No-Thought, dwelling for forty trillion kalpas. Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Yuànlè, dwelling for eighty thousand trillion kalpas. Then, they ascend into the Heaven of Boundlessness, dwelling for ninety thousand trillion kalpas. Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Luminous Court, dwelling for one hundred thousand trillion kalpas. Then, they ascend into the Heaven of Primordial Grotto, dwelling for one thousand thousand trillion kalpas. Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Wondrous Completion, dwelling for ten thousand ten-thousand trillion trillion kalpas. Then, they ascend into the Heaven of Forbidden Heights, dwelling for one hundred million trillion trillion kalpas. Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Constant Fusion, dwelling for kalpas as numerous as the atoms of a billion trillion worlds. Finally, they ascend into the Heaven of Jade Prosperity, dwelling for kalpas as numerous as the atoms of a trillion trillion great earths."

Next, they ascend into the Heaven of Brahmā’s Ascent, dwelling freely in the Heaven of Level Peace. Above, they rise into the Great Void, journeying onward to the Great Net, entering the formless, the vast and profound darkness.

From the Heaven of August Layers upward to the Heaven of Great Void, there is no count of kalpas for formation or dissolution. These are reckoned in the kalpas of the Desire Realm to instruct sentient beings.

The Dao-realms above are called the Void and Nothingness. The Dao itself arises from emptiness, its form natural, its body composed of luminous qi, beyond naming or speech. The great sages of the Heavens above the August Layers are likewise.

Even within the four heavens of the Desire Realm, in the grotto-palaces of sacred mountains, later sages and perfected immortals, though they witness the kalpas of heaven and earth, renew their forms day by day. Their spiritual power grows ever greater, never retreating or changing, eternally abiding without alteration.

At each stage of immortal rank, they forever sever the cycle of birth and death, enduring endlessly, beyond all conception. This is not like the heterodox teachings found in the scriptures and commentaries of worldly cults, where demonic impostors usurp the titles of immortals, enjoying celestial pleasures for ninety thousand great kalpas, only to fall back and regress.

These are but essence-ghosts and specters, utterly opposed to the true and correct Dao. Those who hear such teachings hear only falsehood, not the true and right.

At that time, the left attendant of the Supreme Thearch, named Great Chapter, keen and upright in wisdom, steadfast in his nature and fond of the Dao, had not yet attained the true Thearch. His heart still harbored doubt. He stepped forward, bowed deeply, and addressed the Dao Lord, saying:

"Your servant has lived twenty-five years, serving as an inner scribe, attending directly upon the Supreme Ultimate, the most revered in the human world. The people of the four seas come as children, all offices provide for me, and the world looks up in veneration. The karmic retribution is beyond measure.

Yet over a hundred years have passed, and worldly toils weigh heavy with ten thousand cares. Though I dwell in the ancestral temple, my heart wanders far beyond. Governing the people and serving heaven, my mind labors even in sleep and waking."

My steps falter, ears and eyes grow dull, sinews wither and strength wanes, marrow and brain run dry, qi and vigor weaken—every movement brings bitterness and toil. Each glance at my reflection cuts the five emotions like a knife; grief and sorrow compound, leaving no peace in sleep or meal. Not yet a hundred years have passed, yet ten thousand kinds of affliction poison my life.

I know not how true immortals endure through dust and kalpas, their form and spirit unperishing, enduring hunger, toil, and hardship.

Before Great Chapter could finish speaking, the true master’s divine power swiftly restored the Thearch’s countenance to youth—his complexion smooth as congealed fat, his flesh full and radiant. The Thearch’s consort, fair of face with raven hair, skin like ice and snow, teeth white and even, her strength doubled beyond the ordinary, instantly ascended to the joyous heavens above to pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy. She could perform the five transformations: entering wood as wood, entering fire as fire, entering metal as metal, entering water and earth as water and earth. She ascended the mysterious void, stepping lightly without encumbrance.

Then the true lord vanished into formlessness, his whereabouts unknown. After a long while, he reappeared, seated in empty space a thousand *zhang* above the earth, his divine feet cradled by eight-colored cloud-dragons, his form sheltered by seven-hued joyous heavens that followed and responded. The three luminaries encircled and illumined him; his body radiated a penetrating light of compassion. Serene and composed, he spoke to Great Chapter:

"Sevenfold radiance scatters like foam, five-colored relics descend as two elixirs. If even the parents of a great king consume them and gain such divine, untrammeled power—how much more so the supreme Dao? Mere walking corpses with shallow vision dare stand before the Dao, doubting the great sage. I have shown you but a minor path—how do you find its power?

The unsurpassed great Dao transforms the mortal into the sacred, allowing this very body to ascend into formlessness. Vast, it has no exterior; minute, it enters the infinitesimal. My Dao accomplishes this. All other paths, by contrast, aim only for annihilation and cannot instantly transform this body into the dharma-body. Their external methods leave the spirit weak and feeble, unable to preserve or sustain. Life itself becomes a burden: cold and heat break the body, right and wrong clash in the heart, illness and hunger, satiety and ten thousand afflictions poison existence.

Birth, aging, sickness, death—the form of ignorance cannot endure long and seeks early extinction. How much better to follow the supreme Dao, turning the mortal into the sacred, the body like vajra, kalpas like a blink, form renewed with each day, moving in and out without obstruction—what care for burdens? The cycle of birth and death is severed, afflictions do not continue—who can weary such a one? Ascending into formlessness, who can destroy them? Returning to the original void, merging with the great emptiness—who can see them? Divine transformations are free and unconstrained; existence and nonexistence flicker like illusion—who can know them? If the beginning is unknown, how can the end be known?

The ten thousand heavens reside in the heart; the dusty world enters a single hair—yet the original nature remains unchanged. What say you to this?"

Then Great Chapter prostrated himself before the dais, loosened his hair, and knocked his head upon the ground, repenting and reproaching himself. The Great King, Chongguang, seeing his parents suddenly ascend to the mysterious, burned incense and gazed heavenward, knocking his head in reverence to the Heavenly Worthy and the true lord, bowing in shame before the nine barbarians and eighty-one immortals. He spoke thus:

"All conditions harmonize in fulfillment; sacred and profane rejoice together. May the southern Man, western Rong, northern Di, and all frontier tribes—those in distant lands who have not heard the true Dharma, who wear horns and fur, beast-hearted yet human-faced, sentient but unenlightened, who drink blood and eat raw flesh, all moving and breathing beings, both hidden and manifest, humans and ghosts—may they all awaken to the cycle of birth and death and enter the stream of the Dao."

When these words were spoken, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion from the Joyous Heavens above, together with the true lord seated beside him, radiated a light of compassion that illumined the lower realms. Their voices of mercy reached all, and the various beings each saw the Heavenly Worthy descend before them, expounding the six perfections and the six supernatural powers—the gateway to supreme, unobstructed liberation.

At that time, the great assembly, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, opened their hearts and awakened their minds. They understood that conditioned dharmas do not escape birth and death, and that those who leave the household life to cultivate the Dao all attain enduring existence.

Then the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion poured forth the rain of Dharma, moistening each according to their karmic conditions—some deeply, some shallowly—yet appearing equally in form. Though the assembly beheld the same countenance, their faces differed; though a single voice expounded the Dharma, each received it differently, their understanding and faith varying, their responses dissimilar.

Among this assembly, there were three kinds of beings: the parents of the great king, whose fortunate karmic conditions, though unmoving, evoked a response, attaining the Dao in an instant. The men and women of the divine realm received its blessings and benefits, enabling their bodies to attain longevity, preserving purity and emptiness, pairing with the Dao, and receiving deliverance in this very life. Their form and spirit would not decay, indestructible as vajra.

When the various Rong and Di tribes heard of long life, their minds grew confused, their spirits frenzied, their body hair stood on end. Some slackened in all four limbs, unable to control themselves; others grew dazed and fell into deep sleep, roaring without awareness. The great Dao, moved by compassion, did not abandon them.

Then the true master addressed the tribes, saying: "Each of you, rise and burn incense, and make your vows and practices known."

When the various tribes had finished burning incense, their karmic conditions bound them, leaving them unable to speak further. They all vowed to cultivate the Dharma of karmic conditions and together entreated the true master of the great Dao to expound the path of extinction and deliverance. The true master assented. The assembly rejoiced, bowing as one, and heard the true master expound the Dharma of extinction and deliverance. The various Rong and Di tribes were freed from the affliction of resentment toward the Confucian way.

The true master further instructed the tribes, saying: "Good sons, cultivating the Dao and planting karmic roots is like a skilled farmer. In the season of the three yangs, he diligently harnesses his oxen, guiding them with hooks and ropes, reinforcing embankments tightly, treading through mud and mire. He enriches the soil with fine manure, then selects good seed, clearing away weeds and refuse, ensuring proper warmth and moisture. Next, he tends the seedlings, removing harmful grasses, mounding earth around the roots, watching over them morning and evening, preventing the six kinds of livestock from trampling or eating them. Thus, after three months, the seedlings flourish, lush and verdant, their beauty unmatched on land or water, free from harm or blight."

When cool autumn brings the harvest to fruition, the crops ripen evenly across high and low fields. The master then commands servants and laborers to gather and store the yield, with warehouse keepers overseeing its safekeeping, preventing any loss or waste. The grain serves only for sustenance, its reserves ever-growing, ensuring the household’s abundance. Surplus is shared with the poor, relieving hunger and want, its generosity vast and far-reaching. Such boundless virtue and kindness ascend to the heavens, and all beings—seen and unseen—guard the good. Blessings and power thus come to fruition, harmonizing all endeavors, fulfilling every desire, leaving no wish unanswered. Just as the skilled farmer reaps immeasurable profit in the end, so too, good sons, must you, the great assembly, diligently cultivate the field of Dao and blessings, your hearts unwavering in effort. Like that farmer, you shall surely attain your reward without fail.

Good sons, in a past kalpa, north of the Dark Valley, the queen of King Xiuchou of the Resting Chieftains conceived and bore twin sons. Until the age of six, their appearances were identical, and the king cherished them, often holding them in his arms. At seven, they were sent afar to seek a master’s instruction, receiving the same teachings.

The king himself named these sons: the first was called Shaoguang, the second Shaoming. The two studied together, and the king would often go in person to admonish them, urging them not to grow idle or lazy. Their master instructed them in proper conduct and imparted his arts and skills.

At that time, the two sons would gather each morning to receive their lessons. Once their studies were complete, they would each return to their own quarters to ponder the meaning. Shaoguang recited aloud, then sat in silent contemplation, rising early and retiring late without sleep. Shaoming, however, was by nature indolent and prone to drowsiness, indulging in wine and sensual pleasures, his spirit restless and agitated. Though he read the texts, he gave no thought to their meaning. When he saw his father, he would cunningly feign diligence, never letting the scroll leave his hands. His nature, too, was dark and malicious. Their master dared not discipline him strictly, for Shaoming always carried a blade, his temper violent and rebellious.

When he reached seventeen, the king assembled his ministers to discuss the succession, commanding the nobles to examine the princes before the assembly and compare their merits. Shaoguang’s skills and arts were flawless, his answers without fault; he mastered all worldly arts, and his nature was kind and benevolent. When Shaoming was questioned, he could not respond to even a single query, having distorted his master’s teachings and misled his peers. The master addressed the king: “The prince is of a violent disposition, disobedient to instruction, and refuses to heed my teachings. His nature is treacherous and dangerous.” The king, unwilling to believe this, ordered a search of his person, and indeed, a blade was found. The master said, “If I cannot even protect myself, how dare I instruct him?” The king then banished Shaoming beyond the city walls.

Later, harboring resentment, Shaoming plotted rebellion. Before he could gather his followers, his scheme was discovered. Fearing punishment, he fled to the borderlands, but the neighboring kingdom refused him refuge and seized him, sending him back. Ashamed to face his father, he held his breath and died. The ministers deliberated and declared him a traitorous son and rebellious minister; they refused to bury him, casting his body into the wilderness. Birds, beasts, insects, and ants shunned his malevolence, leaving his flesh untouched. His fat and marrow flowed like rivers, soaking the grasses and marshes. For his lack of faith, he brought about his own destruction. Heaven and earth showed no pity; gods and men alike despised him. His soul was exiled, condemned for ten thousand kalpas, never to be redeemed. Even if he were reborn, he would lose his human form.

Shaoguang was then enthroned as crown prince. He convened the nobles, granted a general amnesty throughout the land, and ascended the throne in a cloud of incense. Gazing into the distance like a deity, his countenance was upright and his demeanor gentle, his virtue as warm as spring. The four seas were at peace, and the realm prospered. Sages from distant lands gathered like turtles and phoenixes, aiding and supporting the kingdom, uniting the wills of men and gods. Wind and rain came in their seasons, and the hundred grains ripened.

The crown prince was temperate, benevolent, loyal, and forgiving, kind and filial. At thirty, the king abdicated the throne, entrusting the governance of the realm to him. The prince declined three times, but fearing disobedience would make him an unfilial son, he bowed to his father and accepted the throne. He ruled by the Dao, issuing no extraneous decrees. Before a year had passed, praises filled the roads; men and gods alike submitted to him. Auspicious signs flourished: lingzhi mushrooms filled the courtyards, unicorns and phoenixes soared and gathered, immortals descended to wander, and clouds of immortals spread in all directions. The True Lords of the Upper Prime took him as their disciple, imparting to him the essentials of the Dao. He wore the Register of Life at his waist, and divine might protected and aided him.

At ninety, though aged, he became youthful again, his complexion like that of a child, his ears and eyes sharp, his vital qi abundant and nourishing. His five viscera flourished, his white hair turned black, and his decayed teeth regrew. The Immortal King of Supreme Medicine compounded divine elixirs for him, restoring his qi and form so that he never aged. At one hundred and seventy, he one day relinquished his kingdom and ascended to the Great Empyrean. To this day, he reigns in the Heaven of Supreme Purity, dwelling in the Jade Flower and Jasper Terrace, enduring without end, ever cultivating the supreme Daoist arts.

For his lifelong faith, his destiny was fulfilled. The Dao does not fail those who do not fail it—this is the meaning here. Good sons, all of you in this assembly must establish faith in the Dao, diligently cultivate meritorious deeds, and avoid untimely death. This is the foundation of the Dao.

At that time, the various tribes, having heard the supreme Dharma, received it with joy. The great assembly bowed their heads in reverence, all at once awakening to the causes and conditions of the Dao, their hearts free from worldly attachments. They prepared their attire, mounted their elephants, bid farewell to the Perfected Ones, and returned to their homelands. By the power of this Dharma, the barbarian spirits crossed the Southern Palace and were reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss in the Eastern Realm of the Dao.

The Chinese men likewise returned to their homes, revering and cultivating the supreme Dharma. Among the Daoist priests present, ninety-seven thousand attained the six penetrations and unrestrained freedom. Some followed others to wander the lower realms. The immortals of the Nine Barbarians ascended into the formless, their whereabouts unknown.

The king’s parents likewise ascended to the Celebratory Empyrean, where the Jade Purity Heavenly Worthy bestowed upon the king the title of Supreme Emperor, naming him Master of the Cavernous Mystery and Great Mystery. He also conferred upon the queen the title of Immortal Lady of the Mystic Terrace, granting her twenty-four female immortals as attendants, flying canopies and swift chariots, to ascend to the Cavernous Heavens and preside over newly initiated female Daoist priests.

At that time, the Perfected Master, still dwelling in the Cold Forest to save the world from its flames, remained with the True Lords of the Jade Purity in the Mystic Realm, serene and unmoving. On the four seasons and eight solar terms, they would emit radiant sounds. All living beings relied upon them for sustenance.

Thus concludes the seventh scroll of *The Jade Purity Scripture of the Great Dao of the Supreme*.
Beginning of the eighth scroll of *The Jade Purity Scripture of the Great Dao*.

**Scroll the Eighteenth: Secluded Dwelling**

At that time, in the Cloud Palace of the Jade Purity Heaven, the Right Terrace’s Perfected Sovereign of the Upper Prime, named Compassionate Forbearance and also called Penetrating Mystery, oversaw the thirty-four heavens above, governing the rise and fall of the Three Realms and the fortunes of calamity or blessing. He held the pivot of all heavens and grasped the mechanisms of the nine earths. Turning the numinous net and revolving the jade balance, he polished the Two Radiant Sceneries and illumined the Five Celestial Luminaries, sprinkling sweet dew and steaming forth clouds and rain, transforming the untransformed and compiling the hidden storehouses. All beings that partake of qi were thus provided their proper due.

He commanded the host of dragons and drove the myriad spirits, regulating and guiding the upright qi, diffusing benevolence and harmony. Thus the four seasons never faltered, the eight solar terms remained constant, and the twenty-four qi never strayed from their eternal norms. He rectified the Yellow Path and opened the primordial heavens, curbing the yin to form the vast darkness and anchoring the yang to perpetuate the limpid waves. He dispelled the fire essence in the southern blaze and extinguished the water spirits in the northern cove, planted the Five Sacred Fungi in the celestial fields, and nurtured the Responsive Emperor in the Purple Tenuity. The Twelve Perfected Officials transformed and nourished all living beings, while the Sixfold Ceremonial Might of the numinous spirits encircled and aided their forms and souls.

Cloud-script manifested of itself, and the celestial scriptures shone in the void. The myriad multitudes followed his example, and wisdom arose daily. Without speech, he transformed; without action, he accomplished. He suppressed the partial qi of the Six Heavens, established the Four Offices to govern life, cultivated the hundred grains to sustain existence, and revealed divine medicines to guide the living. For hundreds of millions of kalpas, his deep roots stood unshaken. By the Dao he mended what was broken—thus did he attain such mastery.

At that time, in the Great Tang world, there was a king who practiced the Dao, named Zhaode, of the Xuan clan. The entire kingdom—ministers and subjects alike—devoted their hearts to the practice of the Dao. In that era, thirty-six thousand petty kingdoms along the frontiers, their kings gazing from afar at his majestic power, turned their thoughts inward and reflected. Each led their ministers and officials in grand ceremonial display, bearing incense, flowers, banners, and canopies, performing exquisite music. With utmost sincerity and open hearts, they spared no effort from the moment of their initial resolve. Arriving at the sacred precinct, their thoughts flowed in unbroken succession, free of杂念. Assembled before the great kingdom, they burned incense and made their vows, yearning with reverent longing toward the vast emptiness of the upper firmament, their earnest aspirations fixed as if awaiting something. They prayed for the Ninefold Mystery and Seven Ancestors, for all the multitudes of the people, and for the king himself, saying: "May we attain the supreme Great Dao, that it may shelter and pity us, prolong the kalpic destiny, compassionately create all beings, release them from the snares of existence, and absolve all transgressions. May those in darkness and light alike awaken together. May the root of faith be established, that they may bear the ultimate Dharma and realize enlightenment in this very body."

These kings presented their lofty vows for a day and a night, supplicating six times; for a day and a night, they performed music six times. Their melodies were harmonious and refined, subtle and pure, so clear that all who heard them were moved to awaken the Dao-mind, abandon evil, and embrace goodness without doubt or hesitation. The fragrance of incense rose and suffused the imperial court; their whispered words, pure and flowing, reached the ears of the Perfected Lords.

At that moment, on the morning of the seventh day of the first month, the Heavenly Worthy of the Cloud Palace responded to the living with formlessness and taught sentient beings with silent sound. Extending his divine feet beyond the vast emptiness, he plucked the Dharma-finger in the distant void. True light eclipsed the sun, illuminating even the deepest obscurities; subtle tones, pure and flowing, were answered by all in attendance. He polished the eyes of the mundane, unsealed the ears of the vulgar, and swept forth the resounding music of the empty void, praising their compassion and forbearance: "Excellent, excellent! Compassion and forbearance protect the world—no power compares. Ever with the Dao-eye he gazes upon beings, ever with the Dao-heart he pities beings, ever with the Dao-hand he guides beings, ever with the Dao-body he transforms beings, ever with the Dao-feet he leads beings, ever as the Dao-father he cherishes beings, ever as the Dao-mother he nurtures beings, ever as the Dao-friend he befriends beings."

Then the various heavenly youths, hearing from afar the radiant tones from above, rejoiced and gathered their thoughts, each saying: "The Dao does not act in vain—today its fruition is manifest!" These heavenly youths redoubled their diligence, casting aside杂念, letting the Dao govern itself, and desiring nothing else. Though they heard the rare sound, it was still bounded by thirty-six thousand heavens and earths. They wished only that the supreme Dao would not depart, dared to hope for its mysterious regard, and prayed that flesh and bone might together ascend, becoming true immortals forever, that the nine ancestors might receive blessings, their souls delivered to the Southern Palace—thus would the world know great peace and the people rejoice.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of the Cloud Palace again expounded in subtle tones, addressing the kings: "The Son of Heaven follows Heaven without contrivance; the people serve the Son of Heaven without toil. When the Son of Heaven and the people together know peace, then there is no sorrow, no care. Good men, though the supreme Great Dao dwells above thirty-six thousand mysterious heavens, it looks down upon the mortal realm as if upon its own palm. You kings who diligently cultivate the supreme Dao without laxity—none shall fail to become an exalted sage. It is like a skilled farmer who plants well: having sown the mother, he must reap the child. You who uphold the Dao of great peace—how could you not abide in eternal joy? I bestow the ultimate Dharma, and the Perfected Lords above know all things and attain great peace. When the Perfected transform those below, it is no different from my own work. If you wish to serve the Dao, and aspire to be delivered in this very body, this is not difficult—only ask how resolute your will may be. None who study fail to succeed; none who sow fail to grow. Examine the source, and the stream will follow of itself—this is the natural principle, certain and without doubt."

At that time, though the kings revered and assented to the teaching, their minds had not yet penetrated the truth. Secretly, they wished to behold the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy, knowing their intent, commanded the Perfected Lord Tongxuan to strike the divine chime of the great void and play the words of the empty zither, saying to the kings: "Emptiness and purity are the root of the Dao; the great void is the body of the Dao. Emptiness and purity are unstained; the root of the Dao is without deviation. The true person values the ultimate Dharma; the vulgar world craves clamor and noise."

"Those who wish to gaze upon the walking corpses among men
Rush headlong in pursuit of glory and splendor.
Beholding these cloud-palace Perfected Ones,
All who turn toward the Dao grow proud and extravagant.

Eyes and ears no longer see or hear;
Discernment knows no obstruction.
Abiding in stillness, they guard non-action,
Restraining their wills from tangled blossoms.

Perfect penetration holds no divergent aims;
Forgotten thoughts are the true home.
The Dharma-body ever abides in emptiness and nothingness,
Its measure embracing the great void.

Only then may one rend the net of dust,
Crush the thicket of afflictions.
Standing alone beyond the flow of俗,
Darkly one merges with the Dao.

The Dao’s root admits no seeing;
Inward vision observes the mind itself.
Knots and fetters cannot endure,
Obstructions and burdens daily dissolve and sink.

Lofty steps tread the edge of cloud-cliffs,
Within the void they savor the tones of virtue.
Seated unmoving in their place,
The worthy and sage naturally seek one another.

Wherever they dwell, they store kindness and benefit,
Withdrawing their traces to roost in mountain forests.
Donning coarse robes, they draw in streaming radiance,
Burning incense, they lay bare their hearts.

When merit is complete, they merge with the Dao’s body;
The myriad transformations all ascend without fail.
Though dust-kalpas have not yet dawned,
In profound obscurity there is no beginning or end.

I tell you the mechanism of ascending to Perfection:
When virtue is full, the Dao grows ever more vast."

At that time, the kings beheld these numinous wonders,
Sighing in awe at what they had never before seen.
Each turned to the others and said:
"The Dao’s majesty and spirit are present everywhere.
The voice of the great void still utters subtle words;
The golden mouth’s speech—how wondrously refined!

Reflecting on our change of heart,
Scarcely three months have passed,
Yet we have already seen and heard the supreme, peerless Dharma.
If we cultivate it lifelong, we shall surely not abandon it.

We and our followers have received the Dao’s grace;
We must not retreat and lose our former merit.
Let each of us relinquish our thrones,
Leave the world to follow the Dao, and take up the homeless life.
To be delivered in this very body—what joy could surpass it?

To indulge in glory and fame,
To wield power over the four seas—
All this cannot escape the terrors of punishment,
The loss of good fortune,
Birth, aging, sickness, death,
Withering decay and putrefaction,
Sinking into the dregs of filth—
Truly, this is cause for lament."

Then the heavenly kings at once abdicated,
Entrusting their thrones to meritorious ministers.
Seven months and seven days later,
They burned incense and paid homage to the void.

The great ministers vowed:
"We wish to follow the great Dao,
Seek to leave the world’s afflictions,
Dwell hidden in mountain forests,
And enter the Mystery Terrace."

Having made this vow,
At that time, thirty-six thousand Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Heavens,
And the luminous portals of the ten directions’ lands,
Outshone their usual brilliance.
Immortal mists and auspicious clouds
Poured forth sweet dew.
Nine-colored clouds
Wove phoenix patterns,
Enveloping the four heavens,
Their light illuminating the world below.
Gentle winds intoned the flutes,
Breathing forth sacred hymns.
Heavenly music played of itself,
Chanting the true scriptures.
The harmonious assembly of sounds
Defied all naming.

All this was the Dao’s qi flowing forth from the cloud-palace Perfected Emperors,
Uttering the correct tones,
Transforming the kings’ bodies,
Causing their true qi to swiftly respond,
Turning the common into the sagely.

At that time, the Perfected Emperors merely used their majestic spirit
To respond to the kings’ karmic resonance.
They did not manifest their Dharma-bodies to the common,
Expounding as heaven does—
For the Dao speaks without speaking,
Yet through the four seasons transforms the myriad things.

Heaven, as the Dao’s disciple,
Can yet accomplish this.
The supreme great Dao transforms things through qi,
Its true essence flowing and changing,
Invisible and inaudible.

Only those who receive deliverance
See and hear for themselves;
Those who do not receive deliverance
Cannot attain such vision."

At that time, each of the kings gazed upward and recited the celestial scriptures and cloud-borne sacred verses—thirty-nine chapters in all. On the seventh day of the tenth month, they burned incense and made vows, entreating entry into the Mystic Terrace. By then, the kings could already pass in and out of formlessness, sitting yet vanishing, their presence elusive and unfathomable. Their eyes emitted flowing light, and their bodies generated the five qi.

Once within the Mystic Terrace, each sat beneath a jade tree, shaded by its jeweled branches, resting upon golden thrones. Cloud-dragons flanked their seats, while immortal youths stood in attendance. Heaven bestowed fragrant flowers to uphold their rightful steps. Behind them rose walls of azure jade, and before them lay pools of golden essence and the numinous waters of the Five Rivers, moistened by nectarous streams. The Mother of the Nine Earths planted golden mushrooms, and dragon blossoms exhaled their qi, their fragrance suffusing all.

At that moment, the kings’ spiritual eyes grew luminous, and they beheld the Perfected Emperors as though near at hand. The knots of their mortal coils dissolved, and their perception became boundless and unimpeded. Not only the thirty-six thousand heavens and earths, but the ten directions of the cosmos lay before them like the palm of a hand. Each king sat beneath the jade groves, remaining in that place for nine hundred million great kalpas without shifting.

Then the Perfected Emperors of the Cloud Palace bestowed upon the kings the title of *Middle Perfected*. After another hundred million great kalpas, they conferred the rank of *Upper Perfected*. After yet another ten thousand million great kalpas, they appointed them as *Posterior Sage Dao Lords*, granting the title *Supreme Void Perfected Kings*, who to this day govern within the Ever-Mystic Heaven.

For the sake of hearing the Dao, the kings’ forms reverted to youth, their appearance as radiant as in their prime. Even the sixteen youths could divide their bodies to fill the void, withdrawing their forms into nothingness, transcending the perceptions of ordinary beings—something no lesser immortal or member of the four assemblies could comprehend. Such was the subtlety of their hidden efficacy, their wondrous subtlety beyond all comparison. At times they appeared in form yet spoke no word; at others, they spoke yet left no trace. In accomplishing one task, they fulfilled the essence of the myriad Dao, the gateway to all mysteries—thus their transformations knew no bounds.

Yet the world’s decline brings only turmoil, empty debates, and false distinctions, laboring in vain from beginning to end, with no true refuge. How grievous the suffering of the lost, sunk in dissipation and drowning in delusion! Without enlightened teachers or true scriptures, how can they find protection and escape the peril of death? Those who cherish the true must refine their discernment, carefully distinguishing authenticity from falsehood, testing orthodoxy from heresy. Seek the pivotal essence without doubt. Devote yourself wholeheartedly to deliverance, and you will know no confusion.

The superior practitioner of the Dao attains sagehood in this very body. The middling practitioner undergoes transformation, vanishing like a cicada’s molt—though appearing to die, they do not perish. The inferior practitioner toils for kalpas without end, passing through birth and death for countless ages.

The Dao declares: These kings, too, labored through birth and death, enduring kalpas of toil, governing the people and serving heaven, their merit known to the Supreme Emperor. They trusted in the great Dao, renounced worldly glory, entered the mountains to seek the Way, tasted a hundred herbs, expelled the old and absorbed the new, diligently studied the supreme scriptures, and grasped their profound meaning. They practiced compassion ceaselessly, benefiting all beings, and remained single-minded in their devotion, guarding the One. Distancing themselves from the world’s defilement, the Dao willed it so. Together, they received deliverance and became Posterior Sages.

After countless hundreds of millions of great kalpas, the *Primordial Perfected Dao of the Upper Origin* ascended to become the *Posterior Sage Dao Lords of the Thirty-Six Thousand Heavens*, each governing a single heaven and overseeing the transformation of the world in turn. The *Primordial Perfected Emperors* ascended into formlessness, ceasing all movement and activity. Though still and silent, vast and empty, they responded without intention, their influence mirroring the resonance of spirit and echo. Without emotion, they yet acted, unaware of their own doing—thus it is called *ceasing all movement and activity*.

At that time, in the world of Great Tang, the Dao flourished for nine kalpas. Eight years later, in the year *renzi*, on the seventh day of the first month, there was a great minister named Guangde, of the Wang clan, already a hundred years old. His hearing remained keen, his vitality strong. He governed with righteousness, never betraying the people’s trust. All living beings, even the lowliest, basked in his virtue. At the turning of the four seasons and the eight solar terms, he established altars for fasting, exhausting his wealth to make offerings with utmost sincerity.

The ministers of neighboring lands, hearing of his integrity, revered his virtuous reputation from afar and secretly dispatched envoys bearing gifts to honor the great minister. Such tributes continued unbroken for nine years. Minister Guangde, sensing their devotion, burned incense morning and night. The fragrant smoke subtly perfumed the ministers of the neighboring lands, their bodies suffused with its scent.

Each night, they dreamed of a divine being, sixteen feet tall, standing close before them. The ministers thought to themselves: *Could this be the virtuous man we honor? Has the great Dao taken notice of us, revealing his majestic presence?* Their faith deepened, and their reverence grew. They, too, burned incense morning and night, making vows, and maintained purity for a thousand days.

On the seventh day of the tenth month, at midnight, they suddenly saw in the courtyard two youths holding divine candles, who proclaimed the minister’s teaching: *If you wish to meet him, come discuss the Dao and its virtue.* The ministers, hearing the youths’ words, crawled out in prostration, bowing to the youths while gazing at the divine candles, too awestruck to bid farewell. After taking eight steps, they suddenly found themselves before a great city, its towers and palaces resplendent. There they beheld Minister Guangde, bowing and exchanging greetings.

After a long while, they marveled at the wonder, realizing they had traversed over eight thousand *li*. The nearest ministers had come from three to five thousand *li* away. In an instant, they had arrived in the Central Kingdom. In all, fifty-nine thousand ministers, moved by the Dao, vowed to renounce their ranks and enter the mountains to cultivate the Way.

The candle-bearing youths numbered one hundred eighteen thousand. All were *Middle Perfected* attendants of the Right Terrace of the Cloud Palace, who, sensing those of sincere devotion, illuminated them with divine candles to steady their minds and bodies, keeping their eyes from straying and their ears from wayward sounds. They grasped the essentials of the Dao and hastened to the sacred precinct.

Within and without, harmony and goodness ripened, their karmic fruits now fully mature. Swiftly they attained the radiance of the divine candles of the Dao-perfected. Such were their merits and virtues.

Then the youths gathered all the divine candles into a single torch of wisdom, its breadth and length precisely over six hundred *li*. Its light was cool and clear, penetrating and illuminating without end. Beholding this torch of wisdom, the ministers’ hearts and eyes became perfectly lucid, and all exclaimed in wonder: “Never before have we seen such a thing!” First they bowed to the youths, then to the torch of wisdom, and spoke thus:

“Disciples are but coarse flesh, reeking of blood and bone, devoid of past blessings, having planted no good causes. Our virtue is meager, our merit slight—unworthy to hear the Dao. Yet the Great Dao, in its compassion, has shown us this rarity. We are overwhelmed by its grace and favor, joy and awe intermingling.”

The youths replied: “The Great Dao is merciful; there is no need for self-deprecation. You, all of you, have abandoned worldly honors and emoluments to dwell in the mountains and seek the Dao. First, you must enter this torch of wisdom. Then, holding fast to your resolve, you shall dispel demons, dwell high among cliffs and peaks, chew the true scriptures, and chant the celestial texts. Brush away the drifting dust from the round mirror, wield the golden essence that subdues the sun. Let the chamber of spirit congeal its pearl, let the Eight Might emit their rays, let incense smoke ascend to convey your hearts’ devotion. Your merits shall be heard in the imperial court, and you shall ascend to the Purple Dawn. Before long, through diligent toil in the mountain forests, you shall attain it. Our Dao is most divine—what is heard and seen is never false. Only those of utmost sincerity may obtain it.

If you wish to dwell in the mountains, you must uphold the luminous precepts: do no harm to what you hold dear, be it the young or the frail; avoid all impurity, and keep every movement and stillness pure. A single lapse topples ten thousand paths. How can you hope to attain clarity without first seeing and hearing these truths?”

Then the assembled ministers emerged from the radiance of the torch, kneeling in reverence to receive the precepts. The Youth addressed them, saying: "The precepts are caution itself. Though you possess wisdom, you have yet to discern the subtle. Those of keen intellect, relying on their own cleverness, lightly transgress what is forbidden, unafraid of the divine might. Before attaining the Dao, they remain bound by form and measure, their every movement and stillness flawed, their toil yielding no hope. Only when one attains freedom, moving without hindrance, ascending into formlessness, and forgetting all appearances—"

At that moment, the Youth expounded the precepts to the ministers, saying: "If you wish to dwell in the mountains, first cast aside the burdens of worldly affairs. What the Dao does not do, do not force yourself to do; what the true path does not tread, do not force yourself to tread. Simply know how to practice the Dao and preserve your body, without coveting other matters. Those who wish to abandon the human world and dwell in mountain forests should first seek like-minded companions, no more than three or five. The superior practitioner dwells in the mountains with no more than two or three. Too many bring noise and distraction, the mind cannot focus, and mutual scrutiny may lightly offend the divine might.

Do not tread in filth, nor mix with men and women indiscriminately. Do not discuss worldly affairs, nor sit or lie in carelessness. Do not let the mind wander into depravity, nor heed external matters. Though dwelling in the mountains, if the heart’s resolve is not single-minded, defilement will flow like a river, and perverse winds will come and go. The marrow and brain will wither, the teeth will decay, and the eyes will lose their brightness. Slothful in bathing, the skin will accumulate grime. The true qi will depart far away, leaving nothing to hope for. Exposed to the Three Luminaries, the benevolent spirits will not protect you. Indulging in sleep and rising late, neglecting offerings and rituals—on the Azure Tablets of the True Lords, no merit will be recorded. With sins uncorrected, the Nine Mysteries will be examined, the Four Offices will impeach, and you will be immediately dismissed in disgrace.

If thoughts are not focused and杂念纷扰, the true essence will not be preserved, and evil spirits will take hold. Unable to distinguish right from wrong, you will entertain perverse views. When true persons build their chambers, you will fail to show reverence. Clothing, ritual implements, and miscellaneous objects will be used improperly, their defilement flowing like a flood, causing the hun and shen to sink and stagnate. Even in relieving yourself, you will not know the proper orientation, polluting the sacred springs. The Earth Officials will record your transgressions, and your sins will fill the Black Register, to be borne by your living body.

Some may secretly peruse the celestial scriptures, recklessly transmitting what is not true, and when the scriptures are recited, their errors will implicate the Nine Mysteries. Some may reveal hidden secrets, treating the true texts with disdain. Some may speak boastfully, indulging in great anger or excessive joy, leaking the hidden classics and disrupting inner and outer harmony. Some may reveal true teachings, recounting their own dreams and fancies. Some may eat meat, drink wine, and crave pungent flavors, disturbing the spirit with vexation and losing the upright qi. Some may burn incense and pay homage at dawn, yet glance around, inviting demons to bring calamity—such offerings the Heavenly Emperor will not hear.

These prohibitions are what the true Dao abhors. Those who conceal their learning must deeply guard against them." Then the Youth addressed the ministers, saying: "Good men, those who study the Dao as the Dao, seek the perverse as the perverse. By analogy, this may be understood. Though you are worthy, you have not yet discerned the sacred teachings. Those who study the sacred Dao follow the sacred words, which are upright. By seeking it with uprightness, one may then escape the calamities of death and endure eternally.

Good men, those who cultivate my Dao will refine their form and spirit, transforming the mortal into the sacred, no longer subject to death. They will ascend into formlessness, free from all entanglements." Then the ministers rose from the ground, kneeling in response: "Though we have the heart to turn toward the Dao, we have not yet understood its principles, nor grasped the subtle mysteries of its regulations. We fear that we have not cultivated merit in the past and have no virtue to rely upon. Our years are already advanced, our strength and vigor declining. If misfortune suddenly strikes, we will be forever cut off from the path of life. Our hearts are heavy with sorrow, and afflictions weigh upon us.

Moreover, we have heard worldly people slander the great Dao, saying: 'Those who study the Dao cannot escape life and death.' They recklessly spread such worldly talk, offending the True Lords. We beg you to resolve our doubts and dispel our anxieties." The True Youth replied: "Good men, what you have heard are the mad words of fools, not the teachings of the utmost sages. Why is this so? In times past, there was a foolish band of three brothers who heard that the perfected ones avoid harm, dwelling in mountain forests, sipping from the mysterious stream, savoring the sweet dew, their form and spirit unwaning, their complexion like that of youths, enduring for billions of kalpas. Not understanding the subtlety of the supreme method, the emptiness and purity of the mysterious and wondrous, the three brothers, relying on their own shallow views, sought immortality.

The eldest brother, named Dark Child, chiseled into a sheer cliff, forged iron chains, and bound himself to a bed, sitting suspended in midair. Without food or drink, he died of hunger and thirst. The second brother, named Great Gatekeeper, rode a raft into the sea. Suddenly encountering a great wind, he drowned. The third brother, named Dullard, thought to evade death by entering deep into a stone cave, but was suddenly devoured by a poisonous dragon. From then on, the ignorant have followed in their footsteps without cease, recording these tales and spreading them as grand stories. Not grasping their profound meaning, they claim that the perfected ones study the Dao in the same way, spreading confusion and recklessly misleading those below.

The deaf and blind of the world are truly pitiable. I sigh for you all, who wish to study the true Dao—do not believe such perverse teachings, lest you waste your entire life. Not only this life, but in countless lives to come, you will not encounter the Dao. Those who plant trees, though they may experience the initial causes, must surely know that they will reap the corresponding fruits. If one dwells in evil causes while cultivating merit, even after billions of kalpas of cycling through evil causes, one cannot attain the fruit. Just as those who study the perverse are bound to it life after life, the perverse cause unbroken, they will have no opportunity to enter the upright path. The same is true for those who study the upright.

The true persons and superior practitioners are upright in all things—what is called upright body, upright heart, upright wisdom, upright life. If life has an end, it is not called upright life; if wisdom is perverse, it is not called upright wisdom. Good men, you must now understand: the Dao does not act in vain; it is transmitted only to the right person."

To transmit it to the unworthy is called reckless leakage. The prohibitions and precepts are solemn and weighty—this must not be unknown.

At that time, the assembled ministers, having received the prohibitions and precepts, again entreated the Perfected Youth, seeking to receive the *Scripture of Preserving the Spirit Within* and the Dao of nurturing the nascent soul and fostering the embryonic spirit. The Perfected Youth replied: "The *Scripture of Preserving the Spirit Within* and the Dao of nurturing the nascent soul and fostering the embryonic spirit are both dragon-script and phoenix-writings, celestial seal-characters of cloud-seal and heavenly patterns, radiant and resplendent, reviving the dead and restoring the bones. It is also called the *Precious Writ of All Heavens*. Without this writ, Heaven cannot broadly cover; Earth cannot generate and complete; Sun and Moon cannot illuminate; the constellations cannot align their courses; rivers and seas would dry at their sources. Without this writ, the Son of Heaven cannot transform the myriad multitudes. This scripture is treasured by the Supreme Sovereign, descending to the world but once in ninety thousand great kalpas.

Though I have received the golden edict of the Supreme Perfected Emperor, granting you the ordinances for entering the mountains, I have not yet received separate instruction to bestow the token of the precious scripture. If you wish to hear and see it, wait but a moment."

Thereupon, the youth burned incense and entered still contemplation, bowing from afar toward the upper realms and kneeling in reverence. At that time, the assembled ministers also burned incense, prostrating themselves with their heads to the ground. At mid-morning, suddenly they sensed an intense divine fragrance from above, suffusing all present. Fragrant blossoms advanced with the sun, nine-colored silken veils shimmering, filling their eyes with luster. As day turned to night, after the second watch, nine-colored streaming auroras illuminated the vast heavens. A fragrant wind blew the auroras into formation, shaping celestial script—each character a full *zhang* in size, its radiance dazzling, eclipsing the stars and moon. Then they heard celestial music pervading the ten directions, harmonious and serene, beyond all comparison. For nine days and nine nights, the sound continued before ceasing.

In an instant, from within the streaming auroras, a voice began to chant the opening of the *Inner Chapters of Preserving Life*—ethereal and resonant, vast and flowing, measured and harmonious, its melody stirring the floating clouds. Heaven rained fragrant blossoms in a dense, drifting haze. The streaming auroras now appeared withered, now moist, now dense, now sparse. Suddenly, golden visages and august forms appeared, seated in countless ranks, like dragons first assembling in the clouds or the Nine Perfected gathering in grand convocation. Their majestic bearing was composed, their raiment of auroral hues and rainbow robes swirling with the wind, sinuous and graceful, like dragons soaring in the void or phoenixes dancing in the sky. To their left hung bells, to their right chimes, their tones intertwining in harmony, now near, now far, now high, now low.

The heavens were clear, the air bright; the four seas were calm. Creatures of land, water, and air, all manner of beings, gathered in familiarity, gazing upward to listen to the Dharma-sound. The titles of the chapters were: *Seven Qi Perfect the Perfected*, *Six Rites Move the Void*, *Five Spirits Continue the Severed*, *Two Luminaries Support the Declining*. They traversed the celestial net, stepped upon the void, and soared into the cloud palaces. The embryo has its beginning; the dust-kalpas have no end. Within the golden city, the essence is conceived; within the jade cavern, the spirit is congealed. The true qi is nurtured within, thereby perfecting the sage. Above, they enter the Six Voids; below, they penetrate the dark springs and cloud-palace treasure pavilions. Within resides the true soul, entering and exiting the land of blessings, circling the gate of life, chewing upon numinous mushrooms, rinsing with golden springs. Sweet dew flows like rivers, cascading into the cinnabar field. Purple auroras shine at dawn; the Three Qi condense into mist. Within the jade chamber, the immortal is transformed, seated serenely upon the golden lotus. The true form obscures the sun; dust-kalpas become years.

At that time, the assembled ministers, hearing the Perfected Ones of the cloud palaces chanting the numinous chapters and reciting the Dao-scriptures, each looked around to see the complexions of the crowd like clouds, their hearts illuminated, the affairs of the Three Times clearly and distinctly revealed. Their bodies transformed and ascended of their own accord, attaining fruition at will, without hindrance or obstruction.

The Perfected Youth asked the assembled ministers: "Having heard the Supreme Lord of the Upper Realms chanting the precious scripture, its numinous efficacy subtly felt and verified, merging with the Dao in an instant—is this not joyous? Those who study the Dao and attain the true fruit do not shift from their bodies. You, all of you, first made vast vows, entering the mountains to seek the Dao. The Supreme Perfected Emperor of the Upper Prime took pity on your earnestness, knowing you would not retreat, and has accomplished your bodies, enabling you to swiftly attain the Dao. You still have your original vows: you must dwell in the mountains and teach later learners."

At that time, the Perfected Emperor bestowed from afar upon the assembled ministers the titles of Perfected Ones. The Perfected Ones, though separated by thirty-six thousand dark heavens, through their attainment of communion, perceived it as if face-to-face. The Dao merged without words; no petition was heard.

Then the Perfected Ones all ascended into the void, mounting Kunlun at its central peak. In all four seasons and eight solar terms, they ascended to the Jade Purity and paid homage at the cloud palaces. The Supreme Great Dao sometimes tarries, descending once in ninety thousand great kalpas to wander the Four Heavens, delivering later learners. Appearing in forms suited to each, adopting their voices to expound the Dharma, all for their benefit—boundless and immeasurable, beyond conception.

As for later learners, those who do not cherish the mountains and waters, who lack lofty aspirations, who linger in the dust and filth, entangled in afflictions—even if they harbor a faint intention, they cannot achieve greatness. Without steadfast resolve, not meeting an enlightened teacher, not recognizing the true essentials, believing in perverse and inverted views, unable to distinguish precepts and prohibitions, intermingling the true and the false, the pure and the impure, they have not yet aligned with the causal ground. Deceiving themselves that they have attained fruition, their bodies not yet delivered, they expound the Dharma to deliver others. The Great Dao remains unheard; their perverse listening is in vain. The teacher is ignorant and dull; the disciples are likewise obstinate. Deceiving themselves and deceiving others, they vie with the worldly, scheming for worldly gain, sustaining their walking corpses. They dwell constantly in the realm of misfortune, unafraid of peril, advancing and retreating in self-aggrandizement, losing their lives across kalpas. The Dark Bureau records their transgressions; they are exiled in life and death to no avail, forever losing the human way. How lamentable!"

The Dao speaks: In times past, on the southern slopes of Yuntai in the lower realms, there were five men who formed a fellowship to study the Dao. They journeyed south into Danhuo Mountain, descended to seek the earthly path, and emerged at Fulong Mountain, exiting through the southern cave of Xiao’e to the mountain’s sunny side. Dwelling together for several years, they consumed pine resin and herbs, yet did not comprehend the precepts and methods, nor had they beheld the true scriptures. Through years of toil and hardship, their hearts never wavered or grew weary. They shunned worldly dust, sought no worldly gain, and wore only garments of grass. Six times daily, they paid homage to Heaven above, praying for deliverance and eternal life without death.

Thus they persisted for forty-six years, until the Supreme Mystery took pity on their solitary devotion. The Divine Youth of the Solar Palace was sent to test the five men. The first trial took the form of a beautiful woman who sought lodging with them. During a bitter snowstorm, she stayed nine days, sharing their bed. The five men gathered herbs to sustain her, kindled fires to warm her, and cared for her as if she were their parents, their hearts filled with compassion. The Divine Youth, perceiving their intent, briefly withdrew.

Nine days later, he suddenly transformed into a great rhinoceros that gored and killed a deer. The deer, too, was a phantom, dying beside their hut. The five men went to see it, weeping in sorrow, and buried it. The rhinoceros, knowing their intent, departed.

Seven days passed, and as the five entered the mountains to gather herbs and food, they suddenly encountered a treasure trove—gold and silver beyond measure. Yet their eyes did not linger upon it.

Another seven days later, the Divine Youth appeared as a destitute, ailing beggar seeking alms. The five men tended to him, providing food and care for a full thousand days before he departed.

Nine days thereafter, the Divine Youth manifested as over thirty ferocious tigers, followed by ten giant serpents. The tigers’ tails hooked together, the serpents’ bodies intertwined, encircling the five men. With gaping jaws and lolling tongues, they seemed poised to devour them. Yet the five remained fearless, their countenances serene, their qi calm, their bodies at ease, as if nothing were amiss.

Then the Great Dao took pity, and the host of sages showed compassion. The sun and moon halted in the sky for fourteen days; in the depths of winter, ice melted, jade trees bloomed, thunder resounded with clarity, sweet dew descended from Heaven, divine incense wafted thickly, and a harmonious breeze arose. The Supreme Great Dao extended its hand from the void, filling the world. Celestial patterns shone brightly, auspicious signs gathered, unicorns danced, phoenixes sang, and all sounds harmonized in praise of the five men. Every being in the world—saints and mortals, creatures of every kind, earth and stone, grasses and trees—all intoned the subtle Dharma-sound, weaving the warp of Heaven and the weft of Earth, transforming the mundane into the sacred, all to be heard and heeded.

The five men absorbed these subtle sounds, their hearts softened, their virtue and power unmatched. Their joints grew strong, their six viscera harmonized, their ears and eyes keen, their spirit and consciousness profound. They did not defy the four seasons nor oppose the five phases, returning to the constant Dao and far from delusion. Skillfully employing harmony, they remained free of illness, malevolent forces vanished, and their true nature renewed daily.

The Divine Youth sighed, saying: "Though men may be wise, they cannot employ virtue. Clinging to heterodox views, they deny the eternal Dao, following the world to extinction, prematurely losing their true nature. They do not know that the Dao is never far from the body, yet their divided minds do not endure. Willingly they embrace annihilation, their wandering souls clinging to change, abandoning themselves to circumstance.

"Long ago, there were two brothers of the Feng clan, born of the same mother. The elder, named Yun, was sixteen; the younger, named Yu, was fourteen. Their mother sent them to study abroad, where they encountered two teachers: one poor and humble, yet rich in virtue and the Dao, dwelling in Changshan for nine hundred years; the other wealthy and esteemed, well-versed in worldly affairs. The brothers each followed one teacher. The elder served the mountain recluse to study the Dao; the younger, greedy for wealth, attended the worldly master. Clasping hands, they parted and went their separate ways.

"After sixty-seven years, amidst the vicissitudes of life, they chanced upon each other in Liyin. The elder recognized his brother, but the younger did not recognize him. Though aged, the elder’s complexion remained unlined, appearing younger than before. At their parting, the younger’s appearance had withered, his ears and eyes impaired, his gaze dim.

"For three days, the brothers remained together, yet the younger did not realize. He said to the elder, 'Are you not a demon?' Then, suddenly, he exclaimed, 'If you claim to be my brother, you must mean me harm!' He swiftly drew his sword and thrust at his brother—yet the blade passed through him as if striking empty space, leaving no wound. The younger brother trembled in fear, his limbs shaking, and cried out in a voice that startled birds and beasts. He collapsed to the ground in terror, seeking to slay his brother.

"Moved by compassion for his brother, the elder helped him rise, soothed him, and nursed him until he gradually revived, though he still dared not believe. The elder recounted to his brother their parents’ birthplace, their shared history, their village and homeland. Though the younger vaguely understood, he still suspected the elder might be a ghost or demon who had learned these things.

"After a long while, he said, 'If you are truly my brother, strike me with your sword. If you are not, the blade will find its mark.' Yet when he struck, he felt no wound—by this proof, he still could not believe.

"The elder said, 'I have heard that those who embody the Dao are reborn in every part of their being, their bodies free from the realm of death. Thus, blades cannot harm me—this is no ghost or demon. Do not doubt. We were born of the same parents, grew up together, yet our studies differed, one coarse and one refined, their worth and folly starkly divided. Had you not been deluded by greed and sought the Dao of life, you too could be as I am, no different.'

"Yet the younger brother’s heart remained doubtful, his faith not yet pure.

"Then the two brothers returned home together. Seeing their parents, they knelt and paid their respects. Their parents, beholding their sons, rejoiced beyond measure."

Though the younger son had not spoken, his parents already knew which of their sons’ studies had excelled and which had fallen short. At that time, their relatives and old acquaintances, hearing of their return, all came to inquire about the circumstances of their learning.

The elder brother then recounted to their kin the origins of his own studies, and in turn detailed the master his younger brother had followed, explaining each cause and condition in full. Gradually, the younger brother’s heart began to awaken, and he came to know that his elder brother’s words were true and without error. He bowed to his brother, knelt long in repentance, and deeply reproached himself, offering three months of atonement. Yet though he sought to make amends, his heart remained hesitant, and he did not ask his brother to transmit the supreme Dao.

After six months had passed, he again took leave of his parents and set out for distant lands to seek learning. By chance, in a foreign land, he encountered a heretical teacher in a destitute household, begging for clothing and food. He requested to serve and follow him as his master, and the heretic soon granted his wish. For six years he served diligently, until at last the heretic imparted to him the way of false teachings. He then bade his master farewell and returned to his homeland. Along the way, he endured hardship and toil, fell ill with exhaustion, and suffered injury to his sinews and bones. He collapsed by the roadside, his corpse left unclaimed, devoured by beasts. Thus he lost the Dao of life, and his soul endured bitter torment—how pitiable his fate.

Later reborn in a remote borderland, he misled the common folk, and in the nine hundred lives since, he has expounded false teachings, seeking worldly gain and sustenance for his body. Though he has achieved some merit, it is not enough to attain accomplishment; he will never in this lifetime attain the Dharma-body. Yet this heretic still wanders mountains and forests, carrying his begging bowl, entering villages to beg for food. With no fixed abode, he practices improperly, his deceptive words confusing the deaf and blind, luring the young and ignorant.

Heaven, for his grievous transgressions, commands lower spirits to harass him, disturbing his mind so that he clings to death and scorns the Dao of life, joining with demonic forces as his companions. Such heretics will persist until the later kalpas, when the world grows corrupt and shallow, and the Dharma spreads across two realms while the great Dao declines. At that time, the blessings of beings will be exhausted, and heaven will send omens of disaster. The harvests will dwindle, the people starve, and the water kalpa will alter the course of fate, sweeping all away in a great flood.

Then, by the wind of destiny, the supreme Dao will be bestowed upon his parents. They will cultivate it with devotion for a thousand days, and though aged, they will be restored to youth. Later, following their son, they will enter the Azure Wheel’s vale, drink the golden essence, and chew the jade fungus. Their bodies will emanate purple qi, their eyes shine with flowing light, their bones grow light and buoyant, enabling them to fly. Before long, the three will ascend into the formless realm, enduring eternally, where eons pass like moments, and the longer they abide, the more they renew.

Such is the fortune of those who encounter and ride the rising tide of destiny. Though of one origin, they diverged midway, drifting apart. Once separated, they were estranged for countless kalpas. Without a true teacher, this was his fate. Let later learners take heed from this scripture: the human birth is hard to attain—do not squander life.

Then the Perfected Youth warned those of future generations who seek the true Dao, those whose aspirations lie beyond the worldly, who cast off worldly ties and wish to dwell in mountains and forests, secluding themselves in empty cliffs to study and savor the supreme Dao, seeking liberation and ascension. The essential requirement is purity—without it, there is no hope.

Diligently seek the supreme scriptures, clearly observe the precepts and methods of cultivation. With a mind of kindness and compliance, resonance comes easily. Keep the chamber of the spirit pure, remaining awake day and night. Polish the bright mirror to a diameter of nine inches, free of blemishes, and hang it before you to discern spirits and demons, distinguishing false from true.

Open the Hall of Light to summon afar the Two Radiant Ones. Morning and evening, chew the essence of the dawn and dusk. In your secluded chamber, sit or lie as you find comfortable—there is no need for uniformity. Consume the subtle and wondrous, regulate your breath to a state of harmony—neither too slow nor too swift, neither too coarse nor too fine. Like an infant nursing at its mother’s breast, draw in the qi in a continuous, delicate thread, unbroken. Without strain or fatigue, like a hidden spring flowing silently, let inner and outer be still, all senses calm, all distractions forgotten.

In profound stillness, as if deaf and blind, do not rely on sight or hearing for perception. Then the turbid will settle, the Dao and virtue will become manifest, the spirit will be nurtured within, and harmonious qi will flow smoothly. Life and death, departure and abiding, will be governed by the mind’s command. Once the Dao of life is firmly established, even death cannot be attained if one wished it.

Those who seek the true must treasure and guard this scripture, never revealing it carelessly. To transmit it to the unworthy brings nine generations of retribution, and one will not attain the Dao. Keep it deeply concealed, never exposing it. Practice it diligently, and great peace will be secured. To lose it is to perish; to preserve it is to flourish. Conceal it, and the true will descend; reveal it, and calamity will come.

At that time, the Divine Youth addressed those of later generations who aspired to learn the Dao, their resolve set far from the worldly realm, severed from all worldly defilements. They wished to dwell in blessed lands, enter renowned mountains, seek the true scriptures, and gather and consume the numinous lingzhi. For a thousand years, ten thousand ages, they would remain unharmed by malevolent forces.

These lands abounded with benevolent spirits; their earthly qi was harmonious and refined, their waters and herbs suited to human needs. In the four directions of Kunlun, beyond the southeast, lay the Jade Grotto south of Wangwu Mountain, corresponding above to the celestial realms. The sun, moon, and stars were as they were in the heavens above, no different. The earthly paths were tenfold open, with a thousand trails and myriad routes where true immortals came and went. There were also palaces, and the celestial scriptures were fully present, no less than in the heavens above.

Within these grotto-heavens dwelled many divine beings, who from time to time ascended the mountains to gaze upon those who followed in their footsteps. The land teemed with yellow essence, white wood, and lingzhi of the upper, middle, and lower grades. Sweet springs and jade nectar, when drunk, staved off decline. Perpetual divine incense suffused the bells and chimes, and celestial music resounded endlessly in the void, while divine voices chanted the celestial scriptures. Those who dwelt in these mountains found the true Dao easily attained.

Next was the mountain of Wutai, beneath which lay a grotto connected to Wangwu. Above and below the mountain dwelled divine immortals, who from ancient times to the present had never ceased their presence among humankind. Next was Changshan, beneath which lay a grotto linked to the ten directions, also abounding in divine herbs. Then came Taibai and Zhongnan.

Following these were the Five Marchmounts, Fanghu, Fulong, Tiantai, Danhuo, Zengcheng, Luofu, the grotto-heavens of Jiangyuan, Damei, and the blessed land of Wuling. These places were rich in the five metals, cinnabar, realgar, elixir waters, golden essence, jade marrow, and divine lingzhi. Consuming them prevented decline and even restored youth. Studying and reciting the celestial patterns, one could repent of sins and redress transgressions.

The incense smoke ascends, bearing the offerings of the heart. When merit is profound and conduct perfected, one’s achievements resound to the August Heaven. The Great Dao, moved by compassion, welcomes such a one with wheels of flame, and the body ascends to the Grand Void to receive the title of Perfected One.

The divine youth further spoke: The borderlands’ many mountains abound in noxious vapors, where cold and heat are unbalanced, and the earth’s qi harms mortals. They teem with malevolent spirits. Later students, unprepared for hardship, have yet to spread their true qi or dispel defilements. Lacking a worthy master and true scriptures, their earnest aspirations are thwarted by the remoteness of the mountains. Women and the infirm, without a teacher to rely upon, cannot journey far.

Yet those of steadfast resolve may instead seek level ground, build walls within walls, and sever all worldly ties. Following the precepts and rituals, they shall commit no transgressions. Within a secluded chamber, they burn incense and make vows, practicing the Dao in all six periods of day and night. They voice their heartfelt wishes, repenting their faults—pleading for the Nine Ancestors above and themselves below—that all offenses be pardoned by the Heavenly Courts, and the Four Offices and Five Emperors wash away their transgressions. Let their breath be soft and voices low, their devotion complete.

At first, when lighting the incense and making their petitions, they must not glance about or entertain stray thoughts. If their hearts are not sincere, demonic qi will respond. To slight the Most Sacred is to have one’s pleas unheard, laboring in vain, reaping nothing but exhaustion. Disturbing the common folk, they deceive themselves with hollow cries. If the true Dao is not practiced, they sit awaiting annihilation. At the brink of death, they declare the Dao powerless.

Alas! These walking corpses, incapable of true faith, drown in the cycle of birth and death, never loathing their plight nor seeking liberation in this life. The Five Rebellions and Ten Evils blind their eyes and ears; the three poisons of worms and maggots fester in their viscera. Even if they encounter true scriptures, their hearts remain unconvinced. Hearing of others’ attainment, they claim mortal bodies cannot achieve sagehood—only after death might their souls find the Dao. This is perverse view, the practice of external and superficial methods.

Scholars of the higher learning, upon meeting such people, must not walk with them nor dwell beside them; they should keep far away. Such souls defile the good, peering and slandering, or mocking with jest. The true Dao abhors them—beware, do not associate with them.

Scholars of the higher learning vanish into forests and valleys, their traces lost in secluded mountains. They build huts by cliffs, forever leaving the world behind. They refine body and spirit, studying and savoring the supreme Dharma. Gathering and consuming fine medicines, when clothing and provisions are exhausted, they seek nothing from without—donning grass, absorbing qi, sustaining life.

These are no mere ascetics who scorn food and warmth, despising comfort and loathing the company of others, fearing their goodness may be corrupted. Thus they flee into the famous mountains to avoid harm.

In truth, the Great Dao is everywhere; yet the world’s trials make undivided focus impossible.

Time flows swiftly, life is hard to preserve—sudden impermanence arrives, and what use is regret?

The Perfected Youth further said: Long ago, on the southeast of Kunlun and the southern slopes of the Onion Range, there lived two men of like mind who, hearing of the Way of Life, desired to study it. For six years, they spoke of it constantly, expounding it to others. Yet in their village, they had previously worshipped evil spirits, and these spirits, resenting their change, waited for their moment of weakness. One night, they struck the two men dead, and the Way of Life was lost to them. Heaven, seeing their sincere intent, commanded the Four Offices to gather their souls and rebirth them among men, sparing them the trials of hell and swiftly restoring their human form. The two changed their surnames and were born into the Ji clan—one named Hongdao, the other Hongde. Through seven hundred rebirths, they have yet to meet a true master, drifting through the world of men, their original resolve forgotten, their hopes forever unfulfilled.

If you wish to study the Dao with sincerity, guard your words carefully. Do not let the vulgar know of it, lest evil men slander and envy you, and malevolent spirits bring harm. The Dao teaches: When one first begins to study the Way and the first signs of resonance appear, many celestial sages descend to their dwelling to instruct them. Heavenly spirits and divine attendants follow these sages as they journey among mortals. At such times, even lesser ghosts and gods are pressed into service. They also guard and protect the student of the Dao and their household, though their labors are arduous and they find no ease in it. Thus, when worldly men study the Dao, they fear the burdens of service and the loss of their freedom.

At that time, there was a student of the Dao in the Wudang Mountains named Zhu Yuan, who, with thirteen companions of like mind, dwelt in Wudang for three hundred and sixty-two years. They gathered and consumed pine and cypress, and their forms showed no sign of decay. Later, they entered Luhun and wandered to Mount Taishi, where they gathered and consumed secret stone mushrooms and herbs. Lacking the true scriptures, they relied solely on medicinal diets, yet their hearing and vision remained sharp, and their speed matched that of a galloping horse. For over seven thousand years, they dwelt in seclusion among the mountains, occasionally entering grotto-heavens to pay homage to later sages, their resolve never wavering for a moment. Later, the Queen Mother bestowed upon them the Mystic Frost and Jade Elixir, and in an instant, they ascended to heaven. To this day, they reside in the Great Clarity Heaven. The Cloud Palace Heavenly Worthy, wishing to strengthen their resolve, commanded the Left Perfected Attendant Youth to bestow upon them the two-character *Cloud Scripture*, which they now consume, attaining the rank of Upper Perfected.

Yet worldly men are foolish and dull. Before even ten days of study have passed, their hearts grow slack and they retreat. How can such as these, mere walking corpses, hope to glimpse the supreme Dao? Though the resolve of these thirteen did not falter, and though they lived out their days in secluded mountains, their hearts held no aspiration, nor did they seek out enlightened masters to receive the true essentials. They merely withdrew from the world, avoiding the dust and filth, consuming fine medicines to sustain their bodies. They committed no defilements, yet practiced no other disciplines—thus, they could not attain the true Dao in this very body. Had they sought out enlightened masters and received the true essentials, their Way would have been perfected far more swiftly, without the need for so many years.

The Dao teaches: When a student of the Dao encounters an enlightened master and practices the true essentials, if their past merits are insufficient and their karmic destiny is to perish, or if, by the blessings of former lives, the True Emperor takes pity on them, they may attain the true Dao in but a few days. Long ago, during the Water Kalpa, west of Kunlun there lived a Qiang tribesman named Fuduoli, of the Poshejiā clan. Morning and evening, he would bow from afar toward Kunlun, vowing with great resolve to attain immortality and deliverance from the world. After more than forty years of such devotion, he was visited by the Female Perfected Wang Qinxin, who descended from the Great Clarity Heaven to wander Kunlun. She lingered in the Lang Garden for ninety thousand great kalpas, often speaking of this man: "In the southwest below, the earth’s qi is foul and turbid, and men know only killing. The Qiang tribes are fierce and treacherous, untouched by the supreme teachings. Yet this man alone desires to hear the Great Dao."

Then the Female Perfected spoke thus to the Perfected Officials. The officials replied: "This is but a wild tribesman—he eats no flesh but raw meat, drinks no water but blood, and wears the stinking hides of sheep. The supreme Great Dao is not for his ears. If he is sincere, wait until his death, then transform his soul and rebirth him in the Central Kingdom. Only then, in a later life, may he attain the Dao." The Female Perfected said: "The supreme Great Dao is like a great forge, melting and refining heaven and earth, transforming all beings—even earth, wood, metal, and stone—into ashes. If this man has a sincere heart, why should he not be delivered?" Thus, the Female Perfected pleaded earnestly, and the Male Perfected Lord of the Dao finally consented.

Overjoyed, on the night of the eighth day of the fourth month, she commanded the Central Perfected Attendant Maiden to gather his spirit while he slept and bring it to the Lang Palace. There, she taught him the Way of Life, bestowing upon him the Five-Stone Elixir of Mystic Nourishment and the method of consuming harmonized qi and divine water. When he awoke, he recorded and recited what he had learned, committing it to memory without error. With wholehearted devotion, he practiced for over three thousand days, and in time, he attained the Way of the Middle Immortal. He was appointed to oversee the lower offices, ruling over the various tribes of the western lands. Those among them who aspired to the Dao, he instructed. He dwelt in the center of Dragon Mountain, yet could fly at will, his body emitting radiant light. On the four seasons and eight solar terms, he ascended to the Great Clarity Heaven to pay homage to the Female Perfected. His attainment of the Dao was by her power. Now, ten thousand kalpas have passed, and he remains there still.

Thus concludes Scroll Eight of the *Supreme Dao Jade Clarity Scripture*.
Beginning of Scroll Nine of the *Supreme Dao Jade Clarity Scripture*.

**The Illustrious Might Perfected’s Subjugation of Evil, Chapter Nineteen**

The Supreme Dao Lord of the Purple Chamber of Radiant Clouds in the Jade Clarity Heaven, bearing the title **Illustrious Might Perfected**, embodies the Way of compassion and forbearance, responding to the cries of sentient beings. Through great mercy, he accomplishes salvation, delivering those in peril and distress.

Ever abiding in concentrated spirit, nine hundred million great kalpas pass for him in but a single instant. Descending in responsive transformation, he flows into the Two Realms, traversing the paths of darkness and light, the hearts of high, middle, and low. Each receives the true primordial qi, riding upon a single faith to guide their bodies. None fail to submit, for he allows their great return without deviating from the constant.

From ignorance to wisdom, all are forged in the great crucible; though their natures are left to follow their course, none can transgress its bounds—save those who transcend by the Great Dao alone.

The Illustrious Might Perfected, grieving that the world does not emerge from suffering, extends his compassion to shelter them, teaching the Way of riding and submission, gradually guiding them toward non-action. At that time, the later-learned sages of the ten directions, along with ordinary mortals, beasts, and all manner of ghosts and spirits—every being that turns toward the Dao—save those who have attained the correct path, must follow the Great Dao in accordance with their portion, riding and submitting to converge upon the One Way.

Those who study the sagely path ride the wondrous qi of the Dao. Those who study worldly affairs ride the norms of the world, submitting to its laws. Yet when the form decays and the bones rot, the wandering soul drifts without cease. Each steers their qi to a single direction, clinging to what they know, monopolizing the Dao and hoarding its power.

Thus, the paths of sentient beings diverge, and their encounters differ. Those who ride the wondrous qi of the Dao shall surely attain true perfection; those who submit to evil ways shall inevitably decay and rot. The Supreme Great Dao, mourning their premature demise, thus bestows the wondrous qi of the Way of Life to nourish all existence.

Thereupon, the Supreme August Perfected of Primordial Times universally dispensed the transformative power of the Dao, revealing methods to counter afflictions and skillfully resolve the ailments of all beings. He sustained and upheld the sentient, expounding the **Orthodox Unity** to convert the lofty; the **Oath and Might** rites to sever the roots of evil, gathering the auspicious qi of celestial clouds to compose the script of **Yin Generation**, raising the withered bones. He established the celestial offices of the Upper Bureau to govern the multitudes.

The **Perfected King of Grand Medicine** revives the dead, cures chronic illnesses, mends what is broken, fills what is lacking, circulates the warp and weft of life, enriches the blood and replenishes the brain, restores hearing and sight, making the dull bright and clear. Teeth regrow, forms rejuvenate, and the longer one endures, the more youthful they become.

The **Illustrious Might Great Perfected**’s divine power is unimpeded; the Way of provisional and true holds no distinction of superiority or inferiority. His true and responsive bodies pervade the dusty realms; the might and spirit of his virtue remain unchanged from beginning to end. The forms that arise in response adapt to each kind, their voices myriad, their preferences likewise varied.

Yet the world below fails to comprehend, severing itself from its source. Within a single body, discord suddenly arises, deluded thoughts breed afflictions, and the omens of demonic spirits appear. Not understanding the great crucible and vast norms of the beginning, from the Middle Antiquity onward, purity and simplicity gave way to turbulence and deceit. Falsehoods surged forth, and all swiftly declined. The multitudes, pursuing evil paths in search of what is most fitting, rush about in turmoil and strife, unable to escape the mire. Content with their lot, how pitiful it is!

At that time, the Radiant and Majestic Great Perfected, perceiving the unbegun origin of the myriad things and penetrating their ultimate end, established in reverse the forms of awe and dignity, manifesting the true and correct for those to come above, rejecting the heterodox paths in speech. Thus, those who cultivate and practice are given a guiding standard for the heart, a precise and veritable pointer to reality, enabling them to discern the true from the false.

The distinction between true and false is established and immediately tested. The way of testing lies in what is called "walking the upright conduct, living the upright life, and practicing the upright Dao." The upright Dao heals the heterodox; the upright body does not falter, the upright conduct does not waver, the upright life is not cut short. A life not cut short means a life without end; a body that does not falter means returning to infancy after dust-and-kalpas; unwavering conduct means walking the conduct of the unsurpassed Dao.

By cultivating the true and veritable Dao of the Great Sage, refining and transforming body and spirit, exiting the realm of being and entering the realm of non-being, one forever severs the cycle of birth and death, and the manifold afflictions do not continue. With this very body, one attains the Dharma-body. Freed from the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, this is called "forever severing the cycle of birth and death."

Those who practice heterodox paths readily reveal their nature. How is this known? By knowing that the cultivation of the heterodox does not lead to rebirth in the undetermined; those who practice it grow old and die, unable to transform, causing people to revert to infancy with bones decayed, skin wrinkled, teeth fallen, hair whitened, hearing lost, sight dimmed, and swiftly rotting away. Turning their backs on the Dao and corrupting virtue, they revolve in heterodox customs, unable to transcend duality, unable to cast off afflictions. Like silkworms, they consume and traverse the world, deluding and confusing the foolish below, their bodies and lives not upright.

They boldly claim that after the transformations of the spirit and the dissolution into ashes, form departs and consciousness scatters, yet they call this the attainment of the supreme fruit—this is heterodox doctrine and cannot be relied upon. If one encounters such a person, one should not abandon them but, with skillful means, expound the path of life and deliver them.

The unsurpassed Great Dao pities all those who stray into heterodoxy, thus manifesting radiant majesty to point the way for the drowning and lost. Those who cherish the true make vast vows to cultivate and practice, concealing their bodies in secrecy, unmoved by the currents of the world. They rectify their demeanor, purify their conduct, veil their brilliance, and obscure their keen perception. Clad in garments light and wondrous, fragrant within and without, they make no distinction between noble and base, nor discern beauty from ugliness. They regard wine, sensuality, and wealth as putrid and foul, and such foul thoughts do not arise in them—how much less would they lightly transgress?

With but a single touch of body or heart, the true qi departs far away; how much more so with constant intimacy? Those who seek the Dao through familiarity with such things invite demonic spirits to seize the opportunity, bringing misfortune and harm in their wake, toppling and collapsing in an instant.

The Radiant and Majestic Great Perfected, foreseeing the calamities of the latter kalpas, saw that in the age of perverse heterodoxy, yin qi would arise, and in the turbid and evil world, such ways would easily flourish. With the loss of pure simplicity, frivolity and competition would surge. In the four heavens below, beings would style themselves as divine kings—such demons are called "heavenly spirits." The turbid and evil world would spread across the lower realms.

Beneath the four heavens, the spirits of mountains, forests, and stones would attach themselves to living people, imitating one another, calling themselves "immortal kings," along with the lingering demons of the six heavens. Together they would form factions, branching and dispersing, assuming names according to the times. Those who turn their backs on the Dao would offer them food and pray for blessings, yet these beings gnaw at people’s essence and qi, consume their blood and vessels, and diminish their lifespans. Unaware, people allow them to enter their bodies, where they can also cause people to loathe life and love death.

Should such spirits enter your body, your descendants multiply, your essence and qi grow strong and unyielding, and they traffic with the living. Demon-women and spectral insects can also cause people to expound upon the emptiness of all things, fostering jealousy toward the Way of life. If men or women study and cultivate the Dao, these malevolent spirits will vie to assail them, desiring their death to seize their souls and spirits, making them companions. For this reason, they despise the Way of life.

Later learners who attain the Dao in body will find these wicked spirits and their factions serving and obeying them, yet they will not gain true freedom. Thus, those who study the Dao must clearly recognize heterodox afflictions and know in advance the methods of radiant might to dispel and sever curses, protecting their form and spirit.

If there are those in the world who serve heterodox ways with unwavering devotion, the virtuous should employ skillful means to instruct and summon them, but if they refuse, one must not draw near nor heed their words. Why? Beginners in the Dao possess but faint power and cannot yet subdue the myriad heterodox paths. Therefore, one ought to respect them from afar.

At the great assembly of return, the supreme Dao will descend to teach and transform the world, displaying its majestic power to subdue the strong and unyielding. At that great convergence, merits and transgressions, heterodoxy and orthodoxy, will be distinctly judged, with no power to alter or reverse them.

Later learners who delight in the true Dao should first seek a luminous teacher, exploring the profound and far-reaching. Those who can advance in cultivation should focus intently on the supreme Way, while also comprehending worldly classics, mastering the breadth of texts, and weaving the warp and weft of scriptures. With unwavering mastery of even one art, they may ascend to discern the celestial canons. Those who clarify the profound meanings of the Dao, resolve all doubts upon inquiry, and distinguish heterodoxy from orthodoxy—though dwelling in the mundane realm—may be called sagely teachers.

Second-tier teachers, however, are unversed in worldly affairs and do not comprehend the profound meanings of the great Dao, adhering only to a single method. Yet those capable of guiding the world observe purity with utmost devotion, their resolve unshaken. They concentrate their spirit, uphold precepts, and vow never to commit evil. Such teachers align with the Dao, their essence and qi undispersed, easily achieving resonance. Their form steadfast and spirit congealed, they cultivate inner harmony, and before long—even in an instant—they ascend, flesh and bone together, forever attaining the true Dao. Though ranked second, they do not lose the title of luminous teacher.

Third-tier teachers lack definitive practices but embody compassion and forbearance, steadfastly upholding non-killing. They guide households and transform the people, healing illnesses, understanding radiant might, and acting without deceit. They regard neither wealth nor poverty, beauty nor ugliness, nobility nor lowliness, freely bestowing wealth and food. They cultivate equanimity, seeing others’ kin as their own and others’ bodies as their own. When they witness peril or hardship, they employ skillful means to deliver and stabilize. Seeing others suffer, they share their pain, cherishing them with earnest compassion and never abandoning them. Extending great mercy, they bury the dead and inter bones, diminishing their own clothing and food to aid the destitute. They practice filial piety throughout life, commit no wrongdoing, and harbor no resentment toward foes. They firmly believe in the unseen and do not neglect the empty chamber. Their nature aligns with the Dao, and heterodox qi naturally distances itself. They do not seek the Dao, yet the Dao comes to them.

The Dao states: Later generations of ordinary people who study and attain the Dao through such deeds have no such path. Men and women of later times who seek the Dao should first establish the methods of merit, of which there are many kinds.

The first merit is to propagate the Dao and transform beings, assisting the Son of Heaven and honoring one’s parents.

The second merit is to propagate the Dao and eliminate harm, overturning heterodoxy and eradicating falsehood.

The third merit is to extend filial piety to all—from the chirping and creeping to the grasses and trees.

The fourth merit is to endure hardship in secluded cultivation, serve a teacher to seek the Dao, consume elixirs with single-minded devotion, and maintain inner and outer purity.

The fifth merit is to establish retreats and conduct rituals, guiding those with karmic affinity, inviting teachers to pray for blessings, repenting transgressions, and supplying the needs of secluded cultivators of the true Dao—clothing, resources, medicine, food, bedding, incense, candles, and all requisites—ensuring nothing is lacking.

The sixth merit is to ransom and liberate lives, regardless of status or size, tracing the origins of aquatic beings, channeling flowing waters, and if no outlet exists, returning them to deep waters to revive. For flying and walking creatures—whether hatched, born, or transformed—if their nests or burrows collapse and their young cannot fend for themselves, one should skillfully repair and restore them, preventing terror and ensuring their survival. Such people are called worldly Dharma-teachers, relieving distress and aligning with the Dao’s virtue. The great Dao befriends them, freeing them from the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, ensuring eternal continuity, forever severing toil and affliction, with no further calamities. Such people grasp the essentials of seeking the Dao and the mechanism of attaining it.

The Dao states: Good men and women who establish merit have yet another method—mastering radiant might, discerning heterodoxy from orthodoxy, severing spectral insects, and beheading deceitful spirits. They wish for all beings to be free of illness, to dwell and move in peace, and to abide in forbearance. Though lacking formal cultivation, each upholds their duty.

Those who establish merit cherish all beings with equanimity. If they encounter afflictions of bias or heterodoxy, they diligently and tirelessly resolve them. Seated in the Dao-field, their benefits are boundless. They first instruct suffering beings: those afflicted by heterodox maladies should bathe to cleanse dust and filth, vow to practice the true and great Dao, refrain from heterodox thoughts, revere the Dao-field, regard the teacher as a father, don fresh and splendid attire, maintain inner and outer purity, burn fine incense, and pay homage to the teacher according to ritual. The teacher then reveals their heart’s suffering, invoking the majestic power of the great Dao and the life-spirits of true might—countless myriads—to dispel heterodoxy and eradicate falsehood.

The teacher, for the sake of beings, fully receives all methods: internally to cultivate the body, externally to save the world. The internal methods of the Dao include the Three Clarities’ treasured texts, cloud-script divine chapters, dragon charts and phoenix seals, and the nine qi’s trailing radiance.

With wholehearted cultivation, one’s might subdues heaven and earth. Such precious scriptures total thirty-six thousand great treasuries, each treasury containing thirty-six thousand sections of scripture, and each section inscribed upon thirty-six thousand slips of yielding jade. Yet to obtain even one of these true scriptures is sufficient—there is no need to receive in full the Three Clarities’ treasured texts. One need only single-mindedly cultivate the Three Clarities’ singular method to attain the Dao, transcend the mortal form, and achieve liberation. The evidence is visible before one’s eyes, the verification immediate.

The methods for saving the common folk do not involve the inner scriptures of the Heavenly Treasures. Rather, one receives the Register of Luminous Might and Life-Spirits, the Nine Heavens’ True Talismans, the Nine Heavens’ Military Talismans, the Nine Heavens’ Community Decrees, the Nine Heavens’ Divine Phoenix, the Nine Palaces’ Divine Sword, the Nine Palaces’ Divine Talismans, and the Mysterious Hand True Techniques. These dispel heterodoxy and sweep away demons, drive away ghosts and command spirits, ascend the cosmic net and tread the celestial tracks, traverse the Seven Luminaries in flying steps, bind the fierce and unruly, overawe the perverse and wayward, reverse winds and halt rain, gather and disperse dark mists, arrest the dawn and detain the sunlight, inhale and exhale the divine qi, and transform misfortune into fortune. These methods are the natural Dao of the Nine Heavens’ true qi, bestowed by the great sages in their compassion to save the common folk. The Nine Talismans and Life-Spirits preside over the nurturing of all sentient beings, responding below to the multitudes. All men and women who reverently believe in the supreme great Dao are protected by its might and numen. This might and numen are formed from the qi of true orthodoxy, pervading the vastness of empty space. Those who believe in the Dao and invoke blessings to dispel calamity find the might and numen arriving in an instant, as swift as echo follows sound. Though this might and numen are qi ascending to heaven and spirits suffusing form and appearance, they are called the bestowal of the great Dao, filling the entire world.

The true qi of the great Dao transforms into wind and clouds; its wondrous qi congeals into sweet dew; its compassionate qi becomes nourishing rain. It may manifest as sweet springs, fine wells, mountains and peaks, headwaters and streams, deep abysses, lush forests, medicinal herbs, crops and grains, fragrant trees, or flowers and fruits—providing the world’s resources and bestowing boundless benefit. Yet the foolish people of the lower world attribute the three luminaries of heaven and earth, the winds and thunder, clouds and rain, frost and dew, and the myriad phenomena of the void to spontaneous generation, not to the great Dao. Those who harbor such thoughts are deluded by heterodoxy. Seeking the true Dao, they will never attain it. They forget their roots, betray kindness and duty, lack compassion and caution, and indulge in violence and arrogance. They defy heaven and rebel against earth. Though they may briefly live, they will not die a proper death, but perish in suffering, mired in hardship and misery. Neither humans nor spirits pity them; ghosts and demons afflict them alike. Cast into the paths of heterodoxy, they drown in the cycle of birth and death. Like rotten wood that cannot be made firm or a boulder fallen into a thousand-fathom ravine, they cannot climb back up.

The vulgar and perverse will never revere the upright Dao, much less seek its essentials or aspire to transcendence. Alas for the common folk, forever severed from the Dao! The moment they lose the true, their conduct deviates by a hair’s breadth. Gradually, the distance widens until it is beyond sight, and they forget their origins entirely. The initial estrangement from the Dao, though they dwell in the vast furnace of the cosmos, in the realm of vessels and images, is already a departure from true orthodoxy. Like a wicked person whose fleeting glance is perverse, whose heart is not upright, whose yin blood seethes in darkness, and whose wrathful qi takes form—such a one harms body and life, and the source of suffering arises. Though physicians apply remedies with double effort, they cannot cure the illness. How much less can one who sinks into heterodoxy for a lifetime, never beholding the luminous might of the true and orthodox Dao, hope to live?

The Dao speaks: In the distant past, at the beginning of the kalpa of fire, the essence of Mount Rong transformed into a human form, its body adorned with all marks, and went forth to teach the world. It gathered eighty thousand disciples and instructed them in the worship of fire and the observation of water for twelve years. It absorbed the people’s essence-qi, causing them to lose their orthodoxy, and their heterodox views took root. At that time, the people, united in their resolve to die, each entered withered grass, knelt with hands clasped, removed their clothes and untied their sashes, and turned to one another to ignite the fire. The withered grass blazed fiercely, burning over eighty thousand people at once. Their hair singed, their skin split, blisters burst and fluids oozed, their hands and feet cramped and curled, writhing on the ground in agony. Though they regretted and repented, they could not utter a sound. Then the mountain spirit snapped its fingers in praise and said: “All living beings ultimately return to annihilation; the body of affliction is a chamber of a hundred poisons. You should swiftly depart and seek early liberation. Destroy this body to attain the Dharma-body. If you find the fire’s venom too fierce, then cast yourselves into the deep abyss.” After the mountain spirit spoke these words, the eighty thousand people crawled into the water, where wind and waves tossed them, and river creatures devoured them. The river spirits seized their souls, and the watery palaces enslaved their essence-spirits, condemning them to toil in suffering for over seven thousand years—still unrelieved to this day. Once ensnared by heterodoxy, they are bound to the cycle of birth and death.

At that time, the essence of Mount Rong, having led the common folk to their deaths, knew it had committed a sin. Fearing the great might above, it hid deep within the stone. In spring, it encountered the Thunder God, who split the rock and dragged it forth, compelling it to serve the dragons day and night in toil, never free. To dispel such powerful spirits, one may command the Thunder Duke to sever and rend them—no need to trouble the celestial officials’ might and numen, nor expend the true and wondrous qi of the great Dao, nor invoke the might of the Dao’s life-spirits. The heterodox will vanish of their own accord.

At that time, there were also the island barbarians of Liaodong, among whom the essence of an iron bell transformed into a human form and went forth to teach the world. Its methods spread through eighty-one countries, causing people to weep at birth and sing at death. The elderly were called “ghostly simples” and abandoned in the wild grasslands to hasten their deaths. These barbarians have practiced such customs for over three thousand years. The abandoned elders starve to death in the desolate marshes, lying in wretched disarray. The Perfected of Luminous Might, moved by their suffering, dispatched five hundred million Vajra youths to dissolve the iron essence and all tree demons. They imposed the Way of filial piety and the method of nurturing the elderly to save the common folk.

At that time, the iron essence resumed its form, and the Vajra youths buried it deep in the earth, pressing it down with divine talismans of the Seven Treasures, where it remains to this day. Should later students of the Perfected seek to dispel this essence, they must summon the Vajra youths in their billions and myriads to annihilate the demonic essence, which will then dissolve and vanish of itself.

At that time, there also arose in the southwest a mountain spirit of the Iron Enclosure in the Metal Quarter, which took human form and went forth to teach the world. Its methods spread through the wild barbarian lands and a hundred countries, branching into over five hundred variations. These were called the Outer Ways. They worshipped all manner of images—Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, wind and water, metal and wood, furnaces and fires, city walls and roads—and practiced various austerities, altering their garments and even their forms. They erected statues for worship, inscribed scriptures on leaves, mutilated their bodies, donned barbarian attire, and observed prohibitions and incantations. Entering towns to beg, each claimed their way led to the supreme fruit. They offered blood sacrifices and invoked the Heavenly Kings, or styled themselves as Brahmin masters, specializing in slaughter to present offerings to the celestial spirits, hoping to gain abundant blessings and worldly wealth. Each declared: "Whoever makes offerings to me shall receive boundless merit."

Such Outer Ways clung to human bodies, wailing and shrieking, tearing out their hair, leaping and flinging themselves about, seeking death to extinguish themselves. Some sat in silent darkness, gazing intently at luminous visions, claiming to behold great sages or witness all manner of karmic signs. When common folk heard of this, they competed to make offerings, surrendering treasures, wives, children, servants, horses, cities, fields, and dwellings—or even their own lives, heads, eyes, marrow, and brains—without the slightest reluctance. These Outer Ways taught their followers to love death, and whenever someone died, they would sing praises and hymns, abandoning the corpse in the wilderness, calling it "ascension to Heaven." Gathering in worship, they rejoiced and exclaimed: "Great beings and lofty souls, weary of the world and seeking deliverance, become like birds and beasts, their consciousness dissolving into Heaven. No more afflictions—how joyous indeed!"

Among the austerities of these Outer Ways was the Great Fire Heap, where they declared: "If any good man or woman enters the fire and burns their body, they are called the foremost great beings, freed from afflictions, attaining the supreme fruit, and reaching the realm of eternal bliss and purity, ascending to the unshakable abode of everlasting joy." These Outer Ways praised such great beings as heroic and unmatched in virtue and power, claiming they brought the greatest benefit to the world. Foolish people, seeing this, vied to burn themselves. At that time, the wandering spirits of the Outer Ways soared through the air, singing praises and performing all manner of music to delight their senses. Across a hundred barbarian domains, over decades, more than half were maimed or ruined by the deceptions of these Outer Ways.

Should later students wish to eradicate these heterodox paths, they must cultivate the method of Orthodox Unity, wielding great divine might to subdue them. With the wondrous qi of the Great Dao and the true power of the Life-Generating Spirit, they shall cast them out. The mortal forms of the Outer Ways will naturally submit, and their demonic essences will dissolve of themselves. Should later students seek to destroy this evil, they must skillfully employ the Way of the Fire Bell, and the evil will perish in an instant. Though these Outer Ways pursue the supreme fruit, they shall never attain it, for the path of self-destruction is not the true attainment. This is called the way of the walking corpse, the path of falsehood and deceit.

Within the teachings of the Great Dao, there are also such people—those whose hearts are restless, whose conduct is unrighteous, and whom wayward spirits possess. These too are called Outer Ways. Such people cannot distinguish truth from falsehood or purity from impurity; they are inherently drawn to demonic influences. With their hearts already biased, the Great Dao cannot flow through them. Instead, seductive spirits enter their minds, and they abhor the Way of Life. Later students must carefully discern this and purify all defilements with the qi of the Dao. They should invoke the Celestial Enforcers of Might, the Five Divisions of Divine Generals—each with fifty thousand multicolored soldiers—and five hundred million troops to widely establish Daoist altars, shattering the malevolent trials until they dissolve and vanish.

At that time, among the fifty-five barbarian states of the northern lands, a ten-thousand-year-old fox spirit transformed into a king, ruling east of Mount Kunlun. It seduced many women, fathering fox cubs, and its descendants flourished, filling all the lands. They bewitched and killed people, devoured livestock, and manifested all manner of strange lights and apparitions, gathering in powerful bands. The forms of their bewitchment included transforming into beautiful women or men to consort with humans, or even impersonating their relatives. At times, they would shave people’s heads, causing them to lose their minds, rave madly, and babble incoherently. They could also make people despise life and delight in killing, despise their own bodies, and suffer stabbing pains in their hearts and bellies, alternating between emaciation and swelling. Though clever and discerning by day, they would hide and roam at night, drawn to bright colors and preferring solitude.

Their transformations resembled those of tree spirits, flourishing in spring and autumn, fading in winter. Yet tree spirits are easily dispelled—simply have the Thunder God strike them with lightning, and they vanish of themselves. Later students must carefully discern fox spirits. To expel them, one should use a divine sword forged from western barbarian gold, secretly carried on the person, and swiftly employ the Way of the Fire Bell and the Shooting Star. Invoke the Life-Generating Spirit’s divine might, summoning billions of celestial cavalry to shatter the strong spirits and strike down the fox demons. At the sound, they will tremble and prostrate themselves, fleeing for ten thousand miles, their illusory arts naturally collapsing. For those pregnant with fox fetuses that have not yet dissolved, invoke the divine soldiers to heal them. Jade maidens bearing medicines of the Five Directions, along with needles, knives, fire, and moxa, shall enter their bodies, treating each ailment accordingly to swiftly cause the fetuses to crumble and fall.

Thus, the qi of the Dao flows freely, the primordial wind spreads, the demonic fetuses dissolve, and the Way of Life quietly prepares. When the Supreme Sages heal, the cure is instantaneous; when superior practitioners heal, it takes ten days to take effect. Such afflicted individuals have hollowed marrow and obstructed blood vessels. Teach them to calm their minds, uphold the scriptures and precepts, and they will gradually recover, freed from their bonds and at ease.

For those afflicted with grave illness, instruct them to devote themselves to the Dao. The master shall transmit the luminous might and demon-expelling methods, so that they may meditate morning and evening, offer incense and lamps, and uphold the master’s teachings as if standing before the imperial throne.

At that time, the Luminous Might Perfected, moved by great compassion, revealed this orthodox method and disseminated it throughout the mortal realm. Upon hearing of this, all stubborn spirits trembled in awe, their forms vanishing without trace, no longer daring to stir. In that moment, no need arose for striking or severing, for all demonic spirits willingly submitted, aiding and serving the true.

The Great Dao, in its boundless mercy, could not bear to annihilate them. Thus, it bestowed the method of luminous might, passing it down to later disciples to guard against all spectral and demonic beings. Should any transgress or offend the true and orthodox, later disciples must follow the correct method, severing and destroying them, eradicating the demonic and dissolving the malevolent spirits, so that those of true faith may find guidance in their hearts, and all beings rely upon this for peace and stability.

Wherever this scripture resides, it shall be cultivated by those of moral integrity, aiding the Dao in its flourishing and transformation, protecting and nurturing all beings without regard to rank or status, nor seeking recompense for their noble deeds. The Supreme Sages observe from afar, befriending the virtuous path, while the netherworld records their merits, ensuring their blessings are complete. The unsurpassed Great Dao sends forth divine beings to guard and protect them.

Wherever such a master dwells, all people and spirits shall revere them. None may slight, mock, curse, strike, or steal their possessions and sustenance, lest the celestial and terrestrial deities immediately impose punishment. Such a master, steadfast in mind and upright in conduct, aligns with the Dao as one. All people should bow in reverence, honoring them with utmost sincerity, as one would honor Heaven. Why is this so? Though such a master dwells temporarily in the world, their virtue merges with the celestial truth, and their might can command even Heaven, which itself holds them in awe. For this reason, all people should rise in reverence, esteeming their power. They govern Heaven and Earth, deliver boundless salvation, their merit equaling creation itself, their Daoist might beyond compare.

All men and women should cultivate a heart devoted to the Great Dao in the presence of such a master, aspiring that all people may study under them and attain the supreme Dao.

When the Luminous Might Perfected expounded this method, the demonic palaces trembled, spectral beings lost their essence, auspicious winds and felicitous clouds spread throughout the mortal realm, thunderous Dharma rains and Dharma storms moistened the four heavens, and medicinal herbs and trees bloomed in season. Deviant paths returned to orthodoxy, and the five demonic spirits vanished without trace.

At that time, the voice and radiance of the Luminous Might Perfected resounded far and wide, drawing the yearning gaze of all in the ten directions. Beneath the four heavens, men and women burned incense, prostrated themselves, and raised their aspirations to Heaven, praying for the Great Dao to descend into the mortal world, manifesting in form to fulfill their longing.

Then, the king of Da Qin, Yiqiruoti, beheld the true radiance and fixed his mind upon it, fasting for seven days without food, declaring: "If the Great Dao responds to me from afar, I shall renounce the burdens of my kingdom and leave the world to follow the Dao."

At that time, an outsider from Rinan named Fotuoli, leading six thousand disciples—shaven-headed and bare-bodied, bearing a single brazier of fire—entered the kingdom. The gatekeepers reported this to the king, who emerged to bow in reverence, mistaking him for a true master. He welcomed Fotuoli into the city, providing morning and evening offerings, neglecting the affairs of state. The king followed Fotuoli in leaving the world to seek the Dao, commanding him to bow morning and evening before the brazier. All men and women in the kingdom likewise worshipped the fire. The fire spirits flourished, gradually seizing the king’s heart. The king and his entire realm embraced death, each making vows to immolate their bodies in pursuit of the supreme Dao. The king and his ministers set the eighth day of the fourth month as the appointed time to gather firewood and burn themselves.

Moved by the king’s ignorance, the Luminous Might Perfected commanded the Dragon King of the Northern Sea and the Great General Xuanwu to ride the vast ocean waters to the southern lands. Six feet above the ground, they covered all of Da Qin, remaining for a full month. The outsider and the king had no chance of survival; fire vanished from the kingdom, and the people ate raw mutton. The fire spirits and their demonic essence naturally dissolved.

The king grew doubtful and addressed the outsider, saying: "Master, I have heard that in the northwest, there are masters and disciples who worship the water deity. Could this be a test sent by them?"

At that time, the outsider and his followers trembled in fear, unable to compose themselves, and replied: "Great King, you should know that there are over five hundred heterodox methods, each with its own fruition, ascending to the Brahma Heaven. Why should there be only one path to the Dao? Now, I and the king shall turn our hearts to serve the water."

Then, all men and women, young and old, in the kingdom wholeheartedly turned to revere the water. After another month, at the second watch of the night, a voice suddenly arose from the water, saying:

*"Though the Great Dao has no form,
It responds like an echo or shadow.
The void of space knows no bounds,
Yet perceptions arise from the mind’s eye.
Water and fire harm your life,
Trapping souls in dark abodes.
The cloud palaces’ carefree infants
Float aloft on the qi’s breeze.
Alas, those who follow deviant paths,
Lost in the dusty snares of delusion.
Grieve for the coming of old age and death,
Who shall reward your decay and ruin?
Why not seek longevity,
In an instant, traversing Heaven and Earth?
Form and spirit suddenly ascend,
Essence and qi forever radiant and vast."*

Upon hearing the true sound, the king and the outsider immediately delved into its meaning. After seven days, their minds suddenly awakened, their lifeless corpses transforming into fragrant remains. They listened to the true and correct teachings, perceiving the upper realms clearly, undeterred by the divine waters. They chanted the sublime sound, sat in silent emptiness, free from deviant thoughts, their minds fixed solely on the Great Dao. After a thousand days, the incense of their hearts ascended, and they sought the master’s guidance.

Then, the Luminous Might Perfected, moved by compassion, beheld their Dharma bodies and luminous forms, and expounded the teachings to the king. The king, Fotuoli, and nine hundred million followers and ministers all attained the Dao at once, ascending into the void, freed from the cycle of birth and death.

After the king of Da Qin attained the Dao, he earnestly entreated the Perfected to expound the method for later generations to dissolve the calamities of the five directions.

The Perfected One declared: The Dao’s method values only long life, aiding the nation and sustaining destiny, delivering the multitudes. To turn from the Dao is to lose life—self-wearied in joy and sorrow, unable to assist or protect all living beings. For this reason, the Supreme Great Dao brings forth the Way to purge the qi of death. Cultivate it with utmost sincerity, and your virtue will move Heaven and Earth. Yet if one merely practices superficial rituals without true devotion, nothing can be achieved, and the five kinds of calamities will not be dispelled.

Those who study the Dao must wholeheartedly aid the nation, performing fasts and rites to avert disasters, earnestly seeking divine response. The master should face the afflicted direction, take seven catties of fine realgar, seal it in a concealed vessel, and sink it into the depths of an abyss—let no one witness this. Inscribe the true scripture in gold upon jade tablets, and enshrine them in the five directions of the nation and within sacred mountains, in secluded cliffs and deep caves. Through fasting and prayer, invoke blessings for the Son of Heaven and all the people. If auspicious signs appear—divine incense wafting, winds stilling the branches, the four limits purified—then great fortune will respond, the nation’s destiny will endure, and the world will know peace.

At such times, the king should ascend the altar to petition Heaven, live in humble palaces and eat simple fare, let his grace flow throughout the land, show compassion to the aged and infirm, extend benevolence to all creatures, and refrain from harming any sentient being. Such a ruler rightfully occupies the throne of Heaven.

Those who study the Dao should follow this scripture, admonish the Son of Heaven, and may also provide abundant support, establishing long fasts in renowned mountains, secretly practicing the supreme method for the sake of the ruler and the people. This is called "hidden virtue," prized for its lack of ostentation. Practicing the supreme method while associating with the high and noble risks disturbing the mundane world; one may avoid transgressions and proceed smoothly.

Those who study the Dao must share virtue with the ruler, together serving all the people under Heaven. If their virtue differs, and they forcibly practice our Way, Heaven will not assist them, and their efforts will be in vain.

The Dao states: Those who study the Dao must possess ten virtues:
1. The first virtue: discerning truth from falsehood, not practicing blindly;
2. The second virtue: delving deeply into the supreme method, exhausting all wondrous gates;
3. The third virtue: steadfastly upholding precepts, the mind not wandering;
4. The fourth virtue: reciting sacred teachings, the mind free from doubt;
5. The fifth virtue: practicing kindness, filial piety, forbearance, and humility, not contending with others;
6. The sixth virtue: diligently performing rituals, the mind never lazy or negligent;
7. The seventh virtue: employing the Dao with gentleness, conducting oneself with subtlety;
8. The eighth virtue: courageously advancing in the Dao, undeterred by peril;
9. The ninth virtue: subduing external demons, liberating oneself from entanglements;
10. The tenth virtue: rescuing oneself from mortal peril, enduring eternally.

The Dao states: Those who study the Dao yet cannot escape mortal peril, who do not depart from deviant methods, have not attained the true Way. Though they may be called men of resolve, they possess no power of the Dao, cannot abide forever, and are swayed by external things. They are not called Daoists but heretics, no different from the common folk.

Those who vainly debate wisdom, forcefully expounding on emptiness without embodying the Dao’s essence, whose four great elements scatter, cannot preserve life. Their hun and shen drift and wander, meeting and relying on chance, drifting for countless kalpas, unable to attain the Dao. Pity the walking corpses of this world, mourning their loss of life—aging, dying, decaying, their spirits wearied in endless rebirth.

There are ten causes for losing the true Way:
1. Losing alignment with the correct path;
2. Deepening sin;
3. Inertia;
4. Deviance and perversity;
5. Arrogance and violence;
6. Heaviness and turbidity;
7. Restless competition;
8. Carelessness;
9. Cowardice;
10. Self-conceit.

These ten things can ruin the true Dao. They all stem from losing alignment with the correct path, branching into endless evils. Practicing the true method, however, branches into myriad transformations, wondrously hidden in the profound, also without end.

Those who study the Dao, establishing merit and building virtue, diligently cultivating the Way of life, distance themselves from mortal peril. On the day their practice is perfected, the true Dao will manifest, and they will be led to roam together.

The Supreme Great Dao cherishes life and abhors killing. Those who cherish life can attain our Dao; those who delight in killing lose our Dao. It is people who turn away, not the Dao that rejects them. The Great Dao is without intent, responding to those who can practice. Those who cannot practice the Dao, the Dao also responds to them—responding with the two paths of yin and yang, life and death. Prosperity and decay, success and failure, entry and exit, rise and fall differ; sorrow and joy oppose each other. Though the Dao constantly seeks to guide and receive, it cannot compel those who refuse. Alas, the common folk, perishing without return, pursue life as if pursuing death.

Heaven bestows cloud chariots to float through the void. If only they loved the Dao as they love wealth and sensual pleasures, Perfected Ones would be their companions, and all spirits their servants. If only they practiced gentleness as they practice harshness, even after dust kalpas as infants, they would never be harmed.

Those who study the true Way, chanting and cherishing this scripture, guarding themselves with precepts, will remain free from misfortune throughout their lives and surely ascend to transcendence.

The Dao states: Before ascending, those who study the Dao still dwell in the human world. They should pity all living beings, dispel their disasters, sustain their lives—this virtue is immense, the foremost merit.

When a region suffers calamity, the master should establish hundreds or thousands of Daoist sanctuaries, purifying the area with fragrant water, setting up altars and seats, placing scriptures and images, guiding the people to take refuge. They should burn incense, light lamps, and perform rites in the six periods, their hearts sincere and earnest, not relying on empty words. Speaking softly and humbly, they should not let the crowd hear.

The master should invoke the Great Dao, explaining the origins of the impending disaster. Then, summon the mighty deities of the five directions:
- In the East: the Nine Azure Dragon Generals, with eighty-one myriad followers;
- In the South: the Three Vermilion Bird Generals, with sixty-four myriad followers;
- In the West: the Seven White Tiger Generals, with thirty-six myriad followers;
- In the North: the Five Dark Warrior Generals, with twenty-five myriad followers.

In the Center: the Twelve Yellow Qilin Generals of Wu and Ji, with ninety thousand followers. Arraying the celestial instruments, they descend into the altar, moving their divine power to extinguish demons and revive the living. According to the source of the illness, the divine prescriptions counter it.

The master should make vows and recite prayers, pitying the sick as a mother loves her child, wishing them freedom from disease. He must strictly command the altar’s order, ensuring all matters are solemn and reverent. Avoid consuming pungent meats, fish, or flesh; male and female impurities; filthy or greasy clothing; discussing heterodox teachings; or acting with arrogance. If the heart is not sincere and reverent, the Dao of Heaven will not assist, evil spirits will not be vanquished, the illness will not be cured, and misfortune will instead befall.

Within the ritual space, fragrant water should be sprinkled every three to five days to purify the area. Those who have not bathed may not enter. Each altar remains active for several ten-day periods before being dissolved. The master does not compel attendance; those who come do so of their own will. For those too ill to perform the rites, they may remain in the world, and it is not strictly required that the sick person perform the rituals themselves. They may stand and observe, and as long as efficacy is achieved, conventional rules need not be rigidly followed.

The Dao states: The methods for healing demonic afflictions comprise three types:
1. Those whose aspiration is to leave the household life but who have not yet understood the precepts and rituals, their intentions biased and perverse, with demonic influences entering their hearts—these must be healed. Without healing, they will not recover. For such persons, sincerity of heart and fragrant water alone suffice. The poor may offer incense with a straightforward heart.
2. Those who devote themselves wholeheartedly to the Dao but have not yet received the Register of Life, practicing long-term abstinence and austerities, their merit and virtue not yet established, suddenly afflicted by misfortune and entering the ritual space—these require offerings of incense, lamps, rice, wood, herbs, and fruit, presented three times.
3. Those who feign devotion to the Dao but harbor heterodox intentions, their bodies stricken with illness and seeking healing, entering the ritual space—these must be assessed for sincerity and strictly follow the rules of the jiao rites. They must also offer silk as tribute, according to their wealth, to repay the grace of the Dao, providing the master with ritual implements, robes, and furnishings for his dwelling. They must further purchase medicine and food to offer to the poor and sick who cannot sustain themselves, ransom lives, and buy incense and oil for temple repairs. None of these may be used for secular purposes; violators will be afflicted with illness for ten days. After ten days, the benevolent spirits will depart, and their learning will not succeed.

If the sick person is not single-minded, their thoughts scattered, or if they violate purity taboos, fail to acknowledge their transgressions, or disobey the master’s teachings, their illness will not be cured. They will immediately face divine retribution, and no physician in the world can save them.

Those who study the Dao and establish merit and virtue, though not yet discerning in reclusive cultivation, must heal the sick in the world with caution and trepidation, as if dwelling in a famous mountain, their hearts no different in devotion. When summoned by others, they must not shirk labor or make excuses, such as claiming prior engagements, being called away after being summoned, or feigning absence. Those who feign illness, harbor suspicions, despise the poor or lowly, covet rewards, demand payment or offerings to sustain personal expenses, or refuse to aid the critically ill will be afflicted with illness for a hundred days. The benevolent spirits will depart, they will be tormented by evil forces, and no physician in the world can save them.

The Dao states: Among those who study the Dao, the Way may be shallow or deep, and virtue may be superior or inferior. If one encounters an enlightened master, they should submit humbly at their feet; or if they meet a perfected being descending to the world; or if the blessings of nine generations flow to them; or if in a past life they practiced the Dao but their merit was incomplete, briefly passing through the Great Yin to be reborn in a royal kingdom—taking advantage of this opportunity, they receive the precious scriptures in full, the royal qi pervading their body, divine might guarding their form. They will no longer undergo birth and death, attaining the perfection of the Dao.

Before ascending, they may wander the mortal realm, their disciples numerous but not yet pure and refined. If they suddenly become impure, purification is required. In such cases, their divine might is of no use; they need only chant the sacred verses to repel demons and recite the great history of the Supreme Sovereign. Their hearts soar with crimson qi, their eyes race like shooting stars. They wield the divine golden sword and illuminate with the round celestial mirror. Or they may sit in lofty stillness within an empty hall, guarding the truth with utmost sincerity. Internally, they visualize and petition without uttering a word. The Three Caverns generate the divine, weaving the warp and weft of concealment. Thus, the six evils are extinguished externally, the five poisons dissolved internally. The hearts of host and guest feel no fatigue, and whatever they undertake encounters no obstacles.

Such masters possess vast and mighty power, and all demonic spirits become their attendants and guards. If any disciples, male or female, have not yet dissolved their karmic obstructions, the supervisors of wrongdoing will censure them, and they may face divine retribution. The master, with compassion, intercedes on their behalf, pleading for the nine generations above and the individual below. If they wholeheartedly repent, there is nothing that cannot be resolved.

The Dao states: No transgression is greater than lewdness, killing one’s parents, or harming one’s master. These sins are extreme and cannot be repented or absolved. One will forever sink into the realms of suffering, with no hope of escape; never beholding the Dao, never hearing the Dharma—how then could one attain the Dao?

Those who study the Dao and all laypeople should cultivate right faith, compassion, filial piety, and obedience. They must not harbor perverse thoughts, turn their backs on the Dao, or forget righteousness. Whether advancing or retreating, they will face inconceivable punishment. If any worldly person or scripture claims that the sins of killing parents or one’s master can be repented, they are still fit for the Dao—this is the teaching of jealous ghosts and demons, the instruction of evil spirits, the words of the deranged. The Great Dao does not acknowledge this, Heaven and Earth do not pardon it. Evil ghosts will punish them with boiling cauldrons and burning coals, and they will forever lose the human realm.

Even the wanton killing of the smallest creatures possessing life and spirit is not pardoned by Heaven—how much less the deliberate, treacherous killing of one’s master? Those who study the Dao should proclaim these precious scriptures, opening the ears and eyes of the common people, making them universally known. The merit of this is incomparable and immeasurable.

The Dao states: At the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, during the kalpa of fire, there was a country called Liaoqiu in the midst of the sea, over seventy thousand li west of Huoqiu. There lived a Daoist named Qian Zhong, surnamed Wen, who at the age of twelve left home to seek the Dao. He observed the precept against killing, healed the sick, released living beings, was filial to his parents, and revered his masters and teachers.

Though he had not yet donned the talismans of immortality, by establishing merit and virtue with unwavering resolve, he had already attained his goal from beginning to end. After twenty-seven years, his merit moved the heavens, and within his oratory, perfected beings would often descend, altering their forms to appear as commoners. The spirits of earth and water served as his attendants, aiding in the preparation of rituals and bestowing upon him divine medicines to cure chronic ailments effortlessly. The efficacy of his touch was like hot water melting snow; cutting down demonic spirits required no exertion. He amassed great merit and virtue, taking pity on the poor and the sick.

The Heavenly Worthy of the Cloud Palace, moved by his diligence and knowing his resolve would not falter, on the seventh day of the first month commanded the Radiant Might Perfected to transmit to him the Dao of long life, enabling him to merge with the luminous and ascend to the void. He was conferred the title of Perfected and appointed to govern in the Thirty-Fourth Heaven, having already endured eight hundred million great kalpas. His form reverted to that of an infant, and he could extend his hand to traverse the entire world. The Great Dao, recognizing the vastness of his virtue, decreed that ten years hence, the Five Dragon Kings would elevate his dwelling. Ninety-seven individuals—men and women, high and low—were relocated to the Supreme Purity Heaven, all attaining deathlessness. His merit and virtue were immense, blessing his entire household.

For ordinary people who fail to liberate even themselves, how can their seven ancestors and parents rely on them to escape sin and be reborn among humans? Such a wonder is beyond comprehension.

The Dao states: Those who study the Dao and amass great merit and virtue move the Great Dao to compassion. Thus, their dwellings are raised aloft, and all their household possessions and livestock endure, spared from the calamities of death. This is not because there are no golden towers and jade chambers in the heavens above, but rather that the divine power is revealed through expedient means to ordinary people, urging them to distance themselves from heterodox paths, transcend the laws of decay, aging, and death, and escape the impermanent realms of the evil world—abodes of affliction—to attain the unchanging Dharma of eternal bliss.

Good men and good women, once their hearts embrace faith, across countless kalpas, there will be worthy ones in the world who study the supreme Dao, and their dwellings shall ascend to the void all at once. Good men and women, you should reflect upon this rare occurrence, turn your hearts toward faith, and know that all ordinary people can attain the Dao. Those who lose the true essentials in their study will fail to attain the Dao, but those who cultivate and grasp the truth—there has never been a single one who did not become a sage. The supreme Great Dao’s verification is immediate; why then the need for earnest exhortation?

*Thus concludes the ninth scroll of the Jade Purity Scripture of the Supreme Great Dao.*
*Here begins the tenth scroll of the Jade Purity Scripture of the Supreme Great Dao.*

**Chapter Twenty: The Dharma Seal**

At that time, in the Jade Palace of the Mystic Terrace, the True Person of Central Harmony addressed the later learners. On the seventh day of the seventh month, a grand assembly was held at the Wheel of Kunlun’s Jade Terrace, where they remained for three months. On the seventh day of the tenth month, another grand assembly convened upon the Golden Altar of Kunlun.

The essence of the Morning Star shone in the evening, its divine torch illuminating the radiance of yang’s brilliance, scattering its glow in lingering light. After another three months, on the seventh day of the first month, at the inception of the Supreme Mystery’s primordial origin, the qi of the Azure Heavens flowed into the myriad forms, marking the beginning of all transformations and the inception of Central Harmony’s flux. The True Person of Central Harmony, activating the Three Origins, initiated the first of the Three Assemblies. On this auspicious day, they paid homage to the Supreme Emperor.

At that time, the True Person of Central Harmony, along with a dharma assembly of thirty-six thousand exalted perfected beings, all rode upon the Wheel of the Orthodox Unity and Central Harmony. Their true essence and numinous authority led the way, with cloud-dragons guiding the path, celestial serpents flanking the procession, and the great demons of the Three Realms soaring through the air in chariots. The four divisions of numinous immortals bore aloft flying canopies. The incense officials wafted smoke, burning soul-reviving incense; dragons chanted and phoenixes sang, harmonizing with the celestial melody. A divine breeze gently stirred, circulating in perfect harmony. Fragrant flowers, banners, and canopies drifted upward in graceful ascent. The entire dharma assembly, with divine feet treading the void, moved without effort, as light and effortless as drifting clouds. In an instant, they ascended before the Dharma Gate of the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Purity.

At that time, during the morning audience of the perfected beings of the upper realms, they paid homage to the Heavenly Worthy and then proceeded to the Right Cloud Palace of the Jade Purity to offer reverence to the Great Compassionate True Emperor. As time passed into the hour of *si*, the assembly of exalted immortals from the ten directions gathered to pay homage to the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy. As time passed into midday, the lower immortals and celestial officials of the upper bureaus reviewed the registers of immortals. As time passed into the hour of *zi*, the officials of the Water and Fire Bureaus recorded the ledgers of life and death.

The Heavenly Worthy, for the sake of all sentient beings, also designated the three origin months, with the fifteenth day of each month as the time for the Three Bureaus to present their audience. For later learners offering homage, the seventh day of the first month of the Three Origins suffices, where morning and evening they may recite vows, repent transgressions, and seek blessings.

The Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Two August True Emperors are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth, the primordial root of all transformations. All later learners and sages trace their origin to the Dao of compassion. When paying homage and contemplating, one must first practice compassion. For this reason, throughout the ten directions of the cosmos, in the heavens above and the earth below, all beings—ordinary and sacred—speak of the Great Compassion and Great Mercy as the true teaching, the Dao of the Two Emperors’ compassion. Yet the worldly beings below grasp only its branches, rarely recognizing its root. If the officials of the Three Bureaus fail to pay homage to the Two August Ones during the four seasons and eight solar terms, they lose the Dao of compassion and cannot nurture the myriad beings.

Thus, Heaven covers and Earth bears all things without refusal. Above, the Dao of compassion of the Three August Ones and the titles of the Two August Ones are bestowed upon the ordinary folk of the lower realms—what is called "compassionate parent" is modeled upon this. All sentient beings who attain the Dao of compassion can nurture and raise the multitude of life. Though they may not universally attain the singular heart of the Great Dao, they can, like the Great Dao, nurture all that moves and grows. If all beings endowed with qi lacked compassion, they could not even sustain themselves—how then could they nurture the myriad things?

Therefore, those who study the higher teachings must first embody compassion, for then their cultivation becomes easily accomplished, and their words are heard on high. Even ordinary beings with sincere hearts may cultivate the supreme Dao in seclusion, and the Dao will respond to them. Thus, the four divisions of lower immortals do not waver in their resolve for the Dao. I perceive their aspiration and, through expedient means, guide them to ascend to the Jade Purity and pay homage to the True Emperor. Our assembly of perfected beings should spiritually commune, ever attending the Two August Ones as intimate companions. Though separated by thirty-six thousand heavens and earths, it is as if we dwell together in a single chamber, never feeling distant. Why is this so?

The ten directions and dust-like worlds share a single Dao-body. For this reason, in the ten directions of the cosmos, not a single thing or dharma can depart from the Dao-body; all sentient beings are the Dao-qi of the Two August Ones. Therefore, I lead the lower immortals to ascend to the upper realms, to pay homage and offer felicitations to the Two August Ones, to bow in reverence and inquire after their well-being, and to request the immortal seal, teaching and awakening later students.

At that time, the Perfected of Central Harmony, together with his attendants, prostrated at the cloud-gate, bowing for a long while. Burning incense and concentrating in mind, before any words took form, another long interval passed. Such a long while had elapsed that, in the lower worlds, ninety thousand great kalpas had already transpired.

Gazing upward into the cloud-palace, one saw emptiness and whiteness, clarity and vastness, solitude and brightness, purity and brilliance. Only nine-colored felicitous clouds draped and encircled it, their radiant hues intermingling in a display beyond compare. Within the void, true qi congealed into celestial scriptures, pervading the realm of the Dao. The characters were distinct and clear, easy to discern upon careful observation, yet those who recited them lightly could not comprehend their meaning.

The perfected immortals, concentrating in mind on the Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, wished to express their heart’s desire and spoke thus: “We pray for later students, that their doubts and entanglements be severed, and that the Heavenly Worthy bestow the Dharma-seal from his golden mouth.” Having spoken these words, they fell silent for a long while.

Suddenly, before the cloud-dragon throne of the Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, the incense smoke from the hundred-jeweled censer rose of its own accord, like the divine peaks exhaling great clouds—thick, luxuriant, and billowing, spreading throughout other realms. Heavenly flowers flew through the air, cloud-dragons danced in the void, sweet dew gently moistened all, the winds and dust stilled, phoenixes and simurghs sang in harmony, their sounds blending into sacred hymns that chanted the celestial scriptures. Though they moved through billions of kalpas, they never ceased. Those who listened forgot weariness, relinquished scattered thoughts, concentrated their minds in recollection, and all received benefit.

After such a long while, suddenly the Heavenly Worthy emerged from the void, his luminous qi and Dharma-body pervading all of empty space and existence. True qi spread afar, present everywhere—it was not only in the upper realms that the Heavenly Worthy dwelled, for in the ten directions of the cosmos, wherever one looked, he was there. The myriad phenomena were none other than his Dharma-body.

At that time, the four divisions of attendant immortals—eighty-four thousand cloud-canopy bearers and minor immortals—were not counted among the assembly. Witnessing the wondrous Dao-power of the Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, they all marveled in astonishment, exclaiming that they had never seen the like.

Then the Perfected of Central Harmony and the upper immortals, having already attained the six penetrations, remained silent, communing spiritually with the sand-like worlds without obstruction. Yet through expedient means, they wished to enable the lower immortals to see and hear the supreme Dao, to ascend to the upper realms, to pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy, and to request the Dharma-seal for later students. They did not act as teachers themselves, but the Dharma’s response was fittingly heard by the Greatly Compassionate True Emperor.

Thereupon, the Perfected of Central Harmony, on behalf of later students, addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “The lower worlds are dusty and foul, with many paths of affliction. Having bathed in the mysterious grace for kalpas uncounted, we have constantly received the guiding hand of the Dharma, yet we foolish and deluded ones, adrift and wandering, have not attained perfection. The five emotions contend within, the six thieves rush outward. Later students, harboring divergent views, do not practice the great Dao, but stray into deviant currents, following the flow of suffering, subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death. For this reason, we cannot bear to see or hear of it.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Excellent, excellent, good man! The later students of the lower worlds have shallow understanding of the Dao—how could they transcend the suffering flow of birth and death? Birth, aging, sickness, and death are the common lot of the world. Only those who possess the Dao can reverse the flow of suffering. Though in worldly teachings there are words of reversal, there is no true reversal in substance; though there is reversal in principle, there is none in practice. When principle is clear but practice is obstructed, this is not what the Dao esteems. When there are words but no substance, this too is not esteemed. Only when principle and practice are both clear, when words and substance are both realized—this is what my Dao accomplishes. The shallow, worldly, false, and defiled teachings of the lower realms are not worth inquiring about.”

Thereupon, the Perfected One bowed his head and received the command.

Then the eighty-four thousand direct messengers, canopy-bearing minor immortals, and the four divisions of numinous beings, who had not yet heard the supreme Dao and could not discern its profound meaning, were earnest in their questioning.

At that time, among the assembly, a minor immortal named Precious Appearance came forward, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “Your servants are later students with shallow understanding of the Dao and do not comprehend its profound meaning. We have often heard in the records and transmissions of the ignorant and ordinary that our Dharma can transcend birth, aging, sickness, and death, can emerge from the flow of birth and death, attain the six penetrations, and achieve unimpeded wisdom. Yet we see that such people differ not at all from the ordinary—they are born, age, fall ill, and cannot escape death. We do not know whether these words are true or false. We only pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in his great compassion, will look upon our ignorance with mercy.”

Having spoken, he bowed his head and awaited the Heavenly Worthy’s merciful decree.

Then the Greatly Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion for the minor immortals, spoke to them: “Good men, you have attained the Dao and stand in the four divisions, having just entered the flow of the Dao, yet you have not escaped birth and death. It is only because you have received the blessings of past connections and encountered the assembly of heavenly perfected ones that your lives have been prolonged. Were it not so, you would long since have dissolved into ashes. What you have heard are the transmissions of worldly scriptures, which also say that our Dharma can transcend birth, aging, sickness, and death, and emerge from the flow of birth and death. Yet you see their bodies still subject to worldly arising and ceasing. This is the teaching of those who have entered principle—they speak of emptiness and attain unimpeded eloquence, but they cannot embody principle and attain true freedom. Their minds differ from the ordinary, yet birth, aging, sickness, and death remain unchanged. The suffering and afflictions of the world, the turning of the flow of birth and death—those who have entered principle, lacking the power of the Dao in their bodies, cannot reverse them. Only the great Dao can transcend them. The supreme Dharma of the Dao can transcend birth, aging, sickness, and death, and reverse the flow of suffering.

Good men, those who practice my Dharma, in their embodied existence, can attain long life, transform the ordinary into the sagely, and return to the formless. Harmonizing with luminous qi, they emerge from being and enter non-being, unimpeded in all things.”

“Good men, those who skillfully apply my Dharma to the principle of aging may reverse their forms to infancy and return to long life—this is called transcending old age. Those who apply my Daoist Dharma to the deluded and the afflicted with illness and suffering may free them from sickness, healing their afflictions—this is called transcending all who suffer from illness, rendering them free from disease. Those who apply my Daoist Dharma to the souls of the dead and the sinful may liberate them from suffering. For those who wish to be reborn, let their wishes be fulfilled; for those who do not wish to be reborn, let them attain non-rebirth—this is called transcending death.

Good men, the suffering currents of worldly Dharma arise from the root of greed and desire. Within the great Dao’s Dharma, there is the method of ‘removing the corpse and restraining the po’—those who cultivate and study this Dao will be free from desires. The currents of suffering also arise from the burdens of affection, worry, clothing, and food, yet within the great Dao there are the Eight Treasures of Heavenly Robes and garments of spontaneity, which adjust to one’s size and length. Within the great Dao’s Dharma, there is the qi of Supreme Harmony, the numinous talismans of Yin generation, and the divine waters and jade nectars that sate hunger and thirst, dispelling old age, death, afflictions, and illness—unlike the perilous and unstable provisions of the world. This is called the true Dharma of the great Dao, which reverses the currents of affliction and suffering and severs the cycle of birth and death forever.

The superficial worldly Dharmas claim to transcend birth, aging, sickness, and death, and to reverse the currents of worldly suffering. It is like a man afflicted with a hundred illnesses, impoverished and suffering, unable to obtain what he seeks, who then speaks falsehoods to deceive the ignorant, claiming, ‘I am a heavenly master, skilled in curing all diseases, versed in remedies, acupuncture, and moxibustion.’ The foolish hear this and rush to him, bearing offerings, relying on this deluded teacher and receiving his methods. Yet their illnesses do not heal, and their confusion only deepens. All their poverty and sickness come to resemble their teacher’s. The wise observe this, recognize its falsity, and abandon him to depart.

Thus, the wise choose their teachers carefully. Having met a true teacher, one who can truly heal illness, whose disciples are compassionate and kind, who pity the poor and sick and treat their afflictions—when such a teacher acts, it is like hot water melting snow. Yet these deluded teachers and their disciples, no different from the foolish, having received the true teacher’s Dharma, say: ‘If we follow this Dharma and gain sustenance, supporting our lives, what harm is there?’ The two groups—wise and foolish—stand in opposition. Then the disciples of the deluded teachers grow jealous of the true teacher, slandering him day and night. Yet the true teacher, morning and evening, advances the Dao, practicing great compassion, and does not contend with them.

Good men, the worldly Dharmas are like those foolish men, practicing deviant paths, while the true teacher’s Dharma is like my great Dao, the true teaching that can transcend old age and death, reverse the currents of affliction, and flow in harmony with the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy further said: The worldly Dharmas do not attain the Six Penetrations or unimpeded wisdom—these are also false claims, unworthy of trust. Why? If the worldly Dharmas, when cultivated by people, could attain the Six Penetrations and resemble the Dao without distinction in superiority or inferiority, they should be able to reverse the currents of old age and death. Yet since they still age, fall ill, and ultimately perish, they are clearly without wisdom, definitively lacking the Six Penetrations and the power of the Dao.

Good men, use my Dharma-seal to seal all that is false and deviant, and you will naturally recognize that without cultivating the Dharma-seal, there is no way to discern falsehood.

Good men, there are those in the world who merely cultivate the principle of emptiness, doing nothing else, and verify it within themselves, claiming it is no different from the Dao. Such people only attain arrogance and the sin of boastfulness. For thousands upon thousands of lives, they will never attain the Dao. Why? Their arrogance prevents them from wishing to see the Dao, forever separating them from it, causing them to remain in the cycle of birth and death, flowing with the currents of suffering.

The Dao says: If there are those who seek the supreme blessing, not seeing any arising of existence, and say, ‘Originally I was unborn; this present body is like a dream or illusion,’ and wish to extinguish and transcend it to seek non-rebirth—good men, such people are tainted by deviant influences, speaking mad words without restraint. Why? To seek non-rebirth, one should cultivate the subtle and wondrous Dharma of the supreme Dao, using the power of the Dao to reverse old age and death, not flowing with worldly currents, and only then ascend into the formless, becoming neither born nor extinguished. It is not by extinguishing birth that one attains non-rebirth.

Good men, those without the Dao cannot preserve their forms—by this verification, it is clear they lack the power of the Dao. Lacking the power of the Dao, they cannot attain non-rebirth. Later disciples, hold my Dharma-seal and use it to seal all deviant paths. The Dharma will reveal itself, and without needing to attain the methods they cultivate, you will know them.

Good men, if there are those who study the wisdom of non-arising and say, ‘I study non-arising, yet cannot preserve my form; by this body, I attain the wondrous Dao, seeing the body ascend and transcend. Merely extinguishing this body, I return to the formless, and there will be no further arising’—if any being speaks thus, this is deviant speech, not the true teaching. Why? The Dao is not a Dharma of extinction. Seeking the Dao by extinguishing the body results in the Dao existing while the body perishes. Cultivating my Dharma-seal, preserving life to seek the Dao, results in both the Dao and the body existing, and only then can one empty the body and merge with the Dao. It is not by extinguishing birth that one merges with the Dao.

Then the Heavenly Worthy further addressed the immortals, saying: Though the Dao exists, it can be empty; though the body exists, it can be non-existent. Only when it can be empty and non-existent is it called the Dao.

Good men, that which can preserve but not extinguish is not the Dao; that which can extinguish but not preserve is also not the Dao. The supreme great Dao can both preserve and extinguish, and those who attain the Dao are likewise. All external paths can extinguish but cannot preserve.

Good men, you must now know: flowing toward death is easy, reversing it to avoid death is difficult. Good men, you must now know: those who flow toward death and are called ‘attainers of the Dao’—all corpses may also be called ‘attainers of the Dao.’”

If all corpses cannot be called "attainers of the Dao," then it is clear that the external paths’ destruction of form is not the attainment of the Dao. These external paths are called the path of entering death, not the path of ascending into formlessness and enduring eternally.

Good men, ascending into formlessness means cultivating the seal of my Dao, transforming the mundane into the sacred, refining the substance into subtlety, becoming indestructible and unchanging like empty space.

Good men, if there are beings who allow their bodies to arise and perish, unable to generate firmness, with the four great elements dispersing and their forms reduced to dung and dust, yet still hope for their souls and spirits to realize the supreme Dao—this is like a fool grasping at empty space to seek traces, and it shall never be attained. When the seal of my Dharma is applied to such fools, they are far from the Dao.

Good men, if among the masters, disciples, and followers of my Dharma, they transform beings through the path of conditioned arising—such as establishing pure halls, offering incense and lamps, providing expedient benefits to those who do not understand, showing kindness to all creatures, refraining from harming life, setting up vegetarian feasts to invoke blessings, and repenting for transgressions—they should not seize others’ treasures, grains, or silks, nor harm beings to sustain themselves, nor forsake righteousness and abandon great compassion. Such people are not my disciples but followers of heretical factions.

Those who do not harm beings and do not abandon great compassion are true disciples of the Dao. If my disciples, through the path of conditioned arising, transform those of lower roots and deluded beings who cling to self and others, indulging in filth, wine, and lust, accumulating without restraint, they should teach them the impermanence of life, the fragility of the body, and the precariousness of the four great elements. As for external wealth, they should employ expedient means to instruct without harming lives or property—such people are my true disciples.

If among the masters and disciples of my Dharma, they teach others to offer wealth, valuables, servants, livestock, houses, or fields, yet privately use them for personal gain without cultivating merit, these are called "thieves of the Dao." Those who do not sever ignorance and greed are unfit to transform others; they lead later learners to become worldly beings in future lives. If you encounter such thieves, be cautious and do not associate with them.

The Dao says: In later ages, foolish people will steal the essentials of my Dao and peddle them for profit, seeking wealth and indulging in wine and lust. Such transgressions are also called "thieves of the Dao." They are not my disciples but followers of external paths, heretical spirits, and accomplices of yin thieves. Those who uphold the seal of the great Dao should, upon seeing such people, keep their distance, avoid sharing the same village, and refrain from speaking with them.

The Dao says: These heretical masters and their disciples, driven by greed, exhort ordinary people to cultivate the path of causal conditions, urging them to make offerings and taking their grains and silks for private use. They claim to be great masters of the world, capable of increasing blessings and generating goodness for beings, asserting that those who offer to them will gain boundless merit. In later ages, those who study the truth and cultivate the seal of my Dharma will apply this seal to such fools, branding them as heretical thieves. Those who make offerings should not give to such people, for it will bring retribution in future lives, causing them to fall into the three evil destinies. Those who bestow alms should cultivate goodness, not evil. For this reason, they should not make offerings.

Disciples of the Dao who hold the seal of my Dharma must be cautious not to follow the ways of such heretical customs.

The Dao says: In a past kalpa, there was a heretical master named Seeking Fame. Lazy in clothing and food, he falsely claimed to have attained the Dao, hiding in a cold forest. He constantly proclaimed, "I have realized the Dao and deeply understand the characteristics of the Dharma." He walked while gazing at the ground, entered villages to teach, and after three years, the people outside the forest competed to make offerings to him, filling his store of wealth and food.

With these ill-gotten gains, he secretly provided for his wife and children, purchasing fish and meat to consume in seclusion, falsely claiming to eat only vegetarian fare. For eight years he continued thus. The celestial authorities executed him, and his soul was condemned to the filth-pit hell for eight hundred kalpas. Thereafter, he was reborn beneath the cold forest, taking form in a sheep’s womb. Thrice each year he was born anew, fully repaying his benefactors over five hundred lifetimes. Later, he entered a cow’s womb, again repaying human labor for another five hundred lives. Even now, he remains a servant, still unreleased. Though granted long life—living a hundred years without death—his sinews are feeble, his strength insufficient for labor, and he is constantly despised and scorned by the world. For eight years of deceit, falsely claiming to have attained the Dao, he suffers retribution across endless kalpas. How much worse for those who spend their entire lives in fraud, calling themselves masters, greedily seeking fame and profit, harming the lives and wealth of all beings? For countless kalpas they endure punishment, still unreleased, with no hope of entering the unborn—how could they ever attain liberation?

Men and women of later generations who hold my precious seal must be cautious never to deceive or accept offerings from others.

At that time, though the assembled immortals revered the Celestial Worthy’s golden-mouthed Dharma-seal, their minds remained clouded, unable to discern clearly. Together they bowed and respectfully petitioned the Celestial Worthy once more: "Previously, we received the golden-mouthed Dharma-seal of the Merciful One, which declared that those who practice our Dharma can transcend birth, old age, sickness, and death. Yet we remain uncertain—by what wondrous Dharma does the Merciful One deliver beings, enabling them to attain non-birth, non-aging, non-sickness, and non-death? Though we have received your compassion, we still perceive the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death no differently than the world’s heretical customs. We beseech the Merciful One to explain further." Having spoken, they bowed their heads, weeping bitterly, prostrating themselves upon the ground, unwilling to rise, yearning for the descent of profound stillness.

Then the Greatly Compassionate Celestial Worthy addressed the divine assembly, saying: "Good sons, this Dao is most wondrous, its Dharma supremely spiritual, teaching all to attain perfection. It is not imparted to the vulgar or lesser immortals. You who now behold me are not far from the true. Moved by your sincerity, I shall not conceal it from you. Listen carefully, for I shall now explain."

In an instant, the Greatly Compassionate Celestial Worthy commanded the thirty-nine Perfected Ones attending at his side to strike the drums in the Great Compassion Palace of the Grand Void. Naturally, roots took form, and the void ordered the hun-souls. With wondrous harmony, they chanted the thirty-nine chapters of the Golden Phoenix Songs, regulating the thirty-nine qi, reciting their titles in a single moment.

At that time, jade-like branches unfurled, and gem-like blossoms bloomed. When the tuning was complete, the myriad transformations returned to their root. The thirty-nine Perfected Ones transformed into ethereal light, and the Golden Phoenixes altered their forms to become wondrous qi. Light and qi intermingled, shimmering like spring blossoms.

In an instant, they changed into immortal clouds, entering the palace, condensing upon the beams and rafters, still and unmoving. Within the Great Compassion Palace, roots took form anew, and the void ordered the hun-souls with wondrous chanting. The lyrics were as follows:

*"The Palace of Compassion illumines the true radiance,
Outshining the dawn’s first light.
The six directions open their gates,
The grand void reveals its windows.
Cloud-canopies array as light veils,
The nine qi transform into flying dragons.
With a single lift of divine feet, one roams,
Drifting without trace.
The Dao is named the Greatly Compassionate Worthy,
Whose divine power knows no equal.
The celestial scriptures array the myriad forms,
Chanting and sighing harmonize the heart and breast."*

Then the Celestial Worthy’s brows and divine hairs gleamed with radiance, brighter than the morning sun. The Dao-realm shone with penetrating brilliance, dispelling darkness to reveal dawn. The ten directions of the world all became clearly visible within the light.

At that time, the Treasure Forms and all the assembled multitudes beheld this true light. Their mind’s eyes became clear, and they saw all forms and images throughout the ten directions of the world, bright and unobstructed.

In an instant, the Greatly Compassionate Celestial Worthy filled the light entirely, expounding the Dharma everywhere. All forms and images could also speak, aiding in the recitation of the celestial scriptures. Those who listened well became worthy or sage, using this wondrous Dao to transcend the torrent of suffering. Those who ingested this wondrous qi immediately attained effortless attainment.

The dead who obtained it could receive new life;
The living who obtained it became free from illness;
The aged who obtained it reverted to infancy;
The sick who obtained it were instantly cured;
The Daoists who obtained it returned to their root and source;
The worldly who obtained it saw their wishes fulfilled;
The foolish who obtained it forever left blindness behind;
The heavens who obtained it saw the Three Luminaries steadfast and bright;
The great earth who obtained it never collapsed or sank;
The myriad things who obtained it could fulfill their lives;
The mute who obtained it could immediately speak;
The lame and infirm who obtained it could instantly fly.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the numinous beings, saying: This Dharma-seal of mine is the Way for all later learners to preserve life and maintain bodily integrity, the Way of non-death. All sentient beings who lose this Way of mine will invariably suffer bodily ruin and the extinction of life, drifting with the current into death. Deprived of the power of the Way, they cannot attain non-death, nor can they escape death.

Men and women of later generations who study the truth and uphold this Dharma-seal of mine—let them deeply contemplate this Way, for it is the root and foundation of all later learners. If any sentient being departs from the subtle and wondrous Dharma of my great Way, there is no possibility of attaining the Way of bodily integrity and non-death. To lose my Way of life is like a bird losing its wings; it is also like one who would cross a river yet has lost their boat and raft—though the far shore may be seen in the distance, there is no means to reach it.

All the myriad things that lose the qi of my Way will never attain life. All sentient beings who claim they can attain the Way while departing from the great Way are like grasses and trees that, far removed from earth and water, assuredly cannot sprout and grow. All sentient beings who distance themselves from my Way will assuredly not attain the Way.

Good man, these matters may be understood by analogy, and the truth is clear and easily seen. That things are not used according to their kind—fools do not comprehend this; yet even when things are used according to their kind, people still fail to understand. Though the shallow and worldly may know what accords with kind and what does not, they cannot apply this knowledge with precision. When application is proper, one can preserve life; when improper, one harms their own form. Gain and loss stand in opposition, as do life and death.

The boundary between ascent and descent, deviation and correctness, life and death—this is naturally discerned, and there is no distance in it; yet once dualistic views arise, among ten thousand, not one can return. For these reasons, those who attain the Way are few, while those who lose it are many; those who are true and upright are few, while those who practice deviance are many.

The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy says: All you assembled multitudes, merely recite the most true and wondrous invocations of the Great Compassion Palace, ingest and employ their numinous efficacy, and you shall skillfully emerge from the currents of birth and death, and deliver yourselves from the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death.

The Heavenly Worthy further declares: These subtle words are no empty speech; their efficacy lies in ingestion and application. When word and deed are both enacted, numinous verification is immediate. Though one may recite the words countless times, they shall not touch old age and death. To practice without speech is to sever oneself from the dust. Child, if you can sever yourself from the dust, you shall dwell as a neighbor to the Dao. Dwelling as a neighbor to the Dao, things cannot resent you. When things cannot resent you, this is called returning to the root. With no form to inherit, preserving life enters into the formless—this is called non-birth.

Good son, one whose form is not whole cannot attain non-birth; one whose life is not whole is called entering death. Those who enter death are said to lack the power of the Dao. Without the power of the Dao, one cannot attain non-birth. To be born and enter death is no better than grasses and trees or insects and ants, which live but a morning and die by dusk. Though humans pass through a single lifetime claiming to study the Dao, if they only learn empty practices and hollow incantations, they shall not escape birth and death. Why is this? The practice of emptiness is possible for the highest sages, but for the learning ordinary person, it obstructs every encounter. Neglecting the tools of life, failing to gather form and spirit, life cannot be secured, and form and spirit scatter. Empty birth, empty death—such cannot attain the Dao.

Later, when the learning sage first stands upon the ground of study, they gather life and order its tools, diligent from dawn to dusk. Only after attaining the Dao can they then achieve emptiness—not that one practices empty methods while still in study. Good son, the deviant and false factions of the world’s vulgar currents, having heard peripherally of the subtle and wondrous dharma of the Great Dao that preserves form and life and enters non-birth, suppose that after the destruction of the body, the refined spirit and sinful ghosts may attain non-birth. These deviant and vulgar ones, practicing empty methods, claim their minds can act without obstruction, their power can overturn heaven and earth, reverse yin and yang, harmonize water and fire, and perceive no hindrance in the birth and death of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Those who hold such views call themselves attainers of the Dao, deceiving the world to seek fame and profit. They disrespect their parents, or speak of non-birth while clinging to deluded thoughts. When the time of death arrives, they claim there is no death, no afflictions, no hunger, no cold, no sickness. All such views are but delusion.

When the vulgar and deviant hold such views, they call themselves attainers of the Dao. If one in my dharma, at the initial stage of learning, holds such views, this is called forgetting the taboo, rebelling against the Great Dao. The Dao does not darkly protect them; their bodies lack the power of the Dao. They live in darkness and die in darkness, unable to escape any karmic reckoning—how then could they realize the Dao? The officials of the nether bureaus still record their names in the black ledger for their hollow incantations, deceiving themselves and others. Such people mislead countless others, forever losing the path of life. Though they speak grand words, they do not practice the Great Dao. They are like the sick claiming to cure illness, or the lame selling medicine for swift travel. At first hearing, their words seem true, but the wise, upon examination, know their error.

At that time, Baoxiang and the assembled multitude bowed again and kowtowed, speaking thus: "Formerly, we received the Compassionate Venerable One’s discourse on the marvelous qi of the Dao, which those who ingest it need not await. We now humbly request its method to aid our bodily existence, that we may practice it lifelong without daring to carelessly divulge it."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The supreme and ultimate Dharma is bestowed upon those who can practice it. Since you have the heart for it, my Dao shall not be concealed. Listen carefully: the divine Dao of the utmost spirit admits no precedence."

Baoxiang and the assembled multitude prostrated themselves upon the ground, receiving the teaching with single-minded devotion.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "The marvel of Dao-qi is of the most divine method. The ten thousand images of heaven and earth are born of primordial qi; there is not a single thing that does not attain freedom through primordial qi. Rising and sinking, flying and walking, they roam by riding qi. With qi, they exist; without qi, they perish. Those that exist cannot die; those that perish cannot live. Qi has purity and turbidity; affairs have adversity and prosperity. Ingesting pure qi enlivens; harnessing turbid qi kills. Pure qi ascends and floats; turbid qi descends and sinks. Pure qi forms heaven; turbid qi forms earth. True essence and marvelous qi are called pure qi; coagulation, filth, stagnation, and impurity are called turbid qi. The path of death is murky and turbid like muddy water; the path of life is limpid and clear like pure water. Humans are like fish; qi is like water. When water is turbid, fish grow emaciated; when qi is murky, people fall ill.

"Good man, the minds of sentient beings in the lower world are often rebellious and contrary, vexed and restless. They seek all manner of desires, their temperaments given to joy and anger, their natures fierce and violent—all these are death-qi. Benevolence, filial piety, composure, deliberation, harmony, and refined gentleness—these are life-qi. Forgetting the self and merging with the Dao, unaware of worldly burdens, myriad transformations pass unseen before the eyes, a thousand sounds go unheard by the ears. Movement is as if non-existent; stillness is as if emptiness. Constantly abiding in pure qi, let it flow into the twin palaces, dispersing and circulating through the meridians, suffusing the entire body like drifting clouds. At the celestial palace, exhale gently half the qi. With the mind focused on the remaining half, let it circulate through the twin palaces, preventing dissipation. At dawn, consume purple blossoms; at dusk, savor yellow coptis. This method is the ingestion of the morning qi of the sun, employing our morning qi to safeguard and witness great peace. Take enough to be satiated; there is no fixed limit. Thus, the meridians flow unimpeded, the hundred passages are harmonized and supple, complexion becomes radiant, hair turns black, and strength doubles. To preserve the body and perfect life, nothing surpasses this Dao. This Dao is the gateway and window of later sages, the pivot of true learning, the root of all myriad existences. Its circulation and coagulation form heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, wind and qi, clouds and rain, frost and snow, mountains and rivers, soil and stone, plants and trees, water and fire, the wise and foolish, the ordinary and sacred, humans and non-humans—all are transformations of a single qi, riding its movements to attain life.

"Those who practice my Dao are called worthy; those who employ my Dao are called sages. Those who do not use this Dao are called walking corpses. Their forms disperse and scatter, their ethereal souls become sinful ghosts, sinking into the nine springs.

"At that time, when the Heavenly Worthy had finished expounding this Dharma, from his golden mouth issued forth thirty-six thousand rays of true, marvelous qi. All sounds harmonized in unison, celestial music flowed everywhere, and both the sentient and insentient spontaneously resonated. The assembled immortals below, having received the true qi of the Dao, together expressed their gratitude for this new life, rejoicing with boundless joy. Practicing this marvelous Dao, they all preserved their bodies and entered the path of non-birth. After attaining the Dao, they steadfastly cultivated without cessation.

"The Dao declared: 'Disciples of the Dao who have gained the power of the Dao are unknown to ordinary beings. Observing their forms, though not plump, their complexions are upright, their strength robust, their bodies light and marvelous, their skin and countenance moist and lustrous. Their hearing and perception are unobstructed, their gait is light and agile, they do not sleep at dawn or dusk, their bodies are free from blemishes and diseases, their appearance is fresh and pure, their voices clear and resonant. Such people are said to have gained the power of the Dao. Advancing in cultivation without retreat, they are certain to escape birth, old age, sickness, and death.'

"Good man, imprint these superior practitioners with the seal of my Dharma; verification is immediate, not awaiting attainment before knowing.

"The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy further addressed the immortals: 'Do you wish to know the false Daoists? Observe their forms. If in the world there are those who claim to have attained the Dao, profoundly understanding its principles, or say they practice the Dao day and night without rest, or have done so for thirty or forty years—right and wrong can be discerned, gain and loss easily known.

"Good man, do you know the false Daoists? First, they consume blood-food; second, they indulge in lust; third, they suffer from grave illnesses. Their qi swells with sores and tumors, scabies and leprosy, jaundice and fistulas. Practicing heterodoxy, they lose their nature, suffering from watery distension and abdominal masses. Their complexions are scorched and dry, their ears and noses withered and parched. Everywhere they ache, their breath is labored, their fluids exhausted, lacking any moisture. They are slothful and wallow in filth, unable to forget life and death. Their appearance is grimy and greasy, their bodies foul-smelling wherever they go. They are quick to relieve themselves, fond of speaking ill, restless and competitive, insatiably acquisitive. Their flesh is ample but their bones small, their gaze shallow and near. Their natures lack benevolence, their hearts lack filial piety. Such people are certainly unable to attain the Dao. These are called leaky bodies, also named ruined bodies. Even if they possess some Dao-qi, they cannot save themselves, much less save others. Like those who cannot sustain themselves, how can they sustain others?

"Good man, when false Daoists perform their methods, men and women intermingle, doors are shut, and they bestow alms of wealth and food—but only to external paths, unable to universally bestow. This is called leaky practice and leaky almsgiving, not the true Dharma, not Dharma-giving. The supreme Great Dao is benevolent to all under heaven, dispersing primordial qi to nurture the ten thousand things, manifesting kindness while concealing its function. It does not rely on its merit, does not see what it bestows, does not see what it receives, much less seek recompense. The methods of external paths do not sever delusion and greed—these are called leaky and are certainly unable to attain the Dao.'"

"If my disciples perform such almsgiving, they align with those demonic deviants. My later disciples who hold my Dharma-seal—should they encounter such persons—must not walk with them, nor dwell together in Dharma. They ought to rebuke and admonish them with Dharma-teachings; if they refuse to comply, let Heaven condemn them. They must not take lives or strike with fists, for to commit such violent offenses incurs the sin of execution, and Heaven’s law grants no pardon."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Later disciples who cultivate my Great Dao, while still in the stage of learning and before attaining realization, must embody compassion, forbearance, and humility, extending kindness to all sentient beings and fulfilling filial piety toward all. They should wear simple garments and eat plain, pure vegetarian fare, burn incense and offer vows, diligently practicing morning and evening. Their conduct must be meticulous, ever wary of evil; they should neither rush nor compete, dwelling in tranquil stillness. They chant the precious scriptures in soft voices with even breath, harmonizing body and mind, avoiding all stray thoughts. With single-minded devotion, they contemplate the Dao as if awaiting something. They ingest subtle qi, expelling the old and absorbing the new, consuming sacred mushrooms and divine herbs, along with spirit talismans and holy water. They retreat from the world, avoiding worldly affairs. Those who cultivate thus for less than a year will find divine attendants serving them, all poisons unable to harm them. Old illnesses vanish, their complexion reverts to youth, their strength becomes robust, and they naturally seek abundant blessings, their body and mind never sated. I seal such persons to surely attain the true Dao."

The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy further addressed Baoxiang, saying: "In the lower world, foolish men who neither cultivate the Great Dao nor the supreme, ultimate Dharma yet claim: 'One must destroy this body to attain purity and meet the true essence.' This is like the southern slopes of Kunlun Mountain in the lower world, where long ago there lived a barbarian named Youposina. His nature was fierce and stubborn, and he kept many wives and children. His third wife was exceedingly ugly and bore him ten sons. The barbarian thought to himself, despising this wife..."

The wife again became pregnant. Thereupon, the barbarian thought only of his sons and, impatient to wait for the birth, poisoned the mother to death. After her life ended, he cut open her belly to remove the child, but the child was still unformed, only a congealed mass of flesh, which rotted along with the mother and could not be grasped. The barbarian, filled with self-loathing, later regretted his actions and said: "If only my wife’s body were like a mule’s—when pregnant, one could cut open her belly to take the child." Those who witnessed this told him: "Elder, you should know that when a mule is pregnant, one waits until the full term, knowing the mother is about to give birth, then cuts open her belly to save the child’s life. But your wife’s body differs from a mule’s. Moreover, she had only been pregnant for three months. Even if her term were full, you should not have killed her. How could cutting open her belly to take the child compare to nurturing the mother so she could raise her son? If the child had grown to maturity, the mother would have died of old age naturally. Why kill her in hopes that this child would carry on the family line? It is like cutting off the roots of a tree and expecting it to bear fruit—it can never come to pass."

"Good man, those who follow heretical customs and treat the body as a mere vessel are just the same. They do not cultivate the supreme principle yet seek to destroy the body, hoping their sinful souls will meet the true essence. This is no different from that barbarian who killed his wife to take her child—how stubborn and deluded! Alas, the ways of the world are so shallow and false—how can such people be fit to hear the Great Dao? Those who hold my Dharma seal must not act as he did."

"Good man, the path of cultivating causes still requires vows. One must vow to see the Dao and hear the Dharma in this life and the next—how much more so for those who seek liberation in this very body. Good man, as you study the Great Dao, preserve your form and life. The Dao of no-birth is like a boat or carriage: sturdy, light, and swift, its seams tightly sealed. On land, it bears its load; on water, it resists sinking. It safely reaches its destination without weariness or worry—is this not joyous?"

"Good man, there are foolish people in the world who, hearing of others attaining liberation, imitate them from the sidelines. But they lack wisdom and strength, their nature is lazy and careless, and they cannot even craft a proper carriage. They discard what others have broken, yet the boats and carriages they abandon could still ferry others through danger and drowning. Before reaching the halfway point, they capsize and perish, shattered and lost beyond measure."

"Good man, you must understand: a broken carriage or ruined boat cannot even sustain itself—how can it ferry others? Heretical customs are the same—they cannot save themselves, let alone others. Worldly fools who rely on external paths and heretical customs to deliver the living and the dead are like fools using broken boats and carriages—the disaster of destruction awaits them at once."

"Good man, if there were people who could cross the waters on a broken raft, then external paths would indeed lead to no-birth. But if a broken boat cannot cross, then external paths cannot lead to no-birth. Good man, men and women of later generations who wish to study the Dao should gather and recite the celestial scriptures and treasure texts. These texts are the warp of heaven and the weft of earth; north-south is the warp, east-west the weft. In the center, they become spirit; in things, they become qi; in humans, they become the numinous. Thus it is said: the warp of heaven and the weft of earth weave together the ordinary and the sage. All the myriad things, whether formless or formed, are woven by the true qi of the Great Dao."

The immortals asked: "We dare inquire of the Compassionate One: what is the method of this weaving?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Heaven does not speak yet keeps faith, so it can be followed to perfect virtue. The Three Luminaries do not speak yet shine, so they can be emulated to perfect the body. Earth does not speak yet holds righteousness, so it can be modeled to nurture all things. The Dao does not speak yet is numinous, so it can give birth to heaven and earth. The ten thousand images of heaven and earth are also warp and weft, weaving the ordinary into sages."

The immortals asked: "We dare inquire: if the ten thousand images of heaven and earth are not the body of the Dao, how can they weave the ordinary into sages?"

The reply: "The Dao gives birth to primordial qi, primordial qi gives birth to the Supreme Ultimate, the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to heaven and earth, and heaven and earth give birth to the myriad things. Thus, the ten thousand images of heaven and earth are the descendants of the Dao—how could they not weave the ordinary into sages? The warp and weft of the Great Dao spread across heaven and earth, arraying the sun, moon, stars, wind, clouds, rain, dew, gold, jade, earth, stone, grasses, trees, and all kinds. All can be gathered and used to aid the learner, swiftly attaining sagehood. Once sagehood is attained, one can command heaven, earth, and the myriad things."

At that time, a lesser immortal named Zhengming, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, was confused and failed to understand. He dared to ask further: "I do not yet grasp the meaning of the Dharma seal from the Compassionate One’s golden mouth—how can those who study the Dao gather and use the sun, moon, stars, wind, clouds, rain, dew, gold, jade, earth, stone, grasses, trees, and all kinds of things to aid their learning and swiftly attain sagehood? And once sagehood is attained, how can they command heaven, earth, and the myriad things? Your disciple is dull-witted and does not comprehend this profound principle. I only thought that using the Dao of heaven was inferior to heaven itself. I humbly beg the Compassionate One to clarify this distinction."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Those who study the Dao and use the Dao of heaven and the myriad images swiftly attain sagehood because the true essence and wondrous qi of the supreme Great Dao are hidden within heaven, earth, and the myriad things. When one skillfully employs the Dao of heaven and the myriad things, the Great Dao responds. It is like a filial son serving his parents: his heart holds no resistance, he attends to their warmth and coolness in all seasons, observes their countenance, and even when traveling far, his heart is filled with concern, remembering his parents as if they were before him. In waking and sleeping, his spirit does not leave them. Heaven protects him, and spirits guard him. If filial piety toward one’s parents can move heaven, then filial piety toward heaven should naturally move the Dao."

At that time, Dengming and all the later learners, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, opened their minds and understood. They realized that heaven, earth, and the myriad things deeply benefit those who study the Dao, and they clearly saw that heaven, earth, and the myriad things are none other than the Dao. They sighed for the foolish who could not use them, saying: "Before our awakening, we were just the same."

The assembly bowed in unison to give thanks to the Heavenly Worthy for the grace of life.

Then the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy spoke again to the immortals: "The virtue of heaven and earth is fully contained within the Dao. Though the myriad things possess virtue, none is complete in itself. Yet when one takes what is needed and harmonizes it for mutual benefit, its merit and power become one with the Dao. Those who know how to employ heaven, earth, and the myriad things to aid their bodies need not rely on the esoteric scriptures of the Three Clarities or the true methods of the Three Caverns. The esoteric scriptures of the Three Caverns are lofty in Dao and wondrous in method, yet difficult to receive or even witness.

"Those who study the Dao and seek the truth without ceasing—when their merit is complete and their conduct perfected—the Dao of itself will come to deliver them. These immortals, having deeply understood the meaning of the Dao and thoroughly grasped the Way of preserving form without birth, ascend through the three ranks of immortality, enter the land of no death, and all can rise into the formless, thereby proving that the unborn is not the extinction of life."

After Dengming, the True Person of Central Harmony, had requested the Dharma seal on behalf of the immortals, they all took leave of the Heavenly Worthy and lingered among the clouds for seven days and seven nights. The Heavenly Worthy then said: "Those who have attained the Dao can see afar and hear distantly; their bodies and minds are at ease, subtle and blissful, liberated and unobstructed. Though I am now separated from you by thirty-six thousand heavens and earths, it is as if we were on the palm of my hand, close before my eyes. How can there be any separation? This is unlike the walking corpses of the dusty world below, who stand face to face yet remain as distant as Hu and Yue.

"Return to the lower realm and exhort all beings, guiding them away from heterodox paths. Use gradual or sudden methods as appropriate to their capacities."

At that time, the immortals bowed their heads in reverence, received the Dharma seal, and ascended into the formless. The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy multiplied his forms to gather the immortals and spread the transformation of the Dao.

When the immortals had descended to the lower realm, they halted in midair, ten thousand *ren* above the earth, seated upon auspicious clouds. Then the pillars of heaven trembled in the four directions, the great earth quaked, dragons and spirits rejoiced, and heaven and earth grew bright. Mist and fog rolled back, the three luminaries shone twice as brightly, fragrant winds spread far and wide, sweet dew poured down, the earth gushed forth milky springs, rivers and marshes became calm and clear. Auspicious qilin and phoenixes gathered in profusion, divine mushrooms and fine herbs spread their shade across the wilds.

The heavenly kings all declared it a blessing for the realm and hailed the ten thousand years. A great amnesty was proclaimed throughout the world; grain and silk were distributed from the treasuries to relieve the old and sick. All under heaven rejoiced, and ranks and emoluments were bestowed. The Son of Heaven, the various kings, and the multitude of dukes and ministers—too many to recount—ascended the altar to pay homage and give profound thanks for the grace bestowed. They offered vast treasures and established quiet offerings. All under heaven embraced the Dao, and the traces of demons and evil vanished. The myriad states enjoyed great peace; all under heaven prospered together, and the people lived in abundance, singing praises in verse.

For ninety thousand years, the sky bore no杂色 clouds, only purple mist; moisture flowed without separate streams, only sweet dew fell. The lesser immortals of the lower realm witnessed the power of the Dao’s compassion and knew it to be the might of the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy. Then each immortal expressed their heartfelt wishes and bowed from afar toward the vast emptiness of the sky.

At that time, the Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy, together with the various highest perfected ones and the highest immortals, each extended their hands to fill the lower realm, expounding wondrous Dharma. They conferred upon the lesser immortals the first rank of the supreme Dao, instructing each to cultivate the highest methods and enter the Way of perfecting form without birth. Innumerable beings were delivered into the wondrous Dharma, attaining the fruit of non-retrogression.

The Hu, Yi, Man, and Liao peoples, along with all ghosts, spirits, and the suffering souls of hell, all received the mysterious transformation and gained its benefits. From this time onward, however, people grew increasingly shallow and contentious, filled with malice and harm. The great Dao was no longer practiced, and demonic influences began to arise.

Though many were not yet ready to receive deliverance, the Dao still extended its hand, bestowing the Dharma of great compassion. In later ages, men and women, lacking upright hearts, might only tentatively practice the Dao, yet the Dao would still grant its aid without reproach. Some would progress gradually, while others would retreat midway. Seeing their retreat, the Dao would not cling to them. Though the Dao is without intent, it constantly nurtures all things with compassion.

The great Dao is like water, quenching thirst and washing away filth. The Dao is like a fine medicine: if one diligently takes it, it will surely cure illness; but if one is sick and does not take it, recovery is rare. Men and women of later ages who diligently cultivate the Dao will surely escape death and calamity, preserve their bodies, and live on, entering the formless and becoming companions of the Dao. Those who turn their backs on the Dao will not have their names removed from the register of death, nor will they escape mortal calamity. Their forms will turn to ash and dust, their souls and consciousness will drift and wander, subject to karmic retribution. In life, they will lack the power of the Dao; in death, they will hope for the Dao’s rebirth, but it will never be attained.

From now on, yin qi will gradually grow stronger, and people will no longer fear death. They will study external methods and fail to attain the great Dao. Such people are often seized by demons and evil spirits, their souls and spirits captured, their bodies afflicted with illness, with no means of cure. After their lives end, they will follow the factions of evil and surely fail to attain the Dao. Though they may have minor good deeds, there will be no way for them to receive karmic reward, for they have lost the upright path and do not wish to practice the Dao, leaving them vulnerable to the encroachment of evil spirits.

Such people claim that the myriad things are empty, and their own bodies are also empty. If the realm of things is empty, what can encroach upon them? If their bodies are also empty, what can they receive? Their false notions of reception are ultimately empty and quiescent, utterly nonexistent. Yet foolish people, holding to such partial views, when they engage in this contemplation, find demonic spirits and spectral beings competing to harm them, with no fear or restraint.

Some, while still alive, are possessed by demons and follow evil spirits, departing in an instant—this is called "entering evil with the whole body," and they need not wait for death to have their souls and spirits taken. If a woman, while alive, harbors evil within, her complexion will wither and turn sallow, her body aching everywhere, constantly spitting phlegm and foam, or swelling severely. The noxious qi of water and earth will cause pain in all her joints; wind afflictions will enter her heart, leaving her confused and forgetful. How can she find time to seek the Dao while struggling to save her qi? Such is the sorrow of the degenerate world, where people bring about their own destruction.

Each body possesses its own Dao, yet they do not know how to employ it, though it is as near as a neighbor.

Those who refuse to analyze it merely draw near the mysterious stream yet lack the heart to cleanse their filth; though a divine physician stands at their side, they do not know how to cure their illness, willingly enduring suffering and embracing the pain of thorns. Such men are not far from the Dao, yet delusion clouds their hearts and veils their eyes, so they drift with the current and cannot swim against it.

The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy expounds the Dharma-seal for all sentient beings, circulating and bestowing its offerings. Those of utmost sincerity treasure and practice it, while the perverse and vulgar raise slander on all sides.

Good man, you should now know that believing in and revering my Dao does not benefit me, just as slandering my Dao does not harm me. Good man, the perverse and vulgar are like hunting dogs feeding without a fixed master. For example, the eastern household cultivates goodness and observes long fasts, upholding the precepts and refraining from killing. The western household commits the ten evils, engaging solely in butchery, trade, fishing, and hunting, their home reeking with foulness. The scraps of their meals are discarded within their domain. The eastern household’s dog, drawn by the stench, goes to feed on the remnants and forgets to return. Now, the western household had no dog before; seeing this one, young and small, they delight in its presence and feed it even more of the rancid scraps. The dog’s original master, magnanimous in nature, does not call it back. As months and years pass, the dog grows large and no longer recognizes its former master. One day, the master happens to go out and briefly passes the western neighbor’s home, whereupon the dog barks in alarm. The former master, moved by compassion, does not take offense. Several days later, the household of the ten evils suddenly suffers heavenly calamity, and the entire family perishes. The remnants they had gathered, putrid and rotten, are also exhausted. The dog, now starving, howls all day. Hearing this, the former master’s household discusses: “When this dog was young, it loved to go to that house, feeding on foul and rotten scraps until its nature became corrupted. Even if we called it back now, it would not survive.” In an instant, the dog starves to death. The master sighs: “When this dog was with us, it often heard the Dharma. Though it did not awaken to it, its spirit was still nourished. I hoped that in its next life it might be born as a human. Yet for no reason, it went to that household of the ten evils, drinking blood and devouring fat, feeding on putrid scraps. Now it has starved to death without a single good affinity. This dog will certainly not be born into the human realm.”

Good man, I compare the perverse and vulgar who are jealous and forget their roots, slandering the Great Dao, to this dog—both pursue foulness and thus fail to recognize their former master. Those who study the Dao endure humiliation and bear slander, redoubling their diligence. In seeking the Supreme Dao, they must also reflect and observe: the perverse and vulgar cannot escape the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death; they cannot transcend the mire of entanglements, sinking into delusion, their bodies formed by the three poisons of ignorance, greed, and hatred. The ten evils and five rebellions are their companions; wealth and lust are their dwellings; malicious speech and venomous tongues are their songs; slander and jealousy are their hearts’ conduct. The perverse and vulgar do not see true scriptures, do not hear true teachings, and have no means to cease their evil—such are their calamities. Those who study later should distance themselves from such people, need not engage with them, nor contend with them in debate. They should seek their own ascent and deliverance, unwavering from dawn to dusk.

The perverse and vulgar follow teachings that rise and fall; their bodies are subject to aging and death. Before they even die, they are already afflicted by disasters—this is the sign that their perverse teachings are ineffective. Those who study the true Dao remain free from illness—this is the sign of their primal fortune and wholeness of life. They should rejoice in this, deeply avoid harm, uphold my Dharma-seal, and not accept perverse words.

Good man, at the beginning of the kalpa, there were people from Jianmu Village who entered the southern mountains to peddle true pearls. A merchant from the eastern mountains, named Poluoduo and called Manyuan, took out a hundred taels of gold, bought a pearl, round and luminous in his palm, an inch in diameter. He carried it in a pouch at his elbow, allowing no one to see it. Within several tens of days, a man from the southern mountains named Leijie came, falsely selling fish eyes. The western neighbor of Manyuan, a household named Shouliang, also took out a hundred taels of gold and bought a fish eye, likewise concealing it and allowing no one to see it. Six years later, both households fell gravely ill. They beseeched a skilled physician to come and treat their sickness, and in preparing the medicinal formula, a fine true pearl was required. At that time, the two men each brought out their pearls for the physician to examine. From afar, the physician knew that the latter had bought a fish eye. He immediately said, “This is not a true pearl.” Shouliang was suspicious, fearing the physician was deceiving him, and asked the physician to test it in water. After soaking it overnight, the container reeked of fishiness. When a true pearl is placed in water, its brilliance only increases. After nine days, it was taken out, now six inches long. Manyuan ingested it, and his suffering was immediately cured. Later, when he went to buy another pearl, he asked the physician to teach him how to soak it in water. After taking it, he became robust, and to this day, he has lived over ninety thousand years. His name is inscribed on the Jade Tablet of the Upper Sovereign as one who does not die, and all good spirits serve him in turn. This man also attained the Dao of my true qi and can ride the qi to travel, no longer subject to the peril of death.

The western neighbor’s entire household perished from that grave illness. Only a slave named Qinzi, young and thoughtful, often gazed at the sky and sighed, wishing to obtain the Heavenly Dao to save himself from suffering. I commanded the Perfected Immortal of Great Penetration to teach him to eat pine needles and pine nuts. To this day, he does not age, entering Mount Taibai and sometimes wandering to the Heavenly Mountains, ascending Kunlun. I have transmitted to him the method of the morning qi, and he is certain to escape death and attain the true Dao.

Good man, the true and the false Dao stand in opposition, with life and death as their counterparts—there is no equivalence. Upholding my Dharma-seal enables one to distinguish between the perverse and the upright. Those who study and cultivate should aspire to save themselves and deliver both the living and the dead, yet they must not act hastily, pursuing fame and profit while forgetting their great accomplishment.

In the realm of the utmost true Dharma, those who serve it can turn the Dao of heaven and earth and repel the four seasons, unchanging by day or night.

When heaven and earth collapse, the Dao can restore them;
when the cosmos is broken, the Dao can mend it;
when vital qi is deficient, the Dao can replenish it;
when the myriad things are unnurtured, the Dao can nourish them;
when the world remains untransformed, the Dao can transform it;
all that is fierce and evil, the Dao can alter;
all that is good, the Dao can bless;
those benighted in ignorance, the Dao grants them light;
the solitary and fearful, the Dao befriends;
hunger, cold, sickness, and distress, the Dao removes;
when treading through peril and hardship, the Dao brings peace;
when the blade presses upon the neck, the Dao delivers.

Good man, if you wish to study, do not within the supreme Great Dao’s utmost true Dharma give rise to improper conduct. In all your undertakings, maintain perfect uprightness. The profound protection of the Great Dao ensures that you need not fear perverse paths lacking true root-power or reliable support.

It is like one who has lost their way, advancing and retreating without direction, unaware of the essential path. From youth, they wander in confusion, their practice unsettled. Some speak of forgetting the mind, yet fail to perceive the body; if the mind has no arising, how can hearing be forgotten?

If the mind bears burdens, how can it be forgotten? When this body first returns to the four great elements, though the body may be temporarily forgotten, the four great elements remain. Even if the form is empty, observation cannot cease. One thing observed becomes two matters. The prior realm is not forgotten, and subsequent observation arises in succession. All causes and conditions arise from the four great elements; the body is born from their harmonious union. At the time of extinction, it returns to the four great elements. The followers of external paths are like grasses and trees: born from the four great elements, they perish by them. They cannot avoid arising, nor can they avoid ceasing. They cannot attain immediate arising, nor can they prevent arising. The followers of external paths are likewise bound within birth and death, enslaved by things, rising and perishing with conditions.

Good man, those who attain the Dao can forget both body and mind, perceiving neither ability nor forgetting. Both realm and wisdom are empty in substance; observation does not arise. The form I receive is born from the Dao. Now, forgetting this form, I return to the Dao, no longer held by the four great elements, no longer subject to the arising and ceasing of the four seasons, no longer bound by the fetters of affliction. The supreme Great Dao can preserve and extinguish: in extinction, it is without form; in preservation, it attains long life. Serene and profound, subtle and elusive, it cannot be known by wisdom, nor grasped by the mind. It responds to things with perfect completeness, its activity and function boundless.

Good man, the power of compassion of the supreme Great Dao is inconceivable. In later generations, men and women who uphold this Dharma-seal should reflect deeply and maintain right mindfulness. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy having expounded this scripture, the five hundred followers of external paths, including Ke Yewei and others, abandoned their heterodox teachings. Baring their shoulders in remorse, they entreated the Dao, seeking to leave home and attain deliverance. Beating their breasts in repentance, their bodies streamed with blood. They plucked out their hair and eyebrows like birds molting their feathers, leaping and flinging themselves down as if mountains were collapsing.

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Perfected One of Central Harmony to initiate the followers of external paths, bestowing upon them the Dao of causes and conditions for rebirth. They were to contemplate impermanence with reverence, refrain from harm, sever delusion and greed, and avoid accumulation. The Perfected One of Central Harmony said: "You followers of external paths, from this day forward, take care not to exalt yourselves falsely as great teachers of heaven and humanity, harming others’ lives and property. The celestial registers of dark deeds record your transgressions; nine generations of ancestors suffer punishment, and you become rebellious ghosts. While you live now, wear simple clothing and eat plain food to sustain your bodies. Endure humiliation, cultivate diligently, and seek early transformation. In later lives, be born in the Central Kingdom, encounter the Dao, and hear the Dharma. With this impure and stagnant body, unfit to preserve its form, enter the Dao of non-arising."

At that time, the five hundred followers of external paths rejoiced, bowed in gratitude to the Perfected One of Central Harmony, took leave of the Heavenly Worthy, and returned to their dwellings. There they established pure abodes, practiced the Dao morning and evening, contemplated the impermanence of the body, and sought early extinction. Throughout the four heavens, humans and non-humans alike all took refuge in the true and correct Dao. Then the Heavenly Worthy, with the assembly of sagely hosts and true responsive bodies, pervaded the Dharma-realm. Thereupon, the assembly of divine immortals, eighty-four thousand in number, held the Dharma-seal, bowed in reverence, and received the teaching.

Thus concludes Scroll Ten of the *Supreme Great Dao Jade Clarity Scripture*.
