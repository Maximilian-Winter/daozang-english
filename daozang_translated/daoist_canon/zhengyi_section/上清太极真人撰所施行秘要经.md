### *The Esoteric Essential Scripture Compiled by the Supreme Clarity Perfected One of the Great Ultimate*

The *Scripture of the Great Plain and Cinnabar Radiance* states:
Upon the face, one should frequently rub with both hands until warm, following the contours of the features in all directions until thoroughly covered. This will lend the face a luminous glow, preventing wrinkles and blemishes. Practiced for five years, the complexion will resemble that of a maiden. This is what is meant by "the qi of mountains and rivers, ever full and never depleted."

First, rub the hands until warm, then use them to wipe the face and eyes. Next, stroke the hair with the hands as if combing it. Alternately massage the two kidneys to prevent the hair from whitening and the vessels from floating outward.

The above passage is from the middle scroll of the *Scripture of Cinnabar Radiance*.

The *Massage Chapter of the Essence and Radiance of the Great Cavern Scripture* states:
Upon rising from sleep, sit upright and regulate the breath. First, clasp the hands and place them behind the neck, then tilt the head back to gaze upward, causing the neck to strain against the hands. Repeat this three or four times to harmonize the essence and circulate the blood, preventing the intrusion of pathogenic winds. Long practice ensures freedom from illness and death.

Afterward, bend and stretch the body, extend the limbs to their utmost, arch backward, and twist to the sides, shaking and loosening all joints—each movement performed three times. These are the oral instructions.

Upon rising, first use a handkerchief or thick cloth to wipe the neck on all sides and behind the ears until thoroughly warmed. Then, stroke the hair and massage the neck as if combing without ceasing. After a while, rub the hands and treat the face and eyes. Long practice sharpens the vision, repels pathogenic qi, prevents bodily filth and greasiness, and dispels impurities.

When finished, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the inner fluids.

The above passage is from the upper scroll of the *Scripture of the Essence and Radiance of the Great Cavern*.

The *Highest Inner Chapters of the Great Cavern Scripture*’s *Great Incantation for Suppressing Evil* states:
Whenever traversing perilous paths, passing through ghostly shrines, or encountering places of doubt or subtle taboo, or when the mind harbors slight apprehension about the journey ahead, first press the tongue against the inner upper palate and swallow saliva three times. Then, with the second and third fingers of the left hand, pinch the base of the philtrum beneath the nostrils—where the nasal septum meets the inner cavity—thirty-six times. Press firmly without lifting the fingers to count.

The area between the nostrils is called the *Mountain Source*. It is also named the *Ghost Well*, the *Divine Pool*, the *Root of Evil*, and the *Terrace of the Hun-soul*.

After pinching, knock the teeth together seven times, then advance the palm to cover the nose. Close the eyes slightly and recite the incantation:
*"The Vermilion Bird soars through the heavens, its divine might inwardly expanding. The Four Pillars of the Mountain Source stand firm; the Ghost Well flees in terror. The Divine Pool exhales its breath; the Root of Evil hides in submission. The Terrace of the Hun-soul shines in fourfold brilliance; the Jade Chamber resounds with tinkling jade. The Jade Perfected stands majestic, seated in the Hall of Light. Hands wave the purple auroras; the head wears the radiance of dawn. Reciting the thirty-nine chapters of the Cavern Scripture, within are the dragon and tiger that repel evil, severing mountains and cleaving hardness. Fierce beasts and charging oxen, bearing blades and swallowing blades. Lifting mountains and overturning heavens, the divine birds and poisonous dragons. Six leaders spew fire, devouring the King of Ghosts. The lightning essence and thunder father, seizing stars and scattering meteors. Owls and monstrous creatures, scorching and blazing, moving against the wind. Heavenly birds arrayed in ranks, all stand beside me. Spewing fire ten thousand fathoms long to dispel misfortune. The host of perfected beings open the Dao, sealing off the mountain villages. A thousand spirits and a hundred numina, all bow their heads in reverence. The marsh marshals hold censers, burning incense for me. Wherever I go, the myriad spirits welcome me."*

When finished, knock the teeth together three more times, then slowly open the eyes and withdraw the left hand.

Pressing the *Mountain Source* closes the gate of the *Ghost Well*; grasping the *Divine Pool* scatters the *Root of Evil*; covering the *Terrace of the Hun-soul* stations the *Jade Perfected* at the pass. Thus, the numinous root is stirred, celestial beasts come to guard, and a thousand spirits tremble in submission, unable to invade my qi. This is the natural principle, causing it to be so in an instant.

The *Mountain Source* beneath the nose is the martial ford of the body, the thoroughfare of the true and the evil. For those not true, it generates pathogenic qi; for those who are true, it suppresses the myriad evils. It lies within my control and regulation, hence the omens of fortune and misfortune manifest here.

The *Hall of Light* is also the body’s pool, the dwelling of life and death. Preserving its spirit allows inner contemplation to become boundless; abandoning its Dao leads to decay and putrefaction. Thus, life and death, regret and remorse are determined by my mastery and compliance with its art.

The above passage is from the first chapter of the *Highest Inner Chapters of the Great Cavern Scripture*.

The *Inner Methods of the Red Lord of the Southern Marchmount, Perfected One of the Great Void*, state:
On the fifth night of the lunar month at midnight, visualize the image of the sun within the heart, as if the sun enters through the mouth. Let it illuminate the interior of the heart, merging its light with the sun. When the heart feels warm and a rosy radiance appears as verification, recite the incantation:
*"The Great Luminance nurtures essence; within, the cinnabar heart is refined. Light and brilliance merge; the divine and the true come to seek me."*

Then swallow saliva nine times. Repeat this practice on the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days of the month.

This method sharpens hearing and perception, brightens all joints, lends the face the luster of jade, and the body the sheen of gold. Practiced for fifteen years, the Great One will dispatch a jeweled chariot to welcome you, ascending to the Great Empyrean.

The practice should be frequent, not limited to these specific days.

The above passage is from the middle section of the *Scripture of the Supreme One for Dispelling Demons*.

The *Scripture of the Supreme One for Dispelling Demons and Numinous Spirits* states: If the body feels unwell, press the tongue against the throat, gargle with saliva, and swallow it repeatedly. After a short while, the discomfort will naturally dissipate. In ordinary times, one should also feel the body relaxed and supple.

The above passage is from the *Preface to the Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Numinous Spirits*.

The *Upper Chapter of the Scripture of Dispelling Demons* states: Frequently press and massage the ears on both sides, without limit, to sharpen hearing. This is called "tending the city walls," and one’s name will be inscribed in the imperial registry.

It further states: Frequently press and massage the nose on both sides, without limit, to harmonize the qi. This is called "irrigating the Central Peak," and one’s name will be inscribed in the celestial records.

These two methods were transmitted by Lady Li of the Illuminating Terrace of the Square Zhang.

The *Scripture of the Supreme One on Halting Hair and Flourishing Splendor* prescribes a massage method: At the time of vital qi, swallow saliva fourteen times, then press the painful area of the body while facing the ruler and recite the incantation:
*"Left mystery, right mystery, the Three Spirits unite in perfection. Left yellow, right yellow, the Six Splendors align. Wind-qi and malign illnesses hide in the four directions. Jade liquid flows with luster, circulating above and below. Within, dispatch water and fire; without, ward off misfortune. Ascend to immortality and flying transcendence, the body ever at ease and strong."*
Afterward, swallow saliva fourteen times again. Practice this regularly to remain free of illness. Press the painful area thirty-one times in succession.

The above passage was transmitted by Lady Wang of the Right Radiance of the Cloudy Forest Palace.

The *Scripture of the Three and Five in Harmony with the Purple Script* states: When seated, keep the eyes closed and inwardly visualize the five viscera and intestines. With prolonged practice, they will naturally become distinct and clear.

The *Scripture of the Red Characters on Stone* states: Frequently cover the mouth and nose with the hands, exhale gently with the eyes closed, and after some time, saliva will form in the palms. Use it to massage the face. Regular practice will make the body fragrant.

The *Method of Inner Vision from the Purple Radiance of Blazing Light* states: Keep the eyes closed and sit upright, exhaling gently as if in repose, so that others do not notice. Then inwardly gaze and listen to the four directions, directing the ears and eyes to ten thousand *li* beyond. With prolonged practice, one will naturally perceive events at that distance. Focus the mind intently, and one may see a hundred thousand *li* beyond. The ears will also constantly hear the sounds of gold, jade, and silk strings—this is a wondrous method. The "four directions" are a general term; begin by focusing on one direction, then inwardly direct vision and hearing. At first, there may be no sign of success, but with time, one will naturally enter the marvelous.

The *Scripture of the Three Celestial Passes* states: Frequently press the corners of the eyes near the nose with the hands, holding the breath while doing so. Stop when the qi flows smoothly, then begin again. Regular practice will enable penetrating vision.

The above four passages were commanded for use by the Mysterious Master.

The *Record of the Supreme Ultimate* states: When combing the hair, face the direction of the king’s land. At the beginning of grooming, softly recite the incantation: *"Mud-pellet’s mysterious blossom, preserve essence and ensure its enduring presence. On the left, the hidden moon; on the right, the sun’s root. The Six Harmonies purified, the hundred spirits receive grace."* After reciting, swallow saliva three times. Regular practice will prevent hair loss and promote daily growth. Frequently change combs, using those with many teeth, ensuring no pain; one may also have an attendant comb the hair thoroughly. Thus, blood and fluids will flow unobstructed, and the hair roots will remain firm.

The above passage was commanded for use by An Jiuhua.

The *Scripture of Orthodox Unity and Peace* states: Perform prostrations while holding the breath, causing the hundred ghosts to tremble in fear. The Merit-Officials, the Dragon and Tiger Lords, may then appear and converse. This refers to those who practice with focused mind and enduring dedication. It further states: When burning incense, do not look back, for doing so disrupts the true qi and invites demonic responses. When entering the oratory door, first step forward with the right foot, then bring the left foot forward to align with it. Once inside, proceed as usual, allowing one’s petitions to ascend and be heard. It also states: When partaking in meals, do not speak of the dead, nor expose food, lest it attract hordes of malevolent qi. It further states: Bathe frequently, and on each *jiazi* day, one should wash the hair; if not, then at the start of each month, to enable communion with spirits. Bathing is not troublesome in itself—only that people often fail to do so, cleansing the corpse’s stench while the true qi has yet to enter.

The above passage was commanded for use by the Primordial Master.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Nine Transformations and Ten Transmutations for Renewal* states: If one treads upon filth or any unclean place, one should bathe and wash to dissolve the form and dispel it. The method involves ten *liang* of bamboo leaves and four *liang* of peeled white peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water in a cauldron until it boils white. Adjust to a suitable temperature, then bathe the body, and all filth will vanish. This not only removes impurities but also prevents damp impediment, sores, and itching. Moreover, bamboo is hollow and pure within, while peach repels evil and severs filth. Thus, these two substances are used to dissolve the turbidity within the body. When celestial beings descend and return, they invariably use this water to cleanse themselves. Even the common talismanic waters, incantations, and rinses of the world cannot compare to this method. Bathing with it is even better, though this water should not be used for washing the hair. The refined essence for purifying the corpse is precisely suited for bathing. Truly wondrous and secret.

The above passage was commanded for use by Lady Wang of Purple Tenuity.
