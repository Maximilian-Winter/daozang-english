**Collected Essentials of the Internal Elixirs of the Perfected, Scroll One**
Compiled by Master Xuanquan, the Daoist of Autumn Moon over Sea and Sky

### *Laozi’s Record at Hangu Pass* #1
Beneath the Azure Prime, sun and moon arise,
From two flanks they ascend, merging as one.
Forth from the Jade Pool into the Golden Chamber they flow,
Round as a pellet, hue like the tangerine,
Within lies a savor sweet as honey.
The śramaṇa attains it through dhyāna,
The yellow-robed through transcendence.
Should you obtain it, guard it well—
Lose it once, and your body shall perish.
Ascend the hidden pass, thrice winding,
Enter the Gate of Life, form unwearied,
Deep and fathomless, hard to entreat.

Sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,
All the ten thousand images, bright and clear.
Before the Three-Five, after the Three-Five,
Five-Six makes thirty, returning to life.
Life and decay cycle through twelve,
Twelve divides into twenty-four.
The twenty-four qi shift in turn,
All hexagrams and lines reside herein.

Quicksilver, one flavor, splits in two,
Paired with the yin bowels, consummation nears.
Once consummated, they become husband and wife,
Then one perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.
Red lead and black tin form the Great Elixir’s head,
From red to black is true cultivation.
From black extract the essence, from red the marrow,
Resolving red and black, the medicine is peerless.
Take red into black to preserve longevity,
Use black into red, and you become a Heavenly Immortal.
Inverting the two completes the return,
The Fire Dragon transforms into a Heavenly Immortal.

Students of the Dao, reflect on yourselves—
Do not transmit this to the greedy or lustful.
At Hangu Pass, at Liangshan’s mouth,
I now carve this stone to leave these words.

### *Song of the Returned Elixir by Immortal Zhongli of Zhengyang*
One mother bears two children,
One boy and one girl.
The boy is the root of yin, the girl the lord of yang.
When yin comes, yang abides,
Never losing their primal ancestry.
The spleen grinds, food digests itself,
Returning to the fertile earth.
Students are as numerous as hemp,
But the enlightened span past and present.
Seeing the dragon yet not knowing the dragon,
Encountering the tiger yet not knowing the tiger.
The dragon is not in the eastern dusk,
The tiger not in the western barbarians.
If you seek from the one source,
Brightly you will know what is hidden or revealed.
If you search east and west,
Even with eyes, you are as blind.

Yang resides in yin’s womb,
Yin in yang’s belly.
The boy is white, the girl red,
Naturally they become husband and wife.
Plant hemp, harvest hemp;
Plant millet, harvest millet.
If you do not recognize lead,
Your white-haired years will be full of toil.

Vague and indistinct,
The two things are hard to covet.
Dim and obscure,
The three clans seem like kin and performers.
Passion unites the myriad medicines,
Qi harmonizes without words.
Smelt lead and mercury until dry,
Like a cat crouching over a mouse.

### *Song of Stone Bridge by Immortal Zhang Ziyang*
My home lies north of Stone Bridge,
Where mountains lock and waters bar, ancient trees stand dense.
Beneath the bridge, the ravine’s waters flow to Kunlun,
Those who drink the spring find its fragrance rich.
My dwelling within the mountains is truly boastworthy,
The narrow land all planted with unfading flowers.
North of the mountain, a cave hides a fierce tiger,
Emerging from its den, it roars, birthing clouds and mist.
South of the mountain, the pool’s depths conceal a flood dragon,
Soaring through clouds, it descends rain, the sky grows dim.
The two beasts sometimes battle,
The Mysterious Pearl flies and hides, revealing auspicious signs.

The scene is fair, I rejoice in secret,
Pouring my own wine, I grow mellow with drink.
Drunk, I pluck a stringless zither,
Its notes teach me to listen closely.
Oh, the drunkenness—let none know!
Dazed and silent, I seem a fool.
Gazing up, I marvel at the workings of creation,
The sun sets in the west, the moon rises in the east.

Heaven is earth, earth is heaven,
Inverting yin and yang accords with nature.
Recognize where the Five Phases invert,
And you shall ascend the rosy clouds to return to the Grotto-Heaven.
A house of gold, beams of white jade,
Golden Lads and Jade Maidens attend before you.
The Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are arrayed in clarity,
The ten thousand images of the cosmos appear boundless.

No day or night, only ceaseless continuity,
Gathering and dispersing, the celestial fire-timing is complete.
Should you wish to know the true locus of the Golden Elixir,
Seek a master to reveal the lead within water.

Water begets fire, fire begets water,
Water and fire must distinguish front and rear ranks.
To discern ascent and descent, know host and guest,
Lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury then meet in union.

There is firmness and softness—do not grow complacent,
Knowing contentment, ever content, return to your root.
All ministers celebrate the Heavenly Peace,
When weary, the nation prospers, the people rejoice.

This song is fine for contemplation,
Those of the same Dao will grasp its meaning.
Later generations of cultivators,
Are but storing thoughts and circulating qi.
At hand, it is most easy,
Within daily use, it is your own.
Even if predecessors had fifty years,
I ask you: what did they study before?

This one gate holds savor,
Those who ingest it find its wonders unmatched.
First it dispels illness, then extends years,
Using fire to refine, transforming the yang body.
Students of the Dao, reflect on yourselves—
Do not be constrained by heterodox minor methods.
Knowing only to awe others in the moment,
Unaware of your own hidden withering.

I exhort later learners, be resolute in will,
Do not idly abandon home to wander distant lands.
The wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body,
How could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?

Do not procrastinate, indulging in greed and baseness,
Hasten to seek a master and grasp the Mysterious Pointer.
If in this life you do not learn to cultivate life,
Who knows what womb you may inhabit in the next?

Since you have the heart, see it through to the end,
The great matter of human life is only life and death.
If august Heaven betrays the Daoist’s heart,
It will plunge me into the Three Wretched Realms as a lowly ghost.

### *Golden Stone Paper Pavilion by Ma Ziran*
At the eastern edge of the great sea, the red solar wheel,
How many times have green mountains been ground to dust?
A hundred years hold thirty-six thousand days,
Each day, how many die and are born?

The Nine-Turned Numinous Elixir is not of the Five Metals,
Without divine transmission, it is hard to seek.
Should you wish to know the true immortal formula of mother and child,
First refine the medicine by learning to refine the heart.

Why strive to burn elixirs to preserve youth?
Bustle is not the marketplace, stillness is not the mountains.

At this time, men seek the elixir of long life,
Yet facing circumstances with a heart devoid is the great return.
Swiftly nurture the cinnabar field, swiftly nurture the spirit,
Use hidden virtue to aid the living.

If this body is not delivered in this life,
In what life shall this body be delivered?
To attain long life, tame the heart,
Do not dwell on past affairs or future days.
Simply in stillness, let spirit and qi unite,
What worry then of not reaching the groves of the great immortals?

*Mysterious Female Song by Pure Yang Lü True Man*
The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the Golden Mother,
Before Heaven and Earth, it conceals the true earth.
Embracing the origin, holding the One, it relies on generation,
A single qi, continuous through past and present.

The Flowery Pond’s divine water is the root of Heaven and Earth,
Refine it, consume it, and life endures.
Since ancient times, immortals have had no other method,
All rely on the Mysterious Female to establish their root.

The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known,
Fools imagine the kidneys and fixate the heart, idly laboring.
Immortals shatter all side doors,
Yet the deluded still cling to their errors.

May I ask, what is the Mysterious Female?
At a baby’s birth, first appear the two kidneys.
Between the two kidneys, a single point of light,
In reverse, it becomes the mother of the elixir; in sequence, it forms a person.
At the sprouting of the first yang, act swiftly,
Extract the white from the black, the existent from the nonexistent.
Within an hour, the elixir is complete,
Nine years and three years of mere waiting are in vain.

If people truly knew the Mysterious Female,
It is neither in the heart nor the kidneys.
Trace back to the moment of receiving qi at birth,
No wonder the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.

*Great Elixir Song by Pure Yang True Man*
The Three Clarities’ palaces lie hidden atop Kunlun’s peaks,
Sun and moon float in radiance, surpassing purple mist.
Pools and ponds brim with jade-like liquid,
Pavilions and terraces circulate divine springs in layers.

The Azure Dragon rides fire, lead becomes water,
The White Tiger surges waves, mercury turns to lead.
To seek the Kan male’s mate,
Rely on the Li female to forge the bond.

The Yellow Dame exhausts a thousand schemes,
The golden crucible blooms with a single lotus.
The chaste woman holds the crow on the left,
The general wears the hare to guard the west.

The Black Tortoise crouches beneath the red furnace,
The Vermilion Bird perches before the Flowery Pavilion.
Then, calming the spirit to glimpse the reflection,
After three cycles, the work is done, and one rides the cloud-cake.

*Song of Nature and Life*
To refine the golden elixir without comprehending nature,
This is the foremost malady in cultivation.
To refine only the true nature without refining the elixir,
For ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.

Grasping life’s foundation yet losing ancestral nature,
Is like a mirror without its precious reflection.
A man whose life spans Heaven and Earth,
Wields yin and yang as his fundamental handle.

When nature and life are complete, it is profound and mysterious,
The great waves at the sea’s bottom ferry the Dharma boat.
Only when the dragon’s head is captured alive,
Does one know the master craftsman’s skill is no empty boast.

*Rhapsody on the Golden Elixir by Immortal Lord Li*
The Dao originally has no form, the elixir arises naturally.
Once it soars and reveals its treasure,
One consumes it to ascend as an immortal.

Seize the two things within the furnace, called Dragon and Tiger;
Enclose the five phases within the cave, distinct as mountains and rivers.
Of old, men wandered the land of mystery,
Embracing the art of the True One.

Desiring longevity like Heaven and Earth,
Desiring a body as firm as metal and stone,
They gathered the essence of mercury,
Refined the substance of lead.

Forged with great fire,
Advancing fills, retreating empties;
Stored in the central palace,
Harvested in due time, used on appointed days.

Thus, the marrow of the west’s geng and xin,
The essence of the east’s jia and yi,
Emit purity, nurture excellence, bloom like flowers, flourish like herbs.
Observe its body—united yet distinct,
Probe its wonder—congealed and complete.

The Li female and Kan male,
Paired, they ultimately defy death;
The sun crow and moon hare,
Coming and going, they naturally attain long life.

The eight trigrams array around,
The nine palaces stand in formation.
Three hundred sixty days,
With shifting seasons and nodes;
Twenty-eight constellations,
Without repeated paths or fixed degrees.

Mercury subdues lead, lead subdues mercury,
The source of creation is hard to fathom;
Yang arises from yin, yin arises from yang,
Who can discern the numbers of their shifts?

Vast and obscure, within lies the Great Clarity.
From formlessness, form is born,
From namelessness, a name is forced.
Those who know its mechanism can steal the workings of creation;
Those who misunderstand its principle merely waste true primordial essence.

Refined through the nine returns,
One transcends the mortal to enter sagehood;
Swallowing a single grain,
One reverses aging to become an infant.

Alas! Ancient gallops and modern races,
Morning dashes and evening toils.
Household after household casts aside white snow,
Each and every one discards the yellow sprout.
The pure light departs and cannot be detained,
The rosy complexion fades and is hard to restore.

Reflecting on the awakening from the southern bough’s dream,
Wealth and honor are unreliable;
Contemplating the northern mound’s lofty tomb,
Merit and fame crumble in vain.

Some refine cinnabar into purple powder,
Smelt black tin to obtain dark frost.
Some dine on mist and feed on auroras,
Or abstain from grain to cease eating.
All claim supreme medicine,
Yet none follow the ancient methods.

How is this different from seeking fish in green trees?
The higher the tree, the more the fish elude;
Or drilling ice for fire?
The deeper the ice, the more fire vanishes.

Little do they know:
The body is the palace of qi,
Qi is the abode of spirit.
Continuing true qi with true qi, the spirit does not scatter;
Supplementing true essence with true essence, the form has a master.

Naturally, white bones grow flesh, and withered skeletons revive,
One can chase after Red Pine and follow Peng Zu.

*Azure Dragon Song by Heavenly Master Tian*
Heavenly Master Tian was originally a carefree wanderer,
In youth, he studied Confucian books and revered official virtues.
Had it not been for past-life ties to immortality,
How could he have received the true master’s wondrous formula?

The wondrous formula, few words spoken,
Before parting, he entrusted me with the pot’s song.
The song does not speak in common language,
It teaches the gathering of immortals’ deathless art.

One medicine, rootless and beginningless,
The primordial qi of before Heaven.
Expounding profound principles, there are alchemical texts,
*The Awakening to Reality* and *The Kinship of the Three*.
*The Kinship of the Three* speaks of immortal methods,
The Later Han’s true man, Wei Boyang.
Using the *Book of Changes* to elucidate the great medicine,
Left as the king of elixirs for ten thousand ages.

The essence of sun and moon, the marrow of Heaven and Earth,
Encompass the profound principles of the golden elixir.

Words subtle, prose plain, the Dao profound and deep—
Without true transmission, how could one fathom its mystery?

*The Awakening to Reality* speaks with utter clarity:
The celestial immortal’s formula for life eternal.
The Patriarch of Purple Yang, pitying those to come,
Revealed the celestial mechanism once more.

Man grows old, the crow caws in vain,
Its cry passing north of Black Crow Mountain, then farther west.
In *Spring in the Qin Garden*, the heartbreaking verse:
"Begin swift cultivation—yet even now, it may be too late."

To cultivate, to seek the great Dao,
Never mistake the Three Peaks for karmic retribution.
Three thousand six hundred are but side doors;
Apart from the golden elixir, all are false constructs.

Proclaim the great Dao, spread the mystic wind,
Revive the lineage of the southwest for an age.
Should one ask the immortal elder’s true lineage,
He was originally known as Purple Yang of Mount Zhu.

Long ago, the immortal elder suffered exile,
By chance in Yaolin he transmitted the secret to Shi Tu.
Later in Piling, he passed it to Niwan,
And Jade Toad’s ancestral name was thus established.

Alas for the dusty world, a flower in the mirror,
A human life—how many years can it last?
To restore the original true countenance,
Seek the root sprout where the Five Agents have no place.

Seek the root sprout—do so early,
Lest your own lead and mercury dwindle.
Year after year passes, growing ever fewer,
Waters flow, flowers fall, and man ages in vain.

Man grows old—if he would cultivate,
What need for precepts or scripture-reading?
Only cast aside discrimination, uproot love and hate,
And with an impartial mind, the Dao will naturally flourish.

To cultivate, endure humiliation willingly,
Let spittle dry on your face without retaliation.
If I wrong another, calamity will extend;
If another wrongs me, it turns to blessing.

In seeking the great Dao, embody unyielding metal,
Let hardship and worry never stir the heart.
Wealth and poverty, high and low—Heaven has ordained them;
Lose or gain, sink or float—let it be.

To cultivate, there are tasks to perform:
To learn the Dao, first learn to sit in meditation.
Yet if one sits in dry emptiness, it is still in vain—
Drawing cakes to allay hunger only leaves one starving.

To learn the great Dao, prepare the elixir chamber,
The room must be secluded, the land must be auspicious.
If the land is not auspicious, the spirit will not abide;
Even with the true seed, it will suffer harm.

To refine the elixir, one must find companions,
Three like-minded souls to guard one another.
Without such comrades of the same resolve,
The great medicine will not form, and mercury will flee.

To learn the great Dao, seek a kindred spirit,
The elixir’s head must be the gold within water.
Without accumulated merit and hidden virtue,
One may wander the world’s edges yet find it nowhere.

To cultivate, await the proper time,
Having met the master’s transmission, do not act rashly.
Keep it deeply hidden, never boast to others,
Lest you invite demonic hindrance and disrupt the great work.

To learn the great Dao, tend to the household,
Rely on gentleness and harmony to nurture the utmost truth.
When the virtue of earth is thick, the elixir’s virtue is thick—
Speak only of concern for the Dao, not for poverty.

If one worries over poverty, the Dao is hard to discern;
When the elixir way is complete, all such concerns vanish.
Roam the four seas at will,
For the traveling kitchen will provide sustenance.

To cultivate the true, dwell amidst the mundane,
Not by abandoning home or forsaking wife and daughter.
Clothing and food through the seasons must be supplied,
And one must not shun the cold of dawn or the heat of dusk.

After the elixir is complete, one may leave the household,
Dwelling in grotto palaces and famous mountains through the years.
Sleeping under dew, dining on wind, roaming sea isles,
With cloud shoes and moon staff, traverse the ends of the earth.

To cultivate, avoid incurring debt,
For who does not love wine, sex, wealth, and temper?
Ordinary folk cling to these and harm their spirit;
If I love them, there is no obstacle.

I love wine—yet I have immortal friends,
No need for measures or yeast jars.
A fine brew from Snow Mountain,
Poured into the gourd, it flows to the lips again and again.

I love sex—yet mine differs from others’,
Not seeking rest in the bridal chamber’s depths.
Within the brothel’s smoke and flowers, immortals hide;
On Vulture Peak’s assembly, seek Mahākāśyapa.

I love wealth—yet mine comes from the Dao,
Not to buy beauties or handsome talents.
Rather, buy a youth and a crone,
To sit in purity all day, refining the platform elixir.

I love temper—yet mine holds power,
Not like Xiang Yu contending for hegemony.
Slay the flood dragon in the Eastern Ocean’s depths,
Execute the tiger cub on Western Flower Mountain’s heights.

The dragon can chant, the tiger can roar,
To seize the tiger and capture the dragon, there is a knack.
Should you doubt, ask Guanyin—
The dragon maiden’s pearl offering reveals the Dao’s wonder.

The tortoise can fly, the serpent can dance,
Hidden in the north, known as True Warrior.
Yin and yang blend as the essence of water and fire,
Immortal sages descend to become the Dao’s ancestors.

The root of nature, the stem of life,
Though named differently, they emerge from one source.
Unite them in one place to form the elixir,
Returning to the primordial qi of before Heaven.

The stem of life, the root of nature,
The primordial, majestic, supreme honor.
Take them to refine the medicine of longevity,
A single grain preserves your nature and life.

The essence of the sun, the radiance of the moon,
Hidden in the southwest, in the households of Li and Kan.
Seize them, lock them in the cauldron of Qian and Kun,
Where kingfisher clouds rise to veil purple mist.

The radiance of the moon, the essence of the sun,
Jade hare and golden crow—two luminaries shine.
Westward they go, eastward they come, without fixed direction,
Yet where the two crescents meet, the great elixir is born.

Yang spirit-soul, yin spirit-corpses,
Soul and corpse conceal each other in mutual abode.
To seek soul and corpse, go to Qian and Kun,
Then reverse the sun and moon in Kan and Li.

Yin spirit-corpses, yang spirit-soul,
The wise first enter through the gate of Wu and Ji.
Within the gate of Wu and Ji lies true earth;
Rely on the mysterious female to establish the root.

Water turns to lead—just one flavor,
Neither spirit nor qi.
It is the root of nature and life,
Hidden within the precelestial heart and Kan.

Do you not see the path to Heaven?
To refine the elixir without hindrance, yin must assist.
Observe the Jin dynasty’s battle against Jingyang’s magistrate—
Who raised his dwelling and ascended in flight—was this not so?

Do you not see the road to Penglai?
After three thousand deeds are fulfilled, one rides the clouds away.
In days of old, Lü Dongbin of the Tang,
Even now still seeks others to deliver.

The White Tiger Song of Heavenly Advent:

To scoop the moon from the heart of the Northern Sea’s waves,
First bind the clouds on the Southern Mountain’s ridge.
If one understands this intent,
One may ride the flying crow to meet the Primordial Sovereign.

Half the moon shines on the Western River,
A single crow flies over the Northern Sea’s head.
Moon sets, crow sinks—nowhere to be found,
In the Palace of Broad Cold, one rides the ox backward.

The Gate of the Mysterious Female stands open all day,
Within lies a single aperture merging with the numinous terrace.
No bolt, no lock, no guardian attends—
Sun and moon, east and west, come and go as they will.

The lead cauldron gleams, its light casting shadows upon the curtain,
Snow-white flakes of river and mountain descend in delicate strands.
Returning late from the Jade Pool’s feast,
One steals a sweet peach of immortality.

To gather the herb, one must recognize the moon in the heavens;
To refine the elixir, one must know the gold within the water.
If the moon lacks the *geng* qi or gold lacks water,
Even with true lead, one’s efforts are in vain.

Plant the seed in the Valley of No Death,
Upon the rootless tree, flowers bloom of themselves.
A single fruit of primordial chaos is formed—
Swallowed into the cinnabar field, it blazes like fiery mist.

Since ancient times, few live to seventy,
When the hexagram’s qi nears its end, none can reclaim it.
To begin cultivation swiftly is already too late;
When impermanence arrives, regret comes too late.

Wealth and poverty, fate’s presence or absence—
In cultivation and discerning the Dao, subtle reckonings unfold.
If one does not strive to become a divine immortal,
One squanders the life of a true man.

The sacred proclamation of the Dao’s Primordial Heavenly Ancestor:
Clearly, dragon and tiger are the perfected truth.
Who could have foreseen that in a dream upon Green Mountain,
Within the six directions, eternal spring is concealed?

Vast and unfeeling are the six paths of existence,
Yet from a single qi, the myriad transformations arise.
Different names emerge from the same source—this is the root of the Dao;
The same source with different names—this is the name of the elixir.

Atop the White Jade City, jade nectar is refined;
Within the golden crucible, golden lotuses are sown.
When the fire is sufficient, the elixir forms with ease;
After ten months of frost, the medicine must be firm.

Where the tiger roars on the mountain, wind arises;
When the dragon intones in the sea’s depths, waves surge.
After the tiger’s roar and dragon’s cry cease their battle,
Wind calms, waves still, and the infant is born.

The Azure Dragon rides the fire, soaring with the Vermilion Bird;
The Dark Warrior, hungry, devours the White Tiger’s gold.
Inverting *kan* and *li* depends on *wu* and *ji*;
Drawing and adding rely on *bing* and *ren*.

Half a catty of true mercury, half a catty of lead—
Precisely at mid-autumn, the moon reaches its first quarter.
If one encounters midnight, do not gather;
At the full moon’s height, words fail.

To see yet not perceive is not blindness;
To hear yet not listen is true deafness.
If one understands seeing others as seeing oneself,
Hearing as if not hearing—this is true wisdom.

The Jade Hare’s eastern descent brings heat;
The Golden Crow’s western rise brings cold.
Knowing the marvel of inversion within the mysterious,
Do not compare short and long before others.

Inversion begets reversal, reversal begets inversion—
A nameless infant is born.
To know whose child this infant is,
It is the primordial essence before heaven and earth.

The wondrous vessel, once formed, is marvelously strange,
Encompassing the myriad images, harmonizing with heaven’s mechanism.
Stars, constellations, sun, and moon turn with the mechanism—
Even the inversion of heaven and earth goes unnoticed.

Supreme virtue acts without striving, without contrivance;
Lesser virtue acts with effort, with purpose.
If one wishes the Dao to arise from supreme virtue,
One must first establish roots in lesser virtue.

Do not boast of partial insights or broad investigations;
Without understanding the root, do not speak loftily.
Heaven and earth are the true root and foundation—
Recognize this, and the Dao is not difficult.

**Liu Haichan’s True Man’s Song of Returning Elixir, Dispelling Delusion**

I have heard that the world speaks of the golden elixir,
Many study it, but few attain it.
It is not in water, nor in mountains—
Originally, it lies only within the human realm.

The returning elixir is near yet unrecognized;
Seek it within the qi between midnight and noon.
Knocking teeth, striking drums—thousands of methods,
Yet the more one seeks the golden elixir, the harder it becomes to find.

Closing the eyes, concealing the gaze, stilling thoughts—
When it emerges from the mouth, one cannot hear it.
Taking this as the method to ascend to heaven,
One finds it unrelated to true pain or joy.

A hundred days of qi circulation yield no result,
Leading only to old age and death in vain.
The sage circulates qi with natural rhythm,
For life and destiny are not obtained through qi alone.

Holding the breath until the belly swells and the face turns sallow,
Exhausting the mind and strength in qi circulation—
Who has ascended to heaven through qi circulation?
Who has prolonged life through it?
A thousand practice it, a thousand die—
Refining the golden liquid is not like this.

The great Dao of immortals relies solely on the elixir,
Which can sustain one for a thousand years.
The thirty-six qi method for pacifying the spirit,
Between midnight and noon, ceaselessly applied.

Yet I sigh for fools who love to delve into Chan,
Competing in clever words through each sitting.
Even with all the oral instructions, death cannot be avoided—
True Buddha Dharma is not like this.
This *is* the true Buddha Dharma, the true Dao—
One child, two brothers.

Embracing the two qi to form a single elixir,
Where else would one seek the spirit?
The immortals’ true lead, true mercury, true dragon and tiger—
Without recognizing the *daogui*, one seeks in vain.

The method of union—one phrase—
Reveals lead and mercury, recognizes the golden elixir.
If the golden elixir is to be attained, it is not difficult,
But the human heart’s cunning breeds obscurity.
Seeing it before one’s eyes yet not recognizing it truly,
Recognizing it yet blaming the body for practicing qi circulation.

If one mistakenly practices qi circulation, when will it be mastered?
The golden elixir can be accomplished in a hundred days.
The three fields forever yield the yellow sprout,
And for ten thousand years, the body remains unharmed.

Between midnight, perform four tasks,
Yin and yang descend together, all interconnected.
Externally draw yin, internally embrace yang—
Inversion and contemplation lie entirely within oneself.

With the left hand, grasp the Azure Dragon’s head;
With the right, seize the White Tiger’s tail.
At once, it enters the mouth, gradually sweetening—
Only then does one know this substance’s fragrance and beauty.

This is the gold within water,
Mastering the mysterious gate, possessing the principle.
The myriad truths’ essential collection of inner elixirs, first scroll—**concludes**.

*(Note: The title is incorrect. It should be* Pure Yang True Man’s Golden Liquid Returning Elixir Song*.)*

**The Myriad Truths’ Essential Collection of Inner Elixirs, Middle Scroll**
*Compiled by Xuanquanzi, the Daoist of Autumn Moon over Sea and Sky*

**Queen Mother’s Oral Instructions**

Eating and drinking unceasing—body never light;
Sound and sight unceasing—spirit never clear.
Thoughts and cares unceasing—heart never still.
Heart not still, spirit not efficacious;
Spirit not efficacious, the Dao unachieved.

The essential subtlety lies not in gazing at stars or worshipping the moon,
Nor in tormenting the body through toil.
What is prized is profound stillness within the square inch,
No restless striving—
Only then may the Dao of immortality yield long life.

It is also said: banish defilement, halt thoughts,
Still the heart, guard the One.

**The Supreme Lord’s True Instructions on Inner Contemplation**

Non-arising as essence—
What arises is the human heart.
The heart has three aspects:
Past, future, and present.

The past heart arising is called *thought*;
The future heart arising is called *anticipation*;
The present heart arising is called *pursuit of phenomena*.
These three hearts, ceaseless day and night,
Exhaust the spirit and deplete qi,
Lose one’s true numinosity,
And obscure the original dharmakāya.
Through countless kalpas of rebirth,
All is these three hearts—
From ancient times to now,
Who has ever escaped?

If one seeks liberation,
Awaken to the original face before father and mother were born.
What is there?
Neither heart nor thought,
Self and other both forgotten—
Naturally in accord with the Dao.
Thus it is said: *non-arising as essence*.

Non-extinction as function—
Extinction means no desires arise,
All entanglements severed,
Heart and thought both forgotten.
Non-extinction is one’s true nature.
True nature is the Dao’s function;
The Dao is nature’s essence.
Essence and function distinct,
Responding to things without delusion,
Everywhere unobstructed,
Nature manifest, heart extinguished.
Thus it is said: *non-extinction as function*.

Essence and function attained in truth and constancy—
To attain truth and constancy is to be unbroken each day.
The true person naturally dreams no dreams.
No dreams—ever abiding in the Dao,
Naturally dreamless.

The prior thought is the guest;
The guest is the transient.

The heart is called the guest—when it arrives, simply receive it and let it pass. The later thought is the host; to be the host is to know thoughts and dispel thoughts. When thoughts arise, do not cling to them. Not clinging means returning home by the path, originally without root or trace.

The *Scripture of Purity* states:
*Inwardly observe the heart—heart has no heart;
Outwardly observe the form—form has no form;
Observe things afar—things have no things.
When these three are awakened, only emptiness is seen—
Neither color nor image.*

The prior thought is thought—
The prior thought stirs waves without wind.
The later thought is illumination—
Illumination is water; water returns to its source.
Remove defilement, cease thought—
Ceasing thought is the function of non-extinction.
Illuminate the heart, guard the One—
To guard the One is to keep virtue constant as at the beginning,
To grasp the meaning and forget the words.

Only extinguish the moving heart—
Ever knowing, ever aware.
Do not extinguish the illuminating heart—
Not extinguishing the illuminating heart,
Samādhi and prajñā are perfectly clear.
If the illuminating heart is not extinguished—
When the illuminating heart is not extinguished,
One dwells in desire yet without desire,
Abides in dust yet transcends dust.
The body is like the great void—
The body like the great void is unseen when looked upon,
Unheard when listened to.
Annotation: *Departing from all extremes.*
Simply concentrate the empty heart—
The empty heart is unattached within and without.
Do not fix the mind—
*Inwardly observe the heart—heart has no heart.*
When active, employ illumination—
*Passing through a forest of a hundred flowers, not a single leaf clings to the body.*
Do not rely on any dharma—
*Before father and mother were born, neither heart nor dharma—what is there that is not so?*
Yet the heart abides constantly—
*Inner thoughts do not go out; outer thoughts do not enter.*

If sunk in emptiness and quiescence without illumination—
*Forgetting what can be forgotten, the heart that can be lost is no more.*
Movement is being pulled by things.
If illuminated without quiescence—
*Knowing movement, not abiding in stillness,
Recognizing spirit as the master,
Turning things without departing from the source.*
Quiescence and illumination both complete—
*Purity and stillness unite with the Dao.*
Penetrating the source of the Dao—
*Bright and clear, spirit settled and serene,
Steaming and permeating the hundred meridians,
Reaching everywhere, filling the entire cosmos.*

Quiescence and illumination both dissolved—
*Neither ox nor man is seen, transcending all directions.*
A pure breeze fills the pavilion—
*Attaining non-action, returning to the root and restoring the origin.*
There is arising yet no arising—
*All entanglements are severed.*
There is transformation yet no transformation—
*Vast kalpas endure eternally.*
That which arises cannot arise—
*The body is like withered wood, the heart like cold ashes.*
That which transforms cannot transform—
*Nature abides, life halts.*
Thus one can be ever-arising and ever-transforming—
Ever-arising is the black of yang.
Ever-transforming is the essence of the five grains;
Yin obtains the true fire of the nine yangs and transforms itself.

No time is not arising,
No time is not transforming—
No time is not arising means the heart-fire descends moment by moment.
No time is not transforming means the kidney-water ascends instant by instant.
Harmonious fire permeates, filling and circulating everywhere;
Observing the inner realm, unbroken at all times.
Refine essence into qi, refine qi into spirit, refine spirit to merge with the Dao.

The scripture states:
*To know and cultivate refinement is to be a sage.*

**Oral Instructions of the Mysterious Origin**
Black lead and red mercury—head of the great elixir,
Entering black from red is true cultivation.
Extract essence from black, blood from red;
Resolving red and black, the medicine is peerless.
Using red to enter black ensures longevity;
Using black to enter red, one becomes a celestial immortal.
One is lead, also called the sovereign.
Two is mercury, also called the minister.
If lead is not true, mercury will not draw near.
If mercury is near, it does not lose its place as minister.
The green-waisted messenger, the red-blooded general—
Harmonizing the two natures, different clans in the same flock.
White mercury becomes the brain, yellow sprouts the root.
Transforming lead into powder, refining mercury into dust.
Yin resides in yang’s position, yang’s number evenly balanced with yin.
The moon waxes as the sun wanes, cold and heat distinctly divided.
Opening and establishing the method’s image, resplendent with patterns.
Only this Dao of ours endures with heaven and earth.

**Song of the Crucible**
Three times five, one inch and a fraction.
Mouth four times eight, lips two inches.
Two feet in length, thickness even.
Belly with three navels, sitting warmly.
Yin above, yang rushing below.
Head and tail martial, center civil.
Beginning at seventy, ending at thirty days.
Internally one hundred, well-regulated.
Yin fire white, yellow sprouts silver.
Coming and going, wandering without leaving the door.
Gradually growing large, nature and temperament pure.
Then returning to the One, restoring the origin.
After one cycle, great toil.
Guard it closely, do not grow confused or dull.
The path is distant, profoundly subtle.
If you attain this, you will comprehend heaven and earth.
Midnight and noon, nourishing soul and spirit.
Attaining longevity, entering the immortal village.
Those who delight in the Dao, seek its patterns.
Contemplate deeply—no need for further discourse.

The Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire Phases of the Golden Elixir

Sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,
Their hexagrams revolving, most clearly shown.
Three and five before, three and five behind,
Five and six make thirty, then life returns anew.
Born and extinguished, cycling through twelve,
Twelve divided yield twenty-four.
The twenty-four qi mutually shift and change,
All hexagrams and lines refined within this frame.

Quicksilver, one flavor split in two,
Transforms yin and yang to form *jiwei*.
*Jiwei* then paired as husband and wife,
One perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.

The Perfected One of Pure Yang said:
Great indeed are these twelve verses,
Harmonizing with the five thousand words.
At the very beginning, original nature
Is the supreme spirit of primordial origin and form,
The one numinous essence that governs life.
The root-source of life’s stem is prior to heaven,
The formless supreme essence,
The one qi that preserves nature.

Spirit and essence are the foundation of nature and life.
This one numinous true nature
Is obscured by the heart.
The pure unity of life
Is enslaved by the body.
If one can preserve the body so that life’s foundation is ever firm,
And still the heart so that nature’s root is empty and numinous,
How can life be secure without nature?
How can nature be enduring without life?
Nature and life are originally one,
Yet in movement they become two.
Today’s scholars each cling to one side.
To perfect the great Dao of the True,
There is nothing but the unity of nature and life.
To achieve this unity,
One must simply purify the heart and quiet the mind.
When heart and mind are pure and still,
The myriad dharmas naturally return to their root.

Why is it that through countless generations,
People cannot preserve their nature and life
And realize the great Dao?
Because the heart follows things and drifts,
Nature is turned by things,
The mind covets beauty while life is lost to desire.
Those who depart from these two realms
Cling to minor practices, acting and moving,
Grasping heterodox methods, deludedly cultivating and striving.
They invoke the names of golden elixir and medicinal substances,
Terms like "withdrawing and adding," "exploring and circulating,"
A thousand kinds, ten thousand forms—
All merely different labels.

If one knows that the golden elixir is formless,
That medicinal substances have no name,
That fire phases have no fixed time,
That withdrawing and adding involve no action—
One who can grasp this
Does not cling to any single method
Nor lean toward one side.
Utterly unburdened, not a trace remains,
Vast and luminous, the spirit-light shines universally.
Only then does one reach the path of spontaneity,
Enter the gate of the great Dao,
And understand that "non-doing" is true doing—
Called the "exploration without exploration."

For example:
Nurturing life without knowing nature
Is like a spirit in the valley.
Seeing nature without preserving the body
Is like a yin ghost without light.
If one can make nature true and life complete,
One is called an immortal of virtue and power.

[Song of the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir]
The golden fluid, returned elixir, flows with immortal splendor,
Soaring high, ascending the celestial mounds.
The red and yellow substances form in an instant,
At that moment, yin and yang divide the chaotic pearl.
One can then transform and summon the traveling kitchen,
With spirit-people and jade maidens accompanying me.
Entering and exiting without question, in harmony with heaven,
Its essence congeals like frost, skillfully rising and sinking.
You must be reverent and respectful—it will surely come to visit.

For those who wish to cultivate the true, nurture nature,
Practice the Dao, refine the form,
And congeal the black to become spirit,
With a beginning and end that are endless—
Nothing precedes stillness.
Thus, stilling nature establishes stability,
Stilling spirit enables transformation,
Stilling the black engenders life.

When cultivating stillness,
Turn inward to listen and observe,
Let the heart not entertain reckless thoughts,
The mouth not speak reckless words,
The body not make reckless movements.
The color of no-color is seen,
The sound of no-sound is heard,
The flavor of no-flavor is savored,
The teaching of no-words is imparted.
Divine radiance descends,
Fortune and virtue arrive,
Harmonious qi responds.

If you wish to still the spirit,
First bathe and fast for twenty-five days,
Then refine your body,
Harmonize hun and po,
And only then enter the chamber.
After entering,
Perhaps a cinnabar snake will enter your heart,
Or the Queen Mother descend,
Or a Dao-body manifest—
These are all spirits within your body testing you.
Do not be startled or afraid;
If questioned, do not answer;
If harmed or offended, do not fear.
Simply calm the heart and settle the mind,
And the beings will depart on their own.

After twenty-five days, forty-five days, eighty-five days,
One hundred and five days, one hundred and twenty-five days,
One hundred and fifty days, one hundred and eighty days,
Spirits will come—all testing you.
Simply remain calm and do not respond;
They cannot harm you.
If you feel fear,
You will fail the test
And lose the Dao.
Be cautious, be vigilant.

After one hundred and eighty days,
The chamber will brighten on its own,
And you will foreknow safety and danger, life and death.
The palaces within your body will all become visible.
After two hundred and eighty days,
All illnesses will be cured.
After one year,
Scars will vanish.
After a thousand days,
Form and spirit will both be wondrous,
And you will unite with the sagely and true.

Verification of the Golden Elixir

First:
After great effort,
One must diligently guard for a hundred days,
Abiding in a quiet chamber,
Externally unattached,
Internally free of thought.
The body like withered wood,
The heart like cold ashes,
All conditions suddenly cease,
Merging with the great void,
Using the spirit-light,
Day and night cherishing it.
After three to five days,
The heart naturally settles,
The black harmonizes,
Joy is boundless,
Humility and reverence toward others arise.
The sages spoke of five-day intervals.

Second:
Suddenly, one feels the heart-fire descend,
The kidney-water ascend,
The five viscera generate fluids,
The hundred vessels flow freely,
The heart meridian surges upward,
The nose detects strange fragrances,
The tongue produces sweet saliva,
Hunger and thirst cease,
Sleep vanishes day and night.

Third:
Kan and Li unite in marriage,
Essence and black reverse their course,
All gates open,
Qi flows harmoniously through the four limbs and hundred vessels.

Fourth:
At night, it is as bright as day,
One sees through walls,
Foreknows human affairs,
Beholds heaven above,
Views hell below,
Nothing obstructs—
This is the reach of the spirit-light.

第五：
At night, the elixir field comes alive,
Connecting in front to the black courtyard,
Behind to the secret gate,
Red mist swirls above the crown,
A halo emerges between the brows,
The eyes shine with radiant clarity.

Sixth:
Do not regard this as strange—it is the power of the medicine taking effect.
The spirit of wisdom leaps and dances,
Singing and reciting verses of its own accord,
Uttering wild words—
This cannot be restrained,
For it is the work of the Three Corpses.
If not guarded against, all prior efforts will be undone.

Seventh:
Now joyful, now sorrowful,
Laughing and conversing with others,
Discoursing on mysteries and expounding the Dao—
This too is the delusion wrought by the Three Household Demons.

Eighth:
Though the hundred gates are open,
The five grains’ blackness is not yet purged,
Yin’s blackness not yet exhausted,
Illness not yet dispelled.
The practitioner must swear an oath to Heaven,
Refine the heart with utmost dedication,
Sever attachments to love and desire,
Abandon self and others,
And hold no partiality toward things.
With right mindfulness ever present,
Inner and outer become as one,
Seizing Heaven and Earth’s true qi,
Drawing out yin to exchange for yang.
Appetite may wax or wane,
Turbid flows stream unceasing from the nose,
The mouth emits foul odors,
With restlessness, retching, and nausea.
Within the abdomen, constant ascent and descent,
Thunder roars, lightning strikes,
Wind and clouds burst forth,
Qi surges both fore and aft.
The grains are refined into silver paste,
Like pellets strung together.
From the intestines and stomach, foul impurities are smelted out,
Their stench unbearable.
Then, as they swirl downward,
A creamy, oily slick descends,
Its fragrance rich and strange—
All who draw near can smell it.
Urine flows in five hues of cinnabar.
This is the theft of the myriad things.
If not vigilantly guarded, the blackness may scatter.
Should the heart grow lax and the body weak,
The Three Corpses will rise as one,
The Six Wastrels all converge,
Disturbing the heart’s spirit.
In quiet sitting, doubt arises,
Fear and unease take hold,
Sleep is broken by startling dreams,
And evil visions know no end.
Dwell in a secluded chamber,
Strictly avoid foul odors,
All manner of fragrances,
And miscellaneous impurities.
Also shun raw, cold, or hard foods,
As well as the salty, savory, pungent, and sour.
Failure to do so will damage
The true blackness of the five viscera.
When the five viscera’s blackness is restored,
Its ascent and descent flow without obstruction,
The hundred vessels course freely,
Primordial qi fills the abdomen,
Hunger and thirst naturally cease,
Neither famine nor thirst is felt.
Gradually, one may feel stifled—
Do not regard this as strange.
After the seventh day,
Vitality grows stronger,
The spirit becomes clear and the blackness bright,
Sleeplessness persists day and night,
Until the myriad spirits fall utterly silent,
And blackness returns to the primal sea—
Only then does the appetite return.
Having resumed the five grains,
All flavors must be strictly avoided,
For they harm the generative blackness.
The initial rinsing blackness
Cannot contend with the grains’ blackness.
Should illness suddenly strike,
Perverse qi assails the heart,
The Triple Burner falls out of harmony,
The five qi fail to arise,
The three barriers seal shut,
Appetite wanes.
Cold and heat come in their seasons,
Yet wax and wane unpredictably,
The mouth turns sour and astringent,
Neither ascent nor descent occurs.
Between heart and lungs,
Stagnation congeals into blood,
Which may suddenly surge upward in retching,
Expelling cups of purple-black blood—
The illness then gradually recedes.
Saliva may suddenly swell upward,
Then descend the Tower of Nectar,
To be swallowed in an instant,
Its fragrance exquisite,
Washing clean the Triple Burner,
The five viscera and six bowels,
The hundred gates and spirit cavities—
All become crystalline and free-flowing.
The Three Fields reverse their course,
The Silver River gleams bright,
Pearls gush forth,
All illnesses vanish—
This is the mending of Heaven’s loss.
Each year, when consuming the five grains,
The mouth constantly savors their fragrance,
The heart-spirit is harmonious and joyful.
With every circulation,
The hundred vessels align,
The four seasons are at peace,
Naturally attuned to Heaven and Earth’s
Movement of yin and yang,
The intervals of the sun and moon’s passage,
The cycles of day and night—
None deviate from their measure.
Within the ears, wind howls,
The heart is startled and fearful,
Thunder crashes, lightning flashes,
Fire engulfs the body,
Smelting the golden essence,
The host of yin disperses,
The Three Corpses vanish without trace,
The elixir field’s blackness harmonizes,
Spirits gather in the Central Palace.
Within, the nature is unseen,
Without, the form is invisible.
In the realm of the indistinct,
Like a cat seizing a mouse,
In the depths of the unfathomable,
Like a roc snatching a hare—
The fire passes through the clear and cold.
Appetite wanes,
Gradually giving rise to signs of emaciation.
Now rising, now descending,
The navel and abdomen ache,
The cheeks feel as if pierced by awls,
The six bowels resound like tearing silk.
These are the latent illnesses of the viscera,
Assailed by the medicine’s power,
All erupting at once,
With constant parched thirst.
Drink licorice decoction,
But strictly avoid all else.
The five spirits grow unclear,
The chest and diaphragm feel stifled,
The heart is in a daze,
Sleep is restless—
Do not regard this as strange.
Simply focus the heart and guard it,
Slowly expelling foul and strange impurities,
And the illness will gradually recede.
At times, when the hundred gates are unobstructed,
The myriad spirits assemble,
The five blacknesses all merge,
Returning to the primal sea—
Naturally, all becomes still.
Breath no longer passes through mouth or nose,
Pulse no longer resides in the inch and bar—
This is true great stillness.
If stillness is perfected for a full hundred moments,
One becomes a Great Luo Immortal.
Should illness arise in the body,
Like fire steaming the Four Great Elements,
Day and night, one is dazed and stifled,
Unconscious,
Every joint aching,
Pain as if pounded to pieces,
Fire scorching and refining,
Sinews and bones like silk—
Then, suddenly, sweat breaks,
And all is well.
This is true shedding.
Only when water and fire share the furnace,
The five blacknesses unite as one,
The Four Great Elements are free of yin,
Pure yang flows through,
The golden liquid refines the form,
Form and spirit both become wondrous,
And merge with the Dao in truth—
The five phases become useless,
The spirit roams the immortal realms,
Beyond the world, carefree and unbound.
When true qi is fully replete,
Yin naturally vanishes,
The divine light thereafter envelops the body,
The hundred vessels surge in harmony,
A thousand streams of joyous sound arise,
Yin demons are utterly dispelled—
This is the verification of cultivating the true.
Wherever one goes, sages and worthies are dispatched to attend,
Golden writs and purple decrees arrive in due time,
The body remains in the mortal realm,
Yet the heart abides in the sacred.
