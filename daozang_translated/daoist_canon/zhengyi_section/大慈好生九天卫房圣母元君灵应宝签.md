**Preface to *The Divine Oracle of the Merciful and Life-Nurturing Nine Heavens’ Chamber-Guarding Saintly Mother, Primordial Sovereign***

According to the *Jade Pivot Scripture of the Nine Heavens*, the Heavenly Worthy declares: Among the world’s husbands and wives, in their unions, some transgress the *Xianchi* (Celestial Pool), some offend the *Tiangou* (Heavenly Dog). The Three Punishments and Six Harms, the clashing of opposing angles, solitary yin and widowed yang, the snares of Heaven and Earth—these render progeny difficult, leaving many childless and alone. Should one seek a son, recite this scripture, and the Nine Heavens’ Great Deity of Life-Monitoring shall summon spirits and command winds, that a worthy child may be born.

At the hour of birth, when *Taiyi* (Great Unity) stands at the door and the *Siming* (Director of Destinies) lingers in the courtyard—whether due to karmic debts, malevolent spirits, taboos, or inauspicious misfortune causing difficult labor—recite this scripture, and the Nine Heavens’ Chamber-Guarding Saintly Mother shall silently assist in delivery, ensuring joy at childbirth and safety in confinement.

We bow in reverence to the Merciful and Life-Nurturing Nine Heavens’ Chamber-Guarding Saintly Mother, Primordial Sovereign, who dwells exalted above the Nine Heavens, governing the Three Realms. She proclaims the Heavenly Worthy’s sacred virtue of life-nurturing and executes the decrees of yin-yang generation. From empresses to common women, all receive her salvation; the birth of all beings falls under her purview. She records the good and evil of humankind, discerns the chastity or waywardness of women. Those of virtue are reported to the Jade Capital; the gods are commanded to protect and bless them, their names inscribed in the registers of immortals, their years extended. Those who transgress are reported to the Three Officials, handed to the Bureau of Five Thunders for judgment. According to the Jade Statutes, punishments are meted out: they suffer illness, distress, and peril, their souls bound to *Dengdu* (the Dark City), forever submerged in the Sea of Suffering, eternally severed from the True Dao.

The virtuous are granted worthy sons and grandsons; the unworthy endure世代苦厄, beset by manifold sorrows. Vast are the merits of the Saintly Mother, Primordial Sovereign—her life-nurturing virtue extends not merely to the moment of birth but bestows grace upon a lifetime. All deeds, good and evil, are duly recorded.

Yet among the people of the world, few know to revere her, while many betray the Sovereign’s benevolence. Now, by imperial decree, ninety-nine divine oracles have been bestowed, each revealing wondrous principles and boundless mysteries, illuminating the profound and manifesting the celestial. They clarify the statutes for rewarding goodness, declare the Thunder Bureau’s decrees for punishing evil, rebuke the wicked and malevolent, exhort filial piety and benevolence, reveal the yet-unseen fortunes and misfortunes, and expound the compassion of the Great Dao. They make known good and evil, foretell fortune and misfortune, guiding the people to practice the Way of goodness and avoid deviance and wrongdoing.

From women to the suffering and the lost, all owe their existence to the grace of the Primordial Sovereign. Now, in accordance with her command, the Nine Heavens’ Bureau of Life-Monitoring is instructed to lead the divine generals and spirits in adherence to the precepts of *The Divine Oracle of the Merciful and Life-Nurturing Nine Heavens’ Chamber-Guarding Saintly Mother, Primordial Sovereign*. Let those who inquire do so with sincere faith, reverently offering incense and lamps to the Saintly Mother to seek her blessings. Take care not to slight her, lest you incur guilt and retribution.

The divine generals’ majesty must not be treated lightly. Those who honor her shall be shielded from myriad disasters, protected by the gods. Those who disdain her shall suffer illness in life and the blade of the wind in death. How can one fail to revere her?

**Eulogy by the Three Heavenly Saintly Masters**

Wondrous indeed are the ninety-nine divine responses,
Profound truths and boundless sacred mercy.
Fearing sentient beings may forget right mindfulness,
She bestows oracle words to guide the lost.
The people of ten thousand regions are all fortunate,
Yet a thousand clever schemes are all in vain.
If one is willing to practice loyalty and filial piety,
I shall personally report to the Phoenix Terrace.

Sighing in vain for another’s child.

Will never bear fruit.

**Thirty-First Oracle**

Sorrow and lament weigh heavy.

**Thirty-Second Oracle**
Flowers bloom and fade, yet may bear fruit,
Drenched by rain, shaken by wind—they refuse to take root.

In this life and past lives,
No good causes have been sown.

old and young rejoice together.

**Thirty-Sixth Oracle**
Knowing only wealth and power, you scorn the spirits,
Yet Heaven’s law is clear—what mercy can you expect?
A thousand bushels of gold and pearls dissolve like a butterfly’s dream,
A lifetime of fame and profit melts like ice in a furnace.

you mock the divine.
