### **The Hidden Secrets of the Grand Empyrean**

For those who cultivate the Dao of the Seven Stars’ Shifting Degrees, to summon the Nine Lords of the Jade Terrace, with the inner illumination of Mysterious Essence, severing the roots of death—one must still the heart within the secluded chamber, untouched by worldly dust. Stand alone before the altar, gazing upon the dawn of the empyrean, burning incense to left and right, dispersing mist and clouds across the courtyard. With focused intent and unyielding contemplation, visualize without wavering.

After seven years of such practice, a jade chariot with a flying canopy and cinnabar carriage poles shall descend to welcome the adept’s body, ascending through the Celestial Pass. The path of death shall be sealed in the northeast, and the record of life inscribed among the Southern Immortals. This is the rarely attained Dao, the easily descended Perfected.

Those whose names are inscribed in the Golden Register and Jade Roster, having received this Dao, shall choose the six auspicious conjunction days: *renyin*, *bingyin*, *jiazi*, *jiawu*, *xinwei*, and *xinchou*. These are the times when the Most High aligns with the celestial harmonies.

On these days, the Jade Emperor commands the Jade Lads of the Eastern Palace of Azure Radiance to verify the Golden Register and Jade Roster of those studying the Dao. For those who, with diligent resolve, ascend to move the Jade Emperor, he shall order the Six Palaces of Fengdu under the Northern Emperor to sever the roots of the death register, inscribing the life register at the Gate of Man. The Seven Stars shall be secretly arrayed over the Ghost Gate, traversing the Mysterious Pivot to part the Celestial Pass.

At each purificatory retreat, with focused intent and absorption in the Mysterious, close the eyes and inwardly visualize. Strike the teeth thirty-six times and contemplate the First Great Star, the Mysterious Pivot of Yang Brightness, the Celestial Pivot, the Hun-Spirit of the Supreme Nine Lords of the Upper Mystery. Clad in a flying cloud-brocade skirt, crowned with the diadem of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body, recite the incantation:

*"O Mysterious Pivot of Yang Brightness, Celestial Pivot, Hun-Spirit of the Supreme Perfected Nine Lords of the Upper Mystery, merging and transforming as one spirit, I beseech you: sever my path of death at the Ghost Gate, inscribe my life record at the Southern Pavilion, dispel the Seven Mysteries from the Three Paths, receive rebirth to become an immortal, return the Seven Essences to the Mysterious Shade, and convey my form through the Celestial Pass."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi fourteen times.

With unwavering cultivation, one shall summon the guests of the Jade Emperor, who descends upon clouds of purple radiance, attended by twelve Jade Maidens of Precious Blossoms and twelve Golden Lads of the Jade Dawn, guarding the adept’s body.

Next, contemplate the Second Origin Star, the Northern Womb of Yin Essence, the Celestial Rotator, the Hun-Spirit of the Supreme Jade Nine Lords. Clad in a flying yellow brocade skirt, crowned with the diadem of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body, swallow the qi and recite the incantation:

*"O Northern Womb of Yin Essence, Celestial Rotator, Hun-Spirit of the Supreme Jade Nine Lords, merging and transforming as one spirit, I beseech you: excise my yang transgressions in the Great Yin, convey my yin qi to the Great Yang, shift the Seven Origins to sever death, part the Six Harmonies at the Celestial Pass, extricate my seven ancestors from the Three Paths, and receive the root of rebirth at the Southern Pavilion."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi fourteen times.

Next, contemplate the Third Perfected Star, the Nine Ultimates of the Supreme Perfected, the Lady of the Upper Origin, the Celestial Mechanism, the Po-Essence of the Supreme Plain Nine Lords. Clad in a flying azure brocade skirt, crowned with the diadem of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body, recite the incantation:

*"O Nine Ultimates of the Supreme Perfected, Lady of the Upper Origin, Celestial Mechanism, Po-Essence of the Supreme Plain Nine Lords, merging and transforming as one spirit, I beseech you: unbind the roots of karmic opposition, sever the source of the death path, grant me eyes that see clearly and penetrate the infinite. May the Mysterious Perfected gaze upward to infuse me, and may my essence irrigate my body. Ascend to grasp the August Keeper, tread the Seven Origins, ride the luminous void, and commune with Heaven."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi fourteen times.

Next, contemplate the Fourth Pivot Star, the Unfettered Mechanism of the Mysterious Dark, the Celestial Balance, the Hun-Essence of the Supreme Void Nine Lords. Clad in a flying purple brocade skirt, crowned with the diadem of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body, recite the incantation:

*"O Unfettered Mechanism of the Mysterious Dark, Celestial Balance, Hun-Essence of the Supreme Void Nine Lords, merging and transforming as one spirit, I beseech you: shift and convey the Seven Stars, seal the Ghost Gate, obstruct the qi of death, part the luminous Celestial Pass, return the Northern Dipper to the Mysterious Pivot, convey the qi of life to the Western Kun, depart from the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, and inscribe my name at the Southern Pavilion."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi fourteen times.

Next, contemplate the Fifth Rigid Star, the Celestial Balance of Cinnabar Origin, the Jade Balance, the Hun-Spirit of the Supreme Mystery Nine August Lords. Clad in a cinnabar brocade cloak and skirt, crowned with the diadem of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body, recite the incantation:

*"O Celestial Balance of Cinnabar Origin, Jade Balance, Hun-Spirit of the Supreme Mystery Nine August Lords, merging and transforming as one spirit, descend the Seven Essences upon me, revolve the Four to return the Three, open the Seven Origins, seal the death gate in the northeast, receive the life palace of the Nine Mysteries, inscribe my name in the Eastern Radiance, and attend the Jade Dawn."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi fourteen times.

Next, contemplate the Sixth Chronicle Star, the Life Mechanism of the Northern Culmen, the Opening Yang, the Hun-Spirit of the Supreme Cinnabar August Void Nine Lords. Clad in a flying vermilion brocade skirt, crowned with the diadem of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body, recite the incantation:

*"O Life Mechanism of the Northern Culmen, Opening Yang, Hun-Spirit of the Supreme Cinnabar August Void Nine Lords, merging and transforming as one spirit, open for me the Three Charts of the Celestial One’s Mysterious Pass above, revolve the Six Palaces of Fengdu under the Northern Emperor below, govern the yin officials, eradicate the roots of the Nine Deaths, return the Three to the Four, convey my name through the Seven Origins, eternally preserve me, and share the Dipper’s longevity."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi fourteen times.

Next, contemplate the Seventh Pass Star, the Mysterious Yang of the Celestial Pass, the Shaking Radiance, the Great Brightness, the Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord. Clad in a flying cinnabar brocade gauze skirt, crowned with the diadem of the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into one’s body, recite the incantation:

*"O Mysterious Yang of the Celestial Pass, Shaking Radiance, Great Brightness, Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord..."*

The Mysterious Yang of the Celestial Pass, Shaking Radiance, Great Brightness, Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord—merged with the myriad transformations as a single spirit—wish to summon for me the Nine Perfected Lords of the Imperial Dawn. The Nine Yin merge as one, revolving the Gate of Heaven, releasing my Seven Mysterious Ancestors, allowing them to roam the clouds of the Mysterious, severing my roots of death in the Northern Yin, and inscribing my name in the Jade Register of Eastern Florescence.

Upon completion, swallow the qi fourteen times.

Once the contemplation of the Seven Origins is complete, knock the teeth twelve times. With eyes closed, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, their radiance blazing and illuminating the north. The essence of the stars shines inwardly, descending to cover my body. The Perfected Lords within the Dipper undergo primordial transformations, their forms ever-changing. Together, they ride clouds of verdant mist to welcome my body, ascending into the midst of the Seven Stars. I perceive myself within the Dipper’s central canopy, resplendent with luminous essence, a crown of light encircling my body. Following the Dipper’s revolution like a wheel’s turning, in but a moment, the Celestial Pass opens. The Seven Stars and Nine Lords each bestow upon me the talismans of the Seven Origins for Opening the Pass, to govern the Six Palaces of Fengdu under the Northern Emperor and sever the roots of deathly qi.

Having received the talismans, I revolve and return to my original essence, once more within the Dipper. The seven talismans blaze with illumination like the essence of fire, propelling me downward. Suddenly, I tread upon the void, and in an instant, I am peacefully settled upon my resting couch. Knock the teeth thirty-six times, then raise the head and recite the incantation:

*"Mysterious radiance shines with essence, flowing light startles form. Riding mist, I vanish and transform, ascending to the Seven Stars. The turning jade mechanism urges the reins, swift as lightning’s startled flight. The Celestial One opens the Pass, conveying me to life’s dwelling. In the Northern Emperor’s yin palaces, my name of death is erased. If not conveyed, if not erased, I turn to the Seven Essences. I bear the Seven Origins, flowing gold and fire bells. The mechanism of the Opening Pass scatters through the Eight Darknesses, dispatching the Six Jia, driving the Six Ding. Heaven sends down its Mysterious Cover, the Emperor grants divine soldiers. I beseech the Eastern Florescence to inscribe my jade name. Soaring through the void, I ascend to the Jade Purity."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi thirty-six times in a single breath.

Thus concludes the Dao of opening the Celestial Pass, severing the roots of death, and merging the myriad transformations. Practicing this for seven years, bearing the talismans of the Seven Origins for Opening the Pass, one will possess a chariot of flying mist and verdant clouds to welcome the body. This must be cultivated in secrecy; do not transmit it lightly.

The talismans of the Supreme Lord for Opening the Pass of the Seven Origins are contained in the following scroll.

Once the practice of conveying and transforming through the Seven Stars is complete, and after seven years of cultivation, one bears the talismans of the Seven Origins for Opening the Pass.

Within the scroll, the images of the Perfected are depicted. Aside from those already annotated, they wear jade-green crowns and green sashes, crimson robes and vermilion shoes, riding upon clouds of five colors. When visualizing the Perfected, each wears a jade-green crown and yellow robes, green sashes and azure skirts. The palaces and halls are adorned with gold, arranged as befits their splendor.

**The Method of the Northern Emperor’s Six Palaces of Fengdu for Conveying the Dead**

Mount Fengdu lies in the north, in the land of *gui*. Thus, the northeast is the gate of ghosts and the root of deathly qi. The mountain rises sixteen hundred *li* high, with a circumference of thirty thousand *li*. Its primordial cavern lies beneath the mountain, with a circumference of fifteen thousand *li*. Both above and below, there are palaces of ghosts and spirits. Atop the mountain are Six Palaces, and within the cavern are another Six Palaces—each palace spanning a thousand *li*—constituting the Six and Two Celestial Palaces of ghosts and spirits.

The first is named the Palace of Utter Yin, Cutting Off.
The second is named the Palace of Grand Execution, Faithful to Affairs, the Ancestral.
The third is named the Palace of Bright Dawn, Enduring Transgression, the Martial City.
The fourth is named the Palace of Tranquil Illumination, the Qi of Sin.
The fifth is named the Palace of the Ancestral Numen, the Seven Wrongs.
The sixth is named the Palace of Daring to Administer, the Winding and Repeated.

These Six Palaces are governed by the Northern Emperor and administered by the ghostly spirits of the Six Heavens. They oversee the names of the dead, and none who die do not pass through the Six Palaces of Fengdu. Therefore, the Supreme Lord constantly employs the Seven Stars to convey and transform the practitioner, passing through the Celestial Pass, opening the Southern Culmen’s palace to sever and block the northeastern gate of death.

Once the practice of conveying and transforming through the capital is complete, knock the left teeth nine times, call the names of the Six Palaces, and recite the incantation:

*"I am a servant of the Supreme Lord, my name inscribed in the Jade Purity. Below, I govern the Six Heavens and the ghostly palaces of the Northern Emperor, all within my command. Whatever is under my jurisdiction—what ghost dare arise? To my right, I bear the Opening Pass; to my left, I carry fire bells. Casting fire for ten thousand *li*, my might subdues the myriad spirits. Those who transgress are slain; those who offend are destroyed. By the Supreme Lord’s command, I capture without cease."*

After reciting this once, the celestial light trembles and the myriad demons are bound in form. After three recitations, the ghostly *xie* are extinguished at their roots, the Six Palaces erase the names of the dead, the Celestial Pass conveys the living, and the Southern Culmen gives life to humanity. Those who do not know the names of the palaces of Fengdu or which spirits govern them, who do not learn to sever and block the roots of death, will never attain immortality.

Once the practice of conveying and transforming through the Seven Stars is complete, next visualize and contemplate the Two August Stars of the Imperial Honored Ones. Sit upright facing east, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the Two August Stars: the Highest Jade Emperor of the Eight Effulgences, the Nine Perfected Lords, and the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity, the Primordial Lords of the Seven Stars of the Great Plain. Clad in skirts of purple brocade and flying clouds, crowned with the diadem of the Mysterious Dawn, they descend from the Mysterious Dipper into my body. Recite the incantation:

*"Highest Jade Emperor of the Eight Effulgences, Nine Perfected Lords, Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity, Primordial Lords of the Seven Stars of the Great Plain—merged with the Nine Transformations as the Two August Ones of the Supreme Emperor—open the Celestial Pass above for me, convey and transform my jade name, sever and block the ghostly gate, cutting off the roots of death in the Six Palaces of the Northern Emperor. Ascend to the Seven Origins, bestow upon me the Eight Effulgences, the Seven Essences, the Nine August Ones’ flying chariot of verdant clouds. Together, we ascend to the Imperial Dawn, collectively attend the August Consort, and command the myriad spirits."*

Upon completion, swallow the qi twenty-one times.

Next, visualize the two talismans of the Imperial Honored Ones ascending into the canopy of the Seven Stars. The governance of the Two August Stars lies beneath the canopy, constantly covering the two stars. Their luminous essence is unseen, and no one beholds them. Thus, the golden script and jade characters state: *"One who beholds the Two Stars extends life by six hundred square years."*

Without the Two Emperors’ flying celestial talismans, you cannot ascend beneath the canopy of the Seven Stars, nor will the Two Stars reveal themselves to you. Only when you bear the two talismans will the Two Emperors bathe your body in their dark radiance. After nine years of cultivation, you shall ascend to the Imperial Dawn in broad daylight.

The supreme method of severing the Five Separations, absolving transgressions, cutting off death, and transcending into life—this is the Way of the Six Convergences and the One Initiation. You must cultivate the Five Dawns to depart from the Gate of Death and attain the method of transcending into the Palace of Life, where immortals take flight. On the days of the Five Separations—*ren-shen*, *bing-shen*, *wu-shen*, *jia-shen*, and *geng-shen*—the Imperial Lords hold grand feasts. Their jade-green chariots, adorned with emerald canopies, descend to the mortal realm accompanied by immortal officials and jade maidens, circling the Ten Heavens. They inspect those who study the Dao, while the Northern Emperor and the Five Lords of the Great Dark carry the Registers of Death to the Accounting Palace of Fengdu, where they examine and verify the Ledgers of Life.

The True August Lords of the Five Directions and Five Stars each govern one direction, collectively overseeing all immortals who are destined to attain the Dao, their names bound in the Scroll of Radiant Flowers. For those burdened with yin transgressions, yang sins, or offenses recorded in the Palace of the Great Yin under the Northern Emperor—where the separation of the good and evil, the living and the dead occurs—the days of the Five Separations are when sins are first confessed to the Great Yin, life is cultivated in the Great Yang, death’s records are stricken from the Northern Emperor’s ledgers, and transcendence is sought from the Five Stars.

On each of these days, don fresh robes, burn incense, and enter your chamber. Repent your transgressions, contemplate virtue, focus your spirit within, and concentrate your mind upon the Mysterious, free from all other thoughts. As the Imperial Lords traverse the Three Realms, the divine officials record your merits and present your name to the Jade Emperor. After five years of such practice, the True August Lords of the Five Stars will descend into your chamber.

On the days of the Five Separations, at dawn, noon, and midnight, enter your chamber, burn incense, face north, bow twice, and click your teeth three times. Recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Jade Emperor and August Lords, I beseech you to absolve the yin evils and unrighteous deeds committed by my seven ancestors and myself—killing, lust, arrogance, harm, and transgressions beyond count—both yang sins and yin offenses, all recorded by the Northern Emperor. I beg you to disperse and erase these names, sever the roots of death, and transcend the Celestial Pass, that I may be inscribed in the Jade Register of the Eastern Flower. May my seven ancestors and parents be reborn in the Southern Immortals’ realm."*

Conclude by visualizing the True August Lord of the Northern Star, the Dark Origin, clad in a purple brocade flying skirt, a tiger tally at his waist, and a floral crown upon his head. He rides a chariot of green mist and flying clouds, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the north to cover your body. His radiance is dense and luminous, his essence resplendent. Look up and recite the incantation:

*"True August Lord of the North, sovereign of all flying immortals, descending in clouds with your canopy, come and crown my body. I beseech you to seal the ghostly gate, sever the roots of death, inscribe my name in the Jade Purity, and unlock the Celestial Pass. May I depart from the Northern Emperor and ascend to the Southern Terrace, my lifespan bound to the True August Lord, together safeguarding the Northern Dawn."*

Then swallow the *qi* twenty-five times and cease.

Face east, bow twice, and click your teeth three times. Visualize and recite the incantation:

*"August Lord of the Jade Dawn and Lord of the Primordial Radiance of the Great Ultimate, I beseech you to absolve the yin sins and yang offenses I have committed since my first year, along with the heavy transgressions of my seven ancestors, all bound in the Three Yins. I beg you to release and dissolve these names, seal the roots of death, erase my past entanglements from the Northern Emperor, and inscribe my name in the Jade Register of the Eastern Flower. May my seven ancestors and parents ascend together to the Imperial Dawn."*

Next, visualize the Central True August Lord of the Eastern Star, Azure Tooth, clad in a cloud-brocade skirt adorned with dragon patterns, a tiger tally at his waist, and a floral crown upon his head. He rides a jade chariot of azure mist and flying clouds, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the east to cover your body. His radiance is lush and resplendent. Face east and recite the incantation:

*"Central True Lord of the East, whose flowing radiance fills the Nine Gates, illuminating within and without, crowning my body, I beseech you to petition the Northern Emperor to sever my roots of death, transcend my jade name, and admit me among the inner immortals of the Eastern Flower. May I ascend and forever depart the path of death. May my seven ancestors and parents enjoy blessings, their lives bound to the moon’s waxing and the sun’s setting, riding the void to float upon the heavens, ascending in flight."*

Then swallow the *qi* nine times and cease.

Face south, bow twice, and click your teeth three times. Recite the incantation:

*"Three Primordial Lords of the Upper Clarity, Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen, and Jade Worthy Lord of the Nine Qi of the Great Yang, I beseech you to absolve the primordial evils and unfilial deeds I have committed since gaining awareness—rebellion, unrighteousness, lewdness, theft, yin sins, and yang offenses—along with the entanglements of my seven ancestors, all recorded in the Great Yin and bound in the Northern Dawn. I beg you to release and dissolve the records of the Three Officials, sever the roots of death’s *qi*, transcend the northeastern gate, and ascend to unlock the southwestern pass. May my seven ancestors and parents all receive the Emperor’s grace."*

Conclude by visualizing the True August Lord of the Southern Star, Blazing Delight, clad in a cloud-frost skirt adorned with phoenix patterns and dragon bells, a tiger-script tally at his waist, and a crown of the Dark Dawn upon his head. He wears a flying azure brocade robe and rides a crimson chariot of vermilion mist, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the south to cover your body. His radiance blazes like the rising sun. Recite the incantation:

*"True August Lord of the South, whose dark radiance flows through the Three Gates, ascending in a vermilion chariot to the Seven Origins, your inner light shining brilliantly, crowning my body, sever the Northern Emperor’s recorded sins, dissolve entanglements, and disperse the Great Yin. May I depart the ghostly gate, cut off the roots of past entanglements, unlock the Celestial Pass, and ascend to the Southern Terrace. May my seven ancestors and parents together pay homage before the Emperor."*

Then swallow the *qi* eight times and cease.

Face west, bow twice, and click your teeth three times. Recite the incantation:

*"Three Primordial Lords of the Great Simplicity and Four Elders of the Dao’s Center, I beseech you to absolve the offenses I have committed since gaining awareness—envy of the worthy, careless disclosure of scriptures, treading in filth and defiling the pure, defiling the Three Luminaries, and swearing oaths that bring sorrow—all offending the August Lords, with entanglements recorded in the Great Yin and sins bound in the ghostly officials. I beg you to release and dissolve these roots of judgment, sever the path of death, and inscribe my name in the Gate of Life. May my seven ancestors and parents ascend to the Hall of Blessings."*

Then conclude.

Next, visualize the Perfected Sovereign of the Great White Star of the West, clad in a luminous brocade skirt adorned with flowing bells, a tiger-patterned sash at his waist, and the *Fuchen* crown upon his head. He rides a chariot of pale mist, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the West to overshadow your body. His radiance pierces through, illuminating the Western Quarter with resplendent brilliance. Then recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Perfected Sovereign of the West,
Pale light illumines the mysterious standard,
Triple-drawn jade chariot,
White effulgence soars through the heavens.
Turning the morning star, he descends,
His true form revealed in splendor.
For me, he revolves the Nine Portals,
Conveying my body to the imperial court.
My name departs the records of Great Yin,
Ascending to the Mysterious Palace in shared song.
My lifespan rivals heaven and earth,
Unwithering for a hundred million years.
My seven ancestors and parents
Together ascend the dawn’s celestial heights."*

Conclude, then swallow the *qi* six times and cease.

Next, face center, bow twice, and click your teeth three times. Recite the incantation:

*"Most High Supreme Thearch, Jade Sovereign,
I beseech you to absolve the myriad transgressions and countless offenses I have committed from birth until this day—entanglements of my seven ancestors’ karmic bonds, unresolved and bound in Great Yin.
I beg you to dissolve and release them,
Scatter and sever my name from the Dark Thearch’s records,
Cut the roots of death’s *qi* from the *Guihu* of *Gui* Earth.
Convey my name through the Celestial Gate,
Passing through the Five Mornings.
May my seven ancestors and parents
All attain rebirth as immortals."*

Conclude.

Next, visualize the Perfected Sovereign of the Central Star, *Dancheng Yan*, clad in a yellow-cloud dragon-brocade tiger-skirt, a golden talisman at his waist, and a purple crown upon his head. He rides a flying chariot of yellow mist, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the center to crown and overshadow your body. His radiance pierces through, illuminating the Middle Primordial with dazzling brilliance. Then recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Perfected Sovereign of the Central Star,
Who governs the Five Thearchs and turns the Mysterious Net,
Triple-drawn through yellow mist,
Circulating through the Four Quarters.
For me, sever the roots of death,
Convey my name to the Southern Yang Palace.
Departing the Five to return to the Six,
Soaring with me in shared flight,
Transforming through ten thousand streams,
Eternally enjoying boundless life.
Ascend to the Supreme Ultimate’s Golden Gates and Jade Hall,
My seven ancestors and parents
Together bearing blessed prosperity."*

Conclude, then swallow the *qi* twelve times and cease.

Thus, the five transgressions are severed before the Five Thearchs, and the Five Mornings are visualized to convey life. The ritual concludes here.

If performed unfailingly on its appointed days, after seven years the Five Mornings’ Perfected Sovereigns will be moved to manifest in your bedchamber. The Supreme Thearch will personally dispatch five Jade Maidens of the Five Directions to guard your body, and the Dark Thearch of Great Yin will come to pay homage at your gate, no longer daring to bind you with your sins.

Those who seek immortality and pursue the true Dao should practice this diligently.

This method of repentance for transgressions to seek immortality was requested of the Golden Gate Sage by the High Minister Azure Lad, serving as a warning for later learners seeking life—it is not the repentance ritual of the Supreme Thearch himself. If you perform these rites, the Thearch will also witness your sincerity. Should past transgressions remain unresolved, the Six Heavens’ Palaces will not strike your name from the records of death, nor will the Gate-Opening Bureau convey your body. Thus, the Bureau of Union and Separation and the Gate-Opening Bureau—the latter being the Palace of Life-Conveyance, the former the source of death’s filling—depend entirely on your devoted pursuit to attain the true Dao.

**The Supreme Thearch’s Inner Illumination Method for Seeking Immortality**
*Transmitted by the Upper Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen*

The Thearch constantly dwells in the Bright Mystery Terrace, within the golden chambers and purple gates. He illumines himself with the Mysterious Lamp, radiating rosy light through the eight windows, contemplating the Great Perfected in the Five Forms, and unfolding the Three Vows in the Thearch’s chamber. The numinous descends upon the Purple Canopy, and the Primordial Sovereign bestows golden lads. Naturally, he is titled the Thearch’s rank, governing the Mysterious Palace. The Supreme Grade arises from the wondrous beginning; the Dao resides in the faintest glimmer. Now I impart this to you—practice it diligently.

The Upper Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen declared: "You who study the Way of divine perfection, dwelling in the numinous palace above, within the jade chambers—yet do not know how to illumine yourself with the Mysterious Lamp, radiating its light within the Five Viscera, thereby attaining clarity. The spirits of your form and body will thus return to their source.

If you can light the lamp at your *benming* in the evening, at your *xingnian* in the morning, and constantly at *taisui*, making vows in these three places, your body will become serene and your *qi* upright. The true light will inwardly illumine, and the myriad spirits will shine with clarity."

The Primordial Sovereign received and practiced this method for three years, whereupon twenty-four Night-Light Lads arrived, and the Mysterious Light naturally brightened—no longer requiring the lamp to radiate its glow.

This is the wondrous method of the Highest Perfected, not transmitted to the lower world. If one bears a golden name and jade script in the Mysterious Register, practicing this for nine years, their body will radiate light, seeing clearly for ten thousand *li*. The natural vision will be luminous, and the Night-Light Lads will descend to your chamber, bestowing upon you the true scriptures. You will ascend to the morning in broad daylight.

Constantly light the lamp above your *benming* in the quiet room where you dwell. In the evening, enter the room, face the lamp, and kneel lengthwise. Click your teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

*"Mysterious light illumines Great Yin,
Eight directions bright and clear.
Serene spirit within the secluded chamber,
Gazing upward to the radiance of Highest Clarity.
Five glories arise from the Luminous Terrace,
Jade mushrooms naturally grow.
Piercing illumination connects to the Great Perfected,
The myriad spirits watch over my form.
Eradicating the *qi* of the Nine Yin,
Inscribing my name in the Eastern Florescence.
Preserve me without end,
Ever parallel with the sun and moon.
Deliver me from the seven ancestors’ calamities,
Receive greater glory in the Southern Palace.
Mysterious light plays before the Jade Thearch,
Receiving the Inner Illumination Scripture.
Heaven descends the flying rosy chariot,
Soaring through the void in a green carriage.
Attaining audience in the Thearch’s hall,
Advancing to bow in the Jade Thearch’s court."*

Conclude, bow twice, face your *benming*, raise your head, and swallow saliva seven times.

Also, constantly light the lamp above your *xingnian*. In the morning, face the lamp, click your teeth twelve times, and recite the incantation:

*"Bright lamp illumines my *xingnian*,
Scattered light blazes in the eight directions.
Infant-like hues, serene and clear,
Inner vision merges with empty brightness.
Releasing and illuminating the spirit’s robe,
I commune with the Jade Perfected.
Gazing upward to the lofty Highest Dao,
Vast and distant, without trace.
Yearning for the descent of mysterious clouds,
Reining the flying dragon’s bridle.
Reversing my hundred-year span,
Returning to an infant’s countenance.
Bestow upon me the Maiden of Western Florescence,
Grant me the Golden Morning Lad.
Attending incense, treading the years of life,
Bowing my head in the Jade Thearch’s chamber.
Spirit at peace, the Dao flows smoothly,
Fear dissolved in the incense smoke.
Composing my heart, I focus on the Great Mystery,
Devotion piercing the Void’s depths.
The chamber summons the Divine Empyrean’s descent,
Eyes closed, beholding the Immortal Lords.
Delivering my seven ancestors from calamity,
Conveying my form to return to the Southern Palace."*

Conclude.

Upon completion, bow twice more, face the lamp, and swallow qi thirty-four times.

Always light a lamp on the Tai Sui star to commune with the spirits, fulfill vows to seek the True, and after three years, the mysterious radiance will inwardly reflect—divine perfected ones will descend, bestowing upon you the method of deathlessness. At that time, responses will naturally arise.

Morning and evening, burn incense, strike the teeth twelve times, and facing the lamp, recite the incantation:
*"The lamp’s flame illumines the Supreme Perfected,
Its bright light piercing the Mysterious Void.
Unveiling the peerless Dao,
Heart fixed on the Jade Thearch’s chamber.
Penetrating the hollow vastness within,
The spirit beholds, the form relaxes.
Cumulative devotion summons the numinous descent,
Heart serene, principles subtly dwell.
At dawn, I worship in the Thearch’s hall,
At dusk, I chant the Golden Perfected’s scripture.
Roaming freely within the Mysterious Capital,
For ten thousand years, I revert to an infant’s visage.
A celestial crown of purple auroras,
The Thearch grants a jade-green chariot.
Floating atop the Five Peaks’ summits,
Following my will to attain all desires.
Seven ancestors escape the Three Wretched Realms,
Blessings and fortune overflow in abundance."*

Upon completion, bow twice more and swallow saliva thirty-four times.

If you can perpetually keep lamps lit in three places without extinguishing them, the Seven Mysteries and Nine Ancestors will immediately depart the Ten Sufferings, ascending to the Southern Immortals. Your body’s spirits will become pure and upright, your eyes seeing ten thousand miles, your ears hearing distant sounds, your mind’s wisdom foreseeing the yet-unmanifest. Divine perfected ones will descend, and the Radiant Lad of the Night will teach you the Dao of immortality-seeking. After nine years of this practice, your numinous radiance will naturally brighten, penetrating both inner and outer.

The Five Separations will absolve transgressions before the Five Thearchs; store the Five Mornings to transcend life. The matter concludes here.

**The Five Vows of the Thearch-Lord for Immortality-Seeking**

The Thearch-Lord regularly observes the following five days of vows and ten assemblies: the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, and the seventh day of the seventh month. Ascend to the Jade Terrace of the Supreme Ultimate, within the golden chambers of the lofty Jade Palace. There, hold the Five Vows in the jade palace, yearning for the descent of the Mysterious Perfected. The Void initiates the Jade Thearch, golden tones resound through the Great Empyrean, summoning the Five Thearchs to guard the numinous. Myriad blessings converge in the cinnabar chamber—thus, devotion elicits the True, and the True, moved by devotion, descends.

On these days, always bathe in purity and fast, enter the chamber to burn incense, and with a sincere heart, bow to the four directions. Sit upright, facing east—the direction of the dawning radiance. Strike the teeth thirty-six times.

**First Vow:** May I be born of the qi of spontaneity, my body formed within qi, my form equal to the Three Luminaries, eternally enjoying the root of the boundless.

**Second Vow:** May my body always dwell above the Great Empyrean, within the jade palace’s chambers, feasting with the Jade Thearch at dawn, resting with the Mysterious Mother at dusk. When thirsty, may I sip from the Jade Mushroom’s wellspring and the Vast Spring’s jade nectar; when hungry, may I partake of the Dragon Embryo’s jade fat and the Scarlet Tree’s crimson fruit.

**Third Vow:** May my body generate ten thousand auspices and seventy-two radiant lights, with extraordinary hair and bones, donning feathered robes. Riding clouds and driving through the void, I shall enter and exit the Thearch’s palace, with myriad blessings converging and boundless virtues.

**Fourth Vow:** May I be unborn with the Unborn, undying with the Undying. Dying, yet living again, becoming a True Sovereign, governing the Ten Heavens and leading the host of immortals.

**Fifth Vow:** May all sentient beings, born and unborn, together preserve the Three Luminaries. May those of the Dao and the Seven Mysteries’ ancestors ascend to the Southern Palace, and may the world’s blessings be universally attained.

The Four Directions’ Five Vows converge in the Jade Hall.

**Next Vow:** May the Nine Mysteries nurture my body, my hun and po spirits and true gods eternally dwell within my palace, ascending to communicate with celestial immortals, descending to reach the abyssal depths.

**Vow to Heaven, Vow to Earth, Vow to Wind, Vow to Spirits, Vow to Immortals:** When the Five Vows unite as one, the register of longevity is secured. Purple mists descend from heaven, the Five Numinous Ones guard the earth. Riding clouds and driving through the void, ascending in a green chariot, I reach the Golden Gate and ascend to the Jade Clarity. Blessings extend to the seven ancestors, who are reborn in the womb. The Five Vows’ fivefold union ensures eternal prosperity and integrity.

**Middle Vows (also five):** Attain the root of the Dao.
**Vow to Yin, Vow to Yang, Vow to the Great Empyrean, Vow to the Great Void, Vow to the Great Mystery:** Feast in the Jade Chamber, forming karmic bonds with the Thearch. Gazing upon the living palace, unveil the Nine Heavens. The Primordial Father inscribes the register, the Mysterious Mother records the years. Peaches and pomegranates congeal essence, securing the cinnabar field. The body ascends to the Golden Gate, the name is inscribed in the Jade Volume. Seven ancestors are liberated, blessings and fortune converge.

**Lower Vows (also five):**
**Vow to the Great Void, Vow to the Great Existence, Vow to the Supreme, Vow to the Supreme Perfected, Vow to Divine Immortals:** May I traverse the Five Peaks’ summits, drifting between the Nine Empyreans, entering and exiting the Passes’ chambers, transcending the Gates of Death. May Heaven and Earth be my parents, the Three Luminaries guard me for ten thousand years. May spirits guard the Nine Origins’ apertures, numinous qi descend spontaneously. The Eight Directions’ Five Vows converge with resonance.

Upon completing the Five Vows, strike the teeth thirty-four times and recite the incantation:
*"Supreme Thearch of the Upper Origin,
Thearch-One’s Mysterious Scripture,
Five clouds scatter radiance,
Lushly filling the Three Clarities.
Jade lads and jade maidens,
Burning incense to serve the numinous.
The Upper Vows unfold,
Uniting with my form.
Grant me immortality,
Ascending to the Thearch’s court.
The Northern Thearch severs death,
The Southern Pass inscribes life.
The Eastern Florescence’s golden register
Records my name above.
Boundless vows
Align with me as one."*

Upon concluding the prayer, strike the teeth twenty-one times and, looking upward, swallow qi five times.

This is the Thearch-Lord’s method of unfolding the Upper Vows to unite with the numinous. Those who regularly practice thus will have jade blossoms as attendants, jade lads scattering incense, their devotion ascending to the Nine Heavens, eliciting responses from the Thearch-Emperors. After five years of this, the Dao will naturally descend.

For all under heaven in the ten directions who hold the Dao’s vows, the Dao will invariably descend to you. At the moment of vowing, ensure your heart and mind are undivided, free from stray thoughts or external distractions. If the true spirits scatter, the True will not descend. If one treads through filth and defilement, the True will also remain distant.

The Thearch-Lord’s Five Assemblies of Upper Vows conclude here. On each of these days, if you can sincerely vow and contemplate according to the method, the Thearch will dispatch jade lads to guard your body, summoning the Five Directions’ vows. The Dao of immortals will descend upon your form.

After five years of such practice, one may ascend to the Nine Heavens upon clouds, where one’s name is inscribed in the Register of Immortals. Even one’s seven generations of ancestors will receive blessings and joy, escaping the Three Wretched Paths to dwell in the Southern Palace of Immortals.

The Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen states: Those who study in the world know only to seek in the morning and expect results by evening, to utter a single vow and hope for the Dao’s descent, to recite spells and await response—yet they do not understand that ascending the heights of Mount Qi begins with the first step on the mountain’s base, that a thousand-foot tree grows from the tiniest sprout. The Dao is lofty and truly wondrous; how could one set foot and immediately climb the cloud ladder?

Even the Thearch-Lord, who governs the true qi by mandate, must still kindle a bright lamp to commune with the Dao. How much more should the Five Vows be cherished as blessings, for they naturally encompass all things. The path of seeking immortality must begin with vows, followed by the pursuit of those vows, so that resonance may summon the numinous. The greatness of the Five Vows lies in their boundless inclusivity—no blessing is left unbestowed, no joy left unshared, no goodness left unpurified. If one can focus the heart sincerely upon the vows, there will be no lack of response. Those of later generations who hold such sentiments should take heed and reflect deeply.

The Most Exalted Azure Lad of the Upper Prime states: In my past studies, I traversed seven hundred years, scaling perilous peaks, crossing from east to west, journeying through south and north, wandering the Central Plains. I studied under thirty-two masters and received over three hundred teachings, yet I had not ascended to the Golden Gates to receive from the Sage Lord the sacred scriptures of purple texts, the Dao of ingesting the yellow essence of sun and moon to restrain the hun and po, of binding the radiant brilliance of the Nine Perfected and Eight Ways, of dissolving form and concealing transformation, of traversing the purple passage of flaming light, of wielding the flowing gold and fire bells, of exhaling and inhaling flying auroras, of soaring through the void and treading the clouds, of pacing the Seven Primordial Treasures. The Sage Lord, by the shifting of the Seven Stars—a treasure of the Supreme Thearch—swore an oath and transmitted these teachings, enabling me to sever the six palaces of death and seal the northeastern ghostly gate. Only then did my name ascend to the Celestial Pass, where my body was shifted, allowing me to ascend the Three Primes and serve in office. Thus, I attained the rank of Most Exalted Minister, overseeing the host of immortals. The Seven Stars blazed and fell from the heavens, revolving the essence of the Nine Origins. Above, I rode the qi of the Three Primes; below, I governed the names of the Six Heavens. Birth and death, separation and union—none occur apart from the Seven Stars. For when the Dipper’s influence falls upon a person, they die; when it shifts away, they live. Thus, the Seven Stars are the ministers of heaven, the Celestial Pass the treasury of life’s renewal.

If one studies without severing the gate of death beneath the Northern Dipper or shifting the eye of life at the Southern Pass, how can life be preserved? The Supreme Emperor entrusted this scripture to the chambers of the Six Directions, commanding the Jade Maiden of the Western Flower and the Golden Lad of the Golden Dawn—three hundred in all—to guard the sacred text. Later, it was transmitted to the assembled perfected and emerged from the famous mountains. The Lord of the Western City later discovered this text within the stone chamber of Wangwu Mountain. After retiring to purify himself for three months, he presented his pledge and journeyed to the mountain to receive and peruse it. Through the practice of the Seven Stars’ shifting, he attained the rank of Perfected. Since then, no one without a jade name or immortal destiny has been able to encounter this Dao. For those who possess this scripture, the Six Palaces of Fengdu will record their names and shift them to the Southern Pass—how much more so for those who cultivate its practice?

The Lord of the Western City states: This original text comprised three scrolls—*The Celestial Pass* and *The Celestial Charts*—which do not circulate in the world. The Southern Marchmount Lady received only one scroll, *The Seven Stars’ Shifting*. Here ends *The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Three Charts of the Celestial Pass*.
