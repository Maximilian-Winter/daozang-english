**High Supreme Daoist Scripture of the Celestial Palace: The *Zishu* Scripture of the High Supreme Daoist Sovereign of the Jade Purity**

**Author Unknown**, composed approximately in the late Northern Song or early Southern Song dynasty.
A scripture of the **Shenxiao** Daoist sect. Twelve volumes.
Source of the base text: *Zhengtong Daozang* Canon, First Proper Division.

**Preface to the *Zishu* Scripture of the High Supreme Daoist Sovereign of the Celestial Palace**

In antiquity, before the **Great Void** (*Taikong*) was formed and the **original *qi*** (*yuánqì*) emerged,
the **Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** (*Yuánshǐ Tiānwáng*), as progenitor of the **vast and boundless Great Brahman** (*hàománg dàfán*), condensed his spirit and conceived a form, named it **Hundun** (混沌).
When **Hundun** was dispersed, the **original *qi*** of heaven and earth, within and without, was manifest—then called **Hunxu** (混虚).
The **Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign**, through his transformative power, unfolded the cosmic pattern.
His golden visage shone like the sun, his jade likeness radiated like the heavens.
He nurtured the **wondrous essence** (*miàojīng*), partitioning the **Heavenly and Earthly** (*qiánkūn*).
Thus, descending from the **Jade Capital** (*Yùjīng*) mountain and ascending through the celestial realms,
he encountered the **Primordial Mother of Ten Thousand *Qi*** (*Tà Xuán Yùjí Yuánjǐng Zìrán Jiǔtiān Shàng Xuán Yùqīng Shénmǔ*), the **Great Ancestral Mother of the Nine Heavens**,
and practiced the **Dao of the Great Cavern of the High Supreme Purity** (*Shàngqīng Dàdòng Cīxióng Sānyī Hùnhuà*), the **triune unity of yin and yang**,
and bore eight children.

The eldest was the **Long-Lived Sovereign of the Southern Extremity** (*Nánjí Chángshēng Dàdì*), also known as the **Great Sovereign of the Nine Dragons and the Fuxi Sun Palace** (*Jiǔlóng Fúsāng Rìgōng Dàdì*), also known as the **High Supreme Daoist Sovereign of the Jade Purity** (*Gāoshàng Shénxiāo Yùqīng Wáng*).
One body, three names—his holiness is singular.

The **High Supreme Daoist Sovereign of the Celestial Palace** (*Shénxiāo Zhēnwáng*), with his spirit condensed at the **Golden Gate** (*Jīnquè*),
reflected upon the world and all beings,
the **three calamities and eight hardships** (*sānzāi bānàn*) of all suffering,
the **nine abyssal prisons and the Green Anticipation** (*jiǔyōu quánchéng*), where all guilty souls endure retribution,
the endless torments that never cease day or night,
the **cyclic wheel of birth and death** (*shēngsǐ wǎnglái*).
Now, with my **divine powers** (*shéntōnglì*), I pity all beings in the **Three Realms** (*sānjiè*),
and thus proceed to the **Jade Purity Heaven** (*Yùqīng Tiān*), beneath the **Golden Gate of the Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** (*Yuánshǐ Shàngdì Jīnquè*).
With reverent offerings, I beseech the **Purple Microstar Celestial Palace** (*Zǐwēi Shànggōng*), the **Purple Jade and Precious Orchid** (*Zǐyù Qióngruǐ*) scriptures,
and within the **Nine Heavens Treasure Register** (*Jiǔxiāo Bǎogǔ*), I request the **Secret Dao of the High Supreme Sovereign** (*Shénxiāo Zhēnwáng Mìfǎ*), three volumes in total,
all composed of **Brahmanic *qi*** (*fánqì*), the **scriptures of the Nine Heavens’ Great Primordial Clouds and Mist** (*Jiǔtiān Tà Xuán Yúnxiá*).
The **uppermost** (*shàng*) conceals the **prohibitions of the Ten Thousand Heavens** (*wàn tiān zhǐjìn*);
the **middle** (*zhōng*) conceals the **Dao of immortality spanning Ten Thousand Years** (*shénxiān wànián fǎ*).

The **lower** (*xià*) reveals the **Dao of governing humanity and pacifying ghosts**—securing the state and bringing peace to the family.

The **Original Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** thus decreed to the **Supreme Lord of Ten Thousand Blessings, the True Prince** (*Tàihuáng Wànfú Zhēnjūn*), to transmit the **High Supreme Sovereign’s Secret Dao of the Jade Pure Palace for Long Life and Protection of Life** (*Gāoshàng Shénxiāo Yùqīng Wáng Chángshēng Hùmìng Fǎ*) to the mortal realm, first instructing me to propagate it among those in the world who seek the **Dao**, so that they may **wear the law and cultivate**, making it a lasting treasure for their bodies.

Above, it **defends emperors and kings**, stabilizing the land and ensuring a reign of **ten thousand years**.
Below, it **benefits the people**, extending life and delivering them from calamity, so that those who study the **Dao** may attain its truth.

With **face-bowed reverence to the True King**, one **drives away the Six Heavens** and **subdues demons and spirits**.
It is used to **issue talismans and edicts**, summoning and binding ghosts and gods.

As the **High Supreme Sovereign** has commanded, and as the **hundreds of millions of ancestors**—the **lineage of the sacred lineage and kindred spirits**—have ascended beyond suffering, one’s **single body is blessed**, and **ten thousand generations enjoy honor**.

Next, it enables the practitioner to **attain the Dao**, achieving **corporeal ascension and hidden transcendence**, ensuring its transmission through generations, with the **law safeguarded** so that the **Dao may flourish**.
Those who **leak, reveal, or grow lax**—facing the **Wind Knife Trial**—shall not be pardoned even after **ten thousand kalpas**.
Scholars who practice this must **strictly adhere** to it.

**The Great Dao Source of the Supreme Law**
**Volume One of the Purple Scripture Great Law of the High Supreme Sovereign of the Jade Pure Palace**

Within the **Great Luo Purple Treasury of the Nine Heavens**, there exist **all the celestial bureaus**.
The **assemblies of the Celestial Emperors**, the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Gate**—with **twelve thousand eight hundred** subordinate domains, each with its officials—**examine the virtues and transgressions of mortals**, recording none in official registers, yet all as **retribution or reward**.
Thus, **poverty and wealth, nobility and ignominy, longevity and early death** are not granted or withheld by decree, but arise entirely from **one’s own karmic summoning and response**.

These bureaus and gates **acknowledge the Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven as their sovereign**.
Yet the **High Supreme Sovereign of the Jade Pure Palace**, now commissioned by the Jade Emperor as the **Human Sovereign**, oversees the **Jade Pure Bureau of the High Supreme Sovereign**.
Moreover, he governs **all earthly mountain and ghostly spirits**, differing from the **edicts of the Great Emperor of the Northern Pole, the Purple Microstar**, and is not the **mixed primal virtue of the Supreme Emperor’s Three Heavens Exalted Teaching and Auxiliary Dao Master’s secret scriptures**.

Now, the **celestial officials of the High Supreme Sovereign’s Jade Pure Bureau** oversee the **seals of the earthly ghosts and spirits**, along with the **Spirit Officials and celestial attendants**, the **messengers and generals**, the **diverse-named Jade Officials**, and the **summoned spirit texts**.
This law must be practiced on the **third day of each lunar nine-day period**, when the **celestial officials of the High Supreme Sovereign’s Palace descend to the mortal assembly**. One must **abstain from meat, alcohol, and carnal desires**, observing strict fasting—**this must be observed with utmost care**.

**On the Scriptures**
The **Seven Stages of the High Supreme Sovereign’s Dao Scriptures** are now transmitted to the mortal world.

Since ancient times, it has never descended to manifest itself. Now those who obtain it shall **exalt their bodies and preserve their lives**, **cross calamities and extend their years**. Those who revere it shall receive blessings from the **celestial officials**, **dispel calamities and avert misfortune**. Those who practice it shall **repel and extinguish malevolent spirits**, **severely punish demons**. The **worthy and virtuous** must first **pledge allegiance to the Dao of the Spirit Palace**, **petition the High Supreme Sovereign**, and await the **divine response** before they may **revere and practice it**. They must not **transgress or recklessly employ** it. It is most fitting to **strictly adhere to its precepts**.

**On the Secret Keys**
The **Spirit Palace’s Dao Scriptures**, the **Jade Pure Bureau’s Secret Keys**, encompass **all matters without exception**, **all beings without fail**. If one **preserves oneself and upholds them faithfully**, then **sitting in stillness, all wonders manifest**; **standing, all spirits obey**. In **tranquility and motionless repose**, one **feels and attains communion**—this is unlike all other **Dao laws**, and no **seal scriptures** compare to it. If the **worthy and virtuous** encounter this **transmission across the eons**, with **fate and fortune** aligned, **boundless and eternal**, how can they not **strive with utmost sincerity** to **invoke the True One’s blessings**? If they **begin with diligence but falter at the end**, **speaking falsely while harboring deceit**, the **Spirit Officials and celestial attendants** within the **Dao laws** shall **record their merits and demerits without fail**. At that time, the **Three Officials** shall **severely judge** them with their **divine tablets**. They must not **reveal these to the unworthy**—is this not something to be **held in utmost reverence**? **Exhortation and warning** are given.

**On the Wondrous Intent**
The **Spirit Palace’s Secret Scriptures**, the **Jade Officials’ Wondrous Intent**, are **profound mysteries**, difficult to fathom. Though there are **secret scriptures** to be studied and practiced according to their **prescribed methods**, there are no **essential keys or core principles**—like garments **cut but never sewn**, how could they be worn? The **key** is the **sewing**. Now, the **eternal secret scriptures** are revealed to the **learned and true**. If one **persists with unwavering resolve**, **aligns their heart with the Dao**, **uses the scriptures to sever malevolence**, and **returns to the True Path**, the **celestial soldiers** shall **assist and follow**. Day by day, month by month, one may **ascend to the Spirit Palace’s realm**. When **merits are fulfilled and name is established**, they shall **rise to the House of Boundless Eons**. Now these are **laid out to the left**—how can one not **ponder deeply and follow them with conviction**?

**On the Dao Law**
The **Spirit Palace’s Dao Law** was **hidden within the Jade Hall**, never revealed to the mortal world. Now, in the **auspicious cycle of the Jia-Xin years**, when the **Dao Sovereign** assumes **human leadership**, the **mysteries of the Dao** are **unveiled in this era**, and the **spirit scriptures** are **bestowed upon the treasure seals**, regardless of rank, for **reverence and practice**. Though **investigated and expounded**, they **differ from all other Dao laws**, and no **seal scriptures** are alike. But if one **sincerely invokes** with **unfailing devotion**, **peacefully practices** while **awaiting divine response**, the **merits and rewards** shall be **equal to the deeds**. They must not **arbitrarily invoke guilt from ghosts and spirits**. If they **follow the precepts and treat accordingly**, they may **rely on their merits and virtues** to **redeem themselves**, so that **both the living and the dead** may **all benefit from their virtue**. How could this be called **a minor supplement**?

**Oath and Ritual Procedure**
For those who practice this **Dao law**, on the **third day of each lunar nine-day period**, when the **celestial officials of the Spirit Palace** descend to the world, they must **use three lamps**, **twelve sheets of yellow paper**, and **compose a petition** to be **sealed with the Jade Seal** and **enclosed**. The words shall be **offered to the High Supreme Sovereign**. After burning the words, they must **prepare incense, tea, alcohol, and fruits**, **offering them with utmost sincerity**, then **extinguish the lamps and collect the ashes**. If they **receive a divine response**, then they may **practice the law**. The **Heavenly Sovereign of the Primordial Beginning** declares: *"I save the Supreme Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Blessings, opening the **Nine Pure Eons of the Purple Sky** and the **Ninefold Mysteries of the Spirit Palace**. I entrust them to the **Heavenly Sovereign’s eldest son**, so that he may **unveil the heavenly winds**, **transmit and guide the world’s people**, and **point them toward the True Dao**. Those who obtain it shall **ascend to the Celestial Realm** themselves. The **Ninefold Radiance of the Primordial Qi** has **eighty-one repetitions**, which is the **cycle of the Great Sun**. The **Sovereign of the Great Sun’s Ninefold Radiance and the Mulberry Tree of the East** accumulates **qi into the Spirit Palace’s True Sovereign**. He also **leads the duties of the Southern Pole**, together with **Han the Official of the Furnace**, in **molding the Heavenly People**, all **attaining the Nine Heavens**. Thus, they obtain the **Spirit Palace’s Forbidden Seal Scriptures** and the **Heavenly Seal of the Spirit Palace**, and on the appointed day, they **ascend to the Spirit Palace**."*

The **"Scripture of the Jade Hall"** comprehensively records **treasures that lead to ascension**, containing **ten grades of methods**. If one encounters this **scripture**, they shall **register their name in the Eastern Jade Hall**, and on the appointed day, they shall **ascend to the True Realm**. This **scripture** is **guarded by ten thousand Golden Spirit Children** and **one thousand Heavenly Pure Consorts**, who **constantly protect it**. When **incense is burned and scriptures are scattered**, they **record merits and demerits**. If there is **any slight transgression**, even the **Seven Ancestors** shall **suffer the divine punishment of the Spirit Prison**. The **transmitters** shall **deliver it with a Golden Dragon and Jade Fish’s Forbidden Brocade Seal**, **pledging allegiance to the Ten Heavens**. If one **breaks the fast or recklessly reveals** it, both **master and disciple** shall **share the same guilt**, and the **Seven Ancestors** shall **enter the Northern Capital**, where **ten thousand laws** shall **not pardon them**. This is the **pledge and warning** for the **worthy**.

**The Heavenly People’s Fasting with Rice Gruel**
The **hundred grains and five flavors** enter the **spleen and stomach**. The **five viscera** are **calmed and at peace**, and the **corporeal demons** are **dispelled and annihilated**. The **Seven Ancestors** ascend to **Heaven**, and the **minor worthy** attain **ascension**. **Long life** is **achieved within the Nine Pure Eons**, and **enduring vision** is **communed with the Holy Wisdom**. **Swiftly, swiftly**—as the **High Supreme Spirit Palace’s Eastern Jade Ascension Sovereign** decrees: *"This law is taken from the **Eastern Jade Qi**. Again, the **qi is blown**, harmonizing the **hundred bones and nine orifices**, and **dispelling the Three Corpses and Nine Worms**."*

**The Heavenly People’s Hair-Combing Method**
The **mud pellet at the Jade Vertex** and the **precious essence of the Vermilion Chamber and Mysterious Palace**—the **Heavenly Sovereign’s divine countenance** is **eternally preserved**, and the **divine light of the Sage Forest** is **manifested**. The **right** is the **Hidden Moon**, and the **left** is the **Hidden Sun**. The **six directions are purified**, and the **hundred spirits are transformed**. **Swiftly, swiftly**—as the **High Supreme Spirit Palace’s Great Sovereign** decrees: *"This law is to be practiced **facing the direction of the Heavenly Qi**. One must **blow the qi** and then **combine the hair**. The **white strands become qi**, bringing **great auspiciousness and prosperity**."*

**The Heavenly People’s Washing and Adorning with Headgear**
The **Heavenly Pure Jade Crown** and the **Cloud Robes with Glow of the Morning Mist**—the **Tiger Skirt subdues demons**, and the **Golden Elixir is refined**. The **five turbidities** are **rapidly dispelled**, and the **eight scenes** are **radiant**. The **ministers receive their blessings**, and their **guilt is erased while their fortune is enhanced**. They **ascend with the Spirit Palace**, **equally attaining the True and Holy**. **Swiftly, swiftly**—as the **Five Sovereigns of the High Supreme Spirit Palace** decree: *"This law is to be practiced **from the month of the Heavenly Pure Maiden downward**, with **Jade Boys standing in attendance**. One must **blow the Heavenly Qi** into the **water** before **washing and adorning**."*

**The Heavenly People’s Mouth and Hand Washing**
The **Heavenly Pure and Earthly Bright**, the **Sun and Moon radiant in the morning**—they **purify my five senses**, and the **light shines upon the Jade Pure**.

The **Qi** does not receive defilement; the **five viscera** flourish in splendor.
Guilt vanishes from the **Northern Capital**, calamity is extinguished in the **Nine True Regions**.
Evil and malevolence are subdued and hidden; fortune connects with the **Upper Pure**.
Today’s **refined bathing**—all receive blessings.

**Eighth Son**, sealed as the **Northern Terrace Great Lord**, holding the title **Nine-Heaven Capital Guard Jade Constellation Purple Purity Central Emperor**, named **Chen Dong**, with the style **Yao Yuan**.

**The Eight Emperors’ Sealed Titles and Official Ranks**
**First Son**, holding the title **Jade Constellation Jade Purity Heavenly King of Crimson Dawn, Pacifying Transformation Dao-Master Emperor**, distantly overseeing the **Nine-Qi Sovereign of the Eastern Pole Sun**.

**Second Son**, holding the title **Green Constellation Auspicious Sound Primordial Treasure Illuminating Emperor**, distantly overseeing the **Eastern Flower Great Emperor**.

**Third Son**, holding the title **Azure Constellation Opening-Void Transmitting Degree Heavenly King**, distantly overseeing the **Master of Penglai Spirits**.

**Fourth Son**, holding the title **Scenic Constellation Most-Mysterious Transformation-Empty Heavenly King**, distantly overseeing the **Western Primordial Azure-Gold Elixir Emperor**.

**Eighth Son**, holding the title **Supreme Constellation Flowing Light Transformation-Scene Heavenly King**, distantly overseeing the **Nine-Heaven Central Emperor**.

The Jade Emperor has eight sons.

**Of Old, the Great Primordial Transformation**
The Primordial One, with the **Vajra-Qi Ancestral Mother**, performed the **Great Cavern Yin-Yang Union**, blending winds and merging, condensing **eighty-one measures of pure yang qi**, and birthing the **First Son, the Celestial Constellation King**. Next, condensing **seventy-two measures of pure yang qi**, the **Second Son, the Jade Flower Lord**, was born. Next, condensing **sixty-three measures of true yang qi**, the **Third Son** emerged. Next, condensing **fifty-four measures of Vajra-yang qi**, the **Fourth Son** was born. Next, condensing **forty-five measures of flourishing yang qi**, the **Fifth Son** appeared. Next, condensing **thirty-six measures of luminous yang qi**, the **Sixth Son** was born. Next, condensing **twenty-seven measures of rosy yang qi**, the **Seventh Son** emerged. Finally, condensing **eighteen measures of treasure yang qi**, the **Eighth Son** was born.

All were born from the **Great Cavern Union**, the **Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother**, through **nine transformations of yin-yang**, merging into **one**. **Nine yangs as one qi**. Congealing mist into spirit, blending wind into ether, forming **one imperial infant**, giving rise to the **Nine Emperors**.

The **seven nines of the Dao**, ten thousand transformations.

All the **Highest Celestial Jade Emperors** are but different titles of the **Eight Kings**. Thus, the **Nine Yang Heavenly Truths** all emanate from the **Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern**.

The **Union of Blended Winds** is the **Dao of the One Emperor**. How could one, knowing this Dao, ascend to heaven in broad daylight, while those who lose it forever sink into the abyss?

Reflect upon this: the **Jade Saints and Ten Thousand Emperors** attain **True Reality** only by never departing the **Great Cavern**. How much more so for mere insects and corpses, ignorant of the **True One**, yet claiming to become **perfected sovereigns of marvelous Dao**?

**The Nine Masters of Celestial Constellation**
In antiquity, when the **Celestial Constellation descended**, the **Three Masters** convened in the **Azure Constellation Heaven**. Now, each of the **Three Masters** possesses the **Celestial Constellation Law**, and together they constitute the **Total Thunder of Celestial Constellation**, within which resides the **Thunder Ancestor Emperor**.

**Disasters** are under the authority of the **Highest Heavenly Jade Sovereign Emperor**.
**The Patriarchal Master**, the **Highest Celestial Constellation Jade Purity True King of Long Life and Life-Preservation**, oversees **clear weather and rain**.
**The Ancestral Master**, the **Jade Flower Great Emperor of Defined Blessing**, oversees **plague suppression, exorcism, and summoning ten thousand spirits**.
**The True Master**, the **Nine-Heaven Beneficent Calculation Command-of-Life Auspicious-Generating Khan Lord-in-Law True Sovereign of Life-Preservation**, governs **soul transmission and ether capture**.

**The Six Outer Masters** each hold their own orthodox laws, governing as follows:
**The Spirit Master**, the **Responding Primordial Recorded True Sovereign of Command**, wields the **Thunder Decree Tablet**, commanding **thunderous harmonies**.
**The Mysterious Master**, the **Life-Preserving Transformation-Generating True Sovereign of Life-Preservation**, oversees **the Five Peaks, rivers, lakes, Huai Sea, and cavern dragons**.
**The Saintly Master**, the **Commanding and Supervising True Sovereign of Ten-Thousand Security**, governs **soul capture, transmigration, exorcism of malevolent spirits, and suppression of demons**.
**The Treasure Master**, the **Primordial Life-Preserving True Sovereign of Auspicious Reserve**, administers **celestial laws of the Nine Exaltations**, overseeing **thirty-six kinds of untimely deaths**.
**The Heavenly Master**, the **Law-Master Recorded True Sovereign of Agriculture**, wields the **Thirty-Six Celestial Constellation Vajra-Qi True Talismans**, specializing in **Dao cultivation and official ascension**.

There is also the **Thunder Enclosure Divine Master**, the **Decree-Descending True Sovereign of Auspicious Gathering**, who governs **demons of the world, mountain-valley five calamities, and the five unrighteous gods**.

When the **Saintly Master** encounters **fasting and exorcism rites**, he should be invoked as the **Life-Preserving Transformation-Salvation Sovereign**.

Each of the **Nine Masters** has their own **inner principles**. If an official seeks the **Celestial Constellation lineage**, he must first prioritize **five-viscera essence-qi-spirit talismans**. Once inner essence is exhausted, how can one restore the original **divine qi** without relying on the **Primordial Vajra-Qi** to supplement what is lacking?

One must first **nurture internally**—only then will the **Celestial Constellation Dao** manifest as **ten thousand spirits**. Our **Celestial Constellation** is the **great essence of the exalted heavens**; it does not wander as the **Primordial Spirit**.

The **Highest Celestial Kings descend true talismans**.

**The Primordial Sovereign Invokes the Spirit-Symbols, Commanding the Talismans and Incantations of the Primordial Principle to Flow and Govern the Ten Directions.**

To summon the True Spirit and invoke the Spirit-Symbols, the **威神 (mighty virtue/power)** is unyielding. When the talismans reach the **八极 (Eight Extremes)**, longevity and fortune flourish. To preserve life and transcend calamity, **ten thousand miles** are filled with peace. **Swiftly, swiftly** as the command of the **Highest Celestial Sovereign of the Celestial Constellation Dao, the True and Pure Sovereign of Jade Clarity.**

**Right Method:** Jade Clarity Incantation, reciting the spell, drawing **southeast qi**, and blowing it into the talisman. Burn it with **fiery flames and fragrant incense**.

Recite again:
*"Penetrating Spirit, Transcending Mystery, Purifying Heart, Piercing Clarity.*
*Summoning the Golden Boy of Truth, Invoking the Jade Maiden of Spirit.*
*For the servant to ascend, True Qi descends and manifests.*
*Displaying and exaltedly aiding, My Dao unites with Spirit."*

**Right Method:** In the **first month**, invoke the **Upper True** (Highest Celestial Sovereign). In the **seventh month**, invoke the **Middle True** (Celestial Constellation Sovereign). In the **tenth month**, invoke the **Lower True** (Spirit-Salvation Sovereign). On the **Eight Festivals**, invoke the **Upper Spirit** (Celestial Constellation Spirit). On one’s **natal day**, the **Middle Spirit** descends. In the **tenth month**, the **Lower Spirit** descends, and the **存局 (Preservation Array)** is maintained. If one’s study lacks steadfast faith, the **Five Sacred Mountains** will test him.

**Incantation of the True Constellation Jade-Symbol:**
*"True Constellation, True Salvation—Nine Heavens’ vast decree.*
*Granted to me in reception, I behold Your radiance.*
*Refining form in the Southern Metropolis, acquiring substance in the Grand Micro.*
*The Green Dragon rules *甲乙 (Jia-Yi)*, the White Tiger rules *庚辛 (Geng-Xin).*
*The Vermilion Bird rules *丙丁 (Bing-Ding)*, the Dark Tortoise rules *壬癸 (Ren-Gui).*
*The Officials and Soldiers guide and draw, True Names guard and shield.*

*Above are listed the Celestial Constellation Deities—returning to the Sacred Throne.*

**Swiftly, swiftly** as the command of the **Highest Sovereign of Preservation and Salvation.**

**Incantation of the True Constellation Jade-Symbol (Right Talisman):**
A yellow silk talisman inscribed with green script, worn to signify the descent of the **Celestial Constellation Sovereign**.

Daily, according to the method, invoke the True Spirit, visualizing **southeast green qi** forming the talisman. This talisman is also called the **無邊符 (Boundless Symbol)**.

For those suffering from **凶惡邪祟 (malevolent, evil, and maleficent spirits)** that are extremely difficult to cure, one must **恰神府目 (align with the Celestial Constellation’s divine vision)**, recite the **總咒 (Master Incantation)**, and draw **巽炁 (Xun-Qi, the gentle and penetrating qi)**. Then, take this talisman to the afflicted person’s home and place it before the **司命 (Spirit of Longevity)**. When night is still, offer **one portion of food and drink**, and **a bundle of gold coins**, burning them—immediate response will follow.

**Days of Divine Descent:**
On **August 9th**, the day of **青華 (Azure Radiance)** descending into the world.
On **October 10th**, the day of the **True Sovereign** descending into the world.
On the **three 九日 (Ninth Days)** and **three 元八節 (Eighth Festival Days)** of each month, one may recite the **都咒 (Comprehensive Incantation)** a thousand times, swallow **twenty-one talismans**, and pray—immediate response will follow.
On each **Day of Descent**, light **three lamps**, prepare **twelve sheets of yellow paper**, and offer **one petition**. Use **fresh five-vegetable offerings** for devotion, and extinguish the lamps before collecting them. **Avoid meat, alcohol, and polluted objects.**

**Morning Ritual Procedures**
Each time one practices, upon encountering the Ninth Days or Days of Descent, burn incense and, facing the northwest, bow nine times to the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness, the Ten Extremes of High Perfection, the Celestial Sovereign of the Vault of Heaven, and the Daoist Patriarch Emperor, Lord of the Teaching.

Next, facing due south, bow nine times to the Ancestral Master, the Emperor of the Southern Extremity of Eternal Life, the Celestial Lord Who Preserves Life, and the True Master, the Beneficent Lord of the Nine Heavens, Master Han the Elder.

Next, facing due east, bow nine times to the Patriarchal Master, the Emperor of the Northern Extremity of Verdant Clarity, the Celestial Lord Who Saves Suffering from the Great Void.

Next, facing southeast, bow nine times to the Highest Celestial True Sovereign and all the True Saints and Immortal Officials within the Divine Treasury.

Offer three incense sticks, kneel facing east, and recite:
*"I am of the rank [state one’s Daoist position], surname [state surname]. With deepest reverence, I prostrate and kneel, bowing twice. I humbly report to the True Saints of the Highest Celestial Palace:*
*Today, I sincerely follow the practice of the Celestial Constellation’s Great Method, devoting my heart to pray that all my countless ancestral spirits may swiftly ascend to the celestial realms. May my own body be secure, my blessings and longevity extended. May I attain Dao and become an immortal, paying homage to the Celestial Constellation and soaring through the Golden Gates.*
*Thus spoken. Nine bows in retreat.*

If aged, infirm, or weak and unable to bow physically, a mental bow suffices."

**Adopting the Black Practice of the Celestial Constellation**
Each morning at sunrise, face southeast while studying. Mentally bow thirty-six times, strike the teeth thirty-six times, and gather true *qi* to form the Celestial Constellation Emperor. Visualize the thirty-six heavens’ golden light and jade platform’s verdant *qi*. Within its radiance, behold the Celestial Constellation True Sovereign, with the sun to the left and moon to the right. As the True Sovereign exhales verdant *qi*, inhale eighty-eight times (sixty-four breaths), distributing them to the Upper Dan Field, forming a solar wheel. Then inhale thirty-six breaths into the Middle Dan Field, forming a green pearl as if an emperor dwells within water.

When complete, bow seven times and recite the incantation:
*"Emperor of Verdant Clarity, True Sovereign of the Celestial Constellation, the Sun Emperor of the Eastern Red Pine, the Moon Sovereign of the Western Extremity—Four Truths, Three *Qi*—bind the verdant luminous light. Settle the Three Fields, internally harboring the True Emperor. Swallow the sun’s essence, ascending golden light. Internally circulate sun and moon, the alchemical hall’s jade chamber. Exhale to form a jade body, inhale the lustrous radiance. Demons and ghosts depart, the Three Corpses perish. Three nines make seven; face the Immortal King. Swiftly, as the decree of the Highest Celestial Constellation True Sovereign."*

This method, practiced for a hundred days, grants the way of *shixie* (corpse dissolution). This *qi* can subdue a thousand ghosts and a hundred demons, dispelling plagues and epidemics.

**The Diagram of the Celestial Constellation’s Distribution of the Solar Yang**
**The Diagram of the Five-Eon Enlightenment: The Primordial Brightness Jade Calendar**
**The True Form Diagram of the Highest Celestial Constellation Sovereign**
All practitioners shall write this talisman on yellow paper with cinnabar. Visualize the red-black true form binding the *cauldron field* (lower dan field). Facing southeast, within the thunderous purple light, behold the true red form, with immortal officials and attendants in attendance. Imagine the Celestial Constellation within the five-colored *qi* clouds, descending and flowing into the diagram. Wear this diagram atop the hair.

Further, visualize the true *qi* as a radiant red glow, illuminating all. The brilliance is boundless, healing all ailments. As the true *qi* descends, malevolent spirits submit. When traveling far or entering mountains, tigers and wolves retreat. Avoid blades, weapons, and plagues. Worn for three years, the Spirit Officials will descend to one’s chamber, banishing ten thousand demons and a thousand fiends.

**The Diagram of the Celestial Constellation’s Palace and Gates by Domain**
Each morning, enter the chamber and visualize the true diagram, transforming one’s body into that of a white crane immortal. Take thirty-six steps to enter the Celestial Constellation Palace and pay homage to the True Sovereign. Thus, in nine years, one’s merit shall be complete, attaining the rank of immortal.

Visualize a golden light encasing the body; each step opens a gate, becoming an official of the golden city. If the divine light is unseen, practice the *Golden City Transformation Technique*: pinch the middle joint of the middle finger against the center of the thumb, extending the other four fingers. Step forward, kneel, and sit while reciting the incantation:
*"The Northern Sovereign’s vault is vast; my body ascends to the Yang. Step through the Arcadians, transforming into the Heavenly Marshal. Malicious tongues, blades, fire, and water—all calamities depart from my side. My spirit soars to the Golden Gates, facing the True Sovereign. Above, I confront the Celestial Constellation; golden light shines in all ten directions. Swiftly, as the decree of the Celestial Constellation Sovereign."*

**The Method:**
When practicing, draw a talisman on the ground to form an altar. Malevolent ghosts and demonic spirits cannot intrude, making it a blessed site. This is the realm of the thirty-six heavens; diligently cultivate merit to ascend to the Celestial Constellation’s sky. The talisman may be carried during fasting or placed in a quiet chamber. Spread upon the ground, it transforms into a golden palace with jade gates, divided into thirty-six portals, naturally generating golden hues and jade light that spirals about. It dispels evil; even if placed on the earth, ten thousand spirits dare not approach.

**The Thirty-Six Heavens of Highest Purity and True Life-Preservation**
The Highest Celestial Constellation comprises thirty-six heavens, each with thirty-six layers below, governed by the Thirty-Six Fortifications. Each possesses nine solar *qi* to correspond with the thirty-six *qi* of the year. Every ten days, one *qi* ascends, aligning with one heaven ruled by an emperor who governs that *qi*. The deeds of heavenly immortals, spirits, and ghosts are recorded by their respective heavens. The virtuous are inscribed in their heavenly registers; the wicked are imprisoned in their heavenly jails. The lowest are consigned to the Thirty-Six Fortifications, where the Sovereign reports to the Divine Treasury for investigation.

If one seeks to subdue ghosts and spirits, use the heavenly talisman to summon and notify the Sovereign and the heavenly and earthly deities, who shall promptly appear. Present them with the *Wheel of Heaven Diagram*; do not reveal it recklessly. Should ghosts or spirits bring calamity, or dragons and monsters cause disaster, or fire and water bring affliction, pinch the *heavenly eyes* (third eye), place the talisman below, and call in the direction:
*"Heavenly Emperor, swiftly arrive! Dispatch them at once."*

To summon, first fast for ninety days, liberating the souls of the deceased, and inform them below—they shall then ascend. This shall be inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper and distributed with the appropriate *qi*.

「能治万病，解和邪气瘟疫，百神咸听。

**Method for the Thirty-Six Talismans:**
The thirty-six talismans are inscribed in *seal script* (篆) with *jade* (碧玉), encased in a *golden box* (黄金为函). They reside within the *Divine Treasury Palace* (神霄宫府), in the *crimson chambers* (朱房) and *jade rooms* (玉室), beneath the *Precious Forest Pavilion* (琼林紫石芝英宝阁), guarded by eight hundred *Highest Purity Jade Maidens* (太和玉女). These are the *primordial mystic texts* (太初玄古之文) of the *Supreme Sovereign* (皇天).

They emerge from *ten thousand kalpas* (万劫), revealing natural wondrous principles (妙理). The *Emperor’s Purple Script* (紫字) is the *Divine Treasury’s* decree (契贤之旨).

The *Supreme Sovereign of the Eastern Celestial Palace* (东华上相青童仙君) seals the *Dao/Way* within these thirty-six heavens and the *Nine Celestial Mansions* (九霄宫), circulating eternally through ten thousand kalpas without decay, and remaining fresh through countless ages (亿载). Those who encounter them bear the *ancient mystic name* (宿挺玄名).

They can avert the *threefold demonic calamities* (三对之魔) and avoid the *fivefold sufferings* (五苦之劫). They transcend the souls of the *Northern Peak* (北岳), issuing commands to the myriad deities (万神). They ascend to release the *seven ancestral souls* (七祖之魂) and descend to disperse the *Nine Yin grudges* (九阴之仇).

Without this talisman, one may only labor in vain over refining the *essence* (精), yet how could they attain self-liberation in the *Southern Celestial Abode* (南轩)? Those who attain this shall possess *refined spirit* (爽灵), and the *One Dao* (雌一) shall manifest its response.

With the *Thirty-Six Talismans*, one may naturally become an immortal (自仙矣), and all calamities and punishments (祸考) shall be extinguished.

They may be *received* (受), *worn* (佩), *swallowed* (吞), or *ingested* (服). The names of a hundred immortals (百仙书名) are inscribed, and the *Yin Capital* (阴都) shall erase its records (削字).

In a *pure chamber* (净室), facing east, perform nine prostrations (九拜), clap teeth thirty-six times (叩齿三十六通), swallow saliva seven times (咽液七遍), and recite the incantation:

*"Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury,
Greatly Holy and Pure Jade Maidens.
Spirit talismans liberate souls,
Preserve form and guard spirits.
Three refineries, nine transformations,
The six directions naturally respond.
Forever depart from the Northern *Yin Tribunal* (北酆),
Release all sufferings (万苦).
My body attains liberation,
Ascending to the Jade Treasury of immortals.
Inscribed on azure tablets,
Listed among the Highest Sovereigns.
With jade seals and cinnabar texts,
I ascend to Dao/Way and immortality.
The three luminaries align,
The nine emperors share the same hall.
Ascending in the purple chariot,
I am ranked among the Han Celestial.
Blessings flow to the seven ancestors,
All attain the highest immortality.
Swiftly, as the decree of the Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury King (神霄王)."*

Upon completing the incantation, inscribe it in cinnabar on yellow paper (朱书黄上), swallow the saliva twenty-four times (咽津二十四过), visualize the *five-colored clouds and mists* (五色云霞) ascending from your body, and let *flames of fire* (火光) envelop you. Swallow it with pure water (以净水吞之).

Practice this for three years, and the *Emperor-Immortal* (帝仙) shall descend. When nine years have passed and the merit is complete, you shall ascend to the *Divine Treasury Court* (神霄).

Then pinch the *Supreme Sovereign’s Dao/Way secret* (掐上帝诀), extract the *stellar qi* (辰气), inscribe and recite the *Universal Incantation* (都咒). Facing the *eastern-southern direction* (东南) with utmost sincerity (至诚祷祝), pray to the *associated celestial emperors and immortal assemblies* (所属天帝仙众), beseeching them to descend their *true qi* (真气) into your body.

This shall cure all illnesses (治万病). If confronted by malevolent spirits (凶邪), you may also inscribe and affix the talisman. It shall avert the calamities of *water and fire* (水火之灾).

The *Divine Treasury Palace* (神霄) of the *Highest and Supreme Jade-Purity King* (玉清王府) spans its domain (分域之境), known as the *Divine Treasury Heaven* (神霄天). Within it are the thirty-six heavens (三十六天), each presided over by a *Dragon Deity* (龙神), who summon thunder and bring forth benevolence to subdue violence (兴雷生善伐暴). None escape their jurisdiction (罔不由之).

The efficacy of these thirty-six talismans is profound and secret, forged by *accumulated jade and refined gold* (流金积玉成文). Their texts can penetrate the *underworld tribunal* (闻冥曹) and reach the *Three Heavens* (三天).

Swallow one talisman daily, and within a hundred days, your face shall radiate with *jade light* (玉光), your countenance with *golden mists* (金霞). After nine years of practice, the *cloud-borne palanquin* (云軿) shall descend upon you. One talisman corresponds to one *Heavenly Sovereign* (天主); three years suffice to ascend into the *Jade Treasury* (玉府).

**Method for the *Sun-Soul Talisman* (日魂符) and *Sun-Soul Incantation* (日魂咒):**
At noon, when the *Sun Deity* (日君) is summoned (司命天君), the nine emperors align (九帝齐景), and the three luminaries share the same palanquin (三光同軿). They ascend with me, soaring to the Three Heavens (高奔三天).
Swiftly, as the decree of the Divine Treasury Jade-Purity King (神霄玉清王律令).»

This talisman is inscribed by extracting *stellar qi* (辰气) with the *left hand’s two upper fingers* (左手二指上节), facing east-south at sunrise (日出), and visualizing *golden light at noon* (想日中金光), channeling it into the talisman.

Men who ingest it shall, within a hundred days, radiate *purple mists and crimson light* (紫霞红光); women who ingest it shall manifest *golden and jade forms* (金玉成形), bearing noble children (生贵子).

**Method for the *Moon-Soul Talisman* (月魄符) and *Moon-Soul Incantation* (月魄咒):**
At the moment of the moon’s fullness (月中方盈), when the *Moon Emperor* (月帝元君) is invoked, the eight *divine manifestations* (八景) are arrayed, and *precious light* (宝光) sustains the form. The body generates *jade essence* (玉液), purifying internally and externally (内灌外清).
Swiftly, as the decree of the Highest and Supreme Divine Treasury Jade-Purity King (神霄玉清王律令).»

This talisman is inscribed by extracting *qi* (气) with the *left hand’s five fingers pinching the Yin-stellum* (左手五指掐酉文), facing west-north at moonrise (月出), and visualizing *jade light within the moon* (想月中玉光), channeling it into the talisman.

Gather *thousand truths* (千真) to refine it, and let your body radiate with *jade light* (身有玉光).

**Additional Method:**
At sunrise or moonrise, close your eyes (闭目), clap teeth eighty-one times (叩齿八十一通). Facing east or west, inscribe in yellow and white paper (以黄白书), and cast into water (投水中). Draw *stellar qi* through your nostrils thirty-six times (鼻引气三十六口), retain the *qi*, swallow the talisman, and rinse with pure water (以净水盥漱), washing your ears and eyes. Thus, your face shall radiate with *gold and jade light* (兆面有金玉光), reversing aging and restoring youth (反老回童). This shall cure chronic illnesses (治夙病).

If women drink it, they shall bear noble children (生贵子). The *Divine Water* (神水) flows harmoniously, and the hundred *meridians* (脉) shall be tranquil (百脉安然). This practice ensures the *high ascent of the sun and moon* (日月高奔).

On the days of *Jiazi* (甲子) and *Gengshen* (庚申), inscribe it upon yellow silk (书之於黄罗上).

**Method of Transformation, Mixing, and Divine Spirits’ Wondrous Generalship**:

*"For those who wish to **ascend to the Primordial** and enter **tranquility**,
walk the **Flying Void Pole** [10],
face north,
with a **pure cloth** held in one hand,
and offerings of **rice wine and food** in one portion,
strike the teeth **nine times**.
The **Five Zang** and **Hundred Passages** [11],
emit **White Qi**—**dense and lingering**.

The **Golden Palace**,
sees **ten thousand troops**—transformed into a **precious pearl**,
its light like the **sun and moon**.
You then swallow it with your mouth,
entering the **Lower Dantian**,
transforming into a **small child**,
as though newly born, seeing the **Three Corpses Five Desires’ spirits**,
emerging from the **Jade Phallus**.
Inhale the **qi** with one breath,
and absorb it into the **heart** [15].
After some time, a **great light** appears in the heart,
exiting through the mouth—
transforming into the **Hidden Dao General**, **ten thousand**,
who draw bows and wield swords,
beheading the **Three Corpses** and their heads falling—
transforming into the **True Name Boy Officers**.
Close your eyes—the **crown** emits **White Qi**,
along with the **Generals and soldiers**.
Again, your **form** transforms into your own likeness,
riding upon **White Clouds**.
With your mouth, call upon the **left and right officers and soldiers**,
ascending to the **Jade Palace**,
and bowing in homage to the **Jade Emperor** [16].
The **various Generals** then transform into **Golden Light**,
swallowed in an instant—
only then does this method take effect.
If you wish to **summon spirits and laborers**,
first inscribe the **Summoning Truth and Inviting Spirits Talisman**,
as well as the **Calling upon the Functional Officials and Commanding Officers**,
and the **assembled soldiers and laborers**—this is most wondrous.

and chant thus:

and cross the hands over the heart.
Close the eyes,
seal the *qi* for **three breaths**,
knock the teeth **three times**.
Preserve in the heart a **red *qi****, like a **chicken egg** emerging from within and exiting the mouth.

Call upon the **Three Spirits**.

If you wish to **ascend and soar**,

**The Method of Restraining the Seven Souls**
On the **first, fifteenth, and thirtieth** of each month,
or the **twenty-first and nineteenth** in short months,
the **Seven Souls** wander and conspire with ghosts.
**To bind the Spirits and return the Souls:**

On this day, recline on your back, extend your feet,
cover both ears with your palms, pressing fingers to the crown.
Close your eyes,
seal the *qi* for **seven breaths**,
knock the teeth **seven times**.
Focus in the heart—
a **white *qi*,** the size of a **mung bean**, grows,
gradually expanding through the **nine layers** of the body.
Suddenly, it transforms into **two Azure Dragons** in the eyes,
a **White Tiger** in the nostrils,
a **Vermilion Bird** over the heart,
a **Spirit Serpent** at the left foot,
and a **Azure Tortoise** at the right.
Two maidens in **brocade robes**, bearing **flames of light**, stand at the ear gates.

Swallow the saliva **seven times**,
and call the **Seven Souls** by name:
**Shi Gou, Fu Shi, Que Yin, Tun Zei, Fei Du, Chu Zui, Chou Fei.**
The incantation:

*"The Nine Returns of the Pure *Qi*, restraining the Souls, repelling deceit.
The Heavenly Marshal guards the gate, the maiden holds the pass.
Refine the Souls to gentleness, let them dwell with me in harmony.
Do not move recklessly—
watch over the **Source of Form**.
If hunger or thirst arises, allow the **Yellow Elixir** to be consumed."*

**Incantation before sleep:**

At the time of retiring to bed, the **Four Beasts** shall emerge to guard the body.
The **Azure Dragon** issues from my liver, residing at my left.
The **White Tiger** issues from my lungs, residing at my right.
The **Vermilion Bird** issues from my heart, residing before me.
The **Spirit Serpent** issues from my kidneys, residing behind me.

You, the **Four Beasts**,
grind your teeth and sharpen your blades,
dwelling at my left, right, front, and rear—
repelling all malevolent spirits and wicked ghosts,
keeping them a thousand leagues distant,
so they dare not come near
and disturb my **Jade Chamber**.

Sleep soundly and peacefully,
free from evil dreams and spectral illusions.
**Swiftly, swiftly, as the commandments decree.**

**Incantation for Preserving the Spirit:**
The liver stores the **Soul** (*hun*),
the lungs store the **Soul** (*po*),
the heart stores the **Spirit** (*shen*),
the spleen stores the **Will** (*zhi*),
the kidneys store the **Essence** (*jing*).

The **Azure Dragon** returns to my liver,
the **White Tiger** returns to my lungs,
the **Vermilion Bird** returns to my heart,
the **Spirit Serpent** returns to my kidneys.
The **Yellow Dragon** (*Huang Long*) steadies my spleen,
to fortify my **abdomen** (*real venter*).

No malevolent spirits or wicked ghosts
shall dwell below.
**Swiftly, swiftly, as the commandments decree.**

Another method:
When lying down, place your hand upon your heart
and pray:
*"May the **Heavenly Spirit** (*Tian Ling*) and **Vital Nodes** (*Jie Rong*) flourish,
granting me eternal life.
O **Five Zang** (*visceral sovereigns*), may you now rest in tranquility.
If a man recites this seven times,
or a woman recites it twenty-four times,
it will ensure longevity and freedom from illness."*

**Method for Warding Off Evil Dreams:**
If an evil dream arises, do not speak.

**Morning Ritual for Warding Off Evil Dreams:**
At dawn, spit upon the water facing east. Recite the incantation:
*"May evil dreams cling to grasses and trees,
and auspicious dreams become precious jade."*

**Method for Calming the Five Zang:**
On the night of the new moon, when all is still, lie with your head facing north. Place your left hand upon your heart and recite:
*"O sovereigns of the Five Zang,
divine manifestations of Dao and virtue,
the Sun is your lord, the Moon your lady—
all now guard the True Person [Name].
Men recite seven times, women recite fourteen times,
to prolong life and enhance longevity."*

**Method for Safe Travel:**
Before setting out, keep the *Dou Gang* (Big Dipper’s handle) in mind above your head, silently reciting without pause. Thus, you shall not encounter malevolent spirits, and all paths shall be auspicious.
If going to war, hold the *Dou Bing* (Big Dipper’s handle) before you, pointing at the enemy—great fortune shall follow.
Incantation:
*"The primal power of Heaven, beneficent and unyielding,
swiftly, as the commandments decree."*

**Method for Subduing Demons:**
When sleeping, or walking in darkness, or encountering stubborn, malevolent spirits causing mischief, steady your body and mind, casting aside all distractions. Recite:
*"At the tip of a single hair,
the Jewel King’s realm appears.
Seated in motes of dust,
the Great Dharma Wheel turns.
Extinguishing all sentient beings,
piercing the veil of dusty labor.
Within your subtle awareness,
as wind extinguishes flame.
Like a blade cutting water—
no contact remains.
You are like boiling water,
they are like solid ice.
As warm *qi* approaches,
they shall soon perish."*

**Method for Ceasing Ear Ringing:**
If ear ringing persists, focus your mind and recite:
*"Spirit is present, spirit is present, spirit is present."*

**Incantation to Banish Sleep:**
*"Om! Jidi Yidi Pige Na Dan Di Po Sa Ba He!"*
The master should step onto the left foot upon ascending the bed, clacking the teeth seventy-seven times, preventing sleep.
This practice, when maintained, is supremely refined.

**Method for Warding Off Calamities:**
When the master fears disaster by day or night, or encounters the Three Calamities and Nine Adversities, recite:
*"I take Heaven as my father,
Earth as my mother.
Within them, I dwell as an innocent child.
The Sun is my clerk, the Moon my scribe.
Thunderer and Lightning Mother stand at my sides,
Wind Lord and Rain Master at my fore and aft.
The Six Jia talismans encircle me.
The Azure Dragon supports my left,
the White Tiger attends my right.
The Vermilion Bird guides my front,
the Dark Warrior follows my rear.
The Northern Dipper covers my head,
the Celestial Ganges points to my hands.
The Azure Serpent coils at my feet,
to annihilate my misfortunes.
Within the Elixir Chamber I reside,
Taiyi as my consort.
Three on the left, seven on the right,
wearing Nine above, stepping One below.
Two and four as shoulders,
six and eight as feet.
Within this, I dwell—
my abdomen fortified.
Now I command ten thousand ghosts and spirits:
Return to your proper stations.
Those who oppose me shall die,
those who betray me shall perish.
Flee swiftly, hide in obscurity!
Heaven’s mighty enforcers,
behead all inauspicious omens!
Swiftly, as the Highest Celestial Jade Purity True King’s decree."*

This incantation repels a hundred evils and the Five Plague spirits, banishing all unrighteous ghosts and deities.
The practitioner should visualize and recite it within a purified space.

**Method for Restoring the Spirit:**
On the fifteenth and last days of each month, first speak inwardly: *"Spirit, spirit."*
Then, with the left hand pressed upon the heart, whisper:
*"Spirit, spirit, dwell in my palace.
Enter my hall, abide with me.
Speak with me—
never depart from my side."*

「The Yellow **Qi** guards the center and transforms into the **Dao/Way**-form.
*Photah! Photah!* Swiftly, as the decree.
Recite three times to the right—then the **Dao/Way**-form guards the body,
and a hundred evils and myriad illnesses cannot enter.

**Method for Illuminating the Eyes:**
At the time of the rooster’s crow,
visualize within the eyes that each contains a person,
three inches tall, clad in black robes, standing upright.
Respectfully recite the incantation:
*"Left Eye, Right Moon—restored to the **Dao/Way**-form of **Xuanlang** (玄朗).
Grant me piercing vision—
all matters a thousand *li* distant shall be seen.*
Recite twenty-one times.
Or if one has afflictions,
it shall prevent their revelation.

**Method for Self-Solving Sorrows:**
If the practitioner’s eyes blink involuntarily,
ears ring, heart races, or face grows hot—
a **Dao/Way**-form sorrow is approaching,
and misfortune is certain.
Silently recite the incantation:
*"The **Dao/Way**-form Master of Life and Heavenly Communication,
bind my fate with a golden thread—
grant me eternal prosperity, endless years.*
Recite three times, and it shall cease.

**Incantation for Preventing Hair Loss from Combing:**
Upon the **Dao/Way**-form’s crown,
the **Xuanhua** (玄華) **Baojing** (寶精) resides.
The left is the **Yinyi** (隐日) Eye,
the right is the **Yuegen** (月根) Moon.
Today’s refinement shall benefit a hundred **Dao/Way**-forms.
After completion, comb the hair—
it shall never fall again.
The **Dao/Way**-form’s brilliance is revealed.

if a **divine figure in a crown and simple attire** appears, it is an omen of fortune.
This may avert death and bring rebirth.
**Avoid**: filial sons, monks, chickens and dogs, menstruating women, and omens of ill fortune.
By this method, swallow the talisman to dispel **malevolent spirits** and **preserve life**.

Gather the *qi* of the **five directions** into the talisman,
and summon the **Five Star Spirits of Imperial Response (五星灵应帝君)**,
to harmonize and extend the lifespan of a certain person.
**Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Sovereign (元始天尊) decrees to the True Lord of the Dharma (本师真君).**
Inscribe one talisman and wear it on the head.
Inscribe three more and swallow them.
At night, inscribe one more.
Use **five-colored paper money** as a substitute for the person’s body,
and with **seven parts tea wine**, under the open sky,
face the **Northern Dipper and its myriad stars**,
and set up an incense altar with lamps and candles to worship as prescribed.
The **Dharma Master** and **fasting officials** shall fully confess all sins committed in life.
In silence, pray to:
**Northern Dipper Supreme of the Dark Vault (北斗玄穹上帝),**
**Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (北斗七元星君),**
**Left Minister and Right Minister Stars (左辅右弼星君),**
and the **Divine Marshal of the Northern Dipper (北斗中神仙将吏).**
For **so-and-so**, whose parents have suffered prolonged illness,
and who is also imprisoned by public litigation, unable to resolve it,
**so-and-so** now offers their **lifespan and years of fortune**,
to prolong and protect the lives of their parents.
After the prayers conclude,
under the **Northern Dipper’s stars**, burn the **five-colored paper money**—
a substitute for the person’s body—
and present the **paper money petition**.
Thus, for every **first offense of the month**, three times,
fortune and benefit shall be attained.

**Three days constitute one divination (算),**
**one year constitutes one lifespan (寿),**
**twelve years constitute one cycle (纪).**
The **Jiazi divination**, repeated **seven times**, shall confirm the efficacy of the incantation.

**Right Method of the Daoist Master’s Practice:**
At night, when going to sleep, the **Northern Dipper’s stars** shall be observed for omens of response.
Arrange the **divine formations (罡)** on the mat,
lie down, and recite the **Northern Dipper incantation**,
preserving the body as a **White Crane Immortal (白鹤仙人)**,
gazing upward at the Dipper to await **Heaven’s decree**.
Before sleep, recite the **Great Protective Body Incantation** once more.
Those who receive the **Great Dao** shall daily preserve their spirit,
reciting it **ten times**, or even **thousands and millions of times**—
its merit is beyond description.

**Ritual for Establishing the Altarpiece (建坛式)**

In all cases of establishing the altarpiece,
sit facing south with north at your back,
and arrange the **Three Teacher (三师)** positions.
In the center, place the **Uppermost True (上真)** position;
to the left, the **Divine General (神将)** position;
to the right, the **Dharma Master (法师)** position.
Additionally, set one **Celestial Master (天师)** position,
and place an ink seal box on either side.
Place a peach-branch altar before the table,
and set out a jar of water.
At the heart of the altarpiece,
secure the **mirror-sword (镜剑)**.

**Rite of Prohibition (禁式)**

For those who wish to perform this ritual,
upon entering the chamber,
first recite the **Purification of the Body Incantation (浄身咒)**,
then the **Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation (浄天地咒)**.
When finished,
next recite the **Incantation for Entering the Gate (入户咒)**.
Visualize the **Functionary Officials’ Divine Soldiers (功曹神兵)** descending from the void to your left and right.
Pinch the second knuckle of your index and middle fingers,
and perform the **Yu Bu (禹步)** in the **Fighting Stance (斗)**.
Gaze toward the southeast and gather *qi*,
blowing it leftward and rightward.
Visualize yourself as the **True King (真王)**,
with the **Four Spirits (四灵)**—left as the **Sun Spirit (日)**, right as the **Moon Spirit (月)**—
the **Five Stars (五星)** above your head,
and the **Twenty-eight Constellations (二十八宿)** encircling you.
The **Divine Mist (神霄)** and **Divine Treasury (神府)** stand beside the Teacher,
like a dense fog.

Next, visualize the **True King (真王)**, **Qinghua (青华)**, and **Master Han (韩君)**—the **Three Teachers (三师)**—
within the **Five-Colored Auspicious Clouds (五色庆云)** in the southeast.
Having completed the **Three Celestial Steps (三台丁步)** before the incense altar,
press your hands to your heart,
and strike your teeth three times,
visualizing the *qi* of the **Nine-Colored Clouds (九色云炁)** rising from the incense,
piercing the **Nine Heavens (九天)**.

**Invocation:**

*"The sky is clear, the *qi* pure,
the Three Lights (三光) radiant and bright.
The Golden Chamber, the Jade Hall,
where Five Sacred Herbs (五芝) flourish with treasure.
The Black, Yellow, Purple, and White *qi* come to illumine my form.
The Jade Boys and Jade Girls (玉童玉女)
attend to my sacred rites.
The Nine *qi* ascend in harmony,
the Three Lights move as one.
The Purple Canopy (紫盖) rises,
and I ascend into the Imperial Court (帝庭).
Swiftly, swiftly, as the sacred decree."*

**Next, offer incense and present the petition:**

*"Your humble servant of the [designated rank],
with incense burning and precious sticks ablaze,
the ritual drawn from the Celestial Texts (天文).
From the Golden Furnace (金炉),
the auspicious *qi* condenses in the void.
Scattering the Jade Smoke (玉烟),
the auspicious clouds form a canopy.
In response to this reverence,
I must now invoke the mirror.

With sincere devotion, I pray to the **Numinous True Ones (灵真)**,
that they descend and echo my call.

Now I perform the ritual,
offering with reverence the **Dao Incense (道香)**,
the **Virtue Incense (德香)***,
the **Incense of Effortless Purity (无为清浄香)***,
the **Incense of Naturalness (自然香)***,
the **Incense of Marvelous Cavernous Truth (妙洞真香)***,
the **Incense of Numinous Treasure and Wisdom (灵宝慧香)***,

to honor the **Three Pure Ones (三清上帝)**,
the **Ten Directions of Highest Truth (十极高真)**,
the **Ancestral Teacher, Most High Numinous Celestial Master, True King of Jade Purity, Eternal Life Preserver, Heavenly Sovereign of Command (祖师高上神霄玉清真王长生保命天尊)**,
the **Master Teacher, Most High Numinous Celestial King, Qinghua the Saviour of Suffering, Eternal Life Preserver, Heavenly Sovereign of Fixed Fate (宗师高上神霄玉清王青华救苦太一定福天尊)**,

the **Leftmost Numinous One (左玄真人)***,
the **Officer of the Demon-Driving Agency (驱邪院使)***,

the **Two Great Generals Commanding the Armies (统兵二大将军)***,
the **Generals of the Thunder Department (雷部诸大将军)***,
the **Divine Symbol Clerks and Soldiers (神符吏兵)***,
the **Functionary Officials’ Messengers (功曹使者)***,
and all **Rulers and Sovereigns (一切主宰)**.
May they descend their **True *Qi* (真炁)**,
enter my humble servant’s **penetrating script (笔法)**,
and inscribe the **divine symbols (符)** to subdue ghosts,
with great and numinous power.

Your servant, presumptuous and guilty of transgressing Heaven’s might,
deserves ten thousand deaths.
Your servant, in deepest dread and fear,
prostrates with head bowed and hands clasped,
twice kneels in solemn reverence,
and humbly speaks these words."*

When performing rituals before all **Rulers and Sovereigns (一切主宰)**, one should present the request as desired and they will grant it. After completing the invocation, recite the **Great Exorcism Chant (都咒)** once, gather **True *Qi* (真炁)**, and blow it onto the pen. Then, strike the pen three times firmly on the ground before writing. Do not speak with others, lest you risk wearying the **Divine (神)**.

Use only **yellow silk with vermilion script (黄素朱书)** for the **Great Exorcism Chant (都咒)**, placing it within the pen’s shaft. On every **third *Jiu* day (三九日)***, gather **True *Qi* (真炁)** three times and infuse it into the pen’s shaft. For ordinary writing purposes, this **ritual pen (法笔)** must not be used.

When entering a patient’s home for treatment, wear the **True Form Diagram (真形图)** and carry the **Step-Drum (步斗)** with care. Next, lay out the **Divine Domain Diagram (分域图)** on the ground, visualizing it as a **true golden jade gate (真金玉阙)**, with thirty doors—eastern, western, front, and back—each emitting golden radiance and jade light that envelops my body.

Then, with the left hand, pinch the **Hypothetical Celestial Stem (辰文)** and write the **Summoning Functionary Officials’ Symbol (召功曹符)** once, burning it on the **Perseus direction (巽)**. When the **Functionary Officials (功曹)** arrive, loudly proclaim:

*"To me, by fire! Quickly assemble all the **Divine Generals (灵官)** of this **Domain (府)**, the **Functionary Officials (功曹)**, **Generals (将军)**, **Junior Officers (童君)**, **Jade Juniors (玉童)**, **Jade Maidens (玉女)**, and **Clerks and Soldiers (吏兵)**!

Now, burn the **left and right Supervisors’ Talismans (左右总监坛符)** and the **Generals’ Talismans (将军符)**.

*"To me, **Commanders of the Armies (统兵)**! Follow me to the home of **so-and-so (某人)**. Seize the **ghosts and gods (鬼神)**, interrogate the **possessing entity (附体)**, and reveal its name in clear speech. Swiftly! (疾疾)**.*

*"If further use is required, present the request as desired and employ them accordingly. Now, invoke the **Dispatched Chants (遣咒)**:

*'By the **Sovereign’s Mandate (皇天睿命)** and the **Jade Emperor’s Symbol (玉帝颁符)**, I am entrusted with this **Daoist office (法职)**, overseeing the **Jade Celestial Treasury (神霄玉府)**, granted the **Nine Sacrificial Offerings (九锡)**, the **Ten Auspicious Titles (十贾)**, the **Eight Thunders of Authority (八威之册)**, the **Lantern-Carriage of the Celestial (丹霄之舆)**, the **Dragon Script and Phoenix Seal (龙文凤玺)**, and the *Purple Silk Canon (紫素之书)*.

**End of Volume Four of the *Highest God of Celestial Serenity’s Purple Scripture Great Law***

**Volume Five: Refining the True and Verifying the Immortal**

**Lord Khan, the Paternal Uncle, instructs those aspiring to Daoist cultivation:**

The **True King**, commissioned by Heaven, governs the central realm.
The **Jade Emperor** descends his spirit, harmonizing the flourishing of Dao.
He opens the **seven-stage secret talismans**, arranging the **three-grade forbidden scriptures**.
His might governs the ten thousand heavens; his merit surpasses all ranks.

The transmitted Law has its own cultivation—its functions are not easily exhausted.

The **Highest Celestial Serenity Secret Talismans** are indeed the **Mystic Essence of the Primordial Origin**, the ultimate aspiration of all saints.
In the **Kaihuang era**, they were bestowed from the **Eastern Reserve Palace**.
Established across countless kalpas, they were never transmitted to lowly disciples.
Sealed with **purple jade**, hidden in the **uppermost green pavilion**.
Greatly preserving the order of Heaven and Earth, subtly summoning the spirits—
All true officials follow this wondrous model.

Now, as Heaven’s auspicious age dawns and the age of High Perfection arrives,
Pitying the common folk lost in heterodox practices,
The **Highest Celestial Serenity** reveals its celestial secrets,
To restore the vast source of the Great Teaching.
For every thought of compassion, countless beings are liberated.
Having received this precious instruction,
One must strive to emulate pure cultivation.

Ascend the **Celestial Serenity Unity Stage**,
Transcend the **Green Silk Great Thousand-Worlds**.
Pursue your lofty resolve—do not slacken your initial resolve.
Believe, receive, and practice—thus attaining divine response.

Moreover, the **Three Officials** hold the pen in judgment,
The **Five Sovereigns** wield the talismans—
Recording virtue and vice without error,
Chronicling deeds and misdeeds without omission.
Whoever dares transgress shall face no pardon from the Great Law.
This proclamation extends infinitely—all must strive with diligence.

**The Seven-Stage Rectification of Offices and Ranks for the Celestial Serenity Preservation-of-Immortal Secret Talismans** is now conferred.

Those who have **not yet received the *Nine-Grade Scripture-Talismans of the Most High*** are called **White Tablet disciples**, and should be addressed as **Celestial Serenity Initial True Disciples**.

Those who have **received the *Seven Elements Eternal Youth Talismans of the Most High*** are called **Celestial Serenity Peace-Assisting Transformation Disciples**.

Those who have received the **Northern Emperor’s Subduing-Demons Abyssal Ascension Talismans** are called **Highest Celestial Serenity Peace-Assisting Transformation Disciples**.

Those who have received the **One-Alliance, Three-Five, Nine-Districts Functional Talismans** are called **Highest Celestial Serenity Peace-Assisting Transformation Law-Talisman Bearers**.

Those who have received the **Purple Void Yang Light Talismans** and the **Celestial Serenity Lower-Grade Scripture-Talismans** shall be addressed as **Highest Celestial Serenity Primordial Transformation Masters of Mysterious and Wondrous Origin**. If incomplete, they may be called simply the **Ten-Character Title-Bearers** of the preceding rank.

Those who have received the **Soul Treasures Central Alliance Law-Talismans** shall be addressed as **Highest Celestial Serenity Cavernous Transformation Masters of Preservation and Salvation, Illuminated and Harmonious Purple Light Lords**. The **Sixteen-Character Title** marks the second stage; if incomplete, they may be called **Masters of Mysterious and Wondrous Origin**.

Those who have received the **Upper Clarity Great Cavern Talismans** shall be addressed as **Highest Celestial Serenity Jade Heaven Cavernous Landscape Masters of Void Primordial Unification**. As the first stage, if incomplete, they may be called **Celestial Serenity Cavernous Landscape Masters of Void Primordial Truth**.

For the **Highest Celestial Serenity Great Dao**, one must have received the Great Cavern Talismans and shall be addressed as **Master [Surname] of [Mountain Name], [Qi]-True Person**.

The ranks and titles for the **Celestial Serenity Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries** are fully recorded hereafter.

All initial-stage disciples and those who have received the Talismans must **devote their hearts to cultivation**, avoiding reckless transgression of ranks, lest **True Qi be disordered** and **spiritual clarity obscured**. The **Three Officials** will then **seize their fate**, and the **Nine Ancestors** will **suffer retribution**. Be cautious, and **eternally preserve the Dao-True**.

Yet they cannot ascend to the noble station of the **High Celestial Jade Palace**, nor wield authority over the **Supreme Celestial Bureau**.

Their ritual robes are:
- **Pure Jade Three-Flowered Crown** (emerald or triple-pure).
- **Purple Essence and Water Jade Hairpin**.
- **Thirty-six-panel Robe of Pure Purple**.
- **Emerald-Brown Outer Garment with Yellow Skirt**.
- **Azure-Trimmed Skirt**.
- **Yellow Flower Jade Tablet**.
- **Red Footwear and Jade Pendant**.
- **Sword of Five-Eight Elixir Precision**, three *chi* two *cun* long.
- **Platform of the Three Lights and Eight Measures**.

If one receives the scriptures and completes all three stages, attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the rank of **High Sovereign Daoist Lord of the Three Heavens**, equal to the saints.

Unless they present petitions and registers to the **True Ones**, conducting rituals in accordance with the sacred scriptures, they may not arbitrarily don these ritual robes. Inspecting officials shall verify their attainment.

**Celestial Mastery Supplementary Official Ranks:**

Those who receive the Celestial Mastery’s teachings begin as **Highest Celestial Mastery Great Peace Auxiliary-Transformation Officials**, charged with implementing the Celestial Mastery’s great law and assisting in the **Scripture Bureau’s rightful affairs**.

If, within one year, they accumulate **140 merits of conduct, virtue, and righteousness**, they may petition the **Celestial Mastery’s Heavenly Bureau** for promotion to **Celestial Official ranks**.

Those who govern the **Eight Offices** shall not exceed the **Celestial Mastery’s ranks**, nor surpass the **Celestial Realm**. They may attain **Celestial Official ranks**, governing mortal affairs as if ruling the world from heaven. Below, they correspond to **Functionary Officials**; above, they align with **Heaven’s Will**. This is the **Celestial Rank**, entering the **Daoist Lineage**, transcending mortality to become saints.

To govern the **Heavenly Bureau** is not to be exceeded—offenses are grave.

Those who receive the **Three Caverns’ scriptures and registers**, ascending to the rank of **Celestial Mastery True Officials**, follow the same regulations as **Official Disciples**, managing **clerical duties** rather than **celestial appointments**.

Those who have received the **Orthodox One’s registers** and hold **nine ranks of Celestial Officials**—as **Officials, Disciples, or True Officials**—enter the **nine grades of initial rank**.

The ranks above the **First Rank Officials** require **380 merits**; one official grade is advanced per year, and they may be called **Judges of the Jade Pure Palace**.

**Four Auxiliaries:**
- **Right Official Comrade-Shooting**
- **Left Official Comrade-Shooting**
- **Right Attendant of the Mysterious Golden Gate**
- **Left Attendant of the Mysterious Golden Gate**

For those above the **Four Auxiliaries**, **360 merits** are required. Each act of saving a person, delivering a person, or performing a great **virtue/power** deed for a living being counts as merit.

When advancing an official grade, one must submit a petition to the **Supreme Sovereign** without omission. If there is a fault, one must immediately confess and offset the merit against the fault.

**The Daoist Officials** must each day burn the **Talisman of Official Rank** to advance one grade. During their term of duty, they command **ten million spirit-soldiers and officials**. If they do not burn the talisman, the spirits will consume it themselves, but they will still have Daoist Officials to assist them.

**Invocation of the Daoist Officials’ Department Talisman:**
*"High in the heavens, the Jade Pure Palace reigns supreme.
The Celestial Treasure of the Three **Qi** governs the Three **Provincial Ministries** of the **Pivot**.
Before the **Supreme Sovereign**, the Heavenly Tribunal and Palace of **Life Decrees** presides.
Each has its appointed duty, aiding the **Jade Laws** below.
Ranked by grade and stationed in their places, the Daoist Officials reside.
At the call, they descend in obedience; at the **Heavenly Seal**, they align.
The lofty decree of the **Heavenly Highness** is revered—
I humbly petition the **Certain Official**,
to act in accordance with the **Laws** and fulfill their command."*

**Invocation of the Daoist Officials’ General Talisman:**
*"The **Right Mysterious Golden Gate Talisman**—
The **Mystic Pass** of the **Supreme Sovereign**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Heavenly Demon**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Earthly Demon**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Ghostly Demon**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Naked Demon** of the **Blue Sky Demon King**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Beastly Demon** of the **Red Sky Demon King**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Mountain-Reversing Demon** of the **White Sky Demon King**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Homeless Demon** of the **Black Sky Demon King**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Force-Bearing Demon** of the **Yellow Sky Demon King**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Great Demon Lord of the Six Abysses of the **Pangdu** Region**,
The **Supreme Decree** to the **Ten Million Demons** to obey and act.
The **Heavenly Officials** lead the way and sever the **Ghostly Traces**.
The **Thirty-Six Heavenly Gods’ Talisman**—
With **flying spears and drifting halberds**, they strike down offenders.
The **Great Abyssal Ghost-Demons** dare not charge forward.
By **wind, thunder, and fire**, they shatter the ghosts.
At the command, they lead the way—when the talisman arrives, they act.
*Swiftly, as the **Highest Heavenly Sovereign** commands.*
This talisman is inscribed with the **hourly stem and branch**, using the **perverse **Qi****, written in **cinnabar** on **yellow paper**.
It is drawn with a **barrier-child** to command the **Ghostly Demon** to lead the way and suppress the ghosts.
Within the talisman are the **spirit-officials, merit-recorders, and talisman-bearers**,
who petition the **Suffering Spirits** to submit their words.
The **Heavenly Tribunal’s Spirit-Generals** will then act in their stead.
Before the **spirit-official’s** arrival, the **spirit-talisman-bearers** will first reach the afflicted’s home,
and without waiting for the master, they will bind the ghosts below.
The master arrives, and the bonds are severed and the ghosts dispatched.

Another method: burn the talisman and blow its ashes away—
the ghosts will be seized immediately.
For distant cases, inscribe the **hourly stem and branch**,
blow the talisman’s ashes, and point with a sword—
the malevolence will depart ten thousand *li* away.

For **mountain goblins, Five Paths spirits, and malevolent ghosts** that cannot be treated,
or when one is in a **mad, frenzied state**,
use **vinegar and charcoal** to burn the talisman and fumigate them.
The talisman must be inscribed with the **Five Emperors’ Great Demon King Spell**,
and the **Demon-Subduing Mystic Pass Spell** must be recited in secret.

**Talismans for Transcending the Heavens and Piercing the Earth:**
**Mystic Pass Talisman for Transcending the Heavens:**
*"O **Transcending-Heaven General**—
Green and white, eyes sharp and keen,
Heart-armor of gold, red silk with golden sleeves,
**Daoist belt**, white trousers, and crimson shoes,
Brandishing a sword.
*Swiftly, by the **Heavenly Laws**!*"

**Mystic Pass Talisman for Piercing the Earth:**
*"O **Piercing-Earth General**—
Face of **purple and mulberry hue**, brows and eyes fierce,
Heart-armor of gold, yellow robe, and **black-green** undergarment."

**Invocation of the Jade Boy Department Spell:**
*"I humbly petition the **Celestial Treasure Jade Pure Palace**,
its **Twelve Jade Boys**—
The **Jade Boy of the Daily Jade Mist**,
The **Jade Boy of the Celestial Treasure**,
By the **Supreme Sovereign’s** command,
I swiftly descend with you.
*Swiftly, as the **Jade Pure Palace** commands.*
**Jade Pure Palace Spell**."

The **Twelve Jade Boys** of **five-colored embroidered robes**—
**Green-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Blue-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**White-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Black-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Indigo-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Red-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Crimson-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Purple-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Dark-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Plain-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Yellow-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords),
**Jade Mist-feathered, embroidered-robed Jade Boy** (Five Lords).

**The Jade Boys’ Method for Commanding and Employing Ten Thousand Spirits:**
The **Twelve Jade Boys** above, according to the **Laws**, are visualized in their **five-colored embroidered robes**.
In spring, the **three months**, one boy governs the **Five Lords** for each month.
In summer, autumn, and winter, the **three months** each, one boy governs the **Five Lords** for each month.
During this month, the talisman is inscribed and burned to summon them.
The **Jade Boys** attend, guard, command, and present themselves before the **True One**.

When summoning them, one must also **visualize the General Spell**, the **perverse **Qi****, and inscribe it in **cinnabar**.
For all who wish to employ them, on each **three-nines day** (i.e., 27th day of each lunar month),
prepare **five bowls** of **date wine, glutinous rice milk, and honeyed rice gruel**,
along with **fragrant flowers**.
After calling the **Jade Boy**, one may employ them.

**The Jade Boy’s Method for Seizing Ghosts:**
The **Jade Boy** (not a female spirit) closes their eyes,
absorbs the **ghostly **Qi****,
and blows out a breath.
In darkness, they call the names of the **Three Souls**,
and within, they point to the **Superintendent Spell** and tightly **visualize it**.
They blow out a **black breath**.
They **visualize the Jade Pure Palace Spell** and recite the spell three times.
The **Jade Boy** will then appear,
and one may petition the **Jade Boys** of the **direct day** to come,
using them as one pleases.

**The Jade Boy’s Method for Invoking the Nine Souls of the Jade Maiden:**

The **Jade Boy** recites the spell aloud,
invoking **Yingsu True Lord** (to compel spirits to manifest in form).
Again, he **visualizes the spell in his heart**,
summoning the **Green Boy** to obey his command,
and descend with **imperial edicts** to his servant.
Swiftly, he aids his servant in divining humans and objects,
and in **communing with spirits** to receive their responses.

**The Ritual for the Jade Maiden:**
On **Jiazi** or **Gengshen nights** (i.e., nights of the 1st Heavenly Stem or 7th Earthly Branch),
recite the **Law Spell** over water and drink it.
To invoke the **Jade Maiden’s Division**, he earnestly requests the **gentle and yielding Qi**,
the **Nine Souls of the Jade Maiden**, whose name is **Jade Maiden**.
She wears **phoenix-patterned robes and light embroidered skirts**,
by the **True King’s command**, summoned to the **Spirit Court**.
Swiftly, as the **Jade Pure Edict** commands.
**Hypograph the spell** with **perverse Qi**,
and write it down.

The **Jade Maiden’s Five Viscounts** hold:
- **A banner** with five-colored embroidered robes,
- **A scepter** with five-colored embroidered robes,

The **Jade Maiden’s Five Viscounts** of **Jiazi**, **Jiaxi**, **Jia申**, **Jiawu**, **Jiachén**, **Jayin**,
**Dingmào**, **Dingsì**, **Dingwèi**, **Dingyǒu**, **Dinghài**, and **Dingchǒu** are summoned.

**The Jade Maiden’s Retention:**
According to the Law, retain her.
On **Jiazi** or **Gengshen nights**, recite the **Law Spell** over water and ingest it.
Each has their own duties—
for **offering incense**, **presenting petitions**, **submitting memorials**, or **conducting rites**,
summon them as needed, and they will naturally attend.
After seven days of **fasting and abstinence** (斋戒),
they will appear at once.
Do not gaze upon the **Jade Maiden** for too long.
In a year, there are **six Yang**, **six Yin**, **six Jia**, and **six Ding** (天干).
Each month is divided into **three decans** (旬),
allocating **six Jia** and **six Ding**.
Each decan has one person,
with **five hundred men** serving as the decan’s attendants and guards,
alongside the **Jade Boy**, coming to assist.

She may also be employed to **seize spirits and pursue souls**,
and to **foresee future auspiciousness or calamity**.
Summon her by name and employ her at will—
she will respond without fail.

**The Supreme Invocation Spell:**

*"I obey the True King’s edicts,
the Jade Emperor’s golden talisman,
and establish this altar to inform the Heavens.
I model the Earth and mirror the Heavens,
and compel spirits to dispatch ghosts.
On my left, I bind the **Dragon Scripture’s** (龙文) power,
and on my right, I wear the **Jade Pure Celestial Edict’s** (玉律) authority.
With my mouth, I recite the **Jade Pure Feathered Edict** (玉清羽章),

Below, I command the spirits of **mountains, rivers, lands, and seas**,
and above, I list the **True King’s** ministers and viscounts.
I chant the **Great Mysterious Dao/Way’s** (大洞玄机) essence—
once invoked, the **Nine Celestial Life Officials** (九天司命) respond,
twice invoked, the **Nine Celestial True Immortals** (九天真仙) appear.

I am the **Immortal Sovereign** (仙主),
the **Supreme Venerable Master** (太上丈人),
and the **Five-Peak Mountain King’s** (五岳王主) overseer.
My duty is received in my heart.
I can **call the winds and absorb the rains**,

the **thunderous and fierce Heavenly Ding** (天丁),
to appear before the altar at once—
none may dare to defy his command.

Swiftly, as the **Highest Dao/Way of the Jade Pure True King’s Edict** decrees.

The **True King** says:
*"The **Spirit Treasury’s** Jade Scriptures,
the **Jade Palace’s** Sacred Texts,
each have their own duties and cases to oversee.
Every division has a master of **thirty thousand men**,
and each sends one down to descend.
**One hundred and twenty officials** descend to attend.
If there are matters to be addressed,
summon and question them—
one must first purify the body and mind.
If one reveals the **Heaven’s secrets** (天机),
he will die and fall into **Tangdu Hell** (酆都),
and be pardoned in **ten thousand kalpas** (万劫) not."*

**Following the talisman’s command** (承符所勑), **do not question my ability or victory**.
**They arrive swiftly**, **and must not delay**.

The Heavenly Spirit Officials, the myriad Heavenly Soldiers, the Golden-Armored Envoys, and the Commanding Generals—
**Receive my spoken command and carry it out below.**

First, inscribe the matter at hand upon the talisman, recite the spell, blow upon the talisman, and burn it.
**Fix your gaze**—**the true form shall manifest.**

Then declare:
*"With utmost reverence, I summon so-and-so Generals to the Sacred Altar.
Swiftly, as the Highest Celestial Sovereign of the Divine Tao commands."*

Take the **qi** and blow the ashes toward the sick or the place of concern, and with sword-pointing, shout: *"Disease, be gone!"*
**As you will it.**

Submit petitions and memorials, dispatching official documents and seals for use.

**Divine Regulations of the Celestial Treasury (Shén Fǔ Tiáo Yí):**
To receive the **supreme Daoist seals of the Celestial Treasury (Gāo Shàng Shén Fǔ fǎ luó fú yìn)**, fulfill one’s **celestial office (xiān zhí)**, and enter the **Grand Daoist Cadre (Dà Dòng xiān pǐn)**, one must first proclaim one’s **official rank (guān pǐn)**, then ascend in rank to attain the **Daoist official grades (xiān guān pǐn)**. This is not a mundane affair; it is known as **hidden leadership (àn lǐng)**. After daily practice, if the **divine qi (shén líng)** manifests anomalies, one may then enter the **first grade**. Gradually ascending in rank, one reaches the **ninth grade of the Daoist Cadre (jiǔ pǐn jiào zhí)**. According to the law: *"This is to enter the Celestial Treasury at night to adjudicate official matters, then ascend to the solar office by day."* Now, however, since mortal bodies are impure and cannot fully attain the **wondrous Dao (miào Dào)**, one must first **refine the body and atone for sins (liàn shēn xiè guò)**, **adjust the spirit and gather the qi (tiáo shén jí qì)**, to achieve even slight purity, thus allowing one to practice the Dao. If even slightly impure, one may not practice it. When future achievements are accomplished, one must **present a memorial to the Celestial Treasury (jù zòu shén fǔ)**, **face the Holy Sovereign (duì shèng gěi kuàng)**, and receive the **Daoist official seals (xiān guān luó)**. Wearing the **solar office seals (yáng zhí)** above and the **lunar office seals (yīn zhí)** below, one commands the **divine soldiers and generals (bīng jiàng)**, and none shall refuse. Thus, one attains the **perfect composition of the Daoist scriptures (měi zhuàn chéng zhāng)**.

The original **Daoist edicts (yuán kuàng)** once feared the leakage of **heavenly secrets (tiān jī)**, but the **Verdant Emperor of Azure Splendor (Qīng Huá Dà Dì)** declared: *"For all who wish to act, they must first **recollect and visualize the True Sovereign (Zhēn Wáng)** before the **auspicious sign (Zhào)**. They must also **daily draw the qi of the Celestial Treasury from the southeast (shén xiāo qì)**, which is **green in hue (qīng sè)**. When responding to seals, use **yellow silk paper inscribed with cinnabar (huáng sù dān shū)**, drawing the southeast qi and reciting the **Celestial Treasury incantation (shén xiāo jiè)**. The **middle finger bears the script (zhōng zhǐ shàng wén)**. Hold up the hands, extending the **second, fourth, and fifth fingers (èr sì wǔ zhǐ)**, to command the **divine officers and soldiers (shù yòng zhū jiàng děng)**, as needed in thought and deed. When **applying seals to summon deities (shī fú zhào shén)**, **direct the intent while writing (shì yì xià bǐ)**, and **close the qi at will (rén yì yú fú xià bǐ qì)** beneath the seal, **cultivating the left and right eyes seven times (yíng zuǒ yòu mù qī cì)**. The deity shall descend, and one shall naturally know it. **Official seals must be stamped with incantations (guān biǎo yòng yìn)**, requiring **secret mantras (mì zhòu)**, to await **divine response (gǎn yìng)**.

This method is not restricted to **Daoists or laypersons (dào sú)**, nor to **men or women (nán nǚ)**; all who have sincerity may practice it. To summon the **divine officers (zhū shén)**, one must first **invoke the Golden Boy functionaries (Yù Tóng Gōng Cáo)** to request them.

When applying seals and **visualizing the qi (cún xiàn)**, use the **inkstone as a Dragon Circle (yàn wéi Lóng Quān)**, the **ink as Red Jade (mò wéi Chì Yù)**, the **brush as Yellow Dragon (bǐ wéi Huáng Lóng)**, and the **paper as Golden Tablet (zhǐ wéi Jīn Bǎn)**. As one writes, **close the qi (bǐ qì)** and **focus the intent (zhù xiǎng)**, forming the **Golden Seal (jīn zhuàn)**. **Visualize the Five Stars of the Celestial Treasury (Shén Xiāo Jù Wǔ Xīng)** descending as **threads of light (sī máng)** into the seals. With water, **send them forth (shuǐ sòng zhī)**, and the **Five Stars shall stand in attendance (wǔ chén shì lì)**.

**Subduing Demons and Dispelling Ghosts (Fú Mó Xiāo Guǐ):**
The **Verdant Emperor of Azure Splendor (Qīng Huá Dà Dì)** said: *"I see demons and ghosts intermingling, now not subjugated by the **Forest of the Dao (Lín Zhì Dòng)**, causing harm to mortals and bringing calamity and illness."* By fortune, the **True Sovereign (Zhēn Wáng)** has appeared; I pray for **Your compassionate mercy (yán bèi cuí mǐn)**.

The **Verdant Emperor** further declared: *"The human heart governs all transformations (wàn huà). If one **harbors the divine spirit (cún qì shén)**, the spirit abides within the heart, governed by all transformations. If one **knows the divine spirit (rú zhī qì shén)**, the spirit guards the person. If one **does not know the divine spirit (zǐ bù zhī qì shén)**, the spirit departs from the person. If one **does not harbor the divine spirit (zǐ bù cún qì shén)**, the spirit returns to the person—this is the spirit’s nature."* The **Three Officials (Sān Guān)** lament, and the **Five Deities (Wǔ Shén)** depart the body. This is when **demons arise from within (mó cóng nèi qǐ)** and **ghosts come from without (guǐ cóng wài lái)**. When demons and ghosts rejoice, the **divine qi becomes a thief (shén biàn wéi zéi)**. **Life and death are inscribed in the left and right seals (zuò shēng míng yú zuǒ qiè, zhù sǐ luó yú yòu gōng)**. **Illness and injury invade the body (jí bìng lái shāng)**, how much more so to **prolong one’s distant lifespan (yǐ yán xiá shòu)**? I now beseech Your mercy and **explain the supreme Daoist method of Subduing Demons and Dispelling Ghosts (Wú Jí Jìn Mó Xiāo Guǐ zhī Dào)**. You must **listen attentively and receive it with reverence (mì tīng jìng xìn shòu zhī)**, not revealing it to the unworthy.

With this method, **all demons shall be banished (pì chú wàn mó)**, and the **three calamities (sān zāi)** shall not afflict you. The **nine adversities (jiǔ héng)** shall not invade, and **ten thousand ghosts and myriad fiends (wàn guǐ qiān yāo)** shall forever dare not approach.

**The Five-Star Demon-Subduing Method (Fú Mó Wǔ Xīng Fǎ):**
**Visualize the Golden Star (Jīn Xīng)** at the **head (tóu)**.
**Visualize the Wood Star (Mù Xīng)** at the **left ear (zuǒ ěr)**.
**Visualize the Water Star (Shuǐ Xīng)** at the **right ear (yòu ěr)**.
**Visualize the Fire Star (Huǒ Xīng)** at the **left shoulder (zuǒ jiān)**.
**Visualize the Earth Star (Tǔ Xīng)** at the **right shoulder (yòu jiān)**.

Invoke the **Five Stars with the Mantra of the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branches (Hé Lì Shén Xiāo)**:
[□] **left shoulder** [□] **right shoulder** [□] **right thigh** [□] **left thigh** [□] **above the heart** [□] **left breast** [□] **right breast**
Add the **Five Measures (Wǔ Dǒu)** to complete the incantation: *"..."*

The **Four Spirits counteracting**, the **Five Measures** come to aid.
A thousand calamities scatter and vanish, ten thousand misfortunes are self-removed.
Now I act, turning my back on **solitude and emptiness**.
What petty ghost dares approach my dwelling?
**Heavenly Laborers and Mighty Warriors**—when moved, they exterminate all.
*Urgent, urgent.*

This method, **subduing the heavens above and the earth below**, vanquishes all powerful ghosts—this is the most essential and wondrous Dao-gate.
It shifts stars and moves the moon, driving spirits and enslaving numinous beings—its efficacy is beyond measure.

**The Supreme Dao of the Celestial Palace’s Jade Purity True King’s Purple Script Great Dao Volume Seven concludes.**
**The Supreme Dao of the Celestial Palace’s Jade Purity True King’s Purple Script Great Dao Volume Eight.**

**Great Protective Body Method for Subduing Ghosts and Pacifying Demons**
The Master says: On the first day of the first month or before, stand in a secluded chamber, facing north, and pay four obeisances to the **Elemental Sovereign** [元君].
The **Elemental Sovereign** is the primordial lord who opened the heavens, also called the **Dao Ancestor Holy Mother** [道祖圣母].
If one does not pay homage to the Holy Mother, the practice of the Dao will never be efficacious.

Compose and recite a **Confession of Sins** [忏罪文].
After recitation, strike the teeth three times [叩齿三通], and in secret visualize the **Five Stars** [五星]:
- The **Solar Year Star** [岁星] in the left hand, its hue like jade.
- The **Great White Star** [太白] in the right hand, its hue like white jade.
- The **Mars Star** [荧惑] upon the crown, its hue like a fire pearl.
- The **Lunar Star** [镇星] within the heart, its hue like yellow gold.
- The **Wood Star** [辰星] beneath the feet, its hue like black gemstone.

All radiate divine light, illuminating the entire body.

Recite the incantation in secret:
*"Five Stars arrayed in splendor,
Their light piercing the dark abyss.
Ten thousand gods and saints,
Guard my true spirit.
Titanic heavens and fierce beasts,
Subdued by the Five Weapons.
Five Heavenly demons,
Perish in body and form.
Wherever I stand,
All gods pay homage.
Swiftly, as the Law commands."*

Again, visualize the Five Stars guarding you, their transformations boundless:
- The **Wood Star** transforms into a **Wind Wheel**.
- The **Fire Star** becomes a great flame, encircling the body.
- The **Metal Star** in the right hand becomes a **Diamond God-Sword**, its radiance piercing the heavens, emitting scorching fire.
- The **Wood Star** beneath the feet transforms into a river, swiftly becoming a sea, from which five dragons surge forth.

Recite the incantation:
*"Five Stars anchor my form,
Their light illuminating the fiery essence.
Preserve my five limbs,
Subdue my ten thousand spirits.
Six Heavenly demons,
Cut down upon movement.
Swiftly, as the Law commands."*

Next, visualize the **Heavenly Coalescent Killing Qi** [天罡大煞炁] descending from the **Heavenly Coalescent** [天罡].
Its qi is **yellow within, black without**, reaching before you—inhale it twelve times through the nose.

Recite the incantation:
*"Great Killing True Qi,
Yin within, Yang without.
Preserve my life-force,
Drive away evil, avert calamity.
Mountain goblins and wights,
Land spirits and [殃歹十羊].
Red-mouthed, white-tongued,
Serpents, beasts, wolves.
Those who harm me die,
Those who plot against me perish.
Those who love me prosper,
Those who serve me flourish.

**Form the Seal and Gesture** [造印式].

「The **Dharma** speaks: *"For all who form the Seal, let it be done on the days of **Jiazi** [甲子] or **Gengshen** [庚申], facing southeast, during the **Chen** [辰] and **Si** [巳] hours. In a **pure and secret chamber** [浄密室], first burn incense and silently pray to the **Celestial Sovereign** [神霄真炁] to blow into the wood.

Then, command the artisan to carve it within one hour, ensuring no breaks or interruptions in the strokes. Use **clear jade stone** [清玉石] or the **heartwood of the jujube tree** [赤枣心], and follow the **Dharma** to consecrate it. The **Dharma for consecrating the Seal** speaks:

*"For all who consecrate the Seal, let it be done on the **three nines day** [三九日] or **Jiazi** [甲子], at the time when humans are in **meditative stillness** [人定]. Set up a single table in the secret chamber, spreading **silk cloth** [缯帛] upon it. Offer **steamed cakes** [蒸饼] three pieces, **soup** [汤] three bowls, and **incense** [香] one burner. Also arrange **thirty-six candles** [三十六分列] on both sides as incense and lamps. Light the incense three times, and pour wine upon the table.

Stand in the northwest, facing south, and bow twice, stating: 'A humble servant, [臣某], who delights in longevity and cultivates the **Dao/Way** [大道] for great blessings, now solemnly offers this prayer. On this auspicious night, I devoutly prepare incense, lamps, and offerings to seek **spiritual grace** [灵贶].'

I, [臣某], humbly petition the **Great Emperor of Longevity** [长生大帝君], the **Emperor of Azure Clarity** [青华大帝君], the **Revered Master of Good Life** [好生韩君丈人], the **True Sovereign of the Radiant Treasure Heaven** [曜华玉宝天真皇人], the **Upper True Sovereign of the Celestial Sovereign Jade Gate** [神霄玉阙上真元君], the **True Consorts** [左右真妃], the **Celestial Minister** [上相仙伯], the **True Officials of Left Clarity and Right Extremity** [左华右极真宰仙圣], the **Celestial and Spirit Officials** [仙官灵官], the **Saintly Assembly of the Seal of Universal Chapter** [通章印中圣众], the **Jade Text and Precious Seal** [玉文琼玺], and the **Swiftly Commanded General of Thunder-Fire to Sever Evil and Pursue Plague** [急催追捉斩邪断瘟电火大将军], as well as the **Saintly Assembly of Seal-Bearers** [掌印捧印擎印圣众], the **Local Deities of the Direct Altar** [直坛土地], and all **true spirits** [一切真灵].

I, [臣某], am pure in body and mind, bearing this **precious Seal** [宝印]. May I be free from internal illness and external malevolence, aiding **Heaven** in its transformations and assisting the **state** in saving its people, severing all evil and banishing malevolent spirits. Yesterday, on the [某] year, [某] month, [某] day, at [某] hour, I went to [某处] and, following the **scriptures** [箓], received the transmission of the **Celestial Sovereign Jade Text Seal** [神霄玉文琼玺], the **Universal Chapter Precious Talisman** [通章宝符], and the **Thunder-Fire Seals for Swiftly Severing Evil** [雷火斩邪急捉等印]. Now, on this auspicious day, I solemnly consecrate and offer them in the **pure chamber** [浄室] of [某处].

The Seals I have received were, on the [年月日], presented to the **Three Teachers** [三师帝君] in a **flying petition** [飞奏]. I humbly beg for their **command** [勑命] to be issued and bestowed upon my subordinates and all those involved, so that when they encounter my movement, they may verify, recognize, and execute them accordingly.

Furthermore, I beg for the **bestowal of Heavenly Saints to guard the Seal** [天仙圣众护印], and for the **Spirit Kings of Thunderous Might and Divine Envoys** [神王雷霆猛吏、直符使者] to protect the **Jade Text Universal Chapter Talisman** [玉文通章符印].

May the **Dao/Way’s myriad layers of virtue/power** [道炁] flow into my Seals, enabling me to summon **spirit generals** [神将], rally **divine soldiers** [吏兵], capture **evil essences** [邪精], and slay **spirit demons** [神鬼], thereby rescuing the people and achieving swift efficacy.

Next, I wish to petition **Heaven** naturally, aligning with longevity, ascending to the **Jade Palace** [玉府], and paying homage to the **Supreme Deity** [上帝], merging with the **Dao/Way’s true essence** [道合同].

I, [臣某], am overwhelmed by reverence and awe, bowing repeatedly. I light incense, pour wine, scatter flowers, and bow again. The **Celestial Sovereign Jade Text Seal** [神霄玉文宝印] is hidden in the **Nine Heavens and Eighty Thousand Eons** [九霄八万余劫].

This command aligns with the **virtuous and auspicious** [契贤昌运], as desired by **immortals and spirits** [仙民]. Before using it, one must first consecrate it to gain its efficacy. Spread the **Elemental Heaven’s Blockhouse** [元天坎户] upon my head and the **Square Earth’s Separate Palace** [方成离宫] beneath my feet.

With **five divine swords** [神剑] and **five precious mirrors** [宝镜], five **silk banners** [缯旛], five **soup bowls** [栢汤], five **offerings of seasonal fruits** [时果], and one **cauldron of jujube honey and incense soup** [木蜜陵香汤], along with **pure water and strong tea** [浄水清酽], arrange incense and flowers below the altar, in two middle layers, and one upper layer. Place the five Seals below the **Nine Heavens Lamp** [九霄灯], following the **Great Microconstellation’s Aegis** [太微罡].

I humbly report: *"A minor servant of the Celestial Sovereign, [臣某], now reverently petitions the **Three Teachers** [三师帝君], the **True Sovereign of Heaven** [天真皇人], the **Master of the Han Department** [韩司丈人], the **Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Palace** [玉府天尊], the **Thunder-Fire General** [雷火大将军], the **Universal Chapter Envoys** [通章使者], the **Heavenly Seal-Bearers** [掌印天丁], the **Wind Lord and Rain Teacher** [风伯雨师], and the **Saintly Assembly of the Thunder Department** [雷部圣众].

I have been graced by the **Great Transformation** [大化], receiving the **unique blessings** [殊恩] of the **Dao/Way**. I now bear the **scriptures of the Dao/Way** [法箓], ascending to the **immortal stages** [仙阶]. Today, I walk the **Heavenly Round** [建天圆], standing at the **Earthly Blockhouse** [地户]. With utmost sincerity, I convey my devotion to the **Celestial Sovereign** [神霄].

I possess the **immortal precious Seal** [仙宝玉印], and according to the **science** [科], I now consecrate and bow. I humbly pray that the **true saints and immortals** [真仙众圣] take pity on my sincerity and bestow **immortal virtue/power** [仙真道炁], infusing it into the **precious Seal** [宝印]. May all **talismans and scriptures** [飞符走箓] be granted to execute this command.

Those who defy the **Dao/Way** [不顺道者], upon seeing the Seal, shall turn to dust.

Next, I hope that after my consecration, all my sins may be absolved, and I may be granted **original pardon** [原赦], achieving **serenity of body and mind** [身心泰定], **harmony within my spiritual realm** [神宇和平], and **prosperity in all endeavors** [所向利亨].

I earnestly pray for **spiritual response** [灵应], as if my petitions were granted. I am deeply indebted to the **Dao/Way’s boundless grace** [罔极之恩].

I now solemnly present my **verbal pledge** [口章] and bow to the **Jade Palace** [玉府]. I, [臣某], am sincerely fearful and trembling, bowing repeatedly in reverence and awe.

I now humbly conclude. Next, light incense with a **red Seal** [朱印], imprinting it seven times and swallowing it. According to the **Dharma**, perform three consecrations to purify **impure, unclean, and turbid places** [忌秽浊处], and the Seal shall fly and move on its own.

On the day the **merit is fulfilled** [功满], wear the Seal and ride the **Phoenix Chariot** [凤车], ascending to the **Celestial Sovereign’s court** [神霄上朝].

It is most auspicious to keep this **Seal secret** [大宜秘之].

This Seal, made of **gold** [金], governs the **divine spirits of the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths** [九天九地神祇], the **Jade Palace** [玉府], and the **dragons of the Four Seas and Three Rivers** [四海三江水曹龙神]. Using this Seal to command, none shall escape its influence.

It cures **all ten thousand diseases** [万病]. Swallowing it shall bring immediate recovery.

This Seal, made of **jujube wood** [枣木] or **gold** [金], with **cinnabar** [丹砂] applied to the imprint. When used in **Heavenly affairs** [天上], it aligns with the **true essence** [真契], able to reach the **Ninth Heaven** [玉九], and not fall back down.

All **divine spirits** [万神] can be summoned through this Seal, using **cinnabar** [丹砂] to empower it.

This Seal, made of **gold and jade** [金玉], or carved from **jujube wood** [枣木] and imprinted with **cinnabar** [丹砂], is the **inscription of the Eightfold Awe** [八威毒蛇之篆], governing the **Thunder Spirits of the Jade Palace** [玉府雷神] and petitioning the **Two Marshes** [两泽].

Burning or incinerating it shall subdue **evil spirits** [邪鬼], and striking it shall slay **water demons** [水怪]. Cast the Seal in **yellow silk** [黄纱] into the water to destroy **monstrous beings** [怪], banish **plagues** [瘟疫], and subdue **demonic spawn** [鬼胎].

Use the Seal to **strike and summon the Wind and Heavenly Spirits** [惊风天吊], and imprinting it shall cure **all ten thousand diseases** [万病即瘥].」

「The ailments of **wandering tigers** [走虎], upon striking with this Seal, shall vanish instantly.

Once the **Thunder Department Seal** [雷部符] is applied, its efficacy is beyond measure.

This Seal, carved from **jujube wood struck by thunder** [雷震枣木], and imprinted with **cinnabar** [丹砂], commands **eight million divine soldiers** [神兵八百万], who follow the Seal to drive away plagues and slay evil spirits.

During great epidemics, deploy the **Sorting Gate Seal** [排门印] to prevent the plague from entering homes. Those who swallow the Seal shall sweat and be spared from infecting others.

When **malevolent spirits** [邪怪] torment people and defy the **Dao** [法], arrange the Seal on all four sides of the altar, facing its own direction, and set it ablaze. The spirit shall then perish in form.

Change the Seal as needed when performing rituals.

This Seal, carved from **jujube wood struck by thunder** [雷震枣木], shall be used according to the situation.

For all urgent matters, imprint with the Seal—its designated **spirit** [所司] shall act swiftly without delay. To seize spirits and pursue demons, the Seal shall arrive instantly.

When wielding the Seal, **all divine spirits** [万神] shall guard in attendance, never daring to leave the altar.

**Offering the Seal and drawing upon the Dao/Way’s qi** [取炁咒], **imprinting the hour** [掐辰], and **inscribing longevity at the Southern Pole** [南极长生] shall dissolve calamities and bring life.

When the **Three Officials** [三台] have been subdued, **all virtues/powers** [万善] shall be attained.

For urgent matters, as the **Highest Sovereign of the Celestial Palace** [高上神霄玉清真王] decrees: **Swiftly, like the lofty Celestial Palace!**

**Unsealing and invoking the Seal’s power**:
O **Highest Sovereign of the Celestial Palace** [神霄上帝], grant this Seal its **spiritual efficacy** [通灵].
May **Lord Han** [韩君] descend with blessings—no wish shall remain unfulfilled.
Let **malevolent spirits** [邪妖] return to **orthodoxy** [皈正], and the **Dao’s qi** [道炁] shall secretly cultivate.

Swiftly, like the **Highest Sovereign of the Celestial Palace** [高上神霄玉清真王] decrees!

With one strike of the **Divine qi** [神炁], **evil qi** [邪炁] shall cease.

Swiftly, like the decree!

**Together with the Celestial Palace’s Dao/Way’s Secret Formula**.

**Establishing the Celestial Prison Law**:
The law states: For those who treat **strong demons** [强鬼], **malevolent spirits and monsters** [妖魅魍魉], or **unorthodox deities** [不正之神], if they are given talismans and commands by law yet refuse to depart, then one must **fully report** to the **Three Heavens** [三天] and the **Celestial Palace’s Imperial Preceptor** [神霄帝师], submit to **Eastern Yüeh’s judgment** [关申东岳府], and **notify the local city gods** [所属城隍]. Request **heavenly soldiers** [将兵] to arrest and interrogate, establishing the **Celestial Prison** [天狱] and executing the guilty.

**True Talismans of the Thirty-Six Heavenly Prisons of the Celestial Highness**
**The Celestial Highness True King declares:**
Behind my palace lies the **Yùlíng Void Realm**,
Where the **Thirty-Six Heavenly Prisons** are arrayed.
I command the **Central Yellow Emperor** to govern all prisons,
Thus bringing them under heavenly jurisdiction.
These **True Talismans of the Heavenly Prisons** are formed from the **six yang qi of the Ninefold Highness—pure, refined, and luminous**,
Naturally coalescing into authentic talismans.
Mere mortals, shaped by the womb and born of filth,
Their impure qi not yet dispelled,
Their bodies not yet perfected in truth,
Cannot summon the heavenly qi.
But if one practices the **Dao of Highest Clarity**,
Then the **three realms’** evil demons and rebellious spirits shall assail the true gods,
Disturbing the heart,
Stirring up chaotic thoughts,
And summoning ten thousand evils to harass.
Thus, beyond the **Six Heavens**,
When the **auspicious cycle converges**,
The **Dao transformation shall be enacted**,
And the **True Talismans** shall gradually reveal themselves.
Those who receive them
Shall be able to subdue evil demons,
Sever evil desires,
And ensure the **Three Palaces** remain tranquil,
With the **Ninefold Qi** guarding the form.
If one violates these precepts,
The guilt shall not be absolved.
**As the Highest Clarity True King of the Celestial Highness decrees.**

**Method:**
Each prison has one **Supervising Official of the Prison**,
And within the prison, **one hundred and twenty spirits, true officers, and attendants**.
The **Heavenly Prison Officials, soldiers, and scribes**
Shall hold these talismans,
Drive and bind evil spirits,
And with solemn hearts and fasting,
Inscribe the **True Talismans** in cinnabar seals,
Using them at will to summon and compel.
For all talisman-holding,
Only one **Heavenly Prison Talisman** is required;
It is not necessary to use all of them.

**Method:**
For stubborn and malevolent spirits that refuse to be pacified,
Establish the **Thirty-Six Heavenly Prisons**,
And transform your body into that of the **True King**.
Pinch the **Shēn** finger,
Visualize the vastness of the Heavenly Prisons,
The Heavenly Soldiers on either side,
The thunderous formations encircling,
And the **True King** standing with sword in hand.
The **Supervising Officials, true scribes, and attendants** shall be stern and resolute.
The **Divine Edict** must be strictly observed,
And the malevolent shall be captured and revealed.
The **True King’s** command shall be fulfilled,
And the evil traces shall be clearly manifested within the prison.

**Investigation and Examination:**
For those who practice the **Dao**,
When entering or exiting a household,
If malevolent spirits or evil entities harass the practitioner,
First cleanse the resting place,
Making it pure and spotless.
Then, erect a **monochrome prison formation**,
And upon it, offer the **Generals, scribes, and soldiers**.
Raise a **black banner** at the center of the formation.
Summon the generals to capture the evil spirits,
Who shall then reveal their true forms here.

**True Talismans of the Heavenly Prisons of the Highest Sovereign**
**True Talismans of the Flying Divine, Flowing Light, and Supreme Vermilion**
This talisman shall summon the **Heavenly Prison Masters of the Ninefold Highness**.
**The Celestial Highness True King declares:**
All who practice the **Dao of the Celestial Highness**

**Celestial Constellation Jade Purity Five Thunder Secret Method**
When people suffer harm from malevolent ghosts, spirits, or demons, and cannot drive them away, the method requires sincere devotion, fasting, bathing, and wearing ritual robes within the ritual precinct. Offer incense and declare to the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Thunder Sovereign.

Then, establish the altar to sacrifice to the Thunder God, and devoutly pray. Step through the *Dou* formation, pinch the Five Thunder seals, close the eyes, and visualize the Four Peach Dragon Kings’ troops emerging with the Thunder God. Spit water and recite the secret, shouting angrily: *"Thunder God, swiftly go and exterminate!"*
Imagine the deity departing ten thousand *li* away. In a moment, the wind will return—this is the return.
That night, offer sacrifices to thank them.

**Thunderfire Marshal, Liu Zhong.**

**Secret Method for Invoking Rain at the Divine Storehouse**

For invoking rain, when erecting the altar, one must not allow monks, nuns, women, filial sons, impure persons, or those involved in slaughter to wander about. The laborers who build the altar should ideally be fed plain vegetarian meals.

If one desires a swift and resonant response, the local magistrate must be instructed to prohibit the tolling of bells, beating of drums, or playing of cymbals within the city walls.

After three days, the rain will descend immediately.

Additionally, when issuing the talisman at midnight, one must offer money, horses, wine, and fruit to appease the Thunder **Deity** and express the intent of the invocation.

**Opening the Celestial Gate**

When performing this ritual, the Daoist master must wear black garments, let his hair hang loose, carry a black banner on his shoulder, and hold a mouthful of pure water. Facing northeast, he spits once and shouts aloud, reciting the *Opening the Celestial Gate* incantation:

*"Ten thousand deities aid the clouds,
Heavenly officials lend their power.
Ghosts traverse rivers and lakes—
Guard the sun for my sake.
Three Marshals exchange their stations,
All deities rush forth in haste.
Heaven and Earth tremble,
Sun and Moon falter and decline.
Meteors drive back the throng,
Demons reveal their true forms.
My words pierce the day,
Swiftly done as the **Supreme Sovereign’s** decree."*

**Right:** Using the left hand to form the *Hai* seal, recite seven times. Then shake and sway the black banner toward the Celestial Gate. Stand with sword’s tip drawn to the ground, and spray the area seven times with wine.

Next, form the *Sealing the Celestial Gate* mudra, and blow upward toward the Celestial Gate with a single breath. Afterward, recite the *Opening the Celestial Gate* incantation.

For summoning wind and rain, each may be invoked seven times.

**Examples of Responsive Rainfall**

Spring thunder arises in the **Leopard’s Court** (寅) and **Tiger’s Court** (卯) of the Central Palace.
Summer thunder strikes in the **Shocking Court** (震) and **Windward Court** (巽) between the **Snake’s Court** (巳) and **Horse’s Court** (午).

In autumn, thunder returns to the **Elemental Court** (申) and **Rooster’s Court** (酉) of its original station.
In winter, it ascends from the **Dog’s Court** (亥) to the **Rat’s Court** (子) at the cycle’s end.

In all four seasons, clouds gather and rain falls—
At **Dragon’s Court** (辰), **Dog’s Court** (戌), **Ox’s Court** (丑), and **Sheep’s Court** (未), the **Heavenly Barrier** opens.

This is the incantation, also used to dispatch the luminaries of the dawn.

**Ritual of Refining and Liberating the Soul**

**Fire-Refinement Method:**
Use eighteen *zhuózi* tablets, arranged in a single row.
On each tablet, place a censer with blazing fire and burning incense.
Refine from the crown to the vital-symbol—eighteen stages.
Recite the *Yùqīng* incantation, chanting the appropriate spell for each stage, burning it in the censer’s flames.

**Water-Refinement Method:**
Use a pool of water, nine inches or nine feet in dimension—always a multiple of nine. Constructed of metal, stone, wood, or brick.
Pour nine measures of water, placing censers at each corner with blazing fire and incense, shrouding the pool in mist.
The ritual master intones the invocation, casting the *liánshēnfú* (body-refinement talisman) into the water, commanding the officiant to perceive the soul of the deceased.
If unseen, repeat with the *cuī* (urgent) incantation.
If the soul does not manifest human form—or appears as a beast—return to fire-refinement.
If human form is achieved, proceed with the ritual rites, crossing the Daoist bridge to the Birth-Heaven platform.
Adapt as needed.

**Supreme Yellow Register True Talisman for Extending Life:**

*"Now, according to native records, the Daoist disciple [name omitted] sincerely pledges, petitioning for the extension of my original life-force, [name omitted].
Reporting to the Northern Dipper Star Sovereign [blank], who oversees my fate:
Since birth until today, amidst familial and worldly affairs, who has escaped fault?
The Three Activities, Six Senses—who is without offense?
Humbly hearing the Most High’s *Yǎnmián Zhēn* (True Alliance) scriptures, the true path to cultivation, I have devotedly surrendered to the Dao, wishing to transmit this sacred decree to the world, preserving life through practice.
Should my body perish, rely solely on this liberation.
As the scriptures state:
In the Jade-Purity Sacred Realm, the Great Luo Primordial Celestial Sovereign, formerly in the Fragrant Grove Garden, within the Great Blessing Hall, addressed the celestial saints of the Three Realms and their overseers, expounding on the causes of birth and death.
At that time, the Saving-Suffering True Person ascended and reported to the Celestial Sovereign:
‘I witness within the Nine Abyssal Hells and the Northern Torture Bureau that the Ten-Directional Saving-Suffering Celestial Sovereigns enter the Nine Abysses, liberating all suffering souls.’"*

The Celestial Sovereign universally proclaimed to the Four Assemblies:

*"If you can receive and uphold the Golden Talisman of White Tablets, the Nine True Wondrous Precepts, the Long-Life Sacred Talismans, and the Saving-Suffering True Talismans, you shall dissolve the great sins of the Nine Abysses and register your name in the Nine Palaces.

The Fate-Inspecting Boy, the Precept-Protecting Mighty Spirit, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, and the Six Palaces’ Officials shall naturally follow the Tablets’ script, shielding those who receive the precepts.

Disciple [Name], having preemptively cultivated hidden blessings, according to the ritual established this Dao-field, setting up the Three Realms’ High Immortal Yellow Talisman Grand Rite, respectfully invites Degree-Master [Name] and Talisman-Master [Name] to transmit the Supreme Alliance True Yellow Talisman Sacred Decree of the First Stage.

May it be that, after receiving and upholding [this], you become the bridge for the world’s salvation, the vessel for past deliverance, protecting the body and preserving life, crossing calamities and dispelling disasters.

Do not neglect or belittle the sacred texts—obey and fulfill them as commanded.

The Celestial Sovereign declared:

1. **Diligence**—be loyal to sovereign and ruler.
2. **Respect and Humility**—honor and nourish one’s parents.
3. **Non-Killing**—compassionately rescue all beings.
4. **Chastity**—rectify one’s conduct and interactions.
5. **Non-Theft**—extend virtue and diminish self.
6. **Non-Wrath**—avoid violent anger toward others.
7. **Non-Deceit**—reject flattery and harm to the virtuous.
8. **Non-Arrogance**—do not scorn the True Ones.
9. **Single Devotion**—do not serve two masters.

These precepts are all spoken by the Primordial Celestial Sovereign’s Golden Mouth; upholding them with sincerity yields boundless merit. Their power to save difficulties and relieve suffering is beyond reckoning.

Humbly obeying the command, we adhere and fulfill [them].

**The Divine King Speaks:**
Worthy scholars in the world must believe in the Dao, revere the Heavenly Will, and harmonize with the spirits.
Devote to loyalty and filial piety, commit no evil, and cultivate the great root of virtue.
All actions should aid in liberating all beings.
Without relying on precepts and vows, how can one uphold the path?

In ancient times, the Ancestor of Yang, the Great Red High Wall of the *Tai Ji*, the Purple Clarity Palace’s True Primordial Divine Treasure of Great Compassion, transmitted to me the supreme Dao and instructed those who seek transcendence.
The Dao’s foundation is gradual; precepts come first.
Precious standards and refined laws—secret scriptures of the Purple Palace—list the Seven Grades of Precepts and classify the Nine Levels of Scripture.
Thus, the *Yun* seals and double *Luo* talismans, the jade seals and flower-bound registers,
The wise platform and jade gate—nine tiers of celestial realms—illuminate all hidden things, liberating all without exception.

Precepts begin at the initial stage, restraining desires and suppressing transgressions, gradually ascending to sainthood.
Now, those who earnestly study must follow the law’s procedures, facing the sacred presence.
As those entrusted with the Dao’s duties, first proclaim the Nine Precepts of the Nine Constellations and Nine Celestial Exaltations to clarify the merit of the ritual.
All officials must sincerely repent and listen attentively.

**The Wisdom Praise:**

1. **The Divine Highest of the Nine Constellations, Eternal Heavenly Long-Life, and Supreme Virtue** proclaims the **Precept Against Demons**.
   Reflect on the Mysterious Sovereign’s wondrous Dao, giving birth to the Two Principles.
   The Three Constellations’ primordial function creates all things.
   Divine spirits and transcendent sages assist in generation.
   Do not be deceived by the silence of barbarians or the emptiness of the void.
   Do not arrogantly exalt yourself, lest you fall into demonic realms.
   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of flying ascent.

2. **The Dao-Master of the Dan Constellation, the Peaceful and Transformative Sovereign** proclaims the **Precept Against Evil**.
   Reflect on emperors and kings receiving talismans to govern the people.
   The Dao transforms the ten directions, and benevolence nurtures the four seas.
   Do not trust in deceit or harbor malicious intent.
   Do not indulge in licentiousness or deceit, lest you fall into evil destinies.
   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of wealth and nobility.

3. **The Elemental True Treasure of the Qing Constellation, the Good-Generating Sovereign** proclaims the **Precept of Nurturing Nature**.
   Reflect on the toil and nurturing love of parents.

   Reflect that all beings share the primordial black essence.
   Through karma and conditions, they manifest diverse forms.
   Do not indulge in desires for tastes, nor commit harm.
   Nor rely on arrogance to oppress the lowly.
   Harbor no malicious intent, lest you be bound in cyclic suffering.
   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of wisdom.

6. **The Flowing Light, Pure Radiance Sovereign of the Tai Constellation** proclaims the **Precept of Calm Reflection**.
   Reflect that chasing honor and luxury harms life and nature.
   Lust and depravity corrupt the vital essence and disrupt authenticity.
   Worldly laws cannot tolerate this, and retribution is severe.
   Fleeting illusions offer no escape—eternally without release.
   Obsessive thoughts ensnare; one falls into torment.
   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of purity.

7. **The Universal Aid Sovereign of the Lang Constellation, the Flying Green Primordial Key** proclaims the **Precept of Caution**.
   Reflect that all beings strive with wisdom.
   Do not assume ignorance justifies hatred or jealousy.

---

8. **The Double Splendor Sovereign of the Purple Constellation** proclaims the **Precept of Guarding and Protecting**.
   Reflect that the **Thunderous Deity** guards and protects with awe-inspiring radiance.
   If entering a **Treasure Mountain**, one must concentrate the mind and remain unmoved.
   Do not assume that those of different **Dao/Way** are unworthy of association or shared dwelling.
   Interfering with **evil paths** leads to **slackening and retreat**.
   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of **steadfastness**.

9. **The Most Wondrous Void Sovereign of the Central Constellation** proclaims the **Precept of Benefiting Others**.
   Reflect that within the **dusty world**, all beings—**sentient life**—receive retribution according to their deeds, enduring manifold **sufferings**.
   Thus, one must arouse the **Great Compassion and Mercy**, employing **skillful means** to rescue and liberate them.
   Even for minor kindnesses, one must accumulate them diligently, avoiding **procrastination** or **indulgence in neglect**.
   Those who uphold this precept attain the fruit of **fulfilling the True Primordial Essence**.

The **True King** declares:
From the **Nine Precepts of the Great Primordial** above, if one can **begin and end** by upholding them, **never slackening** throughout life, **internalizing** the suppression of **demons and bewitchments**, and **externalizing** the gathering of **True Spirits**, while **observing strict fasts** and **purifying thoughts**, advancing in **superior Dao/Way**, then all **wicked and violent** forces shall be unable to approach.
One may **command the Six Ding** to **ward off** and **banish** all evils.
When the **merit is complete** and the **fruit is fulfilled**, one shall **ascend to immortality in broad daylight**.

How can one not uphold these precepts? How can one not strive?

**Daoists** observing **fasts** and **ritual conduct** must **report to the Sacred Pass** and **White Court**.
The **Superintendent of Rituals** and **Ceremonial Masters** shall **bow three times** before exiting, and do likewise upon returning.
Those who violate this shall be **reprimanded by the Master** and **punished without reprieve**.

**Procedures of the Jade Bureau**:
When commoners submit petitions to **exorcise maddening and malevolent spirits**, one must **investigate thoroughly**, ensuring the presence of **ghosts or bandits**.
After judging the petition, **offer incense** and **recite aloud** to the **Ancestral Master, Sect Master, and True Master**, requesting them to **announce to the Divine Bureau Officials and Soldiers**, awaiting their deployment.

Upon completion, **write a decree** and dispatch **the Left and Right Grand Generals and their troops of ten thousand** to the afflicted household first. They shall **encircle the dwelling** and send **two divine talismans**.
The **Generals** shall command the **Gods of Destiny** to **urgently seize the malevolent ghosts and bandits** within the petitioner’s body, **forbidding them to flee**, and await further orders.

If the malevolent person is outside, **immediately convene the local community** and **urgently press them into the household**.
The **Exorcist** shall summon the **Divine Generals and troops** to return the petitioner home, preparing **incense and offerings**.
Upon arriving at the afflicted household, the **Exorcist** shall **recite the Six Ding Talisman**—the **Master’s Talisman**—and **assign the petitioner as the Chief General of the Current Bureau** to capture the malevolent spirits.
Then, **burn one talisman**, leading the **Divine Soldiers and Officials** in a **ten-thousand-strong army**, with **drums and gongs** resounding, **encircling the afflicted** from all four directions, **binding above and below** the malevolent ghosts.
With **步禹步 (Bu Yu Bu)**, proceed to the afflicted’s residence, **directly to the Heavenly Gate**.
Recite the **Heavenly Ding Talisman**; the **petitioner** shall be a **Heavenly Ding Warrior**.
Upon sighting the malevolent person, **recite the Combat Talisman**, the **Thunderfire Talisman**, and **burn the Lightning Talisman** to **seize malevolent spirits**, directing the flames to the doorstep.
Again with **步禹步 (Bu Yu Bu)**, enter with the **left hand reciting the Talismans of the Tiger, Rabbit, and Horse Hours**, and the **right hand reciting the Combat Talisman**.
Assign the **two Combat Talismans** to the head, with the **□罡星 (Gang Star)** pointing forward.
At the hall, the **Exorcist** stands **back to the □ (Gui), facing the Gang Star**, **offers incense**, and commands the **Divine Generals and Soldiers** to **urgently seize and bind the malevolent spirits**, awaiting their response.
Then, **order them to be carried out** and apply the **Heavenly Ding Talisman** to **bind the malevolent spirits**, along with the **Divine Warriors and Talismans** previously summoned.
At first sight of the afflicted, the **left hand recites the Heavenly Ding Binding Talisman**, and the **right hand recites the Combat Talisman**, using the **left hand’s Talisman to strike the lower ribs**.
The **left fist** becomes the **Gang Star**, the **right elbow** the **□ (Gui) Star**, the **left shoulder** the **□ (Gui)**, the **heart** the **□ (Gui)**, the **right shoulder** the **□ (Gui)**, the **right elbow** the **□ (Gui)**, and the **right fist** the **□ (Gui) Star**.
When the **stars’ radiance** fills the chest, the **left hand recites the Chenwen Talisman**, and the **Exorcist** shouts:
*"You are what malevolent spirit that harms the King’s subjects?*
*I am commissioned by the **Supreme Emperor**, here to **investigate you**—speak truly, or I shall **proceed with interrogation**!"*

After issuing commands, **quickly bind** the **right fist and left elbow** with the **Heavenly Ding Talisman** for **urgent interrogation**.
If they still do not confess, **bind them with the Heavenly Ding Seal** and **pierce their mouth** with the **Golden Staff**.
If they still refuse, **shackle them** and **recite the Thunderfire Lightning Talisman**—they shall **speak immediately**.
After **three thorough interrogations**, if the truth is confirmed, **order the Divine Generals to seize the ghosts and bandits**, and **immediately grant relief** to the afflicted, giving them the **talisman to swallow**.
**Offer incense daily**, and the **Divine Generals** shall **quickly deliver the malevolent spirits** for **final disposition** and **return them to their proper domain**.

**Seizing Wicked and Malevolent Ghosts**:
If there are **wicked and malevolent ghosts**, with petitions submitted and **repeated exorcisms failing**, record the **circumstances** in the petition and **dispatch to the Supreme Emperor, the Three Masters, and the Five Peaks**, notifying the **City Deities** or visiting **nearby sacred shrines**. On a **fixed day**, convene and proceed to the afflicted household, **seizing and executing the ghosts and bandits**, establishing an **instant tribunal** for judgment and dispatch.

On the appointed day, at dawn, summon the **Eight-Directional Pursuit Generals**—**Yang Shun** as the **Vanguard General**—and **issue the talisman** to **cross the dry and wet** and **fly to Heaven** to request troops.
Then, **one by one**, dispatch the **Divine Generals and Officials** of the **Current Bureau**, following the same method as before.
Upon entering, the **left hand recites the Talisman of Malevolent Spirits**, and the **right hand recites the Combat Talisman**, binding the malevolent spirits as previously described.
With **步地纪斗 (Bu Di Ji Dou)**, proceed directly to the hall, **back to Gui, facing Gang**, and **shout** to summon the **Divine Soldiers and Officials** of the **Current Bureau**, **urgently leading troops** to **supervise and bind** the afflicted household, the **Five Paths of Earth**, and related deities.
All shall be **seized and delivered immediately** to the **tribunal** for judgment.
The **Current Bureau** establishes the tribunal, **interrogates and commands** as decided, **reciting the two Talismans**, **grasping the malevolent Seal**, and **reciting the Yin Combat Talisman**.

The officers and soldiers stand arrayed to the left and right.

Seize the malevolent spirits and hold them fast—like a calamity, they shall make no sound or movement.
Once captured, immediately apply the **shackling cangue Seal** upon them, then burn the **Responsive Cangue Ghost-Soldier Talisman**. Next, pinch the **Ziwei Seal**, arrange the **Hexagram of Heaven (乾)** and deploy the **Combat Array**. Shout aloud while reciting the **Ziwei Incantation to the Heavenly and Earthly Spirits**, commanding them to be bound.
If they remain unsubdued, then summon the **Golden Blade Spirit Official** to subdue them, grasp the **Heavenly Ding Seal**, and recite the **Heavenly Ding Incantation**, invoking the **Ten Directions’ Heavenly Ding Warriors** to bind them in the air.
If no form or shadow appears, swallow the **Healing Talisman**, then press the **Subduing Evil Talisman** upon them—this is infallible.

**Demolishing the Malevolent Shrine**
When a petitioner reports that an unauthorized shrine or a haunted grove, tree, or spirit frequently disturbs the land, bewitching women, invading fields and homes, and falsely demanding sacrifices, the case must be meticulously documented and submitted for judgment. Request that the **Current Bureau’s soldiers**, the **Ten Directions’ Heavenly Ding Warriors**, and the relevant **Sacrificial Deities** assemble to suppress the disturbance.

On the appointed morning, inscribe the **Subduing Evil Talisman** on four wooden plaques, each seven *cun* long and three *cun* wide. After offering incense, arrange the **Hexagram of Heaven (乾)** and deploy the **Combat Array**, then fly as a spirit to petition above for the cause of the calamity. Next, step through the **Earth-Memory Array** and dispatch the **commander** with attendants bearing the talismans to enter the shrine directly.

Recite the **Personal Destiny Incantation**—*Chen*—and summon the **Spirit Officials**, arraying them to the left. With the right hand, grasp the **Northern Emperor Seal-Incantation**, invoking the **Three Teachers** and the **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole**, leading the soldiers, **Heavenly Ding Warriors**, the **Six Jia and Six Ding**, and the **Crushing Demon Thunder Division** to follow in the clouds behind you.

Recite the incantation, then grasp the **Ziwei Seal**, mentally invoking the **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole**, the **Three Enclosures**, and the **Northern Dipper’s Natural Covering Head**. Again, deploy the **Flying Combat Array**, invoking the **Seven Stars in Crossed Array** to envelop the shrine’s form.

Proceed to the shrine’s entrance, fly through the **Heavenly Gang**, step through the **Earth-Memory Array**, and command the **Supervising Officials** to shout each name in turn. The aforementioned soldiers and generals must urgently seize them all under your command.

Burn the **Commanding Demon-Scout Ghost Talisman**, declaring: *"These are demonic bandits—command them seized!"* Deploy the **Thunderfire Talisman**, burning it thoroughly. The **Teacher** invokes lightning—**crackling thunder shakes the earth**, flames fill the sky, and the officials raise their voices in triumph as they seize them.

Next, nail the **Iron Talisman** into the four cardinal directions of the shrine’s grounds, reciting the **Heavenly Gate and Earthly Axis Incantation**, invoking the **Four Directions’ successive movements**—thus, the demons have no place to enter. Reward the officials and soldiers—this method is supremely effective.
Do not use it habitually.

**Method for Invoking Rain in the Height of Summer**

A private chamber must be prepared, swept clean and made pure. Twelve measures of wine, one rooster, and offerings to the **Suppressing Demon** division’s middle-ranking generals are required.

With sword in hand, face the **Xun** direction. Draw a three-tiered altar, upon which are placed wine cups, incense lamps, and tea and fruit. In ritual formation, step toward the **Xun** door and assume the guise of a **Divine General**, sword pointing to the **Xun** direction, and loudly declare:

*"By the command of the Supreme Emperor, I urgently suppress the **Demon Division**. I call each name in turn and summon the **Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder** messengers. On this month’s certain day, they must swiftly assist me in searching through streams and abyssal pools. Surely there are **Dragon Gods** present—hurry to [specific location], and save all the people from scorching drought!"*

*"Now, in accordance with the law, I have prepared blood wine and **zào money** to reward the **Thunder Division**. On the appointed day and hour, you must govern the great rain—do not defy my command!"*

When the incantation is finished, pour out the wine, and with the sword’s blade pierce the rooster, mixing its blood into the wine until it is evenly blended. The **Thunder Division** generals of the Five Directions will then appear before the altar to receive the sacrifice.

After the ritual is complete, dig a pit facing the **Xun** direction within the chamber, and bury the **zào money** and rooster’s blood wine. Place the sword upright upon it, then exit the chamber. As prescribed, prepare the **Rain-Invoking Talisman** and have someone cast it into the location where the **Dragon Gods** dwell.

When the time arrives, great thunder and rain will descend, relieving the drought. Then, give thanks to Heaven’s grace.

**Praying for Clear Weather**

In general, the **Flying Xun** incantation can subdue **Sky Gods**, while the **Treading Ji** incantation can subdue **Earthly Deities**. To govern the **Three Realms’** ghosts and gods, one must not neglect the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** methods—how else could one achieve great deeds and manifest **virtue/power**, if these were mere empty exertions of effort?

For calming **void-dwelling malevolent ghosts** or **frenzied winds and torrential rains**, and for traversing perilous seas or mountains in times of danger, these methods suffice.

If the **Subduing Frenzied Evil** method is employed, the left and right hands must be reversed and the steps retraced.

Next, use the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** incantations. With the right hand, point to the direction of the calamity, and the ghosts and gods will collapse, the clouds and rains will disperse, all **demons and malevolent forces** will be annihilated, and **prolonged rains** will not harm crops or people.

If a violent wind snaps trees, the ritual master must transform into a **Divine General** in **auspicious attire**, arrange the items in reverse order, and then recite the **Flying Xun** and **Treading Ji** incantations three times. With the right hand, point to the clouds and loudly declare:

*"By the command of the Supreme Emperor, I order the violent winds and torrential rains to cease immediately! You **Dragon Gods** who command the clouds, swiftly obey the imperial decree and disperse the clouds, halting the rain!"*

The winds and rains will then stop. If they do not, repeat the method, using the **Binding Dragon Spirit Official** to subdue them—this is supremely effective.

Next, petition the **Supreme Emperor’s Three Teachers**, and inform the **Dragon God Master of Rain** to swiftly forbid the rain. Set the **Altar of Transmission and Oath** in proper order:

*"This humble servant of [specific village], holding the office of [specific position], surnamed [surname], aged [number], born in the year [year]. I am under the jurisdiction of the **Big Dipper’s** [specific star] Lord. Deeply moved by the insignificant merits of this humble one, I reverently admire the **Dao/Way’s** transformations. With sincere devotion, I humbly present this pledge of sincerity, proffering it to the door of [surname] Lord. I seek to beg for the transmission of the **Highest Celestial’s** **Divine Constellation’s** **Long-Life**, **Protect-Life**, **Guardian of Immortality’s** secret method—one **school’s** talismans, diagrams, seals, and incantations. I vow to assist Heaven in its transformations, aid the state in saving its people, preserve my life and cultivate **authentic virtue**, and cut off evil to return to the right path."*

*"After receiving this method, it shall forever be a treasure of my body. I dare not disobey the Teacher’s words or recklessly transmit this to others, nor leak the sacred texts. Should I violate this even once, I shall willingly offer my body to the **Three Officials**, be tried by the **Wind Blade**, and bring misfortune upon the **Mysterious Ancestors**. I will not be pardoned in ten thousand kalpas, nor dare I blame the **Dao/Way** or accuse the Teacher."*

*"I have solemnly presented this petition, awaiting the Teacher’s compassionate grace to grant me the opportunity to prostrate and plead. I humbly await the Teacher’s command."*

*"This humble servant, [surname], now holding the office of [specific position], has submitted the above petition in accordance with the ritual. Since it has been seen and the oath is most earnest, I dare not refuse. I humbly present this petition, offering it to the **Supreme Emperor’s** **Highest Celestial’s** **Jade Purity True King of Divine Constellation’s** **Great Emperor of Long-Life** before the altar. I await the grace to issue a decree, informing the **True Officials of the Purple Bureau** to verify the above and transmit the method to the disciple. Should I or the disciple have any offenses, grant or withhold transmission as appropriate. I pray for the Emperor’s benevolent decree to be revealed to me in dreams or waking, so that I may rely upon it to perform the transmission."*

*"I am sincerely fearful and trembling, bowing my head and kneeling. I have solemnly presented this petition, awaiting the imperial decree."*

「The **Grand Marshal of the Year** (太歲), in the month and day of his position, humbly submits this memorial (具位臣姓某狀奏).

The newly appointed **transmission site** (授法址) is hereby called by imperial decree (勑) to the **Three Celestial Purities’** **Heavenly Gate** (三天門下). According to the petition of **Official Certain** (某官某人), I respectfully recommend **Person Certain** (某人), whose innate nature is pure and unadulterated, and whose resolve is steadfast and true. He reverently upholds the **Highest Celestial** (高真), and constantly takes refuge in the **Great Dao** (大道). He possesses a sincere heart for benefiting the nation and saving the people, and wishes to transmit the **Supreme Emperor’s** **Jade Purity True King of Divine Constellation’s** **Highest Celestial’s** **Preserved Immortal Secret Dao** (保仙秘法), safeguarding life and protecting the body, aiding the Celestial in its transformations, exterminating malevolent spirits (邪祟), and bringing relief to the people. I was born in the year of **Jia (甲) and Xian (建)**, and my fate is governed by the **Certain Star Lord of the Northern Dipper** (北斗某星君), awaiting his manifest response.

The **Recommending Master** (保舉師) submits this memorial: **Official Certain** (臣姓某).
The **Supervising Master** (監度師) submits this memorial: **Official Certain** (臣姓某).
The **Transmitting Master** (度師) submits this memorial: **Official Certain** (臣姓某).

The **Supreme Celestial Dao** (神霄大法) is the refuge of all ten thousand Dao paths (萬道同皈). How much easier is its practice than the difficulty of cultivating sincerity in one’s heart! It is fitting to appoint **Person Certain** as a **Celestial Purity’s Peace-Aiding Transformation Disciple** (太平辅化弟子), to practice the **Supreme Celestial Dao**, and to conduct the affairs of the **Right Hall Military Assembly and Scriptural Repository** (右殿軍同會書府事), following the prescribed procedures and reporting accordingly.

This decree (右牒) is issued by the **Three Pure Ones’ Jade Emperor** (奉三清玉帝), and the **Transmitting Master** (度師) submits this memorial: **Official Certain** (臣姓某).

After first reporting to the **Imperial Court** (帝阙) and then submitting to the **True Officials** (真司), in accordance with the **mysterious principles** (玄科), he receives the **transmitted essence** (奧旨) with the oversight of all the Celestial Deities (諸天監度), the verification of all the Saints (眾聖证明), the support of the **Divine Generals** (神將贊扶), and the protection of the **Celestial Bureaucracy** (吏兵翊衛). Thus, he is qualified to fulfill his duties and attain the **rank of immortality** (仙階). He may now kneel and receive his official title in accordance with the **certificate of appointment** (簡券).

All the **precept texts** (戒文) should be reverently accepted and upheld. They are listed as follows:

「Diligently cultivate and uphold the **precepts** (修持), laboring in the **sacred rites** (香火). Cherish the radiance of the Three Lights (味三光之焕景), and bear the talismans of the Six Heavenly Stems (佩六甲之符章). Safeguard life and protect the body, aiding Heaven and assisting the realm (佐天助国).

When calamities arise—whether locusts and caterpillars (螟蝗) wreak havoc, or floods and droughts (水旱) go unchecked—when malevolent spirits (精魅) act as demons (为妖), or when living beings suffer from sickness and woe (生灵疾苦), attend to all matters, great or small, and **exterminate demons and avert calamities** (按律诛禳) in accordance with the **Daoist laws** (律).

Do not **amass wealth** (殖货财), nor **favor flatterers** (私谄曲). Do not **betray trust** (勿背盟约), nor **leak sacred secrets** (泄慢枢机). May the **Dao** flourish in its practice (使教法以兴行), and may all beings turn toward faith (俾众生而向信). Heaven’s judgment is near—let this be your earnest admonition (天鉴不远，宜勉之).

Thus the decree (故牒).
**Great Year** (太岁) [of the] [Year] [Month] [Day] [Hour] [Decree] (年月日时牒).

**Recommended for promotion** (保举): Daoist Master [Name Redacted] (师具位), surname [Redacted] (姓某), seal [Redacted] (押).
**Overseen by the Daoist Patriarch** (监度): Daoist Master [Name Redacted] (师具位), surname [Redacted] (姓某), seal [Redacted] (押).

**Supplementary Note** (补帖):
To the **Office of the Supreme Daoist Court of the Jade Purity** (玉清神霄大法司):

The said office, in accordance with native records (乡贯), having presented **pledges and credentials** (赍质信) to the door of [Name Redacted] (某君), should now transmit the **Sacred Secrets of the Highest Daoist Rite** (高上神霄保仙秘法). Beyond those already reported to the Three Masters (三师), this further supplements the **Highest Daoist Rite of the Great Peace** (高上神霄太平辅化), where the disciple [Name Redacted] (弟子) practices the **Supreme Daoist Rite** (神霄大法) and holds the **post of Right-Side Hall Military and Scriptural Affairs** (右殿军同会书府事法职), requiring issuance of this **certificate for verification** (出帖照会).

This decree (右牒) is hereby entrusted to [Name Redacted] (某) for safekeeping (收执).

The **Sacred Daoist Texts of the Jade Purity** (神霄玉文) and the **Secrets of the Pure Court** (琼台秘诀) encompass all things without exception, their scope unbounded. If one cherishes these **Sacred Treasures** (自宝) and upholds them faithfully, then in **stillness** (坐众妙) one attains the myriad wonders, and **arising** (立至万神) one reaches the ten thousand deities. In **serene repose** (寂然不动), one’s **Dao-qi** (感) flows naturally and **harmonizes** (遂通).

How could one not **strive with sincerity** (勉励精诚) and **supplicate the True One** (上祈真贶) for blessings?

If one **procrastinates after initial diligence** (初勤终怠) or **speaks falsely while claiming otherwise** (口是心非), the **Spiritual Officials of the Dao** (法中灵官) will record their **merits and demerits** (功过) without fail, even to the minutest detail (毫分无失). Then shall the Five Emperors (五帝) **declare their deeds** (言功), and the Three Officials (三官) shall **not dare to register them in their ledgers** (鼓笔).

Let there be no **grievance against the Master’s words** (无怨师言)—this is most earnestly admonished (切宜勉之).

Conform to this decree and carry it out accordingly (准此奉行).」

**Humble Petition**

In the year of the **Tai Sui**, on the **month** and **day**, a disciple of the Dao from [location], humble surname **[name]**, submits this petition for rain.

Your disciple, **[name]**, in deepest reverence, has heard that the **Dao** originates from **nature itself**, and its teachings unfold through **skillful means**. All who make devout supplications shall surely be answered.

According to the transmitted words of the local disciples, since **[specific time]** of this year, the **excessive yang** has wreaked havoc, and the rains have failed to arrive on time. Crops wither and dry, and the people live in dread. If this persists, next year’s harvest will fail, leaving us without sustenance. Even worse, we fear we shall be unable to meet the obligations of grain taxes. Without prayer and supplication, how can we hope for abundance?

This petition has been submitted to the local magistrate, who has ordered its implementation. Your disciple, having received this urgent plea, dare not refuse. Thus, in deepest humility, I record this petition and, risking my life, present it to the **Ancestral Teacher, the Jade Purity Emperor, and the Primordial Heavenly Venerable**.

With utmost reverence, I await **Heaven’s special decree**, that it may be issued to all concerned.

I pray that the **General of Thunder and Clouds Who Summons Rain**, the **Six Ding and Six Jia**, the **Five Thunder Marshals**, the **Thunder Department officials**, the **Wind Lord and Rain Master**, and the **Dragon Kings Who Walk the Rain**—all these assembled beings—be dispatched to the **rain-supplication altar** established by your disciple. May they unleash a **heavy downpour** to save the parched fields, that the crops may revive.

Your disciple has dared to transgress **Heaven’s authority**, deserving ten thousand deaths. In deepest terror and trembling, I prostrate myself, bowing my head to the ground, and humbly submit this petition, awaiting the **Dao’s decree**.

**Memorial:**

In the year of the **Celestial Stem**, on the **month** and **day**, your humble servant of rank **[Name]** submits this memorial.

**To the City Deity of [City] for Healing the Ill:**

From the **Jade Purity Supreme Clarity Great Law Bureau**,
To the **Office of the City Deity Governors of [Certain] Prefecture/State**.

Upon receiving the plea from **[Name of Petitioner]** to intervene in healing, after already issuing a **Heavenly Talisman** and **Sacred Water** to be ingested by the afflicted—with no effect yet observed—it is clear that this is a case of **malevolent spirits and rebellious demons**, requiring an official directive.

Upon receipt of this memorial, investigate the matter thoroughly and immediately summon **mighty officials and soldiers of the Dao’s might**, dispatching them to **[Name of Afflicted Family]**, to **subdue and expel the malevolent spirits**, ensuring they depart from **[Name of Afflicted Family]’s domain**.

Should they fail to comply with this directive, they shall be **formally reported to the Supreme Master of the Jade Purity**, and **standard penalties enforced**, awaiting retribution.

Respectfully memorialized.
In the year of the **Celestial Stem**, on the **month** and **day**, memorial submitted.
**Rank and Name** affixed.

**Official Summons to the Demon-Suppressing Department:**

From the **Jade Purity Supreme Clarity Great Law Bureau**:

Upon receiving **[Name of Petitioner]’s** persistent plea—with no signs of recovery—it is evident that **malevolent, lawless spirits** from the lower realms have gathered, **demanding blood and sustenance**, defying the Dao’s laws, **cunning and deceitful**, falsely accusing the living, **occupying their homes**, and causing **imminent harm**. This requires immediate expulsion.

**This summons** is hereby issued to:
**The Great General of the Thunder Array, Golden Bell, and Flowing Fire**,
**The Great General of Thunderous Slaying and Punishment**,
**The Great General of Thunderfire**,
**The Great Generals Black Thunderous Roar and Black March**,
and all assembled forces—

**Urgent dispatch**: Lead your **valiant troops** forthwith to the afflicted household, **regardless of distance or precedence**, and **seize all malevolent, unjust spirits** within, driving them beyond this realm, far into other domains.

Further, **command the household’s Spirit of Destiny and guardian deities** to **remain vigilant**, offering steadfast protection, lest further calamity befall them.

Should there be any delay, **standard disciplinary measures will be enforced**.

Respectfully summoned.

I **present this petition** (*献投简文*), **reporting to the Supreme Dao** (*大道*), **Heaven and Earth** (*天地*), and **the恩 of my parents** who nurtured me, as well as the **enlightening恩 of the Three Celestial Luminaries** (*三光*), the **enlightening恩 of the Sovereign, Water, and Land** (*国王、水土*), and the **enlightening恩 of my teachers, friends, and guides** (*师友传度*).

I **offer this prayer** (*上祝*): May the **current sovereign** (*当今*), **live as long as Heaven and Earth** (*寿同天地*), and **permanently govern the mountains and rivers** (*永镇山河*).

**Further Petition:**

I **also wish** that the **Way** may **remove my nine ancestral sins** (*九祖之愆*) from the past and **forgive my three lifetimes’ offenses** (*三世之罪*) in the future.

I **fortuitously encounter the holy age** (*圣代*), and **aspire to emulate the true Dao** (*真风*). Though my **coarse mortal body** (*俗骨*) and **ordinary life** (*凡胎*) are burdened with **long-standing remorse** (*尤悔*), my **practice of the Dao remains shallow** (*道行闻浅*), and I **fail to grasp ultimate truth** (*至真*).

Unworthy to **penetrate mysteries and attain profound insight** (*通幽洞彻*), I **cannot accumulate merit to repay** (*积功图报*).

With reverence, I **hear of the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Marshes**, the **Heavenly Caverns of Blessed Lands** (*洞天福地*), and the **Purple Palace of True Capital** (*紫府真都*), the **sole abode where Immortals descend to bless** (*神仙降佑之乡*).

Thus, I, a **seeker of the Dao** (*学道祈求之士*), **humble myself before the True Spirit** (*真灵*), beseeching **gracious discernment** (*洞鉴*).

May You **pardon all my transgressions** (*过咎*) and **cleanse my sins** (*愆尤*).

Grant that my **Daoist rites and talismans** (*法箓*) may **sever evil** (*斩邪*), so that I may **return to the True Immortals** (*归正仙*).

With **martial assistance** (*兵佐助*) to **guide my path** (*随行*), I shall **cultivate the Dao and refine my essence** (*修真*), **transcending the mundane to attain sainthood** (*超凡入圣*).

I am **utterly moved and earnest** (*无任激切*), my **devotion unshaken** (*屏营之至*).

Respectfully spoken:

**The Celestial Year** (*太岁*) of **Year**, **Month** of **Month**, **Day** of **Day**,
**Possessed by the Dao** (*法位*), **Small Seal** (*小兆*), **Subject** (*臣*) **Certain** (*姓某*) **petitions** (*表奏*).

**Petition to the Holy Mother** (*奏圣母式*)
**Possessed by the Dao** (*法位*), **Small Seal** (*小兆*), **Subject** (*臣*) **Certain** (*姓某*).

I **do not fear the punishment of the executioner’s axe** (*斧越之诛*), and **dare to seek audience with the Supreme Primordial** (*重玄之听*).

「I, your humble servant, was yesterday instructed by **Reverend Master** (*度师*) **Certain** (*某君*) of the Inner Mongolia region in the **Jade Purity, Divine Dawn** (*玉清神霄*) **Great Dao** (*大法*), including the **One Stage God-General** (*一阶神将*) **talismans and seals** (*符印*), vowing to **assist the Celestial True One** (*天真*) in **propagating the orthodox transformation** (*宣扬正化*), **relieving the people’s suffering** (*救民疾苦*), **curing illnesses and banishing malevolent spirits** (*治病除邪*), and **refining both body and mind** (*修炼身心*), with the aspiration to **ascend to the Jade Bureau** (*升玉府*).

In reflection, your servant is a **filthy mortal in a degenerate age** (*浊世行尸*), of **profane essence** (*凡间秽质*), yet by **fate’s grace** (*宿运*), I was placed among humanity, and through **fortune’s blessing** (*真荃*), I received the **Great Dao** (*大法*). I **rely on the lofty immortals** (*高真*) to **bestow mercy upon the world** (*俯垂济世*).

Though my **virtue is slight and my Dao shallow** (*功微道浅*), my **power is meager and my conduct weak** (*德薄行衰*), I have **recklessly advanced to the Immortal Stage** (*滥进仙阶*), yet no **meritorious deeds** (*有功可记*) are recorded in my **actions and retreats** (*行藏*).

Thus, I have **offended in both motion and stillness** (*致犯动静成愆*), and **my mouth, hands, heart, and body have violated the Dao’s prohibitions** (*口掌心身有违科禁*). With **ten thousand faults and myriad sins** (*千愆万罪*), exposed to **both light and dark punishments** (*阳过阴诛*), I **daily tremble in fear with no means to repent** (*夙夜竞惶无门忏谢*).

Fortunately, on this **auspicious day** (*吉日*), I **offer morning rites to the Primordial Lord** (*朝礼元君*), earnestly **praying for compassionate aid** (*特希哀佑*) and **merciful enlightenment** (*愍以愚蒙*).

Your servant **respectfully records this petition** (*谨录状奏*) to **those who hear** (*闻者*).

**Rightfully, your servant respectfully records this petition** (*右臣谨录状上奏*) and **submits it to the Primordial Dao Ancestor, Holy Mother Primordial Lord** (*元始开天道祖圣母元君御前*), humbly **hoping that the Dao’s benevolence will grant my petition** (*伏望道慈允臣所奏*), and **praying for a vigorous command** (*乞赐劲命*) to **forgive and absolve me, your servant Certain** (*赦宥臣某*), **clearing my guilt and misfortune** (*罪冤消释*), **and allowing me to attain serene peace** (*得获清宁*). Thus, your servant may **devoutly seek the Dao through the law** (*奉法求真*) and **swiftly receive the numinous response** (*速蒙灵应*), **granting my sincere prayers immediate communion** (*允臣虔祷立获感通*).

**Ever indebted to the boundless Dao’s grace** (*仰荷大道罔极之恩*), your servant is **utterly moved and earnest** (*无任激切*), **devotion unshaken** (*屏营之至*). I **respectfully submit this** (*谨具以闻*).

**Respectfully submitted** (*谨奏*).
**The Celestial Year** (*太岁*) of **Year**, **Month** of **Month**, **Day** of **Day**,

Your servant **respectfully states that** (*臣谨据某*), yesterday on **Year, Month, Day** (*某年月日*), **I suffered from** (*得何病证*) **a certain illness** (*某病*), suddenly **assailed by mountain goblins and malevolent spirits** (*山魈鬼神*), causing me to **whirl in madness day and night** (*日夜颠狂*), **to act disorderly in speech and call out in chaos** (*作乱言语呼唤*), and **to invoke myriad evil spirits** (*口称邪祟不一*).

Though I **exhausted all means through priests, shamans, and medical treatments** (*累经师巫医药*), they **failed to subdue** (*制伏不下*) the affliction, and it remains **a stubborn and cunning malevolence** (*顽猾奸狡*).

I **still fear for my life** (*尚虑性命难存*) and **grieve for my kin** (*骨肉怀忧*), unable to **find cessation** (*得止*).

Thus, I **submit my case to you, my Lord** (*具状投臣*), **pleading for salvation and treatment** (*乞行救治*).

Your servant **sees the earnestness of the supplicant’s words** (*切见本人投词恳切*), **and dare not refuse** (*不敢抑绝*). Therefore, on **Month, Day** (*今月某日*), I **shall establish the Divine Dawn Water-Fire Tribunal** (*建置神霄水火狱*) at the **east-southeast corner of Certain’s home** (*某家东南方上*), **requesting the descent of the Three Offices and Five Thunder God-Generals** (*乞降三司五雷将吏*) to **the site’s entrance** (*诣地头*), **to apprehend the mountain goblins and malevolent spirits** (*收捉某身中为祸山魈等祟*) **that plague me** (*赴狱考治*), and **to rescue and aid the living** (*救济生人*).

**This shall be done upon your decree** (*须至奏闻者*).
