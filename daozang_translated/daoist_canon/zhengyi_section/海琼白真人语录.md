**Dialogues Between Master and Disciples #1**

On an autumn evening, as the stars hung low and the moon descended, mist rose and dew settled, with a thousand households shuttered and not a soul upon the road, the True Master Perfected White of Haiqiong, Peng Xiang of Crane Forest, and Liu Yuanchang of Purple Prime walked hand in hand through Pomegranate Blossom Grotto. In an instant, dawn broke, and they forgot to return, sitting atop the perilous coil of stone. The Master bade his two disciples sit to his left and right.

Turning to them, he said: "Between heaven and earth, what evening is this? The path to the Divine Empyrean is distant, and few tread the Purple Palace. You two have studied the immortal arts for long—have you no doubts to ask?"

The True Master said: "Laozi said: *There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.* How well this is put! Later generations call it the Dao, the mind, the nature, the spirit, the *qi*, the single thought, the Dharma, the teaching, the art, the sentiment. Alas! Branches diverge and schools multiply—do they yet know that *there is a thing, formless yet complete*?"

The True Master said: "The great creation makes no sound, yet the wind sighs and the pipes stir of themselves. Winter departs, and ice must float; spring arrives, and grasses grow of themselves. Swallows come with summer’s end, geese return with autumn’s fall; plum blossoms open in the frosty sky, fireflies glow in the moonlit night. This is simply the Way of nature. When you penetrate to this point, the mouth seeks words but speech fails, the mind seeks thought but reflection vanishes."

The True Master said: "The great creation acts not, and the primordial work governs nothing."

Someone asked: "How is this so?"

The Master said: "The nest knows the wind, the burrow knows the rain. Alas! What of man?"

The True Master said: "All the dharmas in the world, all the gates within the dharma—these are but formulas for compounding medicine, remedies for curing illness. Only when you know the decoction’s envoy does the medicine take effect."

Someone asked: "What is the decoction’s envoy?"
The Master replied: "The heart is the envoy of the dharma."

The True Master said: "One day, the generals and officers of the Thunder Department reported: 'Wherever an incense burner is set, there is the Jade Clarity Palace of Divine Empyrean.' Yuanchang asked: 'The scriptures speak of thirty-six hundred divine maidens ever at my side, and the sigh within says thirty-six thousand spirits dwell in my body. These incantations are all the words of the Most High—are they real? Illusory? True? False?'

The Master answered: "Within the human body dwell the Three Inner Treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. Spirit is the host; essence and qi are the guests. I am the host; the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens are the guests. The thirty-six hundred divine maidens and thirty-six thousand spirits are all transformations of essence and qi. Nowadays, men’s hearts are like restless monkeys and galloping horses, racing a thousand miles in a day—how much more when essence is depleted by lust and qi exhausted by anger? Moreover, the eyes are led astray by forms, the ears deceived by sounds. What benefit do they gain, while what they lose is beyond measure? They do not realize that the radiance of spirit scatters outward, qi and strength disperse in all directions. When essence and qi are no longer preserved, can the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens remain at their side? The ten thousand spirits are one spirit; the ten thousand qi are one qi. From the One arise the ten thousand; gathering the ten thousand returns to the One—all reside in one’s own spirit."

The True Master said: "A single human thought, when concentrated, becomes spirit; when scattered, becomes qi. When spirit gathers, it is called *hun*; when qi gathers, it is called *po* giving rise to life."

The Master said: "When a person dies, it is called a ghost. Yang is *hun*; yin is *po*."

The True Master said: "*The Scripture of the Northern Dipper* was not composed by the Most High. It was recorded by Zhang Zhengyi of the Han dynasty, who transmitted the Most High’s intent to create it. Nowadays, people do not understand the scripture’s meaning and merely gaze at the stars and worship the Dipper. Within the human body, there is a single qi, rising in the east and setting in the west, ascending and descending—just like heaven and earth. The qi of heaven and earth consists of yin and yang; what humans receive is the same. As for the Northern Dipper in the sky, it revolves day and night, dividing yin and yang, determining the hours—thus heaven and earth endure through it. Why not reflect: who governs the single qi within the human body? Knowing who governs it is to know the Northern Dipper within oneself. *The Dipper Scripture* says: 'A household possessing *The Scripture of the Northern Dipper* ensures the prosperity of its livestock.' This refers to the Northern Dipper within the body, which governs its qi. Then the eyes do not crave sights, the ears do not seek sounds, the nose does not desire fragrances, the tongue does not long for tastes, the body does not seek touch, and the mind does not indulge in thought. Preserving this vital essence naturally leads to a peaceful dwelling and flourishing descendants."

The True Master said: "The Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons originally had only four generals: Cui, Lu, Deng, and Dou. Now four more have been added. The Plum Immortal’s Bureau for Summoning originally had only four generals: Pan, Geng, Lu, and Zha. Now four more have been added. These are all later additions, not part of the original method."

The True Master said: "In ancient ritual methods, some used the two generals Huang and Liu, others Gao and Ding, or Jiao and Zeng, or Sang and He, or Xu and Xie. Whatever was received from one’s master was effective without fail."

The True Master said: "*The Purple Text of the Heart of Heaven* states: 'The Three Origins penetrate emptiness; the Five Phases penetrate brilliance; the Eight Trigrams penetrate dawn; the Ten Directions penetrate truth.' Nowadays, people practice the *Eight Trigrams Penetrating Dawn* method but activate the spirit characters—this is ignorance of its origins, passing down confusion upon confusion."

The True Master said: "In ancient times, there was no Fengdu method. At the end of the Tang dynasty, Master Dayuan Hao first transmitted this method to the world for summoning and interrogating ghosts and spirits. The original method contained only eight generals, three talismans, four incantations, and the seal of the Fengdu General Record Bureau. Later generations added excessively, becoming overly verbose—how can such things be considered authentic methods?"

The True Master said: "The method clearly states the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demons—why is it called the Heavenly Mechanism Bureau? Thus, the Southern Culmen has the Heavenly Pivot Bureau, just as in heaven there is the Heavenly Pivot Ministry on the left and the Heavenly Mechanism Ministry on the right. The Heavenly Mechanism is the inner bureau of the Northern Culmen, while the Expelling Demons is the outer bureau. Likewise, the Heavenly Pivot is the inner bureau of the Southern Culmen, and the Southern Culmen also has the Memorial Presenting Bureau as its outer office."

Someone asked: "A single human thought can move heaven and earth. Now, when submitting memorials and dispatching generals and officers, after burning them, they should naturally reach their destination—why then do the Six Heavens’ demonic forces intercept them?"

The Master answered: "A thought of utmost sincerity, in accord with the Dao, can summon true spirits without doubt. In ancient times, there were those with filial hearts, sincere hearts, righteous hearts, compassionate hearts, resolute hearts, and loyal hearts—all moved heaven and earth in moments of offering. This was due to the singleness of their hearts and the rectitude of their thoughts. Nowadays, when people burn memorials to report to the imperial throne, it is merely the ritual teaching that compels them. The resonance of their thoughts is like shooting an arrow at a target, while the resonance of memorials is like thrusting a spear at an object. Though the arrow flies far, it arrives swiftly; though the spear is near, it is hard to reach. Thus, memorials are tangible things, and demonic forces can intercept them. But if thoughts arise from the formless, how can demonic forces intercept them?"

Yuanchang asked: "Human thoughts arise and vanish ceaselessly—why can this thought not summon?"

Yuanchang answered: "Have you not seen how a cat hunts a mouse? Its eyes stare fixedly without blinking, its four paws crouch unmoving upon the earth, its heart harbors no stray thoughts, its mind entertains no idle fancies, its six senses align as one, and its head and tail form a single line—thus, every strike finds its mark.

The True Master said: "Once the primordial chaos divided, the Three Realms took form. Though humans dwell between heaven and earth with small bodies, their spirit is vast; though their form is humble, their spirit is lofty. When Jade Toad once journeyed to the imperial court to present a memorial, the characters on the document were as small as millet grains. Yet upon reaching the celestial capital, those same characters grew as large as teacup saucers. Initially, while still in the human realm, the memorial’s paper was also quite short and narrow. But upon arriving in the heavens, it stretched over a *zhang* in height and two *zhang* in width. From this, we may understand the meaning of *The Hidden Words of the Great Brahma*: 'When clouds and *qi* coalesce, they form a mass over a *zhang* in size, where the Heavenly Perfected and August Ones take up their brushes to write.'

Long ago, while perusing *The Records of Qingyuan*, I saw celestial script floating above Dragon Pool, inscribed with the words: 'Proclamation to the Black and Red,' revealed to the carp. Han Yu discerned it, saying: 'This is the decree by which the Supreme Lord beheaded the dragon,' and noted that each character was no larger than an inch. Yet one may suppose that in heaven, they were not merely an inch in size. Observing this now, there is no mystery—what appears vast in heaven transforms into vastness, while what manifests in miniature from the human realm remains small. It is like a person gazing into a mirror: a large mirror reflects a large face, a small mirror a small one.

From this day forward, whenever preparing memorials on paper, ensure the sheets are one *chi* in height—no taller—and the characters as large as millet grains—no larger. This teaching is no deception."

Yuanchang asked: "I have long doubted whether refinement and deliverance are two separate matters—are they, or are they not?"

The answer said: "The *Scripture of Salvation* states that 'deliverance in the living body is one,' and also that 'refinement of the dead soul is two.' Now examining the *Records of the Crimson Numinous Immortals and the Salvation of Lives*, we find: 'The Southern Prosperity Palace oversees two palaces: the Upper Palace and the Lower Palace. The Upper Palace governs the Bureau of Refinement, while the Lower Palace governs the Bureau of Deliverance. The living body resides in the lower realm, thus it is overseen by the Lower Palace; the dead soul ascends to the upper heavens, thus it is overseen by the Upper Palace.' Collectively, they are called the Crimson Numinous Fire Mansion, also known as the Southern Prosperity Bureau of Refinement and Deliverance. Today, when people speak of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace Refinement Bureau, the authentic officials and those who handle its affairs use the seal of the Refinement Bureau, yet it concurrently governs matters of deliverance for the living body through talismans and registers—this is truly without basis. Since it is called the Southern Prosperity Refinement Bureau, and yet is also termed the Upper Palace Refinement Bureau, this too is without basis. Henceforth, there is no need to speak of Upper or Lower Palaces, nor of refinement or deliverance; simply call it the Southern Prosperity Refinement and Deliverance Bureau, and use the original bureau’s seal, for this alone has a proper foundation. The seal’s inscription reads: *Seal of the Southern Prosperity Refinement and Deliverance Bureau*. It employs the standard interlocking seal script of the human realm, one *cun* and three *fen* in diameter."

Yuanchang asked: "What of the pacing of the stars?"
The answer said: "The pacing of the stars often follows the *Yu* step, and the *Yu* step consists of five, which harmonizes the Five Phases and, over time, enables ascension. Generally, the pacing of the stars uses five steps, advancing and retreating according to the generation and overcoming cycles of the Five Phases. One moves like a cat or dog crouching before a snake: advancing five steps, retreating five steps; advancing seven, retreating seven. The four directions follow the numbers of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. Only after the snake is subdued can it be harmed. Observe how a mouse is pounced upon in the same way. When a cat or dog stalks a snake, if during its advance or retreat it is disrupted or startled by a person, the moment it turns, the snake seizes the chance to harm it—this is because the pacing of the stars was incomplete. As with the methods of the Eight Gates and Hidden Movement in *Dun Jia*, the essence lies in the numinous power of the pacing of the stars!

Xiang asked: "There are doubts about the yin and yang *dou* (constellations) as commonly transmitted."
The answer said: "Today, people begin with the left foot for the initial star, reciting from *Kui* to *Piao* for the yang *dou*, and with the right foot for the initial star, reciting from *Tan* to *Po* for the yin *dou*. How mistaken! This is a baseless theory. The *Scripture of Flying Spirits to Pay Homage to the Dipper* states: 'Proceeding in order is yang, reversing is yin. From *Kui* to *E* is proceeding in order; from *Piao* to *Kui* is reversing.' The essential point is simply: 'If you wish to fly your spirit, do not stray from the Perfected One.' The Perfected One is the third star. All else is the *ding* step. The *ding* step is treading, while a single step is a point. If you say otherwise, I know not what to tell you."

Lu asked: "Is it permissible to summon generals with shouts and rebukes?"
The answer said: "The elders have said: 'Revere them as lords and fathers, command them as servants.' The method of summoning generals and officials is to move spirit with spirit. If a person lacks authority, the spirits will not be complete. When summoning, one must wield the edict of the Supreme Lord, then issue commands to left and right as if the spirits were present. Only thus can one’s spirit command their spirits. The Perfected Master told Xiang: 'Now, simply carry one register, hold one office, practice one method, and issue documents for one bureau. Before the generals and officials of that bureau, use only one talisman and one water, for it is merely the meeting of heart and spirit—use it, and it will be efficacious. It is like a true dragon: a single drop of water becomes a torrential downpour. Why employ such complexity?'"

Yuanchang asked: "In recent times, there are those who practice the Lingbao methods, and I do not say these methods do not exist; likewise, there are those who practice Yuantong methods, and I do not say these do not exist; and still others who practice Hunyuan methods, and I do not say these do not exist. Yet with so many schools and such complexity in incantations and techniques, they are not truly of the Orthodox Unity. In ancient times, the Orthodox Unity was transmitted as the teaching, so the methods practiced were simple and easy. Today, how does Lingbao differ from Yuantong? How does Yuantong differ from Hunyuan? How does Hunyuan differ from Orthodox Unity? The human heart is originally Yuantong, originally Lingbao, originally Orthodox Unity, originally Hunyuan. From the one heart of humanity flow endless methods, just as from the one *qi* of heaven all things are born. Yet some say Hunyuan is one stage, Lingbao another, Yuantong another, and Orthodox Unity yet another—like the cuckoo, which is called *zigu*, *xiebao*, *White Emperor’s Soul*, *Reflecting Mountain Red*, *Pounding Medicine Bird*, or *Shu Crow*, yet it is but one cuckoo."

The Perfected Master said: "All methods arise from the heart; there is no separate method beyond the heart."

Yuanchang asked: "Recently, I have observed that alongside the Lingbao methods, there is also a school called Yuantong, and another called the Supreme Contending Brightness Court method, some using the Supreme *Mo Ming* Court seal, others the Yuantong seal. The seal’s inscription reads *Lingbao Yuantong, Hunhua Xuanmi*, with these eight characters arranged in the eight directions. At the center of the seal are the four characters *Bureau, Court, Ministry, Prefecture*. The inner inscription of the seal is round, the outer square, embodying the meaning of Yuantong. In my humble opinion, *Lingbao Yuantong, Hunhua Xuanmi* is the seal of the heart. Can these eight characters be fully expressed by this wooden seal? The *Bureau, Court, Ministry, Prefecture* are the spirit terrace—can this wooden seal represent these? Little do they realize that Lingbao is inherently Yuantong, and Yuantong is inherently *Leng Ming*. Why then seek branches and leaves, creating such complexity?"

The Master replied: "Truly, this is the *Yuantong* Dharma, yet the seal they have crafted—though claiming to embody *Yuantong*—fails to achieve it."

Yuanchang asked: "Do the methods of the *wu* shamans exist?"
"Yet how can one distinguish their orthodoxy from heterodoxy?"

The Master replied: "The methods of the *wu* shamans originated with King *Suōtǎn*, transmitted to King *Pángǔ*, then to King *Āxiūluó*, and again to King *Wéituó*, King *Chángshā*, King *Tóutuó*, the Ninth Lord of *Lǘ* Mountain in *Lǘ* Prefecture, the Seventh Lord of *Méng* Mountain, the Tenth Lord of *Héng* Mountain, the Third Lord *Zhào Hóu*, the Second Lords *Zhāng* and *Zhào*—and beyond these, their number is unknown.

In ancient times, the methods of the *wu* shamans included the *Pángǔ* Method, the *Língshān* Method, and the *Wènshān* Method, yet in truth, they were all one and the same *wu* method. The *wu* methods often appropriated the words of the *Supreme*, thus their practices frequently employed the incantations of the *Supreme*. Most laughable is this: in former times, beneath the talismans of the *wu* methods, the phrase *'The Supreme is in Heaven'* was written in cursive script. Yet today’s *wu* shamans, ignorant of the characters’ meaning, misread it as *'The Great King is in the Mysterious.'*

Ah! Ah!"

Yuanchang asked: "In the methods, how should one recite the invocations?"

The answer: "Invocation is the meaning of *zhu*. The intent of invocation is to communicate with the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth. If this were so, then the good and evil invocations of the world would everywhere receive their due response. Yet today, it is not so—why? Because the true meaning of invocation is not understood. The croaking of frogs in a well clamoring to the Great Purity, the buzzing of ants in their burrows clamoring to the Lofty Spirits—these are no different from the invocations of people today. How could such invocations elicit a response?

As for the incantations in the methods: first, they are proclaimed by the Golden Mouth of the Supreme; second, they are often the banners and titles of the generals and officers. Thus, the essence of incantation lies in the *fǎfǎ* (method of methods). Therefore, when one sighs, the generals and officers follow, and the exalted perfected ones hear. Why, then, are the incantations of people today ineffective? Because they do not grasp the meaning of invocation. The meaning of incantation lies in treasuring the mind’s focus and the eye’s visualization—then the summoning of generals and officers is as if the divine were present before one."

Yuanchang asked: "The *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* states: *Thirty-six above in Heaven, thirty-six below on Earth; the Great Mysterious is boundless, wondrous indeed is the Great Cavern Sutra.* Some take this to mean the two *hei* of yin and yang and the seventy-two seasonal nodes—is this correct?"

The answer: "This refers to matters within the human body. The *Níwán* corresponds to Heaven, belonging to *qián*; the number of *qián* is four; *qián* metal is *jiǎzǐ*, the number of metal is four, and *qián* employs nine. The *Wěilǘ* corresponds to Earth, belonging to *kūn*; the number of *kūn* is six, and *kūn* employs six. Thus, four nines make thirty-six, which is called 'above in Heaven,' and six sixes make thirty-six, which is called 'below on Earth.' This speaks of the thirty-six vessels in the human head and the thirty-six channels in the lower abdomen—Heaven and Earth are likewise. Only the human heart cannot be seen or heard, and so it is called 'the Great Mysterious, boundless, wondrous indeed—the Great Cavern.'

Lú asked: "There are five precepts, the first of which is not to drink wine. Yet wine does not harm the Dao, though I fear it may cloud one’s nature. Should wine truly be forbidden?"

The answer: "The *Canon of Scriptures* states in the words of the Supreme: *Those of great talent and heroic refinement are only addicted to wine; the fermented brew fumes the heart, inverting nature and temperament, destroying the ten virtues and giving rise to the ten evils. The four thoroughfares are laid waste, and the six penetrations are blocked.*

The true master told his disciple: *The female immortal È Lǜhuá said to Yáng Quán: ‘The scholar of the Dao regards brocade as filth, sees rank and office as a passing traveler, and views gold and jade as tiles and pebbles. Without thought, without worry, without affairs, without action—he walks where others cannot walk, learns what others cannot learn, toils where others cannot toil, and attains what others cannot attain.’* Why is this?"

The worldly pursue desires, while I embrace solitude;
The worldly study mundane affairs, while I cultivate tranquility;
The worldly toil for fame and profit, while I refine my inner conduct;
The worldly attain old age and death, while I attain eternal life.

The true master said: "The ancients declared: *Only when one’s wisdom surpasses the teacher’s is one worthy of transmission; if one’s wisdom equals the teacher’s, one diminishes half the teacher’s virtue.* Moreover, as the texts say: *When the teacher labors yet achieves little, when the teacher is at ease yet achieves much*—this is the principle."

The master said: "Among all things under heaven, only mercury and *naozi* (brain marrow) cannot be counterfeited. In our teachings, essence is likened to mercury and called *gong* (quicksilver), while the marrow of the head is called *nao* (brain). For mercury easily evaporates, and *naozi* readily dissipates. Even if sealed in a secure place, should anything draw them, they flee and vanish—just as pepper penetrates mercury. Nowadays, people’s essence and marrow are often seized by lust, leading to exhaustion. Alas!"

The true master said: "My former teacher, Chen Niju, once served at the Huizong Court. There, he encountered the Great Cavern Perfected, Master Sun, who told him: *In ancient times, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning and the Most High Lord Lao compiled the scriptures they had expounded, gathering and arranging them into a canon. Such texts as the* Scripture of the Northern Dipper, *the* Scripture of the Southern Dipper, *the* Scripture for Dispelling Disasters, *the* Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility, *the* Scripture of the Heavenly Youth, *and the* Numinous Treasure Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*—along with the titles of the Jade Emperor and the Celestial Venerable—all possess true traces of their origins.*"

I asked: "What of the *Yuqie* teachings practiced today?"
He replied: "Their tradition claims descent from Śākyamuni’s teachings. Śākyamuni manifested as the Filthy-Trace Vajra to subdue the Conch-Crested Brahmā King, and thus this teaching was transmitted to vanquish demons and restrain heterodox paths. It relies solely on the thirty-three-syllable *Golden Wheel Filthy-Trace Mantra*. Within their school, the Medicine King Nāgārjuna assists them. Beyond this, there are the two great sages of Fragrant Mountain and Snow Mountain, the two great sages of Pig’s Head and Elephant’s Trunk, the two great sages of Mighty Might and Splendid Light, as well as Prince Nawen, King Dingshu, the Deep Sand Spirit, and the *Gatī* Spirit—all supporting their dharma. They are aided by vajra *yakṣas* and enforcers, though their generals number only four: Tiger *Garuḍa*, Horse *Garuḍa*, Ox-Head *Garuḍa*, and Golden-Head *Garuḍa*. No others exist.

Yet today’s false masters mingle terms from various Daoist methods, stomp their steps, twist their fingers, shout at the top of their lungs, leap wildly, shake bells and chimes, whip hemp snakes, and strike peachwood staves—greatly distorting the ancient teachings. This is hardly what Śākyamuni intended! Nevertheless, *Yuqie* remains one of the Buddha’s methods for subduing demons."

I asked: "In the countryside, many abstain from meat and observe fasts to serve the *Mingjiao*, calling it *demon-destruction*. Their followers claim it as the legacy of the Most High Lord Lao. Is this true or false?"
He replied: "Long ago in the state of Sulin, there lived a layman named Moge. Initially, he failed in his pursuit of immortality, and later, he did not succeed in Buddhism. He withdrew to the Great Nāga Mountain, where he encountered an outer-path messenger from the Western Heaven named *Ripipojia Ming*. This messenger taught him a method to cultivate, and thus this teaching was left behind. In truth, it is irrational.

Their doctrine includes a prohibition, claiming that the entire earth—mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, water, and fire—is the *Dharmakāya* of Vairocana. Thus, they dare not tread upon or disturb anything. Yet even so, they stand *outside* the body of Vairocana’s *Dharmakāya*. Their practices—observing the eight fasts, worshiping the five directions—are merely precepts imposed by their teachings.

Their hierarchy consists of three ranks: the Heavenly King, the Illuminating Messenger, and the Numinous Form Earth Deity, who govern the teaching. Its essence lies in the eight characters: *clarity, strife, radiance, power, wisdom, and might*. Yet these eight characters originate from the mind. Can one who clings to forms in cultivation truly embody them? Moreover, they call it the *Mingjiao* (Teaching of Light), yet they themselves remain benighted."

The true master said: "Whether ordinary or sacred, it is like a shadow following form—one becomes many, and many become one. Like the sun and moon reflected in myriad waters, their light is fundamentally undivided. Yet they arise with the water and appear with the eye. A single water with a thousand eyes yields a thousand suns and moons; a single water with one eye yields one sun and moon. A thousand waters with one eye yield one sun and moon; a thousand waters with a thousand eyes yield a thousand suns and moons. Like a shadow following form, it is ever thus. You cannot grasp it, nor can you abandon it; neither grasping nor abandoning, it remains unattainable."

I asked: "The so-called *yin elixir* and *yang elixir*—are these external elixirs or internal elixirs?"
He replied: "External elixirs are difficult to refine and yield no success; internal elixirs are easy to refine and bear fruit. The *yin elixir* and *yang elixir* are both internal elixirs. The *elixir* is the heart; the heart is the spirit. The *yang spirit* is called the *yang elixir*; the *yin spirit* is called the *yin elixir*—yet both are internal elixirs.

*Yang spirit* enables *shedding the mortal coil and changing the bones*, a body beyond the body. When gathered, it takes form; when dispersed, it becomes shadow. *Yin spirit* is a single thought of pure numinosity, where the soul and consciousness have not yet scattered—like a dream, like a shadow, akin to a ghost. Those who cultivate the elixir must understand this."

The true master instructed Yuanchang: "*The Red Spirit Jade Text* states: *The Eastern Pole of Precious Splendor, the Western Pole of Grand Purity, the Northern Pole for Driving Away Evil, the Southern Pole of the Celestial Pivot*—these are the Four Poles, while the Central Pole of the Five Thunders truly governs their affairs. Now, the Great Thunder of the Capital Heaven all emerges from above the Jade Pivot of Divine Empyrean, called the *Great Thunder of Scenic Empyrean*. Though the Scenic Empyrean lies below the Divine Empyrean, it is the abode where the Primordial Beginning sojourns."

The former Celestial Perfection dispatched the fierce official of the Thunder Department, Adjudicator Xin Hanchen, to bestow it upon my late master Chen Cuixu. Cuixu transmitted it to me, and now I pass it to you—guard it well."

The true master said:
*"When spirit returns to the vast, Mount Sumeru grows small;
When qi enters the void, a mustard seed holds boundless space."*

The true master addressed Xiang: "You claim the Eleven Luminaries Incantation is truly spoken by the Most High—is this clear to you?"
Xiang replied: "Indeed!"
The master exclaimed: "Hmph! That incantation speaks of 'Gan and Shi pushing the flow to submission,' yet Gan De and Shi Shen were both stellar sages—men of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. How could this scripture predate their birth? Test it thus: could these be the words of the Most High? Hmph!"

The true master addressed Yuanchang: "You assert the worldly *Hunyuan Ruyi* method is authentic?"
Yuanchang replied: "Yes."
The master exclaimed: "Hmph! That method contains an incantation invoking the *Statutes and Ordinances of the Northern Pole Protector Sage Perfected Lord*, and also the *Statutes and Ordinances of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Master Who Upholds and Assists the Primordial*. If true, this is dubious indeed. The Protector Sage was a man of the Zhou dynasty, and the Celestial Master a man of the Han—were the *Hunyuan* method already extant before the Most High, it would not invoke the statutes of the Most High Lord Lao, let alone those of the Protector Sage and the Celestial Master! What then of the *Primordial*?"

Hmph!

Lu asked: "Recently, I have heard of the *Yuantong* method and have privately harbored doubts about it. Its talismanic seals are round on the inside and square on the outside, with the Five Agents at the center and the Eight Trigrams surrounding them. The provincial and prefectural offices, as well as the various bureaus, are arrayed at the four directions. It takes the four characters *Lingbao Yuantong* as its宗 and *Hunhua Xuanmi* as its本. It cobbles together talismans, diagrams, incantations, and oral instructions from various methods to forge a single system, calling it the *Great Yuantong Method*. Does the master affirm this or not?"

The master replied: "The spirit has no fixed form, hence it is called *round*; the primordial has no fixed substance, hence it is called *penetrating*. In ancient times, the teaching of *Yuantong* referred to the fusion of spirit and *qi*, issuing forth into the formless and returning to primordial chaos. If one now takes shapes, instruments, trigrams, and numbers as its basis, how far removed is this from true *Yuantong*? Moreover, such a method did not exist in antiquity. Alas! The errors of false masters are not the fault of sentient beings."

The true master addressed Xiang: "Do you know of the two envoys, *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo*, within the Dipper?"

Xiang replied: "I would hear of this."

The master said: "*Qingyang* is a human term; in the heavens, it is the sound of *Zhangshan* (Upholding Goodness). *Tuoluo* is a human expression; in the heavens, it is the word *Duda* (Great Assembly). The *Qingyang* envoy holds a jade vase and a golden lotus; the *Tuoluo* envoy carries a golden tray and a censer of *baixieshou* incense. The views of the vulgar world are mistaken indeed!"

The true master said: "My former master once remarked: 'What great joy exists in the human realm!' Yet suffering and joy ever follow one another in cycles. Joy does not last a hundred years, but suffering endures for ten thousand kalpas. In this world, those with wealth cling to it unto death, while those without it beg unto death. I have never seen men contend with wealth for their lives rather than contend with their lives for wealth."

Hmph! The true master addressed Yuanchang: "Do you know that all the methods I teach are methods of the heart?"

Yuanchang replied: "I know this."

The master asked: "What then is the heart?"

Yuanchang said: "I do not know."

The master said: "If you do not know, how can you practice?"

Yuanchang replied: "All dharmas are none other than methods of the heart."

The master said: "Then practice for now. With time, you will know; knowing, you will not know; not knowing, you will know. Though you do not know, how is this different from knowing?"

Upon hearing these words, Xiang and Yuanchang leapt with joy, moved to sorrow, and awakened profoundly. Master Haiqiong rose with a smile.

**Memorial of Transmission and Thanksgiving**

To the Supreme Divine *Shenxiao* Jade-Pure Prefecture, Commander of Thunder and Lightning, Marshal of the Five Thunder Generals, and Director of the Thunder Bureau’s Ghosts and Spirits:

Your servant, Yu Chan, respectfully states: On the fifteenth day of this month, we humbly submit this memorial on behalf of Peng Xiang, Envoy of the Supreme Clarity Great Flower Cinnabar Scenery Office and Scribe of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture’s Western Terrace, Acting Judge of the Xiandu Wind and Thunder Bureau; your servant, Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Mysterious Capital Three Sceneries Dharma Master, Grand Master of the *Taiyi* Thunder Register, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, and Signatory of the Various Bureaus’ Dharma Courts for Ghosts and Spirits; your servant, Liu Yuanchang, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Acting Judge of the Expelling Demons Court, Southern Chang Register Keeper, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, concurrently Director of the Thunder Bureau’s Ghosts and Spirits; your servant, Lin Boqian, Registrant of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Record, Right Attendant Scripture Keeper of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture; your servant, Pan Changji, Registrant of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Record, Right Attendant Scripture Keeper of the Divine *Shenxiao* Jade Prefecture; your servant, Zhou Xiqing, Disciple of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and Service Dharma Record, Practitioner of the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma and Acting Judge of the Expelling Demons Court, concurrently Managing the Five Thunder Envoys’ Court; your servant, Hu Shijian, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Practitioner of the Supreme Clarity *Hunyuan* Heavenly Heart Five Thunder Great Dharma, appointed to Direct the Expelling Demons Court, concurrently Managing the Thunder Bureau; your servant, Luo Zhida, Disciple of the Supreme *Sanwu* Merit and *Zixu Yangguang* Secret Record, Practitioner of the Supreme Clarity Northern Culmen Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma, Golden Watchtower Inner Terrace Refiner and Transformer, Right Judge of the Expelling Demons Court; your servant, Chen Shoumo, Orthodox Unity Alliance-Wei Dharma Master, Practitioner of the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Heart Jade Dawn Five Thunder Great Dharma, Ninefold Numinous Flying Paces Transcendent Official, Director of the Expelling Demons Yellow Register Court; your servant, Zhuang Zhirong, and others—having been entrusted with the Daoist methods, we have memorialized and received imperial approval to register and confer the aforementioned appointments.

We humbly submit that the Dharma has its orthodox transmission, fortunately inherited through the master’s teachings, and offices are never conferred in vain, for we aspire to repay the celestial grace. Daring to express our private gratitude after the audience, we now present this bound memorial from within.

Your servants, ephemeral as cicadas, ignorant as ants—unworthily numbered among the people of the Central Kingdom, we owe our very existence to the great Potter’s craft. Gazing up at the encompassing embrace of Heaven and Earth, bathed in the radiance of sun and moon, we sit and eat in shame, for what merit have we rendered unto the world?

Tracing back through kalpas untold to this present life, we possess this body and have reached this moment—yet the three evil and unwholesome deeds—killing, stealing, and lustful transgressions—along with the six roots clouded by ignorance, greed, hatred, and delusion, have amassed sins vast as the sea and karmic burdens heavier than mountains. By the grace of the Supreme Perfected Ones, who opened the gates of repentance and confession, even the most foolish are granted a path to lay bare their faults. Thus, past transgressions are absolved, and future calamities are averted.

Yet, in our dim-witted devotion, we have failed the molding hands of the Dao. From early affinity with the Way, we encountered the *Divine Empyrean Five Thunder Scriptures*; as mortals yearning for transcendence, we received the *Supreme Highest Ninefold Numinous Decrees*. Thereby, we came to grasp seals within our palms and dispatch talismans with our brushes, commanding wind and thunder, distinguishing between humans and spirits, aiding the living and delivering the dead, upholding the upright and expelling the perverse. How could we dare, mired in the dust of the mundane hall, to tread upon the celestial pivot of the *Big Dipper*?

Since ancient times, transmission and reception have been thus; today, we humbly uphold and practice them. Internally, we refine the elixir; externally, we accumulate merit and conduct. Embodying Heaven’s transformative power, we assist the state and succor the people.

We reverently consider the *Highest Supreme Divine Empyrean Jade Pure Perfected King*, the *Great Emperor of Longevity*—whose Dao is vast and ineffable, whose virtue is boundless and all-pervading, parent to all beings, lunar preceptor of the celestial realms. He orders the nine streams before the myriad harmonies, governs the eight directions beyond the vastness of the firmament, extending compassion to save the world and employing skillful means to deliver humanity.

Your servants, though but scribes in the Eastern Terrace and minor functionaries in the Western Bureau, have studied the rites of dividing talismans and breaking contracts, performed the ceremonies of pledging with blood and imbibing cinnabar, and sworn to lead the generals and officials in achieving extraordinary merit—all relying on the talismanic charts to propagate the great teachings. May Your profound benevolence, in hidden and subtle ways, deign to look upon us. We pray to sweep clean the dust of seas and mountains, seal the caves of demons and malevolent spirits, and open the gates of emptiness and non-being, that the winds of *Orthodox Unity* may once more flourish.

Presuming upon the awe of Heaven, we obey and receive the Emperor’s mandate. Should we be granted Your sheltering protection, we shall proceed with our undertakings. Though our bodies have not yet attained perfect realization, the black embryo still requires the *Jade Black*; though our spirits have not yet entered the wondrous, the *Heavenly Heart* must harmonize with celestial wanderings.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, your servants humbly present this memorial for Your august perusal.

Kowtow! Prostrate bow! Reverently bowing again, I humbly submit:

Memorial presented by your subject Yu Chan, of indeterminate rank, on a day in the tenth month of the eleventh year of Jiading in the year *wuyin* of the Great Cycle.

**Three Poems from the Divine Empyrean**

Vast and distant, the Divine Empyrean,
When shall dawn break over the Jade Capital?
Jade flowers glisten with dew-laden elixir,
Jewel trees whisper in the wind’s refrain.

Jade consorts attend the cloud-scriptures,
Feathered lads dance with golden plumes.
Alas, the people of this world below,
Chasing red dust in vain, day after day.

Purple jade soars over the Pure Metropolis,
Emerald clouds guard the crimson palace gates.
No stars are seen—only sun and moon,
Gazing down upon the earth below.

Two thousand years have passed in this world,
Daring not speak of it to mortal ears.
I have already refined the Golden Elixir,
Leaving behind the secret of flying immortality.

Scribes of the Jade Emperor’s incense table,
Ministers of the Golden Gates’ forbidden walls,
Precious censers simmer with sun and moon,
Iron rods lash thunder and lightning.

At dawn, I refine the clouds of Western Mountains,
At night, I brew the stars of the Northern Dipper.
To the tree spirit south of the city, I declare:
"My home lies in the Jade Capital."

My master, Lord Haiqiong,
Flew his monastic staff between Mount Kang and Lu.
In the spring of *wuyin* in Jiading,
A letter summoned me to the Wuyi Mountains.
I, bound by clan duties,
Received an official summons to the capital.
I departed in summer and returned in autumn,
Hiring a boat to seek our covenant—
Yet he was nowhere to be found.
Thus, I left these three poems as a record.

It was said: My wife, Zhou Xiqing, rode here in tandem.
On the Double Ninth of that year,
Ziyuanzi left his eldest son, Yuanshan, skilled in calligraphy.
Before the *Zhizhi* Hermitage, along the Nine-Bend Stream,
I moored my boat to gaze at the slanting sunlight.
I asked passersby if the master had returned—
Only to see dragons and serpents soaring on the walls.

The true master’s traces vanished,
His brushwork alive upon the walls.
I strode to seek the Bone-Transforming Cliff,
But found only his discarded husk interred in a jade casket.
Was Ziyuan not destined for immortality?
Yet who would guide me now?

Today, precisely the Double Ninth,
Wind carries osmanthus fragrance from the grotto.
With my wife, I gathered chrysanthemums,
Returning to fill our cups with ninefold rosy clouds.

**Immortal Lyrics Presented to Ziyuan**

Riding a jade turtle by night to pluck the bright moon,
In the elixir hall of the jade terrace, the cold pierces to the bone.
The thirty-six heavens never close their gates—
Wind scatters jade flowers like flying petals.

From whose flute does the melody arise?
Eighty thousand *nishang*-clad beings sing *White Snow*.
The Purple Emperor, having feasted, prepares to depart,
Adjusting his robes and holding his tablet to pay court.

The Fire-Link General barks a command—
Ten thousand immortals to his left and right bristle.
He petitions: "Your servant was once an officer of thunder,
Banished for an offense from the cinnabar gates.
Buried in red dust up to my ears,
I ate greens and drank dew, keeping strict austerities.
Now, my spirit ascends to heaven parched with thirst—
If the Emperor has wine, let me take but a sip,
Granting your servant a drunken release to return home."

Returning to the mortal world, I tell others:
At the Phoenix Pavilion, I inquired about the way back.
Jade lads and jade maidens asked me:
"In heaven, the days are long and the Great Purity vast—
Is the mortal world at all like this?"
I shook my head, gave no answer, and brushed my sleeves,
White clouds stretching endlessly, veiling the Pure Metropolis.
In the grotto, gibbons and cranes recognize one another,
White stones gleam while green pines wither.

**Thirty Poems from Huayang**

My home lies on Qiong Isle, ten thousand leagues away,
This body comes and goes like a solitary boat.
Last night, in a dream, I rode the west wind home—
Gazing toward my homeland, tears streamed in vain.

The southern seas are a realm of water and clouds,
Ten years have blurred my vision with longing.
In fleeting moments of reflection,
The west wind and evening sun choke the sad cicadas.

Since parting from the southern seas’ boat,
My body has followed the clouds to Jiang-Zhe’s skies.
I’ve wandered through grotto-heavens seeking recluses—
I wonder how many straw sandals I’ve worn through.

White clouds accompanied me to Tiantai,
My eyes met green mountains, my heart opened wide.
Yet upon reaching those peaks, new longings arose—
Everywhere, the night apes’ cries bring sorrow.

Leaning on my staff, I entered Wuyi,
Beneath Manting Peak, snowflakes flew.
Walking along the Nine-Bend Rapids,
Ten thousand ravines and a thousand cliffs encircled me in emerald.

In Wuyi, I built a thatched hut for two years,
Flowers smiled, orioles sang—spring in a flask.
Stream water flowed down the mountain, people emerged from grottoes,
Before the cliff, only the empty alchemy furnace remained.

Having obtained the formula, I returned to test refinement—
Dragons and tigers clashed in an instant.
If the people of Jiuhua Peak knew,
A single night’s wind and thunder would shake ten thousand mountains.

At the White Horse River’s head, I let out a roar—
Crimson light and purple mist arose from the water.
Quickly, I drew the green-snake sword from its scabbard—
Only then did the Yellow River run clear to its depths.

I drank hundreds of goblets of golden waves,
When drunk, I brandished my sword toward the void.
My feet playfully tread the *Qian* and *Dou* constellations,
A long whistle—heaven and earth turned red.

I moved the Northern Dipper past the Southern Asterism,
With both hands, I lifted the sun and moon.
Flying to Kunlun’s summit,
In an instant, I transformed into a cloud covering the sky.

Playfully sailing a golden boat to the sea’s edge,
Secretly following the sea’s waters through flowing sands.
Once I stepped onto Penglai’s shore,
I went to admire the flowers of the Jade Terrace and Celestial Gardens.

The human body itself contains a Penglai,
Twelve-tiered towers with white jade steps.
The Crimson Maiden and Golden Boy often meet in the tower,
Before the hall, peonies bloom every night.

A strange matter that makes one laugh several times:
Now even men can conceive.
Their own essence and blood unite in congress—
Within the body, husband and wife are wondrous indeed!

One chant, one drunkenness, one *daogui* of elixir,
True *qi* and true essence fill the four limbs.
When wine’s warmth lulls me to deep sleep,
My boat, laden with treasures, sails past Caoxi.

The primordial spirit lodges nightly in the cinnabar field,
Clouds fill the Yellow Court, the moon fills the sky.
Two mandarin ducks float on green waters—
In the water’s heart, a single purple-gold lotus.

Hungry, I eat a morsel of black turtle liver,
Cold, I turn to the cinnabar field’s raging fire mountain.
Seeing no affairs in my heart,
I know not that the world suffers hunger and cold.

The Green Ox Man departed how many years ago?
This Dao lies clearly before our eyes.
If you wish to recognize the true state before you—
A hall where wind is cool and the moon is fair.

In a moment’s effort, I refine mercury and lead,
A furnace’s fierce fire burns the night sky.
Suddenly, divine water falls into the golden well—
Fusing the numinous cinnabar, round as the moon.

A pool of divine water fills the Hua Pond,
Nightly, white snow flies by its edge.
Within the snow, someone seizes the jade hare,
Driving the bright moon to ascend the cold branch.

Not a thread stirs as I pass the Jade Pass,
At its summit stands the Jade Capital Mountain.
Should one traverse its depths to and fro,
Wind churns the nine skies with frost and snow’s chill.

Who perceives the workings of the celestial revolution?
Now all is compressed within a fleeting moment.
Simply take lead and mercury into true earth,
And refine golden blossoms to fill the crucible with crimson.

Last night at the third watch, thunder shook the mountain,
The gates of the nine heavens remained unbarred.
Upon the path of Caoxi, I saw clearly—
A golden crow entered the vast cold.

The Caoxi road pierces the mud pill,
Confined between the upper and lower cinnabar fields.
Master the union of the golden elder and the maiden,
Where morning clouds and evening rain fill Mount Wu.

Use only wù and jǐ as the elixir furnace,
Refine the red pellet into jade nectar.
Gently tend the fire for three hundred days,
And yield a luminous pearl that shines through the night.

A scattered gentleman of the Crimson Palace’s immortal realm,
I wander the mortal world feigning madness.
Within this body lies the treasure of eternal life—
Nightly, my spirit soars to pay homage above.

My home lies in the Nine Dark Heavens of Divine Radiance,
Where celestial towers and halls house the host of immortals.
Having chanced upon the human world,
I reckon not even a year has passed in Divine Radiance.

A jade sovereign’s page beneath the throne,
Once keeper of talismans and guardian of the alchemical palace,
Why do worldly ties still bind me?
Now this illusory form is trapped in the dusty cage.

My qi overshadows mountains and rivers, my heart bold,
Yet I neither wield the sword nor pore over books.
Last night, my actions shook heaven and earth—
Now I gently tend the jade crucible with measured fire.

This dreamlike body will not endure long,
How many mulberry and elm can withstand frost and wind?
Better to leap from the pit of fame and profit,
And bestow upon you the formula for eternal life.

I toy with rivers and mountains, my verses cunning,
Exhaling and inhaling wind and moon, my wine a divine art.
With poetry and drink, I deceive mortal eyes,
Passing through the red dust for how many winters.

**Inscription at Tianqing Abbey**
I bought a leaf of a boat on Luo River,
Worldly success melts like wax—ah, let it be.
I lack the begging, tail-dragging demeanor,
Early on, I turned to ash-hearted retirement from office.

I have learned to plow White Marsh like Zhuangzi of Qiyuan,
Content to await the green ox as the Keeper of the Pass.
What need have I for the elixir spoon—who would understand?
Only the bright moon and clear wind nod in approval.

**Inscription at the Yue Shrine**
A southern sword halts the three mountains,
I claim my share of life’s wind and moon.
Who will govern Jingyang to dispense medicine?
I sought Mount Goulou to refine the elixir.

I admire Zhuangzi’s salary in Qiyuan,
Laozi once served as the Keeper beneath the pillar.
I regard glory as a familiar sight—
Better to early refine the azure jade elixir.

**Swallows Nest in a Flowering House**
My gaze stretches to the path of Divine Radiance.
The Dipper’s handle points south, cinnabar radiance and emerald hues,
Crimson clouds and purple mists.
I plucked jade flowers—now it seems a dream,
Where are the twelve towers and terraces?
I still recall the companions of that time.
Who now presides over the Eastern Palace and Western Terrace?
I remember how we poured from the golden vase,
The affairs between us two, like wind-tossed willow fluff.

The August Sovereign, mighty thunder’s lord—
Why was I, in the green capital and crimson palaces,
So suddenly consigned to antiquity?
The white crane and blue crow’s tidings are cut off,
My dreams of phoenix songs and dances unfulfilled.
I have yet to turn and return.
Karmic debts must be repaid in full,
This time, I taste the bitterness of the red dust to the dregs.
I shall report it all
To the Queen Mother of the West.

**Again**

The moon is pinned like a green snail-shell coil,
At the willow’s tip, the sun lingers and fades,
Autumn winds sway and drift.
A few grains of dark mountains stretch to the distant Han,
Tree hues and misty light in purple and emerald.
The galloping riders are half-sober, half-drunk.
Swords at their hips, they grind the stars in the autumn sky,
Pointing to the jade lads, yet dare not sound the golden bridle,
Lest they startle
The Purple Clarity Emperor.

Floating clouds drift over Penglai’s waters.
I recall the mountains—
Pines chilled by cold dew,
Gibbons wailing, cranes shrieking.
My home lies within the cliffs and valleys of Mount Wu,
A single acre of mist and radiance for livelihood.
I sigh, burning my fingers—
A hundred years of human life.
How many ages have passed for orchid bowls and mushroom fields?
Before the grotto’s gate, young deer play among the flowers,
Unaware of the world of men.

**Presented to Attendant Sutra-Bearer Pan Changji**
A speck of red dust stirs the heart,
In the Hall of Medicinal Pearls, a hairpin falls.
Once we descended together along the Jade Terrace path,
Yet now only Peng and He remain in the forest.
Dreaming of the mortal realm, I know not how to retreat,
Night after night, beneath the window, I tune the jade zither.
Laughing, I point toward the Divine Empyrean—
When shall I return?
The crimson palaces and clear capitals lie veiled in mist.

**Presented to Purple Radiance Attendant Sutra-Bearer Zhou Xiqing**
A celestial maiden with moth-like brows,
Why did you descend to the red dust?
Who now attends the Divine Empyrean’s medicine chest?
The purple courts’ jade flowers dare not bloom in spring.
No dreams of attending the Queen Mother’s feast,
For in a former life, you were surely a being of the Purple Void.
I send word to seek the Penglai path,
Where the wind carries twin simurghs to the Great Brilliance.

*The Record of Master Haiqiong the White Real Man, Scroll One* (conclusion)
*The Record of Master Haiqiong the White Realman, Scroll Two*
Compiled by Disciples of the Fuzhou Tianqing Abbey, including Supervisor and Chief Daoist Administrator Ziguang Lin Boqian et al.

**Crane Grove Dharma Teachings**
On the Lantern Festival of the *renwu* year of the Jiading era, the Patriarch, Master Haiqiong, received a letter from his preceptor, Master Helin, sent from Zhe to Min, on behalf of the preceptor’s father, the late Awakened Non-Master of the Ministry of Rites. He performed the Yellow Register rites.

At dawn on that day, the preceptor approached with incense tucked in his sleeve, bowing deeply in reverence. His words were as follows:
“Since your departure from Min, I have practiced the Dao day and night, never daring to be idle. Yet Heaven, silent, has taken what I cherished. Recently, I submitted a memorial to inquire after the Dao, only to find what I valued already lost. I beg you, Master, to take pity.
At the moment of his passing, thunder roared and winds howled, filling the house with an extraordinary fragrance. Outside, the day was clear, yet no one heard a sound—his death seemed unlike others’. When we buried him, unbroken rain fell for days, then suddenly cleared. After the burial, the rain returned. Even the locals noted the strangeness.
I presumptuously used the yellow thread for purification. Now that you have descended, Master, may the yellow thread’s purpose be fulfilled. The Three Realms will rejoice! The myriad spirits will celebrate!”

The Patriarch replied: “My disciple, there is no need for such excessive courtesy. Today is the Lantern Festival; I immediately ordered the establishment of a purification hall, the erection of a Jade Hall, and the installation of a Jade Casket Office, along with a Yellow Thread Bureau. From *chen* to *shen*, documents were prepared, oaths sworn to Heaven and Earth, and a memorial tablet planted at the gate.
I appointed Xuanyi Zhao Rukuai as High Ritual Master, Zishu Lin Shizhong as Chief Lecturer, Ziguang Lin Boqian as Supervisor of the Vegetarian Feast, Fang Hao Jing’an as Attendant Sutra-Bearer, Yuling Deng Daoning as Attendant Incense-Bearer, Yuhua Chen Milong as Attendant Lamp-Bearer, Zihu Xie Xiandao as Altar Steward, Ziqiong Zhao Shoufu as Procession Overseer. I myself acted as the Supreme Clarity Yellow Register Envoy, serving as General Supervisor.
The appointments were to be finalized on the last day of the first month, the rites performed on the first day of the second month, the jiao completed on the fourth day, thanksgiving offered on the fifth, and the Thunder Rites held on the sixth. All fast and jiao rituals followed ancient forms, with nine-morning ceremonies conducted as usual.”
The preceptor assented daily.

On the first day of the second month, *gengchen*, at dawn, a torrential downpour began. The rain persisted for three days, the skies dark and stormy, continuing through three days and nights of the nine-morning rites. Yet as soon as the procession began to ascend for the audience, the skies cleared. Once the morning rites concluded, the rain returned—this pattern held for all nine mornings.
On the second day, *xinsi*, at *you*, as the memorial was presented, people worried over the rain. Just as the memorial was prostrated, the rain abruptly ceased. Clouds gathered on all sides, yet above the altar, the Northern Aster shone brightly, while outside, the rain fell as before. When the rites concluded, rain poured down upon the altar, and the onlookers rejoiced.

The Patriarch said: “The alternation of yin and yang is Heaven’s affair—mere coincidence. Why worry? Why rejoice?”
On the third day, *renwu*, at dawn, something was seen within the family shrine, believed to be the arrival of ancestral spirits. The preceptor, overjoyed, rushed in to report. The Patriarch swiftly stopped him, saying: “Let it be. The Great Dao is formless and does not favor apparitions. The Dharma is but the function of the Dao—it can summon the unseen. If someone sees something today, what is strange about that?”

Someone asked: “After the jiao rites concluded, the Welcoming of the Perfected and the Proclamation of Amnesty were completed, the skies cleared as they had been before the rites. Yet for the entire nine-day period—from beginning to end—there were three full days and nights of overcast rain. Why was this so?”

The Patriarch replied: “From ancient times to the present, when the Yellow Register Retreat is held, there is often gloomy weather. This is because the suffering souls of the hidden realm emerge from the gates of yin. Such conditions arise naturally in response to the rites.

On the seventh day, *bingxu*, the various divine officials were summoned, and the sacrifice to Thunder was performed. When the rites concluded, the sacrificial animals and wine-meats were buried in the *xun* direction along with the cinnabar talismans. It was agreed that when thunder sounded after three days, the talismans would be unearthed and placed in the Crane Grove Retreat.

That year, from the preceding winter, there had been no rain, making wheat planting difficult. With this Yellow Register Retreat, the earth received moisture. After the jiao rites, a thanksgiving feast was held in the oratory, and the divine officials were credited with their merits.

The Preceptor offered his gratitude, saying: “Master, in conducting these jiao rites, you have done what the people of this region have never witnessed, and what I have gained is beyond measure! The blessings bestowed upon the living have also been abundant. Your conduct has been flawless, your teachings like medicine and stone to the heart—unprecedented, unparalleled. Yet whenever reports of divine marvels or numinous wonders arise, you always suppress them. Why is this?”

The Patriarch replied: “It is mere coincidence. Why indulge in joy? I neither rejoice in their presence nor worry over their absence. I simply know to practice the Dao and uphold the Dharma, allowing things to unfold naturally. The reason for this is that I rely on sincerity to penetrate all responses and depend on the Dharma to carry out the affairs. What cause is there for joy or worry in between? If such thoughts arise, they only disrupt my right mindfulness.”

Someone asked: “What is the meaning of the *Yellow Register*?”

The Patriarch replied: “The deliverance of the Nine Yin realms from suffering employs the methods of the *Golden Register* and *White Writs*. The *Golden Register* is the *Yellow Register*, and for this reason, Heaven too has established a *Yellow Register* Court. *Yellow* is the origin of all colors; *Register* is the talisman of the myriad Perfected. This signifies that the principle of the Yellow Center governs qi, commands the myriad Perfected, guides souls from darkness to light, and saves the living while delivering the dead. *Register* also means *record*—it is the ledger of ghosts and spirits. *Yellow* also signifies *mastery*—it is the governance of the affairs of ghosts and spirits. Thus, the ghosts and spirits of the hidden realms have a master to oversee and record them.”

The Preceptor asked: “The Dipper is the Emperor’s Chariot, revolving at the center and overseeing the four directions to inspect portents. Thus, the scriptures say: ‘The Great Culmen of the Central Dipper supervises all spirits.’ The original scripture also states: ‘The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper are the great deities of the celestial center.’ The *Discourses of Lu* likewise says: ‘Like the North Star, all stars encircle it.’ If this is so, then the Dipper’s Pole is the image of the Unmatched, for it governs the entire starry river. Yet some ask: If the Dipper resides at the center of Heaven, why is it called the *Northern* Dipper?”

“They do not realize that the Dipper’s handle begins its rotation at *zi* and completes it at *hai*, cycling day and night without end, ever pointing north—hence the name *Northern Dipper*. As for the *Southern Dipper*, it is merely the first of the northern lodgings among the Twenty-Eight Constellations and cannot compare to the Northern Dipper. In recent times, people have been misled by the name *Southern Dipper*, depicting it in red and even placing it above the Northern Dipper—how grave an error!

“Others ask: The Dipper constellation lies within the degrees of the Twenty-Eight Constellations in the north. Why is it called the *Southern* Dipper? They do not realize that the Wall is in the north yet called the *Eastern Wall*, and the Well is in the south yet called the *Eastern Well*—this can be understood through reflection. How does this principle apply?”

The Patriarch replied: “Indeed, it is so!”

According to the *Zhou Tian Star Chart*, the armillary sphere, and both ancient and modern astronomical texts, none mention the Southern Dipper as positioned above the Northern Dipper, nor do they recognize the name *Southern Dipper* at all. This is merely a concept within Daoism, referring to the *Six Offices of the Southern Dipper*—perhaps hidden stars in the heavens, yet unverifiable through investigation. According to ritual texts, the *Secret Taboo Names of the Southern Dipper* state [text missing], attributing it to the Southern Pole, the jurisdiction of the *Vermilion Numinous Fire Department* and the *Fire Bell Office*. There is also the *Inner Taboo Names of the Southern Dipper*, which reads: *Zhana Banqu Dahei*—thus confirming the existence of the Southern Dipper. If one wished to erase it, what would become of the scriptures?

Dushi asked: The five planets and six luminaries exhibit transgressions such as wandering, concealment, encroachment, and violations, as well as anomalies like rebelliousness, proximity, and eclipses—these are truly tied to disasters, calamities, and misfortunes. Those who perform rituals to avert disaster and transcend calamity must make petitions regarding them. Petitions are permissible, but one must establish their lamps according to celestial patterns! According to the *Essentials of the Golden Register*, all lamps have their prescribed forms. Yet why is there no prescribed form for these lamps? It is not an omission. For *Rahu*, *Ketu*, *Ziqi*, and *Comet* are hidden luminaries in the sky—those are concealed, while these are manifest. What does this mean?

The Patriarch replied: For example, in the lamp pattern of the Northern Dipper, the Right Assistant Star is also a hidden luminary, and thus no lamp is established for it—there are only eight lamps. *Rahu* is the residual blackness of fire, *Ketu* the residual qi of earth, *Comet* the residual qi of metal and water, and *Ziqi* the residual blackness of wood. Now, if we maintain the lamps for the eleven luminaries, there is no need to establish lamps for these four—it suffices!

Dushi said: Before ascending, the Han Celestial Master told people: “If anyone brings two *dou* of rice, I will explain things for them, just as Confucius never refused instruction to those who offered even a bundle of dried meat.” Thus, he was called the *Master of the Dou of Rice*. Today, many cite the *Scripture of Salvation*, which states: “Noble adepts offer gold and treasures, pledging their hearts to the heavens in transmission.” Yet they still greedily accept bribes and demand the full array of altar rituals. Why? Because nothing is harder to relinquish than one’s own wealth—hence the saying, “Food is heaven, wealth is life.” Thus, requiring them to contribute gold and treasures, or display silk banners, is meant to test their willingness to part with what they find most difficult to give up, thereby revealing their sincerity. If greed arises in their hearts, they have already lost the original intent!

It is also said: In a single altar ritual, the memorial to the heavens is of utmost importance. If the officiant possesses the Way of communicating with the true and attaining the numinous, then every petition will reach its destination. Thus, at the beginning of the *Welcoming the True*, the *Proclamation of Admonition* is recited; after *Sending Off the True*, the memorial is burned. In recent years, after the *Welcoming the True* and the *Proclamation of the Memorial*, the memorial is instead brought out to the central courtyard to be burned. For instance, if the true are welcomed from the north, yet the memorial is proclaimed here, then taken out and burned—why? From this, it is clear that the officiant lacks the practice of *visualization*—this is certain!

The Patriarch said: The *Jade Mirror of the Numinous Treasure* states: The *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* should be dyed with *fei* color, with the taboo names of the Three Clarities inscribed on both sides, and the characters *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* written on the banner’s body. Today, though the color remains the same, the dimensions differ, the calligraphy varies, and it is named the *Treasure Banner for Translocating Spirits* at dusk—this is incorrect. Furthermore, in ancient methods, two banners were placed within the *Lamp Wheel of the Five Sufferings and Nine Hells*, and during the *Summoning*, they were positioned before the incense and music—these two banners served a purpose. Now, they are merely erected at the gate for decoration, ignorant of their use!

For example, the *Yellow Banner of the Grand Return in the Supreme Subtlety* has its proper banner form, and the *Numinous Banner of the Command of Wu Ying* has its own banner form. Yet today, none understand their significance, and whether they are banners or flags is scarcely distinguishable.

It is also said: According to the *Disciplinary Texts of the Yellow Register*, when the summoned souls of the deceased arrive, one should cultivate benevolent thoughts to deliver them, not weep sorrowfully to harm their spirits. The ritual master must issue strict warnings beforehand; if the warnings are not stern, it is a violation of the precepts. This is the true intent of delivering the dead. The natural human inclination is to cling to life and fear death—if one cannot equalize life and death, who can forget their own mortality? As long as a single thought of attachment remains, liberation is impossible. Thus, the Supreme Lord’s intent in delivering beings is first to shatter their fear of death. Yet today, not only do they fail to restrain sorrowful weeping, but they artfully feign grief, inducing tears to deepen confusion and delusion.

It is also recorded in the *Great Method of the Five Thunders of the Divine Empyrean*: The *White Memorial of the Three Heavenly Lords of the Three Primes* is one; the *Golden Writ of the Middle Prime* and the *Precious Proclamation of the Nine Heavens* is another; the *Register of Ascending the True and Delivering Life* and the *Talisman for Departing from Life and Death* is yet another. Though memorials, talismans, proclamations, and registers bear different names, they all serve the Supreme Lord’s purpose of delivering all beings. Yet today, the *proclamation* of *announcement* is confused with the *proclamation* of *official rank*, and the *White Memorial* along with the *Talisman of Ascending the True* are all included and bestowed upon the deceased. What use could they possibly have for these?

It is further said: The *Talismans of Salvation from Suffering and Longevity* possess immense efficacy. Since they are called *primordial talismanic commands*, how can they be treated lightly? Thus, the *Lu Zhen Official* must submit a petition requesting them, and upon their completion, they are secretly transmitted to the Three Officials and the Thirty-Six Prisons. Yet today, it is not so—their inscription is not preceded by a petition, nor is their completion followed by secret transmission. Moreover, they are handed over to others, and the high priest is not involved! The worldly tradition claims these two talismans possess great efficacy in delivering the dead, requiring one talisman per deliverance, whether ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand—all are tallied, and none dare be omitted.

I have privately observed that the white slips are but wood, and the red script but cinnabar. If mere white wood and red cinnabar could deliver the dead, then none beneath the Nine Springs would remain undelivered. Alas! Whether the divine is made manifest depends upon the person. If it is not the right person, the Dao does not operate in vain. Were all practitioners truly those who penetrate the real and comprehend the numinous, and possessed a sincere heart to aid the living and deliver the dead, then even a single talisman or slip would suffice to deliver ten thousand souls and more!

It is further said: According to the *Ancient Rituals of Petitions* and the *Continued Rituals of Petitions*, the formats of all petitions are provided so that later generations may have a standard to follow. Yet today, it is not so—a petition is copied in its entirety from an ancient text, not daring to alter a single character. If this were the case, then the ancients who submitted petitions must all have memorized the words within them—would this not have been an easy task? Submitting, prostrating before, preserving, and presenting a petition all share the same intent. If one cannot do so, then merely saying "burn the petition" would suffice! Instead, the task is delegated to the Generals, Talisman Clerks, Merit Officers, and Envoys, who are relied upon to transmit it.

When setting up an offering and presenting a petition, each has their own duties, so that they may focus. Thus, the mind is free of distracting thoughts, the body free of extraneous tasks, embracing the primordial and guarding the One. As the *Lu Zhen Official* said: "Seven days before the offering, nothing unrelated to the rite may be undertaken." Only then may it be performed. Yet today, it is not so—there are those who attend a funeral in the morning and perform a petition offering in the evening, those who submit petitions on behalf of their masters without changing the names, who do not select the proper day or time, do not distinguish directions, do not differentiate between dawn and dusk, and are ignorant of taboos. Such actions hasten misfortune from Heaven—how can one not be cautious!

Lin Boqian asked: May I inquire about the regulations and teachings?

The Patriarch replied: The sages of antiquity, recognizing the difficulty of entering the study of the Dao and the ease with which the worldly desires lead one astray, established texts on ritual regulations, precepts, and models to unify external conduct. They provided methods for concentrating the mind and fixing the spirit to rectify the heart and restore it, and techniques for refining qi and the primordial embryo to regulate diet. They also included offerings for invoking the real and expressing gratitude to cleanse transgressions. Only then did they proceed with study.

Those without learning reach the depths of ignorance, grasping at the repository of diminishing and further diminishing. When one aligns with non-action, the gates of deceit and cunning do not open, and the purity and harmony of tranquility can be attained. Thus, the scriptures speak of the Three Registers and Seven Grades.

The Three Registers are:
First, the *Golden Register Retreat*, which eliminates celestial disasters and protects and stabilizes the kingdom—used only by emperors.
Second, the *Jade Register Retreat*, which delivers the people, requests blessings, and expresses repentance—used only by empresses, consorts, and officials.
Third, the *Yellow Register Retreat*, which aids the living, delivers the dead, and rescues those suffering in the Nine Dark Prisons of the Earth—used by common scholars and the populace.

The Seven Grades are:
First, the *Three Sovereigns Retreat*, for seeking immortality and protecting the state.
Second, the *Natural Retreat*, for cultivating the real and studying the Dao.
Third, the *Highest Clarity Retreat*, for ascending to emptiness and entering the subtle.
Fourth, the *Instruction Retreat*, for averting disasters and healing illnesses.
Fifth, the *Mud and Ashes Retreat*, for repenting transgressions and requesting life.
Sixth, the *Illuminating the Real Retreat*, for delivering the souls of the Nine Dark Prisons.
Seventh, the *Three Primes Retreat*, for repenting sins before the Three Officials.

These various retreats may last one day and one night, three days and three nights, or seven days and seven nights, all in accordance with the ritual models. In all cases, they have their basis.

Thus, when exiting *qian* and entering *xun*, there are incantations for both exit and entry. When visualizing spirits and concentrating on the real, there are methods for both visualization and concentration. Whether sounding the ritual drum, contemplating the circular image, or summoning the attending guards and envoys of communication, one must be clear about the direction from which they emerge. When invoking the Supreme Perfected’s life-generating qi, one must manifest the place into which it enters.

The Dao resides in the human heart, yet external petitions are still necessary. Since one cannot yet achieve profound union, one must make it manifest through action. The human heart has no form, yet when set in motion, it creates boundaries. When boundaries are purified, the heart becomes clear; when the heart is clear, conduct becomes pure; when conduct is pure, one can commune with the spirits; when the heart is clear, one can comprehend the Dao of Heaven. Therefore, ascending the altar to make vows, presenting yellow petitions, and submitting memorials ensure that both heart and form are fully expressed, allowing the human and the divine to unite.

I have heard it said: "Ten thousand scrolls of cinnabar script are not as good as guarding the One." I also say: Ten thousand regulations and teachings are not as good as guarding the One. If one knows how to guard the One, then one can trace the branches to investigate the root, and from the coarse enter the refined. Otherwise, merely adorning the exterior with clamorous and ornate displays is like child’s play—one only drifts further from the Dao! How then can one penetrate the real and comprehend the numinous?

Lin Boqian asked: What about the rituals of offering?

The Patriarch replied: In ancient times, the way of communing with the divine placed sincerity and reverence first. Later generations, lacking sufficient sincerity and reverence, prepared objects to serve as ritual implements. If one were truly sincere and could prepare the objects, it might still be acceptable. Yet when the objects are not even prepared, the disrespect is extreme!

The scriptures say: "One may offer water and present flowers—what need is there for other things?" The scriptures also say: "Imitating worldly etiquette and dignity"—thus, all the offerings of today are sufficient if they are without shame. Otherwise, they are all irreverent—how can one not be warned?

The *Dushi* says: According to the *Jade Standards and Heavenly Statutes*, when setting up an offering, one must not present paper money to the Highest Perfected—this is a grave act of disrespect. Though there were funerary objects in ancient times, there was no paper money. Only by the end of the Han dynasty did paper money appear, and it was used to sacrifice to the ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms. How can it be used to offer to the Celestial Perfected?

Those in the world who are greedy for profit, even when their bodies have passed through the Great Yin, retain a single念. As the *Ten Thousand Lights Repentance* says: "What is lacking or deficient are all worldly treasures." Thus, the burning of paper money is meant to break this念.

It is further said: Among the regulations and teachings, there is a section on lighting lamps, which states that the Dipper revolves in the center of Heaven, truly governing the fortunes and misfortunes of humanity, and holding the power over life and death. Therefore, one must urgently submit a petition—there is none who does not respond.

Should one have the means to conduct a jiao offering, one ought to follow the rites of the Esoteric Jiao or the Hetu Jiao, supplicating according to one’s heartfelt prayers. Yet today, there are those who light lamps for the birthdays of temple deities, or who vow to light lamps due to illness—truly unaware of the profound efficacy of lighting lamps.

The Patriarch said: In this world, all transmit the name of the "Dong An," yet none know the reason for its name. According to ancient regulations, the altar was adorned with vermilion and bore the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, hence called the *Dong An*. All memorials and petitions were presented before it. Now, however, it is otherwise: merely a table is set, unadorned with vermilion—this may still pass; and precious offerings of texts are placed upon it—this, too, may pass. Yet worse, miscellaneous objects are heaped upon it, some taken from it to offer incense, others to recite invocations, all under the pretext of bringing them closer to the imperial presence. Yet Heaven hears from on high, and no voice is too distant to reach it. If one claims proximity to the imperial presence ensures reception, then are all other petitions truly unheard? How can one not know that the vastness of the void is filled with spirits, and that a single thought, once arisen, is known throughout the Three Realms—what distinction is there between far and near, high and low?

It is further said: At the beginning of the jiao rites, the rite of *chi shui* (commanding water) is performed to dispel impurities. Later generations, clinging to tradition without change, perform this purification only after three or nine days, at the start of the jiao. If so, then during those three or nine days, impurities remain undispelled—how can one then approach the Perfected? If one argues that once the images are arranged, no defilement remains, why then use *chi shui* at the start of the jiao? In my view, *chi shui* should be performed at the very beginning of all rites. When the environment is purified, the mind becomes clear; when the mind is clear, conduct is pure; when conduct is pure, one may commune with the spirits; and when the mind is clear, one may align with the Dao of Heaven. After commanding the water, one proceeds in order: offering incense, inviting the masters, and approaching the Perfected.

Zihu Xie Xiandao asked: What is the essential principle of *gang bu* (the Pace of Yu)?

The Preceptor replied: I have heard from my master that, in general, *gang bu* is mostly based on the five-step system of mutual generation and restriction, stepping like a cat or dog crouching like a snake. Advance five steps, retreat five steps; advance seven, retreat seven. The four directions follow the numbers of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. Only after assuming the serpent’s crouch may one strike. Observe how one stalks a mouse—it is the same. Thus it is said: "The shaman’s step is Yu’s step; Yu’s step is but five, yet it harmonizes the Five Phases, and with long practice, one ascends." Such is the case with the methods of the Eight Gates of Dunjia, Taiyi Liuren, and Gu Xu—all fundamentally rely on the manifestation of the step.

Nowadays, people tread upon the *kui* and tread upon the Dipper, yet how many know the great prohibitions that remain? As the scriptures say: "If you wish to ascend to the Perfected, do not offend the Perfected One." The Perfected One is the third star. It is also said: "If you wish to summon the spirits, do not block the Gate of Heaven." The Gate of Heaven is the Wenqu Star.

In all methods of stepping the Dipper, one must strictly avoid violating the celestial principles or transgressing the stellar regulations. If the feet cross horizontally, this is called "violating the celestial principles"; if the feet advance mistakenly, this is called "transgressing the stellar regulations." Should such violations occur, one must immediately bow at the head of the star and offer an apology—thus may it be resolved.

Ziju Zhao Mufu asked: "What is meant by the so-called Yin Dipper and Yang Dipper today?"
Master Du replied: "I received this teaching from my master: after the Winter Solstice, beginning from *Kui* is the Yang Dipper; after the Summer Solstice, beginning from *Qiao* is the Yin Dipper. Stepping the Yang Dipper first, then the Yin Dipper, is called 'Fire and Water Uncrossed'; stepping the Yin Dipper first, then the Yang Dipper, is called 'Water and Fire Crossed.' Nowadays, people consider starting with the left foot at the initial star and reciting from *Kui* to *Qiao* as the Yang Dipper, while starting with the right foot at the initial star and reciting from *Tan* to *Po* as the Yin Dipper. How mistaken! This is a baseless theory. The *Scripture of Flying Spirits to Visit the Dipper* states: 'Following the sequence is Yang; reversing it is Yin. From *Kui* to *Qiao* is following; from *Qiao* to *Kui* is reversing.' The essential point is simply this: 'If you wish to fly your spirit, do not offend the Perfected One, the third star.' All else is merely the *ding* step."

Boqian asked: "There are said to be five *La* days—what are they?"
The Patriarch replied: "The first day of the first month is Heavenly *La*, when the Five Emperors convene the Nine *Qi* in the Azure Heaven of the East—this is the day when the Primordial Spirit of the Heavenly Penetrating Capital opens the Yuan at the Supreme August Palace. The fifth day of the fifth month is Earthly *La*, when the Five Emperors convene the Three *Qi* in the Cinnabar Heaven of the South—this is the day when the Great Spirit of Swift Fire and Commanding Decree enters the Jade Clarity Palace of Divine Radiance. The seventh day of the seventh month is the *La* of Virtue and the Dao, when the Five Emperors convene the Seven *Qi* in the White Heaven of the West—this is the day when the Vice Marshal of Heavenly Strategy opens the Yuan to illuminate the Void Palace of Lingxu. The first day of the tenth month is the *La* of the People’s Year, when the Five Emperors convene the Five *Qi* in the Mysterious Heaven of the North—this is the day when the Great Marshal of Assisting Sagacity opens the Yuan at the Scarlet Heavenly Palace of Jingdan. The *La* day in the twelfth month is the *La* of Kings and Lords, when the Five Emperors convene the Myriad *Qi* in the Jade Capital of the Upper Realm of Xuandu—this is the day when the Great Marshal of the Dark Warrior opens the Yuan at the Harmonious Migration and Correction Palace. These five days are when the Five Emperors gather and the five spirits first open their palaces—thus they are called the Five *La*."

The Patriarch continued: "You have long heard of these ancient teachings. In the Han dynasty, Lu Jia served as the Jade Clarity Primordial Beginning Dharma Master, presiding over the immortals and perfected beings and governing the affairs of the Yellow Register Court."

Moreover, Xin Hanchen now serves as Commander of the Thunder Bureau, a fierce official with fangs like wolf’s teeth. Tao Hongjing of the Jin dynasty now oversees the Water Bureau of Penglai as its Inspector. Chu Suiliang of the Tang is now a Messenger of the Five Thunders. Yan Zhenqing now serves as Left Judge of the North Polar Expulsion-of-Evil Court, while Li Yangbing is its Right Judge. Li Bai is now the Pure and Leisurely Perfected of the Eastern Florescence Upper Clarity Bureau. Bai Letian is now the Long-lived Immortal Master of Penglai.

Among the female immortals, Wei Huacun of the Jin is now the Purple Void Primordial Lady, ranking among the Immortal Lords. Xie Ziran of the Tang is now the Perfected of the Eastern Ultimate. What manner of persons were these? How can one fail to emulate them?

The text further states: According to the *Divine Empyrean Jade Register*, one is called a "Primordial Destiny Perfected" when practicing the Orthodox Unity Dao, thereby refining one’s own primordial destiny to attain its truth. How can the common and vulgar take "Perfected" as an official title, brazenly misusing it—even to the point of submitting it in memorials? One must examine oneself and reflect: does one’s cultivation truly embody the conduct of a Perfected? If one lacks such conduct yet presumptuously adopts the title, the sin extends to nine generations, and Heaven’s pardon does not apply. One may only be called "Recipient of Such-and-Such Dharma Transmission," with lower ranks termed "Dharma Titles." Those without transmission titles are considered lay disciples upon ordination.

Xiandao asked: "Recently, I have heard of the *Yuantong* Dharma and have privately doubted it. Its talismanic seal is round on the outside and square within, with the Five Phases at its center and the Eight Trigrams surrounding it. The provincial and prefectural bureaus are arrayed at the four directions, taking the four characters *Lingbao Yuantong* as its宗 and *Hunhua Xuanmi* as its root. It cobbles together various talismans, diagrams, incantations, and mudras into a single system, calling itself the *Great Yuantong Dharma*. Does the Perfected Master approve of this?"

The Master replied: "The spirit has no fixed form, hence it is called *yuan* (round); *qi* has no fixed substance, hence it is called *tong* (penetrating). The ancient teaching of *yuantong* refers to the blending of spirit and *qi*, emerging and entering the formless, returning to primordial chaos. If one now reduces it to shapes, instruments, trigrams, and numbers, how far removed is this from the true *yuantong*?"

The Patriarch said: "The Celestial Master of Han once declared: 'If one can purify the six senses and still the square inch of the heart, practicing this over time, one may sit and command ghosts and spirits, summoning wind and rain.' Yet today’s students of the Dharma do not root themselves in the Dao or trace their lineage to the heart. Each becomes his own master, each household its own school. They regard spirit-attachment as marvelous and dream-visions as sublime. The officers they summon number in the hundreds and thousands, while the Dharma ranks they confer include 'Perfected' and 'Envoys.' Some mix shamanic techniques with orthodox methods; others claim secret transmissions from spirit-writing. When questioned, they reply that it accords with the statutes; when challenged, they insist it is true transmission. Alas! The errors of false masters are not the fault of sentient beings—one blind man leads the blind, delusion begets delusion. How lamentable!"

Dushi, discussing the matter of talismanic water with Zishu, remarked: "Those who seek it are not always devout; some merely test it. Even so, I test them in return by granting their request, yet it often proves ineffective."

The Patriarch, upon hearing this, said: "One must not respond to their pretense with sincerity. Whether it proves efficacious or not is another matter."

The Patriarch further declared: "Do not ask whether it is numinous or not, whether it is efficacious or not. Simply act as the hand moves, without entertaining any thoughts."

Dushi said to Boqian: "Your Patriarch presided over the Azure Mushroom Retreat; I now oversee the Crane Forest Retreat; you currently govern the Purple Radiance Retreat. In general, those who uphold the Dharma must establish a site for incense offerings and petition for the name of a retreat. Such was the case with the Celestial Master of Han’s Twenty-Four Treaties, the ancient Thirty-Six Retreat Huts, and Xu Jingyang’s Seven Retreats. The statutes of retreats and treaties state: 'For lay households, it is called a *jing* (retreat); for masters, it is called a *zhi* (treaty).'"

The Patriarch said: "The establishment of altars and the holding of jiao rites are, in essence, one and the same. When discussing this, one might say: 'On such a day, Heaven is free of floating dust, the Four *Qi* shine clearly, rivers and seas are still, mountains and peaks swallow mist, the sun and moon cease their motion, the celestial pivot halts its wheel. Above and below are opened and connected, the Two Modes harmoniously interact.' At such a time, the hundred spirits and host of Perfecteds gather in hidden communion. Thus, during the jiao rites, this is the ideal state. Yet when presenting memorials and invoking the Perfecteds, even if the weather is not so perfect, resonance may still occur. If the purpose is to deliver the deceased and ferry souls, it may require overcast and rain. If the aim is to dispel calamities and avert misfortune, it may require clear skies. All jiao rites are conducted accordingly."

Dushi said to Xiandao: "I once heard from my master: 'Laozi has Three Treasures: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to put oneself first in the world.' Xu Jingyang has Eight Treasures: loyalty, filial piety, integrity, prudence, magnanimity, tolerance, and forbearance. Lü Dongbin has Four Treasures: first, no recklessness; second, no greed; third, utmost sincerity; fourth, holding to the One. Chen Niewan has Five Treasures: first, wisdom; second, trustworthiness; third, benevolence; fourth, courage; fifth, solemnity. To adapt to circumstances with many changes, leaving others unable to fathom one’s intentions, is called wisdom. To focus the mind and hold steadfastly to the One without wavering is called trustworthiness. To aid others and benefit things, always acting with leniency and forgiveness, is called benevolence. To act decisively and maintain a resolute heart is called courage. To refrain from frivolous speech, carrying oneself with gravity and restraint, is called solemnity.

The Eastern Barbarian Thunder is benevolent, capable of wind and rain, nurturing the myriad things. The Southern Barbarian Thunder is courageous, clarifying commands, rewarding good and punishing evil. The Western Barbarian Thunder is solemn, restraining primordial *qi* and striking with thunder to rouse all beings. The Northern Barbarian Thunder is wise, lying hidden in the Kan position, rising when the time is right. The Central Barbarian Thunder is trustworthy, lying dormant through the four seasons, never issuing commands recklessly."

This is the marvel of mind-to-mind transmission. Within the real resides the divine; beyond sincerity, there is no method.

The Patriarch said: A piece of wood the size of a handspan, placed upon the ground, allows a person to tread upon it with ease, yet a piece of wood the size of a square foot, placed at the end of a pole, causes a person to hesitate and falter. It is not that the objects differ in size, but rather that the mind harbors emptiness or fullness.

When a fierce tiger strides, the grasses and trees lie flat; when a venomous snake rages, the earth and stones are overturned. This is because when the spirit is whole, its power is great, and when essence is complete, its *qi* is mighty.

The archer who resembles a tiger sees only the tiger and not the stone; the one who slays the violent flood-dragon sees only the dragon and not the water. At such moments, the eyes see what they should not see, and the ears hear what they should not hear—this is the way of employing spirit through form.

When the mind does not doubt the hand, and the hand does not doubt the brush, only after forgetting both hand and brush does one grasp the way of calligraphy.

To sweep away filth, one must summon the *qi* of the Five Emperors; to subdue vipers, one must command the essence of the Five Stars. If the summoned and commanded do not arrive, how can one accomplish anything?

Spirit is like a mother, and *qi* is like a child. To summon *qi* with spirit is to summon a child with its mother—how could it dare not come?

Master Du said: There was once a poem by a high monk:
*A pond of lotus leaves, endless as robes,*
*A few pines with yellow needles, food in abundance.*
*Just as the world learns of my dwelling,*
*This mountain monk moves his abode again.*

Later, a cultivator of immortality also composed a quatrain:
*When hungry, I dine on the saliva beneath my tongue and am full;*
*When cold, the fire from my cinnabar field warms me.*
*I carry with me a poor man’s livelihood—*
*Better to seek within myself than to seek from others.*

These two poems may serve to slightly purify the turbid schemes of body and speech.

The Patriarch said: The cultivator of the real establishes resolve with sincerity, conducts affairs with bitter perseverance, penetrates insight with concentrated thought, and forgets the self to merge with the true.

If one can do this, the scripture says: *The cosmos is in your hands, the myriad transformations are within your body.* It also says: *If a person can always remain pure and still, heaven and earth will all return to them.*

The world may not understand this, but if one can attain stillness amid clamor, clarity amid turbidity, view all with equanimity, and sever all thoughts—moving without obstruction, obtaining the great elixir of peace—this is called the Dao.

If not, gazing at the stars and worshipping the Dipper may suffice; reciting scriptures and chanting incantations may also suffice. I know not which is better!

He also said: I have heard from my former master that the ancient immortals and sagely worthies transmitted teachings mouth-to-mouth, without relying on written words. Now, in this world, I record them in writing. Those who awaken may transmit the sagely way; without awakening, there is no attainment—those who awaken attain for themselves.

To attain the sagely way is to be without past or present. Its departure is not of the past, its arrival is not of the present. What can be transmitted is called the affair, not the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally untransmittable; the Dao has no sound or color, no form or appearance, no past or present, no coming or going.

He also said: Performing rituals is like serving as an official; cultivating the Dao is like living in seclusion.

Another day, a guest asked about the Twelve Divine Officials, and so an explanation was provided:

The Celestial Stem of *Tiangang* belongs to *chen* (辰). *Chen*, *xu* (戌), *chou* (丑), and *wei* (未) are called the Four Uprights, as they belong to earth and reside in the center, hence the name Four Uprights. The character *gang* (罡) is composed of *si* (四, four) and *zheng* (正, upright), and since *chen* is earth, this divine official is called *Tiangang*.

*Taiyi* belongs to *si* (巳). *Si* is the Gate of Thunder, also called the Gate of Wind. The Water Mouth is also the position of the Nine Heavens’ *Taiyi* Ten Spirits, hence this divine official is called *Taiyi*.

*Shenguang* belongs to *wu* (午). *Wu* is the brilliance of *li* (離), not originally *Shenguang* but *Tengguang* (腾光, soaring light).

*Xiaoji* belongs to *wei* (未), and *Daji* belongs to *chou* (丑), both noble spirits of heaven. *Jia* (甲), *wu* (戊), and *geng* (庚) are the Three Celestial Marvels, and since oxen and sheep are esteemed, *Daji* and *Xiaoji* are both auspicious spirits.

*Chuansong* belongs to *shen* (申). *Shen* is *kun* (坤), and *kun* is the Earth Gate. The Earth Gate is clouds, which gather clouds above in the heavens, hence the name *Chuansong* (传送, transmitting messages).

*Congkui* belongs to *you* (酉). The *cong* (从) is pronounced in the falling tone, meaning "to follow." It is so named because it resides beside *xu* (戌) and *kui* (魁), hence *Congkui* (从魁, following *Kui*).

*Hekui* belongs to *xu* (戌). *Xu* and *hai* (亥) are the source of the Milky Way, and *xu* is the Celestial River, hence this spirit is named *Hekui* (河魁, River Chief).

*Dengming* belongs to *hai* (亥). *Hai* is the Heavenly Gate.

*Shenhou* belongs to *zi* (子). *Zi* belongs to *kan* (坎), and *kan* is the Yin Queen, the Heavenly Queen, hence *Shenhou* (神后, Divine Queen).

*Yin* (寅) is *Gongcao*. *Yin* is *gen* (艮), and *kun* (坤) and *gen* are both earth. *Gen* is the mountain, *kun* is the earth, and as mountains and marshes communicate *qi*, *gen* and *kun* gather clouds. Thus, *yin* and *shen* (申) are the divine officials of *Gongcao* (功曹) and *Chuansong* (传送).

*Dachong* belongs to *mao* (卯). *Mao* is thunder, and the thunder spirit is called *Tianchong* (天冲, Celestial Thrust). As the *Scripture of Salvation* says: *Hurl fire ten thousand miles like lightning, let the flowing bells resound like the Eight Thrusting Thunders.*

Though these are the Twelve Divine Officials, they are in truth the aides-de-camp of the Heavenly Emperor.

*End of the Second Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of Master Haiqiong the White Realized One*

*Beginning of the Third Scroll of the Recorded Sayings of Master Haiqiong the White Realized One*

The disciples Yanhu Ye Guxi and others recorded this:

**Ascending the Hall at Mount Wu Yi**

This single stick of incense—
its sprouts budded before the division of primordial chaos,
its branches and leaves flourished at the dawn of the Dragon Han kalpa.
Where yin and yang are not yet, earth-dragons coil and tiger-crouch;
beyond the bounds of heaven and earth, rain scatters and wind blows.
On Kunlun’s peak, the medicine bears no flowers;
by the Hua Chi’s waters, the tree casts no shadow.
Thick smoke is not of color, yet it suffuses the Gate of the Supreme Clarity’s crown;
auspicious mist makes no sound, yet it transforms into the nostrils of the Primordial Beginning.
When raised, demons’ guts shatter;
when kindled, the pipes stir and winds wail.
Only then does one realize:
Śākyamuni himself planted and tended it,
Confucius, without intent, passed it by—
the undivided *qi* of the Great Ultimate,
the deathless root of empty space.

Now, burning it in the censer,
we reverently offer it to the former sages and former masters,
to those who speak and exhale the Dao.
We pray above for the One Man’s felicity,
that the ten thousand states may all be at peace,
the Six Treasuries perfectly ordered,
the Hundred Offices timely and harmonious.
May all within heaven and earth become the sacred precincts of the Great Net,
may every mountain and river be transformed into the Jade Capital of the Dark Metropolis.

If there be any true Dao-seekers,
any lofty scholars who know constancy,
whose knots of doubt remain uncut,
whose locks of wisdom stay unopened—
let them see with the same single eye as sages and commoners,
let the wise and foolish alike open their thirty tongues to ask.

This is what is meant by:
arraying the Three Mysteries’ halberds and armor,
deploying the Eight Extremes’ bows and spears.
To see what is right and not act—
what courage is there in that?

**Tian Gu asked:** The Great Dao originally has no name—why then are there lead and mercury?

**The Master replied:** That which reveals the form of the formless is the Dao’s dragon and tiger;
that which discloses the name of the nameless is the Dao’s lead and mercury.

**He further asked:** Among the five metals, silver is extracted from lead; among the eight stones, mercury is drawn from cinnabar. How does this apply to the refinement of the inner elixir?

**The Master replied:** The silver within lead, the mercury within cinnabar—
the heart within the body, the yang within yin.

**Xue Yan asked:** Medicinal substances have floating and sinking, clarity and turbidity;
fire phases have withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat.
Their operation lies in host and guest,
their flourishing and waning in punishment and virtue.
How is this principle to be understood?

**The Master replied:** All day long one gathers the great medicine—
where does one distinguish floating from sinking?
All day long one tends the fire phase—
who knows advance from retreat?
When the Five Agents are complete, there is no mutual conquest;
when the Four Images are harmonized, there is no host or guest.

**He further asked:** The waxing and waning crescents, the metal count and water count—
two eights make sixteen, forming one catty.
From which direction is the medicine gathered?
In which place is it refined?

**The Master replied:** The waxing crescent is the metal count, the waning crescent the water count—
gather one catty, refine one catty.

**Xi Weng asked:** What you have taught is the Great Dao itself,
yet what your disciples transmit is the study of the golden elixir.
I do not yet understand: are the Great Dao and the golden elixir the same or different?

**The Master replied:** To cross the river, one needs a raft;
upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer required.

**He further asked:** In the study of the golden elixir,
the medicinal substances come first,
and the operation of the medicinal substances depends on the fire phase as essential.
What are the medicinal substances?
What is the fire phase?

**The Master replied:** The medicinal substances are yang within yin;
the fire phase is yin within yang.
Grasp the purport of yin and yang,
and the great medicine is fully expounded in one place.

**Gu An asked:** True lead, true mercury,
true tiger, true dragon—
what are these things?
Ding Gong, the Yellow Dame,
the Infant, the Radiant Maiden—
what are their uses?

**The Master replied:** If you understand the original Three-Two-One,
if not, you remain with the old One-Two-Three.

**He further asked:** Lead originally belongs to the north—why is it called "metal lead"?
Mercury originally belongs to the south—why is it called "wood mercury"?

**The Master replied:** The maiden dons a blue robe,
the young lord wears a white silk sash.

**Xiao Quan asked:** The dragon’s roar, the tiger’s howl—
these are not between mouth and nose;
the husband’s chant, the wife’s response—
these are not within heart and kidneys.
If mercury is not *li*, lead is not *kan*,
*dui* is not the tiger, *zhen* is not the dragon—
then where, amid this maze of confusion, may I seek the elixir’s secret?

**The Master replied:** Do not idly imagine *kan* and *li* as heart and kidneys,
do not vainly seek *zhen* and *dui* in lungs and liver.
Once you comprehend the two words yin and yang,
naturally the husband and wife, tiger and dragon, will coil together.

**He further asked:** Saliva, nasal mucus, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and humors—
Zhongli Quan says these belong to yin.
Nasal mucus, saliva, essence, blood, brain, *qi*, and spirit—
Wang Ding’s mercury is the Seven Returns.
How is this principle to be understood?

**The Master replied:** Only when you quarry stone do you meet jade.

**Mo An asked:** Before the golden elixir is completed, how can there be dragon and tiger?
After the golden elixir is completed, how can there be no dragon and tiger?

**The Master replied:** At first, there is a thing yet no one recognizes it;
in the end, there is no form yet it is known where it abides.

**He further asked:** The whole hall is filled with guests—
who is the master?

**The Master replied:** One word, two words—weighty indeed;
even a thousand sages cannot bear it.

**Yan Hu asked:** The Way of the golden elixir—
in the *Yi*, it is *qian* and *kun*, *kan* and *li*;
in heaven, it is the Dipper and the Winnowing Basket, sun and moon;
in the elixir, it is dragon and tiger, water and fire;
in the medicine, it is lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury;
in man, it is husband and wife, male and female—
all reduced to the two words yin and yang.
I have already understood this!
But what is meant by the "true soil of the Great Ultimate"?

**The Master replied:** A thousand peaks rise until they reach the mountains’ edge and halt;
ten thousand crashing sounds return to the sea and vanish.

**Qianyun asked:** For one who wishes to refine the golden elixir, one must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply fathom the workings of creation, then pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures within the Primordial Palace, gather the five phases, and harmonize the four images. What, then, is the essence of the golden elixir?

**The Master replied:** "Gold" is heaven’s release of its killing mechanism;
"elixir" is emptiness containing form.

**He further asked:** The Great Dao is originally without thing—how can it be compared?

**The Master answered:** To speak of rivers does not quench thirst.

**He further asked:** The Great Dao is fundamentally one principle—why then are there distinctions?

**The Master answered:** To draw a cake does not satisfy hunger.

**He further asked:** May this be likened to jade still hidden in stone, suddenly gleaming today?

**The Master answered:** The pure wind and bright moon—both sages and commoners partake of their grace.

**Chigang said:**
The Great Dao is formless, the great elixir colorless;
in movement, stillness; in stillness, movement—movement and stillness are thus.
Without, there is being; within being, there is nothing—being and nothingness are silent.
If you grasp this, there is fundamentally no delusion or awakening;
if you fail to grasp it, the eye sees only sages and mortals.
Thus, Wei Boyang’s "river earth" and "mysterious maiden,"
Xu Jingsun’s "iron boat upon the water,"
Zhongli Quan’s "golden liquid returning elixir,"
Liu Haichan’s "true water of jade essence"—
all are like the moon’s waxing and waning, never leaving the water,
or clouds dispersing and gathering, never obstructing the sky.

**In conclusion:**
Thus, in former times, the Perfected One Xue of Piling fully penetrated the great matter of the Chan school, only to have the Perfected One of Apricot Grove pierce his nostrils—so it is said, a thousand emptinesses cannot trade for one reality.
Zhang Ziyang said: "All day walking, yet never walked; all day sitting, yet never sat." One may pity the child who does not recognize its own ugliness.
Today, has anyone in your walking and sitting encountered the *Wuzhen pian*?
Even if you have encountered the *Wuzhen pian*, you still may not recognize Zhang Pingshu.
All of you, like fish drinking water, know its warmth or coolness for yourselves—do you understand how the Perfected One Xue, having already mastered Chan, could yet bow his head to the golden elixir’s crucible?
If you pierce through this, there is no second Dao under heaven, no two minds in the sage.
If you fail to pierce through, then call your attendant once—when the attendant responds, the Master asks: "Did you eat congee this morning?"
The attendant replies: "I ate congee."
The Master says: "Good things do not fill a man’s belly."

**At the Pure Offering in Changzhou, after the incense was offered, the Master said:**
Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger;
mountains echo valleys, sound matches shadow—if you are a true listener, why fear revelation?

A monk asked: "Our teacher, Śākyamuni Buddha, was once the Immortal of Forbearance—how does being an immortal compare to being a buddha?"

**The Master answered:** Water flowing from beside the stone is cold;
wind passing through the flowers is fragrant.

The monk continued: "Then why does the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* say the ten kinds of immortals do not attain true awakening? What of that?"

**The Master answered:** The red wheel shines brilliantly—what can it do for the upturned basin?

The monk continued: "Why did Fu Dashi say, 'Though one passes through eighty thousand kalpas, in the end one falls into emptiness and perishes'?"

**The Master answered:** All that is conditioned is illusion; only the formless is true.

The monk continued: "Are the Four-Fruit Immortals and the Five-Penetration Immortals the same or different?"

**The Master answered:** All faces are alike—it is man who makes them so.

The monk continued: "Ultimately, how do immortals compare to prajñā?"

**The Master answered:** True silk does not exchange for gold.

The monk continued: "Then what of the differences between the Old Barbarian and Old Cong—who is superior?"

**The Master answered:** In the end, water must flow to the sea;
in the end, clouds must seek the mountains to return.

The monk continued: "If so, then a single drop of ink makes dragons in two places."

**The Master answered:** The goose-king selects milk—pure, not of the duck-kind.

The monk continued: "Does this allow a true adept to break through the barriers here?"

**The Master answered:** The shrimp leaps but cannot escape the dipper.

The monk bowed in reverence.

A Daoist asked: "To know the fire’s timing and its mysterious workings, one must discuss it in detail with the immortals."

**The Master answered:** I have heard of Pan riding his donkey backward.

The Daoist continued: "The sovereign’s fire, the minister’s fire, the people’s fire, the wildfire, the celestial fire, the mao-you fire, the Big Dipper’s fire—ultimately, what is the fire-timing of the Great Elixir?"

**The Master answered:** The golden crow sinks in the west;
the jade hare rises in the east.

The Daoist continued: "The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire."

**The Master answered:** Do not blame the heavenly mechanism for leaking—
it is all because scholars are greatly deluded.

The Daoist continued: "When sentient beings have not awakened, how does one point out their delusion?"

**The Master answered:** Have you seen the tongueless man speak?

The Daoist continued: "If so, then in the beginning, all those who worked at it saw it, but only when it comes to non-doing do the many begin to know."

**The Master answered:** Within the indistinct, they meet;
within the boundless, there is transformation.

The Daoist continued: "Is this what is meant by ‘with ashen heart, one treads water and fire; within stillness, one gathers true lead’?"

**The Master answered:** The white deer can fly in its steps;
the dark turtle understands how to secure its form.

The Daoist continued: "From this, one knows that within the medicine there is fire, and within the fire there is medicine."

**The Master answered:** What is your honorable surname, my friend?

The Daoist did not answer, bowed, and departed.

A Daoist priest asked: "I have heard that the Golden Elixir and Great Medicine have three thousand six hundred gates, and that there are dozens of schools for nurturing life. Yet if the Great Dao is untransmittable, is there ultimately something that resembles it?"

**The Master answered:** Yes.

The Daoist priest continued: "What of the principle of the twin passes at the spine?"

The Master answered: "The head droops, the back bends—one stretch and life is pitied."

The Daoist continued: "How does one silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor?"
The Master answered: "Exhausting one’s gaze to fix upon the crown of the head—when has one ever dreamt of the Great Return Elixir?"

The Daoist continued: "What of the flying golden essence behind the elbow?"
The Master answered: "Do not mistake fireflies for the light of Mount Sumeru."

The Daoist continued: "When the two luminaries gather in the Hall of Brightness, what then?"
The Master answered: "What is so extraordinary between the brows? Why not turn the mind inward to illumine the Crimson Palace?"

The Daoist continued: "From the mud pill above to the coccyx below, with the three fields in between—where lies the marvel?"
The Master answered: "To depart from all extremes is called the marvelous Dao."

The Daoist continued: "Is this a matter of visualization?"
The Master answered: "No."

The Daoist continued: "Rinsing and swallowing, pressing and massaging, contemplation and retention, breath-holding and constriction—what is the ultimate outcome?"
The Master answered: "The ten-thousand-year pines of Mount Nanyue would split with laughter."

The Daoist continued: "What *is* it, then?"
The Master answered: "Eating rice and shitting—what is so difficult?"

The Daoist continued: "Is the Dao to be found in true yin and true yang?"
The Master answered: "If one can abide in constant clarity and stillness, heaven and earth all return to them."

The Daoist continued: "Why is it that whether moving with or against the current, heaven cannot fathom it, and whether right or wrong, people do not recognize you?"
The Master answered: "One chant, one drunkenness, one grain of the elixir."

The Daoist continued: "This may be said to be within everyone’s reach, each one perfected."
The Master answered: "Do not mistake yellow mud for gold."

The Daoist bowed in reverence.

A scholar asked: "That which cannot be seen is called *xī*; that which cannot be heard is called *yí*. Setting aside *xī* and *yí*, what is meant by ‘gazing upward, ever higher’?"
The Master answered: "A cloth towel at the tip of a hundred-foot pole."

The scholar continued: "What of ‘boring into it, ever harder’?"
The Master answered: "Clearly inscribed at the wine shop’s spring sign."

The scholar continued: "And when it appears before one?"
The Master answered: "To meet and not drink—one returns empty-handed."

The scholar continued: "What if it suddenly appears behind?"
The Master answered: "Even the peach blossoms in the grotto laugh at such a one."

The scholar continued: "And when the thought is fixed upon it?"
The Master answered: "The noble person guards their solitude—never for a moment may it be parted from."

The scholar continued: "This is what is meant by ‘all day like a fool.’"
The Master answered: "In the jar, one need not fear the turtle’s escape."

The scholar bowed in reverence.

The Master then raised his whisk, drew a circle, and said: "Three questions, three unanswered; four questions, four unknown. Now, wasting words and breath—it would make the five Mount Sumerus split with laughter."

The Master continued: "Earlier, a monk asked whether the Four Fruits Immortal and the Five Penetrations Immortal are the same or different. Such a question is peculiar to its time—do any of you now understand the principle of the Five Penetrations and Four Fruits?

The Five Penetrations: fish caught in a net;
The Four Fruits: rabbits running to market.
How laughable are those who covet the journey—
they return home without ever arriving.

Five Penetrations, ah! Four Fruits,
The *bǐng-dīng* lad comes seeking fire.
A bride rides a donkey, led by her former household—
like a monkey watching a water mill."

He struck his staff once, descended from the seat, and the assembly at Mount Lu rose.

The Master ascended the seat and declared:
"In the past, there was no Śākyamuni;
in the future, there shall be no Maitreya.
This bewilders all under heaven—
only a thief knows another thief."

A Daoist stepped forward and said:
"To see what is right and not act—
where is the courage in that?"

The Master replied:
"I thought you were a cold, hairy creature."

The Daoist bowed in reverence.

The Master asked:
"If you truly have doubts,
why not ask further?"

The Daoist inquired:
"What is the Supreme First Principle?"

The Master answered:
"Swiftly, swiftly, as in the command of the law."

The Daoist said:
"This bewilders all under heaven."

The Master replied:
"Were it not for the Five Lakes lacking Fan Li,
how would the staff and cane be bestowed upon King Wu?"

The Daoist asked:
"The *Scripture of Purity* states the Great Dao is formless—
why then does it give birth to heaven and earth?"

The Master answered:
"One night, the moon rises over the sea—
how many households lean upon their towers?"

The Daoist asked:
"The Great Dao is without emotion—
why then does it set the sun and moon in motion?"

The Master replied:
"Clouds come, and the mountain wears a hat;
wind rises, and the trees shake their heads."

The Daoist asked:
"If so, why does the nameless Dao
yet nourish the ten thousand things?
How is this principle to be understood?"

The Master said:
"Though no wind stirs, the lotus leaves sway—
surely fish are moving beneath."

The Daoist asked:
"Why does heaven tilt toward the northwest?"

The Master answered:
"Nüwa knit her brows in frustration."

The Daoist asked:
"Why does the earth sink in the southeast?"

The Master replied:
"Great indeed is ignorance of the source."

The Daoist asked:
"Fish take water as their life—
why then do they die within it?"

The Master said:
"At journey’s end, frost comes by night;
the traveler’s path crosses before the inn’s gate."

The Master added:
"If you doubt, observe the tides’ ebb and flow."

The Daoist asked:
"Are there not thirteen kinds of death?"

The Master replied:
"Why not also watch the moon’s waxing and waning?"

The Daoist asked:
"Are there not also thirteen paths to death through action?"

The Master answered:
"Six dice cast—red fills the board."

The Daoist said:
"Life and death are weighty matters,
impermanence swift—
what then is to be done?"

The Master replied:
"When the court is virtuous, spring is fair."

The Daoist recited:
"Blood shed for the emperor is useless—
better to seal one’s lips and pass the fading spring."

The Master said:
"Tai Lake spans thirty-six thousand acres."

The Daoist bowed and withdrew.

The Master then declared:
"Questions reach the sea’s transformation into mulberry fields;
answers wear away the stone of kalpas—
yet never once has the Supreme Dao appeared in dreams.
In the end, this will make the King of Sounded Words laugh aloud.
How then is this to be understood?
Hmph!"

No one knows this intent—it makes me recall Nanquan.

The Master then raised a case:
The Five Powers asked the Buddha, "The Buddha has six powers—why do I have only five?"
The Buddha said, "Which one do you ask me about?"

The Master then remarked:
"Great and small Śākyamuni—lightly toyed with by the Five Powers Immortal, truly inviting disaster upon mouth and eyes.
I ask you all: where is the flaw in the Old Man Śākyamuni?"

The Master offered a verse:
Śākyamuni, the Buddha of scripture, and the Five Powers Immortal—
his nostrils still lack half a side.
Last night at the fourth watch, the mountain spewed forth the moon;
the mud ox’s hole stirred the four directions of heaven.

The Master addressed the assembly:
From birth to death, it is ever this single thread.
I urge you to strip it away, each returning with pure clarity,
to become the master, to hold fast,
unwilling to dwell in cages, unresponsive to calls,
with the constant light manifest before you.
A thousand-fathom cliff stands sheer—
alone, towering, steep, and sheer,
perfectly round, radiant and bright.
Leaping from the precipice, one must willingly take it on.
Revived after annihilation, deceiving the sovereign is impossible—
can you bear the bitterness of thought?
Only when one can remain perpetually pure and still
do heaven and earth entirely return.
Thus it is said: heaven and earth share my root,
the ten thousand things share my body.
There is no suffering in the Way of quiescent extinction,
no action in the supreme task of cessation.

And how is this to be expressed?
One must not speak of dreams before a fool.

The Master ascended the hall and said:
All you many learners, listen to my proclamation—
it cannot be known by knowing,
nor recognized by recognizing.
If not let go for long,
it will be attained in days to come.

The Master ascended the hall and said:
Grasp it at once, and you understand;
if not, then let it rest.
Why is this so?
After a long silence, he said:
The mouth given by father and mother
will never speak for the child.

The Master ascended the hall and said:
Nothing in the world is difficult—
it all comes down to the heart’s lack of focus.
If there is truly no difficulty,
why then focus the heart?
If the heart is not focused,
a lifetime will not suffice.
What is the meaning of this?
A tiger watches the water mill.

The Master ascended the hall and said:
When the handless man wishes to throw a punch—what then?
When a filial son mourns his parents—what then?
When a starving dog sees a hot oil pan—what then?
If one knows the outcome, come share tea together.

The Master ascended the hall and said:
Gone without a trace,
pitying yet resenting him.
The cries of the cuckoo are heard—
falsely saying, "Better not to return."

The Master ascended the hall and said:
The void has blood,
chaos has bones,
thorns lie within rotting mud—
do you understand?
Slippery mud, slippery mud.

The Master ascended the hall and said:
Hearing of it brings wealth and honor,
seeing it brings poverty and destitution.
One says, "Poverty and destitution must not be my fate"—
yet a household of six thrives daily in the spring wind.

The Master ascended the hall and said:
Yesterday I lost the advantage—
Bodhidharma lacked a front tooth.
Today I gained the advantage—
Zhaozhou hung a gourd on the wall.
Hmph! Hmph!

The Master ascended the hall and said: *Ruo.* Then descended his seat.

The Master ascended the hall and said:
Rain like woven silk—
from where does the silk arise?
The Yangtze’s waters surge toward the vast sea—
what then?
After a long pause, he said:
Tell me—how many feet high are your brows,
how many yards wide your eyes?

The Master ascended the hall and said:
What place lacks refinement?
Then descended his seat.

At the Crane Assembly of Pingjiang, upon the offering of incense and the exchange of questions,
the Master said:
Enough of questions—for questions are endless,
and answers without end.
What use is this back-and-forth?
Even with eloquence like a cascading river,
how could it capture the subtlest glimmer,
or make fleeting words resemble the essential mystery?
Do you understand?
Before the division of primordial chaos,
what difference did the qi’s appearance hold?
Before your parents were born,
after a lifetime of seeking—
from the late Zhou onward,
across the three teachings:
Confucius had his three chariots and four steeds,
Laozi his three caverns and four auxiliaries.
The teaching of Confucius?
Nothing but the single word *sincerity*.
The teaching of Śākyamuni?
Nothing but the single word *stillness*.
Laozi’s teaching?
Nothing but *clarity and quiescence*.
As it is said:
*If one can abide in constant clarity and quiescence,
heaven and earth all return to him.*
In Confucius’ case, do we not see:
*I have gone whole days without eating, whole nights without sleep,
spent days in stupidity,
for three months without straying from humaneness—*
nurturing my vast qi,
mindful of this, ever present—
thus he often found himself empty.
How true!
For the scholar of the Dao,
how to place the ruler above Yao and Shun,
and restore purity to customs?
In Śākyamuni’s case, do we not see:
*Throughout the twelve hours of day and night,
the constant light appears before you,
like a wall standing ten thousand fathoms high,
like a hen brooding her eggs,
keeping warmth unbroken,
continuous and unbroken,
without interruption—*
then, standing at the cliff’s edge, stretching out your hand,
you would dare to take it on,
reviving after annihilation,
deceiving the sovereign is impossible.
How true!

For the scholar of Chan:
How is it that Linji enters the gate with a shout?
Truth does not lie in loud voices.
Deshan enters the gate with a staff,
striking the grass only to startle the snake.

In the case of the Old Master (Laozi), do we not see:
*Penetrating the mysteries of yin and yang,
profoundly grasping the workings of creation,
pursuing the two qi along the Yellow Path,
uniting the three natures in the Primordial Palace,
gathering the Five Phases,
harmonizing the Four Images,
dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl—
husband sings, wife follows,
jade crucible simmers,
golden furnace blazes.
When the seasonal cycle is complete,
the embryo transforms, the spirit transcends.
Achievement fulfilled, fame attained—
a body beyond the body.*

How true!

For the scholar of immortality:
How to lead the White Tiger home to nurture,
and give birth to a luminous pearl like the full moon?
After all, are the Three Teachings the same or different?
Who knows what era this tale speaks of?
Even now, the laughter never ceases.

The master continued:
*Days and months shuttle like a loom,
light and shadow fly like arrows.
Willow threads draw spring away,
lotus coins buy summer’s breeze.*
At court, the kitchen opens for bamboo shoots;
in Śākya’s lineage, waxen figures are shaped.
On the Ten Isles and Three Mountains, all are clouds and moon-tube builders;
across the Four Seas and Five Lakes, all are rain-hatted, mist-robed wanderers.
Amid endless dust, how many scattered sages?
Beyond the world, transcendent immortals dwell with mortals and saints.
Hidden or manifest, unfathomable—
their comings and goings unrecorded.

Closing the seat:
*In the fourteenth year of Jiading of the August Song,
when orchids marked the month and heaven’s harmony prevailed,
the lakes and mountains repaid their debt to Lin’an,
while wind and moon renewed their bond with Gusu’s green.
On the fourteenth day of the month in Gusu,
the fourfold assembly gathered for the Pure Yang Festival.
On this day the True Man of Pure Yang was born—
long ago, the "Record of Immortal Journeys at Piao Beach" told of it.*

I have heard that in the Tang, Lü Chunyang,
whose master was Zhongli, styled Yunfang,
personally transmitted the secret of the Golden Elixir and Returned Cinnabar.
When he attained the Dao, he wandered Jing and Xiang.
Do people still recognize Pure Yang?
*Crane’s neck, tortoise’s cheeks, body ragged and grimy.
Sometimes polishing mirrors in the marketplace,
sometimes selling ink on the street,
sometimes calling himself Tian, sometimes Hui,
from Jiangkou to Jingkou, he came and went.
Once he carried two jars past Mount Lu,
then played twin flutes on Tiantai.
Wearing a green hat and red robe, he drank to ruin,
sleeves hiding a green snake, awe-inspiring.
In Hongdu, he delivered Shi of West Mountain;
in Shuchuan, he delivered Shen of East Forest.
Morning in the Hundred Yue, evening in the Three Heavens—
form and spirit gathered and dispersed, now present, now absent.
In a teahouse, he transmitted to Guo of Shangzao;
in wine, he transformed He Xiangu.
Sometimes clad in white silk, sometimes in paper robes,
a sword slashing the sky, tumbling again and again.
Laughing loudly, he returned to Mount Touzi,
a single phrase exposing the old man of Huanglong.
In Taiping Temple, he once left a poem—
three visits to Yueyang, who knows?
At dusk, he brushed his sleeves and left Wuyi;
at midnight, he played with the moon on Junshan.
Drunk, he sang wildly, dancing as he sang—
a game of evening chess, how many ages now?
On Yellow Crane Tower, in clear wind and bright moon;
on Peng River’s shore, among white duckweed and red reeds.
That year, after drinking a single dose,
who would believe a child was nurtured in nothingness?
The Eighteen Methods of the Perfect Art remain,
yet he would not lightly speak them to others.
Thrice he sighed at failing the examinations,
declaring his father was Lü the Remonstrator.
In his bag, auspicious herbs—no silver for medicine.
Beyond the heavens, he wandered, riding the sword’s qi.
The master’s sword technique was untransmitted,
a thousand changes, ten thousand transformations, ever sudden.
Heaven sent him to save living beings,
for in the fourth month, Pure Yang’s hexagram belongs to Qian.
Taking the Kan trigram’s line to fill Li’s belly,
it becomes pure Qian, yang qi fulfilled.
Thus he could ride qi and transform into a flying dragon,
wherever he went, delivering people, leaving wondrous traces.*

This assembly in Pingjiang differs from others—
this year, especially, is unlike the past.
In former years, when the gathering was held,
clouds parted and cranes soared in the sky.
Now, a rustic ascends this seat—
I must begin by breaking it open from the start.
You must grasp the heart of Pure Yang
before you can learn the Dao of Pure Yang.

The Dao that can be spoken—how to learn it?
Scooping earth for incense is not yet the truth.
Only a true knower like Zhang Tianjue understands.

**Minor Address at the Eastern Tower**
Recorded by the disciple Zijuzi Zhao Jiang

The Supreme Dao resides in the heart—
the heart itself is the Dao.
Within and beyond the six senses,
the same wind and light prevail.
If inner things shift,
aging and death will come.
Silent circulation of primordial harmony—
this is how to attain longevity.

Thus the body takes the heart as its lord;
the heart is the abode of spirit.
When the heart is at peace, the spirit is numinous;
when the heart is wild, the spirit is mad.
Empty the heart, and true qi congeals;
calm the heart, and yang harmony gathers.
Blood and qi unobstructed, naturally flowing;
will and intent at ease, the myriad disturbances cease.

When the heart grieves, yin qi congeals;
when the heart rejoices, yang qi scatters.
Thoughts arise, and the spirit flees;
thoughts cease, and the spirit rests.

In this human body,
the heart’s spirit
emerges through the eyes to see—
seeing long, the heart’s spirit departs,
not lost to greed but to exhaustion.
The kidneys’ essence emerges through the ears to hear—
hearing long, the kidneys’ essence withers,
not ruined by lust but by depletion.
The liver’s hun emerges through the nose to smell—
smelling long, the liver’s hun scatters,
not harmed by anger but by dissipation.
The gallbladder’s po emerges through the mouth to speak—
speaking long, the gallbladder’s po dies,
not destroyed by impatience but by exhaustion.

The essentials of the Supreme Dao:
Utmost stillness to congeal the spirit,
profound reflection to penetrate perception,
fasting and abstinence to respond to the true,
compassion and kindness to complete merit,
humility and gentleness to preserve sincerity.

Let the heart be free of杂念,
the intent not stray outward.
Let the heart constantly return to unity,
the intent naturally thus.
With the heart serene,
the four great elements are at ease.

If the heart is not in the ears, what makes sound?
If the heart is not in the eyes, what makes color?
If the heart is not in the nose, what makes fragrance?
If the heart is not in the mouth, what makes speech?

Qi gathers, and one is full;
spirit harmonizes, and one is warm.
Thus the heart of the Dao is the master of qi,
qi is the root of form,
form is the dwelling of qi,
and spirit is the tool of form.

Spirit is nature,
qi is life.
When the heart is still, qi is upright;
upright, it is whole;
qi whole, spirit harmonizes;
harmonized, it congeals.
Spirit congealed, the ten thousand treasures coalesce!

Shi Jianwu says: When qi abides, spirit abides;
when spirit abides, form abides.
One must forget the passions to preserve one’s nature.
Nature preserved, form is naturally whole;
qi is also whole,
and the Dao is necessarily whole.
The Dao whole, spirit flourishes,
qi becomes numinous,
form may transcend,
nature may be fully realized.
Circulating without cease,
it unites with the Dao as one.

Above from the Celestial Valley,
below to the Yin Stem,
the two luminants meet,
forged into a single mass.
Thus, over time,
without the slightest interruption,
transformation lies within me,
and I merge with the Dao in truth.

Some ask: When the heart moves, spirit wearies;
when the heart is still, spirit grows dull.
Neither movement nor stillness suffices—
what then is to be done?
Like Xi Shi departing the golden palace,
fair as Yang Guifei descending the jade tower,
day after day, drunk with you amidst the blossoms—
what place is not filled with grace?

Moreover, the true master taught a gatha to the disciple:
In a three-household hamlet, old Auntie Huang,
turning over at midnight, lost her pillow,
and struck her husband’s nose—
the next morning, up she rose to search for her hairpin.

Hmph!
The spring man drinks spring wine,
the spring rod strikes the spring ox.

The disciple asked: "Is this not the principle of returning to the root and restoring the mandate?"

The master replied: "The mouth your parents gave you will never speak for your child."

The disciple asked again: "What then is this principle?"

The master said: "Upon the iron steamed bun, apricot blossoms bloom red."

The disciple asked: "Might there yet be some resonance with this?"

The master said: "Yesterday at the street’s end, two firewood sellers had their front teeth broken by a man. Why do you cry injustice for them?"

The disciple exclaimed: "Ah! Just so!"

The master said: "Try to speak it yourself."

The disciple then recited:
*"Upon the iron steamed bun, apricot blossoms bloom red,
Four-sided, clear through, everywhere it flows.
Tread upon the scale’s weight—hard as iron,
Yet Shinra lies but east of the sea gate."*

**Winter Solstice Address**

Within the body, a treasure hides,
concealed in the cinnabar field,
light as dense mist,
subtle as drifting smoke.
Rising to the mud pill,
descending to the bubbling spring,
now gathering, now scattering,
now square, now round.
Vast as the sun’s wheel,
five-colored radiance gleams,
transparent within and without,
spiraling left and right.
Hard as iron,
soft as silk,
swift as lightning,
taut as a bowstring.
Weighing more than a pound,
it flies through the three thousand worlds,
entering earth when yin prevails,
ascending heaven when yang arises.
The golden elder gathers mercury,
the maiden nymph seizes lead,
timed and applied,
refined within.
After the winter solstice,
before the summer solstice,
the golden crucible boils,
the jade furnace blazes.
The dragon intones on the eastern peak,
the tiger roars in the western stream.
The yellow matron does nothing,
Old Ding remains silent.
Within the body, husband and wife,
cloud and rain in union.
Heavenly unity births water,
dwelling in the pure source.
Departing from the self, entering the other,
earth comes first.
Within earth lies fire,
its wonder transmitted heart-to-heart.
Like a dragon nurturing its pearl,
waves cradle the jade abyss;
like a hen brooding her eggs,
warmth lingers unbroken.
As lodestone draws iron,
so does nature connect.
The flower’s calyx holds the fruit,
the kernel’s qi remains whole.
The rice blossom forms the ear,
dew and elixir coalesce.
Yin and yang’s creation,
all things without bias.
Man and the ten thousand things,
neither fair nor foul at first.
Hold fast to the method,
and heaven and earth share your years.
To guard without guarding,
is as if one thing remains.
The returning wind blends all,
lush green grass thrives.
Within it, transformations—
a thousand sages, ten thousand worthies.
Beginning in the abyss,
ending in the heavens,
washing at dawn and dusk,
advancing and retreating, drawing and adding.
With civility and martial force,
molded and refined,
the sacred embryo complete,
a single arrow pierces the three passes.
Then set the river chariot in motion,
carrying water up the mountain.
The three corpses and six thieves,
their gall shattered, their hearts frozen.
A silver bowl holds snow,
one hue unites all.
The gull enters the reeds,
the moon illumines Kunlun.
The jade vessel cradles ice,
and the great return is achieved.
Crow flies, hare runs,
creation at ease.
Golden liquid refines the form,
the mysterious pass roots the essence.
The jade talisman guards the spirit,
the crimson palace nurtures the primordial.
By day, the spirit banner moves,
the qilin spurs the steed.
By night, the fire mushroom gestates,
a golden lotus blooms.
A single thunderclap,
and man resides in the crown’s gate.
Ten thousand miles of azure sky,
a single wheel of toad-light.
Shift the furnace, change the crucible,
from child to grandchild.
Attaining the Dao, the body dissolves,
an earthbound immortal.
Merits complete, conduct fulfilled,
the body ascends on purple clouds.
Spirit merges with the Dao,
the Dao unites with the mysterious origin.
Congeal emptiness, refine stillness,
transcend the four dhyanas.
Leap beyond the primordial chaos,
the dharmakaya knows no bounds.
This alone is the true mechanism—
why a thousand, ten thousand chapters?
A single word suffices,
ten months of reverent refinement.
Observe the celestial signs,
do not cling to the northern wilds.
The moonlit night feeds the serpent,
autumn dew quenches the cicada.
Day and night, twice six,
twelve revolutions of heaven.
Hold fast to these words,
concentrate the spirit, delve deeply.

**Entering the Chamber of the Western Grove**

A radiant pearl shines with dazzling light,
illuminating the three thousand great chiliocosms.
The mind of Avalokiteśvara in perfect samādhi,
the great perfect enlightenment of Śākyamuni Tathāgata.
Now like spring’s splendor adorning mountains and rivers,
now like autumn’s clarity refreshing cliffs and ravines.
It is also called the Ninefold Cyclic Elixir,
the medicine of immortality and deathlessness.
Step by step, the wondrous palaces of *Avataṃsaka*,
tier upon tier, Maitreya’s jeweled pavilions.
Walls, tiles, and rubble all merge and dissolve,
waterfowl and forests share the vast expanse.
The harelipped maiden rides the clay ox,
the lame wooden man mounts the paper crane.
The three karmas and three poisons drift like clouds,
the six senses and six dusts shimmer like the moon.
The reason for all this is the emptiness of the original nature—
who says it resembles anything from the beginning?

This pearl’s value is beyond all measure,
no clever awl may recklessly pierce it.
If you seek the great esoteric *dhāraṇī*,
search only within stillness and extinction.
How many sleeves have heard the thunder’s rumble?
How many Daoists hide the foot-long toad?
All wander blindly in search beyond the pearl,
unaware of that one primordial move.

That one move—
why add further footnotes?
Even footnotes are not without merit.
Well said, brothers!
The cuckoo’s cry follows the dawn rain,
the crabapple listens to the night wind’s fall.

**Building the Bell Tower at Western Grove for Universal Teaching**

Azure mist and purple haze lock the frosted pines,
a thousand-foot silver cascade pours down jade peaks.
The temple lies deepest among vines and creepers,
its people dwell amid water and stone in wondrous light.
Jasper towers and painted eaves where golden phoenixes soar,
jeweled halls and jade steps where dragons coil.
Who recognizes the old visage of the founding mountain?
A single mound in evening’s mist and rain, where bees hum at dusk.

The Western Grove Chan Monastery,
standing for over five hundred years.
From Master Hui’s founding to this forty-third generation,
sage after sage, then as now.
Abbot Pu’an, with a face like frost and snow,
a heart like wind and moon.
Like the spring crane on a lone islet or nine marshes,
like the autumn swan’s solitary shadow on a cold river.
Truly the descendant of Mo’an—
swallowing thorn and bramble whole.
Truly the heir of Caotang—
sitting unmoved in the demon’s palace.
Of late at Western Grove,
seventeen winters have passed in a single breath.
A thousand fingers gather, myriad affairs rise and fall,
restoring discipline, reviving ancient ways.
The vision vast and far-reaching,
the merit of the founding master established.
Yet how to withstand the hundred-foot night mirage,
the thousand-fathom morning rainbow?
Ants gnaw, worms bore,
and time wears all to ruin.
Wind and rain assail,
who dares to shield it?
Cast this bell—
ten thousand catties of iron and bronze.
Raise this tower—
a thousand logs of cedar and pine.
Bronze and iron may endure the years,
yet cedar and pine still harbor the three corpses’ worms.
The eaves’ corners pierce the sky, catching moon and shadow,
the wind chimes fall silent upon the earth.
Once broken, no thatch will cover it—
completion lies in a single instant.

Abbot Liaoran’s compassion,
Abbot Faying’s dharma radiance.
Raising his head, he grasps the bright moon,
opening his mouth, he swallows empty space.
Here, he plays with brilliance,
unfolds his wit,
takes a mass of red-hot iron,
chews and swallows it whole—
so that Mount Sumeru topples,
the seas reverse their flow,
Avalokiteśvara snaps her fingers,
the dragon maiden beats her breast.
Pu’an dares not conceal it—
he bids Yu Chan reveal this divine power,
speak this Chan entanglement,
utter this Daoist tangle.
Nanquan’s cat leaps,
Zhaozhou’s dog runs,
Tianhuang’s horse whinnies as it bathes.
A single stone, frost’s horn, the tiger’s roar,
Xuefeng’s venomous snake sings mountain songs,
for the water buffalo, he turns somersaults.
Hush these idle words and superfluous phrases—
they are no evening meal.
After all, how does one practice radiance?

The two masters must not misquote when meeting others.
Take gold, silver, lapis lazuli,
carnelian, agate, true pearls,
and other treasures—
load them fully and return,
then come to this final phrase.

The final phrase—
do you understand?
Stir the Tathāgata’s gate above,
what difficulty is there in raising a sky-reaching hand?
One day, look up from level ground—
its sound shakes half the sky with wind and cold.

**End of *Record of Master Haiqiong the White Real Man*, Scroll Three**
*(Note: A line may be missing before this sentence.)*

**Record of Master Haiqiong the White Real Man, Scroll Four**

**Cui Xu of Mount Luofu’s "Jade Pillow Chant"**

In the eighth month of the *renshen* year of Jiading,
Cui Xu the Daoist was on Mount Luofu.
Before his eyes, all things flowed away like water—
how could heaven and earth compare to a floating bubble?
I shall shed this form and return to the Jade Palace,
thus I impart the fire-phase secret of the golden elixir,
to Haiqiong the White Jade Toad of Qiongshan,
that he may deeply know the bones of creation.

Dharma Master Daoguang, Xue Zixian,
transmitted to me *Returning to the Root and Restoring Life*,
pointing to the two words "lead" and "mercury"—
the true mystery within the mystery.
Through ten months of toil,
gradually gathering, gradually congealing,
now my entire body is white blood,
and I feel the four seasons free of cold and heat.
Later, I went again to study with others,
examining countless wild fox spirits—
each unaware of the one true place,
all mere side doors, not the real.
Fearing you waste this youth,
I recount it all from the beginning.

Without the secret of the golden fluid returning elixir,
do not waste your spirit in vain.
Like the deluded who practice bedroom arts,
their hearts ever clinging to the chamber,
calling it "yin elixir" or "the art of the jade woman,"
pressing the perineum, inhaling and swallowing,
seizing others’ essence and blood to supplement their own,
clinging to the three peaks with perverse views.
They name the birth canal the "place of life’s origin,"
practicing nine shallow and one deep thrusts in repetition.
Xuanyuan, Pengzu, Lao Rongcheng,
Huanggu, Shouguang, Zhao Feiyan—
they have their own path to the heavens,
wandering through taverns and brothels, testing their arts.
Do not say you meet immortals among the flowers,
only to trade a golden hairpin for a tile.
The tree’s roots are already rotten, its leaves but vainly green,
the sea of qi churns—death comes swift as an arrow.

Other side doors may yet weave a net of bliss:
some practice qi absorption as the Central Yellow,
some guard the crown as the Primordial Chaos,
some circulate qi as the Precelestial,
some swallow saliva as the Numinous Spring.
Or they fixate on a point near the spleen,
insisting it is the root of breath—

Some take mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,
drawing in clarity and expelling turbidity to "return and restore."
Some silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor on High,
eyes upturned to guard the Mud Pill.
With these, they visualize qi’s ascent and descent,
calling it the "Spine-Enclosing Pass."
With those, they hold breath and swallow saliva,
naming it the "Elixir of Jade Liquid and Golden Fluid."
With others, they concentrate spirit below the navel,
or fix thoughts between the brows.
Some direct the mind to contemplate the spine,
others press the tongue to the roof of the mouth,
hunch shoulders, retract necks, arch backs—
all hailed as "direct entry to the Jade Capital Mountain."
The mouth becomes the Flowery Pond, the tongue a dragon,
dubbed "divine water flowing murmurously."

These are all side doors of blissful practice,
how can they hope to become heavenly immortals?
Nine parts inhaled, one part swallowed,
gathering qi to the navel, departing from fetal breathing.
Hands clutching prayer beads to count breaths,
water clocks and earthen gnomons to measure time.
Some follow the *Lingbao Perfect Methods*,
tucking tails to listen, swallowing saliva.
Some study the *Xishan Gathering of Perfected Records*,
facing walls in wordless silence all day.

Though men of this age learn to "sit in meditation,"
when has the moon ever illumined the cold pond’s jade?
Though they claim to "embrace the Origin,"
when have they ever been like jade hidden in stone?
Some say the Great Dao is fundamentally non-action,
sitting dry as ash, hearts hollow, solitary in silence.
Some claim to have already grasped the "already-accomplished,"
yet ask them—where is this illusory body obtained?

Still others toil in form to gather sun and moon,
calling it "heavenly hun and earthly po."
Others ingest the Seven Luminaries at midnight,
claiming it the "true bloodline of creation."
Some "fly golden essence from behind the elbow,"
qi steaming, water dripping.
Some "abandon true qi to the Great One,"
hearts darkly still, kidneys profoundly silent.
Some circulate a flowing pearl in cycles,
others in stillness visualize a vermilion orange.

All such are "life-nourishing methods,"
yet none can transform insubstantial into spirit.
The Dao’s essentials nurture the child within the void,
there lies the true and singular key.
All are but scattered fragments of the wondrous celestial mechanism,
hidden in alchemical texts, never revealed.
Pity the deluded fools who cling to their errors,
pointing to one another in mutual confusion.
These mad, possessed lot—
seated, they twitch and tremble for hours,
stretching, bending, arching in countless postures,
weeping, laughing, wailing like children at play.

For the square inch of the heart has no master,
qi scatters, spirit flies wild.
A throng of deluded men sing one another’s praises,
using this to deceive the vulgar and lure the foolish.
They know not how to unite with the Dao’s truth,
only how to join with demons in vain folly.
The moment the heart stirs, qi follows—
leaping, trembling, they call it "divine mechanism."
Some say, "This is yang qi arriving,"
others, "The dragon and tiger in battle."
Some claim, "The river chariot plies ten thousand markets,"
others, "Water and fire race in pursuit."
See how they agitate the five viscera’s qi,
until one day spirit and essence leak away, exhausted.

Of old, the Sage Ancestors left elixir formulas—
"from nothing, something" as the foundation of the cinnabar.
When did they ever display such demonic antics?
All are but lesser men, mere *icchantikas*.
I have heard that the sages of former ages,
within non-action accomplished all action,
from formlessness giving birth to true form,
without relying on visualization or forced practice.

Yet some brothers claim wonders stranger still:
"Heart and kidney are not Kan and Li,
liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, intestines, gall—
mere empty houses, old fences."
Saliva, mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood—
only aids to be used as stepping stones.
Spirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls, intent, qi—
seeming so, yet not so in truth.

Why peer inward or scrutinize form,
listen for numinous echoes or gaze at the abyss?
Swallowing mist, drinking dew, ingesting primordial qi—
effort wasted, hearts wearied, no effect.
Still they prattle of "clarity and emptiness, tending the furnace fire,"
demanding written pledges, extorting gold and treasure.
Daring to compare a frog’s well to the vast ocean,
claiming, "The Primordial Heavenly Worthy is none other than I!"
Vainly assuming titles, feigning divine powers,
commanding ghosts and gods, expounding cause and effect.
Today and tomorrow, they file petitions,
inner elixir, outer elixir—nothing is beyond them.
Deceiving the worthy, deluding the sagely, dimming the Three Luminaries,
they presume to foresee fortune and misfortune, trembling in awe.
Gathering disciples, they roam towns and villages,
drunk on wine, gorged on meat, forming packs like wildfire.

The Great Dao has always been free of names and forms,
true immortals are never adorned with flowers and grasses.
They preach vows and toil—
better you should toil yourself!
One man’s delusion might yet be endured,
but delusion passed on breeds delusion into old age.
These blind leading the blind,
all plunge into the path of confusion, suffering woe.
Suddenly, when fortune is exhausted and karmic retribution arrives,
they offend heaven—no prayer can save them.

Alas! The world delights in learning immortality,
but how many pursue truth as their true study?
Remember well the wise words of the ancients:
only with pure and mature effort does speech become immortal.
Unclear speech marks no kin,
unripe effort bears no fruit.
I once practiced for a year—
the six pulses stilled, qi returned to the root.
A child appeared within the cinnabar field,
its form and features like my own.
Looking back on those who study the Dao in this world,
three years, nine years—all in vain delay.
Still they wander as clouds and waters across the four seas,
cold-eyed, I see none worth transmitting to.
Incense burned, they inquire of the Dao—yet bow to inferiors,
distinguishing false from true, knowing fools from the wise.

Returning, I composed this *Song of Emerald Void*,
radiant as the sun shining in the blue sky.
Sweeping away the petty arts of lesser learning,
distinguishing the firing times and refining the medicines.
I take but one taste—the gold within water,
gathering it into the void, the cave of creation.
Urging the hundred pulses to return to their source,
pulses stilled, qi halted—the elixir begins to congeal.

At first, a withered tree clings to the cold cliff,
two beasts meet like lightning.
At the central, true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born,
waves calm, wind still, clouds and rain cease.
In a moment, the elixir’s head appears—
soft as a silk floss, hard as iron.
This is the blood of the Vermilion Phoenix of the South,
to be gathered, one must know the season.

Once this single attainment is complete,
life returns to the root, the true aperture.
Within, there is a true paradise,
its scenery luminous, the moon bright.
The dragon’s chant, the tiger’s roar—lead and mercury unite,
revealing the Yellow Sprout and White Snow.
Whenever heaven and earth conjoin,
seize the mechanism of yin and yang’s creation.

At the hours of *mao* and *you*, *jia* and *geng*, one must bathe;
At crescent, full, dark, and new moons, guard against peril.
Weigh each day and hour precisely,
Withdraw and replenish in tranquil harmony.

Within the twelve hours, only one moment suffices—
Nine returns, seven reversions, these small matters.
Nurture with care, ever sealing tightly;
The *xun*-wind must ceaselessly blow into *kan*.
Whether walking, sitting, sleeping, or eating, remain thus,
Ever fearful the fire may cool, the elixir’s power delayed.

A year’s celestial cycle excludes *mao* and *you*;
Nine revolutions’ work is daily ninefold.
When the tenth month arrives, jade frost descends,
The sacred embryo rounds, wind and thunder roar.

A year’s gestation births one child,
Who begets grandchildren, branching endlessly.
In its myriad transformations lies the subtlest art—
How could this be lightly taught to others?

Forget form, still the heart, sever self and other;
In life and death, motion and stillness, distinguish guest from host.
At dawn and dusk, medicines rise and sink;
Water and fire, hexagrams and talismans must be scrutinized.
True *qi* steams without cold or heat,
Pure yang overflows, beyond birth and death.

There is a path where mother and child part the embryo—
Its wonder lies in *wei*, *ji*, *dou*, *niu*, and *nü*.
Should you wish to prolong life and rescue the aged and infirm,
Sever lust and practice side doors no more.

If you would preserve form and dwell forever in the world,
None but stoking the fire to refine the divine elixir suffices.
The divine elixir’s work takes three hundred days—
Seven dissolutions, seven moltings, and the Great Return is complete.
Gathered, it forms shape; scattered, it becomes *qi*—
Heaven and earth, all are the same.

Better to seek a master’s peaceful method
Than to lewdly plunder essence and blood.
As the ancients said: “Heaven and earth all return”—
Learn the art of non-action and purity.
Bind the thousand-acre clouds of green mountains,
Scoop the single moon from the azure pool.

The Mysterious Pass’s aperture—none know it,
Yet this is the *daogui*, most wondrous and rare.
One night, I encountered Master Lü,
Who held an elixir formula still more marvelous!
Take the Great Void as crucible and furnace,
Seize the crow and hare as medicinal materials.
Let mountains, rivers, and the vast earth blaze with fierce fire—
Within, the ten thousand images birth wind and thunder.

Once chaos, now the myriad things,
All at once conjoin to form the sacred embryo.
No gold or wood to question or divide,
No dragon or tiger to separate north and south.
Neither mother nor child, nor female nor male,
Neither husband nor wife, nor black nor white—
Who names this the Great Return Elixir?
Even the Most High Lord Lao could not swallow it.

Lord Lao left it for the carefree wanderer,
Who, having ingested it, soars as spirit to the Great Ultimate.
Then take a cup of primordial wine,
And with this *daogui* fortify your countenance.
Though seas may turn to mulberry fields,
In my Dao, the pot’s year has not yet passed.

If only your heart were firm as iron,
I would secretly transmit it word by word.
The subtlety lies in but half a phrase—
The immortals’ dharma is truly natural.
Hasten to begin, knit the embryonic immortal,
And chanting brightly, return to Penglai’s heaven.

**Haiqiong Jun’s “All Methods Return to One” Song**

The great medicine of the golden elixir is wondrous beyond measure,
A single speck of elixir’s head glows red within and without.
True mercury, true lead—once grasped,
In an instant the tiger is subdued, the dragon captured alive.

The Yellow Matchmaker weds them in Ding Gong’s abode,
At *xun*’s position, the nine revolutions’ work is blown to completion.
After ten months, the embryo rounds beyond *li* and *kan*,
Purple clouds ascend from the empty jade crucible.

In short hemp robes and headscarves, they throng the bustling market,
Seeking herbs, burning thatch, tending the medicine chest.
Their own three yellows and four spirits—
Who knows the intent behind installing the furnace and refining the crucible?

Paper jackets and hempen garments hide in the mountains,
Eating pine, drinking water, enduring hunger and cold.
Sun’s essence, moon’s marrow—empty breaths,
Only in the end does one know the Way’s difficulty.

In the ghostly caverns beneath Black Mountain,
Backs bent, heads drooping, mouths drooling,
Dreaming of dreamers within dreams—
When will they await cinnabar’s death?

The foolish, ill-fated fail to sever lust,
Closing the tailbone to plunder another’s yin.
Original essence shakes without walls,
Mistaking yellow mud for gold.

Rong Cheng’s three peaks teach the art of riding women,
Plundering essence to feed the eyes and breasts.
The Great Dao’s true fire has no yin or yang—
Toil in form and attachment is but vain suffering.

Knocking teeth, swallowing saliva, gulping *qi* with sound,
The cart’s wheels turn in vain, the skull’s form moves.
Falsely taking mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female,
They boast of golden crystals filling the elbow’s hollow.

Holding breath at the nose’s tip, drawing empty cakes,
How many escape their shadows at noon?
Guest winds and perverse *qi* rumble in the belly—
How could divine cinnabar long abide in the crucible?

Studying Zen, perceiving nature, realizing suchness—
Do not claim emptiness suffices without the heart.
Awakened yet not practicing the wisdom of *qian*,
A thousand cliffs and ten thousand ravines must still be traversed.

How many aged Confucians study the *Zhouyi*,
Yet know not the Great Ultimate returns to the Non-Ultimate?
Forgetting form, they would follow natural truth,
But fear spring’s departure leaves the grass powerless.

The Ming Sect’s sole task is demon-quelling—
What of the seven-hour merits?
Unknowing the bright intent of purity today,
Their faces sallow, their toil in vain.

Hu’s Yangshan, a single patriarch,
His nine returns’ adornments all empty words.
Wielding golden rings, driving three chariots—
Who has ever flown to the Golden Heaven?

More are the four-fruit vegetarians,
At the Nine Bends’ riverbank casting iron talismans.
Though they burn all their frankincense,
How can they become buddhas when essence and blood, original yang, are parched?

Thirty-six hundred guardians of side doors,
Opening crowns, shrinking turtles, practicing breath-holding,
Visualizing the cinnabar field, refining the five sprouts,
Exhaling the old, inhaling the new—wasted effort.

Worshiping pagodas, burning incense, chanting sutras,
Even bowing to the Dipper and gazing at stars,
Swallowing talismans, drinking water, reciting spells—
How could laziness ever attain the Dao?

Visualizing, massaging, the Eight Brocades,
Laughing and exhaling the Six Words to constrain waking and sleeping,
If you wish to return essence to replenish the brain,
None but a cup of rich wine suffices.

Eyes straining to direct *qi* to the crown,
Playfully speaking of sun and moon illuminating Kunlun.
When they glimpse a halo’s appearance,
They point to Heavenly Worthies and World-Honored Ones.

Eyes have no light—human delusion;
Ears have no sound—how could they hear?
Above lies the Great Abyss, below the Misty Pool,
Falsely pointing to the Central Yellow, enduring hunger.

Vainly tracing celestial cycles, practicing hexagrams—
When have they ever known the true dragon and tiger?
Those who painfully know the true dragon and tiger
Have grasped the upward path.

Secretly clutching their bowls to drink urine,
Spitting and swallowing saliva to form pearls,
Nose dripping two streams of snot—
Dare they call themselves Jade Stem Immortals?

Those who exhaust themselves in "preserving the Three and guarding the One,"
Nine years refining elixirs in thought alone—
Forgetting their household treasure to seek without,
A hundred years but a wandering ghost of yin and spirit.

Heaven’s Gate wolfberries and yellow essence,
Beans, apricots, ginger, pepper, ginseng, and licorice—
Have they ever truly become earthbound immortals?
Skin scorched, flesh rotted—pitiful creatures.

Fasting rites, purifications, proclamations, and Sanskrit chants,
Dividing talismans, breaking contracts, transmitting scriptures—
Unknowing of the two true words of Heaven’s Heart,
They only master the Three Lights’ talisman-water,
Brandishing thunder seals in their sleeves to frighten mountain spirits,
Wielding willow branches to mimic invisibility.
This heart is originally the treasury of communion with spirits,
Yet one errant thought spawns ten thousand illusions.
This body and all beyond it are hidden things,
This heart and all beyond it are sorcery.

Within the body lies the true heart, within the heart lies the body,
Neither emerging from within nor without.
As for this Golden Liquor and Great Return Elixir,
From the Original Valley to the Muddy Pellet,
The sevenfold refinement and replenishment are no great matter—
Plants and trees, devoid of intent, mirror heaven and earth’s leisure.

True roots, true stems bear true nectar,
True crucibles, true altars, true alchemical furnaces.
From the yang day they begin, on the yin day they accumulate,
Clearly distinguishing yang fire and yin talismans.
Half an acre of cinnabar field sown with golden millet,
A single fragrant lingzhi blossom, rich and lush.

The iron ox roars into the cotton chamber,
The wooden horse gallops, leaping into the golden house.
Qian and Kun’s two eights congeal cinnabar,
The crucible brimming with melting white snowflakes.
Seizing the tortoise and serpent in both hands,
The jade hare on the mountain peak transforms into a golden crow.

The oral formula for the Returned Elixir is known to few,
Mercury dragon and lead tiger depend on the fire’s timing.
Within three thousand moments, the infant takes form,
Tempered and nurtured without flaw.
The body becomes pure as a single piece of jade,
The cold toad’s light illumines the jade flask’s ice.

At midnight, thunder roars at the fontanel,
A gust of pure wind in the marketplace startles gods and ghosts.
If celestial beings ask for the true esoteric formula,
Who would dare leak Heaven’s secrets?
Only a hero of great resolve,
With a heart utterly empty,
At the first stirring of yang, the Great Elixir is complete—
In an instant, the adept becomes one with the numinous workings of creation.
Yet I fear my name may be recorded in the Southern Palace’s register,
Drunk, riding a white crane to ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

**Admonition on the Dao (also called "Inscription for Broad Daylight")**

Alas!
The human body is like a rootless tree,
Relying solely on breath as its trunk and branches.
A hundred years of time
Are like a dream.
The outgoing breath does not guarantee the incoming,
This morning does not guarantee the next.
Wasting the years,
Suddenly old and dead,
The hundred bones dissolve,
The four elements disperse.
The spirit, confused and lost,
Scatters into the various destinies—
Who knows what form the next life will take?
The wheel of birth and death turns endlessly,
Deluded, failing to awaken,
Lazy, failing to strive.
Now that you have arrived at this treasure mountain,
Do not leave empty-handed.
To grow old and die as before,
Having come to the world in vain—
Each must exert utmost effort,
Devote yourself to the work as if your life depends on it.
As the ancients said:
"A year or two of toil,
A thousand or ten thousand kalpas of bliss."
From now on, gather your resolve,
Single-minded, without distraction.
Eyes, do not gaze outward;
Ears, do not listen outward.
Moderate your diet,
Reduce your sleep,
Cease idle chatter,
Still your thoughts.
Cover your head with straw,
Seek no comfort;
Cook rice to stave off hunger,
Disregard minor hardships.
Like the cicada drinking dew,
Your body will become light and pure;
Like the tortoise absorbing sunlight,
Your lifespan will extend.
If you can dine on pine and cypress,
Wear a bamboo hat and straw cloak,
Sleep beneath clouds in the cliffs,
Drink from streams before caves—
You are a true cultivator.
If you lack such strength,
At least gradually emulate the ancient worthies.
To practice otherwise
Is to lack this fortune.

Strive morning and night,
Refining and smelting hour by hour.
Like a dragon nurturing its pearl,
Like a hen brooding her eggs,
The fire’s continuity forges a single whole.
When mother and child meet at last,
Is it not joyous?

**Verses on Transmitting the Dharma and Illuminating the Mind by Peng Helin**

The myriad dharmas arise from the heart,
Each thought is itself dharma.
Speech and silence, movement and stillness—
All are governed by dharma.
Without doubt, this is the true heart;
Guarding the One is the true dharma.
Guard the One without doubt,
And every dharma becomes a dharma of the heart.

Dharma is the servant of the heart,
The heart is the master of dharma.
Without doubt, the heart is upright;
An upright heart makes dharma efficacious.
Guard the One, and the heart is focused;
A focused heart makes dharma manifest.
It is not that dharma is inherently efficacious—
It is your heart that makes it so.

**Memorial to the Yellow Register Office**

Your subordinate, the youthful servant Bai [Name], who attained the Dao underground and upholds the dharma, respectfully memorializes:

From my earliest existence, by the grace of the August Emperor and the King,
The sacred *qi* dwelled within me,
And my spiritual root remained unobscured.
Knowing of this matter in past lives,
I cultivated in this life and now encounter it again.
I have been entrusted with thunder talismans
And have roughly grasped the teachings.
Yet I, your subordinate, know this:
The Most High Dao, the Compassionate Father and Sacred Mother,
And the Lords of the Ten Directions,
Have always shown mercy and forgiveness.
Thus, I have grown lazy and negligent,
Failing to maintain incense and offerings all year.
In the immortal registers,
It is as if I did not exist.
Yet I dare to presumptuously submit this memorial,
For I have my reasons.

This body of mine—
Skin, hair, bones, blood,
Tears, saliva, phlegm—
Cannot become true.
But I possess a single numinous heaven,
The original nature,
The spirit of the primordial mandate.
Boundless and immeasurable,
It can ascend to the imperial and brahmic realms,
Standing in attendance before the Jade Dawn.
Though I am lazy and negligent,
The Imperial True One knows me.
Even ghosts and spirits can do nothing about it!

In years past, I was awakened to this:
All those who have attained the Dao and uphold the dharma in the mortal world,
With their ranks and titles,
Are merely false claims.
If they serve in the celestial bureaus,
Their positions are assigned differently.

Now with this humble clod of earth and dust, Peng Xiang, I have expounded and established the Yellow Register for my father, and thus am commanded to submit this memorial. Since I cannot refuse, I humbly request that for a time, I be granted the title of *Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Palace Thunder Command*, to command the Five Thunder Generals and lead the affairs of the Thunder Bureau’s spirits and deities. Acting as the *Attendant Envoy of Supreme Clarity and the Yellow Register*, I shall resign this post once the ritual feast concludes. Should I be called to dispatch wind and thunder or distinguish between humans and ghosts, I ask only to borrow the thunderous title from above to address myself. When the day comes for my worldly obligations to be fulfilled and I present myself at court, I shall await further decree from the celestial offices. A myriad deaths would not suffice to atone for my presumption in daring to offend Your Celestial Majesty.

**Memorial of Gratitude and Petition**
*Submitted by the unworthy official [Name]*

I respectfully submit this memorial on the twenty-third day of this month, presenting myself at the celestial gate to express gratitude and lay bare my heart.

I reflect that nature is bestowed by Heaven, and whether one is wise or foolish, good or evil, is likewise ordained by Heaven. When humans and the Dao move in harmony, every action and stillness aligns with the Dao. Why then do dark realms establish courts of the netherworld, while the celestial powers institute bureaus of reward and punishment? The body and form arise from the cycles of qi, and fate is bound to the stars. Truly, life and death do not arise of themselves but seem to emerge from the interplay of yin and yang. The celestial mechanism never ceases, and the sentiments of beings readily shift—winter arrives, and ice naturally forms; spring comes, and grass turns green. All is shaped by qi, and thus the nature is established as its master. A thousand lamps illuminate a room with a single light, just as the vast sea contains countless waves. The distinction between the sentient and the insentient, and the difference between life’s allotment and its fulfillment, lie herein. Yet movement and stillness are not their original state; thoughts and desires manifest only after form takes shape. Once form is complete, the Dao resides within it. Those who attain it merge with the true, while those who lose it sink into confusion. Thus, the path of cultivating immortality and studying the Dao begins with establishing the gate of rectifying the mind and sincerity of intent. The Great Dao alone transcends life and death, and utmost sincerity can reverse the workings of creation. To preserve sincerity is to unite with the Dao, and all who attain the Dao possess sincerity. This is the path by which all beings enter, the realm where all sages have ascended.

I, a being of impure flesh and defiled bones, a walking corpse of mere form, am endowed with vital qi and a nature that remains undimmed. My six senses are complete, and the three times are perfectly rounded. I can distinguish between beans and wheat, yet I dissolve distinctions of right and wrong, rising above the taint of honor and disgrace. In activity and stillness, stillness pervades all; in perceiving form and emptiness, emptiness encompasses all. I recognize that the six consciousnesses have no root, and the seven emotions are like dreams. I see how flesh and blood intoxicate the nature, and how form and substance stifle the spirit. Long have I hastened toward the mysterious pass, yet still I linger at the threshold of the Dao’s gate. Nature is trustworthiness, and the spirit communicates through it.

I reverently consider the *Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity True King*, the *Great Emperor of Longevity*, the *Jade Sovereign*, the *Golden Portal True August One*, the *Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor*—whose heart contains the Great Brahma, whose hands grasp the Primordial Chaos, whose vastness defies naming, whose majesty is beyond reach. In compassion for all beings, You govern the multitude of perfected ones, bestowing grace upon the ten directions and surveying the myriad realms. I, a mere ant in form, dare to raise the voice of an earthworm, long bearing the weight of Your boundless favor, drenched in the nourishing rain of Your grace. Every prayer I have offered has been met with response. Fortunate to have heard the Dao a day sooner, I have cultivated the true amidst ten thousand kalpas. I now humbly recount the gradual progress of my practice and the beginnings of my realization.

Though dull-witted, I secretly aspire to receive Your instruction, hoping that my lowly name might one day join the ranks of the ministers of the Empyrean. Presumptuously submitting this memorial, I dare to seek Your sagely attention. I confess my errors and beg for Your boundless mercy, that I may temporarily rouse the mind of revival and extinction to harmonize with the wondrous subtlety of emptiness. The methods of the Thunder Department I practice, the statutes of the Thunder Bureau I uphold—all serve to assist the upright, expel evil, aid the living, and deliver the dead. The officers and generals of the Three Bureaus are subject to my command, and the five divisions of wind and thunder answer to my summons. Should even the smallest merit or slightest good be recorded on the golden tablets, then this humble servant may one day reach the Jade Capital. Though the hemp grows straight when planted among reeds, and the fish thrives in water, without nurture it withers. Some say the crane is long and the heron short, yet there are snakes that shed their skins to become cicadas.

I, in my foolishness, have dared to offend Your Celestial Majesty. With trepidation, I submit this memorial for Your consideration. I am filled with awe and reverence.

Letter to Peng Helin

On the fourteenth day of the ninth month in the dingchou year, Yu Chan, about to journey to Quanshan, addressed his friend, the Perfected Officer Helin:

Though we parted but recently, my heart is already heavy with longing. My sworn brother, you aspire to immortality—not as one of the common crowd. Of late, you have come to understand the principle that the myriad methods return to the One, and you are no longer deceived by the various schools. This is the very focus of the sages and worthies of ancient times, rarely seen in recent ages. The Dao is not far—how could you fail to attain immortality?

Zhang Xiyu once said that there is a proper method for each stage, a secret method for each stage, a wondrous method for each stage, yet all methods ever reside in the heart—there is no other method. Though his words may seem careless, they are indeed well-founded.

When first we met, we already spoke of the great elixir of golden cinnabar as our shared aspiration; only the timely conditions had not yet aligned. Now the moment has come, and our great trust requires no prior agreement. Recall our earlier verses in exchange, with lines such as “tiger-skin bamboo hat, Mount Taihua crown”—today, as a Dao official of Mount Taihua and the Cinnabar Scenery Bureau, I realize that those poems of old were already foreshadowing our present rendezvous.

In all matters, take care; in sacred matters, take care; in every matter, take care. I have already spoken too much.

Ah! Ah!

To the Secretariat Clerk of the Ministry, I extend my regards with good fortune. Respected Alchemist of the Elixir Pearl, can you truly trust and undertake this matter? Regarding the lodging I previously advised for this winter through next spring, the Celestial Gallery of Painted Scenery would suffice. Or if you prefer to wait until spring’s gentle warmth for our pact, it will not be long before we meet again.

There is no need to laboriously consult charts and diagrams—simply attend to nurturing the heart! Otherwise, gather the methods you have acquired before and after, compile them into a volume, and store it high upon the shelf. Engage only with Ju and Hao as your companions, and all affairs will become effortless yet wondrously efficacious.

Now, before the incense burner of the two messengers, employ this single talisman as you see fit—whether to consecrate, affix, ingest, or carry—using it according to your prayers, and nothing will fail to prosper. There is no need for excessive recitation.

This is nothing extraordinary—merely that the heart and spirit unite, and its use becomes potent! For consecrated water, a simple incantation suffices, as though a true dragon: a single drop becomes a torrential downpour. Why employ such complexity? The paper offerings unravel thread by thread—ponder this! Ponder this!

At the time, residing in the Purple Pivot Tower for writing.

On the fourteenth day of the ninth month, Yu Chan set out from Luojiang, following the tide southward, and by the eighteenth day arrived at Quanshan. Though weary from travel, fortune favored a slight ease of body and spirit, and thoughts of old friends from the Three Mountains arose—lingering a while longer, I shall yet become a guest by the Zhang shores.

The vow made last spring shall not falter!

For now, I savor the Dao in solitude, content with incense, candles, and the attendants of the officials—nothing more than a single talisman and a draught of water, sufficient to dispel illness and repel malevolent influences. This is the true purpose of acting on Heaven’s behalf to transform the world. I have entrusted the preparation of medicinal pearls and ritual implements to Attendant Longevity of the Ministry, along with Immortal Longevity. Daily, I envision your refined and carefree bearing, regretting only that I could not visit the new hermitage east of the city for a cup of tea. This wish must be fulfilled.

Those who study the Dao, beyond examining their faults and reflecting on their errors, should accept even minor setbacks with equanimity. Where the Dao resides, can worldly matters truly bring us joy or sorrow?

The waters of Penglai have grown shallow once more!
The mulberry fields lie level—turning back to gaze upon the old path.

Written in autumn at the Immortal Shedding Hut, the ding-chou year.

On the fifteenth day of the third month in the wu-yin year, residing at the Temple of Supreme Peace and Prosperity in Jiangzhou, I write to send word to my worthy brother, the True Man of Crane Grove. Recently, I sent three letters—have they reached you? Of late, I trust your mastery of the Dao and its methods has advanced, your spiritual power surpassing what came before.

Have the two talisman officials, Ju and Hao, been diligent in their duties? I wonder if the health of your household’s Attendant Longevity of the Ministry remains robust, and whether the Recluse of Medicinal Pearls and your heir, Chengfeng, are both well and at peace?

This spring, I traveled over two thousand li by water and land in search of a secluded retreat on Mount Lu. Fortunately, my four limbs feel light and unburdened, and all matters proceed smoothly. Yet on flower-bright mornings and moonlit evenings, with wine in hand and incense curling from the brazier, I often think of my southern friends with longing. And for old companions, my heart aches even more!

Those who dwell beyond the world—whether mortal or sage—do not let honor or disgrace weigh on their minds, nor praise or blame occupy their thoughts. Only the spirits of trees and the demons of stones might discern what manner of person one truly is.

*The Song of the Great Dao* and *The Chart of the Immortal Lineage* must surely be in wide circulation by now—how delightful! How delightful!

My old friend, I pray you whip your steed onward—this letter shall not detain you further. Take care! Take care!

Respectfully inscribed by this old man of Qiongshan, Bai, on the twentieth day of the tenth month.

This old man of Qiongshan, Bai, writes to Master Peng of the Crane Forest in Fuzhou. This spring, I arrived in Jiangzhou and proceeded to Xingguo Commandery, then passed through Yueyang, returned to Yuzhang, and stopped at Fuzhou before paying homage at Huagai Mountain. Descending to Linjiang Commandery, I took the route through Rao and Xin to prepare for my journey. On the first day of the eighth month, I presented myself at the imperial court, then traveled to Shaoxing, passed through Qingyuan Prefecture, and returned once more to Lin’an.

On the twentieth day of the tenth month, while wandering idly, I suddenly encountered Xiao Qian’an. From him, I learned that Liaoran has already passed away, Ruan has returned to Xiangshan, Zihu remains, and Dianxian is well. I have repeatedly received summons from Ningguo, but I no longer go to see them. Shi Kui now holds a key position in the Bureau of Military Affairs, and each has his own connections—one may call upon him if inclined. Yet my enthusiasm has waned, and all things now rest in tranquility. Each day, I do nothing but drink deeply, sing heartily, and bid farewell to the passing hours. I seek nothing more, nor do I ponder further.

Only for you, my Crane Forest—my beloved disciple, far away beyond two thousand *li*—I humbly pray that, even now, you attend upon the venerable Elder of the Ministry of Personnel, the immortal old master, and the young Daoist of the Pearl of Medicine, all of whom I trust are well. Qian’an could speak of one or two matters, which would bring me great comfort.

Here, my wild and eccentric ways bring me joy, and others have grown accustomed to them. Only my uncle, the Recorder of the Realm, is greatly astonished by my unconventionality. The methods I now practice remain potent. Once, in a drunken stupor, I lost my footing and plunged into the waters of West Lake—my dharma-seal vanished entirely! Yet this too may provoke a hearty laugh.

I had intended to journey to Tiantai, but before departing, I summoned Qian’an to instruct him. Gazing southward, my thoughts grow heavy with longing, and though I would write more, my brush falls silent.

Respectfully bowing twice, I address this to my esteemed friend, the True Man of the Crane Forest. Since parting by the lakes and mountains of Yuan and Kai, time has slipped away. Suddenly, your letter arrived, bringing great comfort after our three autumns apart. I rejoice to learn that your campaigns have triumphed, and in your leisure, you cultivate and refine yourself. May the winds and thunder attend your command, and may your well-being flourish in every way. The Pearl of Medicine, attending to the scriptures, shares in this felicity.

You graciously sent me the *Classic of Purity* with your interlinear verses—each word aligns with the Dao, each phrase resonates with truth. Though you modestly asked for corrections, I find it already precise and flawless, with nothing to critique. Like a ceaseless spring, it flows day and night, reaching its perfect end!

May it spread to the four seas—shall we yet meet again? You are a master of the great Dao. I cherish and safeguard this gift; should further revelations come, pray share them without reserve! I implore you!

I, a mere flickering shadow, parted with you at Yellow Pond as you journeyed south. Like wild geese, we soar side by side—you toward Cassia Mountain, I toward Lotus Marsh, where the wind stirs the pools and the moon graces the pavilion. Last night and this evening blur as if a dream. Yet who am I, that you have long honored me with the intimacy of a disciple, treating me with the reverence due a teacher? Far beyond my worth, I can never repay such boundless generosity. Each time I reflect, my ears burn with shame.

It has been ten years since the road to Divine Empyrean faded from view—cranes vanished, phoenixes dissolved into darkness, and autumn’s sorrow lingers. I long to summon the yellow swan, ride the purple mist, lead the vanguard of wind and thunder, and follow with the Azure Dragon’s millstone. Yet how can I? The dust-debts clinging to my flesh remain unpaid, the karmic vines rooted in my bones unsevered. For now, I can only grip the tiller against the wind, wading through the abyss in pursuit—different paths, yet converging in the same Dao.

Dregs and swill, ferment and sip—I only deepen my own filth. Yet casting nets into the rushing torrent, one may still catch fish. In this life, none have encountered fortune like yours. Now you dwell in the profound, ever more resembling the Dao!

Only through unwavering certainty is qi made complete; only through fearlessness is spirit preserved whole. Thus, with certainty, the true harbors spirit within; with fearlessness, sincerity knows no law beyond. From dawn’s darkness to dusk’s practice, you accumulate immortal merit, accepting worldly karma only to return it to the Jade Treasury. Ever advancing, ever ascending—dare I urge you onward.

Do not say, *"Today is today, and tomorrow remains"*—or *"This year is this year, and next year will come"*—or *"This life is this life, and future lives await"*—or *"This body is this body, and later bodies follow."* Little do you know: the lamp snuffs out upon the bed, shoes and slippers part ways—where then is next year? Where the morrow?

A father does not trust his son; a hand does not trust its own embrace. Where then is the later body? Where the future life? You must strive with all your might. Do not see me as I am—should I drift and sink, whom could you rely upon?

My throat tightens as I write; this parting must be long, waters vast and clouds distant. The heavens darken in sorrow—take care, each of you.

Respectfully entrusted to Peng Helin,
So-and-so bows in reply.

To the worthy disciple of Helin the Perfected,
Your spring affairs flourish with grace, water warms and flowers bloom. Though your journey has been rough, you are broadly at ease—no need for concern.

Last year, pressed by the eve of the New Year, I passed through Penholder Mountain; this New Year’s Day, I herewith submitted memorials to the various heavens, offering sacrifices to the gods. On that very day, I was humbly enrolled among the registrars under the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder-Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy, signing and sealing documents for the Thunder Bureau’s affairs concerning ghosts and spirits. I further received the Supreme Clarity Talisman for Dispatching Ghosts and Spirits, the seal script of which has been submitted above—truly a means to govern and pacify the numinous.

The elder has since passed through Kanglu. If nothing has been seen or heard, do not send word, lest it drift or sink. By late autumn or early winter, we shall surely meet again. *The Jade Scripture of Thunder* should be printed by now; distribute ten copies to transmit among the scholars of Jiangxi. My heart brims with reverence. In the meantime, conduct yourself with the Dao and devote yourself to the Dharma, as befits the former veneration of the Celestial Officials.

On the fifth day of the first month, Yang Bozi sent a messenger bearing a carved box and two old-style quatrains, their sentiment and phrasing most respectful. I have transcribed them here; the rest need not be mentioned.

So-and-so bows in reply.

To Helin, Thunder Bureau Magistrate: Your medicinal pearls attend the scriptures, your solitary jade gleams between the hours. The Dipper’s handle points thrice—you have long since settled deep in your native land. How long it has been since we parted!

I still recall when an old acquaintance took up his post in Leizhou. At the initial handover, there appeared an enormous egg, most strange, larger than a peck measure. It remains there to this day, and thus the place is named Leizhou. Some say it was the afterbirth of Chen Luanfeng—how extraordinary! Yet what manner of being was Chen that he did not become the Five Directions’ Barbarian Thunder General-in-Chief?

Now we two are indeed no common men. My name is recorded in the register of Pengxi Terrace, my person ranks among the attendants of the Jade Palace. My destiny was long inscribed in the mysterious chart, my bones and features marked for this office. Though I may lack virtue, in death I shall return to my original cohort. Reflecting on past lives, I find no great transgressions. From now on, I shall live out this world’s allotted span, repaying karmic debts in due course. When the years and months are fulfilled, I shall hasten back to my former post—this is certain! It is also my private assurance.

Your faith in me grows ever firmer, your affection ever deeper. Humbly sharing this office, we follow no different path. I only hope you will amass merit and conduct, ascending thereby to the ranks of the immortals. Do not regard me as diligent or indolent. From beginning to end, trust in me—may these words serve you well!

The hour of *mao* belongs to *Zhen*, and *Zhen* governs thunder; yet the Western Terrace pertains to Metal, and Metal resides in the West, where it restrains the eastern *Zhen*—such is the overcoming of Wood by Metal. Thus, whenever thunder arises, the Western Terrace must command its destiny. The authority behind its issuance lies with the officials of the Thunder Department, yet they know not of the Jade Pivot, nor of the Immortal Capital, nor even of the Western Terrace. Most are but functionaries of the Bureau of Envoys or lesser offices. When their time in this world ends, if they have no merit or conduct to their name, so be it; but if they possess merit, they may enter the ranks of the Thunder Officials—yet their baseness and defilement are too grave to recount, much like those of Fengdu who, upon death, become mere ghostly functionaries.

Your appointment and investiture, however, have already placed you within the Immortal Capital and the Western Terrace! I know you possess the capacity for transcendence—why? Because those who may attain immortality share seven traits: first, their karmic debts to wives and children are light, and their worldly ties are sparse; second, their nature is serene and numinous, discerning matters before they arise; third, their eyes, hair, and bones resemble those of the forest immortals at dawn; fourth, their minds are fixed upon a single office, like an archer loosing an arrow; fifth, they cultivate and refine themselves day and night without fail; sixth, their every action aligns with the Dao, never straying far from truth; and seventh, their attainment is already complete, yet their years are not yet spent. Ascending from these, what heights could they not reach?

Since my youth, I have been but a speck in the vast spring of humanity, yet I have acted accordingly. Perhaps we may meet again at the confluence of rivers to bid farewell on an appointed day—let this be our settled resolve. Yet your time in this world will not be long! In fond remembrance of the two immortals, I have spoken my heart and recounted these matters, unaware of how lengthy my words have grown. I trust your esteemed gathering is well and that your health remains robust.

On the fifth day of the eighth month, I respectfully reply.

As for Master *Haiqiong’s* collected works, I have long since received them in multiple transmissions. I recall that in the late spring of *dingshou* during my younger years, when my teacher journeyed south in his chariot, I was fortunate to pay my respects. Thereafter, like clouds and cranes, we came and went, and with each audience, I was granted a brief respite. Day after day, I attended his seat and heard what I had never heard before—nothing but the discernment of right and wrong, the elucidation of profound mysteries. Returning, I committed these teachings to writing, and they filled the pages abundantly. Though I am but a withered old man, unworthy of my teacher’s instruction, I dared not keep them hidden. Thus, I have compiled them into four volumes, including his *Shengtang Xiaocan* and hymns of praise, to be engraved for posterity. May they serve as a guide for the sea of learning, and perhaps open the eyes and ears of gods and men—this is my humble wish.

Written with reverence on the *jiazi* day of the late winter of *Xinhai* in the *Chunyou* era by Peng Xiang of Helin, foremost disciple of the White Patriarch.

The above words were composed by the Perfected Peng Helin, a disciple of the White Patriarch. The Perfected One hails from a great clan of the Three Mountains, akin to the lineage of Yang and Xu, the chroniclers of Mount Mao. This compilation was entrusted for transmission and reception. I once obtained a copy of the Perfected One’s words—a volume from the Tianqing edition of Fuzhou—appended with his postscript. Here, I have transcribed it anew to complete this work, which is preserved in the collection of the Great Constant Fast, the Dharma Master Jiang.

Having received the Great Rites of the *Jingxiao* from the Patriarch, I often employ the Generals Ju and Hao. This text fully records their names, and the work is wondrously esoteric—just as Master Peng said, it opens the eyes of gods and men. Scholars should ponder it deeply, for therein lies true attainment.

Respectfully inscribed on the eighteenth day of the seventh month in the *renyin* year by Fang Congyi, Student of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures and Registers of the Supreme Clarity, Immortal Minister Assisting the Transformation of the Great Luo, and Libationer of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Gate. Thus concludes the fourth volume of *The Recorded Sayings of the White Perfected of Haiqiong*.
