**Initiation Master**
The Most High Lord Lao bestows upon Xu Jia the *Register for Extending Life and Preserving Destiny*. This is the sacred writ of the Supreme Primordial Qi of the Jade Sovereign, the August Highest Lord, the True Lord who determines lifespan, extends years, and grants enduring vision, safeguarding the body and protecting life. It is a numinous text of profound mystery, not to be handled by the common. Formerly, Master Yin Xi, Magistrate of the Hangu Pass, personally received its transmission and bequeathed it to later worthies. Only the true disciples of immortals—those whose bones and destiny align with the Dao—may reverently bear this writ.

In the first year of the Yuanshou era, Dongfang Shuo, the transcendent son of the Eastern August Void Sovereign, journeyed to the Queen Mother of the West with a thousand days’ pure offering to beseech this method. Upon wearing it, he attained the true Dao, as Xu Jia had before him, gaining a thousand additional years. Zhang Daoling wore it and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Zhao Sheng, through cultivation, swiftly realized perfection. Should the disciple of the Correct and True be able to follow its statutes and receive it with devotion, they too shall extend their years, prolong their vision, lengthen their lifespan, and augment their allotted time. The body shall be safeguarded, life preserved, a thousand calamities averted, and ten thousand harms dissolved. The jade lads and jade maidens of the Dharma, the celestial officials, generals, and clerks, the Heavenly Ding warriors, the lifespan-determining forces, the talisman-empowered Generals of Extended Lifespan, and their myriad hosts—each in their millions—shall ever attend the bearer, never parting from their person.

Should one uphold and cultivate this method, they shall attain long life, enduring vision, transcendence of life and death, and realization of the Dao. This method is secret and wondrous; it must not be transmitted to the unworthy. Should transmission violate its statutes, misfortune shall extend to the seven ancestors and afflict the recipient’s own body. Let none blame the master or fault the Dao.

**By the Statutes and Ordinances of the Most High Lord Lao:**
The Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin determines lifespan, extends years, grants enduring vision, safeguards the body, and protects life. Through transformation, one ascends as an immortal. The precious talisman and register summon the Generals of Allotted Lifespan, the clerks and warriors of fixed destiny, the transcendent lads of extended years, and the jade maidens of preserved lifespan—each in their millions—to encircle the bearer’s bones, shield their person, and guard their movements, whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, near or far, never parting. Should one receive, wear, and cultivate it, they may ascend as an immortal.

**On the Zi day at the Zi hour (11 PM–1 AM),** the *Register for Extending Life and Preserving Destiny* summons the Determining Lads and Jade Maidens, each ninety million strong.
**On the Chou day at the Chou hour (1–3 AM),** it summons the Lifespan-Fixing Transcendent Officials, each ninety million strong.
**On the Yin day at the Yin hour (3–5 AM),** it summons the Earth Officials of Fixed Form, each ninety million strong.
**On the Mao day at the Mao hour (5–7 AM),** it summons the Water Officials of Death’s Dissolution, each ninety million strong.

**On the Xu day at the Xu hour (7–9 PM),** it summons the Twenty-Eight Constellations Lords of Disaster’s Dissolution, each ninety million strong.
**On the Hai day at the Hai hour (9–11 PM),** it summons the Thirty-Five Stars Lords of Sin’s Eradication, each ninety million strong.

**By the Supreme Primordial, the Most High, the Three Heavens, the Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao:**
Your servant, though born of mortal flesh with dull senses and clouded perception, now presents offerings of sincerity to the Three Caverns Master, your servant [name], to receive the *Register of Lord Lao for Determining Lifespan, Extending Years, and Preserving Destiny*, to be cherished as a lifelong treasure. May the immortals and sages respond in kind. After receiving and wearing it, one must not treat the scriptures with disdain, mock Daoist priests, envy the worthy, resent the capable, bully the weak, or seize what is not rightfully theirs. Should one uphold it without transgression, it may be transmitted after ten years.

**Initiation Master: The Supreme Wondrous Register for Summoning Wealth and Securing Treasure**

Lord Lao declares: The *Register of the Purple Tenuity Jade Emperor Dao Lord for Summoning Wealth and Securing Treasure* is the esoteric script of the Azure Youth Lord of the Eastern Sea. Its numinous writ was once hidden, unseen by mortals, until the Yellow Emperor, on Mount Tai Bai, personally received it from the Queen Mother of the West and the Mysterious Woman. Thereby he attained wealth and nobility and ascended as an immortal. The Jade Cauldron Immortal transmitted it to the world, yet those without predestined fortune may neither hear nor behold this text. This precious register summons gold and calls forth silver, multiplying coin and silk daily. The five grains overflow, servants and maidservants thrive, fields and silkworms yield double harvests, merchants profit, and trade returns manifold. Wealth departs but returns again, safeguarding the household. Bandits and raiders inflict no harm; wicked villains and evil schemers turn toward compassion. Those who receive and cultivate it shall see their household prosper, their sons loyal and daughters chaste, their years prolonged and lives extended, their blessings shading descendants. Official emoluments increase daily, service to the sovereign brings fulfillment, and all hold them in love and reverence. Journeys near and far meet no obstruction; public and private affairs command respect. Ten thousand evils do not approach. Dragons, snakes, tigers, and beasts retreat and hide. The five pestilences and plague demons flee a thousand *li* away. This register is a treasure of secrecy—do not transmit it to the unworthy. If you can uphold it, guard it well.

Lord Lao declares: The *Purple Tenuity Central Harmony Wealth-Summoning Spirit Talisman*—regularly inscribed in cinnabar on the days of *bingzi*, *dingsi*, *renyin*, *guimao*, *wushen*, and *wuwu* (when the moon is full, waning, or waxing)—when worn, summons wealth from the five directions, bestowing riches and nobility. Trade flourishes a myriadfold, and commerce yields manifold returns. The talisman’s spirit hosts—nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine in number—attend and guard the bearer.

Lord Lao declares: The *Purple Tenuity Central Harmony Treasure-Securing Spirit Talisman*, inscribed in cinnabar on the aforementioned six prosperous days and worn—men on the left, women on the right—grants all desires as the heart wishes. Wealth and coin abound, livestock multiply, fields and silkworms thrive, and both public and private affairs command respect. Ten thousand calamities do not befall. The talisman’s spirit officers and soldiers—nine thousand nine hundred in number—attend and guard the disciple’s body.

Lord Lao declares: The *Purple Tenuity Central Harmony Prosperity-Bestowing Spirit Talisman*, inscribed on the six prosperous days and worn, brings prosperity and seeks profit, fulfilling all desires as the heart wishes.
