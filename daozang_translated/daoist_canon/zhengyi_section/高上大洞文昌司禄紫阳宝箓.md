**Volume One of the Highest Daoist Scripture of Wenchang, Lord of Fortune, Purple Yang Treasure Scrolls**

A certain devout Daoist practitioner residing in [location], humbly states:
*"By fate, I was born on the [year], [month], [day], and [hour] of the [stellar time], under the governance of the [specific star] of the Northern Dipper. On that very day, with utmost reverence, I knelt before the Master of the Dao, the Celestial True Person of the Heavenly Teacher, and received the *Highest Daoist Scripture of Wenchang, Lord of Fortune, Purple Yang Treasure Scrolls*. I now wear it with devotion, swearing to uphold the orthodox teachings, discipline myself, enhance my talents, sharpen my wisdom, sever demonic obstacles, banish malevolent spirits, achieve scholarly distinction, and ascend to positions of fortune.*

*After receiving this sacred text, I dare not reveal its mysteries lightly, lest I incur the wrath of the Daoist Master and betray my solemn vow. I shall strictly adhere to the laws and decrees of the Wenchang Upper Palace."*

**The Nine-Heavens Enlightenment Chapter of Wenchang**

At that time, the Sovereign of Nine-Heavens Enlightenment, the Radiant True Observer, the Precious Light Celestial Venerable (*Chéngzhēn Zhèngguān Bǎoguāng Tiānzūn*), in the year of *Chóngguāng Chìfèn Ruò* (a cyclical year name), when the sun was in the *Chuntuǐ* (a lunar mansion), and the moon was at the *Dōngbì* (East Wall) hour, descended into the *Bǎopíng Shān* (Treasure Screen Mountain) in the Shu capital, at the *Héshèng Yīngzhī Lóu* (Harmonious Sincerity Responding Hall) and the *Xuànhuì Yùxū Tán* (Mysterious Gathering Jade Emptiness Altar). He announced to the *Luánfǔ Shìxiān Zhēnrén* (Luanfu Attendant Immortal Sī Liú Ānshèng*), saying:

*"In past ages, I received the jade edict of the Most High Emperor, entrusted with overseeing the *Guìjí* (the celestial register of worthy scholars), promoting literary scholars to noble ranks, and advancing virtuous officials to aid the enlightened age. Thus, I was appointed to govern the Celestial Chancellery, specializing in bestowing fortune, recording the Underworld, determining noble ranks, measuring the Watery Realm, and selecting the worthy. I oversee the tripartite examinations of the Three Offices (Heaven, Earth, and Water).*

*In the years of selection, I, together with the Three Elements and Three Officials, the Five Directions and Five Emperors, the Three Celestial Stems and Five Stars of the Dipper, and the myriad luminaries, coordinate with the Three Mysteries, examine the *qi* and fate, and decree the Celestial Chancellery’s Bureau of Fixed Destiny and Noble Rank, the Earthly Bureau of Tai Mountain, the Watery Bureau of the Northern Netherworld, and the Imperial Lord of Fúsāng. We convene the Nine-Heavens Enlightenment Wenchang Grand Marshal’s Office to assess the nine regions and their constellations, determining the ranks of the three fortunes, three noble ranks, and three virtues—high or low—and further investigate the ancestral, parental, and familial lineages across lifetimes, whether they possess hidden virtues and filial piety or accumulated grudges, debts, lawsuits, curses, karmic roots, and demonic foundations, as well as their Five Phases and fateful allotments, calculating their directional numbers and recording them all.*

*If a lineage possesses hidden virtues and profound filial piety, with a sturdy foundation of virtue, even if their fate is declining, their merits will overcome it, and they shall be granted added fortune and longevity, ascending to noble selection and entering the register of fortune.*

*If their virtues are great and their foundation strong, yet their grudges, debts, and calamities persist, they shall first be enrolled in the register of the worthy, their names recorded in the noble ranks, awaiting the exhaustion of their misfortune and the extinction of their guilt before receiving their fortune.*

*If their fate aligns with noble rank and fortune, yet they lack hidden virtues, great deeds, or a hundred acts of loyalty and filial piety, their fortune shall be withdrawn, their noble rank stripped, their name erased from the register, and they shall await the establishment of virtue, the accumulation of goodness, and the gathering of blessings before being re-entered into the noble ranks and granted fortune and renown.*

*Should literary scholars and worthy men, knowing their fate, repent their errors, cultivate virtue, and refine their studies—though their fate is noble and their hidden merits slight, their karmic bonds heavy with grudges and debts, and demonic spirits obstructing their advancement and clouding their divine insight—I shall bestow upon them the *Great Daoist Treasure Scrolls of Wenchang’s Upper Palace*, dispelling all demonic obstacles and awakening their innate wisdom.*

*This text was formerly concealed within the jade palace of the Supreme Origin, the Holy Pure Realm, the Vast Effulgence Heavenly Palace, the Golden Gate Jade Chamber, and the cloud-silk pouch. It was transmitted to the Jade Sovereign Great Daoist Lord (*Yùchén Dà Dàojūn*), then passed from the Most High Laozi to the Purple Micro Emperor and the Supreme One Lord. It was further transmitted to the Holy Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, then to Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, and the Divine Yu.*

*Yu transmitted it to Liu Yue, Yue to Wang Jing, Jing to Peng Taiji, Taiji to Deng Yuan, Yuan to Liu Yi, Yi to Liu Dongzhen, Dongzhen to Wang Yuan, Yuan to Peng Xiao, Xiao to Liu Xiyue, Xiyue to Lan Gongqiào, and Gongqiào to Peng Dezhi.*

*Thus, ten thousand saints and true ones all received the transmission.*

*Those with accumulated blessings and predestined fortune who seek a master to receive this transmission must sincerely present offerings, follow the ritual protocols, and pledge with gold and silk to uphold the covenant. The transmitting master must be one who has received the Three Daoist Canons, the Four Auxiliaries, and the Nine-Heavens Golden Scrolls, only then may they follow the protocols to initiate the transmission. If their virtue and rank are still modest and their merits unproven, they must not presumptuously claim the title of master or recklessly divulge the sacred texts.*

*To hold and practice this scroll in accordance with its teachings can dissolve ancestral grudges, cease lawsuits and calamities, sever evil karmic roots, subdue demonic foundations, and dispel suffering. It can rob spirits of their divine insight, cause malevolent ghosts to flee, annihilate demons that disrupt nature, and crush evil that obstructs nobility. If one’s fate is grim and their destiny low, yet they revere this secret text without negligence, diligently tend to incense and offerings, and meditate upon the scriptures and incantations, they shall avert celestial calamities, repel earthly disasters, extend their fortune, sever demonic influences, clarify their divine nature, and flourish in literary brilliance.*

*If one’s fate is not yet noble and their literary endeavors stifled, yet they faithfully adhere to this treasure scroll and practice accordingly, they must solely dedicate themselves to benefiting others—severing poison, healing the sick, and saving at least three hundred and sixty people. Accumulating such great merit, they shall ascend to high fortune and noble rank, be recorded in the worthy registers, and aid the enlightened age as the most noble of officials. Their fortune shall extend to their descendants, bringing glory to their lineage."*

「If one can practice the wondrous *miao* methods (*妙行*) of the scriptures and treasure scrolls (*经箓*), maintaining purity of body and mind, clarity of *shen* and *qi*, and even in advanced years (*年齿既高*), they shall attain the *Taiyin* Refinement of Form (*太阴炼形*), achieving the *Shixie* Dao (*尸解之道*)—transcending the cycle of rebirth (*轮转*), ascending to the Daoist Celestial Capital (*仙都*), and becoming a True Person (*真人*).

All faithful and sincere practitioners (*清信之士*) who receive my treasure scrolls (*吾箓*) shall be petitioned by me before the Jade Emperor (*玉帝*) at the Golden Gate (*金阙*), recorded in the registers of the Three Elements (*三元*)—the Celestial Bureau of Fate (*天曹*), Earthly Bureau of Fate (*地府*), and Watery Bureau of Fate (*水府*)—for noble rank (*禄贵贤籍*), ensuring their body and mind remain ever enlightened (*究竟不昧*), and their entry into the ranks of the worthy (*贵籍*), aiding the enlightened age (*明时*).

The Celestial Auspices’ Jade Text of Heavenly Chapter,
The Southern Dipper’s Celestial Auspices Chapter:
The Mystic Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate,
The True Text and Profound Mechanism.
Overseeing celestial charts, guarding terrestrial maps,
Regulating the watery domains—together with the Three Primordials.
The Purple Court’s grand proclamation, heaven and earth alike responding.
As-you-wish in the heart, jade pressing in harmony.
This hidden text, the Three Realms united.
Ritual and music established, chaos now unfurled.
The Great Luo revealed, ascending the scene and stepping on the void.
The wise in learning, instructing the foolish below.
Swiftly, as the decrees of the Jade Text Wheel!

The Auspicious Seizing Gem of the Jade Text—
This Jade Text amulet, inscribed on the wooden altar,
Established on the *ding* day, with sandalwood incised,
Child above, *chong* below, forming the Gate of the Center.
For the Gate of the Center.

The **Wenchang Palace’s Auspicious Seizing Gem**—
When *Shēn* governs *Yǒu*, entering and exiting as the honored one.
When *Chén* seeks *Xū*, the *Kui* and *Gāng* align with the Primordial.
When *Mǎo* ascends to *Yín*, the Heavenly Primordial and Earthly Wheel unite.
Within *Chǒu*, seeking *Wèi*, the Gate of the Inner Chamber fully opens.
Within *Wèi*, obtaining *Hài*, the hidden and inverted harmonize.

The **Right Hidden Secret Incantation**—
Unveiling the Three *Qi*’s True Text of *Wenchang*,
Those who attain it should purify the heart and refine the *qi*,
Discarding falsehoods to embrace the True,
Cutting off all unrighteous thoughts—no evil imaginings.
Naturally, wisdom and brilliance increase,
Literary splendor flourishes,
Ascending the *Yuèzhāng* Heavenly Seal—
Worthy to wear and revere,
Warding off evil, dispelling malevolence,
Dissolving all demonic obstructions.

**Wenchang’s Heavenly Heart Jade Text**—
A treasure of the Highest Heaven, secretly kept in the Mysterious Capital,
Where ten thousand spirits attend and the Three Realms obey.
The **Wenchang Upper Palace’s Jade Text of Ascending the *Yuèzhāng***—
Above, it governs the Heavenly Root;
In the middle, it inspects the stars;
Below, it discerns earth and water,
Piercing the obscure and fathoming the dark.
Opening benevolence and removing dullness,
Dispelling and repelling demonic mists.
Severing the Three Corpses,
Decapitating the Nine Vermin.
Demons and ghouls retreat in hiding,
Droughts and floods bring no obstruction.
If held with reverence, one ascends in broad daylight.

**Wenchang’s Central Sovereign’s *Qi*-Generating Brand**—
**The Sovereign’s Nine Paths Commanding Life’s *Qi*-Generating Diagram**—
Since birth, humans receive their fate,
Their innate nature and roots vary—
Some are born with brilliance and literary grace,
A blessing of past karmic ties,
While others are dull and obtuse,
A result of past misdeeds.
Among those who strive for merit,
Few attain even one in a hundred,
And among those who delve into the Profound Mechanism,
Scarcely two or three in a thousand succeed.
If one turns the heart to the Dao,
Studies the Text, and explores the Profound,
They should wear the *Qi*-Generating Diagram,
Recite the *Huòluò* True Speech,
Naturally invoking *Wenchang*,
Where celestial officials and spirit clerks guard their person,
Enhancing wisdom and eloquence,
Illuminating literary splendor,
Advancing in fortune and achieving renown.

For those born in **Child (Zǐ)** and **Ox (Chǒu)**—
Aspiring to literature and seeking the Profound,
Command the *Tiāngāng* Eight Learning Spirit Officials to attend their heart and mind.
For those born in **Tiger (Yín)**—
Studying literature and advancing to the Profound,
Command the *Wēiliè* Northern Palace True Official to attend their heart and mind.
For those born in **Rabbit (Mǎo)**—
Mastering literature and exploring the Profound,
Command the *Dìngshén Yǎngruì* Positioned Spirit Lord to attend their heart and mind.
For those born in **Dragon (Chén)**—
Turning to learning and entering the Profound,
Command the *Ānhuì Yèwén* True Person to attend their heart and mind.
For those born in **Snake (Wèi)**—

Command the *Bǎoyì Dìngguāng* Grand Historian to attend their heart and mind.
For those born in **Sheep (Wèi)**—
Diligently studying and clarifying the Profound,
Command the *Tàihé Liùxíng* Six Ranks Chancellor to attend their heart and mind.
For those born in **Monkey (Shēn)**—
Advancing to the *Luán* and ascending the Profound,
Command the *Yuánmìng Zǒngxiá* True Vizier to attend their heart and mind.
For those born in **Rooster (Yǒu)**—
Practicing literature and striving for the Profound,
Command the *Dōnghuá Xiùyī* Embroidered-Robe Messenger to attend their heart and mind.
For those born in **Dog (Xū)** and **Pig (Hài)**—
Clarifying scripture and expounding the Profound,
Command the *Wenchang Yìjiè* Righteous Aid King to attend their heart and mind.

**Seasonal Governance:**
Before and after the **Spring Equinox**, governing *Kàn* (North).
Before and after the **Summer Solstice**, governing *Lí* (South).
Before and after the **Autumn Equinox**, governing *Xùn* (East).
Before and after the **Winter Solstice**, governing *Kǎn* (West).

Those who seek the Profound and fathom the subtle must examine their origins.
Only then will they know their innate reception—
Noble or lowly, the gradations of rank,
The depth of their fate, their inner purity.
If merit arises from shame or neglect,
All their aspirations will be fulfilled.
This must be carefully considered.

**Wenchang’s *Qi*-Generating Unified Form’s True Command *Huòluò* True Speech:**
*Ōm lì lì nà, ā xī xī hū hū, hé hé kuí à, hē kǒu bàn pútí duō.*
*Shì dòng zhà nán, jī xūkōng xún, qiāng gū dǐng yuè, hōng hōng ní ní.*
*Shǎn shǎn shuò shuò, guāng wén huá qīng, dìng yì jí fù, qī xīng qiào yáo.*
*Jìn dū huáng shén, móhē bōrú, dìng dīng dū lǜ, tǔ nà zhēnyuán shè.*
*Hùnyuán zhēnbó, tōng wù xuán jī.*
As the decrees command!

**Wenchang’s Stabilizing Will and Enhancing Wisdom Brand:**
**Wenchang’s Commanding Fortune, Stabilizing Nobility, Calming Spirit, and Enhancing Wisdom Incantation**—
On the eastern bank of the Eastern River,
To the south of the Western Forest,
There is the God-King *Huá*,
The Primordial Sovereign who receives the Mandate.
He governs *Wenchang*’s noble office,
Eight Confluences vibrating with literature,
Nine Radiant Lights illuminating the scholar.
The Great Seal is firmly set,
The Jade Maiden assists in writing,
The Dragon Maiden of ten thousand,
Aiding the literary chamber.
A hundred thousand clerks,
Stabilizing the heart, grasping the pivot,
Making my body one with the enlightened and luminous.
The Dao aligns with the times,
Ten thousand chapters brightly revealed,
Paying homage to the Emperor, carving the Text,
Gazing upward to contract with the Imperial Scripture.
Let my decrees be proclaimed,
Sitting to achieve peace—
On an auspicious day, receiving the talisman,
Unfurling the chapter to perform the ritual.
Eight Auras bolstering courage,
Dragon radiance soaring through the sky,
Ten intelligences enhancing wisdom,
The *Huòluò* dispelling ignorance.
Mind at ease, will manifest,
Ten thousand transformations freely flowing,
Divine insight discerning,
Heaven’s aid manifesting in the Text.
Nobility should ride upon it,
Fortune should be augmented with it,
Let me achieve greatness,
Literary splendor ever flourishing.
Plucking the Azure Dragon Maiden,
Proclaiming the True Yang,
Reciting the Jade Chapter once,
Nine Heavens’ light opens.
Ten thousand transformations brightly revealed,
Divine and luminous presiding,
Let my divine function,
Ascend to loyal excellence.
As the decrees command!

This **Jade Chapter** is named the **Nine Heavens’ Opening Enlightenment Calming Spirit and Enhancing Wisdom Incantation**—
A text of the Primordial Great Cataclysm’s Mysterious Capital,
Words without melodious beauty,
Music without ornate grace,
Deep beyond measure,
Wondrous beyond speech,
Unheard in the mortal world,
Untransmitted by the vulgar.
It is secretly kept in the *Zǐyáng* Jade Case of Cloud-Brocade.

In antiquity, the **Nine Dragons’ Ancestor, the Three Primordials’ Pure Substance Dao Lord**,
Before the **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable**,
Presided over the alliance and requested the talisman,
Passing it down to the **Upper Primordial Lady** and the **Cloud-Hua Lady**,
Who taught it to the world, instructing sincere and reverent scholars and virtuous officials.
If one sincerely wears and recites it,
They will attain radiant literary brilliance,
Divine insight’s discernment,
Ascending to noble selection,
Assisting the Imperial Will,
Broadly promoting literary culture,
Propagating the True Transformation,
Forever as a personal treasure,
To be followed and practiced as taught.

**End of the Highest Mysterious Capital *Wenchang* Commanding Fortune *Zǐyáng* Sacred Register, Volume One**

**Highest Mysterious Capital *Wenchang* Commanding Fortune *Zǐyáng* Sacred Register, Volume Two**

According to the record of **a certain resident and devout Daoist practitioner**,
Born on the **year, month, day, and hour** of my life,
Belonging to the **North Dipper’s** [star] Lord’s governance,
I, with sincere devotion, respectfully knelt before the **Degree Master, Teaching Master, and Great True Person of the Dao**,
Bowing to receive the **Highest Mysterious Capital *Wenchang* Commanding Fortune *Zǐyáng* Sacred Register** in its entirety,
And now wear and revere it as my body’s treasure.

I solemnly vow to hold in highest reverence the **Imperial True One**,
To follow the **precepts and prohibitions** with devotion,
To advance in **literary cultivation** and accumulate **meritorious deeds**,
To awaken to the **Highest Sovereign’s** mysterious mechanisms,
To dispel demonic obstructions and ascend to the **Wenchang’s** noble register,
To achieve distinction in **scholarly rank** and benefit the world in peace,
To preserve life and benefit all beings.

Should I violate these precepts,
I shall offer my body in atonement to the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**,
As decreed by the **Mysterious Statutes**!

**Wenchang’s Simplified Review Sacred Diagram**

The **Wenchang Sacred Diagram** originates from the **Chaos’s primordial division**,
When the **Highest Supreme Jade Emperor’s** *qi* coalesced into script,
With **crimson clouds and emerald mists** naturally forming chapters.
It emanates from the **Primordial Beginning Heavenly King**,
Yet bears a distinct name while sharing the same source.
It was sealed within the **Upper Clarity Dragon’s Network and Mysterious Phoenix Pavilion**,
And enshrined in the **Purple Yang Nine-Light Phoenix Glory Gate**,
Where the **Wenchang Imperial Person, the Mysterious Origin Dao Lord, and Master** preside as sovereigns of the Diagram’s Gate.
This Sacred Diagram is commissioned to **generate virtuous scholars and worthy sages**,
To assist the **sacred lineage of kingship and the Dao’s path**,
So that **talented and cultured figures flourish eternally**.
Those who wear and revere it shall receive the **Mysterious *qi* descending as spirit**,
With **literary brilliance and refined elegance**,
Their **talent and insight unbounded**,
Their **inner light reaching all things**,
No thousandfold obstruction able to block them.
They shall be attended by **three hundred sixty gold boys, jade girls, celestial officials, and divine clerks**,
Who follow the talisman to guard their person.
**You must revere and uphold this with sincerity.**

**File-Chang’s Chamber Response Eight Diagrams Rank**

The *Xūjìng* Heavenly Master said:
This text is the supreme celestial bureau’s File-Chang Bureau of Merit True Lord’s Nine Heavens Opening Transformation Sovereign,
transmitted in a prior kalpa to the Three Primordials, the Supreme Substance Dao Lord, the Upper Primordial Lady, and the Soul Flower Upper Palace Lady.
This talisman, formerly sealed within the Jade Purity Great Possession’s Golden Gate and Jade Chamber,
was entrusted to the Nine Heavens’ Treasure Fortune Venerable Gods for protection,
with celestial armored soldiers guarding the talisman and the Life-Span and Merit True Lords.
The Bureau of Merit’s Grand Chancellor oversees bestowal and revocation,
the Bureau of Noble Acclaim and Success oversees the Nine Heavens’ officials and clerks,
protecting the Mysterious Texts,
selecting scholars,
and responding to timely examinations.
They assist the Imperial Plan,
aid the flourishing of peace,
and are treasured through the ages.

Those who receive this text must not falsify its transmission.
First, manifest it in chamber meditation,
or witness strange omens by day as a sign of receipt.
If chamber response is attained,
one shall surely ascend to noble rank.

The Bureau of Merit Register states:
The above eight chamber responses,
whether manifested in imperial omens or shown in dreams,
are all auspicious signs,
and one shall surely gain noble selection.

Briefly enumerating ten omens to reveal the foreshadowing:
During the reign of Emperor Dezong of Tang,
Yao Wei, a descendant of Yao Chong,
diligent in studies and skilled in literature,
though his lofty ambitions were unfulfilled...

On one day, he encountered the Daoist **Heda (賀達)**, who immediately recognized him as **Zhang’s (章)** distant descendant and bestowed this **fajia (箓)** upon him.

Before receiving it, **Yao Wei (姚炜)** dreamed of a white cat beside his pillow. When he opened the **fajia** after receiving it, a jade cat’s omen indeed appeared as a sign of confirmation. That very year, he passed the imperial examinations and later served in the **sifu (侍从)** ranks.

During the **Shu (蜀)** reign of **Emperor Guangzheng (廣政)**, **Gao Qing’s (高慶孙)** grandson dreamed of riding a cow that struck its horns against the frame. When he spoke of this dream to the Daoist **Hudao Yuan (胡道遠)**, the latter rejoiced and said, *“This year, you shall surely pass the **jieke (解科)** examination—‘jie’ (解) is the cow’s horn, and this is an auspicious omen.”* True to his words, **Gao Qing’s** grandson was then selected for high office.

In the **Tang (唐)** reign of **Emperor Zhaozong (昭宗)**, the scholar **Zhu Han (朱涣)** was renowned for his literary brilliance. He received this **fajia** from **Zhu Daoyuan (朱道元)**, a kinsman of the imperial house, and dreamed of decapitating five tigers. The following year, he passed the examinations and rose to the rank of **Qingjin (清近)**.

During the **Song (宋)** reign of **Emperor Taizong (太宗)**, in the **Jingde (景德)** era, **Zhou Liangfu (周良辅)** received this **fajia** from the Daoist **Liu Ruozhuo (劉若拙)** of **Laizhou (萊州)**. He dreamed of being trampled by a herd of deer, dying by the roadside, and awoke in terror. That very year, he passed the examinations and later became a **shuishen (帅臣)**.

In the **Song (宋)** reign of **Emperor Shenzong (神宗)**, **Su Shi (蘇軾)** of **Mizhou (眉州)** obtained this **fajia** from the recluse **Huang Ruoshui (黃若水)** at the **Yi Mountain (颐山)** tombs in his eastern village. His father, **Su Xun (蘇洵)**, dreamed of a large ghostly head emerging from a bamboo shoot, awoke in shock, and that year, **Su Shi’s (蘇軾)** brothers both achieved scholarly distinction.

**Su Shi’s (蘇軾)** younger son, **Su Qie (蘇迨)**, one night dreamed of striking three men dead. Taking this as an omen of ill fortune, he spoke of it to his elder brother, **Su Mai (蘇迈)**. **Su Mai (蘇迈)** rejoiced and said, *“This is the **San Yuan (三元)** selection—it must be you, my younger brother.”* His words proved true.

**Huang Shu (黃庶)**, styled **Yafa (亞夫)**, of **Hongzhou (洪州)**, dreamed of a black dog protecting his feet. He had received this **fajia** from **Qi Master (齐先生)**’s disciples and took this as a fortunate sign. That year, he passed the examinations and attained the rank of **Taizhong Daifu (太中大夫)** and **Da Li Si Cheng (大理寺丞)**.

**Chao Gongwu (晁公武)**, styled **Zizheng (子正)**, on the night of **Shangyuan (上元)**, dreamed of striking three men dead in his study. He was bound by officials and brought before the authorities. Upon reaching prison, he saw his elder brother, **Chao Gongqu (晁公愬)**, styled **Zixi (子西)**, already bound and awaiting him. Startled and awoken, he said nothing. Later, when he visited **Baofeng (宝峰)** in **Lizhou (利州)**, he encountered a Daoist **Lu (鲁)**, who then showed him this **fajia**. Upon reaching the section on **chamber omens (寝应)**, he saw the omen of striking three men dead, and he performed a **jiao (醮)** to receive this **fajia**. Afterwards, his elder and younger brothers both passed the examinations with distinction.

**Pang Wu (庞武)**, the **Taishi (太师)**, before attaining prominence, wandered to **Fenglin (凤林)** in **Luoxi (洛西)**. A Daoist named **Meng Ji (蒙吉)** shared a drink with him, and that evening, after the wine had flowed freely, **Pang Wu (庞武)** stayed at the **Fenglin (凤林)** abode. He dreamed of being bitten by a white horse, which caused him great pain. When he awoke, he told **Meng Ji (蒙吉)** of the dream.

**Meng Ji (蒙吉)** said, *“You have received the **Eight Chamber Omens (八图)**—here is the **fajia** to confirm it. Accept it now.”* That year, **Pang Wu (庞武)** passed the examinations. Within fifteen years, he became a **zhizheng (执政)**, and both he and his son were appointed **Taishi (太师)**.

Toward the end of the **Jianyan (建炎)** era, **Liu Haoran (刘浩然)** of **Qiongzhou (邛州)**, from his youth studied diligently to seek advancement. He dreamed of **Sifu Zhenjun (司禄真君)** bestowing upon him the **Wenchang fajia (文昌箓)**. Upon waking, he recorded the dream and then journeyed to **Longhu Mountain (龙虎山)** to pay homage to the **Thirty-First Generation Tian Shi (天师)**, seeking to receive this **fajia**. The **Tian Shi (天师)** took it out and showed it to him, saying, *“This **fajia** is not meant for your advancement. You should pass it on, transmitting it to three nobles.”* Though he did not fully understand these words, he accepted the **fajia** and later practiced the **San Dong fajia (三洞法箓)**.

During the **Shaoxing (绍兴)** era, **Liu Haoran (刘浩然)**’s **fajia** and talismans displayed miraculous efficacy. He could summon spirits to worship **Zhang (章)**, foreknow the future fortunes of others, and was highly regarded by the scholars and nobles of the time. **Yu Runwen (虞允文)**, a man of elegant letters from **Lungzhou (隆州)**, heard of his name and knocked on his door. **Liu Haoran (刘浩然)** told **Yu Runwen (虞允文)**, *“You shall gain midlife honor and rise to **zhizheng (执政)**. You can receive this **fajia** and I will aid your literary pursuits.”* **Yu Runwen (虞允文)** asked, *“What **fajia** can I receive?”* **Liu Haoran (刘浩然)** then bestowed this **fajia** upon him.

The following year, **Yu Runwen (虞允文)** dreamed of striking three men dead in the **Kua Bie (跨鳖)** study, and awoke sweating profusely. When he opened the **fajia**, he saw this very omen. The next year, he achieved the highest rank in the **San Yuan (三元)** examinations, and later became **Chancellor (宰相)**.

In all cases, virtuous scholars and eminent Confucian literati who receive the **fajia** beforehand must first manifest the **chamber omens (寝征)**. Then, they should seek a master to receive this **fajia**, aligning themselves with the **Heavenly Will (天意)**. Only then shall they surely reap the rewards of **scholarly success (功名)**.

If they hesitate and doubt, unable to faithfully accept it, then **Sifu Zhenjun (司禄真君)** shall withdraw their divine guidance, **the spirits shall obscure their judgment (灵鉴)**, and their **lifespan and fortune (寿禄)** shall be diminished, leaving them without achievement.

If the **chamber omens (寝征)** appear after receiving the **fajia**, they shall still achieve distinction. Omens that appear before receiving the **fajia** are the **superior chamber omens (上寝)**; those that appear after are secondary.

If one reverently upholds this **fajia**, it shall aid their literary pursuits, generate the **nine Dao (九道)** and **Wenchang qi (文昌之炁)**, clear past grievances, and prevent ancestral misfortunes from lingering. The spirits cannot take away their discernment, nor can demons obstruct their talent. It shall guide their **fate and destiny (命运)**, and even malevolent stars or **evil spirits (恶煞)** cannot harm them. With steadfast resolve and an open heart, divine wisdom shall sharpen their intellect, their scholarly achievements shall flourish, and their fortunes shall extend to their descendants.

If one treats this **sacred text (灵文)** lightly, or falsely claims it from others, then the **Three Officials (三官)** shall strike with their **gubiao (鼓笔)**, and the punishment shall not be slight.

**Request for Fajia Ritual Words**
**Highest Daoist Cavern of Wenchang, Sifu Zhenjun, Ziyang Precious Fajia Ritual Words**

On the day of the **month, year, and time** of **certain year, month, and day**, the Daoist disciple **Certain Person (某人)**, born under the **Northern Dipper (北斗)** star **Certain Star (某星)** and originally from **Certain County (某乡)** and **Certain Prefecture (某贯)**, residing in **Certain Place (某居住)**, humbly and sincerely prostrates before the **Dushi (度师)**, **Jiaozhu (教主)**, and **Tian Shi (天师)**, the **Great True Person (大真人)**, to receive a copy of the **Highest Daoist Cavern of Wenchang, Sifu Zhenjun, Ziyang Precious Fajia (高上大洞文昌司禄紫阳宝箓)**** and uphold it in practice.

I humbly acknowledge that the **jade seals and jade scriptures (玉篆琼书)**** are indeed the embryonic essence of the **Taiji (太极)**. The **golden platform and laurel registers (金台桂籍)**** are all under the command of **Wenchang (文昌)**.

They contain profound mysteries and condensed Daoist essences, holding within them the **refined essence and nurtured brilliance (精毓秀)****. Thus, the **creative transformation (造化)**** unfolds silently with its responses. In the interplay of **yin and yang (阴阳)**** and the waxing and waning of **xiang (消)**** and **zhang (长)****,** the **fajia**** resonates with the **principle of non-action (无为)****. It naturally manifests the **patterns of divine efficacy (符张翼之精)****, perpetuating the **Daoist teachings that assist ruler and subjects (教翊君臣之道)****.

By this means, their merit surpasses the **golden gates (金阙)****, overseeing the **laurel registers (禄籍)**** in the **Heavenly Court (天曹)****. Their noble station governs the **jade charts (瑶图)****, demonstrating the **imperial selection (铨衡)**** in human ranks. They reveal the **wonderful standards (妙范)****, regulate the **literary edicts (文纲)****, and promote or demote without bias. This is the reliance of **ancient and modern (古今)****.

At this juncture, I humbly reflect that this humble servant was born in an age of radiant virtue, encountering the true winds of the Dao. With deepest reverence, I submit my allegiance, desiring to wear the sacred scriptures of the Nine Heavens, thereby enhancing my wisdom and knowledge. I earnestly hope to comprehend the subtle teachings of the unified Dao, that my aspirations may soon be fulfilled in the Azure Clouds, and my oaths may be as steadfast as the White Sun.

With lofty aspirations, I seek instruction from above, and with utmost humility, I vow to practice and uphold them. My heartfelt gratitude knows no bounds, and I now present my words.

Additionally, I request the Celestial Master’s sacred name, talismans, diagrams, and esoteric methods, following the prescribed rituals for my practice.
