**The Supreme Clarity Mirror Scripture**

Lord Lao said: The inner vision of Metal and Water, where yin activates yang, enables one to master this Way—dispersing the body and scattering form, transforming the One into the Myriad. Six armies arise, and beyond a thousand myriad leagues, breath traverses to and fro. Riding clouds and treading water, one enters and exits without obstruction. Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, malevolent ghosts and ancient specters—all hidden things become visible.

Through focused contemplation, one perceives the future in reverse. If you can preserve this, you shall become a Perfected King.

Lord Lao said: To practice the luminous mirror, avoid mourning households and birthing chambers. Don immaculate garments, perfumed with incense, and bathe in the five fragrances. Drink the essences of orchid and cassia, abstain from pungent and acrid foods, and forsake all rank and irritating substances. Do not approach women. In a secluded and tranquil place, within a quiet chamber—where the sounds of carriages, horses, gongs, drums, birds, and beasts cannot be heard—only then may you proceed.

The greatest taboo of this Way is startlement. Once disturbed, it cannot be restored; once failed, it cannot be accomplished. At that moment, the heart must not cling to any lingering thought, nor the ears seek to hear. Fix the mind and align the gaze, meditating with unwavering focus. Only then may it be achieved.

Lord Lao said: Obtain a nine-inch mirror, ensuring its surface is free of flaws, cracks, or blemishes. It must be clear, bright, and perfectly round, flawlessly reflecting the human countenance. In ancient times, my former master used a twelve-inch mirror, placing one before, behind, left, and right—these were called the *Four Compasses*.

Practicing this Way is exceedingly difficult to achieve swiftly and easily. If startled, great misfortune follows, for few can master it. Wenzi and Haocheng each used a single one-foot mirror placed before them, through which they beheld spirits, yet could not attain longevity.

Lord Lao said: Place a nine-inch mirror on each side—these are called the *Sun and Moon*—and you may extend your years. If you wish to disperse the body and scatter form, to sit yet vanish, to stand yet disappear, to ascend to the Yellow Court, to achieve immortality and deathlessness, to command the hundred spirits, to enter water and fire, metal and stone, wood and earth, to fly at will—then you must employ my *Four Compasses* method. If you merely seek to foreknow fortune and misfortune, the *Sun and Moon* suffice.

Lord Lao said: The method of arranging the compasses requires placing each one foot and five inches from yourself, aligned with your eyebrows. Let purple and azure threads hang down, with patterned water below, ensuring all is level. Day and night, do not close your eyes—success is marked by this. You must not close your eyes, for if a spirit suddenly appears while your eyes are shut, you may fail to see it at once, causing the spirit to depart or, if you open your eyes abruptly, leading to shock and failure.

Lord Lao said: The *Four Compasses* method will reveal venerable spirits. Do not show this to anyone who is not a superior adept of the highest truth. My Way is most profound; few in the world are worthy. It is better to conceal it within the gates of the Dao.

For those practicing the *Four Compasses*, arrange them one foot and five inches from yourself, three feet high.

- The **Eastern Compass** will reveal two immortals, wearing vermilion *li* crowns. Their faces are narrow, ears high upon their heads, and their bodies covered in black hair. Do not be alarmed upon seeing them.
- The **Western Compass** will reveal the Queen Mother of the West, attended by jade maidens.
- The **Southern Compass** will reveal the Primordial Sovereign of Central Harmony and Non-Ultimacy, with one body and eleven heads. He wears a natural crown and red robes.
- The **Northern Compass** will reveal the Heavenly August Lord, with thirteen heads. His robes and crown match the colors of the season.

Laozi said: The superior adept accomplishes this in seven days, the middling adept in ten, and the lesser adept in a month.

Laozi said: Let purple and blue form the lining, joined to nine inches; the compass should measure one foot and two inches.

Laozi said: The superior adept, in practicing this, first sees his own form, then the spirits within his dwelling, and finally the celestial deities.

The spirits may not all appear at once—most often, no more than six or seven deities will come.

Simply gaze steadily into the compass, without fixating on the deities you see. Do not speak, do not bow; compose yourself swiftly, without fear.

Laozi said: Those who practice this Dao must not fell trees in spring, nor pour water to extinguish fire in summer; in the months of the four seasons, they must not dig earth; in autumn, they must not smelt metal; in winter, they must not block water or draw from wells.

Laozi said: Those who practice this Dao must not eat liver in spring, heart in summer, spleen in the months of the four seasons, lungs in autumn, or kidneys in winter. If the spirits of the five viscera grow angry, they will cause one to lose clarity and longevity.

Laozi said: Those who practice this Dao must not slacken for seven days. Those who succeed should perform it once every seventy days, always as on the first day. This Dao can restore youth and reverse aging.

Lingyang Ziming said: It is settled and level.

Laozi said: After seeing the spirits, continue the practice, and you may ask them the essentials of longevity—they will tell you all.

Laozi said: Once the Dao of the Four Compasses is accomplished, you may hold to the Dao of the Single Compass and practice it, no longer needing the four.

Perform the twofold fast of the Dark Gate, don a green headband, ascend to the Northern Culmen, descend into the Mysterious Trace, and mirror your affairs with it.

In practicing this Dao, you must always position the Vermilion Bird three feet high above, the Dark Warrior five feet high below, the Azure Dragon nine feet high to the left, and the White Tiger seven feet high to the right. You must also tread upon the sun and moon.

Laozi said: Not only yourself—you must also have the Vermilion Bird hold a nine-inch mirror, the Dark Warrior bear a twelve-inch mirror on its back, the Azure Dragon hold the sun, and the White Tiger hold the moon. Your form will resemble that of dragons and serpents. Once you can divide your form, you may sit and see beyond the Four Seas—only then will the true beings arrive.

At night, use lamps, candles, and hemp oil for fire—this is most excellent.

To heal the sick or enter great mountains, fearing that mountain spirits and the hundred ghosts may test you, place one compass above the door and a vessel of flower-water below. Draw your sword and lay it horizontally over the water, blade facing outward. No ghost will advance. If an old demon enters the door, it will not cross the water but die, its blood pooling within.

Guard this secret; do not show it to the vulgar.

Laozi said: To repel the five weapons and the hundred evils, take a three-inch compass and cast the Round Heaven Talisman. Carry it on your person—on the right on yin days, on the left on yang days. Entering a great assembly, you will prevail, and all will fear you. My Dao is secret.

On such-and-such a year, month, and day, in such-and-such a prefecture, commandery, county, and village, Daoist so-and-so transmits the essentials of Laozi’s Four Compasses Bright Mirror to the student from such-and-such a prefecture, commandery, county, and village. The covenant is made with forty feet of white silk, one *dou* of rice, one bundle of firewood, and five *sheng* of salt. If the transmitter fails to impart the essential teachings, may they descend into the Yellow Springs with their body unwhole. Together with the former master, the Perfected Lord Zhang Baiyu, and the Metal Master so-and-so, they draw one mark as a sign. The transmission remains valid for three years; it must not be passed to unworthy recipients, or the transmitter will answer to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Those who attain immortality must not betray the original vow.

Laozi said: The Turning Heaven Talisman is also called the Round Heaven Talisman or the Covering Heaven Talisman—it was kept secret by Zuo Yuanfang.

Write it in vermilion.

*(Talisman text missing in original.)*

Laozi said: The Round Heaven Talisman averts disasters and misfortunes. It grants long life and enduring vision, preserving you as heaven does. Tigers and wolves will break their fangs and lose their teeth; the hundred weapons will not dare approach. Those who see it will prostrate themselves and dare not rise.

Whoever bears this talisman—who can know them? With left robe and right *ji*, they shall receive heaven’s blessing, live for a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, and attain boundless longevity.

Swiftly, swiftly, as in statute and command!

Formerly, the Yellow Court Perfected Person, a Daoist, bowed his head and respectfully asked: Among the qi of heaven, earth, and the five phases, humans are the most noble. Yet some live long and others do not—what is the reason?

Laozi said: Humans receive the qi of heaven and earth and should all live to one hundred and twenty years. But they indulge in joy and anger, greed and lust, fine flavors and rich foods, unable to cease grains. They find no joy in emptiness, dwell daily among the vulgar, and cannot contemplate the Dao. They are accompanied by evil ghosts, which is why they do not live long.

The Daoist said: If one could cease grains, find no joy in fine flavors, rich foods, or lust, could one transcend and avoid aging?

Laozi said: If you can love the Dao, carefully guard body and mind, and uphold the One in your person, you may attain agelessness.

The human head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, modeling earth. The five viscera correspond to the five phases, the four limbs to the four seasons, the nine palaces to the nine provinces. The eyes correspond to the sun and moon, the hair to the stars. Humans align with the foundation of heaven—thus, among the ten thousand things, humans are the most noble.

Heaven has a divine medicine called *Jiuheng*, spread throughout the world, growing in damp and moist places. Its leaves are lustrous like the male fowl, thriving and vigorous along the Dao. In the eighth month of autumn, male and female plants intertwine at the root, their branches and leaves entangled. Dragons and serpents obtain it and hide it away in their mouths.

In the third month of spring, when thunder roars, it emerges. Those who obtain and eat it store it in a stone chamber as a treasure. When Yao faced the great flood and the people suffered hunger and thirst, he ordered them to gather it, and all were saved. If you examine and consume it, you may attain divine transcendence. Sages who consume it seal their mouths and do not speak. Now I tell you—you may transcend your body.

Gather it in the mist, when male and female plants unite in the height of autumn—this is most excellent. Hang it in the north of your dwelling to dry in the shade. Pound it a thousand times, place it in a large vessel, and mix with honey to form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take three pills daily. After twenty-one days—three times seven—the Dao is complete.

On the first day of consumption, ascend to the Muddy Pellet and descend to Kunlun. On the second day, wander and rest in the Jade Hall. On the third day, pass through the Jade Gate. On the fourth day, push aside the Flowery Canopy and rest in the Crimson Palace. On the fifth day, climb Mount Hua—most excellent! All the spirits will escort you to ascend the Jade Heaven and enter the Jade Hall. After twenty-one days of consumption, men and women, young and old, will each attain their proper place.

How can one not strive with diligence? Transmit this only to the worthy.

The *Illustrated Manual of Herbs with Stalks* states: In the second month, it grows by the wayside, its color green, with nine nodes. The third node from the bottom bears twelve leaves, the fourth node twelve leaves, and the sixth node another twelve leaves—thirty-six leaves in all. Its lower root resembles a seated person, about three inches long, white at the core, with yellow skin. Its flavor is sweet and pungent.

The *Seventy-Six Divine Elixir Scripture* prescribes medicinal talismans: four distinct talismans for each of the four directions, their combination imbued with spiritual power.

- **Northern Talisman of Celestial Union**
- **Western Talisman of the Great General**
- **Southern Talisman of the Crimson Lord’s Daughter**
- **Eastern Talisman of the Azure-Tusked Youth**

Inscribe them in black and place in the north on *shou* days; in white and place in the west on *jian* days; in vermilion and place in the south on *man* days; in azure and place in the east on *cheng* days. The Yellow Lad and Jade Maiden govern the essence of the medicine. When talismans are crafted on these days and placed in the four directions, no harm shall befall the elixir.

Laozi said: The lower form harbors corpse-worms like parasites. When Daoists consume this, the worms descend with the qi, and in an instant, the eyes grow bright. This expels the corpse-destroying agent. Simply observe the days of brightness and clarity to purge the body, then drink pure and limpid water. No more than seven cycles of purification are needed; the corpse-worms will descend within seven cycles. After seven cycles, even the elderly will feel rejuvenated—then withdraw in stillness.

There are also two talismans, both derived from the eighth talisman of Laozi’s *Thirty-Nine True Talismans*. Though the original text comprises two scrolls with differing talismans, they are recorded here again. Both talismans subdue the corpse-worms.

When expelling corpse-worms, do not speak of it beforehand. Though the Three Corpses lack ears and eyes, they foreknow human intent—only secrecy ensures success. Prepare the medicine in a secluded place.

Auspicious days for entering the mountains to gather herbs:
- First day of the first month
- Twenty-fifth day of the second month
- Twenty-fourth day of the third month
- Sixteenth day of the fourth month
- Eleventh day of the fifth month
- Sixth day of the sixth month
- Second day of the seventh month
- Twenty-fifth day of the eighth month
- Twenty-first day of the ninth month
- Sixteenth day of the tenth month

These are the days when the Celestial Granary opens—journeying to renowned mountains on these dates brings good fortune.

Auspicious days for entering mountains (by month and earthly branch):
- First month: *zi* day
- Second month: *chou* day
- Third month: *yin* day
- Fourth month: *mao* day
- Fifth month: *chen* day
- Sixth month: *si* day
- Seventh month: *wu* day
- Eighth month: *wei* day
- Ninth month: *shen* day
- Tenth month: *you* day
- Eleventh month: *xu* day
- Twelfth month: *hai* day

These are the days when Heaven and Earth open—entering mountains on them is most auspicious, allowing long residence in safety and peace.

Laozi said: Carry the Mountain-Entering Talisman, inscribed in cinnabar on white silk, and you may traverse the world unobstructed.

Laozi said:
- The nameless name is the dwelling of my true self; the named name is the thief of my treasury.
- The unpossessed possession preserves my virtue; the possessed possession is the bandit of my being.

No sin is greater than lust, no misfortune greater than greed, no fault greater than desire. These three calamities are the chariot of ruin—minor, they endanger the body; major, they destroy the family.

Though fasting in purity, invoke the Three Spirits:
1. **Spirit of the Vermilion Lord**
2. **Spirit of the Luminous Lord**
3. **Spirit of the Yellow Lord**

Constantly meditate upon them, reciting their names thrice daily in all activities—walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—to transcend calamitous years. Guard this secret; do not transmit it lightly.

The first spirit wears a crimson robe and yellow skirt; the second, a yellow robe and yellow skirt; the third, a crimson robe and yellow skirt.
