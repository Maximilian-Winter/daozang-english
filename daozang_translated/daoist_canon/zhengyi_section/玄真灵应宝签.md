**Preface to *The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle***

At first, my temple was nourished by the descent upon Sword Ridge, its transmission flowing through the Clear River. With brush in hand, I inscribed twin pines, and all who prayed received responses in dreams. Yet I never disseminated these oracles in the world. Now, the temple officials of the Main Hall and the Family Celebration Tower borrow other oracles as a makeshift measure—such as the *Oracle of the Twelve Perfected Lords*, which is merely the *Oracle of the Venerable Elder of Mount Qingcheng*, or the *Yi* hexagrams used in the Family Celebration Tower, which lack any true verification. Moreover, in the temples of Shu, they employ only the inner and outer oracles of the Vermilion Perfected Lord.

Thus, I personally examined and refined their wondrous applications, encompassing the celestial patterns above and the terrestrial principles below, as well as the fortunes and adversities of destiny and the unions and separations of human affairs. I entrusted this task to my seven heirs, who, with skillful analogies and clear explanations, composed one hundred and twenty oracles each for the upper, middle, and lower grades. These are arranged by the twelve earthly branches, with thirty oracles for each, and further aligned with the five phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—to form three hundred and sixty-five oracles, corresponding to the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial sphere. May those who seek faith find fulfillment according to their aspirations.

**Scroll One of *The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle***

**First Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Auspicious Gathering of Wind and Cloud – Supreme Fortune**
A day of ascending peace arrives,
With titles and decrees bestowed.
The future holds boundless promise,
As immortal maidens ride flying dragons.

A golden terrace is built to welcome scholars and summon worthies,
A cinnabar decree confers honors and rewards merit with noble rank.
Clinging to the dragon and phoenix, one ascends steadily into the azure heavens,
Where wind gathers and clouds arise in joyous assembly upon the purple empyrean.

**Second Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Prospects of Success – Supreme Fortune**
A youth of fine character,
Wisdom surpassing Xiao He.
Plans unfold as desired,
Brows relaxed with joy.

Carriages and documents unite under one script, literature and ritual flourish together,
Virtue knows no peer, benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust are all complete.
A mere foot and a half from heaven, one kneels to receive the cinnabar decree upon the golden steps,
An extraordinary promotion grants imperial favor at the jade throne.

**Third Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Guard Carefully, Lest It Be Lost – Moderate Fortune**
Though hawks and falcons are sent in pursuit,
Beware the tigers and leopards’ might.
Dwell simply in the way of the noble,
Where can one find idle wrongdoing?

Hawks and falcons chase the cunning hare, which hides in the mountains and forests,
The might of tigers and leopards deters travelers on the road.
The noble one remains tranquil in guarding the Dao, and myriad misfortunes do not encroach,
The petty man, restless and self-serving, finds even a single scheme unfulfilled.

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Success Comes in Due Time – Moderate Fortune**
A general of a thousand *li*,
Whose brilliant strategies remain concealed.
Where waves surge and clouds roll,
Blood stains the battle robes anew.

A general of heroic strategy, when his plans are realized, will surely triumph in attack and prevail in battle,
A person of talent and ambition, when the time is right, will find the Dao flourishing and fame achieved.
With strategy in place, victory is not difficult,
With the right moment, renown is easily surpassed.

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Hopes for Success Are Dim – Inferior Fortune**
A gourd’s laughter echoes,
Seeking fame through distant schemes.
Like duckweed adrift on waves,
When will one reach the celestial thoroughfare?

Claiming the nonexistent as real, one exhausts spirit in vain,
Pointing to reality as illusion, one wearies the mind with empty dreams.
Seeking one matter is like calling for geese amidst floating clouds,
Hoping for another is like drifting duckweed in rushing currents.

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Harmony Between Kin and Friends – Supreme Fortune**
The refined households of Wang and Xie,
The states of Qin and Jin vie in splendor.
A guest who plays the flute,
Adorns himself with phoenix blossoms.

In the halls of the refined Wang and Xie, purple swallows vie in flight,
In the pond of harmonious Qin and Jin, colorful mandarin ducks pair.
Riding the phoenix and playing the flute, one roams the moonlit heavens,
Discussing kinship and striking the zither, one delights in floral adornments among mortals.

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Repeated Joys – Supreme Fortune**
The lotus curtain has just parted,
Ascending once more to the brocade terrace.
Celebrating the dragon-tiger gathering,
Exceptional talents emerge.

Joy as boundless as the blooming lotus in the azure pond,
Delight as vivid as the scenery of the brocade hall.
The dragon-tiger gathering refines the elixir, and the immortal’s nature is perfected,
Exceptional talents arise to pacify the people and assist the state.

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Change Brings Auspiciousness – Moderate Fortune**
Why persist in cramped quarters?
Harmony and joy arrive in due time.
Entrusting to fate, all is well,
Whether high or low, proceed steadily.

A cramped heart finds no ease, and the mind is not at peace,
When the scene changes to harmony, movement brings stability.
For destiny has its allotted share—advance and plans will succeed,
In all undertakings, there is no doubt: above harmonizes, below follows.

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Affairs Fraught with Deceit – Inferior Fortune**
A woman already encountered,
How can a second be tolerated?
Only because obstacles arise everywhere,
Should one stir winds recklessly.

Affairs are hindered by the meeting of three women,
Circumstances go awry due to discordant sentiments.
Still waters rise in waves when wind blows—tranquility is disturbed,
A peaceful dwelling stirs into misfortune—deception lurks unseen.

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Internal and External Harmony – Supreme Fortune**
Affinal kin are already connected,
Friends share the same tastes.
Fish-shaped letters on silk,
Preserve the customs of many households.

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Holding to Adversity Before Prosperity – Moderate Fortune**
Harmony in affinal bonds—goodwill meets and sentiments flow,
Unity in shared tastes—joyful plans bring affairs to fruition.
Fish and wild geese bear glad tidings, delighting within and harmonizing without,
The household preserves its blessings, sweeping away misfortune—above follows, below obeys.

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Holding to Adversity Before Prosperity – Moderate Fortune**
Stripped bare, renewal begins; when the time is right, the path opens.
Guard your conduct to avoid loss,
Recklessness must not be repeated.
Six yin reach their extreme—at the darkest hour, yang qi stirs to life,
The Dao, when exhausted, transforms: adversity turns to prosperity.
The principle of closure and openness cycles—there is flourishing, there is decline,
The mechanism of yin and yang—there is growth, there is decay.

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Hopes Blocked and Obstructed – Inferior Fortune**
A long sojourner finds no road home,
Ferries and bridges miss their time.
Standing on the terrace gazing toward home,
What is seen but rugged peaks?
The traveler’s longing stretches to the ends of the earth,
Hopes for success meet rivers too distant, mountains too high.
Climbing perilous heights brings hardship—paths are treacherous, roads are dangerous,
Yearning for word brings only silence—no raven’s cry, no fish’s trace.

**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Great Auspices Ahead – Supreme Fortune**
Clouds disperse, the moon shines anew,
Wind stills, waves do not rise.
The bank is high, the boat crosses of itself,
Clapping hands, the whole household prospers.
Dark clouds suddenly scatter—a full moon reveals its radiance,
Misfortune vanishes in an instant—a thousand miles lie smooth and level ahead.
Advance in one matter, advance without hindrance—wind and waves are calm,
Plan one thing, plan with success—joyful songs and clapping hands.

**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Auspicious News Expected – Supreme Fortune**
The lamp forms layered blossoms,
The pond’s lotuses bloom with rare flowers.
Only because harmonious qi overflows,
Glad tidings arrive from afar.
The lamp’s blossoms herald distant joy,
The pond’s lotuses bring delight to human affairs.
The misty harmony of qi rises, blessing all things with abundance,
Auspicious clouds and propitious mists shelter the household with well-being.

**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Unexpected Minor Joy – Supreme Fortune**
Fortune bears fruit from fading blossoms,
Joy sprouts from withered branches.
By chance, the breath of spring lingers,
A double delight arrives late with laughter.
The courtyard’s dead tree suddenly puts forth flourishing boughs,
The garden’s fading flowers happily bear peach and plum.
Hoped-for matters come unexpectedly to fruition—success is assured,
Anxieties dissolve by chance—harm is averted.

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Greatly Favorable for Advancement – Supreme Fortune**
Osmanthus seeds are richly fragrant,
Jade and jasper gleam in the jade hall.
With the wind’s aid,
Climb and soar.
Jade and jasper reflect the pure light of heaven and earth,
Rock osmanthus blooms, filling the cosmos with its golden fragrance.
The wind’s power carries one straight to the heavens—soaring for ten thousand miles,
Divine favor assists the journey—prosperity and peace attend the whole person.

**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Aspirations Fulfilled – Supreme Fortune**
Wind drives upward to the azure sky,
The roc beats its six wings in autumn.
A letter arrives from beyond the clouds,
In one stroke, one seizes the turtle’s head.
Aspirations for fame soar like the osprey taking flight in autumn,
Plans for gain prosper like orioles and swallows singing in spring gardens.
One gust of wind scatters the clouds—a thousand miles of carefree ease,
One endeavor, with divine aid—all things proceed smoothly to fulfillment.

**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Delayed Success – Moderate Fortune**
Laughter follows tears,
Yet not a hair is lost.
Crossing the boat will bring success,
The river is calm, free of wind and waves.
First wailing, then laughter—sorrow gives way to joy,
Beginning with obstruction, ending in success—loss brings gain.
When the river is calm, waves are stilled, wind is quiet—affairs are peaceful, the heart is at ease,
When there is deliverance, the time has come, fortune arrives—escaping disaster, emerging from stagnation.

**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Abundant Blessings – Supreme Fortune**
A sharp sword cuts like a breath,
Clouds rise high, mountains rise higher.
This body knows no obstruction,
Why shirk labor in food and rest?
The Dao’s virtue spreads wide, high as the sacred peaks,
Affairs proceed swiftly, sharp as a sword that severs hair.
With blessings and strength, with plans—persevere without ceasing,
No obstructions, nothing fails to pass—naturally, all is accomplished.

**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Peril and No Success – Inferior Fortune**
The ox’s tail splits,
How can the chicken’s beak bear sorrow?
Hoping for someone, no one is seen,
Turning back, affairs will be delayed.
The ox, creature of plowing—when its tail splits, fields lie fallow,
The chicken, herald of dawn—when its beak grieves, the household faces calamity.
What is hoped for is delayed, obstructed,
What is pursued is pressed, unfulfilled.

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Hopes and News Both Lost – Inferior Fortune**
Heartless, resenting broken promises,
Wind and peril, yet no boat,
The sun darkens, the road is lost,
Mist and clouds veil the azure sky.
Facing late spring, heartless and resentful—flowers fall, waters flow,
Gazing at the Yangtze, waves rise, no boat—spirit fades, soul scatters.
The red sun sets, the way home is lost—sorrow weighs on the heart,
Azure clouds obscure, still separating—parting thoughts sink deep.

**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Advancing Toward Success – Supreme Fortune**
The autumn moon is perfectly round,
Clouds part, light fills the river.
Every household knows no hindrance,
The river mirrors a single blue sky.
Clouds part, the sky clears—the moon’s brilliance shines like a flawless mirror,
Disaster retreats, blessings arise—the household gathers golden truth’s protection.
Advancing brings wholeness, no lack—light fills to the full,
Seeking gain brings no obstruction—success and joy abound.

**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Laborious Success – Moderate Fortune**
Ore exhausted, true gold appears,
Shoots grow, the soil’s depth is known.
The path to blue clouds will open,
Do not sigh over toilsome labor.
Gold emerges from ore—without refining, it cannot become treasure,
True immortals are born of mortal flesh—without merit and practice, they cannot attain the Dao.
Timely cultivation brings bountiful harvests,
Diligent labor brings no fear—plans come to fruition.

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – No Deception, Hopes Fulfilled – Moderate Fortune**
The moon is veiled by drifting clouds,
The mirror is dimmed by dust.
If there is no obstruction,
A pure, single heart shines clear.
Clouds hide the moon, darkening it—wind scatters the clouds, the moon brightens,
Dust covers the mirror, dulling it—one wipes the dust, the mirror gleams.
Though there may be vexing deceptions, they are easily dispelled,
Without the harm of idle words—peace and good fortune are preserved.

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Wealth Gained in Plans – Supreme Fortune**
Pearls and jade fill the coffers,
Wealth and grain flow freely.
Not by another’s aid,
One’s virtue grows boundless day by day.
Grain abundant for six days—one day’s plenty,
Gold and jade overflowing chests—one blessing among the Five Fortunes.
Food and wealth flourish in double splendor, ever-increasing without end,
Fortune and rank rise together, bringing timely aid.

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Success in Affairs – Supreme Fortune**
Years of nurturing build the foundation,
Wind and cloud await their moment to stir.
Together they open the Dragon-Tiger path—
What day will not bring a marquis’s seal?
A tree of great girth is not nurtured in a single day,
A marquis’s enfeoffment is the reward of meritorious deeds.
When the tiger roars, wind fills the valley—majestic power is complete,
When the dragon intones, clouds spread across the sky—thunder rolls, rain descends.

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Legal Matters Resolved – Moderate Fortune**
Legal troubles stretch on endlessly,
How many months will the delay endure?
Only by upholding fairness and justice,
Can one escape the woes of imprisonment.
Litigation ends in misfortune yet turns to fortune—do not rely on deceit,
Affairs first in chaos, then in peace—be cautious and steadfast.
Though principle rests in righteousness, escape comes first,
To leave behind prolonged entanglement is the highest good.

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Stubbornness Blocks Progress – Wretched Fortune**
The strong and weak clamor in vain,
Lonely and rugged, the door remains shut.
Secluded, with no path forward,
Hunger and cold endure till dusk.
Without righteousness or benevolence, how is this different from the strong oppressing the weak?
With greed and desire, it is like the rich devouring the poor.
Above and below, harmony is wounded—alone in seclusion,
Within and without, resentment arises—isolated in cold and hunger.

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – All Affairs Unfulfilled – Wretched Fortune**
The boat is hindered by rocks in the waves,
A traveler on foot fears crossing the river.
Clouds hang high, mountains are perilous—
In sorrow and solitude, what can be done?
Plans are fraught with fear—rocks in the water block the boat,
Intentions are anxious—a tiger at the mountain’s base bars the traveler.
Perils and obstacles prevent progress, no strength to climb,
Distress and hardship breed only sorrow—when will success come?

**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Pray for Blessing, Avoid Disaster – Moderate Fortune**
The path of bodhi lies open,
Every household shares in the incense’s bond.
To escape the snare’s calamity,
A clear, boundless sky appears.
Those of utmost goodness swiftly reach the bodhi path,
Cultivators of truth ascend the gate of joy.
With a heart free of entanglement, the body escapes the net,
With mind held in reverence, how can affairs be hindered?

**First Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Seek and You Shall Obtain – Moderate Fortune**
Gain and loss drift in vagueness,
Idle worries stretch long.
Do not shirk from diligent care—
Gold and jade will fill the chests again.
Gain and loss follow the law of ebb and flow—no need for concern,
Rise and decline are the natural order—why trouble the mind?
No affair succeeds without seeking,
No rice ripens without planting.

**Second Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Affairs Align with the Heart – Moderate Fortune**
Red and green linger to keep spring,
The beauty’s affection grows deeper.
With hairpins still fragrant,
Laughter and song rise from the grassy mat.
Harmony in agreement—no affair is not joyful,
Shared insight—all uses naturally grow close.
Incense not yet burned, new coils add their fragrance, mist swirling,
Wine not yet finished, new cups are poured—hearts delight in choice.

**Third Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Promotion in Rank – Supreme Fortune**
Spring arrives in an instant in the celestial garden,
Before the courtyard, flowers and willows renew.
The marketplace buzzes with kind words,
Even grasses and trees rejoice.
The faint rumble of spring thunder—what was buried stirs, what was low rises,
Yang qi begins to flourish—willows sprout buds, flowers burst from calyxes.
Kind words spread good tidings throughout the land,
Joyful faces carry glad news to every door.

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Wealth and Silk Bring Joy – Supreme Fortune**
Once I grieved over the times,
Now spring blooms in the grass and flowers.
Grain is abundant everywhere,
Melons and plums ripen all at once.
The times are favorable, fortune prospers—now is right, the past is wrong,
The year’s end passes, spring returns—grass sprouts, flowers bloom.
Melons and plums ripen, bearing fruit—together we celebrate the new season,
Grain is plentiful, households are provided—universal blessings abound.

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Illness Befalls the Body – Wretched Fortune**
Heaven’s calamity cannot be prayed away,
Exhausted strength cannot sustain.
The Three Worms raise their heads—
Without blood, there is no end to sorrow.
A grave illness cannot be cured—it is truly heaven’s disaster,
A lingering affliction drags on—is this not fate’s decree?
Moreover, the Three Worms feed on blood—beware their venomous peril,
The Two Mouths may strike the heart—surely this brings mortal danger.

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Minor Joys Appear – Moderate Fortune**
At ease, following true nature,
Amid flowers, lightly adorned.
Laughing and singing in the candlelit night,
Guests gather around the feast in warmth.
The body is free, the heart unburdened—carefree in natural joy,
The path of the Dao winds through subtle mysteries—at ease in the world.
Wildflowers and grasses, untouched by a speck of dust,
Lamps lit, the banquet set—countless bonds of kinship.

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Cautious Affairs Bring Small Success – Supreme Fortune**
Do not fret over empty, restless thoughts,
Go forth—do not sink into despair.
Fortunately, the times change—
Precious treasures bring joy in gold.
Board the merchant’s boat to seek fame and profit—it will not return empty,
Rely on goods to seek wealth—there will be no loss.
Awaiting change, the times prosper, the year is favorable—nothing is blocked,
Gaining gold, profit is rich, wealth is abundant—nothing is left unfulfilled.

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Medicine and Stone Ineffective – Wretched Fortune**
The illness has entered the vital organs,
Even Bian Que’s methods cannot be applied.
Medicine and stone are not bitter to the mouth—
A thousand miles away, one remedy is hard to find.
The disease has reached the critical stage—hanging in peril,
Even refined medicine lacks miraculous effect.
Though Lu’s physician or Bian Que could not administer a cure,
Even the finest elixir or divine pill could not save the afflicted.

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Grievances Remain Unresolved – Wretched Fortune**
Only because thorns have grown,
Jackals and wolves now threaten even the descendants.
In the courtyard, the candlelit night—
Ashes grow cold, half a spark remains.
Thorns of resentment arise from hatred—calamity reaches the descendants,
Wild abandon born of excess and indulgence—harm befalls oneself.

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Doubled Profits – Most Auspicious**
In the murk of candlelit night, all affairs remain obscure,
A spark lingers in the ashes—though sought, it cannot ignite.

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Doubled Profits – Most Auspicious**
As water rises, the boat ascends—
All comes effortlessly to hand.
What need is there to measure gains?
Who could rival such fortune?

The moon shines bright, the wind still—autumn’s glow reveals its splendor,
The tide swells, the vessel rides high—no need to strain at the oars.
Abundance comes in multitudes, like Han Xin leading troops,
Never shirking labor, like Kongming’s steadfast devotion.

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Great Favor in Promotion – Most Auspicious**
Not for the sake of fine prose is one exalted,
How could one know of an unexpected rise?
If one speaks of a coveted post,
The body draws near the Purple Tenuity.

Refined writings shine bright, names inscribed on the golden roll,
Scholarship profound, the self honored within the jade hall.
Holding office in a prized position, imperial favor grows daily,
The body nears the Purple Tenuity—radiance readily revealed.

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Hollow and Substance-Free – Most Inauspicious**
No form yet clinging to shadows,
On level ground, tumors arise.
Entanglements stem from oneself—
When will a hundred sorrows fade?

Without form, how can there be a shadow? From whence does the shadow arise?
Without water, how can waves be born? From whence do the waves emerge?
The empty holds no substance—rumors must be false,
The real contains the hollow—words must come from without.

**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Gradual Ease After Long Hardship – Neutral**
The困 dragon coils long in the mire,
The mountain low, the tiger’s path lost.
Gradually climbing through clouds and mist,
The red sun has not yet set in the west.

The flood dragon, denied clouds and rain, lies trapped in secluded crags,
The leopard and tiger, lost in the wilds, lurk in the undergrowth.
The noble one, dwelling in cultivation, finds the Dao flourishing—advancement assured,
The scholar, refining his craft, awaits the hour—merit and fame will naturally appear.

**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Stranded and Unbearable – Most Inauspicious**
When will the many ailments heal?
Mist and waves bar the distant road.
The horse weary, the traveler spent,
The waning sun, the howling fox and ape.

The heart finds no joy, like a lingering illness,
Affairs unfulfilled, as if blocked by perilous paths.
The horse exhausted, the traveler weary—unable to advance, unable to press on,
The setting sun, the cries of apes and foxes—unable to proceed, unable to halt.

**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Noble Support – Most Auspicious**
An arrow descends from the clear sky,
On the road, one meets horses and oxen.
Wheeled carts carry treasures,
The wind swift, the sailing boat speeds forth.

Seeking fame and office, one gains promotion through recommendation,
Treading hardship, a fine steed appears for the journey.
Treasures overflow, the cartwheels turn swiftly as if flying,
Clouds and wind favor the waters—the vessel glides smooth and fast as a galloping horse.

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Advancing or Retreating, Both Favorable – Most Auspicious**
A horse crosses the mountain ahead,
The golden crow shines upon the distant pass.
High or low, no obstacles—
Song and dance reflect joyous faces.

The golden crow ascends the Milky Way, casting bright light below,
The steed races like the wind—swift passage ahead.
Whether climbing or hastening, high or low, all is within reach,
Whether advancing or yielding, above or below, no constraints remain.

**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Hopes Dashed Ahead – Most Inauspicious**
When will the great elegance be seen?
How many days will refined culture flourish?
Only because white hairs bring sorrow,
The scholar, clutching his belly, languishes in hardship.

Prose riddled with errors—no hope for imperial examination success,
The great elegance in decline—only the hollow pleasure of lingering.
Hopes for merit and fame dashed—white-haired and unaccomplished,
Lamenting studies delayed—years wasted, old age arrives.

**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Peace and Quiet Bring Reward – Neutral**
Contentment is the foremost mechanism,
Only then does one recognize the stillness of dusk.
Let not the mirror of the heart be clouded,
Let others peer through narrow tubes.

A mind settled, thoughts clear—like unlocking the heart’s mechanism,
A will steadfast, spirit nurtured—only then does one grasp the zither’s essence.
Abandon worldly ties—let not the mirror be dimmed, clarity comes of itself,
Cultivate perfect enlightenment—delve into subtleties, wisdom’s light will appear.

**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Actions Obscured – Most Inauspicious**
The beauty resents the closed door,
Emotions severed, no connection.
Advancing or retreating, no support—
Hard to find the true path’s trace.

The beauty harbors resentment, wary of petty schemes—unease lingers,
Emotions cut off, no communication—indecision in action and concealment.
Dark and tangled affairs entangle endlessly—doubt in both advance and retreat,
Gloomy thoughts coil without cease—joy and sorrow unsettled.

**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Failure in Affairs – Most Inauspicious**
Beset by dire straits,
Yet boasting of bold spirit.
Mocking others for having no way out,
Men and ghosts rage in attack.

In peril, one should cultivate goodness to dispel misfortune,
In crisis, one should act with caution to avoid calamity.
Boasting of heroism, unaware of fate’s blows—setbacks multiply,
Jealousy and harm, seeking to injure others—men and spirits unite in wrath.

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Unexpected Joy – Most Auspicious**
A celestial missive descends from beyond the clouds,
Many carriages bearing imperial decrees arrive at the gate.
Fragrance fills the orchid chamber,
Hand in hand, one enters the toad’s palace.

A red decree descends from heaven—glory in imperial favor,
Carriages of the honored arrive—nobility graces the household.
Affairs proceed as wished, like entering a chamber of orchids and fragrance,
Plans succeed as hoped, like ascending the moon’s osmanthus palace.

**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Wealth and Status as Desired – Most Auspicious**
Precious jade, treasured and hoarded,
Year after year, the fragrant rice ripens.
Emerald shade stretches a thousand miles,
Peach and plum trees stand in rows.

A treasure mountain appears—admired like a foot-long jade,
The fragrant rice ripens—celebrating a bountiful year.
Affairs flourish—verdant shade stretches a thousand miles in harmony,
Wealth abounds—peach and plum trees stand in rows, blossoms bearing fruit.

**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Timing Brings Success – Neutral**
An affair not yet resolved,
Livelihood grows ever harder.
Yet if one follows the seasons,
Where is there no ease?

A matter remains unfinished, its course not yet complete,
Life’s path grows ever more arduous.
But if one yields to the heavens’ timing,
What place lacks tranquility?

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Eventual Relief – Neutral**
Human feelings are as fraught as climbing the perilous roads of Shu,
Plans and affairs weigh heavy as crossing the treacherous Yangtze gorges.
Yet when Heaven’s timing aids one’s livelihood, ease and leisure naturally follow;
When human affairs align with purpose, all finds resolution and rest.

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle – Eventual Relief – Neutral**
Long drought parches the land to withering,
Fields lie half-barren, half-bare.
Then from the earth wells spring forth—
Behold the life-giving rains revive all.

Prolonged drought exhausts the farmer’s strength, fields crack, seedlings wither;
Yet when a wellspring bursts from the earth, divine power averts disaster.
Suddenly, sweet rains descend—Heaven’s mercy—
And autumn’s harvest glimmers with hope.

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Misfortune Departs, Fortune Arrives – Most Auspicious**
Flowers bloom, then fade,
Joy and sorrow share one face.
Yet in life’s late season,
New blessings grace the world.

Human hearts know parting and reunion, flowers wither and bloom;
Time brings fortune and misfortune, the moon waxes and wanes.
In one’s later years, happiness arrives—wealth, longevity, peace, and health—
Just as planting mulberry in twilight brings spring’s joy anew.

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – All Affairs Gradually Flourish – Neutral**
Prayers may bring fleeting peace,
Following fate eases the mind.
Incense burns at the household altar—
Even without cause, there is pure joy.

Amending faults stills calamity, all affairs gradually flourish;
Following fate dissolves delusion, a hundred demons submit.
Devout prayers strengthen the spirits’ power,
And in pure joy, the Daoist heart finds fulfillment.

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Moderate – Some Gain**
Livelihood comes as if by chance,
Smiles bloom with the passing hours.
Content with spring’s simple pleasures,
One naturally gains treasured wealth.

Wealth and rank are but fleeting gifts from without,
Life and death, longevity and fate are decreed within.
A heart at ease brings joy and wards off illness,
Accepting one’s lot brings happiness and averts misfortune.

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Hopes Hindered – Most Inauspicious**
Age brings stumbling steps,
Words grow sharp, complaints many.
Even on level ground, obstacles arise—
Every move draws the gods’ rebuke.

Life’s path is strewn with setbacks, one sighs at age and fading blossoms;
Skills and crafts falter, time slips by, years change.
Walking level ground, one still stumbles—every step stirs wind and waves;
Attempts at plans yield no success, and gods and men alike condemn.

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Hasty Deviation from the Dao – Most Inauspicious**
The heart breaks, already wounded,
The road ahead stretches long in twilight.
Hoping for aid, none comes—
How many turns of the gut?

Panic and confusion wound the heart with a hundred cares,
Blocked paths and dead ends breed resentment.
The Dao lost, human kindness fades—vain are the turns of sorrow;
Affairs unfulfilled, even kin grow distant—futile are the toils of worry.

**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Desires Fulfilled – Most Auspicious**
A black ox bears treasured wealth,
A fine steed springs from dragon’s lineage.
Strange dreams herald heroes—
Soaring high, they ascend the celestial terrace.

A black ox carries its precious cargo, strength to bear ten thousand jun;
A noble horse, born of dragon’s blood, races a thousand li a day.
Heroes emerge, answering the auspicious omen of the Three Terraces,
Success and renown align with the four directions’ harmony.

**First Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Extraordinary Encounter – Most Auspicious**
No drifting tumbleweed am I—
A new hero rises in Heaven’s realm.
Before the *Lingyan* Pavilion, fame doubles,
With splendid favor, one bows to the Three Dukes.

A person’s fortune may lift them to immortality from level ground;
A matter’s timing may bring rank through laughter and ease.
The extraordinary arrives unbidden, joy overflows;
Before the king’s ministers, one receives splendid favor and honor.

**Second Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Isolated, Few Allies – Most Inauspicious**
Like a cauldron’s boiling waves,
A lone boat seeks to cross the river.
In a foreign land, no old friends—
Human affairs defy Heaven’s harmony.

A heart like a boiling cauldron harbors ambitions vast as the sea,
Yet in haste, no ferryboat appears to aid the crossing.
Like an army cut off, besieged by foes,
Or a traveler adrift, friendless in a strange land.

**Third Oracle of the Hour of Yin – The Petty Person’s Dao Grows – Most Inauspicious**
Frost and ice chill to the bone,
Warhorses weary on endless roads.
Perils deepen like creeping vines—
One can only sigh in the mire.

Frost’s hardening into ice is no sudden chill,
Nor is slander’s wound a single day’s deceit.
Crafty words sting deeper than a wasp’s venom,
Flattery and malice harm more than the Xiongnu’s raids.

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – The Noble Person’s Dao Wanes – Most Inauspicious**
The *Pi* and *Bo* hexagrams’ time is exhausted,
Yin and Yang block all passage.
A lone plan finds no aid—
The red sun eclipses the vast sky.

When Heaven and Earth close, it is *Pi*—stagnation brings misfortune;
When Yin and Yang clash, it is *Bo*—dissolution brings blame.
In *Pi* and *Bo*, the noble person’s Dao reaches its end,
While the petty person’s Dao waxes as Yang wanes and Yin errs.

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Small Matters Align with the Heart – Neutral**
Though distant as Hu and Yue, they may yet be kin,
Orchid and iris share a fragrance all the more fine.
Though lacking the frost-defying pine’s resolve,
One may still delight in the blossoms by the wall.

To unite without parting is *qi*—Hu and Yue may yet be one home;
To be beautiful without disorder is *jia*—orchid and iris share a chamber.
Though not the pine that scorns frost and snow,
One may still rejoice in the fragrant blooms that gladden the heart.

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Reform Brings Auspiciousness – Neutral**
The grime of past deeds blocks the path ahead,
Vicious and crooked affairs bear no fruit.
But uphold fairness and integrity—
In an instant, one aligns with the divine.

Where no thorns block the road, the great Dao lies open;
Where the slightest doubt lingers, abandon the crooked path.
Reform and renew—auspicious fortune will gradually arrive;
Uphold rectitude and sincerity—the gods will surely bless.

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Striving Opens the Path to Prosperity – Most Auspicious**
Years of hidden toil—
In one night, a rainbow’s breath.
The Northern Dipper shines clear, unobscured—
Behold the gleam of the Three Heavens’ blade!

One who strives in study will surely see success;
One who strives in ambition will not lack a moment of triumph.
A three-foot divine blade flashes, sweeping away a thousand evils;
The Northern Dipper’s seven stars turn, guiding the workings of creation.

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – First Sorrow, Then Auspiciousness – Neutral**

Spring winds, though not yet thick,
Still evoke the visage of old.
Wait until autumn clouds roll back—
Daylight brightens, layer upon layer.

Spring winds first stir harmonious qi, yet the myriad things remain unborn;
Autumn moon at last reveals its radiance, and a hundred auspices gather.
If divining hopes, first darkness, then clarity—only when bright does fulfillment come;
In all undertakings, first adversity, then prosperity—only when flourishing does life begin.

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Forsaken Within and Without – Most Inauspicious**
At home, kin grow estranged;
In work, harm befalls the self.
Restless and ill at ease,
When will old traces renew?

Households in turmoil—loved ones drift apart, dear ones depart;
The self in disarray—wisdom turns to folly, skill to clumsiness.
Forsaken, strength wanes—how can one bear a thousand jun’s weight?
Far-traveling, tossed by towering waves—how can a single leaf stay steady?

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Unsettled in Person and Wealth – Most Inauspicious**
Worries keep kin and neighbors distant;
Wealth dwindles, strength fades.
Forced to tread separate paths—
Where to find level ground?

Worries near at hand must be heeded, as if they were next-door neighbors;
Wealth lost is feared as if stolen by thieves.
Separation brings perilous roads and treacherous ways—where is the level path?
Unsettled, hearts drift, affairs falter, and discord arises.

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Startled and Anxious, Ill-Timed – Most Inauspicious**
The dragon’s bright pearl is lost in slumber;
The tiger’s tracks vanish in the wild.
When will one rest easy—
Startled and sorrowful as the setting sun?

A tiger without claws loses its might, trapped in a secluded valley;
A dragon bereft of its pearl sees its power suddenly fade, hidden in the abyss.
Startled, as if seated on thorns;
Sorrowful, as if lying on a bed of needles.

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Soaring Ambitions in Sight – Most Auspicious**
Climbing high with the bearing of dragon and phoenix—
How could one resemble the wren’s brood?
The earth is veiled in mist and rain—
In a single night, one soars to the celestial pond.

The swan-goose’s ambition scorns the sparrow’s flock;
The roc’s talent cannot be compared to the wren’s.
Soaring on the wings of the *feihuang*, traversing ten thousand li—elevated by the noble;
Thriving in freedom across the four directions—ascending to join the common and the refined.

**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Hopes Fulfilled, Wealth Attained – Most Auspicious**
One move seizes the initiative;
By dusk, black and white are decided.
Upon the great river, a favorable crossing—
Spread your wings and soar high.

Planning affairs is like a game of *weiqi*—the evening’s calculation precedes success;
Advancing hopes is like archery—aim here, strike there.
With a boat at the ford, why fear failure to cross?
With wings to aid flight, why worry of not soaring?

**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – First Hollow, Then Substantial – Most Auspicious**
Thunder shakes the heavens’ thoroughfare;
Dark clouds press close, unyielding.
Suddenly, the life-giving rain arrives—
A deluge of blessings, bearing the celestial decree.

A downpour descends only after dense, brooding clouds gather;
Favor and rank arrive only after diligent service to the throne.
The life-giving rain revives the fields, nourishing all things—years of plenty, seasons of abundance;
The vermilion decree bestows praise—virtue is lofty, merit profound.

**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Discord in Human Affairs – Most Inauspicious**
Wine cups feigned in camaraderie,
Amid blossoms, quarrels arise.
Resolving grudges, grudges remain;
How to endure the petty man’s deceit?

From toasts, mockery arises—strife erupts at once;
From laughter, disputes emerge—tongues wag in an instant.
Thus, enmity forms—grudges pile high as mountains;
Hasty actions breed calamity—woes accumulate like the sea.

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Worries Without True Misfortune – Most Inauspicious**
Within the house, a snake’s dread lingers;
The horse neighs in vain lament.
In the scorching land of smoke and fire—
The red sun’s light is obscured.

A flying serpent invades the home—how can doors and windows be secure?
A lean horse neighs—how can travelers arrive?
Fire blazes in vain—false alarms arise, demanding vigilance day and night;
Clouds veil and obscure—fears loom, dreading the day, trembling at dusk.

**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Heaven’s Tidings Gradually Return – Most Auspicious**
Long exiled at the wayside pavilion,
Clouds parted as the calling bird brought a letter.
Last night, the lamp’s wick blossomed—
Tomorrow, the jade pendant will be drawn.

Wandering the ends of the earth, long cut off from a single word of good news;
The migrating swan arrives, suddenly bearing a letter of ten thousand treasures.
The lamp’s wick unfurls layer upon layer—joyful tidings arrive at the door;
The magpie’s cries ring clear—glad news enters the household.

**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Venturing Forth Brings Auspiciousness – Most Auspicious**
To hasten is to delay;
Seizing the moment dispels doubt.
By the deep green, stable riverbank—
Where is there not harmony?

Hesitant, torn between advancing or retreating;
Uncertain of the path, waiting to act, yet silent.
Fortunately, the scenery of a hidden realm is everywhere—why not enjoy it?
No desolate lands or idle worries—why not embrace contentment?

**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Affairs Unhindered – Most Auspicious**
The jade mirror, unstained by dust;
The golden blade, sharp enough to cut.
Naturally, a beautiful affair unfolds—
How could it gather dust?

A mirror polished and clear can discern beauty and ugliness;
A blade swift and sharp can cut through hardness and softness.
Unsullied by dust, obstructions and hindrances are removed;
A perfect affair nears completion—only then does the heart rejoice.

**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Hesitation in Affairs – Most Inauspicious**
Across the river, the cawing of crows;
The road ahead, blocked by shoals.
The gods mock in jest—
No path leads to the immortal’s altar.

Crows caw, beasts howl—only idle chatter;
Roads blocked, paths lost—sighs of lament arise.
The gods scold in anger, heedless of grave faults;
The way is cut off—one’s virtue is meager, one’s power slight.

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Wealth Lost, Discipline Lacking – Most Inauspicious**
The more one amasses, the more one loses;
Seeking wealth, affairs grow sluggish.
Returning home, as if in a drunken dream—
Idle worries breed sorrowful thoughts.

The greedy, ever grasping—what they gain, they soon lose;
Deceitful schemes bring no fortune, only calamity.
Thoughts in disarray, muddled as in a drunken dream;
Minds astray, restless with tangled, sorrowful reflections.

**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Loss of Person and Wealth – Most Inauspicious**
The flying crow cannot be pursued;
Clouds and rain darken the sky.
Seeking truth, one loses the way—
Where is there no cause for sorrow?

Crows fly, hares run—the sun and moon pass, irretrievable;
Clouds darken, rain falls—the heavens and earth dim, inscrutable.

**Seeking the Dao, Losing the Path – Immortals Unmet, the Way Unfulfilled**
Alone in sorrow, profit ungrasped, fame unattained.

**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Late Success Yet Hopeful – Neutral**
The iron inkstone wears thin from grinding—
What can one do but linger in delay?
Sails unfurl on autumn’s swelling tide,
As the Herd-Boy and Weaver-Girl cross the Silver River.

Ambitions unmet, the iron inkstone may yet be worn through;
Fortune unturned, schemes exhausted bring no gain.
Wait for late success—autumn’s hues like spring’s return—
In time, even the aged may thrive, the withered grow strong.

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Meeting Knowledge, Joy Arises – Most Auspicious**
Long mired in mud and sand,
Star-gold scatters into blossoms.
By the hand of a master craftsman,
It dances forth as the Yellow Sprout.

True gold buried in mud and sand cannot be shaped without refining;
Fine jade hidden in rough stone cannot be revealed without polishing.
The Yellow Sprout emerges from the earth, meeting a true immortal;
White jade gleams, encountering a skilled artisan.

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Action Flows Freely – Most Auspicious**
Youth soars on azure clouds,
Vigorous qi ever ascends the void.
Timing now in hand,
One flies high, escaping the cage.

A cloud-laddered climb to pluck osmanthus in the Moon Palace;
Long-held aspirations take flight through the heavens.
For the unobstructed, the path ahead lies open, the journey far;
For those in tune with the times, all flows smoothly, the heart at ease.

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Affairs Pass, Void and Perished – Most Inauspicious**
Defeat cannot bear recounting—
Mountains loom, the sun dims.
The horse bolts, hope lost—
Only a wisp of smoke from a lone village.

Mountains high, the sun setting—time for sorrow and care;
Defeat in retreat—momentum broken, edge lost.
Affairs unfulfilled bring vain toil, horses bolt, men flee;
The Dao unmanifest, schemes dissolve like smoke, fires fade.

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Illness Befalls the Body – Most Inauspicious**
Dreams breed deeper sorrow,
Heartless ones grow more troubled.
When will one seek the healing herb?
Turning back, how many autumns have passed?

A mind beset by confusion finds no peace in dreams;
A spirit taxed by striving scatters in disarray.
Endless desires bring inevitable stumbles and woes;
Relentless pursuits must yield unending afflictions.

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Contentment Preserves Peace – Inauspicious**
Knowing one’s place brings tranquility;
Restless striving courts misfortune.
To bend or stretch—know the Dao,
And joy will crease the brow in laughter.

Those content know when to stop, when to be satisfied;
Those serene preserve life and destiny.
In stillness, stillness may bend or stretch;
In delusion, delusion leads to stagnation and decline.

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – A Small Circle of Kindred Spirits – Neutral**
Beyond the courtyard, the heart lies empty—
Suddenly, the cry of phoenix and simurgh.
Cutting gold, one knows the intent;
Recognize the zither of Bo Ya.

An empty heart holds no entangling worries;
Hearing the cry, one knows the auspice of phoenix and simurgh.
Cutting gold, one meets the elegance of yielding counsel;
Tuning the zither, one finds a friend of true understanding.

**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Yin – Achievement and Recognition – Most Auspicious**
Morning strolls by the lotus lake,
Evening ascends the Tower of Lingyan.
With bold resolve, one sings of this journey—
The horse’s hooves press close to the sun’s corner.

Virtue perfected, one roams the ten isles and master peaks;
Merit complete, one wanders freely through the four seas and five lakes.
Deeds and honors both fulfilled, one’s name may grace the Tower of Lingyan;
Lofty aspirations soar—one’s person may ascend with the qilin and phoenix.

**First Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Toil with Hope – Most Auspicious**
The sheep’s gut path fraught with knots,
The world’s road truly steep and harsh.
Where fortune and steed converge,
One may climb the clouds and skies.

Affairs breed overthinking, the heart a tangle of a hundred knots;
The world’s path is arduous, the Dao unyielding, strength scarce.
First endure the perils of wind and frost—do not grow proud in success;
Next, meet the support of fortune and steed—do not slacken in contentment.

**Second Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Renewed Pursuit, Hopeful – Neutral**
Reordering the tangled threads,
Repairing the battered boat for the swift gorge.
If one meets spring’s bounty,
Flowers and willows burst forth at once.

The path ahead unclear—one river crossed, another mountain looms;
Plans unfulfilled—tangled threads lead to more tangled ends.
A damaged boat, once mended, may yet cross the Qutang Gorge;
Sweet rains return, renewing flowers and willows.

**Third Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Beware Repeated Troubles – Neutral**
The heart’s threads tangled as hemp,
Waves upon waves of blossoms.
When will one diligently sweep and polish,
To return to the old friend’s home?

A flurry of disturbances—one affair departs, another arrives;
Endless waves—one recedes, another surges.
To sweep and polish is to clear away trivial vexations, small grudges fade;
To turn back is to repent past wrongs, great anxieties cease.

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Many Obstacles – Most Inauspicious**
The white-haired one not yet old,
Yet much suffering dries the bowels.
Everywhere thorns and brambles—
When will sorrow be forgotten?

One not yet old speaks of the sorrow of white hair;
Affairs already withered spur vain sighs of dried bowels.
The path ahead blocked by thorns and thickets—no forward progress;
The road behind fraught with peril—no swift escape.

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Hopes Fulfilled – Most Auspicious**
Intent on seizing the moment,
The meeting not by chance.
Office and rank both well-placed,
Flowers and brocade reach the plain.

Plans laid in advance bear fruit later;
Office and fortune favor those who act—auspicious and smooth.
Well-placed, the scene unfolds like flowers and brocade;
The meeting is no accident, no mere coincidence.

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Family Prosperity – Most Auspicious**
Peach and plum grace the courtyard,
Streams and mountains frame the distant house in green.
Heavenly fragrance lingers unbroken,
The landscape renews with the seasons.

Spring’s lush hues—peach and plum in fragrant bloom;
Autumn’s clear light—streams and mountains free of dust.
Heavenly fragrance, once kindled, scatters the mist of orchids;
The landscape, ever new, safeguards the family’s blessings.

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Deceit and Ignorance – Most Inauspicious**
Jade and stone hard to distinguish,
Treachery and deceit beyond discussion.
Resentment arises from hidden malice—
Snakes and rats devour one another.

Jade and stone indistinguishable;
Treachery and deceit defy reason.
Grudges born of dark poison;
Snakes and rats turn on their own kind.

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Aid Received – Most Auspicious**
Go forth without delay,
Step the Dipper’s path at heaven’s edge.
A single breath swallows the towering wave,
A galloping steed borrows the thunder’s roar.

The road ahead lies smooth—cast not the thought of hesitation;
Auspicious signs assist, revealing the radiance of stars and constellations.
The giant wave rises by the wind’s forceful breath,
Dense clouds gather, attaining the thunder’s mighty sound.

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Deceit and Falsehood – Most Inauspicious**
Mouths speak only empty words,
Cold hearts feign agreement.
Mocking others’ beastly faces,
They shift like rain and clouds.

False speech adorned with artifice—listeners find it sweet as reed pipes;
Deceitful words, hollow phrases—tastes like honey to the unwary.
Trusting lightly, keeping few promises, they know only surfaces, not depths;
Human faces, beastly hearts—joy in the morning, rage by dusk.

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Success Achieved – Most Auspicious**
Nine refinements perfect the cinnabar,
Swallowing whole the sun and moon’s splendor.
True as the dragon and tiger’s mystery,
Heaven and earth unite in a single sprout.

The elixir’s wondrous medicine lies in ninefold refinement;
Wealth, longevity, and well-being arise from the Five Phases’ purity.
When clouds part, the sun and moon shine in full brilliance;
With the Dao in one’s heart, dragons and tigers gather in reverence.

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Dao-Fruit Fully Realized – Most Auspicious**
Immortal bones rival the towering pine,
Divine elixir recognized by Ge Hong.
Crane cries hasten beyond the clouds,
One dwells amid the azure heavens.

Dao-bones and immortal bearing compare to the pine’s vigor;
Tortoise years and crane longevity match the bedrock’s steadfastness.
Merit and practice fulfilled, one becomes a celestial guest beyond the clouds;
The Dao-fruit perfected, one may dwell as an immortal of Penglai.

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Contentment Brings Success – Most Auspicious**
Wine cups stir idle madness—
Whose home knows the butterfly’s frantic dream?
Awake, one must rouse oneself;
After autumn, time stretches long.

Harming truth, disordering nature—like Bi Zhu’s drunken greed;
Bewildering the mind, confusing emotions—like Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream.
The wakeful should early attain clarity, as the dawn breeze clears the shore;
The wise and virtuous, content in their lot, know the evening moon’s brightness.

**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Separation and Loss – Most Inauspicious**
Soul and dream chase clouds in flight,
The traveler has not yet returned.
Horses bolt, people flee—
Only tears stain the robes.

Clouds drift beyond the sky, dream-spirits scatter without trace;
Gulls float on the waves, people and wealth part, all lost.
Horses and oxen bolt, their harnesses unchecked—
Matters cannot be retrieved; tears flow, sorrow arises, grief cannot be dispelled.

**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Household Misfortune – Most Inauspicious**
Unaware, a severed snake brings harm,
Hawks take flight, ranks scatter.
Crows cry after spring rain,
People toil beneath the sun’s glare.

Geese lose their formation—hands and feet falter, brothers turn against one another;
Snakes sever limbs—flesh and bone suffer, husbands and wives clash.
Crows cry after rain—vain sighs fill the eyes;
Flowers wither, people toil in the sun, sensing only chaos within.

**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Divine Protection – Most Auspicious**
No deed goes unrewarded,
Hidden virtue assuredly moves the gods.
A path to soar now opens—
With one leap, leave the dust behind.

Those who bestow hidden virtue will surely receive bright recompense;
Those who perform good deeds will surely feel blessings descend.
Above, one may exalt ancestors and uplift descendants—fortune thus flows;
Below, one may bless children and grandchildren—divine protection thus abides.

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Unexpected News – Most Auspicious**
Swallows alight at heaven’s edge,
Step by step, the horse’s tidings arrive.
Unforeseen matters beyond hope—
Red and green unfold in succession.

Spring’s gentle light carries swallows’ joyful news;
Autumn’s clarity bears geese’s auspicious tidings.
The longed-for traveler arrives unexpectedly—flowers bloom in vivid red;
Matters proceed smoothly—willows spread their verdant shade.

**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Delay Followed by Ease – Neutral**
Rain trails darken the mountain’s face,
The traveler departs but has not returned.
Wait for the wind’s force to gather—
The bright moon will illuminate rosy cheeks.

Rain thickens, mountain paths grow perilous;
The traveler is hindered, word scarce.
Gradually, rain scatters, clouds disperse—ease and delight arise;
Soon, wind clears, moon brightens—smiles break forth, faces lighten.

**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Restlessness and Loss – Most Inauspicious**
Idle worries press urgently,
Shocking waves pursue this heart.
Speechless, one clutches resentment—
Ghosts and men rage in assault.

Endless fretting is called anxiety;
Sudden, violent turmoil is called shock.
Shock disrupts the heart’s peace—resentment takes hold;
Silent, human affairs turn hostile, dark ghosts scheme harm.

**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Smooth Progress Ahead – Most Auspicious**
Willow shade just fresh and lush,
Pine trunks already towering.
With intent, spring knows no end—
The southeast holds the greatest promise.

Bamboo stalks and pine trunks fear not frost and snow’s assault;
Scholartree shade and willow boughs meet the season’s gentle warmth.
Fortunately, the lord’s intent revives the withered and decayed;
No harm in summer’s radiant wanderings—joyful aspirations will be fulfilled.

**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Assistance Received – Most Auspicious**
Midstream, the boat seems lost—
Relying on a single gourd, it is saved.
With the wind’s aid, it reaches shore—
The wheeling moon illuminates the blue heavens.

The boat, adrift midstream, faces imminent ruin;
Thanks to another’s rescue, life is restored in an instant.
With favorable winds, the shore is reached—peace returns, affairs stabilize;
The red sun ascends the sky—darkness yields to brightness once more.

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Favorable Prospects – Most Auspicious**
Affection flows through the River of Brocade,
In the imperial city, lotuses bloom anew.
All is ground for ascent—
Parting clouds, gaze upon the nine heavens.

Affection harmonious, the Dao flourishes—behold the embroidered rivers and mountains;
Merit achieved, fame soars—glory shines in the imperial capital.
Soaring on winged steeds, the heart heeds not the toad in the moon;
Clouds part, the body may ride upon phoenix and crane.

**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Discord and Error – Most Inauspicious**

**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Minor Doubts Yield Success – Neutral**

Flat ground rises as clouded mountains,
Veil upon veil—no path to climb.
Resentments mount, sleeves hide empty tears;
A foot’s distance spans clouded skies.

Clouded peaks layer upon layer—only then is the road’s constraint known;
Moonlight dims, the osmanthus of Guanghan hard to pluck.
Resentments accumulate, many harbor venomous grudges—take heed in action;
Shallow bonds, affairs entangled—conduct and concealment both awry.

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – No Fixed Course – Most Inauspicious**

A body like a floating bubble,
Drifting with the wind like willow fluff.
Waves yet unsettled—
Where to seek trace or reason?

This body resembles a fleeting bubble, now born, now gone;
All affairs are like windblown catkins, now gathered, now scattered.
Hopes rise and fall like bubbles on water;
Plans shift like floss in the storm.

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Certain to Gain Exceptional Favor – Most Auspicious**

Cranes cry along the way ahead,
Mandarin ducks knock at the jade pot.
Heaven’s kitchen sets its feast—
Joy in the noble’s support.

Phoenix and crane take flight, carefree aspirations fulfilled;
Mandarin ducks pair in expectation of favored delight.
Heaven’s kitchen arrays its finest delicacies;
The noble lends aid, virtue’s hidden grace.

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Strategies Assured of Victory – Most Auspicious**

Which strategy takes precedence?
Talent is foremost in worth.
Favor and marvel yet unwaning—
A thousand leagues spurred on alone.

The subtlety of schemes is called *chou*—knowing the minds of gods and spirits;
The art of calculation is called *ce*—victory or defeat in grasp or lack.
With both in place, triumph comes easily;
A thousand leagues spurred—merit’s path lies open.

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Verbal Hostilities – Most Inauspicious**

Words and deeds at odds,
Empty debates of right and wrong.
Unknowing of honor or disgrace—
Lightly the trigger is sprung.

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Hopes Within Reach – Neutral**

The steadfast hesitate no more,
Another cup to toast parting’s shore.
Fret not the shadow’s thinning frame—
The courtyard moon illumines winter’s plum’s acclaim.

Hesitation and delay often meet with setbacks’ chain;
Another cup of wine may yet rekindle joy’s refrain.
A shadow’s frailty first appears in sorrow’s weight;
The moon on frosted plum arrives as fortune’s late delight.

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Joy’s Gradual Blossoming – Most Auspicious**

The crescent moon not yet full,
Behold the osmanthus’ pendent pull.
Though the steed’s hooves move not swift,
Laughter and smiles the brows uplift.

The new moon’s birth foretells reunion’s trace;
A horse’s slow step hides a gallop’s pace.
For rank and title, from small to great, favor unfolds in layers deep;
For wealth and emolument, from narrow to wide, joy’s tide runs steep.

**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Mao – Kin Scattered – Most Inauspicious**

A lone goose loses its flock,
A single cry—none answer’s shock.
Gazing for one now gone from sight,
How many clouds stretch o’er the height?

The goose bereft of flock foretells a spouse’s grief;
Its mournful cry bespeaks a sibling’s parting brief.
For kin, it portends life’s sundering or death’s divide;
For schemes and deeds, it warns of woes and strife untried.

---

**First Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Heaven’s Blessing Bestowed – Most Auspicious**

Beyond the heavens, drifting clouds disperse,
True immortals descend with jade-toned verse.
Fortune and splendor, fate’s rich thread,
Joy fills this house and hearth instead.

When floating clouds disperse, heaven’s breath grows bright, earth’s qi serene;
When true immortals gather, the household thrives, the public weal is seen.
Bestowing grace and virtue, one’s fate unfurls like brocade’s sheen;
Revering the Dao and honoring truth, blessings stretch long and serene.

**Second Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Obstructed in Seclusion – Most Inauspicious**

Beyond the heavens, clouds arise,
The moon’s radiance dims, its light denied.
A traveler on a mountain path so steep,
No further step—his journey’s sleep.

Floating clouds veil the moon, its osmanthus glow eclipsed, bereft of light;
A treacherous path thwarts the traveler, his way lost in the night.
Matters urgent yet unmet—forward progress barred;
Affairs obstructed, unresolved—retreat is marred.

**Third Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Human Relations Thwarted – Most Inauspicious**

Jade and stone lie buried deep,
Worthy and foolish none may keep.
Right and wrong as one appear,
How can harmony hold here?

The purest treasure, the fairest gem is jade;
The coarsest, hardest stone is but its shade.
The worthy bear both talent and virtue’s glow;
The foolish lack both—fit for naught they show.
Since truth and falsehood blur, distinctions fade,
Human affairs in discord’s grip are laid.

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Virtue’s Intent Brings Celebration – Most Auspicious**

Alone I tread the clouded height,
A journey vast, ten thousand li in sight.
No barrier stands in the way,
Phoenix and crane in freedom sway.

Through boundless clouds, far from the dust’s embrace,
Ten thousand li reveal the path’s vast space.
Unobstructed, the heart’s intent finds its way;
In carefree joy, celebration holds sway.

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Wishes Fulfilled – Most Auspicious**

A thousand treasures ripe in autumn’s glow,
Joy’s echoes reach the wind-swept tower’s brow.
With fragrant incense and devout prayer,
A hundred gods their blessings share.

As myriad grains mature and treasures yield,
A thousand blessings gather, heaven’s harmony revealed.
With fervent incense, virtue’s weight grows deep;
With steadfast faith, joy’s peace runs sure and steep.

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Harmony and Success – Most Auspicious**

Spring’s hues fill the immortal’s garden fair,
The breeze is mild, the blossoms bright and rare.
A heart at ease, no cares to bear,
Each act aligns with heaven’s care.

Gentle winds and radiant sun make grasses lush and flowers bright;
Joyful moments ease the mind, dissolving every plight.
Though things in spring may seem withered or decayed,
With the Dao’s aid, success in name and gain is naturally made.

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Chen – First Sorrow, Then Joy – Neutral**

A lone boat in the tempest’s grip,
The heart’s desire yet unmet’s trip.
But hands reach from the distant shore,
At last, all troubles are no more.

Fierce winds and towering waves arise from unseen deep;
A solitary boat drifts, its passenger in dread’s steep keep.
Yet with divine protection, harm is stayed, the heart finds peace;
With aid from others, safety comes, and strife must cease.

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Advance and Retreat Unsettled – Most Inauspicious**

Trifles vex the heart’s repose,
Human ties in discord close.
Hopes once cherished, now askew,
Advance and retreat both fail to do.

No matter great or small, affairs that stir the breast
Leave those who seek success or passage sore oppressed.
A troubled heart finds no repose;
Futile efforts bring no close.

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Retreat Ensures Good Fortune – Neutral**

The moon sinks at the fifth watch’s end,
The household shuts its gate, alone to fend.
Pacing, no progress made,
Return to guard my hermitage’s shade.

As the moon dips west, the night’s last watch is spent;
Alone behind closed doors, ennui’s weight is felt.
Calm the heart, still thoughts of worldly strife;
Guard the Dao, nurture spirit and form in tranquil life.

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Auspicious Omens Bestow Blessing – Most Auspicious**

Autumn’s hues fill Dongting’s expanse,
The bright moon gilds the rippling dance.
Take the skiff and swiftly go,
Seek Penglai’s isle where treasures glow.

Dongting’s autumn night, the moon’s vast light on waves does play;
Penglai’s radiant spring, the cosmos in warmth holds sway.
A skiff glides smooth, the wind still, waves at rest;
The great elixir wrought, immortals may be blessed.

*Beginning of the Middle Scroll of the Precious Oracle of Mystic Truth and Numinous Response*

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Matters Bring Discontent – Middling**

Fallen leaves fill the courtyard’s ground,
The west wind sweeps the night abode.
The recluse’s heart knows no delight,
How may weariness ever take flight?

Spirit weary, will exhausted, faces the west wind’s mournful sway;
Affairs clumsy, plans awry, sighs at leaves parting their spray.
To cast aside yet cannot—like fowl played with in vain;
To seek yet cannot—like mistaking geese for broth’s gain.

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Hopes Unfulfilled – Most Inauspicious**

Stars and moon show faintest light,
Dim radiance leaves affairs unclear.
The pavilion’s guest departs in haste,
Heart’s burdens vex the spirit’s grace.

The new moon rises, yet no fullness in cassia’s glow is seen;
The heart’s desire unmet, still tangled in discord’s sheen.
Old friends depart swiftly, sorrow of parting weighs the breast;
Affairs disturb the mind, hardship and hindrance block the quest.

**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Stagnation Now Eases – Most Auspicious**

Withered trees meet spring anew,
Fragrance fills the dawn’s own hue.
With you I share this joyful sight,
And follow time’s renewing light.

Roots’ wood meets spring’s breeze—leaves flourish, branches thrive;
The virtuous meet fate’s favor—names rise, ranks arrive.
Though freed from long stagnation, virtue’s path is walked anew;
Fortune’s hour now shines—fragrance shared in joyful view.

**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Ills Fade, Sickness Leaves – Middling**

Long bound by lingering ailment’s chain,
Worries deep as demons’ reign.
Suddenly good medicine appears,
Lightly soaring through clouded spheres.

Endless stagnation like a chronic malady’s embrace;
Layered sorrows like dwelling in a desolate place.
A potent remedy arrives—illness retreats, health restored;
A noble guide lifts one beyond the common horde.

**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – From Misfortune to Blessing – Most Inauspicious**

A lone traveler sets out by night,
Clouds dim, the moon’s pale light.
Only regret fills the desolate air,
Turning back finds no refuge there.

The lone traveler departs as night deepens, the moon descends;
The troubled soul acts—plans flawed, schemes unamend.
To press onward brings unseen peril’s dread;
To retreat offers scant safety instead.

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Advancement Ahead – Most Auspicious**

Literary triumph brings return,
Grace bestows robes of honor earned.
Radiance shines with growing might,
Fortune and rank in union bright.

Triumph in the literary field—success as easy as plucking grass;
Advancement in court—favor bright as the sun’s vast pass.
Virtue flourishes, rank and glory rise;
Fortune and blessing make the household thrive.

**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Inner and Outer Turmoil – Most Inauspicious**

Silent, seated in the empty hall,
A troubled heart remains in thrall.
How bear the paths of men and ghosts,
As household affairs bring ceaseless woes?

Within, discord stirs from family strife;
Without, affairs bring no peace in life.
Grief knots the heart—ghosts and men sigh in despair;
Silent resentment grows—joy scarce, sorrow fills the air.

**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Peace and Blessing Settle – Most Auspicious**

At dawn, a single incense burns,
Heaven’s will guards and safety turns.
Turn the heart to the great Dao,
Blessings naturally ever grow.

Morning prayers seek the household’s peace;
Sincerity through night brings lengthened ease.
One good deed draws a hundred spirits’ aid, blessings align;
One evil act—ten thousand woes dispelled, faults forgiven, divine.

**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Heart’s Distance, Affairs Delayed – Middling**

A thousand bushels weigh the ship down,
Waves still clog the ford’s renown.
A thousand-mile ambition stored,
Yet not a single pole’s accord.

The boat grounded on shoals—no oar may stir, no startle’s sound;
Affairs meet obstruction—no progress may be found.
A thousand-mile ambition, yet each step meets delay;
A hundred schemes devised—what use, what way?

**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Sincerity and Fate at Odds – Most Inauspicious**

The child lacks cunning’s art,
Dim wit cannot play its part.
Guard what little will remains,
Till white-haired, home he gains.

The child’s mind lacks wisdom’s spark;
The dull man’s measure falls too dark.
Missed chances—talent fades, name falls, white-haired, no gain;
Great folly—plans awry, shame’s blush brings no relief’s chain.

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Hearing Sorrow, Yet Unmoved – Middling**

One leans on the western tower,
Autumn deep, the flute’s notes sour.
Only gaze, need not grieve,
No need for sorrow to weave.

Sorrow stirs at the flute’s mournful sound;
Worries rise at the wild geese’s cry unbound.
Release the sorrow—grief turns to cheer;
Calm the heart—fears dissolve, joy draws near.

**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Hearing Joy, Yet Unmoved – Middling**

A lone goose bears empty news,
False tidings, no voice ensues.
Laughing words of joy and woe,
All in vain, mere hearsay’s show.

What is heard—false joy’s report, whence can joy arise?
What is seen—empty flowers, no substance lies.
Vain boasts of praise—no deeds to show;
Empty regrets—resentment’s sting will grow.

**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Fortune Comes, Disasters Fade – Most Auspicious**

Virtue aids the good affinity,
Heaven’s decree descends in splendor’s canopy.
Many woes and trials’ weight,
Swept away, no faults remain of late.

Three disasters, eight hardships—self-made woes bring no reprieve;
Four pillars, five phases—knowing fate’s bounds, none may deceive.
Harm dispelled, blessings arrive like sun melting ice;
Faults scattered, fortune blooms like leaves in storm’s device.

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Awaiting Time’s Blessing – Middling**

Jade lies hidden in Kunlun’s height,
Its radiance chills the Dipper’s light.
If met by a master’s discerning hand,
Its treasure passed through the land.

Virtue hidden like jade in stone’s embrace;
Fate’s favor like an immortal freed from mortal’s case.
Virtue and benevolence—man’s true treasure, sage or wise;
Gold, jade, pearls—worldly wealth, rich or noble’s prize.

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – First Union, Then Parting – Most Inauspicious**

Ash cools in the brazier’s cold,
The goblet drained, joy grows old.
Many words of laughter shared,
All now like a dream’s snare.

The brazier’s embers fade to gray;
The cup stands empty, mirth decayed.
So many words of joy once spoken,
All now as if in dreams awoken.

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Matters Often Entangled – Most Inauspicious**

Incense fades, smoke vanishes—pleasure’s end now plain;
Feast disperses, goblet empty—joy gives way to pain.
Mated birds part with sorrow’s sting,
Mirror’s halves now separate—broken lute’s last ring.
No second chance to mend the string,
The immortal’s melody lost, vanishing.

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Matters Often Entangled – Most Inauspicious**

Entangled, ever entangled—endless as the eye can see,
The clear river stretches vast, its waves in ceaseless spree.
A lone boat fails to turn its prow,
Yearning for word, vexation grows now.

Hurried, harried—before one’s eyes, threads in tangled disarray;
Anxious, restless—within the heart, flames of torment burn away.
The river vast, yet no returning boat in sight—gaze strains, the soul decays;
Affairs snarled, hopes unmet—doubt gnaws, the heart in twain.

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Guard Against Careless Speech – Middling**

Laughter sows thorns where words mislead,
A slip of tongue brings grief indeed.
Had not a true friend’s wisdom shown,
Nearly ensnared by sorrow’s thorn.

To breach taboos is steel unsheathed at lip’s sharp edge—seal your mouth tight;
To stir dispute is brambles sprouting from the tongue—curl it in silent might.
Speak but once, thrice ponder well;
Act but once, weigh all with care to tell.

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Be Cautious, Do Not Entrust – Middling**

Deeds and bearing, upright and true,
Conduct and concealment—judge each move anew.
To trust another with your affair,
Lest later it twist to foul despair.

In all you do, shun the crooked, cleave to the noble—pure as orchid’s scent;
In every step, hold fast to rectitude, cast off arrogance—steadfast as pine’s ascent.
Attend to matters yourself, trust none unwise;
Guard your person, eschew reckless guise.

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Timely Joy – Most Auspicious**

Fragrance fills the eye, a blooming sight,
The immortal’s garden, wondrous in its light.
Seizing fortune’s festive tide,
Laughter and mirth in golden cups abide.

A thousand blooms, ten thousand buds—when spring arrives, they rise in splendor;
Talent and skill—when time aligns, their path grows tender.
Roots of spirit, touched by spring’s breath, sprout anew;
The noble, meeting fate’s hour, shines through.

**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Resolve Doubts, Retreat from Worry – Middling**

Advance and retreat—now is the hour,
The wise perceive the depth of power.
Matters held close within the breast,
Once decided, stand unoppressed.

To know when to advance or yield—this is foresight’s keen art;
To grasp gain and loss, honor and shame—no regret shall mar the heart.
Doubts of the mind, by a true friend made clear;
Hidden affairs, by a noble’s aid brought near.

**First Oracle of the Hour of Si – Resentment Dissolves into Grace – Middling**

Thought upon thought, in reflection’s embrace,
Meeting once more, now in a changed place.
Once steeped in enmity’s chill,
Now transformed to joy’s sweet thrill.

To dissolve resentment with grace is lotus blooming in fire’s core;
To bind enmity with grudge is snow piled on ice’s floor.
Grace must not be withheld—deep grace melts resentment’s frost;
Enmity must not run deep—once eased, grudges are lost.

**Second Oracle of the Hour of Si – Desires Fulfilled in Time – Middling**

A thousand leagues of mountains bar the way,
The heart’s flight falters, lost in disarray.
Yet suddenly, the boat and oars align,
No need for sorrow—fortune now is thine.

Wind swift, boat ready—what are leagues so far?
Affairs flow smooth, a hundred blessings are.
Desires fulfilled, vexation fades away;
Aspirations met, stagnation gives way.

**Third Oracle of the Hour of Si – Awaiting Time’s Fulfillment – Middling**

A crescent moon, its light so slight,
Clouds drift past the courtyard’s night.
Though not yet wholly bright,
Reunion’s time shall come aright.

All things transform in their due season,
A lifetime’s rise and fall—what cause, what reason?
The precious moon waxes and wanes, yet at its height shines full and clear;
Mortals, meeting time and tide, ascend to fortune’s sphere.

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Awakening to the Dao, Attaining Truth – Most Auspicious**

The Great Elixir’s hidden script,
Jade texts descend from heaven’s crypt.
Secret words bestowed this day,
Mortal frame now slips away.

The Great Elixir’s canon—mysteries profound,
Qi and spirit, form and essence—guardians bound.
Awakened to the Dao, the unspoken truth takes flight—feathers rise, immortal sound;
Grasping its principle, the subtle threads align—bone and flesh transform, reborn anew.

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Si – First Sorrow, Then Joy – Middling**

A barren field, long parched with drought,
The farmer’s heart with sorrow fraught.
Then heaven’s mercy sends its rain,
Good shoots revive, famine’s bane.

The scholar’s heart, fixed on fame and gain, toils through hardship’s night;
The tiller’s hope, set on autumn’s yield, awaits harvest’s light.
When timely rains descend, the withered stalks revive;
When human affairs align, renown and rank revive.

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Si – All Entangled in Stagnation – Most Inauspicious**

Clouds obscure, the moon sinks low,
A lonely traveler in an empty court below.
A thousand thoughts within the heart’s small space,
Who understands the sorrow’s trace?

Peril and dread, prolonged in stagnant air,
Clouds veil the moon—its light is not there.
Wind stirs the waves—no peace upon the tide;
One matter unsolved—vexation’s sighs abide.

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Si – Sudden Joy – Most Auspicious**

A lofty terrace, perilous and high,
Joyful the gaze to cloud and sky.
From beyond the heavens, a pair of cranes appear,
Flying near to grant a treasure dear.

Freed from gloom, as if from illness’ weight;
Heart’s delight, as spring’s first sunlit gate.
Cranes cry out, soaring on wings unbound;
Man, unshackled, finds peace profound.

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Success Without Striving – Most Auspicious**

Sweet rains fall on barren ground,
Sacred shoots in splendor crowned.
Autumn’s harvest waits its time,
Safe through seasons, fortune’s climb.

Fields of ten thousand acres—sweet rains make the grain thrive;
One body, one life—when creation favors, rank and name arrive.
One deed accomplished, one aim achieved—high virtue rejoices;
One plan well-laid, one path upright—all hearts approve its choices.

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Toil of Mind, Clumsiness in Affairs – Most Inauspicious**

Cloud beyond cloud, veiling the sky,
Heaven’s decree remains unheard on high.
Though the heart be earnest, true,
No glad tidings reach you.

Dense clouds, yet no rain—vain the upward gaze;
Unissued edicts—sighs in vain ablaze.
Zeal and diligence turn to sloth, work undone;
Hopes entwined, yet no word comes—affairs go wrong, undone.

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Wishes Aligned with the Heart – Most Auspicious**

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Si – Aid Without Obstruction – Most Auspicious**

Long seated, awaiting the fair moon,
Clouds part—treasure orb rounds full and bright.
Raise the cup, share in pure delight,
Ten thousand cares cast aside as one.

Clouds disperse, skies clear—treasure moon reveals a cosmos serene;
Disasters retreat, illness fades—auspicious fortune descends, plans align.
Uncork the wine, feast the heart in joyous accord,
Purge all thoughts—affairs prosper, the mind rests in peace.

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Discordant Hearts, Reversed Affairs – Most Inauspicious**

Ice and coal share no hearth,
Their natures clash, their hearts apart.
Best to reflect with care,
Lest your heart’s affairs be laid bare.

Water and fire cannot dwell as one—for their natures stand opposed,
Wise and foolish cannot share a home—for their wisdom is not aligned.
Differing natures breed discord in hearts,
Righteous and crooked schemes cannot coincide.

**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Noble Ones Offer Guidance – Most Auspicious**

Heaven’s blessing bears the writ,
Joy abounds—all wishes fit.
Crimson-robed ones draw near,
Power and favor lend support clear.

The writ bears qi—heaven’s bounty rides the rushing clouds,
Plans meet no doubt—crimson robes guide with wind’s aid.
Those who hold sway greet you with gladness, ranks and titles ascend,
Those at the crossroads steady your rise, fame and fortune extend.

**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Minor Harm, No Injury – Neutral**

A ghost laughs in the dark,
Unseen, it watches, lurks apart.
Though no grave harm befalls,
Still, small misfortunes may impart.

Men have their ghostly foes,
Things their spectral woes.
Those who breed envy and spite are called ghost-men,
Those who stir strife and omens are called ghost-things.
To banish ghost-things, heaven’s just law is easily wielded,
To ward off ghost-men, no fine art exists—restraint is seldom heeded.

**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Yield and Remain Unharmed – Neutral**

When wealth and gain near fruition,
Human hearts breed contention.
Yield, and harmony shall reign,
Preserving peace, sparing pain.

Father and son, brother and brother—discord often springs from gain,
Comrades and friends—strife arises from rivalry and claim.
Those who grasp for more grow ever unsatisfied, virtue and kindness fade,
Those who yield find ease, their names shine bright, their reputations made.

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Gradual Reach of Limits – Neutral**

Light begins to gleam,
Worries fade like a dream.
Each step forward, though small,
Brings you closer to the hall.

Dusk retreats, the scene grows bright,
Anxieties dissolve—calm takes flight.
A single step may span a thousand li—what need for fear?
One plan secured ensures a hundred blessings—what cause for doubt is here?

**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Reverence Invokes Blessing – Most Auspicious**

Cinnabar furnace, sacred script aflame,
Prayers ascend to the honored name.
Fortune’s pure thread aids your quest,
Heart devoted—the Dao remains possessed.

Those who serve the true gain its power, trials dissolve unseen,
Those who honor the Buddha gain his mercy, disasters fade serene.
Burning sacred script in the cinnabar furnace, prayers rise in silent devotion,
Bestowing distant blessings—grace shines bright in tranquil response.

**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Yin’s Petty Disturbance – Most Inauspicious**

Ghosts obscure, clinging tight,
Household yin stirs minor blight.
Turn your heart to good deeds done,
Peace restored—troubles undone.

Household peril stems from ill-fated years and misfortune’s weight,
Ghostly intrusions thrive where wills stray and hearts deviate.
Right your heart, act with rectitude—yin’s pettiness will cease,
Steady your resolve, forsake all wrong—disasters fade, bring peace.

**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Wishes Yet Unfulfilled – Most Inauspicious**

A boat on dry land—how to sail?
The heart’s return finds no avail.
Vainly the traveler lingers, veiled in mist,
Restless, adrift—his spirit dismissed.

A boat on parched earth cannot cross nor glide,
Schemes built on emptiness cannot thrive nor abide.
The heart’s return unmet—vain longing, sorrow’s tide,
Sincerity incomplete—joy scarce, hope denied.

**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Dispelling Stagnation, Revealing the Hidden – Most Auspicious**

Treasure sword pierces the vaulted sky,
Malevolent shades and lurking sprites fly.
No obstruction remains,
Virtue’s might spreads its name.

The treasure sword is the true and noble one—shooting the Dipper, charging the Ox,
Ghosts and specters are the yin and the crooked—hiding in shadows, lost.
Decrees issued, virtue’s might dispels the perverse,
Efforts made, the hidden rise—grace and fortune reverse.

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Si – Disasters Retreat, Fortune Arises – Most Auspicious**

Heaven’s music sounds in pure refrain,
Immortal chariots descend to the domain.
Gates and halls blaze with radiant light,
All within receive blessings bright.

Celestial strains resound—affairs harmonize, trust and joy align,
Immortal chariots alight—each move brings fortune, each sign benign.
Floating misfortunes, fleeting woes—driven beyond the clouds’ embrace,
Flying emoluments, blessings bright—spring’s bounty fills the household space.

**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Si – Old Matters Renewed – Most Auspicious**

Old affairs revive anew,
Retreat turns to bold pursue.
Once a guest in shadows deep,
Now a cloud-borne traveler’s leap.

Retreat shifts to advance—know the hour’s change,
Affairs reborn—fate’s aid is in range.
Not losing the old felt’s hue, seclusion’s call,
Gaining the golden mirror’s glow—countenance restored, standing tall.

**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of Si – Aid Brings Joyful Success – Most Auspicious**

The heart’s return finds a vessel true,
Troubled thoughts dissolve in ease anew.
No need for lingering despair,
Old friends gather, all is fair.

The heart’s longing meets a vessel’s timely tide,
Anxious thoughts transform to leisure’s glide.
Stagnation shed, the open road—spring’s joy fills hill and stream,
Noble aid advances—success shines, the village gleams.

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Best to Remain Still – Neutral**

Hold fast, do not stir,
Movement brings error’s blur.
Moon cold, the courtyard still,
Wind stirs the water’s thrill.

If one schemes and acts, fortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise,
If the heart seeks recklessly, blessings fade before one’s eyes.

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Strife and Entanglement – Most Inauspicious**

Disaster and fortune stand poised to arrive,
Stillness holds—moonlight bathes the courtyard in serene light,
Movement seeks—wind churns waves into surging might.

The moon sets, the mountains stand empty,
All tranquil affairs now fade away.
A heart’s inch spans a thousand miles,
All entangled in strife’s sway.

When one’s affairs are right yet turn to wrong,
When time’s favor shifts from smooth to blocked,
Plans grow sparse, schemes grow dull—
A heart’s inch spans a thousand miles,
Trust fades, echoes sink beyond the moon’s fall in hollow hills.

---

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Qi Brings Completion – Neutral**

Cold ashes stir anew,
No need to speak of change’s flow.
If human aid appears,
Near and far, fate’s thread will show.

Fallen stars, cold ashes—suddenly life rekindles bright,
Withered wood, barren branches—green returns in verdant light.
Wait for the hour, advance—success lies close at hand,
With aid received, the cause takes form, the work is firmly planned.

---

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Si – Celebration and Flourishing – Most Auspicious**

Joy finds voice in fresh verse,
Unfettered, the Dao aids the people’s course.
Wind and cloud in glad reunion,
Only thus is peace secure.

Success brings delight—this is "joy’s voice,"
Unobstructed heart—this is "unfettered course."
Cloud-dragon, wind-tiger coil within the golden crucible,
Transcendent communion graces the immortal isle’s hall.

---

Jackals and wolves trapped in rocky ravines,
Travelers’ worries now fade away.
The road ahead lies smooth as a palm,
Companions follow, hearts in accord.

Plans at last flow free, all cares dissolve in an instant’s tide.
The road ahead stretches level, the journey unfolds with ease,
Success achieved, collective will harmonizes—glory and profit increase.

---

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Escaping Disaster – Most Auspicious**

Yin’s shadows shed their heavy peril,
The household slowly regains its glow.
Countless trials and sorrows,
Swept away like dust in the wind’s flow.

Personal misfortunes scatter like leaves before the wind’s run.
Ruined halls rise anew, restored with care,
Felled trees stand tall again, nurtured with repair.

---

**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Si – Dual Blessings of Fortune – Most Auspicious**

Phoenixes dance in soaring flight,
Fragrant winds descend with auspicious light.
A grand feast of joy unfolds,
All gather in fortune’s radiant height.

Peace without calamity—this is "fortune,"
Virtue’s flourishing rise—this is "blessing."
Phoenixes soaring herald heaven’s grace,
Good thoughts growing bring rank and longevity’s embrace.
Those who accumulate goodness beget lasting reward,
Those who cultivate virtue secure distant blessing’s accord.

---

**First Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Hesitation Blocks Progress – Most Inauspicious**

Intent on wandering the immortal realm,
The three mountains’ path remains distant, dim.
Unable to ascend a single step,
Only regret lingers before the slanting sun.

The isles of Penglai—heard of but never seen,
Distant schemes—envisioned but never achieved.
Aspirations swift, yet progress slow,
Gains elusive, losses come with ease.

---

**Second Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Joyful Aid Brings Success – Most Auspicious**

Traversed countless mountains’ height,
Now at last finds rest and peace.
Meeting one who points the way,
The deer is found, the return brings release.

Retreating from disaster, advancing fortune—at last finds rest.
With guidance received, the merit is complete,
The deer secured, the return brings joy replete.

---

**Third Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Joy Veiled by Sorrow – Most Inauspicious**

Dark clouds gather thick,
Clear skies suddenly turn bleak.
The heavens’ stars grow dim,
No moonlight’s glow to seek.

Peace and calm may yet bring stumbling woe,
Laughter and joy may hide a furrowed brow’s shadow.
Dark clouds rise—day turns to gloom,
Stars and moon hide their light—all is shrouded in doom.

---

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Heaven’s Blessing Bestowed – Most Auspicious**

Withered and lifeless, devoid of qi,
Yang’s warmth transforms all to spring.
The Eastern Lord exerts his power,
Bestowing grace in equal measure.

Withered trees cannot sprout without the Eastern Lord’s might,
Rank and emolument cannot form without a noble’s light.
Fields and crops thrive by rain and dew’s embrace,
Grass and trees flourish by yang’s warming grace.

---

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Transcending the Mundane – Most Auspicious**

The path to blue clouds stretches far,
Immortal rolls bear one’s name inscribed.
The elixir of long life is found,
Divine sprouts emerge from cinnabar refined.

Dao perfected, virtue complete—names etched in immortal scrolls,
Merit fulfilled, deeds done—seated among celestial roles.
Attaining the wondrous secret of long life, youth is restored,
Receiving the profound mystery of the alchemical hearth, dragons are tamed, tigers ignored.

---

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Joy and Sorrow Unresolved – Neutral**

Chaos like primordial darkness,
Joy and sorrow yet unclear.
Only when heaven and earth part,
Will cock’s crow and dog’s bark appear.

In chaos’ murky haze, distinctions blur,
Between joy and sorrow, advance and retreat—order unsure.
Wait until heaven clears and earth brightens—then all cares dissolve,
Only then will cock’s crow and dog’s bark reveal right and wrong’s resolve.

---

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Stillness Awaits Auspicious Signs – Neutral**

The great Dao seeks clarity and stillness,
Hold fast, do not seek in vain.
Let others clamor in empty noise,
Focus the mind on cultivation’s plane.

Those who guard the Dao seek a heart at peace, a spirit serene,
Those drawn to fleeting splendor chase reckless thoughts, their minds untamed.
Heaven grants longevity—await it through steadfast cultivation,
Fortune and misfortune—hold to integrity’s foundation.

---

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Dispel Worries, Retreat from Affairs – Neutral**

Retreat from affairs, do not pursue,
Still the heart, let it rest.
Vain rumors spread countless schemes,
Strife cannot advance the quest.

Worries are like bubbles on water—fleeting, unsustainable,
Joy is like shadows in air—elusive, unattainable.
All schemes and efforts weary mind and will in vain,
Dispel joy, dispel sorrow—only then avoid calamity’s stain.

---

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Emptiness and Unreality – Most Inauspicious**

A spring stream flows,
Petals fall upon the fragrant isle.
An empty dream of spring’s bloom,
All affairs remain incomplete.

Elm coins cannot relieve want,
Painted cakes cannot sate hunger’s cry.

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Awaiting the Hour with Hope – Neutral-Low**

Rumors cannot be trusted as truth,
Names cannot be heard as fact.
Falling blossoms pass before the eye—soon swept away,
A spring dream lingers in startled hesitation—nothing to savor.

The treasure tripod still lies buried,
Talent high yet unfulfilled.
One day when dragon and tiger meet,
Office and rank shall both ascend.

Unresolved affairs are like gold and jade sunk in mud,
Unmet times render talent and wit futile.
Dragon and tiger coil in mutual dance, shifting wind and cloud,
When fortune’s hour aligns, prosperity and rank swiftly rise.

---

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Illness Retreats, Disease Vanishes – Most Auspicious**

Gripped by illness, not yet healed,
A skilled physician stands before you.
No need for long lament—
Soon, safety shall be restored.

Illness in the vital organs, met by a good doctor, revives the dying,
A deluded heart, touched by true healing, awakens in sudden clarity.
If misfortune retreats, sickness vanishes in an instant,
If fate turns favorable, fortune arrives as naturally as breath.

---

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Wu – Success in Sight – Most Auspicious**

A deer stands before the mountain,
Fresh blossoms dazzle the eye.
Though minor perils have been endured,
Great joy may now unfold the furrowed brow.

The deer-hunter traverses rugged and treacherous paths,
The flower-lover endures frost and snow.
Though first faced with utmost hardship and trial,

The parched fish finds water,
The ailing tiger returns to the mountain forest.
Gradually, life stirs,
Leisurely, joy fills the heart.

For those who endure hardship, prosperity awaits.

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Hardship Followed by Success – Most Auspicious**

A hundred battles bring many perils,
Yet triumphant, one returns in joy.
Broidered robes grace the homeward journey,
Merit and achievement rise ever higher.

The inauspicious weapon Confucius called "fine warfare";
The decisive strategy Sunzi deemed "masterful planning."
Merit achieved, honors won—first through a hundred battles’ peril;
Returning in broidered robes, next comes the reward of enfeoffment.

---

Nine-times-refined elixir,
Immortals of the Three Mountains, jade-handed.
All descend in this moment,
Disaster scatters, fortune unfurls.

The mysterious and true descend, blessing the household with fortune;
The noble extend their aid, raising one to rank and emolument.

---

**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Restraint and Timing – Average**

Strike the rat, yet guard the vessel;
Confront the wicked, yet avoid the true.
Do not rush in anger,
Relying on force will not bring renown.

A rat near jade—strike it, and the treasure is damaged;
Words that provoke the wicked—touch them, and the self is harmed.
To endure and restrain anger is to let matters dissolve;
To await the right moment is to let affairs succeed.

---

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Great Achievement, Minor Fortune – Most Auspicious**

Chu jade meets a discerning eye,
True gold is smelted and refined.
Already a great vessel is formed,
Small quarrels cannot hinder it.

Yellow gold and white jade, through refining, become treasures;
The worthy and the noble, through learning, achieve renown.
A sound plan comes to fruition—great vessels take time to complete;
Fine deeds are cultivated—how can petty grievances intrude?

---

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Gratitude and Emolument – Most Auspicious**

A modest emolument lingers,
Yet the Eastern Lord’s favor follows.
Offer incense and faith,
To reach the heavens above.

To linger is to waver between advance and retreat;
The Eastern Lord has already shown favor.
With integrity and prudence, emolument endures and office rises;
With reverence in ritual, spirits lend aid, and the true assist.

---

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Words That Seal Success – Most Auspicious**

Illuminate the gall, observe the heart’s affairs,
All becomes clear and known.
Should you speak but one word,
Two will follow in accord.

Loyalty and righteous gall—heaven sees, spirits know;
Deceit and wicked schemes—ghosts bring misfortune, spirits turn away.
With a heart sincere and free of deceit,
A single fitting word brings compliance and accord.

---

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Urgency and Delay – Average**

This hope is like thirst,
That intent like treading an abyss.
Suddenly, wind and rain clear,
A swift chariot ascends the blue heavens.

In great drought, one longs for rain, yet no sweet mist falls;
In haste, one strays from the path, stumbling at every turn.
This heart is urgent as a drum awaiting the mallet;
That intent is slow as dusk settling into stillness.

---

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Deliverance from Peril – Most Auspicious**

A storm rises in the evening,
The boatman’s hope seems lost.
Yet another’s strength and virtue aid,
The Dao is restored, all prospers.

Aboard a boat on the water, a violent wind stirs waves to the heavens;
In life and conduct, recklessness brings ruin to merit and name.
Deliverance from peril comes by the aid of the true and divine;
Peace and prosperity stem from the cultivation of virtue and the Dao.

---

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Anxiety Gradually Eases – Average**

Intentions breed worry,
Without cause, one lingers in stagnation.
Yet if the will is steadied,
What matter cannot be resolved?

Worry and doubt arise from entanglement, a thousand concerns take shape;
Obscurity and delay stem from procrastination, a hundred sorrows arise.
Calm the intent, and suspicions gradually dissolve;
Compose the heart, and regrets slowly fade.

---

**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Hopes Turn and Twist – Average**

A single will clings stubbornly,
The reckless heart knows not its folly.
Waiting for another’s plan to take shape,
Time passes in reversal and change.

A stubborn will seeks certain success;
A presumptuous heart meets empty loss.
Waiting for another brings vain hopes, hesitation and delay;
Time passes, yet no firm resolve emerges, shifting without end.

---

**Thirty-First Oracle of the Hour of Shen – Fulfillment Through Sincerity – Most Auspicious**

A wild goose’s message seeks to reach,
Sincerity benefits before and after.
A single word from the superior,
Brings perfect fulfillment to fine affairs.

The goose’s foot, the fish’s belly—messages traverse a thousand miles;
Good words and sincerity aid perfect success.
A distant message, true and unfeigned, carries no deceit;
Approaching the superior, all receive true favor, blessings shine with grace.

**First Oracle of the Hour of You – Guard the Self, Do Not Indulge – Moderate**

A Daoist friend stands at the double pass,
A thousand mountains, ten thousand mountains lie ahead.
Guard the heart, and affairs are guarded;
In joy and laughter, do not cling or chase.

Seeking friends and companions requires no toil of crossing waters or climbing peaks;
Cultivating nature and refining the true begins with cutting off greed and severing desire.
The heart should ever be guarded—guarded, then no loss, no sorrow;
The mind should cast off excess—excess cast off, then neither obstinate nor overbearing.

---

**Second Oracle of the Hour of You – A Path to Advance – Moderate**

A trail is not blocked,
No gate cannot be closed.
Not acting recklessly for others,
Yet affairs must still be tended with care.

A winding path, unless it twists and turns, cannot be traversed;
A roundabout pursuit, without circling and maneuvering, cannot be achieved.
Affairs may take two or three attempts before success—do not shrink from the trouble;
The mind advances and retreats with due consideration—this is no reckless act.

---

**Third Oracle of the Hour of You – Defying Reason Brings Regret – Most Inauspicious**

Managing wealth and affairs lags,
Ghosts and thieves see their chance.
Do not share matters of one heart,
Beware of words that twist right and wrong.

Managing wealth and affairs—wealth brings no profit, affairs no success;
Handling lawsuits and marriages—lawsuits suffer loss, marriages break.
Moreover, ghosts and thieves press with hidden schemes;
Beware of words turning to deceit, becoming crooked wrongs.

---

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of You – Beware of Petty Men – Most Inauspicious**

His intent harbors harm,
This heart remains unaware.
Beware still at the feast,
Lest outside affairs entangle you.

He nurses harm toward me—his words are gentle, his face respectful;
I remain heedless—my actions unguarded, my seat unobservant.
Beware of joy in cups turning to enmity,
Guard against presumption, fearing entanglements.

---

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of You – Losing Control Brings Misfortune – Most Inauspicious**

Jade and stone cannot be smelted,
Cinnabar cannot be sunk.
If not used where they belong,
Even treasures lose their true worth.

Jade and stone, most fine, cannot endure fire or boiling water;
The heart, though most clear, cannot be without caution or care.
Losing control, the swift steed bolts—near or far, hard to retrieve;
Indulging recklessness, the lost stray—stumbling, perilous to return.

---

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of You – Abandon Gain, Avoid Harm – Moderate**

Old matters should not be raised,
Raising them brings entanglement.
Cast them aside for now,
And your descendants will inherit the family legacy.

Past affairs must not be revived—reviving them brings harm upon oneself;
The honey on a blade’s edge must not be tasted—tasting it surely wounds the tongue.
Abandon small gains, and great affairs will surely succeed;
Profit the subordinates, and the superior’s favor will surely follow.

---

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of You – Stillness Guards the Heart – Moderate**

Beyond the heavens, the moon’s brilliance is clear,
Amid the clouds, a crow cries.
In stillness, not a single affair stirs,
Do not let private desires arise.

Still the heart—the six thieves do not stir, the five aggregates are empty;
Guard the heart—a hundred demons vanish of themselves, the three poisons fade.
Though wolves and tigers are fierce beasts, they too can be captured and subdued;
Good and evil arise from the heart—it is there they must be mastered.

---

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of You – Light Trust, Few Promises – Most Inauspicious**

A thousand past promises,
Labor in vain through endless turns.
Though smiling assent is given before your face,
The heart harbors many other schemes.

Matters entreated and sought may be most earnest and diligent,
Yet words promised and pledged are often false and deceitful.
Humble words and lavish gifts waste only spirit and strength;
Flattering smiles and meandering talk are but their cunning disguises.

---

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of You – First Toil, First Success – Moderate**

Two are of one matter,
Yet both hearts push and vie.
Rat and Ox press urgently,
Tiger and Hare meet with joy.

Two of one heart—righteousness may divide gold;
Two of differing minds—affairs find no cooperation.
Rat and Ox in use bring toiling labor of the heart;
Tiger and Hare in harmony bear the glad countenance of joy.

---

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of You – First Examine, Then Act – Moderate**

Each step guards against danger,
Boarding a boat, prepare for wind.
How can one rush to decide?
No need to ask of success or failure.

Matters great or small should be pondered thrice before acting;
Movement, whether auspicious or ill, must be carefully weighed before use.
Hastening on foot, one still guards against stumbling peril;
Seeking profit or fame—how can one rush to judgment?

---

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of You – Doubtful Matters, Do Not Act – Moderate**

The obscure cannot be known,
Seeking fame, knock at the sage’s gate.
One should weigh and discern,
Doubtful matters need not be pursued.

Obscurity is the sign of the unknowable—none can fathom it;
Doubt is the beginning of confusion—spirits cannot clarify it.
Weigh and abandon—do not act, for acting brings discord;
Wait for the time, and it will naturally open—opening, it may endure.

---

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of You – Resentment Dissolves, Grudges Release – Moderate**

Long-held suspicions,
Now resentment fades, grievances cease.
No need for excessive caution,
Meet with courtesy and harmony.

Small grudges unremoved breed great resentment;
Small resentments unresolved lead to great strife.
Suspicious thoughts cannot be eased without self-release;
Contentious beginnings cannot be reconciled without forbearance.

---

**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Encountering Affairs, Seek Favor – Moderate**

In a secluded chamber, sorrow lingers,
Life on water—a fleeting bubble.
Meeting spring, one must seize the chance,
Do not stubbornly delay.

Life in the world is like a bubble on water;
Plans unfulfilled are like confinement in a dim room.
Meeting the spring of opportunity, one may yet unfold long-stifled aspirations;
Fortunate to find a favorable turn, do not insist on lingering.

---

**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Haste Desires Slow Progress – Moderate**

Heard but not seen,
Whether met or not remains unknown.
Desiring advance, yet unable to move,
Leave it to the will of others.

Rumors from a thousand miles are often false, rarely true;
Whether one meets or not at this moment is hard to trust, hard to know.
Affairs may yet be achieved, but not yet achieved;
The heart may desire speed, but speed is not yet attainable.

---

**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Promotion and Emolument May Rise – Most Auspicious**

Heaven and Earth bestow vast favor,
Human and spirit alike revere and admire.
Radiance gathers where virtue dwells,
Look up—blessings arrive.

Heaven and Earth’s grace is abundant—assisting the virtuous, aiding the powerful;
Human and spirit revere—unashamed above, unabashed below.
Emolument and rank advance, celebrating layer upon layer of joy;
Official ranks shift and turn, bowing in admiration to wave upon wave of glory.

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Advance When the Moment is Right – Neutral**

A herd of deer in the mountain forest,
Immortal blossoms fill the path in spring.
Now is the time to step forward,
Do not linger with an empty cup.

Deer dwell in the mountains, their nature pure and untamed;
In the mundane world, men’s hearts are bound by endless desires.
Facing the radiant bloom of immortal flowers, advance without delay;
Amidst the harmony of a splendid scene, do not idle with an empty cup.

---

**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Emerging from Obscurity to Usefulness – Most Auspicious**

The immortal cassia sprouts new branches,
The toad in the moon shines with full radiance.
Raise the golden hand to extend mine,
In laughter and speech, I gain the coiled dragon.

Having grasped the immortal cassia, I repay the toil of threefold study;
Stepping into the lunar palace, I fulfill a decade’s aspiration.
Unfurling the great hand of clouds, I stand out from the crowd;
Obtaining the true pearl from the dragon’s chin, my person is honored and my name esteemed.

---

**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Heaven’s Nobility Bestows Favor – Most Auspicious**

Earth and wood don the crimson robe,
Upon meeting, minds follow freely.
Do not hesitate to speak a word,
To aid the ascent up the cloud ladder.

The closest are parents and brothers,
The relied-upon are noble and virtuous men.
Without parents, the body cannot be born;
Without the noble, emolument cannot be secured.
The noble assist in accord with the Dao, enabling ascent up the cloud ladder;
The virtuous lend support, bringing about a fine reputation.

---

**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – First Advance, Then Success – Neutral**

One matter is judged right or wrong,
Three hearts hold differing intentions.
Do not be the first to yield,
For victory and defeat lie within.

A single affair may be deemed right or wrong;
Three minds may diverge, some in accord, some at odds.
One must act swiftly first, lest the moment pass;
Do not let others precede you, lest regret follow.

---

**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of You – Caution in Strategy and Action – Neutral**

Each harbors intentions hard to know,
In deep strategy, careful use is most fitting.
Do not let it leak lightly,
Lest what was right become wrong.

If matters of strategy are not kept secret, they harm the self;
If plans are not cautious, they bring trouble upon oneself.
Though united in purpose, each harbors private intentions, hard to measure;
Differing views create barriers, leaving feelings unexpressed and ununderstood.

---

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of You – Choose the Moment, Guard Against Loss – Neutral**

The southeast path may be taken,
The northwest may bring misfortune.
Act when the moment is favorable,
And ensure your own peace and preservation.

The southeast, in spring and summer, is a flourishing direction, bringing allies;
The northwest, in autumn and winter, is a stern and declining quarter, losing them.
Assess the matter—if it can be done, proceed;
Examine the plan—if it should be used, employ it.

---

**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of You – Determination Brings Success – Most Auspicious**

To seek the treasure of the deep abyss,
Seek the pearl beneath the dragon’s chin.
What is destined to be accomplished,
Requires no hesitation.

The treasure of the deep abyss is obtained through wisdom and must be gained;
The pearl beneath the dragon’s chin is won through bold pursuit and can be secured.
With a steadfast heart, one may become a Buddha or an ancestor—what difficulty lies in enlightenment?
With hesitation, one fails the Dao and loses truth—what use is regret?

---

**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of You – Broken Trust, Silence – Most Inauspicious**

Vastly distant, beyond the horizon,
The setting sun, the cawing of crows at dusk.
In the emptiness, all messages cease,
Sitting in silence, one can only sigh.

The path to the horizon stretches, not even a wild goose to carry a letter;
In the secluded courtyard at dusk, only the cawing of crows is heard.
The matter sought is like grasping at shadows in the air—how can it be seized?
The hope cherished is like searching for a needle in the sea—how can it be found?

---

**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of You – First Sorrow, Then Joy – Most Auspicious**

The crescent moon becomes full once more,
The clouds part to reveal the sky again.
The drunken heart awakens anew,
What was broken is now made firm.

The clouds disperse, the sky clears, and the moon, once incomplete, is whole again;
Sorrow scatters, joy arrives—what was apart is now united.
The drunken dream fades, the spirit is clear, dwelling in serenity;
Evil retreats, the Dao’s qi remains, harmonious and carefree.

---

**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of You – Stability and Longevity – Most Auspicious**

Old grudges have dissolved,
New kindness comes in turn.
How will it be in time?
The green pine endures frost and snow.

Having bestowed kindness, old grudges fade, misfortune departs;
Having rendered service, new favor is received, bringing blessings and fortune.
The green pine and bamboo defy frost and snow, enduring the cold of years;
Firmness and preservation nurture body and spirit, increasing emolument and lifespan.

---

**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of You – Blessing and Virtue Both Assist – Most Auspicious**

Colorful clouds fly beyond the heavens,
Immortal music follows in a single thread.
Auspiciousness and joy abound,
Extending fortune and increasing felicity.

Those with blessing must also possess virtue, and their blessing grows ever greater;
Those who accumulate goodness must also accumulate merit, and their goodness deepens.
Joy and auspiciousness gather, the immortal music of *Xiao Shao* ever present;
Fortune and felicity converge, the radiance of propitious clouds ever covering.

---

**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of You – Household Spirits Unsettled – Most Inauspicious**

Incense and fire grow sparse,
Ghosts and thieves peer at the household gate.
One must cultivate purity and cleanliness,
Only then may one dwell in peace.

When incense and fire are devoted and true, the spirits offer protection;
When the household is in turmoil, ghosts falter and thieves plot.
Rectify the self and purify the body to cleanse past transgressions;
Acknowledge faults and dispel calamity to attain peace and safety.

---

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of You – Sorrow Turns to Joy – Most Auspicious**

The weak regain strength,
Calamity transforms into good fortune.
Petty men’s schemes come to naught,
Great virtue shines forth.

Serious illness gradually fades, restoring health;
Fleeting misfortune dissipates, bringing joy once more.
Dark schemes retreat like melting snow, leaving no trace;
Brightness shines anew, like the sun’s universal reflection.

---

**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of You – Treading on Frost and Ice – Neutral**

The loyal and good are already formed,
Yet slanderous words linger—why the delay?
Fortunately, a noble person sees,
And idle slander turns to dust.

Even the loyal and good are not free from slander;
Even the wise and virtuous may suffer from insinuation.
To silence slander, nothing surpasses self-cultivation;
To correct wrongdoing, one must reflect and reform.

---

**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of You – Long Misled, Now Awakened – Neutral**

Climbing a tree to seek fish,
Labor in vain, the aspiration empty.
Clearly, the path lies at the mountain’s foot,
A mere few inches ahead.

Seeking fish by climbing a tree is futile toil;
The road ahead is plainly at the mountain’s base, just a short distance away.

**First Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Wasted Effort – Most Inauspicious**

Desires of reckless pursuit are like seeking fish from a green tree;
Schemes beyond one’s station differ not from drilling ice for fire.
One must turn inward and reflect in silence—now awakened, while before deluded.
It is fitting to examine awakened thoughts with care—for the sober are clear, while the drunk remain muddled.

---

**Second Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Broken Tripod – Most Inauspicious**

What use is a tripod with broken legs?
All arrangements will surely meet peril.
Mocked by the chatter of inferiors,
Incapable of accomplishing a single task.

A tripod with broken legs cannot stand—once upright, it tilts and topples.
Affairs that defy principle cannot proceed—once attempted, they falter and stall.
Tilting brings danger and instability, estranging the favor of superiors;
Stalling brings frustration and unrest, inciting the clamor of subordinates.

---

**Third Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Salvation in Distress – Most Auspicious**

A withered tree at last finds use,
Though frost and snow have battered it.
One morning, touched by spring’s delight,
It suddenly bursts into fragrant bloom.

Amidst piled snow and bitter frost, leaves fall and forests wither;
In times of hardship and misfortune, the heart grows weary and the will slackens.
Fortunately, the warm breath of spring revives all things—woods flourish and trees thrive;
With the aid of a guiding hand, distress dissolves and calamity is resolved.

---

**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Borrowing Strength – Most Auspicious**

A rut blocks the cart’s path,
And the journey ahead seems delayed.
Suddenly, another lends their strength—
A single step ascends the cloud ladder.

A boulder obstructing the rut—even Meng Ben could not drag the cart forward;
A fierce tiger in the way—even Bian Zhuang would not dare advance.
Yet when others remove the stone, the wheels roll with thunderous force;
When the divine shields one’s path, even tigers pose no cause for fear.

---

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Plans Come to Naught – Most Inauspicious**

Dreams shatter, the spirit fades,
And sorrow rises in the stillness.
So many fine schemes devised,
Yet wind and rain howl on, desolate.

The spirit fades as dreams dissolve—hundreds of plans come to nothing;
Thoughts scatter, the mind wanders—not a single strategy bears fruit.
Facing the desolate night rain, sorrow stirs in solitude;
In the hush of the sighing west wind, regret deepens in silence.

---

**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Caution and Restraint – Neutral**

Danger dispelled beyond the towering peaks,
Yet jackals and wolves prowl daily.
For now, tread low and winding paths—
Do not yet unfurrow your troubled brow.

Dwelling in deep valleys and perilous mountains, every step is fraught with danger;
Living among jackals and tigers, one must remain vigilant day and night.
It is wise to be cautious and guarded—only then can peril give way to safety;
One must ever be humble and patient—thus may constant worry turn to fortune.

---

**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Stillness and Timing – Neutral**

All sounds now hushed, the world serene,
The moon’s radiance shines bright and clear.
Indulge in poetry and wine for joy—
Let all else fade from concern.

All sounds stilled, the moon’s glow illumines a pristine universe;
All worries dissolved, the spirit at rest, the body feels light.
Why not freely pursue delight in poetry and wine, roaming beyond the mundane?
Guard your true nature—what hinders singing of the joy within?

---

**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Guard Against Deceit – Most Inauspicious**

Three women demand vigilance,
Their cunning words disrupt all order.
Guard your heart, do not indulge—
Ox and horse may yet avert disaster.

The deceiver’s wiles are unfathomable, their depths unknowable;
False words confound truth—surely they are deceitful, surely they are treacherous.
Those who flatter must not be lightly trusted—trust leads to error;
Those who please must be carefully guarded—vigilance averts harm.

---

**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Accumulating Merit to Attain the Dao – Most Auspicious**

The elixir of nine refinements,
Its power perfected not in a single moment.
To seek the supreme Dao,
First devote yourself to selfless action.

Without accumulated merit, the Dao cannot be attained;
Only through repeated refinement can the elixir be achieved.
Cultivating practice over lifetimes, one’s name is inscribed in golden registers and jade tablets;
Pursuing study through the years, the body ascends to the azure clouds and purple mists.

---

**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Escaping Peril to Joy – Most Auspicious**

The worthy and enlightened are true scholars,
Like fish that slip free from the hook.
Leaping through waves a thousand feet high,
A single bait cannot hold them.

The worthy and enlightened do not fall prey to petty gains that harm the self;
How can a fish in a valley stream be ensnared by a single bait?
The golden-scaled fish escapes the hook, leaping in the mighty waves;
The noble one emerges from calamity, swiftly advancing on the path of prosperity.

---

**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Uprightness Brings Blessing – Most Auspicious**

Vast and boundless, the heavens and earth,
Majestic and revered, virtue and power.
To conduct oneself with integrity—
Fortune and favor reside within the heart.

Heaven and earth are vast—good and evil meet their just reward without partiality;
Virtue and power are lofty—uprightness and perversity are revealed through cultivation.
With a heart and thoughts aligned in rectitude, blessings naturally descend;
With a heart and thoughts steeped in perversity, good fortune naturally recedes.

---

**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Caution Against Extravagance – Neutral**

How can shallow waters stir great waves?
A meager capacity must guard against excess.
From this moment, practice restraint—
Thus may coming misfortune be worn away.

A mere puddle—how can it generate waves?
A narrow-minded person—how can their heart hold generosity?
Good fortune arises from diligence and frugality—frugality brings abundance;
Calamity stems from indulgence and extravagance—extravagance leads to ruin.

---

**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Upholding the Dao Without Force – Neutral**

How long can fleeting splendor last?
Turn back—do not let time slip idly by.
Guard your enterprise, do not neglect it;
Restrain the reckless heart, let it know no waves.

Fleeting splendor passes like a dream in the southern branch;
Grand affairs are rare—time drifts, and the years change.
Do not let the Dao’s work lapse—turn inward and reflect;
Calm the mind, beware of idleness—few worries bring no misfortune.

---

**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Discord in Affairs – Most Inauspicious**

Water and fire cannot coexist,
As the mechanisms of petty men and noble ones differ.
They cannot share joy in harmony—
Parting or staying will surely prove difficult.

Ice and charcoal cannot share a furnace—they are bound by mutual generation and restraint;
Fragrance and stench cannot ride the same carriage—they are bound by mutual contamination and defilement.
The noble one possesses a heart of compassion and mercy;
The petty man lacks foresight and lofty vision.

---

**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Lost Yet Found – Most Auspicious**

Rushing forward, the path is lost at the fork,
The heart heavy with sorrow.
Then, a celestial melody rings clear—
Only now does the radiance appear.

When the mind is lost, one stumbles at the crossroads;
When the spirit is distraught, actions become erratic.
In peril, a kind soul offers enlightenment—words of wisdom like celestial music;
In adversity, a noble person lends aid—once more, the light of day is seen.

---

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Encountered Yet Unmet – Most Inauspicious**

**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Wealth Piled Like Mountains – Most Inauspicious**

A mountain of treasures stands before you,
Yet the traveler departs empty-handed.
Wisdom and skill are but vain exertions—
A fleeting laugh between dream and soul.

One who fails to accumulate goodness enters the treasure mountain and leaves with empty hands;
The Dao is scarce in affinity—even if one meets a true immortal, there are no eyes to recognize them.
Opportunity arrives, yet through hesitation and misjudgment, all schemes and strategies come to naught;
Good fortune presents itself, yet through discord and misstep, all plans and efforts prove useless.

---

**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Troubles Unresolved – Most Inauspicious**

Riding a tiger, dismounting is perilous—
One must follow the moment, circling endlessly.
Yet should the day come when freedom is won,
How joyous the fulfillment of my lifelong resolve!

Ascending a perilous cliff, the heart must not grow careless—carelessness brings harm to oneself;
Riding a fierce beast, one cannot dismount—dismounting invites devouring.
In this time of worry, it is best to remain humble and reverent, awaiting the turn of events;
Only when one attains liberation may one truly know the ease of casting aside concerns and wandering freely.

---

**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Affairs Hindered – Most Inauspicious**

Thin mist gathers into dense gloom,
The sky darkens, and clarity eludes.
The traveler sighs in vain—
The road ahead remains long.

Thick gloom obscures the sky, leaving no distinction between dusk and dawn;
Setting forth empty-handed, one suddenly falls into a mire of confusion.
Plans unfulfilled, the journey ahead is fraught with obstacles—water divides villages, and mist veils the paths;
People remain obstructed, and even more so when awakening is hindered—clouds shroud the fields and trails.

---

**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Reunion After Parting – Most Auspicious**

Years have passed since we last parted,
Our reunion now a chance encounter.
Once more, the feast is laid, and cups are raised—
Laughter and joy intertwine anew.

An old friend, cherished in parting, is met again with the joy of shared cups and plates;
The precious moon, though once waning, holds the promise of reunion.
Matters of fate are as easily turned as the palm—smiles bloom, and faces brighten;
Times of prosperity and peace are like a wheel rolling forward—joy descends as if from heaven.

---

**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Persistence in Affairs – Neutral**

Three visits are needed before the meeting,
A single word will not suffice to turn away.
Only after repeated efforts
Does the smile of success appear.

Knocking at the gate thrice, one does not shirk the toil of coming and going;
If matters could be settled with a single word, how could there be no room for consent?
Though persistence may require repeated attempts, sincerity will ultimately bear fruit;
By steadfastly holding to one course with diligence, no task will remain unaccomplished.

---

**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Tidings of Joy – Most Auspicious**

A flock of crows flies through the clouds—
Only now is the message known.
Seated, one awaits the return of the reply,
And the traveler is but a short distance away.

A wild goose’s foot bears a letter—joy comes with the beautiful tidings from the clouds;
A fish’s belly carries a note—happiness arrives with the fine news from the waters.
For the one seated in wait, the return is not far off;
For the one but a short distance away, the reunion is but a day or night away.

---

**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Emerging from Darkness – Most Auspicious**

A precious amnesty descends from heaven,
And the gates of darkness open of their own accord.
Transgressions and offenses are absolved,

**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Incompatibility – Most Inauspicious**

Do not attempt to carve unyielding stone,
Nor plant a withered willow.

Firefly vies with moonlight,
How vast the difference in scale!
Wasting spirit and strength,
Only to be mocked in the end.

A single leaf of a boat cannot bear the weight of ten thousand jun;
A shallow pool cannot stir waves a hundred feet high.
Wisdom and insight dull, unfit for the court’s halls;
Daoist practice lax, lacking the bone-structure of immortals.

---

**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Hai – No Aid, No Hope – Most Inauspicious**

Without study, the Dao remains unknown;
Without cultivation, truth is not met.
Not a trace of effort—
Only an empty name in vain.

Learning and conduct refined, how could official rank and glory be absent?
Yet with neither virtue nor learning cultivated,
Hopes for wealth, honor, and fame are far off indeed.
