The *Record of Attendant Yang to the Morning Emperor, Eastern Florescence’s Supreme Assistant Controller of Destiny*:
The Perfected Consort of the Nine Florescence Palace of the Purple Clarity Upper Palace, bestower of scriptures, bore the surname Yang, with the personal name Xihe, and was a disciple of the Lady of Southern Marchmount. He was also the master of Xu Xianhou and the transmitter of the *Scriptures of the Morning Emperor’s Salvation*.

Born in the ninth month of the gengyin year of the fifth reign of Emperor Cheng of Jin (330 CE), he served as a secretary in the residence of Emperor Jianwen. The host of Perfected Ones began descending frequently in the early Xingning era (363 CE). By the third year, the yichou year (365 CE), the Consort An descended to the mortal realm. Thereafter, they descended repeatedly, though their affairs remained obscure, as if destined to lay aside their swords and conceal their transformations.

In the thirteenth year of the Taiyuan era, the wuzi year (388 CE), he ascended upon clouds and rode dragons to the west, where he paid homage to the Grand Primordium, and to the north, where he attended the Jade Clarity. There, he was entrusted with the affairs of the celestial chariot, assisted the Four Auxiliaries, attended the Morning Emperor in person, and oversaw the offices of spirits and gods across the vastness of Wu and Yue. Yet his records have not been widely revealed to the world.

The Perfected Consort of the Nine Florescence Palace:
On the night of the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month in the third year of the Xingning era, the yichou year (365 CE), the Lady Wang of the Purple Tenuity descended, accompanied by a divine maiden. The maiden wore a cloud-brocade robe, crimson above and azure below, its patterns radiant and resplendent. At her waist hung a green embroidered sash, from which dangled over ten small bells, some azure, some yellow, interspersed in alternation. From her left side hung a jade pendant, much like those worn in the mortal world, though slightly smaller. Her garments shimmered with a luminous sheen, illuminating the chamber as if sunlight were refracted through mica.

Her cloud-like tresses were meticulously arranged into a topknot, with the remaining hair cascading down to her waist. Her fingers bore gold and silver rings, and white pearls adorned her arms. She appeared to be around thirteen or fourteen years of age. Flanking her were two attendants: one dressed in vermilion, bearing a green patterned satchel and holding a brocade pouch. The pouch measured about one or two *chi* in length and contained some ten scrolls. Its mouth was sealed with a white jade clasp, upon which was inscribed: *"Purple Prime Elixir Chapters of the Divine Tiger of Jade Clarity."*

The other attendant wore azure robes and carried a white box, bound with crimson cords, resembling ivory in shape. Both attendants appeared to be around seventeen or eighteen, exquisitely adorned. The divine maiden and her attendants possessed radiant complexions, lustrous as jade, and their presence suffused the air with the fragrance of five incenses, like the scent of burning aloeswood.

When they first entered the chamber, they followed behind the Lady of Purple Tenuity. As the Lady crossed the threshold, she announced: "Today, a noble guest has come to visit and discuss matters of affinity." Thereupon, Xihe rose to his feet. The Lady said: "There is no need to stand on ceremony today; you may simply sit and exchange courtesies." The Lady sat facing south, while Xihe sat that evening upon the lower couch, facing west. The divine maiden then approached and sat beside him, facing east, each performing the ritual gesture with their left hand.

After the courtesies were exchanged, the Lady of Purple Tenuity said: "This is the youngest child of the Golden Terrace Lady, the Primordial Perfected Sovereign of the Grand Void." The Primordial Sovereign of the Grand Void had once dispatched her to Mount Gui to study the Dao of the Upper Clarity. Upon mastering the Dao, she received the scriptures of the Most High and was appointed the Perfected Consort of the Nine Florescence Palace of the Purple Clarity Upper Palace. Thus, she was granted the surname An, the personal name Yupin, and the style Lingxiao.

The Lady of Purple Tenuity then asked Xihe: "Have you ever seen such a person in the mortal world?" Xihe replied: "Her numinous majesty and lofty refinement defy comparison." The Lady laughed heartily, asking: "And what of you, Xihe?" He did not respond further.

The Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity sat in silence for a long while. In her hand, she held three dates, their color like dried dates but larger in shape, without pits and lacking the taste of dates, resembling pears instead. She first offered one to Xihe, then gave another to the Lady of Purple Tenuity, keeping the last for herself, instructing them to eat. After they had consumed them, a long while passed before the Perfected Consort asked Xihe: "How old are you, and in which month were you born?" Xihe promptly replied: "I am thirty-six years old, born in the ninth month of the gengyin year."

The Perfected Consort then said: "Your master, the Lady of Southern Perfection, wields authority as Controller of Destiny, her Dao lofty and wondrous, embodying the ancestral virtue of the august and good. I have long heard of your virtuous reputation and never imagined that today I would have the karmic affinity to meet you. Our joy in this meeting of unseen destinies is like the entwining of pines and creepers." Xihe, addressing her by name, replied: "Mired in the dust of the lower world, my nature is base and my spirit distant. Without the karmic connection to receive your reverence, I have rashly incurred your numinous descent. My joy is boundless, and I can only hope for your instruction to dispel my ignorance. This has been my lifelong aspiration."

The Perfected Consort said: "Your words should not be so modest. Such self-deprecation is hardly fitting." After another long silence, she declared: "I wish to compose a written message to bestow upon you. Would you be willing to transcribe my humble thoughts?" Xihe replied: "I shall obey your command." He immediately prepared paper and brush, and as the Perfected Consort spoke, he transcribed her poem:

> The numinous pass stands firm in the empty void,
> The jade terrace refines the dense mists of Yu.
> The Purple Palace rides the green radiance,
> The numinous observatory gleams, towering and majestic.
> Within the vermilion chambers of the jade portico,
> The supreme virtue blazes like crimson clouds.
> Below, I rinse my mouth with the essence of the divine flask,
> Above, I grasp the azure blossoms of the celestial banners.
> I bathe my feet in the Jade Heavenly Pool,
> And pluck the zither by the Herdboy’s River.
> Then I urge my cloud-borne chariot,
> And rein the dragons along the dark slopes.
> I shake my robes amidst the dust and filth,
> And lift my skirts to tread the waves of light.
> I vow to bind myself to the mountains and marshes,
> That hardness and softness may harmonize in compliance.
> Together we shall ascend the realm of dual purity,
> Where the Dao of the Upper Perfected knows no deviation.
> The Purple Tenuity gathers in wise counsel,
> And the songs of acceptance bring abundant blessings.

When Xi He had finished writing, she took it up to examine, then said: "Now I gift this to you, to proclaim my cinnabar heart—do not speak of it thus. Should there be anything in your mind that remains unclear, you may discreetly inquire."

The Lady of Purple Tenuity then said: "I shall compose another sheet of writing for your enlightenment, to show you a single good deed." Xi He again spread paper and dipped her brush, and the Lady dictated this poem:

> The Two Images float within and without,
> The dark qi is truly divided at the center.
> The hidden meeting requires no chariot—
> What we await is the precious attainment of the Real.
> The Southern Marchmount forges luminous gold,
> While the distant gaze tilts at perilous eaves.
> Noble virtue soars, illumined by flying rosy clouds,
> And thus moves the numinous folk of the Empyrean.
> Mounting the terrace, we recline amidst layered curtains,
> Together in the feast, we grasp the crimson clouds.
> Looking up, I sigh at the boundary of heaven and man—
> Within the reckoning, green naturally abides.
> The supreme Dao is truly without deviation,
> While dust and filth are not what is heard!
> With shared vision, we perceive the eternal image,
> Raising our voices in song for your sake.

When she had finished writing, the Lady of Purple Tenuity took it up to read. After perusing it, she said: "I give this to you. Today, through me, you become the host of the green cause, and I the guest of your intent’s counsel."

The Lady of Purple Tenuity then said: "Tomorrow, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount shall return, and I shall go with the Perfected Consort to welcome her at the cloud’s edge. If she does not return tomorrow, it will be a matter of several days."

After a long while, the Lady of Purple Tenuity said: "I depart now. Tomorrow, I shall come with the Perfected Consort to visit you." She then descended her alms bowl and vanished from sight. The Perfected Consort lingered briefly behind, saying: "The hidden feelings are not yet settled, the vital intent not yet forgotten—I imagine you will both chant these verses. Tomorrow, I shall return again." She then took Xi He’s hand and descended in form. Before she had passed through the doorway, she suddenly disappeared.

On the evening of the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, the host of perfected beings arrived in procession, as follows:

The Lady Sovereign of Purple Tenuity...

The Perfected Consort of Nine Radiance of the Upper Palace of Purple Clarity,
The Perfected Master Xi Yang of Purple Yang,
The Lady Sovereign of Life-Destiny of the Upper Perfected, the Southern Marchmount,
The Lord of Mao Peak,
The Perfected of Pure Numinosity,
The Lesser Lord of Mao Peak.

There was also one person, very young in years, with an extraordinary beard, wearing a lotus crown, clad in vermilion robes, with white pearls sewn along the seams, and girded with a sword. None had ever seen this person before. He came often to discuss matters of Mount Jinting, conversing with the host of perfected beings. There were also things that could not be understood, yet he bowed in reverence to the three female perfected—Lady Sovereign of Purple Tenuity, Lady of Purple Clarity, and the Southern Perfected—and spoke with them as equals. It was said he was Wang Ziqiao, the Perfected of Mount Tongxiang. He did not speak with Xi He at all.

Previously, when perfected beings first descended, they initially did not immediately converse with Xi He. Each sat for a long while, until the Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity said: "I would trouble your hand once more, Illustrious Lord, to inscribe something with brush, that we may disperse intent and forget words—would this be permissible?" Xi He then spread out paper and waited to receive it. The Perfected Consort slowly spoke, and he recorded her words:

"I am the youngest beloved daughter of the Primordial Lord, the Lady of Grand Void Li. Long ago, I first studied the Dao on Tortoise Terrace, received jade scriptures from the Most High, bore the tiger register of the Purple Emperor, and wielded the jade scepter of the Five Thearchs. I was granted the scriptures and became a consort of the Upper Perfected, to wander and traverse the Jade Clarity. Often, I personally fanned the Nine Nets, my feet treading the Dark Chamber. My cloud-form roams the numinous void, gazing upward to grasp the root of the sun."

Entering the feast of the Seven Palaces, departing with reins of cloud-chariots. Treading the Three Luminaries to ascend together, scattering radiant clouds to soar in flying carriages. Not that I could not choose the Upper Chambers, seek out the Purple Youths, find a worthy companion in the Jade Palace, or pair with a lofty spirit to become a couple—indeed, I have drawn near to the wondrous friends among the imperial ministers. Yet I simply follow the turning of the mechanism, submit to the reckoning of fate, bend down to mirror the dust and foam, and descend in step with the dragons. I summoned the hidden and potent male, pursued the solitary and companionable flock. From past lives, we were bound by silent accord. Our names were fixed in the plain covenant of the Jade Realm; our principles aligned in dual blessings. Carrying the fan to journey, sharing gourd-cups of flavor, binding skirts in libation, gazing back at the assembly of peers—within, I concealed the true methods. Proceeding thus, my lot in the unseen was already determined. The Azure Writs of the Upper Prime were examined; therefore, the heart’s distinctions of noble and base were already equalized. The delight of facing the light was already fulfilled. To attain my wish and wander with joy, combining past and present intent—how could this not be fitting?

Yet this is merely the great lineage of the Two Images, the paired offices of inner and outer. Truly, it is not the means to transform and return to simplicity, to congeal in pure emptiness, to wield the spirit-knife. The Seven Burdens are left to fate; the Great Simplicity preserves the true. Unfolding the Luminous Simplicity of the Jade Clarity, this is called the Eight Voids. Flourishing in serene loftiness, luxuriant and soaring through the clouds, it makes the winds sing on the cloud-paths, dragons chant and tigers roar. The Heavenly Sovereign’s paired luminaries ascend far to the Starry Tower. Flying stars hurl their light; sun and moon illuminate the body. The mouth exhales dark mist; the eyes flash lightning. Above, I repose in the flawless chamber, roaming through the Jade Clarity. Hands grasp radiant clouds; feet tread the Golden Court. From this moment, in the instant of attaining the Dao, should one firmly exhaust inner and outer, aligning principle with metal and stone? Or should emotions entwine in dual affection, hearts united in the bedchamber’s intimacy? Why must one embrace the balance of years, engage in fleeting unions, defile the seven spirits, and grieve the maddened soul?

This is merely my inquiry into your lineage, Illustrious Lord—there is no impropriety. Now, my aspirations hold true feeling, already as one with yours. We should join our four-horse chariots in the Jade Void, pair our journey to the Northern Mystery. Together, we shall pluck crimson fruits in the Jade Garden, gather cinnabar blossoms in the Orchard of Yu, share drink from the waters of the Purple River, and bathe together on the shores of the Azure Pool. Clad in robes of purple down, crowned with solar coronets, we shall wander the Upper Clarity, jointly pay homage to the Three Primes. The Eight Luminaries emerge and descend; phoenixes circle the Dragon Terrace. Above, we sip golden marrow, chant the songs of the Jade Mystery. Floating in the void, we feast in high assembly at the Great Dawn. The Four Balances resound in song; the Fragrant Mother presents mist. Heads aligned, we gaze together, sashes intertwined in fellowship. Is this not joy? Is this not the fulfillment of ambition?

Illustrious Lord, follow this meeting—my heart has no refusal. Moreover, I cannot turn from reality to darkness, idly indulging my breast’s inclinations." Having spoken, she took up the writing to examine it, saying: "Now, with this text, I dispel your stagnant doubts." She finished speaking and laughed for a long while.

The Lady of the Purple Tenuity said: "The Perfected Consort’s words are exhausted; the threads of affection are manifest. You can no longer harbor any reservations—this is the work of the unseen fate of the dark reckoning."

The Lady of the Southern Marchmount, having seen the written words, said: "The unseen destiny stirs in resonance; the dark reckoning aligns. Responding to fate’s summons, bound by karmic affinity—this is the excellent affair of joining with the true. It merely demonstrates the name of paired counterparts, defining the offices of inner and outer. There is no need to blindly follow the world’s corrupt defilements or engage in the nearness of lewd impurity. To pair with a numinous consort and meet in radiance, to betroth the noble Perfected’s youngest daughter—thus, in this intimate union, there is great benefit for advancing one’s practice, and no fear of harm or severance. The thousand spirits may be made to witness; no further argument remains. The Perfected Consort must be capable of bearing this task; the cloud-chariot must be capable of joint harnessing. Long ago, I once spoke to you of this intent through the Lady of the Purple Tenuity. Now, your wish is fulfilled, which makes me rejoice. Be careful not to harbor doubts or scorn in your heart.

Yesterday, I saw the Lady Li of the Golden Terrace in the Clear Void, who said you still harbored doubts in your heart, your countenance and qi slightly resentful. To reject this undertaking would be a grave error. The Perfected Consort possesses the Inner True Cinnabar and Azure Jade Writs of the Spirit Tiger—these are not things your kind possesses. With true talent, you seek to transcribe them; how could she conceal them? Now, what does the Grand Minister grasp? Merely texts and patterns—will you surely ride the luminous jade clouds? If there is anything not yet understood, you should subtly inquire into its feasibility."

The Perfected Consort, seeing the Lady’s written words, laughed and said: "Hand in hand on the paired terraces, sighing at the fine meeting of radiant cakes—how nearly equal is this!"

The Perfected of the Clear Void presented a text, saying: "The Way of the Yellow and Red, the method of blending qi—these are but one of the techniques Zhang Ling received to propagate and transform his lineage, not the affair of true persons. I have often seen those who practice this cut off their lineage, never one who cultivated this and attained life. Among millions, none have escaped being tested by this."

Among ten million, should one err and attain it, the attainment extends no further than mere immortality. Zhang Ling received this to teach the world, yet even Ling’s later transformations no longer practiced it.

Beware of speaking of the lower Way of the turbid living, for it corrupts the upright qi of the true Empyrean. Those who harbor lustful desires, fix their minds on the contemplation of sensual forms, and yet attempt to practice the higher Way—these merely make plain the punishments of the Three Bureaus. This is what is called embracing jade to rush into fire, or burying a dog in a golden coffin.

The contemplation of sensual forms is called the Yellow and Red; the higher Way is called the Hidden Writ. That people remain so perplexed by this is truly lamentable.

The Lady of Purple Tenuity presented a text, saying: The Yellow Writ and Red Realm, though the secret essentials of long life, are in truth the lower arts of attaining life, not the discourse proper to those of the Upper Palace who feast on radiant cakes and banquet in the luminous Empyrean. This Way lies merely in nurturing and propagating life, not in the higher Way.

Those who harbor lustful qi and yet attempt to practice it alongside the higher Way—such Hidden Writs are but the brush of the Water Bureau, the drum of the Three Bureaus. Neither the Mystic Support nor the Release of Gratitude can be relied upon. In short: purity invites the descent of the numinous; devotion commands the service of the spirits.

What the Perfected value in pairing with the luminous is the preservation of this. When paired partners cherish one another, it is in the twofold luminosity; though named husband and wife, they do not engage in the nearness of husband and wife. This is but an empty name to display to the senses.

Should the Yellow and Red linger in the heart, even the Perfected cannot be seen, nor the numinous beings approached. One toils in vain at the tasks, and the Three Bureaus will still exact their labor.

At cockcrow, the Lady of Southern Marchmount presented a text, saying: The cock has crowed; the green of affection deepens.

The Perfected of Purple Yang presented a text, saying: The Grand Void soars high and far, meeting in the manner of the rites of worthy reception. Inscribed in the unseen workings, you must guard your heart from doubt regarding the Yellow and Red.

The Lord of Mao Peak presented a text, saying:
The mystic standard touches the palace of luminous scenes,
Harmonizing dust, the jade chime resounds.
The subtle chamber’s pure wind drifts—
How can one not be exhorted to this?

When the words were finished, the Perfected each departed. The Perfected Consort lingered briefly behind, saying: I trouble you, Illustrious Lord, for one more discourse. And she presented a text, saying:
Forget cares, embrace simplicity;
Let your radiant heart align in perfect accord.
Soon you shall frequently attend the reverent purity of the Empyrean,
Joining the flowing luminosity in the dark convergence of vision,
Unfurling the luxuriant and leading forth the elegant.
I deem your lofty and numinous brilliance
To have cast off stagnation and forgotten vulgarity.

When the words were finished, she took his hand to descend. Before reaching the question of the corpse, she suddenly vanished.

On the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, the Perfected Consort of Nine Flowers presented a text, saying:
The luminous converges in paired presence,
Clouds gather in the mystic descent.
Dragon’s elegance fills the five voids,
Plucking jade within the towering chambers.
A long song in the numinous caress,
Brilliant and wondrous, the jade portals open afar.
Leaving affairs to bid the world eternal farewell,
Rosy mists and crimson waves—
Lightning hastens to the purple perch.
Beyond the shared resonance of purity,
Together we roam the cloudy peaks and vast cliffs—
Is this not excellence? Is this not joy?

The sun is the fruit of the rosy mists;
The rosy mists are the essence of the sun.
Though you have heard the method of ingesting the sun’s fruit,
You have not yet known the essence of dining on rosy mists.
The scriptures of dining on rosy mists are most secret;
The Way of summoning rosy mists is most easy.
This is called the method of embodying life to reflect the jade light of the Upper Clarity.

The eyes are the mirrors of the body;
The ears are the windows of the frame.
Excessive seeing dims the mirror;
Excessive hearing shuts the windows.
I possess the stone for polishing mirrors
And the art for clearing windows—
Thus one may penetrate the myriad numinous,
Peer into the subtlest sounds, and perceive afar.
Is this acceptable?

The face is the courtyard of the spirit;
The hair is the blossom of the brain.
Sorrow mars the face;
Concealment within the brain whitens the hair.
Thus the inner essence is lost,
And the cinnabar fluids are depleted.
I possess the scripture for restoring the youthful face
And the method for returning whiteness.
Is this acceptable?

Essence is the spirit of the body;
Clarity is the treasure of the frame.

Excessive toil scatters essence;
Rivalrous striving dissipates clarity.
Thus age follows the fall of qi,
And senility soon arrives.
I possess the Dao for replenishing essence
And the scripture for prolonging clarity—
Is this acceptable?

These four ways are the inner texts of the Upper Clarity,
Verified true chapters of immediate efficacy.
I now wish to present them
To aid and augment your luminous illumination.

When the transmission was complete, she took them to show
Xi He, who responded with murmurs of assent and entreaty.

On the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, the Realized One of Tongwu descended again in silence. Xi He was commanded to write the day’s message:

“The eight radiant realms and four distant poles—
How vast the numinous shores!
Rare words sprout like sharp blades;
Exquisite tones gather like ringing chimes.
At dawn, one soars through limpid purity;
Mysterious qi ascends to the heavens.
The body transcends the Jade Void;
The heart leaves behind all hardship and strife.
One sinks into stillness beyond the finest nets,
Congeals harmony beyond the silent waves.
Such a person shall surely roam the boundless void,
Dwell together in the courts of the Realized.
The Three Primes may then be seen,
And a crimson name may be established.

But if the heart drifts with errant waves,
The eyes fix upon the veils of form—
If in motion one shares the snares of the world,
In stillness divides with contention—
Then the path to immortality stretches far,
And the gates of rebirth remain barred.
Take heed, child.”

Xi He finished writing, took up the text, and presented it.

On the night of the thirtieth day of the sixth month, the Perfected Consort of Nine Flowers descended together with the Lady of the Purple Tenuity and the Lady of South Marchmount. After sitting for a long while, the Perfected Consort commanded her attendant maidens to open her brocade satchel and take out two scrolls to present, bidding them be copied. The titles of the books are as follows:

*The Esoteric Writ of the Jade Radiance and Purple Glow of Supreme Purity*
*The Book of Returning to Dawnlight and Rejoining Childlike Splendor of Supreme Purity*

The above are the names of the two scrolls.

On the night of the first day of the seventh month, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, the Lady of South Marchmount, the Perfected Consort of Nine Flowers, the Three Perfected Ones of the Clear and Numinous Wutong of Purple Tenuity, and the Second Lord Mao descended together. After a long while, Xi He then addressed the assembled spirits, seeking the art of securing her person, desiring to know the distinction between noble and base, the convergence of lifespan and fate, and the fixed limits of their measure.

Thereupon, the Perfected Consort smiled and, after a long pause, bestowed upon her this teaching: “On this day, the Radiant Lord possesses a nature both serene and untrammeled, secretly structuring the jadelike clarity. A lofty current from an orchid pool, a pure resonance in the golden palace—truly, one who can treasure and conceal the rare, whose inner truth shines in seclusion. You ascend the ladder of numinous scriptures, ride the numbers in accord with life. With unsullied virtue in the divine garden, a cinnabar record in the Jade Purity, you stir mist and pluck the sun’s rays, sound the distant drum of the hidden. You shall surely become one of the Three Exalted Ministers, attending the Celestial Emperor’s person, a high aide to the Four Assistants, bearing the commands of the Sagely Lord. You shall govern life and sever death, reward and punish spirits, command the thousand numina, seal mountains and summon clouds. Presiding over the harmonious qi of yin and yang, you shall be elevated as the lord of the spirits of Wu and Yue.

As for me, I emerged from the congealed vision of destiny, born of flourishing radiance. My spirit soars through the nine heavens, my empty tones weave the celestial chambers. Following the turning of the Four Awakenings, I ascend the mysterious ladder in shared likeness. My purple name is inscribed in the Supreme, my pure script in the Eight Effulgences. My spirit illumines the western glow, my virtue gleams within. Thus, I received the scriptures and rode the qi to assume the office of Perfected Consort. Moreover, I shall assist you in unifying the Three Huo, governing the myriad spirits, facing the Northern Emperor to command, restraining the calamities of Dengshan. We shall join sleeves in the empty chamber, ride the mist in the sevenfold auspicious convergence, and occupy the inner groves of the numinous forest.

Therefore, when you were born in Yang, I found peace. Since I descended from the Mystery, and you received the scriptures in the Western Palace, from the north you harnessed the sun’s rays, rode the plow’s eastern shaft, grasped the reins and held the iron, exclusively governing the eastern frontier. The Three Offices presented the universal mandate of rivers and mountains, the Celestial Soldiers offered their might, and the Four Armored Ones guarded the passes. At this time, it was indeed the height of the Radiant Lord’s nobility, the grand spectacle of the true immortals. Among the Three Offices, there has long been a hidden saying: ‘Yang An, the Great Lord, oversees the destiny of the true spirits’—this refers to none other than us. Since the Sagely Emperor’s parallel reign began, twenty-eight years have passed. Twenty-two years hence, the Radiant Lord shall ride the dragon and mount the clouds, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. First, you shall proceed to the Western Palace of Supreme Purity, then pay court to the Jade Emperor of the Three Primes in the north, after which you shall be entrusted with the affairs of the eastern brush.

This is because your jadelike clarity and purple radiance of Purple Tenuity, your golden tones and empty command, have been commended by the Supreme Ultimate. Your dark virtue has risen above, no longer requiring the toil of diligent study or the traversing of mountains and rivers. If you were to exert yourself further in refinement, your spirit would become even more luminous and pure—yet this would hardly compare to the effortless attainment of today. In the present age, the world’s snares entangle all, and the distinctions between noble and base are mired in the dusty toils of gain and loss. Truly, these are not matters a perfected one should engage in. Rather, one should remain at ease, whether in hardship or prosperity, whether encountering adversity or fortune.

When I see the Radiant Lord’s ease, I am truly delighted. When I witness the Radiant Lord’s adversity, my countenance grows sorrowful. These two sentiments manifest upon the face. Yet even this is insufficient to reach far—how much more does long sorrow weigh upon the heart? As for inner darkness aligning with shadows, guarding the mystery and cherishing the dusty world, mingling form with the chambers of the age—how could I, on account of fleeting transgressions or the brevity of lowly station, bring shame to the fixed essence of the true?

Yin and yang are the instruments of adversity and prosperity. The two images being arrayed, gain and loss intertwine—these are but the paths of coming and going. Those who dwell in the scorching turmoil of the world’s dust are but the sinful ghosts of the lower realms, the doomed natures hastening toward death. To reside in uselessness amid the clamor is to attain the unhewn simplicity of the true. To entrust oneself to the ordinary within and contemplate inwardly is the root and beginning of spirit immortality.

Wealth and nobility, indulgence and excess—these are the axes and saws that break the bones, akin to the carts and boats that carry the condemned. Glory and splendor, pride in the world, striving and vying for fleeting moments—these are sufficient only to invite transgression and calamity. Humiliation is the weapon that severs life; it is no fine thing. Thus, the lofty ones of antiquity, foreseeing the difficulty of avoiding fault and knowing the perils of wealth and nobility, retired to wander the deep forests and dwell in the renowned mountains. They chewed the harmonious qi, rinsed and bathed in clear streams, seeking to distance themselves from this evil edge and pursue abundant fortune. They transcended the entanglements of the self, preserving their pristine essence.

Why, then, should you strive so eagerly for the distinctions of noble and base among mortals, casting yourself into the marketplace of glory and disgrace? Moreover, the age now turns to warfare, and the three disasters converge daily. The divine winds approach, driving away the foul vapors. The bright metal of heaven mingles with filth in the muddy ditches, jewels and jade are defiled by dung to attract dust. Blood stains the garments, the turbid harms the true, and the mysterious path stretches far—this is the time. If you cannot endure the smoke of wind and fire, and wish to embrace the true in the secluded groves, you may seek the Way of the Unsheathed Sword to end yourself, or the gathering of silent retreat, the nearness of concealment and revelation. The moment will determine the course; the choice rests with the Radiant Lord.

The hidden reckoning above responds to destiny and meets in accord. The numinous scriptures of the Jade Terrace align with the true and merge with the radiance. Thus, my words are tender in speech, my heart resolved in writing. Do I sigh for you alone? No—this is but an illustration of the division of names and fates.”

Having finished writing, she took the text and gave it to Xi He, adding, “Ponder this, and your ailments shall soon improve.”

To the north we ascend the Gate of Mystic Truth,
hand in hand we weave the lofty net.
Incense smoke scatters across the Eight Radiant Lands,
the mystic wind stirs the crimson waves.
Gazing up, we transcend the Ford of Lang Garden;
looking down, we tread the slopes of Xiaoling’s ridge.
Jade flutes sing above the clouds,
phoenixes cry through the ninefold distances.
Riding the qi, we float through the great void—
why then should we trample the mountains and rivers?
With golden tablets we summon the feathered spirits,
marshalling our forces to break the ten thousand demons.
Embracing the twin dawn glows,
a thousand pillars stand firm as infant teeth.
Those who lose their truth and plunge into the halls of strife
know not what else to do.
I raise my voice to the Palace of Great Radiance,
where golden gates gleam in the Purple Clarity.
Resplendent chambers reflect the Great Simplicity,
their four pavilions all of crimson jasper.
Tossing the wheel at the Ford of Empty Unity,
we gather the reins to dance the Green Plough.
Jade blossoms fly like cloud-canopies,
the Western Consorts unfurl brocade banners.
Suddenly we leave the dusty, turbid shore,
in an instant we arrive at the courtyard of the fair one.
Long-awaited resonance brings timely descent—
what was summoned now dwells in the unseen.
Riding the phoenix, we play the music of dawn’s sky,
together feasting in the cinnabar groves of Ying.
Dukes and lords remain distant and small—
how could they know the numinous power of the Perfected?

These two poems were transmitted on the twentieth day of the tenth month.
Here concludes the record of the Attendant of the Lord of Dawn, transmitted by the Eastern Flower Sovereign and the Director of Destinies.
