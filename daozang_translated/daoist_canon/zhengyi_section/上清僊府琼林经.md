**The Upper Clarity Jade Grove of the Immortal Palaces Scripture**

**Scripture Title:** *The Upper Clarity Jade Grove of the Immortal Palaces Scripture*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Compiled from excerpts of the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, *Declarations of the Perfected*, *Concealed Instructions for Ascending to Perfection*, and other Upper Clarity School cultivation scriptures and methods. One scroll. Base text from: *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Zhengyi Section, First Subsection.

The *Upper Clarity Jade Grove of the Immortal Palaces Scripture* states:

Heaven possesses the Mysterious One, born of the Great Yang, named the Flowing Pearl, the gate of all wonders. To obtain and retain it is to attain longevity.

Humans possess the Three Ones, each dwelling in different places. To master and guard them all is to become a King of Immortals.

One resides in the North Pole’s Great Abyss, before which lies the Hall of Light, below which is the Crimson Palace, above which is the Floral Canopy, with jade towers of ten thousand layers.

It further states: The Perfected Purple Yang said, "In my early Daoist studies, I received the true names of the Three Ones from the Perfected Su Zixuan of Mount Song. Zixuan taught me the method of guarding the One, comprising over two hundred matters. I practiced them faithfully and became a Perfected of the Upper Clarity. That Dao is most authentic."

It further says: The twenty-four qi correspond to the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Tenuity. With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, feathered canopies and cloud-borne carriages, they unite with the Primordial Chart of the Purple Palace and Upper Clarity. If one guards this with unwavering firmness, essence responds and resonance flows unimpeded, then the Three Ones may be seen. When the Three Ones are seen, the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders appear, the feathered canopy may be mounted, and the cloud-borne carriage may be ridden. Ascending to the Great Tenuity, merging the twenty-four qi, one beholds the Twenty-Four Perfected, soars through the Upper Clarity, and is listed in the Primordial Chart. This is the way of ascending to heaven in broad daylight, concurrently practicing the Dao of the Grotto Chambers.

It further says: The Upper One is the utmost of the true, the Middle One the perfection of the true, the Lower One the subtlety of the true. The Heavenly Sovereign attained the utmost and thus ascended to the Imperial Ultimate; the Earthly Sovereign attained perfection and thus ascended to the Orthodox One; the Human Sovereign attained subtlety and thus ascended to become the Lord of Myriad Wonders. The Three Sovereigns embodied the true to guard the One, thus the One conceals no form. Immortals seek the true to pursue the One, thus the Three Ones are all illuminated. When the One conceals no form, its true nature is utmost; when the Three Ones are all illuminated, it is simply the attainment of the One.

The *Original Record of the Upper Perfected’s Birth and Transformations* states: The August Emperor opens the true, the nine ways unite in clarity. Refining the primordial void, illuminating the Upper Clarity, dividing forms and transforming radiance, the four movements follow generation. The eight effulgences support and assist, conveying the cinnabar carriage, riding clouds and driving mist, urging on to the Upper Clarity, soaring through the cloud chambers, and paying court to the Imperial Capital.

It further says: For those cultivating the Dao of the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens, regularly on the winter solstice, bathe and enter the chamber, face west and bow nine times, and pay homage to the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens. Naturally, one may ride the nine-colored cloud chariot and soar to the Upper Clarity.

It further says: The upper spirits of the Nine Heavens are primordially spontaneous... The Central Treasure of Purple Primordiality, the Three Purities externally entwined...

Penetrating transformation enters the subtle; my Dao was early apportioned. The eyes summon numinous radiance; the heart unfolds the five clouds. Urging the eight effulgences, I fly into the imperial dawn.

It further says: Embracing the true and inheriting qi, the form excels in the purple heavens. Riding clouds and driving the floating, bathing in the radiance of the eight mists...

Obtaining the carriage of the empyrean, ascending to the Jade Dawn.

It further says: The sevenfold-luminous palace of jade and forest.

It further says: Internally, one contains the numinous immortal; externally, one refines the true countenance. The Jade Pool’s floral dew flows and moistens the purple chamber.

It further says: The Supreme Jade Dawn, revolving radiance in the empty clarity. Dividing forms and transforming convergence, ninefold refinement of the Three Perfected.

It further says: The prayer text for the qi of the Morning Brilliance of the Three Primordial Lords of the Upper Primordial and Great Simplicity states: The Three Purities revolve the primordial heavens; the clear empyrean supports the Jade Numinous...

Though the great rosy clouds stretch afar, the penetrating radiance discerns the affectionate. Together we carry the jade tally, jointly awaiting the carriage of the Nine Heavens.

It further says: The Great Simplicity urges the movement; the four effulgences fly in the void.

It further says: The August Clarity marks the morning radiance; the numinous qi supports the void’s ascent. Drifting, drifting to the Nine Primordials above, gently, gently entering the imperial dawn.

It further says: The Four Elders and Middle Perfected scatter flowers in the cloud chambers.

It further says: The Mysterious Dawn girds the lofty numinous; the Perfected Governor of the Eight Clarities. Jade brilliance unfolds the cinnabar chamber; the purple phoenix illuminates the cloud encampment.

It further says: I ride the auspicious day to ascend and report to the imperial numinous. Seeking immortality and ascending in flight, I obtain the carriage of flowing radiance.

It further says: The Primordial Purple Sovereign, the Dao harmonizes with the mysterious void. Three transformations and nine divisions merge and transform the Great Beginning. Flying clouds and flowing supports, the azure canopy and green carriage.

It further says: The night sky brightens and clears; the hidden void reveals the true. Flowing clouds linger; golden flowers scatter in four directions. The Cinnabar Sovereign spreads radiance; clouds fly to the purple carriage.

The *Jade Scripture Precious Instructions of the Supreme* states: Ascending to the Jade Clarity within, roaming and feasting beyond the Nine Distant Realms.

It further says: The numinous wind fans the floral fragrance; resplendent and brilliant, unfolding luxuriant finery. The Great Perfected plucks the cloud zither; the assembled immortals play the numinous harp. Refined songs of the Three Heavens’ effulgences scatter blessings in the Jade Floral Grove.

It further says: Learning the Dao depends on cinnabar sincerity; serving the master as one’s closest kin. Drawing radiance to pair with the clear void, diligently renewing with each day. Rising to ascend the Great Clarity, transcending radiance to roam the Nine Empyreans. Preserving the origin and upholding the Dharma’s net, wandering the mysterious and attaining carefree ease. Ten thousand kalpas are like last night; a thousand kalpas like this morning. The numinous banner scatters with the wind; myriad thoughts dissolve in due time.

The *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* states: The Great Feast transcends the Nine Mysteries; the grotto radiance entrusts spiritual communion. The Jade Emperor rides the vermilion empyrean; green rosy clouds adorn the golden walls. The upper palace within the cloud pearls, gazing upward to the Primordial Blade Peak.

It further says: The Flowing Pearl halts its radiance; purple rosy clouds surge in mist. Sevenfold revolving paths; the Three Luminaries illuminate the true.

The *Supreme Primordial Cavern Mystery Great Possession Scripture* states: Dwelling in the numinous cavern, feasting in the radiance of the seven dawns. Clarifying and sprinkling the floral garden, resting in the Nine Mysteries. Transforming radiance in the Jade Void, leading the hosts of heavens.

It further says: The Yin Spirit of the Great Perfected is named the Numinous Woman. Transforming radiance in the Nine Mysteries, riding the true in hidden obscurity. Conveying the flying rosy clouds, ascending to the imperial court.

The scriptures further state: The Nine Mysteries and Nine Heavens lie above the Three Realms.

It further says: Roaming and playing upon the Terrace of the Nine Mysteries, resting and halting by the Western Feather River.

It further says: The Eight Radiant Chariots traverse the heavens.

The *Supreme Cavern Mystery Scripture* says: Crimson clouds obstruct the luminous brilliance; the Eight Radiant Chariots soar through the great void.

It further says: The Eight Vows Mysterious Mother, together with me, roams amidst the Three Mysteries. Then, loosening the reins in the Great Wilderness, we turn the chariot through the Three Mysteries. The Five Numinous Spirits support my back; the Queen Mother sits shoulder to shoulder with me. Dancing wheels upon the divine mounds, we halt our carriage in the Nine Heavens.

The *Inner Scripture of the Cavern Chambers* says: The Limitless Lofty Perfected ones, at dawn within the Vermilion Court, clad in dragon robes and tiger belts, recite the *Cavern Mystery Scripture*. They wander through the Nine Heavens, gathering in the high assembly of the Seven Voids. Riding the flowing chariot of the Empty Cavern, they rein the round carriage of the Great Empyrean.

It further says: I blend within the Five Qi, transforming together to ride the solar chariot. Feasting and gazing beyond the cloudy empyrean, exhaling and inhaling the essence of the Seven Spirits. Reposing within the Nine Mysteries, sitting and rising upon the radiant clouds.

The text derives from the *Scripture of the Five Elders and the Feminine One*.

The *Scripture of the Three Primordials and the True One* says: To the left, spurring the cloud wheels; to the right, urging the flying dragons. Commanding the Twenty-Four Spirits above, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, they summon the Yang and invoke the Yin, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

The *Primordial Register of Mount Tortoise* says: At dawn, soaring in the Grand Solar Observatory; at dusk, nesting in the hidden Langfeng.

It further says: The host of immortals plays amidst the cloudy scenes; vermilion blossoms unfold in the spring sun. The imperial carriage halts amidst the cloud companions; lightly and freely, they soar. Gazing beyond the Eight Extremities, who can fathom the workings of their boundless journey?

It further says: The Three Primordial True Lords transform their forms according to the four seasons, reverting to their original qi, undergoing refinement to restore their forms.

The *Supreme Cavern Mystery Scripture* says: The northern ridges are thick with empyrean mists; crimson trees bear purple blossoms. Azure herbs fall in the phoenix groves; verdant [ ] adorn the rocky cliffs. The numinous towers soar into the great void; jade chambers mingle with the supreme rosy clouds. Cloud upon cloud... The dragon’s breath entwines the Five Clouds. Cloud upon cloud... Vermilion rosy clouds flourish in the morning empyrean.

The *Scripture of the Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings* says: The golden earrings above the Nine Heavens are named Rainbow Radiance, also called the Upper Clarity Palace, within the Great Empyrean. They coalesce from the qi of white mist, numinously reflecting the Nine Heavens. Cloud upon cloud... Their color is like white clouds; their form is like a jade mountain. There is the Palace of the Jasper Grove.

It further says: The Lords of the Nine Heavens are stationed within the Golden Court of the Solar Gate.

It further says: Jade pendants are made from the ethereal essence of the Nine Heavens. Above the Nine Heavens, they are named Morning Lamp. Cloud upon cloud... They coalesce from the qi of green yang, numinously reflecting the Nine Heavens. Cloud upon cloud... Their color is like green jade; their form is like the full moon. Within, there is the Empty Mystery, the Jade Terrace, and the Purple Palace.

It further says: The essence of the solar brilliance and lunar radiance, the rosy clouds of the sun and the luminous reflections of the moon. To the left, revolving the jade pendants; to the right, grasping the golden earrings. The Two Radiant Spirits entwine; the dual souls are at peace. Ascending to the Great Ultimate, descending to the Ten Directions.

The *Scripture of the Purple Book and Golden Root* says: The Azure Essence Lord is the disciple of the Nine Yang Primordial August Jade Emperor. Nurtured in the Heaven of the Primordial Cliff within the Jasper Grove and Seven Treasures of the Jade Mound Kingdom, beneath the seven-colored jasper phoenix that shades his body.

It further says: Dwelling in the realm of luminous rosy clouds, his teachings flow through the ruins of the Jade Kingdom. Grasping the Nine August Sovereigns’ scepters, descending upon the mounds of the Nine Regions. Cloud upon cloud... His house is made of purple clouds; his city is made of green rosy clouds. His halls are of yellow gold; his beds are of white jade.

The *Upper Scripture of the Cinnabar of the Guarded Mystery* says: One *cun* above and inward from the space between the eyebrows is the Double Field of the Guarded Inch. One *cun* inward is the Palace of the Bright Hall. Two *cun* inward is the Palace of the Cavern Chamber. Three *cun* inward is the Palace of the Cinnabar Field. Four *cun* inward is the Palace of the Flowing Pearl. Five *cun* inward is the Palace of the Jade Emperor. One *cun* above the Bright Hall is the Palace of the Celestial Court. One *cun* above the Cavern Chamber is the Palace of the Ultimate Perfection. One *cun* above the Cinnabar Field is the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar. One *cun* above the Flowing Pearl is the Palace of the Supreme August. In all, there are nine palaces within the head.

The meridians of the Bright Hall, Cavern Chamber, Cinnabar Field, and Flowing Pearl Palaces are the Way of the divine immortals to become Perfected Ones, transmitted to the world. The *Scripture of the Mysterious Cinnabar* is also the essential teaching of the True Officials and Directors of Destiny, the guiding principle of the Four Palaces. This scripture may only be imparted when the Lord of the Great Ultimate has given his instruction.

It further says: Within the Palace of the Jade Emperor resides the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity. Within the Palace of the Celestial Court resides the True Woman of Upper Clarity. Within the Palace of Ultimate Perfection resides the Empress of the Great Ultimate. Within the Palace of the Supreme August resides the Sovereign Lady of the Most High. These Four Palaces are all the Feminine True One, whose Dao surpasses that of the Masculine True One. They possess precious scriptures transmitted only to those who have already attained Perfection. Those who have not attained Perfection are not to hear of them; the essentials of the Feminine True One are likewise not to be imparted.

Thus, the Most High emerges to feast amidst the Eight Radiant Spirits and enters to attend the Jasper Pavilion. Three thousand Jade Maidens serve and support the Perfected One; numinous consorts sing in harmony; divine attendants hold the towels. Truly, this is the practice of guarding the Feminine One, used to gather in the high assembly of the Mysterious Dawn. This is the root and origin of the Most High, transmitted by the August Void.

It further says: The Way of the True Lord of the Guarded Cinnabar of the Great One: At dusk, in tranquil repose, dispel all thoughts. Sit or lie as you wish. First, visualize the purple qi of the Northern Culmen star descending and entering your Mysterious Cinnabar. Cloud upon cloud... Then visualize the sun entering the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar, filling the palace within. Amidst the purple qi, gaze as if seeing a fire pearl in the dark. Then visualize the Central Yellow True Lord of Upper Clarity descending from the purple qi of the Northern Culmen into the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar, seated within the sun. The Lord’s name is Guiying, styled Huaxuan. Then visualize your entire body suddenly ascending into the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar, seated before the True Lord of the Great One. Cloud upon cloud... Thereupon, the True Lord of the Great One, together with you, rides the sun into the path of the red qi. Cloud upon cloud... There will be true responses. Cloud upon cloud... Then, together with the Great One, you will arrive at the guiding principle of the Seven Primordials, proceeding to the Upper Clarity Palace.

The *Supreme Dragon Script* further states: "Sit upright in the Palace of Mysterious Cinnabar, neither inclined nor slanted—such is the essence of this Dao." You should visualize the purple qi of the Great One swirling around your body and swallow it. Always visualize the True Lord of the Great One within the purple qi of the Palace of Mysterious Cinnabar. Thus shall you attain boundless longevity, and the myriad calamities shall not assail you—the Dao of Mysterious Cinnabar is complete.

The *Scripture of Daoist Mechanisms* says: "Man takes the body as his kingdom, spirit as his sovereign, essence as his minister, and qi as his people. Qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, and spirit into the infant."

The *Inner Transmission on the Origins of Divine Immortals* states: "On the eight seasonal nodes, all the great sagely honored deities and perfected persons of wondrous conduct ascend without exception to the Upper Palace of the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Capital on Jade Mountain, to pay homage and celebrate the celestial perfected."

The *Cavernous Spirit Section* says:
*"Commanding the radiance of the Great Auroral Palace,
In unison with the wheels of the Nine Heavens’ courts."*

The *Original Register of Mount Tortoise* states: "The perfected one, amid golden halls and jade chambers, within seven-jeweled flower groves and above pools of limpid waters..." Soaring in flight, pacing the void, they feast in jade chambers. Golden terraces and jeweled lights, the eight rarities as viands. Ascending the cavernous emptiness of immortal realms, within Mount Tortoise’s midst, they breakfast on jasper mushrooms and sip jade springs at dusk. All come to assemble: the twelve dark dragons, purple phoenixes, numinous serpents, divine birds in cinnabar chariots, feathered canopies and perfected mounts. The various spirits ascend with cinnabar, the lords follow with numinosity, descending to me.

The *Natural Jade Characters* says:
*"Beyond the celestial balance, in the capital of the Mysterious Capital,
There is the Mountain of Empty Peaks—
The playground of the ten thousand sages.
Those who attain the Dao and achieve immortality
Ascend directly to the summit of Empty Peaks,
Receive their titles, and soar into the void."*

It further states: "In the Heaven of Imperial Gourds, there is the Mountain of Golden Flowers, where the Five Thearchs’ palaces stand. Five-colored clouds perpetually arise, with the sun and moon flanking its sides, and flying immortals as its winged chariots."

The *Scriptures of Numinous Treasure* say: "The Supreme Dao Lord, on the Floating Mound of Yucha Mountain in the Western Heaven, sits beneath the seven-jeweled canopy of flowering trees..." The Dao Lord then plucks the cloud-zither of the radiant dragon, its transcendent tones cascading in boundless resonance. The myriad heavens stir, purple canopies revolve in mystery, and the four assemblies of the luminous void gather. The eight paths blaze with brilliance.

The *Supreme Treasure Instructions* state:
*"The subtle gate of the Mysterious Origin,
Resplendent and luminous, pervades the vastness.
The supreme Dao arises from stillness and silence—
Therein you shall behold the Three Pristine Palaces."*

It further cites the *Laozi’s Scripture of Dao and Virtue*: "That which is seen yet formless is called *Yi*; heard yet soundless, *Xi*; grasped yet intangible, *Wei*—these are the titles of the Three Primal Lords." It continues: "These three cannot be exhaustively questioned, thus they merge into the One. The Three Pristine unite as the Primal One Lord, the Primordial Father of the Three Honored Ones and the Mysterious Mother." Whoever reads this scripture, if two venerable lords witness it, shall attain the immortal Dao—here the Dao is complete.

The text further says:
*"The Great Simplicity originally has no substance,
The sages call it the Mysterious.
Two principles arise from beginning and end,
All things reach the abyssal spring."*

It also states: "On Kunlun Mountain, the many immortals often manifest in the Central Realm. The nine heavens resound with their recitations, vast and far-reaching, their pure tones crystalline and clear. Those who hear them are enraptured, forgetting all worldly passions. When the assembly of immortals gathers, they sing of the cavernous mystery in unison. Their new melodies ring out, ethereal and distant, echoing endlessly..."

The text further states:

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin, seated upon the Azure Mist in the Great Fuli realm of the Azure Vault, rests where the earth is all of azure jade. The steps and pathways on all sides are adorned with gold and silver treasures, wondrous and manifold.

It also says: In the Crimson Radiance realm of the Chanli world, at the Southern Garden’s Cinnabar Terrace, within the Three Origin Cavern Chambers, the Heavenly Venerable sits upon the crimson clouds. The Perfected Celestial Spirits and the Great Cinnabar Jade Maidens gather together at the Cinnabar Terrace, where the land perpetually emanates crimson qi, resembling the hue of crimson clouds.

The method of Guarding the One requires one to eat sparingly, abstain from pork, fish, and pungent foods, and adjust one’s diet to the warmth or coolness of the four seasons without defying their nature.

In the practice of Guarding the One, one must never drink turbid wine. Turbid wine harms the essence, depletes the five viscera’s generative qi, impedes the flow of essence and qi, and obstructs the blood and vessels.

The *Scripture of the Purple Lord of the Supreme Sovereign* states: The Divine Continent lies north of the Celestial Pass, where the sun and moon revolve in their courses. To its south, the Seven Stars wheel within its bounds.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Purity* says: Contemplate the Three Origins within the Mud-Pill Palace, guard the Nine Perfected within the bodily abode. Exhale and inhale the Five Radiances, breathe the Jade Fluid. At dawn and dusk, seek transcendence in the Cavernous Void; in sleep and repose, commune with spirits in the Great Desert.

It further states: Those who uphold this shall ascend the Three Mornings and wander the Grand Empyrean.

It also says: The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* is the wondrous esoteric teaching of the Nine Heavens, the foremost scripture of the Golden Writ of the Supreme Origin Lord of the Grand Clarity. Formerly, the Central Yellow Elder Lord concealed this text, and its mysteries were known only to the Grand Mystery. Only in the Golden Tower of the Grand Mystery were there golden tablets and jade slips with purple inscriptions. Whoever reads this chapter ten thousand times shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight, ascend to the Supreme Purity, receive the scripture in the Grand Ultimate, and be appointed as a High Minister of the Lofty Ones. Yet if one possesses this scripture but does not read it, the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity shall strike one’s name from the Register of Death, inscribe the true record, and transfer it to the Grand Ultimate. One’s name shall be engraved in the Eastern Florescence, reported to the Supreme Venerable, and recorded in the Tortoise Terrace. The myriad spirits and thousand gods shall then address the adept as the Grand Master of the Nine Mysteries, with a rank equivalent to the Immortal Earl of the Grand Clarity.

The *Scripture of the Concealed Mystery of the Five Mornings’ Golden Flower and Jade Essence* states: The *Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother’s Wandering Intervals* says: May the Mysterious Mother be born with me amidst the generative qi, abide with me between the sun and moon, protect me within the Nine Heavens, dwell with me in the realm of spontaneity, drink with me from the Gourd River, rest with me in the Jade Perfection, sleep with me in the Immortal Hall, and wander with me among the Three Mysteries.

It further says: The Twelve Supreme Vows of the Nine Heavenly Lords, the Eight Divine Intervals of the Nine Numinous Mysterious Mother, the Great Returning Origin and Five Penetrations—calm the secret chamber, disperse incense and stove smoke, and recite the *Scripture of the Golden Flower of the Great Cavern*.

The *Inner Scripture of the Foremost Cavern Chamber* states: Kunlun stands lofty and unshaken, the abode of divine immortals. Its golden halls and jade cities, the convergence and divergence of the Nine Qi, the misty clouds and rain, the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal—all are of the most refined essence. Above, it pierces the distant mists; below, it illuminates the Nine Numinous. To the left, it connects with the Azure Palace; to the right, it flanks the Luminous Clarity. The Golden Terrace of the Eight Simplicities transforms myriad forms; the Jade Elixir settles its fluid, and the nectar of jasper arises spontaneously. The Six Harmonies’ secluded portals, the Eight Pavilions’ assembly of scriptures—within them dwells the Supreme Perfected, whose name cannot be uttered. Subtle and wondrous beyond measure, it is called the Peerless.

It also says: Formerly, Li Zhong of Chang’an understood neither other teachings nor the practice of the Great Cinnabar or the methods of the Three Origins. He only obtained this hidden method of the morning audience and guarded its practice for thirty years. Thereupon, he rode the clouds and ascended in a whirlwind to the Dark Continent.

The immortals Wang Lübing, Zhao Shuangcheng, Fan Shuyou, Guan Pinghe, Li Mingxian, An Shengzhi, and others all attained this Dao and ascended to the chambers of Kunlun, or dwelled in the Three Mystery Palace of the Dark Continent.

It further says: The Supreme Simplicity Three Origin Lords are a single Perfected Woman. She wears a floating-cloud brocade mantle of purple qi, a nine-colored dragon-feathered skirt, and a feathered crown of precious langgan adorned with morning rays. At her waist hang flowing golden fire-bells, tiger tallies, and dragon scripts. She sits in the void, and beneath her knees ever rise three clouds of cinnabar, green, and azure, luxuriantly crowning her form.

The Supreme Simplicity Three Origin Lord often chants:
*"The Grand Origin connects to the Jade Clarity,
The Three Caverns shine with lofty brilliance.
The Eight Effulgences revolve the morning winds,
Scattering clouds and misting the flying numina.
The circular wheel hurls through the empty cavern,
Golden reflections crown the celestial essence.
Jade radiance binds the Five Elders,
Purple mists gleam upon the auroral chariot.
Riding the qi, I sway the mysterious chamber,
My golden form illumines the Nine Auroras."*
This is the hymn of the Upper Palace of the Jade Clarity.

The *Scripture of the Jade Dawn Luminous Mirror* states: The White Simplicity Right Origin Lord is the mother of the White Origin Cavern Yang Lord and the child of the Supreme Simplicity Three Origin Lords. Her name is Stimulating Brightness, her cognomen is Upper Golden Gate. From her mouth, she constantly exhales white qi, called the Jade Dawn White Treasure’s Generative-Soul Qi, which suffuses my body and renders one an immortal, deathless.

The Yellow Simplicity Central Origin Lord is the mother of the Central Yellow Elder Lord and the child of the Supreme Simplicity Three Lords. Her name is Round Flower Yellow Blade, her cognomen is Supreme Great Flourishing, and her title is Yellow Simplicity Lofty Origin Lord. She possesses a body of yellow gold and exhales yellow qi from her mouth, called the Jade Dawn Yellow Treasure’s Great Numinous Generative Qi of the Five Viscera, which suffuses my body and enables one to ascend as a flying immortal to heaven.

The Purple Simplicity Left Origin Lord is the mother of the Primordial Simplicity Lord and the child of the Supreme Simplicity Three Origin Lords. Her name is Concealing Transmission of the Nameless Blade, her cognomen is Upper Peaceful Advent. Her divine mirror surveys the eight directions, and her countenance is that of a young child. From her mouth, she exhales purple qi, called the Jade Dawn Purple Treasure’s Life-Embryo Flowing-Aurora Radiance, which suffuses my body and enables one to ascend at dawn to the Upper Palace of the Jade Clarity.

This is an excerpted passage; the full text is contained in the original scripture.

Moreover, it is said: Behind the necks of the Three Simplicity Origin Lords, each bears a precious radiance. Their solar qi displays nine colors, and their circular luminosity shines resplendently within the Golden Flower Grotto-Chamber, illuminating the entire room. The Three Simplicity Origin Lords each exhale qi as described above, and the three qi converge, intertwining and coalescing to form a sun-like image, nine inches in diameter, within the Golden Flower Grotto-Chamber.

It is further said: The Supreme Jade Dawn’s Nine Subtleties guide the mist, the Five Elders scatter their radiance, the Eight Numinous Gates give birth, the Three Simplicity Precious Qi, the Supreme Mystery Jade Dawn, the Golden Flower Feminine One—within it lies the Purple Origin. The seven and nine merge and transform, ascending through the clouds, the threefold ascent of the three qi, entering emptiness and issuing forth cinnabar. Constantly accompanying the Purple Simplicity, they together rank among the Jade Immortals.

The *Scripture of the Feminine One of the Great Cavern, the Five Elder Thearchs of the Supreme Ultimate, and the Five Viscera’s Life-Securing* states: The Supreme Ultimate Golden Flower Perfected Person inscribed this scriptural text upon the eastern wall of the Jade Numinous Palace in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Heavenly Thearch. The text reads: The five qi arise from different directions, their effulgences merging with form. Some end in death, some begin in life. The myriad kinds return to their root, the thousand threads converge in darkness. Qi drifts like floating mist, blood rushes like flowing clarity. Alas, the portents of the body!

Thereafter, it is recorded in the cinnabar methods and ingestion formulas. The Southern Marchmount Perfected Person also said: Among my disciples who entered the chamber, there was the immortal Zhao Chengzi. When he first received my *Scripture of the Five Viscera’s Life-Securing*, he practiced it accordingly. Later, Chengzi wished to reenter the Great Yin to seek transformation of his appearance and form. He feigned death in the dark hills of Shanggu in Youzhou, beneath a stone chamber. Five years after his death, a mountain traveler saw his white bones in the chamber, his exposed skeleton lying in the dim room. Yet his five viscera remained intact within his abdomen, unrotted as before, their five-colored blossoms gleaming within. The mountain traveler sighed and said: "Of old, I heard that the five viscera could be nurtured to achieve imperishability. Now I behold one whose white bones bear blossoms within his chest—this man must have possessed the Dao but did not complete it, or perhaps failed some intermediate trial."

Thereupon, he reached out and parted the remains, seeing within the five viscera a white stone each, securing the five-colored blossoms in their proper places. The traveler said: "That your five viscera remain imperishable must be due to these five stones that generate the blossoms. You have already perished in the Dao; let me join you." He then took and swallowed them. Four or five years later, when Chengzi’s corpse was due to revive, the traveler, having already ingested the stones, found that on the morning of Chengzi’s revival, the five stones flew from his mouth like cicadas, accompanied by faint thunder. The five-colored brilliance pierced the sun as they returned directly to the viscera of the dead man. Thereby, Chengzi transformed his appearance and arose, as if from a single night’s drunken slumber. The traveler, his mind seized with terror and confusion, fell gravely ill. He entered the mountains to seek the place where the corpse had lain. Arriving before the stone chamber, he saw Chengzi reclining and whistling in the grotto. His face bore a jadelike glow, and he asked: "Who are you?"

Suddenly, five Elder Immortal Lords appeared, wearing brocade sashes and talismans, holding feathered tablets, their heads crowned with purple coronets. They addressed Chengzi, saying: "This is the man who stole and swallowed your five visceral treasure-stones." As soon as they spoke, the traveler’s face erupted with malignant sores, and he was struck dumb. By the time he returned home, the leprous ulcers had spread over his entire body. His entire household, young and old, died simultaneously, and his clan was thus extinguished.

It is also said that those who regularly ingest the essences of the sun and moon should frequently eat bamboo shoots. Bamboo shoots are the embryo of the sun’s radiance, also called Great Brilliance. They should also frequently eat the flesh of swans, which are the feathered birds of the moon’s embryo, also called Moon Herons. To ingest the sun and moon, one should consume these things, for their qi resonates and communicates.

The Perfected Person of the Great Void said: "Swan" is the general name for the feathered tribes. Magpies, geese, swans, and crows are all called "swan-herons." An ancient song says:
*"Swan-herons of a thousand years,
As viands they summon celestial perfected ones.
The Five Thearchs hold moon’s radiance in their beaks,
Seated in rows as guests in the empty sky."*
This is an ancient fisherman’s song.

The *Scripture of the Jade Dawn’s Luminous Mirror* says: Further, visualize the names of the five spirits, each seated securely in its palace. The five spirits all exhale purple qi, which coils around my body until inner and outer merge in darkness, and hands and feet are no longer visible.

Also visualize the sun and moon emerging from my cheeks—sun on the left, moon on the right—with their twofold radiance penetrating and illuminating. Thereupon, the purple qi suddenly clears. Gradually visualize the sun ascending and entering my mouth, which then consumes it, tasting like maltose. Swallow nine times and stop.

Also visualize the moon entering my navel, directly above the Gate of Destiny, its light descending to illuminate the Yin Chamber. Then visualize my hand grasping the handle of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars, wearing it as I walk. Enter the Purple Chamber within the Supreme Tenuity, and behold the Thearch, who says: "You have attained divine transcendence. I bestow upon you the Azure Jade Talisman, inscribed upon the heavens of the Nine Realms."

*"Within the coiled ninefold mystery,
Rising and sitting upon the clouds’ radiance,
The five talismans are entrusted to the Thearch’s son,
Who ascends and returns to the Flowering Infant."*

It further says:
*"The three and five oppose each other,
Heaven covers, earth begins.
I possess the five talismans,
Which ascend to the Thearch’s son.
The Three Non-abiding remain long,
Within the Chamber of the Celestial Camp."*
The above is from the *Scripture of the Five Elders and the Feminine One*.

The *Inner Chapters of the Mysterious Wondrous* says: The Supreme Lord said: The original Dao fundamentally arises from the Non-prior. It is the ancestor of the myriad qi, the origin of the myriad ways. Above the Void and Nothing, prior to Non-being, without form or image, neither existent nor non-existent, it is honored as having nothing above it, its nobility beyond compare.

The *Scripture of the Jade Dawn’s Luminous Mirror* says: The Scripture of the Cavern Realms of the Supreme One Thearch’s method for visualizing the five spirits also involves visualizing the spirits of the Supreme One, the Non-Brave, the White Prime, the Controller of Destiny, and the Peach Lord—altogether five female spirits—and nine male spirits, named the Three, Five, Nine, and Seven. When ascending to the Gate of Mystery, their forms and appearances all resemble those of newborn infants. The five females and nine males each exhale white qi from their mouths, mutually suffusing the practitioner’s body. Thereupon, the five females and nine males merge with the practitioner’s single body, blending into one. They become a single white qi, round in shape, resembling the sun’s radiant orb. In an instant, the round luminosity of the white qi transforms into two small children, one male and one female, both resembling newborn infants. The male is called the Perfected of the Nine Origins, the female is titled the Soul of the August One. The male is named Restraining Control, styled Three Yang; the female is named Ascending Return, styled Thearch’s Son.

In an instant, visualize the boy Restraining Control and the girl Ascending Return standing together within the sun and moon—the boy within the sun, the girl within the moon. The sun and moon hang in the august heavens, the sun in the east, the moon in the west. At that moment, one suddenly perceives one’s entire body as having transformed into the aforementioned white *qi*.

Then, visualize hearing the boy Restraining Control within the sun chanting:
*"Restraining Control, Three Yang,
Perfected of the Nine Origins—
such is my title.
The sun binds my form,
my tally inscribed in Jade Clarity,
kindred to heaven.
Merging yin and yang,
immortals entwine in ecstasy."*

Next, visualize hearing the girl Ascending Return within the moon chanting:
*"Ascending Return, Thearch’s Son,
Soul of the August One—
such is my title.
The moon binds my essence,
master of the tally’s register,
already within Great Brilliance.
Kindred to the Mysterious,
life spans ten thousand myriad ages.
Merging yin and yang,
naked in radiant splendor."*

The *Inner Transmission of Emperor Wu of Han* states: The Queen Mother of the West bestowed upon the Emperor the *Illuminated Scripture of the Five Marchmounts’ True Forms*, while the Lady of the Supreme Prime granted him the *Twelve Methods of the Six Jia Spirit-Flight Summoning the Perfected*, and so forth. There were also the arts of "treading the void and pacing the Mysterious," along with various essential and wondrous incantations. The Emperor personally compiled these into a single scroll, together with all the teachings he had received. These were all presented upon a table of yellow gold, sealed in a casket of white jade, placed upon a bed of coral, and encased in a purple brocade sack. They were stored in the □ Liang Terrace, where he would daily pay homage, burning incense and sweeping the grounds. Later, the Emperor’s intentions strayed, and he failed to uphold the utmost precepts, disregarding the Queen Mother’s words in every matter. Thus, the Queen Mother never returned. In the era of Great Beginning, without year, a celestial fire burned the □ Liang Terrace, and the twelve received teachings were lost in the flames.

The *Scripture of Transforming Form, Concealing Radiance, Ascending, and Preserving Immortality* states: Visualize the Nine Dawn Lords and their hidden consorts, the Nine Yin Inner Names—their forms, colors, and attire—all made luminously manifest as they descend from the Northern Dipper. Their blazing radiance suffuses the void, resplendent and boundless, turning the spirit to reflect the Mysterious, entering my body. The Nine Dawn Lords are the essences of the nine stars.

The *Scripture of Purple Ascension and Blazing Radiance* speaks of the same.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Lady of South Marchmount said that the *Scripture of Treasuring the Spirit* was a text from the brocade pouch of Pei Qingling, which her attendants always carried. Pei had once received this scripture from the Lady of Purple Tenuity, and I also possess a copy transcribed in the Western Palace’s definitive edition.

When asked about the location of the Western Palace, she replied: It is the terrace above the Western Jade of the Northern Altar of the Mysterious Garden. All the celestial treasures and sacred writings are stored therein.

Pei the Perfected also said that these texts align entirely with the essentials of the *Hidden Perfected*, and may be employed immediately. Another name for them is the *Seven Hidden Mysterious Writings*.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: On the night of the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, the Lady of Purple Tenuity, Queen Wang, descended and came to earth, whereupon she was asked about the clouds of true numina. Humbly seeking instruction in these obscure matters, she was bidden to sit again. Then, □ commanded the writing of this response:

*"To drift upon the empty and mysterious,
no path can be traced.
Words uttered in the void,
nothing to grasp.
Thus, unbound by the primal stream,
one surrenders to the wind’s oar.
Abiding in the empty boat,
one travels—
hence, the emptiness within the real,
the formlessness within being.
As for the manifestation of written traces,
they are merely brushed upon paper and bamboo..."*

Mortal remains, though exposed, may yet advance or retreat with the world, yet above they tarnish the odes of transcendent recluses, and below they breach the prohibitions of separation. Such is not the conduct of our kind, nor is it permitted by the numinous laws. Pray, let me explain the origins of writing.

Once creation had begun, the five colors first sprouted, and the patterns of literature were fully established. With the differentiation of peoples and the separation of yin and yang, there arose the *Scriptures of the Three Origins and Eight Meetings*, the *Flying Writings of the Myriad Directions*, and the *Luminous Chapters of the Eight Dragons’ Numinous Seal-Script*. Later, in the age of the Three Sovereigns, the *Eight Meetings* were expanded into the *Dragon and Phoenix Chapters*, the traces of *Cloud-Simplified Seal-Script* were refined into *Brahmā Writing of Conforming Forms*. Divided and broken, the true was corrupted for the sake of ease, branches were matched to roots, and thus arose the sixty-four kinds of writing. These were then disseminated throughout the thirty-six heavens and the ten directions above and below.

Upon examination, the *Eight Meetings* are the most authentic of writings, the ancestors of literary composition. Today, the *Scriptures of the Three Origins and Eight Meetings* are used by the Jade Thearch, the Supreme Ultimate, and the various perfected immortals. The *Luminous Chapters of Cloud Seal-Script* are the characters seen in the talismanic writings of gods and spirits.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Lady of South Marchmount told her disciples that on the morrow she would journey to the Pure Void Palace on Mount Wangwu, so that they might know her destination.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity sat for a long while without speaking. In her hand, she first held three dates—hued like dried dates but elongated in shape, without pits, and tasting not of dates but somewhat like pears. She first gave one to [the disciple], then gave one to the Lady of Purple Tenuity, keeping one for herself. After all had eaten, the Perfected Consort asked about Nian Deng’s age, and so forth.

The Perfected Consort further said: "Your teacher, the Lady of South Marchmount, wields authority as Controller of Destinies. Her Dao is lofty and wondrously complete—truly the ancestral font of virtuous power."

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: On the night of the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, eight perfected beings descended: the Lady of the Left of Purple Tenuity, the Perfected Consort of the Nine Flowers of the Supreme Palace, the Controller of Destinies and Lady of South Marchmount, the Perfected Lord of Purple Yang, the Perfected Lord of Pure Numen, the Lord of the Central Mao, and the Lesser Lord of the Mao. There was also a spirit, youthful and well-composed, wearing a lotus crown and a vermilion robe, girded with a sword, whom I had never seen before. I secretly suspected him to be Wang Ziqiao, the Perfected of Tong□ Mountain. Much was discussed regarding matters of Mount Jinting, though many things were incomprehensible. Gongxuan is the Perfected Consort of the Nine Flowers of Purple Tenuity—all bowed in reverence.

The Perfected of the Upper Offices said: "Yesterday, I went with Shu Shen to the Palace of Pure Vacuity to examine the successes and failures of those who have attained true transcendence. Recently, forty-seven were abruptly removed, and only three were restored to the registers. We also reviewed the name-slips of your cohort—now things are well. Xu [so-and-so] is included among the *bozha*, and Xu [so-and-so] is the name of the Chief Scribe.

The fruit of the rosy clouds is the essence of the sun, and the rosy clouds are the radiance of the sun. Though you have heard of the method of ingesting the sun’s fruit, you have not yet known the art of consuming the rosy clouds’ essence. The scriptures on consuming rosy clouds are most secret, yet the way to summon them is quite simple—this is the method of embodying jade-light and reflecting the rosy clouds of the Upper Clarity.

The eyes are the body’s mirrors, and the ears are the body’s windows. Too much seeing dims the mirror, and too much hearing darkens the windows. I possess the whetstone to polish mirrors and the technique to unseal windows—with these, you may penetrate the myriad spirits and perceive the faintest echoes. Is this acceptable?"

The *Zhen’gao* states: "The Wilds of Lang are the precincts of Langfeng. Atop Kunlun lie the Nine Offices, which are the Nine Palaces, with the Great Ultimate as the Grand Palace. All immortals are merely the functionaries of the Nine Palaces, while the Perfected are the dukes and ministers of the Nine Palaces.

The offices of transcendents have ranks, each with its proper order. There are left and right bureaus of transcendents, with left and right dukes, left and right ministers, left and right grand masters, and left and right censors. Those who master the Great Cavern are the ministers of transcendents; those who ingest golden elixirs are the grand masters; those who consume magic mushrooms are the censors. If one obtains and consumes the Hidden Mushroom of the Great Ultimate, one becomes the Left Duke of Transcendents and a Perfected.

The Perfected said: "People follow worldly customs in seeking vain reputations—it is like burning incense: though many smell its fragrance, they do not know that the smoke, once its flame is spent, disperses and vanishes. When fame is established, the person perishes. Thus, the lofty withdraw and remain in purity."

They also said: "It is like racing an ice-chariot across the fiery lands of the south or sailing a fire-boat upon drowning waters. Without true rectitude, failure is certain in ten thousand cases out of ten thousand."

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Zhang Jiangzi and others were initially ranked in the second grade, having only just entered the Palace of Easy Transitions. The Palace of Easy Transitions and the Youthful Prime Palace are the halls and chambers of the Dao of man and woman. Within them, all is serene and tranquil. The Azure Lord of the Eastern Sea visits twice a year, inspecting these palaces and observing the assembled multitudes.

Zhao Sutai has dwelled in the Palace of Easy Transitions for four hundred years and refuses to move, declaring that nowhere in the world brings greater joy than this place. Sutai was the daughter of Zhao Xi, who served as Inspector of Youzhou during the Han. Xi aided the destitute in the Yellow River, rescued Yu Hui and others from the execution of their clans, and performed countless acts of hidden virtue. Thus, he himself attained the Vermilion Mound, and his descendants now dwell in the Grotto-Heavens. Xi frequently enters and exits the Palace of the Register of Destinies.

Among those in the Palace of Easy Transitions who have attained lofty merit yet remain in quiet obscurity are Dou Qiongying, Han Taihua, Liu Chunlong, Wang Jinxian, Li Xizi, and Guo Shuxiang. These individuals possess natures of dense elegance, their aspirations pure and distant, their talents surpassing all comparison, their bearing awe-inspiring to the multitude. They are the most exalted among the stewards, the most capable among the transcendents’ officials. Those of the next rank include Zhang Jiangzi and her peers. Deng Boniao’s mother performed many virtuous deeds, and thus later arrivals often seek her patronage and protection.

Dou Qiongying was the younger sister of Dou Wu. Her seventh-generation ancestor, a man named Zhi, made it his life’s work to gather dry bones and restore the dead to life. Thus, his blessings extended to Qiongying’s own lifetime.

Han Taihua was the younger sister of Han Anguo and the wife of Li Guangli, the Han general of the Second Campaign against Dayuan. Guangli had accumulated merit and virtue in past lives, and he now resides in the palace undergoing transformation.

Liu Chunlong was the daughter of Liu Fengxian, the Han Minister of the Imperial Clan.

Li Xizi was the grandmother of Li Zhong, who served as Grand Administrator of Dongping during the Jin. Zhong’s grandfather (and others) performed many acts of hidden virtue. Once, during a great snowstorm, he scattered grain in the garden courtyard, fearing the birds would starve. Such was the depth of his compassion.

Wang Jinxian was the daughter of Wang Yan.

[Her] affairs were overseen by Attendant Xu.

Guo Shuxiang was the mother of Wang Xiu. Wang Xiu, styled Shuzhi, was a native of Beihai. During the Wei, he served as Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary to the Martial Emperor. At the age of seven, he lost his mother, who passed away on the day of the She Festival. It was not known to whom among the Guos she belonged.

In his youth, the prefectural office had Wang Shaodao, Fan Shusheng, and Li Boshan, all paragons of the prefectural office in their youth.

The *True Records* states: Lang Zong, styled Zhongsui, was a native of Anqiu in Beihai. In his early years, he served as Magistrate of Wu County. His studies delved deeply into the Daoist arts, and he was skilled in divining the winds and qi. One day, a sudden gale swept through his window. Upon divination, he knew that a great fire would burn the Great Xia Gate in the capital. He sent someone to verify, and indeed, it was so. When the various lords heard of this, they summoned Zong as a Academician. Ashamed to be summoned for his divination skills, he removed his official seal and sash by night, shouldered his satchel, and fled. He dwelled beneath Mount Hua, ingested sesame pills, and attained the Dao. He now resides within the grotto.

There was also Zhu [missing character], a native of Chenliu. He was a man without the Way, devoted solely to robbery and banditry. Later, when his crimes were discovered, he fled far away to another region. Arriving at Mount Shaoshi in Runan, he encountered Master Feng, who lived in reclusion and studied the Dao. After three years, he was transmitted the true Dao. Remaining on the mountain to ingest herbs and cultivate the Way for thirty-eight years, he later entered Mount Dongkeng. At the age of one hundred and forty-seven, immortals descended and led him into the grotto of Mount Dayou, where he became a perfected one.

There was also Guo Jing, a native of Yingchuan. Orphaned in his youth, at the age of sixteen, he was summoned by the county to serve as an official. Later, he committed a minor offense and fled into hiding, remaining secluded for two months. He then encountered Master Zheng. Jing thereafter followed Zheng, serving him for seven years without敢懈怠. He was transmitted the essentials of guiding and pulling, ingested mountain herbs and *fuling*, and attained a lifespan of three hundred years. Later, in Mount Tianwei, Master Red Pine descended and transmitted to the two of them the true Dao. They now reside in the grotto of Mount Dayou as perfected ones.

It further states: Sima Jizhu later entered the stone chamber of the Dayou Palace in Mount Weiyu, where he received from Xiling Zidu the method of "Concealing the Radiance and Transforming the Form with Stone Essence and Golden Light." Zidu was a transcendent maiden of the Great Mystery. Those who, in the same era, now reside in the Dayou chamber include Bao Shuyang of Guangning, Wang Boyang of Taiyuan, Liu Weihui of Yingchuan, and Duan Jizheng of Daijun, all of whom received the Way from their master, Xiling Zidu.

As Jizhu was about to depart, he left behind his form upon the pillow and mat as a likeness to replace himself. His tomb lies south of Mount Shengpan in Chengdu of Shu Commandery. In former times, Marquis Wu of Shu, Zhuge Liang, erected a stele before Jizhu’s tomb to inscribe his virtue. At the end of the stele’s eulogy, it reads:

The profound desert, the great stillness,
Merging yin and yang,
Heaven and earth intermingle,
Myriad beings flourish and manifest.
The master ordered the milfoil,
Distinguishing the soft and hard.
Spirits and gods beheld,
The Six Perfections shone clearly.

Jizhu’s complexion was like that of a young maiden, his beard and sideburns those of the Three Heavens, black as ink.

Let two disciples, one male and one female, each cultivate the Dao. The male is named Ru Yu, and the female is named Ji Hua. Both now reside within Mount Weiyu, where Ji Hua today is reciting the Thirty-Nine Chapters, though she has yet to complete them.

The *Preface to the Formulae of Master Pei* states: Master Pei, styled Xuanren, was dignified and unadorned in his youthful appearance. His eyes shone with a luminous essence, his arms hung past his knees, and his voice was resonant and clear, ringing like a struck bell.

The *True Reports* says: The trees of fire-jujubes and intersecting pears grow within your heart. Yet now, thorns and brambles are tangled among them, which is why the two trees remain unseen. I wonder if one might prune the brambles to reveal the trees—these trees grow alone, and how fine they would be!

The *Hidden Formulae for Ascending Perfection* states: Within the Purple Prime of the Grand Tenuity dwell twenty-four inner spirits, born of generative qi and transformed into numinous beings. They govern the essence of transcendence. Those who cultivate and invoke their names will govern and guard the primordial essence of the body. The Purple Void unites with the mysterious origin of conjoined qi, forming the vessel of embodied spirit. They guide clouds and mist, gird themselves with the true smoke of life, and each may summon jade chariots and dragon-riders, arrayed in ranks of thousands. Together, they ascend as one, mounting the dawn in broad daylight. This is the Way of the Great Perfected, who ride the whirlwind and vanish in an instant. After eighteen years of practice, the Most High commanded the Lord of the Grand Tenuity and Blended Numinosity to dispatch the twenty-four perfected ones. With a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, they galloped upon the wind and trod the clouds, inhaling and exhaling to ascend in flowing ascent, entering the celestial registers in broad daylight.

According to the *Scripture of the Three Ones*: Within the Grand Tenuity dwell twenty-four qi, and within each qi resides a perfected one, all ministers of the Thearchs. Through them, the Dao achieves its manifold transformations.

Once one has attained the Three Ones within the body, the Three Ones of the Grand Tenuity—the Lords of the Thearchs—will descend and manifest externally, speaking with you. They come and go from the Supreme Clarity, resting within the Grand Tenuity. As this text states, by guarding the Three Sections within the body, one may also summon those twenty-four perfected ones, who will arrive with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders to welcome you.

The dragon on the left of the sun is named Whirlwind Essence, and the dragon on the right is named Vanishing Pavilion. Visualize the two dragons exhaling white mist, and not only will your own spirit-perfected ones ascend the mysterious heavens.

The *Inner Biography of Lord Ge the Immortal* records: My uncle, Xiaoxian, said, “You have transcended worldly tastes, forsaken splendor for the Dao, and aspired to immortality—this is the noble pursuit of the loftiest perfected ones.”

The *Jade Grove Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Courts* is now complete.
