**The Supreme Orthodox Unity Scripture for Resolving the Five-Tone Curses and Secret Registers**

A devout Daoist disciple of [such-and-such] village and origin, [so-and-so], humbly declares: Born on the [such-and-such] year, month, day, and hour, under the celestial governance of the [such-and-such] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper, I today respectfully present ritual offerings and prostrate myself to reverently approach the gate of the Heavenly Master of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, successor of the Han, to receive the *Supreme Register for Resolving the Five-Tone Curses* of the first rank. This register dissolves curses, dispels malevolent influences, averts calamities, transcends misfortune, prolongs life, and ensures longevity. I vow to receive and uphold it with devotion, ensuring its efficacy and adherence. Should I violate its precepts, I shall suffer harm as decreed by the Mysterious Code and divine ordinances.

- **Eastern Region:** The Nine Yi tribes, governed by the Lords of Jia and Yi, command 9,000 troops to reverse and resolve the curses of the three spring months.
- **Southern Region:** The Eight Man tribes, governed by the Lords of Bing and Ding, command 3,000 troops to reverse and resolve the curses of the three summer months.
- **Western Region:** The Six Rong tribes, governed by the Lords of Geng and Xin, command 7,000 troops to reverse and resolve the curses of the three autumn months.
- **Northern Region:** The Five Di tribes, governed by the Lords of Ren and Gui, command 5,000 troops to reverse and resolve the curses of the three winter months.
- **Central Region:** The Three Qin tribes, governed by the Lords of Wu and Ji, command 12,000 troops to reverse and resolve the curses of the four seasonal months.

Should this disciple be afflicted by evil persons who draw my likeness, stab my heart with blades, or invoke curses at roadside shrines, altars, prisons, mountain forests, streams, wells, or hearths; or if cursed by the River Earl, Water Officials, heretical masters, or any spirits in profane places—wherever curses of a hundred kinds arise to bring harm—I now summon the million-strong hosts of the Supreme Prime soldiers, along with the hundred thousand troops of the Reversing Lords, to descend as one. Together, they shall dissolve all curses, release the bound souls, and forbid their detention. May the spirit and qi be harmonized, disasters dispelled, and misfortune eradicated. *Hasten as the law commands!*

**The above talismans and cinnabar inscriptions are recorded herein.**

The Orthodox Unity Perfected One states: I observe that in this world, men and women are often afflicted by the malevolent curses of evil persons, who invoke heaven and earth as witnesses, call upon ghosts and spirits, and conjure myriad curses. The hundred oath-bound ghosts seize and bind them, causing distress in movement and rest, restless dreams, strange apparitions, and frequent omens. With no means of resolution, they suffer injury or death—truly a pitiable plight. Thus, I approached the Golden Gates beneath the Supreme Venerable Lord of the Great Clarity in the Heavenly Center, earnestly beseeching the opening of the Purple Yang Palace and the unveiling of the cloud-brocade scripture case. I requested the *Supreme Register for Resolving the Five-Tone Curses*, to transmit it to the virtuous and faithful of the world. Those who receive and wear it shall be freed from such suffering, fulfill their natural lifespan, and forever avoid premature misfortune. You ought to reverently uphold it.

This disciple today presents ritual offerings and respectfully approaches the gate of the Heavenly Master to receive the *Supreme Secret Register for Resolving the Five-Tone Curses* of the first rank. After receiving it, I swear to abide by its covenant. Should I ever violate it, I willingly accept punishment in the netherworld and dare not blame the Dao or fault my master. *As decreed by the Mysterious Code and divine ordinances!*

**Ritual Petition for Receiving the Register**

**Petition for Receiving the *Supreme Orthodox Unity Scripture for Resolving the Five-Tone Curses and Secret Registers*:**

On the [such-and-such] year, under the reign of the [such-and-such] Grand Year-Star, in the [such-and-such] month, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] phase, at the [such-and-such] hour, a devout Daoist disciple of [such-and-such] village and origin, [so-and-so], declares: Born on the [such-and-such] year, month, day, and hour, under the celestial governance of the [such-and-such] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper, I today respectfully present ritual offerings and prostrate myself to reverently approach the gate of the Heavenly Master of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, successor of the Han, to receive the *Supreme Secret Register for Resolving the Five-Tone Curses* of the first rank. I vow to honor and uphold it with devotion.

I reflect that natural disasters and pestilence are common in the mortal world, yet when ghosts blame humans, it is not their true desire. The mundane world calls it "cursing," while Daoist texts name it "enmity and hatred." Though the terms differ, the principle may hold truth. Some endure unrelenting curses, passed down through generations, growing more resentful upon admonishment, impervious to reason. Only the Great Dao, moved by compassion, seeks to right these wrongs. Through flying talismans and registers, it blunts sharp conflicts and resolves entanglements, fostering harmony so that wrathful hearts naturally subside. Those who seek mercy, yet fail to recognize their faults, now bow before the master, beseeching guidance. With utmost sincerity, I present this petition.

At the gate of the Heavenly Master, this disciple presents ritual offerings and humbly declares the desire to receive the *Supreme Secret Register for Resolving the Five-Tone Curses* of the first rank, along with the sacred name of the True Master, to be revered for life. Today, based on this petition, I swear an oath before heaven and earth, pledge to the Three Officials, break the contract, and divide the ring, following the precepts to transmit and bestow the register as follows.

**Register of the First Rank:**
*The Supreme Secret Register for Resolving the Five-Tone Curses*

**Ritual Outline: *Essential Principles of Cultivating Perfection in the Orthodox Unity Tradition***

**Endorsing Master**, the Rightly Responsive Master of the Celestial Master, states:

The *Purple Yang Treasure Admonitions* and the *Cloud Satchel’s* numinous texts dissolve the entanglements of curses and spells, shatter the hidden harms of malevolent schemes. First transmitted by the sacred brush, they are recorded in the arcane scriptures, bestowed upon the world to dispel all manner of calamities. Thus did the Most High establish the teaching, transmitting it as a worldly learning. Through the ages, Perfected Masters have upheld and proclaimed these treasure instructions, drawing forth those of karmic affinity in an unbroken lineage.

By ancestral fortune, I have borne the grace of the state, inheriting the title of the Orthodox Unity Master and reviving the ancestral lineage of Tianmu. Yet as the transmission of the Dharma Registers has grown distant over generations, I have selected skilled artisans to carve wood and produce these books, ensuring their enduring transmission.

As for the precepts to be upheld—compassion, mercy, and the ancient sagely way—none may attain without them. Those who ascend the altar in good faith must purify their profound vision, accumulate merit through virtuous deeds, that their aspirations may be fulfilled and they may transcend the mundane to enter the wondrous.

How luminous is this covenantal record—can one not be vigilant?

**The Celestial Master’s** disciple, **Guangwei Zi**, declares:

For over fifteen hundred years, my family has employed the talismans of the Most High to deliver beings across heaven and earth, safeguarding the nation’s destiny. The ancestral instructions are resplendently clear—what need is there for superfluous praise?

When my Perfected Ancestor first encountered the sagely dynasty’s unification of the realm, he was honored above all. The common folk of Jiangnan, clad in coarse hemp, were all placed under his guidance. Since I inherited the teaching, the imperial courts of three reigns have bestowed their radiant favor. At the ascension of the dragon-throne, I was granted a resplendent title, my solemnity likened to *Xu Jing*, my reverence compared to *Chong He*. Official ranks were conferred following Tang precedent, and enfeoffed lands were expanded within the Liu domain.

To perform good deeds, transmit the Dharma Registers, and thereby continue the ancestral legacy; to pray for blessings and ward off the people’s disasters, reverently upholding the sagely instructions—how could I not exert myself with utmost diligence? In transmitting the Registers and bestowing talismans, the transformative power of the teaching is further illuminated. Above, this serves to exalt the Son of Heaven’s illustrious mandate; below, it bestows upon the common people the supreme felicity of the imperial standard. May my sincerity in this hour bring forth boundless fortune.

**Endorsing Master of the Orthodox Unity Primary Altar**, the Perfected of the Three Caverns’ Sacred Registers of Highest Clarity, **so-and-so**, endorses the faithful devotee **so-and-so**, who has received and vows to wear upon his person the *Most High’s Secret Register for Dissolving the Five-Tone Curses and Spells*. Having already recorded the details at this altar, he respectfully petitions the Orthodox Unity Lineage’s Celestial Master Perfected for transmission, reporting to the Ancestral Celestial Master and Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity in accordance with the ritual statutes. Herewith, a certificate is issued as proof, that he may follow the teaching and uphold it. Should he violate this covenantal oath, he shall incur the judgment of the numinous tribunal.
