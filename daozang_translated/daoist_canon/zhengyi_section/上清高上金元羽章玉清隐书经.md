### *The Scripture of the Golden Prime Feathered Chapters of the Jade Purity Hidden Scripture of the Most High Cavern*

Such are the myriad numinous hidden tones of the *Feathered Chapters Jade Purity Hidden Scripture*, concealed within the Jade Terrace and Jasper Chambers of the Jade Purity Upper Palace by the Most High Jade Emperor. Attending the scripture are the Orchid Court Jade Maidens—An Lǜfàn, Huáng Míngjī, and seven hundred others—along with the Northern Desert Golden Immortals and Jade Lads—Líng Huìcōng, Wáng Dìngyún, and five hundred others—who hold night-shining precious luminants and perpetually scatter the blossoms of the Three Qi’s returning incense to anoint the divine scripture’s supreme essence.

All the Five Emperors, the ten thousand immortals, and the host of sages ascend thrice each month to the Jade Purity Upper Palace to scatter incense, pay homage to the perfected, and offer rites before the divine scripture.

The Great King of the Jade Purity Dispelling Demons of the Northern Terrace’s Golden Mystery Cavern was born amid the primordial kalpa. When the Two Modes divided and the Three Symbols took root, heaven and earth lay veiled in obscurity, dim and profound. He was rightly born in the Northern Desert’s Broad Cold Courtyard, by the banks of the Cold Valley within the Central Plain of Level Mounds. The Primordial was his father, the Mysterious his mother; they wove his form, and with the Three Qi as his name, his taboo is: **__**.

Shedding his purple womb, his six eyes blazed with essence. His body soared ninety million *zhang*, emanating a hundred shifting lights. The Seven Primes intertwined, suffusing his jade form with radiance. The Three Luminants awaited his brilliance, and the sun and moon opened their clarity for him.

Thereupon, the Most High Jade Emperor bestowed upon him the Golden Perfection, Jade Radiance, Purple Script, and Cinnabar Chapters, along with the Jade Seal, Phoenix Casket, and the Banner of Command over Demon Spirits. He was enfeoffed to govern the Nine Mysteries, oversee the Five Peaks, inspect and restrain the Northern Feng, rectify the Three and Five, behead the Six Heavens, and receive his commission in the Upper Palace, his might subduing the myriad spirits.

The Most High assigned seven thousand Jade Maidens of the Jade Terrace and two thousand four hundred Golden Immortals and Jade Lads to scatter blossoms and incense in attendance upon the King. Golden-headed colossal beasts stood guard at the Jade Gates. He ruled the Northern Emperor’s Cold Realm and the Broad Numinous Palace, often riding the Nine-Colored Flowing Bell Flying Chariot with its Purple Canopy, accompanied by a thousand perfected of the Mulberry Grove. Ascending to the Great Void, he roamed the Dark Jade Purity, journeyed east to the Azure Florescence to verify the Square Cauldrons, and traveled west to Tortoise Mountain to register the celestial perfected. In the southern Cavern Yang of the Southern Culmen’s Upper Prime, he excised the dead and inscribed the living, engraving the registers to pacify and prosper. At the center, he paid homage to the Golden Gates of the Most High Jade Capital, receiving his charge from the Boundless and governing the Five Directions. He oversaw life and death in the ledgers, controlled the demonic hordes of the Northern Feng, ruled above the Supreme, and commanded below the Abyssal. The Five Peaks, Four Marshes, Twelve River Sources, and the myriad immortals and numinous hosts—none were not subject to the King.

The Great King of Dispelling Demons rules beneath the Seven-Treasure Palace of the Northern Broad Cold, governing the Northern Fengluo Mountain. This mountain lies in the north, in the *guǐ* region, rising two thousand six hundred *lǐ* with a circumference of thirty thousand *lǐ*. The mountain is entirely adorned with seven-jeweled pearl palaces, all inhabited by ghosts and spirits.

At its base lies a valley ten thousand *zhang* deep, called the Spring of Mound Cold, which is the prison of ghosts and spirits. The Great Demon King of the Northern Emperor resides in the Palace of the Yin-Heaven of Zhòu’s Severed End atop the mountain.

There is a Great Demon King, surnamed Wǎn Gōng, with the taboo **__**, whose official retinue numbers thirty-eight thousand. All their names are subject to the Great King of Dispelling Demons.

Whenever later disciples attain immortality, the Great King of Dispelling Demons commands the Great Demon King to submit their names for approval, after which they may ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Great Demon King constantly seeks to thwart disciples’ studies, resenting their attainment of immortality. Once one achieves immortality, they become a perfected transcendent above the Great Demon King. Thus, disciples are often tested by the Great Demon King, and many fail, defeated by him.

If disciples know the Great Demon King’s secret name and the location of his palace, they will not be subjected to his trials and will naturally receive his endorsement for ascent to the Upper Clarity.

Disciples should regularly recite the incantation of the Hundred Spirits of the Dispelling Demons King to repel the Great Demon’s trials. Once the demonic trials are dispelled, true numina will descend, and one may behold their true form, ascending in broad daylight to the Jade Purity Palace.

The Great Demon King wears a robe of dark script, a crown spanning the heavens, and a belt with a dragon-headed sword. He often rides a feathered chariot, flying through the clouds, and sings a ballad of three thousand words to confuse and corrupt later disciples.

Thus, the Most High recorded its verses in the *Treasure Scripture of Dispelling Demons*. Those who know its tune will not be subjected to trials, nor suffer harm or corruption.

The Great Demon King of the Eastern Azure Emperor is surnamed Pò Luò, with the taboo **__**. He wears a crown spanning the heavens and a robe of azure feathers, with a belt of azure cords and a tiger-headed satchel. Sometimes he dons a crimson unlined garment or transforms into a radiance of azure and vermilion. He commands nine thousand officials and resides in the Eastern Land of Peace, the Age of Nàshàn.

On the day of the vernal equinox, he rides a feathered chariot of azure wheels, flying through the clouds to feast and roam the Five Peaks, testing and corrupting those who study immortality.

**Hidden Text of the Jade Purity Great King for Dispelling Demons and the Golden Numinous Hundred Spirits Incantation**

The Supreme Void is tranquil and at ease; the four qi are solemn and reverent. The Eight Mysteries of the Profound gather; golden chimes resound through the empty sky. Jade wisdom soars through the empyrean; the cavernous subtle stirs the primordial. The four radiant scenes unfold their numen; the six perfections rest in harmony. Through refinement and transformation, they merge and change; stepping upon rosy clouds, they ascend the peaks. In the high assembly of the Jade Purity, the Three Primordials’ Upper Palace, they attend the banquet of the Nine Emperors before the Eight Luminous Cinnabar Windows. The luminous opens the Dao above; the Seven Primordials shine through. The clear waves mirror the distant; essence scatters in the Jade Chamber. The lofty perfected stand in array, luxuriant as flowing light. Golden immortals hold blossoms; pure spirits disperse fragrance. Flying celestial beasts guard the Jade Emperor. The two images rest in the void; the three luminaries veil the dusk. Divine talismans transform myriad times; the Seven Stars intersect in their courses. The Nine Emperors display their canopies, lingering at the cavern’s gate. Towering and lofty is the Supreme Void; majestic and venerable is virtue. The myriad transformations arise in unity; the dark examines the sacred source. A summons is issued to the Five Emperors; the Upper Primordial is invoked. The demon-dispelling majesty transforms; the returning wind and swift thunder sweep away evil and banish demons. Essence is bound, spirits captured; the Emperor Lord receives his mandate. Those guilty are executed; those meritorious are pardoned. Their names are recorded in the Three Heavens; the great deities who preside over this are the Golden Numinous and Jade Wisdom, all as the jade text decrees. In the vast capital of Yùluó, the disciple’s private existence is preserved. The dark canopy commands all; riding the wheel-less void, they are the ancestors of the hundred spirits. The sun’s radiance shifts and changes; the gate of awakened attainment opens the dharma containing light. Through long kalpas, they swiftly depart from the divine. The resplendent chamber and bright guests—all are the demon kings of the Northern Fēng. Their eerie songs and mysterious chants disrupt our cloudy encampment. The immortals check the names and submit them to the Jade Dawn. The commands of the Supreme are all as the Great Perfected decrees.

Then the Five Elders take up their reins, ascending the lofty and resplendent imperial court. Their feathered skirts and jade sleeves ripple, embroidered capes with flowing bells; golden crowns and purple sashes radiate the sun’s essence, their numinous light illuminating the wheel. Eightfold radiance purifies the mysteries; the Five Thearchs flank the imperial carriage, escorting the Four Luminaries. The grotto-heavens gaze in wonder, wondrous scenes forming cloudy encampments. The gates of heaven unseal, the numinous barriers open in clarity. Soaring through the purple empyrean, the eight paths merge into darkness. The Dao’s subtleties stretch far and wide; wandering dreams ascend to the Upper Clarity. The Seven Sages align in harmony, their principles commanding long life. Thrice they circle and five times they turn, delivering the Seven Stars. The Great One attends to his duties, inscribing records in the immortal court. Ascending the Brahma-realm, treading prosperity, the five qi converge, the Ten Perfections firmly arrayed. The cinnabar names are opened and delivered; the Mysterious Mother rejoices. Eternal life is forever preserved. The White Prime and the Peerless, the Solar Assembly and the Yellow Tranquility—all Five Elders unite in accord. Branches flourish in splendor, preserving the Southern Immortals. None fail to be embraced as embryos; the three qi behold the light. Golden immortals bathe in form, decayed corpses soar in flight, ascending to the Three Clarities. The Great One examines demons; the Celestial Origin captures essence. Trials are extinguished, calamities dissolved—no reckless births are permitted. The Six Masters brandish lightning, hurling fire-bells. Their might shakes the eight realms; the ten directions stand in solemn stillness. Dragons soar and phoenixes glide, ascending to pierce the Four Luminaries. Cinnabar texts record their names; golden scriptures of feathered classics. The world safeguards the radiant dragon, its destiny aligned with the immortal court. The Nine Perfected entwine in harmony; the highest vows are fulfilled. Demons are subdued, protections upheld—soaring to ascend the Jade Clarity.

*The Inner Chapter of the Golden Numinous Hundred Spirits for Dispelling Demons*
A treasure of the August Supreme, concealed within the Jasper Palace, bestowed upon the highest sages, not transmitted to lesser immortals. Those with golden names and jade characters, arrayed in vermilion charts, whose viscera bloom with life—only they may receive this text. Practicing ten thousand repetitions, they ride the radiance and mount the clouds, soaring through the Three Clarities, entering and departing the imperial dawn. They open the way for seven generations of ancestors, severing karmic roots, delivering lives to the Southern Palace, preserving the purple embryo within the primordial womb. They gather the Dao of life from the ten directions, command Jade Wisdom in the golden chamber, seek numinous radiance through wondrous resonance, and embrace the eight assemblies within the nine voids. Thus they summon true radiance to descend in curves, beholding the divine countenance of the Jade Emperor. They await the insignia in the Orchid Court, subduing the celestial demons of the Northern Feng. All who practice this Dao shall, on the eight solar terms and their own birthdays and the days of the Great Year Star, recite the scripture and perform the Dao-circuits, treading upon sacred mountains—always facing north. They shall strike the left teeth thirty-two times, reciting the chapter in a hushed voice. With each recitation, the spirit brightens and qi purifies; celestial demons vanish like shadows, and the immortal Dao naturally manifests. Those who recklessly divulge this method shall see their seven generations of ancestors held accountable, their own lives forfeit, and immortality forever denied.

Flying and traversing, they gaze upon the Yin Chamber; sun and moon plant the numinous root. They reckon the revolutions of the Three Images, the Seven Stars shining in their divisions. Heavenly demons fill the Cloud Palace, foul qi swirling in profusion. Winding and restraining, they arise upon the path, called the Great Demon Host.

Bearing heaven and breaking their foreheads, seizing the interval to unleash their might. Chants and songs fly through the void, testing and confounding my heart. They inscribe the name of the Northern Emperor, sealing and shearing without remainder. Divine perfected emerge in excursion, heaven and earth collapse and topple. The demonic hosts submit in surrender, the transcendent all take flight. The profound script is completed in curves, shining together with me. The Primordial Father and Dark Mother, the myriad spirits all return. They stride beyond the Jade Radiance, the body ascends the golden ladder. Drawing forth from the Three Paths, the Seven Mysteries scatter and unfold. Preserving transcendence in the Great Empyrean, blessings and felicity towering and majestic.

*The Jade Clarity Eight Observances High Origin Void Emperor Tranquil Radiance Lord Shan Yuan Cha Bao Lun Fa Heavenly Central Dispelling-Demons Wisdom Incantation Hidden Writ of the Golden Mystery Feathered Chapter*

The Tranquil Radiance Wheel of Dharma Heaven, the Eight Observances illumine the Jade Clarity. Flying blossoms fall and scatter their radiance, returning fragrance flows through the golden court. The rainbow’s glow illumines the Dark Terrace, the Three Emperors unite to open the dawn. Whistling and shrilling they attend the Golden Gate, preserving these kalpas of accumulated lives. The Northern Origin hastens the celestial revolutions, wielding the banner to summon the Five Numinous. They forbid and seal the Northern Feng Palace, feasting and commanding the cloud encampments. The Highest observes the Eight Wastes—from where do the chants and songs arise? Flourishing and nurturing, they drum the vast Dao, proclaiming titles to sprinkle the Eight Darks. The feathered writ seizes the demonic hosts, the Golden Mystery binds the myriad essences. The Demon Kings all receive their tasks, extinguishing trials and dissolving the demonic scriptures. The Dark Mandate responds to the talismanic assembly, the Five Emperors command and it is already pure. The Duke’s Son holds the Five Talismans, the Great One secures my form. The Three Origins display the registers, inscribing the book upon the Eastern Florescence’s jade. The Seven Mysteries all ascend in flight, rejoicing together in the Eight Observances’ court.

The Dispelling-Demons Wisdom Incantation’s Golden Mystery Hidden Writ is all knotted from the soaring dark’s spontaneous qi to complete its chapters, resplendent above the Eight Heavens, flourishing within the Jade Clarity. It controls demons and establishes the perfected, extinguishes trials and summons the transcendent. The golden tones drift and ring in the Purple Void, the jade wisdom vibrates and resounds in the Radiance Court.

Thus the Highest Floating Wheel is employed to rigorously test, the Void Emperor wields the reins to observe the perfected. Assisting the Jade Transcendent in attendance, commanding the Five Elders to restrain the numinous. Above they display the profound and wondrous noble practices, below they exalt the towering and majestic beyond description. Blessings and felicity fill the dark leaves, layered shade flows through the seed bodies. Decayed bones receive its dark reliance, receiving rebirth as embryo transcendent. Lofty and difficult to name, numinous and difficult to proclaim—thus the supreme sages established the chapters, calling them Hidden Writ.

The Eight Heavens’ Void Emperor Lord received it from the Nine Empyreans, transmitting it to the Jade Clarity Jade Emperor Lord Dispelling-Demons Great King. The Great King transmitted it to the Five Emperors’ Highest Perfected Lords, who transmitted it to the Highest Jade Emperor Lord. The Highest Jade Emperor Lord transmitted it to the Supreme Emperor, the Supreme Emperor transmitted it to the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao transmitted it to the Great Tenuity Heaven Emperor Lord, the Great Tenuity Heaven Emperor Lord transmitted it to the Later Sage Nine Mysteries Golden Watchtower Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the High Minister Azure Youth Lord.

These true transmissions, passed from one perfected being to another, are compiled as numinous writs. According to the statutes, only those who have listened for seven thousand years and are destined to attain transcendence may receive them. Without one’s name recorded in the Imperial Register of the Golden List and inscribed in the Upper Clarity, they must not be rashly proclaimed. To lightly divulge this Dao brings calamity upon seven generations of ancestors, and one’s own life is forfeit—be clear and cautious in upholding it.

Should one’s name appear on the Purple Terrace and be deemed worthy of this text, one must establish sincerity in the heart, present as offerings eight taels of gold, eighty bolts of cinnabar brocade, and sixty bolts of purple silk. The master shall perform an eighty-day retreat in response, or twenty-seven days, and transmit the text only after the covenant is sworn. To transmit without covenant and lightly divulge it is to break faith with Heaven, bringing guilt upon seven generations of ancestors, calamity upon descendants, and blindness and deafness to oneself for life, so that one never attains transcendence.

In cultivating this Dao, on each of the eight solar terms, one must recite one chapter according to the term. Furthermore, on one’s own life-day, the first day of the sexagenary cycle, the day of the Great Year Star, and whenever one undertakes a retreat to practice the Dao, one must recite the thirty-nine chapters of the scripture, the *Feminine One’s Five Elders’ Treasure Scripture*, the *Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates and Twelve Supreme Vows*, and all together recite the *Eight Heavens’ Wisdom Mantra* once. When traveling to famous mountains or journeying to the four quarters in search of the Dao of transcendence, one must recite one chapter according to the direction before proceeding. Practiced thus, all trials vanish of themselves, demon kings show reverence and protection, all endeavors succeed, and all undertakings are accomplished. True persons manifest in bodily form, bringing forth natural numinous medicines; the body shines with jade radiance, and the inner chant of transcendence resounds, enabling flight to the Upper Clarity.

**Jade Clarity’s Concealed Writ of the Golden Mystery: The Central Hidden Writ of the Eight Heavens**
Born before the Primordial Beginning, congealed from the qi of the flying mystery to form the jade writ—this is the writ of the Jade Clarity Heaven. Each character spans a zhang, resplendent in the vast firmament, subduing demons and extinguishing spirits, summoning gods and seizing numina. Thus, the supreme sages transmit it to one another, receiving it to wield numinous might. This writ is concealed and not transmitted to the world; without a golden name in the Orchid Terrace or jade characters in the Purple Chamber, one may neither see nor hear of it. Should one obtain this scripture, the exalted will assign twelve jade youths and eight jade maidens to attend the perfected, safeguarding the text’s bearer and correcting lapses of negligence. To lightly divulge it is to consign one’s seven ancestors to punishment in the earth prisons and to subject one’s own body to the Three Offices’ interrogation.

The Master of the Void of Mount Bell received it from the Yellow Venerable Lord. After wearing it for nine years, his inner and outer being became luminously transparent, the concealed writ manifesting of itself. It arrayed within his form, its radiance illuminating the nine palaces, shining upon the ten directions. The original writ he wore flew into the Eight Heavens. In the first year of the Kai-Guang era, on the first day of the first month, he shed his body at Mount Bell, and the concealed writ was transmitted to the Perfected of Profound Spirit, Bao Shixuan. Shixuan was once the attendant of Duke Mu of Qin and is now titled the Perfected of Profound Absoluteness, dwelling in the grotto chambers of Mount Jiuyi.

The Ninefold Mystery Golden Portal Emperor of the Later Sages descended to become the teacher of the Zhou, changing his title to Laozi. He transmitted the Concealed Writ of the Eight Heavens to King You. King You, deeming himself to dwell in the course of natural destiny, to succeed the qi of the Five Emperors, and to regulate the transformations of yin and yang, did not revere the celestial writ. Laozi, knowing the decline of the Zhou’s culture, retrieved the writ and departed, crossing west of the Zhou. There, he established teachings and transformations, encountering the Pass Prefect Yin Xi. Xi’s heart was bound by purple cords, his face bore a circular luminance, his neck bore the Mandate of Heaven, his back carried the Seven Primordials, his golden name was inscribed upon the Mystery Chart, and his cinnabar tally was tied to the Purple Chamber. His qi aligned with the Grand Tenuity, and his form merged with the perfected. Thus, he expounded the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* in two chapters.

In the land of Lǜnà, Laozi opened his mouth, and the concealed writ emerged from it to be transmitted to Xi. Xi, adhering to the covenant, received it and thereby summoned the cloud chariot of the Eight Effulgences, roaming freely through the eight directions. He ascended into the void, his neck radiating the light of precious luminosity, his seventy-two marks illuminating his form. Following the course of transformation, he ascended into the Eight Heavens. His Dao is lofty and wondrous, beyond all description.

For all later learners who do not obtain this writ, it is fitting to cease yearning for distant visions and to spare their spirit the weariness of secluded mountains.

The Grand Minister Supreme Youth transmitted this writ to the Perfected King of the Western City, who ascended to the rank of Perfected of the Four Culmens. Now, one copy is sealed within the Western City Mountain.

Should one possess a name inscribed in gold and characters writ in purple, then in the years of gengzi, renyin, gengwu, or wuyu, on the eighth day of the fourth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, or the first day of the tenth month, within the world of the Eight Heavens, one must meditate with utmost sincerity and ardent devotion—only then may this writ be obtained.
