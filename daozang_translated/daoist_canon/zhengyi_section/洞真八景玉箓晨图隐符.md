*The Eight Radiant Jade Registers of the Morning Diagrams of the Highest Purity were received by the Most Exalted Lord of the Great Dao and treasured in secrecy by the Supreme Lord of the Highest Jade Purity.*

Only those whose names are inscribed upon the imperial registers in golden tablets and jade characters may hear and behold them. Without reciting the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the twelve supreme vows of the Three Treasures and the Divine Feminine Unity, and the Dao of summoning the rosy clouds, ingesting essence, and ascending the moon in a chariot of flowing radiance, one may not bear the *Eight Radiant Jade Registers of the Morning Diagrams* or the esoteric talismans.

Those who obtain the esoteric talismans shall, after eight years, ascend in the chariot of the Eight Radiant Scenes.

This text is profoundly esoteric, unknown to the worldly. The Supreme Lord of the Highest Jade Purity has concealed it within the Sevenfold Radiance Chamber of the Golden Orchid and Jade Coffer, sealed in a case of cinnabar blossoms, and entrusted it to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital. Twenty-four Jade Lads of the Golden Dawn and thirty-six Jade Maidens of the Jade Flower are commanded to attend and guard the esoteric talismans.

For recording merits and clarifying virtue, the Mystic Perfection imparts its teachings. Only after seven thousand years may it be transmitted thrice. If no worthy recipient is found, it shall be sealed within a renowned mountain. One must not recklessly reveal the sacred treasures, lest both master and disciple incur transgressions. The seven ancestors shall be burdened with the stones of Mount Meng, filling the River of Eternal Night. Both the disciple and their former master shall be consigned to the ranks of lesser ghosts, enduring ten sufferings, eight calamities, and boundless tribulations.

Now, this text is compiled to elucidate its solemn admonitions.

Those who bear the esoteric talismans received by the Most Exalted Lord of the Great Dao must, in a separate chamber, burn incense to the left and right, and pay homage morning and evening. They must not tread in defilement or impurity, lest they offend the true and disrupt the qi. The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens shall report their transgressions to the Most High, who shall punish them with trials of water and fire. The celestial perfected hold these secrets in the utmost reverence—how could one not be cautious?

On the days of the eight solar terms and one’s own life-destiny day, the bearer of the talisman shall bathe, enter the chamber, and at midnight, face north with a single-minded heart, bow in darkness, and visualize the Threefold Purity’s clouds descending from the northwest, filling the chamber inside and out. After a long while, cover the ears and mouth with both hands, draw in the cloud-qi thirty times, and swallow it. Upon completion, one shall perceive the cloud-qi dispersing, revealing two small children resembling infants, each holding a brocade pouch. One pouch contains the esoteric script of the *Eight Radiant Jade Registers*, and the other, the *Scripture of the Three Treasures*. They shall bestow these upon the practitioner’s body, whereupon the two children shall transform into two august emperors and enter the practitioner’s form.

Then recite the incantation:
*"Emerging from the Mystic, entering the Pure,
Returning to the radiant chamber of the dawn,
Teach me, instruct me,
O Unbounded White Prime,
The Feminine Unity nurtures,
The Five Registers penetrate the Mystic,
Thirty-nine chapters,
Ten thousand traversals of womb-born life,
Preserve the hun-soul, summon the spirit,
Unveil the gates of the Cavernous Perfection.
The jade talisman is complete,
The body ascends upon purple clouds,
To pay homage to the Northern Emperor,
And worship in the Jade Purity Palace."*

Upon completion, knock the teeth nine times and swallow saliva thirty times. After eight years of such practice, the jade chariot of the Eight Heavenly Radiant Scenes of the cloudy green canopy shall arrive to receive the practitioner’s body, ascending to the Jade Purity Palace.

In cultivation, one must not slacken, but devote the heart to the Mystic. What the Highest treasures, what the Most Exalted Lord of the Great Dao reveres, lies solely in sincerity. Guard it in secrecy and uphold it.

**The Esoteric Talisman of the Supreme Lord of the Dao of the Great Ultimate of the Highest Purity**
Bestowed upon the Most Exalted Jade Emperor of the Luminous Supreme Dao of the Jade Purity of the Upper Heaven, the Lord of the Great Dao of the Radiant Jade Purity of the Purple Brilliance, at the capital of the Flying Primordial Cloud-Root of the Lofty and Remote Miao-Fan Terrace.

On one’s life-destiny day, inscribe it in cinnabar upon azure paper and ingest it, or write it with realgar upon white silk and wear it as a sash.

This talisman subdues the myriad spirits of the world, the great concealed demonic gods, and the spectral singers of malevolent songs. It facilitates communion with the true and ensures that recitation is free from inauspicious dissonance. Upon wearing the talisman and reciting the scripture ten thousand times, the Three Primes shall dispatch the chariot of the Eight Radiant Scenes to welcome the practitioner’s body, ascending to the Jade Purity Palace.

The *Esoteric Morning Diagrams* emerged from the Palace of the Eight Primordial Void-Born Ones, congealed from qi into scripture. The Supreme Lord of the Purple Dao of the Cavernous Void of Jade Purity bestowed them upon the Most Exalted Lord of the Great Dao, who bore them in the boundless palace of the Eight Heavens. After seven thousand kalpas, they were entrusted to the Supreme Minister, the Azure Lad, to transmit to those destined for immortality in the latter age. Without the golden tablets and jade registers, none may partake in their revelation.

This Dao is lofty and wondrous, beyond the capacity of ordinary paper to record or the mouth to utter. Amidst the cycles of a hundred and six transformations within the three eras, the sagely assistants were chosen, and it could not but be transmitted to the world below.

The method of transmission must adhere to the Mysterious Regulations: within seven thousand years, it is passed thrice only to those with immortal bones. They shall establish a covenant and swear an oath, presenting eight taels of purple gold and eighty feet of purple silk, then receive it in reverence. When the master confers the trust, it should be bestowed upon those dwelling in desolate paths or succoring the destitute and distressed—never for personal gain.

The luminous statutes must not be transgressed; one must exercise utmost caution. To violate the covenant or betray the oath is to invite the trials of wind-knives upon the body and consign oneself to the endless toil of the lowest ghosts. Transmit it with discernment, and offer it with measured judgment.

In the time of King You of Zhou, there was a man named Jinguzhi, originally surnamed Wang and styled Xuandu—an ordinary mortal. One day, passing by the Northern Marchmount, he chanced upon a jade case. Opening it, he beheld the Hidden Talismans of the Eight Luminaries. Though Xuandu was unlettered and did not recognize the script, he sensed its divine nature. Following the text, he wore it without cultivating the practices. Thereafter, the clouds of the Three Primordials perpetually enshrouded his body, and he took the name Jinguzhi. After eight years, he ascended upon the clouds, now holding the office of Outer Immortal of the Nine Palaces. Yet, for failing to fulfill the requisite observances, he was not admitted to the court of the Jade Emperor. This was the transmission of Lord Wang.
