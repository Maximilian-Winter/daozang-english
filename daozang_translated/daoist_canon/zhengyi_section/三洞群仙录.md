**Preface to *The Record of the Immortals of the Three Caverns***
Compiled by Daoist Chen Baoguang of the Orthodox Unity Tradition

To dig into the earth in search of a spring—even the most foolish know it may be found. Yet to refine the body and attain immortality—even the wise cannot firmly believe. Thus do the immortals manifest their traces to enlighten the world, teaching the refinement of essence and preservation of truth, the safeguarding of life and nurturing of spirit, that one may transcend the world, escape the dust of clamor, rise above the filth of the mundane, and roam beyond the Eight Extremities. Their intent to benefit beings and aid humanity is vast indeed.

Yet immortals and mortals differ in nature, their aspirations and impurities distinct. When a person is born, they rely on form to house the spirit and on external things to sustain life. But in their folly, they later serve the form at the expense of the spirit, pursue things to the loss of their true nature, passing from youth to old age, from old age to decrepitude, from decrepitude to death. Flesh returns to earth, form and spirit part ways.

The immortal, however, nurtures form to preserve life. Their qi is concentrated, their will unified. They do not burden their heart with likes and dislikes, nor disturb their harmony with gain and loss. Their mind roams in tranquility, their qi merges with the void. In their perfection, the heart is still and the spirit whole, virtue complete and unblemished. Thus can they enter and exit the formless, alone in unity with the Dao, their lifespan matching heaven and earth, ascending into the Great Void to become a true immortal.

Yet Ji Kang claimed that immortality is bestowed by nature and cannot be attained through accumulated study, while Wu Jun asserted that immortality can be learned and achieved—such contradiction! I say: if immortality were not attained through accumulated study, then why did the Celestial Decree to Zhengyang state: *"The Immortal Student Xu Sun, in countless kalpas past, diligently cultivated the supreme Dao, enduring hardship and toil. Of the ten thousand methods and thousand gates, none did he fail to master. He dispelled disasters, relieved suffering, eradicated harm, and vanquished demons. His merit aided living beings, his name inscribed in the registers of immortals. The host of perfected beings have recommended him; he is worthy of promotion. Let him be appointed Grand Historian of the Nine Provinces, Supreme and Illustrious."*

And again, the Edict declared: *"The Immortal Student Xu Sun, you have expiated the sins of your past life—greed, killing, and neglect of ancestral rites. Your present life’s merits are recorded: chanting spells over water, administering medicines, curing illnesses, and suppressing evil poisons. The Lord of Life of Mount Qian has transmitted the Golden Elixir to the mortal realm. Your debts are sealed, your form preserved; your body, household, kitchen, and all possessions shall return to the Three Heavens."* Both edicts refer to him as *"Immortal Student"* and speak of *"diligent cultivation of the supreme Dao, enduring hardship and toil"*—thus is it proven that immortality can indeed be attained through study.

Before Mao Ying’s birth, in the thirty-first year of the First Emperor of Qin, his grandfather Mao Chucheng ascended to heaven in broad daylight upon a cloud from Mount Hua. The villagers marveled, saying: *"The immortal Mao Chucheng has attained the Dao! Riding a dragon, he ascends to the Great Clarity. At times he descends to the Dark Continent, plays on the Red City. His descendants shall follow; among them is our Ying. If the Emperor would learn from him, he too might achieve immortality in the twelfth month."*

According to Ying’s *Inner Biography* and the *Stele of the Nine Bestowments*, he was born in the fifth year of Emperor Jing of Han’s *Zhongyuan* era—seventy-two years before his birth, during the reign of the First Emperor, the prophecy of his future immortality had already spread. In the second year of Emperor Ai of Han’s *Yuanshou* era, the Celestial Court bestowed upon him the title *Supreme Perfected of the Great Prime, Lord of Life and Minister of the Eastern Marchmount*. At that time, he was one hundred and forty-five years old. If this were so, could immortality not be bestowed by nature?

Two hundred and seventeen years before Ying’s conception, the prophecy of his future immortality had already circulated—truly a prediction of what was yet to come. How could this be the result of accumulated study? Those of shallow learning who claim immortality is not attained through study and thus abandon diligent cultivation are those who harm themselves. Those who claim it can be learned and achieved are like those who would grind a brick to make a mirror or sit in meditation to become a Buddha.

The Way of loyalty and sincerity has no other principle but sincerity and unity. With sincerity and unity, one may enter water without drowning, enter fire without burning, part metal and stone, and remain unharmed by tigers and leopards. Witness Shang Qiu Kai or the man of Lü Liang—even with mere unity, such wonders are possible. How much more so for the perfected immortal, whose form and spirit are both wondrous, in perfect union with the Dao? Their sitting is like vanishing, their standing like disappearance. They divide their form, scatter their body, transform in an instant, and fly across the Eight Extremities—such is only fitting.

The scholar of the true cultivation empties the self to preserve truth, embraces unity and simplicity, treasures compassion as their jewel, and takes stillness as their foundation. At dawn, they perceive the solitary; in clarity, they merge with the boundless. Their essential teaching does not depart from the books of Laozi and Zhuangzi. All else is false and deceitful discourse, not the writings of the sages.

When the Yellow Emperor lost the Dark Pearl, the Seven Sages lost their way, yet only *Xiangwang* (Vague Net) found it. When the minnows *Tiao* and *Hu* encountered *Hundun* (Chaos), they bored a hole in him each day, and in the end, caused his death. This shows that those who attain the Dao must abandon form and discard knowledge, embrace emptiness, stillness, and simplicity, remain unmoving in unity, pure and unadulterated. This is the root of nurturing form and spirit, of returning to the workings of creation.

The rulers of Qin and Han indulged in desires and extravagance, swept away by splendor. They admired the arts of immortality, desiring long life to preserve their glory, and trusted in the teachings of the Golden Elixir, relying on the power of medicines to sustain their excesses. Thus did masters of esoteric arts emerge, and the arts of illusion and transformation flourish. Some compounded lead and mercury, concocting cinnabar into the "Great Medicine"; others swallowed saliva and visualized the Dragon and Tiger to refine the "Inner Elixir." There arose names like *Lord of Wood* and *Queen Mother of the West*, titles like *Maiden* and *Infant*, terms like *Yellow Sprout* and *White Snow*, and secrets like the *Seven Returns* and *Nine Cycles*. Above, there were wonders like the *Mystic Capital* and *Crimson Towers*, chronicles of the *Red Clarity* and *Dragon Han* eras, the regulations of the *Three Caverns’ Talismans*, and the rituals of the *Nine Altars’ Offerings*. Below, there were methods of corpse liberation, body reflection, soul transmigration, and possession seizure, as well as flying talismans, black magic, exorcisms, and demon-subduing techniques. All arose from the indistinct and took form, from the formless and measured existence—ten thousand gates and a thousand paths, branching into heterodox byways.

When their work reaches fruition, though paths diverge, all converge as one—hundred deliberations lead to the same end. Scholars of the world must establish their root or they cannot stand; they must refine their pattern or they cannot complete. To guard emptiness and preserve the true, to embrace the One and abide in simplicity—this is the root. Transformations and ascensions, corpse liberation and black magic—these are the branches. Thus it is said: when the root is established, the branches naturally respond; when the foundation is solid, the ornamentation is complete—this is the principle of nature.

Daoist Chen Baoguang of Jingying Jingying Hermitage in Jiangyin, grieved that those of superficial learning grow weary of diligent cultivation, abandon themselves to idleness, live as walking corpses, and die as lowly ghosts, gathered the books of the Nine Schools and the Hundred Masters, even descending to minor officials and vulgar sayings. From all that recorded the affairs of immortals, he compiled this work to enlighten later learners, that they might know the diligence of perfected immortals in cultivating the true, their merit in aiding others, their reverence in serving Heaven, and the arduousness of attaining the Dao—such toil and effort, yet in the end they achieve success, their glory resplendent, becoming companions of Heaven.

Formerly, Sima Ziwei wrote the *Pivot of Sitting in Forgetfulness*, and Chen Bixu composed the *Resonance of the Primordial* to enlighten later generations, both works profound in purport, yet beginners and the dull-witted had no way to enter. Now Master Chen has gathered the deeds of immortals and extolled the mighty exploits of lofty perfected ones, making them clear to those who turn toward the Dao. Upon opening this book, one sees plainly that immortality can be learned, that the traces of sages and worthies through the ages are gathered before one’s eyes, as if viewing them on the palm of the hand. Stirred and encouraged, one is roused to ardent effort, leaping forward with vigor, aspiring to transcend the world—like placing a vessel of fine wine at a crossroads, where all may draw and drink to intoxication. In guiding the lost and teaching the deluded, in aiding others and benefiting the world, his merit is no small thing.

Master Chen’s spirit is empty and still, his virtue pure and harmonious. Clutching the sacred texts of the Three Caverns, his spirit soars to the Azure Heavens; gazing into the secret peaks of the Nine Purities, his name is inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace. One day, he will join the ranks of immortals and receive his position, borne aloft on clouds to ascend. The Five Emperors will review his register, the Three Officials will record his merit—this is how Heaven repays the toil of those who compose such works, startling the indolent and negligent, that they may know: those who contribute to the world are surely rewarded by Heaven.

Orthodox Unity Daoist Chen Baoguang compiled and assembled:

**Pangu, Ancestor of All Things; the Yellow Emperor, Founder of the Dao.**

*The Record of Wonders* states: Pangu was the ancestor of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. At his passing, his head became the Five Peaks, his eyes the sun and moon, his fat and marrow the rivers and seas, and his hair and whiskers the grasses and trees. Another account says: his head became Mount Tai in the east, his belly Mount Song in the center, his left arm Mount Heng in the south, his right arm Mount Heng in the north, and his feet Mount Hua in the west. His tears became rivers, his breath wind and thunder, his joy clear skies, and his anger overcast. Furthermore, Xu Zheng’s *Records of the Three and Five Eras* says: Heaven and earth were a chaotic mass like an egg, and Pangu dwelled within it for eighteen thousand years. When heaven and earth split open, the pure yang became heaven, the turbid yin became earth, and Pangu transformed within them, growing nine times in a single day—divine in heaven, sagely on earth. Each day, heaven rose a *zhang* higher, earth grew a *zhang* thicker, and Pangu lengthened a *zhang* taller. Thus, after eighteen thousand years, heaven reached its utmost height, earth its utmost depth, and Pangu his utmost stature. Only then did the Three Sovereigns appear. Numbers began with one, stood firm in three, were completed in five, flourished in seven, and settled in nine—hence heaven is ninety thousand *li* from earth.

Another true scripture says: Before the Two Modes separated, all was a vast, formless expanse, neither shape nor sun and moon yet formed, resembling an egg in its chaotic dark and yellow. Yet Pangu the Perfected, the essence of heaven and earth, already existed, calling himself the Primordial Heavenly King.

*The Transmission of Daoist Learning* states: The Yellow Emperor, son of Shaodian, bore the surname Gongsun and the style Changhong. He was also called Guizang and, due to the auspicious sign of red clouds, Jinyun. As his complexion was more red than white, he was named Jinyun. Another auspicious sign of earthly virtue earned him the title Yellow Emperor. Though young, he could speak, and though a sage, he foresaw all. Fond of the profound and wondrous Dao, he became the founder of the Daoist tradition.

**Shaohao’s Zither and Se, Zhuanxu’s Bestowed Bells.**
*The Supplement to the Records of the Historian* says: Shaohao ruled the world by metal virtue. The imperial consort Huange wove by night in the Swirling Palace or roamed by day on a raft of mulberry wood, traversing the desolate shores of Qiongsang. There, a divine youth of unearthly beauty, called the son of the White Emperor, descended as the essence of Venus to the water’s edge and played with Huange. Another account says: On the shores of the Western Sea stood a solitary mulberry tree, towering a thousand *xun*, its leaves red and fruit purple. It bore fruit once every ten thousand years, and those who ate it remained youthful even after aging. The emperor’s son and Huange drifted together on the sea. Seated side by side, the prince plucked a zither of paulownia wood, while Huange leaned upon it and sang:

*"Heaven is clear, earth is vast, boundless and hazy,
The myriad forms surge and transform without end.
The sky stretches wide, the waves roll far—
Lightly adrift on the raft, I draw near the sun.
Where shall we go when the time comes? To Qiongsang?
My heart knows harmony and joy, never-ending."*

The White Emperor’s son answered:

*"The four corners, eight wastes—too distant to reach,
The net of light chases shadows to the water’s edge.
In the Swirling Palace, the night is still, weaving at the window,
The paulownia’s trunk stands straight a thousand *xun*.
Felled and crafted into instruments—lutes and zithers,
Pure songs flow ceaselessly, joy without limit.
Come, rest by the sea’s shores and hidden isles."*

Huange later gave birth to Shaohao, who was called Qiongsang or Sangqiu.

Zhuanxu, the High Lord of Gaoyang, was the grandson of the Yellow Emperor and son of Changyi. Changyi once walked by the riverbank and encountered a black dragon bearing the Primordial Jade Chart. An old scribe told him: "Your son will rule by water virtue." Ten years later, Zhuanxu was born, his hands marked like dragons, bearing the image of the jade chart. That night, Changyi looked up to see the North Star descend and transform into the old scribe. When Zhuanxu ascended the throne, wondrous omens and blessings gathered without exception. Even those who did not follow the imperial calendar came across mountains and seas to pay homage. The emperor bowed to the spirits of the four directions, while the empress held the jade tablet to receive the feudal lords in proper order. To those who embodied civil virtue, he bestowed bells and chimes; to those of martial virtue, shields and spears. There were floating golden bells and chimes adorned with feathers—when brushed with a feather duster, their sound carried a hundred *li*.

**Tang Yao’s Crane Call, Xia Yu’s Dragon Ride.**
*The Supplement to the Records of the Historian* says: During Emperor Yao’s reign, his sagely virtue shone far and wide. By the banks of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, a red jade tablet appeared, bearing the shape of heaven and earth. He also received a golden jade disk, its inscriptions radiant, recording the origins of heaven and earth’s creation. After the Four Fiends were executed, good people submitted, offices were established, and the proper order of human relations was set. Yao commanded Yu the Great to dredge rivers and drain marshes. In the land of Wu and the northern regions, no calamities or monsters arose, and even birds and beasts were tame. In the ruins of Youzhou, north of Feather Mountain, there was a bird with a melodious cry, its voice like bells, chimes, reed pipes, and zithers. The saying goes: when the azure crane sings, the age is at peace. In the country of Nanxun, there was a cave with a dark spring, its depths connecting to the earth’s veins. Within dwelled a furred dragon, which shed its bones in the open marshes, sharing its den with fish and dragons. The country presented a pair of these dragons, male and female, to the office of dragon keepers. The practice of raising dragons continued unbroken through the Xia dynasty, giving rise to the clan’s name. When Yu tamed the hundred rivers, he rode these dragons. After the four seas were united, he released them into the Yellow River.

**Boyang, Master of Emperors; Zhongni, Perfected Duke.**
*The Extensive Records* says: Laozi’s name was Er, his style Boyang. He was a native of Quren Village in Kuxian County, Chu. His mother conceived him after seeing a shooting star shaped like a tree. Some say Laozi existed before heaven and earth, or that he was the essence of heaven, a divine spirit. He was born by splitting his mother’s left armpit, emerging with white hair—hence the name Laozi. During Fuxi’s time, he appeared as a teacher, called Yuanhuazi, instructing Fuxi in the ancient methods, expounding yin and yang, aligning the eight directions, and establishing the eight trigrams.

In the time of Shennong, he emerged as a teacher, called Master Dacheng, instructing Shennong in tasting the hundred herbs, cultivating the five grains, and teaching the people to sow and plant. During the age of Zhurong, he appeared as a teacher, named Master Guangcheng, teaching the cultivation of the Three Bonds and the alignment of the Seven Governances. In the era of the Yellow Emperor, he served as a teacher, known as Master Limu, regulating yin and yang and composing the *Scripture of Daoist Admonitions*. From Shaohao and Gaoxin to Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, Lord Lao appeared as the imperial teacher, each time bearing a different name, transmitting his scriptures, and imparting his Dao. His transformations were boundless, beyond exhaustive explication. In the time of King Zhao, he emerged to enlighten and guide the Western Hu; by the reign of King You, he returned to the Central Lands.

Thus, when Confucius journeyed to Zhou to inquire about ritual, he said: "Today I have seen Laozi—is he not like a dragon?" Laozi knew the origins of ritual and music, the return of the Dao and virtue; truly, he was my teacher.

*The Records of the Grand Historian* states: Qiu, styled Zhongni, bore the surname Kong. *The Supplement to the Records of the Historian* recounts: On the night of Confucius’ birth, two azure dragons descended from heaven, and two divine maidens held fragrant dew in the air to bathe him. Zhen was favored by the Celestial Emperor, who sent down the music of the Grand Harmony, while five elders stood in the courtyard—these were the essences of the five stars. Earlier, a qilin had spat forth a jade tablet at a household in Queli, inscribed: "Child of the Water Essence, bound to Zhou yet a plain king." Thus, the two dragons entered the chamber, the five stars descended into the courtyard, and Zhen tied a brocade sash to the qilin’s horn. When the Master was about to pass, he embraced the qilin, removed his sash, and wept.

*The New Record of the Red Terrace* states: Confucius was the Perfected Duke of the Supreme Ultimate, governing Mount Jiuyi. Fu Yue was likened to a star, while Zoutu dreamed of the sun. *The Zhuangzi* says: Fu Yue attained this and served as minister to Wu Ding, encompassing the realm. Riding the eastern cord and astride the tail of the Winnowing Basket, he was ranked among the stars.

*The Supplement to the Records of the Historian* recounts: The consort of Emperor Ku was a daughter of the Zoutu clan. When the Yellow Emperor subdued the ferocity of Chiyou, he relocated the virtuous among his people to the land of Zoutu and banished the wicked to the northern wastes. Their ancestors took their clan name from the land, splitting into the Zou and Tu lineages. The woman walked without touching the earth, treading upon wind and clouds as she roamed between the Yi and Luo rivers. The emperor awaited her there and took her as his consort. She often dreamed of swallowing the sun, and with each dream, she bore a son. After eight dreams, she had eight sons, known in the world as the Eight Spirits, or the Eight Radiant Ones. *Yi* means "brightness." They were also called the Eight Heroes or the Eight Powers. Their divine power and heroic brilliance illuminated all phenomena, and the multitudes flowed with their divine wisdom.

Gongsun played the zither, while Shi Yan blew the pitch pipes. *The Unofficial History of Jin* states: Gongsun Feng secluded himself on Mount Jiuyu. In winter, he wore a single garment and slept on a bed of earth; in summer, he stored his food in vessels until it spoiled before eating. Whenever he played the zither and chanted, he was content in solitude, and all who saw him marveled. *The Supplement to the Records of the Historian* recounts: Shi Yan was a musician of the Shang. Proficient in the mysteries of yin and yang and versed in celestial patterns, his nature was unfathomable. He mastered the music of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors; when he plucked a single string of his zither, earthly spirits ascended, and when he blew his jade pitch pipes, heavenly deities descended. Though he had already lived for centuries by the time of the Yellow Emperor, he could still perform the *Qingshang* and *Liudiao* melodies, as well as the tunes that bewitch the soul and seduce the spirit.

Zifang was enfeoffed with ten thousand households, while She Zheng entered the Chamber of the Orthodox Unity. *The Biographies of Immortals* states: Zhang Liang, styled Zifang, having aided the Han Emperor Gaozu to success, declared: "I have served as the emperor’s teacher with my three-inch tongue, been enfeoffed with ten thousand households, and ranked among the marquises—this is the pinnacle for a commoner, and it is enough for me. I wish to abandon worldly affairs and follow Master Red Pine in his wanderings." *The Biographies of Divine Immortals* recounts: She Zheng was a native of Badong. He spoke of events from the time of the First Emperor of Qin as if he had witnessed them firsthand. He often walked with his eyes closed, and his disciples followed him for decades without ever seeing him open them. When someone persistently entreated him, She Zheng opened his eyes, and their light flashed like lightning, illuminating the entire chamber. Li Babai called him "the thousand-year-old child."

Ma Di retreated in obscurity, while Zhao Wei lived in reclusion.

*The Supplementary Biographies of Immortals* records: Master Madi was a man of unknown origin who, together with He Danyang, dwelt in reclusion on Mount Heming in Shu, cultivating the Eightfold Dao’s "Gazing-at-Clouds" method. He lived in profound seclusion for many years. Later, within a grotto sanctuary, he uncovered a stone casket containing the Yellow Emperor’s Golden Crucible Formula. He refined the elixir upon the mountain, and upon its completion, ingested it and ascended to heaven.

The original *Biographies* state: During the Sui dynasty, Li Zhaowei was a man of reclusive aspirations who admired Ge Hong’s character. In his quest for the Dao, he sought masters without regard for the thousand-mile journey. He served as magistrate of Gaotang. During the Daye era, he took his wife and children into reclusion on Mount Song, where he was known as the "Yellow-Crowned Master."

The sagely son of Jiandi, the immortal king of the Lan clan.
Wang Jia’s *Supplementary Records of Antiquity* recounts: At the dawn of the Shang, the divine maiden Jiandi wandered the mulberry fields when she saw a black bird drop an egg upon the earth, inscribed with five-colored patterns forming eight hundred characters. Jiandi retrieved it and stored it in a jade tube, covering it with a vermilion cord. That night, a spirit-woman appeared to her in a dream, saying: "You have conceived this object and shall bear a sagely son to succeed the Metal Virtue." Jiandi then carried the child in her womb for a year, and after fourteen months, gave birth to Xie. The eight hundred years of his reign were foretold by the markings on the egg. Though the land suffered drought and hardship, his descendants flourished thereafter.

The *Extensive Records* states: Lan Gong was a native of Yanzhou, whose household numbered over a hundred. His devotion to filial piety was so profound that it moved the divine spirits. One day, a perfected being descended from the moon into his chamber, calling himself the Luminous King of Filial Piety. He declared: "When you dwell in the sun, you shall be the Immortal King; when in the moon, the Luminous King; when among men, the King of Filial Piety. For when filial devotion reaches the heavens, the sun and moon shine brightly; when it reaches the earth, the myriad things flourish; when it reaches the people, the kingly Way is fulfilled. Moreover, the Three Powers first divided from the Three Qi. These Three Qi are the Three Heavens of Jade Purity. I, dwelling in the Upper Clarity, manifest among men to expound the teachings of filial piety. In the Jin dynasty, Master Xu transmitted my lineage of the Dao of filial devotion, becoming the foremost among the immortals. Now I bestow upon you these secret instructions." With these words, he vanished. Lan Gong suddenly awakened to the true mystery. Having attained the Dao, he ascended in broad daylight.

The jade flute of Emperor Shun and the brocade pouch of Emperor Wu:
The *Extensive Records* recounts: When Emperor Shun ascended the throne, the Queen Mother of the West dispatched an envoy to present him with a white jade ring and a map for expanding the territory. Thus, he extended the Nine Provinces of the Yellow Emperor to twelve. The Queen Mother also sent an envoy to bestow upon Shun a white jade flute, which, when played, harmonized the eight winds. The *Inner Chronicle of Emperor Wu of Han* states: Emperor Wu saw in the Queen Mother’s casket a small scroll encased in a purple brocade pouch. Upon gazing at it, the Queen Mother said: "This is the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. The immortals of Qingcheng recently entreated me for it, as it was issued by the Supreme One of the Three Heavens. Its script is secret and forbidden—how could your impure form be worthy to wear it?"

The reverent secrecy of Du Zigong and the forbidden formulas of Chang Sang:
The *Collected Writings of Xianji* records: Du Zigong possessed secret arts. Once, he borrowed a melon knife from someone, and when the owner demanded its return, Zigong said: "I shall return it presently." Later, the knife’s owner traveled to Jiaxing, where a fish leapt into his boat. Upon cutting it open, he found the melon knife. Such were the frequent marvels of his divine efficacy. The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: Bian Que was a native of Zheng in Bohai Commandery, surnamed Qin and named Yue-ren. In his youth, he served as an innkeeper. When the guest Chang Sang passed through, Bian Que alone recognized his extraordinary nature and treated him with generosity. Chang Sang, perceiving that Bian Que was no ordinary man, visited him for over a decade before calling him to a private audience. He said: "I possess forbidden formulas and, being advanced in years, wish to transmit them to you. Do not reveal them." Bian Que replied: "I respectfully accept." Chang Sang then produced medicine from his sleeve and said: "Drink this with the water from the upper pool for thirty days, and you shall perceive all things." He then entrusted all his forbidden texts to Bian Que. Suddenly, he vanished—likely no mortal. Bian Que followed his instructions and drank the medicine for thirty days. Thereafter, he could see through walls, and by this means, he diagnosed illnesses, perceiving the obstructions in the five viscera, though he concealed his ability beneath the guise of mere pulse-reading.

The golden elixir of Dou Qian and the jade nectar of the Song elder:
The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: Dou Qian was a native of Fufeng. During the reigns of Emperors Huai and Min of the Western Jin, the imperial house declined, and the Central Plains were in turmoil. Nearing the age of official service, he grieved over the chaos and longed to follow the paths of Master Red Pine and Wangzi Qiao. He took refuge in secluded peaks and deep caves, contemplating the supreme Dao through countless trials. One evening, divine radiance illuminated his chamber, and an extraordinary fragrance filled the valley. Celestial music drew near, accompanied by hundreds of attendants. A perfected immortal with a luminous circular pendant descended in a carriage, supported by two maidens and followed by officials in leather robes. Appearing no older than thirty, with the bearing of a crane, he called himself the Longevity Lord of the Shady Side of Pingdu Mountain. Moved by Dou Qian’s diligence, he transmitted the secret of the nine elixirs of golden fluid, administering oaths of transmission before departing. The *Extensive Records* states: The Song elder was an old man of Mount Song during the Jin dynasty. Once, he fell into a cavern in the mountain and wandered through its passages. There, he saw a substance like green mud, which he ate, thereafter feeling no hunger. Continuing through the cavern, he suddenly emerged at his home. When he consulted Zhang Hua, the latter said: "This is a grotto heaven. What you ate was jade nectar. You are destined to become an immortal."

The transcendent Hu Huichao and the reclusive Luo Yuansu:
The *Supplement to Immortal Biographies* records: During the Tang dynasty, Hu Huichao was a man of transcendent virtue. When he stood among others, his head towered above them, and even the tallest barely reached his shoulders. Thus, he was called "Tall Immortal Hu." He excelled at commanding spirits and gods. The *Accounts from the Hall of Manifestation* states: Luo Yuansu of Zhaoqing was a minor official who one day vanished into seclusion. The magistrate, enraged, ordered his arrest with great urgency. Yuansu hid in the mountains, where he suddenly encountered an old man leaning on a staff beneath a towering pine. The old man summoned him and asked: "How did you come here?" Yuansu truthfully recounted his plight and begged for refuge. The old man led him deep into the mountains. After traveling over ten *li*, they arrived at two thatched huts beside a pond, surrounded by rare trees and exotic flowers. Two young attendants resided in the western hut, while the eastern hut contained an alchemical furnace. The old man, who called himself Dongzhen, ordered Yuansu to tend the fire. He gave Yuansu several pellets of medicine, saying: "These will cure hunger." Thereafter, Yuansu abstained from grain. After a year, Dongzhen taught him talismanic arts and the method of absorbing *qi*, imparting all their mysteries. One day, he told Yuansu: "You may return home now." He then escorted Yuansu to a point several dozen *li* south of the county, where they parted. From then on, Yuansu’s talismanic arts became renowned in his village, their divine efficacy too numerous to record.

The golden fish of Liu Zhigu and the jade crow of An Qi:
The *Biographies of Eminent Daoists* states: The Daoist Liu Zhigu, styled Guangyuan, was summoned by Emperor Ruizong, who questioned him on Daoist teachings. Pleased with his responses, the emperor bestowed special honors upon him. During the Kaiyuan era, natural disasters and epidemics spread, afflicting eight or nine out of every ten people.

The emperor summoned Zhigu to treat the afflictions, whereupon he sighed and said: "Even great virtue arises daily, yet perfected ones too may fall ill. Lower methods refine medicines, superior physicians examine voices, but to resort to needles and moxibustion is already far removed from the Way." Thereupon, he substituted color for sacrificial swine and employed *qi* to dispel pestilence, thus curing deep-seated ailments as swiftly as rivers flow and dispersing pathogens like melting snow—so profound was his mastery. The emperor offered him lavish rewards, all of which he declined. At the foot of Huashan in Dongyang stood an ancient abbey, which he renovated and took as his residence. Suddenly, a radiance filled his chamber, and a single stalk of cinnabar *lingzhi* emerged, ringing with the sound of gold and jade when struck. In a dream, a divine being told him: "Within the cliff of the rear mountain lies a golden fish. Mount it, and you may ascend to the heavens—but without this *lingzhi* to strike the stone, it cannot be summoned." At dawn, he searched for the golden fish but found no trace. That night, he dreamed again: "It lies beneath the dripping spring." Arriving at the spot, he struck the stone with the *lingzhi*, and with a thunderous crack, the boulder split asunder. There lay a golden fish, over three *chi* in length. Mounting it, he soared into the sky, enveloped in swirling clouds and mist, and departed.

*The Biographies of Immortals* states: Master An Qi was a native of Fu Village in Langya. He sold medicines by the sea, and all who met him claimed he had lived a thousand years. Qin Shihuang summoned him for an audience and, after conversing with him, bestowed gold and jade worth thousands of *wan*. An Qi left these at the pavilion of Fu Village and departed, leaving behind a letter with a red jade crow as repayment, saying: "Seek me a thousand years hence beneath Mount Penglai." His countenance remained youthful, his complexion fair as jade.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Ling Shouguang, over seventy years of age, encountered an extraordinary person and obtained the art of ingesting *qi*. His appearance reverted to that of a man of twenty. By the first year of the Jian’an era, he had lived over two hundred years before dissolving his form. When his coffin was opened, no corpse remained—only a single shoe. Another transcendent, Yu Zhen, began studying the Dao at seventy-nine. She mastered the method of embryonic breathing and abstained from grains for over thirty years. Though her flesh diminished, her complexion grew fair, and she could run as swiftly as a galloping horse. Emperor Wu summoned her, and she appeared no older than twenty. When he inquired among her villagers, they claimed she was over four hundred years old. The emperor revered her as a divine being, but she declined his offers and returned home, covering three hundred *li* in a single day.

Jingchun achieved nothing; Zinian barely succeeded.

*The Biographies of Immortals* states: Guo Pu, styled Jingchun.

*The Records of the Western Mountains* relates: Perfected Lord Xu Xun, seeing the Jin dynasty’s decline and the frequent outbreaks of war, sought to avert future calamities. He and Lord Wu visited Wang Dun, where Guo Pu—an old acquaintance—was already in attendance. Together, they were granted an audience. Dun said to the Perfected Lord: "I dreamed of wood splitting the heavens. What does this portend?" The Lord replied: "Wood splitting the heavens above forms the character *wei* (未). Should you act rashly?" Dun then ordered Guo Pu to divine the matter. Pu said: "It will come to nothing." Dun was displeased and asked: "How long is your lifespan?" Pu replied: "If you launch your campaign, disaster will strike soon. If you return to Wuchang, your fate cannot be foretold." Dun grew furious and demanded: "How long is *your* lifespan?" Pu answered: "It ends at noon today." Dun ordered his guards to seize Pu and execute him. The Perfected Lord hurled his wine cup into the air, where it transformed into a white dove, circling the rafters. As Dun looked up, the two Lords had already vanished. Later, Dun ultimately could not escape his fate.

From the *Book of Jin*: Wang Jia, styled Zinian, ate no grains, wore no fine garments, and kept no company with worldly men. He wandered and dwelled in seclusion in Dongyang Valley. Those who sought him with sincere hearts would see him, but if their hearts were insincere, he would conceal his form and vanish. When Yao Chang sought to kill Fu Jian, he consulted Jia. Jia replied: "You will *lue* obtain it." Chang grew furious and said: "If you say 'obtain,' then say 'obtain'—what is this *lue*?" He then had Jia beheaded.

Previously, the monk Dao’an had said to Jia: "The world’s troubles are now at their height—you may depart." Jia replied: "You go first; I still have debts unpaid and cannot yet leave." Soon after, Dao’an passed away, and at this time Jia was executed. Now, Chang’s son, Xing, styled Zilüe, had just killed Jian—this was the meaning of "*lue* obtain it."

On the day of Jia’s death, people saw him on the ridges of Long. He drank osmanthus-infused water, and Zhang was granted rich marrow.

From the *Biographies of the Immortals*: Fan Li, styled Shaobo, was a native of Xuzhou. He served the Zhou master, the Grand Duke, and favored osmanthus-scented water and a grain-free diet. He became a minister of Yue. After Goujian destroyed Wu, Fan Li boarded a light boat and entered the sea, changing his name. He then went to Qi, where he was known as Yazi Zipi. Over a hundred years later, he appeared in Tao, amassing wealth in the hundreds of millions, and was called Tao Zhugong. Later, he abandoned his fortune and sold medicines in Lanling. For generations afterward, people continued to recognize him.

From the *Supplement to the Biographies of the Immortals*: Zhang Yunling cultivated the Dao at Zhaoxian Abbey on Mount Nanyue. Through refined contemplation, he achieved spiritual resonance, and Heaven bestowed upon him the true esoterica, teaching him the Way of internal nurturance and harmonizing primordial qi, as well as the practice of silent audience before the Great Emperor. After thirteen years of practice, his spirit roamed the Great Origin, and he faced the August Ultimate in audience. The Great Emperor bestowed upon him the divine elixir of *qiong-yu* and *lang-gao*, a liquid for merging spirit and luminous essence. Having received and ingested it, he underwent wondrous transformations, his spiritual efficacy boundless. In the first year of the Jianxing era, on the third day of the ninth month, he ascended to Heaven.

Lingxiao grasped jujubes, while Wang Ji obtained a peach.
In the *Declarations of the Perfected*, the Ninth Radiance True Consort, styled Lingxiao, once descended alongside the Purple Yang Lady into the chamber of the Perfected Yang. The Lady asked Yang, "Have you ever seen such a person in the world?" Yang replied, "Her spirit is lofty and refined—nothing can compare." The Lady laughed heartily. The Consort held three jujubes, giving one to each person to eat. The True Consort said, "Your master is the Lady of Mount Nanyue, who holds authority over life and destiny. Her Dao is supremely wondrous and complete—truly the lineage of profound virtue." Yang remarked, "These jujubes have no pits, and their flavor resembles that of pears."

From the *Biographies of the Immortal Wangs*: Wang Chai, formerly the magistrate of Wangwu, recited the *Yellow Court Scripture*. Each time he sought to annotate it, he failed to grasp its profound principles. After reciting it over six thousand times, he resigned his post and entered the grotto-heavens to seek the true and visit the Dao, vowing never to return. One day, deep within the cavern, he saw a stone bed and desk upon which lay a scripture, beside which stood a divine personage. The figure said to him, "Is this your aspiration? I am the immortal Wang Taixu. I have annotated this scripture for seven hundred years, and now I bestow it upon you." He then gave Wang a peach, saying, "This peach does not grow in the mortal realm. Having obtained it, whoever eats it will ascend in broad daylight."

Miaoxiang paid audience to Shun, while Liangqing recommended [a worthy] to Yao.
From the *Collected Biographies of the Immortals*: Wang Miaoxiang was a female Daoist from Cangwu. She practiced grain avoidance and qi absorption, focusing her thoughts on the cinnabar palace. Through this, she achieved resonance, and wondrous signs often appeared—radiant clouds, fragrant aromas, celestial music shaking the forests and valleys. Suddenly, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descended from the sky. A retinue of a thousand, each over ten feet tall, wielded halberds, weapons, banners, and standards. After a long while, a crane-canopied phoenix chariot, drawn by nine dragons, alighted before the altar. A figure wearing a sword and trailing slippers ascended the dais and sat, his body emanating five-colored light. Hundreds of immortals attended him. Miaoxiang approached to pay her respects. The Great Immortal said to her, "I am none other than Emperor Shun. Once wearied of governing the myriad states, I nurtured the Dao upon this mountain. I often wish to guide and instruct later generations, so that the world may know there is no one who cannot be taught. The Dao resides within, not without; it is in your own person, not in others. As the mysterious scripture says, 'Cultivate it in your person, and your virtue shall be pure'—this is not something others can achieve. I have seen the Earthly Controller’s memorials reporting that you have dwelled on this mountain for over thirty years, steadfast from beginning to end, unwavering in your devotion to the Dao. You have attained perfection." Thereupon, he commanded his attendants to bestow upon her the two scriptures of the *Dao and Virtue* and the *Elixir of Lingering Radiance*, then departed. Thereafter, he descended to the Yellow Court Abbey once every year or three to five years. Several years later, Miaoxiang ascended to immortality.

From the *Compendium of Marvels*: Chen Liangqing, in the fourth year of Jingyou, traveled from Yongzhou to the capital to take the imperial examinations. In the tenth month, he reached Changsha and dreamed of a guide leading him onto a great ship, where he met a Daoist who called himself the Master of Azure Essence. Their discourse was lofty and archaic. The Master said to Chen, "I have already recommended you to Yao as a forthright and thoroughly refined minister." Chen asked, "Where is Yao now?" The Master replied, "He presides over Mount Nanyue." Chen said, "Yao was an ancient sage-king—how could he be ranked among dukes and marquises?" The Master said, "Yao was an emperor among men, ruling by the power of Fire. Having relinquished the world, he became a spirit, taking his place in the South. Why do you doubt this?" Chen declined, citing his unestablished official career, and requested another day to respond. The Master granted him a ten-year reprieve. Upon waking, Chen found the dream strange and recorded it to console himself. The following year, he passed the examinations and was appointed judicial officer of Quanzhou. Passing through the South Pavilion of Yueyang, he dozed off during the day and dreamed again. A messenger arrived with an official summons, startling him awake. He sighed, "Could this be Yao’s command?" His companions encouraged him, dismissing the dream as untrustworthy. Later, while reviewing documents, he suddenly died at dusk as his meal was being prepared.

He knew of Shaluo, while Pei recalled Lanqiao.
From the *Supplement to the Biographies of the Immortals*: He Danyang, a native of Longyou, served as a Gentleman of the Palace Secretariat during the late Han. Between the reigns of Emperors Ai and Ping, the imperial house declined. He said to others, "Today’s affairs are beyond human control—this is the ordained course of history. Long ago, Shaluo collapsed, and a prognosticator declared: 'Five hundred years hence, a sagely woman of Qi shall rise.' Now, the Chancellor is a descendant of the Tian clan of Qi. The sagely empress is destined for this era—it is time to overthrow the Han and restore Qi’s enterprise." Thereupon, he abandoned worldly concerns for the mountains and forests, seeking transcendence. He often consumed pine pollen, which made his body light and his vision keen.

Thus he resigned his post and withdrew into seclusion, dwelling among the famed mountains of Shu. The Supreme Perfected of Great Peace descended to transmit to him the Dao of climbing the stellar chariot and riding the dragon, and later he ascended to the heavens.

From the *Records of Transmitted Tales*: Pei Hang hired a boat on the Xiang and Han rivers. Aboard the same vessel was Lady Fan, a woman of imperial beauty. Hang sent a poem to her maid Niaoyan:

*"Though north and south share this boat, longing lingers still,
How much more when a heavenly immortal stands behind the brocade screen?
If you ascend to the Jade Capital for the morning audience,
I would follow the phoenix and crane into the azure void."*

The lady replied: "I have a husband in Hannan. I pray you do not take these playful words to heart. Though there is a slight affinity between us, sir, we may yet become kin in the future." She answered with a poem:

*"One sip of jade nectar stirs a hundred feelings,
Pounding the black frost away, Cloud Maiden appears.
Blue Bridge is the very grotto of immortals—
Why climb the rugged path to the Jade Capital?"*

Later, passing through Lanqiao Station, he grew parched with thirst. At a thatched cottage, an old woman was spinning hemp. He bowed and begged for a drink. The woman said, "Cloud Maiden, bring a bowl of water." Hang took it and drank—it was pure jade liquid. He said to the old woman, "Your granddaughter is stunningly beautiful. I wish to marry her." The woman replied, "I am old and ill, and this is my granddaughter. The immortals left a dose of medicine, but it requires a jade mortar and pestle to pound it for a hundred days before it is ready. If you wish to marry her, you need only bring the jade mortar and pestle. Gold and silk are of no use to me." Hang departed in frustration.

A month later, he obtained the mortar and pestle. Returning to Lanqiao, the old woman untied the pouch at her waist and handed him the medicine. Hang began to pound it. That night, he peeked in and saw a jade hare holding the pestle, its snow-bright radiance illuminating the room. When the hundred days were complete, the old woman swallowed the medicine and said, "I shall enter the grotto to prepare the bedchamber for Master Pei." Soon, a grand mansion appeared, and immortal youths and maidservants led Hang inside. Among the assembled kin, all were immortals. One woman, claiming to be his wife’s elder sister, said, "Do you not recall meeting me on the same boat at Ezhu, sailing to Xiang and Han?" Those around her said, "This is Lady Yunqiao, wife of the Heavenly Master Liu Gang, and scribe to the Jade Emperor." Hang took his wife into the Jade Peak Grotto, where they consumed the cinnabar snow and jade blossom elixirs, attaining the rank of Supreme Immortals.

The crow nested in the mulberry, the snail peered from its shell.

From the *Unofficial Records of Xiangshan*: During the days when the Ancestral Founder lay hidden in obscurity, he once traveled the passes and rivers with a Daoist. The Daoist had no fixed name, calling himself "Chaotic Warrior." Whenever they lacked funds, he would reach into his sleeve and draw out gold, the more he took, the more it appeared. The three of them often drank to riotous intoxication. The Daoist was skilled at singing, performing *Step Void* as a game, and could extend his voice into the distant void, producing sounds of pure subtlety. At times, two lines of verse would drift down with the wind, heard only by the Ancestral Founder:

*"Golden monkey, tiger’s head—four,
The true dragon attains the true throne."*

When asked upon waking, he would say, "Merely drunken ramblings. How can they be trusted?" On the day he received the abdication and the Mandate, it was the fourth day of the first month of the *gengshen* year. Once enthroned, the Daoist was never seen again. Edicts were issued to search for him throughout the land. Some claimed to have seen him on the road to Bianyuan, or between Song and Luo. Sixteen years later, in the *yihai* year of the Kaibao era, during the Shangsi Festival, the emperor visited the Western Pond. The Daoist sat drunk beneath the shade of a tree by the shore. Smiling, he bowed to Taizu and said, "I am glad to see you well since we parted." The emperor rejoiced greatly and swiftly sent attendants to secretly bring him to the inner palace, fearing he might flee. He hastily returned and met with him. The Daoist was as before, and they clapped hands and drank heartily.

The emperor said, "I have long wished to ask you one thing. How many years remain in my allotted lifespan?" The Daoist replied, "If the night of the twentieth day of the tenth month is clear, you may extend it by another twelve years. If not, you must make swift preparations." The emperor pressed him to stay, lodging him in the rear gardens. The garden officials sometimes saw him spending the night in the treetops, in a crow’s nest.

From the *Soushen Ji*: Xie Duan found a large conch by the riverside in his village and took it home, keeping it in a jar. One day, he glimpsed into his house and saw a maiden emerge from the jar, going to the hearth to kindle the fire. Duan asked her, and she replied, "I am the White Water Immortal Maiden from the Heavenly Han. The Celestial Emperor pitied you for being orphaned young and diligently guarding your virtue, so he sent me to temporarily tend to your cooking and hearth. In a few years, you will grow wealthy and find a wife, and then I shall return. Yet you secretly spied on me, and now that my form has been seen, I can no longer stay. I must leave you, but I shall leave this shell behind—remember this as the tale of *Sha Lu* and *Pei Yi at Lan Bridge*."

From the *Xianzhuan Shiyi*: He Danyang, a man of Longyou, served as a Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat during the late Han. Between the reigns of Emperors Ai and Ping, the imperial house declined, and he said to others, "Today’s affairs are not governed by human effort, for they are ordained by the cycles of fate. Long ago, when *Sha Lu* collapsed, one who knew the numbers foretold: *Five hundred years later, a sagely woman of Qi shall rise.* Now, the Chancellor is a descendant of the Tian clan of Qi, and the sagely empress is destined for this era—to overthrow the Han mandate and establish the Qi dynasty. This is the appointed time." Thereupon, he abandoned worldly ambitions for the mountains and forests, seeking transcendence. He often consumed pine pollen, which made his body light and his eyes bright.

He then resigned his office and withdrew into seclusion, dwelling among the renowned mountains of Shu. The Supreme Perfected of Great Peace descended to transmit to him the Dao of climbing the celestial pole and riding the dragon, after which he ascended to immortality.

According to the records: Pei Hang hired a boat on the Xiang and Han rivers. Aboard the same vessel was Lady Fan, a woman of peerless beauty. Pei sent a poem to her maid, Niaoyan, which read:
*Though north and south share this boat, longing lingers still,*
*How much more when a heavenly immortal stands beyond the brocade screen?*
*Should you ascend to the Jade Capital for the morning audience,*
*I would follow the phoenix and crane into the azure void.*

The lady replied, "My husband resides south of the Han. I pray you do not take these playful words to heart. Though we share a slight affinity now, we may yet become kin in the future." She answered with a poem:
*One sip of jade nectar stirs a hundred feelings,*
*Pounding away the black frost, Cloud Maiden appears at last.*
*The Blue Bridge is the very grotto of immortals—*
*Why climb the rugged path to the Jade Capital?*

Later, passing the Blue Bridge post station, Pei grew parched with thirst. At a thatched cottage, an old woman spun hemp. He bowed and begged for a drink. The woman said, "Cloud Maiden, bring a bowl of water." Pei took it and drank—it was pure jade liquid. He said to the old woman, "Your granddaughter is breathtakingly lovely. I wish to marry her." The woman replied, "This old, ailing one has this granddaughter, left with an immortal’s medicine—a single *daogui* measure. It must be pounded in a jade mortar for a hundred days before it is ready. If you wish to marry her, you need only bring the jade mortar and pestle. Gold and silk are of no use to me." Pei departed in frustration.

A month later, he obtained the mortar and pestle. Returning to the Blue Bridge, the old woman untied her sash to receive the medicine. Pei pounded it for her. That night, he peeked in and saw a jade hare holding the pestle, its snow-bright radiance illuminating the room. When the hundred days were complete, the old woman swallowed the medicine and said, "I shall enter the grotto to prepare the bridal chamber for Master Pei." Soon, a grand mansion appeared, and immortal youths and maidservants led Pei inside. Among the divine kin was a woman who said, "Do you not recall meeting me on the same boat at Ezhu, sailing to the Xiang and Han?" Those around her said, "This is Lady Yunqiao, wife of the Heavenly Master Liu Gang, and a scribe for the Jade Emperor." Pei entered the Jade Peak Grotto with his wife, where they consumed the cinnabar snow and jade blossom elixirs, attaining the rank of supreme immortals.

The *Wild Records of Xiangshan* states: During the days when the Ancestral Founder’s glory was still hidden, he once traveled the passes and rivers with a Daoist. The Daoist gave no fixed name, calling himself "Chaotic Warrior." Whenever they lacked funds, he would reach into his sleeve and draw out gold, which only multiplied the more he took. The three often drank to raucous intoxication. The Daoist was skilled at singing, performing the *Step of Emptiness* as a game, and could extend his voice into the distant void, producing a sound of pure subtlety. At times, two lines of verse would drift down with the wind, audible only to the Ancestral Founder:
*Golden monkey, tiger’s head—four,*
*The true dragon attains its true position.*

When asked upon waking, the Daoist dismissed it as drunken babble, saying, "How could such words be trusted?" Yet on the day he received the abdication of the mandate—it was the fourth day of the first month of the *gengshen* year—he ascended the throne. Afterward, he never saw the Daoist again, though he issued edicts to search for him far and wide. Some claimed to have spotted him on the road to Bianyuan or in the region of Song and Luo.

Sixteen years later, in the *yihai* year of the *Kaibao* era, during the Shangsi Festival, the emperor visited the Western Pond. There, beneath the shade of a tree by the bank, the Daoist sat drunk, laughing as he bowed to Taizu. Overjoyed, the emperor swiftly sent attendants to secretly bring him to the inner palace, fearing he might vanish. He hastily returned and met with him as before, clapping hands and drinking heartily. The emperor said, "I have long wished to ask you one thing—how many years remain in my allotted lifespan?" The Daoist replied, "If the night of the twentieth day of the tenth month is clear, you may extend it by another twelve years. If not, you must make swift preparations." The emperor pressed him to stay, lodging him in the rear gardens. The garden officials sometimes saw him spending the night in the treetops, in a magpie’s nest.

From *Soushen Ji* (Records of the Search for Spirits):

Xie Duan found a large conch by the riverside in his village and took it home, keeping it in a jar. One day, he peered into his house and saw a maiden emerge from the jar to light the hearth. Duan asked her who she was, and she replied, "I am the White Water Maiden of the Celestial River. The Heavenly Emperor pitied you for being orphaned young and diligently guarding your integrity, so he sent me to temporarily tend to your cooking and hearth. In a few years, you will grow wealthy and take a wife, and then I must return. But you have now secretly spied on me, and my form has been revealed—it is no longer fitting for me to stay. I shall leave you, but I will leave this shell behind. After offering it to a monastery for almsgiving, use it to provide meals for poor scholars."

A destitute scholar, having received a meal, did not leave. Instead, he searched the courtyard, gazing all around, and calmly said to Tan Yu, "Though I am poor, I am always moved by your reverence’s offerings. Today, I have a small gift to bestow—may I ask for one person to accompany me?" Tan Yu did not believe him, but after repeated pleas, he sent a humble, ascetic monk to follow. Together, they walked beyond the city’s north gate.

After traveling over fifteen *li*, they stopped at a small inn. Inside the room, there was nothing but two empty beds. That night, they lodged at the inn, and the scholar asked about the number of monks in the monastery and the renovations of its halls. The monk replied, "If we speak of repairs to the monastery’s halls, they would require no less than a thousand *sheng* of funds."

The scholar then rose, lit a fire beneath the bed, and broke open several corners of a tile. From his bag, he took out medicine and, by lamplight, applied it. Gradually, the radiant light transformed everything into gold. He weighed out ten *jin* and gave it to the monk, saying, "Use this for repairs. Guard it well and do not take it lightly." At dawn, he bid farewell and vanished, never to be seen again.

A song of harmonious melody was sung, and the verses of Duan Gu’s lament echoed.

*The Continuation of the Immortals’ Biographies*: Lan Caihe, of unknown origin, often wore a tattered indigo robe, a wooden clog belt, and a single boot. He would sing in the marketplace, holding a clapper board to beg from passersby. Young and old followed him, their laughter harmonizing in delight, though he seemed mad yet not quite mad. His song went:

*Step and sing, step and sing,*
*Lan Caihe—*
*How long does a life endure?*
*Youth blooms but a spring on the tree,*
*Years cast like dice in play.*
*The ancients, once gone, never return;*
*The living come in endless array.*
*At dawn, riding simurghs to the azure vault,*
*At dusk, seeing mulberry fields turn to white waves.*
*Eternal light gleams in the void,*
*Golden palaces tower, jagged and high.*

One day, as he sang and danced by the bridge at Haoliang, he ascended on clouds from a tavern’s upper floor, leaving behind his robe, boot, and clapper board.

*The Expanded Record of Marvels*: Duan Gu, a native of Xuzhou, repeatedly sat for the imperial examinations and came from a wealthy family. Later, he suddenly grew erratic, donning a scholar’s cap and a plain cloth robe with a white silver belt. He wandered the streets day and night, chanting:

*...A thatched hut, still under repair,*
*Yet the wind howls, tearing the eaves,*
*Rafters sag, beams tilt—*
*Soon, soon it will collapse!*
*At the words “collapse,” he would repeat them three or five times before stopping.*
*The walls crumble to a heap of dust,*
*The master never returns home.*

Whenever he came and went, dozens of idle youths from the alleys followed, echoing his words. People dismissed him as mad, thinking nothing of it. In the final years of the Qingli era, he fell ill and died, his body temporarily interred in the wild. Years later, when his grave was opened for proper burial, only an empty coffin remained.

King Zhao of Yan, free of desire, Zi Xiu ashamed of his mother.
*Miscellaneous Records of the Zi Year*: King Zhao of Yan dozed off and dreamed of a feather-clad immortal who spoke to him. When asked about the path to transcendence, the immortal replied, “Your great wisdom and essence remain unopened. To seek longevity and eternal vision is impossible.” The king knelt and begged to receive the teaching of absolute desirelessness. The immortal traced a finger across the king’s heart, which split open at his touch. The king awoke in shock, his blood soaking the mat. Thereafter, he stilled his mind and dismissed all music and pleasures. Within ten days, the immortal from his dream reappeared and said, “I first sought to replace your heart.” He produced a green silk pouch, the size of a hand, containing *Luminous Cinnabar for Mending the Spleen* and *Essence Powder for Nourishing Blood*. With his hand, he massaged the king’s chest, and in an instant, the wound healed. The king begged for the medicine, storing it in a royal jar sealed with golden cords. When applied to his feet, it allowed him to soar beyond the earth for ten thousand miles as if strolling a foot’s distance. Those who obtained and consumed it would outlive heaven and age no more.

*The Inner Biography of Dongfang Shuo*: When Qin conquered the six states, the essence of Venus, the Weaver Girl’s handmaiden Liang Yuqing, and her companion Wei Chengzhuang fled into the Small Immortal Grotto of Yaocheng, where they remained for forty-six days. Enraged, the Heavenly Emperor ordered the Five Peaks to search and capture them. Venus returned to its place, but Wei Chengzhuang escaped. Liang Yuqing had a son named Zi Xiu, and she was banished to the eternal spring beneath the Northern Dipper. Her son was betrothed to the River Earl, tasked with riding the clouds and summoning rain. Yet whenever Zi Xiu reached the Small Immortal Grotto, he felt shame at the place of his mother’s illicit flight, turning his chariot away. Thus, that land was often deprived of rain.

*Records of the Immortals’ Assemblies, Scroll One* concludes.
*Records of the Immortals’ Assemblies, Scroll Two* begins.

Chen Baoguang of the Orthodox Unity Dao compiled this collection.

Yang Jun, Controller of Destiny, and Zi Jin, Attendant of the Celestial Court.

*The True Sayings* records: Yang Xi, a native of Jurong, was spiritually attuned from childhood. He formed a bond of divine friendship with the two Xus, and after attaining the Dao and becoming a perfected immortal, the immortals descended repeatedly to transmit their teachings to him. The Perfected Consort of Nine Flowers admonished him, saying: "Those who revel in the flourishing of worldly dust are but lowly ghosts hastening toward death, their aged frames burdened with sin. Wealth and indulgence in luxury are the axe and saw that sever the bones, much like the carts and boats that bear the condemned." Thereafter, the host of perfected immortals descended without fail, day after day. After twenty years, Yang Jun ascended to heaven in broad daylight upon a cloud-borne crane, where he was appointed Perfected Controller of Destiny of Huayang.

*The Divine Immortals’ Biographies of the Wang Clan* states: Wang Qiao, styled Zi Jin, was the crown prince of King Ling of Zhou. Born with divine intelligence, he loved the Dao from childhood. Fond of playing the sheng to mimic the cry of the phoenix, white cranes and vermilion phoenixes would gather around him. Later, he met Master Fuqiu, who imparted to him the essentials of the Dao. Taken to Mount Song, he never returned. One day, he suddenly alighted upon a crane atop the mountain’s peak, and a children’s rhyme spread: *"Prince Wang Qiao, fond of divine immortals, on the seventh day of the seventh month ascends to heaven as an honored guest."* Initially, he was appointed Attendant of the Celestial Court as Controller of Destiny of the Southern Marchmount, and later promoted to Perfected Lord of the Paulownia Minister.

Modest in his master’s rank, his Dao soared among the perfected immortals.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: The Daoist Kou Qianzhi secluded himself on Mount Songyang to cultivate and refine his practice. The Most High Lord of the Dao descended, and the Immortal Elder Wang Chuping led Kou Qianzhi forward, saying: "I have received the memorial from the Lord of the Central Marchmount: Since Celestial Master Zhang ascended as a perfected immortal, those who perform good deeds have had no master to guide them. Now, the Daoist Kou Qianzhi’s conduct aligns with the natural order; he is fit to assume the master’s rank."

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Daoxiang was the style of the third son of the Chief Scribe Xu. He cast aside worldly affairs to devote himself wholly to the supreme Dao, and the Chief Scribe held him in high esteem. Profoundly attuned to the numinous and the true, he formed a deep bond with his master. Now, he resides in the Eastern Flower as a perfected immortal, where he has been entrusted with texts and appointed Attendant of the Celestial Court.

Yu the Elder refined the corporeal soul, while Xia Fu refined the ethereal soul.

*The Accounts from the Hall of Manifestation* records: During the Tang dynasty, when Lord Wang Qian governed Jingnan, a young man of the Lü clan, impoverished and destitute, sought an audience with him. The lord paid him no heed. After lodging at an inn for over a month, the young man, in dire straits, sold his donkey in the marketplace. The market warden, Yu the Scribe, summoned him and inquired about his circumstances. The young man replied: "My family is from north of the Wei River. Poor and with elderly parents, I came here because Lord Wang is my maternal uncle of the highest degree. Yet, though I have come from afar, he has not deigned to glance my way. Is this not my fate?" Yu said: "I see hunger in your face. Tonight, I shall prepare a meal for you; you may lodge beneath my roof." He then led him into a humble chamber, where they sat on a worn mat, and coarse rice was served in earthenware. That night, Yu spoke slowly to the young man: "I shall perform a minor rite to secure the funds for your return to Luoyang." He took a small jar, placed it on the ground, and after the time it takes to eat a meal, lifted it to reveal a figure about five inches tall, adorned with a purple sash and golden seal. Yu said: "This is the corporeal soul of Lord Wang." He admonished it: "Lü is your nephew by marriage, poor and come from afar. Yet you have not shown him the slightest courtesy—is this the way of kinship? You must bestow upon him ample gifts: a horse, a servant, and two hundred bolts of silk." The purple-robed figure nodded in assent. Yu then covered the jar again, and after a moment, the figure vanished. The next day, Lord Wang indeed summoned the young man for feasting and outings. After several months, the young man announced his departure, and the lord presented him with a servant, a horse, and two hundred bolts of silk. Upon returning north of the Wei River, the young man dared not speak of what had transpired, and only years later did he recount it to others.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Controller of Destiny said: "Xia Fu, from his youth, loved the Dao. He journeyed to Wu to seek out Master Red-Beard, who transmitted to him the method of refining the ethereal soul. Later, he encountered the Perfected Lord of the Paulownia Minister and attained the Dao. Now, he dwells among the immortals in the grotto-heavens."

Daorong burned his undergarments; Huizong piled the firewood.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: The Daoist Gou Daorong, of unknown origin, was renowned in Shu. He befriended Lü Yi, the magistrate of Huayang, and declared: "On the day of my departure from this world, come to the great pine in the eastern outskirts and burn my coffin with firewood as a kindness." Lü Yi, along with his friends Zhang Sheng and Chang Yao, and several dozen others, marked the date to await the event. The evening before the appointed day, Daorong visited the homes of his close friends, drinking, laughing, and conversing.

As dusk fell, he lodged at an inn. Lü Yi secretly observed him and saw that his repose was as usual. At dawn, he had already transformed, yet his complexion remained unchanged. Thereupon, they prepared a coffin and undergarments, conveying him to the great pine in the eastern outskirts. When the firewood was arranged and the flames ignited, the coffin blazed with such intensity that none could draw near. Daorong emerged above the smoke and flames, ascending gently into the void.

Another was Zhao Huizong, who at the end of the Tianbao era suddenly piled firewood in the eastern part of the commandery and immolated himself. Officials and commoners gathered to witness, and Huizong sat serenely amidst the fire, reciting the *Scripture of Salvation*. In an instant, he transformed into auspicious clouds and immortal cranes. When the fire subsided, the grass beneath remained verdant. Two poems were found among his posthumous writings. The first read:

You bore me from the void,
Placed me in nonbeing.
The purest essence becomes spirit,
The primordial nothing, the body.
Scattered yang becomes light,
Conjoined yin becomes tally.
Form turns to ash and earth,
Spirit joins the immortals.
All filth shall end,
All affairs forever cease.

The second read:

I ride the steed of time,
Sun and moon as my escort.
Leaping through the nine skies,
I ascend to audience with the Heavenly Emperor.
Brightly shine, my assembly,
And my disciples too.
The false Dao nurtures form,
The true Dao nurtures spirit.
Diligently, diligently—
I have nothing more to say.
Xu Diao anoints the heart,
Qian Lang mends the brain.

*The Continuation of the Biographies of Immortals* records: Xu Diao, of unknown origin, styled himself the "Angler of Penglai." He often wore a gourd at his waist, poled a small boat across the five lakes, and exchanged his catch for wine, returning to chant and recite. If he encountered the sick, he would take a pill no larger than a sesame seed and instruct them to apply it with wine over the heart—all would recover. When asked whether the medicine could be ingested, he would not answer.

He replied: "It may be ingested, but I fear it would be monk’s fare." Some meddlesome fellow swallowed it and naturally ceased eating—only then did people believe him. One day, he vanished without a trace.

Qian Lang, having passed the imperial examinations, held successive eminent posts, and wherever he governed, he left behind fond memories. Later, he resigned his office and entered Mount Lu, where he encountered a master who taught him the art of *returning to the origin and mending the brain*. At the age of one hundred and fifty, his complexion remained that of a child. Several of his great-grandsons entered officialdom, all with hoary heads. One day, Lang took leave of them, saying: "I have dwelt in the world for many years, but now the Supreme Clarity has summoned me—I must depart." Thereupon, he dissolved into transformation and departed.

Long Bogao of Fangtai, Xi Xuanjie of the True Isle.
*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: The Eastern Minister Lord said: Long Bogao was a man of the Han. The General of the Vanquishing Waves admonished his brother’s son, praising this man’s excellence as worthy of emulation. Later, Bogao received the method of *embryonic breathing* from the immortal Diao Daolin. Feigning death in a drunken stupor, he concealed himself on Fangtai.

*The Extensive Records* states: Xi Xuanjie grew old yet retained a youthful countenance. Emperor Xianzong, marveling at this, summoned and asked him: "Master, though advanced in years, your complexion shows no sign of age—how is this?" He replied: "Your servant has long consumed *lingzhi* upon the sea, and thus it is so." Thereupon, he carved wood into the Three Isles of the sea, adorning them with pearls and jade. The emperor, gazing upon them, exclaimed: "Were you not an immortal of the highest order, you could not have attained such a realm!" Xuanjie said: "The Three Isles lie but a footstep away—allow me to take Your Majesty on a tour." He then concealed himself and entered, gradually diminishing in size until he vanished entirely. The emperor sighed in wonder and named the mountain *True Isle*.

Yin Sheng the Beggar, Han Kun the Impoverished Daoist.
*The Biographies of the Immortals* records: Yin Sheng was a beggar of Chang’an. He often begged in the marketplace, but the people despised and reviled him, even dousing him with filth—yet his clothes remained unstained. Suspecting him of sorcery, they imprisoned him, but he remained as before. Travelers in Chang’an sang a song: "Give the beggar fine wine, lest your house be ruined." Liu Xiang said: Yin Sheng, the beggar, was spurned for his importunity; few recognized his truth. Though shackled and shamed, to me he was untainted—calamity befell their homes instead.

*The Extensive Records* states: Han Kunzi concealed himself on Mount Tiantai, fond of reciting poetry filled with lines on the seclusion of mountains and forests. Master Tongzhi compiled and prefaced his verses, circulating them in the world. During the Xiantong era, he called upon Li He. Seeing his tattered robes, Li treated him with disdain. The next day, the old man returned clad in fine attire, riding a white horse, and Li received him with great courtesy. The elder said: "Do you know of Han Kunzi?" Li replied: "I do." The old man said: "This poor Daoist is he. I thought you might be teachable, but now I see otherwise—you have not yet entered the gate." He continued: "Cultivate the heart within, restrain the body without—thus one avoids transgression. Know softness and guard humility—thus one secures the self. Attribute faults to oneself—thus virtue accumulates. Only thus may one hope to attain the Dao." With that, he whipped his horse and departed.

Xi Fu Refining Melons, Meng Jie Holding Dates.
*The Biographies of the Immortals* records: Xi Fu dwelled in the mountains, where an immortal often came to sell melons at his home. The immortal taught him the method of refining melon seeds, instructing him to consume them at the vernal equinox. After twenty years, he could ascend mountains and enter water. At over a hundred years of age, he ceased dwelling on the mountain’s peak, calling out to his father to speak of matters before departing.

*The Unofficial History of the Western Han* states: Meng Jie was a man of the Western Han, versed in the Dao’s arts. By holding a single date pit in his mouth, he could go ten years without hunger. He could also hold his breath, his body unmoving, for over a year. Scholars and commoners revered him as a divine immortal. Later, he entered the mountains and never emerged.

Shi He with One Meal, Qingjing with Nine Repasts.
*The Biography of the Perfected Lord of the Western Mountains* records: The Perfected Lord, named He, was a native of Julu. In his youth, he entered the Four Bright Mountains, where an immortal taught him the alchemical formula for transmuting gold and jade. He relieved the suffering of the destitute, and the people received his bounty. Later, he could expel malevolent spirits and command ghosts and gods. He was known for his filial piety toward his mother, mastered *embryonic breathing*, and attained the method of *sitting in forgetfulness*. Sometimes he ate but once in a hundred days or slept but once in half a year. Emperor Ming of Jin treated him with great favor. When Master Xu the Perfected ascended, his teacher followed him into heaven.

*The Biographies of the Divine Immortals* records: The Master of Qingjing was a thousand years old yet had the complexion of a child. He could walk five hundred *li* in a day, go a year without eating, or consume nine meals in a single day.

The Three Realms of the Heavenly Master, the Nine Altars of Lan Sheng.
The *Original Biography* states: Zhang Daoling was the sixth-generation descendant of the Marquis of Liu.

He was recommended as a candidate of *worthy, good, upright, and square* yet, though he held office, his heart lay in refining his form. Thus, he retired to seclude himself in the Northern Deng Mountains. Emperor Zhang summoned him with a third-rank seal and cord, but he declined. Entering Mount Song, he encountered a divine person who told him: "Within a stone chamber lies the *Yellow Emperor’s Alchemical Canon*, sealed in a jade casket with a jasper clasp—you shall obtain it by following the ringing bell." The Master followed the sound and indeed found the book. Thereupon, he built an altar to worship the Perfected and refined the Nine Elixirs. When the elixirs were complete, he said to his disciple Wang Chang: "To ingest the elixir is to ascend to heaven, yet I have not accomplished great merit. How could I dare consume it hastily? I should first eliminate harm and promote benefit for the state, and only then take it. Thus, my service to the Three Realms will be without shame."

*The Biography of Ling Sheng* records: In the early *Jianlong* era of the present dynasty, the Perfected Lord Ling Sheng descended and told Zhang Shouzhen: "The altar rites comprise nine tiers. The upper three are established for the state, the middle three for officials, and the lower three for the common people. Each of the nine tiers has its own ceremonial forms."

The *Five Viscera* of Xuanfu, the *Three Passes* of Shuqi.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Wang Xuanfu was taught by an immortal the method of *swallowing solar essence*. After thirty-four years of practice, he could inwardly perceive his five viscera and write in darkness at midnight. When his Dao was accomplished, the Most High dispatched a feathered chariot to welcome Xuanfu. Riding clouds and driving dragons, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Now, he resides in the *Mystic Orchard Terrace*, transformed into the Perfected of the Central Marchmount.

Furthermore, Zhao Shuqi studied the Dao on Mount Wangwu. He encountered a diviner who said: "If you wish to enter the Gate of Heaven, visit the Three Passes, visualize the Vermilion Bird, and align with Kunlun." Shuqi found this extraordinary and bowed, entreating for the essential instructions. The diviner presented him with a scroll, saying: "The Three Passes are: the mouth as the Heavenly Pass, the feet as the Earthly Pass, and the hands as the Human Pass. When the Three Passes are harmonized, the five viscera are at peace; when the five viscera are at peace, the entire body is free of illness, and the immortal Dao is achieved."

The Dao Lord bestowed a sword; the Jade Maiden offered a ring.

*The Original Biography* states: When the Heavenly Master’s work was complete, the Most High Dao Lord descended and conferred upon him a pair of male and female swords, each inscribed with the patterns of the sun, moon, and stars. The Dao Lord said: "I pity the beings of the Lower Realm, bound and entangled as wandering souls, with humans and ghosts intermingled. Now, you shall divide them into the Five Quarters, separating humans and ghosts into distinct positions. Your merit shall be immeasurable."

Moreover, when the Heavenly Master reached Renshou County, he encountered twelve celestial jade maidens, each presenting him with a jade ring, wishing to serve him. The Master combined them into a single ring and said: "I shall cast this into the earth. Whoever retrieves it first may keep it." The maidens scrambled to take it, but the deeper they grasped, the further it sank, until it was restrained and would not emerge. It transformed into a salt well, from which both public and private parties drew benefit. The county was henceforth named Ling Prefecture, beginning with Daoling.

The Holy Mother pierced the clouds; Zhou Sheng plucked the moon.

*The Extensive Records* states: The Holy Mother was a native of Hailing and married into the Du family as a mother. She encountered someone who could alter her form and transform her appearance, but her husband did not believe her and instead accused her of sorcery. He reported her to the authorities, and she was imprisoned. Yet, she flew out through the window, and people saw her piercing the clouds as she departed. She left behind a single silk shoe beneath the window. The people of Hailing built a shrine for her, calling it the *Shrine of the Holy Mother*.

*The Accounts of the Xuan Chamber* records: Zhou Sheng possessed Daoist arts and traveled through Wu and Chu, where many revered him. Once, he arrived in Guangling during a Mid-Autumn gathering. The moonlight was radiant and clear, and the assembled guests spoke of Emperor Minghuang’s journey to the Lunar Palace. Zhou Sheng smiled and said: "I once studied under a master and can also retrieve the moon." He then took several hundred bamboo poles and lashed them together, saying: "I shall use this ladder to fetch the moon." He closed the door for a long while, and the guests waited in the courtyard. Suddenly, the sky and earth turned pitch black, and upon looking up, not a wisp of cloud was to be seen. Soon after, they heard Sheng call out: "I have arrived!" He lifted the hem of his robe, revealing the moon by half an inch, illuminating the entire room. The cold penetrated to the bone, but after the time it takes to eat a meal, all returned to normal.

Shang sang *Yangchun*; Zhang chanted *Baixue*.

*The History of Poetry* states: Shang Qiqi possessed extraordinary arts. Passing through Runzhou, he drank with guests and said: "I have a skill to entertain you." He then turned to a painted woman on the screen and said: "You may sing the *Yangchun* melody." The woman responded at once and began to sing. Her voice was clear and resonant, as if emerging from the screen itself. She sang: "Sorrowful to hear *Yangchun* sung, it knots the wanderer’s heart. My love has gone and not returned; the willows drift like fragrant snow." She performed over ten such songs.

The *Preface to the Wuzhen Pian* states: Zhang Boduan, styled Pingshu, of Tiantai, exhausted his attainments and composed eighty-one regulated poems, titled *The Wuzhen Pian*. Much of the text is not recorded here. One of his poems, *The Ninefold Transmutation of Golden Fluid and Returned Elixir*, reads:
*"Yellow Sprout and White Snow are hard to find;*
*The adept must rely on deep virtue and conduct.*
*The Four Symbols and Five Phases wholly depend on Earth;*
*How could the Three Primes and Eight Trigrams depart from Water?*
*Refined into numinous substance, none recognize it;*
*Dissolving all yin demons, no ghost may invade.*
*Should you seek to leave the secret formula among men,*
*You’ll not meet a single one who is a true friend."*

Zhang beheld towers and terraces; Feng ascended palace gates.

*The Miscellaneous Notes from the Northern Dream* states: Zhang Jianzhang was fond of classics and history, always cherishing purity and coolness. Once, while traveling to the Bohai Sea, he encountered a storm. A green-clad youth led him ashore and up a mountain. On the island, he beheld resplendent towers and terraces, where immortal maidens resided, each attended by a grand retinue. After a brief stay, they said: "You do not deceive in the dark chamber; you may be called a gentleman of antiquity." They then ordered a green lad to escort him back.

*The Extensive Records* states: Feng Nü was young and abstained from food, her heart yearning for purity and emptiness. Her parents dismissed her words as nonsense. One day, she suddenly saw immortals in the sky, traveling from south to north for over a thousand *li*, conjuring golden cities and jade towers atop a mountain. One figure beckoned her to ascend the palace gates, where a host of immortals stood in solemn array. They said: "You possess the bone record of an immortal and shall become a Perfected of the Upper Realm. The Most High has commanded us to confer upon you the *True Writ of the Numinous Treasure*. Practice it accordingly, and your ascension shall come in time."

When the appointed time arrived, she indeed ascended into the void.

**Dwelling in Grotto-Chambers: The Cave of Xu Gu**
*The Records* state: Xu Qikun passed the imperial examination but aspired to cultivation. Once, while traveling to Shu, he ascended a perilous plank path when suddenly both he and his horse plunged beneath it. Unable to advance or retreat, he followed his horse until they reached a grotto-chamber, where he saw immortals arrayed in ranks. All rejoiced, saying: "This is the grandson of the Prefectural Governor—he bears the physiognomy of an immortal." The perfected ones bade him sit and offered him a drink, saying: "This is stone marrow. You have obtained it—guard it well, neither leaking its secret nor indulging in dissipation. We shall meet again later." Then they sent him on his way with the horse he had ridden, saying: "This is the dragon of our grotto, punished to bear burdens. You possess immortal bones, so you were destined to encounter it. When you return to the world of men, release it to go wherever it pleases." Later, when Xu Qikun happened to pass by his former home, the horse transformed into a dragon and soared away.

*The Extensive Records* state: The immortal maiden Xu was several hundred years old yet appeared no older than twenty. She often wandered sacred mountains, sometimes lodging in forest groves or cave-dwellings. Traveling through the Jiangnan region, she was seen by the people of Wu for thirty or forty years, her complexion unchanged, her steps swift as flight. During the Xiantong era, she arrived in Kè County and told someone: "My late father served in the Northern Qi and accumulated hidden merit, which has now extended to me, granting me prolonged years." Later, people investigated this and realized the maiden was none other than the daughter of Chancellor Xu Zicai.

**Virtue Illumines the Five Peaks; the Mighty Dao Roams the Nine Doubts**
*The True Sayings* record: The Lord of the Eastern Ministerium said: Song Dexuan lived in the time of King Xuan of Zhou. By ingesting the *Six Jia Talismans of the Numinous Flight*, he attained the Dao, walking three thousand *li* in a day and transforming his form at will. Now he dwells on Mount Song, roaming the Five Peaks. Also, Han Weidao, of unknown origin, followed Song Dexuan in and out, serving him as his master. Dexuan transmitted the Daoist arts to him, and now that he has achieved the Way, he often enters and leaves the Nine Doubts Mountains.

**Xu Fu and the White Deer; the Recluse and the Yellow Oriole**
*The Extensive Records* state: The First Emperor of Qin dispatched Xu Fu with three thousand boys and girls to the Eastern Sea in search of the herb of immortality, but they never returned. Later, when Shen Xi attained the Dao, the Yellow Emperor sent Xu Fu in a white deer-drawn carriage to welcome Master Shen the Perfected—only then did people learn that Xu Fu had achieved the Way. Also, Yuan Cangji styled himself the Recluse Yuan. During the Daye era of the Sui, while on a mission across the sea, he encountered divine beings who detained him in a foreign land, where he traversed immortal realms. One day, longing for home, he was swiftly conveyed back, arriving in Donglai in less than ten days. When he inquired about the land, he found it was now the Great Tang. Searching for his descendants, he found no one—only two birds resembling yellow orioles accompanied him in and out, soaring in the sky and descending at his call, able to convey speech from their beaks.

**Pei Chen’s Joyous Reunion; Orchid Fragrance’s Mystic Tryst**
*The Extensive Records* state: Pei Chen once befriended Wang Jingbo and Liang Fang as fellow seekers beyond the world, entering the mountains to study the Dao. After Liang Fang died, Jingbo descended the mountain to take office. During the Zhengyuan era, while on a mission to Huainan, he chanced upon Pei Chen. Mooring his boat, he greeted him: "What do you need?" Chen replied: "We are rustics, our hearts as free as clouds and cranes. West of Guangling lies my dwelling." Suddenly, he poled his boat away. Jingbo visited the dwelling and saw Chen, resplendent in robes and cap, hosting a feast. As Chen grew merry with wine, he told his attendants: "This man was once my companion in the mountains. His resolve for the Dao was not steadfast, and he harmed himself with worldly brilliance, drifting in the sea of birth and death, seeking the shore in vain. Today’s joyous reunion is truly rare—let him depart now."

Also, a fisherman by the Xiang River heard the whimper of a small child. Looking around, he saw no one—only a girl of about three. He took her home and raised her for over a decade, her beauty and bearing extraordinary. One day, a green lad descended from the sky, took the girl away, and told the fisherman: "I am the immortal maiden Du Lanxiang, sent to the mortal world for a transgression. My allotted time has ended—I depart now."

**The Banished Immortal Calls Rats; Master Zhu Raises Chickens**
*The Extensive Records* state: During the Yongming era, a recluse named Cai lived on Mount Zhong. He kept several dozen old rats, which came at his call and went at his command. His speech was strange, and people called him a banished immortal.

*The Biographies of the Immortals* state: Master Zhu was a man of Luo. Dwelling on North Mountain, he loved raising chickens. For over a hundred years, he kept a thousand fowl, each with a name. At dusk, they roosted in the trees; by day, he released them to scatter, and they returned when he called their names. He amassed a fortune of ten million coins, which he spent to dig a pond in Wu for raising fish. Ascending Mount Wu, he was often accompanied by hundreds of white cranes and peacocks.

**Li Jue’s Glittering Trade; An Gong’s Cold Meditation**
*The Continuation of the Immortals’ Biographies* states: Li Jue lived in the city of Guangling, making his living by selling salt. At fifteen, his father passed the trade to him. Li Jue measured out each sheng and dou himself, never considering the price’s rise or fall, yet his clothing and food were always abundant. At eighty, he did not abandon his trade. It so happened that Minister Li Jue was appointed military governor of Huainan, and the salt merchant changed his name to Kuan. One night, the minister dreamed he entered a grotto palace where a golden inscription bore the name Li Jue. Delighted, he suddenly saw two immortal lads emerge from a stone wall. Li Jue asked: "Where is this?" The lads replied: "This is the Huayang Grotto-Heaven. This name does not belong to you, my lord." The minister said: "If not mine, then whose?" The lads answered: "One of your subjects."

Li Jue awoke with realization and searched throughout the streets and alleys until he found one named Li Kuan. He welcomed him into the prefecture and bowed as an elder brother. When asked about the cultivation of the Dao, Kuan replied: "I know nothing of such practices." He recounted only his affairs in selling salt. The minister said: "This is a task most men find difficult—your hidden merit is beyond compare." Later, Kuan departed the world through *shijie*, shedding his mortal form like a cicada.

*Accounts of Immortals*: Tao Angong was a master smith who repeatedly conducted the firing process. One day, the flames suddenly scattered upward, their purple hue piercing the heavens. Angong prostrated himself beneath the furnace and pleaded for mercy. In an instant, a vermilion sparrow alighted upon the furnace and said: "Angong, Angong, your smelting has reached communion with Heaven. On the seventh day of the seventh month, a crimson dragon shall come to carry you away." When the appointed day arrived, the crimson dragon indeed appeared, and Angong mounted it to ascend into the heavens.

Ma Xiang’s paper tricks, Zhang Zhen’s clay steed.

*Further Accounts of Immortals*: Ma Xiang, styled Ziran, was a native of Qiantang. From youth, he loved literature and had the protection of the Dao. One day, passing a vegetable garden, he saw an abundance of radishes and begged for some. The gardener refused, so Xiang tore a piece of paper from his basket, fashioning it into a fox, then another into a heron. The heron flew into the garden while the fox chased after it, trampling all the vegetables to bits. Realizing Xiang was no ordinary man, the gardener knelt in apology. Xiang then retrieved the paper fox and heron, returning them to his basket—the vegetables appeared as before, entirely undamaged.

*The Master Embracing Simplicity*: Zhang Zhen lived during the reign of King You of Zhou. Though repeatedly summoned, he refused to serve. He studied under Master Chang Sang and mastered his teachings, able to divide his form and transform his shadow, turn blades of grass into dragons and tigers, and spray water into pearls and jade. One day, while traveling with his disciples, he molded clay into a horse and rode it, covering a thousand *li* in a day. Later, he entered Kongtong Mountain and ascended to the heavens in broad daylight.

The wife of Cheng provided silk; the mother of Su longed for fresh fish.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals*: The wife of Cheng Wei, a *qimen* officer, possessed divine transformations. When Wei was to accompany the imperial procession but lacked proper attire, he grew deeply anxious. His wife said, "Why fret over missing clothes when you must depart?" She then produced two bolts of silk, which suddenly appeared before him. Later, Wei attempted alchemical transmutation repeatedly but failed. His wife took a small measure of powder from her pouch, cast it into molten mercury and silver, and in an instant, it became silver. When Wei pressed her for the method, she refused, saying, "Your bones are not yet destined to receive it." When he persisted, she departed through *shijie* transformation.

*The Biography of Immortal Su*: The Immortal Lord, surnamed Su and named Dan, was a native of Bang County in Guiyang Commandery. Born during the Former Han, he lost his father in youth and served his mother, Lady Pan, with such filial devotion that his morning and evening care for her warmth and meals surpassed all others. He was once granted Daoist arts by divine immortals and could conceal his form and alter his appearance. One day, as he warmed his mother’s bed, she said, "I crave fresh fish. Go and prepare it." He replied, "As you wish." Picking up his chopsticks and pausing his meal, he took up gold and left. In a moment, he returned with the fish. His mother, still eating, was delighted and asked, "The market is so far—where did you obtain this so quickly?" He answered, "I bought it in Bian County." She said, "The mountain roads to Bian County are treacherous, a hundred and twenty *li* away. How could you return so swiftly? You deceive me." He replied, "When I bought the fish, I saw my uncle in the Bian market. He told me he would come here tomorrow. Wait for him to verify the truth." The next day, his uncle indeed arrived and recounted their meeting in the market. Only then did his mother realize he was no ordinary man and secretly observed him. She saw him always carrying a green bamboo staff, which all suspected to be a divine rod.

A Daoist with two mouths; the master drew ankles.

*Wang’s Records of Seen and Heard*: Liang Kuangzhi resided in Ezhou when a Daoist suddenly arrived. Kuangzhi drank with him, and the Daoist requested silk, which was given. The Daoist rolled it up and tossed it into his sleeve, saying, "Enter the sleeve." Though he tried again and again, nearly ten times, the silk would not enter. The Daoist sighed, "I cannot escape being Lord Kou of Lai." He then departed, promising to return. Over a month later, he came again. The gatekeeper sought to announce him, but the Daoist said, "No need to see the attendant gentleman. Just report that I have gone ahead." When Kuangzhi arrived later, he was demoted to Huazhou. Long after, a Daoist with two mouths—and a third on his belly—arrived at the hall. He demanded a *dou* of wine, drained it in one draught, and said to Kuangzhi, "Do you recall our meeting in Ezhou?" Though the voice was the same, his appearance was not. He then asked for twenty-seven coins and left.

The Daoist exited the gate, threading the eaves through his belly, and blew an iron flute with his mouth. He took a fishing boat and stood alone upon it, the wind carrying him across the river as he departed. Twenty-seven days later, Kuangzhi passed from this world.

*The Biographies of Daoist Scholars* states: Master Jianji, whose courtesy name was Xiude, was a native of Dongqian in Wuxing and a descendant of Sun Kai, Prime Minister of Wu. His mother, née Yao, dreamed during her pregnancy that an old woman told her, "The child you bear shall become a teacher of humans and gods." When he was born, his ankles bore cloud-like markings, and his palms were inscribed with large characters. Though born into a wealthy family and early engaged in marriage and officialdom, he once remarked to his colleagues, "Such an era is rare indeed." He then abandoned his wife and children, cast off worldly affairs, and devoted himself wholly to the teachings, never slackening in wakefulness or sleep. He chose to dwell on Mount Lu and was summoned to Jinling. One day, he said to his disciples, "I shall return to my former retreat." Soon after, he lay down and transformed, his skin radiant, an extraordinary fragrance suffusing the air. All the disciples in the mountains saw the Master returning to the mountain, his robes and appearance resplendent. They marveled, but in an instant, he vanished.

Fan Ying extinguished flames with water, Zhu Lun rode the mist on high.
*The Book of Han* records: Fan Ying, a native of Jinan, was skilled in divining the patterns of heaven and earth, penetrating the subtle and obscure. He secluded himself on the southern slope of Mount Hu, refusing all summons. Once, a violent wind arose from the west, and Ying said to his disciples, "A great fire rages in the city market." He then took water into his mouth, faced west, and sighed, noting the exact time. Later, a traveler from Shu Commandery arrived and reported that on that very day, a massive fire had broken out, but in an instant, a black cloud rose from the east, and a heavy rain extinguished the flames. Ying once said, "Master Fuqiu once traveled with me atop the Altar of Heaven." One day, he departed and was seen no more.

*The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Zhu Lun, styled Deyuan, held fast to the One without wavering. The Most High was moved to descend, revealing the treasures of the jade casket and bestowing upon him the elixir talisman, saying, "If you can cultivate the Supreme Dao with diligence and guard it with steadfastness, I shall ensure your ascension and transcendence, riding the mist in emptiness. Obedience shall bring blessings; negligence shall bring calamity. You must practice this faithfully and never transmit it lightly." When Zhu Lun attained the Dao, during the reign of King Jing, the Most High conferred upon him the scriptures and appointed him an immortal official of Mount Song. He carried the Dragon Staff of Holding the One and wielded the Serpent Whip of Clarity and Emptiness.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Zhao Baoyi was twelve years old when, while herding cattle, he encountered an old man who asked, "Are you hungry?" The boy merely nodded. The old man reached into his bag, took out food resembling a radish but sweet in taste, and gave it to him, along with a staff and a gourd. Inside the gourd was medicine—peas.

The medicine, when administered, cured all who suffered from deep-seated or recent ailments. The master himself consumed the radish-like food and no longer craved cooked meals. One day, wandering aimlessly, he arrived at Balou Monastery west of the capital. Passing the Nirvana Hall, he heard groans and asked who was in such distress. A monk replied, "Several novices have fallen gravely ill with an epidemic." The master took peas from his gourd, had them swallowed with fresh water, and immediately the patients broke into sweat as if freshly bathed; by evening, all had recovered. Thereafter, those seeking the medicine thronged like a marketplace, and its fame spread beyond the city walls.

At the time, Emperor Zhenzong had not yet returned from his eastern suburban sacrifice. Prime Minister Xiang, acting as regent in the capital, secretly sent men to verify the reports and swiftly memorialized the throne. When the imperial carriage returned, the emperor summoned the master and, delighted, patted his back, saying, "You share my surname." He bestowed imperial favor, tonsured him as a Daoist, and soon after granted his request to return home. The emperor presented him with a gold-inlaid dragon-headed staff, a bronze seal, a fragrant wooden cane, and medicinal herbs, dispatching the eunuch Zhang Maoxian and the Daoist Hu Taiyi to escort him to Mount Shimen. There, a True Serenity Abbey was specially built as his place of transcendence.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* records: Liao Chong, styled Qingxu, was a native of Lianshan Prefecture. Renowned for his talent and virtue, he served as the prefectural registrar. Later, he resigned his office, traveled in search of the essentials of the Dao, and on Mount Heng encountered the Perfected One of Great Peace, who transmitted the Way to him. Upon returning to his hometown, he often rode a tiger, wielding a snake as his whip. In the second year of the Xiantian era, amid darkening winds and clouds, he soared aloft and vanished.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Liu Bang, a native of Pei, rose from commoner status to overthrow Qin and pacify Xiang Yu, laying the foundation of Han. For his merit, the Celestial Emperor appointed him as an honored guest of the Southern Clarity Lord. Master Mao said: "Those whose ancestors possessed hidden virtue may directly assume office as immortals. Some enter the Southern Palace to undergo transformation, regardless of rank, and all swiftly proceed to the Southern Palace for refinement."

Moreover, in the mountains of Huayin lived Yin Qianzi, a practitioner of the Dao during Emperor Wu’s reign. He met an extraordinary person who taught him the Way of Cinnabar Radiance. After fifty years of practice, his complexion remained that of a child. Now, the Supreme Unity Lord has sent for him; he ascended on clouds to the Primordial Realm and became a High Immortal.

Peng Keng’s comings and goings, Zhong Lun’s lingering delight.
*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Peng Keng was Peng Zu, who lived eight hundred years without resorting to the dissolution of the corpse. The Lady of Southern Marchmount said: "The lords themselves choose whether to appear or withdraw, to retreat into the mountains and forests, to delight in roaming as immortals, or to ascend into emptiness as extinction. It is not that they cannot ascend to heaven—they simply do not wish to."

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* states: Wang Zhonglun once resided on Mount Heming. A stone there emitted sounds of its own accord. Tian Xuan saw it and asked, "Who is that?" He replied, "I am the immortal Wang Zhonglun. I love the strange resonance of this stone, so I linger here to listen."

Here ends the second scroll of *Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns*.
The third scroll of *Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns* follows.

Chen Baoguang of the Orthodox Unity Dao, compiler. *Mingqi’s Maple Chamber* and *Lady Zhen’s White Terrace*.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: On Mount Heng there was a Dao practitioner named Ye Mingqi. During the late Wei dynasty, he entered the mountains to ingest herbs and elixirs. Together with Zhang Lizheng, he dwelled in a secluded cave, where he received the cinnabar method from the Lord of Western City. Forty-three years had passed, and his inner and outer vision was thoroughly clear. He could walk five hundred *li* in a day. Now he resides in the Fangzhu Chamber as an Upper Immortal.

The Lord of the Register of Destiny further states: The Halls of Yiqian and Tongchu are the male and female abodes. Those who preside over the earthly realms and rank highest among them may attain the halls of the perfected immortals. Now the Female Perfected Zhao Sutai has resided in the Yiqian Hall for four hundred years and refuses to leave, saying that nowhere under heaven is more delightful than this place.

Master Mao’s kestrel chicks and the Saintly Maiden’s goose eggs.

*The Records of the Immortals* states: Master Mao studied the Dao in Qi. After achieving the Way, he governed Mount Mao. When the sick came to make vows, he would often boil ten kestrel chicks and place them within his curtain. After a moment, Master Mao would toss the chicks back to them. Upon breaking them open, if they were found to be without yolks, the patient would recover. If there was earth inside, the illness would not be cured—this was his constant method. The kestrel chicks remained as before, with no sign of having been broken.

*The History of the Southern Dynasties* states: Xiao Ang was the governor of Pengcheng. At the time, there was a woman of about twenty, with unbound hair and yellow robes, dwelling in a stone chamber on Mount Wuque. She practiced no particular cultivation, ate very little, and occasionally went out to drink a little wine and eat a goose egg, calling herself the Saintly Maiden. Those who came seeking children often had their wishes fulfilled, and visitors filled the mountain valleys. Xiao Ang summoned and questioned her, but she gave no response. Taking her for a demonic deluder, he had her flogged thirty times, whereupon her wounds festered. Later, she vanished without a trace.

Daoist principles tame deer; the lord’s friend leads hounds.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Daoist Wang Daoyi knew that Mount Zhongnan was the site where the Perfected Master Yin Xi had ascended to transcendence. During the Taihe era, he led six or seven disciples from Mount Gushe to reside at Louguan. In the third year of Yongping, his master ascended through transformation; white clouds filled the chamber, and an extraordinary fragrance suffused the courtyard. A white deer appeared outside in the yard, sometimes visible, sometimes hidden, for ten days. After the burial, it vanished entirely. Villagers later saw Daoyi riding a white deer as he soared into the heavens.

*The Tales of the Thatched Pavilion* relates: In Shicheng Township of Xiao Han County in Suizhou, a villager named He Junyou encountered a Daoist at the Cloud-Top Mountain Temple. The Daoist, clad in plain robes and deer-leather shoes, led a black hound and instructed Junyou to carry a gourd and staff to Mount Qingcheng. At first, they followed an overgrown path, where strange rocks flanked the way, slender bamboo and peach blossoms lined the route, and flying springs murmured over rapids. Upon reaching a Daoist abode, the Daoist told Junyou to place his bag and staff on the steps, saying, "You bear the marks of a transcendent." He then gave Junyou a single pellet of medicine to swallow, saying, "On the eighth day of the ninth month, you must return here." He sent Junyou home, who thereafter felt no hunger or thirst.

On the appointed day, as evening fell, the valleys were bathed in bright moonlight and clear wind, and Junyou awaited something with quiet anticipation. At dawn, clouds and mist intertwined in five-colored hues. Junyou gazed upward, treading the void, as auspicious winds and radiant mists arose in abundance. He then crossed towering ravines and layered peaks, vanishing from sight as one strained to follow.

Gan Pu recognized Tao; He Pu laughed at Guan.
*The Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Once, a man returning from beyond the Yangtze suddenly encountered someone in a tiny boat shaped like a deer’s head, with a single attendant, gliding straight toward him over the waves. The stranger called the man by name, saying, "Gu Daodu is going to the capital. I wish to send a letter to Maoshan for Tao the Recluse." He was just about to write it when he suddenly said, "Never mind. You will not go to the mountain after all. I shall deliver it myself." When the man reached the capital, he indeed hurried off to Guangling. Later, when Zi Liang asked Master Hong about this, Hong replied, "That was Gan Pu, an immortal of Mount Song. He had known Tao in a former life, not in this one. How could he come here again?"

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* records: Xing He Pu, of unknown origin, lived in seclusion by the Bohai Sea. At the time, Fang Guan served as magistrate of Lushi County and treated He Pu with great kindness. One day, as they strolled hand in hand, they unknowingly walked dozens of li. Arriving at Xia Gu Village, they came upon an abandoned Buddhist hall, where pines and bamboos cast deep shade. They sat beneath them, and He Pu struck the ground with his staff, instructing his attendant to dig. After several feet, they unearthed an earthen jar containing a letter from Lou Shide to Yong the Elder. He Pu laughed and said to Guan, "Do you recall this?" Guan, his temples shaved, remembered that in a past life he had been a monk named Yong. He Pu added, "You are destined to become a grand minister. Take good care of yourself."

Mei Gu walked on water; Dao Hua ascended the pine.
*The Garden of Marvels* relates: During the Qin dynasty, by a lake in Danyang County stood a shrine to Mei Gu. At times, a Daoist named Daoyan would appear, wearing shoes and walking upon the water. To this day, on the dark and full moon nights at the shrine, one can see the faint outline of shoes amid the water’s mist.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* records: Hou Daohua, whenever he found damage in the abbey where he lived, would take up axe and adze to repair it, enduring hardship without complaint. One day, while renovating the main hall, he suddenly found a cinnabar pellet in the rafters and swallowed it. Before the abbey gate stood a pine tree, and Daohua climbed it to trim its branches. When others reproached him, he replied, "I fear they will hinder my ascent." All thought him mad. Seven days later, at dawn, Daohua climbed to the top of the pine, waved his hand in farewell, and said, "I have received a decree from the Jade Emperor, appointing me Attendant of the Immortal Terrace and Keeper of the Faithful Chapel of the Upper Clarity Palace. I depart now." He left behind a poem: *"The Great Return Elixir, wrapped in silk, / For many years its hue unchanged. / Last night, stolen and swallowed— / Today, I fly into the azure sky."* Moments later, music arose from the clouds, and banners and pennants appeared faintly as he ascended into the heavens.

Lingwei’s immortal crane; Song Xian’s dragon-man.
*The Records of Spirits* states: At the eastern gate of Liaodong stood a stone pillar, upon which perched an immortal crane. Unaware of its nature, people tried to shoot it. The crane took flight into the sky and sang: *"There is a bird, there is a bird—Ding Lingwei! / Gone from home a thousand years, now I return. / The city walls remain, but the people are no more. / Why not learn the Dao, that your tomb may lie empty?"* Thereafter, people placed two cranes upon the pillar, and this practice began.

*The Unofficial History of Jin* records: Song Xian was a man of literary talent who resigned from office and refused all social intercourse, living in seclusion in Jiuquan. Three thousand disciples studied under him. The governor of Jiuquan had his portrait painted in the pavilion and, whenever he entered or left, would bow to it, reciting: *"What stone do you pillow? What stream do you rinse? / Your form may be seen, but your name cannot be sought."* He then visited Song’s gate and sighed, saying, *"Your name may be heard, but your person cannot be seen. / Your virtue may be revered, but your form cannot be beheld. / From this day forth, I know that you, Master, are the dragon among men."*

Wang Ding dwelt beyond the world; Guaiya dreamed within.
*The Miscellaneous Records of Elegant Words* states: Wang Ding composed songs and poems and was fond of immortals, his heart roaming beyond the material world. Some of his contemporaries believed he had attained realization, but when asked, he never revealed anything. Over a hundred of his poems circulated among people, such as: *"The wind shakes the rotten branch, startling the crane to flight; / The water carries mountain fruit, drifting toward men."* To Cheng Mingfu, he wrote: *"Before the ancient county, rapids murmur; / With office idle, the Dao is at ease. / Holding a cup, I listen to mountain crows sing; / Drying herbs, wild apes watch. / A brush lies across the stone crevice where I play the qin; / A fishing rod is tucked behind my ear. / I wonder when Master Tao Yuanming / Will ascend into the clouds."*

*The Records of the Loyal and Steadfast Duke* states: Zhang Guaiya was in Chengdu when he dreamed of visiting the Purple Mansion of the Perfected Lord. Their conversation had barely begun when a report came: "The Honorable Huang Jianji of the Western Gate has arrived." Huang entered wearing a scholar’s kerchief and Daoist robes, and the Perfected Lord descended the steps to greet him, showing great courtesy. He then seated Zhang below Huang and spoke to him with warm regard, as if in admiration. The next morning, Zhang dispatched an official to the Western Gate to summon Huang Jianji, instructing him to come in his usual attire. When Huang arrived, he appeared just as in the dream. Zhang then told him of the dream and asked, "What hidden virtue do you possess, to be so honored by the Perfected Lord?" Huang replied, "I have no special talent. Each year, when rice and wheat ripen, I use money to buy and store grain. When the next year’s harvest is not yet ready and the common folk face hardship, I sell it back to them at the same price, without raising the cost or altering the measure. For me, there is no loss, yet the people are helped in their time of need." Zhang said, "This is why you were seated above me."

Then he ordered the scribe to support Huang and bow to him.

Those who cultivate hidden merits in their youth may ascend by daylight. The *New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Master Li, styled Shunxing, was a native of Jingzhao. On an autumn equinox evening, a thousand celestial riders suddenly descended and hovered in the air. Two figures appeared in his courtyard and said to him, "The Supreme Emperor has commanded that immortal officials await you in the stone chamber atop the Purple Pavilion. We two are the gods of the Direct Day, sent to summon you. You should prepare your carriage at once." Master Li followed them, crossing peaks and valleys as if riding on flying paper, and in an instant they arrived. There he saw three Perfected Ones, each seated in a different posture, naturally enveloped by five-colored clouds and mist. Their attendants and officials radiated brilliant light, and their banners, pennants, and feathered canopies were beyond description. Master Li bowed and inquired about the Dao of ascending by daylight. The Perfected Ones replied, "You possess accumulated virtue and are destined for an immortal office. To ascend with both form and spirit is no difficulty for you."

The *Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* records: Wang Shaodao accumulated hidden merits by aiding others, and through the virtue of his deeds, he attained immortality. He often said to people, "When merit reaches three thousand, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. With surplus goodness, one descends in a cloud chariot. To propagate the Dao without cease is to attain deathlessness. These words are true indeed." The *True Instructions* states: In the Palace of Youthful Beginnings, there was Wang Shaodao, a man of the Han era.

Du Sheng’s dragon soars with sand, Ma Fu’s rats cower at his command. The *New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Perfected One Du Sheng’s age was unfathomable. He abstained from grain and drank only water, yet appeared as a man of twenty. He could write the character for "dragon" in sand, float it upon water, and with a shout, transform it into a small dragon that would soar over ten feet high, trailing mist and clouds. When called, it would descend at once. The *Divine Immortals* records: Ma Xiang wandered through famous mountains, and none knew he possessed the Dao’s protection. When the prefect of Changzhou, Lord Ma, heard of him, he summoned him and treated him as an elder brother. The prefect said, "There are many rats in the city." Ma Xiang then wrote a talisman and had it posted beneath the wall. With a long whistle, all the rats gathered. He called the largest forward and said, "You are a creature of heaven, provided with grain to eat. Why do you disturb the lord? I do not wish to kill you, so you should leave at once." The largest rat turned, and the smaller ones prostrated themselves before the steps, then departed in a single file.

Han Xiang at Blue Pass, Yin Xi at Hangu Pass. The *Green Jade Case* states: Han Xiang, styled Qingfu, was the nephew of Han Yu. Free-spirited and unrestrained, he once drunkenly recited:
*"Green mountains, home of clouds and streams,
This place is my abode.
At night, I drink the flowing jade,
At dawn, I chew the crimson mist.
My zither plays the tune of jasper,
My furnace refines cinnabar.
The golden tiger guards the cauldron,
The dark field nurtures white crows.
A gourd holds the world,
A three-foot blade slays demons.
I brew wine in an instant,
And make flowers bloom in a moment.
Whoever can learn from me
Shall together behold the immortal blossoms."*

Han Yu asked, "How can you alter creation and make flowers bloom?" Han Xiang replied, "This is quite easy." He took soil, piled it in a basin, and in an instant, two blue lotuses bloomed, resembling peonies. Their leaves bore small golden characters: *"Clouds veil the Qin Ridge—where is home? Snow chokes Blue Pass—my horse cannot advance."* Han Yu did not understand the verse’s meaning. Later, when Han Yu was demoted to Chaozhou for his memorial on the Buddha’s relics, he encountered a great snowstorm on the road. There he met Han Xiang, who said, "Do you recall the lines on the flowers?" When he inquired about the place name, it was Blue Pass. Han Yu then realized and continued the poem:
*"A memorial submitted at dawn to the nine-tiered heavens,
By dusk, I was banished eight thousand leagues to Chaoyang.
I sought to purge corruption for a sagely reign,
Daring not, in my frailty, to cling to these fading years.
Clouds veil the Qin Ridge—where is home?
Snow chokes Blue Pass—my horse cannot advance.
I know you have come from afar with deep intent—
To gather my bones by the miasmic river’s side."*

Later, Han Xiang accompanied Han Yu to the Yuan and Xiang rivers, and none knew where they went. The *Extensive Records* states: Lord Xi, magistrate of Hangu Pass, divined the winds and knew a divine person would pass through. He swept the road for forty *li* and recognized Laozi upon seeing him. Laozi had not yet transmitted his teachings in the central lands, but knowing Yin Xi’s destiny, he tarried at the pass and imparted the essentials of the Dao.

Yu the True Mother’s retinue, Huang the True Lord’s paternal line. The *Records of the Western Mountains* state: True Lord Yu, whose personal name was Lie and style Daowei, was known for his filial piety toward his mother. His mother was also devoted to cultivating the Dao. Together they journeyed to the Western Mountains to see Perfected Lord Xu. They kowtowed and pleaded for instruction. Moved by their sincerity, Perfected Lord Xu had a chamber built to the west of his residence for them to dwell in and taught them the Dao’s arts. When Perfected Lord Xu ascended, Daowei and his mother both received the Jade Emperor’s decree, and all of Perfected Lord Xu’s household ascended to heaven.

Additionally, True Lord Huang’s personal name was Renlan, and his style was Ziting. His father’s name was Fu, styled Wanshi, renowned for his lofty conduct and filial piety toward his parents. The prefecture and commandery recommended him as a filial and incorrupt candidate. During Emperor Mu’s reign, he served as a censor. Ziting was skilled in minor arts and possessed a refined disposition. Perfected Lord Xu gave his daughter to him in marriage. Wanshi served Perfected Lord Xu with the rites of a disciple. When Ziting received the Jade Emperor’s decree, he ascended to heaven with his parents and household. Today, in Xiangfu Abbey of Gao’an County, a cinnabar well remains—it was once his residence.

Xiu the Duke transforms into a sheep, Yin Cheng pities the deer. The *Arrayed Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states: Duke Xiu Yang secluded himself in a stone chamber on Mount Hua, consuming yellow essence. The chamber had a stone stool, and as he sat upon it, the stone wore through. When Emperor Jing heard of his fame and summoned him, the duke transformed into a white sheep upon the stool, inscribing its flank: *"The sheep duke thanks the Son of Heaven."* Later, the emperor placed the stone sheep on a terrace, but the duke transformed again and vanished, his whereabouts unknown. The *New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Yin Cheng possessed the Dao’s arts. Though Qin Shi Huang repeatedly summoned him, he refused to appear. Weary of the clamor, he delighted in the mountains and forests, changed his name to Yin Linzi, and fled deep into the woods.

At times, Yin Cheng would encounter a lame deer hobbling painfully, unable to advance; moved by its suffering, he applied medicine to dress its wound. Later, caught in a great storm with provisions exhausted, he found himself stranded in the thickets. Just then, a doe approached, and in hunger he suckled its milk, while in cold he embraced it for warmth, the two remaining together for months on end. A divine being then imparted to him secret formulas, enabling him to regenerate bones and shield the sick. At the age of three hundred and forty, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The *Declarations of the Perfected* refers to him as Yin Linzi, who in the late Han entered Mount Mao, where he was later revered as a Perfected One.

*Devoted to the Real, Riding Tigers; Ziying Catching Fish.*

The *Transmissions of Eminent Daoists* states: Lü Zhi Zhen, a disciple of the Master of Broad Accomplishment, dwelt in a stone chamber for over a decade, skilled in healing others with medicinal stones. When he entered the forests and valleys, tigers and leopards followed him, yet when asked about the Dao, he remained silent, offering no response. Once, on the road through Mount Shang, he suddenly paled and halted. Those around him were astonished, but he said: "Ahead, bandits approach." Soon after, armed men appeared, and Zhi Zhen addressed them: "All who pass here are my disciples—do not disturb them." The bandits bowed and stepped aside, no longer daring to advance. Later, arriving at a valley’s mouth, he declared: "Here dwells something that harms men."

The companions wished to see it, so they entered the forest, where Zhi Zhen bound two tigers with rope and led them out. From this, all knew that Zhi Zhen had deeply attained the Dao of Broad Accomplishment.

*The Traditions of Immortals* states: Ziying was a man of Shu Village who excelled at diving into water to catch fish. Once, he caught a red carp, and admiring its color, took it home and placed it in his pond, feeding it grains of rice and millet. Within a year, it grew over a *zhang* in length, sprouting horns and wings. Terrified, Ziying apologized to the fish, which said: "I have come to welcome you. Mount my back, and I shall carry you away." Suddenly, a violent storm arose, and Ziying climbed onto the fish’s back, soaring into the sky and vanishing. He left behind two dogs and one donkey.

*The Traditions of Immortals* states: Zixian, surnamed Hu, was a diviner of the Han era who lived over a hundred years. Fond of wine, he was once generously hosted by an old woman who never asked for payment. One day, he suddenly told her: "Prepare quickly—we must depart together." That night, a divine being arrived bearing two straw dogs. Zixian and the woman mounted them and entered Mount Huayin, where he cried out: "The wine-seller’s mother is here!"

*The Supplementary Traditions of Immortals* states: Shen Jian possessed the arts of prolonging life and reversing death. Once, while traveling afar, he entrusted a donkey, a dog, and sheep to a host’s home, giving each a single pill before departing. The host remarked: "This guest is strange—he leaves fifteen creatures and not a single coin. What am I to do?" Three years later, Jian returned, and the servants, donkey, and sheep remained unchanged. He ascended lightly, sometimes departing, sometimes returning, for over three hundred years, though none understood him. Later, he vanished without a trace.

Han Zhong’s sesame and red cups; Tingrui’s calamus.

*The Comprehensive Records of Immortals* states: Le Zichang of Qi, fond of the Dao from youth, entered Mount Huolin, where he met Han Zhong, who taught him to ingest the *Sesame and Red Cup Elixir*. Though eighty years old, his complexion remained like a maiden’s. Later, he ascended as an immortal and was appointed Keeper of the Gate of Cultivation.

*The Elegant Talks of Prefectural Pavilions* states: The Daoist master Shen Tingrui, son of the former Minister of Rites Bin, dwelled on Jade Bamboo Mountain. Whenever he encountered deep mountains or ancient caves, he would forget to return for days. One day, he bid farewell to a singing girl and sat in the Pavilion of Assembled Immortals. After reciting the verse *"How fleeting is human life!"*, he passed away. Two years after his burial, Zeng Zhaoying of Mount Gezao encountered him several *li* from the mountain gate. Though Gezao and Jade Bamboo Mountain lay a hundred and sixty *li* apart, when Zeng asked where he was bound, Tingrui replied: "I am briefly visiting friends on Mount Lu." He left a poem in parting:

*Paths stretch north and south, east and west,*
*Yet human lives must meet at times.*
*Once I dwelt on Gezao’s slopes,*
*Then ascended to the Capital of Yuan.*
*Clouds drift vast across the sky,*
*A spring’s voice falls on lone stones.*
*Who could have foreseen this early meeting?*
*Together we boil calamus and herbs.*

When Zeng returned to Jade Bamboo Mountain and spoke of this, they realized the master had achieved liberation in the flesh.

Ju Feng’s unkempt mane; Chiman’s dwarfed frame.

*The Miscellaneous Records of the Northern Dream* states: During the Tongguang era of Later Tang, a mad scholar named Sang Ju Feng, filthy and disheveled, acted contrary to human norms, his strange powers beyond measure. When he visited the prefectural office to pay respects to the Prince of Nanping, he wore one straw sandal and one hemp shoe, earning the nickname "Wild Man."

*The Records of Heyang* states: Prince Qianyang of Tang, Li Qian, was a heavy drinker, surpassed only by the scholar Ye Fanneng. The prince pressed him to drink, but Fanneng refused, saying: "I have a disciple whose capacity rivals yours. Tomorrow, I shall send him to meet you." The next morning, a calling card arrived bearing the name *Daoist Chang Chiman*. The prince hastily summoned him. Though small in stature, his spirit shone with radiance, and his voice rang clear. After sitting, he discoursed brilliantly on cosmology. The prince ordered wine, and the Daoist drank readily. The prince poured rich wine into a large goblet, filling it with a massive cuttlefish. Though the prince grew flushed with drink, the Daoist remained poised and refined. After a long while, he suddenly said: "I am drunk after just this one cup." The prince urged him on, but the Daoist replied: "Do you not know that capacity has limits? Why press me further?" When pressed again, he collapsed to the ground—revealing himself to be a large wine jar, holding five *dou*.

Jade Pool’s white oranges; Cangzhou’s green dates.

*The Traditions of Divine Immortals* states: King Mu of Zhou met the Queen Mother of the West at Jade Pool, where they feasted on water lotus, black dates, jade-like lotus roots, and white oranges.

*The Miscellaneous Records of Guiyang* states: During the Sui dynasty, the recluse Yuan Cangji served as an adjutant to a maritime envoy. When his ship was wrecked in a storm, he drifted on a plank to an island, where the locals said: "This is Cangzhou, ten thousand *li* from the realm." The flowers and trees there always bloomed as in the second or third month, and few ever died. The land bore twin-lobed melons two *chi* long, green dates and red grains as large as pears. In the ponds swam four-legged golden fish and golden lotus flowers, which women plucked for adornment—without a golden lotus in her hair, none could approach the immortals’ abodes. Longing for the Central Kingdom, Cangji was sent back by the islanders in a wind-cutting boat that sped like an arrow, reaching Donglai in ten days. When he asked about the realm, he learned it was now the Tang dynasty—two hundred years had passed since the Daye era.

Youying’s five mushrooms; Fenggang’s hundred herbs.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Lady Youying chanted:
*"With heart I pledged to the Woodcutter’s Son,*
*Promising to seek the five mushrooms.*
*If the magic herbs elude your grasp,*
*You too shall never come."*

*The Extensive Records* states: Fenggang was a man of Hanyang who gathered the flowers of a hundred herbs, steeping them in water and sealing them in mud. Beginning in the first month and ending in the ninth, he buried them for a hundred days, then pressed and decocted them into pills. When placed in the mouth of the recently dead, they revived instantly. After consuming the medicine for several years, Fenggang never aged. Later, he entered the Earth’s Lung Mountain.

Gongcheng’s ease; Songlai’s sweeping.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Zhao Gongcheng once suffered from a foot ailment that prevented him from walking. In his heart, he silently bowed to the Most High.

After thirty years of unwavering devotion, he was moved by the Most High to bestow a dose of medicine, which, upon consumption, cured him instantly. Later, he attained the Dao and now resides on Mount Heming. During his practice, he never once wavered in his focus—this is what is meant by "inwardly refining the Great Primal" and "reposing in the divine palace."

Furthermore, Songlaizi served as Market Overseer during the reign of Duke Zhuang of Chu. He would often sweep the marketplace when he encountered a yellow-robed beggar singing in the streets:

*"Twin blooms burst from Heaven’s Court,*
*The mountain’s source wards off yin’s harm.*
*At dawn, I rein the celestial steed,*
*And journey to the home of the Great Perfected."*

The beggar sang this as he begged in the marketplace, yet none recognized him—only Songlaizi understood. Thereupon, he honored him with the rites of a master. After thirty years, the beggar transmitted to Songlaizi the Way of the Middle Immortals, and he now dwells on Central Peak. It was then known that the beggar was none other than Feng Yanshou, the Perfected of Western Peak. The annotation states: *"The hands are the celestial steeds; the nose, the mountain’s source."*

**Gongsong’s longevity; Dongguo’s agelessness.**

*The Master Embracing Simplicity* states: Gongsong possessed literary talent and lived for several centuries, his complexion like that of a child. He encountered the immortal Gan Ji, from whom he received writings that extensively discussed the waxing and waning of yin and yang. There is the Way of Heaven, the Way of Earth, and the Way of Man. Those who govern the state employ it to achieve great peace; those who cultivate the body employ it to preserve longevity—such is its Way.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Dongguo Yan, a native of Shanyang, consumed the *Lingfei Powder*. When he wrote at night in a darkened chamber, his body emanated light. He could also gaze afar and discern small objects dozens of *li* away on level ground, perceiving even their colors.

Those throughout the world destined to die—whether acquaintances or strangers—he could foresee with unerring accuracy, and all came to pass as he predicted. He remained ageless in his village for four or five hundred years, until one day dozens of men riding tigers and leopards arrived to welcome him. All his neighbors witnessed this. He bade them farewell and departed, entering the Kunlun Mountains.

Cai the maiden embroidered phoenixes; Zhihe carved simurghs.

*The Extensive Records* states: Cai the Immortal Maiden was a native of Xiangyang. From childhood, she was clever and skillful, excelling in embroidery, which earned her renown among her neighbors. One day, as she finished embroidering a pair of phoenixes, their five-colored radiance shimmered like rosy clouds. Suddenly, an old man arrived at her door, requesting to see them, and offered to set their eyes. Once the eyes were placed, the phoenixes took flight. The old man and the maiden each mounted a phoenix and departed, descending into the forests south of Xiangyang Mountain. Later, the mountain was renamed Phoenix Grove Mountain, and Phoenix Grove Pass was established. Her dwelling was consecrated as the Phoenix Grove Serene Truth Abbey, where an image of the female Daoist was enshrined.

Additionally, Han Zhihe was a foreigner who entered the Middle Kingdom and served as an imperial guard. He carved wooden figures of simurghs, cranes, crows, and magpies, installing mechanisms within their bellies. When activated, they soared a hundred paces through the air. He could also craft dragon-drawn chariots; when one stepped upon them, their fangs and claws all moved, twisting and coiling as if in flight. Emperor Xianzong admired his work and bestowed lavish rewards upon him. Yet Zhihe distributed all his gifts to others and later vanished, his whereabouts unknown.

Yue Ba shattered the temple, and Gu Qing’s coffin burst open.

*Extensive Records* states: Yue Ba served as the Merit Officer of Chengdu. The prefect asked him, “Does the Merit Officer possess the Dao? May we test it?” Yue Ba replied, “Very well.” He then entered the wall, ascending slowly like mist or cloud, and vanished without a trace. Later, he was appointed Gentleman of the Palace and promoted to Prefect of Yuzhang. On a mountain there stood a temple of great efficacy, capable of parting the winds for boats on the river. Upon Yue Ba’s arrival, the spirit vanished. Yue Ba declared, “This temple spirit is deceitful.” He then demolished the temple. The spirit fled, transforming into a scholar who traveled to the State of Qi, where the prefect gave his daughter to him in marriage. Yue Ba journeyed to Qi, met the prefect, inscribed a talisman, and let out a long whistle, summoning the scholar to appear. He rebuked the spirit, which turned into a raccoon dog, and Yue Ba slew it.

*Biographies of the Immortals* records: Gu Qing was a Gentleman-in-Attendance during the reign of Emperor Cheng. Stricken by illness, he died, yet his body did not stiffen. He was placed in a coffin without sealing it. Two years later, he was seen wearing a green cap, sitting composedly atop the county gate. His family came to welcome him, but he did not descend. When the coffin was opened, no corpse remained. Later, he entered Mount Taibai, where the people built a shrine for him, and Gu Qing would occasionally appear within it.

Liang Bo sought Wei, and the Filial and Benevolent Emperor honored Han.
*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Emperor Xiao dispatched the emissary Liang Bo into the mountains to seek Wei Shuqing, but he found only his son, Du Shi. Together, they entered Mount Taihua to search. Du Shi glimpsed his father playing a board game with several others upon a stone, seated on a white jade platform. Du Shi asked who the players were, and his father replied, “Master Hong Ya, Xu You, Chao Fu, and Wang Zijin.” He added, “I have a formula for transcendence hidden beneath a pillar in my dwelling.” Du Shi returned and dug there, uncovering a jade casket sealed with the imprint of a flying immortal. Inside was five-colored mica. Du Shi consumed it and ascended as an immortal.

*Records of Forgotten Tales* states: During the reign of Emperor Hui of Han, the Daoist Han Zhi, a man from the State of Jue, spoke of an envoy from the Kingdom of Nili who had come to court. The envoy stood four feet tall, with two horns like seals, teeth protruding from his lips, and dwelled in deep caves. His lifespan was immeasurable. The emperor sent Han Zhi to ask how many dynasties he had witnessed. The envoy replied, “Five generations have succeeded one another, dying and being reborn like motes of dust or fine rain—existence and oblivion cannot be reckoned.” He also recounted events from the eras of Nüwa and the Yellow Emperor as if they were before his eyes. Han Zhi reported this to the emperor, who sighed, “Vast and obscure! Without divine insight or profound understanding, one cannot speak of such distant matters.” Han Zhi then withdrew, and his whereabouts became unknown. The emperor commanded various alchemists to establish an immortal’s hall north of Chang’an, naming it the Shrine of Han.

Ruo Shan cast off his sandals, and Ren Dun abandoned his office.
*Extensive Records* states: During the Kaiyuan era, Tang Ruo Shan governed Runzhou. Daily, he would set sail upon the river with a few colleagues and guests to visit Jinshan Temple. Midway across the current, a dense fog obscured all, rendering even nearby objects indistinct. Ruo Shan alone saw an old fisherman rowing a boat toward their vessel. He boarded the fisherman’s boat and departed in a transcendent manner. Upon the table in his quarters, a letter of farewell and a memorial to the throne were found. The memorial read in part: “Though my fate aligned with an enlightened age and I was repeatedly honored with rank, I awakened to the principle of rise and fall and deeply understood the rule of knowing when to cease. My heart dwelled at the mysterious gate, and I early attained the true formula. Gold can indeed be wrought, as the ancients of Huainan once declared; the white sun’s span can be extended, as the wondrous use of the true scriptures reveals. Having obtained this, what more could I seek? Thus, I cast off the red dust and soared to the azure vault. Penglai is not distant, and Fusang lies within sight. Gazing afar at the imperial palace, I am overwhelmed by the devotion of a dog or horse.” When Emperor Ming read the memorial, he marveled at it.

*The Biographies of Daoist Scholars* states: Ren Dun, styled Zishang, lived at the beginning of the Yongjia era when the realm was in turmoil. He abandoned his office, crossed the river southward, and resolved to live beyond the mundane world, dwelling in the mountains and forests. Suddenly, a man over ten feet tall appeared. When Ren Dun questioned him, the man claimed to be a messenger sent by Lord Anaku to inquire after him. Ren Dun asked, “Where does the Lord usually reside?” The man replied, “He is often in the heavens but also roams the mortal world. When he passes through, he sometimes lingers in the Great Smelter or the Immortal Charts.” Later, Ren Dun foresaw the calamity of Sun En and underwent corpse liberation upon Mount Muzhao.

Stilwell’s golden palace, Gongyuan’s azure vault.
*The Original Biography* states: The Jade Emperor decreed to Perfected Ge...

Long had Hong transmitted the essential teachings of the heart, excelling in nurturing the prenatal true qi. He expounded divine remedies to heal the ailments of living beings and widely disseminated the ancient classics amidst the mortal world. Through hidden merits, he aided all creatures, and by secret practices, he aligned himself with the perfected. His name was inscribed in the Jade Capital, and his person ascended to the Golden Portal. Thus, it was fitting that on the third day of the third month at the hour of *yin*, he mounted his chariot and ascended to heaven.

*The Original Biography* states to Perfected Luo: Gongyuan could dispel water spirits, succor living beings, exorcise malevolent forces, and expel demons. He summoned dragons to bring forth rain, possessed the virtue of administering medicinal cures for convulsions, and the merit of deploying talismans to dispel illness. Within, he cultivated the Three Ones; without, he nurtured the Four Kinds of Life. His name was renowned in the Immortal Capital, and his person returned to the Azure Vault. Thus, it was fitting that on the fifteenth day of the first month at the hour of *wu*, he rode a chariot drawn by a red dragon to return to heaven.

Shen Xi rode the dragon and tiger; Gongyang soared with phoenix and crane.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* records: Shen Xi, a man of Wu, studied the Dao in Shu. He saved people and benefited all beings, his virtue moving the Celestial Thearch. One day, while traveling, he suddenly beheld a chariot drawn by a green dragon and another by a white tiger, each attended by a dozen figures in crimson robes, bearing staffs that lined the road. They asked, “Have you seen Master Shen the Daoist?” Xi replied, “I am he.” The attendants said, “You have rendered service to the people. The Yellow and Lao Lords have dispatched immortal officials to welcome you as Attendant of the Azure Vault.” Thereupon, he ascended to heaven.

*The Records of the Western Mountains* state: Zhongli Jia, styled Gongyang, was the nephew of Lord Xu the Upright. Fond of dwelling in forests and peaks, Lord Xu cherished his aptitude for receiving the Dao and entrusted him with secret instructions, bidding him cultivate them in secrecy. When Lord Xu ascended, he foretold the day of Gongyang’s transcendence. On that day, purple clouds descended from the heavens, and green phoenixes and white cranes danced in his courtyard. Immortal youths and jade maidens descended to welcome Gongyang, who ascended in broad daylight.

Lord Bo’s silk writings; Lord Gan’s immortal elixir.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* record: Master Yu had suffered from leprosy for decades, and no medicine could cure him. One day, he saw an old man selling remedies in the market, surnamed Bo. He approached and inquired, and the man said, “I can save you.” He bestowed upon him two scrolls of silk writings, saying, “This will not only cure your illness but grant you long life.” Master Yu bowed and received them. Pondering their meaning, he applied them inwardly to cultivate his nature and body, and outwardly to dispel calamities and heal illnesses—none failed to be cured. Having perfected the Dao, he departed as a transcendent.

*The Records of the Western Mountains* state: Perfected Lord Gan, styled Bowu, was esteemed in his village for his filial conduct. Wielding his sword, he followed Perfected Lord Xu to subdue demons, contributing greatly to their efforts. Lord Xu transmitted secret instructions to him, and Lord Gan concealed his form and shadow, eluding all perception. One day, celestial music suddenly resounded from the heavens, and in an instant, auspicious clouds and radiant rosy mists shone forth as he ascended to heaven.

Lord Zheng of Kun Terrace; Zilian of Wei Pavilion.

*The Green Locks* records: The presented scholar Niu Yi departed the capital and rested beneath the shade of a willow. He dreamed he arrived at a grand mansion, where an attendant said, “This is the Jade Palace.” Upon closer inspection, he recognized his old friend Lü Zhen, who said, “Wu. Presides over this office.”

Niu beheld a white jade tablet upon the hall, inscribed in vermilion seal script and veiled in crimson gauze, bearing in large characters: *Register of Heavenly Immortals of the Central Realm*. Below were listed several thousand names, among which he recognized only a few—Lü, Yi Jian, Li Di, and Yu Jing. Niu inquired about the details of these heavenly immortals, and Lü replied, “There is an order and true mandate to these things, which are not for one such as you to know.” Niu asked, “Are the present-day ministers and chancellors mostly immortals?” Lü answered, “Seven or eight out of ten.” Niu said, “Minister Fu Bi is the state’s elder statesman—could he truly be an immortal?” Lü replied, “Minister Fu is the Perfected Lord of Kun Terrace; at ninety-three years of age, he returned to the Kun Terrace Palace.” Niu asked, “What office do you now hold?” Lü said, “After three hundred more years, I shall be appointed as the overseer of the earthly realm.” Niu asked, “And what office does the Son of Heaven hold?” Lü answered, “He presides over the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, and the famous mountains and great rivers.”

*The Comprehensive Record of Marvels* states: The Daoist of Mount Heng, Shuai Zi Kang, was dissolute and fond of wine, his nature rough and quarrelsome, quick to insult others with words. Few associated with him, and so he was nicknamed “Ox.” He dwelled in the Wei Pavilion upon the mountain. When the Vice Minister of Rites, Lord Wang You, was serving as Prefect of Tanzhou, at the onset of summer he was to offer sacrifices to Zhu Rong. Arriving at Mount Heng, he sought out the so-called Wei Pavilion. Upon arrival, he found Zi Kang drunk and asleep. Lord Wang spoke with him and found him most extraordinary, so he took him back to the prefectural seat and drank with him daily. When Zi Kang asked to return to the mountain, he once more took up residence in the Wei Pavilion. One day, he suddenly told others, “I shall soon depart on a distant journey and must bid farewell to Lord Wang.” That very day, he took a small boat downriver to Tanzhou to pay his respects, saying, “I am bound for another place.” Lord Wang detained him to drink, and after two days, Zi Kang took his leave. On the appointed day, he wrote a letter to Li, the abbot of the Hengshan Daoist temple, then bathed, donned his robes, burned incense, held his ritual tablet, and shed his mortal form. Those who heard of it were astonished, and Li purchased a coffin to bury him with full honors. Nearly half a year later, a monk from Mount Heng arrived at the Anshang Gate in the capital. Zi Kang came to see the capital, saying, “On my journey here, I was most generously treated by Abbot Li.” From his sleeve, he produced a letter to be delivered to the monk in thanks. When Li opened the seal, it was indeed a letter in Zi Kang’s own hand. All marveled at Lord Wang’s silent discernment.

*Records of the Multitudes of Immortals of the Three Caverns*, Scroll Three—concluded.
*Records of the Multitudes of Immortals of the Three Caverns*, Scroll Four.

Chen Baoguang of the Orthodox Unity Dao, compiler and editor, reveres the masters:

**The Master He**
The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: On Mount Heng there lived a Daoist who never revealed his name. When asked his surname, he would say, “He,” and when asked his given name, he would say, “He.” Thus, the people of his time called him Master He. Someone once asked, “Master, you never speak—how then do you enlighten those who come after?” He replied, “To know and yet claim not to know is supreme; to not know and yet claim to know is a flaw. Who could carve open the apertures of primordial chaos to grasp the principle of spontaneity?” Then, staff in hand, he entered the mountains, and tigers and leopards followed him. Master Sima remarked, “This may be called one whose talents are complete yet whose virtue remains unmanifest.” Later, he underwent liberation by means of the corpse, and with a clap of thunder, his body vanished.

**The Venerable Pupupu**
The *Extensive Records* states: The Venerable Pupupu’s origins were unknown. He claimed his surname was Pu, and so the people of his time called him the Venerable Pupupu. He dwelled on Huangtu Mountain in Guangzhou for over thirty years, consuming apricot elixirs while eating and drinking like an ordinary person. He sold medicines for a living, yet no one recognized him. When he encountered Wang Bian, he transmitted to him the secret of the apricot elixir, and in that very moment, the master ascended into the clouds. Prefect Li Xiuguang heard of this and deemed it inauspicious. The master then descended to Xiuguang’s residence, whereupon Xiuguang said, “If you are an immortal, you should depart and not return—this is demonic.” The master replied, “Both Lady Ma Gu and Lord Mao sought the Dao from me. Why do you call me demonic?” Xiuguang ordered his attendants to seize him, but suddenly the Lords of the Dragon and Tiger appeared before them. The master ascended, clouds and mist swirling on all sides, thunder and lightning shaking the earth. The onlookers fled in terror, and Xiuguang apologized for his offense. Emperor Minghuang issued an edict to establish an official abbey, which stands to this day.

**Three Pines of Master Hou’s Abbey; Two Bamboos of Su’s Hermitage**
The *Biographies of Eminent Daoists* states: The Daoist Hou Kai, styled Faguang, was a native of Jingzhao. During the Wei dynasty’s Zhengshi era, he became a Daoist and was transmitted the secret formulas of astronomy. His morning and evening devotions grew only more diligent with time. He chose to dwell in Hangul Valley, where he practiced the Three Transformations of the Primal Qi, recited the *Great Cavern Scripture* and the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, and mastered the methods of summoning and exorcism. His abode was encircled by clear springs, and three pines spread their branches overhead, creating a secluded and tranquil retreat—his true dwelling place. Thus, it was named Three Pines Abbey.

The *Collected Writings of the Bang River* states: Su the Perfected One’s mother lived to be over a hundred years old. Without illness, she passed away suddenly, and the villagers prepared a coffin and buried her with proper rites. That day, on the summit of Niupi Mountain northeast of the prefecture, purple clouds enveloped the trees, lingering without dispersing. It seemed as though a white horse galloped among the groves, and wails of mourning were heard from the mountain ridges—all saying that Lord Su had returned to observe mourning for his mother. The villagers rushed to the site, where before his thatched hermitage, the ground was level and smooth, and two bamboos swayed without wind. When swept, the earth remained perpetually clean. After three years, the wailing ceased, and the white horse was no longer seen.

**Hu Fang’s Golden Exhortations; Yongbo’s Jade Cultivation**

**The Biographies of Divine Transcendents** records: During the Tang dynasty, Chen Xiufu, styled the Seven Masters, resided in Baocheng during the Zhenyuan era. He tilled the land and gathered firewood like an ordinary man, yet possessed many arts of transformation. Five to seven curious youths sought to learn his arts, practicing diligently without rest. Mid-lesson, he suddenly collapsed and died, his body swiftly decaying. The youths fled in terror, none daring to look back, and from then on, no young man dared disturb him. Hu Fang of Changming once became his disciple. When Hu Fang was about to take office, he left five thousand coins for Xiufu to buy wine. Xiufu laughed and declined, saying, "I have an abundance of gold and jade—what I regret is being unable to use it all." He handed Hu Fang a hoe and instructed him to till the earth. After digging no more than two or three inches, gold, jade, coins, and goods emerged with each cut. Xiufu said, "The things of this world are indeed like this, but each person’s allotted share is fixed. One should not take more than their due—if one were to use them, would there be any limit?"

**Extensive Records** states: Yang Yongbo was renowned for his filial piety. When his parents died, he buried them on a high mountain and built a hut beside their grave, weeping day and night. A sweet spring welled forth, providing water for travelers. One day, a man leading a horse arrived and gave Yongbo a pint of white stones, saying, "Plant these, and fine jade will grow." Indeed, white jade disks, over two feet long and countless in number, sprouted. One day, while traveling, Yongbo chanced upon the sea and met an immortal named Wei, who said, "This is the jade-planting Yongbo." Another immortal remarked, "Your filial devotion has moved the divine spirits. This office will one day be your dwelling." Years later, Yongbo and his wife ascended together. Their former residence is now called the Jade Field Quarter.

Dao achieved, he rode a mule; reverence paid, he bid farewell to the deer.

**The Bangjiang Collection** recounts: During the Qingli era, a scholar-recluse traveled to Mount Tai and called upon Registrar Guo Jifu. After taking his seat, Guo examined the visitor’s calling card, which bore the name Luo Daocheng. Upon inquiring about his origins, the scholar replied, "I am from Bangzhou." Guo invited him to stay for a drink, and the scholar said, "I have long wished to journey to Shuzhou. I arrived at Mount Tai a few days ago and have already explored it thoroughly. I will soon return south." He then borrowed brush and paper to compose a poem:

*Drawn by the thought of numinous splendor, I came to wander,*
*Emerald jade peaks rise in ten thousand autumnal layers.*
*Climbing to the heights of Great Peace, I gaze afar—*
*Roots entwine, linking over a dozen provinces.*

He then wrote a matching verse:

*My tracks drift with water and clouds, my days spent in idle roaming,*
*The summer valley’s chill surpasses autumn’s clarity.*
*Even apes and birds cling to old affections—*
*Turning back, I depart for the seaside provinces.*

Guo was deeply moved by the poems. After the scholar left, Guo sent a servant to escort him to his lodging and gave the servant another poem to deliver:

*White mule swift as racing clouds, his steps unhurried,*
*Wherever the wanderer goes, poems mark his trace.*
*If you wish to know his name and origins,*
*Look upon the stone beneath Bangyang Mountain.*

Later, Guo inquired of the people of Bangzhou and learned of the White Mule Perfected Lord’s Abbey. There, Luo Daocheng had attained the Dao and ridden a white mule across stone cliffs, leaving hoofprints that remain to this day.

**Records of the Western Mountains** state: Perfected Lord Xu, named Xun and styled Jingzhi, was originally from Xuchang but later moved to Yuzhang. From birth, he was quick-witted and handsome, unrestrained in his youth, fond of hunting. Once, he shot a fawn, which fell to the ground. Its mother licked it with her tongue, and before long, the fawn died. Moved by this, Xu destroyed his bow and arrows and devoted himself to study. By his early twenties, he had mastered the classics and histories, as well as music, astronomy, geography, and the Five Phases. He was especially drawn to the Dao of divine transcendents and later ascended with his entire household.

Liao Fu of the northern outskirts; Wang Xu of the eastern marsh.

**Biographies** record: Liao Fu of the Later Han, indifferent to worldly affairs, devoted himself to the classics, particularly astronomy, apocrypha, and divination by wind and celestial patterns. Though official posts were offered, he declined them all, earning the name "Master of the Northern Outskirts."

**The Tang Dynasty’s Biographies of Recluses** state: Wang Ji, styled Wugong, was appointed Assistant Magistrate of Liuhe County in Yangzhou but resigned to return home. He owned several dozen *qing* of land on an islet in the river, near which lived the hermit Zhongchang Zixian, who practiced dietary and meditative arts. Admiring his purity, Wang wished to live nearby. He built a hut on the islet, delighting in zither and wine, and was thus called "Master of the Eastern Marsh."

Dong Feng ate millet; Manqian stole peaches.

**The Biographies of Divine Transcendents** record: Dong Feng, styled Junyi, was from Houguan. Living on Mount Lu, he did not farm but treated illnesses without accepting payment. Instead, he asked those cured of serious ailments to plant five apricot trees and those with minor illnesses to plant one. Over the years, the apricot trees grew to ten thousand, forming a dense grove where birds and beasts played beneath, and no weeds ever sprouted, as if perpetually tended. When the apricots ripened, Feng told people, "Those who wish to buy apricots need not announce themselves—simply take them, exchanging one measure of grain for one measure of fruit." Once, someone brought little grain but took many apricots, and a tiger roared and chased them away. The grain he received was used to aid the poor and travelers, consuming three hundred *hu* annually, yet much remained. One day, he ascended to heaven.

*The Han Emperor Wu’s Inner Chronicle* records: Emperor Wu suddenly saw a girl in green robes and was told, “On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Queen Mother of the West will briefly descend.” The Emperor asked Dongfang Shuo who this was, and Shuo replied, “She is the Purple Orchid Chamber Maiden of the Queen Mother of the West, who conveys messages to and fro.”

On the appointed day, the Emperor, clad in his finest robes, stood upon the steps. In the deep of night, he heard the sound of flutes and drums in the sky. The Queen Mother arrived in a chariot of purple clouds, drawn by nine-colored striped dragons. Other celestial immortals, each a *zhang* in height, accompanied her. The Queen Mother ascended the hall and personally arranged a refined feast, presenting seven luscious peaches in a golden bowl. The Emperor ate them and found them exquisite. The Queen Mother said, “This peach bears fruit but once every three thousand years. Dongfang Shuo has stolen them three times already.”

Mountain fathers with raven-black hair, Yao Hong with green fur.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: Bo Xianfu dwelled on Mount Hua, cultivating his spirit without eating. After two hundred years, his hair remained dark as youth. Later, he transmitted his teachings to a woman, whose complexion bloomed like peach blossoms. An old man with snowy beard and brows once arrived, and the woman struck him with a switch. When asked why, she said, “This is my son. He refused to practice Xianfu’s method, so he aged prematurely. That is why I punish him.”

*The Tang Annals* recount: During the Tang dynasty, a monk lived on Mount Nanyue. One night, he saw a creature with green fur covering its body approach his seat. The monk said, “This humble monk abides in meditation and harms no living thing. If spirits and gods have awareness, do not disturb me.” The creature replied, “Do you know of the Jin and Song dynasties?” The monk said, “From the Jin to the Tang, four hundred years have passed.” The creature asked, “Do you know of Yao Hong?” The monk said, “I have heard that Hong is dead.” The creature said, “I am Hong. At the time, I feigned death to escape, roaming the blessed lands. Only the cold cypress leaves caused fur to grow over my body.”

The Queen Mother tapped time; Zideng played the zither with pride.

*The Collected Records of Immortals* states: The Nine Radiance Primordial Lady, the Queen Mother of Mount Gui, the Three Origin Ladies, and various perfected immortals descended into the Crimson Chamber of the Lesser Existence Pure Void Palace. The Lady and the Perfected Lord acted as host and guest, each commanding their attendants to arrange the celestial zither’s melodies. The Nine Voids harmonized in rhythm, and the Eight Sounds resonated with divine resonance. The Queen Mother tapped time and sang.

*The Han Emperor Wu’s Inner Chronicle* records: The Queen Mother commanded her attendant Wang Zideng to play the Eight Jade Pillars, Dong Shuangcheng to blow the Cloud Harmony Flute, Xu Feiqiong to strike the Numinous Void Drum, and An Faying to sing the *Mystic Numinosity* melody.

One asks the long-lived scholar—he is the mountain’s prime minister.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Long-Historian was surnamed Xu, named Mi, styled Sixuan, a descendant of the seventh generation’s progenitor. The Lord was broadly learned and of the highest rank, first serving as Magistrate of Yuyao, later ascending through the ranks to become Palace Secretary and Protectorate Long-Historian. He cultivated the Supreme Dao in secret, and perfected immortals descended frequently. A True Consort bestowed upon him a scripture, saying: "Jade nectar and golden broth, life-nurturing divine pears, square-patterned fire jujubes—these shall be given to the mountain-dwelling Daoist Xu, not to the worldly Long-Historian Xu."

Furthermore, Tao Hongjing, styled Tongming, passed the imperial examinations and was promoted to Reader-in-Attendance. At the age of thirty-seven, he harbored no ambition for officialdom, declaring: "Confucius said, 'Dwelling in tranquility to pursue one’s aspiration, practicing righteousness to fulfill the Dao.' Now that my righteousness is fulfilled, I have no further direction. I shall follow the path of pursuing my aspiration." Thereupon, he styled himself the Recluse of Huayang, removed his court robes and hung them at the Gate of the Divine Tiger, donned a deer-fur cap and Daoist garb, entered Huayang, and dwelled on Mount Jijin, where he compiled the *Declarations of the Perfected*. Emperor Wu of Liang repeatedly summoned him, but he did not go. Whenever the emperor had matters to discuss, he dispatched envoys to inquire, and the people of the time called him "the mountain’s prime minister." He presented the Dao before the emperor and served the immortals in the celestial realms.

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* records: Wang Fajin, from his youth, was devoted to the Dao. One day, he suddenly encountered two immortal youths who told him: "You possess the bones of an immortal and have not forgotten the Dao. The Celestial Thearch has commanded us to come and welcome you, to serve in the heavens above." Unaware, he followed the two maidens, ascending through the void until he stood before the Thearch, who said to him: "To dwell amidst the Three Powers is not easily attained. I entrust you with the *Code of Atonement* in one scroll. Descend and instruct the people—this, too, shall be your merit." During the Tianbao era, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Moreover, Wang Fengxian was a maiden of the Xuan people. In her youth, she encountered over ten youths clad in azure, playing and laughing with her from dusk till dawn. Her parents suspected them of being demons and questioned her. Fengxian replied: "What I have encountered is the Dao, and those I have seen are celestial immortals. At first, I beheld in heaven the ranks of heavenly beings, and one immortal said: 'You possess the bones of an immortal. Fifty years hence, you shall return here. However, the grains of the hundred crops harm one’s true qi.'" Thereafter, Fengxian abstained from food. She often told others: "The divine immortals I have seen in heaven differ not from those of the Daoist tradition." She then painted a scroll of heavenly beings in courtly assembly, naming it the *Chart of Heavenly Convergence*.

Yuan Yi compressed the cosmos into a gourd; Fei Changfang cast his staff aside.

*The New Record of the Alchemical Terrace*:

Xie Yuanyi, styled Master Gourd, numbered among the three thousand disciples of Confucius. He often hung an empty gourd in the marketplace to sell medicines. After the day’s business concluded, he would compress himself into the gourd, unseen by anyone in the market—save for Fei Changfang, who observed him from an upper story. Changfang went to pay homage and became his disciple.

Furthermore, when Fei Changfang of Runan served as a market inspector, Master Gourd, recognizing his sincere faith, said to him: "When I compress myself into the gourd, you must imitate me, and you shall enter as well." Once inside, the gourd vanished from sight, revealing only towers of jade and palaces of gold, their forms exquisitely wrought, with jade boys and jade maidens attending in pairs. The Master said to Changfang: "I am an immortal. Do you cherish the Dao?" Changfang pleaded earnestly, and the Master bestowed upon him the arts of exorcising ghosts and healing illnesses, though he could not attain immortality. He also gave Changfang a bamboo staff, instructing him to ride it home and then cast it into the Ge Marsh. Changfang followed his words, throwing the staff into the marsh, whereupon it transformed into a dragon and departed.

Wei Mountain’s Wang Qiao, Fan Brook’s Lü Shang.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals*:
Wang Qiao, styled Zijin, encountered Master Fuqiu and attained immortality. His friend Huan Liang met Zijin upon Wei Mountain, where Zijin said: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, I shall ascend to heaven. You may gather with my old friends to bid me farewell." On that day, Zijin and his former companion Wei Guan climbed the mountain, where they saw Zijin abandon his horse by the ravine below before ascending to heaven. At that moment, as Guan bowed in farewell, he turned to see the horse he had ridden also soar into the sky. The place is now called the Ravine of the Bidding Horse.

Moreover, Lü Shang, a native of Jizhou, was wise from childhood and foresaw life and death. To escape the chaos of King Zhou’s reign, he concealed himself in Liaodong for over twenty years. Later, he journeyed west to Zhou, hiding in Fan Brook, where he fished for three years without catching a single fish. A passerby remarked: "You should give up." Lü Shang replied: "This is not for you to understand." Soon after, he caught a fish whose belly contained a book on military strategy, said by some to be the *Jade Chime*. King Wen dreamed of a sage and, hearing of Lü Shang’s virtue, carried him back to jointly govern Zhou. After his achievements were complete, Lü Shang announced his departure. When his coffin was opened, no corpse remained—only six scrolls of the *Jade Chime* lay within.

Stone Master of the Eastern Palace, Guangli of the Southern Palace.

*The Declarations of the Perfected*:
The Great Lord Mao said: "Long ago, there was White Stone Master, who refined stone as his essence, hence the world called him Master White Stone. He was a perfected being. Now he has been appointed Right Immortal Minister of the Eastern Palace. He entered the mountains, severed himself from grains, and boiled stones for sustenance. The method for boiling white stones was devised by Stone Master himself."

Furthermore, the Middle Lord Mao said: "Han Taihua was the younger sister of An Guo and the wife of General Li Guangli of the Han. Guangli, having rendered meritorious service to the world in his lifetime, now resides in the Southern Palace to undergo transformation."

Ziyang’s summoned attendants, Lu Lian’s soaring ascent.

*The Preface to the Tianpeng Rites*:
Deng Ziyang entered Mount Magu, reciting the divine incantations of Tianpeng day and night. A golden-armored divine being appeared and spoke to him: "I am the Messenger of the Six Heavens of the North. Your devout recitation of the sacred scripture has been noted by the Lord Emperor, who has already recorded your merit." Thereupon, he bestowed upon him the true form of the Black Seal divine talisman, which possesses the protection of immortals above, the power to command spirits and gods in the middle, and the efficacy to heal diseases below. "You must keep this secret," he said. "In time, you shall become the teacher of kings." The next day, Deng indeed found the true form talisman within a stone chamber, and its practice proved efficacious.

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*:
Wang Lulian was the daughter of the immortal Wang Gang. Having inherited her father’s Dao, she entered the mountains of Luhun and never emerged. Later, she encountered the Perfected One of Grand Unity, who transmitted to her the method of *soaring ascent*. Through cultivation, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Guo Wen tamed tigers; Qu Jun rode dragons.

*Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals*:
Guo Wen, styled Wenju, was a man of Luoyang who dwelled in the Great Wall Crag. One day, a tiger opened its jaws before him as if to make a plea. Guo Wen reached into the tiger’s mouth and removed a bone. The next morning, the tiger brought a dead deer and placed it outside his stone chamber. Thereafter, the tiger remained docile at his side, so gentle it could be stroked and played with. When Guo Wen left the mountains, the tiger followed him. Even in the bustling city among crowds, the tiger walked beside him, its gaze meek, never daring to act fiercely—no different from a sheep or dog. At times, it carried books, salt, and rice back to the mountains. The Jin Emperor, having heard of this, summoned him to court and asked, "Master, do you possess some special method for taming tigers?" Guo Wen replied, "It is only natural. If humans harbor no intent to harm beasts, beasts will have no intent to harm humans. What method could there be? Treat me well, and even tigers become like the people; treat me harshly, and even people become like tigers. What difference is there?" The Emperor admired his words and offered him an official post, but Guo declined and retired to Mount Aoting.

Qu Jun was a man of Nan’an who, during the reign of Emperor Zhang of Han, lived in seclusion on Pinggang Mountain. The Yellow Emperor descended and transmitted to him the *Dragon-Riding Dao*, enabling him to control and ride cloud-borne dragons. Later, he entered Mount Emei to cultivate the *Luminous Mirror of the Grotto Chamber*. When he was about to ascend to heaven, he bid farewell to his family and friends, then departed riding a dragon. Today, on Pinggang Mountain, there remains Dragon Crag, said to be the tethering post of Qu Jun’s dragon.

Yellow Stone beneath the bridge; Li Zheng within the grotto.

*Records of the Grand Historian of the Former Han*:
Zhang Liang passed by an old man who dropped his shoe beneath a bridge. Turning to Liang, he said, "Boy, fetch my shoe." Liang retrieved it and presented it to him. The old man said, "You are teachable." He then set an appointment, saying, "Meet me here in five days." This occurred three times. Each time Liang arrived as promised, the old man said, "It should be so." He then produced a book and gave it to Liang, saying, "Study this, and you shall become the teacher of kings. Thirteen years later, you will see me beneath the mountain north of Qi, at the place called Yellow Stone. That stone is I."

The Lady of the Southern Marchmount said: "Sincerity is the hinge of gain and loss. Zhang Liang’s three appointments demonstrate his unwavering devotion to the Dao and clarity of heart."

*The Declarations of the Perfected*:
The Middle Lord Mao said: "Li Zheng of Henei once practiced the *Guardian Unity Dao*. Initially, he resided in Luoyang, but later moved to the grotto of Huayang, where he oversees the investigation of matters concerning the people."

Zhao Sheng slept in the open; Ma Xiang slept upon a wall.

*Biographies of Divine Immortals*:
The Celestial Master Zhang Daoling possessed the *Nine Cauldrons of the Great Essentials*, which he entrusted only to his disciple Wang Chang, saying, "Afterward, there will be one who comes from the east. He shall receive this. This person will arrive at noon on the seventh day of the first month." He described the man’s appearance in detail. Sure enough, Zhao Sheng arrived from the east. Though they had never met before, his form and countenance matched exactly what Daoling had foretold. Daoling tested Sheng seven times, and each time he passed. Only then did he transmit the *Scripture of the Elixir* to Sheng. The first test: when Sheng first arrived at the gate, he was not announced. Daoling had others curse him for over forty days, yet Sheng remained, sleeping in the open without leaving.

*Continuation of the Biographies of Immortals*:
Ma Xiang, styled Ziran, possessed the Dao. Once, while traveling through the borders of Changxi County, he sought lodging for the night. The host jested that there was no place to stay, saying, "You may sleep on the wall if you wish." As dusk fell, his disciples were anxious for shelter, but Ma Xiang said, "You may sleep among the crowd. I shall sit until dawn." Everyone else slept, but Ma Xiang leapt onto a beam, dangling upside down by one foot, his body suspended as he slept. The host rose in the night and, seeing this by candlelight, was astonished. Ma Xiang said, "If I can sleep on a beam, what difficulty is there in sleeping on a wall?" Soon after, he entered the wall. The host begged his forgiveness, and only then did Ma Xiang emerge.

Ji Qiu played the zither; the fisherman strummed his fishing line.

*Biographies of Immortals*:
Ji Qiu was a Daoist of Mount Tai. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he received rewards for his Daoist arts, his white hair turning black again and his lost teeth regrowing. When the Emperor made his eastern inspection tour to Mount Tai, Ji Qiu came to greet him wearing a *zhangfu* cap and yellow robes, holding a zither.

*Unofficial History of the Five Dynasties*:
Sun Miao, the governor of Xunyang, saw a light boat gliding over the waves near the islet, now appearing, now vanishing. Soon, a fisherman was seen angling, strumming his fishing line, and whistling in the clear emptiness. The governor asked, "Have you caught any fish?" The fisherman replied, "This is not fishing as you know it. How could there be fish?" The governor, struck by his words, gathered his robes and waded through the water to address him: "Sir, I perceive you possess the Dao. Now, in this era of civilized governance, why do you not assist in the bright and flourishing rule?" The fisherman answered, "I am but a madman of mountains and seas, ignorant of worldly affairs. I have not yet escaped poverty and lowliness—how could I speak of wealth and honor?" Then he sang:
*"The bamboo rod, the tangled line,
The river flows on, time’s design.
To forget each other brings delight,
The baited hook, the fish’s plight.
Neither Yi nor Hui am I,
Yet care and sorrow pass me by."*
With that, he strummed his fishing line and departed.

Dao Kai ate coarse food; Shi Tan wore tattered robes.

*The Record of the Thatched Pavilion*: Shan Daokai despised fine food and fine clothing, fearing neither hunger nor cold. He favored dwelling in the mountains, where mountain spirits and tree essences repeatedly tested him, yet he remained unafraid. Later, he moved to Mount Luofu, living alone in a thatched hut, remote from worldly concerns. Over a hundred years later, he underwent liberation through the corpse.

*The Unofficial History of Jin*: Shi Tan claimed to be a man of Beihai, with no fixed abode. He did not seek a permanent dwelling nor fine garments; when his clothes wore out, if someone gave him new ones, he would in turn bestow them upon others. When attending funerals, he would lean on his staff to offer condolences, regardless of distance or weather, arriving at the same time as others—no one could fathom this, deeming him divine. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Sima Baiyun, Wu Tan of the Purple Qi.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals*: Sima Chengzhen was skilled in seal script, creating a distinct style known as the "Golden Scissors Script." He dwelled in seclusion on Yuxiao Peak of Mount Tiantai, styling himself the Master of White Clouds. Emperor Ruizong summoned him; upon his return, court officials composed volumes of poems to see him off, which he titled *Records of White Clouds*.

Also, during the Han, the Emperor’s son-in-law and Commandant of the Cavalry, Wu Tan, styled Zidu, was a native of Beihai. When Emperor Wu of Han was out, Zidu appeared at the Wei Bridge, a purple qi hovering above his head. The Emperor summoned him and asked, "How old are you?" He replied, "Your servant is one hundred and thirty-eight years old." The Emperor questioned Dongfang Shuo, who said, "This gentleman possesses the arts of yin and Dao." Emperor Wu dismissed his attendants and inquired further. Zidu said, "In my sixty-fifth year, I sometimes suffered from back pain, dry mouth, and a runny nose. Since obtaining this method seventy-three years ago, I have fathered thirty-six sons and remain as vigorous as a youth." Emperor Wu received his teachings but did not fully master them; nevertheless, his longevity surpassed that of other emperors.

Qin Gao rode a carp, Huang An sat upon a turtle.

*The Master Embracing Simplicity* states: Qin Gao often wandered through the Jiang and Zhe regions, moving through the waters as he pleased, so that people of the time regarded him as a water immortal. Formerly, when he refined the elixir south of the Zhe River, upon its completion he scattered the dregs into the river, where they transformed into small fish. People thereafter called them "Qin Gao fish." Later, he roamed to Wu, where he rode a red carp and ascended to the heavens.

*The Biographies of the Immortals* records: Huang An was a soldier from Daijun. He was always seated upon a turtle, some three feet wide. When asked how old the turtle was, he replied, "Long ago, when Fuxi wove the first nets and traps to bestow upon me, its shell was already smooth. It emerges only once every three thousand years to avoid the brilliance of the sun and moon, and I have sat upon it through five such emergences."

Pearl garments and peach kernels, letters written on pomegranate rind.

*The Immortal Biographies of the Wang Clan* states: Wang Chu served as magistrate of Wangwu. He constantly recited *The Yellow Court Scripture* six thousand times, yet its profound meaning remained beyond him. After resigning his post, he ceased eating grain and swallowed qi. Entering a grotto, he found a stone chamber where an ancient scroll lay upon a stone table. Wang Chu bowed twice and said, "This humble servant has trespassed into this grotto-heaven, a meeting rare across ten thousand kalpas. Now beholding this mysterious scripture, I humbly beg to cast my mortal eyes upon it but once." Suddenly, a man appeared and said, "I am Wang Taixu, the Perfected One of the Eastern Pole. I composed the commentary on *The Yellow Court Scripture* and now bestow it upon you." He also gave Wang Chu a peach kernel as large as several *dou*, instructing him to grind and ingest it to cure illness and extend his years. "You may not dwell here yet," he added. "Wait another twenty years." Wang Chu carried the kernel and the scripture home with him.

From *A Comprehensive Survey of Divine Marvels*:

The scholar Shen Xie of Huzhou had a father who, in his later years, styled himself "Elder of the East" and frequently entertained guests. He brewed much wine to accompany the viands, and whoever arrived—regardless of high or low station—was invariably offered a cup. One day, a wandering visitor called upon him and drank face-to-face with the Elder of the East. Their lofty discourse rang clear and resonant, penetrating subtle mysteries. Day gave way to night, and though the wine jars were repeatedly drained, the guest remained composed and unruffled. When asked his name and lineage, he gave no answer but instead inscribed on the wall with pomegranate peel:

*The western neighbor, though rich, frets over insufficiency;
The Elder of the East, though poor, delights in abundance.
White wine is brewed to welcome fine guests;
Yellow gold is spent to gather rare books.*

Below, he signed himself "Recluse of the Sun-Return Mountain." The Elder of the East, drunk, lost track of him. After his departure, many took him for Lord Lü. The characters he had written vanished and then reappeared. Su Dongpo’s poem on the matter is quite detailed.

*Jiao Guang’s stone taro,
Yang Xi’s cloud lichen.*

From *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity*:
Jiao Guang dwelt in the mountains, where he would boil white stones until they were as soft as taro and eat them. At times, he would enter the mountains to gather firewood, which he would give to others. When the Wei dynasty received the Mandate, he went to live by the river, building a thatched hut where he sat without a mat. His body was filthy, caked with grime like lacquer. Sometimes he ate only once in several days, and he maintained silence. His appearance was neither old nor young.

Such was his life among men for over two hundred years, after which his whereabouts became unknown.

From *Sequel to the Biographies of Immortals*:
Yang Qing often dwelt on Mount Kuocang. Later, he traveled to the cliffs of Ruan Lang Pavilion, over ten *zhang* above the ground, where large seal-script characters were carved into the stone. Tradition held that these were inscribed by Ruan Zhao of the Han, but upon examination, they proved to be the work of Li Yangbing, who had once served as magistrate of Jinyun. While visiting the pavilion, he had composed a poem:

*From whence comes the traveler Ruan?
The clouds of immortals stretch across the cave’s mouth.
A place untrodden by mortal men—
Today, I walk within.*

Yang Qing, drinking wine with a Daoist of Jinyun during the flowering season beside the pavilion, suddenly collapsed as if dead. He was carried home, where he revived after seven days. He recounted: "At first, a person clad in dark-green robes with crimson trim, who called themself Lingying, invited me into a grotto palace. There, I beheld wondrous towers and halls, phoenixes and cranes, and from a stone cavern, something took flight. Lingying pointed and said, ‘This is the Azure Cloud Lichen. Those who consume it attain transcendence.’ I ate it and felt my body grow light, my steps as swift as flight." Later, he withdrew into seclusion on Mount Weiyu.

*End of Scroll Four of The Assembly of Immortals of the Three Caverns*
*Scroll Five of The Assembly of Immortals of the Three Caverns*

Chen Baoguang of the Orthodox Unity Dao, compiler of *The Lives of Eminent Daoists*, records:

Shanjun the Black Dragon and Shuqing the White Crane—

**The Biographies of High Daoists** states: The Daoist Wei Shanshi sought the Dao, wandering through famous mountains, where he encountered immortals who bestowed upon him the *Summons of the Three Sovereigns*. Thus he attained the Way of divine transcendence. He always carried a black dog named Wulong, "Black Dragon," sharing his food with it wherever he went. One day, intending to visit Shaolin Temple, the monks were at their midday meal when Shanjun led the dog to their side and divided his portion to feed it. A monk said, "Is it right to feed a dog before men have eaten?" Shanjun replied, "I was in error," and made amends. Soon after, he left the temple. The assembly watched as the master walked farther away, and the dog grew ever larger, until it transformed into a black dragon. The master mounted it and departed.

**The Traditions of Divine Transcendents** states: Wei Shuqing consumed mica and attained transcendence. In the second year of the Yifeng era of the Han, on the renchen day of the eighth month, Emperor Wu saw a man riding a cloud chariot drawn by white cranes alight before his palace hall. Startled, the emperor asked who he was. The man replied, "I am Wei Shuqing of Zhongshan." The emperor said, "You are my subject—come forward and speak with me." Shuqing had originally sought an audience with the emperor, believing he would be received with great courtesy, for the emperor was devoted to the Dao. But when the emperor called him a subject, Shuqing was deeply disappointed. He fell silent and did not respond, then suddenly vanished. The emperor deeply regretted his words.

**Ge Xiang sold medicines, Ji Zhu divined fortunes.**

**Sequel to the Traditions of Divine Transcendents** states: Luo Wanxiang, of unknown origin, dwelled long on Mount Wangwu. Later, he journeyed south to Luofu Mountain and sighed, "This mountain is the Vermilion Brightness Grotto-Heaven—Ge Zhichuan once dwelled here. Though Deng Tai did not detain him, I shall remain." He built a hut and secluded himself. Sometimes he wandered the markets, selling medicines and drinking wine, coming and going without fixed abode. If he ate a single meal, it might suffice for several men, yet he did not call it much; if he fasted, none knew the passing of months. In a day, he could travel three or four hundred *li*. Later, he no longer emerged.

**New Records of the Elixir Terrace** states: Sima Jizhu divined fortunes in Chang’an. Song Zhong and Jia Yi, both on leave, went to see him. Jizhu’s aspirations were lofty and wondrous; Zhong and the others suddenly felt lost, their faces blank, mouths agape, speechless. Then they adjusted their robes, rose, bowed twice, and took their leave. Upon exiting the market gate, they could barely mount their chariots, leaning on the rail and bowing their heads, utterly unable to speak. Three days later, Zhong met Jia Yi outside the palace gate and said, "The higher the Dao, the greater the peace; the higher the power, the greater the peril. Dwelling in resplendent authority, one’s downfall is but a matter of time."

**Tai Jingxian shattered a cauldron; Zhao Ming set a thatched roof aflame.**

**Supplement to the Traditions of Divine Transcendents** states: Tai Jingxian, of unknown origin, lodged in the Kuaiji market during the Huichang era. His dwelling was not fixed; sometimes he drank wine and feigned madness, thus passing ten years. Those intrigued by his ways began to suspect his strangeness. The Zhang family of Kuaiji often treated him with reverence. One day, he took a steelyard weight, pressed it in his hand for a long while, and stretched it like taffy. Taking an iron pestle, he hammered it into a cake, and after a time, it reverted to its original form. Zhang had long been poor. Jingxian said, "I shall depart." He told Zhang to take a cauldron and shatter it, binding the pieces with charcoal and piling them in a furnace. He kindled a fire, added elixir, sealed the door, and said to Zhang, "After the charcoal fire dies, you may retrieve what has been transformed. Use it to enrich your household. By aiding others through the Dao, your descendants may enjoy its wealth for generations." The next day, Zhang saw it was all purple gold.

**Baopuzi** states: Zhao Ming and Zuo Ci both used *qi* to restrain water, causing it to flow backward. They also kindled a fire atop a thatched hut to roast a quail; the quail cooked, yet the thatched roof did not burn. They restrained water in the central courtyard—though exposed to bitter cold, it did not freeze. Within a *li*, they could prevent the scorched from feeling heat.

**Qin fled to Peach Blossom Spring; Tian dwelled in Willow Valley.**

**Record of Peach Blossom Spring** states: During the Taikang era of the Jin, the fisherman Huang Daozhen of Wuling rowed his boat up the Yuan and Li rivers and entered a place where peach blossoms lined the banks, their fallen petals swirling. He saw a stone grotto from which a stream issued, its cold waters murmuring like jade. Dwellings stood in rows, pavilions and ponds linked together. Though the men’s caps and women’s robes resembled those outside, their garments were fresh and bright, their complexions radiant. Seeing Daozhen, they were delighted and invited him home, preparing wine and food. When asked about the present era, Daozhen told them all truthfully. They sighed, "How fleeting are the changes of the human world!" Daozhen took his leave, but when he later sought the path to the blossom source again, he became lost and never found it.

**True Reports** states: North of Mount Leiping was once called Willow Valley. A man named Tian Gong came to dwell there. To its north lay Willow Aid Water, also called Tian Gong Spring. It was said that this water was the flowing essence of jade sand; drinking it expelled the three worms from the abdomen.

**Weaver Maiden and Green Crow; Woman Transcendent and White Ape.**

**Record of Duchen** states: The Weaver Immortal Maiden was from Changsha. She entered the Dao and dwelled on Mount Heng. Though over eighty, her complexion remained youthful. She cultivated incense and fire offerings at the immortal altar of Lady Wei, living alone without companions. After several years, a green crow—shaped like a turtledove but with a red crest and long tail—flew to her dwelling. It spoke, "I am the messenger of the Southern Peak Lady. Because you cultivate the Dao with such diligence, dwelling alone in these desolate woods, she has sent me to keep you company." It also said, "The Queen Mother of the West is surnamed Wei—she is your ancestor. The Wei clan of Henan is the former mountain where the Queen Mother cultivated the Dao." Whenever people traveled to the mountain, the green crow would foretell their names. Later, learning of the many troubles across the four seas, she secluded herself on Mount Jiuyi.

**Supplement to the Traditions of Divine Transcendents** states: The Woman Transcendent Xue, of unknown origin, lived during the troubled times of the Jin, when the capital was in turmoil. Those who followed the Dao often took refuge in mountains and forests to avoid the world. She dwelled on Mount Heng at the Seeking Truth Terrace, appearing ordinary yet inwardly cultivating the true Dao. When she went out, yellow crows, white apes, and white leopards often followed her. Later, she ascended to heaven.

**Nie discoursed on inherent nature; Zhang expounded on returning to the origin.**

**Traditions of Divine Transcendents** states: During the Five Dynasties, the alchemist Nie Shaoyuan, styled Master of No Name, built a hut on Mount Wen Zheng, shunning worldly customs. He once composed the *Treatise on Inherent Nature* and *Secret Essentials of Cultivating Truth*. Xu Zuanzhen greatly admired them, saying, "Even Wu Yun and Shi Jianwu could not surpass them."

**Biographies of Eminent Daoists** states: The Daoist Zhang Wumeng, styled Master Hongmeng, once traveled to Tiantai, ascended Red City, and lodged at Jade Terrace. He practiced the guiding and pulling methods of Red Pine and the cyclically transformed elixir of Anqi. Emperor Zhenzong summoned him to lecture on the *Book of Changes*. He expounded on the hexagram *Modesty*, and the emperor asked, "Why speak only of *Modesty*?" He replied, "When things are at their greatest abundance, one should guard them with modesty." The emperor then commanded him to lecture on the *Returning to the Origin*. Wumeng said, "The state is like the body. When the mind is without action, *qi* is harmonious, and harmony gathers the myriad spirits. When the mind acts, *qi* is disordered, and disorder scatters the essence and splendor. This is the great purport of returning to the origin." The emperor was pleased with his words and bestowed upon him the title *Master of Peaceful Abiding*.

**Dongbin on Penglai Isle; Jing Shi in the Cloud Cake.**

**The Elixir Formulae** states: Lü Dongbin sat for the imperial examinations twice at the Ministry of Rites but met with no success. He declared, "Since worldly examinations bring no advantage, I shall cultivate the celestial examination." At the end of the Tang dynasty, he traveled to Mount Lu, where he encountered Master Zhongli and received the Dao. Thereafter, he cherished his *qi* with care. Peddling brushes and ink, he wandered between the capital region and Mount Heng, though few recognized him as Dongbin. The master imparted to him a secret formula:

*"The Three Flowers harmonize and transform into the Fire Dragon,
Emerging straight from the twilight crossroads—a thousand days’ work.
When the proof is complete, the crane-drawn chariot
First returns to Penglai Isle."*

**True Sayings** records: On Mount Shan, two Daoist practitioners, Zheng Jingshi and Zhang Chonghua, received oral instructions from the immortal Meng Deran during the early Jin dynasty and entered the mountains. They practiced the method of guarding the Five Viscera in accord with the days, consuming sesame and elixirs. Over time, they no longer required food or drink, their bodies grew light and strong, and they reverted to a youthful form. One day, the Northern Lord Lao dispatched Taiyi to welcome them with a cloud-plow, and they ascended to heaven in broad daylight. *Fang Feng met West White; Xu Yu encountered East Special.*

**Records of Verified Immortals** states: In the *Preface to the Great Classic of the Yin Talisman* by the Tang-era Prefect of Fang Mountain, it is written: "From youth, I loved the Dao and longed for longevity. Upon reading the *Yin Talisman*, I saw that it spoke of the immortals’ Way of Embracing the One, yet later generations only studied its methods for pacifying the state and governing the realm, seldom grasping the immortals’ supreme joy. In the third year of the Zhenguan era, I traveled to Mount Tai and encountered an elder who called himself West White, though his surname remained unknown. Discussing the *Yin Talisman*, he revealed that its essence lay entirely in the immortals’ Great Elixir—something the world could not comprehend. He then transmitted to me the commentary by the Mother of Mount Li, wherein the Way of Embracing the One was fully revealed."

**Biographies of Divine Immortals** records: Xu Dingci, a native of Pengzhou, served as a laborer in the commanderies and states during the Xianping era. While transporting silk and paper through the pass, he lodged at an inn in Huayin. One night, a scholar who called himself East Special greeted Dingci and sat with him. They found great affinity, drinking together for a day. As Dingci prepared to depart, the scholar said, "I am Chen Tuan. Because your bones are no ordinary ones, I chanced to meet you here." Overjoyed yet awestruck, Dingci earnestly sought esoteric teachings. The scholar replied, "The teachings do not prize the extraordinary; simply conserve your spirit, and do not let likes and dislikes inwardly harm you—this is most excellent." Then, from his sleeve, he produced a *daorui* of medicine and said, "Consume this, and you shall live a hundred years." The next day, Dingci sought him again but found no trace. Later, he too achieved *shijie* (liberation by means of a simulated corpse).

The Three Pengs severed, the Five Natures of Shangyuan perfected.

*Xuanwang Zhi* records: Qixu, a man of solitary and refined spirit and bone, dwelt in a Chang’an Buddhist temple. Fleeing the rebellion of An Lushan, he entered Mount Taibai, where he suddenly encountered a perfected one who urged him to journey to the Zichuan Prefecture. One day, ascending the mountain’s summit, he beheld a city with palaces and towers. In the hall sat a figure of imposing presence, adorned in regal cap and robes, leaning upon a jade table, surrounded by attendants. He asked, "Have you cut off the enmity of the Three Pengs?" Qixu had no answer. The figure warned, "Take care—you must not remain here." Then he led him away. Later, Qixu vanished without a trace. Zichuan was none other than the Perfected Lord Ge.

*The Inner Tale of Emperor Wu of Han* states: The Lady of Shangyuan said to the Emperor, "Do you love the Dao? You have frequently summoned masters of esoteric arts and ascended mountains to offer sacrifices, and the spirits have been moved. Yet your inborn nature is violent, your inborn nature is licentious, your inborn nature is extravagant, your inborn nature is cruel, and your inborn nature is treacherous—these five dwell constantly within your *rongwei* and the five viscera. If from this day forth you cast aside these five natures, return to gentleness and goodness, and ever perform yin virtue by rescuing those in mortal peril, refrain from spilling essence, observe abstinence and diligence, strike the Heavenly Drum, drink Jade Nectar, bathe in the Flowery Pool, and knock upon the Golden Beam—practicing these disciplines, you shall surely witness wonders."

You Jian served as *sizhi*; Lü Huai corrected and rectified.

*The Biographies of the Immortals* recounts: You Jian initially served alongside Zhou Fu as a gatekeeper. Later, he was promoted to Marquis of the Numinous Pass of the Northern Emperor, and then advanced to the office of Illustrious *Sizhi*.

The office of Illustrious *Sizhi* is comparable to the post of *Shangshu Puye* in the mundane world.

*The Eminent Discourses of the Hanlin Academy* records: Lü Huai was deemed worthy to memorialize the throne and was later posted to Anzhou. One day, as he sat alone in a small pavilion and closed his eyes, he beheld a vision—a youth clad in azure who announced: "The Jade Emperor is journeying south to the Scorched Continent, and you, sir, are to accompany him as *Douzheng Weixian*." From that moment, he partook of the Celestial Kitchen’s fare and wandered the Purple Palace. As the Scorched Continent was oppressively hot, the Supreme Deity bestowed upon him a single pellet of *Qingdong* Elixir. Lü bowed in gratitude and swallowed it; as it descended his throat, it was as though ice and snow had melted within. He knew then that his days in the mortal realm were numbered. Later, a certain Zhu Mingfu encountered him on the road to Xiangjiang, where hundreds of armored clerks and soldiers stood in attendance. Lü rode a jade-horned azure deer, and Mingfu bowed, asking: "Are you to become an immortal?" Lü smiled without answering and extemporized a poem:

By chance my merit was inscribed in jade towers high,
While countless robed in dust lie buried ‘neath the sky.
Now I follow the Emperor as *Sizha*—
Who else remains to stand guard at the Cypress Terrace nigh?

Jiwei was appointed *Dinglu*, and Sihe *Baoming*.

*The Records of Lord Mao* state: The Middle Lord Mao, whose personal name was Gu and courtesy name Jiwei, was nominated as *Xianliang Fangzheng* and successively promoted to *Jinwu*. Hearing that his elder brother, the Great Lord Mao, had attained the Dao, he resigned his post and entered the mountains. There, his brother led him to meet the Lord of the Western City, whereupon he achieved immortality and was appointed Perfected of the *Dinglu*. Furthermore, the Lesser Lord Mao, whose personal name was Zhong and courtesy name Sihe, rose through the ranks to become *Wugeng Dafu*. Together with the Middle Lord, he entered the mountains in search of the Lord of Life’s Mandate. The latter introduced him to the Queen Mother of Mount Gui, who transmitted the essentials of the Dao and appointed him Perfected of the *Baoming*. The Great Lord Mao declared: "Now that I depart to assume my duties, we may no longer visit one another frequently. On the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month each year, I shall summon fellow immortals to descend upon Mount Juqu. If any aspiring immortals or virtuous men arrive on those days, I shall attend to them and instruct those who have yet to awaken." Thus began the tradition of the pilgrimage to Mount Mao.

Dong was revived after death, and Gan healed the sick.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* recount: Lord Dong, a native of Linhuai, practiced *qi*-circulation and alchemical refinement, remaining youthful past a hundred years. One day, he was imprisoned on false charges and feigned death—his body rotted and teemed with maggots. When his remains were returned home, he revived and later ascended as an immortal. Moreover, Gan Shi, a native of Taiyuan, excelled in *qi*-circulation and abstained from food and drink. He received the *Yuansu* method from Master Rongcheng and applied it with efficacy, healing illnesses without acupuncture, moxibustion, or herbal decoctions. He lived among people for over a century before entering Mount Wangwu and ascending as an immortal.

The *Congshi* of Qingzhou and the Perfected of the Purple Palace.

*The Records of the Western Mountains* state: The Perfected Lord Huang, whose personal name was Renlan and courtesy name Ziting, hailed from Wuling. Renowned for his diligent scholarship, he later resigned his office to pursue the Dao. Ziting became a disciple of Lord Xu and attained his master’s teachings, serving for a time as *Congshi* of Qingzhou. Upon achieving perfection in the Dao, he ascended with Lord Xu the Perfected.

*The Lofty Discourses of the Green Jade Case* record: Sun Mian, a *You Shijin*, served as an official overseeing the women’s quarters in Yuancheng. The riverbank there was prone to collapse, and one of the women remarked: "A great thunder spirit dwells beneath it, emerging whenever the sky clears." Mian lay in wait and, when the spirit appeared, loosed an arrow that struck its neck. That night, he dreamed an officer summoned him, saying: "You have slain the thunder spirit; you are now summoned to testify." He followed the officer to an official residence, where the attendant declared: "This is the office of the Perfected of the Purple Palace." Mian asked: "What is the Perfected’s name?" The reply came: "He is the Duke of Wei." Mian recalled how he had once received the duke’s patronage and thought to seek his aid. Upon entering, he saw the duke seated upon a dais, flanked by azure-clad youths. Mian prostrated himself and implored the Perfected’s protection. The duke turned to his attendants and took a yellow document from a green satchel; a youth read aloud: "Five hundred kalpas are required to attain the preciousness of a human body. The damage to the women’s quarters was the fault of Mian’s duty." The duke ordered him dismissed.

Wang Hui plowed with tigers, and Lu Yu tilled with crows.

**The Biographies of Eminent Daoists** records: The Daoist Wang Hui dwelled at the Cavern of True Reality in Bear’s Cage Ridge on Mount Hua. He often cultivated yellow essence by the streamside, where tigers and leopards plowed and tilled for him. He would ride them in and out, wielding a whip and bridle just as one rides a horse, with no difference. He composed esoteric instructions to teach others the arts of self-cultivation, yet his methods were so recondite that none could fathom them.

**Unofficial Histories of the Tang** states: Lu Yu’s origins were unknown. A monk found him by the waterside as an infant. When he grew to adulthood, he proved intelligent and skilled in letters. Divining his fate with the *Book of Changes*, he drew the hexagram *Gradual*, and so took "Lu" from "the wild goose alights upon the land" and "Yu" as his given name. He secluded himself among the tea groves of the Han River, styling himself the Recluse of Mulberry and Ramie. He shut his door to write, though at times he would wander the wilds, singing and striking wood in rhythm, so that contemporaries called him the modern Jieyu. Lu Yu was devoted to tea and composed the *Classic of Tea*, earning him the title of Tea Sage. It is also said that Lu Yu plowed with cranes while crows tilled for him.

Wang Xianke gave charcoal; Xuanping carried firewood.
**Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals** recounts: Wang Xianke, a native of Hengyuan in Qingcheng, was kind and benevolent, his family wealthy beyond measure. The mountains near his home were rich in firewood and charcoal. One day, hearing the sound of thieves chopping wood, he went to investigate and found a Daoist, who explained: "I am refining the elixir in the valley, but I lack charcoal. I took this wood to burn." Xianke asked how much he needed and offered to provide it all, sparing him the labor. The Daoist gratefully replied: "When the medicine is complete, I shall repay you." Thereafter, Xianke visited often. One day, the elixir was finished, and the Daoist departed, leaving behind several grains of cinnabar. After consuming them, Xianke felt his qi flow freely and his body grow light. Beside his gate stood a great cypress. He leapt into its branches and ascended to the treetop, then soared away as an immortal.

**Extensive Records** tells of Xu Xuanping, a native of She County in Xin’an. During the Jingyun era, he secluded himself in the southern valley of Chengyang Mountain. Sometimes he sold firewood, and when drunk, he would chant:
*"Firewood sold at dawn’s first light,*
*Wine bought as the sun sinks west.*
*None ask where my path may lead—*
*Through white clouds, into emerald peaks."*

Fei’s ink turned stone black; Geng’s silver was forged from snow.
**Records of Mount Mao** state: Fei Changfang encountered the Venerable Pot and received his talismans, which he used to heal the world. Residing east of Mount Mao, he inscribed talismans to aid others. One day, he poured water upon a stone in a mountain stream, turning it black. Henceforth, it was called "stone ink." Even now, ink made from it can be used to write talismans.

**Biographies of Female Immortals** records: The female Daoist Master Geng was the daughter of Geng Qian. Once, during a great snowfall, she ordered courtesans to gather snow in golden platters and mold it into silver ingots. When cast into a blazing furnace, it instantly turned to gold, the imprint of her fingers still visible. **Records of Extraordinary Persons** adds: The master took snow, packed it tightly, and carved it into silver rods. When placed in searing coals, it melted into pure, gleaming silver.

Xu Ji’s horse neighed; Da Liang’s ox panted.
**The Biographies of Eminent Daoists** states: Shu Xuji, styled Dezhen, dwelled at the Bronze Horse Abbey in Xinfan. He often told others: "Long ago, the Yellow Emperor met with Master Xiao and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, along with a host of immortals, at this very place. They named it the Terrace of Three Assemblies. A bronze horse once hid among the trees here, and the Dragon Bridge marks its old path." Later generations built a terrace where the horse had vanished. On clear autumn evenings, the bronze horse would suddenly leap and neigh, and those who saw it would attain the Dao. Xuji lived there for thirty years, fortunate enough to witness it once. One day, he told a neighbor: "Tonight, I shall depart for another place. I entrust my affairs to you." He pointed to a spot and instructed: "Bury me here, three feet deep. I will surely repay you richly." That night, he passed away. The neighbor followed his wishes and buried him, discovering a full *yi* of gold. When officials investigated, they found only a staff and sandals in the grave.

**Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals** recounts: Feng Daliang was poor but devoted to the Dao, though he had no particular practice. Whenever Daoists or masters of methods passed his door, he would detain and entertain them. His sole possession was an ox that turned a millstone to sustain him. One day, the ox died. His wife, née Yang, wept in despair: "Our livelihood depends on this ox. Now that it is dead, how shall we feed ourselves?" At that moment, a Daoist from Mount Cimu arrived, staying for days as was his custom. The couple told him of their plight, and the Daoist said: "The hide and horns are all that matter." "They remain," they replied. He took them and stitched them into the shape of an ox, adding wooden legs. When he tied a rope to it and drove it forward, it rose and grew as sturdy as before. The Daoist then vanished. Years later, in the scorching heat, the ox panted heavily. A shepherd boy, seeing this, secretly loosened its mouth, only to find it reduced to hide and bones.

The Taihe Immortal’s crane-drawn chariot; Master Fa’s dragon carriage.
**The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan** records: The Perfected Wang loved the Dao. He and his wife entered the mountains, cutting off all worldly ties and devoting themselves to incense and meditation. After decades, a divine being bestowed upon him a sacred text, saying: "Your name is already inscribed among the immortals. Follow this Way, and your son shall also become a Perfected." One day, the Celestial Emperor sent a dragon carriage and crane-drawn chariot to welcome him. He ascended in broad daylight and was appointed the Perfected of Taihe.

**The Biographies of Eminent Daoists** states: When Master Ye Fashan resided in Siming, an old official suddenly appeared, weeping and begging for help. The master asked what troubled him, and the man replied: "I am the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea. The Celestial Emperor commanded me to guard the treasures of the eight seas. Recently, a Brahmin from Lǜpó has been practicing sorcery, casting spells day and night. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the sea will run dry. The treasure that governs heaven and anchors the sea is a divine artifact of the Celestial Emperor. It is about to be stolen. I beg you to save me with your cinnabar talismans."

The master then dispatched a flying talisman, and the sea waters returned to their former state. Another day, the Dragon King presented treasures and precious goods in gratitude, but the master declined, saying to the dragon: "Upon those rocky heights, the waters lie far away. If you could bring forth a clear spring, that would be most excellent." That very night, the sound of wind and rain arose in a rushing torrent. By dawn, a stone channel encircled the mountain retreat, its waters flowing in a ring—known to this day as the Celestial Master’s Channel.

Jade tablets record worthy names; golden scriptures hold wondrous teachings.

*The Extensive Records* states: Lady Wei, named Huacun and styled Xian’an, was the daughter of Wei Shu, Duke Wenkang of the Jin. From childhood, she studied the Dao, mastering the Nine Classics and all histories without exception. At fifteen, she yearned for the immortal arts of breath cultivation, sparing no effort in her practice. At twenty-four, her parents compelled her to marry Liu Ju, with whom she bore two sons. After instructing her sons to maturity, she bid farewell to her bedchamber and devoted herself to rigorous cultivation. The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and the Azure Lad of Fangzhu descended, addressing her: "The Most High has inscribed your immortal name upon the jade tablets. Strive onward!"

Another wondrous scripture tells of Lu Miaodian, a female adept of Mount Jiuyi. Born with keen intelligence, she was given *The Yellow Court Scripture* by a passing traveler, who told her: "This scripture is the golden text of the Great Emperor of Fusang’s palace. Recite it ten thousand times, and you shall become a divine immortal—if only you apply yourself diligently." The scripture declares: "Recite it ten thousand times to ascend the Three Heavens; a thousand disasters vanish, and ten thousand illnesses heal." Dwelling in the mountains, she chanted it as though joined by a thousand voices, yet only the indolent fail to cultivate. Miaodian entered Mount Jiuyi and recited the scripture for a decade. True immortals descended, and she ascended to heaven in broad daylight. To this day, her footprints remain upon the stone altar.

An old man steams a child; a youth boils a dog.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* recounts: The Ten Friends of Weiyang were wealthy men who gathered as Daoist companions, taking turns hosting feasts for amusement. An old official, clad in tattered robes, often joined their gatherings, and they never turned him away. One day, as the wine flowed freely, he said: "Though I am poor, I wish to host a gathering in return. May I?" The others agreed. The next day, he led them to a thatched hut where several beggars sat in a circle. He lifted a massive plank covered in oilcloth, revealing a steaming child. The group recoiled in disgust, refusing to eat. The old man said: "This is a thousand-year-old ginseng, rare indeed. I wished to repay you with it, but if you will not eat, so be it." He and the beggars divided the meal among themselves, then ascended to heaven.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* tells of Zhu Ruzi, who studied under the Daoist Wang Yuanzheng in the Great Answer Cliff. One day, he spotted two small spotted dogs near his dwelling and, intrigued, pursued them into a cluster of wolfberry bushes. There, he and his master unearthed two wolfberry roots, plump as dogs. The master ordered them boiled. Ruzi tended the fire for three days, tasting the broth first. Seeing the roots had softened, he ate them. Suddenly, he rushed outside, feeling his body grow light. He soared to the mountain peak, enveloped in clouds, and departed. Yuanzheng ate the remainder and thus avoided death. The peak is now called Boy’s Peak.

Gao Wen laughs at the crab; Cao Cao marvels at the perch.

*The Comprehensive Records of Marvels* relates: Gao Wen had mastered the arts of nourishing life and could drink several *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. When Shen Langzhong served as transport commissioner of Jiangdong, he often invited Gao to accompany him on his rounds. Once, while traveling by boat, they stopped at the Guichi Pavilion, where a recluse named Li of Jiuhua was an old friend of Gao’s. Shen invited Li to join them for drinks, and each consumed over two *dou* without showing signs of intoxication. Gao took up a fishing rod and said: "Let each of us catch a fish to amuse ourselves—but no crabs!" He cast his line into the brazier before them. Moments later, Li pulled out a crab. Gao laughed: "I said to catch a fish, yet you got a crab. You must be penalized!"

*The Biographies of Recluses of the Later Han* records: Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, once sat among the guests of Minister Cao Cao. Cao leisurely surveyed the assembly and remarked: "Today’s feast is lavish, with every delicacy present—save for perch from Wu’s Song River." Yuanfang, seated below, replied: "That can be arranged." He requested a bronze basin filled with water and a bamboo rod with bait, then cast his line into the basin. In an instant, he pulled out a perch. Cao and the guests were astonished. Cao said: "One fish is not enough to serve everyone. Can you catch another?" Yuanfang cast his line again, and soon pulled out another. Both were over three *chi* long, fresh and delightful. Cao ordered them cooked and shared among the guests.

Feng Liang abandons the world; Du Qi retreats into seclusion.

*The True Sayings* records: Feng Liang, once a county clerk, felt shame for his lack of aspiration. He smashed his carriage, slaughtered his ox, and tore his tattered robes, then devoted himself to studying the Daoist arts, his resolve stern and unyielding. The provincial and commandery authorities extended him ceremonial summons, but he declined. When the imperial court learned of him, the Three Excellencies vied to yield their positions to Liang, yet he refused. A man of the Later Han, at sixty-seven he abandoned the world, bound his belongings, and entered Mount Mao, where he now dwells in the Deer Track Grotto.

Another figure, Du Qi, crossed the Yangtze at the beginning of the Jian’an era and followed Sun Ce into Kuaiji, serving as Sun Quan’s commandant. In the twentieth year of Huangwu, he encountered Master Jie, who transmitted to him the arts of guarding the primal and refining the white. Thereupon he retreated into seclusion east of Great Mao Peak, where he could conceal his form and often appeared in bodily manifestation. Sometimes he would gather firewood or trade for clothing and grain, yet none recognized him. The Precious Grotto of Taiyi, the Immortal Ruins of Yuanzhen.

*The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Zhou Liang, styled Taiyi, studied the Daoist arts under Yao Tan. When others displayed such feats as flying sand or hurling stones—all manner of demonic marvels—Liang would hold the scriptures, recite, and chew the sacred words, whereupon the malevolent beings reverted to their true forms or perished at his side. He often roamed the precious grottoes with immortals, whistling and chanting through the day.

*The Extensive Records* tell of Xue Yuanzhen, who from youth cherished the Dao and at times dwelled among the Five Ridges. He said to others: "The Nine Doubts and Five Ridges are the abodes of divine immortals, where mountains and waters are secluded and wondrous, mists and clouds surpassingly strange—like the towering peaks of Yangshuo, the verdant spires, or the pure emptiness of the grotto-palaces of Boluo. One cannot forget them. Thus did Zhurong lodge his spirit upon Mount Heng, and Emperor Shun ascend as an immortal at Cangwu. The Radiant Ancestor left his traces at Goufeng, and the Yellow Emperor soared in his wheel-chariot at Dinghu. Why have so many lofty immortals, perfected beings, divine persons, and transcendent companions roamed these places in carefree delight? It is because the mountains are secluded and numinous, the waters deep and clear, pines and bamboo intertwined, clouds and creepers veiled in mystery—surely not a realm beloved by those of mortal frame or dust-laden heart. Moreover, within the profound grottoes, another heaven and earth unfold: jade nectar drips like milk, spirit herbs and magic mushrooms flourish. How could worldly eyes perceive them? Yet those who tread such paths, who attain the Way of extended years and wander there in ease—truly, what joy is this!"

The world speaks of feathered fans and dark-hued maple chariots.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* records: Wu Meng, styled Shiyun, was returning from Zhongling when he wished to cross the great Yangtze. There he encountered a furious gale and raging waves, yet he drew a white feathered fan and traced the water, whereupon he crossed over. All who witnessed this marveled.

*The Collected Records of Immortals* states: Xue Xuantong, styled Master Xuantong, recited the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* without cease. Divine immortals descended to him and declared: "Your recitation of the *Yellow Court* has borne merit; the earthly officials have repeatedly memorialized your name, and it is now recorded in the Purple Void’s archives." Thereupon they transmitted their secrets to him.

In the years of Xiantong, the Purple Void Primordial Lady descended to transmit the Nine-Flowered Elixir, saying: "Take this, and a paper chariot shall be sent to welcome you back to Mount Song." That very night, he dissolved into transformation, leaving no corpse. A memorial was submitted, and Emperor Xizong marveled at it.

*Explanations of Music Bureau Pieces: "The Water Immortal's Melody"* records: Boya studied the qin under Master Cheng Lian, who said: "My teacher, Fang Zichun, dwells in the Eastern Sea and can shift a man’s essence." Thereupon he took Boya with him. Arriving at Mount Penglai, he left Boya, saying: "I shall fetch my teacher." He poled his boat away and did not return for ten days. Boya heard only the surging of waters, the deep stillness of mountains and forests, the mournful cries of birds, and sighed: "The master shall shift my essence." He took up his qin and sang, suddenly grasping its wondrous purport. Cheng Lian poled his boat to welcome him, and Boya’s art thereafter became peerless in the world.

*The Lives of Divine Women* states: The Lady of Great Primordiality, surnamed Zhuan and named He, practiced the Dao from youth. She could unlock gates with a gesture, topple mountains with a point of her finger, and fell trees with a glance. Once, traveling through mountains with her disciples at dusk, she struck a stone with her staff, and it split open to reveal curtains, tables, and wine and delicacies. Thus she traversed ten thousand li in an instant, ageless and untouched by time. Later, she ascended to heaven from Mount Baodu.

Praise begets renown; seclusion stills the breath.

*The True Sayings* records: The Eastern Minister said: Long ago, Guo Chongzi and his three brothers were struck and wounded in the arm by evildoers. The three brothers flew into a rage and wished to punish them, but Chongzi said: "Anger is useless." He sent them away. Later, one of these men entered officialdom, and Chongzi’s praise for him was frequent and unstinting. The man came to thank him, yet the praise continued unabated. He said: "I am a wicked man; I cannot accept your kindness." Thereupon he took his own life. Chongzi later attained the Dao, but the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One declared that Chongzi bore the fault of causing a death and thus could not ascend as a Perfected Immortal of the highest rank.

The Eastern Minister also said: Liu Fenglin studied the Dao on Mount Song for four hundred years. Thrice he compounded the divine elixir, only for it to be ruined by malevolent spirits. He then moved to Mount Weiyu, where he sealed his breath and ceased respiration. To this day, over a thousand years later, he has yet to ascend as an immortal. It is said that he has merely attained undying life, without the power to command spirits or forces.

Harmony with the azure and purple; purity of the yellow and vermilion.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* records: He Zhizhang served as Director of the Palace Library. During the Kaiyuan era, he encountered Master Tonghe, who transmitted an elixir to him, saying: "First comes the covenant, then the transmission. Yet the ranks of immortals, like the azure and purple of officialdom, cannot be attained in haste. The first principle is to retreat from worldly ties. Retreat fosters few desires; few desires bring spirit at ease; spirit at ease enables non-action that accomplishes all. To seek the Dao otherwise is like spurring a horse in reverse to chase the galloping steed—take heed of this." Later, Zhizhang resigned his post and petitioned to become a Daoist.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: The Perfected of Pure Emptiness told Lord Yang: "The Way of the Yellow and Vermilion, the method of blending qi—these are but Zhang Ling’s means of bestowing progeny upon the world, not the true work of Perfected Ones. I have seen many who practiced these arts and perished without descendants, but none who gained progeny thereby. To fix the mind on sensual forms while pursuing the supreme Dao is like embracing jade to leap into fire, or interring a dog in a golden coffin. The sensual is called the Yellow and Vermilion; the supreme Dao is called the Hidden Writ."

The jade casket of Juanzi; the stone wall of Gongbi.

*The Life of Su Lin* records: Juanzi was an immortal of antiquity. Once, while angling by the river, he encountered the Lesser Lad of the Eastern Sea, who said to him: "You diligently pursue the supreme Dao, yet outwardly borrow fishing and fowling as a guise. To bait the hook without catching is the perfection of nurturing life. If you should catch a carp, try cutting it open." With these words, he departed. Juanzi soon caught a carp, and upon slicing it open, found within a jade casket. Opening it, he beheld the method of the Three Primordial Perfected Ones, bestowed by the Lord of the Golden Watchtower. Juanzi cultivated this teaching and gained the power to summon clouds and rain, riding the void to ascend the heavens.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* records: Zhang Gongbi’s origins are unknown. Master Liu resided at Cloud Terrace, refining his qi for over twenty years. At each of the Three Primes, he would attend the assemblies, departing in silence. The master inquired of him, and he replied: "Gongbi dwells beneath Lotus Peak." The master went with him to a place where they saw a stone wall towering a thousand fathoms high. Gongbi knocked, and it split open to reveal a world within—myriad phenomena arrayed in splendor. Zhang said to his disciples: "The master is here; prepare a feast and perform for his entertainment." His disciples struck the water, and soon a pair of blue dragons and a pair of white elephants danced with exquisite grace, while a pair of vermilion phoenixes and a pair of green luan-birds sang with crystalline clarity. They then offered the master a bowl of water and a knife-tip of powder, blending them for him to drink. The taste was sweet and fragrant. After a while, Gongbi bade the master farewell and departed. Looking back, they saw only the stone wall.

*Records of the Multitudes of Immortals of the Three Caverns, Scroll Six* begins.

Chen Baoguang, Orthodox Unity Daoist, compiled and noted:

Jade vessels fill themselves; clay gourds often stand empty.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Daoist Wang Yan, styled Ziyuan, studied under Master Jiao Kuang of Cloud Terrace Abbey on Mount Hua, receiving the esoteric scriptures and true teachings of the Three Caverns. During the Later Zhou dynasty, Emperor Wu, revering the Dao, dispatched envoys to summon him. Master Jiao said to him: "The Daoist teachings have declined, long bereft of support. You must strive to propagate them, lest they fail to flourish. From this moment, I shall depart." Wang arrived at the capital and, after some time, obtained leave to return to his abbey. The emperor then ordered its expansion for his residence. Yet the mountain’s rocks lacked soil, making its transport exceedingly laborious. Through silent prayer to Heaven, soil suddenly surged forth beside the abbey, abundant and inexhaustible. Often lacking oil, he set out a vessel, which by morning filled itself, and though used for long, never ran dry.

*The Unofficial History of Jin* records: Tao Gang, from youth, possessed lofty aspirations and lived with unfeigned contentment. By his dwelling stood five willows, so he once composed *The Biography of the Master of Five Willows* to describe himself: "The Master—no one knows his origins or name—lived beside five willows, hence his sobriquet. Tranquil and reticent, he coveted neither glory nor profit. Fond of reading, he sought no deep understanding, yet whenever insight arose, he rejoiced, forgetting even to eat. He loved wine but, being poor, could seldom obtain it. Relatives and friends, knowing this, would invite him to drink, and he would drain every cup, determined to become drunk. Once intoxicated, he would depart without reluctance. His walls were bare, offering scant shelter from wind and sun; his coarse robe was patched and threadbare; his gourd bowl often empty—yet he remained at ease."

Song’s prayers brought rain; Wu’s talismans stilled the wind.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Daoist Song Yuanbai, one day during a great drought in Yuezhou, exposed the dragon tablets in the courtyard to pray for rain. Yet the drought worsened. Yuanbai said to others: "The rain we seek requires Heaven’s decree; without an offering above, it cannot be summoned." He retired to Yuanzhen Abbey, burned incense, and supplicated all night. By dawn, a heavy rain fell, and the people of Yue marveled. Later, in Xinzhou, another drought arose, and the prefectural governor specially requested his prayers. Yuanbai then inscribed a talisman and presented it before the city god’s statue, whereupon rain promptly arrived.

*The Records of West Mountain* state: Wu Meng, styled Shiyun, once saw a violent wind arise. He wrote a talisman and cast it onto the roof, where a blue-black crow seized it in its beak and flew off. Moments later, the wind ceased. When asked the reason, he replied: "On South Lake, a boat was caught in this storm, and two Daoists cried out to Heaven for aid. Thus, I used this talisman to still it." Investigation confirmed his words.

The revered master tamed tigers; the reclusive scholar reared dragons.

*The Rustic Tales* recount: Yuntai Abbey in Guizhou was once a site graced by Lord Lao and Celestial Master Zhang. Among its residents was a Daoist named Pei Haozhong, whose origins were unknown. Though over a hundred years old, he subsisted on pine branches or refined his qi alone. Often, after clenching his fists and regulating his breath, he would sit in silent meditation with eyes closed, while fierce tigers docilely gathered at his side—fellow residents sometimes witnessed this. One day, he told his disciples: "I must depart. You remain here and diligently cultivate." Though his disciples urged him to stay, he wrapped his robe and ascended the sheer cliff as if treading level ground, swift as a flying bird or nimble ape, scaling the peak until he vanished from sight. Later, when tigers grew rampant in the countryside, villagers painted the revered master’s likeness to subdue them, calling him the Tiger-Taming Venerable.

*The Minister’s Former Affairs* state: When Chancellor Niu governed Xiangyang during a prolonged drought, a recluse—rumored to rear dragons—was summoned to summon rain. The recluse said: "Between the Yangtze and Han rivers, no dragons dwell. Only in a single backwater lies a black dragon, forcibly driven to wreak havoc, difficult to control." The chancellor insisted, and indeed, a great rain fell, flooding ten thousand households.

Gao Xian on the water, De Run in the jar.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* record: Gao Xiaoxian, known as the Immortal Elder, once accompanied the King of Wu on a voyage to the Three Rivers’ mouth. When winds stalled the fleet, many boats capsized, and the elder’s vessel vanished without trace. The king sighed: "Though the elder possesses the Dao, how could he not escape this?" He sent men to search. That night, the elder suddenly appeared, walking atop the water with robes and shoes untouched by moisture. Upon arrival, his face bore the flush of wine. Asked the reason, he replied: "Yesterday, Wu Zixu forcibly detained me for drinks, delaying me here to Your Majesty’s inconvenience." The king listened in silence.

*The Inner Transmission of the Celestial Masters* states: Zhang Zhongchang, styled Derun, was a great-grandson of the Celestial Master. Once summoned to court, he secretly returned, sighing: "I nearly fell into the world’s snare." In his chamber, he buried a jar. Though he ate meat and drank wine with his wife, by night he would enter the jar, remaining inside for days without emerging.

Red Pine the Rain Master, Yuan Zhi the Water Mother.
*The Biographies of the Immortals* say: Red Pine, the rain master of Shennong’s era, ingested water jade to instruct the Flame Emperor. He could enter fire unscathed. He journeyed to the Kunlun Mountains, dwelling in the Queen Mother of the West’s stone chamber, ascending and descending with the wind and rain. The Flame Emperor’s youngest daughter pursued him, attaining immortality and departing together. In the Gaoxin era, he served as rain master.

*The Unofficial History of Jin* records: Zhao Yuan Zhi once encountered a Daoist who bowed and led him into the water. They traveled through the night beneath the moon, mud clinging without soiling their feet. Beside them appeared a serpentine creature aglow with five-colored light. Astonished, Yuan Zhi asked what it was. The Daoist replied: "This is called the Water Mother. Those who see it become immortals."

Dong Yuan’s tolling bell, Jian Ming’s resonant drum.
*The Principal Biography* states: Qu Baiting studied under Master Huang Dong Yuan of Taoyuan. One day, he took leave. Dong Yuan asked: "Where do you depart to?" He answered: "To my grotto palace." Though the master wished to detain him, he could not. Baiting’s countenance radiated extraordinary brilliance; clad in a short hemp robe and black silk headscarf, he retreated three steps, then vanished. Dong Yuan and his disciples were stunned. Searching yielded no trace. The abbey’s caretaker rang the bell to assemble the community for a forest search. At the northeast edge of the woods, they encountered a great serpent blocking the path.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* recount: Daoist Zhang Jian Ming, well-versed in the *Laozi* and *Zhuangzi*, was summoned by the Gaozu Emperor, who asked: "Can Daoist principles govern a state?" He replied: "The Dao speaks of the wondrous subtleties of the myriad things. One who grasps its essence may govern the realm from the stillness of an ancestral shrine." The emperor praised his words, inviting him to the inner palace to lecture on the *Dao De Jing* and appointing him as teacher. One day, hearing the palace’s timekeeping drum, he remarked: "Does Your Majesty hear the drum? Its sound is singular. Though the five tones and twelve pitches exclude it, all are harmonized by the drum. The One is the root of all affairs. He who holds to the One may govern the realm." The emperor approved, bestowing the title Master of Penetrating Mystery. Later, he vanished without trace.

Wu Guang who clipped chives, Gui Fu who ate mallows.
*The Biographies of the Immortals* state: Wu Guang, a man of the Xia dynasty, had ears seven inches long. Fond of the zither, he ate the roots of wild chives. When Tang of Yin overthrew Jie, he consulted Guang, who said: "This is not my affair." Tang asked: "Who then is suitable?"

He replied, "I know not."
Tang asked, "What of Yi Yin?"
Guang said, "He is strong and enduring, patient of disgrace—yet I know nothing beyond this."
After Tang conquered Jie, he offered the realm to Guang, saying: "The wise devise the plan, the martial execute it, and the benevolent occupy the throne—such is the ancient Way. Why do you not fulfill this role? I shall serve as your minister."
Guang declined, saying: "To depose a ruler is unrighteous; to kill men is unbenevolent. Others bear the guilt, while I enjoy the gain—this is no peace. I have heard that one who is not righteous does not accept its emoluments, and in an age without the Dao, one does not tread its ranks—how much less when it exalts me? I cannot endure it."
Thereupon, he carried a stone and drowned himself in the Liao River, then concealed himself. Over four hundred years later, he reappeared in the time of Wu Ding, who again sought to appoint him as minister. Guang refused. Wu Ding sent a carriage to fetch him, but Guang fled, deeming it improper. He then cast himself into the river at Floating Mountain. Later, he wandered to Mount Shangfu.
*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Wu Guang clipped chives and entered the limpid springs of Qingling—such was his way.

As for Gui Fu, he was a man of Xianglin. His complexion shifted between black and white, red and yellow, and the people of Nanhai revered and served him. He regularly consumed cassia and mallows, blending them with tortoise brain to form a thousand pills, each weighing ten *jin*. Gui Fu was seen across generations, and to this day, cassia pills remain in the south of Jingzhou.

The immortal stream flows for Tan Yi; the hired hand becomes Master.
*The Supplementary Biographies of the Immortals* states: Tan Yi of the Tang was born at the end of the Kaiyuan era. As soon as he fell to the earth, he could speak, and within a few years, his body surpassed six feet, his beard and hair flourishing. His bearing differed from that of his elder brothers; he neither ate nor drank, and his stride matched that of a galloping horse. Later, he vanished without trace, and those near and far marveled, deeming him a divine being. His village built a temple to honor him. During the Dali era, he suddenly returned home, clad in a rosy cloud cap and feathered robe—a true immortal of the celestial stream. After bidding farewell to his parents, he soared into the sky and departed.

*The Biographies of the Immortals* states: Of Zi Zhu, no one knew his origins. He visited the King of Jiangdu, saying, "Master Xiao hired me as a laborer for over two hundred years, yet I have not attained true immortality."
The king thought him mad and asked where the master resided. Zi Zhu replied, "Atop Dragon’s Brow Mountain."
The king dispatched an envoy to ascend the mountain, and indeed, at its summit, they found Master Xiao—his body covered in hair, his ears broad, his hair unbound as he plucked a zither. Zi Zhu prostrated himself before him, and the envoy conveyed the king’s command. The master said, "This lord is the ninth-generation descendant of my neighbor. Do not meddle in my servant’s affairs."
The envoy then descended the mountain.

The master’s scripture gushes like a spring; Chang Hong’s snow flies.

From *Liezi*: When Hu Ba played the zither, birds danced and fish leapt. Zheng Shiwen, hearing this, abandoned his home to follow Master Xiang. Master Xiang asked, "How fares your zither?" Shiwen replied, "I have grasped it. Pray, let me demonstrate."

Thus, in spring, he plucked the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*—suddenly, a freezing wind arose, and grasses and waters congealed into solidity. In autumn, he struck the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*—a warm breeze gently swirled, and plants and trees burst into bloom. In summer, he plucked the *yu* string to invoke *Huangzhong*—frost and snow descended together, and rivers and pools froze instantly. In winter, he struck the *zhi* string to stir *Ruibin*—scorching sunlight blazed, and hard ice dissolved at once.

As he neared the end and commanded the *guan* note to harmonize the four strings, a balmy breeze soared, auspicious clouds floated, sweet dew fell, and sweet springs gushed forth.

From *Shiyi Ji*: In the twenty-third year of King Ling’s reign, he built the Terrace of Kunzhao—also called Xuanzhao Terrace—one hundred *zhang* high, from which he observed the colors of clouds. At the time, Chang Hong could summon rare marvels. The king ascended the terrace and gazed at the dense, swirling clouds when suddenly two figures arrived riding the clouds. Their beards and hair were yellow, and they wielded brushes of soaring dragons and flying phoenixes, drawn by chariots of green glass. Their robes were stitched from feathers and fur.

The king welcomed them to his seat. As the land suffered a great drought—earth cracked and trees burned—one of the figures sang and summoned frost and snow. With a single breath, clouds arose and snow flew, chilling all who sat there. The palace’s pools and wells froze solid, their ice fit for carving. The king then presented robes of fox fur and white fox pelts, along with purple bear-skin cushions—a tribute from the Western Regions.

Another figure sang, commanding the seat to blaze with heat. He flicked his finger upon the cushion, and a warm wind filled the chamber. The furs and cushions were cast from the terrace.

Xiao followed Nongyu; Du paired with Lianmei.

From *Liexian Zhuan*: Xiao Shi lived during the time of Duke Mu of Qin. He could make peacocks and white magpies dance. The duke had a daughter named Nongyu who admired him, and the duke gave her to him in marriage. Xiao taught Nongyu to mimic the cry of the phoenix. After decades of living together, when she played the flute, a phoenix would alight upon their roof. The duke built the Phoenix Terrace, where the couple remained for years without descending. One day, they both departed with the phoenix. Thus, the people of Qin built the Phoenix Maiden’s Shrine at the Yong Palace, where the sound of flutes could still be heard.

From *Shenxian Zhuan*: The Black Mountain Immortal, Duzi, was a man of Zheng. Dwelling on Black Mountain, he gathered pine nuts and *fuling* to consume, and after hundreds of years, he would appear now youthful, now aged, now comely, now plain—revealing his immortal nature. Duyang’s daughter was born with joined eyebrows, her ears fine and long. The people marveled at her, calling her a celestial being. When Duzi sought a companion, Duyang’s daughter delighted in him and stayed to serve him. Whenever they went out, they would grasp the calf’s ears and run, leaving no pursuer able to catch them. Zuo Taichong’s *Wei Capital Rhapsody* says: "Chang Rong refines her hues; Du pairs with Lianmei."

Zhang Lao’s bamboo hat; Meng Qi’s grass cloak.

From *Shenxian Zhuan*: Zhang Lao was a gardener in Liuhe County, Yangzhou. He married the daughter of his neighbor Wei Shu. One day, he took his wife away, saying, "I have a small estate at the foot of the mountain. I shall return by tomorrow morning. If you miss me in years to come, send your elder brother to seek me south of Tian Tan Mountain." He left for several years without a trace. Wei, longing for his daughter, sent his son Yifang to find him. Upon reaching the south of Tian Tan, a Kunlun slave greeted and bowed to him. They arrived at a grand estate with extraordinary pavilions, flowers, and trees. There, a man wearing a *yuanyou* cap and vermilion shoes, his bearing majestic, appeared. Upon closer look, it was Zhang Lao. He led Yifang into the hall, where his sister sat behind beaded curtains of jade, adorned in finery unseen in the mortal world. The feast was exquisite, and after days of hospitality, Yifang took his leave. Zhang Lao gifted him twenty *yi* of gold and a bamboo hat, saying, "If you ever lack money, go to the medicine-seller Wang’s home north of Yangzhou and take a thousand *wan* in cash—use this as your token." Years later, when the gold was spent, Yifang visited Old Man Wang, who indeed handed over the money upon receiving the hat. Thus, he knew Zhang Lao was a true immortal.

From *Xianzhuan Shiyi*: Meng Qi was a hermit of Qinghe, over seven hundred years old. He spoke of affairs from the Zhou dynasty as if they had just occurred, claiming he once attended the Duke of Zhou’s ascent to the altar, where he touched the duke’s foot, and the duke gave him a jade branch in return. Meng Qi always carried it, though it has since vanished. He often chewed cassia leaves for sustenance. When Emperor Wu of Han sought immortals, Meng Qi came clad in a grass cloak. The emperor found him extraordinary.

Li Mu subdued wood; the Guest twisted the loom’s shuttle.

From the *Guangji*: Li Quan journeyed to a stone chamber on Mount Song, where he obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Confluence Classic*. Yet he did not grasp its principles. Passing by Mount Li, he saw flames rise from burning wood by the roadside. An old woman said, “Fire is born from wood, yet disaster strikes and overcomes it.” Quan, astonished, exclaimed, “These are the secret words of the *Yellow Emperor’s Yin Confluence Classic*—how do you know them?” The woman replied, “I have studied this scripture for three *yuan* and six cycles of *jiazi*.” Quan bowed and begged for its profound meaning. The woman said, “I received this talisman and was listed in the registers of immortals—only then could I speak of the subtleties of the supreme Dao. The *Yin Confluence* is a secret of the Upper Clarity, revered by the Mystic Terrace. In governing a state, it brings great peace; in cultivating the self, it grants the Dao. It must not be recklessly transmitted to unworthy men. Those who leak heavenly secrets will sink through three kalpas—how can one not be cautious?”

From the *Bowu Zhi*: A traveler lived by the river. Every year on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a floating shuttle would drift past, never failing its appointed time. The traveler, secretly intrigued, prepared ample provisions, boarded the shuttle, and let it carry him wherever it went. Suddenly, he arrived at a walled city. Gazing ahead, he saw a weaving woman. When he asked her a question, she did not answer but gave him a small stone from the loom’s shuttle, saying, “Take this to Yan Junping in Shu.” The traveler returned and asked Junping, who said, “On the seventh day of the seventh month last year, a guest star trespassed against the Oxherd and Weaver—it was you.”

Cultivating mushrooms in the clouds, reclining in mist;
Eating pine seeds, drinking from the mountain stream.

From the *Xianzhuan Shiyi*: Wu Yun styled himself Master of Cave Sun. At fifteen, he devoted himself to the Dao, skilled in composition and proficient in regular and clerical scripts. He sat for the imperial examinations and mastered the Three Teachings and Nine Schools without exception. He withdrew to live in seclusion on Mount Yidi in Nanyang, cultivating mushrooms beyond the clouds, untouched by fame or profit.

From the *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: The Daoist Wang Yan, styled Ziyuan, loved the Dao from the age of nine and became a disciple of Master Zhengyi, Chen Baochi. At eighteen, he studied at Louguan and befriended the Perfected One Li Shunxing. Soon after, he visited Yuntai Abbey on Mount Hua and again took Fierce Void as his teacher, receiving the secret scriptures and true instructions of the Three Caverns. He nourished himself only with pine seeds and mountain stream water, seeking the truth of the Perfected.

The Controller of Destinies’ precious chalice;
The Old Man’s divine pillow.

From the *Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals*: The Lord of Destinies was ever present at the people’s gates. In his youth, he studied alongside Kang Yuanhuan, the Imperial Censor, and once bestowed upon Yuanhuan a drinking vessel—neither jade nor not-jade, its name unspoken. After parting, they never met again. One day, a foreign merchant from the Western Regions arrived at Yuanhuan’s home in the Eastern Capital and sought an audience, saying: “A rare treasure’s qi emanates from this residence; I wish to see it.” Yuanhuan showed him other objects, but the merchant dismissed them all. Only when the vessel from the Lord of Destinies was brought forth did the merchant prostrate himself, exclaiming: “This is the Celestial Emperor’s *Flowing Blossom Treasure Chalice*! When placed in sunlight, it emits a white mist that ascends to the heavens; when set upon a jade stand, its crimson radiance fills the chamber. This is the Supreme Lord’s treasure for guarding the Central Realm, yet it will not long remain among mortals—soon it shall take flight. He who possesses this treasure shall receive blessings for seven generations.” Yuanhuan placed it upon a jade stand, and that night, a red glow suffused the room.

The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: The Supreme Elder, whose name is lost, was seen by Emperor Wu of Han during his eastern progress. The Elder was hoeing by the roadside, a white light crowning his head. The Emperor, astonished, questioned him, and the Elder replied: “Your servant was eighty-five and near death when a Daoist taught me to ingest pine seeds and drink from mountain streams, along with a divine pillow containing thirty-two medicinal substances—twenty-four corresponding to the twenty-four solar terms, and eight toxic drugs to counter the eight winds. Now my years have reversed, and this is the reason.” The night march of Yan Qing; the midday slumber of Guo Zhen.

From the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*: Yan Qing of Kuaiji was poor and often made charcoal in the mountains. One day, a stranger spoke with him and, upon parting, presented him with a book, saying: “Your bone structure befits the Dao.” He also taught him the method of ingesting *shinao* (mineral essence). After receiving the divine text, Qing constantly sensed dozens of attendants following him. Once, as a regional governor passed by at night, he ordered his soldiers to seize Qing. Qing, in turn, commanded his divine retinue to detain them, and neither the governor nor his men could move. At dawn, passersby said: “This is surely Master Yan.” The governor’s family came to kowtow and apologize before he was released.

From the *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: Master Guo, styled Guozhen, was devoted to the study of divine immortals, forgetting both fame and profit, relinquishing joy and anger. He ate coarse food and wore tattered clothes, yet his resolve grew ever firmer. When suddenly afflicted by illness, others urged him to take medicine, but he said: “When the Dao prevails, illness vanishes—what cause for concern?” Such was his unwavering faith. One day, as he napped at midday, his disciples suddenly heard the sound of carriages and horses approaching. Moments later, the tiled roof trembled, and the master departed this world.

The celestial granaries of cavernous palaces; the numinous altar where stone stands forbidding.

From the *Records of Divine Encounters*: Xue Fang, Prefect of Mianzhou, dreamed of entering a cavernous palace where an abundance of delicacies was laid out. Someone told him: “This is the *Celestial Granary*.” Upon waking, he dispatched the Daoist Sun Lingfeng and a trusted official to investigate. Arriving at Changming County on the prefecture’s border, they found a cavern called *Celestial Granary*. The Daoist entered and saw stone formations arrayed like provisions—an abundance of food and drink, each with a distinct name, their flavors sweet and fragrant. He gathered some to bring back for Xue, but upon exiting the cavern, all had transformed into stone.

From the *Records of Xiangchuan*: The *Numinous Altar of Vermilion Mound* and the *Precious Cavern of the Great Void* align with the stellar lodge *Wings* and the celestial pivot, hence the name *Mount Heng*. The mountain has five peaks, one of which is the *Stone Treasury*. Many scholars, woodcutters, and boatmen here are versed in poetry. Once, an official from Guangzhou was traveling by boat when he heard someone recite:
*A lone oar west of Wild Magpie Shoals,*
*Moonlight stretches far to Dongting Lake.*
*Loath to pass before the jagged peaks,*
*My homeland vanishes beyond the horizon, wordless.*

The silent stone chamber; the spirit’s thatched hall.

From the *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: The Daoist Chen Guayan dwelled in seclusion on Jade Cloud Peak, playing the zither, drinking wine, and composing poetry, following his inclinations without restraint. His mountain-dwelling verse reads:
*Drunk outside my thatched hut, the gate left ajar,*
*Awakening to green mountains filling my gaze.*
*Where pine blossoms fall, gibbons still slumber;*
*Deer tread softly through the forest’s edge.*
And again:
*Ice forms a mirror upon the water,*
*Snow swept into jade-like dust.*
*Why ask of past or present?*
*Here is a man of the primordial age.*

When he was about to undergo liberation through the corpse, he instructed his disciples, saying: "Enshroud me in a blue cloth sack within the stone chamber—take care not to use earth or wood." At the hour of his passing, he presented his followers with a poem:

*I was formless, then briefly took form,
By chance came to the world, chasing after its bustle.
Now the debts of rebirth are all repaid,
I scratch my head in emptiness and return to the Upper Clarity.*

Another Daoist, named Xu Lingfu and styled Master Silent Hope, dwelled on Cloud-Cover Peak of Mount Tiantai. He built a thatched hut to live in, delighting each day in cultivation and refinement. He once composed a poem:

*Silent and still, spirit congealed at the Great Ultimate’s dawn,
Responding to things without intent, descending in a cloud chariot.
Cultivating one’s nature is not a matter of seeking—
To know the true essence is simply to recognize it as oneself.*

And again:

*To master the Dao and fulfill the True is in this life,
Those lost on the path wait for death before seeking rebirth.
If this life does not comprehend the principle of non-birth,
Even if you gain life, where will you be born?*

In the early Huichang era, Emperor Wuzong of Tang summoned him through the prefectural governor of eastern Zhejiang. Xu declined and never emerged, instead presenting the governor with a poem expressing his resolve:

*My rustic nature sings of the Three Joys,
Imperial grace descends from the ninefold heavens.
The purple palace’s decree is transmitted,
Sent down to White Cloud Peak.
I am shamed by the crane in the written scroll,
Deeply abashed by the dragon painted on paper.
How can I assist the enlightened lord?
I would rather grow old among the pines and crags.*

The governor reported his frailty and emaciation, and the emperor exempted him from service. Thereafter, Xu abstained from grain for a long time, entering stillness and transforming. Liu Kuan served as a prefectural commander, and He Kang as a gentleman of the Ministry of Works.

From the *Declarations of the Perfected*: Liu Kuan, styled Wenrao, was a man of the Later Han. Now, in the grotto-heavens, he serves as the commander of the Youthful Prime Prefecture, overseeing those who first embark on the Dao.

From the *Biography of Chen Wuji*: He Kang’s age was unknown. In his hometown, he served the Later Jin as a gentleman. When Emperor Zhangsheng made his eastern imperial progress, a commoner in the marketplace approached him by the roadside, claiming to be He Kang, former gentleman of the Ministry of Works under the Jin. The emperor, recognizing him as an immortal, secretly examined the records of officials that night and, finding the name, was greatly astonished. He sent men to seek him, but they failed to find him. He often spoke of this to Empress Zhuangxian, lamenting it as a regret.

During the Tiansheng era, He dispatched his disciple Yu Cheng to the capital to present golden, silver, and bronze Daoist statues worth tens of thousands. The empress, surprised, summoned Yu and questioned him. Yu replied that his teacher had sent them. When asked who his teacher was, he said, "He Kang." The empress was again astonished and asked, "Where is he now? Can I see him?" Yu replied, "He is in Huainan. Since your servant has come to offer these, he naturally wishes to meet you." Overjoyed, the empress sent envoys to accompany Yu to Huainan to seek him, and they returned together. The empress visited Hongfu Temple to see him. His words addressed matters difficult for others to articulate in that age, and the empress, displeased, dismissed him.

He Chong attained the ranks of immortals, and Ding Yi transmitted divine formulas.

From the *True Sayings*: He Chong, a native of Lujiang, rose through the ranks to become a minister. His family had long upheld the teachings, and he performed many acts of kindness and merit. In the second year of Yonghe, he underwent liberation through the corpse, transformed in the Southern Palace, and ascended to the ranks of immortals—all because of his many acts of kindness.

From the *Records of the Western Mountains*: The Perfected Lord of Wu, named Meng and styled Shiyun, displayed filial piety from the age of seven. In summer, he would not drive away mosquitoes, fearing they might leave him and bite his parents. At forty, a villager named Ding Yi taught him divine formulas. He later studied under Bao Guan, the governor of Nanhai, and obtained his esoteric methods. During the Huanglong era, a white cloud descended with a talisman, and thereafter the Dao flourished between Wu and Jin.

The Vermilion Talismans of the Lady of Xiang, the Green Satchel of Master Guo.

From the *Biographies of Female Immortals*: During the Zhenyuan era of the Tang, there lived in Xiangtan an elderly woman who never revealed her surname, known only as the Lady of Xiang. For over a decade, she would lodge with others, healing illnesses with vermilion talismanic script. No affliction in the village failed to respond to her remedies. Her hair was as thick as clouds, her skin as pure as snow. Leaning on her staff and dragging her sandals, she could traverse hundreds of *li* in a day. One day, she encountered a Daoist, and their meeting filled them both with joy. When asked about the Daoist, he replied, "This is Lady Fan, wife of the Perfected Lord Liu Gang." Only then was it known that the Lady of Xiang was none other than Lady Fan.

From the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*: The Jin scholar Guo Pu was deeply versed in the classics, broad in learning, and possessed of great talent, though he was reticent in speech. His *fu* poetry stood as the finest of the Restoration era, and his passion for ancient wonders was matched only by his mastery of yin-yang arts. There was a certain Master Guo who resided as a guest in Hebei, excelling in divination. Guo Pu studied under him, and the master bestowed upon him the nine scrolls of the *Green Satchel Writings*. From that time, Guo Pu’s command of the Five Phases, celestial patterns, divination, and the arts of averting disaster and transforming fortune became boundless—surpassing even Jing Fang and Guan Lu. His disciple Zhao Zai once stole the *Green Satchel Writings*, but before he could read them, they were consumed by fire.

"When the child’s spring is exhausted, one wanders into the throes of illness."

From the *Records of the Uncanny*: Du Zichun had squandered his family’s fortune and fallen into destitution. An old man gave him three million coins without revealing his name before departing. Within a year, Du had spent it all, descending from horse to donkey, then from donkey to foot. The old man appeared again, giving him ten million coins. Years later, Du was poorer than before. The old man gave him thirty million coins, saying, "If this does not cure you, your poverty has entered the inmost marrow."

From the *Hidden Recluses of the Tang History*: Tian Youyan, a native of Sanyuan in Jingzhao, was initially appointed as a student of the Imperial Academy. His mother and wife both harbored aspirations beyond the mundane world. Later, he entered Mount Ji, where he built a hut beside the shrine of Xu You and resided there, calling himself "Xu You’s eastern neighbor." During the *Tiaolu* era, Emperor Gaozong visited Mount Song and dispatched the Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat, Xue Yuanchao, to inquire after his mother. Youyan emerged in a field-worker’s cap and gown to pay his respects. The emperor ordered his attendants to support him, saying, "Has the Master’s cultivation of the Dao in the mountains fared well?" Youyan replied, "Your servant’s love for springs and rocks has entered the inmost marrow, and his passion for mist and clouds has become a chronic malady. Now that I have encountered this sagely age, I am fortunate to wander freely." The emperor said, "In obtaining you today, how is it different from the Han’s acquisition of the Four Hoary Ones?" Xue Yuanchao said, "When Emperor Gaozu of Han sought to depose his heir and install a concubine’s son, the Yellow and Qi elders only then emerged—how could it compare to Your Majesty’s reverence for recluses, personally inquiring after those dwelling in caves and cliffs?" The emperor was greatly pleased.

Wang Zhi’s axe-handle rotted; Xu Jia’s bones withered.
From the *Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*: Wang Zhi, a native of Liyang, once entered the mountains to fell trees. By chance, he came upon a stone chamber where several youths were playing chess. Zhi sat upon his axe-handle to watch. The youths gave him jujubes to eat, and he felt neither hunger nor thirst. Before the game concluded, one youth said, "You may go now—you have already been here too long." Zhi rose to find his axe-handle decayed to rot. When he returned home, not a single relative remained alive.

Later, he entered the mountains and ascended to heaven, and today in Quzhou there is Mount Lanke.

From the *Accounts of Divine Immortals*: When Laozi crossed the western pass, the magistrate Yin Xi, knowing he was no ordinary man, followed him to inquire about the Dao. At the time, a retainer named Xu Jia had been hired for a daily wage of one hundred coins, and over time, Laozi owed him seven million two hundred thousand coins. When Xu Jia saw Laozi departing far beyond the pass, he sought repayment in vain and composed a complaint to submit to the magistrate. Yin Xi, greatly alarmed upon receiving it, went to see Laozi. Laozi asked Xu Jia, "You should have died long ago. I once hired you because my office was humble and my household poor, with no one to serve me, so I gave you the talisman of Great Mystery to sustain you until today. Why do you now accuse me?" He then had Xu Jia open his mouth toward the ground, and the talisman of Great Mystery immediately emerged, its cinnabar script as fresh as new. Xu Jia at once crumbled into a heap of withered bones.

Ping Zhongjie studied the Dao, observing how disciples served their masters.

From the *Declarations of the Perfected*: There was a Daoist student named Ping Zhongjie, a man of Hezhong, who crossed the river to enter Mount Kuocang and received instruction from Master Song. He cultivated the Way of the Mind-Mirror, mastered the hundred spirits, and practiced the affairs of the Grotto Chamber. After forty-five years of such devoted refinement, his body grew younger, and his form was filled with true qi. On the first day of the fifth month this year, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi sent an envoy to welcome him, and that very day he rode the clouds and mounted a dragon, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. He now dwells in the Cloud Terrace of Canglang.

Another, Huang Guanzhi, from youth was fond of studying the Dao, and his family revered his master, bowing in homage morning after morning and praying for long life. After forty-nine years of such devotion, the Supreme Perfected tested him with one hundred forty trials, all of which he passed. Thereupon, he was given the Golden Elixir and entered Mount Jiao to recite the *Great Cavern Scripture*. He was later appointed to the office of Right Minister of the Grand Ultimate—a man of resolve, whose attainment was not due to his master’s power but to the steadfastness of his own heart.

The Garden Guest’s silkworm cocoons; the giant oranges of Baqiong.

From the *Supplement to the Accounts of Immortals*: The Garden Guest was a man of Jiyin, handsome and virtuous in appearance. The people of his village offered him their daughters in marriage, but he never accepted. He often cultivated five-colored fragrant herbs and, after decades of consuming them, one day saw a five-colored moth alight upon the tips of his plants. He clothed it and provided it a bed, and from it emerged silkworms that spun cocoons. When the time came, a woman appeared at midnight, calling herself the Guest’s wife, and explained the state of the silkworms. The Guest went with her and obtained one hundred twenty cocoons, each as large as a jar. It took sixty days to unwind a single cocoon, and when all was done, they departed together—none knew where they went. The people of Qi and Yin later established a shrine to the Flower Silkworm in his honor.

From the *Records of Marvels*: A man of Baqiong, whose surname is unknown, owned an orange grove. After the frost, he gathered all the fruit, save two enormous oranges, each as large as a three- or four-dou jar. The man of Ba, astonished, cut them open and found within each a pair of elderly gentlemen, their hair and brows white, calmly playing chess. They showed no alarm. One said, "What a pity we did not take root deeply enough to enjoy the full pleasure of this game." The other replied, "You owe me: the seventh daughter of the Dragon King of the Sea’s hair, ten taels; Zhihuang’s yellow forehead ornaments, twelve pieces; a purple brocade quilt, one set; two bushels of rosy cloud fruit from the Crimson Terrace Mountain; nine *hu* of jade dust from Yingzhou. Also, four jars of marrow-congealing wine from Mother A; eight pairs of cloud-soaring silk stockings from Mother A’s daughter, the flying maiden Xiong Feiniang. Repay me later at Master Wang’s thatched cottage on Mount Qingcheng." One said, "The joy of the orange grove is no less than that of Mount Shang." The other said, "I am famished."

From his sleeve, he drew a piece of dragon-root jerky. It resembled a grass root, roughly an inch in diameter, its form twisting and coiling like a dragon, every scale and whisker rendered in perfect detail. He pared and ate it, and as he shaved it away, the piece replenished itself. After finishing, he rinsed his mouth with water, and it transformed into a dragon. The two immortals mounted it together, and beneath their feet, clouds billowed forth. In an instant, wind and rain darkened the sky, and their whereabouts became unknown.

Golden walls and crimson gates, the Clear Capital and the Purple Tenuity.

*Lost Histories* records: There was a scholar named Cui who, at the foot of Mount Qingcheng, discovered a cave leading to golden walls and crimson gates. A transcendent elder, clad in feathered robes and a radiant cloak, offered him wine and food, then gave his daughter in marriage. He presented Cui with two pills from his green satchel, instructing him to take them. Thereafter, on the first and fifteenth of each month, Cui would ride a crane to the celestial pharmacy for his audience. After a year, he requested to return home and was given a talisman of invisibility. He then roamed the imperial palace in secret, stealing brocades and silks. The emperor ordered Luo Gongyuan to divine his location, and indeed, Cui was found behind the palace. The emperor commanded his flogging to death, but Gongyuan said, "This man already dwells in the upper realms. To kill him would not bring fortune to the state." The emperor dispatched guards to escort him to the mouth of the cave on Mount Qingcheng, where they beheld the golden walls and crimson gates. Cui’s wife tossed a scarf, which transformed into a five-colored rainbow bridge, bidding him cross. With each step, the bridge vanished behind him. Soon, clouds and mist enveloped all, and only the sounds of phoenixes, cranes, and celestial music lingered.

*The Book of Liezi* states: King Mu of Zhou visited the palace of the Transformed Man. Its halls were wrought of gold and silver, adorned with pearls and jade, rising above the clouds and rain, with no earthly foundation in sight. From afar, it resembled a bank of piled clouds. All that his eyes beheld, his ears heard, his nose inhaled, and his mouth tasted were beyond mortal ken. The king truly believed it to be the Clear Capital and the Purple Tenuity, the abode of the Celestial Emperor, where the vast music of the Highest Heaven resounded. Yet when he looked down, the palaces and pavilions appeared no more than stacked clods or heaped straw.

To partake of cypress and pine, to guard subtlety and consume lingzhi.

*The Tang Historical Anecdotes* records: Wang Xiyi secluded himself on Mount Song, subsisting on pine and cypress leaves. At over seventy, his sinews remained supple and strong. When Emperor Minghuang toured the region, he summoned Xiyi to his temporary court and consulted him on governance. Their conversation left the emperor deeply impressed.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* states: The Daoist Li Shouwei, of unknown origin, often wandered in Shu. His speech was witty and unrestrained, unburdened by petty conventions, and people often slighted him. Suddenly, he announced, "I shall journey to the Five Sacred Mountains. I depart now." When asked about seeking profit or advantage, he replied, "This floating life is but a fleeting instant. Why not seek truth and visit the Dao, casting off the dusty net of the world? As for refining qi, concocting elixirs, consuming lingzhi, and fasting—all these are beneficial. Why cling to trifling gains?" With that, he vanished. He once shared a close friendship with Han Yu of the Ministry of Rites, who gifted him a poem:

*"A youthful face beneath aged years,
Poor and cold, yet you wander noble halls.
Though your cultivation of primal qi is great,
Your heart is lost, and your spirit’s path strays further still.
A staff carved with dragon scales, lean and jagged,
A cloak of crane feathers, tattered and worn.
Why not return to your old hermitage,
Where the peach blossoms have bloomed and fallen times untold?"*
*(Note: "Fallen" pronounced in the departing tone.)*

Bo Yu took a wife; Ji Zi returned a child.

*The Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* records: Chu Boyu, styled Yuanqu, was a native of Qiantang in Wu Commandery. When his father arranged for him to take a wife and brought her through the front gate, Boyu slipped out the back and went to Mount Pubu in Kuaiji to cultivate the Dao. He also traveled to Mount Heng, journeying into Min, where rushing torrents plunged into perilous gorges. As evening fell, Boyu’s boat moored at the riverbank, but a sudden gale and mountain flood surged forth, hurling the vessel into a chasm thousands of feet deep. The boatmen ahead were certain it had shattered to pieces. Yet when they searched along the banks, they found Boyu sitting calmly, unperturbed. Later, he went to Mount Huo to refine qi and nourish his radiance, fasting for years on end.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Ji Zixun, a native of Qi, was recommended for filial piety and appointed Gentleman of the Palace, then Prefect. Though over two hundred years old, his complexion showed no sign of aging. Once, he asked to hold a neighbor’s infant, but accidentally dropped it, and the child died. The family, who revered Zixun, buried the child at once. Twenty days later, Zixun returned from outside, carrying the child and returning it to them. Fearful it was a ghost, they dug up the grave, finding only mud within.

The layman wears straw sandals; the Daoist dons hempen robes.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Transcendents* records: Zhu Taochui, a native of Chengdu, dwelled in seclusion outside the city, weaving a hut of grass. Sometimes he feigned madness, at others, he remained silent all day. The governor of Yizhou, Dou Gui, summoned him to office, but he refused. When Dou sent him clothing, he cast it aside and fled. He often wove straw sandals and left them by the roadside. Travelers who saw them would leave rice in their place, and Taochui would collect it at dusk. People called him the Layman Recluse.

*The Nocturnal Discourses of Lingzhai* records: There was a man named Shi Zong, known as the Hemp-Robed Daoist. He conversed with Bai Tudi of Guangling and Tan Qi of Jiangdu, his words boundless and unfettered. He asked for paper and composed a poem:

*"Desire’s hunger is never sated,
But desirelessness brings no sorrow.
Better still is the man of pure emptiness,
Who girds himself with rope and dons a dark robe.
Roaming freely through the land,
Adrift like an untethered boat.
One must extinguish worldly cares,
And dwell in peace on an ancient mountain."*
Tan Qi marveled at his words. Tao Yuanming’s *Record of the White Earth Embankment* notes that Bai Tudi encountered three extraordinary monks—this was one of them.

There was a mad Daoist who borrowed salt from Haiyan. He had his young attendant climb a small hill, where stood several thatched huts. Three or four Daoists greeted them warmly. Their speech was incomprehensible, but the boy was given a bowl of something sweet as malt sugar. Another Daoist asked, "When will the banished one’s term end?" The reply: "At the White Earth Embankment in Guangling, north of the river in Xuzhou. By my reckoning, his exile should be complete." He then wrote a letter and gave it to the boy, saying, "Deliver this. Tie it to the boy’s belt and send him back to Haiyan." The master joyfully asked, "What is in the letter?"

The letter contained only a few written words.

Again he called out to ask, "Where has the boy gone?"
The young attendant replied, "A Daoist ahead seized his staff and drifted away. I heard only the sound of waves beneath his feet as he reached a mountain. Someone in the mountain entrusted a letter for the White Earth Embankment, which he tied to my belt and showed to me, though I could not understand a word of it."
The boy returned to Shi Zong, who exclaimed in astonishment, "Have you truly come from Penglai Mountain?"

**Clerks of the Underworld, Ghostly Immortals of Mansheng**

From *Beimeng Suoyan*:
The Daoist Qin Baoyan was diligent in his devotions and once addressed the Southern Peak Perfected Lord, saying, "Why do the Highest Perfected require paper money? I do not yet understand."
That night, he dreamed the Perfected Lord replied, "Paper money is what the clerks of the underworld rely upon—what need have I for it?"
Thereafter, those in the prisons placed even greater faith in this.

From *Zhiyi*:
In western Shu, Cui Cun sought the Dao and pursued the Perfected on the western peak of Wangwu. There he saw Shi Yannian Mansheng and Su Shunqin Zimei seated facing each other across a narrow stream. Cun bowed twice and said, "I have long since abandoned worldly rank and profit to seek the Great Dao. Today, I am fortunate to encounter two immortals here. The Han River appears shallow at a glance, yet its depths cannot be fathomed—why may I not stand in attendance at your side?"
He then asked, "Have the learned scholars truly become ghostly immortals?"
Su replied, "Absurd! Pure yang is immortal; pure yin is ghost. How can one be both immortal and ghost?"
The two immortals then commanded a blue lad to take a bamboo writing tube and compose a poem for Cun. As Cun received the poem, he suddenly saw a kingfisher bring a letter and place it before the two immortals. Su said, "The Lord of Yingzhou summons us."
They then soared to the summit of Mount Yu, vanishing in flight. With a single bound, the humble clerk was swiftly promoted.

*The Biographies of the Immortals* records: Zhu Zizhu, of unknown origin, once ascended Rock Mountain and declared, "This mountain holds cinnabar—several hundred catties may be obtained." Magistrate Zhang, having heard this, immediately sealed the mountain, whereupon the cinnabar flowed forth like fire. Zhu Zizhu gathered the cinnabar and gave it to the magistrate to consume. After five years of ingesting the elixir, Zhang’s body grew light and he could soar aloft, whereupon he departed in flight with Zhu Zizhu.

*The Extensive Records* states: Lady Xu, mother of Wei Xiaozhen, maintained widowhood to serve her parents-in-law with such filial devotion that her reputation spread far. She had but one daughter, twelve years of age, who was bright and clever. Though free of illness, the girl died, yet before her burial, she revived and said: "At first, I heard a summons for Wei Xiaozhen to ascend to heaven. There, I saw that all the celestial beings wore brocade and embroidered robes. I was led before the Lord of Life and Destiny, who declared, 'Your nine-times-great-grandfather rendered service to the state and was recently promoted to govern the underworld. Now he has been elevated to the rank of earthbound immortal. Your mother’s filial virtue has already raised her to the ranks of the immortals, while your three previous lives have been reborn in heaven.'" Thereafter, Xiaozhen devoted herself to the Dao, and in the Changqing era, she ascended to immortality.

Guo carried burdens; Huang towed boats.
*The Declarations of the Perfected* recounts: Guo Guan, orphaned in youth and without support, served Master Zheng of the Sui as a porter for seven years, enduring hardship without complaint. Moved by his toil, the master taught him methods of guiding and pulling *qi*, extending his lifespan to three hundred years. Later, he encountered Red Pine Master, who transmitted the Daoist arts, and now dwells in the Great Existence Grotto as a perfected one.

*The Extensive Records* tells of Huang Qi, a minor general of Shu, who long pursued the Dao and performed hidden acts of merit for many years. While crossing Chaotian Ridge, he met an old man whose complexion was like that of an infant and whose skin gleamed like jade. The elder said to him, "Since you cultivate the Dao, in five years you will face great peril, and I shall come to your aid. Strive to accumulate hidden virtue and do not waver in your resolve." Later, as Huang towed a boat down the gorge, it capsized and he nearly drowned. As he reached the rapids, it seemed as though someone rescued him, and he made it to shore. Looking around, he saw it was the old man he had met before, who then vanished without a trace.

Fei Changfang shrank the earth; Nüwa mended the heavens.
*The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* relates: After Fei Changfang of the Later Han met the immortal elder, he wished to seek the Dao but was troubled by concern for his family. The elder cut a green bamboo stalk to match Changfang’s height and had him hang it behind the door. When his family saw it, they took it for his corpse and buried it. Changfang followed the elder deep into the mountains, into a tiger’s den, where he was left alone. Yet he felt no fear. Later, he was placed in an empty chamber with a rotting rope suspending a ten-thousand-catty stone above his heart. When a host of serpents came to gnaw the rope, it snapped, but Changfang did not flinch. The elder said, "You are teachable." He was then made to eat excrement, which contained long worms. Changfang found it repulsive, and the elder sighed, "You were nearly perfected—what a pity this remains unaccomplished." Changfang took his leave and returned home. Thereafter, he could chant to shrink the earth, bringing distances of thousands of *li* instantly before him, then release it to restore its expanse.

*The Master of Huainan* states: The goddess Nüwa smelted stones of five colors to mend the azure heavens, severed the legs of the giant turtle to prop up the four pillars, slew the black dragon to save Jizhou, and heaped up reed ashes to stem the flooding waters. The heavens were mended, the four pillars set aright, the floods receded, Jizhou was pacified, the monstrous creatures perished, and the people of Zhuanxu flourished.

Lan Fang’s warmth and care, born of compassion.
*The Green Locks* records: Lan Fang, styled Yuandao, was said by the elders of Bozhou to have appeared unchanged from childhood to the present day. Gentle and kind in his dealings, he won the affection of all, great and small. During the reign of Emperor Renzong, he was once lodged in Fanglin Park. When he announced his departure, the emperor bestowed upon him the title "Master of Nurturing Simplicity of the Southern Marchmount."

At that time, the scholar Jia Changchao presented the Master with a poem, which read:
*"The sage’s grace deeply soaks the hermit’s frame,
A Daoist’s robe should be crowned with hempen cloth.
Beneath Zhurong Peak, drunk beneath the bright moon,
At the source of the Xiang’s waters, angling for purple scales.
Once you saw the sea-peach bear thrice its fruit,
Yet how many springs have passed since the ritual vessels last gleamed?
When one day my work is done and I depart,
I would be the spirit-bridge’s kneeling servant, bearing your sandals."*

The Master replied in kind:
*"Of late, I begged the enlightened lord to free this body,
No harm in forest seclusion, donning a gauze kerchief.
Wild wine brims, floating jade-like foam,
Fresh-caught Han fish gifted, their scales like brocade.
After the night the crow fled the Dark Palace’s nest,
The dragon’s child in the grotto nurtures eternal spring.
If you, sir, should share this aspiration,
Then the pot-bound heavens will hold two men more."*

One day, the Master bathed and suddenly passed away. To this day, travelers on the lakes and rivers of the Xiang ask after him, and some claim to have seen him.

*The Extensive Records* states: Mao Meng, styled Chucheng, was the great-grandfather of Shuqing Jun. By nature compassionate, he delighted in performing hidden acts of virtue. When the Zhou declined, he entered Mount Hua to study under Master Guigu, attained the Dao, and ascended on a dragon. Thus the children’s rhyme sang:
*"The divine immortal scholar Mao Chucheng,
Rode a dragon to heaven, entered the Great Clarity."*
This refers to him. Prosperity and wealth flourish alike, while poverty and hardship share the same fate.

*The True Reports* states: Ma Ming and Ma Han, in serving the scriptures and treasures, had once offended their lord and father. They were thus made to keep two servant boys with hearts of their own—one named White Head, the other Flat Top—who constantly attended the incense and fire, sweeping and dusting. Often, divine radiance and numinous qi would manifest within the chambers. Ming’s wife, who possessed some ability to perceive the unseen, reported that several jade-clad maidens in azure robes flitted through the air like soaring birds. The Ma household soon grew wealthy, amassing vast resources and property. In their old age, they passed away. Ming’s son Hong, Hong’s younger brother Zhen, and Han’s son Zhi continued to uphold their legacy, though in their later years, their devotion to their master slackened and faded.

*The Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang* records: The scholar Quan Tongxiu, having failed the imperial examinations during the Yuanhe era, wandered destitute between Suzhou and Huzhou, stricken by illness and poverty. He had employed a messenger, a rustic villager, for a full year. One day, he said to the man, "You are as impoverished as I—what progress can I offer you?" He handed him a soiled garment, saying, "Take this and exchange it for a little wine and meat. You may gather the village elders to beg for a small sum to aid your journey." The servant smiled faintly and replied, "This is hardly enough, but I shall provide." He then cut a withered mulberry branch into several pieces, bundled them on a tray, and sighed over them. Instantly, they transformed into beef. Next, he drew water from several bottles and poured it out—it became fine wine. The village elders feasted until drunk and sated, and the scholar obtained bolts of silk and other goods. The servant then took his leave.

Beyond Xue Chang’s urn, within Shentu Ping’s hidden vessel.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* tells of Xue Chang, a man of Youji, who sought the Dao and visited strange places. In the seventh year of the Tianbao era, he lodged for months at the Cavern-Heaven Abbey. One day, an old mountain dweller arrived carrying a large root of *Dioscorea nipponica*, its form resembling a giant tortoise, with patterned shell, head, and limbs all perfectly intact. He said to the abbey’s Daoists, "Slice this herb finely, dry it, and brew it with rice and yeast to make wine. After half a year, those who drink it will ascend as immortals." The Daoists followed his instructions and prepared the wine. One day, when all the Daoists had gone to attend a ritual feast, only Chang remained. Three days later, the Daoists returned to find Chang collapsed beside an urn outside, his ears and nose bleeding. After several days, he revived, his body light and his eyes bright, as if about to take flight. Mountains, rivers, cliffs, and walls could no longer obstruct him. Later, he entered the Great Face Mountain and was never seen again.

*The Record of Tree and Fern* states: Shentu Youya, a man of unrestrained spirit, often wandered forests and springs, always carrying a bottle. One day, he leapt into the bottle and was thereafter known as "Bottle Recluse."

Yuan Tai’s dragon chariot, Gongdu’s phoenix-worm.

*The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* recounts: Yao Tan, styled Yuantai, was a man of Pingyang. Of refined conduct and lofty bearing, his roots ran deep within. He withdrew to the divine realm, seeking true reclusion, and vanished into the secluded mountains, reciting the *Five Thousand Character Text* daily. He encountered Master Xu, who transmitted to him the Way of Reversing Yellow through Primordial White. After practicing it, rain no longer dampened his robes, nor mud sullied his shoes. His eyes emitted divine radiance like lightning. During the reign of King Jian, he ascended to heaven in a dragon chariot.

Also recorded is the True Man Yin Gui, styled Gongdu, a native of Taiyuan. He abstained from grain and practiced qi-cultivation, dedicating himself to the supreme Dao. His transformations were boundless—now a Daoist, now a scholar, now a youth, now an elder. He once joined the immortals Wei Zhen and others to test dragons, worms, and phoenixes, riding the void, driving clouds, and racing like lightning. He moved between existence and non-existence, dispersing his form and scattering his shadow, appearing and gathering wherever he pleased. He declared, "Five." By now, he had lived thirteen hundred years, his journeys too numerous to record in such a brief account. One day, he refined his body and entered the clouds, ascending slowly into the sky. Only the sound of reed pipes lingered, and only his robes and fine silks remained behind.

Qin Shi Huang raised his terrace, the Yellow Emperor established his abbey.

*The Records of the Forgotten* states: The First Emperor of Qin built the Cloud-Bright Terrace, gathering rare woods from the four directions and summoning the most skilled artisans from across the land. From the south, he obtained azure wood from Yanqiu, burning sand from the Li River, vermilion mud from Guidu, and white bamboo from Yungang. From the east, he procured brocade cypress from Congluan, dragon pines from Yansui, star-patterned wood from the Cold River, and catalpa from Ruanyun. From the west, he acquired floating gold from the Leaking Sea, feathered earth from Langyuan, mist-woven mulberry from Dizhang, and round bamboo from the Chen Pond. From the north, he gathered dry lacquer from Mingfu, patterned catalpa from Yinban, black jade from Zhai Stream, and fragrant jade from the Converging Sea. These treasures were assembled, and the artisans worked suspended in midair, wielding axes among the trees. Construction began at midnight and was completed by noon. The people of Qin called it the Midnight-Noon Terrace.

*The Inner Transmission of the Yellow Emperor* states: The Queen Mother of the West served the Emperor the sap of azure mist and the fruit of crimson essence. She then bestowed upon him five white jade statues, saying, "These are the true visages of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy." She also gave him the *Diagram of the Original Forms of the Two Modes* and nineteen verses on returning cinnabar. The Emperor performed obeisance and placed them in the high abbey, personally making offerings. His consorts, ministers, and concubines were forbidden to approach. Above the abbey, clouds of strange hues often gathered, and rare fragrances wafted for hundreds of paces. The people of that time called it the "Dao Abbey." The term *Dao abbey* originated from this.

Huang An plowed with his tongue, He Pu calculated with his heart.

*The Biographies of Immortals* states: Huang An, considering himself lowly and unfit for human company, took up a whip and recited books, tracing calculations on the ground. One night, the earth split open, and people called it "Huang An plowing with his tongue." At eighty, his complexion remained that of a child.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* states: Xing Hepu dwelled in reclusion among the seas and rivers, having attained the Way of divine transcendence. He could direct his mind to focus on any object, perform calculations, and know its nature without fail. Living between Mount Song and the Ying River, he composed three scrolls titled *The Book of Yingyang*, containing the secret of "revolving the heart through emptiness."

Guangcheng’s profound obscurity, Lu Ao’s boundless vastness.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Guangchengzi was an ancient immortal who dwelled in a stone chamber on Mount Kongtong. The Yellow Emperor crawled forward on his knees, bowed twice, and inquired about the Way of nurturing life. Guangcheng replied, "The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate state is dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness. The body will then right itself. Be ever still, ever pure. Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence. Only then can you attain long life."

Additionally, Lu Ao encountered a scholar with deep-set eyes and a knotted throat, hunched shoulders and an elongated neck, his upper body broad and lower body slender. Carrying a tortoise shell and eating crabs, he said to Lu Ao: "I have an appointment with Vast Obscurity beyond the Nine Heavens. I cannot tarry long and must depart."

The Jade Hook of the Qi Maiden, the Life-Transmitting Wooden Drill.

*The Biographies of Female Transcendents* states: Lady Hookwing was a woman of Qi, surnamed Zhao. Fond of stillness and purity, she fell ill for six years, her right hand clenched into a fist, and she ate little. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a diviner observing the qi declared: "In the northeast, there is the qi of a noble person." Upon investigation, she was found and summoned. Her bearing and beauty were extraordinary. The emperor unclasped her hand, revealing a jade hook within. Favored by the emperor, she bore Emperor Zhao. Later, Emperor Wu sought to harm her, but when her body was laid to rest, it did not decay and emitted fragrance. When Emperor Zhao ascended the throne, he reburied her, but her coffin was empty, containing only a pair of silk slippers. Thus, her palace was named Hookwing.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Long ago, there was a Master Fu who, from youth, was devoted to the Dao. He entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao and, after seven years, was received by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate. Given a wooden drill, he was instructed to bore through a stone disc, five *chi* thick, with the promise: "When you pierce this stone, you shall attain the Dao." His heart unwavering, he drilled day and night for forty-seven years without pause. When the stone was finally pierced, he obtained the divine elixir and now serves as the Perfected of the Western Marchmount.

The Old Man of Huaiyang, the Nine Transcendents of Kaihuang.

*Primary Records* state: During the Former Han, Ying Yao secluded himself in the mountains of Huaiyang. When the Four Hoary Ones were summoned, Yao alone did not appear. The people of the time composed a verse: "The Four Hoary Ones of South Mountain cannot compare to the Old Man of Huaiyang." He was the eight-times-great-grandfather of Ying Shao of the Later Han.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Transcendents* recounts: The Nine Transcendents of Kaihuang were Kong Qiuming, Yang Yuanzhong, Zhang Fashu, Wu Tianyin, Chen Zhikong, Luo Fatong, Zou Wujun, Xie Youyan, and Zhou Xianyong, along with Deng Xiyuan. During the warfare between Han and Chu, when there was no place to find sustenance, each harbored the aspiration to cultivate the Dao. They retreated into the mountains, pledged brotherhood, and wandered together among the Five Marchmounts. Later, they dwelled on West Mountain in Hongzhou. All attained transcendence. By the Kaihuang era of the Sui, phoenixes and cranes with their ceremonial escorts gathered at Nine Transcendents Terrace on Yushun Mountain. They lingered for a day before ascending to heaven in unison.

The Master of Wen Shi was styled so in the Zhou, and titled *Wei Bian* in the celestial ranks.

*The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Yin Xi initially served as the magistrate of Hangu Pass. One day, he saw an old man riding a blue ox, drawing near in a humble carriage. Xi prostrated himself and approached, asking, "Where does the Sage intend to go?" The old man replied, "My home lies east of the pass, my fields west of it. I come now and then to gather firewood. I possess no virtue or power, yet you trouble yourself to inquire." Though the old man declined repeatedly, Xi persisted. Finally, the old man said, "Since you know the Five, I also know you harbor a heart faithful to the Dao." Thereupon, he bestowed upon Xi the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*. Xi’s cultivation perfected, his virtue complete, he was styled Master Wen Shi and appointed as the Supreme Perfected.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Zhuang Zhou studied under Master Chang Sang, who transmitted to him subtle teachings, whence he became known as Zhuangzi. He concealed himself on Mount Baodu, refining his practice and composing texts. Having ingested the Northern Nurturing Fire Elixir, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight, where he was appointed as the *Wei Bian* Gentleman of the Supreme Ultimate.

Xuan Ji transmitted the leaf, Ma Xiang grasped the coin.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* recounts: Master Xuan Yuan Ji of Mount Luofu dwelled on the mountain for several centuries, his complexion unaged, his hair trailing to the ground. In darkened chambers, his gaze stretched for yards. When he ventured into cliffs and valleys to gather herbs, poisonous dragons and fierce beasts guarded him. Over a hundred households invited him to vegetarian feasts, and he appeared at each without fail. Emperor Xuanzong summoned him to the palace and asked, "Can longevity be governed?" Ji replied, "Sever sensual indulgence, moderate rich flavors, regulate joy and sorrow as one, and bestow virtue without partiality. Naturally, you will unite with heaven and earth in virtue, match the sun and moon in brilliance. Even Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang could attain this—how much more so longevity?" The master could press paulownia or bamboo leaves into coins.

*The Traditions of Divine Transcendents* states: Ma Xiang, styled Ziran, possessed Daoist arts. Once, at the seat of Governor Ma Zhi of Jiangnan, he filled a wine cup with soil and planted melon seeds. In an instant, vines sprouted, flowers bloomed, and fruit ripened—its taste was exquisite. He could also shrink his body, pluck green coins, and cast them into a well, summoning them forth at will.

The numinous chariot and blessed land, the mountain chart and grotto-heaven.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* records: Wang Lingyu, a Daoist of Jiujiang, resided on the Five Elders Peak. One night, a divine person told him, "Those who attain the Dao each have their proper place, just as planting the five grains in sand and stone yields no harvest. Since you possess the bones of a flying transcendent, you must find a blessed land and numinous abode to achieve transformation. Without it, demons will disrupt your practice, and your aspirations will come to naught." The master asked, "Where may I dwell?" The divine person replied, "The summit of Vermilion Mound, the neighboring peak of Purple Canopy—these are a grotto-heaven and blessed land, where you may ascend to heaven." The master followed this advice and relocated to Mount Heng. After twelve years, his work complete, he ascended in broad daylight during the Tianjian era.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Mountain Chart Master was a grandee during the reign of King Ai of Zhou and also a transcendent. He transmitted the Nine Cloud Water Method to Zhang Jizi, who cultivated this Way and was appointed as the Assistant of the Nine Palaces. Now, the Mountain Chart Master dwells in the grotto-heaven, playing chess with Jizi.

Da Ling regrew his beard, Zhang Guo knocked out his teeth.

*The Inscription on the Wall of Chaohua Temple* records: During the Tang, the palace attendant Jian Da Ling wrote: "In the year I came to know my fate, I followed the imperial carriage on its western journey. In the twelfth month of the *dinghai* year of Tianbao, I received the True Origin Elixir Formula from the Old Man of the City, though its meaning eluded me. As the imperial progress halted and official duties pressed, I set it aside. In the *dingyou* year of Zhide under Emperor Suzong, while on a mission to Song Hill, I encountered the Old Man again and at last fully grasped the Way of Divine Water and Yellow Sprouts. Upon completion, I sought leave to return to the imperial court, then retired to my fields. Coincidentally, Minister Zhang Qufei of the Southern Bureau and Left Historian Cheng Taixu, both acquainted with my former abode, jointly prepared a sacred chamber. With the aid of spring blessings from august heaven, the elixir crucible radiated light. After ingesting the medicine for a full cycle, my flesh and complexion became radiant, my hair lustrous. I soared through the void without fear, my mind ever more attuned to the divine. From the time I first ingested the numinous elixir in the *dingyou* year of Zhide until the *jiayou* year of Qianfu under the present emperor, one hundred and eighteen years have passed. Having served twelve reigns, I have regained my youth and regrown my beard."

*The Miscellaneous Records of Emperor Ming* states: When Emperor Ming summoned Zhang Guo, he once offered him wine poured by Dong Yin. Guo drained three goblets in succession, his face flushed with intoxication. Turning to his attendants, he remarked, "This wine is not of fine quality." He then reclined outward, and after the time it takes to eat a meal, he awoke. Suddenly, he gazed into a mirror and saw his teeth mottled and blackened with decay. Seizing an iron ruyi, he struck his teeth, and they all fell out.

He applied medicine to his teeth and again slept. After a long while, he drew the mirror to look—his teeth had regrown, firm, lustrous, and more radiant than before.

The Cock Master Cures Illness; Ao Ling Channels the Waters.
*The Idle Talks of the Military Camp* records: In Tang-era Shu, there lived a man called Fei Jishi, "Cock Master," whose eyes were red without pupils. He could foresee events and perform exorcisms for others. When someone afflicted by illness came to seek his aid, Jishi would carry a rooster to the courtyard and set up an offering. He would then take a stone the size of a chicken’s egg, place it in the patient’s hand, and stride in zigzag steps, exhaling and shouting sharply. The rooster would spin and die, the stone shatter into four pieces—and the patient’s convulsions would cease. Hence his name, Cock Master.

*The Supplementary Biographies of Transcendents* states: Ao Ling was a man of Chu who, after death, was cast into the river. His body drifted upstream to the foot of Mount Wen, where he suddenly revived and concealed himself among the mountains of Shu. His mastery of transformation and command over ghosts and spirits became widely known. At the time, landslides in the gorges had dammed the river, causing the waters to stagnate. Emperor Du Yu, distressed by this, heard of Ao Ling’s abilities and sent him to Jintang Mountain at Qutang Gorge. There, Ao Ling channeled the waters, restoring their original course so that people could once more dwell on dry land. Du Yu abdicated several hundred years later, wandering to Mount Tianzhu, where he encountered a gathering of celestial perfected. He then ascended to heaven and departed.

Xuan Ji Bestows Leaves; Ma Xiang Plucks Coins.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* recounts: Master Xuan Yuan Ji of Mount Luofu was said to have lived for several centuries, his complexion unaged, his hair trailing to the ground. In dark chambers, his gaze could stretch for yards. When he ventured into the valleys to gather herbs, poisonous dragons and fierce beasts guarded him. He would visit over a hundred households to accept vegetarian offerings, yet his presence remained undivided. Emperor Xuanzong summoned him to the palace and asked, "Can one govern longevity?" The master replied, "Sever desire for sensual pleasures, moderate rich flavors, equalize sorrow and joy, and practice impartial virtue. Then you will naturally align with the power of heaven and earth, match the brightness of sun and moon. Even the sages Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang could attain this—how much more so longevity?" The master could press paulownia or bamboo leaves into coins.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Ma Xiang, styled Ziran, possessed Daoist arts. Once, at the residence of the Jiangnan governor Ma Zhi, he filled a wine cup with soil and planted melon seeds. In an instant, vines sprouted, flowers bloomed, and fruit ripened—its taste was exquisite. He could also shrink his body, pluck green coins, and toss them into a well, summoning them back at will.

The Divine Chariot’s Blessed Land; The Mountain Chart’s Grotto-Heaven.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Wang Lingyu, a Daoist of Jiujiang, dwelled on Five Elders Peak. One night, a divine being told him, "Those who attain the Dao each have their proper place, just as planting the five grains in sand and stone will yield no harvest. Since you possess the bones of a flying transcendent, you must find a blessed land and numinous cavern. There, you may transform; elsewhere, demons will corrupt your practice, and no hope of success remains." The master asked, "Where may I dwell?" The being replied, "The upper peak of Zhu Ling, the neighboring summit of Zi Gai—these are a grotto-heaven and blessed land, where you may ascend to heaven." The master followed this advice and moved to Mount Heng. After twelve years of cultivation, during the Tianjian era, he ascended in broad daylight.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Shan Tuzi was a minister during the reign of King Ai of Zhou and also a transcendent. He transmitted the method of the Ninefold Cloud Water to Zhang Jizi, who practiced this Way to ascend as an assistant to the Nine Palaces. Now, Shan Tuzi resides in the grotto-heaven, playing chess with Jizi.

Da Ling Regrows His Beard; Zhang Guo Strikes His Teeth.
*The Inscription on the Wall of Chaohua Temple* records: The Tang eunuch and palace attendant Jian Daling wrote: "In the year of my fate’s decree, I followed the imperial carriage on its western journey. In the twelfth month of the *dinghai* year of Tianbao, I received the true elixir formula from the Old Man of the City, though its meaning eluded me. As the imperial retinue halted, my duties grew burdensome. In the *dingyou* year of Zhide under Emperor Suzong, while on a mission to Song Hill, I encountered the Old Man again and at last fully grasped the Way of Divine Water and Yellow Sprouts. Upon completion, I sought leave to return to the imperial court, then retired to my fields. The Southern Bureau official Zhang Qufei and the Left Historian Cheng Taixu, both familiar with my former abode, jointly prepared a sacred chamber. With the aid of spring blessings from august heaven, the elixir crucible glowed, and after ingesting the medicine for a full cycle of days, my flesh and complexion became radiant, my hair lustrous. I soared through the void without fear, my mind ever more attuned to the divine. From the time I first ingested the numinous elixir in the *dingyou* year of Zhide until the *jiayou* year of Qianfu under the present emperor, one hundred and eighteen years have passed.

*The Miscellaneous Records of Emperor Ming* states: When Emperor Ming summoned Zhang Guo, he once offered him wine poured by Dong Yin. Guo drained three goblets in succession, his face flushed with intoxication. Turning to his attendants, he remarked, "This wine is not of fine quality." He then reclined outward, and after the time it takes to eat a meal, he awoke. Suddenly, he gazed into a mirror and saw his teeth mottled and blackened with decay. Seizing an iron *ruyi*, he struck his teeth, and they all fell out.

Applying medicinal paste to his teeth, he then slept. After a long while, he again took up the mirror and saw that his teeth had regrown—firm, lustrous, and more radiant than before.

The Rooster Master healed the sick; Ao Ling channeled the waters.
*The Idle Talks of the Military Camp* records: In Tang-era Shu, there lived a man called Fei the Rooster Master, whose eyes were entirely red, devoid of pupils. Skilled in divining the future, he could perform exorcisms for others. When someone afflicted by illness came to seek his aid, the Rooster Master would carry a rooster to the courtyard and set up an altar. Taking a stone the size of a chicken’s egg, he would have the patient grasp it, then pace in zigzag steps, exhaling sharply and shouting incantations. The rooster would spin in circles until it died, and the stone would shatter into four pieces—whereupon the patient’s convulsions ceased. Thus he earned the name Rooster Master.

*The Supplementary Biographies of Immortals* states: Ao Ling was a man of Chu who, upon his death, was cast into the river. His body drifted upstream to the foot of Mount Wen, where he suddenly revived and concealed himself among the mountains of Shu. His mastery of transformation and command over spirits and gods became renowned. At the time, landslides had dammed the gorges, blocking the flow of the river, causing great distress to Du Yu. Hearing of Ao Ling’s abilities, Du Yu dispatched him to Jintang Mountain at Qutang Gorge to channel the waters and restore their original course, allowing people to dwell once more on dry land. Du Yu abdicated his throne and, centuries later, wandered to Mount Tianzhu, where he encountered a gathering of celestial beings. He then ascended to heaven and departed.

Ge You carved wood; Zhang Ci cut paper.
*The Biographies of the Immortals* recounts: Ge You was a man of Shu who, during the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, often carved wooden sheep to sell. One day, he rode a sheep into Shu, and the kings, marquises, and nobles welcomed him to Sui Mountain. Those who followed him each received a peach, and none returned. The villagers remarked, “To receive a peach from Sui Mountain is not to become an immortal, yet it is enough to be esteemed.”

*The Extensive Records* states: Zhang Ci was a learned man who cultivated qi and abstained from food. Fond of wine and obsessed with chess, he once composed a poem:
*What can be done about the golden crow,*
*That flies ceaselessly overhead?*
*The red furnace guards the elixir’s flame,*
*Yet how can jade-like beauty be preserved?*
*This year, flowers bloom upon the branch;*
*Next year, they cover the entire tree.*
*Better to drink wine without cease,*
*From dawn to dusk, and dawn again.*

At times, he would cut thousands of paper butterflies, blow upon them with his breath, and send them flying in formation. At his clap, they would descend. On another day, he cut a paper crane, sighed upon it with water, and suddenly it took flight. He wrote: “You go first; I will follow later.”

Ma Jian subdued evil; Liu Gen summoned ghosts.
*The New Records of the Alchemical Terrace* states: Ma Jian was well-versed in the *Book of Songs* and the *Book of Rites*. At seventeen, he encountered a master who taught him the arts of *dunjia*, the Raven’s Horn, and the Raven’s Essence, along with the secrets of celestial portents. Skilled in summoning and commanding spirits, he could subdue evil and vanquish demons. One day, a celestial deity descended and addressed him: “Master, you possess accumulated merit and are destined for transcendence. Why do you summon and command spirits? Conceal your arts, sever all ties, cultivate serenity, and embrace the One—true immortality will come of its own accord.” Ma Jian heeded this advice and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Liu Gen could heal the sick and command spirits. When Du Xin, the governor of Yingchuan, heard of him, he suspected him of sorcery and summoned him to the prefectural office. “What powers do you possess,” Du Xin asked, “that you so delude the people?” Liu Gen replied, “I can make ghosts appear.” Du Xin said, “Prove it now. If no ghost appears, you will be executed.” Liu Gen replied, “Ghosts are easily summoned. Lend me your brush.” Du Xin complied. Liu Gen inscribed a talisman and let out a long whistle. In an instant, the southern wall of the hall split open several feet, and four or five hundred men in red garments, wielding swords, emerged from the breach. They bound the governor’s parents and brought them forward, weeping: “Why have you offended the divine immortal, causing us to be bound and humiliated thus?” The governor kowtowed and begged for mercy. Liu Gen admonished the spirits and dismissed them, and the ordeal ended. A month later, the governor and his wife, Lady Guo, both died.

Chen Chang built houses; Yan Qing pulled boats.
*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: Chen Chang had dwelled on Ramie Mountain for over six hundred years. The mountain folk built him a house and made seasonal offerings. Though he neither ate nor drank, his complexion remained that of a man in his fifties or sixties. Ramie Mountain spanned a thousand *li*, with over a thousand households atop it. Their customs were the same as those of Wu.

Yan Qing was a man of Kuaiji who, though poor, made a living selling charcoal. One day, while on the road, he encountered an extraordinary person who gave him a scroll of plain silk. Yan Qing said, “I cannot read.” The divine being replied, “You need not read it; simply keep it in a quiet place.” Thereafter, Yan Qing gained spiritual powers. When someone pulled his boat, he would disappear, and only the charcoal-laden vessel would move on its own. Later, when he treated the sick, he would bring the scroll to their homes, and they would recover. He entered Mount Xiao Huo and attained immortality.

Xiyi embodied Yao and Shun; Hongya emulated Chao and You.
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Chen Tuan, styled Tunan and known as Master Xiyi, once encountered a golden-armored divine being who guided him to seclude himself on Mount Hua. Emperor Taizong summoned him and asked, “I wish to govern the realm with the Way of Yao and Shun. Is this possible?” Chen Tuan replied, “I have heard that Yao and Shun had earthen steps three feet high and thatched roofs untrimmed. If Your Majesty can do likewise, then you shall truly be a Yao or Shun of the present age.”

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* states: The Daoist Zhang Yun, known as Master Hongya, secluded himself on Mount Yuzhang. During the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Ming summoned him and asked, “How do I compare to Yao and Shun? How do you compare to Xu You?” Zhang Yun replied, “Your Majesty’s Way surpasses that of Yao and Shun, while my virtue falls short of Xu You’s. In ancient times, Yao summoned Xu You, yet Xu You did not come. Today, Your Majesty summoned me, and I have come.” The emperor praised him and offered the title of Master and the rank of Minister of Ceremonies, which he repeatedly declined, eventually rising to Minister of Works. He then said, “Why does Your Majesty begrudge a single mountain and stream, preventing me from following in the footsteps of Chao and You?” The emperor granted his request, and he dwelled on the great cliffs of the Western Mountains, the very place of his former seclusion.

*The Records of Yuzhang* notes: During the Kaihuang era of the Sui, the region was renamed Hongzhou in honor of the mountain where the master resided.

Programming two tigers, painting two oxen.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Cheng Taixu, a native of Xichong in Guozhou, was drawn to the Dao from childhood. At fifteen, he ascended the eastern mountain near his home, where a lofty aspiration to transcend the mundane arose within him. Soon after, clouds of five colors enveloped his body. In adulthood, he ceased grain and sat in forgetfulness. Two tigers would accompany him wherever he went. He named them Good Speech and Good Conduct, then stroked their backs and administered the Three Refuges. The tigers knelt and listened attentively. Thereafter, they would come whenever he called their names.

*The Biographies of Recluses* states: Master Tao the Recluse dwelled on Mount Jijin, compiling the *True Instructions*. Though Emperor Wu of Liang repeatedly summoned him, he never responded. Instead, the master painted two oxen and presented them to the emperor—one roaming freely amidst water and grass, the other fitted with a golden bridle and held by a man. The emperor remarked, “The master’s intent is like the tortoise dragging its tail in the mud. He cannot be compelled.” Thus, he ceased his summons.

Xu sought the crescent moon, Du bowed to the autumn courtyard.

*The Biographies of Immortals* recounts: Xu Cuo wandered through famous mountains, leaving inscriptions wherever he went: “Here passes the Seeker of the Crescent Moon.” One day, he composed a poem:
*“Before the flowers of the celestial garden lies the land of drunkenness,
Mistakenly I drained the Queen Mother’s ninefold rosy goblet.
Venerable Wei clapped his hands, deeming me frivolous,
And banished me to the mortal world as a wine-mad fool.”*
Thereupon, he ascended upon clouds from a tavern.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Du Guangting, styled Binsheng, was also known as Master Guangcheng. At the end of the Tang, a reclusive Daoist whose name was obscure sought lodging with him. Though the master assented, he never granted the man an audience. The Daoist sold medicines in the market by day, spending his earnings on wine, and would sing only *“Lamenting the Autumn Courtyard.”* The people called him the *“Autumn Courtyard Lamenter.”* For nearly half a year, none suspected his strangeness. One evening, deeply intoxicated, his singing grew louder. Those who peered in saw lamps and embroidered banners, tables laden with vessels, and azure youths standing by to pour wine as he sang. The onlookers reported this to the master, who then knocked at his door, saying, *“Guangting’s capacity and knowledge are shallow. I never imagined a transcendent would deign to visit. I am deeply at fault. I humbly beg to bow before your radiant presence, that my worldly obstructions may be dispelled.”* The Daoist replied, *“Why such earnestness? I shall come out to meet you.”* In an instant, he stowed the banquet and attendants into his cap, opened the door—and the room was empty.

Dongfang Peeped at the Window, Zhang Ping Dug a Well.

*The Tales of Emperor Wu of Han* states: On the seventh day of the seventh month, the emperor was in the Cheng Hua Hall when two azure birds alighted before it. The emperor asked Dongfang Shuo, who replied, *“The Queen Mother of the West is about to arrive.”* Soon after, she appeared. Someone was peering through the southern window. The emperor, startled, asked who it was. The Queen Mother said, *“That is your attendant, Dongfang Shuo. He is a witty fellow—just a mischievous boy from my neighborhood.”*

*The Extensive Records* recounts: During the Yuanhe era, Prefect Zhang Shiping of the Tang and his wife both went blind in middle age. They shut their doors, performing rituals and prayers without cease, their devotion growing ever more fervent. One day, a scholar appeared and said, *“This affliction requires no medicine. Simply dig a well in a blessed site and wash your eyes with its water.”* The prefect followed his advice. The moment he washed his eyes, his vision cleared. The couple bowed in gratitude and offered rich gifts, but the scholar refused, saying, *“I am an official of the Star of Venus. Because you have endured illness without forsaking the Dao, your devotion unwavering, the Celestial Emperor sent me to impart the Dao’s mysteries in repayment for your diligence. Gold and silk are not what I seek.”*

Bai Reached the Immortals’ Abode, Li Trod the True Realm.

*The Extensive Records* states: Bai Youqiu failed the imperial examinations during the Zhenyuan era. He sailed into the sea, where wind and rain drove his boat to the foot of a mountain. That night, he heard the wind rustling the leaves like the sound of someone reciting poetry:
*“A jade canopy spans the azure void—
This is the dwelling of immortals.”*
Suddenly, over a thousand riders appeared, mounted on dragons, cranes, turtles, and fish. They pointed to the water, which seemed to flow beneath the moon. Someone called out, *“Water Bureau Messenger Bai Youqiu!”* and handed him a document from the Water Bureau. Youqiu followed them and soon reached an island. Gazing into the distance, he saw signs of human habitation. When he returned home, none of his family remained—generations had passed.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* records: Li Lin, a native of Yan, was traveling with a friend on Mount Wutai during the Baoli era when he fell into a wind cave. A lion-like figure led him into a cavern and gave him water to drink, saying, *“Though you nearly perished, you have entered my grotto and trodden my true realm—this is your destined affinity with the Dao. If you harbor the desire for long life, return home for now. You may come again to drink this divine nectar, which will extend your years.”*

King Zhao Treasured the Pearl, the Dark Emperor Buried the Cauldron.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* states: In the time of the Yellow Emperor, Wuchengzi wandered the ridges of Mount Hanshan when he saw a black clam on a high cliff, proving that black clams could fly. By the era of King Zhao of Yan, the kingdom presented one to the king. He washed its sand and mud with water from a jade vessel, then sighed, *“Since the dawn of sun and moon, I have seen black clams produce pearls eighty or ninety times—but this clam yields a pearl only once in a thousand years.”* The king carried this pearl in his bosom during the summer, and his body felt light and cool. It was called the *“Heat-Dispelling, Coolness-Summoning Pearl.”*

*The True Instructions* records: On Great Mount Mao stands a bronze cauldron from the time of the Dark Emperor, large enough to hold four or five *hu*. It rests on the mountain’s highest point, buried eight *chi* deep, with a slab of stone covering it. The Dark Emperor ordered the Spirit of the Eastern Sea to conceal it there.

Wu Ding Was Summoned, Master Shao Requested Audience.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* states: Cheng Wuding, a native of Guiyang, became a county magistrate at thirteen and was sent to deliver goods to the provincial capital. The governor, Zhou Ting, recognized his exceptional qualities and retained him as a literary aide.

Upon his return from the capital, he passed through Changsha Prefecture. As he missed the postal relay’s closing hour, he lodged beneath a tree in the wild. Suddenly, he heard voices saying, “We’re heading to Changsha’s market for medicine.” At dawn, he saw two cranes. Finding this strange, he followed them to the market gate and waited. Sure enough, two elderly men appeared. He trailed them for several *li* before one asked, “What do you seek by following us?” He replied, “I heard of your life-saving arts and came to serve as your attendant.” The elders exchanged glances and smiled, then drew a jade case from their sleeves. Upon examining a plain silk scroll, they found Cheng Wuding’s name inscribed. Each gave him a single pill, and by this he attained the Dao.

One day, he told his younger brother, “On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Herdboy visits the Weaver Girl. I have been summoned back to my post and cannot stay long.” With these words, he passed away. After his burial, the prefect ordered the coffin opened, but his body was gone—only a green bamboo staff and a black crow remained.

*The Traditions of Divine Transcendents* records: Li Shaojun once compounded an elixir, but before its completion, he told Emperor Wu, “Your Majesty cannot forsake extravagance, distance yourself from sensual pleasures, cease warfare, or temper your wrath. Lost souls wander beyond the ten thousand *li*, and ghosts of the slain haunt the marketplace. The great elixir and the supreme Dao cannot be achieved under such conditions.” Suddenly, Shaojun fell ill. That night, the emperor dreamed they ascended Mount Song together when a messenger riding a dragon descended from the clouds, bearing a tally, and announced, “The Great One summons Shaojun.” The emperor awoke and told his attendants, “Shaojun will soon leave me.” The next day, Shaojun’s condition worsened. The emperor visited him personally, only to find he had already transformed. The emperor said, “He has merely departed in this manner.” When they prepared to encoffin him, his body had vanished.

The Proud Clerk of Qiyuan, the Fisherman of Misty Waves.
Jin poet Guo Pu’s *Wandering Immortal Poems* states: “Qiyuan has its proud clerk, Lai has its reclusive wife.” The annotation explains: Zhuangzi once served as clerk of Qiyuan. King Wei of Chu sent generous gifts to summon him, offering the position of minister. Zhuang Zhou laughed and said to the envoy, “Begone! Do not defile me, the proud clerk of Qiyuan.”

*The Fisherman’s Songs Record* recounts: Emperor Xianzong sought the *Fisherman’s Songs* of Master Xuan Zhen. Li Deyu, then prefect of Runzhou, obtained them. Master Xuan Zhen was Zhang Zhihé, who styled himself the Fisherman of Misty Waves. His song reads:
*By West Ford Mountain, white gulls take flight,*
*Peach blossoms drift on waters where mandarin fish grow plump.*
*In blue hat and green raincoat,*
*Through slanting wind and fine rain, no need to return.*

Second song:
*The fisherman’s father, clad in coarse brown,*
*Pairs or trios in skiffs light as water striders.*
*Skilled at sculling, accustomed to riding the current,*
*On the Yangtze’s white waves, never a care.*

Third song:
*In the bend of the Milky Way, fishing from a granary boat,*
*Skiffs as homes, drifting west and east.*
*Snow on the river, wind on the shore,*
*Laughing in lotus robes, never sighing at poverty.*

Fourth song:
*At the crab shack by Song River, the host is full of cheer,*
*Wild rice for rice, water-plant soup—all shared alike.*
*Maple leaves fall, reeds wither dry,*
*Drunk, he slaps the fishing boat, unaware of the cold.*

Fifth song:
*On Green Grass Lake, the moon is full and round,*
*At Baling, the fisherman’s oar sings of lotuses.*
*With a fishing reel and a flat-headed boat,*
*Joy lies in wind and waves—no need for transcendence.*

Su Dan’s Crane Cabinet, Sun Zhen’s Oxcart.
*The Bangjiang Collection* records: Lord Su Dan of Su County one day swept and tidied his courtyard, donned his robes and cap, as if awaiting someone. Suddenly, from the northwest, clouds and cranes gathered and descended from the sky. He entered, knelt, and told his mother, “The Supreme One summons me to fill a post as a perfected official. The ceremonial escort has arrived; I cannot remain to care for you.” Having spoken, he bowed in farewell. Mother and son sang playfully for a long time. His mother said, “After you leave, how shall I sustain myself?” He left behind a cabinet, its lock and hinges exceptionally sturdy, saying, “When you lack anything, knock on the cabinet and call for it—what you need will arrive at once. But never open it.” Thereafter, whenever his mother lacked something, she knocked on the cabinet, and the object would appear immediately. One day, his mother grew curious and opened the cabinet. A pair of cranes flew out, and though she knocked afterward, there was no response.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: Sun Zhen studied the Dao under Master Bo He and attained it. One day, he announced his departure. The master gave him a sealed talisman box, saying, “Ahead, an oxcart will come to welcome you—board it. All provisions and traveling kitchens will be provided; eat without doubt. But under no circumstances open the box.” Sun Zhen knelt and received it. As he set out, an oxcart indeed arrived. The driver asked, “Are you Daoist Sun? Master Bo has sent me to welcome you.” Sun Zhen boarded, and the cart flew like the wind. Whenever they crossed water, they did not use bridges. Wine and food were fully supplied. One day, his disciple secretly opened the box and saw only a painted oxcart. Immediately, Sun Zhen vanished without a trace. Later, he was seen several times riding out and about with Bo He.

Mi Ming’s Cauldron Rhapsody, Tao Bai’s Gourd.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Daoist Xuan Yuan Mi Ming traveled between Heng and Xiang, befriending Liu Shifu. Mi Ming, passing through Mount Tai Bai, learned Shifu was in the capital and arrived at his residence that night. The collator Hou Xi was renowned for his poetry and was discussing verses with Shifu by the brazier. Mi Ming sat among them, his appearance exceedingly plain. Hou Xi looked at him with disdain. Mi Ming pointed to the stone cauldron in the brazier and said, “Can the two of you rhapsodize on this?” Though Shifu had known him for some time, he did not realize Mi Ming was a man of letters. Master Liu recited:
*A skillful craftsman carves new mountain bones,*
*Shaping within the affairs of boiling and brewing.*

Next, Hou Xi said:
*The straight handle does not grasp authority,*
*Blocked and constrained, it can only swallow its voice.*

Mi Ming laughed soundlessly and said, “Is this the extent of your poetry?” Then he chanted in a loud voice, composing over ten verses in succession. Mi Ming responded as if echoing, while the two men exhausted their thoughts but could not continue. They rose and bowed, saying, “Venerable master, none in this world can surpass you.” Their peers were humbled.

*The Extensive Records* states: Lord Tao Tai Bai often made gathering herbs his vocation. One day, he carried a gourd and invited a friend to wander Mount Song. Sitting beneath the trees, they heard laughter and conversation from the pine branches above. Looking up, they saw two figures. Lord Tao said, “You must be divine immortals—might you descend and drink with us?” Soon, a man and a woman in ancient attire descended, saying, “I was a laborer of Qin, and Mao Nü was a palace woman of Qin. Together, we escaped the disaster of Mount Li and have hidden here.” Tao said, “Now that we have met true immortals, may we hear of the great elixir and golden medicine?” They replied, “We are but ordinary people. By cutting ourselves off from the world and eating pine nuts, we came to soar through the void, unaware of the difference between life and death, the mundane and the transcendent.” Then they broke a pine branch, tapped the gourd, and sang:
*Feeding on cypress, the body grows light, leaping among cicadas,*
*Right and wrong hold no meaning when one reaches the human realm.*
*Caps and robes briefly adorn the floating world,*
*For a moment, cloud-wandering through the azure heavens.*

Zi Liang’s Green Bamboo Slips, Yong Shu’s Cinnabar Script.

*The True Records* states: Zhou Ziliang, disciple of Tao the Recluse, was refined and solemn from youth, lofty in bearing. During the Tianjian era, true immortals descended repeatedly to his chamber, saying, “Zhou has cultivated merit and accumulated virtue—he has not betrayed his aspirations.” Ziliang replied, “I am unworthy of the High Perfected’s descent; joy and awe mingle in my heart, leaving me at a loss.” The Lord of Life and Destiny said, “Recently, I journeyed to the Eastern Flower Capital and saw your name already inscribed on the Azure Slips, recorded in the registers of the Dawn Bureau.”

*The Green Jade Pendant* records: Ouyang Yongshu and Mei Shengyu roamed Mount Song. Drunk, they gazed toward the western peak, where four great cinnabar characters on the cliff read *Grotto of Divine Clarity*. Yongshu pointed them out to Shengyu, who saw nothing. Yongshu fell silent. Later, when he petitioned to withdraw from the world, he composed a poem:
*Four cinnabar characters on a cliff ten thousand fathoms high,*
*The Grotto of Divine Clarity, its towers wrought in jade.*
*Gazing through mist and clouds, none reach that distant place—*
*Phoenix and crane must now await my coming.*

A few days later, he passed away.

Transformation by washing the intestines, renewal by rinsing the marrow.

*The Later Han Records* state: Hua Tuo, styled Yuanhua, was an immortal. Magistrate Chen Gui of Pei recommended him for filial piety and incorruptibility, and Grand Commandant Huang Gai summoned him to office, but he declined all appointments. Proficient in prescriptions and remedies, his formulas never exceeded a few ingredients. When illness arose deep within the body, beyond the reach of acupuncture or medicine, he would first administer a dose of *mafei* powder dissolved in wine. Once the patient was insensate with drunkenness, he would incise the abdomen or back to excise accumulations. If the affliction lay in the intestines or stomach, he would sever, rinse, and cleanse them, removing the diseased filth before suturing the wound and applying a divine ointment. Recovery came in four or five days, with full restoration within a month.

*The Tales of Emperor Wu of Han* recount: Dongfang Shuo lost both parents three days after his birth. Someone found him but knew not his surname, so—observing that dawn first brightened in the east—named him thus. As he grew, he often spoke to himself in empty air. Later, while wandering the Vast Obscurity Marsh, an old woman gathering mulberry leaves claimed to be his mother. A yellow-browed elder arrived and pointed at Shuo, saying, “This is my elder brother. I abstain from grain and ingest *qi*, returning every three thousand years to wash my marrow and every two thousand years to flay my skin and shed my hair. In my life, I have already washed my marrow thrice and flayed my skin five times.” Hao Gu picks vegetables; Xu Pu buys rice.

*The Biographies of Female Immortals* state: The shrine of Hao Gu stands northwest of Mo County in Mo Prefecture. Popular tradition holds that Hao Gu, styled Nüjun, was gathering vegetables by the Minyan River with a neighbor during the Qinglong era of the Wei dynasty when two azure lads appeared before them, saying, “The Duke of the Eastern Sea seeks Nüjun as his bride.” With these words, they spread a brocade mat upon the water, where it moved as if on solid ground. The lads attended her as the current carried them downstream.

The neighbor girl ran to inform her family, who rushed to the scene but could find nothing. From afar, Nüjun called out: “By the grace of the Water Immortals, I pray you do not grieve or fear.” Later, a shrine was erected by the water’s edge, and before it suddenly appeared two stones—one vertical, one horizontal—each about three feet wide and over two feet high. An old inscription read: *This is the Lady’s husband’s mounting stone.* They remain there to this day.

*The Imperial Anthology of Categories* states: On West Mountain in Hongzhou lived a couple, Master and Madam Xu, who wandered in and out of the mountains. Tradition holds they were the servants of Xu Jingyang. Once, while purchasing rice with his wife at West Ridge, they returned to find their master’s entire household had ascended to immortality. Master Xu left a poem:

*Since the Prefect departed for the immortals,*
*I’ve wandered the mortal world to this very day.*
*Not to deceive the world by blending with俗,*
*But to sell firewood and buy wine, to settle the heart.*

Xu Jingyang had conferred upon them the arts of earthbound immortality, changing their surname to *Gan Da*. To this day, many claim to have seen them.

*Playful ministers drum their lips; mad scholars cover their ears.*

*Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang* records: Xing Hepu once hosted a guest who, laughing uproariously with his beard bristling and lips stretching to his ears, engaged Xing in spirited conversation before departing. When asked about it, he replied: “The Celestial Emperor was toying with his minister.”

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: Outside the southern gate of Hezhou, a ragged madman was seen selling bottle gourd seeds, claiming: “In a year or two, these will prove most useful.” Yet no one understood their purpose. At times, he would clap his hands over his ears and dash away, muttering: “Why is the sound of wind and water so deafening?”

The children followed him, and the people of the time called him "Master Cover-Ears." The following autumn, the Yangtze River swelled and flooded, submerging hundreds of households. Many witnessed the madman sitting atop a large gourd on the water, hands pressed over his ears, crying out, *"Why is the sound of wind and water so deafening?"* before drifting away on the river.

*Crown hung at Beihai, shoes left at Nanyang.*

*The Unofficial History of the Later Han* records: Feng Qian, styled Zikang, was a native of Duchang in Beihai. Impoverished, he served as a pavilion chief in the county. When the magistrate passed by his post, Feng greeted him with bows. Soon after, he cast aside his official tablet and sighed, *"How can a true man be another’s servant?"* He immediately removed his cap and hung it on the gate of the Eastern Capital, then returned home to take his family across the sea. They settled as guests in Liaodong before journeying to Mount Lao in Langye, where he cultivated his will and refined the Dao. The people were all transformed by his virtue.

*The Collected Biographies of Immortals* states: Princess Nanyang of the Han married Wang Xian. When Wang Mang usurped power, the princess, long admiring purity and revering the supreme Dao, often reflected on the governance of Emperors Wen and Jing. Knowing that immortals had descended multiple times during Emperor Wu’s reign, she told Wang Xian: *"With the fate of the nation thus, it is not for a woman to prop it up. One should preserve tranquility, withdraw to cultivate the Dao, and distance oneself from strife to prolong life. If one blindly follows the times, I fear one cannot escape the breath of decay."* She then entered Mount Hua, built a hut, and devoted herself to meditation. True spirits descended frequently, and upon achieving the Dao, she ascended on clouds. Only a pair of red shoes remained on the peak, which turned to stone when retrieved. Thus, the place was named Princess Peak.

*Minister Wang’s white hare, Master Lü’s green snake.*

*The Records of Origins and Transformations* recounts: Minister Wang guarded the alchemical crucible for the Celestial Master. When he secretly broke the seal and peeked inside, a white hare leapt out. The crowd exclaimed, *"The elixir is gone!"* A Daoist transformed into a crane and flew away, but in an instant, he seized the hare and returned it to the crucible.

*The Green Pivot* records: Langzhong Jia Shixiong treasured an ancient iron mirror and long wished to polish it. A recluse named Hui claimed skill in mirror-polishing. Taking medicine from his bamboo tube, he piled it on the mirror and said, *"The medicine will be ready shortly—I will return for it."* After he left and did not return for a long time, Jia sent someone to inquire about his lodging. He was found in a temple, where he had inscribed a poem on the gate:
*"In hand, a green snake soars beneath the white sun;
In the cave, immortal fruits bloom with eternal spring.
Know this: the mist-and-clouds wanderer beyond the world
Is no mere mortal who polishes mirrors in the dust."*

When Jia examined the mirror, the medicine had vanished, leaving only a single luminous speck. The recluse also gifted a poem to Zhang Ji:
*"At dawn I roam Nanyue, by dusk I reach Cangwu;
In my sleeve, a green snake—my gall bold and fierce.
Thrice I entered Yueyang, yet none recognized me;
Chanting high, I soared past Dongting Lake."*

*Qian the True’s flying silk, Lady Bao’s washing gauze.*

*The Records of Mount Mao* tell of two sisters of the Qian family, female immortals who dwelled in seclusion on Mount Mao, reciting the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* for thirty years. One day, they bid farewell to their master, who asked, *"Where are you going?"* They replied, *"To the golden gates of the celestial palace."* The master composed a poem to send them off:
*"A Daoist sees off immortal guests,
Escorting them to the eastern peak of Great Mao.
A hundred thousand li to Mount Taihua—
Gazing afar at the dim and distant swan."*

The True Ones answered with a poem:
*"Stay well, Master, stay well;
Do not trouble yourself with this distant farewell.
The immortal roster bears our names—
Our names are recorded in Penglai’s grotto."*

At that moment, they ascended into the cave on flying silk. When the younger sister arrived, the cave had already sealed itself. This is the present-day Swallow Cave, where purple calamus and jade peach trees grow. Thus, Tian Lin wrote:
*"Swallow Cave and Dragon Spring, their aura pure and bright;
Here, the True Qian left her lingering spirit.
Though the elder sister departed, the master remained;
When the younger returned, the cave had sealed tight.
Clouds still unfurl like white silk,
The spring’s voice forever recites the* Yellow Court.
*Jade peaches bloom, calamus turns purple—
Left for the mortal world as a painted screen."*

*The Supplementary Records of Immortals’ Biographies* states: The Lady of Bao was a native of Hanzhong, dwelling between the Lu and Mian rivers. From childhood, she yearned for emptiness and stillness. Once, while washing silk by the water’s edge, clouds and rain darkened the sky, and she conceived as if moved by some unseen force. Her parents reproached her, and in her distress, she fell ill. On her deathbed, she told her mother: “After I die, place me in an ox-cart and send me to the western mountains—this is my wish.” With these words, she passed away.

Her parents laid her in the cart, but before the oxen could be harnessed, the cart moved of its own accord. It crossed the Han and Jin rivers, which surged and flowed sideways to let it pass, ascending directly to the plains and ridges of the mountains. When her family pursued her, they saw only five clouds like a canopy, celestial music resounding through the sky, and banners and standards leading the lady as she ascended to heaven. Looking into the cart, they found only an empty coffin.

Zhang Bai drank wine, while Qiao Qing brewed tea.

*The Comprehensive Record of Marvels* states: Zhang Bai, styled Xubai, called himself the Master of White Clouds. Fond of solitude and tranquility, he was learned and well-versed in literature. Though he sat for the imperial examinations twice, he never passed. He often drowned his sorrows in wine, but after his parents’ deaths, he wept and said: “Office is for nourishing one’s parents—now that they are gone, why seek rank?” He then abandoned grain, cultivating qi and preserving his spirit, and cast off his scholar’s robes to become a Daoist.

In Yanzhong, he often rode a scolding horse, his words piercing the hidden faults of others. In bitter wind and snow, he would break the ice, sit deep in the water, and emerge with steam rising from his body, his clothes dry in an instant. He frequented the Cui family’s tavern, where he once inscribed on the wall:
*“At the Cui family’s tavern by Wuling Stream,
Such wine exists not on earth but only in heaven.
A southern Daoist drinks a dou—
Beyond drunkenness, white clouds fill the deep cave’s mouth.”*
Later, the inscription vanished.

*The Empty Sayings* states: Zhang Zhihe had a servant named Fisher Lad and a maid named Woodcutter Green. When asked the reason, he replied: “My servant tends the fishing line and plucks the zither among the reeds; my maid gathers orchid firewood and cassia kindling, brewing tea in bamboo.”

Wang the Elder threshes wheat, Zhang Ji cracks the melon.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Wang the Elder was a native of Yijun County in Fangzhou. Dwelling in the countryside, he was deeply fond of the Dao and cherished guests. One day, a ragged Daoist arrived at his door. Wang and his wife received him with courtesy. After staying for over a month, the Daoist suddenly broke out in foul sores all over his body. Wang sought physicians and tended to him with increasing diligence, but the Daoist said, “No need for medicine—just prepare several *hu* of fine wine, and I will soak in it to heal myself.” Wang then brewed the wine. When it was ready, the Daoist ordered it stored in a large jar, added medicine, and immersed himself within. After two days, he emerged with hair and beard turned black, his complexion restored to youth, his skin smooth as congealed lard. He then bade Wang drink it. At the time, Wang was threshing wheat, so he shared the wine with his wife, children, and fellow laborers. All grew deeply drunk. The Daoist drank as well, asking, “Would you like to ascend to heaven?” Suddenly, an auspicious wind arose, and colorful clouds billowed forth. The entire household—people, chickens, and dogs—flew away together, the sound of threshing wheat still lingering in the air. Today, the village of Shengxian remains west of Yijun County.

*The Miscellaneous Records of Yang Wen* recounts: Zhang Ji lived outside the city walls when a recluse—none other than the immortal Lü Dongbin—visited him. Zhang received him with utmost reverence. The immortal asked for paper and brush, writing a seven-character poem in clerical script, leaving it for Zhang. The verses hinted at the fleeting nature of high office and prestige, concluding: *“Success will come in the year you crack the melon.”* The common folk interpret “cracking the melon” as the age of sixteen (two eights), but Zhang indeed lived to sixty-eight, proving the immortal’s foresight.

Clouds and rain of Mount Wu, ice and snow of Guye.

*The Collected Records of Transcendents* states: The Lady Yunhua was the twenty-third daughter of the Queen Mother of the West, named Yaoji. Once, while traveling to the Eastern Sea, she passed by the Yangtze River and came upon Mount Wu, where peaks and ridges soared, forests and ravines lay in serene beauty, and a massive stone resembled an altar. She lingered there for a long time. At that moment, the Great Yu was controlling the floods and had halted at the mountain’s base. A sudden gale arose, shaking cliffs and valleys, its force uncontrollable. Yu encountered Yaoji and bowed, beseeching her aid. She commanded her attendants to bestow upon Yu a talisman to summon spirits, then ordered her divine servants to assist him in cleaving rocks and dredging waves, blocking side channels to preserve the main flow. Yu later visited her at Chongyao, but in the blink of an eye, she transformed into stone. At times, she would swiftly ascend, scattering into light clouds; at others, she would linger, gathering into evening rain. Sometimes she became a flying dragon, or a soaring crane—assuming a thousand forms in ten thousand postures, untouchable and elusive. Later, the Chu minister Song Yu spoke of her to King Xiang, but the king, unable to seek the essence of the Dao for immortality, built a terrace at the Gaotang Palace and established the Changtai Temple to worship her. Song Yu composed *The Rhapsody of the Divine Woman*, imbuing it with licentious sentiment and base rhetoric, wrongly dragging down a lofty transcendent.

*Zhuangzi* states: On the distant Guye Mountain dwells a divine being. Her skin is like ice and snow, her demeanor supple as a maiden’s. She eats no grain, drinking only wind and dew. She rides the clouds and qi, driving flying dragons, roaming beyond the four seas.

Yuan Jia’s six feats, Suqing’s three perfections.

*The Court and Countryside Gatherings* records: In the Tang dynasty, Yuan Jia was a youth of extraordinary intelligence. With his left hand, he drew circles; with his right, squares. While reciting classics and histories, he counted sheep’s vertebrae, simultaneously composing a forty-character poem—all accomplished in an instant. With his foot, he wrote a perfect verse. These six feats performed at once earned him the title “Divine Child of the Immortals.”

*The Records of Verified Worthies* states: During the Five Dynasties, the Shu Daoist Zhang Suqing painted twelve scrolls of divine transcendents. Ouyang Jiong composed eulogies, and Huang Judong inscribed them in clerical script. Together, they were hailed as the “Three Perfections.”

Le Ba beheads the fox-spirit, Changfang scolds the giant turtle.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: Le Ba heard that the deity of the Lushan Temple spoke to people from behind a curtain. Before Ba arrived, the deity fell silent for over ten days, then vanished without a trace. Ba pursued and captured ghosts, transforming into a scholar who traveled to Qi. The governor of Qi, struck by his striking beauty and eloquence, married his daughter to him. They had a son. When Ba arrived in Qi, he visited the governor, saying, “I hear you have a fine daughter, and her husband is well-versed in the Five Classics. May I meet him?” The governor summoned his son-in-law, who refused to appear. Ba persisted until the son-in-law told his wife, “If I go out today, I will die. What shall I do?” She found this strange. Knowing he would not emerge, Ba gave the governor a talisman. The son-in-law received it, wept, and departed. Ba rebuked him sternly, and he transformed into a fox. Ba beheaded him, and his son also turned into a fox, both slain.

Furthermore, Fei Changfang served as a market inspector when he met the Venerable Hu, gaining the Dao and the power to subdue ghosts. In Runan Commandery, ghosts often appeared each year, parading with the pomp of a governor, drums sounding as they circled the prefecture before departing in sorrow. Later, Changfang visited the prefectural office and encountered one such ghost. He shouted sternly, ordering it seized. The ghost dismounted, kowtowed, and begged for a chance to reform. Changfang scolded, “You show no kindness, recklessly parading before the prefect. Return to your true form!” Instantly, it became a giant soft-shelled turtle. Changfang commanded it to take a talisman to the Lord of Ge Marsh. It left in tears. Those sent to follow saw it reach the marsh and die.

Lei Jian’s sword pierces the Dipper, Yao Zha’s arrow pierces the moon.

*The Book of Jin* records: Between the Dipper and Ox constellations appeared a purple vapor. Lei Huan said, “This is the essence of a treasure sword, its brilliance reaching heaven.” He surmised the sword lay in Fengcheng of Yuzhang. Digging beneath the prison’s foundation to a depth of four *zhang*, he found a stone casket containing a pair of swords—one named Longquan, the other Tai’e. Huan kept one and sent the other to Zhang Hua. After Hua’s execution, the swords vanished.

When Huan died, his son Chong carried the sword and passed by Yanping Ford. Suddenly, it leapt from his waist and fell into the water. Divers sent to retrieve it saw two dragons coiled together, their radiance illuminating the water as they departed. Huan had once said, “Such numinous and wondrous things must eventually transform and depart.” Indeed, it came to pass.

*The Gleamings of Immortal Biographies* records: In the thirtieth year of Yao’s reign, a giant raft floated upon the Western Sea. Upon the raft shone a light that gleamed by night and faded by day. Those who dwelt by the sea observed its glow waxing and waning like the rising and setting of stars and moon. The raft perpetually circled the Four Seas, completing one revolution of the heavens every twelve years, returning to its starting point without end. It was named the Moon-Piercing Raft.

Zhang Ge calls butterflies; Chuping commands sheep.

*The Biographies of Scattered Immortals* states: During the Qingli era, there lived a man named Zhang Jiuge in the capital, who possessed the arts of the Dao. One day, the Prince of Yan ascended a tower and summoned him. After bestowing wine upon him, Jiuge said, “I have a small marvel I wish to present to Your Highness.” The prince asked, “What trick is this?” Jiuge replied, “I require a bolt of silk and a pair of golden scissors.” The prince provided them. Jiuge took the silk, cut it into shapes of bees and butterflies, and with each snip, they took flight—countless in number. Some alighted upon the prince’s robes, others clustered upon the hairpins and ornaments of his beauties. The prince, astonished and delighted, turned to gaze in wonder. Jiuge said, “I fear Your Highness may lose some of your silk.” He then called to them, and one by one, they returned, reassembling into the bolt of silk. Only one section remained incomplete, marked by the trace of a butterfly—one had been caught by a palace attendant. The prince asked, “Can this butterfly be restored?” Jiuge replied, “It cannot. Had it returned at my call, it would have been possible. But now, too much time has passed, and it shall remain here as a marvel.” With that, he took his leave.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Huang Chuping was sent by his family to herd sheep. A Daoist took him into Golden Flower Mountain, and he never returned. His brother, Chuqi, searched for him in vain. Later, in the marketplace, he encountered a Daoist who asked, “Is that not the young shepherd from beneath Golden Flower Mountain?” Chuqi followed the Daoist to see his brother. When he asked where the sheep were, Chuping replied, “The sheep are east of the mountain.” Chuqi went to look but saw only white stones. Chuping shouted at them, and the stones all transformed into sheep.

Shunxing repels the Rong; Jinxian reviles the Qiang.

*The New Record of the Red Terrace* states: Li Shunxing, at the age of eleven, became a disciple of a Daoist. One day, thousands of flying immortals gathered in the sky above, their divine radiance illuminating the chamber. The Celestial Attendant of the Scriptures was commanded to open the repository of nine-colored flowing clouds, from which two scrolls were brought forth and bestowed upon him. Emperor Wen of Wei once summoned him to the capital, where both court and common folk revered and trusted him, calling him Master Li the Alchemist. At the age of thirty-eight, in the sixth year of the Datong era, he feigned illness and announced his passing. On the day of his burial, his nephew encountered him on the road to Mount Li and said, “If the Son of Heaven has not yet forgotten me, you may erect my image here, facing north, and I shall ward off the corrupt customs of the northern Rong for the nation.” His nephew returned home only to learn of his death. He reported the matter in full to the throne. Envoys were sent to exhume the coffin, but it was found empty. A shrine was then established in Shayuan, named the Sacred Li.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Wang Yan served as President of the Secretariat under Emperor Wu of Jin, and his daughter, named Jinxian, was the consort of Crown Prince Minhuai. When Luoyang fell, Liu Yao and Shi Le abducted Jinxian and attempted to cross the Meng Ford. There, they sought to take her as a wife. Jinxian cursed them, saying, “I am the wife of the Crown Prince, daughter of the Minister of Works. How dare you, barbarian dogs, presume to touch me?” With these words, she threw herself into the river. Her maidservant, named Liuchu, then declared, “If the great one has done so, the lesser should follow.” She, too, leapt into the river. At that moment, the Female Perfected of Mount Song, Han Xihua, was traveling and took pity on them. She rescued the two, concealing their true fate while outwardly appearing as if they had perished. Their bodies were secretly preserved, and they were taken into Mount Song, where they were installed in the Grotto of Flourishing Yang to assume new ranks among the immortals. Liuchu was then twenty-two or twenty-three, of comely appearance and resolute character. Her original surname was Tian, and she hailed from Yuyang. She was the granddaughter of Tian Feng, former magistrate of Junyi during the Wei dynasty. Feng had once performed a hidden act of virtue, which extended to Liuchu.

Meng Qin’s whirlwind spins; Qiu Lin’s clouds soar.

*The Unofficial History of Jin* states: Meng Qin mastered the arts of Zuo Ci and Liu Gen, and the people flocked to him. The ruler Fu Jian, displeased by his sway over the masses, sought to execute him. Suddenly, Qin appeared before him. Jian detained him, and as they drank, the ruler ordered his attendants to seize him. Qin transformed into a whirlwind and departed. Someone reported he was east of the city, but when pursued, he was suddenly before the Han River, which could not be crossed.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Fan Qiulin served as the Lifeguard Assistant in the Grotto of Flourishing Yang. Skilled in the art of whistling, his notes resembled the mingling of a hundred birds, now like the wind stirring the forest, now like the beat of drums. In an instant, clouds soared above him, and vital qi stirred the woods.

Xiu Fu’s vengeance on the dancing girl; Xu Gu’s wrath upon the lecherous monks.

*The Gleamings of Immortal Biographies* states: Chen Xiufu, known as Chen the Seventh Son, once attended a banquet hosted by the governor of Banan. There, a dancing girl insulted him. Xiufu merely smiled at her, and in an instant, the girl’s beard grew several feet long. She wept and complained to the governor, who apologized on her behalf. Xiufu then sipped a mouthful of wine and sprayed it upon her. After a long while, she returned to her former state. He then took his leave.

*The Extensive Records* states: Immortal Lady Xu was the daughter of Xu Zhicai, the Grand Preceptor of Northern Qi. Though she lived for several centuries, her appearance remained that of a woman of twenty-four or twenty-five. Skilled in the arts of restraint and incantation, she wandered all famous mountains and scenic landscapes, often lodging in the caves and foothills. Once, while staying at a monastery, she was subtly insulted by several arrogant monks with cunning words. The lady rebuked them, but the monks grew only more enraged. She laughed and said, “I am but a woman, yet I have abandoned home and family to roam the rivers and clouds, unafraid of dragons and tigers. How could I fear the likes of you, mere rats?”

The lady then removed her outer garments and suddenly extinguished the candle. The monks rejoiced, believing they had gained the upper hand. By dawn, as the lady prepared her staff to depart the mountain, all the monks stood frozen in place like corpses, their mouths unable to speak. Only after she had gone several *li* did they return to normal.

The Eight Lords of Huainan and the Ten Elders of Tiangu.
*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: King Liu An of Huainan humbled himself to honor scholars. Eight lords arrived at his gate, and the gatekeeper said, “His Highness seeks to extend his lifespan and attain the Dao of agelessness. Yet all of you are already old.” The lords replied, “If the king wishes to see youths and call them ‘possessors of the Dao,’ we shall oblige by becoming young.” With these words, they transformed into boys, their complexions like peach blossoms.

*The Biography of Master Gao*: The Dharma Master Yan Da, styled Daotong, harbored aspirations beyond the mundane from childhood. Together with Wang Yan, Su Daobiao, Cheng Faming, Zhou Huasheng, Wang Zhenwei, Shi Daole, Yu Changwen, Zhang Facheng, and Fu Daochong—ten men who vied in their mastery of the Dao and shared the same path—he was known to the world as the Ten Elders.

Zhao Sheng plucked the peach; the field master descended with jujubes.
*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: The Han Celestial Master led his disciples to the summit of Cloud Terrace, a sheer cliff. Below grew a single peach tree, its branches like human arms, clinging to the stone wall above an unfathomable abyss. The peaches were large and ripe. The Celestial Master said to his disciples, “Whoever can retrieve these peaches shall be taught the essentials of the Dao.” Over two hundred disciples crouched to peer down, their legs trembling and sweat streaming, yet none dared linger. All retreated, claiming they could not do it. Only Zhao Sheng cast a wooden plank from above, stepped onto it without stumbling, and gathered an armful of peaches. The Celestial Master then divided them among the disciples. Later, he transmitted to Sheng the ultimate Dao, and Sheng ascended to the heavens in broad daylight.

**Records of Eminent Daoists**: Master Tian, whose given name was Shiwen, hailed from Gulao. He received the teachings of the Three Caverns and practiced qi refinement through ingestion and fasting, never once neglecting his devotions. Whenever he performed rituals to beseech blessings or heal the sick, his prayers were invariably answered, and the afflicted recovered. Once, when Chen Gang invited him to conduct a jiao offering, spirits suddenly descended with several jujubes onto the altar—fruits unlike any found in the mortal realm. Dreams of blossoms and grass: Yi Mengchang wore flowers, while Ziwei was clad in reeds.

**Elegant Talks from the Prefectural Pavilion**: Yi Mengchang’s origins are unknown; he took his name after dreaming of two suns. In the late Tang, he declined office, donning feathered robes to wander mountains and rivers in carefree abandon, ever fond of carrying flowers. In *Later Collection of Green Locks*, Mengchang once inscribed a poem on the immortal’s altar at Sikong Temple in You County:
*"Only green pines idly play with the sun’s light,*
*No cloud-borne cranes ever lead men astray."*
And on a yellow hibiscus:
*"Dew congeals on golden cups, dripping the last of the wine,*
*Sandalwood dots the beauty’s lips, exhaling rare fragrance."*
Later, Mengchang achieved liberation in death; when his coffin was opened, no corpse remained.

**Extensive Records of the Taiping Era**: During the reign of Duke Jing of Song, a master of astrology was offered the rank of grand minister. He was stationed in a towering pavilion to observe celestial omens, provided with delicacies and adorned in precious robes. One day, a wild man clad in reeds and bearing brambles knocked at the gate and requested an audience. The duke received him in the grand hall, where the stranger spoke of future portents and past events with unfailing accuracy. By night, he studied the stars; by day, he calculated with charts and scrolls. He refused fine garments and rare foods. The duke bowed and asked, *"Now that the state faces ruin and chaos, how may you aid me?"* The man replied, *"When virtue is uneven, disorder draws near. Cultivate virtue to draw the people, and heaven will send auspicious signs, while men will praise your transformation."* The duke praised his words and bestowed upon him the surname Zi and the name Wei—thus was Ziwei born. Wan transmitted the eight sounds, while Wei bequeathed three treasures.

**Supplement to Immortal Biographies**: Wan Baochang’s origins are unknown. From childhood, he excelled in music. One day in the countryside, he encountered a group of ten or so figures in resplendent carriages and robes, their banners arrayed in grandeur. They summoned him, saying, *"The Celestial Emperor has deemed you naturally attuned to music. He will transmit the eight sounds to the latter age, for the music of this declining era must be rectified to restore the true tones of the Zhengshi reign. You have not yet fully grasped them."* They seated him and taught him the music of past dynasties, the sounds of order and chaos—nothing was omitted. Baochang committed it all to memory. Thereafter, the immortals ascended into the void. From that time, no earthly music escaped his mastery.

**Records of Immortal Responses**: Wei Na, styled Jingzhao, failed the imperial examinations and traveled to Shu. At the Zheng family’s garden pavilion, he saw dozens of immortals in attendance, their embroidered skirts and radiant robes beyond mortal ken. They told him, *"We have a new melody called 'Purple Clouds.' Today, the Son of Heaven reveres the Dao of immortals. We wish to entrust this music to you, that you may present it to the sage ruler of the Tang. May we rely on you?"* Wei replied, *"I am but a scholar, unversed in music. I cannot fulfill this."* The immortals said, *"If you cannot, we shall convey it to the emperor in a dream. Yet your presence here is fated by the Dao. We gift you three treasures, the sale of which will enrich you for life."* They ordered an attendant to bring forth a cup called the Jade-Green Chalice, a pillow resembling jade but veined like millet, and a purple jade casket—all luminous and translucent. Wei accepted them with bows and thanks, then took his leave. When he turned back, the pavilion had vanished.

**Hidden Immortal and Ghostly Officials**: Qin Shuang concealed himself as an immortal elder; Zhou Yan served as a ghostly marshal.

**New Records of the Elixir Terrace**: Qin Shuang now dwells as an immortal elder on Mount Hua.

**True Sayings**: Zhou Yan was appointed marshal of the ghostly bureaucracy.
*Note*: Zhou Yan, styled Boren, was a native of Ancheng in Runan. He served the Jin and crossed the Yangtze, rising to the rank of Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat. In the first year of Yongchang under Emperor Yuan, Wang Dun marched south. Zhou was arrested at the southern gate of Stone Citadel and executed at age fifty-four. He was posthumously enfeoffed as Marquis Kang of Jiyin.

**The Thief of Books and the Pilferer of Elixirs**: Jia Dan stole scriptures; divine mastery purloined cinnabar.

**Unofficial Histories**: One day, Jia Dan ordered his guards to retrieve documents from a dry well. They recovered several scrolls—all Daoist texts. He dispatched over ten men to copy them. As they finished, a Daoist suddenly burst in, shouting Jia’s name and berating him for daring to steal the books. Jia humbly apologized, and the Daoist took them back.

**Records of Eminent Daoists**: Fu Shentong was orphaned young and impoverished, herding cattle to support himself. At his pasture, he often saw a Daoist coming and going. Over time, they grew familiar, and the Daoist asked, *"Could you become my disciple?"* Shentong replied, *"I could."* The Daoist then led him into the water.

You should follow him without fear. Upon entering, he saw the dwelling was solemn and pristine, with medicine pouches and alchemical furnaces. The Daoist had Shentong tend the fire and taught him the arts of *huangbai* transmutation. After three years, Shentong often longed for human contact. One day, when the Daoist was away, he secretly took some elixir and hid it elsewhere. Upon returning, the Daoist asked where the elixir was, but Shentong concealed the truth. The Daoist sighed, *"I originally intended to transmit the essential Dao to you, but now, how can I teach you further? Though you have mastered all these methods, they will not aid your longevity."* He then departed.

**Crane-Boned Liao, Jade-Faced Ping of Ping’a**:
**Records of Precious Guests**: During the Tang, Jiang Fang composed the stele inscription for Master Liao of Jingfu Mountain in Lianzhou. *Chong* was his given name, *Qingling* his courtesy name, and *Jingfu* his residence. His name was inscribed on the jade halls and golden tablets; his home lay beyond the crimson clouds. As for his crane-like bones and pine-like visage, his pure demeanor and empty heart—dwelling among mortals yet unburdened by heaven and earth—he counted among his teachers and friends Fusang Gong, Tao Yinju, and Celestial Master Zhang.

**Divine Immortals’ Biographies**: Liu Ping’a did not reveal his given name. During the late Han, he served as Magistrate of Ping’a in Jiujiang, adopting the title as his sobriquet. He practiced medicine to save others, feeling their illnesses as his own. Later, he encountered a divine being who taught him the Way of Concealed Preservation. He ingested the essence of the sun and moon, residing in the celestial palaces, his complexion like jade.

**Three Swords of Guarding the True, Four Rings of Yang Bao**:
**Biographies of the Wondrous Sage**: In the early Jianlong era, the Black Killer descended and said to Zhang Shouzhen, *"You are a man of integrity and purity, fit to expel evil. I shall first teach you the sword arts to rid the people of demons."* The sword techniques numbered three: one of bronze and iron, tempered into a sharp blade—with but a glance from his eyes, he could wield it. For the afflicted, a single flourish dispelled malevolent *qi*. Earth spirits causing calamity and aquatic creatures turning monstrous were subdued by the upper sword. Strange phenomena in mountains and marshes were quelled by the middle sword. *Wangliang* harming humans were vanquished by the lower sword.

**Sequel to Qi Xie’s Records**: Yang Bao saw a yellow sparrow struck down by a crow. He took it and placed it upon the rafters, feeding it yellow flowers. Once its feathers regrew, it would depart at dawn and return at dusk. One night, a yellow-robed youth appeared, saying, *"I am the Queen Mother’s messenger. Once, en route to Penglai, I was struck down by a crow. Thanks to your rescue, I gift you these four rings, that your descendants may remain pure and ascend to the rank of the Three Dukes—just as these rings."* Bao’s son Zhen fathered four generations of eminent officials.

*End of Scroll Eight of the Comprehensive Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns*
*Scroll Nine of the Comprehensive Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns*

**Compiled by Orthodox Unity Daoist Chen Baoguang**

The Barefoot Immortal, the Yellow-Haired Elder.

*Extending the Records of Marvels*: Academician Le of the Bureau of Historiography, Shi Jingde, once served as Supervising Censor of the Western Capital. He dreamed of a man in full court regalia who announced, *"I come by imperial command to summon you."* Soon, he beheld magnificent palaces and asked the messenger, *"Whose residence is this?"* The reply: *"This is the Emperor’s abode."* Ascending the steps to meet the Emperor, he was told, *"Your lord seeks an heir. I shall select one for him."* After a brief interval, a man appeared, and the Emperor said, *"The Central Plains seek an heir. Go, and do not refuse."* The man bowed repeatedly, pleading for exemption, but the Emperor insisted, *"Go."* He assented and departed. A courtier standing nearby remarked, *"This is the Barefoot Immortal Li of Mount Heng, who often revels in wine."* The following year, Emperor Renzong was born.

*Records of the Forgotten*: Li Pin, at the end of the declining Zhou, dwelled on Mount Fanjingrishishi, cutting all ties with the world. Only five yellow-haired elders visited him—some riding swans and cranes, others clad in feathered robes. Their ears emerged from the crowns of their heads, their pupils were square, their complexions lustrous as jade. Each grasped a staff of green bamboo, and together with Pin, they discoursed on the reckonings of heaven and earth. When King Ling later sought the *Yi* from the Archivist beneath the Pillars, desiring to gather all who cultivated the Dao under heaven, scholars from the four seas flocked to him without exception. The Five Elders were the essences of the Five Directions.

Jing Tang’s Jade Table, the Bright Star’s Stone Mortar.

*Investigations of the Spirit Realm*: Cui Jingtang of Ruyin once hosted a Daoist who claimed the surname Mei. After several months as a guest, Jingtang acquired a jade table and intended to present it to Gao Shensi, Military Commissioner of Shouchun. He told Mei, *"Master, remain here while I journey to Shouchun."* Returning within ten days, he instructed his nephews to attend to Mei, assuring him of no cause for concern. Mei replied, *"I am from Shouchun and was traveling north to visit a relative. I, too, shall return soon. You may go ahead. After staying here so long, I wish to repay your family. Do you have mercury?"* Jingtang said, *"Yes."* Mei took ten taels, placed them in a cauldron, and refined them with fire. In moments, the mercury turned to silver. He said to Jingtang, *"Take this as provisions for your journey. When you reach Shouchun, seek my home east of the city."* They parted ways. Later, Cui searched for Mei’s residence in the eastern part of the city but found nothing for days. Villagers all said, *"There is no Daoist here surnamed Mei. Only in the Temple of the Prince of Huainan stands an image of Master Mei. Could it be him?"* Following their suggestion, he found the image—indeed, it was the True Lord Mei. Thereafter, he never encountered him again.

*The Collected Records of Immortals*: The Radiant Star Jade Maiden dwells on Mount Hua, partaking of jade nectar, and ascends to heaven in broad daylight. Atop the mountain lies a stone terrace, spanning several acres and rising three *chi* in height. There are five stone mortars, known as the Jade Maiden’s Hair-Washing Basin, wherein the water remains emerald-clear, neither swelling with rain nor dwindling in drought. Within the shrine stands a jade stone horse. He Gu was an old acquaintance; Li Sheng, a former friend.

*Gleanings from the Past*: The scholar Yuan Xia of Hongzhou, while accompanying his parents through Yongzhou, encountered He the Immortal Maiden and said, *"My homeland has a Pavilion of Old Acquaintances, and Yongzhou has one as well. If this is genuine, that is false; if this is false, that is genuine. Pray, Immortal, settle the matter."* The Immortal replied, *"This pavilion’s name derives from a selected poem: ‘By Dongting Lake, I meet a returning traveler; by Xiao and Xiang, I encounter an old friend.’ The waters of Dongting and the currents of Xiao and Xiang share a single source. Now, within Yongzhou’s borders, the Xiang River flows from the left, and the Xiao River converges on the right—hence the name ‘Yong.’ Thus, Yongzhou’s pavilion bears the true name, while the other does not."* She then bestowed a poem:
*"Yong has long been called the old prefecture,
By Xiao and Xiang’s source, a new pavilion stands.
Before its gates, flowing waters have run since ancient days,
Yet now, no old friends remain upon its terrace.
A gentle breeze, the slanting sun—southern Chu at dusk,
Crows cry, blossoms fall—eastern Zhe in spring.
Since you ask of former times,
The pavilion’s name by the Jiang’s left is not the true one."*

*The Collected Biographies of Immortals*: Li Sheng, styled Yunju, cultivated the arts of refining *qi* and nurturing form. When Yuan Qiao governed the east of Zhe and Bai Juyi served as prefect of Qiantang, both—being old friends of Sheng—admired his literary grace and Daoist attainments. They invited him to their banquets and asked, *"In this age of peace, why not seek rank and emolument instead of remaining a commoner?"* The Master slowly intoned:
*"Born into a Confucian family in an age of peace,
The profound and mysterious weighs heavy, while commoner’s garb is light.
How could I chase fame and profit along the world’s paths?
I serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Supreme Clarity."*

Cheng Zi was bitten by a serpent; Chen Chun vomited a crane.

*The Declarations of the Perfected*: Long ago, Cheng Zi of Leisure, from youth enamored of longevity, studied the Dao for over forty years. Later, he entered the depths of Mount Jing, where, after seventy years, the mountain spirit tested him. Mistaking the spirit for a Perfected One, Cheng Zi bowed and sought the Dao—only to be seized and nearly devoured by a great serpent. He narrowly survived by swiftly awakening, invoking the Supreme, and visualizing the Seven Stars to repel it.

*The Green Locks*: Chen Chun reached Peach Blossom Spring and, captivated by the unmatched beauty of its Han Mountains, packed provisions and followed the Han River in search of wonders. After nine days, he arrived beneath a towering cliff. That night, he heard voices within the rock face. Exhausted and out of food, he suddenly detected a sweet fragrance, and more than ten petals of a giant flower drifted out. He gathered and ate them. Soon after, a green-clad maiden appeared on the bank below, gathering water plants. He inquired of her, and she replied, *"This is the domain of the Lady of the Three Springs. On the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, three Immortals will gather here."* Presently, the Three Ladies invited him in. He beheld crimson doors and jade windows, unlike anything in the mortal world. A feast commenced, and music played as he exchanged verses with the Ladies in perfect harmony. They cautioned him, *"Beware of going to the southern pavilion."* Chen Chun stealthily entered the pavilion and found a jade flute upon the table. He took it and blew, whereupon his hometown, its people, mountains, and rivers appeared vividly before him—his wife and children laughing and conversing. After a long while, the vision vanished. Chen Chun, unaware, vomited an egg, which fell to the ground and hatched into a crane that flew away. The Immortals reproached him: *"You heeded not our warning—was this not fate? Thirty years hence, you shall return here."* They then sent Chen Chun home by boat.

The Guests of Siming; the Immortal Maidens of the Nine Palaces.

*The Declarations of the Perfected*: Emperor Wu of Wei served as Grand Tutor to the Northern Lord; Sun Ce, Emperor Gaozu of Han, Emperor Wu of Jin, and Xun Yu were the Guests of Siming.

*The Biographies of Female Immortals*: During the reign of Emperor Gaoxin, the land of Shu had no ruler or governor, and its people devoured one another in turn. The father of the Silkworm Maiden was seized by neighbors, leaving only his horse behind. The maiden, grieving for her father, neglected food and drink. Her mother consoled her and vowed before all, *"Whoever brings my husband home shall have this daughter as his wife."* Yet none could retrieve him. One day, the horse broke free of its tether and departed, returning with the father. Thereafter, the horse neighed incessantly and refused to eat. The father said, *"I vowed to give my daughter to a man, but how can a horse be matched with a human?"* Enraged, he shot and killed the horse, then dried its hide in the courtyard. As the maiden passed by the hide, it suddenly wrapped around her, and she flew away.

After ten days, the hide came to rest upon a mulberry tree, and the maiden transformed into a silkworm, feeding on the leaves and spinning silk into cocoons, which clothed the people of the world. Her parents grieved for her without end, until suddenly the Silkworm Maiden descended from the heavens upon a cloud, riding that very horse. She spoke to her parents, *"The Supreme One, in recognition of my filial devotion, has appointed me as a celestial consort of the Nine Palaces. You need no longer sorrow."* Then she ascended once more into the clouds and departed. From this arose the custom in Shu: in official temples and private shrines, statues of a maiden draped in horsehide were fashioned, called the Horse-Head Maiden, to invoke blessings upon sericulture.

**Jade Mist of Yuyi, Pearl Dust of Cangwu.**
*The Record of Forgotten Tales* states: East of Penglai lies the land of Yuyi, where golden mists often drift, rising and falling like mountains or towering pavilions, their doors and windows ever facing the light. When the mist dissipates, the doors all turn northward. South of Daiyu Mountain stretches a thousand *li* of level sands, golden as powdered flakes, flowing endlessly like a river. When birds or beasts tread upon it, their feet sink into it; when the wind stirs, the sand rises like mist—this too is called *golden mist*. In the time of Emperor Shun, birds like sparrows came from Danzhou, exhaling vapors of five colors that billowed like clouds, called *Pingxiao*. These birds could fly ceaselessly, carrying green sand-pearls. When a light breeze blew, the dust rose—this was called *pearl dust*. Today, beyond Cangwu, mountain hermits gathering herbs sometimes find round green stones like pearls. Those who consume them do not die; those who wear them feel their bodies grow light. Thus, an immortal’s verse in praise of the Southern Marchmount reads:
*Pearl dust, round and still, light and bright—*
*Those who follow the Dao and consume it gain long life.*

**Ma Ming’s healing of illness, Qiao Yan’s relief of poverty.**
*The Biographies of the Immortals* records: Ma Mingsheng was a minor county clerk in his youth when he was slain by bandits. As he lay dying, a divine being saved him with medicine, restoring him to life. Realizing then that the path to immortality was proven true, he followed the immortal, carrying medicinal herbs to Mount Lu to receive the essential teachings. After mastering the arts, Ma Ming traveled the world, enduring hardship and toil. He chose to refine medicines to heal the sick rather than ascend to heaven. Though he dwelled among people, few knew he was a transcendent.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Tan Qiaoyan was a Daoist of Mount Mao during the Baoli era. He wandered through Tiantai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, appearing no older than twenty. None knew he possessed the Dao. He devoted himself to secret acts of merit, often leaving gold along the road to aid the poor. If someone returned it, he would not acknowledge it; when asked why, he replied, *"The Perfected Lord of the Hidden Realm transforms earth into gold to relieve those in need. I regret I cannot do the same. What is the harm in leaving useless things for others?"* In time, it became known that he possessed the divine elixir that transmutes gold.

**Yu Zhang’s exorcism of malevolence, Yuan Ze’s chastisement of spirits.**
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: The Master Yu Zhang, styled Changwen, received from the Yellow Hua Elder and the Perfected Lord of the Supreme Ultimate the sixty cyclical signs, the talismans and seals of the Five Emperors and Five Marchmounts—one hundred thirty-six in all—as well as treatises on the origins of heaven and earth, the fundamentals of talismans, and the methods for setting up altars. He recorded the dates of talisman transmissions, the lunar phases, and the oral instructions of the perfected immortals in meticulous order. Thus, his understanding of the unseen deepened daily, enabling him to dispel demons and sever malevolence. His divine transformations were boundless, and the common people who benefited grew ever more numerous.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* further records: Zuo Yuanze, at the Green Screen Abbey in Wenzhou, found that the local earth god was customarily offered blood sacrifices. If the rites were neglected, the god would wreak havoc. Yuanze struck the spirit’s back three times with his staff. The next day, a large raccoon dog was found dead in the courtyard, its back bearing three staff marks. The villagers later dreamed the god said, *"The one who attached himself to me was beaten to death by a celestial official. Beware of offering me blood sacrifices again."*

**Yu Jun’s five branches, Ji Qing’s single leaf.**
*The Records of Dou Lianyi* states: Dou Yujun once dreamed his ancestors told him he would have no sons and his lifespan was short. Ten years later, he dreamed again that his ancestors said, *"Thirty years ago, you were indeed fated to be childless and short-lived. I secretly informed you of this. But in recent years, your name has been inscribed in the celestial and netherworld registers, for your hidden virtues have extended your allotted years by three cycles and granted you five sons, all of whom will achieve honor and longevity. You will die in peace, and afterward, you will reside in a grotto-heaven as a perfected immortal."* Thus, Feng Dao composed a poem for Yujun:
*Dou the Tenth of Yanshan,*
*Taught his sons the righteous way.*
*A sacred trunk stands old and tall,*
*While five branches of the immortal cassia bloom.*
This is the tale to which he referred.

*The Supplementary Records of Immortals’ Biographies*:
Chen Jiqing once traveled to the Qinglong Monastery in Chang’an, where he met an old man in yellow who sat with him by the brazier. On the wall hung a *Map of All Under Heaven*, depicting the lands of Hua and Yi. Jiqing sighed, *"Ten years I’ve been away from home, enduring hardships for ten thousand li—how might I cross the Huai and float the Luo to return to my native hills?"* The old man laughed and said, *"This is no difficult matter."* He ordered a servant boy to pluck a bamboo leaf from before them and place it upon the Wei River on the map. *"Fix your gaze upon this boat, and your long-held wish shall be fulfilled."* Jiqing stared intently—suddenly, the Wei’s waters stirred, and the bamboo leaf swelled into a mighty vessel. In a daze, he found himself sailing upon it, soon arriving home. There, his brothers, wife, and children joyfully welcomed him with bows. Afterward, he bade them farewell, boarded the boat once more, and reached the Wei’s banks—only to awaken as if from a dream, still seated before the painted map, the immortal elder tending the brazier as before. Jiqing expressed his gratitude and asked the old man’s name. The elder replied, *"I do not delight in revealing my surname to mortals. I have dwelt on Mount Zhongnan for seven hundred years. You possess the bones of one destined for the Dao, and thus we met."*

Feng Jun carried the sack; Wang Yao bore the basket.
*The Records of Original Transformations*:
Feng Jun of Guangling earned his livelihood as a hired laborer. One day in the market, he encountered a Daoist purchasing herbs. The Daoist placed them in a sack weighing over a hundred *jin* and hired Jun to carry it. They traveled to Liuhe, where they boarded a small boat. In an instant, they arrived at Xingzi Bay on Mount Lu, where a vast lake stretched before them, its surrounding peaks rising in layered beauty. The Daoist disembarked and walked five or six *li* to the foot of a mountain, where a massive boulder, several *zhang* square, stood. He struck it with a stone, and the boulder split open. Two young boys emerged from within, while inside the grotto, several Daoists played chess and laughed. The Daoist said, *"The one who carried the load is very hungry."* They gave him sesame rice to eat, then told Jun, *"You have labored far for us—here are a thousand coins as reward."* Jun declined and prepared to leave. The Daoist pointed to a stone shaped like a tiger and instructed him to mount it. With a flick of his whip, the stone flew away like the wind, and in the blink of an eye, Jun found himself outside the gates of Guangling. By the time he reached home, dusk had fallen. He lit a candle and untied the money from his waist—only to find it transformed into gold.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals*:
When Wang Yao was caught in the rain, he had his disciple carry a nine-jointed staff and a basket, yet neither became wet.

Lu rebuked the bandits; Liu and Feng halted the robbers.
*The Youyang Miscellany*:
A man named Lu was traveling to Fuzhou with several companions when they encountered six or seven men in fine clothes, their breath reeking of wine. Lu suddenly shouted at them, *"Your deeds are unrighteous—your lives will not last long!"* The men prostrated themselves in the dust, bowing their heads in submission. His companions were astonished, but Lu said, *"These are river bandits."* Such was his extraordinary power.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals*:
Liu Feng of Pei had earned military merit and studied the Dao. Once, merchants from Chang’an accompanied him, carrying goods worth ten thousand in gold. Suddenly, in the mountains, they were ambushed by hundreds of bandits wielding blades and bows, surrounding them on all sides. Feng addressed the robbers: *"You serve in office and eat the emperor’s grain, while I plow the fields and my wife weaves—why do you block the roads, endangering others for your own gain?"* The bandits grew even angrier, but Feng shouted, *"The Heavenly Soldiers strike first!"* Instantly, the bandits turned their hands to bind themselves, blood gushing from their mouths as they collapsed, near death. Those still able to speak begged for mercy, vowing to reform. Feng said, *"I originally intended to kill you all."* Then he commanded the Heavenly Soldiers to release them, and the bandits all rose to their feet.

The rustic wielded a crutch; Zizhi bowed twice.
*Cold Studio Night Talks*:
Liu Yefu was lame and leaned on a crutch. Every year, he would hobble to Luoyang to admire the flowers, regaling others with his witty and engaging tales. He once composed lyrics in varying meters:
*"The lame man these years—what does he resemble?
A full beard, dignified as can be.
In this vast world, his crutch holds all his skill.
No matter north or south, wherever he goes,
he fills his gourd with wine and drinks himself drunk.
Who knows where tomorrow will take him?
After admiring the Luoyang flowers by dusk,
he returns to the imperial city—
with nothing at all.
Passing the gourd-bowl, he takes on disciples anew.
Suddenly, he thinks of a light boat on the water,
a reed mat spread across it.
Laughing heartily, beyond Suiyang’s gates,
there lies a fine West Lake."*

*The Records of Divine Immortals’ Manifestations*:
Wang Zizhi, styled Xianmiao, often traveled between the capital and Luoyang. When Pu Chongying, Duke of Langye, first took up his post as military governor, Zizhi resided at the Purple Ultimate Palace, where the duke treated him with great generosity. Hearing of his fondness for wine, the duke sent him two chests of it daily. Zizhi claimed to be from the Wei clan of Henan. Though his appearance remained that of a man in his forties, he cultivated *qi* and none knew his true age.

Li angled without bait; Tao strummed the stringless zither.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists*:
The Daoist Li Daosheng befriended Zheng Ao and Luo Yinzhi. Zheng farmed the land, while Yinzhi sold herbs to support himself. Daosheng had a fishing rod—he angled without bait. He could also transform stones into gold, a feat Zheng once witnessed and believed, though he never sought such power. All three loved wine, poetry, and the games of chess and whistling.

They possessed a large gourd, said to ward off cold and heat. Wine stored within it would not spoil over time. Daily, they carried it among flowers, trees, waters, and rocks, drinking a cup and reciting a verse. Once, in the midst of wine’s warmth, they composed linked verses. Zheng said:
*“A gourd holds heaven’s famed treasure,*
*Two men wander the world carefree.”*
Luo replied:
*“Drunk, Yinzhi leans on clouds behind—*
*What then is true nature’s design?”*

*The Biographies of Jin Recluses*:
Tao Yuanming, styled Yuanliang, had no ear for music. He kept only a stringless zither, which he would stroke in harmony when gathering with friends over wine. He grasped the zither’s essence—why need the sound of strings?

*Yan the Flame Emperor drilled fire; Fengzi followed the smoke.*
*The Supplementary Biographies of Immortals*:
When King Zhao of Yan ascended the throne, he was devoted to the Dao of immortals, and the immortal Gan Xu served him. After the king had practiced the Way for many years, Gu Jiangzi arrived by emptiness and told him: “The Queen Mother of the West will descend to observe your cultivation and reveal to you the essentials of the numinous origin.” A year later, the Queen Mother indeed came. She wandered with the king beneath the kindling woods, speaking of *Yan the Flame Emperor’s drilling of fire*—how he lit green cassia fat to illuminate the night. Suddenly, a moth bearing fire alighted in the king’s palace, yielding a round pearl of Yuanqiu sand. From it he fashioned a pendant. Ascending the Terrace of Grasping the Sun, he obtained a luminous pearl carried by a divine crow, which dispelled oppressive heat. Thereafter, the Queen Mother descended thrice to the Yan palace, but King Zhao, obsessed with conquest, failed to heed Gan Xu’s counsel of clarity. The Queen Mother never returned.

*The Biographies of Immortals*:
Xiao Fengzi lived in the time of the Yellow Emperor. Legend holds he was the Yellow Emperor’s master potter. A man once passed by and tended his kiln fire, able to emerge and enter through five-colored smoke. In time, he taught Fengzi, who piled fire and burned himself, rising and descending with the smoke.

*Boren received a western posting; Gengsheng was transferred east.*
*The True Sayings*:
The Recorder of Destinies said: “Recently, I saw Zhou Boren appointed as the Western Bright Duke and Protector of the Central Metropolis—a role akin to the Grand Tutor of the mortal realm. Also, Gengsheng, the Grand Marshal Yu Liang of Jin, was assigned by the Great Emperor to govern the spirits of Wu and Yue, overseeing their salt and labor—truly a taxing task.”
Yuanzi said: “Gengsheng has now been transferred to become the Marquis of the Eastern Sea.”

*Changling leaned on his staff; Shiyun rode a boat.*
*Western Clarity’s Poetic Discourse*:
Stone Peak of Yingyang, a towering and elegant summit, bore a stone chamber where Xing Hepu once calculated the heart. During the Zhiping era, Xu Changling Anshi, having early attained the arts of immortality, came to dwell there, staff in hand. The world was awestruck. Later, he traveled to the Palace of Grand Clarity. At the time, Ouyang Xiu, the Cultured and Loyal Duke, governed Bozhou. Though he had never spoken of Buddhism, upon hearing of Changling, he invited him to his official residence. Their conversation brought sudden enlightenment. He presented a poem:
*“Green hair, blue eyes, a frame so light,*
*Soaring away on a crane, playing the flute’s song.*
*Seated in the prefectural hall, bamboo stirs with wind—*
*Could this be Sun Deng’s long whistle?”*
The Duke also once wrote of Changling:
*“Southern Manor faces Northern Manor’s abode,*
*Then deeper into the mountains, ten li more.*
*On woodcutters’ paths I often tread,*
*True feeling parts from worldly lore.*
*Clouded peaks, a dog’s bark as a shooting star flies,*
*Beyond the sky, a cock crows as dawn’s sun rises.*
*Yesterday, someone came to ask after me—*
*Swiftly, I wrote my reply on fallen leaves.”*
Reading this, one can envision the man.

*The Records of the Western Mountains*:
Wu Meng, styled Shiyun, once rode an iron boat atop Mount Lu. Suddenly, a crimson dragon bore him away to roam the sea.

*The Daoist of Yue Creek; the Immortal Lord of Shaoshi.*
*The Gleanings*:
Atop the sheer summit north of Qinchuan City stood the Palace of Po and Xiao, its magnificence beyond description. Its thresholds were carved from green jade, lustrous as glass. A Daoist from Shu said: “An ancient immortal left a poem at the base of the threshold.” Upon searching, they found it:
*“A Daoist from Yue of Han, unknown to men,*
*Ascends and descends heaven on a single crane.*
*The cavern’s gate is locked, jade windows cold,*
*Dripping dew, grinding cinnabar, he marks the *Zhou Changes*.”*

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*:
The Immortal Lord Wang, in the early Tianfu era, wandered from Shangdang. Passing through the Wei clan of northern Deng, he entered Mount Song, roaming forests and valleys until he lost his way. Over a year later, his disciples and kin traveled from Huguan and Taihang, journeying south through Song and Shaoshi. They inquired at the temples and sites they passed, seeking him. At last, they found him in a secluded cliff of Mount Song’s northwest, seated solemnly within a cavern, rapt in meditation. His disciples burned incense and paid reverence, reluctant to leave. The Lord said: “The Supreme One, deeming me to have slight merit, has summoned me to become the Immortal Lord of Shaoshi. The paths of immortals and mortals diverge—do not grieve.” With these words, he soared into the void.

Bi Ling pulled the ship, and Xian Ke’s house ascended.
*According to the* Jin History*: Bi Ling, a native of Jianchang, was reticent by nature. Though he lived among common folk and endured frequent insults, he never showed resentment, earning the village’s nickname of “the fool.” At the time, Fan Changbin, the magistrate of Shunyang, was conscripting laborers to build official boats in the mountains of Jiancheng. When the boats were completed and ready to launch, two hundred men could not budge a single vessel. Just as more workers were being summoned, Bi Ling said, “This is not a matter of insufficient strength, but rather of improper coordination.” He volunteered to pull the boat himself, and with only a few men, it glided away like flowing water. The crowd was astonished, hailing him as divine.*

*From* Miscellaneous Notes from the North*: During the Yifeng era of the Tang, beneath the Cuiwei Mountain in Hengyuan County of Qingcheng, a villager named Wang Xianke consumed an elixir left by a Daoist. His entire household ascended to immortality, as recorded in* A Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals*.*

Qu Sheng fled under the rod, and Luo Yu was exiled for his sins.
*From* Extensive Records*: The Daoist Qu Sheng, beaten by his master, fled in haste into a cave. Moments later, he emerged holding a chess piece, saying, “Just now, I encountered Qin men playing chess and stayed for a drink. This piece is from Qin.” His master examined it—small as a turtle, lustrous as jade.*

*From* True Sayings*: E Lü Hua, a perfected female immortal, descended to the home of Yang Quan during the Jin dynasty’s Shengping era. She declared, “I am Luo Yu, an immortal from Mount Jiuyi who attained the Dao. For my transgressions, I was temporarily exiled to this turbid world to atone.” Turning to Quan, she said, “Have no thoughts, no worries, no demands, no desires, no affairs, no actions. Walk paths others cannot walk, learn what others cannot learn. Cultivate inner serenity and diligent austerity—this is how I have practiced for nine hundred years. Now, I bestow upon you the secret of liberation through apparent death.” Quan, too, attained the Dao and now resides in Xiang Mountain, never emerging.*

Qian Shao received celestial scriptures, and Wang Bao wielded divine strategies.
*From* Continued Biographies of Immortals*: Ye Qianshao studied under a Daoist of the Western Mountains, mastering the teachings of the Twelve Perfected Lords. While dwelling in seclusion, he encountered a divine general bearing a sword and the Tiger-and-Dragon Talisman. Two attendants in yellow and green robes, holding registers, bowed before him, saying, “Heaven commands that you receive this register. Divine generals and soldiers are at your service to aid the world.” Qianshao accepted the celestial scriptures, which resembled military rosters. When summoned, the spirits would arrive. Thereafter, malevolent forces would vanish at the mere mention of his name, and those who received his talismans remained free of illness for life. All regarded him as divine.*

*From* Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*: Wang Bao entered Mount Hua when, one evening, he heard the sounds of flutes and drums. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descended from the void. A divine figure declared, “I am the Perfected Lord of the Great Ultimate. Hearing of your toils in the mountains, though you have yet to grasp the essentials of the Dao, I pity you.” Later, Guo Linggai was commanded to bestow upon him the Jade Seal of Divine Flourish, appointing him Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness to govern the affairs of the Lesser Grotto-Heaven.*

From the east, Wei struck the serpent; Zhao Yu beheaded the flood dragon.
*From* Tales of the Marvelous*: Wei Zidong encountered a Daoist who said, “I am refining the Dragon-Tiger Elixir. In two nights, it will be complete, but many demons and monsters will appear. I need a brave man to wield a sword and stand guard. When the elixir is done, I will share it with you.” Zidong followed the Daoist to a stone chamber on a high peak where the elixir was being refined. The Daoist instructed, “At the fifth watch, stand at the cave’s entrance with your sword. Whatever spirits or monsters appear, strike them without fear.” Soon, a giant serpent approached, and Zidong struck it with his sword, driving it away.*

*From* Records of Extraordinary People*: Zhao Yu studied under the Daoist Li Jue on Mount Qingcheng. Emperor Yang of Sui, recognizing his worth, appointed him governor of Jiazhou. At the time, an ancient flood dragon in the Jianwei Pool was wreaking havoc, sinking seven hundred boats in five months. Enraged, Zhao Yu led a thousand armored soldiers to the riverbanks, drumming and shouting until the earth trembled. He plunged into the water with his blade. After a while, the river turned crimson, and the cliffs shook with thunderous roars. Zhao Yu emerged from the waves, his left hand gripping the dragon’s head and his right wielding the knife.*

Wei saw the severed brush; Cao beheld the eastern reeds.
*From* Extensive Records*: Wei Ziwei, nephew of Wei Xingwu, the Tang dynasty’s inspector of Xichuan, had a subordinate named Ding Yue who served in his ranks. One day, Ding announced his departure, refusing to stay. “We shall meet again near the capital in fifty years,” he said. Ziwei searched for him afterward but found no trace. Later, when Ziwei was traveling to the capital for an official posting, he lodged at an inn on Mount Li. Hearing commotion in the thoroughfare, he went to investigate and saw a grand procession with armored guards and fluttering banners. Among them was Ding. Startled, Ziwei recognized him, and Ding smiled secretly, whispering, “Do you remember our parting at Linyi? Fifty years have passed in an instant.” Ziwei asked how he had achieved this. Ding replied, “I told you long ago—how could I escape it?” When Ziwei offered what he needed, Ding requested a brush. Ziwei searched his bag and handed one over. On the day of execution, Ziwei went to observe. As the blade fell, he alone saw the brush’s tip snap like frost, and in that instant, the condemned Ding leapt free. “From now on, I shall wander afar,” he told Ziwei. “Strive in your Daoist practice. Though two kalpas still separate us, I shall await you in the stone chamber of Kunlun.” With that, he departed. (Daoists call it a *chen*, Buddhists an *effort*, and the worldly call it an *age*.)*

*From* New Records of the Elixir Terrace*: Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, was skilled in transformations. When Cao Cao sought him, Zuo refused. Enraged, Cao ordered his capture, commanding pursuers to kill him on sight. Days later, someone claimed to have seen Zuo and beheaded him, presenting the head to Cao. Overjoyed, Cao examined it—only to find it was a bundle of eastern reeds.*

The left serpent coiled in retreat; the tiger of Chen roared in fury.
*From* Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: Zuo Yuanze dwelled in a cliffside chamber. To its left stood ten great bamboos, and before it, a winding pond bore dozens of emerald lotuses. Dozens of patterned birds, resembling swans and mandarin ducks, swam among them.*

Drawn by its charm, he thus spent the night in the chamber. As night fell, something coiled around his body. Upon waking, he merely sat with eyes closed, and only at dawn did it release him. Inspecting his coarse hemp robe, he found only traces of foul, viscous drool.

That evening, he sat again in the chamber, pacing with a net to await it. Sure enough, a creature emerged from the pond—several *zhang* in length, its eyes casting a radiance like twisted glass. With a sharp rebuke from the cliffside, it slowly recoiled and slithered back into the pool. He then warned: "Let later disciples take heed: never dwell alone in caves or grottoes."

Moreover, Master Zhengyi, surnamed Chen and named Baochi, recited the *Great Cavern Scripture* with such resonance that rare birds and strange beasts would often attend him in guard. Each morning at the Laozi shrine and on the eight seasonal festivals when he cast dragon tablets, a white tiger would docilely accompany him, leading his retinue to and fro. If anyone harbored ill intent, the tiger would roar and surge forward, striking the leftmost locust tree in the courtyard—so terrifying the malefactor that they would flee in fear. Thus, the tree was called the "Tiger-Testing Wood."

The Duke of Fang warded off lingering rats; his loyalty and forbearance earned him the name "Cat."
*From* Anecdotes of Immortals*: Duke Fang of Tang studied under Li Babai and obtained his divine elixir. His entire household then ascended to heaven with their dwelling, even the dogs departing with them. Only the rats fell from the sky, their intestines spilling out, and for a month, they would replace their entrails thrice. To this day, the mountain below harbors "dragging-gut rats," which Minister Shu Guangwei called the "Tang rats."

*From* Forest of Records*: Guo Shu, styled Zhongshu, served as a *Zhouyi* Academician during the Guangshun era of the Later Zhou. Demoted to Registrar of Qian Prefecture, he left office upon completing his term and never returned to service, instead roaming freely among Qi, Yong, Jing, and Luo. He drank to excess, addressing all he met—noble or base—with the same casual speech. When he encountered scenic mountains or rivers, he would fast entirely, taking no food.

In the scorching heat of midsummer, his body remained free of sweat. In the depths of winter’s bitter cold, he would break the river ice to bathe, and the surrounding ice would melt. Later, he died suddenly and was buried by the roadside. When his grave was reopened for reburial, his coffin was found empty, as if he had shed his body like a cicada’s husk.

Zhao Xi saved Hui; Dong Feng revived Xie.
*True Reports*: Zhao Xi, during the Han dynasty, served as Inspector of Youzhou. He aided the poor and rescued Wang Hui and dozens of others from extermination by the river. His own person ascended to Crimson Mound, while his descendants all dwelled in grotto-heavens.
*Traditions of Divine Transcendents*: Dong Feng, styled Junyi, was in the south when Du Xie, the Inspector of Jiaozhou, died of a poisonous illness after three days. Feng arrived and placed three round pills into his mouth. After the time it takes to eat a meal, Xie opened his eyes, moved his limbs, and regained his former complexion. By midday, he could sit up, and thus his life was restored. When asked how this came to be, he said: "At first, I saw a red-robed clerk come to summon me, saying, ‘The True Lord Dong has commanded it.’ So I was sent back."

The Duke of Du’s temple image; the Prince of Cao’s hunt.
*Extensive Records*: When Du Naigong was young, he once went to Zhaoying County and played in the wild with other children. A Daoist called out to him alone, stroking his palm and saying, "Young master, apply yourself to study and do not play with these children." Pointing to a temple, he said, "I live here. Will you visit me?" After the Daoist left, Du went to the temple and found a dilapidated village shrine with only one hall still standing, housing an image of the Elder Lord. At first, the Daoist’s face had appeared half purple-black, but now, upon closer inspection, Du saw that it resembled the man he had met earlier—half his face had simply been darkened by rainwater.

*Records of Origins and Transformations*: When the Prince of Cao was demoted to Hengzhou, there was a mountain recluse named Zhang, a master of *yan* arts. The prince once went hunting and captured ten deer, but as the encirclement closed, the deer vanished without a trace. Summoning the mountain man, he asked what had happened. The man replied, "This is the work of a *yan* adept who concealed them." He then fetched water and performed a *yan* incantation. Soon, a Daoist appeared in the water, barely an inch tall, carrying a sack and staff. The prince asked the mountain man, "Can we pursue him?" "Yes," he replied. The prince ordered the pursuit, and the Daoist came, laughing. When asked where the deer were, he said, "I saw them die, so I pitied and concealed them. They are now by the mountainside." The prince sent men to look, and indeed, the deer were hidden by a small hill, motionless. The prince laughed and let them go.

The boy turned the boat; the old man carried the thorn-bush.
*Investigations into the Supernatural*: In the two caves of Gongshan, there was a well-like opening. At the end of the Xiantong era, a Daoist named Zheng descended over a hundred *zhang* by rope, where he saw a light. Following it, he found the path blocked by water, but across the divide grew flowers and trees, and two Daoists were playing chess. A boy poled a boat toward him and asked if he wished to cross. Zheng replied, "I must return." The boy turned the boat and left, and Zheng ascended by rope. The next day, the well’s mouth was sealed with stone, and no one has entered since.

*Records of Hidden Wonders*: Outside the Sword Gate, Hou Tong found four yellow stones, each the size of a *dou*, which turned to gold when he took them. With this wealth, he purchased over a hundred beautiful concubines, grand estates, and vast fertile fields. Suddenly, an old man carrying a thorn-bush approached and said, "I have come to collect your debt. Return my gold—do you not remember?" He took all of Hou’s possessions and cast them into the thorn-bush, which did not seem cramped. In an instant, the old man vanished. Years later, Hou saw the old man walking with a companion. When questioned, the old man only smiled and said nothing. When pressed, he vanished again.

Ziyang ate peach-bark; Tian Luan consumed cypress-leaves.
*True Reports*: Huang Ziyang of Wei was versed in the wonders of long life from youth. He entered Boluo Mountain to study the Dao for over ninety years, eating only peach bark and drinking yellow water from stone. Later, he met Sima Jizhu and thus attained transcendence.

*Extensive Records*: Tian Luan entered Mount Hua and encountered an extraordinary man who pointed to a cypress tree, saying, "This is the elixir of long life. Why seek it afar?" Luan returned home and consumed cypress leaves for several years, feeling his body grow lighter. One night, he dreamed of immortals holding tablets leading him into a grotto, where the assembled transcendents said, "The Cypress-Eating Immortal has arrived," and inscribed his name in gold characters on the Jade Register of the Upper Clarity. They told him, "For now, remain among men. When a position is available, you will be summoned." He then awoke.

Later, he concealed himself in Mount Songyang, retaining a youthful appearance at one hundred twenty-three years of age.

*The Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns, Scroll Ten*
Compiled by Orthodox Unity Daoist Chen Baoguang

Guo had no four walls; Liu endured two hardships.

*The Record of True Realms*: Guo, styled Wenju, once obtained the *Divine Tiger’s Inner Perfection Purple Prime Elixir Scripture* in a stone chamber on Mount Huayin. Amid the decline of the Jin dynasty, he carried thatch to Mount Dadi in Yuhang, where he felled trees and leaned them against the forest to fashion a shelter—without four walls. Clad in kudzu fiber and a deerskin cap, he cultivated beans and wheat, gathering bracken to barter for salt and fermented milk. Any surplus food he gave to the poor. In the Qianfu era, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Lingyao, and many traces of him remain in the mountains.

*The Records of Hidden Worthies of the Jin*: Liu Linzhi, styled Zijì, cherished simplicity and humility from youth, cultivating emptiness and few desires. He paid no heed to formal conduct, and none knew of him. Fond of wandering mountains and marshes, his heart was set on pursuing the reclusive. Once, while gathering herbs on Mount Heng, he ventured deep and forgot to return. He came upon a stream where, on its southern bank, stood two stone enclosures—one sealed, the other open—too deep and wide to cross. As he sought to turn back, he lost his way and, encountering a woodcutter, asked for the path, barely making it home. Some said the enclosures held immortals’ elixirs and all manner of wondrous things. Linzhi wished to search again but never found the place.

Xiaocheng tied his sash and naturally donned a silk headscarf.

*The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace*: Liang Chen, styled Xiaocheng, delighted in the Dao of immortals. At seventeen, he became a Daoist, observing fasts, reciting scriptures, and broadly performing meritorious deeds to relieve all manner of suffering. He trod lightly upon the earth, fearing to harm living things. When birds or beasts crossed his path, he would step aside to avoid them. He treated others with humble reverence, ever serene and empty. One day, he told his disciple Wang Zinian: “My good friends await me at the southern ford. I must go to them; you should know this.” He tied his sash and set out southward. Zinian followed, perceiving only dense clouds swirling, their mist veiling the forests and valleys. After a long while, Chen suddenly leapt into the air and soared upon the clouds, vanishing in an instant. Only the distant sound of flutes and drums lingered.

*The Primer of Our Dynasty*: Zhao Ziran, a native of Taiping Prefecture, dreamed of a man who presented him with a plain headscarf and robe. The man’s beard and hair were streaked with white, and he claimed the surname Yin. Leading Zhao up a mountain, he said: “You bear the qi of the Dao.” He taught him the method of avoiding grains and produced a sprig of green cypress, bidding him eat it. In the dream, Zhao consumed it, and upon waking, he no longer needed food.

The green-scarved fine guest, the white-robed old man.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals*: One day, Master Chen Xiyi said to his disciple Jia Sheng: “A fine guest will arrive today; go quickly and announce him.” Soon after, a man in a brown robe and green scarf appeared at the gate. Jia hurried to report, but the man had already departed. Jia pursued him and saw an old man clad in deerskin. He asked: “Has the old man ahead gone far?” The old man replied: “This is the divine immortal Li Babai—when he moves, it is eight hundred li.” Then the deerskin-clad old man vanished as well. The Master said: “That old man was Master Baibi of the Grand Clarity, who had attained the Dao. Now that he is gone, and the deerskin-clad one has also departed, I cannot remain long.” He then returned to the True.

*The Traditions of Emperor Wu of Han*: Emperor Wu journeyed to Mount Tai, where he encountered a white-robed old man whose ears rose to the top of his head, his hair hanging to his shoulders. A radiance several feet long crowned his head. The Emperor, astonished, questioned him. The old man said: “I have heard that on Qin Mountain grows a calamus, one *cun* long with nine nodes. Consuming it grants longevity.” Then he vanished. The Emperor said: “This was the spirit of the mountain.”

At that time, Wang Xing, having heard of this, consumed the calamus and attained immortality. One *dou* of Deng’s elixir, a thousand strands of myriad herbs.

*The Continued Biographies of Immortals*: Songyang in Chuzhou was the place where Celestial Master Zhang cultivated the True. Deng Qushe, admiring the retreat of those who came before, built a thatched hut to dwell in and practiced austerities day and night. To the south of the mountain stood a massive boulder, upon which he often sat. A divine person appeared and told him: “The Celestial Master’s cinnabar elixir and sword lie beneath this stone. You may retrieve them.” The Master said: “This stone was set by Heaven; no human effort can move it.” The divine person replied: “Persist in your cultivation without slackening, and the elixir and sword may yet be obtained.” The Master followed his words, and before three years had passed, the divine person presented him with one *dou* of elixir and one sword. Later, the Master administered the elixir to heal the sick, and upon achieving his work, ascended in broad daylight.

There was also the Old Man Who Sold Medicines, whose name was unknown. He always carried a large gourd to sell remedies. When people sought medicine for their ailments, he gave it to them whether they could pay or not, and it was invariably efficacious. Once, someone jokingly asked him: “Do you have the Great Return Elixir?” He replied: “I have one pill, but its price is a thousand bolts of silk.” Everyone laughed at him, thinking him mad. Later, in Chang’an, as he sold his medicines, he shook his gourd—it was already empty, save for a single pill resting in his palm. He sighed: “A hundred years of selling medicine, and not one person has bought it. How lamentable! Today, I shall take it myself.” The moment the pill entered his mouth, five-colored clouds arose beneath his feet, and he soared into the sky.

The Bronze Plaque Marked the Deer, the Golden Basin Concealed the Magpie.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: During Emperor Minghuang’s hunt in Xianyang, a great deer was captured. As the imperial kitchen prepared to butcher it, Zhang Guo petitioned: “This is a transcendent stag, already a thousand years old. In the fifth year of *Yuanshou* during Emperor Wu of Han’s reign, I once accompanied the hunt in Shanglin Park where this very deer was caught. It was released then, marked with a bronze plaque on its left antler.” The emperor ordered verification, and indeed, a bronze plaque of about two inches was found, though its inscriptions were worn and faint.

Another account tells of Xuanyuan Ji, whom Emperor Xuanzong once summoned to inquire whether longevity could be governed. Ji replied: “Sever sensual indulgence, moderate rich flavors, harmonize grief and joy as one, and bestow virtue without partiality. Thus, you will naturally align with Heaven and Earth in power, match the sun and moon in brilliance—even the Way of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang may be attained, let alone long life and enduring vision.” Upon his withdrawal, the emperor tested him by concealing a white magpie beneath a golden basin. As Ji rested in the palace quarters, he remarked to the eunuch: “How could the emperor again make this old man divine the hidden?” The eunuch did not grasp his meaning. The emperor promptly summoned him back. As Ji reached the jade steps, he declared: “The white magpie beneath the basin should be released.” The emperor laughed heartily.

Li Ming Refined the Elixir, Bozhen Gathered Herbs.

*The Records of Mount Mao* state: Li Ming, a high official who fled the world and refused office, secluded himself on Yugang Mountain in Juqu. There, he refined an elixir to completion and ascended to the Dark Capital, appointed to the rank of Grand Minister. To this day, his old altar and well remain.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* recount: Jiang Bozhen entered Meng Mountain to practice the Dao and search for herbs when he suddenly encountered an immortal. The immortal instructed Bozhen to stand upright at noon, but his shadow leaned askew. The immortal said: “You know the value of the Dao and devote yourself earnestly to its study, yet you do not realize that imbalance is a flaw. If you wish to correct your heart, always place your hands on your shoulders at sunrise, aligning the sun with your heart. When you feel warmth in your abdomen, your heart will be upright—practice this often for the best results.”

The Ge Clan’s Dragon-Silk Canopy, Nüwa’s Cloud Curtain.

*The Records of Marvelous Ancestors* tell of a woodcutter’s wife from Jiufi Mountain, née Ge, who fell ill for several days. Rising, she addressed her parents-in-law: “Not only has my illness abated, but I shall also attain transcendence.” Soon after, she departed through the door, riding a cloud away. Days later, she returned, describing the celestial palaces: “The towers and pavilions are carved from green jade, their windows and doors adorned with pearls and woven with dragon-silk curtains, their five hues shimmering in the luminous void. There, the incense of immortality burns without end.”

“I have come but briefly to see you.” Soon, a five-colored chariot arrived, drawn by two dragons and driven by mighty warriors, with maidens attending. The woman mounted it and drifted slowly away.

*The Beginnings of Things* states: The Lady of Nüwa crafted cloud curtains and refined the five-colored stones to mend the heavens.

Liu An’s chickens and dogs, Jing Zhi’s tortoises and cranes.

*The Continuation of the Biographies of Transcendents* records: Liu An was the grandson of Emperor Gaozu of Han. Fond of divine transcendence, he refined the Great Elixir, and once it was complete, he departed. At the time, people spread the tale: when Liu An was about to leave, there remained some elixir in a vessel, which he placed in the courtyard. Chickens and dogs licked and pecked at it, and all ascended to heaven. Thus, it is said: “Cocks crow in the heavens, dogs bark amid the clouds.”

*The Biographies of the Transcendents* tells of Xiao Jing Zhi, who fasted to study the Dao. One day, he dug in the earth and found something resembling a human hand, which he ate at once. He encountered a stranger who told him: “You have ingested the numinous medicine of transcendents. What you ate was *rouzhi*—the Fleshly Mushroom. Those who consume it attain a lifespan equal to tortoises and cranes. You should withdraw into the mountains to await the Supreme Dao.” Thereupon, he vanished into seclusion.

De Xiu’s thunderclaps, Wang Xing’s cloud chariots.

*The Traditions of Divine Transcendents* records: Cao De Xiu claimed to have come from Green Islet Mountain in the Eastern Sea, traveling through Jiangxi. For over thirty years, those who saw him found his appearance unchanged. The sick who sought his talismanic remedies were all cured without exception. There was a maiden of twenty who was betrothed when suddenly she fell prey to a malevolent spirit; every treatment only worsened her condition. Her father visited De Xiu and described her illness in full. De Xiu said: “Your home lies near a mountain stream with a deep pool. In spring, your daughter strolled by the brook and was espied by a flood-dragon, which seized her essence and spirit, drawing them into its cavern. Take this talisman and cast it into the pool—soon you will see proof.” After the talisman was thrown, the waters suddenly churned and roared with thunderous echoes. Presently, a creature over twenty feet long surfaced, its form like a black serpent, its head as large as a great ladle—already cloven dead. The maiden’s illness was cured forthwith.

*The Divine Transcendents of the Wang Clan* tells of Wang Xing, a man of Shu who once served as magistrate of Pujiang. Enamored of the numinous peaks in his jurisdiction, he resigned his post and withdrew into the mountains for nine years. One day, he saw within a grotto blossoms of jade unfurling and golden toads leaping. Entering, he found an elixir of transcendence, which he consumed. Immediately, he ascended in a cloud chariot. To this day, the grotto is called “Magistrate’s Governance,” marking the origin of the name.

Floating Beard and White Leopard, Thunder Duke and Yellow Serpent.
*The Traditions of Divine Transcendents* recounts: The Perfected Master Shi Cun, styled Master Floating Beard, studied under Master Yellow Reed and obtained *The Esoteric Writ of the Three Sovereigns*, a scripture for commanding tigers and leopards. He concealed himself in Stone Chamber Mountain of Mount Heng, riding a white leopard whenever he ventured forth. In the *Yuan Kang* era of the Jin, he ascended in broad daylight.

*The Extensive Records of the Strange* states: Wu Sheng Zhi once saw the Thunder Duke pursuing a yellow serpent along a riverbank. Casting a stone at it, he heard a resonant clang. The Thunder Duke flew away, leaving behind a bronze sword inscribed: “Third Flood-Dragon-Slaying Sword of the Perfected Lord Xu Jing Yang.”

Unrivaled and the Gift of Fruit, Sun Zhong and the Offering of Melons.
*The Green Jade Pendant* relates: Li Wu Jing traveled to the capital to seek office. At Zhuqian Garrison, he encountered beggars quarreling on the road. An old woman said: “I spent my life begging to gather this small sum, yet this man borrowed it and never repaid.” Wu Jing took out the exact amount and gave it to the beggar, who thanked him: “I truly owed him the money. You, a stranger passing by, not only repaid it but also resolved our dispute. How can I repay your virtue? My home is in Longhe—look for the green curtain at Bamboo Fence Alley. Will you visit?” Wu Jing found this strange and went at once. Entering the door, he saw several beggars huddled around a fire, their faces brightening at his arrival. They invited him to sit and poured a modest drink. Wu Jing remained suspicious and did not drink, merely wetting his lips. Though it was bitter winter, the platter held summer fruits. He took three small imperial peaches and tucked them into his sleeve to bring home. The beggar sent him off with a poem:
*“The gentleman’s many doubts breed many errors,*
*The world’s lack of faith breeds no sincerity.*
*My home’s path is smooth as whetstone—*
*Why would you, sir, refuse to walk it?”*
When Wu Jing returned to his lodging and examined the peaches, they were made of purple gold. Later, he had them carved into wine vessels. At seventy, his complexion remained rosy—could this be the power of merely wetting his lips with that wine?

*The Records of the Netherworld* tells: In his youth, Sun Zhong was poor. When his melons ripened, three men came to beg for them. Zhong offered them melons, saying: “We are the Lords of Destiny.” Then they transformed into white cranes and flew away.

Hanging Frost of Lingyang, Flowing Rosy Clouds of Manqing.

*The Accounts of Immortals* states: Lingyang Zichun consumed morning radiance and summer *hangdan*. These are the profound yellow qi of heaven and earth at midnight; when the rosy clouds first emerge, the blue-yellow qi is the morning radiance.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* records: Xiang Manqing, a native of Puji in Hedong, entered the mountains to cultivate the Dao. One day, an immortal came to welcome him and took him to the heavens, where he beheld the Purple Palace, Golden Grove, and jade tables. The immortal offered him a cup of *liuxia*, and thereafter he knew neither hunger nor thirst. Suddenly longing for home, he was reprimanded by the Celestial Emperor and sent back to Hedong, where he was called the "Banished Immortal."

Purple Clouds of Minghuang, Crimson Snow of Yuanyuan.
*The Records of the Xuan Chamber* tells: Emperor Minghuang of Tang dreamed of over ten immortals descending upon rosy clouds, arrayed in his courtyard, each holding musical instruments and playing them. Their melodies were so clear and transcendent they seemed not of this world. When the music ceased, one immortal stepped forward and said: "Does Your Majesty recognize this music? It is the immortal tune *Purple Clouds*, which I now transmit to you as the true beginning of Tang’s imperial sound." Minghuang was overjoyed and immediately had it taught. Upon waking, he played it on his jade flute, mastering its rhythms entirely.

*The Supplement to Immortal Biographies* records: Shen Yuanzhi, of unknown origin, was summoned to the Shangdu Kaiyuan Temple during the Kaiyuan era, where the emperor’s favor grew ever deeper. Minghuang would discuss the Dao with him for hours on end. Once, he ordered Lady Zhao Yunrong to attend Yuanzhi with tea and medicine, treating him with utmost reverence. During a private moment, she begged for a small dose of his elixir to prolong her life. Yuanzhi replied: "I have nothing to withhold, but your time in this world is short." When she pressed him further, he gave her a single pellet of *Crimson Snow* and said: "Even in death, this elixir will preserve your body. Only ensure your coffin is large, your tomb spacious, your mouth filled with pearls and jade, and your grave well-ventilated. Then your soul will not drift into emptiness, nor your spirit sink into darkness, and after a hundred years, you may revive. This is the Way of Refining Form in the Great Yin." Later, Yunrong accompanied the emperor to the eastern capital and fell ill at the Orchid Palace. She recounted this to the Noble Consort as he had foretold.

Daoyuan Observes Lanterns, Zhiwei Gazes at the Moon.
*The Supplement to Immortal Biographies* records: The Heavenly Master Ye Fashan, styled Daoyuan, during the Kaiyuan era’s first full moon night, accompanied Minghuang as he moved his retinue to the Shangyang Palace to view the lanterns. The court artisan Mao Shunxin had constructed over thirty resplendent pavilions, adorned with gold, kingfisher feathers, pearls, and jade, towering one hundred and fifty feet high. The slightest breeze set them chiming in harmony. Lanterns shaped like dragons, phoenixes, leopards, and unicorns seemed to leap and bound, defying human craft. The emperor was delighted, but the master said: "Though these lanterns are unmatched, those in the western capital tonight are equally splendid. I have just come from there." The emperor, astonished, asked: "If I wished to go there now, could it be done?" The master replied: "It is simple." He then instructed the emperor to close his eyes. In an instant, they arrived. After admiring the spectacle for some time, the emperor asked to return. Again, he closed his eyes, and in a moment, they were back beneath the pavilion—yet the songs and dances had not yet ended. Later, in Binzhou, the emperor pierced a wine cup with an iron ruyi. The next day, he sent a eunuch on a pretext to retrieve it, confirming the tale was no lie.

*The Minor Records of Sanshui* tells: The Daoist Zhao Zhiwei had attained the Way. One Mid-Autumn, as overcast skies persisted, the crowd lamented the ruined festival. Zhiwei said: "Prepare wine and delicacies, and let us ascend Tianzhu Peak to admire the moon." As they stepped outside, the sky cleared. Upon reaching the summit, the moon shone as bright as day. They descended only at moonset, but upon returning to the mountain’s base, they found the same bitter wind, rain, and gloom as before.

Lie Yukou’s Heart Split Open, the Dao Lord’s Tongue Cut.
*The Cloudy Han Anecdotes* records: The tomb of Lie Yukou lies in the outskirts of Zheng. A Hu man, poor in his youth, worked as a tinker and washer, earning the nickname "Hu the Tinker." Whenever he had fine wine, tea, or fruit, he would offer them at Yukou’s shrine, praying for wisdom. One night, he dreamed a man slit his belly with a knife and placed a scroll within his heart. Upon waking, he could compose poetry. Once, he presented a poem to Magistrate Han, which read:
*"Suddenly hearing Mei Fu come to call,*
*Laughing, he dons his lotus robe and steps from his thatched hall.*
*The children, unused to carriages and horses,*
*Scramble to hide deep in the reeds."*

*The Extensive Records of Marvels* tells: In Kuizhou, there was a Daoist named Wang Hongming whose tongue was so long he could not pronounce words clearly. He said: "I recite the *Dao De Jing*." One night, he dreamed the Dao Lord trimmed his tongue. Upon waking, his speech was flawless.

The Ash Bag Feigns Madness, Ma Nuo Stands Peerless.
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: In Shu, there was a Daoist who feigned madness and was commonly called the "Ash Bag," a disciple of Heavenly Master Zhai. Zhai often warned his followers not to underestimate this man, saying: "I am not his equal." Once, in the midst of a heavy snowfall, the Ash Bag, clad in hempen robes, entered Mount Qingcheng. At dusk, he sought lodging at a monastery, but the monk said: "This poor monk has only one robe—how can I accommodate you in such cold?" The Ash Bag replied: "One robe is enough." At midnight, the wind and snow grew fiercer. Fearing he had frozen to death, the monk went to check and found him several feet from his robe, his body steaming like a steamer, sweat pouring as he slept uncovered. Before dawn, he left without a word. Once, he suffered from mouth sores for months, appearing on the verge of death. The villagers, who revered him as a deity, prepared a vegetarian feast. After the meal, he suddenly said to the crowd: "Look inside my mouth—what do you see?" He opened his mouth wide as a winnowing basket, revealing all five organs. The onlookers were stunned. Later, no one knew his fate.

*The Unofficial History of Jin* records: Ma Nuo’s real name is unknown. During Shi Jilong’s reign in Wei, he begged in the streets, always wearing coarse hempen clothes—hence the people called him "Ma Nuo." His words were extraordinary, his manner like a madman’s. When he received rice or grain, he would scatter it rather than eat. He displayed many divine marvels and was a close friend of the eminent monk Fotucheng.

Su’s Donkey Worms Flow, Wang’s Corpse Springs a Fountain.
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Ji Zixun once rode a donkey cart with several scholars to Xuzhou. Passing through Rongyang, they stopped at an inn. Suddenly, the donkey he was driving collapsed and died, maggots streaming from its body. The innkeeper rushed to inform him, but Zixun merely said: "So it is."

As he sat calmly finishing his meal, he slowly took out his staff and tapped the donkey. At the sound, the beast sprang up, walking as before.

*The Teahouse Guest’s Tales* records: There was a man called Wang the Wanderer, whose name and hometown are lost. He would carry a bamboo pole with a basket, leading a brindled dog as he went about knocking on doors in Yingzhou, seeking herbs. In the year *Tianxi wuwu* (1018), he traveled to Mount Qingcheng and returned to Yingzhou. The magistrate, Shi Zhongran, summoned him for conversation. Wang said: "I am a rustic, long dwelling in the city, and now I yearn to return home. I have a request to entrust to you." The magistrate did not understand his meaning. One day, Wang shouldered a load of thatch and went alone to Guoning Temple, where he sat down at the temple gate and died. The village elders, hearing the news, prepared a bier by the roadside. When Magistrate Shi learned of it, he said: "This must be what he meant before." He sent an officer to cremate the body, but when they opened the coffin, his face appeared as in life, his limbs soft, as if in deep slumber. Soon, a clear spring welled up beneath the corpse, lifting it to the surface. They then dressed him in fresh clothes, bathed him, and prepared him for burial.

Fang Yuanbian’s eloquence, Dao Hua’s dullness.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Wen Qiu Fangyuan, styled Dafang, was precociously intelligent from childhood and well-versed in the classics and histories. Emperor Zhaozong repeatedly summoned him, but he declined, accepting only the imperial bestowal of robes and the title *Xuantong Xiansheng* ("Master of Mystic Unity"). When Luo Yin visited to receive teachings, the Master would close his eyes and instruct him, saying: "Yin, your talent is high but your insight is shallow—you must compose yourself to awaken to things." Thus, Luo Yin ultimately preserved his well-being until the end. One day, the Master suddenly bathed, burned incense, sat upright, and returned to the True. His complexion remained unchanged, and an extraordinary fragrance lingered for three days. At the time, Qian Wusu dreamed of the Master riding a crane to bid farewell. The next day, news of his passing arrived. When they opened his tomb, only an empty coffin remained.

Another figure, Hou Daohua, often behaved like a madman, and many mocked him, yet he never showed anger. He loved reading alchemical classics, histories, and philosophical texts. When asked why he recited such works, he replied: "There are no dull-witted immortals in heaven." The ruins of Yang Xiong’s grave, the righteous burial of Zhou Chang.

*Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* records: Yang Xiong, styled Ziyun, was a stammerer but excelled in composition. When Wang Mang usurped the throne, Yang heard that an official in charge of trials was coming to arrest him. Fearing he could not escape, he was then collating texts in the Tianlu Pavilion. He threw himself from the railing and died. In the *Tianfeng* era (14–19 CE), he returned to Shu due to illness and died at home. During the *Qianfu* era (874–879), the scholar Zhao Yu fell ill while traveling in Jiazhou and rested at the Kaiyuan Temple. As he recovered, he saw in the temple hall a young man in tattered clothes, his umbrella worn and patched, yet his appearance spotless. The youth sat beside Zhao, who remarked: "This temple’s grand construction must have required immense state resources—why is there a ruined grave pressed so close behind the hall? I once asked the locals, but none knew." The youth smiled and said: "This is the grave of a descendant of the Marquis of Liu, grandson of Piqiang, and ancestor of the Celestial Master. He served as Prefect of Nan’an, died in office, and was buried here." He then recounted events from the two Han dynasties, Wei, and Jin as if he had witnessed them firsthand. When Zhao asked his name, he replied: "I am Ziyun, surnamed Yang." Zhao tried to follow him, but the youth strode out the gate and vanished. To this day, people occasionally claim to see him.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Zhou Chang diligently practiced sudden virtue, his merit no less than that of the enlightened. In a year of severe drought, tens of thousands perished as travelers, yet Chang gathered over ten thousand skeletons, establishing a public burial ground. When he made seasonal offerings, timely rains would fall. Now he serves in the Grotto as Attendant of the Radiant Dawn, where natural thunder resounds and ritual music is embraced by rosy clouds.

*The Seven Lots from the Cloudy Thatch* states: Ma Xiang, styled Ziran, bore the appearance of a madman yet could cure illness. When someone sought his aid, Xiang used no medicine—only striking the afflicted area with his bamboo staff or pointing at it. Blowing on the staff’s tip produced a thunderous roar, and the ailment would vanish. Often wandering through temples, grottoes, and cliffs, he left behind many poems. One, inscribed upon ascending Hangzhou’s Mount Qinwang, reads:
*Where to seek the Great One at the dawn of division?*
*Only the reckoning remains, shifting mortal hearts.*
*Sun and moon of the Nine Heavens alter dawn and dusk;*
*Rivers and mountains of ten thousand li transform past and present.*
*Wind stirs the water’s light, veiling distant charms;*
*Rain swells the mountain mist, drowning towering forests.*
*Qin’s First Emperor devised his Mount Li scheme—*
*Yet the boundless rivers and seas grow ever deeper.*

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* recounts: The Daoist Zhang Fale dwelled west of Geng Valley, embracing the Origin and guarding the One for over thirty years. Clouds arose from his roof beams, and rosy clouds enfolded his windows—he named his abode Cloud Dwelling Temple. After long cultivation, his Way was perfected, and fierce tigers submitted to serve at his side. Later, he achieved liberation through the corpse, shedding his form like a cicada.

Li Yu consumed jade, Wang Jie refined gold.

*The Record of Responses and Retributions* tells: During the Later Wei, Li Yu obtained an ancient method for nurturing jade. He journeyed to Lantian, personally overseeing the mining, and unearthed over a hundred pieces resembling rings, discs, and various vessels. Yu then pulverized seventy of them into powder and ingested it. When gravely ill, he told his wife: "When I die, my body will surely show something extraordinary. Do not hasten the burial, that later generations may know the wonders of jade-nourishment." It was mid-Seventh Month, and Chang’an sweltered with deadly heat. Yu’s body lay unburied for four nights, yet his complexion remained unchanged. His wife, née Chang, placed two jade beads in his mouth, but it stayed shut. She said: "You claimed jade-nourishment held divine efficacy—why not accept the beads?" At her words, his mouth opened to receive them, and he exhaled.

The body emitted no foul qi. When lifted for enshrouding, the corpse did not slump or collapse.

*The Yan Tan of Mianshui* records: Wang Jie of Jiangzhou, in his youth, traded along the Jiang and Huai rivers. During the Xianping era, he encountered a man at an inn in Nankang dressed in Daoist robes, whose bearing was most imposing. The man bestowed upon Wang a method for transmuting yellow gold and entrusted him with a divine sword, cautioning, "Do not recklessly reveal this unless you meet a true sovereign." Later, Wang feigned madness, shouting in the markets of Shangrao, and was exiled to Lingnan. He escaped and returned to the capital, striking the *Dengwen* drum to petition the throne. Emperor Zhenzong of Song summoned him for an audience and, pleased, renamed him Zhongzheng. Lodging at the home of the eunuch Liu Chenggui, it was often heard that Zhongzheng spoke with others in a voice like a child’s, saying, "I am the Lord of Life. I have silently offered alchemical gold and silver to aid the state." The world called him "Master Wang the Gold-Burner."

He divined for the singing girl; Qiu Fu healed with ghostly needles.

*The History of the Southern Dynasties* states: He Chang, styled Bozu, was skilled in Daoist cultivation and the arts of divination. Once, he encountered a singing girl who had died, and upon casting her hexagrams, declared, "This is no death—she has been summoned by the Celestial Emperor to sing." He placed a clod of earth upon her heart, and after a moment, she revived.

*The Record of Responses* records: Xu Wenbo of Song, a native of Donghai, was the great-grandson of Pu Yang’s governor, Xi. Fond of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, he lived in reclusion on Mount Qinwang when a Daoist passed by seeking drink. The Daoist left behind a gourd ladle, saying, "Your descendants should guard the world with the Dao and will attain the rank of *ershishi*." When Xi opened it, he found a scroll of Bian Que’s *Mirror Classic*. He studied it diligently and became renowned throughout the land. Later, Qiu Fu further refined his methods, rising to the post of magistrate of Sheyang. One night, he heard a ghost’s piteous groans and asked who it was. The ghost replied, "I am a man of Dongyang who died of lumbar pain. Even as a ghost, the suffering is unbearable—pray, cure me." Qiu Fu asked, "How should I proceed?" The ghost said, "Fashion a straw figure and press the points with needles." Qiu Fu followed his instructions, applying moxibustion and acupuncture, then offered sacrifices and buried the effigy. The next day, a man appeared to express his gratitude before vanishing. The world marveled at his communion with spirits.

Lu Du measured the deer’s steps; Gui Nian distinguished the birds’ cries.

*The Xianji Collection* records: Lu Du, a master of Daoist arts, vowed in his youth while stranded by the Huai River, "If I escape death, I shall never kill a living thing again." Suddenly, two creatures appeared, swimming against the current to ferry him across. Later, he dwelled in reclusion on Three-Visits Mountain in Xichang, Luling. Birds and beasts followed him, and one night, a deer rammed his wall. Lu said, "You’ve damaged my wall." The deer responded at once and left. Before his house lay a pond where he kept fish, which he called by name—they came in turn to drink and eat before departing.

*The Hanlin Repository of Renowned Discourse* records: Bai Guinian, grandson of Bai Juyi, once encountered Li Taibai on Mount Song. Taibai beckoned him and said, "Since my release from the waters, I have wandered freely among mountains and rivers. Longing for my homeland, I returned west to the peaks of Song. The Celestial Emperor submitted a memorial on my behalf, and I was summoned to oversee the celestial archives—here I have remained for a hundred years. Recently, passing through Tong Pass, I composed a lyric:

*Once feasted in Peach Blossom Spring’s deep grotto,
A song of phoenix dance and simurgh’s flight—
Still I recall the moment of parting,
As the bright moon fell, flowers thick with mist,
Like a dream, like a dream,
Tearfully seeing me out the door.*

Then he produced a scroll and bestowed it upon Guinian, saying, 'Study this, and you may discern the speech of birds and beasts between heaven and earth. Cultivate further hidden virtue, and you may become an earthbound immortal.' Crane-like, Guinian stretched forth his neck; the old man steadied his heart.

*The Extensive Records of Marvels* states: During the Tianxi era, Guo Shangdian worked as a laborer at the Zhou Bridge in the Eastern Capital, washing vessels in a teahouse. A man in a blue headscarf and hempen robe, his bearing majestic, appeared—Guo suspected him to be the transcendent Lü. He rushed forward and prostrated himself, saying, 'To meet you, Master, I would gladly serve as your lowliest attendant.' The master replied, 'If you truly wish to follow me, receive my sword.' Guo assented eagerly, craning his neck in anticipation. The master drew his blade to strike, but Guo cried out—and the master vanished. Later, Guo underwent *shijie* (corpse-liberation); when his coffin was opened, only tattered rags remained.

*The Extensive Records* further notes: At the end of the Tang, an old man carried a gourd to sell medicine in Yizhou. Whatever coins he earned, he distributed to the poor, often saying, 'If one wishes others to be free of illness, one must first rectify the heart. Without chaotic desires, reckless thoughts, cravings, or delusions, the heart remains sound—and though the six internal organs may ail, they are not difficult to heal.' This was the old man’s constant admonition. One day, he bathed in the Jin River, reached into his bag, took a cinnabar pill, and swallowed it. Then he transformed into a white crane and flew away.

The Golden Palace Emperor Lord and the Jade Immortal Holy Mother.

*The Pearl Bag of the Three Caverns* states: The Golden Palace Emperor Lord’s chief minister, the Azure Youth, rides a jade-green aurora, ninefold clouds streaming beneath his feathered canopy, ascending to the Supreme Numinous Capital to present the celestial registers of the Three Heavens.

*The Transmission of the Jade Immortal* records: The Holy Mother was born in the era of the Flame Emperor. Tracing her origins, she hailed from Wuyang Prefecture. Possessing unparalleled beauty, her parents betrothed her to a family of Langye. Hearing a neighbor say, 'The Langye clan are bewitching men,' she wept and refused the match. Boarding a small boat, she drifted freely upon the great river, letting the wind carry her where it would. She arrived at Immortal Capital Mountain, located within the kingdom of Koryo. Atop the mountain stood Jade Immortal Peak; within it lay Jade Immortal Grotto; below flowed Jade Immortal Stream. The Holy Mother moored there, steadfast in resolve and unyielding in virtue. Half a year later, she encountered the Holy Mother of the Flower Maidens, who orally transmitted to her the Dao of flying spirits into the crucible, the method of governing the central source’s spirits, and the art of nurturing the spirit with elixir fire. Having mastered these, she attained the Dao. The title 'Jade Immortal' was bestowed upon her in honor of the mountain and grotto. Before the Jade Immortal Shrine lies a square pond, where water from the Jade Immortal Stream is stored. Later generations cast paper into it to divine fortune or misfortune.

Zhang Zhong’s carriage of peace; Dong Jing’s walled hermitage.

*The Unofficial History of Jin* records: The Daoist Zhang Zhong, at the beginning of the Yongjia era, secluded himself on Mount Tai. He ingested *qi* and ate lingzhi, dwelling in an earthen cavern, his disciples likewise living in dugouts. His teachings relied on embodiment, not words. Though the court repeatedly summoned him, he declined all gifts. The emperor said, 'Would you deign to serve as the Grand Tutor?' Zhang replied, 'Once I fled the world to sing with birds and beasts. Now, with age, my strength wanes, and I am unfit to render service. I beg to return to my old mountain.' The emperor granted his request and sent him back in a carriage of peace. He was posthumously titled Master of Peaceful Dao.

Moreover, Dong Jing would often come to Luoyang, wandering with unbound hair, chanting and singing at leisure. He once lodged within a shrine, begged in the marketplace, and wove a net to cover himself. If given anything, he would refuse gold or silk. At one time, the prefect approached the shrine and said to him, "Now is an age of Yao and Shun—why do you, who hold the Dao, wander lost in the realm of men?" He replied, "All things are base; only man is noble. In motion, the Nine Provinces seem too narrow; in stillness, a walled hut is vast enough." Then he vanished, and none knew his whereabouts.

Chongsu refined his essence; Daoquan endured hardship.

*The Record of True Realms* states: The Hall of Refined Thought was the dwelling of Master Chongsu, Zheng Yuanzhang. The master would fast and sit upright, allowing not even the slightest distraction—just as the *Nanhua* says, "When the mind is undivided, it congeals into spirit." Thus he moved the immortals of heaven, who would descend with lingzhi and plow the fields on evenings when clouds dispersed and the moon shone clear. Only his disciples within the inner chambers could hear his discourses; the world never did. The Hall of Refined Thought stood within the Dongxiao Palace in Hangzhou.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: The Perfected One Yin Daoquan secluded himself on Mount Heng, where an Upper Perfected descended and said to him, "Those who ascend in broad daylight must possess both the talent and the fulfillment of the Dao. You have received one part of this and thus hold the hope of soaring aloft—this is what your toil has earned, and what your past life ordained." Thereupon he bestowed upon him the *Chart of the True Forms of the Five Peaks*. Taking the mountains’ orientations, the sources of their springs, and the locations of their hidden metals and treasures, he wove them into a single chart and declared, "If you cultivate yourself and attain resonance, you will know that the descendants of Wen Shi and the lineage of Taihe have ever produced divine immortals." With these words, he departed. Daoquan ascended in the Yongjia era of the Jin.

A poor scholar embraced a dragon; Zhichuan expelled tigers.

*The Idle Tales of Rustics* recounts: At Baisha stood the Temple of Lord Qin Shan. Each spring in the third month, the people of Shu would gather there to plow. One day, a man in tattered robes, his face gaunt, also came to the deserted site. The crowd scorned him. As he walked along the riverbank, he sat upon a rock and remarked to those nearby, "There is a sleeping dragon in these waters." No one heeded him. He then stripped off his clothes and entered the water, emerging with a dragon in his arms. The stench was foul, its eyes tightly shut, yet claws, teeth, scales, and horns were all complete. Clouds swirled, winds rose, and waters surged—all fled in terror, and the poor scholar vanished in an instant.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan, once tended cattle. When tigers repeatedly threatened them, he inscribed talismans and performed an exorcism. A man appeared, calling himself the Lord of High Mountain, and said to Hong, "The harm of tigers and wolves shall now be eradicated."

Chen Baoguang of the Orthodox Unity Dao, compiler.

*Idle Tales of Rustics* records: Minister Wang Chuhui was generous in receiving scholars of humble origins. One day, a Daoist inscribed upon a bamboo leaf in large characters: "Daoist Zhu Taozhi respectfully requests an audience." The minister received him, offered wine with ease, and their discourse flowed with grace and dignity. Chuhui said, "I have long cherished the Dao and wished to build a Daoist abbey on Mount Qingcheng to pursue tranquility." The Daoist replied, "Not yet." He then took two seeds from his pouch, planted them, and covered them with a basin. After a moment, he lifted the basin to reveal flowers already grown, instantly reaching four or five feet in height, blooming in layers. The Daoist said, "This is the immortal’s banner-flower." Later, the minister indeed established his authority in two commanderies.

*Extensive Records* states: Xie Yuanqing encountered an immortal who showed him a branch with cinnabar stalks and jade leaves, its gentle breeze producing harmonious notes like the five tones—this was the *langxu* wood.

The charcoal-woman of Xu Xun, the wooden immortal of Lu Ban.
*The Records of West Mountain* recounts: Xu the Perfected Lord Xun had several hundred disciples. One day, wishing to test them, he transformed charcoal into a woman and sent her among his students. Only ten remained unstained by her allure—these were the very ones who later ascended as perfected lords. Today, the Charcoal-Woman Market and Charcoal-Woman Lane remain within Jianchang County.

*Miscellany of Youyang* records: Lu Ban, a man of Dunhuang whose era is unknown, possessed craftsmanship rivaling creation itself. In Bingzhou, he built a floating pagoda and fashioned a wooden kite. Each time he struck the wedge thrice, he would mount it and return home. Before long, his wife conceived, and her parents questioned her. She explained the circumstances. Later, her father obtained the kite, struck the wedge over ten times, and flew to Wu. The people of Wu deemed it sorcery and killed him. Lu Ban then crafted another wooden kite, retrieved his father’s corpse, and, resenting the Wu people for his father’s death, carved a wooden immortal south of Suzhou City. The figure raised its hand, pointing southeast, and Wu suffered a great drought for three years. When they learned it was Lu Ban’s doing, they prepared offerings and oxen to apologize. Lu Ban severed the statue’s hands, and that month, Wu was drenched in rain. In the early years of the state, the people of Wu still prayed to the wooden immortal.

The precious casket of Fa Shan, the jade coffin of Wang Qiao.
*Collected Accounts of the Strange* states: Ye Fashan, styled Daoyuan, once cultivated his spirit and refined the Dao on West Mountain in Hongzhou. One day, three divine beings from Kuocang descended, transmitting the Supreme Lord’s decree: "You shall assist our Emperor Ruizong and the sagely Emperor of Kaiyuan; you must not conceal yourself among the mountains and crags, neglecting your appointed duty." With that, they departed. At the time, neither emperor had yet ascended, yet their temple names and reign titles were already foretold. Later, he was indeed summoned to the capital.

Later, he aided in the pacification of Empress Wei and the enthronement of Prince Xiang as Emperor Ruizong. When Emperor Minghuang succeeded to the throne, Master Ye served beside these sagely rulers in the capital, foretelling and reporting every omen of fortune or misfortune, every shift in affairs. Once, Tubo envoys presented a treasure, its casket sealed with the words: *"Let Your Majesty open it personally; let no other know the secret."* The court fell silent, but Ye Fashan declared: *"This is an ill-omened casket—let the Tubo envoy open it himself."* The emperor followed his counsel. When the envoy did so, a crossbow bolt sprang from the casket, striking him dead—just as Fashan had foretold.

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* records: Wang Qiao, magistrate of Ye County during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Later Han, one day beheld a jade coffin descending from heaven. He said: *"Does the Heavenly Emperor summon me?"* He bathed, entered the coffin, and was buried east of the city, where the earth formed his tomb of its own accord. That night, the cattle and horses of the county sweated and panted in exhaustion, though none knew the cause. Later, the people built a shrine to him, called the Temple of Lord Ye.

The numinous phoenix of the Queen Mother of the West; the radiant wife, Caihuan.

*The Biographies of Recluses of the Tang* states: The Daoist Wang Yuanzhi was the son of Tan Xuan, Prefect of Yangzhou during the Liang. His mother, Lady Ding, once dozed at midday and dreamed of a divine phoenix alighting upon her body, whereupon she conceived. She also heard a child’s wail from within her womb. The monk Baoji said to Tan Xuan: *"The child you bear shall become the patriarch of divine immortals."* When Emperor Yang was still Prince of Jin, he dispatched envoys to summon Yuanzhi. Upon their meeting, Yuanzhi’s beard and hair turned white in an instant, and the prince, alarmed, sent him away.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* records: Wen Xiao lodged at the Abbey of the Perfected Lord Xu in Hongzhou. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month—the day of the Perfected Lord’s ascension—men and women gathered in throngs, linking sleeves to dance and sing in fulfillment of vows. Suddenly, Wen noticed a courtesan whose song subtly wove his name and hers into verses of divine immortality:
*"If you would accompany me to Lu’s immortal altar,
Then Wen Xiao shall ride the radiant Caihuan.
With embroidered robes and beaded curtains at our disposal,
The jade terrace shall fear no frost or snow."*
Struck by her words, Wen followed her after the song into a grove of towering pines. There, her dwelling was solemn and grand, attended by guards in formation, with desks and ledgers like those of an official bureau. Some records pertained to judgments, many concerning those drowned in rivers and lakes. Wen pressed her repeatedly for answers, until she said: *"This must not be lightly revealed—I would bring calamity upon you."* Soon after, a messenger in yellow robes arrived, declaring: *"For privately revealing heavenly secrets to satisfy desire, Wu Caihuan is demoted to a mortal’s wife for twelve years."* She then returned with Wen to their humble home in Jinling. Later, they rode a tiger together into Yuewang Mountain, and none knew their fate thereafter.

Liu Zhao’s azure radiance; Mu Jing’s lament at Yellow Bamboo.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* states: Liu Xiang, at the end of Emperor Cheng’s reign, was collating books in the Tianlu Pavilion when an old man in yellow robes, leaning on a staff of green bamboo, knocked at the door and entered. Asked his name, he replied: *"I am the essence of the Great One. The Heavenly Emperor has heard that the descendant of Metal (Liu) possesses vast learning and has descended to observe you."* He then produced a scroll from his breast—containing books of celestial charts and terrestrial maps—and bestowed it upon Liu before departing.

*The Chronicle of King Mu* records: The Son of Heaven journeyed south to Yellow Terrace Hill to view the hunting grounds of Xia Qi in the level marshes. A bitter cold brought rain and snow, and he composed three verses to mourn his people:
*"My ancestor at Yellow Bamboo,
Mouths round and shivering with cold.
The Emperor tends the nine paths,
Lamenting my dukes and ministers,
The hundred lords and chief ministers—
Exhorting my myriad people:
Day and night, forget not!"*

The bright pouch of Red Pine; the *White Cloud Register of Immortals*.

*The Records of Qi Xie* states: Deng Shao entered Mount Hua on the first day of the eighth month and saw a youth holding a five-colored pouch, collecting dew from mulberry leaves. The youth said: *"Master Red Pine takes this to brighten his eyes."* This is the origin of the "bright pouch" made on the eighth day of the eighth month.

*The Biographies of Immortals* records: Liu Baiyun of Jiangdu was a man of abundant hidden virtue. He encountered Yue Zichang, who said to him: *"You possess the celestial register of immortality and the bones of one destined for transcendence—why do you wander in the dust of the mortal world?"* He then bestowed upon Liu the *Register* and instructed him: *"First master transformation, then you may receive the Dao."* Liu followed his teachings, achieving myriad transformations and traveling seven hundred *li* in a day. When he met Yue Zichang again, he ingested the elixir for a thousand days and ascended to immortality.

Hou Kai’s dust-bound sameness; Youqi’s blending with the common.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* states: Hou Kai, styled Faxian, at fourteen became a disciple of Master Zheng Yi. The master said: *"If you bind your heart and steel your resolve, unwavering in the Dao, you shall not easily attain it unless you dwell in mountain seclusion."* Hou replied: *"The Dao resides in the square inch of the heart—why must one retreat to mountains?"* The master said: *"I know this well, yet divine immortals often lodge in wilds and marshes. Only after achieving perfection do they emerge to mingle with the dust of the world."*

Also, Xue Youqi passed the imperial examinations during the Kaiyuan era but boldly withdrew, refusing office. He entered Mount Heming to seek the abode of the Han Celestial Master, cultivating the Dao for nearly twelve years, his vital energy ever more abundant. In the early Tianbao era, he wandered to Mount Heng, selecting a site for secluded transcendence. His mind roamed freely in the realm of self-attainment, unbound and at ease, yet he could harmonize his light with the common and break his edges to fit the square. Of the Three Caverns’ scriptures and teachings, there was none he did not master. Thus, recluses and free spirits turned to him for guidance. He once presented *The Subtle Discourse on the Origin* and a commentary on the *Scripture of Salvation for the Multitudes*, which circulated in the world.

Wang’s mulberry fields; Magu’s submerged lands.

*The Records of the Xuan Chamber* states: Master Wang, a man of the Dao, concealed his traces by the Wu River, and none recognized him. Shi Huizhi of Hongnong, having heard his name, sought him out.

As dusk fell, the Master traced a line in the courtyard with his staff—suddenly, thunder roared and shook the earth, mountains and valleys layered upon one another, and a vast lake stretched to the horizon. The Master said, "The hills and lands swiftly shift, giving way to the transformation of mulberry fields." The seated guests trembled in fear, but the Master reassured them, "This was but for amusement." With a sweep of his broom, the courtyard returned to its former stillness.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: When Magu descended to Cai Jing’s home, she entered to see Wang Fangping and bowed to him. Magu said, "Since we last met, I have witnessed the Eastern Sea turn to mulberry fields three times. Recently, Penglai’s waters have grown shallower than before—could it soon revert to hills and land?" Fangping smiled and replied, "The sages all say that even the seas will one day stir with dust."

Jade altars hum with wind-chimes; jasper terraces glisten with pure dew.

*The Records of Spirit Investigation* states: In the markets of Jianye, a diviner suddenly inscribed on the wall of the Purple Tenuity Palace:
*"Yesterday I passed the Purple Tenuity on my way to court,
The jade altar’s wind-chimes, apricot blossoms sparse.
A peach of jade bore me tidings—
Why ask why I no longer return to the mortal world?"*
From that day, he vanished without a trace, and all said he had ascended.

*The Unofficial Histories* recounts: In the early Kaicheng era of the Tang, the scholar Xu Lai, while traveling in Hezhong, suddenly fell gravely ill and lost consciousness. On the third day, he abruptly rose, seized a brush, and wrote upon the wall:
*"At dawn I entered the jasper terrace, the dew’s breath pure,
Seated there was only Xu Feiqiong.
My dust-laden heart yet clings to worldly ties—
Ten leagues down the mountain, the moon shines in vain."*
Having written this, he fell back into slumber. At daybreak, he startled awake and altered the second line to read: *"Heavenly winds blew down the sound of pacing the void."* After finishing, he sat motionless as if drunk, then awoke and spoke no more. After a long while, he gradually said, "In my dream, I arrived at the jasper terrace, where over three hundred female transcendents gathered. One among them claimed to be Xu Feiqiong and bade me compose a poem. When I finished, she instructed me to revise it, saying, 'I do not wish the people of the world to know of my existence.' After I completed it, she praised me highly and had all the transcendents compose matching verses. She said, 'You will eventually come here. For now, return. If someone guides you, you may yet find your way back.'"

Li He’s record of the jade tower; Dongfang Shuo’s inscription on the urn.

*The Garden of Calligraphy* records: As Li He lay dying, a figure in vermilion robes arrived in a chariot drawn by a red yak, bearing a tablet inscribed with characters resembling ancient seal script or the thunder-riven script of antiquity. The figure announced, "Li He is summoned." Unable to read the text, Li He descended from his couch and kowtowed, pleading, "My mother is old and ill—I do not wish to go." The vermilion-robed figure replied, "The Emperor has completed a white jade tower and summons you to compose its record. The joys of heaven are not to be lamented." Moments later, Li He’s breath ceased. In his childhood, he had addressed his mother as "Ami."

*The Record of Forgotten Lore* states: In the time of the Yellow Emperor, there was a vessel of agate; by the era of Yao, it still endured, filled with sweet dew that brimmed without ever diminishing. Called "precious dew," it was bestowed upon the assembled ministers. By the reign of Shun, the dew gradually waned, its abundance or scarcity mirroring the purity or corruption of the age—when times were pure, the dew overflowed; when degenerate, it vanished. The First Emperor of Qin, dredging the Miluo’s flow, unearthed a crimson jade urn with a capacity of eight *dou*. Placed within Shun’s temple, Dongfang Shuo recognized it and inscribed upon it: *"Auspicious clouds arise from the Dew Altar, propitious winds stir in the Moon Pavilion. Behold the Three Gourds as though a foot in height, gaze upon the Eight Vastnesses like a coiled sash. Li ascends the Cinnabar Terrace, Zǐwēi the Crimson City."*

*The Six Quires* records: The Perfected of Purple Yang, Zhou Jitong, entered the depths of Mount Meng, where he encountered a gatekeeper of the hermitage. Bowing twice, he begged for the secret of immortality. The gatekeeper replied, "Your name is inscribed in the Cinnabar Terrace’s jade chamber—why fear you will not ascend as an immortal?"

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* tells of the Heavenly Master Sima, whose name was Chéngzhēn and style Zǐwēi. The female transcend Nü Zhen Xie Naturally sailed across the sea to Penglai in search of a master. Arriving at a mountain, she met a Daoist who said, "Sima Chéngzhēn of Tiantai, whose name is recorded in the Cinnabar Terrace and whose person dwells in the Crimson City, is a true and worthy teacher." Naturally returned and sought him out, receiving the Way and attaining transcendence. He had over seventy disciples. One day, he declared, "From the eastern slopes of Jade Cloud Peak, I have often gazed toward Penglai, where true immortals descend in their chariots. Now I am summoned by the Green Lad Lord and must depart." Soon after, he shed his mortal form. By imperial decree, he was posthumously honored as Grand Master for Thorough Counsel with Silver and Cyan Brilliance, and enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity. The emperor personally composed his stele inscription, and his collected works circulated in the world.

*"Coiling serpents bow in submission, soaring cranes take flight."*

*The New Records of the Cinnabar Terrace* recounts: Peng Zong, styled Faxian, at the age of twenty became a disciple of the Perfected Du Chong. Deeply favored and instructed, he savored the flavor of the Dao and refined his essence to commune with spirits. Within the mountains, venomous serpents and fierce tigers abounded, but Zong would subdue them with his *qi*, causing them to coil and crouch motionless, unable to stir even when touched. Only when he released them would they depart.

*The Divine Transcendent Biographies of the Wang Clan* states: The daughter of Prime Minister Wang Hui, from childhood, yearned for the Dao. She chanted scriptures and played the zither, often saying, "The Grotto Palaces have summoned me to fill a post among the immortals." She inscribed a poem: *"Endlessly I climb mountains and ford streams, while immortals descend to hear my zither’s song. This heart holds no love for the mortal world—only the twin cranes flying toward heaven’s edge."* That very night, she passed away in an instant. At dawn, a pair of cranes soared above the garden trees, celestial music and rare fragrance filling the fields. When her form was placed in the coffin, only her empty garments remained.

*"Hollow and numinous melons, sweet snow of Xián Isle."*

*The Record of Forgotten Lore* further relates: During the Later Han, Lady Yin, a favored consort of Emperor Ming, dreamed of eating an exceedingly sweet melon. The emperor dispatched envoys to seek it from distant lands. At that time, Dunhuang presented a rare melon seed, while the kingdom of Dānshān offered a giant peach-pit gourd named *Qiónglóng*, three feet in length and twisted in form, its taste as sweet as malt sugar. A Daoist had once brought this gourd from Penglai, calling it the "Hollow and Numinous Melon," which bore fruit but once in four kalpas. The Queen Mother of the West had left it in this land, and though ages had passed, its seeds yet remained. It was also said that the giant peach blossomed beneath the frost and ripened only in the height of summer, and was likewise the food of immortals.

Again, King Mu of Zhou journeyed east to the Valley of Great Steeds, pointing toward the Palace of Spring Clouds, where he gathered the essentials of immortality from masters of all quarters. The Queen Mother of the West arrived in a chariot drawn by emerald phoenixes, preceded by striped tigers and leopards, and followed by chimeras and purple elk. She trailed slippers of cinnabar jade and spread mats of azure reeds. Yellow-tube reeds and jade platters were set beneath a canopy of jade, where they feasted in grand assembly. As wine, they offered the limpid, gem-like essence of *qióngyīng*, and also served the "Crimson Ripples of Cave Abyss" and the "Sweet Snow of Xián Isle."

*"Bówēi’s golden essence, Rénběn’s jade flakes."*

*The New Records of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Zhuang Bowēi, from youth, was devoted to the Dao. Daily at sunset, he would face the northwest, close his eyes, clench his fists, and visualize Mount Kunlun. After twenty-one years of this practice, he ingested elixirs and entered the mountains to study the Way, yet maintained this discipline for another decade. One day, as he closed his eyes, he suddenly beheld Kunlun. Persisting in his visualization, he was visited by an immortal who bestowed upon him the method of the "Golden Essence," by which he attained the Dao. Such was the power of his concentrated spirit—had he not followed this path, the mystery would have remained beyond reach.

*The Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang* tells of Zheng Renben, who, while traveling in the mountains with his cousin, lost their way. They encountered a man resting his head upon a bundle. Upon inquiry, he replied, "Do you know of the Seven Treasures City? Eighty-two thousand households are constantly repairing it, and I am one of them." He opened the bundle to reveal several axes and adzes, along with two packets of jade-flake rice. Dividing it with Zheng, he said, "Eat this, and you shall remain free of illness for life."

*"Lǐ embodies the Dao and its virtue; Yán weighs its merits and flaws."*

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: The Daoist Li Hanguang of Jinling, at the age of thirteen, was deeply devoted to the study of the Dao. Though alone in a dim chamber, he conducted himself as though in the presence of a sovereign or father. Those who saw him could not help but compose their countenance and demeanor. Emperor Xuanzong summoned him to inquire about governance and transformation. Li replied, *"The* Dao and Its Virtue *is the teacher of kings. In ancient times, when Emperor Wen of Han practiced it, the people were guided toward benevolence and longevity."* The emperor then asked about the golden tripod. Li answered, "The Dao is impartial; those who lightly ascend are the selfish within the impartial. Though their selfishness may occasionally manifest, it is but the Sage’s way of preserving the teaching. To seek life while indulging desire is like chasing the wind—is it not difficult?" The emperor greatly praised him.

Moreover, Yan Da reached enlightenment, styled Daotong. From the time his topknot was first bound, he harbored aspirations beyond the mundane world. During the Jiande era of Emperor Wu of Zhou, the emperor summoned the Dharma Master to the private palace hall. By then, the floating and superficial among the Buddhist clergy had already been purged, and a decree was issued to the ministers and nobles to debate the abolition of the Daoist tradition. The emperor asked the Dharma Master which was superior, the Dao or the Buddha. He replied, "The host is superior, the guest inferior." The emperor asked, "How does one distinguish host from guest?" He answered, "The Buddha came from the West—is he not a guest? The Dao emerged from the Central Plains—is it not the host?" The emperor said, "If the guest returns to the West, does the host not see him off?" He replied, "If the guest departs, it benefits the lands of the Hu; if the host remains, it does no harm to the Central Hua. Those who leave are not pursued, and those who stay preserve themselves—why see them off?" The emperor praised his response.

Coins summoned to flight, lamps extinguished at a gesture. *The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Master Ge the Immortal once took coins and had someone cast them into a well. Yan went to the well, called for the coins with a vessel, and onlookers saw each coin fly out of the well and into his container. *Further Accounts of Immortals* records: Song Zhibai became a Daoist, his brows and eyes bright as daylight, his speech elegant and refined. In summer, he wore cotton; in winter, his footprints appeared in snow, yet a pace and a half around his body, steam-like qi arose, and the snow did not congeal. With a point, he could extinguish a lamp; with a gesture, he could strike a person as if blown by a draft through a crack. Sometimes he ate five catties of roasted meat, a basin of garlic shoots, and two *dou* of wine. Wherever he stayed, he would use gold and silk to acquire a pair of braids and a beautiful woman, then take them with him on his travels. People believed this restored his brain and replenished his primordial *qi*. Later, in Nancheng County of Fuzhou, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight, his court robes still hanging, his talismanic writs suspended.

From the *New Records of the Elixir Terrace*: When Tao the Recluse was appointed Gentleman in Attendance at the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, he felt considerable discontent. In a letter to his elder cousin, he wrote: "In my youth, I resolved to sever worldly ambitions, vowing that by forty I would serve as a Gentleman of the Ministry of Personnel, then take office as magistrate of some fine, antiquity-rich county in eastern Zhe, where I might briefly enjoy its mountains and rivers before casting off my official’s cap to pursue loftier paths. All this I once spoke of as easily as pointing to my palm. Yet now, at thirty-six, I am only just appointed Gentleman in Attendance—better to depart sooner than endure such toil and humiliation. I intend to remove my court robes and hang them at the Gate of the Divine Tiger, don a deer-felt cap, and stride directly out through the Eastern Pavilion."

Later, bidding farewell to Wang Yan, he mentioned this plan. Yan cautioned, "His Majesty governs with stern discipline and permits no eccentric conduct. Should you act against his wishes, it may thwart your noble aspirations—what then?" After a long silence, the Master replied, "I act for myself, not for reputation. If such concerns arise, why persist?" Thus, he never attended court, submitting only a memorial of resignation.

From the *True Sayings*: The next morning, Attendant Gentleman Xia Fu, styled Zizhi, a native of Chenliu, consumed a diet of wood-ear mushrooms and refined mica. In his youth, when summoned by the imperial court, he hung his official writ on a mulberry tree and departed, so steadfast was his resolve for lofty reclusion.

When the Kingdom of Yuezhi presented a rare beast, Ma Cun engaged in archery games.

From the *Biographies of the Immortals*: Emperor Wu of Han visited Anding and the Kingdom of Yuezhi. He dispatched envoys bearing four ounces of silent incense, each piece as large as a sparrow’s egg and black as mulberry bark, along with a fierce beast, its form resembling a leopard cat with yellow fur. The Emperor asked, "Such a small creature—why call it fierce?" The envoy replied, "That which commands awe among the hundred birds does not hide its power in size. Thus, the divine *lin* is king of the great elephant, and the phoenix is ancestor of the roc—neither depends on bulk or stature. Our kingdom lies thirty million *li* from here. We have long observed the east wind entering the pitch-pipes and azure clouds crossing the musical tones, signs that a ruler fond of the Dao would arise in the Middle Kingdom. For this reason, we presented these two offerings. Who could have foreseen Your Majesty would fail to recognize their truth?" The Emperor, resenting the envoy’s presumption, sought to punish him. By the next day, both the envoy and the fierce beast had vanished.

From the *Extensive Records*: A villager from Mayang Village spotted a wild boar and shot it. The arrow led him to a stone chamber, where an old man said, "This is no true boar—leave at once." A youth escorted him out. The villager asked, "Who is that old man?" The youth replied, "He is the River Earl, commanded by the Celestial Emperor to lecture on the *Book of Changes* to the immortals." The villager then asked the youth, "And who are you?" The youth answered, "I am Wang Fusi. Failing to master the *Book of Changes*, I was punished to guard this gate." The youth sealed the door with a stone. When the villager looked around, all was desolate—he knew not where he stood.

Yang Jun questioned the dragon; Ge Gong borrowed the fish.

From the *True Reports*: Yang Xi dreamed he ascended a high mountain, surrounded on all sides by vast waters. He saw a white dragon, its body spanning several *zhang*, flying eastward with radiance that lit up the sky. A woman in white entered its mouth, then emerged three times before ceasing. She stood to Yang Xi’s right, while to his left appeared an old man in embroidered robes and a lotus crown, leaning on a nine-jointed red staff. Both gazed at the white dragon. Yang Xi asked, "What manner of woman enters the dragon’s mouth?" The old man replied, "She is the Grand Primordial Jade Maiden, Xiao Zifu, who draws dragon *qi* to refine her form." Yang Xi asked, "Who are you, and why have you come to this place?" The old man answered, "I am Luo Guangxiu, the Immortal Lord of Penglai. This Penglai Mountain is my domain, and I came to meet you as its presiding lord." Yang Xi asked, "May one ride this dragon?" The old man replied, "This dragon is ridden by the Perfected: Zhang Youshi, Shi Qing’an, Xu Yufu, and Ding Zhangning." Yang Xi asked, "How can four people ride a single dragon?" The old man said, "This is a dawn-attending dragon, swift as a light chariot in the mortal world."

From the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*: As Immortal Lord Ge traveled, he encountered a fishmonger on the road. He said to the vendor, "May I borrow this fish to visit the River Earl?" The vendor replied, "The fish is already dead." Lord Ge inscribed a talisman and placed it in the fish’s mouth, then cast it into the water. The fish leapt up at once.

Shuang Qiuzu ascended lightly; Zi Zhen rose to the void.

From the *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: The Daoist Shuang Qiuzu dwelled in White Horse Grotto, reciting the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*. When his practice reached fulfillment, he shut himself in his chamber for seven days. His disciples, alarmed, opened the door—only to find him gone, having ascended lightly into the heavens. He left behind his immortal robe on a treetop and his bamboo mat in a niche; even a century later, both remained unspoiled.

Another Daoist, He Zizhen, was learned and lofty in aspiration. He cultivated the Dao on Mount Song. One day, clouds and cranes filled the sky with music. Zizhen ascended into the void and departed. The scholar Chen Tao, witnessing this with the people of Luoyang, composed a poem:

*"Zi Jin’s simurgh soars o’er ancient Luo’s stream,
The golden peach ripens anew for Lord He’s flight.
Triple Clarity’s music plays ‘neath Song Mountain’s height,
Five-colored clouds gather before the imperial park’s gleam.
Crimson crests dance low to greet the crimson staff’s might,
Green sleeves sing on, halting the fragrant plow’s dream.
Who now will weep over white letters in sorrow’s seam?
The Supreme Ultimate’s light spans a hundred million years’ light."*

Liu Xu’s hidden virtue; Han Chong’s benevolent governance.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Liu Xiang’s family was immensely wealthy, yet he aided the destitute and impoverished, practicing hidden virtue. Repeatedly promoted, he became governor of Songliu, where he diminished his own share to provide for others. There, Master Ma Huang appeared to him, saying: "Your benevolence moves Heaven and Earth; your virtue stirs gods and spirits. The Supreme Honored One commends your sincerity and has sent me to guide you toward long life. I am an immortal official—will you follow me?" Xiang accompanied him and was taught the method of ingesting the blossoms of the Five Stars. Now he resides in Huayang Grotto as the Right Supervisor of Principles.

Also, Han Chong, a native of Piling, encountered the divine adept Wang Weiyuan, who transmitted to him the *Flowing Pearl and Cinnabar Prime* method. He instructed: "Practice this Way, and you may serve in office. When your merit is complete, nothing will hinder your ascent as an immortal." Chong first served as magistrate of Wanling, where he governed with the Seven Governances to comfort the people, and locusts never alighted within his borders. Later promoted to governor, he cherished the people as if they were wounded, and his transformative governance spread far and wide. He again met Weiyuan, who taught him the method of reclusion and bodily dissolution. Thereupon, he entered Great Mount Huo to transcend the world. Now he serves in Huayang as the Left Supervisor of Principles.

Xiao Wen mended shoes; he bore a shoulder-mirror on his back.
*The Traditions of Divine Transcendents* records: Xiao Wen spent over a decade mending shoes in the marketplace, yet none knew him as an immortal—only that he did not age. Those who admired him sought his Way and its safeguards, but none succeeded, save for Mother Liang, who obtained his method of kindling fire. One day, he ascended Triple Brightness Mountain to bid her farewell, then rose amid columns of great flame.

*The Arrayed Traditions of Transcendents* states: There was a mirror-polisher who always carried a shoulder-mirror in the marketplace. No one knew his name, and all addressed him only as "Shoulder-Bearer." At times, he sold medicines, and those who consumed them were cured. Gu He held the canopy; Chunyu Dian grasped the handle.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Gu He was a man of Wu. Orphaned in youth, he possessed steadfast resolve and served the Jin as Palace Aide to the Censor-in-Chief, later rising to Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat. In the first year of the Yonghe era, he underwent liberation by means of a simulated corpse, whereupon the Most High welcomed him to serve as Canopy-Bearer, and he now resides in the Grotto of Flourishing Yang.

*The Arrayed Traditions of Transcendents* records: Chunyu was a native of Shangyu. From childhood he loved the Dao, and in his maturity he mastered the arts of divination. He withdrew to dwell in seclusion on Mount Tianmu, where he encountered the transcendent Huichezi, who bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Cinnabar Elixir*. Upon completion of his work, he now serves in the grotto as Handle-Bearer, presiding over the testing of those of the Dao.

Han Kang concealed his name; Dai Meng altered his surname.

*The Unofficial History of the Later Han* states: Han Kang, styled Boxiu, often gathered herbs on famous mountains and sold medicines along the roads of Chang’an. For over thirty years, he never altered his prices. Once, a woman came to purchase medicine, and Kang held firm to his price. The woman grew angry and said, “Are you not Han Kang Boxiu? How can you not vary your price?” Kang sighed and said, “I sought only to avoid fame, yet now even women know me. What use is selling medicine?” He then fled into the mountains of Baling. Though the imperial carriage repeatedly summoned him, he never came.

*The Traditions of Eminent Daoists* records: The Daoist Dai Meng was originally surnamed Yan and named Ji, a man of the late Han. Believing that those who nurtured life should conceal their names and hide the hour of their birth, he changed his surname to Dai and feigned service at the court of Emperor Wu. From youth, Meng loved the Dao and served his mother with filial devotion. After the mourning period for his mother ended, he entered Mount Hua to ingest wood essences. There he met the Perfected Lord Pei, who transmitted to him the *Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants*, whereupon he gained the ability to move lightly through the famous mountains, covering seven hundred *li* in a day.

Yellow talismans cured epidemics; Su Xiang revived the dead.

*The Comprehensive Survey of Divine Marvels* states: In Chang’an there was a man named Huang, who once acquired a servant. The servant carried his burdens and followed him for nearly one or two years. Huang’s family was poor and distressed, and the couple lamented their plight. The servant overheard them and asked, “How much does the master require?” They replied, “Five hundred thousand cash.” The servant said, “I have a small skill that can obtain it.”

He then purchased fine paper, brushes, inkstones, clay jars, and fermented beans, each one item. The next morning, he took them to the marketplace. There, the servant layered hundreds of sheets of paper, held a brush, and announced to the crowd: “Today I shall inscribe a talisman on the topmost sheet, allowing the ink to seep through all the layers. Next year, a great epidemic will strike Chang’an, and this talisman will cure it. Each talisman will cost fifty gold pieces.” The following day, he indeed obtained five hundred thousand cash. Then, practicing qi circulation, he exhaled upon the grass to kindle a fire, its flames illuminating one another. Covering his head with the clay jar, he sat within the fire and vanished without a trace.

The next year, a fiery plague indeed ravaged Chang’an, but those who possessed the talisman were spared.

*The Record of Subtle Marvels* states: There was a man named Su Dege who excelled at compounding *Returning Soul Incense*. However, those who had been buried for eighty-one years or more could not be revived. At one time, the Astronomer’s Registrar Xu Bi wept as he entreated him, saying, “My parents and great-grandparents all wish to pay their respects once more.” Su assented, then drew from his怀 a packet resembling white sandalwood incense and placed a pinch in the censer. The smoke curled upward in delicate tendrils, its fragrance surpassing even borneol. Su softly intoned: “Xu Zhao desires to see his forebears; may this incense smoke serve as their guide.” After the time it takes to eat a meal, a sudden gust swept the curtains, and his ancestors—parents and great-grandparents—all appeared. Xu wept as he bowed. Gazing intently, he saw that their robes and headdresses were exactly as in life. They said, “Today’s reunion is truly rare.” After they had drunk, they slowly departed beyond the curtains, dissolving into mist. Later, Su Dege also vanished without a trace.

The Jade Cup Maiden, an immortal of Golden Flower Mountain.

*The Record of Hidden Wonders* states: A scholar named Cui encountered a maiden at the mouth of Luogu Valley in Shuzhou and married her. Cui’s mother said, “This new bride is bewitchingly beautiful; she must be a fox spirit who will harm you.” The maiden replied, “I originally hoped to serve you for a lifetime, but since your honored mother treats me as a fox enchantress, I shall depart tomorrow.” The next day, she entered the mountains and disappeared. Later, a foreign monk said, “The wife you took was the immortal Jade Cup Maiden. Had she stayed for a year, your entire family would have become immortals.” Scholar Cui could only sigh in regret.

*The Jade Canon of the Great Cavern* states: In the Heaven of the Grand Beginning, there is a Pool of Flowing Jade. Within the pool stands a jade tree, its lotus blossom spanning ten *zhang*, the pool itself a thousand *li* wide, its waters fragrant and sweet. The Golden Flower Immortal dwells within the lotus, drinking the pool’s waters to clarify the five viscera and cause purple clouds to bloom upon the face. Zhang mistakenly consumed forbidden food and was thus forbidden to eat meat.

*The Extensive Record of Marvels* states: Zhang Tao, Dragon Diagram Scholar, was the son of Zhang Kui, Straight Academician of the Bureau of Military Affairs. When his father served as Palace Attendant, he daily attended court audiences and rented a residence in the capital, where he usually kept his gates closed. One day, someone knocked urgently, shouting, “Little master, why won’t you let me out?” Zhang rose to look and saw an elderly Daoist. Suspecting the man was mad or drunk, he paid him no further mind, and after a long while, the Daoist departed. That very night, his wife gave birth to Tao. In the first year of Jingyou, he passed the imperial examination. Later, he once mistakenly ate dog meat and dreamed that a yellow-robed messenger summoned him to a palace. There, a Daoist asked, “Why did you consume forbidden food?” Zhang defended himself, saying, “I did not dare to eat it intentionally; it was an accident.” The Daoist replied, “If that is so, then remain here for now. I shall speak on your behalf.” After a short while, he emerged and called to Zhang, “Come and express your gratitude.” He led him before a hall and announced, “Zhang Tao has mistakenly consumed forbidden food.” Zhang bowed twice in thanks and awoke, his body drenched in sweat. Scholar Zhang possessed a refined spirit and noble bearing, his heart open and magnanimous—was he not one of the immortals’ court, temporarily banished to the mortal realm?

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: The mother of Daoist Ying Yijie dreamed of a shooting star entering her window. Startled awake, she saw light filling the room and consequently conceived. After his birth, he disliked meat and strong flavors. He was entrusted with the *Zhengyi* and *Zixu* registers, and his mastery of their practices was profound. He once told his disciples: “I uphold the teachings and laws, yet I cannot eradicate all hidden flaws. The Dao moves without opposing others, and right action arises naturally. Yet how far apart are the Jade Capital and Golden Gates from the Yellow Springs and Fengdu? It is but the mind’s own manifestation. Strive on, all of you.” “When Wang Zijin peered into the well, Scholar Yan knocked at the gate.”

*Records of Forgotten Tales*: In the first year of the *Dashǐ* era, the year Wei Emperor became Prince of Chenliu, there was in the kingdom of Pin-Si a cinnabar-stone well, not hewn by human hands. Its depths reached the subterranean springs, and its waters perpetually boiled and surged. When immortals wished to drink, they drew the water with long silk cords. The people of that land were all immensely strong, subsisting not on the five grains. At noon, they cast no shadow, and they drank the essence of clouds and mist. Their garments were woven from feathers, and their hair, thick as strands of hemp, was as tough as sinew. When stretched, it measured nearly ten feet, yet when released, it coiled back like a silkworm’s thread. They twisted it into ropes to draw water from the cinnabar well, in which dwelled white frogs with two wings, flitting to and fro above the well. The immortals ate them.

Wang Zijin approached the well and peered in. A blue sparrow carried a jade ladle in its beak and offered it to him. As Zijin took it, clouds arose and snow swirled. He waved his sleeve, and the clouds and snow stilled. The white frogs transformed into a pair of turtledoves, which vanished into the clouds.

*Records of Lively Conversations*: Yan Shize served as *Shangyi Fengyu* during Emperor Muzong’s reign. While entering the mountains to gather herbs, he came upon a thatched hut enveloped in vines and mist. There, a man lay upon a rock. Yan greeted him, and the man replied: “Since the An Lushan rebellion, I have lived here in seclusion, unaware of the passing years. I keep no fire and live without smoke. Yet you have come from afar, and I have nothing to ease your hunger.” He took from his paper pouch something resembling lentils, drew one out, and boiled it in spring water. After a long while, the fragrance filled the air, and it was ready. He bade Yan eat, and upon tasting it, Yan felt fully satiated. The man said: “That you have come here is due to your predestined affinity. In time, you will rise to the rank of *Fangbo*. If you can cast off worldly splendor, you may yet attain long life.”

When He Hou poured wine, Daozi flicked ink.

*The Comprehensive Records of Immortals*: He Hou was a recluse on Mount Cangwu during the reign of Emperor Yao. When Emperor Shun made his southern inspection and lodged at He Hou’s home, the Five Elders of the Great Emperor came to pay their respects, saying, “The time for your ascension has come.” The next day, the Five Emperors descended to welcome Shun, who ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The Five Emperors gave He Hou a vessel of elixir, instructing him to pour it into wine. His entire household of over three hundred drank without exhausting it. When the remaining wine was sprinkled upon the house, the entire dwelling ascended, and he was appointed as the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate. Today, on Mount Jiu Nong, there stands a temple to He Hou beside the Temple of Shun.

*The Lesser Records of Immortals*: Wu Daozi received the divine transmission of immortals, and his paintings were miraculously lifelike. When Emperor Taizong of Tang heard of this, he summoned him to the palace. There, a freshly plastered wall several *xun* in length was prepared for him to paint landscapes. Daozi ordered curtains to be draped over the wall, then splashed ink upon it. After covering it again, he waited a long while before saying, “May Your Majesty now behold the painting.” The mountains, forests, grasses, trees, human dwellings, and birds—all were perfectly rendered. The emperor gazed at it for a long time before noticing a small cave beneath the rocks. Daozi pointed and said, “This cave is home to many immortals. If you knock, there will be a response.” He then struck the cave with his hand, and the rocky door opened, revealing a youth standing beside it. Daozi said, “There are many fine treasures within. Would Your Majesty like to see them?” He leapt into the cave and beckoned to the emperor, but the emperor dared not enter. The cave door then closed again, and Daozi vanished without a trace.

Zang Qiong as the Wine Star, Zhang Lu as the Rice Bandit.

*Unofficial Histories*: When Minister Zhang Qiong Jianxiong governed Xichuan, he ordered his attendants to seek out those skilled in Daoist arts. Among them was a tavern keeper whose wine surpassed all others, yet who cared little for profit and extended credit generously. Four men in gauze hats and straw sandals would come to drink, consuming several *dou* each time. Though they accumulated debts of over ten *shi* of grain, they would repay it all at once before departing in high spirits, laughing and jesting. Someone reported this to Minister Zhang, who then secretly ordered surveillance. For over a month, the four did not return. Then, one day, they reappeared. Zhang, in plain clothes, stealthily followed them. As he approached, the four suddenly leapt up, bowed twice, and upon rising, vanished without a trace. At the time, Emperor Xuanzong was fond of the Dao, so Zhang reported the matter. The emperor summoned him and asked, “Those were the Wine Stars of Venus,” Zhang replied.

*The Biographies of the Celestial Masters*: Zhang Lu, styled Gongqi, was the governor of Hanzhong and Nanzheng. Whenever he performed rituals to heal the sick, they would swiftly recover. For each healing, he required a *hu* of rice as offering, amassing vast quantities. When the Prince of Wei assumed regency, he derided Zhang as the “Rice Bandit” and dispatched generals to suppress him. His disciples, seeing the approaching army, rushed in alarm to inform their master. Zhang drew a line on the ground with his hand tablet, and the river’s currents surged violently, preventing the troops from crossing. He then forced them to use naval forces. Zhang again traced the air with his tablet, and nine towering peaks rose into the heavens, blocking their advance. Hearing of this, the Prince of Wei sent envoys to apologize and bestowed upon Zhang the titles of Inspector of Liang and Yi Provinces, General Who Pacifies the South, and Marquis of Guanzhong. Later, he ascended in flight.

Returning to truth, revealing scriptures—Bo Chou expounds the *Yi*.

From *Miscellaneous Records of Xiangshan*:

In the bingchen year of the Xining reign, Jia rebels raided Yong Prefecture, and Scholar Tang Zizheng of the Bureau of Edicts, along with his entire household, perished in the massacre. Tang was a native of Guizhou. During the Zhiping era, he traveled to the capital for the imperial examinations. Midway in Quanzhou, he sought to hire a servant. Wandering into Yuanzhou, he encountered a former bondsman he had once employed—one who carried heavy burdens with the vigor of a strong bird. Even when Tang whipped his horse to a gallop, the servant remained a hundred paces ahead. Fearing the man might flee, Tang dismissed him.

That very day, the servant journeyed from Quanzhou to Tangzhou—a distance of nearly two thousand seven hundred *li*—and by midday had already arrived. He left a letter with the post-station attendant, instructing: "When Scholar Tang of Guizhou arrives, deliver this to him." Tang himself arrived over a month later. As he dismounted at the station, the attendant approached and asked, "Are you not Scholar Tang?" Then produced the letter, sealed by *Guizhenzi*. Tang broke the seal to find a single poem:

*At Yuanshan we met, then parted for Quanzhou,*
*Unmet, the Master’s Dao remains unfulfilled.*
*Most seek wealth and rank with all their heart,*
*Yet in the end, none may learn the immortal’s art.*
*Dispense the elixirs in your basket without cease,*
*Guard the cinnabar in your crucible, transmit it not in vain.*
*When the Horned Dragon’s feast arrives,*
*Seek the yellow-cliffed retreat in the forest springs.*

When asked to describe the sender’s appearance, Tang recognized the dismissed servant from Quanzhou. The year of his death, bingchen, precisely matched the "Horned Dragon" foretold in the poem.

From *Supplement to the Biographies of Transcendents*:

Yang Bochou was fond of studying the *Yi*. He withdrew to Mount Hua, where He Tuo once asked him about his learning in the *Yi*. Yang replied: "In the Golden Heaven Grotto beneath Mount Taihua, I received the *Yi* taught by Fuxi himself—identical to the primordial Dao, its principles exhausting all mysteries. How could the common discourses of worldly scholars fathom the aims of immortals?" The trigrams of *Ge* ascend and descend; the winds of *Zheng* blow north and south.

From *New Records of the Cinnabar Terrace*:

Once, while traveling by boat, Master Ge the Immortal was asked by his disciples about the ten-odd talismans in his chest: "What powers do these talismans possess? May we witness them?" The Master replied: "Divine talismans can accomplish anything." At the disciples’ request, he cast one into the water. The current surged violently, and the talisman drifted downstream. "What do you make of this?" he asked. A guest replied, "If any of us threw one in, it would do the same." He cast a second talisman, which defied the current and swam upstream. "And this?" The guest exclaimed, "Extraordinary!" He cast a third talisman into the water, where it hovered motionless, neither rising nor sinking. Suddenly, the upstream talisman descended, the downstream one ascended, and all three converged at the center, gathering together without drifting away.

From *The Biography of Zheng Hong*:

*The Records of Kuaiji* states: South of Shedi Mountain lies White Crane Mountain, where cranes retrieve arrows for immortals. The Han Grand Commandant Zheng Hong, while gathering firewood, found a lost arrow. Soon after, someone came searching for it. Zheng returned it, and the man asked what he desired. Recognizing him as a transcendent, Zheng replied, "I often struggle to carry firewood along the Ruoye River. I wish for a south wind at dawn and a north wind at dusk." Later, this came to pass. To this day, the winds of the Ruoye River are still called "Lord Zheng’s Winds."

Dai Yang was of humble appearance; Li A was impoverished.

From *The History of the Jin*:

Dai Yang, styled Guoliu, was a native of Changcheng in Wuxing. At the age of twelve, he fell ill and died. After five days, he revived, recounting that celestial envoys had appointed him as the Wine Cellar Scribe, bestowing upon him talismans and registers. He was led by banner-bearing attendants to ascend Penglai, Kunlun, Jishi, Taihuang, Da, Lu, Heng, and other sacred mountains. Upon being sent back, he encountered an old man who told him: "In the future, you will attain the Dao and be recognized by a nobleman." In adulthood, he mastered the art of wind angles, divination, and astrology, excelling in prognostication without relying on wind or observation. He was devoted to the Dao, though of short and plain stature.

From *The Biographies of Divine Transcendents*:

Li A, a native of Shu, often begged in Chengdu, yet whatever he received he would redistribute to the poor. He would depart at night and return by dawn, and none knew where he lodged. Later, he once told others: "I have been summoned to Kunlun and must depart." Thereafter, he was never seen again.

Liu Kuan, the Venerable, was the Summer Radiance Duke.

From *Declarations of the Perfected*:

During the Later Han, Liu Kuan served as Grand Commandant under Emperor Ling. Once, while seated with guests, he sent a servant to purchase wine. The servant returned after a long delay, thoroughly drunk. The guests could not bear it, and Liu Kuan’s horse said: "Beast." Shortly after, Liu Kuan sent someone to check on the servant, fearing he might secretly take his own life. Turning to his attendants, he said: "This man was called a beast—what greater humiliation could there be? That is why I feared for his life." His wife, wishing to test his forbearance, waited until he was dressed in court robes for an audience. She had a maidservant carry a bowl of meat broth, which was then spilled onto his ceremonial attire. The maid quickly gathered the soiled garments, but Liu Kuan’s expression remained unchanged. He merely said, unhurried: "Did the broth scald your hand?" Such was his nature and demeanor that he was hailed throughout the realm as the Venerable.

From *The Unfolding of Hidden Subtleties*:

Xia Qi, King Wen, the Duke of Shao, and Wu Jizha—Xia Qi was the Radiance Duke. These Four Radiance Dukes shall later ascend the ranks of transcendence, presiding over the affairs of spirits in the four directions.

Li Ying’s chamber of flood dragons, Sun Simiao’s palace of dragons.

From *Records of the Tree of Forgetfulness*:

Li Ying encountered a divine woman who bestowed upon him a bolt of plain silk, saying it was woven in the chamber of flood dragons. Later, he met a Hu merchant who offered three million in exchange for it, explaining: "This was woven from the fine beard beneath a dragon’s chin, and it takes thirty minor kalpas to complete a single weft."

From *Sequel to the Biographies of Transcendents*:

Sun Simiao once saw a man killing a snake. He removed his robe to ransom it, applied medicine to its wound, and released it into the grass. Months later, he was suddenly summoned to a walled city resembling a royal residence. There, a man in crimson robes thanked him, saying: "My younger brother was saved by you." Sun secretly asked those around him where he was, and they replied: "The Water Palace of Jingyang." After being detained for a feast, he was asked what he desired. Sun replied: "I dwell in the mountains and delight in the Dao, so I have no wants." The host then presented him with thirty prescriptions from the Dragon Palace, saying: "These remedies can save the world and succor the people." Upon returning, Sun tested the prescriptions, healing countless lives. He compiled the *Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand in Gold*, incorporating the Dragon Palace remedies within. Emperor Gaozong of Tang, having heard of his fame, offered him the post of Remonstrance Advisor, which he declined. Later, his body vanished, leaving only his clothes—he is now known as the Perfected Sun.

Ge Qi summoned rain, Zhao Bing called forth wind.

From *The Biographies of Divine Transcendents*:

The Yellow Reed Master, surnamed Ge and named Qi, healed the sick. Even those from a thousand *li* away would send their names for treatment, and all were cured. He lived to two hundred and eighty years of age. He could restrain water, causing it to flow backward, and lift a thousand *jin* with ease. He could run as swiftly as a galloping horse, and above his head there was always a five-colored qi, rising over a *zhang* in height. During severe droughts, he would descend into deep pools, summon the dragons, and urge them to ascend to the heavens, bringing rain for days. One day, he mounted a dragon and departed, bidding farewell to his kin—never to return.

From *Comprehensive Records of Transcendents*:

Zhao Bing, styled Gong’a, was a native of Shuyang. Once, while traveling afar, he encountered an old friend. Bing poured water from a rushing stream and turned it into wine, then carved mulberry bark into platters, and all drank and feasted to their hearts’ content. Another time, arriving at a river he wished to cross, he sought a boat from the shore, but the boatman ignored him. Bing then spread his cloak upon the water and sat, summoning the wind to churn the currents as he crossed—his garments remained utterly dry. Those who witnessed this marveled at his divine prowess.

Ruan Qiu sold scallions; Wen Bin fed on chrysanthemums.

From *Biographies of Transcendents*:

Huang Ruan Qiu was a Daoist of Mount Mu, clad in furs with unbound hair and ears six or seven *cun* long. His mouth was toothless, yet he could walk four or five hundred *li* in a day. He would often rest upon the mountains, planting scallions and selling herbs to sustain himself. For over a hundred years, none recognized him—until Zhu Huang pointed him out, revealing him as a divine being. But when they sought him again, he had vanished.

Wen Bin, a native of Taiqiu, made his living selling straw sandals. One day, he abandoned his wife and entered the mountains, subsisting on chrysanthemums and never emerging. His wife, grown old, followed him into the mountains and found Bin looking younger than before. He refused to descend, saying, “You too are suited to the Dao.” He then instructed her to consume chrysanthemums and cultivate *qi*, and together, husband and wife attained the Way.

Xie Fu dwelled in Lesser Wei; Li Zhi lodged in the Neck Star.

From *Unofficial History of the Jin*:

Xie Fu, styled Qingxu, was a native of Kuaiji. He entered Mount Taibai for over a decade. The General-in-Chief, Huan Wen, summoned him to serve as his secretary, and the imperial court offered him the post of Academician—both of which he declined. Earlier, when the moon trespassed against Lesser Wei (also called the Recluse Star), astrologers interpreted this as a sign that a hermit would be affected. Dai Kui of Qiao Commandery was a man of great talent, and some feared for him. Soon after, Fu died, prompting the literati of Kuaiji to mock the people of Wu, saying: “The lofty scholars of Wu—so eager for death, yet death eludes them.”

From *Pure Tales from the Jade Flask*:

Li Zhi, while serving in the southern court, once composed *The Rhapsody of the Neck Star*. In its preface, he wrote: “In my youth, I was often ill, so frail I could scarcely bear my robes. In the year *gengyin*, I dreamed I wandered into a Daoist palace, resplendent with gold and jade. Within a grand hall stood a precious platform, and upon it coiled a golden dragon, its azure beard and golden mane radiating light across heaven and earth. Beside it stood a green-haired Daoist, his eyes flashing like lightning. He said to me: ‘This is the Palace of the Neck Star. The great celestial wheel never halts—hasten to pay homage. You shall serve this dragon, and your accumulated ailments will vanish.’ As I prepared to bow to the dragon, I first bowed to the Supreme Dao.”

When Emperor Taizong ascended the throne, Emperor Zhenzong was named Crown Prince. The emperor commanded Li Zhi and Li Kang to serve as his tutors, admonishing Zhenzong: “These two ministers are venerable scholars of profound virtue—treat them not lightly. Choose upright men to guide you, and the foundation of our lineage and state shall be secure.” Zhenzong reverently heeded his father’s instruction, bowing to them before they spoke—a sign that aligned with the omen of the Neck Star.

A turtle drawn on tile; a deer bent by grass.

From *Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang*:

Wang Qiong possessed the arts of the Dao. He took a tile shard, drew a turtle’s shell upon it, and held it in his sleeve. After a moment, he removed it and placed it on the ground—it had become a living turtle, crawling about the courtyard. After several days, it reverted to tile.

From *Records of the Western Mountains*:

Perfected Lord Huang, named Renxian and styled Ziting, once received a summons from the Jade Emperor to ascend to heaven. His two younger brothers, however, remained at their hunting grounds. Ziting hastened to them and said: “We are creatures of wandering nature, unfit for immortality. Yet if our entire family could ascend together, we would not refuse. Perhaps our allotted share of deer has not been fulfilled—this is why we cling to delusion.” Ziting, seeing their resolve, entrusted them to the guardianship of earthbound transcendents and taught them the arts of cultivation.

He then broke a blade of grass and transformed it into a deer, thereby stilling their deluded minds. Later, his two younger brothers concealed themselves in the Western Mountains.

**Observing Fragrance’s liberation from the net, and Xu Ying’s release to the East:**

From *True Records*:
Wang Guanxiang was the daughter of the Numinous King and the younger sister of Qiao. Having received from Qiao the Dao of flying liberation from the net, she entered the mountains with him. After thirty-nine years of cultivation, her Dao was perfected, and she was invested as the Purple Azure Palace Consort, charged with overseeing the Eastern Palace.

From *New Records of the Alchemical Terrace*:
Xu Ying was the elder brother of the Prefectural Historian. Resolutely withdrawing to the mountain forests, he devoted himself to savoring the Dao. Encountering Wang Shilong, he received the Dao of release to the East, practiced the method of reversed circulation, and ingested jade nectar to refine his brain essence. Within two or three years, his face radiated brilliance, his complexion reverted to youth, and he regained his vitality. Only his endowment of qi was meager, preventing him from attaining the highest rank of transcendence. The Director of Destinies, Jingwu, commended him and memorialized the Upper Palace, transferring his name to the Eastern Isle and establishing him as an earthbound transcendent.

**Zhou driving away malevolent spirits, and Liu commanding ghosts and gods:**

From *Records of the Western Mountains*:
Perfected Lord Zhou, whose personal name was Guang and style Huichang, entered Shu and obtained the arts of driving away malevolent spirits and expelling demons, which he used to relieve suffering. Hearing that Perfected Lord Xu in Jingyang was healing illnesses with talismans and incantations, drawing patients from far and near, he journeyed from Yuntai Mountain in Shu to Jingyang to seek an audience, wishing to become his disciple. Lord Xu accepted him, and Zhou mastered all the essential mysteries. Later, he ascended with Lord Xu.

From *Traditions of Divine Transcendents*:
Liu Gen, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, abandoned his official post to study the Dao. Entering a stone chamber in Mount Song, he was questioned by Wang Zhen about the origins of his pursuit of transcendence. Liu replied: “I once entered the mountains to refine my spirit, exploring every method. Later, on Mount Huayin, I saw a person riding a carriage drawn by a white deer, accompanied by over ten attendants and jade maidens bearing colored banners. I prostrated myself twice and begged for a single teaching. The divine person asked: ‘Have you heard of Han Zhong?’ I answered: ‘Indeed, I have.’ The divine person said: ‘I am he.’”

Thus he transmitted to him the essentials of the Dao. The Dao encompasses those who ascend to heaven treading upon clouds, those who wander among the Five Peaks, those who achieve immortality, and those who undergo liberation by means of the corpse. The highest elixirs include the Nine-Turned Cyclically Transformed Cinnabar and the Golden Liquid of the Great One—ingesting these grants immediate ascent to heaven, without the need to accumulate days and months. Next are substances like mica and realgar, which, though they do not immediately allow one to ride clouds and mount dragons, can still command ghosts and spirits, enable transformations, and confer longevity. Below these are the various herbal medicines that cure the hundred diseases, replenish deficiency, preserve youth, and allow one to abstain from grains while replenishing qi, yet they cannot make one immortal.

Li Zhen attained transcendence near and far, while Zhang Hao achieved perfection. From *Traditions of Eminent Daoists*: Li Zhen’s family was exceedingly poor. One day, a Daoist named Zhang Qiwu visited Li, seeking lodging. Li treated him with great generosity. Zhang would often become drunk, sometimes cursing Jin, and would vomit and soil the furnishings. The servants all despised him, yet Li never took offense. Zhang then said to Li: “I have received such generous regard from you. Now, as I depart, would you accompany me for a few miles?” Li went with him. Zhang said: “I have wandered among men for fifty years and have never encountered one as benevolent and kind as you.” Thereupon, he transmitted to Li the arts of transmuting base metals into gold and silver. Li declined, saying his fate was too meager to dare accept such teachings. Zhang, lost in thought, sighed: “Your Dao is beyond what I can attain.” Then, drawing out his hairpin and wielding it as a sword, he traced a line upon the ground, which split open at his touch. He said: “From here, we part.” With that, he cast himself into the earth and vanished. Li marveled at this.

Zhang Hao, during the Yongchu era of the Han, was once summoned by imperial decree to serve as a Daoist among the recluses. At twenty years of age, he was selected for this role. One day, Feng Heng suddenly arrived. Zhang, upon seeing him, prostrated himself in reverence and sought instruction in what he had yet to comprehend. Feng examined his heart and sent him to cross a deep abyss, where he encountered sharks and whales pressing close, yet his countenance did not change. He was tempted with beauty and tested with wealth, yet his heart remained unmoved. Feng said: “He is teachable.” Thereupon, he bestowed upon him the *Azure Waist Purple Script*, the *Golden Root Superior Canon*, and half a tael of divine elixir, admonishing him: “Act, and you shall attain it; neglect, and you shall lose it.” Zhang prostrated himself and received the command. He then entered Mount Chicheng, ingested the elixir, and practiced the Dao. By the Taichu era of Wei, he had achieved perfection.

The noble lady An and the extraordinary guest Sun. From *Declarations of the Perfected*: In the second year of the Xingning era, the Lady of Purple Tenuity descended with Lady An to the chamber of Yang the Perfected. The Lady of Purple Tenuity said: “Today, a noble guest has come to visit.” Lady An, a divine maiden, was the daughter of Lady Li. Formerly, she had gone to Mount Gui to study the Supreme Clarity Dao, whereupon she attained perfection, received the scriptures of the Most High, and was appointed as a Perfected Consort of the Nine Flowers. She was granted the surname An and allowed to wander in the Grand Clarity. *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: Sun Deng was an extraordinary person. He had no family and dwelled in mountain caves and earthen hollows. In winter, he wore only a single garment, and in the bitterest cold, he would let down his hair to cover his body. *Declarations of the Perfected* also records: Sun Deng could produce the eight sounds with a single string—truly an extraordinary scholar.

The Daoist wields a broom of millet, while the master dons a cloth headscarf. From *Records of the Thatched Pavilion*: Yong Fazhi once venerated a stone statue of Lord Lao, reciting the *Tianpeng Mantra* without cease. One night, he dreamed of a divine person taking a broom of millet from before the stone statue and giving it to him, saying: “Whenever there is one who suffers, sweep them with this broom.” Upon waking, he did as instructed. Thereafter, whenever the sick came to him, he would brush them with the broom, and they would be cured instantly. The people of the time praised him, saying: “The Daoist Yong sweeps the blind so they may see, brushes the lame so they may walk.” The afflicted gathered like clouds.

From *New Records of the Elixir Terrace*: Xuanyuan Ji dwelled on Mount Luofu, styling himself the Master of Luofu. It was said he had lived for several hundred years. Whenever he entered the mountains to gather herbs, dragons and tigers would follow in his retinue. He could divide his form and transform his shadow, appearing wherever he willed. Whenever he went out, he carried a cloth headscarf. If he encountered the sick, he would brush them with the cloth, and they would be cured instantly. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Liu and Ruan of Tiantai, Yuan and Liu of Hepu.

From *Records of Divine Transcendents*: Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao once journeyed to Mount Tiantai to gather herbs. Losing their way, they crossed a stream and saw two women of surpassing beauty, who invited them to their home. There they were served sweet wine, sesame rice, and dried mountain goat—all of exquisite taste. The two men lodged in the mountains for half a year. When they returned home, their village had fallen to ruin, and seven hundred years had passed.

From *Tales of Marvels*: During the Yuanhe reign, Yuan Che and Liu Shi of Mount Heng sought to cross the sea by boat from Hepu. Suddenly, a hurricane swept them into the vast ocean, leaving them adrift and directionless. Soon the wind stilled as they reached a desolate island. The two men disembarked, whereupon they encountered two maidens who had transformed from birds. They knelt and pleaded for mercy, begging to return to the mortal world. Taking pity, the maidens led them to pay homage to the Lady of Southern Qi. When they announced their names, the Lady smiled and said, “Once there were Liu and Ruan; now there are Yuan and Liu. Is this not fate?” She commanded the maidens to escort them, gifting them a jade flask inscribed with a poem:

*You came from a single-leaf boat,*
*You depart toward the Hundred-Flower Bridge.*
*If mortals should knock on the jade flask,*
*The mandarin ducks will speak plainly.*

Suddenly, a bridge hundreds of paces long appeared, its railings adorned with rare blossoms. The two men crossed it and arrived at Hepu, but when they turned back, the bridge had vanished. On their way back to Mount Heng, they tapped the jade flask mid-journey, and a pair of azure mandarin ducks spoke: “When you hunger or thirst, walk forward and you shall find sustenance.” Soon after, they encountered a lavish feast laid out by the roadside, which they ate to sate their hunger. Later, they met a scholar named Master Taiji, to whom they showed the flask. The master said, “This is my jade-liquid flask, lost long ago.” Thereafter, the two men followed the scholar to seclude themselves on Zhurong Peak, and it is believed they attained the Dao.

Eyebrows and eyes of Shaojun, nose and mouth of Zirong.
From *Records of Divine Transcendents*: Li Shaojun was a man of Qi who heard that Emperor Wu of Han favored divine transcendents. Shaojun offered the emperor an esoteric method, saying, “Cinnabar can be refined into gold, and consuming it allows one to ascend to heaven.” At the time, the emperor noticed a bronze vessel in his chamber, and Shaojun declared, “This belonged to Duke Wei of Qi.” When the emperor verified the inscription, he realized Shaojun was indeed several hundred years old. His skin gleamed, and his brows, eyes, mouth, and teeth remained as youthful as a child’s.

From *New Records of the Elixir Terrace*: Zhao Qu, styled Zirong, once suffered from leprosy so severe he was near death. Disgusted with himself, he entered the mountains, offering his body to tigers and wolves, never to return. Suddenly, he encountered an extraordinary figure who taught him a method of ingesting medicinal substances. His illness vanished, his body grew light and strong, and at one hundred seventy years of age, he retained a youthful countenance. When he ventured outside, two beautiful women would appear between his nose and mouth, and he could hear the sounds of zither and lute. He lived among mortals for over three hundred years, yet his complexion remained like a child’s.

True Perfection attains the celestial origin; one may dwell and divine by the Dipper.
From *Biographies of Transcendents*: Li Duoduo was the younger sister of the divine transcendent Li Tuo. Following her brother in cultivation, she received from him the essentials of attaining the celestial origin. After a hundred years of practice, she appeared no older than twenty. The Supreme Lord descended to bestow upon her the Way of Ascension. In Shu, there remains a place called Duoduo’s Abode.

From *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: The Daoist Ren Keju, of unknown origin, was forty years old, simple and earnest, carrying a sack in service to the Daoist Xiang Daorong. Moved by his devotion, Daorong entrusted him with the *Mirror of the Celestial Origin* and the *Secrets of the Numinous Treasure*, cautioning him: “Only after eighteen years may you reveal these to others. Their verification of fortune and misfortune must not be sought for glory or profit, nor transmitted recklessly. Those who obtain this Way become divine transcendents; those who leak it meet untimely ends.” Thereafter, Keju gradually began to speak of others’ fortunes. When performing rituals of exorcism or offering, he would first instruct each person to fast and face a wall, where he arranged an image of the Dipper’s bowl. Seated before it, the fortunes and misfortunes of all would become vividly clear.

Li Mi sprinkles garlic; Shu Mao plants leeks.
From *Household Records of the Ye Marquis*: In his youth, Li Mi was so light he could stand atop a screen. A strange figure remarked, “This child will ascend at fifteen.” His parents, alarmed, once detected an otherworldly fragrance in the air and sprinkled garlic juice to prevent him from flying away. As he grew, he practiced grain avoidance and Daoist breathing exercises, his bones crackling like jade. People called him “the boy with gleaming bones.” He once composed a song:

*Heaven covers me, earth bears me,*
*Did heaven and earth intend my birth or not?*
*Else why would I fast and ascend the celestial thoroughfare,*
*Or wander the imperial capital, crying out?*
*How could I remain unexalted and not depart,*
*A mere towering man, empty and proud?*

From *Declarations of the Perfected*: During the Qin dynasty, Jiang Shumao, the Marquis of Baling, came to reside at the foot of Mount Juqu. He cultivated five fruits and five pungent vegetables, selling them to purchase cinnabar for his use. To this day, leeks and chives grow wild in the mountains—perhaps remnants of his planting. He was enfeoffed as a marquis during the reign of King Xiao of Qin, and the place is now called Jiangba.

The Dragon Lord’s Orange Shrine; the Fisherman’s Apricot Altar.
From *Supplement to Biographies of Transcendents*: Liu Yi hailed from the Jiang and Xiang regions. During the Yifeng reign, having failed the imperial examinations, he was returning home when an old friend residing in Jingyang came to bid him farewell. Six or seven *li* from their meeting place, he saw a beautiful woman herding sheep in the wilderness. Finding her intriguing, he inquired about her plight. She replied, “I am the youngest daughter of the Dragon Lord of Dongting. Married to the lesser dragon of the Jing River, I was mistreated by my husband and despised by my in-laws. My father-in-law favored his son and banished me to this place.” She entrusted Liu Yi with a letter, instructing him to deliver it north of Dongting Lake, where a massive orange tree stood—known as the Orange Shrine, worshipped by the locals. Upon arrival, he was to strike the tree three to five times with an object, and the letter would reach its destination. Liu Yi followed her instructions. A warrior emerged from the waves and led him beneath the water, where the palace halls resembled those of an earthly king. There, Liu Yi was detained for days of feasting and revelry.

Upon his return, he was bestowed with rare and wondrous treasures beyond naming or comprehension.

From the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*:
Confucius wandered amidst the black-canopied grove and rested upon the Apricot Platform. His disciples read aloud while he plucked the zither and sang. Before the melody reached its midpoint, an old fisherman descended from his boat and approached. His temples and brows were streaked with white; his hair hung loose, and his sleeves were tucked up. Striding across the plain, he climbed the bank, left hand resting on his knee, right hand cradling his chin, listening until the song’s end.

Zhang drank from the stream; Boyang consumed cinnabar.

From *Supplement to the Biographies of Transcendents*:
Zhang Xie, a native of Wuling, was devoted to learning from childhood. He often meditated upon the Peach Blossom Abbey, yearning to encounter divine immortals and thereby transcend the world. His shorn temples and hidden aspirations remained unspoken. During the Qianfu era, Zheng Kua governed Wuling. Moved by Zhang’s piety in reciting scriptures, he ordered an investigation into his devout practices. Before the ritual’s completion, celestial music arose amid five-colored clouds. After a long while, a chalcedony vial descended from the sky. Zhang received it—within was but water, which he drank to the last drop. Its sweetness was unparalleled. Suddenly, he leapt upward and ascended into heaven.

From *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*:
Wei Boyang entered the mountains to concoct the elixir of immortality, accompanied by three disciples. When the elixir was complete, he knew their hearts were not yet fully resolved. Testing them, he said: “Though the elixir is done, it must be proven with a dog. If the dog flies, it may be consumed; if it dies, it must not be taken.” He fed the elixir to the dog, which died instantly. Boyang declared: “We have forsaken the world, abandoned our families, and entered the mountains. If we fail to attain the Dao of immortality, returning would bring shame. Whether in death or life, I shall consume it.” The moment the elixir touched his lips, he too fell dead. The two remaining disciples exchanged glances and said: “We made the elixir to seek longevity, yet consuming it brings death. What is the use?” They departed to prepare coffins. After they left, Boyang revived, taking with him the disciple who had consumed the elixir—surnamed Yu—and the white dog. Encountering a woodcutter entering the mountains, he penned a letter to his hometown and entrusted it to the two disciples. Only then did they awaken, filled with remorse.

The muleteer pushed open the gate; Hu Zong unlatched the barrier.

*The Traditions of Divine Transcendents* records: Master Huang of Mount Mao was a Daoist of the highest conduct and learning. As he expounded the teachings to a vast assembly, a man suddenly forced his way through the crowd and shouted, “Daoist slave! The day is scorching—why gather this mob? Why not retreat into the deep mountains to cultivate the Dao? How dare you prattle on!” The master made no reply, and after a long while, his countenance softened. He said, “Is it not for funds to repair the temple? Bring forth all your broken cauldrons and miscellaneous iron.” The master followed his instruction. He then ordered a furnace dug into the earth, where the iron was melted in roaring flames. Taking a small measure of medicine, he stirred it in, and after a moment, removing the fire, the molten metal had turned to silver. The master bowed in gratitude, then departed with a smile, vanishing without a trace. Later, someone saw him in the capital, a whip tucked into his belt as he drove a mule, moving as swiftly as the wind. Some called him the “Muleteer.”

*The Comprehensive Mirror of Divine Marvels* states: Hu Yongzong, the Daoist superintendent of the Taiping Abbey in Jiangzhou, had lost his sight and resigned his post. He often had attendants guide him through the abbey. One day, as they reached the gate in heavy snow, someone remarked that a pauper sat by the steps, a piece of malt candy held in his mouth, selling ink at the price of one *jin* per inch. Few buyers came. Yongzong asked the reason, and the man replied, “The snow is too heavy to enter the city, so I rest here—but no one pays me any mind.” Moved with pity, Yongzong gave him fifty *jin* of silver, and this became a daily practice. One day, the man knocked at the gate to take his leave, but the barrier remained bolted. Speaking through the door, he said, “I gift you an inch of ink—keep it for yourself and use it as you will. If you have any left, grind and drink it, and your suffering will end.” Yongzong thanked him and asked his name. The man replied, “My name is on the signboard where I sell ink.” He placed the ink down and departed, his voice fading into the distance. When Yongzong unlatched the gate, it was too late. He ground the ink and drank it, and at once, his eyes regained their clarity. Some later noted that the character for “ink” (*mo*), when split by a vertical stroke, forms the character *lü* (吕), suspecting the man was Lü Dongbin.

Shen Bin’s stone outer coffin and Yuan’s bronze inner coffin are recorded thus: *Miscellaneous Records of the Jia Clan* states that Shen Bin, a gentleman of the sixth rank, was devoted to the Dao from youth. As he neared death, he instructed his sons, “The hall where I reside marks an auspicious site—bury me there.” His descendants dared not disobey. When they prepared the grave, they uncovered a stone outer coffin, spacious and broad, along with three exquisitely carved blue-stone lotus lamps. An inscription read: *“In the second year of Kaicheng, though opened, it was not sealed. The lacquered lamps remain unlit, awaiting Shen Bin’s arrival.”* Later, he was seen dwelling in the Heavenly Treasure Grotto of West Mountain.

*The Memorial Hall Record of Lord Yuan* states: Lord Yuan was a man of the Later Han. According to the *Northern Qi Imperial Digest of Literature*, when Yangxian County was first established, Yuan Yi of Kuaiji possessed divine foresight. He became its magistrate, foretelling floods and droughts. He claimed that upon death, he would become a god, and sometimes slept for days on end, dreaming of feasting with spirits. One day, without illness, he suddenly died. After his burial, a storm darkened the skies, and his coffin vanished. That night, villagers heard the sound of thousands on Jingnan Mountain. At dawn, they found the coffin there and rushed to report it to the county. By the time officials and commoners arrived, the coffin had been divinely concealed, leaving only a stone altar and stone chamber. The mountain was renamed Lord’s Mountain, and today it is called Bronze Coffin Mountain, for it is said that when Lord Yuan died, Heaven sent down a bronze coffin—much like the jade coffin that descended for Wang Qiao when he was magistrate of Ye.

A purple cloud riding the wind, a yellow plum falling into a well: *Records of Marvels* tells of the twenty-fourth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, when the imperial court resided in the Eastern Capital. Li Kuo was appointed prefect of Henan. On that day, a great wind arose, and a female Daoist rode the gale to the Jade True Abbey, alighting upon the bell tower. A throng gathered to witness her. Word reached the prefect, who, a man of blunt disposition, was enraged by the crowd. He stripped her and flogged her, yet she neither pleaded nor showed injury, her complexion unchanged. Kuo was astonished and began to treat her with reverence. He reported the matter to the throne, and she was summoned to the inner palace. When asked her origin, she revealed herself as a female Daoist from the Purple Cloud Abbey in Puzhou. She had abstained from grain for so long that she grew light, and the wind had carried her here. Later, another great wind arose, and she flew away, never to return.

*The Extensive Records of the Strange* recounts: In Huangmei County, a female Daoist named Zhang Lianqiao was eight or nine years old. One day, while fetching water with a jar, she saw a lotus blossom the size of a small plate rising from the well. When she reached for it, it receded; when she withdrew, it emerged again. This happened several times before she fell into the well. Her family, alarmed by her prolonged absence, searched and found her standing atop the well water. Thereafter, she ate nothing, and her parents allowed her to leave home and become a Daoist. At eighteen, as she sat alone in the abbey one day, she saw coins raining from the sky, followed by yellow medicine. She swallowed two pellets and felt her spirit and vitality double. Lu Cong summoned thunder, Wang Xiang divided his shadow: *Further Accounts of Transcendents* tells of Ye Qianyao, styled Lu Cong, who possessed profound Daoist arts. During a drought, the people begged him to pray for rain. He burned incense and made his petition, and in an instant, rain fell. When someone asked him to command thunder, he scraped the ground with his foot, and a rumbling arose from beneath the earth. One day in the city, he suddenly shouted and brandished his arms to display his power. When questioned, he replied, “I saw a fire breaking out in such-and-such a place and went to extinguish it.” Investigation confirmed his words.

*The Traditions of Transcendents* states: Wang Xiang was born with exceptional intelligence. Every day, he gazed at the high peaks of Mount Zhongnan and told his parents, “When I grow up, I will dwell upon this mountain.” People held him in high regard. Upon coming of age, he had no desire for office, devoting himself to sitting in forgetfulness and mirroring the void. He encountered the transcendent Master Meng, who taught him Daoist arts, enabling him to transform his body and divide his shadow.

A single river of clouds from Xie, ten thousand acres of waves from Wang: *Collected Accounts of Transcendents* records that Xie Ziran of Guozhou abstained from grain and often spoke of Daoist matters in lofty and extraordinary terms.

When Prefect Han Yi arrived in the commandery, he suspected her claims were false and summoned her to the prefectural seat, where he confined her for months. When he finally ordered the doors opened, she emerged with her complexion and form unchanged. Han Yi then had his daughter formally become her disciple. Later, on Mount Dafang, he established an altar and invited the Daoist priest Cheng Taixu to prepare the *Record of the Three Caverns*. He also relocated Ziran to reside within the city walls.

In the ninth year of Zhengyuan, Prefect Li Jian assumed office. Ziran told him, “Dwelling in the city is not suitable; I wish to live among springs and rocks.” Li Jian then built a chamber for her on Mount Jinquan. One day, she visited the prefectural seat to bid Li Jian farewell, then ascended to heaven in broad daylight on Mount Jinquan. Thousands of men and women witnessed it, and in an instant, five-colored clouds stretched across the entire valley.

*The Ink Guest’s Waving Rhinoceros* records: Wang Pingfu, during the *guichou* year of Xining, was on night duty at the Chongwen Library when he dreamed someone invited him to the sea. There, he saw a magnificent central palace where music played—pipes, flutes, and drums—with many attendants. The palace was inscribed *Palace of Lingzhi*. Pingfu wished to go with them, but someone beside the palace called across the water, “The time has not yet come. For now, return; one day, we shall welcome you.” At that moment, he awoke with a start, just as the palace bell tolled. He composed a poem:

*A thousand acres of waves, leaves flying on the wind,*
*Pipes and flutes in the palace named Lingzhi.*
*Wielding the brush, not as one of this mortal world—*
*At the toll of the Chang’an bell, the dream breaks.*

Iron fan of Xiuchuan, golden cakes of Guanfu.

*The Idle Tales of Rustics* states: Peng Xiao, a Gentleman of the Ministry of Rites, styled himself Xiuchuan and took the sobriquet True Unity Master. He often told others, “I am a descendant of Qian Keng. Though my family has produced those who attained the Dao, I, though clad in red and purple and enjoying official emoluments, have never slackened in my cultivation. I shall become a lofty figure of this age and never descend to the realm of lesser ghosts.” When he governed Jintang County, he would ride a white ox to and from Changli Mountain, as if seeking a place of true communion. Often, white cranes flew and cried around him. Xiao annotated the *Scripture of Yin Conformity* and explicated the *Triple Concordance*. Whenever he inscribed talismans—calling them “iron fans”—those who consumed them would recover from illness.

*The Collected Accounts of Transcendents* records: Huang Guanfu was poor and often burned willow leaves as incense, subsisting on plants and eschewing the five grains. When her family pressed her to marry, she suddenly told her parents, “There is something extraordinary in the well before our gate.” They went to look, and the water surged violently. She then leapt into the well and did not emerge for a long time. When they dragged her out, they found an ancient statue of the Heavenly Worthy, its appearance identical to hers. The water immediately stilled. They placed the wooden statue by the roadside, and Guanfu returned home weeping. Her mother came to see her, and though she longed for her daughter, suddenly colorful clouds and celestial music descended into their courtyard, accompanied by a grand procession. Three women appeared and said to her parents, “Your daughter was originally an immortal of the Upper Clarity. For a minor transgression, she was banished to the mortal realm. Now that her term is complete, she returns to heaven. Do not grieve.” They added, “This year, pestilence will claim many lives. Move your family to Yizhou to avoid the coming calamity.” They left behind several golden cakes before ascending to heaven.

At Sha Park, she flexed her graceful wings; in Huayang, she nurtured her pinions.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: West of Yizhou City stood a Daoist abbey, where none but dedicated practitioners would reside. Xu Zuoqing once called himself a Daoist of Mount Qingcheng, visiting three or four times a year. On the Double Ninth Festival during the Tianbao era, Emperor Minghuang hunted at Sha Park and saw a lone crane soaring through the clouds. He shot it down with an arrow, but the crane, though struck, descended slowly, its wings still agile as it flew southeast. That very day, Zuoqing arrived with the arrow in hand, his countenance troubled. He told others, “While traveling in the mountains, I was unexpectedly struck by this object, but I am unharmed now. This arrow is not of mortal make. By next year, its owner will come here, and I shall return it.” He left it on the rear wall and inscribed the date: the ninth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year. When Minghuang fled to Shu, he visited the abbey and, seeing the arrow, ordered it brought to him. It was indeed his own imperial arrow. Astonished, he inquired further, and the Daoist answered truthfully. Thus, he realized that the crane he had shot in Sha Park the previous year was none other than Xu Zuoqing. Upon examining the inscription, he also understood how Zuoqing had flown from Sha Park to this very place. Today, there stands Flying Immortal Ridge, said to be where Zuoqing alighted with the arrow, and below it lies the abbey of Flying Immortal.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Jiang Shumao, once the Marquis of Baling, abandoned his post to cultivate the Dao in Mount Juqu. In a letter to his colleagues, he wrote, “I once studied the Way at Guigu, attained it at Shaoshi, nurtured my wings in Huayang, and awaited my ascension at Yicheng. Now, riding the whirlwind’s chariot, I rest in Juqu, awakening to the swift passage of time. Feng Chang turns yellow to return to the primordial; Shi Jing guards the white within the black.”

*The Declarations of the Perfected* further records: Feng Chang, styled Yanshou, mastered the arts of yin-yang and divination by fifteen. Moved by the teachings of Perfected Deng, he could reverse yellow to red and his face took on a jade-like luster. Upon achieving the Dao, he became the Perfected One of the Western Peak. As for Chen Shijing, he guarded the Way of the Mysterious White, sitting outdoors each dawn to visualize the black qi of the Mud Pill, the white qi of the heart, and the yellow qi of the navel—three qi arising like clouds to envelop his body, transforming into fire that burned through him inside and out. He practiced this daily, circulating qi twenty times before ceasing. As the saying goes: “Know the white, guard the black, and death cannot claim you; know the black, guard the white, and all evil vanishes.” Shijing later attained immortality.

Fei Yun spiraled in radiant ascent; Qi Xia blazed in splendor.

*The Continued Biographies of Immortals* tells of Fei Yuanjing, who was serene and indifferent from childhood. When she vowed to enter the Daoist path, her parents said, “A daughter must have a home.” They forced her to marry Li Yan, and for months, the couple lived as respectful guests. One day, she told her husband, “The immortals forbid me to be your wife. Let me sever ties and dwell alone.” That midnight, voices of laughter were heard in her chamber, and her husband, suspicious, secretly observed—only to find the room filled with light. At dawn, she bade him farewell and departed, enveloped in swirling clouds and mist, as immortal maidens played celestial music to accompany her ascent.

The Qi family’s Xiaoyao was devoted to the Way, reciting scriptures without cease. When she ascended, her parents compelled her to marry Ji Xun, but she secluded herself in a chamber, fasting and meditating in stillness, beyond mortal comprehension. One night, a thunderous crack split the roof, and only her robes remained within. Looking up, they saw clouds and radiance blazing as Xiaoyao ascended.

The Upright Rustic and the Luminous Recluse.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Master Wu Jun, styled Zhengjie, arrived in the capital during the early Tianbao era and was registered among the Daoist clergy. He entered Mount Song to study under Master Pan Zheng and master its teachings. Minghuang, hearing of his reputation, summoned him for discourse and was greatly pleased. When the emperor later inquired about the Dao, Wu replied, “Of all teachings on the Way, none surpass the *Five Thousand Words of Laozi*.”

The emperor further inquired about the methods of divine transcendents for refinement and alchemy. Wu replied, “Such are the affairs of rustics—pursued over years and months, not matters a sovereign should fix his mind upon.” Whenever Wu expounded, he spoke of the teachings of names and the affairs of the world, subtly admonishing the Son of Heaven with veiled words. The emperor held him in high regard.

The Daoist Li Hanguang was skilled in seal and clerical scripts, and some claimed he surpassed his father. Upon hearing this, Wu never wrote another character in his life. Later, when studying under Master Zhengyi, he received the treasured cloud-seal scriptures, which the master entrusted to him without reserve, saying, “Li Hanguang is a true guest of the Jade Clarity.”

Hidden in pillars, distant as Luo; entering diagrams, willows take form.

*The Unofficial Histories* records: The Daoist Luo Gongyuan was once summoned by Minghuang, who asked him about the arts of invisibility. Luo replied, “Your Majesty has already been inscribed in the jade registers and golden tablets of the Nine Clarities—how could one of such weight for the altars of soil and grain lightly indulge in petty arts?” Enraged, the emperor reviled him, and Luo fled into a palace pillar, repeatedly exposing the emperor’s faults. The emperor grew even angrier and split the pillar to pursue him. Yet when he looked, Luo had entered a jade tablet, which the emperor shattered into a dozen pieces—each bearing Luo’s form. The emperor apologized, and Luo returned to his original state. Though pressed relentlessly, Luo eventually taught the emperor some arts but refused to reveal their full defense.

The emperor tested Luo by commanding him to conceal himself, yet Luo’s sash and belt remained visible, and at times his shadow flickered forth. Enraged, the emperor ordered his execution. Later, the eunuch Fu Xianyu returned from Shu and encountered Luo, who engaged him in conversation. From his sleeve, Luo produced a letter and a bundle of *dang gui* from Shu to be delivered. Xianyu presented these to the emperor, who grew deeply remorseful. At the close of the Tianbao era, the emperor indeed fled to western Shu—thus the *dang gui* was no false token.

From the *Youyang Miscellany*:
In the Zhengyuan era, the painter Ning Cai depicted the *Gathering in the Bamboo Grove* with such skill that when the scholars Guo Xuan and Liu Cheng sat as guests, they often clashed in displays of *qi*. Suddenly, Liu turned to the painting and said, “Today I shall offer you a modest feat: without applying the five colors, I will make its brilliance surpass all others. How would that be?” Guo scoffed in disbelief. Liu replied, “I shall enter the painting itself to refine it.” With that, he leapt up, vanished into the scroll, and was gone. The guests were aghast. The painting hung upon the wall, and though they searched thoroughly, they found nothing. After a long while, a voice spoke: “Master Guo, do you believe now?” The sound seemed to issue from within the painting. Moments later, Liu’s eyes flashed open as he plummeted from the scroll. Pointing to the image of Ruan Ji, he said, “My efforts have only just reached this.” The onlookers examined the painting and saw that Ruan Ji’s likeness alone had transformed—his lips appeared as if caught mid-whistle. Ning Cai, beholding this, no longer recognized his own work. Convinced Liu had attained the Dao, he and Guo expressed their gratitude, and within days, Liu vanished without a trace.

Zixu studied the ancients; Taojun was learned in the classics.

From the *Records of the True Realm*:
Master Ji, the Celestial Master, bore the name Qiwu and the style Zixu. He was well-versed in ancient learning and the classics. At one time, the Buddhist monk Fanzhen inquired about the origins of the Daoist and Buddhist teachings. The Master distinguished their differences, saying: “The Dao has no before or after—its depths defy all discourse. Laozi embodies the immortal Dao of longevity, belonging to the Left Office of the Most High. Thus Laozi was born from the left armpit, raising his hand to the left, which is why the left is revered in our methods. Our teachings prescribe the wearing of yellow, for yellow is yang. Those who attain the Dao hold life and death in their own hands, moving freely without restraint. Though the great kalpas may end, our Dao will never perish. The Crown Prince, however, embodies the Dao of rebirth and the Dharma of extinction, belonging to the Right Office of the Most High. Thus the Prince was born from the right armpit, raising his hand to the right, which is why the right is revered in their methods. Their teachings prescribe the wearing of black, for black is yin. When one’s allotted span is exhausted, death follows. Though these two paths diverge, they converge in the Most High—yet none but the perfected may fathom their mysteries.” Those who heard him were filled with admiration.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Taoist Master Tao, styled Wengzhong, began his career as a district officer, assisting in the propagation of classical learning. In his later years, he served as Prefect of Jiaozhou, where he encountered Shu Guoyouping and ingested the Ninefold Essences. He refined his qi to fortify the stellar guardians within his heart. Through continued cultivation, he attained the Dao and now dwells in the grotto-heavens. Fire-seal Master Teng and Lamp-stand Lord Xu.

*The Wine-Jar Dialogues of Mianshui* records: When Attendant Censor Teng Zongliang was stationed as Prefect of Liyang, he heard of a reclusive adept living deep in the mountains. Seeking him out through rugged and remote paths, Teng found the man just awakening from sleep. The adept rose, bowed, and invited Teng to sit beside him. Their conversation was profoundly reasoned. Teng inquired how long the adept had lived in the mountains. The man replied that he had fled the ravages of war and lived there alone; he knew spring by the blossoming of flowers, autumn by the falling of leaves, winter and summer by the extremes of cold and heat.

After some time, the adept turned to Teng and said, “The day is drawing late, and you must be hungry. There are mountain yams and wild chestnuts to sustain you.” He then kindled a fire from pine needles, roasted the yams and chestnuts, and offered them to Teng. After eating, he asked, “Does gathering firewood with your hands not trouble you? Would you like me to give you a fire-bell?” The adept smiled and said, “Living long in the mountains, I have grown content with simplicity. I do not wish my heart to be enslaved by things—such a bell would be of no use.”

As dusk fell, Teng departed with a sense of melancholy. Later, when he sent someone to inquire again, the adept had vanished without a trace.

*The Record of the Western Mountains*: Master Xu the Perfected, together with Lord Wu, returned to Yuzhang and thereupon went back to Mount Xiaoyao. Day after day, he expounded the Dao to his disciples and admonished the villagers, so that all turned toward goodness and shunned transgression, and benevolence and filial piety flourished. Once, a man came to the mountain to sell an iron lampstand, and the Perfected Master purchased it. That night, using it as a lamp to illuminate a chipped and peeling spot, he examined it closely and saw that it was in fact gold. He promptly sought out the man and returned it to him. When Bo Ci’s illness was cured, he paid homage with propriety and felt his body grow light.

*The Declarations of the Perfected*: Fan Bo Ci suffered from a perverse and taxing illness that lingered for years. Though he spent his family’s wealth in search of a cure, the malady persisted. Thereupon, he resolved to enter the Dao and abandon the secular world, devoting himself to quiet sitting and self-cultivation. After fifty days, his illness was cured. He then entered Mount Tianmu, where for nineteen years he ingested pure essences and concentrated his thoughts. Moved by his sincerity, perfected immortals descended and bestowed upon him an elixir. After consuming it, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight and was appointed as the Perfected of Primordial Unity. On Mount Heng, there was a Daoist practitioner named Zhang Lizheng who, upon first encountering Lord Wang of Xicheng, received from him an elixir formula. After ingesting it, his eyes grew bright and his body light, and he could walk five hundred *li* in a day. The August Lord of Shuanghua dispatched a messenger to welcome him, and he ascended on clouds in broad daylight. Emperor Wu of Han had four excesses; the Yellow Emperor mastered seven flavors.

From *Miscellaneous Records of Immortals’ Biographies*: The envoy of Yuezhi said to Emperor Wu, “Excessive seeing breeds arrogance, excessive speech invites calamity, excessive thought fosters lust and treachery, and excessive adornment leads to extravagance. No ruler who indulges in these four excesses has ever brought order to the realm.”

From *The Inner Transmission of the Yellow Emperor*: The Queen Mother bestowed upon the Emperor the sevenfold refinement of *mei*. The Emperor asked, “What are the seven *mei*?” The Queen Mother replied, “When the eyes are *mei*, they do not see clearly; when the ears are *mei*, they do not hear keenly; when the mouth is *mei*, it lacks discernment; when the nose is *mei*, it does not breathe freely; when the hands are *mei*, they lack steadiness; when the feet are *mei*, they do not walk rightly; when the heart is *mei*, it is not true. But if the heart is not disordered, it is true; if the eyes are not *mei*, they see clearly; if the ears are not *mei*, they hear keenly; if the mouth is not *mei*, it is discerning; if the nose is not *mei*, it breathes freely; if the hands are not *mei*, they are steady; if the feet are not *mei*, they walk rightly. Thus, the essence of the seven *mei* lies in one. If that one falters even slightly, the other six become obstructed, and the whole body falls into disorder, nearing death.”

Huang Jue saw off a guest; an immortal breeze attended the gathering. From Liu Gongfu’s *Poetry Talks*: Huang Jue was skilled in poetry. Once, he saw off a guest beyond the capital gate, but upon arrival, the guest had already departed too far to catch up. At an inn, he saw a Daoist priest beside him and invited him to share the wine and dishes he had brought. After they finished, the Daoist lifted a vessel, scooped water, and wrote the character *lü* (吕). Huang Jue then realized he was Lü Dongbin. The Daoist said, “Next year, you will meet me in Jiangnan.” Huang Jue indeed obtained an official post in Jiangnan. When the time came, he saw the Daoist take from his robe seven large coins, followed by three small ones, and say, “This number cannot be increased.” He also gave Huang Jue a medicine of several *cun* in length, instructing, “On New Year’s Day, grind it with wine and consume it to prevent illness for a year.” Huang Jue followed his words. By age seventy, the medicine was nearly exhausted, and he wrote a poem: *“The almanac’s days are few, / Counting on my fingers, next year I’ll be seventy-three.”* He indeed passed away that year.

From *Miscellaneous Records of Immortals’ Biographies*: Liu Xianfeng was a Daoist of Jiulong who entered Mount Bailu and was granted esoteric defenses by a divine person. At Dasnow Temple on Mount Pengkou, a great assembly was held. Xianfeng and over ten Daoist companions attended but paid no formal respects. As soon as they departed, a commotion erupted among the assembly, with cries of alarm: beyond the fence, over thirty tigers roamed freely, causing such panic that the crowd could not eat. The monks, realizing it was Xianfeng’s doing, had everyone bow in apology with incense. The tigers then dispersed.

Xie Yuanqing’s *unicorn fat*; Jie Xiang’s *fin sashimi*. From *Further Biographies of Immortals*: Xie Yuanqing encountered divine immortals who served him *phoenix-crown millet*, *dragon-essence rice*, *unicorn fat*, *striped-glass marrow*, *Black Continent white nectar*, *Void Cavern sacred melons*, *Fusang cinnabar stalks*, and *Qing River patterned algae*. They also offered *jade-rice wine*, *cassia brain*, and *rue blossoms*, played the *eight jade chimes*, the *cloud-cluster sheng*, and the *cavern-yin qing*, performed the *Primal Harmony* song, and danced the *revolving phoenix* and *soaring simurgh*. From *Extensive Records*: Jie Xiang, styled Yuanze, discussed with the King of Wu which sashimi was finest. Xiang said, “The *zi* fish from the sea is supreme.” He requested a square pit be dug before the palace hall and filled with water. Xiang cast his line into the pit and, in the time it takes to eat a meal, caught a *zi* fish and prepared sashimi.

Empress Zhang’s broken nail; Guard-One’s shattered lump. From *Records of Responses*: Empress Zhang, mother of Emperor Wu of Chen, once received a small tortoise from a Daoist, its shell radiant with five colors. The Daoist said, “In three years, there will be a sign.” When the time came, the Empress gave birth, and purple light filled the chamber. The tortoise had vanished. The Empress was beautiful from youth, with fingernails five *cun* long, their color a blend of red and white. Whenever she observed mourning rites for a relative, one nail would break first. From *Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*: Wang Shouyi, in the early Zhenguan era, styled himself “Wang the Layman of Mount Zhongnan” and sold medicine in Luoyang. A wealthy man, Liu Xin, had a son born with a lump of flesh above his brow. Shouyi gave him a pill from his gourd, and in an instant, the lump burst open, revealing a small, brilliantly colored five-colored snake over a *zhang* long. Shouyi shouted at it, and the snake leapt up, shrouding the sky in mist. Shouyi mounted the snake and departed.

Wang Ni’s flying steps; Xu Que’s ascent. From *Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*: Wang Ni was the teacher of Nie Que and attained the Dao between the eras of Fuxi and Shennong. The Yellow Emperor met him and received the essentials of the Dao. He lived through the reigns of Shaohao and Zhuanxu, often wandering among mortals and practicing the *flying steps*. He was still seen in the time of Yao and Shun, then ascended to heaven one day later. From *Elegant Talks of Prefectural Pavilions*: The Perfected Xu Que, in the late Tang, visited the Zhaoxian Abbey on Mount Nanyue and inscribed a song on the wall: *“The great furnace refines human nature and fate, / Tools differ, but all destinies are fixed. / Demons and specters vie in supernatural arts, / Yet only harm the wicked, not the upright. / A babe just learning to walk / Knows only the sun and moon rise east and west. / But by the might of the myriad spirits, / The moon moves south, the sun north. / Jade is jade, stone is stone— / Buried deep in mud, they never change. / Deng Tong starved to death, Yan Guang lived in poverty— / Are emperors truly powerless? / A man of ambition, unrecognized, should not force his way, / Clinging to dragons and phoenixes wastes the spirit.”* Several days after writing this, he ascended. Zichang’s virtue aligned; Tunan’s Dao perfected.

**The True Sayings**: The Supreme Perfected One told the Prefectural Governor: “I have seen Lu Zichang of Nanyang—a man of pure simplicity, untaught and uninitiated, yet aligned with Heaven and resigned to fate. Though he knew nothing of the methods of cultivating life and committed no evil, his virtue harmonized with the natural order. Though he did not prolong his years or transcend the world, at death he ascended to the Hall of Blessings, refined his spirit, and received qi. His name was recorded in the Emperor’s register, and now he serves as a Gentleman for Cultivating Literature. Such was his inborn destiny, a blessing flowing from the accumulated virtue of his ancestors. Had he grasped the principles of nurturing life and practiced the Supreme One’s secrets, his pursuit of the Dao would have met with unbroken success.”

**Records of Eminent Daoists**: Chen Tunan, styled *Tunan*, failed the imperial examinations and roamed mountains and rivers for over twenty years. One night in his courtyard, he saw a golden-armored spirit holding a sword, who said: “Your Dao is perfected. You shall have a place of return and completion.” The Master asked: “What is this place of return and completion?” The spirit replied: “It is where all treasures gather in autumn. Shall I not withdraw to the West?” He then moved to dwell on Mount Hua.

*Pure Wind* notes: “Xue Ji admonished like a comet’s warning.”

**Miscellaneous Records of the National Histories**: The Tang Grand Astrologer Li Chunfeng was revising the new calendar when he predicted a solar eclipse on the day of the new moon’s conjunction. The omen was inauspicious, and Emperor Taizong was displeased. “If the sun does not darken,” he said, “what will you do?” Chunfeng replied: “If it does not, I will accept death.” On the appointed day, the Emperor sent a messenger to the courtyard to tell Chunfeng: “I grant you leave to bid farewell to your wife and children.” Chunfeng replied that it was still early by a quarter-hour and pointed to the shadow on the sundial: “When it reaches here, the eclipse will occur.” As he foretold, the sun darkened, not deviating by a hair’s breadth.

Chunfeng once memorialized: “The seven stars of the Northern Dipper will transform into humans. Tomorrow, they will drink wine in the Western Market. You should send someone to await them.” The Emperor followed his advice. A messenger was dispatched, and seven Brahmin monks entered through the Golden Light Gate, ascending to the upper floor of a wineshop in the Western Market. The messenger mounted the stairs and announced: “I have come to invite the masters to the palace.” The foreign monks glanced at one another and laughed: “That little boy Li Chunfeng speaks of us!” After drinking, they descended, but the monks had vanished.

**Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals**: Xue Ji, a native of Fenyin in Hebei, later resided in Weizhou. He left the secular world to become a Daoist and was versed in astronomy and calendrical science. When Emperor Taizong was preparing to perform the Feng and Shan sacrifices, a comet appeared, and Xue Ji admonished him, halting the rites. His prognostications of auspicious and inauspicious events always aligned with Li Chunfeng’s. Later, he died without illness, and wondrous fragrances, clouds, cranes, and celestial music filled the air—seen and heard by all at the foot of the mountain and within the abbey. When his coffin was interred, it was found to be empty.

*Master Hua of the Great Empyrean* wandered far in the Upper Clarity.

**Declarations of the Perfected**: Lü Zihua of Shanyang was a disciple of the Dark Lord. He ingested the liquid of rainbow cinnabar but had not yet studied the *Inner Canon*. He came to the Supreme Lord to receive the *Hidden Writ of the Great Empyrean* and recited it, delighting in secluded chambers and square terraces, yet never aspiring to the ranks of immortality.

Xu Yuan’You, styled *Far Wanderer*, was the elder brother of the Prefectural Governor. A man of pure emptiness and Daoist inclination, he dwelled in the wilderness and encountered an extraordinary person who taught him the method of reversing the flow. He ingested jade liquid and refined the essence of the brain, his face glowing with radiance, his youth restored. In the Yonghe era of the Jin, he withdrew into reclusion and never returned. Later, he dwelled on the central peak of Mount Dadi. When his elixir was completed, jade lads and white deer descended to welcome him. The Southern Ling Abbey now marks his former abode.

**Gongfang licked sores; Zhang Cang sucked milk.**

**Biographies of Divine Transcendents**: Li Babai was a man of Shu, eight hundred years old—hence his name. Sometimes he concealed himself in the mountains, sometimes he appeared in the marketplace. Tang Gongfang was sincere but had not met a enlightened master. Li wished to test him and posed as a traveling merchant. Gongfang, unaware that Babai was an immortal, treated him with greater care than his other guests, cherishing him deeply. Later, Babai feigned a grave illness, and Gongfang summoned physicians and prepared medicines worth tens of thousands, undeterred by the cost. His concern was written on his face.

Babai’s condition worsened, his body covered in foul, festering sores. He said: “If you lick my sores, they will heal.” Gongfang did so. Babai said: “Your licking cannot cure me. If your wife licks them, they will heal.” Gongfang then had his wife lick them. Babai said: “Now, bathe me in thirty *hu* of fine wine, and I will recover.” Gongfang prepared the wine and bathed him, and his body became smooth as congealed fat, without a trace of sores. Babai then told him: “I am an immortal. Because of your sincerity, I tested you. You are teachable.” He gave Gongfang a volume of elixir scriptures. Gongfang entered Mount Yuntai, compounded the elixir, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

**The Master Who Embraces Simplicity**: During the Han, Chancellor Zhang Cang happened to drink a woman’s milk and lived to one hundred eighty years. This was but a minor method, yet he tripled the lifespan of ordinary men. How much more might one achieve by mastering all the profound and wondrous arts?

**Sand seas and stone medicines; Tangchang’s jade elixir.**

**Records of the Forgotten**: The Yellow Emperor sent Feng Hou to carry books and Chang Bo to bear a sword. At dawn, they wandered the sands of Huan; by dusk, they returned to Yinpu, covering ten thousand *li* in a single breath. The sands of Huan bore a stone leaf with a single stem and a hundred leaves, blooming once every thousand years. The place was also called Shalan, where the sands surged like waves. Within dwelled divine dragons, fish, and giant turtles, all capable of flight. The immortal Ning Feng ate a flying fish and died, but revived after two hundred years. Thus, Master Ning’s *Ode to the Sand Sea* says:
*“The azure leaf gleams, unfolding through a thousand years,
A century’s brief death—eating the flying fish.”*

**Miscellaneous Conversations**: At the Tangchang Abbey in Chang’an, a jade elixir flower drew a constant stream of carriages and horses. One day, a girl of seventeen or eighteen appeared, clad in embroidered robes with trailing sleeves, her countenance graceful and lovely. She was attended by two female Daoists and three young servants, all with topknots, their beauty unmatched. An extraordinary fragrance suffused the air.

She stood for a long while, then instructed a young servant to gather several branches of the flower, saying: "My appointment at Jade Peak awaits—now we may depart." She raised the reins, and in an instant, they were already halfway to the heavens. Only then did they realize this was the journey of divine immortals.

The Daoist shook out his robes; the general raised his whisk.

**Comprehensive Records of Marvels**: A Daoist named Fang, whose full name was lost, secluded himself in the western mountains of Yiyang. In Cizhou stood the Temple of the Protector of the Nation, Spirit of Efficacious Response. Each year in the second and third months, people from across the land presented rare birds and strange beasts, exquisite crafts and wondrous weapons, delicacies and exotic fruits—nothing was wanting. Crowds gathered at the temple’s base, touring, feasting, and reveling until early summer, when the villagers dispersed. Without fail, Daoist Fang arrived every year, always gifting his acquaintances with nine-times-steamed yellow essence. One year, he suddenly did not appear, and all assumed he had moved to another mountain—or perhaps had perished.

In the City God’s Temple of the Spring Capital, behind the deity’s throne, lay a corpse, its body buried beneath over an inch of dust. When officials prepared to examine it, the figure suddenly shook out its robes and rose—it was Daoist Fang. He rejoined his companions for a bout of unrestrained drinking, lingering for over a month before departing. From then on, he never returned.

**Declarations of the Perfected**: The Lord of Life Preservation addressed Yang the Perfected, saying: "Xu was able to entrust his form to the hidden transformation and received the *Night Release* method from Zhang Zhennan." It is said that this Xu was Xu Yuan, whose master served as General of Zhennan. After his corpse-release burial in Linyi, forty-four years later, during the Wei era, a great wind arose, splitting open his wooden coffin. His body appeared as if alive, and when he lifted the tail of his robe to cover his face, he burst into laughter. The divine messengers then welcomed him to Mao Mountain.

The Heavenly King questioned Xu.

**Records of Mount Mao**: Three envoys of the Three Heavens arrived on purple clouds, bearing jade tablets and clad in embroidered robes, bearing the decree to summon the Great Lord Mao to his post at Red City. Today, Mount Mao’s Embroidered Robe Pavilion marks the site where he received the Nine Bestowments.

**Declarations of the Perfected**: The immortal Wang Zideng held the position of Eastern Minister of the Lesser Heavenly Realm. Knowing of Attendant Xu’s reverent solemnity, Zideng inquired of the Eastern Minister: "Where is this man now?" The Eastern Minister replied: "He is from my hometown. Within, his true nature is upright; without, he blends with worldly affairs—truly a man of fine talent. Now he cultivates the supreme Dao."

Plucking flowers to drink wine, striking bamboo to harmonize songs.

**Elegant Talks from the Prefectural Pavilion**: Li Mengfu, during the early Kaiping era of the Liang, served under General Zhong Fu in Hongzhou. Daily, he drank with commoners, composing wild verses in unrestrained abandon. In all seasons, he wore flowers in his hair, dangling a fish from his fishing rod as he strolled through the market, singing the *Fisherman’s Chant* to sell his lyrics. Those fond of such things vied to purchase them, and with the money earned, he would enter a tavern. His verses numbered over a thousand, circulating throughout the lands south of the Yangtze. A couple of examples:

*The temple bell’s toll drifts across distant shoals,
A half-moon’s waning light sinks before the hills.
Slowly I pole my oar, turning back to the bay—
Waves churn the dawn’s brocade into scattered gold.*

And:

*Fisher-brothers, fisher-comrades, joyous in your coming,
The old woman’s shrine sits by the river’s bend.
Coconut-shell ladles, cups of knotted wood,
Boiled perch piled high upon the table.*

Zhong Fu, deeming him mad and a corrupting influence, sought to punish him. In prison, Mengfu silently composed over ten poems, including:

*Plucking flowers to drink wine—what harm in that?
Woodcutters’ songs, fishermen’s chants—no hindrance to the times.*

Zhong relented, sparing him punishment, and sent him away. His whereabouts afterward were unknown.

**Biographies of Divine Immortals**: The Bamboo-Striker, whose surname and given name were unknown, frequented a wine shop in Chengdu. In his hand, he held a bamboo node, striking it to produce a resonant *clang*, singing in harmony with the sound. The words of his songs all aligned with the Dao’s intent. For over a decade, he did this, until one day, he approached a medicine vendor in the eastern market and said to Huang’s son: "I know you, elder, are fond of the Dao. Now I wish to entrust you with a sincere request—would you accept?" Huang replied: "I would hear what you require."

He said: "I am a mendicant scholar, dwelling beneath the Seven Li Pavilion Bridge. Now gravely ill, I shall soon die. On the day of my death, I ask that you burn my body with fire—but take care never to touch my heart."

The next day, Huang arrived at the bridge and found him. The Bamboo-Striker gratefully expressed his thanks, then passed away as his words ended. Huang prepared burial garments and a coffin, interring him before cremating the remains outside the city. At once, an extraordinary fragrance filled the air, thick and lingering, while crows gathered and cried until evening. Only his heart remained unburned, still as large as a dou measure.

As dusk fell, Huang’s son prepared to return home. In haste, he struck the heart with his staff—suddenly, a thunderous explosion erupted, startling men and horses. From the flames emerged a figure over a foot tall: the Bamboo-Striker himself, striking his bamboo node with resonant clarity. The sound soared into the clouds as he vanished from sight.

**A painted hawk, two sighing geese.**

*Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: The Daoist Li Guizhen, active during the late Tang, once visited the Xinguo Abbey in Hongzhou. There, he saw the merit statues in the Three Officials Hall—exquisitely crafted in layered silk by imperial decree of Emperor Minghuang. Yet the caretakers had neglected their upkeep, allowing sparrows and pigeons to soil them with droppings. Guizhen then painted a hawk on the wall, and from that day forward, no birds dared perch there. Later, some witnessed Guizhen ascending to immortality on Mount Luofu.

*Unofficial Records of the Jin*: Dong Yang, styled Zhongtong, was a native of Junyi in Chenliu. During the Taishi era, he traveled to Luoyang but sought neither office nor fame. In the Yongjia period, the ground in the eastern outskirts of Luoyang, near Buguang Alley, collapsed, and two geese emerged. The gray one took flight, while the white one could not. Upon hearing this, Dong sighed: "This was the site of the Di Springs, where the Zhou once held their covenant. Now two geese appear—the gray one symbolizes the barbarians, the white our own state. How can I speak of this fully?" Turning to Xie Kun and Ruan Fu, he said: "The *Book of Changes* says, ‘To know the incipient movements is divine.’ You two should conceal yourselves well." Then, with his wife, he shouldered their belongings and entered Shu. No one knew their ultimate fate.

**Deng Cheng’s serpent sword, Tao Kan’s dragon shuttle.**

*Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals*: Deng Cheng, a native of Linchuan in Fuzhou, came from a family devoted to the Dao. Whenever he burned incense, he would vow to aid the state and uphold the teachings, pursuing the Way on Mount Magu. His kin, hearing of his aspirations, questioned him: "To serve the state requires civil or martial talent. You withdraw to become a Daoist—how will you fulfill such a vow?" He smiled and replied: "This resolve is not something the worldly can comprehend."

One day, as he returned from the mountains to his private residence, he encountered a massive serpent blocking the path midway. Scooping up water, he sighed at it and said: "If you were a dragon, you would soar with the waters—do not obstruct the way." Suddenly, the serpent transformed into a sword, which he took home. Later, a Daoist priest saw it and said: "This is a divine sword." He then taught Deng the method of wielding it.

Emperor Minghuang, deeply devoted to the Dao and its mysteries, widely sought those who could expand its teachings. He summoned Deng to the capital, and one day, during a moment of leisure, said to him: "The fortress of Shibao has become a persistent border concern." Deng replied: "Though I am but a humble rustic, I have received undeserved favor. How dare I not offer my service to ease Your Majesty’s worries?" Thereupon, he lit seven lamps in the shape of the Dipper, burned incense, and prayed in silence. One lamp flew away like a shooting star, and the fortress of Shibao was reduced to ashes.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Tao Kan was the Marquis of Xihe. Once, while fishing, he caught a shuttle, which he hung on the wall. A storm arose, and the shuttle turned into a crimson dragon, leaping out through the roof. This account appears in Liu Qin’s *Garden of Marvels*.

**Jade Spring’s treasure steed, the hibiscus-white mule.**
*The Blue-Green Locks*: Chancellor Liu traveled to the capital to take the imperial examinations. Passing through the town of Single-Log Bridge, an old clerk presented him with a poem: *"This year, ride a poor mule on your way; / One day, you shall return on a treasure steed."* It also said: "You are none other than the Jade Spring Daoist Lord of Mount Luofu."

*Ouyang’s Poetic Discourse*: After Shi Manqing’s death, he appeared in a vision to someone, saying: "Now I am an immortal, master of the Hibiscus City, riding a white mule that flies like the wind." Later, he descended to a scholar’s home and left a poem: *"The orioles’ songs do not fade with spring’s passing; / Flower shadows ever follow the sun’s slow tread."*

**Three Friends of Mist and Vine, Six Recluses of Bamboo Stream.**
*The Declarations of the Perfected*: Zheng Ao, styled Yunshi, sat for the imperial examinations but did not pass. At the end of the Tang dynasty, he cast off his robes and departed, becoming a Daoist on Mount Shaoshi. Two azure youths, a crane, and a zither accompanied him in his wanderings. He befriended Li Zhen, a powerful minister of the Liang court. When Li sought to appoint him to office, Zheng refused. Later, when Li was exiled to the south for his crimes, Zheng walked a thousand *li* to visit him, further elevating his reputation among those who heard of it.

Zheng learned that on Mount Hua, the resin of the five-seeded pine, buried in the earth for a thousand years, transformed into a medicine capable of expelling the Three Corpses. He moved to Mount Hua and, with Daoist Li Daosheng and Luo Yin, formed the "Three Friends of Mist and Vine," known to the world as the Three Eminent Scholars.

In the Tang dynasty, Li Bai excelled in strategic arts and swordsmanship, embracing the life of a knight-errant. He valued generosity and disdained wealth, sojourning in Rencheng, where he joined the local scholars Kong Chaofu, Han Zhun, Pei Zheng, Zhang Shuming, and Tao Mian in residing on Mount Zulai. There, they drank deeply and sang wildly each day, earning the name "Six Recluses of Bamboo Stream."

**Wang Tan cast off his hairpin, Wei Jie returned his sash.**
*New Records of the Cinnabar Terrace*: Wang Tan, styled Yangbo, was a native of Taiyuan. His spirit shone with exceptional brilliance, his inner workings profound and subtle. His numinous insight was all-encompassing, his essence pure and luminous, his radiance ascending the celestial paths, his sincerity congealing before the jade steps. Thus, he dwelled in the jade forest’s emerald shade, where the immortal waves stilled. Truly, he could lift his head to pluck the finest blossoms and crane his neck to enter the realm of purity.

Initially, during Empress Lü’s regency, he held the position of Palace Attendant. When Emperor Wen ascended the throne, Wang cast off his hairpin at the phoenix gates. The Son of Heaven honored the worthy with Daoist rites and called him a "man of leisure."

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals*: Master Wei Jie, during Emperor Xiaozhuang of the Later Wei, served as Prefect of Yangxia. He studied under the Daoist Master Zhao Tong, then returned his official sash to the court and received the sacred texts of the Three Caverns, along with secret divine formulas. Later, he chose to reside on the southern slopes of Mount Hua, where people called him the "Master of Huayang."

**Yan Hall of Ze Min, the bedchamber of Du Chong.**
*Famous Discourses of the Hanlin Academy*: Zhang Zemin died during the Yuanfeng era but later revived. He recounted arriving at a place resembling a realm of jasper and jade, where a hall bore the inscription *Hall of Pure Feasting for the Five Ministers*. He asked the gatekeeper if he might enter, and the keeper replied: "This is where divine immortals gather. You may not enter." Zhang inquired about the names of the five ministers, and the keeper said: "Lü Yijian, Li Di, Liu Chong, Pang Ji, and Fu Bi."

Suddenly, a voice called from within, and a rider emerged, his appearance resembling that of Minister Kui. He summoned Zhang for a conversation. Zhang asked: "Have you now departed the world to become an immortal?" Liu replied: "I am now a local earth deity, akin to a prefect or magistrate among men. My merits and conduct are not yet sufficient—how dare I aspire to immortality? I was overseeing construction, which has just been completed. The windows, halls, and steps are all illuminated by the radiance of kings. I have already commissioned Wang Yuanzhi to compose a record, with Shao Biao providing the seal script."

Zhang asked: "Minister Fu is well—why did this hall appear before him?" Liu replied: "It has been three years now."

*The New Record of the Alchemical Terrace*:

Master Du Chong studied under Master Wen Shi for over a decade. Moved by his devotion, the Perfected One Zhan descended into his bedchamber and bestowed upon him an elixir formula, saying: "The Earth Bureau has reported your merits, and the Old Lord has dispatched me to transmit to you the scriptures of immortality." Chong reverently cultivated and refined the teachings, and his practice bore verification. He could command tigers and leopards, summon and employ spirits, penetrating the hidden and illuminating the obscure—his depths were unfathomable.

Gan Ji healed illnesses, but when his methods became excessive, he fell gravely ill.

*The Records of Jiangbiao*:

During the reign of Sun Ce of Wu, there was a Daoist named Gan Ji who studied Daoist texts and crafted talismanic water to heal the sick. The people of Wu and Kuaiji held him in high regard. Once, when Sun Ce was hosting guests at the commandery tower, Gan Ji hurried through the gate below. Two-thirds of the generals and guests descended the stairs to bow to him, and though they tried to stop them, they could not. Sun Ce immediately had him arrested. His mother said: "Master Gan has aided the army with blessings and healed the generals and soldiers—you must not kill him." Sun Ce did not heed her. Soon after, Gan Ji died, and when they went to bury him, his body was nowhere to be found.

*The Records of the True Realm*:

Master Zhu Junxu, styled Faman, resided at the Jade Purity Abbey. There, he untangled worldly entanglements, upheld the integrity of the Perfect Realization, and secluded himself in a quiet courtyard, lowering the curtains of his empty chamber. His bearing was grand and refined, his composure as serene as the radiance of heaven; his nature was profound and still, his reputation as resounding as thunder across the lands south of the Yangtze.

The original site of the Jade Purity Abbey in the gorge was cramped and bustling, while the ancient altar of Heavenly Pillar Peak lay in a distant, tranquil realm. Thus, he brushed off his robes and departed without lingering, staff in hand, journeying onward. Over the course of several years, though his undertakings remained unfinished, he suddenly fell mildly ill. One morning, he rose with resolve, ordered water for bathing, donned his cap and robes, lit incense, and sat upright. Addressing his disciples, he said: "For me, the span between Peng and Shang, life and death, has long been equal. Yet the subtleties of the Dao are ever still—those who are moved by it attain communion; the workings of the spirit are ever obscure—those who align with it achieve enlightenment. I have spoken of this, and you have understood. As for the scriptures, precepts, and practices, you must strive to uphold them." With these words, he passed away in an instant.

*Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns*, Scroll Thirteen—concluded.
*Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns*, Scroll Fourteen.

Chen Baoguang, Daoist of the Orthodox Unity lineage, compiled and arranged:

*Minor Realms of Clarity and Emptiness; Great Mao of Cold Blossom.*

From *The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*:
Wang Bao, styled Zideng, wore a deer-hide cap and hempen robe, wandering through renowned mountains. His refined devotion moved the vast heavens. One midnight, he suddenly heard the sounds of men and horses in the forest, the clamor of flutes and drums. In an instant, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders emerged, floating in the void. A divine being, borne on a brush of tripled clouds and holding a tiger tally, halted his carriage and declared: "You are recorded in the Supreme Clarity’s register, your name inscribed in golden script upon the Scroll of Flourishing Blossoms. Enrolled in the Clarity and Emptiness, you ascend to the Minor Realms. You shall also oversee the treasury of sacred texts, assuming the office of Heavenly King."

From *Records of Mount Mao*:
Sun Hanhua was the granddaughter of the King of Wu. She cultivated the Dao upon Mount Mao, and upon its attainment, ascended in emptiness, leaving the mountain to be named Mount Hua Lao in her honor.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states:
Hanhua was a disciple of the immortal Du Qi. Practicing the White-and-Primordial method, she attained youthful countenance. Now she dwells amidst the Great Mao peaks, occasionally appearing to those who encounter her.

*Sweet Dew of Wang Xi; Divine Glue of Tian Sheng.*

From *The Secret Records of the Immortals*:
The Perfected Wang Xi, during a great plague, entered Mount Xi to gather herbs, distributing them to save countless lives. One day, he encountered a Daoist who said: "You possess the bones of the transcendent and have accumulated vast virtue." The Daoist then taught him the arts of nurturing wind and drinking dew. One day, sweet dew descended upon the bamboo and trees beside his dwelling. Wang Xi drank it and ascended to heaven.

From *Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals*:
Tian Xian lived in seclusion at Poting. In his youth, he taught at a village school. The daughter of Prefect Qi of Rao, married to a man named Li, conceived within months. Li departed for the imperial examinations in Chang’an. As his wife was about to give birth, she was harmed by a ghost and died. Upon failing the exams, Li returned to Rao. In the wilderness, he encountered his wife, who recounted her fate and said: "Go to Poting and beseech Master Tian—perhaps I may live again." Li followed her words and found the master at the village school, pleading for mercy. The master replied: "But her dwelling has already collapsed." He then emerged from the schoolhouse and called to the earthly officials, asking: "The prefect’s daughter, slain by a ghost in childbirth—her dwelling is ruined. What is to be done?" An official replied: "Only if her hun and po souls are reunited and bound with divine glue will she revive." The wife then lived, and the master vanished without a trace.

*Prophetic Verses of Xia Zhou; Characters of Zhong Shu.*

From *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*:
Li Xiazhou was a man of the Dao. During the Kaiyuan era, he was summoned into the imperial precincts and remained there for a long time. At the end of the Tianbao era, he vanished one day, leaving only prophetic verses on the wall of his dwelling concerning An Lushan’s usurpation and the emperor’s flight to Shu—none could decipher them at first, but all later proved true. The final stanza read:
*"In Yan’s market, all the people depart;
At Han Pass, the horses never return.
Should you meet the ghost beneath the mountain,
Tie a silken sash upon the jade ring."*

"In Yan’s market, all the people depart" refers to the rebellion raised with the troops of You and Ji. "At Han Pass, the horses never return" alludes to the defeat at Tong Pass, where the cavalry of Geshu Han did not come back. "Should you meet the ghost beneath the mountain" contains the character *gui* (ghost), pointing to Mawei Station. "Tie a silken sash upon the jade ring" refers to Lady Yang, whose childhood name was Jade Ring; at Mawei, Gao Lishi strangled her with a silk scarf. All his foresights were of this nature.

From *Pure Discourses from the Jade Flask*:
Guo Zhongshu was unrestrained and unruly, often clashing with others.

In the early years of the Jianlong reign, Nie Chongyi was appointed to the academy, a master of the Confucian tradition in the Central Plains. Once, when Prince Zhao of Han paid him a visit, Guo Zhongshu, drunk and reckless, mocked his surname with a verse:

*"When newly exalted, you’re but a pile of wealth,
Climbing the dragon, you’re deaf by stealth.
Though you have three ears,
Alas, you’re not wise—just hears."*

Chongyi retorted instantly, using the characters *zhong* (loyalty) and *shu* (forbearance) to turn the jest back on him:

*"Do not mock one with three ears,
Far better than harboring two hearts."*

Guo was deeply shamed, and this incident ultimately led to his downfall. Later, accused of slandering the court and misappropriating official goods, he was exiled to Dengzhou. He died en route, and his body was buried by the roadside. Days later, when his kin came to rebury him, they unearthed the grave only to find what seemed a cicada’s molted husk—hardly a thing of this world.

*"The Hollow King feigns death beyond the horse’s field,
A Daoist trick of shedding skin, a ghostly yield."*

There was a Daoist immortal named Wang Lao, whose age none knew. He claimed only the surname Wang, with no trace of his origins. He would appear to die in one place, only to reappear alive in another, often compared to a cicada’s molt. The people called him the Hollow King.

From *Records of Jianghuai’s Strange Folk*:
Sima Jiao, also known as Sima Yi, could walk a thousand *li* in a day with swift strides. His temper was fierce, and none dared approach him. He had the ability to feign death, his body swelling and rotting until it stank, only to revive moments later. Once, he stayed at an inn in Xuancheng, where he summoned the innkeeper to drink with him. After humiliating the man, he bound him in restraints. They grappled until Sima suddenly collapsed—dead, his body cold and pallid. The entire town gathered to gawk. The locals seized the innkeeper, intending to hand him over to the authorities. Evening fell, so they decided to wait until dawn. That night, they heard clamor from the inn: *"Master Sima is gone!"* Only then did they realize he had faked his death.

*"Niu scatters grain for the cuckoo’s call,
Guo strews beans to weave his thrall."*

From *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*:
The Daoist Niu Wenhou was sharp-witted and erudite, well-versed in ancient and modern learning, and often exhorted others to virtue. Each winter’s chill, he would scatter grain upon the earth so that birds and insects might have sustenance. His hidden merits and quiet kindness extended to all—great deeds for humanity, small acts for creatures. Through cultivating himself and accumulating virtue, his practice deepened over time.

From *Biographies of Fang and Wei*:
Guo Pu visited the home of Hu Mengkang, Prefect of Lujiang, intending to depart. Fond of the prefect’s maidservant but unable to obtain her, he took three *sheng* of small beans and scattered them around the house. The next morning, the master saw thousands of red-clad figures encircling his home. As he drew near, they vanished. Disturbed, he asked Guo to divine the cause. Guo said: *"Your household should not keep this maid. Sell her twenty *li* southeast of here, and do not haggle over the price—then this omen will cease."* The master complied. Guo secretly sent someone to buy the maid, then cast a talisman into the well. The thousands of red-clad figures appeared bound, one by one leaping into the well. The master rejoiced.

*"Wang’s flying memorials ascend to the throne,
Zhang’s swift petitions replace the sealed scroll."*

From *Biographies of Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*:
During the turmoil of the Jin dynasty, Wang Zuan pitied the suffering of the people. Each night, he sent flying memorials to the Heavenly Court. Soon, the Supreme Lord descended from the void and said to him: *"Your compassion for the people moves me. I have heard your pleas."* He then commanded an attendant to bestow upon Wang the *Three-Five Fasting Precepts*, saying: *"Practice these diligently, and true immortality may be yours."*

From *Extensive Records*:
Zhang Zhi, a native of Daojiang in Pengzhou, encountered the Daoist Jiang Zhenbian, who taught him the art of commanding the Six Ding spirits. During the Dali era, when the Military Commissioner of Xichuan, Cui Bichang, had an urgent matter to memorialize, he dispatched a rider on horseback. Three days after the courier’s departure, Cui found the original draft still among his documents—the sealed memorial in the case was merely a rough copy. Realizing the courier could not be recalled, he was distraught, not knowing what to do. Learning of Zhang’s skills, he summoned him and explained the situation. Zhang said: *"This memorial can be replaced—no need for worry."* He lit a censer, placed the draft upon the rising incense smoke, and it vanished. Moments later, the sealed memorial fell before him. When the courier returned, he was questioned but knew nothing of the change. The memorial was presented with its seal intact, and Cui was deeply astonished.

*"Shihuang’s dragon needles heal,
Cui Wei’s serpent moxa seals."*

From *Biographies of the Immortals*:
Ma Shihuang was the Yellow Emperor’s equine physician, skilled in diagnosing life and death in horses and curing them without fail. One day, a dragon descended before him, ears drooping and mouth agape. Shihuang said: *"This dragon is ill—it knows I can heal it."* He took his needles and pierced its lips. The dragon then departed. Years later, dragons repeatedly appeared to carry Shihuang away.

From *Extensive Records*:
During the Zhengyuan era, Cui Wei encountered an old woman who called herself Bao Gu. She gave him a small bundle of mugwort, saying: *"For warts and tumors, one moxa treatment suffices."* Then she vanished, leaving Cui perplexed. One evening, he fell into a dry well with no means of escape. Nearby, a white serpent, several *zhang* long, coiled in the shadows. Cui noticed a wart on its lip. A wildfire’s embers drifted into the well, and Cui, recalling Bao Gu’s words, used the fire to moxa the wart. It fell away at his touch. Realizing the serpent was a dragon, he mounted its back. Its body glowed like a torch, ascending into a cave where a blue-robed youth greeted him: *"I am the Jade Capital Lad. I have brought Master Cui here."* Cui asked: *"Who is Bao Gu?"* The youth replied: *"She is Bao Gu, daughter of Bao Guang, wife of Ge Hong. She often practices moxibustion in Nanhai."* Cui, astonished, then asked: *"Who is the Jade Capital Lad?"* The youth said: *"An Qisheng often rides this dragon to the Jade Capital—hence the name."*

*"He begged for Mirror Lake’s grace,
Ge sought the Grotto of Sentences’ embrace."*

From *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*:
He Zhizhang, styled Jiju, was a native of Yongxing in Yuezhou. His nature was open and unconstrained...

At first, he passed the imperial examination and was repeatedly promoted, eventually appointed as Guest of the Emperor and granted the title of Secretariat Director. In his later years, his conduct grew ever more unrestrained and eccentric. At the beginning of the Tianbao era, he fell ill and dreamed of wandering the imperial palace. After several days, he awoke and petitioned to become a Daoist and return to his hometown. The imperial edict permitted his residence to be converted into the Thousand Autumns Abbey. He further requested that an official lake be designated as a release pond for living creatures, and the edict granted him a bend of Mirror Lake in Kechuan. As he departed, the Emperor bestowed a poem to honor his journey, and people likened him to the Two Shu.

From *Biographies of Divine Immortals*:
Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan, originally bore the surname Zhuge. His distant ancestor, having campaigned in the Jiang-Han region, halted at Jurong in Danyang and sighed: *"I alone remain here—what ‘Zhu’ is there?"* Thus, he removed the *Zhu* from his name. The rise of the Ge surname began from this. Ge Hong exhaustively studied classical texts, with a particular fondness for the arts of divine transcendence. His relatives and friends recommended him for his talent and bearing, deeming him fit to oversee the national histories, and he was selected as Gentleman Cavalier Attendant. Ge Hong firmly declined the appointment, citing his advanced age and desire to compound the elixir. Hearing that Jiaozhi produced cinnabar, he sought the post of magistrate of Julou and set out with his nephews and sons.

Lord Gong fended off immortal wine,
His method preceded the divine lamp.

From *Gleanings of the Forgotten*:
Gong Fang of the Tang was a native of Xingyuan Prefecture. In Xingyuan stood Dou Mountain Abbey. From the plain rose a solitary peak, its four faces sheer cliffs, its summit flat as the bottom of a dipper—hence its name. Clad in vines and towering pines, its scenery was wondrous. Once, Gong Fang drank the immortal wine of Li Babai, and his entire household ascended to the heavens from their dwelling. Thus, later generations inscribed these lines:

*With rosy cups raised, drunk and blissful,
Unknowing, the whole household dwelt in crimson skies.
Only the homestead recalled the chickens and dogs left behind—
Who would believe the path to heaven so distant?*

*From the vast Three Clarities, worldly dreams cast aside,
The Eight Radiant Clouds attended the early court.
Only the old grove’s verdant trees remain,
Dew-laden mists sealing the startled autumn wind.*

Today, the ruins of the foundation still stand.

**The New Record of the Elixir Terrace**

Peng Zong, styled Faxian, once studied under the Perfected Master Du Chong. He dwelled in the essence of the Dao, his spirit refined and penetrating. One night as he performed his rituals, several divine lamps floated in the air above his mat, their radiance steady and luminous—all who witnessed it marveled.

He altered his surname and concealed his name to prolong his years.

**The Inner Biography of Master Ma**

Ma Mingsheng, originally surnamed He and styled Junxian, served in his youth as a county clerk capturing bandits. Once, he was wounded by outlaws and nearly died. Suddenly, by the roadside, he saw a woman of sixteen or seventeen, her clothing exquisite and her beauty unmatched. As she passed, Mingsheng knew she was a divine immortal. He kowtowed and begged for healing. The woman gave him a pill the size of a small bean, and upon taking it, he recovered at once. Mingsheng then abandoned his post, changed his name, and followed the goddess to Mount Tai. Recognizing his potential, she had Anqisheng teach him the formula for the Golden Liquid Elixir. Later, Mingsheng ingested the elixir and ascended to heaven.

**Comprehensive Records of the Strange**

When Fan Zhongyan was stationed in Chenzhou, the mother of the prefect fell ill. A Daoist was summoned to present a memorial to the celestial court. Fan laughed and said, "How could a common man deliver a petition to the Emperor on High?" The Daoist held his tablet and prostrated before the altar, remaining motionless all night. When someone touched him, he was stiff as a corpse. At the fifth watch, his limbs stirred slightly. After a long while, he said to the prefect, "Your mother’s lifespan extends six more years. Do not worry over her suffering." The prefect asked, "Why did tonight’s memorial take so long?" The Daoist replied, "Just as I was leaving the Heavenly Gate, I encountered the announcement of next spring’s imperial examination candidates. The onlookers lined the road, causing a delay." Fan asked, "What is the top candidate’s surname?" The Daoist said, "It is Wang. The second character of his given name is smudged with ink, and a note beside it is too faint to read." Later, the prefect’s mother recovered. The following spring, the top candidate was indeed Wang Gongshou, whose name was altered by imperial brush to Gongchen. Only then did Fan believe in the Daoist’s divine communion.

**The Hound of Guigu and the Goose Scripture of Shanyin**

**Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals**

Guigu was a man of the Jin during the reign of Duke Ping. He dwelled in seclusion at Guigu in Songyang and took it as his sobriquet. The master’s surname was Wang and his given name Hua. Su Qin and Zhang Yi studied the arts of horizontal and vertical alliances under him, their cunning and schemes vying for dominance, leaving no room to be transformed by the supreme Dao. As they prepared to depart, the master gave each a single shoe, which transformed into a hound to guide them. By that very day, they arrived in Qin. The master lived among mortals for several centuries before vanishing without a trace.

**Annotations to the Declarations of the Perfected**

Wang Xizhi was the son of Wang Kuang, elder brother of Wang Liao. He possessed an elegant demeanor and excelled in calligraphy. Later, he served as Prefect of Kuaiji. In the eleventh year of the Yonghe era, he left office and never returned to officialdom. He had previously associated with Master Xu and held a deep admiration for the Dao.

**The Jin History** also records: Xizhi loved geese. At the time, a Daoist in Shanyin was fond of raising geese. Xizhi went to observe them and was greatly pleased. He sought to purchase them, but the Daoist said, "Write the *Yellow Court Scripture* for me, and I will present the entire flock as a gift." Xizhi happily complied, completing the writing before carrying the geese home in a basket.

**Pine Seeds of Ban Quan and Lingzhi of Yong Du**

**Biographies of the Immortals**

Ban Quan was a gatherer of herbs on Mount Huai. He favored eating pine seeds, and his body grew fur. He could run as swiftly as if flying, and he lived for three hundred years. Liu Xiang composed an ode for him:

*Ban Quan feeds on pine seeds,
His form at ease, his gaze serene.
His feet tread upon simurghs and phoenixes,
His strides outpace galloping steeds.*

**Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals**

Ge Yongdu often resided on Mount Shangqing in Shu, aspiring to transcend the mortal realm. Beneath a towering pine, a nighttime glow appeared, and he obtained lingzhi shaped like a human figure. After refining and consuming it, he gained the ability to fly and transform. Once his elixir was complete and he ingested it, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Thus, Mount Shangqing came to be called Ge’s Grave Mountain.

**The Celestial Master Subdues Demons; The Perfected Lord Conquers the Ox**

**Biographies of Eminent Daoists**

The Celestial Master Zhang Daoling once battled demons in Chengdu, seizing twenty-four hells and transforming them into courts of blessing. He subdued the twenty-eight constellations to channel the vital qi. At the time, a demon chieftain still resided beneath Mount Qingcheng, where humans and ghosts conducted trade—a place called the Ghost Market. When the Celestial Master arrived, the chieftain transformed into a jeweled throne for him to occupy. Blades could not pierce it, nor could fire burn it. Thus, the demon chieftain submitted.

**Records of the Western Mountains**

When the Perfected Lord Xu Xun returned to Yuzhang, he surveyed the city. Suddenly, a handsome youth who called himself Shen paid a visit. His manners were refined, his speech eloquent. Xu wished to detain him briefly, but the youth abruptly departed. The Perfected Lord said to his disciples, "This is no mortal—it is a clam spirit. Could it have heard of my intent to eliminate harm and come to test me? If I do not slay it, it will surely become a great calamity." He ascended a height to observe its destination, where it transformed into a yellow ox playing on the sands of Longsha. The Perfected Lord then cut paper into a black ox and sent it to fight. He instructed his disciple Shi Cen to take a sword to the scene, cautioning him, "Wait until the oxen are locked in fierce combat, then strike the yellow one." Shi followed the command, severing its left thigh. The yellow ox fled into the well of Hengquan outside the city’s west gate, while the black ox reverted to paper.

**The Pipa Bestowed by Wang; Ji Xian Ascends the Onion Peak**

**Secret Leisurely Conversations**

Wang Baoyi served as Military Controller for Gao Congsi of Jingnan. His daughter refused to eat meat or drink blood, and at the age of five, she could recite the *Yellow Court Scripture*. As she grew, she dreamed of climbing a mountain beside flowing water, where she saw palaces of gold and silver. A voice said it was Mount Fangzhang. Dozens of female immortals appeared and declared, "The Maiden Ma has arranged for us to be sisters." They taught her several pipa tunes. Thereafter, she encountered them every few nights. Over a year, she learned over a hundred pieces, the most exquisite being *Solitary Finger Shang*, played with a single finger. Later, the Maiden Ma appeared in a dream and said, "I shall soon summon you." The next day, clouds and cranes with celestial music filled the courtyard, and she passed away suddenly.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists*: Daoist Xuan Yuanji dwelled on Mount Luofu. Emperor Xuanzong once summoned him to the palace. At the time, the capital had never seen *jing sou* or lychee blossoms. The emperor mentioned this, and in an instant, both flowers appeared—branches and leaves lush and fragrant, as if meticulously arranged.

Daoyuan was skilled in astronomical calculations and memorials written in empty reverence. The original biography states: Qiu Jun, styled Daoyuan, was versed in the numerology of yin-yang and the Supreme Ultimate. In his early years, he wished to visit the Huayang Grotto-Heaven and sought the post of magistrate of Jurong. Upon completing his term, he sent a poem to his Daoist friends on Mount Mao:

*The phoenix’s call invites me to behold your radiant virtue,*
*Yet pine and vine now part from my heart.*
*Moonlight bathes the solitary peak of ten thousand fathoms,*
*While in the ancient halls, no one returns.*

*I long to aid the sagely Tang and Yu in unfolding the Dao,*
*Yet deeply ashamed before Mao and Xu’s counsel to forget worldly schemes.*
*Tomorrow, my light sail departs once more,*
*While purple mushrooms year by year grow fat in vain.*

Jun once told his family, "My lifespan will end at eighty-one." One morning, after rising and washing, he asked for brush and ink and composed a poem on spring grasses. Upon finishing, he sat upright and passed away. That year, he was eighty-one. When his coffin was opened, it was empty—his followers declared it a *shijie* (release by means of a simulated corpse). Chi Shouguang, the prefect, and Minister Teng Gongfu recorded the event. He was buried on Mount Jiuhua. Years later, a yellow-robed messenger arrived in haste at Diyang, bearing a letter from Jun. When his family opened it, the messenger vanished without a trace. The letter read: "I was originally listed among the immortals but was demoted to govern Mount Tai due to errors in my astronomical calculations."

*The Record of Unique Marvels*: During the Zhengyuan era of the Tang, Wang Qiong, magistrate of Danyang, failed his triennial evaluations three times in a row. Deeply distressed, he visited the Daoist Ye Xuzhong on Mount Mao to request a memorial to inquire about his fortune. Xuzhong presented the memorial, which rose with the incense smoke and vanished into the distance. After a meal’s time, it fell back to the ground, its end inscribed in vermilion: *"Having taken a hundred taels of gold, you forfeit three years of official salary. Having wrongfully killed two men, you will face judgment after death."* A year later, Qiong died suddenly without illness.

*Wine may be poured for friends,*
*While fragrant chestnuts are offered in ritual.*

*The Continued Records of Immortals*: Wang Kejiao, a native of Huating in Suzhou Prefecture, made his living by farming and fishing. One day, as he poled his boat along the Song River, he suddenly saw a painted pleasure barge adorned with colorful patterns. Aboard were seven Daoists who called out Kejiao’s name. Startled, Kejiao was led by an attendant with bristling sideburns onto the red deck. Before each of the seven stood a vessel of green jade filled with wine, and the fruits on board gleamed with crystalline clarity. One of them said, "What fine bone structure—yet born into lowly poverty, much of your destiny has already been shattered." Another said, "Give him wine to drink." The attendant poured wine into a goblet, but no matter how many times he tipped the vessel, not a drop emerged. Then one said, "Give him chestnuts." The chestnuts glowed with a greenish light like dates, each about two inches long, their flesh crisp and sweet. A yellow-robed attendant was ordered to escort Kejiao away. As he closed his eyes, he suddenly found himself seated before the Waterfall Temple on Mount Tiantai—half a year had passed since he left home.

*The Seven Signatures of Yunyou*: Yin Wenxiang, styled Daoquan and self-styled Seven-Seven, once attended an official banquet. One day, a performer among the entertainers mocked him. Seven-Seven said to the host, "Shall we make a game of two chestnuts?" The guests all agreed. He passed the chestnuts around, and as each person sniffed them, an extraordinary fragrance filled the air. Only the two who had ridiculed Seven-Seven found their noses stuck fast to the chestnuts, which had turned to stone. They tugged in vain, crying out, "The stench is unbearable!" The two leapt up and began to dance wildly, their hairpins scattering to the ground as they wept in succession, their rouge and powder streaming down. The troupe of performers, swept up in the frenzy, danced in unison, their drumbeats and music falling into perfect rhythm. The song ended, yet the dance continued, and all at the banquet collapsed in helpless laughter. The host pleaded for mercy, and after a while, the stone fell from their noses, and their hairpins, rouge, and powder were restored as before.

The maiden Hua’e, the Perfected Lady of the Primordial.
*The Record of Forgotten Tales*: During the reign of King Zhao of Yan, the kingdom of Guangyan presented two maidens as tribute, one named Xuanbo and the other Zhuoying. The king was devoted to the Dao of immortals, and so the two maidens descended in mortal guise. Their jade-like skin was flawless, their bodies light, and their qi fragrant. The king housed them in chambers of sheer silk and fed them the ointment of *minying*. Both were skilled in dance; wherever they moved, a fragrant breeze arose, and as they whirled and circled, they seemed scarcely able to support themselves. The king brushed them with his tassel, and they danced with bewitching grace, their movements as delicate as phoenixes in flight. When he waved his sleeve, they ceased. Recognizing their divine nature, the king lodged them in the Terrace of Lofty Clouds, where he laid out mats woven with qilin patterns and burned the incense of *tudu*, imported from the kingdom of Boyi.

*The Unofficial History*: On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the early Tianbao era, Luo Gongyuan said to the emperor, "Would Your Majesty accompany me on a journey to the moon?" He took a cassia branch and cast it into the air, where it transformed into a great bridge gleaming like white gold. The emperor walked upon it to the lunar palace, where hundreds of female immortals in plain white robes danced gracefully in the vast courtyard. When he asked what melody they performed, they replied, "The *Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe*." Again, in the fourth year of Tianbao, the Perfected Lady Yang was formally invested as the Noble Consort, and thereafter, each day, the *Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe* was performed. As the poet Liu Yuxi wrote:
*"The Emperor of Kaiyuan had all he desired,*
*Yet regretted only the fleeting light of those days.*
*Gazing from the Three Hamlets toward the mountain of immortals,*
*He returned to compose the* Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe.
*His heart thereafter dwelt by the Jasper Pool,*
*Following the Three Clarities and Eight Sceneries.*
*Suddenly he rode the white clouds to heaven,*
*Leaving only autumn wind and verse behind in the world."*

The Crown Prince drank the elixir; the Long-Hu presented frost.
*The New Record of the Alchemical Terrace*: The monks Shi Daowei and Zhu Falan asked Master Ge the Immortal, "The Dao arises without before or after—it cannot be spoken of or discussed. Yet we wonder: between Laozi and the Crown Prince, who came first?" The master replied, "Profound is your question, for it accords with the true and correct. The Dao is fundamentally without before or after, without left or right, without existence or extinction, without high or low, without noble or base. It is formless and imageless, and so we name it the Dao—it cannot be expressed in words. The Crown Prince was born after Laozi, but in a former life, he accumulated merit and virtue, and so he was granted a cup of the Supreme One’s golden liquid. His body became like a radiant cluster of purple gold, and thus he was called the Golden Immortal."

*The Declarations of the Perfected*: The Great King of the Northern Rong, the Long-Hu, presented Emperor Shun with the frost of white langgan and the ten-times-refined purple essence. Whoever consumed them would attain long life and ascend as an immortal, becoming coeval with heaven and earth. Shun took them, and soon after, he died and was buried in the wilds of Cangwu. For though the dragon played the *Ling’a* and the phoenix drummed the *Yunchi*, he still underwent corpse-liberation and feigned death, wishing to sever the bonds of life and death and show the people that all things have a beginning and an end.

The Recluse Immortal of White Stone; Lu’s dream of yellow millet.
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals*: The Master of White Stone refused to cultivate the methods of ascending to immortality, seeking only not to die while still enjoying the pleasures of the human world. Peng Zu asked him why, and he replied, "In heaven, one must serve many exalted beings—it is more burdensome than life among men." Thus, he was called the Recluse Immortal.

*The Record in the Pillow*: During the Kaiyuan era, the Daoist Master Lü passed through Dengye on his travels. At an inn, he encountered a young man from the prefecture, Lu Sheng, who was also staying there. The innkeeper was steaming yellow millet, and they waited together for it to cook. Lu sighed deeply, and the old man asked why. Lu recounted his hardships in life. The master took a pillow from his bag and gave it to Lu, saying, "Pillow this, and you shall attain glory and contentment as you wish." Lu rested his head upon it and dreamed he entered the pillow’s hollow. There, he soon passed the imperial examinations, rose through the ranks of the court, and served as a general and minister for fifty years. His sons and grandsons all held high office, and his prosperity was unmatched. He submitted a memorial: *"I am over eighty, having served in the Three Ducal Offices. Though I have done little to repay Your Majesty’s profound grace, I now take eternal leave of this sacred age."* That very night, he died. Lu Sheng stretched and awoke to find Master Lü beside him—the yellow millet was still not done.

Lu bowed in gratitude and said, "This is how you, Master, have curbed my desires—how dare I not heed your teaching?" He prostrated himself twice and departed.

Lord Lu achieved liberation through *shijie*, while Yan Hui attained *zuowang*.

*Records of the Strange* states: When Yan Zhenqing was sent to punish Li Xilie, all within and without knew he would not return. His kin and clan saw him off at Changle Slope, where, drunk, he leapt and danced before the front pillar, saying, "Long ago, I met the Daoist Tao Baba, who bestowed upon me the *Bixia Elixir* of the Jade Blade. To this day, I have not declined." He added, "At seventy, misfortune turns to fortune. One day, await me on Mount Luofu—could this not be today’s trial?" When he reached Tai Liang, Xilie ordered him strangled, and he was buried south of the city. After Xilie’s defeat, his family opened the coffin to find his countenance as in life, his body suffused with golden light, his nails grown beyond his hands, and his beard and hair several feet long. He was reburied on the northern mountain of Yanshi. Later, a merchant arrived at Mount Luofu, where two Daoists were playing *weiqi*. One asked, "Who has come here?" The merchant replied, "A humble traveler from Luoyang."

The Daoist smiled and said, "Fortunately, entrust me with a letter to deliver to my family." He sent a boy to fetch paper and brush, then wrote a letter. When it reached the Yan family on the northern mountain, his descendants received the letter and exclaimed in astonishment, "This is the handwriting of our late Grand Preceptor!" They opened the tomb and coffin, only to find it empty.

*The New Record of the Elixir Terrace* states: Yan Hui served as Attendant Gentleman of Bright Spring and Director of the Three Heavens. He once said to Confucius, "I have improved—now I sit in forgetfulness." Confucius, startled, asked, "What do you mean by 'sitting in forgetfulness'?" Yan Hui replied, "I discard my limbs and body, cast off perception and intellect, detach from form and abandon knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare—this is what I call 'sitting in forgetfulness.'" Confucius said, "To merge is to be without preferences; to transform is to be without constancy. Truly, you are worthy! I, Qiu, would follow after you." (See *Zhuangzi*.)

Zhao Gao concealed a sparrow; Tao Dan raised deer.
*The Record of Forgotten Tales* recounts: King Ziying of Qin drowned Zhao Gao in a well, yet after seven days he did not die. They then boiled him in a cauldron, but after seven days the water still did not boil, so they executed him. A prison officer said, "When Gao was first imprisoned, he carried in his bosom a green orb the size of a sparrow’s egg." A Daoist master explained, "Gao’s ancestors had received the elixir method of Han Zhong. In winter, he could stand on solid ice; in summer, beside a furnace—yet felt neither cold nor heat." When Gao died, a green sparrow flew from his corpse into the clouds—a sign of the Ninefold Transmutation.

*The Lives of Jin Recluses* states: Tao Dan, styled Chujing, was the grandson of the Grand Commandant Tao Kan. Orphaned young, he favored the arts of nourishing life, believing immortality attainable. At fifteen or sixteen, he began practicing qi-absorption and grain avoidance, never marrying. Though his family possessed a thousand gold pieces and over a hundred servants, Tao Dan sat all day in solemn stillness, never concerning himself with worldly affairs. He enjoyed reading and was skilled in divination. He built a hut in Linxiang Mountain of Changsha, keeping a white deer as his companion. When visitors sought him, he would cross streams to evade them, so none could approach. When the prefecture nominated him as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate, Tao Dan fled to Mount Pi in Luoxian County, never returning, and none knew his end.

The Queen Mother’s Jasper Pool; the Old Lord’s Jade Table.
*The Liezi* records: King Mu of Zhou ascended the Kunlun peaks to view the palace of the Yellow Emperor, then sealed it to bequeath to posterity. He was received as a guest by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted him by the Jasper Pool. *The Mu Tianzi Chronicle* adds: On an auspicious *jiǎzǐ* day, the Son of Heaven presented a white jade tablet and a dark jade disk to the Queen Mother, offering a hundred bolts of brocade and three hundred of white silk. The Queen Mother bowed and accepted them, then feasted him by the Jasper Pool. She sang: "White clouds drift in the sky, mountains rise of themselves. The Way stretches far—ask the rivers and hills. May you not die; come again!" The Son of Heaven replied, "When I return to the eastern lands, I shall harmonize and govern the Central States, equalize the myriad people, and then I shall come to see you again."

*The Biographies of Heavenly Masters* states: In the first year of Yongshou, the Old Lord descended upon the capital of Shu. The earth spirit caused a jade table to emerge. The Old Lord ascended it and bestowed upon the Heavenly Master the esoteric scriptures of the Northern and Southern Dippers, commanding him to universally save all beings and succor the common people.

Liang’s wife changed her attire; Yuan’s daughter altered her garments.
*The Biographies of Han Recluses* records: Liang Hong, a man of the same county as Meng, had a daughter who was ugly and dark, strong enough to lift a stone mortar, and refused all marriage proposals. At thirty, her parents asked why. She replied, "I wish for a husband as worthy as Liang Boluan." When Liang Hong heard this, he betrothed her. Upon marrying, she first entered his home adorned in finery. Liang Hong said, "I desire a companion in coarse cloth to dwell with me in the deep mountains. Now you wear silks and powders—is this what I wished?" His wife replied, "I only wished to observe your resolve. I have my own garments for reclusion." She then bound her hair in a simple knot, donned plain cloth, and approached him at work. Liang Hong rejoiced, "This is truly the wife of Liang Hong! She can serve me well." Later, they entered the mountains of Baling together.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Zhang Jizi, also named Fa in his youth, was deceived by Yuan Po’s lofty conduct and married to his daughter. The daughter wore lavish attire, but Jizi paid her no heed. Only after she changed her garments did they become husband and wife. They entered Mount Shi, where they met the Lord of the Mountain Diagram—a minister of King Xiang of Zhou and an immortal—who taught Jizi the method of the Nine Clouds’ Water and the Strong Pillars. Through cultivation, Jizi attained this Dao.

Ziyun nurtured his spirit; Zhaosu tempered his desires.
*The Record of True Realms* states: The Heavenly Master Xiahou, named Ziyun, personally planted orchids and irises in his medicinal garden. He said, "The sages of antiquity used superior medicines to nurture the spirit, middle-grade medicines to cultivate nature, and lower-grade medicines to dispel illness. These can make one’s spirit efficacious, one’s nature luminous, and one’s illnesses vanish." Thus, he often distributed medicines in the market, adapting to each person’s depth of encounter. His poem on the medicinal garden reads: "Green leaves and red blossoms spread wide; the immortal classics I study alone. By chance, I transplant chrysanthemums from Kunlun’s slopes, hoeing through the roots of white clouds."

The day the master ascended, a woodcutter peering into the garden saw him whip a beast—tiger-like yet not a tiger, unrecognizable—into the eastern mountains, swift as the wind.

*The Pure Words from the Jade Flask* records: Wang Zhaosu of Suanzao County was learned in antiquity, pure and upright, his conduct towering above the world. When purchasing goods, he paid the exact price asked. Recommended by Li Mu to Emperor Taizong, he was summoned to the imperial chambers. At seventy-seven, his complexion was like cinnabar, his eyes like polished lacquer. He had lived as a widower, free from desire, for forty years, with no female attendants in his household. Appointed Professor of the Imperial University, he remained in the palace for over a month. When the emperor inquired about governing the world and nurturing life, Zhaosu replied, "To govern the world, nothing surpasses loving the people; to nurture life, nothing surpasses tempering desire—beyond this, there is nothing." The emperor cherished his words and inscribed them on screens and tables. He passed away at eighty-nine.

The claws of Magu were like a crow’s; the body of Fuxi was like a serpent’s.

*The Records of Immortal Assemblies* states: Magu, during the reign of Emperor Xiaoming, descended with the immortal Wang Yuan to the home of Cai Jing. As they approached, the sound of flutes, drums, and horses filled the air in an instant. Magu appeared to be eighteen or nineteen, her hair coiled atop her head with the rest cascading to her waist. Her garments bore patterns unlike any in the world, neither brocade nor silk. Her claws resembled those of a crow, and when Cai Jing saw them, he secretly thought, *"If my back ever aches, it would be wonderful to have such claws to scratch it."* Wang Yuan, already aware of Cai Jing’s thoughts, had him seized and whipped.

*The Records of Forgotten Tales* recounts: Yu carved through the Dragon Gate Mountains, also called the Dragon Gate. Reaching a hollow cavern, its depths stretched for tens of *li*, so dark that progress was impossible. Yu carried fire and pressed onward, encountering a beast like a boar holding a night-shining pearl whose glow was like a torch. A black dog barked ahead of him. After what seemed ten *li*, Yu lost all sense of day and night. When he awoke, the light gradually returned, and the boar and dog had transformed into human forms. Then he saw a divine being with the body of a serpent and the face of a man. Yu spoke to him, and the deity revealed to him the diagram of the Eight Trigrams, arrayed upon a golden plate, with eight spirits attending at his side. Yu said, *"Was it Huaxu who bore you, the sage child?"* The deity replied, *"Huaxu was the goddess of the Nine Rivers who gave birth to me."* He then drew forth a jade tablet, twelve inches long, corresponding to the twelve hours, and entrusted it to Yu to measure heaven and earth. Yu wielded this tablet to regulate the waters and stabilize the land. The serpent-bodied deity was none other than Fuxi.

Cui Chengzi refined the Five Stones; Ge Qi lifted a thousand *jin*.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* tells of Cui Chengzi, who cultivated the Way of the Five Stones’ ethereal essence. For ten years, he ingested it in a grotto chamber on Mount Pei, then departed in spirit, concealing his form within the cave. A traveler later saw his remains, yet his bones had not scattered, and a surpassing fragrance lingered. Upon closer inspection, five objects, white as chicken eggs, were hidden there. The traveler took them and left, but suddenly, a tremor of fear struck him—he had lost the Five Stones. The next day, he returned to the cave and found Chengzi seated within, his beard bristling as he declared: *"The Dao is attained through accumulating merit and piling up deeds, extending virtue to all beings. Only when the Earth Bureau recommends you and your name is inscribed in the Emperor Lord’s register can the divine elixir be completed and a true master encountered. You possess not a shred of goodness, yet harbor the intent to steal my ethereal essence and divine herbs, seeking transcendence—is this not difficult?"* Though the matter was precious to the gods, Chengzi, moved by compassion, chose not to punish him, fearing the mountain spirits would not forgive. *"You must leave at once,"* he said. Soon after, the traveler contracted a grave illness. A year later, Chengzi descended to his home at night and taught him the method of washing the heart and repenting his transgressions. His illness was cured.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* records: Ge Qi’s strength could lift a thousand *jin*, and above his head rose a five-colored *qi*, over a *zhang* high. One day, he ascended on a dragon.

"Self-scooping water," as Liu Zhengxing said.

*The Idle Tales of Rustics* recounts: In Lizhou’s commandery, there was a man with unbound hair and bare feet, clad in a short hemp robe. When spoken to, his replies, though unconstrained, often concerned matters of heaven, which most could not comprehend. At night, he would stand and sleep in the spirit temple. In the height of summer or the depths of winter, none knew his whereabouts. The people called him "Heaven’s Self-So." Outside the southern gate of the commandery lay a market, a bustling hub of commerce. One evening, a fire broke out at dawn, burning the houses to the ground. The city’s inhabitants climbed to high places to watch, but Heaven’s Self-So sighed and muttered to himself: *"The people of this region indulge in extravagance and debauchery, knowing nothing of the good Way. Having committed evil for so long, Heaven is about to destroy them."* He then scooped water from a stone basin before the temple and cast it into the air. Soon, a black mist emerged from the temple gate, transforming into a great rain that extinguished the fire. Heaven’s Self-So then vanished without a trace.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* tells of Liu Zheng, who possessed the Way of defense. He could make one man act as a thousand, and a thousand as ten thousand. He could also exhale water to summon clouds, gather earth to form mountains, and pierce the ground to create abysses.

Li Lian, the Idle Guest; Guimeng, the Scattered Man.

*The Preface to the *Chart of Pointing to the Origin*** states: Li Lian called himself the "Idle Guest of the Three Immortals’ Gate" and the "Celestial Idler Under Heaven." He once wrote in the *Preface to Pointing to the Origin*: *"To knock upon the gate of mystery, one must rely on a master’s hand. Without encountering a true immortal, the great Dao is difficult to comprehend."* While traveling in Jiangnan, in Nanjing’s Yingtian Prefecture, he met the Hua Yin True Man, Shi Jianwu Xisheng, who wore a green turban, purple shoes, a black belt, and flowing robes. His radiance dazzled the eye, and his presence was awe-inspiring. Yet in conversation, he expounded the heavenly mysteries, elucidating the great Dao in terms both ancient and modern—something rarely seen. He then bestowed upon Li Lian the *Chart of Cultivating the True Origin*, comprising fifteen diagrams, clear and luminous. It could truly be called the secret scripture of a true immortal.

*The Original Biography* records: In the Tang dynasty, Lu Guimeng was lofty and unrestrained in his youth. Though he sat for the imperial examinations, he did not pass even once. He dwelled in Fuli of Songjiang, following Zhang Bo, and disliked associating with common companions. Even when they came to his door, he refused to see them. He did not ride horses but traveled by boat, with a canopy of reeds, carrying bundles of books, a tea stove, a brush rest, and fishing gear. Thus, he was known as the "Scattered Man of Rivers and Lakes."

Compiled by Chen Baoguang, a Daoist of the Orthodox Unity Tradition.

The River Master’s Dao was revered, and the Primordial Lady ranked highest among immortals.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: The River Master’s surname and given name are unknown. During the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, he built a thatched hut by the river and constantly recited the *Laozi*. Emperor Wen, who admired the words of *Laozi*, dispatched envoys to inquire about its unsolvable meanings. The Master said: "The Dao is revered, and virtue is noble—these cannot be questioned from afar." The Emperor then rode in his carriage to visit him, dismounted, and bowed deeply to ask about its profound mysteries. The Master replied: "Always take the hearts of the common people as your own heart."

*The Seven Lots from Cloudy Peaks* records: Ren Sheng secluded himself on Mount Song to study. One night, a yellow-robed figure arrived, holding a summons, and said: "Your life has ended." After traveling several dozen *li*, banners, insignia, and canopies stretched endlessly. A woman riding a kingfisher-green brush, attended by dozens of guards, appeared. The yellow-robed figure and Ren Sheng withdrew to hide by a wall. The woman, seeing them from afar, asked who they were. The yellow-robed one truthfully explained. The woman took the summons, examined it, and said: "Now that we have met, I cannot be without compassion." She took up a brush and wrote: "Granted three more years." Ren Sheng bowed in gratitude and asked the messenger who she was. The yellow-robed figure replied: "This is the Three Primordials’ Primordial Lady, the most exalted among immortals." Ren Sheng indeed revived, and three years later, he passed away.

Lin Bo’s house was pierced, and the purple clouds’ stone shattered.

*The Inner Biography of the Heavenly Master* states: Zhang Zixiang, styled Lin Bo, was broadly learned in the Confucian classics and served as a magistrate in Luoyang. He resigned his post and retired with his wife to Mount Longhu, dedicating himself to cultivation. He could expel the elixir from his abdomen, place it on his palm to admire, or toss it into a vessel, where its radiance pierced the house before he swallowed it again. He lived over a hundred years. After his death, when his coffin was buried, it was found to be empty.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: During the Five Dynasties, the Jiangnan Daoist Tan Zixiao possessed Daoist arts. He could perform rituals to summon stellar constellations, tread the *Yu Step* and *Kui Formation*, and bind and control ghosts and demons. He dwelled in the Secluded Grotto of Mount Lu. At that time, a monk from Ye named Yu Han was constructing a pavilion, but his work was obstructed by an unyielding boulder. Despite employing a hundredfold labor, they could not level it. The master arrived and said, "This is easily done." He pinched a mudra with his fingers, exhaled water upon it, and commanded the workers to strike. The stone shattered at once, and the ground was leveled in a single day.

*The Lady of the Moon steals the elixir; the Jiang River nymphs unfasten their pendants.*
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: Yi possessed an elixir of immortality, but his wife secretly consumed it and fled to the moon, becoming Chang’e.
*The Collected Records of Immortals* recounts: Two daughters of the Jiang River nymphs were strolling along the riverbank, adorned in splendid attire and jeweled with ten *liang* of luminous pearls, each as large as a kingfisher’s egg. Zheng Jiaofu saw them, conversed with them, and begged for their pendants. They unfastened them and gave them to Jiaofu. He placed them in his robe and walked several dozen paces, but both the women and the pendants vanished.
*The Inner Transmission of the Han Odes* says: Long ago, Zheng Jiaofu was traveling to southern Chu. At the foot of the Han River’s high terrace, he encountered two women wearing two pearls, each as large as a sparrowhawk’s egg. Jiaofu said to them, "I desire your pendants." The two women unfastened them and gave them to him. After Jiaofu departed, the women suddenly disappeared, and the pendants were lost as well.

*Wu Yi spreads the feast; Zhu Rong convenes the assembly.*
*The Records of Mount Wu Yi* states: In the second year of Qin Shihuang’s reign, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the Lord of Wu Yi gathered over a thousand villagers on the summit of Slow Pavilion Peak. Men and women were seated on mats to the east and west, laid with crimson-cloud cushions and purple-haze quilts. They performed the *Left Immortal’s Song of Guest Clouds*, and as the wine circulated, the master of ceremonies, Peng Jinzhao, sang the *Song of Human-Divine Gathering and Parting*:
*"The meeting of heaven and earth is rare,
As the sun sets beyond the western hills, the evening birds return in flight.
A hundred years pass in an instant—our aspirations unfulfilled,
The heavenly palace so near, yet we cannot follow in sorrow."*
When the song ended, colorful clouds suddenly gathered on all sides. The villagers bid farewell to the immortals and descended the mountain. Looking back, not a single trace remained on the peak.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Xue Jichang resided on Mount Heng, delving into the profound mysteries of the Dao. Emperor Minghuang once summoned him to the palace and questioned him on virtue and the Dao. His discourse was exquisitely subtle, and the emperor, delighted, bestowed upon him exceptional favor. One day, he suddenly told his disciples, "Tonight, the Heavenly Assembly convenes on Zhu Rong Peak. I have been summoned and must depart." He then ascended into the void and vanished.

*The white dog of Master Bin; the black boar of Wan You.*
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* states: Du Guangting, styled Binsheng, once told his disciples, "Last night, I dreamed of ascending to the Celestial Court, where I was appointed overseer of the Min and Emei mountains. Now that the True Palace on Mount Qingcheng is complete, I fear my time in this world is short." Guangting had long kept a white dog named Chuiyun. He once ordered it to be fed sesame oil, its paws wrapped in silk, saying, "I have heard that oil on a dog’s paws allows it to run ten thousand *li* in a day." When the True Palace was finished, he donned his ritual robes, ascended the hall, gathered his disciples to bid them farewell, and passed away. A wondrous fragrance filled the room, and Chuiyun howled and died as well.
*The Extensive Records* recounts: Wan You cultivated the Dao in the uninhabited wilds of southern Qian. Every twenty or thirty years, he would emerge to sell medicine in the city. Wang Jian of Shu welcomed him into the palace and treated him with utmost reverence, inquiring about his diet. Wan You remained silent, saying, "I am no immortal, nor one who consumes elixirs. I merely empty my heart, nurture my *qi*, discard my faults, and examine my conduct." When asked his age, he replied, "I only recall the years of the Night King’s reign in Shu and the era when Can Cong ruled the capital. When summoned, I witnessed the sun and moon racing, flowers blooming and trees withering—I do not reckon the years by the *ganzhi* cycle." Later, he firmly declined to remain and returned to the mountains. Wang Jian wept and entreated him to stay, but Wan You refused to speak of the future. After his departure, words were found inscribed on the wall of his dwelling:
*"Do not let the green boar’s hooves be stirred,
For once disturbed, the raging flames cannot be quenched.
The startled beast must not bear yellow at both ends,
For when its color appears, Heaven will not weep."*
The wise could not fathom its meaning. In the year *yihai*, an army marched east to seize Qin and Feng. *Yihai* was the year of the "green boar," the time of calamitous fire. Three years later, in the year *wuyin*, the earth collapsed and Mount Jian was built. Only then was it understood that *yin* signified the "startled beast," and both the heavenly stem and earthly branch were of the element earth, which is yellow. Thus, the phrase "the startled beast bears yellow at both ends" was not a word amiss.

*Huan He tends the hearth; Liu Hao oversees the kitchen.*
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Song Huanhe, styled Qingyuan, served Tao Hongjing at the Huayang Lodge on Mount Mao for over a decade. His nature was upright and solemn, his demeanor serene as if devoid of purpose. One day, two azure lads and a white crane descended from the sky and alighted in the courtyard. Hongjing, startled, received them, believing they had come for him. The azure lads said, "The command of the Most High is for Master Huan." Hongjing silently considered his disciples—none bore the surname Huan. Upon inquiry, he found only Huan He, who tended the hearth. Questioned about his practices, Huan replied, "For nine years, I have cultivated the Dao of silent audience. Today’s summons is the result of that." Huan donned celestial robes, mounted the white crane, and ascended to heaven.
*The Supplementary Biographies of Immortals* states: Liu Hao’s family had long revered the Dao. He practiced with utmost devotion and, though over eighty, remained free of illness. The villagers suspected his longevity was due to his mastery of the Dao. One day, he suddenly told his family, "Yesterday, I received a celestial decree. The Most High has ordered me to oversee the kitchen of the Nine Immortals’ Treasure Chamber for a hundred years. Tomorrow, I must depart." On the appointed day, he passed away without illness. A wondrous fragrance filled the courtyard and lingered for days.
*Liu Rong’s powdered turtle; Zhang Guo’s paper donkey.*
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: The Southern Pole Master Liu Rong took powder, coated a cup with it, and molded it into a turtle. He boiled and ate its flesh, then chewed its shell, which reverted to a wine cup.

He could also hold powder in his mouth to form eggs, spitting out dozens at a time, which he would boil and eat. The yolks of these eggs all contained a small amount of powder. He would then take water and shape it into fine wine, and all who drank it would become intoxicated.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Zhang Guo often rode a white donkey that could travel several hundred *li* in a day. When he rested, he would fold the donkey, reducing it to the thickness of paper, and store it in his headscarf box. When he wished to ride again, he would breathe upon it with water, and it would once more become a donkey.

Lu Feng repairs the estate; Xi Shan crafts the carriage.

*The Supplementary Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Lu Feng was skilled in carpentry and traveled between Qi and Dai. The magistrate of Shouzhang had a secondary estate with over twenty collapsed buildings. He sent an official to summon craftsmen for repairs. The official detained Lu Feng along the way, but Lu Feng invited him to a tavern to drink. Though the estate was over thirty *li* away, by dusk, Lu Feng was already drunk. The magistrate was known for his temper, and the official grew deeply anxious. The next day, they drank again, and the official urged Lu Feng to depart. Lu Feng replied, "I came to repair the estate, and it has already been put right. Why do you rush me so?" The official did not understand his meaning. After a long while, a village boy arrived from the estate and reported that the previous night, as if by wind and rain, the buildings had been restored. The official reported the matter to the magistrate, who summoned Lu Feng to apologize, but Lu Feng merely murmured in assent.

Xi Leshan’s origins are unknown.

During the Dahe era, Chang’an endured over a month of heavy snow, leaving peddlers and common folk with no means to seek food. Leshan braved the snow to visit a cartwright’s household and said, “I am skilled in crafting wheel spokes. I can make a hundred at once, and the labor is worth three hundred *wen*.” The family put him to work. By lamplight, he wielded his axe, laboring through the day and into the night. Before the third watch had passed, the hundred spokes were complete. At dawn, he received thirty thousand *wen* and returned home to relieve the hunger of the poor. When the snow cleared, he departed, and none knew where he had gone.

Liezi rode the wind—one might call it "out-snowing the snow." As the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: "Liezi rode the wind and traveled, light and effortless. Fifteen days passed before he returned. Among those who attain good fortune, few are so frequent. Yet even so, though he avoided walking, he still relied on something. As for one who rides the uprightness of Heaven and Earth, harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams the boundless—what does he rely on?" The *Continuation of the Immortals’ Biographies* states: Du Zisheng, styled Keyun, claimed to be from Duling, though none could fathom his age. He could drink three *dou* of wine without becoming drunk and was skilled in writing in the sand. Once, he stood in the snow for two or three days; people thought him frozen to death, but when they brushed him off, he rose slowly, shook off the snow, and walked away as if waking from a drunken slumber. During the Tang, Du Ruxiu served as prefect of Suzhou. Hearing that Keyun was in the city, he invited him to the prefectural hall, bowing and addressing him as "Daoist Elder." The officials were astonished, but Ruxiu explained, "When my late father governed Xichuan, he was close with the Daoist Elder. It has been forty years since we parted, yet his appearance and bearing remain unchanged." Later, he traveled to Hang and Yue, then departed. Kuafu chased the sun; Taibai grasped the moon.

The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* states: "There was a man who held two yellow serpents in his hands, named Kuafu."

The *Liezi* records: "Kuafu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow. He pursued it to the edge of Valley’s End, parched with thirst. He rushed to drink from the Wei River, but its waters were insufficient. He then set out northward to drink from the Great Marsh, yet before he arrived, he died of thirst along the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his flesh and fat soaked the earth, the Deng Forest grew—spreading vast for thousands of *li*."

The *Gleanings of Forgotten Lore* recounts: "Later, Du Fu spoke of Li Taibai lodging by the river. It was a high autumn night, the current crystalline, like ten thousand *qing* of cold jade. Taibai, seeing the moon in the water, declared, 'I shall enter the water to grasp the moon!' Soon after, his body was nowhere to be found. Some say the waters dissolved him—such are the affairs of immortals."

Cloud-essence for Yuan Dao, stone-marrow for Wang Lie.

The *Biographies of Eminent Daoists* states: "Ye Fashan, styled Yuandao, was a native of Kuocang and descended from a family of Daoists. His mother, née Liu, dreamed one day of a shooting star entering her mouth; she swallowed it and conceived. After fifteen months, she gave birth. At seven, he fell into the great river and returned only after three years. His parents asked the reason, and he replied, 'The Azure Lad led me to drink cloud-essence and pay homage to the Supreme. Thus, I tarried awhile.'"

The *Accounts of Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* records: "Wang Lie, styled Changxiu, was a Gentleman of Scattered Leisure. Ji Shuye held him in great esteem and often sought his instruction. Together, they entered the mountains to roam and gather herbs. Later, Lie went alone to the Taihang Mountains, where he suddenly heard a sound like thunder from the northeast. Unsure of its cause, he went to investigate and saw the mountain split and stone cracked, with a blue-green mud flowing forth like marrow. Lie took some and ate it. He then returned with Shuye to see, but the broken mountain had already restored itself. According to the immortal classics, every five hundred years, the mountains of immortals open once, and stone-marrow emerges. Those who obtain and consume it attain a lifespan coeval with heaven. The marrow Lie had earlier obtained was of this kind."

Shen Bin sat three times for the examinations; Dong Wei wove a hundred knots.

From *Elegant Conversations of the Prefectural Pavilion*:

Shen Bin, styled Ziwen, was fond of the immortals. Orphaned in his youth, he made a pact with his western journey: three attempts at the examinations. On his first attempt, he dreamed of an immortal’s song:

*"The jade palace swings wide its gates, and one enters with ease,
Golden peaches ripen full—yet none dare steal a taste.
The phoenix startles at the sacred fan, flapping its wings in fright,
The dragon dreads the golden whip and turns its head in flight."*

On his second attempt, he recalled the immortal’s song:

*"The elm wind sighs, autumn on the ninefold heavens,
The Queen Mother returns from her feast in the jade tower.
Days and months grow long as twin phoenixes slumber,
The mulberry fields shift, and the six giant turtles grieve.
Clouds obscure the flutes and pipes as they drift away,
Stars strike the banners, each streaming its own course.
Of late, poetry and wine have lost their wild abandon,
Riding the dragon, I recall the Way of Supreme Clarity."*

For his third attempt, he submitted his examination scroll, placing Liu Xiang at the top with this poem:

*"Once I sat for the Son of Heaven’s grand examination,
Four reigns of wind and moon have silvered my temples.
I did not follow the founding emperor, shouldering his sword,
But for the cultured emperor, I returned to my books.
Ten years of war’s dust have swept away my old livelihood,
Spring rains drench the city, rotting my humble home.
Why should you begrudge me a single branch?
The cinnamon of immortality still blooms in abundance each year."*

The examiners, upon reading Shen’s poem, that year exceptionally passed both Liu and Shen. Later, Shen traveled south beyond the lakes, where he too became a man of the Dao.

From *Biographies of Reclusive Scholars*:

Dong Wei dwelled in Luoyang at the White Society, fashioning his robes from tattered silk and scraps of cloth, earning the name "Hundred Knots." Xie Xiutong was a scholar of refined conduct.

From *Cloud and Thatch*:

The Daoist master Nie Shidao heard that the Perfected One Mei and Attendant Censor Xiao had secluded themselves on Jade Bamboo Mountain, where many had glimpsed them. Nie journeyed to Jade Bamboo, lodging at the Abbey of Pure Emptiness. Thrice he wandered the Darkwood Hollow, hoping for even a single sighting, and departed with unwavering resolve, venturing deep into the mountains. Suddenly, he saw a man in plain robes and a black gauze hat, who called himself a wayfarer. When Nie asked where he was bound, Nie replied that he sought Mei and Xiao. The wayfarer said: "I hear your spirit stirs with longing for the Dao, and you have traversed famous mountains in search of it—this is no easy devotion. Your past deeds are most serene, and your name is already inscribed in the Jade Register. Though you may not yet ascend in flight, you shall certainly transcend the world. I am Xie Xiutong."

Additionally, when the future Chancellor Yuan Zi was yet obscure, he once climbed Green Han Peak in Fuzhou on a day of leisure. There, a scholar in Confucian garb engaged him in familiar conversation. Yuan remarked: "This place, with its wondrous mountains and springs, must surely be the abode of transcendent immortals." The scholar replied: "There are five or six Daoists who occasionally come here, though none know where they dwell. They shun human attention, but if you bring fine wine, you might catch a glimpse." Later, Yuan obtained excellent wine and returned, staying several nights until the Daoists indeed arrived. The scholar arranged seats and served the wine. Then, he led Yuan out to bow before them. The Daoists exchanged glances in alarm, and one angrily rebuked the scholar: "This man is sincere in his resolve, and moreover, he is a scholar of noble lineage." After a long while, their displeasure eased. Gazing at Yuan, they said: "This man resembles the meditating monk of Western Florescence—he has come and gone for forty-seven years." When they asked Yuan his age, it was precisely forty-seven. Clapping their hands, they declared: "Your blessings and rank are at hand." Later, Yuan indeed became chancellor.

Left Ci was one-eyed; Xu Hua had a crooked head.

From *Records of Divine Immortals of the Three Caverns*:

During the Wei, Left Ci could transform himself at will. Later, he entered Eastern Wu. There, a man named Xu Duo lived in Dantu. When Left Ci visited, Xu was away, and a guest at his gate lied, saying: "Master Xu is not here." Left Ci, knowing the guest mocked him, departed at once. The guest saw an ox walking along the top of a poplar tree; when it climbed the tree, it vanished, but when it descended, the ox reappeared. Upon the tree, even the wheel hubs sprouted thorns one or two feet long, which could not be cut nor pushed aside. Terrified, the guest rushed to tell Xu Duo: "There was a one-eyed old man whom I deceived, saying you were not home. After he left, the cart and ox became like this!" Xu said: "That was Left Ci. How could you deceive him?" The guests scattered to pursue Left Ci, kowtowing and begging forgiveness. Left Ci’s anger subsided, and he departed, whereupon the cart and ox returned to normal.

From *Extensive Records of Marvels*:

In Chengdu, there was a painter surnamed Xu, skilled in capturing likenesses. One day, a poor man in tattered, haggard clothes came seeking a portrait. Xu laughed: "Your appearance is so robust—why seek a portrait?" The man opened his cloth bag, took out a yellow Daoist robe, a deerskin cap, and a white jade hairpin. Donning the cap and changing his clothes, he sat upright and rubbed his face—his youthful complexion returned. He tugged his beard, and it turned black at his touch, revealing a handsome man. Xu exclaimed: "I did not know a divine immortal had descended!" The Daoist said: "Paint my image and place it in your shop. If anyone seeks to buy it, charge only a thousand coins." Later, someone recognized him: "This is the Perfected One Zhu of Lingquan." Seekers flocked to Xu, who demanded two thousand coins per portrait. In a dream, the Daoist said: "Your blessings are limited—you must not greedily disregard my words, lest you shorten your lifespan." He struck Xu’s cheek. When Xu awoke, his head was crooked, and he became known as "Xu the Crooked Head."

Jie Zitui and the yellow sparrow; Feng Junda and the green ox.

From *Biographies of Divine Immortals*:

Jie Zitui was a man of Jin who lived in obscurity. Zhao Chengzi studied the Dao with him. One morning, a yellow sparrow perched at his gate. Duke Wen of Jin found it strange and lived abroad with Jie for over a decade, enduring hardship without complaint. When they returned to Jieshan, a man named Bozi often came to call Jie: "It is time to leave." Jie then followed Bozi in his wanderings. Later, Duke Wen sent envoys with jade and silk to summon him, offering rites of respect, but Jie did not go.

From *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*:

Feng Heng, styled Junda, often rode a green ox, earning the name "Green Ox Daoist." When people fell ill—whether he knew them or not—he would offer medicine from the bamboo tube at his waist, or apply needles, curing them instantly. When Emperor Wu of Wei asked for the great principles of nurturing life, Feng said: "Let the body labor but not to excess; let the diet be meager but not to the point of depletion. Avoid rich and heavy foods, moderate sour and salty flavors, quiet your thoughts, temper joy and anger, forsake frivolous pursuits, be cautious in the bedchamber. In spring and summer, release and disperse; in autumn and winter, store and conceal. Then you will approach the Dao."

The imperial park presented jujubes; the marketplace of Heyin sold pomegranates.

From *The Biography of Dongfang Shuo*:
During Emperor Wu’s reign, the Shanglin Park presented jujubes. The Emperor struck the railing of the Weiyang Palace’s front hall with his staff and called out to Shuo: "Chi! Come, come! Sir, do you know what is in the basket?" Shuo replied: "Forty-nine jujubes from the Shanglin Park." The Emperor asked: "How did you know?" Shuo said: "The one who called me was the Emperor; striking the railing twice—two great forests; Shuo comes, come come—jujubes; *chi chi*—forty-nine." The Emperor laughed heartily and bestowed ten bolts of silk upon him.

From *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*:
The Daoist Zhang Yuanhua, whose esoteric practices were unknown, one day bid farewell to his fellow villagers in their dreams, saying: "I shall journey afar for a time." That very night, he indeed achieved transcendence. At dawn, those who harbored doubts and came to visit found that all, young and old, had shared the same dream. After his burial, a hole large enough to admit an arm appeared in his tomb. Those who understood said: "This is the cicada’s molt." Soon after, a merchant from Heyin arrived at Rufen, selling pomegranates along the way. He encountered a Daoist who said: "I am the temple master of your grave, Zhang. I entrust you with a letter." He then purchased several dozen pomegranates and presented them to the guest at the Northern Dipper Hall. The merchant agreed.

Upon arrival, his disciples said: "This letter bears the master’s own brush." They led the guest to the portrait hall, where he remarked: "The one I saw earlier differs not in the slightest from this."

Carrying a zither and shouldering a medicine gourd, he drifted as a home upon the waters.

*Accounts of Eminent Daoists*:
The Daoist Li Zhenyin dwelled in reclusion on Mount Hua. In the west of Qizhou there lived a man named Wang You, whose wealth numbered in the tens of thousands. He often maintained a guesthouse to welcome travelers from all directions, where fine delicacies and choice wines were ever at the ready. Li arrived bearing a zither and a medicine gourd, and Wang invited him to stay in the guesthouse.

Li said: "I have heard that those who delight in music all have a master to guide them; those who scheme and maneuver harbor ambitions of persuasion; those who study military strategy must possess a warrior’s heart. Yet I carry but a single zither and a single medicine gourd—could there be no purpose in this? To carry a zither is to know that the ancient tones of the qin may restore simplicity and curb excess. To shoulder a medicine gourd is to know that people suffer many ailments, and I would ease their pain and grant them enduring peace. Moreover, my zither does not transform only myself—it transforms others. My medicine does not preserve only myself—it preserves others. Though you are able to aid others with your abundance, this differs from those who amass wealth through oppression and plunder. Yet compared to the noble and wealthy of antiquity who welcomed scholars, you still fall short. The key lies in distinguishing the worthy from the unworthy, and thus your person and reputation may remain unblemished."

Li then called for wine and drank alone until dawn, whereupon he abruptly took his leave. Wang secretly followed and saw Li transform into a great stag, bounding westward into the unknown.

*The Tang History Continued*:
Zhang Zhihe, styled Zitong, visited Yan Zhenqing, who served as prefect of Huzhou. Yan, finding Zhang’s boat shabby, offered to replace it, but Zhang replied: "I wish to make my home upon the waters, drifting where the clouds and waves may take me."

Li Deyu praised Zhang Zhihe as one "reclusive yet renowned, prominent yet unburdened, neither impoverished nor prosperous, strict in ritual and reverent in conduct."

*Records of the Multitude of Immortals from the Three Caverns*, Scroll Fifteen—concluded.
*Records of the Multitude of Immortals from the Three Caverns*, Scroll Sixteen.

*The Orthodox Unity Daoist* Lai Baoguang compiled:

Zhang Zhihe’s water play, Xia Tong’s paired plowing.

*Accounts of Immortals’ Exploits*:
Zhang Zhihe was a native of Shanyin in Kuaiji. When Yan Zhenqing traveled east to Pingwang Post, Zhihe, flushed with wine, performed a water play: he spread a mat upon the waves, drank alone, and chanted in song. The mat drifted to and fro, while clouds and cranes followed above. Yan’s retinue and guests all marveled in astonishment. Soon after, Zhihe waved his hand upon the water in farewell to Yan Zhenqing and ascended, departing.

*Records of Jin Recluses*:
Xia Tong, styled Zhongyu, was a native of Yongxing in Kuaiji. Orphaned in youth and poor, he supported his parents with filial devotion. Often foraging for food, he would journey by starlight and return at night, sometimes gathering shellfish by the sea to sustain them. Though eloquent in discourse, his clan urged him to serve in office, saying: "Your clarity and uprightness suit you to be an administrative aide. By engaging with the prefectural court, you would surely rise to prominence. Why endure hardship in the mountains and forests, spending your life by the seashore?" Tong flushed with anger and replied: "Do you truly take me for such a man? Were I born in an age of peace, I would debate the path of withdrawal with Yuan and Kai. In a corrupt era, I would share in the filth with Qu Yuan. Between purity and defilement, when the time is right, I shall plow alongside Ju and Nie. How could I debase myself and bend my will to serve in the prefectural court?" Ji Ping was revived, and Yin Yao reborn.

*Tales from the Hall of Audience*:
In Shangdang, there lived a transcendent named Cheng, who possessed talismans. When Liu Wu served as military commissioner of Ze and You, a man of Linluo County named Xiao Jiping, though wealthy, suddenly died one day. Cheng, who had once received Jiping’s generous kindness, rushed to see him upon hearing of his death and told his son: "Your father has not truly died—he was summoned by a mountain spirit to treat him. He may yet live." Thereupon, he inscribed a vermilion talisman and cast it into the air. After the time it takes to eat a meal, Jiping revived, saying: "At first, a man in green robes appeared, saying, ‘The spirit of Mount Huo has summoned you.’ After traveling some fifty *li*, I encountered a red-robed man with a staff, descending from the sky in fury. He said to me, ‘Cheng the Demon-Slayer summons you—go quickly!’ The green-robed man fled in fear. The red-robed man took my sleeve and brought me back, and I awoke." His family was astonished and asked Cheng who this "Demon-Slayer" was. Cheng replied: "I studied under a master and took refuge in the *Dragon-Tiger Record of Demon-Slaying*." He then untied the talisman pouch at his waist to show them. Later, he traveled to Min and Yue, and his whereabouts became unknown.

*The Supplementary Biographies of Transcendents* records: Dan Yinyao, a Daoist of Dongting, dwelt on Mount Jiao. He studied the Way of Refining the Form through the Great Yin. After dying in a cliffside grotto, he appeared in a dream to his disciple, saying: "Examine my corpse and let no other disturb it. In six years, I shall revive—come to welcome me with garments." The disciple looked and found the body putrid, infested with worms, and decayed, save for the five viscera, which remained unchanged. He sealed and guarded it as instructed. When the six years had passed, he returned to find the body whole and seated upright. The disciple prepared a bath and fresh robes to receive him. His hair and beard had grown black, coarse, and straight, like the mane of a beast. Sixteen years later, he died again in the same manner, only to revive after another seven years. This occurred three times in all, and with each cycle, his appearance grew more robust. Emperor Yang of the Sui summoned him to the Eastern Capital, but he earnestly begged to return to the mountains, and the emperor soon granted his wish.

"Shoulder Wu’s Three Abidings, Mo Di’s Five Phases."

*The Record of the Assembly of Perfected Ones on Mount West* states: Shi Jianwu, styled Xisheng, once composed the *Inscription on the Three Abidings*, which reads: The *Great Change* says, "Essence and qi become things; the wandering soul brings transformation." Among all the myriad forms, nothing is preserved before the primordial qi. If the primordial qi abides, then the form abides; if the form abides, then the spirit abides. When these three abide, my life rests with me, not with Heaven. This principle is perfectly clear, yet those who dwell in the mysteries do not believe it.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Mozi, named Di, served as a grandee in Song. At eighty-two, he feigned madness, saying: "The affairs of the world are now clear to me. Glory and rank cannot be long preserved. I shall abandon the vulgar stream to follow the Way of Red Pine." He entered Mount Di in Zhou to refine his spirit. Suddenly, a man appeared before him, and Mozi asked: "Are you the numinous qi of the mountain, or a transcendent who has attained the Way? I pray you tarry a while and instruct me in the Daoist teachings." The divine man replied: "I knew you were devoted to the Way, so I came to await you." Thereupon, he bestowed upon Mozi the *Plain Writ of the Unfinished Circle and Square*. Mozi bowed in receipt, and after practicing its methods, he achieved their efficacy. He compiled their essentials into the *Record of the Five Phases*. Later, he attained earthly transcendence and concealed himself to escape the Warring States.

"Xing Gong’s Cinnabar Crucible, Zhou Guan’s Medicine Cauldron."

*The Selected Tales* recounts: The summit of Mount Jiuyi lies beyond the reach of human footsteps. Legend tells of a transcendent who once dwelt there. Recently, a young hunter named Cao Xiong, son of the local military inspector, pursued game deep into the mountains and ascended to the peak. There, he saw two or three thatched huts. Within one, a man sat leaning on a table. Xiong bowed twice and asked who he was. The man replied: "I am the Transcendent Xing. I have dwelt here since the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang." He then invited Xiong to discuss worldly affairs. Xiong observed his dwelling: it contained only a study and a cinnabar crucible. On the table lay several poems. Xiong requested copies and obtained over ten, of which one is recorded here:

*A decree from the August Emperor descends to the immortals’ home,*
*Soon the stars shall align, and a guest shall stir the elixir.*
*On the wall hangs a three-foot sword of wind and cloud;*
*Before the bed stands a furnace of dragon and tiger, one crucible of sand.*
*Riding a thousand-year crane over the isles of the sea,*
*Sitting amidst the flowers of the four seasons in the Gourd Palace.*
*For love of the* Yin Fu *I inquire into the primal meaning,*
*Then follow the colored banners into the misty rosy clouds.*

When Xiong later returned to revisit the site, it took him several months to arrive. Though the dwelling remained, the transcendent had vanished.

*The Cold Studio Night Talks* records: Zhou Guan, of unknown origin, styled himself "Wooden Mamu." During the Zhiping era, he often wandered the Western Mountains and later arrived in Yuanzhou, where he encountered a young scholar named Li in the marketplace. Struck by Li’s refined bearing, Zhou wished to take him back to the forest retreat. Yet Li indulged in wine and sensual pleasures, showing no inclination toward self-cultivation. Zhou pointed to a medicine cauldron and composed a verse to admonish him:

*"Heaven ordains the dull to become a cauldron,*
*Even with three legs, how can it walk?*
*Though ears exist, it heeds no Dao,*
*Only clings to the world’s fiery pit."*

Soon after, Zhou died in the Western Mountains. As he was about to transform, someone asked his age. He replied:

*"At eighty, a wine immortal in the Western Hills,*
*Straw sandals worn through, hempen robe threadbare.*
*If you ask my age by the sexagenary cycle, ask not—*
*The radiance of the Supreme Ultimate knows no years."*

Later, someone saw Zhou near the Zhou Bridge in the capital. He entrusted a letter for Li in Yuanzhou, saying: *"Next year on the Mid-Autumn night, I shall pay you a visit."* When the appointed time arrived, Zhou indeed appeared at Li’s home. Finding Li away on business, he inscribed the door in white earth and departed, leaving these words:

*"This Mid-Autumn night, I come to keep last year’s vow.*
*Yet the three-legged cauldron is not seen—*
*In a snap of the fingers, all is empty."*

Li subsequently fell from his horse and broke a leg.

A brocade curtain descended from the sky, and the Grand Duke coaxed a crow.

*The Records of the Western Mountains* state: On the first day of the eighth month in the second year of Ningkang during the reign of Emperor Xiaowu, Master Xu the Perfected rose at dawn to find auspicious clouds descending from the heavens. Immortals alighted in his courtyard, whereupon a celestial decree was proclaimed: *"The August Emperor bestows upon the disciple of the Dao, Xu Xun, a purple feathered robe, a jade banner with a precious scepter, an elixir of jade nectar, and a pill of golden cinnabar—each one measure. The decree is to be received and obeyed."* On the fifteenth day of that month, at the *gen* hour, celestial music resounded from the heavens. A procession of azure lads, colorful banners, a dragon-drawn carriage, and a feathered canopy arrived to welcome Master Xu, his family of forty-two, and even their chickens and dogs, all ascending upon clouds. Moments later, a brocade curtain fluttered down from the sky, and a hawk’s perch fell in the southeast of his estate.

*The Accounts of Divine Immortals’ Encounters* recount: When Guo Ziyi first joined the army in the desert frontier, he was sent to hasten the delivery of military provisions. Some ten *li* from Yinzhou, dusk fell, and a sudden sandstorm plunged everything into darkness. Unable to proceed, he took shelter in an empty roadside

Later, Guo Ziyi achieved great merit and rose to eminent rank, being appointed Grand Commandant, Director of the Secretariat, and Grand Preceptor. He lived to ninety before passing away.

Jade tally and golden key—heaven’s favor in precious tokens.

*The Extensive Records* states: Wang Jia, having passed the filial piety examination, was appointed as a judicial officer in Zizhou. At the time, Du Xian served as a judicial officer in Bozhou, and the two, being colleagues, grew quite close. When they were dispatched together to Luoyang, they crossed the Qiantang River and ascended Luosha Mountain to observe the tide. Wang Jia remarked to Du Xian, "The Great Yu was truly a sage. When he governed the waters, he placed golden caskets and jade tallies to pacify the rivers and streams. This city of Hangzhou lacks such a stabilizing force—it will soon fall into ruin."

Du Xian asked, "How do you know this?"

Wang Jia replied, "Beneath this very stone lies the answer. Let us see for ourselves." He then instructed Du Xian to close his eyes and grasp his hand, bidding him leap down. When Du Xian opened his eyes, he found himself at the riverbed, where an empty space like a hall stood. There was a stone casket over a *zhang* tall, its lock gleaming. Wang Jia opened the lock, lifted the lid, and guided Du Xian’s hand inside. Within lay a golden casket, three *chi* in height, sealed with a golden lock. Wang Jia said, "The jade tally lies within, but only those with destiny may behold it." He then led Du Xian’s hand out, and in an instant, they stood upon the shore once more.

Wang Jia then told Du Xian, "You are destined for the rank of prime minister. Take care to preserve yourself." He proceeded to recount in detail Du Xian’s future official appointments, career, and even his lifespan. Later, Du Xian’s promotions unfolded exactly as foretold.

*The Miscellaneous Records of Leisure* recounts: During the Chongning era, Peng Tianchong, a candidate for the imperial examination from Nankang Prefecture, had never studied the Dao. Suddenly, he claimed that celestial beings descended to his home and bestowed upon him a heavenly scripture. One day, after bathing, he announced to others, "I am ascending to heaven." He shut himself indoors and was not seen again. Forty-two days later, he unexpectedly crossed the river and returned, saying, "When I first departed, I boarded a golden boat carried by clouds, as if floating upon silk. Gradually, I ascended to heaven, where I met a Daoist who said, 'In a past life, you were the magistrate of Pengze and rendered service to the people, thus your name is recorded in the immortal registers.' He then pointed to a white vapor and said, 'This is the sorrowful *qi* of your parents longing for you. Why not return? After ninety years, you may come back.' He gave me a golden key and a silver key, instructing me to sail downstream to Caizhou, sell the golden key for money, and return home. As I neared the river to cross, my funds ran out, so I sold the silver key to buy a boat. By the time I reached home, my money was spent."

His parents were overjoyed. Later, when he was arranged to marry, no further anomalies occurred.

Foolish sheep below the city, ailing cranes in the mountains.

*The Goose-Damaged Collection* records: In Luoyang, there was a cave into which a man fell in despair. Inside, he beheld palaces and figures unlike those of the mortal world. There were also great sheep with pearls in their beards; people ate them without knowing their origin. When he asked Zhang Hua about this, Hua replied, "This is one of the Nine Halls of Earthly Immortals. The great sheep are foolish dragons."

*The Cloud Thatched Hut* states: Before attaining high office, the Tang minister Li Shi was deeply devoted to the Dao. Once, while wandering Mount Song, he heard moaning from the overgrown grass. Upon investigation, he found an ailing crane, which spoke in human words: "I was once an immortal, but fate has afflicted me. A woodcutter injured me, and one of my legs is nearly broken. I require several *ge* of blood from a person of three lifetimes’ purity to heal."

Li Shi immediately removed his robe, preparing to draw blood, but the crane said, "There are few such people in the world, and you are not yet wholly pure." It then gave him an eyelash, saying, "Take this to the eastern capital. Simply gaze through it, and you will know the truth." On the road, Li Shi looked at himself and saw the head of a horse. Upon reaching Luoyang, he encountered many people, none of whom were whole—some had the heads of dogs, others of donkeys or horses. By chance, on a bridge, he saw an old man riding a donkey. Gazing through the eyelash, he saw the man was truly human. Li Shi bowed and recounted the crane’s plight. The old man, Huang, dismounted at once, bared his arm, and drew blood. Li Shi collected it in a small bottle and returned to the crane. He moistened the wound with the blood, bound it with torn cloth, and the crane expressed its gratitude: "You will become a prime minister in a prosperous age. Later, you too shall ascend lightly. Our reunion will not be far—take care not to waver in your resolve."

Li Shi bowed in reverence, and the crane soared into the sky.

The light of the wing’s shadow discerns right from wrong; the rise of clarity brings suffering and joy.

*The Biographies of Daoist Scholars* states: Meng Jingyi, styled Fuming, was a descendant of Mencius. By nature, he was profoundly filial. When Qi Jingling Wang widely propagated Buddhist scriptures and gathered many monks, Meng Jingyi debated with them on the rightness and wrongness of the two teachings. He dissected each matter with flawless reasoning, his words flowing without hindrance. Even the eloquence of Lan Sheng resisting Ying or the persuasive power of Li Gong subduing Po could not surpass him.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* records: Chen Xingming traveled among famous mountains, where he encountered a divine person who told him, "Most who cultivate the Dao cannot persevere for long, thus few witness its fruition. Your accumulated merit is commendable. If you harbor no thoughts of retreat, why fear not being listed in the jade registers? Yet, what comes before is suffering, and what follows is joy. Suffering has its end, but joy is boundless. Dwelling in secluded valleys, keeping company with birds and beasts, enduring hunger and thirst, bearing the hardships of cold and heat, forsaking worldly glory, parting from loved ones—this may be called suffering. But to live as long as heaven and earth, to transform without limit, to ride the void and command the clouds, to sit and grow wings—this is joy. Should you not strive diligently in your cultivation?"

Chen Xingming bowed and said, "I shall forever bear your sacred words in mind and devote myself wholly to the Dao, never daring to be negligent." After eighteen years of cultivation, on the first day of the third month in the first year of the Jin Daishi era, he ascended to heaven from Mount Heng.

Returning to truth, tamed rabbits; Yan He feeding oxen.

*The Record of Mount Heng’s Abbey* states: During the Dazhong era of our dynasty, a man named Song Guizhen abandoned his official post to embrace the Dao. He built a hut beside the mountain, ate *zhi* herbs, and abstained from grains for over thirty years. At dawn and dusk, as he chanted scriptures, white snakes and white rabbits would gather tamely, as if listening. Prefect Zhao Xu named his hut the "Hall of Broad Coldness" and once left a poem as a gift.

*The Zhuangzi* states: The Lord of Lu, having heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Dao, dispatched an envoy with gifts to precede his visit. Yan He dwelt in a humble lane, clad in plain cloth and tending oxen himself. When the Lord of Lu’s envoy arrived, Yan He received him in person. The envoy asked, “Is this the home of Yan He?” Yan He replied, “This is indeed He’s home.” The envoy presented the gifts, but Yan He said, “I fear the messenger may have erred and would incur blame. It would be better to verify.” When the envoy returned to make further inquiry, Yan He could no longer be found.

Teeming fruit rides the tiger; Tai Bai mounts the child.

*The Extensive Records* recount: Wang Shuang was a servant to Zhang Maoshi of Nanyang. One day, he took leave of his master, saying, “I am deeply grateful for your kindness and wish to repay it. My home lies nearby, and its scenery is worth seeing. Would you care to visit?” Maoshi replied, “I would, but I do not wish my family to know. Could we slip away unnoticed?” Shuang said, “That is easily done.” He cut a bamboo stalk, inscribed a talisman upon it, and instructed, “Hold this as you enter your chamber, feign illness, and secretly place it among your belongings. You will then be able to slip away unnoticed.” They traveled south together for several *li* until they came upon a yellow-capped attendant holding a green *qilin*, accompanied by two striped tigers, waiting by the roadside. Maoshi, startled, wished to turn back, but Shuang said, “Have no fear. Press onward.” Shuang then mounted the *qilin*, while Maoshi rode a tiger. Ascending the palm of an immortal, they crossed ravines and scaled peaks, yet felt no roughness of the terrain. At the foot of a mountain, they beheld sights of otherworldly beauty—pavilions, pines, and rocks unlike anything in the mortal realm. Hundreds of purple-robed scribes greeted them by the roadside. Upon entering, dozens of maidens in azure robes, each of extraordinary beauty, bore instruments and led them in, bowing as they went. They were feasted in the central hall, where songs of *luan* birds and dances of phoenixes, along with music of all kinds, filled the air—sounds unheard of in the human world. Their spirits soared in lofty detachment, and they no longer gave thought to worldly affairs. There, they were instructed in the supreme Dao and presented with a hundred *yi* of gold to take home. When Maoshi returned, his family was gathered in mourning, for they believed he had been dead for seven days. Yet his heart remained warm, so they had not yet encoffined him. Thereafter, Maoshi abandoned his official post to wander famous mountains, and none knew his ultimate fate.

*The Record of Extraordinary Persons* states: In the early Yuanhe era, a man at sea witnessed Li Taibai conversing and laughing with a Daoist on a high mountain. After some time, the Daoist mounted a crimson beast amid emerald mist and departed. Taibai leapt up, strode vigorously after him, and caught up to ride eastward together.

The lofty scholar Shan Juan; the immortal official Ma Zhou.

*The Lives of Lofty Scholars* records: Shan Juan was a scholar of high virtue in the time of Shun. When Shun wished to yield the throne to him, Juan said, “In winter, I wear furs; in summer, coarse cloth. In spring, I plow enough to exert my strength; in autumn, I harvest enough to sustain myself. I rise with the sun and rest at its setting, roaming freely between heaven and earth, my heart content. Why would I desire the realm?” He refused the offer and entered the depths of the mountains, and none knew his whereabouts thereafter.

*The Biographies of Immortals* states: In his youth, Ma Zhou was often beset by drunkenness. One day, while leaving the city, he encountered an old man who bowed and sat with him beneath the trees. The old man said, “The Supreme One has commanded you to assist the sagely grandson. Why do you drown in wine, bringing hunger and hardship upon yourself? Your five spirits have already scattered, and you will die soon. Why not awaken?” He added, “You were originally the White Spirit Officer of Mount Hua, an immortal official. Now you are summoned to take up your post.” Zhou followed him and indeed saw his official residence, where his name and rank were recorded. He entered through the gate to find furnaces, fires, and vessels all prepared. Suddenly, five figures stood before him, saying, “Earlier, while you were drunk, we fled. Now, we ask you to close your eyes and reenter the divine chamber.” The next day, he visited Tian Gang, who said, “You have met with destiny. Your position will reach that of chief minister. Strive to fulfill it.” Zhou indeed rose to the rank of grand councilor for several years. Then, true immortals descended to his chamber and said, “Your service to the state is complete. The Great One summons you. You may no longer remain.” He then departed this life.

Bo Yuan gazes into the unseen; Liang Chen wanders in dreams.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: On Mount Huo, Deng Boyuan and Wang Yuanfu, both students of the Dao, received from divine beings the method of "swallowing the solar cinnabar radiance." After thirty-four years of practice, Boyuan could see in darkness and write by night. When his Dao was perfected, the Supreme Emperor dispatched a feathered chariot to ascend with Yuanfu in broad daylight.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* states: The Daoist Liang Chen, styled Kaocheng, was once observed by a physiognomist who remarked, "This youth’s eyes stream with white light, and his countenance gathers true qi—he is no ordinary man." Later, he indeed delighted in the Dao of immortality. In the early Xianxi era, he studied under Master Zheng at Louguan Abbey. Often, he dreamed of wandering with immortals—now ascending famous mountains, now drinking stone marrow—through which he gained profound insight. Many revered and followed him, but Chen, weary of their devotion, retreated deep into the Kun Valley. His eyes could perceive objects beneath the earth, and his ears could hear sounds from miles away. One day, he suddenly told his disciples, "A companion awaits me on the southern peak; I must go now." Donning his cap and robes, he departed, enveloped in swirling clouds. His form vanished, though the faint strains of celestial music lingered in the air. This occurred in the first year of the Taixing era, the year *wuyin*.

Bershan foretells fortune and misfortune; Shouxin guards against calamity and blessings.
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* recounts: Bershanfu, a native of Yongzhou, dwelt on Mount Hua. He consumed yellow essence for over two hundred years. Whenever he visited a household, he discerned the good and evil of its ancestors as if witnessing them firsthand, and his predictions of fortune and misfortune always proved true.

*The Eastern Studio Jottings* notes: In Qinzhou, an elder named Xu Shouxin, known as Second Elder, daily swept the halls and courtyards with a single broom. He never spoke to others; if questioned, he would flee without reply. Yet if he uttered even a single word, it foretold fortune or misfortune. When Minister Lü Xiqing, having completed his mourning, prepared to journey to the capital, he detoured to visit the elder. Bowing, he asked for guidance, but the elder fled in alarm. Lü pursued him, and the elder suddenly turned back, saying, "Guard well, guard well." Lü assumed this meant guarding his wealth and rank. Upon returning to court, he was appointed governor of Jianzhou. When Xu Xi and Shen Gua had newly suffered defeat, Lü pleaded to decline the post and requested to accompany the two chief ministers to the imperial audience. Enraged, the emperor demoted him to governor of Shanzhou—an office corresponding to "single guard." During the Chongguan era, the elder was treated with great favor in spring audiences and granted the title *Master of Serene Harmony*. He was later given residence in the Wanshou Palace of Xianyuan. Chen Xun trades in fresh goods; Qizhen dwells in seclusion and devours meat.

*The Southern Wild Records* states: Chen Xun was skilled in astronomy and excelled in refined recitation. He once chanted:
*"One cauldron, yin and yang, civil and martial fire,
Ten years of cold and heat beneath the demon’s hide.
I tell the eastward-flowing stream: let your temples gray,
In the corner, I’ll cling to my iron raincoat still."*

And again:
*"Heaven and earth have seen the tender shoots of my work,
When dragon and tiger mature, seals and sashes grow sparse.
Late in life, he severed worldly ambitions,
Devoting himself to cultivation, hidden on West Mountain to grow herbs."*

During the Kaibao era, he once entered the city with an alchemist to sell elixirs. If he received praise, he would demand adornments; if he approached a furnace, he would drink as if no one were present. He sang:
*"Lan Caihe, worldly affairs swirl in endless confusion—
How much better to sell medicine, buy wine, and drink,
Then return to empty Kunlun, clapping hands in song!"*

Some suspected he and the alchemist were husband and wife; others claimed he had attained immortality.

*The Primer of Our Dynasty* records: Helan Qizhen, of unknown origin, was a Daoist who claimed to be over a hundred years old. Skilled in qi-absorption, he feared neither cold nor heat, often going without food, though at times he indulged in wine. He wandered the markets, consuming several pounds of rancid meat. Later summoned to court, Emperor Zhenzong presented him with a poem.

Erzhu floats on stone; Bao Jiao embraces the tree.

*The Supplement to the History of the Five Dynasties* records: Master Erzhu’s merits and conduct were most profound. A transcendent being gave him a single pill of medicine, saying, “When you see floating stone, then take it, and the Way of immortality will be achieved.” The master followed these instructions, casting a stone into the water each time he encountered one. Later, while preparing to cross the river at Mount Xia, an official named Shi awaited him with a boat. When asked his surname, the man replied, “Shi.” Asked to which region he belonged, he answered, “Fuzhou.” The master suddenly understood, swallowed the pill, and instantly ascended lightly into the air.

*The Biographies of Recluses* states: Bao Jiao, of unknown origin, ate no grains and wore no silk or hemp. Dwelling deep in the mountains, he consumed wild fruits and clad himself in bark. Someone once asked him, “Wild fruits and bark are also products of heaven—how do they differ from grains and silk?” Bao Jiao then ate nothing more and died embracing the withered branches of a tree.

Yan Dong’s single gourd, Dao Hui’s hundred *hu* of virtue.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: The Daoist Yan Dong, of unknown origin, arrived in Jinling during the Qi dynasty’s Jianyuan era and lodged with the Daoist Li Jingyou. Yan appeared dull-witted, but when engaged in discussion, his insights were profound. He always carried a single gourd with him. After five or six years in Jinling, one day he announced his departure, took up his brush, and annotated the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*, his pen never pausing until the work was complete by day’s end. Later, he entered the mountains of Liyang and vanished without a trace.

*The Collected Works of Xianji* states: Kong Daohui maintained his resolve and refused office. His father, You, was a man of such perfect conduct that it moved the spirits. He lived in reclusion on Mount Siming and once saw several hundred *hu* of coins in a valley, regarding them no differently than tiles or stones. Woodcutters who scrambled to take them found that once in hand, the coins turned to sand and pebbles. A deer wounded by an arrow fled to You, who tended its wound until it healed before letting it go.

The Immortal Lord’s tangerine well, the Divine Maiden’s bamboo altar.
*The Bangjiang Collection* records: The Immortal Lord Su, one day summoned by the Most High to assume a post among the perfected, took leave of his mother, saying, “Next year, this prefecture will suffer an epidemic. Take a cup of water from the well in our courtyard and a sprig of tangerine leaf to relieve the people’s suffering—it will prove most efficacious and also provide a modest means of support.” With these words, he stepped outside, where a host of immortals surrounded him with banners, regalia, and feathered canopies arrayed on either side. Slowly, he ascended into the heavens. The following year, a great plague indeed struck, and his mother used the well water and tangerine leaves to heal the afflicted, none of whom failed to recover at once. The tangerine well remains to this day.

*The Records of Assembled Immortals* states: The Cloud Radiance Lady, named Yaoji, was the daughter of the Queen Mother of the West and could soar and transform at will. When Yu the Great encountered her, he suspected she was some strange apparition rather than a true immortal and asked Tonglü about her. Tonglü replied, “The root of heaven and earth is the Dao; those who wield the Dao’s function are sages. Among the ranks of sages are perfected beings and immortals. Some perceive the qi and attain realization without cultivation—Lord Wood and the Metal Mother are such beings. The Cloud Radiance Lady is the Metal Mother’s daughter.” Thereafter, Yu paid her homage and received from her the methods of water control and channel dredging, as well as texts for summoning spirits and commanding ghosts. The Divine Maiden then transformed into stone; the Goddess Stone on Mount Wu is her metamorphosis. There is also a divine altar there, beside which grows bamboo that droops like a hairpin. If any flying object lands upon the altar, the bamboo sweeps it away with the wind, keeping the altar spotless throughout the year.

Liu Shang’s medicine pouch, Letian’s alchemical furnace.
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* records: Liu Shang lamented how swiftly time passed and how his sinews and bones gradually weakened. Racing about from dawn to dusk, he wearied himself in vain—what benefit did fleeting worldly office bring to his own person? Thus, he feigned illness, resigned his post, and entered the Dao. While traveling in Guangling, he encountered a Daoist selling medicine in the city streets. The Daoist fixed his gaze upon Liu with great intensity, then set down his medicines, took up his carrying pole, and ascended to a tavern, where they drank together. The Daoist presented Liu with a small medicine pouch and playfully recited:
*“For no reason, you came to Yangzhou,
We met and climbed the winehouse tower.
This pouch of medicine I bestow as parting gift—
What more could you seek for a thousand years?”*
Then he departed. Liu opened the pouch to find a paper-wrapped gourd containing nine sesame-seed-sized pills. Following the instructions, he took them and immediately felt his spirit invigorated and hunger vanish. Later, he went to Yixing, enamored of the scenery around Lake Tai, and became a fisherman-recluse in the mountains. Many saw him and said, “That is Master Liu, the former gentleman of the court.” His *Eighteen Stanzas for the Barbarian Lute* circulated in the world.

*The Jottings from Chouchi* records: Letian built a thatched hut on Mount Lu and attempted to refine the elixir, but his furnace and crucible failed. The next day, an appointment as prefect of Zhongzhou arrived—he then understood that worldly affairs do not coexist.

Zhang Shuo’s feathered robe, Yuan Xian’s hempen cap.
*The Biographies of Immortals* records: Zhang Dun of Dongting encountered the immortal maiden Du Lanxiang, who descended into his chamber and taught him the Way of bodily ascension and transformation. She left behind a jade tablet as a token of his attainment of perfection. Commanding a jade maiden to present him with a feathered robe, crimson slippers, and a dark cap, she said, “These are the garments of the highest immortals, not found even in the grotto-heavens.” Zhang then ascended in broad daylight.

*The True Scripture of the Southern Florescence* records: Yuan Xian lived in Lu, his door a wicker gate and his window a clay jar. Zigong arrived in a grand carriage drawn by fine horses, which could not pass through the narrow lane. He went to see Yuan Xian, who greeted him at the gate wearing a hempen cap and wooden clogs, leaning on a staff. Zigong said, “Alas! What ails you, Master?” Yuan Xian replied, “I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty; to study yet be unable to practice is called sickness. I am poor, not sick.” Zigong hesitated, his face flushing with shame. Yuan Xian smiled and said, “To act in pursuit of worldly favor, to befriend for mutual advantage, to study for the sake of others, to teach for one’s own sake, to indulge in the depravities of righteousness, to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.”

Roaming the mountains and abstaining from grains, Zhongdu resisting the cold.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Sun Youyue, styled Yingda, once consumed magic mushrooms and abstained from grains. He also specialized in taking the *Grain Immortal Pills*, his complexion and spirit ever youthful, growing younger with age.

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* records: Wang Zhongdu encountered the Perfected One of Venus, who bestowed upon him the Rainbow Elixir. Thereby he mastered the extremes of cold and heat. Having lived for over two hundred years, in winter he wore but a single layer of clothing and rode a four-horse carriage to accompany the Emperor at Kunming Pond, circling the waters at a gallop. Though the Emperor donned a sable robe, he still felt the chill, while Zhongdu’s countenance showed no change, his back steaming with rising qi. Yet in the height of summer, when exposed to the blazing sun and surrounded by ten braziers, he uttered no complaint of heat, nor did his body perspire. Later, he too ascended as an immortal.

Sun Bo ignited fire; Tan Qiao entered water.
*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: Sun Bo, a man of Hedong, possessed refined talent and skill in composition. He wrote a hundred poems and recited hundreds of thousands of words of scripture. In his later years, he studied the Dao, mastering the extensions of the *Mozi*. He could cause grasses, trees, metals, and stones to burst into flame, illuminating several *li* around, and could likewise transform his own body into fire. Once, while traveling, he encountered an imperial envoy with a retinue of several hundred, yet none were burned. Those who were ill pointed at him and were cured. Later, he compounded the Divine Elixir and attained immortality.

*The Continued Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: Tan Qiao, styled Shengshu, was broadly learned and possessed a prodigious memory. He traveled through famous mountains, practiced grain avoidance to cultivate qi, and took delight in wine. Later, he entered Mount Nanyue to refine the elixir and achieved success—entering water without getting wet, entering fire without being scorched, and mastering transformation and concealment of form. He practiced intestinal cleansing like Ding Ci and tooth-tapping like Bao Zhu.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Every mid-spring, Tu Dingci would have people take purgative medicines. At that time, he would go to a stream and sit beneath a small waterfall, allowing the water to enter his seven orifices—this he called "intestinal cleansing." One day, he sat in meditation and transformed. His family gathered around, weeping, but he revived and said, "It is difficult to bury one who departs while seated." After speaking, he transformed again. For several nights, his complexion remained as if alive. When they proceeded to the burial vault, his coffin was exceedingly light. Those who recognized the signs understood it as a case of *shijie* (liberation by means of a simulated corpse).

*The True Sayings* states: Bao Zhu had no knowledge of Daoist methods or techniques. At the age of forty, he developed facial wind-qi, causing his mouth and eyes to become misaligned. His upper and lower teeth would clatter together audibly day and night without cease. He lived to be one hundred twenty-seven years old. Later, he encountered cold weather and crossed a great river, falling into the Longevity River and drowning. The Northern Emperor repeatedly dispatched killing ghosts, the Day-Roaming Spirits, and the Earth-Calamity Envoys to take him, yet in the end, none dared approach.

The ghost officials inquired into the reason, and the Celestial Slayer replied: "This man employed manifold *fangyan* (esoteric methods) to restrain us. He would constantly knock his teeth and sound the Heavenly Drum to alert the myriad spirits within his body, preventing them from scattering. Thus, ghostly *qi* dared not enter, and so we had no opportunity to seize him. Had Bao Zhu not crossed the river by water, he might have lived beyond a thousand years without fail. As it happened, he encountered extreme cold and walked upon the ice, his jaws clenched so tightly that he could not knock his teeth. Thereupon, the ghosts took advantage of his drowning in the river. Yet even then, the movement of his teeth from the cessation of his wind-disease still served to repel death and ward off the slaying ghosts—how much more so for a Daoist who truly knocks his teeth, sounds the Heavenly Drum, and gathers the spirits!

*Divine Glue* mends the bowstring; *Spirit Mushroom* revives the dead.

*The Supplementary Records of Immortals’ Biographies* states: Emperor Wu of Han, while touring the Northern Sea and offering sacrifices at Mount Da, received four ounces of *Divine Glue* from the Queen Mother of the West via her envoys. The Emperor deposited it in the outer treasury, unaware of its wondrous properties. One day, while hunting tigers in the Hua Lin Park, his crossbow’s trigger mechanism snapped. An attendant requested a portion of the glue, moistened it in his mouth, and used it to mend the bowstring. Once repaired, the Emperor ordered several warriors to pull the string, yet it held fast all day without breaking. The Emperor marveled at this.

The glue originates from Fenglin Isle, where it is concocted from the beaks of phoenixes and the horns of unicorns, hence its name, *Gathering-String Glue*.

*The Extensive Records of the Strange* recounts: Xu Fu, styled Junfang, was of unknown origin. During the reign of the First Emperor of Qin, many wrongful deaths occurred along the roads of the imperial park. Crows would carry grass in their beaks to cover the faces of the dead, whereupon the corpses would immediately revive.

The court officials reported this to the First Emperor, who immediately dispatched envoys to inquire of Master Guigu about the grass. The Master replied: "This is the immortal herb from Mount Zu on the Eastern Sea’s Ancestral Isle, growing in fields of *qiong* jade. It is also called *Yangshen Zhi* (Spirit-Nourishing Mushroom), its leaves resembling wild rice. A single plant can revive a thousand people." The Emperor then sent Xu Fu with three thousand boys and girls, each aboard towering ships, to sail into the sea in search of Ancestral Isle and its immortal herb. They never returned.

Xu transformed from a woman into a man, as did Qiu Zeng.

*The Jin History* records: Xu Deng, a native of Min, was originally a woman who transformed into a man. Skilled in Daoist arts, he could immobilize people with a command, halt flowing water, and make tigers and wolves crouch to the ground. He befriended Zhao Bing as a fellow practitioner beyond the mundane world, and together they perfected their Way, ascending as immortals.

*The Scripture of the Original Acts of the Numinous Treasure* states: In the Northern Chamber lived a diligent and virtuous man named Wang Fudu, who had a daughter named A Qiu Zeng. At sixteen, while bathing in fragrant waters within a secluded chamber, she saw a golden light illuminating her in an unusual manner. She emerged from the pure room and, gazing from a height, beheld the radiant splendor of the Perfected and Divine Immortals. Qiu Zeng then bowed and invoked their names, saying: "Having now beheld the Heavenly Worthy, I wish to transform my body into that of a man." In an instant, her form changed into that of a man. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin then commanded the Venerable Deity of the Southern Pole to be Qiu Zeng’s master, bestowing upon him the true scriptures and assigning golden boys and jade maidens to his service. The Dao spoke to Qiu Zeng: "Having gained the Venerable One of the Southern Pole as your master, is this not exalted? When your merits are complete and your virtue perfected, you shall naturally attain the rank of a Perfected, transcend the Three Realms, swiftly traverse the Nine Clouds, and attend the feasts of the Most High."

Cai Jing passed through a dog’s burrow; Song Qing emerged from a chicken coop.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* records: The Perfected Lord Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, was traveling through Mount Guacang when he passed the home of Cai Jing, a follower of the Dao. Recognizing that Cai’s bone structure was suited to the Way, the Lord came to deliver him, saying: "You are destined to be delivered from the world and fill a post among the immortals. However, you lack understanding of the Dao, and your *qi* is scant while your flesh is abundant. You can only achieve *shijie* (corpse liberation), a method swift as passing through a dog’s burrow." With these words, he departed. Suddenly, Cai’s body grew as hot as fire, and he sought water to douse himself. His family poured water upon him as if quenching a parched thing, yet within three days, he wasted away to skin and bones. He then entered his chamber, covered himself with a quilt, and his body vanished.

Beneath the quilt, the body remained intact, head and feet complete—like the shed husk of a cicada.

From the *Dongwei Annals*: Li Shouzhong, serving as Imperial Messenger, was dispatched to the southern lands. Upon reaching the borders of Qiongzhou, he encountered an old man who called himself Yang Xiajv, aged eighty-one. Yang invited Li to his home, where Li met his father, Ri Shulian, aged one hundred twenty-two, and his grandfather, Song Qing, aged one hundred ninety-five. During their conversation, Li noticed a small child peering out from beneath a chicken coop. Song Qing explained: "This is our ancestor of nine generations past. For several lifetimes, he has neither spoken nor eaten. We do not know his age, but on the first and fifteenth of each month, we lift him down, and the descendants line up to bow before him."

Liang Xu’s piercing gaze, Li Yuan’s harmonious breath.
From the *Baopuzi*: The Daoist Liang Xu, of unknown origin, heard that chewing betel nut could reverse aging and restore youth, and that it allowed one to see ghosts clearly at night. At seventy, he began consuming it and grew ever more vigorous. By one hundred forty, he could run alongside galloping horses. Later, he withdrew into the Green Cloud Mountain.
From the *Xianzhuan Shiyi*: Li Ziyuan dwelled in a stone chamber on Mount Lishang, studying alchemical scriptures and dedicating himself to the Dao. Suddenly, an immortal descended riding a ram and taught him the secret of *qi*-harmonizing breath. After years of practice, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The mountain where he lived is now called the Tenth Transformation. Below flows the Mian River, and the rocks of the mountain still bear the hoofprints of divine rams.

Xun Huan rode a crane, Ruan Qiong shattered a turtle.
From the *Suiyi Ji*: Xun Huan was visiting the Yellow Crane Tower in Jiangxia when he saw something drifting from the southwest—a visitor astride a crane, clad in feathered robes and rainbow garments. Host and guest conversed joyfully. Then, bidding farewell, the visitor mounted the crane, soared into the sky, and vanished from sight.
From the *Yuren Xianhua*: The Perfected Master Zhao was skilled in sending flying talismans to heal people. A girl in the household of Ruan Qiong had been bewitched by a spirit. Her parents summoned physicians and diviners, but none could identify the culprit. Ruan then begged the master for help. The master said: "There is no need for me to go in person. Simply affix my talisman to your door or window, and you will see proof." Ruan placed the talisman on the door. That night, at the first watch, a sound like a heavy blow rang out. He lit a candle and looked—there lay a massive turtle, writhing on the ground. Soon it died, and the talisman vanished. Ruan crushed the turtle’s head and cast it into a ditch. The girl recovered shortly after.

A gallant knight d

Field Xuan cherished a stone fragment, while Yang Qing treasured a bamboo sliver.

From the *Accounts of Divine Transcendents*: Field Xuan lived in reclusion on Mount Heming when he encountered a white-robed divine person who gave him a stone fragment, saying, "Swallow this, and you will never hunger." Xuan consumed it, thereafter attaining the Dao and entering the mountains, never to emerge again.

From the *Sequel to the Accounts of Divine Transcendents*: Yang Qing passed the imperial examinations and was appointed magistrate of Le’an in Taizhou. He abandoned his post and entered the mountains, where he met a crimson-robed figure who called himself Lingying. Lingying led him into a grotto, where he obtained lingzhi and consumed it. "You possess the destiny of a transcendent," Lingying said. He then introduced Yang to Lord Mao, who declared, "Though you bear the bones of a transcendent, you have yet to ascend. You must cultivate on earth." With that, he sent Yang forth. Thereafter, Yang abstained from grain, his body grew light, and when he shook his joints, they emitted the sound of bamboo slats striking a board. He could drink three *sheng* of wine and travel three hundred *li* in a day.

Gang styled himself the Gate of Heaven, while Ba called himself the Valley of Ghosts.

From the *Accounts of Divine Transcendents of the Wang Clan*: Wang Gang styled himself the Master of the Celestial Gate. Well-versed in the methods of nourishing life, he composed a scripture stating: "Yang arises in *yin* (the third earthly branch), the essence of pure Wood; Yin arises in *shen* (the ninth earthly branch), the essence of pure Metal. When Wood is cast into Metal, nothing remains unharmed. Women who use rouge and powder follow the whiteness of Metal. Thus, the Perfected attends to the mysteries, discerning the waxing and waning of forces: I move as the Azure Dragon, while they move as the White Tiger. Before them lies the Vermilion Bird, behind me the Dark Warrior—this is the Way of Undying."

The Master of the Celestial Gate practiced this Way and lived to one hundred eighty years, his complexion like that of a child; he has now ascended to the Dark Continent to become a Perfected One.

Moreover, Wang Fu studied the Dao under Lord Lao, entered Stone Beam Mountain to ingest medicinal herbs, and his countenance remained like that of a child. Later, he moved to Ghost-Nurturing Mountain and styled himself the Master of the Searching Valley. At that time, Su Qin and Zhang Yi sought his instruction. The Master said: "Hearing the Dao is easy; cultivating the Dao is difficult." The two studied for three years before taking their leave. The Master said: "You have labored with four-horse carriages, and your achievements and fame now blaze forth. Have you not seen the trees by the river? Chariots and horses break their branches, waves and rapids erode their roots—such is the fate of those who dwell there. Have you not seen the plants of Mount Song and the pines of Huayin? Their leaves and trunks rise into the azure clouds, untouched by axes or saws; black foxes and red leopards shelter beneath them, patterned crows and vermilion phoenixes roost upon their ridges—such is the fate of those who dwell there. Alas! You two have scorned the enduring longevity of the catalpa and pine, prizing instead the fleeting splendor of a single day. How lamentable!"

Nanchang resigned from office; Yuanyu fled from salary.

From the *True Sayings*: Lord Nanchang of You formerly served as the Spirit Pass Marquis of the Southern Vermilion Yang Celestial Gate under the Northern Emperor. Later, he was transferred to the position of Director of the High and Bright Bureau. In the past, he was dismissed from office for his involvement in the affair of Liu Qingsun; now, he is finally to be reinstated.

From the *Biographies of Recluses of the Jin*: Guo Ma, styled Yuanyu, possessed an extraordinary resolve from a young age. He secluded himself in the Reed Valley of Linsong, carving out a stone grotto to dwell in and consuming *qiao* fruit to lighten his body. Zhang Tianxi dispatched the emissary Meng Gongming bearing credentials, a carriage lined with rushes, and fragrant herbs to summon him with full honors. When Gongming arrived at the mountain, Ma pointed to a soaring swan-goose and said: "How could such a bird be caged?" He then fled deep into the wilderness, refusing all advancement. Gongming detained his disciples, whereupon Ma sighed: "I fled from salary not to evade punishment. How could I, in my seclusion and practice of righteousness, bring harm to my disciples?" He then emerged and accepted the summons.

The mountain elder inscribed talismans; the Daoist drew talismanic diagrams.

From *Tales of the Marvelous*:

Gao Yu wove a boat and anchored at Bright Pool. One night, he peered at the water’s surface and saw three large lotus leaves afloat, upon which three beautiful women sat. They spoke among themselves: "Bright Pool has no bottom, and Tangerine Isle drifts—this is no empty saying." Each then declared her preference: one would study the Buddhist teachings, another the Dao, and the third the Confucian classics. The next day, they divined what food they would receive: "Each according to her inclination."

At dawn, a monk indeed rowed to the center of the current—only to drown. Soon after, a Daoist and a scholar drowned as well, all three perishing in quick succession. Presently, a boat arrived bearing an official who announced himself as the Scribe of Qiyang Mountain. Gao Yu, bewildered by these events, recounted them to the scribe, who grew furious: "How dare you meddle thus?" He took a cinnabar brush, inscribed a talisman, and ordered his disciple to carry it into the depths of the pool. The disciple walked as though on level ground until he reached a great stone cavern, where three white silkworms rested upon an outer boulder. At the sight of the talisman, they transformed into three women in white robes and pleaded: "We beseech the Celestial Master—grant us three days to relocate." The scribe raged: "You must depart by tomorrow, or I will dispatch the Six Ding spirits with swords to slay you."

The next day, black clouds churned with wind and rain, and three great fish surged forth in the current, vanishing downstream.

*The Records of Spirits Searching*: Xu Mao, a man of Wu, was fond of alchemical transmutation. One day, he encountered a Daoist who hung a painted fan upon the wall. There was a crucible, and a boy stood atop it. The Daoist called to the boy, who knelt before the crucible. The painted fan swayed repeatedly, and the flames of the crucible blazed brightly. After a short while, the elixir was complete. The Daoist said: "The alchemical arts of transmutation are governed by the reckoning of Heaven and Earth; they cannot be sought without accumulating merit and piling up good deeds." He then told Xu Mao: "Fifty years hence, you shall seek me on Mount Mao." Then he vanished without a trace.

Wu Gang hews the moon; Cai Dan weeds the lingzhi. *Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang*: An old tradition holds that within the moon stands a cassia tree, a hundred *zhang* tall. Beneath it, the marks of an axe heal as soon as they are made. The man’s surname was Wu, his given name Gang, and he had erred while studying the Dao. Some say the cassia in the moon is but the shadow of the earth, and the empty spaces are the reflection of water—there is nothing there in truth, and this explanation is rather closer to reason. *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity*: Cai Dan loved the Dao and abandoned his home to enter the mountains. Unable to endure the hardship, he returned and deceived his family, saying: "I have become an earthbound immortal, low in rank, herding dragons for the Lord Lao." Later, while playing a game of divine chess, he lost a multicolored, striped dragon and was thus demoted to Kunlun Mountain to weed lingzhi.

Junping wields his divining brush; Wang lacks shamans and physicians. *Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals*: Yan Zun, styled Junping, was a native of Chengdu in Shu Commandery. He was deeply devoted to the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, widely read in the classics, and made his living through divination. When he spoke to a man’s son, his words were grounded in filial piety; to a man’s younger brother, in fraternal duty; to a man’s minister, in loyalty. Yan was skilled in composition and, following the principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi, wrote a work in ten scrolls with a hundred chapters, titled *The Pointing Finger*. Later, his entire household ascended to Heaven, and even his house and pavilions flew away with them. *Biographies of Lofty Scholars*: Wang Zhi of Anqiu, styled Zhongdu, was a native of Changling. In his youth, he studied the *Laozi*, was tranquil and content, and sought no advancement. At the time, he was known as the Venerable Man of Anqiu. When Emperor Cheng heard of his reputation and wished to see him, Wang Zhi declined and refused the audience, instead serving as a shaman-physician among the people.

Jieyu bears the fruit of trees; Qiugong chews pine resin. *Biographies of Immortals*: Jieyu was a man of Chu who delighted in nurturing life. He ate the fruits of grasses and trees and wandered Mount Emei. For generations, people saw him, and he lived for several hundred years. Liu Xiang composed a eulogy for him: "Jieyu delights in the Dao, nurturing his nature in hidden radiance. He satirized Confucius, discoursing on the decline of the phoenix. Embracing the primordial to harmonize, preserving his heart in subtlety. He strides the sacred peaks, chanting long upon Emei." Also, Qiugong was a man of unknown origin who, during the time of Tang, worked as a carpenter. Though he had already lived three hundred years, his complexion grew ever more robust. People knew of his longevity and all revered him as a teacher. They saw him eat nothing but pine resin.

Cangshen heals the crane; Lingxu rides the tortoise. *Records of Strange Matters*: Qiang Shen was utterly filial in serving his mother. When a crane was struck by an arrow, he took it in, nursed it back to health, and released it once its wound had healed. Later, the crane returned with its mate, bearing a luminous moon-pearl in its beak by night as thanks. *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: Yu Lingxu dwelled on Mount Heng for over a decade. He encountered a divine person who taught him the method of the Returning Wind. After practicing it, he could sit and perceive all affairs under Heaven as though viewing his own palm. Yet he concealed his abilities, refusing to astonish the common folk, and no one knew of his powers. He kept a great tortoise, which he called Yuan Dian, four or five *chi* in width. Those who saw it were terrified. One day, his master rode this tortoise into the Nine Nong Mountains and did not emerge. Woodcutters sometimes glimpsed him there.

Congshan borrows a horse; Zhu Chong returns the calf. *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: Liu Congshan, styled Shuntian, studied under the Daoist Wang Taihe at the Jianlong Abbey during the Xiangfu era. In the third year of the Zhihe reign, when Emperor Renzong fell ill, he summoned Congshan to the Great Celebration Hall to present a memorial. The emperor ordered his ministers to bow in his stead upon its completion. The ministers asked: "Has the memorial reached its destination?" Congshan replied: "The memorial has been delivered." By then, the emperor’s celestial retinue had already departed for some time, but suddenly his spirit cleared, and he sent word asking: "What deity is General Ge?" Congshan answered: "Beneath the Three Heavens’ gates stands a deity named General Ge." The emperor then ordered that an altar be swiftly prepared for offerings. The next day, his health was restored, and he told his attendants: "Last night, I arrived at the gates of Heaven, where a certain General Ge said the emperor was not yet fated to come. He urgently lent me a horse to send me back, and so I awoke." *Unofficial History of the Jin*: Zhu Chong, styled Jurong, was known for his perfect conduct from a young age. He was serene, restrained in desire, and fond of learning, though poor. He often tilled the fields and tended crops. Once, a neighbor lost a calf and, mistaking Zhu’s calf for his own, took it home. Later, he found his calf beneath the trees and, deeply ashamed, returned the borrowed calf to Zhu, who refused to accept it. Whenever an imperial edict arrived, he would flee into the deep mountains. His contemporaries regarded him as a latter-day Liang Hong or Guan Zhong.

Dong the Daoist draws his bed; Wang Yao builds his prison. *Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals*: The immortal Dong the Daoist begged for wine and danced as he sang, wandering the world. In the Dazhong era, he often stayed in Hezhong Prefecture. When merchants found him drunk and sleeping by their doors, their wares would sell out at once. People revered him as a divine immortal. Sometimes he feigned madness, singing: "Lotus threads weave a myriad layers of silk; the immortal’s heart is full of cares." When he encountered heavy snow, he would draw a bed in the snow with his staff and lie upon it. If asked whether he was cold, he would reply: "The pines and cedars of the deep mountains fear not the endless snow." His words flowed like verse, and most were of this kind. *Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*: Wang Yao, styled Boliao, was a native of Poyang. He was quite skilled in healing illnesses, and none he treated failed to recover. Yet he performed no sacrifices, used no talismanic water or acupuncture, and did not prescribe medicine. When treating the sick, he would simply spread an eight-*chi* cloth upon the ground and sit. He neither ate nor drank, and after a short while, the patient would recover and rise, whereupon he would depart.

Where malevolent spirits wrought harm, Yao would trace a prison upon the earth, summoning them forth—all appeared in their true forms within the bounds, be they fox, hare, or serpent. He would then behead them or burn them to ashes, and the afflicted would instantly recover.

Wang Guo loathed the dust of the world, while Yuanjian cut himself off from the common.

*Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*:
Wang Guo, a worthy man of Chu, despised the filth of worldly winds and the stench of fame and profit. He withdrew into the mountain forests, cultivating stillness and humility in all his deeds. One day, he ascended upon a cloud and departed.

*Record of the True Realm*:
During the Tang, the Ritual Master White, named Yuanjian (his courtesy name unknown), was a native of Chengdu in Western Shu. In the year the Illustrious Emperor fled to Shu, he received ordination under a special dispensation and resided at the Upper Emperor’s Abbey. His resolve was to sever all ties with the mundane, wandering freely and soaring afar. Light as the wind, he drifted through the years, traversing rivers and lands as suited him, following the footsteps of recluses of old. At last, he settled at the Abbey of Heaven’s Pillar in Yuhang, where he vanished in the Yuanhe era.

Ziming’s tiles turned to gold; Li’s stones became jade.

*The Transmission of the Celestial Masters*:
Zhang Ci, styled Ziming, was the sixteenth-generation descendant of the Celestial Master. Inheriting the true methods of the Perfected, he annually transmitted the esoteric registers of all ranks during the Three Primes. Possessing Daoist arts, he could transmute tiles into gold—some cast into water would ignite flames, others revert to tiles. Later, when he departed this world, celestial music resounded in the void.

*Idle Tales of Rustics*:
The Perfected Lord Li Tuo of Changli Mountain in Hanzhou, whose given name is lost to record, had refined "water jade" and the Nine-Florate Elixir in these mountains since the early Western Zhou. Three journeys and returns spanned over eight hundred years, earning him the name "Li Eight-Hundred." Once the elixir was perfected, he could coat stones to turn them into jade and transform grains of sand into pearls. Even now, after rains, one may still gather five-colored true pearls there. During the Jianwu era of the Later Han, he ingested the elixir and ascended upon a dragon. The site of his alchemical refinement remains, its stone walls suffused by the elixir’s qi, all transformed into hues of gold and jade, radiant beyond compare. A rectangular impression, over a foot long, resembles a human footprint. Later, a Buddhist temple was erected there, and the monks falsely claimed it to be the footprint of Mahākāśyapa. Though the tale has endured through the ages, it was in truth the site where the Perfected Li Tuo refined "water jade."

Yuanhua subdued ghosts; the Immortal Elder flogged shamans.

*The Transmission of Eminent Daoists*:
The Daoist Zhang Yuanhua, whose origins are unknown, was once summoned to a tavern by a guest. When Yuanhua declined wine and meat, citing his sacred registers, the guest grew irate. Yuanhua scrutinized him and discerned his inhuman nature. "Pray, return briefly," he said, "and await me." Drawing his sword, he lured the creature beyond the city walls, commanded it to sit, and slew it—revealing a ghost with crimson hair and a blue face, no larger than a child of five or six. He carried its head to show the people, declaring, "This ghost dared deceive me, so I executed it to rid the people of harm."

*The New Record of the Elixir Terrace*:
The Immortal Elder Ge Yuanxing passed through Wukang, where the host lay gravely ill. A female shaman was summoned to invoke spirits, who demanded the elder drink wine. When he refused, the spirit spoke insolently. "How dare you?" the elder said. He then commanded the Five Marshals to seize and drag the spirit out, flogging its back. Though no one was visible, the sound of lashes filled the air, and blood flowed from the unseen form. By the time they reached the central courtyard, the spirit was seen embracing a wooden post, stripped of its garments. The host’s illness was cured.

The First Emperor drove stones; the Jade Maiden played pitch-pot.

*Records of the Bizarre*:
The First Emperor of Qin constructed a stone bridge across the sea to observe the sunrise. When the laborers moved the stones too slowly, a divine being whipped them until they bled. To this day, the bridge’s stones retain a reddish hue.

*The Record of the True Realm* further states:
Beside the road to the Dongxiao Abbey in Lin’an, atop a stone cliff, an inscription records: The First Emperor, resentful that mountains blocked the Eastern Sea, commanded ghostly soldiers to relocate this peak. As the mountain began to shift, a transcendent suddenly appeared, rebuking the ghosts and pressing his body against the mountain to halt its movement. To this day, imprints of his shoulders, hairpin, and cap remain deeply etched into the cliff.

*The Biographies of the Immortals*:
Shu Wangfu played pitch-pot with a Jade Maiden. Each toss encompassed twelve hundred isles. Should a throw miss, Heaven would emit a sharp, hissing sigh—like laughter.

King Mu’s Eight Steeds and the Magistrate’s Twin Apparitions.
According to the *Primary Account*: King Mu of Zhou, enamored of the Dao of transcendents, harnessed his eight steeds to ascend Kunlun Mountain, where he partook of the fruit of the royal tree. After paying homage to the Queen Mother of the West and receiving the secret of ascending to Heaven, he later cast off his mortal form to demonstrate to the people that all things must end.

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* records:
Wang Qiao, magistrate of Ye County during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, was guarded by divine attendants. On the first and fifteenth of each month, he would journey to the capital to pay court to the emperor. Perplexed by the frequency of his visits yet the absence of any carriage or escort, the emperor secretly ordered the Grand Scribe to observe him. The scribe reported that as Wang approached, a pair of hares would arrive from the southeast. When the hares appeared, they were caught in a net—only to reveal themselves as a pair of black crows, which were in fact the shoes bestowed upon him by the emperor four years prior as a gift for the Minister of Works.

The Grand Void Receives the Seal; Daoquan Bears the Talisman.
*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* states:
Cheng Taixu, a native of Xichong in Guozhou, devoted himself to stillness and solitude, dwelling on Mount Min in the south. He fasted and sat in oblivion until one evening, when a violent wind uprooted trees, thunder crashed, and lightning split the sky amid torrential rain. In the courtyard, a hollow in the earth bubbled with boiling water. Stirring it with his staff, he retrieved two jade seals with double knobs, which proved remarkably efficacious. Each year, people from far and near sought his aid, and those who received talismans from him would bring them to his door to be stamped with the seal. The recipients flourished, their wealth and fortune increasing, and with it, they relieved the poor and aided the needy, to universal acclaim.

Another figure, Yin Daoquan, cultivated the Dao of *Dongzhen* on Mount Heng, refining his spirit and attaining the power of penetrating vision. He bore the talismans of the Five Emperors and the Six Jia, as well as the *Left and Right Spirit-Flight* talismans. Heavenly immortals descended to him and declared: "Those who ascend in broad daylight must possess both talent and the Way. Emperor Wu of Han, Liu Che, was moved by descending immortals who bestowed upon him the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* and the *Twelve Matters of Spirit-Flight*, yet he only attained the Dao of *shijie*—casting off his corpse—without achieving the full transformation of body and bones. You have received but one of these, yet your aspiration for transcendence is clear. This is the fruit of your diligent cultivation, as well as the destiny allotted to you in past lives."

When asked about the *Twelve Matters of Spirit-Flight*, the immortals replied: "The *Spirit-Flight* was originally bestowed by the Metal Mother to enable Emperor Wu to pacify the Five Peaks and bless the myriad people. Yet he ultimately failed to perfect the supreme transformation of non-action, instead indulging in militarism and exhausting his armies, spilling blood and slaughtering lives. He thus forfeited his own fortune and could not, like the Yellow Emperor or Yu the Great, ride dragons, shed his form, and vanish into the light. This was his loss."

Zhou Fu the Pavilion Keeper; Ding Du the Master of the Seal.
*The True Sayings* records:
The current Pavilion Keeper of the Southern Gate is Zhou Fu. At the Post Pavilion, there are two pavilion keepers, while the Fourfold Gate of the Luminous Mirror has four Gatekeepers of the Four Directions. The Gate of Heaven alone has nearly eight Gatekeepers of the Four Directions.

*The Comprehensive Record of Marvels* states:
During the Qingli era, a court official set out before dawn to attend the morning audience. On the main thoroughfare, he saw over thirty beautiful women, resplendent in fine attire, riding two by two as if leading a procession. Soon after, Ding Guanwen Du, surrounded by his retinue, followed on horseback. The official exclaimed in surprise: "Ding is usually so frugal—why does he have so many concubines?" A man riding at the rear replied: "Not so. These are immortal women come to welcome the Master of the Hibiscus Pavilion." At the time, Ding was on leave from court, and shortly afterward, news of his death arrived.

The Old Man of the Southern Pole; the Maiden of the Western River.

*The True Dao Annotations* states:
In the *Primal Record of the Seven Sages*, the Red Lord descended to deliver teachings, transforming his appearance to that of a śramaṇa, and together with his six disciples, revealed their names and identities. It is also said: in the primordial qi, he is the Primal Lord; in the Primal Palace, he is the Primal Marshal; at the Southern Asterism, he is the Old Man of the Southern Pole; in the Great Void, he is the Perfected of the Great Void; on Mount Nanyue, he is Master Redpine. He is the teacher of the Four Perfected of the Celestial Thearch and the companion of the Great One.

*The Biographies of Female Immortals* records:
The Maiden of the Western River was the niece of Boshanfu, a divine immortal. Through diligent cultivation and ingestion of elixirs, she lived for over two hundred years, her appearance growing ever more youthful. Seeing her nephew afflicted by illness in his youth, she gave him medicine. Though he was already seventy, he gradually regained his youth, his complexion like that of an infant. During the Han dynasty, an emissary passing through the Western River region saw a woman outside the city walls striking an old man with white hair, who knelt to receive the blows. The emissary, astonished, inquired about this. She replied: "This is my son. Long ago, my uncle Boshanfu attained the Dao of divine immortals. Taking pity on my frequent illnesses, he gave me divine medicine, and I gradually regained my youth. This son of mine refused to take the medicine I offered, and so has grown decrepit with age. I am angry with him, and thus punish him." The emissary asked their ages. The woman answered: "I am two hundred and thirty years old."

Silver flowers rained from the heavens; stalactites were tapped for their essence.

*The New Record of the Elixir Terrace* states:
Yao Tan, styled Yuantai, was once honored by Duke Xiang of Jin, who knelt and faced north to call him teacher. He savored the Dao in the cool breeze for many years. One day, his disciples went out and saw silver flowers falling from the sky in profusion, scattering upon the earth. After a long while, they vanished. That day, the Primal Lord of the Great Simplicity dispatched immortals to welcome him, bestowing upon him scriptures and appointing him Perfected of the Mystic Continent, overseeing the White Water Palace.

*The Biographies of the Immortals* records:
Koushu was a scribe of Zhou. Skilled in circulating qi and refining his form, he boiled stalactites to ingest their essence, calling it "stone bell milk," and lived for several hundred years. He came and went within Mount Taishi, where an outer stone bed served as his pillow. When the summer winds arose, Liu Qingyun would ascend.

*The Unofficial History of Jin* records:
Xia Tong, styled Zhongyu, was a native of Kuaiji. During the Shangsi Festival, when all the nobles and officials of Luozhong, down to the common gentry, gathered at the floating bridge, with men and women thronging the roads and carriages and robes illuminating the way, Tong sat in his boat, paying no heed. The Grand Commandant Jia Chong found this strange and questioned him. Tong slowly replied, "I am Xia Zhongyu of Kuaiji." Chong said, "In ancient times, even Yao sang, and Shun sang. Could you sing a song and let others harmonize with you?" Tong replied, "In the assemblies of former lords, the grace of the myriad states spread like clouds, and the sagely transformation still lingers in the people’s songs of gratitude." Thereupon, he composed a song of longing. Then, striking his foot against the boat and lifting his voice in a resonant, impassioned melody, a great wind arose in response. When he shouted, thunder and lightning gathered in darkness; when he let out a long whistle, sand and dust swirled into the air. The nobles turned to one another and said, "Had we not traveled to Luoyang, how could we have seen such a man?" Tong later returned to Kuaiji, and his ultimate fate remains unknown.

Master Wu’s *Discourse on the Mystic Principles* states:
Someone asked, "In ancient times, there were divine immortals. Why are they not seen today?" The answer: "The pure and the turbid flow in separate streams, and the subtle workings of the true differ in their realms. How could they be seen?" It also says, "Lingwei returned briefly after a thousand years, and Hunyuan has descended repeatedly even to this day. How can you say they are no longer seen?" Again, it asks, "Who are the immortals of today?" The answer: "Since the Tang dynasty, they may be briefly described: Liu Qingyun ascended in the land of Shu, Wei Shilong soared in Songyang, Dao merged with the cicada’s molting in Taiyi, and Dongyuan’s bones took flight in distant lands. The imperial transformation reverses aging, and Qi Yi returns to the true."

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* records:
Huanghua, known as Lingzi, attained the method of returning to the origin and reversing aging. His scripture states: "This method can repel weapons, guard one’s household, protect children and bless descendants. Those who see it rejoice; those who do not long for it. It aligns with the hearts of the divine and wins the favor of the people." He lived among men for over five hundred years, yet his complexion grew ever more youthful.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records:
The Daoist Zhang Qizhen, styled Qi Yi, was a native of Qiantang. At the time, King Zhongyi revered the Daoist arts and, every third and eighth day of the lunar month, held purification fasts, entrusting Qizhen with their oversight. During the Taiping Xingguo era, Emperor Taizong established the Taiyi Palace and summoned the purest scholars from across the land to reside there. Qizhen was selected and summoned to the imperial palace, where he again found favor. Later, the emperor, noting errors in the Daoist scriptures, ordered scholars from both streets to correct them, and Qizhen once more took part. One day, as he lay down to rest, he vaguely saw a crimson-robed official arrive with a tally, saying, "By command, Zhang is to swiftly purify himself of filth and proceed to that place to take up his duties." At dawn, he summoned his disciples and told them, "I am about to depart. Remember this well." Then, in tranquility, he returned to the true.

Meng refined the hun and po; Elder Wang cultivated the spirit.

In the *Declarations of the Perfected*: Shan Shiyuan received the teachings of Master Meng. At dusk, he would first recite the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* once, then retire, allowing his hun and po to refine themselves. By practicing this Way for twenty-one years, he too attained immortality—this is the method of reciting it ten thousand times, though even three or four recitations suffice.

The Lady of Northern Peak, Jiang, recited this scripture, which also preserved health and granted immunity to illness—this is the Way of not dying.

In the *Records of Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*: Elder Wang’s origins were unknown. He befriended Feng Junda and sought the Dao among the famous mountains. There, a divine being told him, "Your spirit moves heaven. The Most High has sent me to transmit to you the secret of transcending the world. Yet the Dao of immortality is not distant—it is near, drawn from your own body. Without thought, without care, neither exhaling nor inhaling, the true unity fills the within, and you shall attain long life and ascend in flight.

Thoughts and cares flit about, wearying your form. The Most High abides in unbroken continuity, effortless in its application—this is the true Dao."

With these words, the divine being ascended to heaven.

To save a friend with talismans, to gather kin in honor of ancestors.

From the *Supplementary Records of Immortals*: Mu Jiangfu was devoted to the Dao and unmoved by fame or profit. He befriended Tiao of the Eastern Ford of Chang’an, and whenever he visited, they would drink wine and discourse on the Dao for days and nights on end. One day, Tiao suddenly died, throwing his household into panic. They sent for Jiangfu, who arrived at night and, upon hearing the news, smiled and said, "He can be saved." He then removed his robe and lay beside Tiao beneath the covers, cautioning the family not to cry out in alarm but to respond when called. Blowing out the candle, he slept. At midnight, he relit the candle to find Tiao sitting up, saying, "Just now, a messenger in yellow robes took me away, but soon I heard an order: 'The Great One has sent a swift envoy to bring him back.'" Tiao then recovered as before. Jiangfu vanished without a trace.

Elsewhere, Huang Fengxian of Mengyang once entered Geqi Mountain, where a Daoist taught him arts of transformation. A wealthy man of the same county, surnamed Song, gave his daughter to him in marriage. Song’s relatives were numerous, and their visits for feasts and greetings lasted over a month without end. One day, the relatives jested, "We wonder what sort of banquet Huang will prepare for his in-laws." Fengxian promptly replied, "Tomorrow, I shall modestly prepare wine and dishes—may all of you attend." That day, over eighty guests from the neighborhood arrived, visiting his home daily. Though Fengxian had made no prior arrangements, his courtyard suddenly appeared immaculate, the tables laden with exquisite delicacies, and the decorations—paintings and ornaments—unlike anything found in western Shu. All was wondrous beyond compare. The guests were awestruck as music played softly, and they drank to intoxication. Those who tried to leave found two serpents coiled around the pillars at the door, and in terror, none dared depart. Later, when the truth became known, Fengxian, ill at ease with his newfound fame, moved his family to Taihua Mountain in Dongchuan.

The maiden absorbs qi, the perfected rides the clouds.

From the *True Sayings*: Weizi was the daughter of Zhang Qing. While in the *Yi Qian* office, she often ingested misty qi, claiming it was the essence of mountains, marshes, water, and fire, the vital breath of metals and stones. With prolonged practice, she could dissolve her form into emptiness and merge her body with the clouds.

From the *Records of Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*: Wang Daozhen, a man of the Han, attained the Dao and dwelled on the eastern ancient terrace of Guigu Mountain. A white cloud often emerged from the terrace, appearing from afar like a towering pavilion. Daozhen would ride this cloud to play atop the mountain, returning at dusk. The white cloud would then withdraw into the terrace—this was the Guigu Mountain north of Qinghan in Jingzhou. Some mistakenly call it the Yang Terrace, but this is incorrect.

Yin loses his parents’ care, Wu lacks their sweet nourishment.

From the *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*: The Daoist Yin Tong, styled Lingjian, was well-versed in classics and history. He often lamented the impermanence of worldly things and would gaze at the heavens in sighs. His parents, disbelieving, pressed him to marry and pursue an official career. Kneeling, he pleaded, "I have heard that Zhang the Perfected ascended to heaven, and Zhen Nan followed in his footsteps. The Mao Lords attained the Dao, and the prefect submitted in sincerity. How much more, as descendants of the Great Ancestor, the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, should we not carry on this illustrious legacy? I beg to follow my calling." His parents relented, and he departed in a gust of wind. By the time he lost his parents, his filial duties were already fulfilled, yet his resolve to preserve the One and guard the truth only grew stronger with each passing day.

Emperor Taiwu of Wei, having heard of his reputation, held him in particular reverence.

*Ancient and Modern Poetic Talks* records: Wu Renbi traveled to Luofu Mountain, where he studied the Lao-Zhuang teachings under Master Zhang and grasped their essential meaning. Upon taking leave to return home, he planned to journey to the capital to sit for the examinations. The master said, "Observing your qi and destiny, you may remain here—I shall teach you the Dao of longevity." Renbi declined, citing his aged mother’s need for care, vowing to withdraw from worldly pursuits once he had achieved renown, for it would not be too late to study then. That same year, he passed the imperial examinations and traveled to Zhe to pay respects to Qian Wusuo, who received him with exceptional courtesy and invited him to join his staff. Renbi declined, expressing his refusal in verse:

*My tattered sable ill befits the lotus pavilion,*
*My frail form still shames the tortoiseshell pin.*
*Beneath the mountain moon, the Han’s glow spans ten leagues—*
*How can I bear, from this moment, to betray my longing for home?*

Wusuo ordered him to compose the *Record of Luocheng*, but Renbi refused. Enraged, Wusuo banished him to the river, and the people of Wu mourned his fate.

In the early Jianlong era, Ning Xu and others conducted a jiao ritual at Luofu Mountain. After the ceremony, they explored the mountain’s caves and grottoes. Upon reaching the summit, they saw a stone gate where an elderly scholar, clad in creeping fig and dodder, sat guarding the entrance. Xu inquired about the place, and the scholar replied, "This is the abode of the Master of Luofu." When asked who he was, the scholar answered, "I am Master Wu, named Qibi." With these words, the door closed, and nothing more was seen.

Wang Kuo’s wine was rich, and Yunsheng’s oranges were sweet.

*The Immortal Biographies of the Wang Clan* states: During the Xiantong era, Wang Kuo of Jingzhou embarked on a boat voyage across Dongting Lake. A fierce wind arose, forcing him to moor at the foot of Jun Mountain. He disembarked with several companions, and suddenly, the scent of wine filled the air. When he asked his companions, none detected it. Nearby, a cave appeared by the path. Kuo entered and, after a few steps, found a depression in the cave where the wine’s fragrance was intoxicating. He cupped his hands to drink and became pleasantly inebriated. From then on, he felt invigorated and free of illness, gradually losing his taste for grains. He entered the famous mountains to study the Dao. Later, in the *Scriptures of the Immortals*, he read: *"On Jun Mountain lies celestial wine; those who drink it ascend as immortals."* The wine he encountered was this very nectar.

*The Record of Extraordinary Persons* recounts: Chen Yunsheng entered Longhu Mountain. During the Tianyou era, he was seen on Magu Mountain—seventy years had passed since he left home, yet his appearance remained unchanged. The prefect welcomed him to the prefectural seat, where they sat together at night. Yunsheng remarked, "The oranges of Fengcheng are sweet; I have been craving them." Shortly after, he presented a hundred oranges.

Deng Yu observed the crows, and Shangqiu herded the swine.

*The Original Biography* states: Deng Yu secluded himself on Mount Heng, abstaining from grains for over thirty years. At night, he recited the *Great Grotto Scripture*, and in response, the Celestial Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount descended to address him: "You possess the destiny of an immortal; I have come especially to visit you." One day, he suddenly saw three azure crows, crane-like in size, dancing, flying, and calling—after some time, they departed. Observing them, Yu said to his disciples, "The azure crows have come; the imperial audience is near." Thereupon, he dissolved his form and departed.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* recounts: Shangqiu Zixu delighted in herding swine. He often played an iron flute, and though seventy years old, he had no wife or children, yet his complexion showed no signs of aging. The villagers marveled at his extraordinary nature. When asked the essentials of his Way, he would only say: "Eat water-plantain and drink water—naturally, one does not hunger." Thus, he lived for over three hundred years.

Fu Wen savored yellow melons; Zhan Gong, white plums.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: Fu Xian’s origins were unknown. He often stayed in Ju, frequenting the shrines along the seashore. Suddenly, three immortals appeared in a shrine, playing a game of dice with melons as stakes. They hired him to carry several dozen yellow and white melons, instructing him to close his eyes. When he awoke, he found himself on Fangzhang Mountain, south of Penglai.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: In ancient times, during the reign of Gao Xin, there was an immortal named Zhan Shanggong who planted plums on the Hidden Dragon Ground of Mount Mao, filling the land with them. Zhan Gong now serves as the Right Guardian of the Nine Palaces. He often tells others that when he once lived below Huayang, he ate white plums of exquisite flavor. Though it seems but a short time since, three thousand years have already passed.

*Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns*, Scroll Eighteen
Compiled by Daoist Chen Baoguang of the Orthodox Unity Tradition.

Lu dug for sustenance, while the Qu family buried coins.

*The Extensive Records* states: There was a man of Mount Lu who possessed Daoist arts. One day, he passed through the borders of Fuzhou and moored his boat at the estate of the scholar Lu. Someone remarked that the man of Mount Lu was no ordinary person, so Lu paid him a visit to seek an auspicious response. The man of Mount Lu said: "Do not travel this year, for calamity will strike at any moment. Behind the hall where you live lies a jar of coins, covered by a plank. These are not yours. The rightful owner is now only three years old. Beware of spending even a single coin, or misfortune will follow. Can you heed my warning?" Lu bowed in gratitude.

Once the man of Mount Lu departed and the ripples on the water had yet to settle, Lu laughed to his wife: "If the man of Mount Lu speaks thus, what more could I desire?" He ordered his servants to dig several feet into the ground, and indeed, they found a plank. Beneath it lay a large jar filled with scattered coins. Overjoyed, Lu and his wife gathered them, threading the coins with grass fibers. As they neared ten thousand, their children suddenly suffered unbearable headaches. Lu exclaimed: "Could the man of Mount Lu’s words be coming true?" He rushed on horseback to catch up, apologizing for breaking the precept. The man of Mount Lu grew angry: "You have invited misfortune upon your kin. Weigh the value of profit against the cost yourself." He poled his boat away without a backward glance. Lu galloped home, performed a ritual, and his children recovered.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* says: On Liangchang Mountain during the Han dynasty, there lived a family named Qu at its base. They were immensely wealthy, possessing hundreds of millions in wealth. They buried bronze vessels there, which remain to this day. There are also coins, located on a small hill to the northwest.

Xian’an of Purple Radiance, Bo’er of Red Lotus.

The *Original Biography* states: The Southern Wei Lady, named Hua Cun, styled Xian’an, received a visitation from the Perfected of the Great Ultimate in her chamber on the winter solstice at midnight. They set out wine and delicacies, presenting her with purple radiance of primordial clouds.

*The Supplement to Immortal Biographies* records: Zhang Bo’er cultivated the Dao on Stone Drum Mountain in Shu during the Western Jin. His devoted practice moved the immortals, who suddenly descended and said to him: "This mountain bears the herb of eternal life, the night-shining mushroom. Consuming one allows one to ascend to heaven in broad daylight. The herb grows by the water’s edge; at night, it appears as a red lotus." After years of arduous search, he found and ate it, gaining the ability to fly and see through all things. He then rode away on a red tiger, and none knew his whereabouts.

The Parrot of Gui Shun and the Cuckoo of Wen Xiang.

*The Return of the Uncanny* records: Liu Gui Shun, sailing from Baling, was caught in a storm and landed on Jun Mountain. After walking several li, thousands of parrots called out his name, saying: "Liu the Twelfth, buffeted by wind, you’ve reached this wondrous realm—what was misfortune has become beauty." Suddenly, two Daoists appeared and said: "You’ve been struck by the *gang* wind; why not hasten back?" They handed him a foot of silk and instructed: "Cover your eyes with this, and you shall depart at once." Gui Shun suddenly flew back to his boat.

*The Continuation of Immortal Biographies* records: Shang Wen Xiang styled himself "Seven-Sevens." When Zhou Bao governed the Western Zhe region, he treated Wen Xiang with great favor. Bao said to him: "The azaleas of Crane Forest Temple are renowned throughout the world. I once heard you sing while drunk: *‘Who brews the wine for distant journeys? / Who makes the flowers bloom in an instant?’* Can you make these flowers bloom for the Double Ninth Festival?" Wen Xiang replied: "Very well." The day before, he lodged at Crane Forest Temple. At midnight, a woman appeared and said: "I am commanded by the heavens above to oversee these flowers. They are not long for this mortal realm. Today, I open them for the Daoist." On the Double Ninth, the flowers indeed bloomed in radiant splendor. Later, amid the ravages of war, they returned to the celestial gardens.

The Three Flutes of Junqing and the Single String of Tai Zhen.

*The Extensive Records of the Uncanny* records: Lü Junqing moored at Jun Mountain on a moonlit night, drinking wine and playing the flute. Suddenly, a fishing boat drew alongside. An old man held a flute as thick as clasped hands and said: "This is the music of heaven; it cannot be played." He then produced a second flute, the size of those used in the world, and said: "This is the music of the grotto-heavens." Finally, he showed a third, as slender as a brush handle, and said: "This is the flute of mortals." He played the smallest one once or twice, and waves surged violently. After three or five notes, boats and oars danced upon the water. Terrified, Lü begged him to stop. The old man ceased playing and chanted:
*"An old man of the Xiang reads the Yellow and the Old,
Hand grasping purple reins, seated on emerald grass.
When spring arrives, he forgets the depths of the Xiang’s waters;
At dusk, he loses the road to Baling."*

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* records: Tai Zhen was the daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. She and the Lady of the Eastern Peak frequented Mount Tai, dwelling in deep seclusion where mortals could not tread. A thousand *zhang* above the earth, her abode held jade tables and golden treasures. Each time she plucked a single string of her zither, a hundred birds would gather, soaring and dancing to her music.

The Shattered Seal of Master Cui and the Opened Casket of Ling Zi.

*The Records of the Hall of Manifestation* records: Ten *li* east of the commandery, deep in the mountains, stood a Daoist abbey where the priest Yan resided. A stone coffer, three feet in length, was sealed with sturdy locks. It was said that when Master Yin ascended, he entrusted this casket to his disciples, warning them never to open it, lest great disaster befall them. When Prefect Cui arrived in the commandery and heard of this, he ordered the seal broken. Opening the coffer, he found only talismans and registers. Suddenly, Cui died violently. After three days, he revived and said: "I was seized by the officials of the underworld. Why did I open the Realized One’s stone coffer? Now the Celestial Emperor has decreed that my lifespan be shortened and five of my official appointments revoked. I have only two years left." Indeed, Cui died two years later.

*The New Records of the Alchemical Terrace* records: Fan Ling Zi was devoted to the Dao from his youth. After many years, he encountered Sima Jizhu, who was entering the mountains of Chang. For seven years, they dwelled in a stone chamber. In the northeast corner was a stone window, and each time Jizhu departed, he would say: "Do not open it." This warning was repeated many times. One day, Ling Zi could no longer resist and opened it. Below, he saw his family—parents, siblings—so near yet untouchable. Overcome with sorrow, he wept. When Jizhu returned, he sent Ling Zi home. Later, Jizhu entrusted him with a bronze casket, again cautioning him not to open it. Ling Zi once more disobeyed, and as before, he saw his family. Jizhu sent him away, and he never attained the Dao.

The Peerless Grace of Lü Hua and the Unmatched Beauty of Shao Yuan.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: E Lü Hua claimed to be from the Southern Mountains, though none knew what immortal she was. A woman of twenty or so, clad in blue, her countenance was of peerless grace. On the night of the tenth day of the eleventh month in the third year of the *Shengping* era, she descended to the home of Yang Quan. She presented him with a poem, a fire-washed cloth handkerchief, a gold hairpin, and a jade armlet. When asked about her identity, she said: "I am Luo Yu, a woman of the Dao from Nine Farmers Mountain. I have already lived nine hundred years."

*The Extensive Records* records: Cui Shao Yuan was the youngest daughter of Cui Gong, Prefect of Fenzhou during the Tang. Her mother dreamed of a divine figure clad in crimson, riding a green dragon and holding a purple coffer, which he presented amid azure clouds. Fourteen months later, she gave birth to Shao Yuan. At birth, an extraordinary fragrance filled the air. Her hair covered her eyes, and her ears reached her cheeks. Her beauty was unparalleled. She was once the Left Scribe of the Jade Emperor in the Heaven of No Desire.

The traces of Master Qiu’s crane linger, while Fangping sheds his form like a cicada’s molt.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Master Fuqiu once accompanied Wang Qiao on a journey to Wangwu Mountain, where they rested their cranes along the way. Wangwu Mountain bears a Terrace of Resting Cranes, upon which crane tracks remain to this day. There is also a secluded abode of Master Fuqiu, and the southern peak is now called Nanling.

*The Arrayed Biographies of Transcendents* states: The Daoist Wang Yuanzhi, styled Fangping, was recommended as a worthy and upright scholar and was repeatedly promoted to the position of Gentleman Attendant. Proficient in astronomy, he withdrew to live in the mountains and forests. When the Han emperor repeatedly summoned him, he refused to appear. The prefectural governor was ordered to escort him to the capital, yet Fangping sealed his lips and spoke not a word. He told his disciples: "My allotted years are nearly spent; tomorrow I shall depart." When the appointed time came, he dissolved without a trace, like a cicada shedding its husk.

Ji Jing refined his essence, while Qian Keng held his breath to still his qi.

*The Secret Formulae for Cultivating Perfection* states: The Daoist Ji Jing, at the age of one hundred and seventy-eight, remained robust and vigorous. Each morning, he would swallow the Jade Spring to polish his teeth. The Jade Spring refers to the saliva in the mouth. Upon waking but before rising, he would rinse his mouth until it was full of saliva and then swallow it. He would polish his teeth thirty-four times—this was called "refining the essence."

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* records: Qian Keng was none other than Peng Zu. Skilled in guiding and extending qi, whenever he fell ill, he would hold his breath to attack the afflicted area. His qi would course through his body, reaching even the tips of his fingers, and soon his body would be harmonized. He once said: "The superior adept transforms without external aid; the middling adept employs different coverings; the inferior adept relies on medicinal herbs. Yet even if one consumes a hundred medicines, it is not as good as solitary fasting." Later generations compiled his methods of guiding and absorbing qi into *The Scripture of Peng Zu*, which circulates in the world.

He Fang’s pulse-sight, Yuan Chao the dwarf.

*The Records of Origins and Transformations* states: At the end of the Tang, the scholar He Fang once purchased an ancient scroll. As he read it, he found a coiled strand of hair four inches in circumference within its pages, forming an endless loop. At the broken ends, more than a sheng of water dripped forth. When burned, it emitted the scent of hair. Fang often spoke of this to a Daoist, who exclaimed: "Alas! You are indeed of common bone—encountering this, you cannot ascend in feathered transformation. It is fate." According to the *Scriptures of the Transcendents*, if a white fish consumes the character for "divine transcendence" three times, it transforms into this object, called *maiwang* ("pulse-sight"). At night, one places the loop toward the star at the center of the sky, and the star’s envoy will descend at once, allowing one to seek the elixir of returning cinnabar. If this water is mixed and ingested, one’s bones will be exchanged, and one will ascend. Fang then examined the ancient scroll and found several worm-eaten passages. Upon deciphering their meaning, he realized they were all characters of the divine transcendents, and he prostrated himself in reverence.

*The Extensive Records* states: In the second year of Guangde of the Tang, the rebel Yuan Chao of Linhai County invaded Yongjia. His fleet was blown thousands of li away by the wind until they spied a distant mountain, verdant and towering, with walls and ramparts gleaming in five colors. They steered toward it and docked, finding the gates unbarred and no one within. In the chambers, they saw only over twenty Hu saddles, along with a great quantity of Shu brocade and golden vessels. As the rebels saw no one, they began to seize the items. Suddenly, a woman emerged from the golden city and said: "Are you not Yuan Chao’s followers? How have you come here? What use do these objects have for you, that you so recklessly take them?" She turned to the saddles and said: "Do you think these are for dogs? They are not—they are for dragons. You should return them at once." The rebels each returned the items they had taken. They then asked where they were, and she replied: "This is the place where the Compassionate Immortal of Mirror Lake cultivates the Dao."

Tao Kan’s cranes mourned; the Dao aligned, and locusts vanished.

*The Collected Writings of the Worthy* states: When Tao Kan was observing the mourning period for his mother, two visitors came to offer condolences. They departed without weeping and transformed into divine cranes, soaring into the heavens. The people of the time found this extraordinary.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: The Daoist Liu Daohe encountered a divine person who said to him: "I have heard that you are fond of the Dao and that your resolve and integrity are unyielding." He then bestowed upon him the talismans of the Alliance of Might for summoning and subduing spirits. Daohe received and swallowed them, and from then on, his Daoist arts never failed to take effect. When Emperor Gaozong was about to perform the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, the rain did not cease. The emperor ordered Daohe to perform exorcisms and prayers, and the skies soon cleared. He was favored with rewards, which he distributed to the poor and needy. When Luoyang suffered from a plague of flying locusts, Daohe presented his talismans to the officials, instructing them to distribute them throughout the region. The locusts vanished at once.

Qi Hui returned to his chamber; Huixu built a bridge upon the waves.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* states: The Daoist Qi Hui studied under Master Su and obtained the methods of the *One and the Cavern* and the *Art of the Dipper*. After practicing them for many years, he attained profound mastery. He once read in the scriptures of the transcendents that those who wished to become immortal guests should enter Mount Taibai. Thus, he selected his disciples who were devoted to the Dao and set out together. Upon arrival, they returned, and within his chamber, the laughter and conversation of divine transcendents could often be heard.

*The Extensive Records* states: Huixu was a monk of Guoqing Temple on Mount Tiantai. One day, while traveling with companions, they came to a stone bridge. Huixu crossed it and ascended a sheer cliff, where he saw an old man who asked: "It is said in the world that those who cross this bridge will see arhats. Where are the arhats?" The old man replied: "This place is a blessed land of divine transcendents, a lower palace of the Celestial Emperor, the Golden Court of the Land of Immortality. Here, the Lord of the Upper Perfected, Tongxiang, presides over thirty thousand ranked transcendents and three hundred perfected beings. Once a year, the Most High descends to this hall to assess the merits and practices of those who study the Dao across the world. This is no abode for arhats." The monk asked: "Can one study to become a transcendent?" The old man said: "Accumulate merit and refine your conduct, and you may ascend to heaven in broad daylight." He then led Huixu a few steps forward, and suddenly the old man vanished. In an instant, Huixu found himself before Guoqing Temple. Thereafter, he changed into Daoist robes and devoted himself to the study and refinement of elixirs. On Mount Zhongnan, he encountered the old man again and obtained an elixir. After consuming it, he ascended into the heavens. Some say the old man was none other than Zhang Guolao.

Nie Yu met Peng and Cai; Xie and Mei encountered Xiao.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: The Daoist Nie Shidao resided at Zhaozhen Abbey in Nanyi. One day, he entered the mountains in search of the Perfected Cai. As dusk fell, he saw a woodcutter and asked: "Where are you going?" Upon hearing that the Perfected Cai was secluded there, Nie expressed his wish to pay homage. The woodcutter said: "It is too late to reach him now. There is a household ahead where you may stay the night." Nie proceeded and saw a thatched cottage. A farmer there asked: "Where are you going?" Nie replied: "To seek the Perfected Cai." The farmer said: "The woodcutter you just met is the Perfected Cai." Nie sighed: "To meet a divine sage and not recognize him—is this fate?" The farmer offered him lodging, and Nie retired for the night. When dawn broke, the host had not yet risen, so Nie set out on his way. He encountered an old man who invited him to sit upon a rock. Asking where he was going, Nie recounted his purpose. The old man said: "The farmer you stayed with last night is the Perfected Cai’s son." Then he added: "Your Dao-qi is abundant, but your immortal bones are not yet fully formed." He plucked a blade of grass and gave it to Nie to eat. When Nie looked up, the old man had vanished. Upon returning, Nie told his fellow Daoists, who said: "In one journey into the mountains, you met three immortals. The old man was the Perfected Peng. You saw both the Perfected Cai and his son, as well as the Perfected Shan—surely this marks the height of cultivating the true."

*The Continued Biographies of Immortals* states: Xie Xiutong journeyed to Mount Jie, where a divine being told him: "The Jade Bamboo Mountain of Lu is a detached palace of the Controller of Destinies. You should go there to refine yourself." Xiutong followed this advice. One day, deep in Hanyuan, he suddenly passed a grand estate and saw a youth emerge. The youth asked: "Are you not Xie Xiutong? The Perfected Xiao and Mei have awaited you for a long time." He then led Xiutong to meet the two perfected beings. Xiutong bowed and said: "A mere ant in the dust of the world, I have long yearned for the Dao. Now my withered bones are revived, and I have gained hope of attaining the primordial assembly." The perfected beings then bestowed upon him pine needles and five ears of fine grain to eat. Later, Xiutong attained the Dao through *shijie* (release from the corpse). He remained in the world, unharmed, though Chang Zong suffered from illness.

*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Tao Tianhuo was a native of Nan’an who lived by the sea. One day, the sea waters suddenly surged, and his family fled in panic to escape the disaster. Tianhuo had just been born, and his mother, carrying him, could not keep up. The whole family wept for him. When the waters receded and they returned, they found the child unharmed, nestled in the fork of a mulberry tree. Thus, he was named Tianhuo ("Heaven-Alive"). As he grew, he displayed keen insight and an abundance of true qi. During the reigns of Emperors Xian, Mu, Gong, and Wen of the Tang, he served as an Inner Offering Daoist. At that time, none among the high ministers and great officials did not revere and admire him. Later, he returned to the seashore and never emerged again.

*The Garden of Discourses* states: Chang Zong was ill, and Laozi asked him: "Your illness is severe. Have you no final teachings to leave your disciples?" Zong said: "When passing one’s hometown, one alights from the carriage—do you understand?" Laozi replied: "Is this not to say one should not forget one’s origins?" Zong said: "Ah, yes. When passing a tall tree, one quickens one’s pace—do you understand?" Laozi said: "Is this not to say one should respect the elderly?" Zong said: "Yes. Open your mouth—is my tongue still there?" Laozi said: "Yes." Zong asked: "Are my teeth still there?" Laozi said: "Gone." Zong said: "The tongue endures through softness, while the teeth perish through hardness. This is it. The affairs of the world are all encompassed herein." Zhang’s servant turned gold into an inkstone; Xie’s immortal wielded an iron brush.

*The Extensive Records* states: Jiang Sheng of Wu Commandery lived in reclusion on Mount Siming, where he devoted himself to refining elixirs. After many years, he had yet to succeed. One day, among the poor laborers he hired, he found a servant named Zhang Quansu, who spoke of divine elixirs. Jiang rebuked him: "You are a mere servant—do not speak recklessly." Zhang then took out a gourd and removed a single pellet, saying to Jiang: "This elixir can transmute earth into gold. May I borrow your inkstone to demonstrate?" Jiang did not believe him. That night, Zhang suddenly died. Before his body could be encoffined, it vanished, leaving only his clothes and belt behind. The inkstone, however, had turned to purple gold.

*The Gleanings of Forgotten Lore* states: He Xiangu resided in Lingling County of Yongzhou. When Teng Zijing was serving as prefect of Yueyang, one evening a great thunderstorm struck. After it cleared, three characters remained on the cliff of the western peak of Huarong: "Xie Xian Huo" ("Xie the Immortal’s Fire"). The script was strange and wondrous. The prefect ordered the characters copied and inquired about their meaning, but no one knew. Someone said that He Xiangu of Lingling might know, so he sent an envoy to ask her. The immortal said: "This is a ghost from the Thunder Department. He and his brother both enjoy writing with iron brushes. The man is three feet tall." The prefect sent someone to verify this at the western peak, and it was indeed so.

Zhang Kuan observed the stars; Shan Sheng swallowed the sun.

*The Six Quilts* records: During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a woman was bathing in the Wei River, her breasts seven feet long. The emperor, astonished by her strangeness, sent someone to inquire. She replied: "The driver of the seventh carriage knows my origin." At the time, the Shu native Zhang Kuan was serving as a palace attendant. He answered: "The celestial star governs sacrifices. If rites are performed without purity, the Woman Star appears."

*The Scripture of Perfected Warrior* states: Long ago, Empress Shansheng dreamed of swallowing sunlight and gave birth to Perfected Warrior. Born divine and spirited, he grew fierce and valiant. Refusing the throne, he devoted himself to cultivation, aiding the Jade Emperor and vowing to sever all demons under heaven and protect all beings. Day and night within the royal palace, he made this oath, and his father could not restrain him. He abandoned his home, bid farewell to his parents, and entered the Wudang Mountains to cultivate the Dao for forty-two years. His merit complete and fruit ripe, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Qu Yuan was exiled; Jia Yi was demoted.

*The Record of Forgotten Tales* recounts: Qu Yuan, exiled for his loyalty, withdrew to the Yuan and Xiang rivers. Clad in blossoms and feeding on herbs, he mingled with birds and beasts, shunning worldly affairs. He gathered *xiangshi* fruit to harmonize his osmanthus bones, nurturing his spirit and heart. Driven by the king’s persecution, he threw himself into the waters of Qingling. The people of Chu, longing for him, called him the Water Immortal. His spirit wandered the celestial caverns, his essence descending upon the banks of the Xiang. The people of Chu built a shrine for him, which endured until the end of the Han. Within those mountains lay a numinous grotto. Those who entered to gather herbs found themselves in a realm of radiant skies and rosy clouds, fragrant flowers and shadowed willows, vermilion towers and jade pavilions—palaces unlike any in the world. Maidens in rainbow skirts, their faces fair as ice and beauty unmatched, offered them nectar and bestowed the elixir of cinnabar. Hunger and thirst vanished. Upon returning to their villages, they found neither home nor kin. Seeking out their ninth-generation descendants, they were told: "Our distant ancestor entered Dongting Mountain to gather herbs and never returned. Three hundred years have passed."

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Jia Yi, formerly an attendant in the Western Bright Capital, was demoted for mishandling matters under Ma Rong and assigned to guard Mount Tai. The Lord of Mount Tai soon requested him as a marshal, and the appointment was approved.

The stone likeness of the Young Lord; the golden hairpin of the Supreme Perfected.

*The Record of Forgotten Tales* records: Emperor Wu of Han summoned Li Shaojun and said: "I long for Lady Li. Can I see her?" Shaojun replied: "You may see her from afar, but she cannot share your curtained chamber." In the Eastern Sea lies the *qianying* stone, blue in hue and light as a feather. In bitter cold, the stone grows warm; in scorching heat, it chills. Carved into an image, it is no different from a living person. If this stone likeness is sent, the true person will come." The emperor later obtained the stone and ordered artisans to carve it into the form of the lady. When finished, it was placed behind a sheer gauze curtain, appearing as if alive. The emperor rejoiced greatly.

*The Supplementary Biographies of Transcendents* states: Yang Youtong, originally named Shiwu, was taught in his youth the arts of summoning and defense by a Daoist. After Emperor Ming’s flight to Shu and the incident at Mawei, the emperor could not cease thinking of his consort. He summoned Shiwu to his traveling court and asked about her. Shiwu replied: "Though she may be in heaven, earth, the darkest depths, or among ghosts and spirits, I can seek her everywhere." The emperor commanded him to search thoroughly, yet no trace was found. Later, in the western ruins of the Southern Palace on Penglai Mountain, where a host of immortals dwelled, the Supreme Primordial Female Immortal Zhang Taizhen was none other than the consort. Shiwu went to see her. She said: "I am a handmaiden of the Supreme Palace. The emperor is the Perfected Person of the Vermilion Palace of the Great Yang. By karmic destiny, his worldly attachments were strong, and he was banished among men. After one cycle of twelve years, you shall meet again." She then took half of the gold hairpin and inlaid box from the Kaiyuan era, along with a jade hairpin, as tokens. "When the emperor sees these, he will surely recall them." With these words, she wept and departed. Shiwu presented the objects to the emperor, who was moved to silent tears for a long time.

Yuanzi observed the precepts; Jiwei maintained long fasts.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: In his youth, Yuanzi was fond of the Dao and diligently observed its precepts and disciplines. With wholehearted devotion, he practiced austerities, taking only vegetables at midday. He refined his form and preserved his essence, refusing all external distractions. Though summoned by provincial and prefectural authorities, he declined every appointment. At times, he wandered into the mountains and forests, shunning the dust of the world. His aspirations were to emulate Master Wangzi Qiao on Mount Weicen and to follow Lord Lingyang on the steps of Buyuan. Thus, he changed his name to Yuanzi and styled himself Yanqi.

*The Esoteric Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* records: Jiwei once maintained a long fast for three years, offering single-minded devotion in his quest. Thereby, he was able to absorb the radiant qi of the sun and moon, and his body became suffused with divine light.

Zengzi mended shoes; Madame He wove sandals.
*The True Scripture of Southern Florescence* recounts: When Zengzi dwelled in Wei, his garments were threadbare, his complexion swollen and sallow, his hands and feet calloused. For three days, he did not kindle a fire; for ten years, he did not sew new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its cords snapped; when he grasped his lapels, his elbows showed; when he slipped on his shoes, his heels protruded. Yet he dragged his feet and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth as though issuing from metal or stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a minister, nor could the feudal lords befriend him. Thus, those who cultivate the will forget the body; those who cultivate the body forget profit; and those who attain the Dao forget the heart.

*The Extensive Records* tells of Madame He the Second of Guangzhou, who made her living by weaving. At the age of twenty, she lived with her mother and had never practiced the arts of immortality. One day, she suddenly declared, "I am weary of staying here; I wish to follow the Dao." The next day, she flew away to Luofu Mountain, where she would come and go, often visiting the northern slopes of Xiaosi Mountain. In Xunzhou, four hundred li from the Southern Sea, stood a yangmei tree several dozen arm-spans in girth. Madame He would gather its fruit and return in time for her fasts. During the Kaiyuan era, the prefect dispatched envoys to summon her. On the way, one envoy, captivated by her beauty, had not yet spoken when she suddenly said, "If the envoy harbors such thoughts, I cannot stay." With these words, she rose into the air and vanished, leaving no trace of her whereabouts.

A soldier embraced a stone; an old man by the river met a locust tree.
*The Record of Seen and Heard* relates: Beneath Yellow Crane Tower in Ezhou lay a luminous stone called Stone Radiance. The stone was said to mark the cave of an immortal. An elderly soldier guarding the pass would rise each morning to bow before the cave. One evening, when the moon was as bright as a painting, he saw three Daoist masters emerge from the cave, laughing and reciting poetry. As they prepared to return inside, the soldier followed them. The Daoists asked, "Who are you?" The soldier explained his presence and begged for wealth and honor. The Daoists replied, "Within this cave, ask the stone to embrace a piece and take it away." The soldier did so, and upon examining the stone by daylight, found it had turned to gold.

The *Traditions* record: There was a man named Jiang Zhi who was skilled at playing the flute and could produce the sound of a dragon’s roar. Later, he traveled to Quexiang and, at the Pan Dou Inn, fell asleep drunk beneath a great locust tree by the roadside. That night, he saw a figure several dozen feet tall who said, "A young master from the Jing Mountain Lodge has come to visit his elder brother." Soon, he heard someone descend from the locust tree and engage in conversation. At dawn, Jiang went to the Jing Mountain Lodge and saw a locust tree ten arm-spans in girth in the courtyard. Suspecting it was a numinous being, he said, "I seek the Dao but have not met a teacher. If the spirit of this tree is efficacious, I beg for your instruction." The spirit replied, "Go into Jing Mountain and seek Immortal Aunt Bao. You will surely attain transcendence." Jiang entered the mountain and indeed met a divine teacher, who said, "You bear the physiognomy of Qin Gao. I now bestow upon you a jade flute. If you play it for three years, you will summon a dragon from the grottoes to bring you the Water Elixir. Swallow it, and you will become a water immortal." Three years later, while playing the flute in the tower of Yueyang Temple, a dragon transformed into a man and presented him with the elixir. After consuming it, Jiang’s appearance reverted to that of a youth, and he could enter water without getting wet.

Ancient men forgot official ambitions; Han ministers upheld their integrity.
*The Traditions of Divine Immortals* tells of Gu Yuanzhi, who died after drinking wine. Three days later, he revived and said he had wandered through the Land of Harmonious Spirits, where rare flowers and precious fruits never withered, and the fields were filled with giant gourds containing the five grains, sweeter and more fragrant than the millet and rice of the Middle Kingdom. The climate was perpetually mild and pleasant, like the second or third month of spring. The people of that land spent their days carrying baskets to gather herbs, singing joyfully, and dispersing at dusk. After reviving, Yuanzhi distanced himself from worldly affairs, entirely forgetting his official ambitions. He roamed mountains and rivers, styling himself the Master Who Knows Harmony. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

*The Traditions of Divine Encounters* records: During the Tang dynasty, the chancellor Han Kuang governed the Jiangnan West Circuit. Proud and overbearing, he harbored rebellious intentions. A traveler named Li Shun moored his boat at Jingkou one night when his lamp went out. Suddenly, he was blown to the foot of a mountain. Disembarking to seek help, he walked five or six li and came upon a magnificent palace. A man in a black headscarf and casual attire addressed him, saying, "I wish to entrust you with a letter for Minister Han of Jinling. Do not refuse the effort." When Li asked where he was, the man replied, "This is Guang Sang Mountain in the Eastern Sea, where Master Kong, the Perfected Official, governs after attaining the Dao. Minister Han is none other than Zhong You. His nature is stubborn and self-reliant, so the Master fears he may disrupt the penal system and has sent this letter to admonish him." Li took the letter and returned to his boat, which soon arrived at its original mooring. He delivered the letter to Han, who opened it to find nine ancient characters he could not recognize. Suspecting sorcery, he detained Li Shun. Then, a guest with arched eyebrows and ancient attire arrived, claiming expertise in ancient scripts. Han showed him the letter, and the guest said, "This is a letter from Confucius, written in the tadpole script of the Xia dynasty. It reads: 'Admonish Han Kuang to uphold his ministerial integrity and not act recklessly.'" Han was astonished. From then on, he remained silent and restrained, preserving his reputation to the end.

Wind arises from Xun; snow is avoided by Ge.

From *Records of the Uncanny*:

Jinzhou Prefect Xiao Zhizhong planned to hunt on the La Day festival. A woodcutter on Mount Huo saw a tall figure, and soon tigers, rhinoceroses, deer, boars, foxes, and hares gathered around. The tall figure said, "I am an emissary of Yuanming, sent by the Northern Emperor. On the La Day, Prefect Xiao will hunt you. Some of you are fated to die by hawk, others by arrow." An old elk knelt and begged for salvation. The emissary said, "Yan Si of East Valley is skilled in strategy." The beasts followed him.

The woodcutter trailed them to a thatched hut, where a Daoist in a yellow cap sat. The old elk pleaded piteously. The Daoist said, "If I command Teng Liu to send snow and Xun Er to raise winds, Prefect Xiao will not hunt." The woodcutter returned home. Before dawn, wind and snow filled the day, and Prefect Xiao did not venture out.

From *Extensive Records*:

Cui Xizhen was adept at painting and devoted to self-cultivation. One snowy day, he saw an old man in a straw raincoat sheltering under his gate. Cui invited him inside. As they stood before a screen, the old man glanced around and vanished without a trace. Behind the screen hung a painting of a pine tree with an immortal and a thatched hut beneath. Perplexed, Cui consulted Master Li Hanguang, who said, "This was painted by the third son of Immortal Ge. It suggests that those who attain the Dao live as long as pines and bridges."

Embracing the One, he roams free; Lu Hong bows like a chime-stone.

The *Stele of Immortal Child Wu* states: "Embracing the One, he roams free, scorning wealth and nobility in times of peace. Luxuriant cinnamon trees cannot conceal the moon’s radiance; sheer green peaks cannot hinder the passage of white clouds. Words are insufficient—the Dao lies within." The rest of the inscription is omitted.

Another poem reads:
The sagely lord seeks those beyond the world,
All summoned to the Golden Gates to glimpse the empty truth.
I wish not to display my name,
But to befriend Tian Yuan, who embodies the Dao.

Long ago, the Immortal Child presented this text to Master Zhu Ziying of Mount Mao. After receiving it, the messenger vanished, and Zhu suspected the Immortal Child himself had come. The Immortal Child’s surname was Wu, given name Baoyi, and people called him Wu the Immortal Child.

From *Miscellaneous Tales of the Northern Dream*:

Emperor Ming of Tang summoned the hermit Lu Hong of Mount Song. Only after three summons did Lu arrive. When he was received in audience, he did not bow but merely bent like a chime-stone. Asked why, Lu replied, "The *Daodejing* says, 'Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust—how can one rely on it?' This mountain-dwelling subject, Hong, dares to present himself with loyalty and trust." The emperor marveled at him.

The aged Pan’s feast, the jade immortal’s bitter herbs.

From *Records of Primordial Transformations*:

During the Yuanhe era of the Tang, after a storm at Shaolin Temple on Mount Song, an old man leaned on a staff and knocked at the gate seeking shelter. The temple attendants, having already barred the door, directed him to an empty hut outside, which had neither bed nor mat. After the second watch, monks saw strange lights outside the temple and went to investigate. Inside the hut, they found lavish curtains and a feast spread out, with the old man drinking and eating at ease. At dawn, the old man rose, rinsed his mouth, and gathered the bedding, curtains, and screens into a gourd. The hut was once again empty. When asked his name, he said he was surnamed Pan and was traveling north from Mount Heng to Taiyuan. Later, some claimed to have seen him again.

From *Green Jade Fragments*:

Zhang Shining, an assistant instructor in Taiyuan Prefecture, fell gravely ill and was near death. He chanted:
*"The jade emperor’s palace with banners of kingfisher plumes,
Purple clouds and towering pavilions—home of the immortals.
Why ask if worldly things scatter like blossoms?
Turning back, Wu Ling’s flowers now lie fallen and spent."*

After he died, his spirit descended upon his sister, saying: *"I am registered as the Eighteenth Jade Immortal of the Tenth Grotto in Heaven. While attending a feast at Jasper Pool, I reviewed the ledger of earthly immortals’ merits and deeds. Catching the scent of idle tea leaves, I lingered and failed to arrive on time, thus incurring the penalty for tardiness. The Queen Mother of the West petitioned on my behalf, noting that someone had asked about sharing wine. I was to be exiled to repay this debt, drifting through mortal life. Now, I return to my celestial register."* He then sang:
*"Rest, rest, rest—
When rest is stolen, best to rest,
Joy fills the house without end."*

Of the Daoist lineage: the red carp of Immortal Master Fu, the white fish of Gongyuan.

From *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*:

Immortal Master Fu Zongzong dwelled in seclusion on Ziyang Mountain. Emperor Ming of Tang summoned him to court. At the time, the Li River in Lizhou was prone to drowning, and ferrymen pleaded for relief. The master cast a talisman into the river. The next day, two red carp were found dead on the shoals, their bellies inscribed with cinnabar characters:
*"Red carp, red carp,
Born in river waters,
Failing to avoid the immortal’s decree,
Rightly meet your end."*
The prefect memorialized the event, and an imperial edict ordered a shrine built by the river.

Furthermore, Luo Gongyuan had lived for several centuries during the Tang, shifting between old and young, so none recognized him. Once, when the prefect hosted a feast for officials in the prefectural gardens, the gentry and commoners gathered in throngs. Suddenly, a man in white appeared, and a young boy shouted at him: *"You dare leave your post without permission!"* The man in white departed. The officials seized the boy and reported him to the prefect. When asked his name, the boy replied: *"Luo Gongyuan. I just saw the Dragon King and drove him away on your behalf."* The prefect did not believe him and asked: *"Can you reveal your true form?"* The boy answered: *"That is no difficulty."*

He then bored a hole and channeled water into it, whereupon a white fish leapt forth with the current. A thread of blue smoke arose, and in an instant, black mist stretched across the sky, thunder and lightning crashed, and rain fell—transforming into a white dragon that soared away. Red whiskers fell, and purple radiance gave rise to new beard growth.

From *Traditions of Divine Transcendents*:
The Red-Whiskered Master, a native of Feng, was said to have been the fish warden during the reign of Duke Mu of Qin. He consumed pine nuts and asparagus root, and whenever his teeth fell out, they regrew; when his hair shed, it returned. Later, he ascended Mount Wu in the south, and after seventy years, none knew his whereabouts.

From *Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang*:
The presiding Daoist nun of the Eastern Mound Sage Mother Temple, Kang Zixia, claimed that in her youth, she dreamed of being summoned to a place where she was told: *"A celestial decree commands you to assume the role of General and inspect the Southern Marchmount."* Thereupon, she was clad in golden armor and set upon a steed, leading over a thousand attendants as butterflies swarmed toward the south. Suddenly, her whiskers sprouted, and the Marchmount Spirit prostrated himself before her horse. In her dream, she issued commands as though in waking life, traversing every peak of the marchmount and every valley of the Man and Han peoples.

In a daze he returned, awakened by the quail’s cry—thereupon, dozens of whiskers sprouted upon his face.

The Bao brothers, heaped kindling for mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.
From *Declarations of the Perfected*:
The Lord of Life and Destiny said: "The female adept Bao Guan’s seventh-generation ancestors, Li Zhan and Zhang Lü, once kept an inn at Weiqiao. They accumulated hidden virtue, loved the Dao, and longed for transcendence, so their blessings extended to Guan. They were made to change their generations, refine their forms, and be reborn as brothers. Though their ancestral roots differed, their lapsed virtue was the same, so they were destined to be born into the same clan. Now they dwell as immortals in the Grotto-Heavens."

From *Extensive Records of the Strange*:
The imperial chess master Wang Jixin followed Emperor Minghuang in his western flight to Shu. One night, they lodged at a house by a deep stream where a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law attended to their needs. As dusk fell, the household shut its doors. That night, Jixin heard a voice say to the daughter-in-law: *"This fine evening offers no diversion—shall we play a game of encirclement chess?"* Though no lamp burned in the hall and the two women remained in their separate east and west chambers, the daughter-in-law said: *"I place a piece at east five, south nine."* The mother-in-law replied: *"I place a piece at east five, south twelve."* The daughter-in-law then said: *"I place a piece at west nine, south ten."* The mother-in-law said: *"The night has reached the fourth watch."* After thirty-six moves, the mother-in-law declared: *"You have been pushed north—my victory is but five boards."* At dawn, Jixin asked the old woman for instruction. She glanced at the daughter-in-law and said: *"This man may be taught the standard formations."* The daughter-in-law then demonstrated the methods of attack and defense, capture and rescue, reinforcement and resistance—though briefly. The old woman said: *"This alone will render you peerless among men."* Jixin walked away a few steps, then turned back—already the house had vanished.

Zhou Bao’s reburial, Qi Sheng’s thatched hut.
From *Investigations into the Divine*:
Zhou Bao, Military Commissioner of Zhexi, was repairing the city walls when, at the Crane Grove Gate, he uncovered an ancient tomb. The coffin was nearly rotted, yet when opened, a woman lay within, her face as though alive, her garments unspoiled. The foreman reported this to Bao, who inspected it himself and said: *"She must have consumed an elixir and awaited the proper time for her transformation—now the hour of dissolution has come."* He ordered her reburied with full honors, providing a carriage and musicians for the procession. Bao and his officials watched from a height as the cortege proceeded. After several *li*, a purple cloud enveloped the hearse. All saw a woman emerge from the carriage, seated upon the purple cloud as it rose slowly into the sky. After a long while, it vanished. When the coffin was opened again, it was empty.

From *Biographies of the Immortals*:
In his youth, Qi Longming found a dragon hatchling in the earth, shaped like a palace guardian. He built a thatched hut to raise it. When the dragon grew large, it destroyed the hut and departed, its whereabouts unknown. Some fifty years later, Longming suddenly appeared, riding a dragon, and said: *"This year, five hundred *li* from here, there will be a flood."* People took it for an omen, but when the time came, a great deluge indeed occurred, drowning tens of thousands.

The Virtue-Resting Fish Offering and Ziqian’s Dried Meat Sacrifice

*Sequel to the Biographies of the Immortals*:
Cao Dexiu often told people: *"If your household suffers illness, come seek my talismans and medicines. I ask no payment of silk or coin—only a platter of river fish prepared as *kuai*,* with a flagon of fine wine to feast me, and the illness will heal of itself."* The villagers revered him as a divine being. One day, he announced: *"I shall now depart for the Heavenly Treasure Grotto. Yet next year, cattle plague will rage fiercely. I leave my name for you to transmit this teaching: when the cattle plague comes, prepare *kuai* as an offering and inscribe my name on a slip to affix to the oxen’s horns—then they shall suffer no harm."* Later, when a great cattle plague indeed struck, all oxen in the district bearing his inscribed slips were spared, while those without perished.

*Records of Mount Wuyi*:
The Supreme Numinous Lord, Perfected Immortal Hua, dispatched his disciple named Shuqi, who rode the clouds astride a crane, to wander this mountain. The people often called him the Crane-Riding Immortal. In former times, a certain Prince Wei named Ziqian, along with Zhang Zhan, Sun Chuo, and others, cultivated the Dao here. When a severe drought occurred, Prince Wei set out wine and dried meat to sacrifice to the immortals and pray for rain. Moved by this, the Crane-Riding Immortal descended from the clouds upon a white horse, and timely rains fell. Zhang Zhan and the others, having witnessed this, composed a quatrain in silent admiration:
*Upon Mount Wuyi, the Lord of Wuyi,*
*White horse and trailing reins enter purple clouds.*
*Mid-air, only the three libations of wine are heard—*
*O’er Dragon Pool’s waves, the rain scatters and scatters.*
The immortal was greatly pleased by the poem.

Su Lin’s breath cultivation, the ancient worthies’ ingestion of elixirs.

*The Records of Divine Transcendents* states: Su Lin encountered Master Juanzi, who instructed him, saying, "If you wish to become a Perfected One upon the earth, you must first ingest elixirs and expel the Three Corpses, slaying and extinguishing the grain-worms. Those who consume elixirs without expelling the Three Corpses—though they may cease eating grains—will find the worms still alive. Merely abstaining from the Five Grains while engaging in breathing exercises and laborious practices will only cause the worms to multiply, making immortality unattainable." Thereupon, he transmitted to him the Dao of the Three Primes and the True Unity, adding, "This may only be imparted to those recorded in the registers of immortals. This scripture is secret; do not transmit it to the unworthy."

*The Supplementary Biographies of Transcendents* recounts: The former worthy Yang traveled through renowned mountains and wandered among grotto-heavens. From Ge Yong, he learned the Dao and, because of the site of Ge’s transformations, built a dwelling there. After a year, one night he suddenly beheld a radiance bright as daylight, and the Perennial Immortal descended. Asked about his cultivated Dao, the former worthy bowed deeply and replied, "This humble one is but dust and earth, witnessing the swift passage of years. Ever fearful of sudden demise, my sole aspiration is to transcend the world." Moved by compassion, the Perennial Immortal bestowed upon him the Essence of Cinnabar. After ingesting it, he ascended in broad daylight.

Zou Tongwei’s purity and clarity, Li Gen’s marvels.
*The Continuation of the Arrayed Biographies* states: The Daoist Zou Tongwei, of unknown origin, possessed a spirit of purity and clarity. He often roamed famous mountains, and many knew him. At times, he would vanish, leaving none able to fathom his whereabouts. Once his elixir was completed and ingested, he ascended in flight from atop a wineshop.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* records: Li Gen, a native of Xuchang, could transform his shape, conceal his form, and enter fire and water. All marveled at him. A female disciple secretly read his plain-text writings and learned that he had been cultivating the Dao for seven hundred years, counted day by day. Some say Li Gen’s eyes had square pupils, for the *Scriptures of the Transcendents* state: "At eight hundred years, a child’s pupils become square." Li Gen often told his disciples, "Though I have not yet attained equality with Heaven and Earth, I am no longer a man of the lower realm."

Zhong Ruoxu’s yellow calf, the spontaneous Cinnabar Brother.
*The Western Pure Poetry Talks* relates: When Zhong Ruoweng was military commissioner of Pingdong, a certain adept sought an audience. He stood in the courtyard led by a cowherd boy pulling a yellow calf. Ruoxu, struck by the strangeness of the scene, pointed to the cowherd and asked, "Can this Daoist compose a poem about him?" The adept smiled and said, "No need for my words—this lad can do it." Thereupon, the boy wrote in large characters:
*Grass spreads o’er the wilds for six or seven li,*
*Flute plays the evening wind with three or four notes.*
*Returning well-fed as dusk descends,*
*Straw cloak unremoved, he treads the bright moon.*

After the adept departed, townspeople saw him outside the city gates, singing loudly beneath two large jars suspended from his eaves. When they rushed forward, he vanished. The jars were merely two openings—could this have been Lü Dongbin?

*The Leisurely Conversations of the Secret Pavilion* records: Zhao Ziran, a Daoist of Phoenix Mountain in Chizhou, dreamed that the Dark True Lord gave him a branch of paulownia leaves to eat. Thereafter, he ceased eating, and his spirit and qi became extraordinary. He composed a poem:
*I once wished to dwell on a mountain isle,*
*Idly sleeping in a jade cavern’s chill.*
*Cinnabar Brother now leads the dance,*
*Coming and going astride a cloudy simurgh.*

When asked the name "Cinnabar Brother," he replied, "It is the crane."

The upright Yundang pitied the tiger; Junping herded geese.

*The Transmission of Daoist Learning* records: Xie Yundang of Liyang saw a starving tiger trapped in a cage. Moved by its plight, he opened the gate and released it. The tiger prostrated itself for a long while before departing.

*The Idle Drumming of Secluded Leisure* states: Goose-Sheep Mountain lies twenty *li* north of Changsha County. Originally called Bundle-Flower Mountain, it is also known as Stone-Treasure Mountain. At its summit stands an immortal’s altar and cinnabar radiance.

*The Miscellaneous Records of Xiangzhong* relates: In former times, a local man named Cheng Junping, at the age of fifteen, was sent by his elder brother to herd geese and sheep. Suddenly, he encountered an immortal elder who led him into this mountain. Later, his brother searched for him and found Junping in the mountains. When asked where the geese and sheep were, Junping pointed to a white stone and said, “This is they.” Then, ashamed, he rose and followed his brother away. Ten days later, he returned to the foot of the mountain and transformed back into stone—a form that remains to this day.

Bi Tian’s poem reads:
*In what year did the feathered guest refine elixirs here?*
*Still lingers the empty radiance, steadfast o’er frail cliffs.*
*In cloudy heights, hawk and hound—surely the immortal has gone far;*
*Below the mountain, geese and sheep—stubborn as stone marrow.*
*How oft has Xiang’s isles shifted with the sea’s vast change?*
*Liaocheng’s walls no longer see Lingwei’s return.*
*In what year shall the immortal’s chariot come again?*
*Then all shall be sent soaring up the Nine Passes.*

Gold seeks Pengzi; needles are entrusted to Granny Tian.

*The Records of Divine Transcendents* states: Tang-period recluse Wang was the fourth nephew of Wang Shan, a constable of Luoyang. When Shan traveled to the capital for his official posting, he crossed the Tianjin Bridge. The fourth nephew, clad in coarse cloth and straw sandals, his appearance rustic and unrefined, was at first unrecognized by Shan. The nephew said, “Uncle, now that you are bound for the selection, your nephew has but a small gift to offer.” He then produced five taels of gold, its hue like a cock’s comb, and said, “Seek out Zhang Pengzi in the gold market to appraise it, and he will give you two hundred thousand cash. I have lately dwelt in the Lesser Existence Grotto of Mount Wangwu, but now I am moving my household to Mount Emei.” When Shan went to inquire, the nephew had already departed. In the gold market, he indeed found Pengzi, who, upon seeing the gold, exclaimed in astonishment and delight, “This is the alchemical gold of Daoist Wang the Fourth Nephew! Its value is not fixed.” Thereupon, he paid Shan the sum as instructed.

*The Tales of the Marvelous* recounts: Xu Bingyan, ascending the perilous plank path of Bashu, suddenly fell with his horse into a cliffside cavern. There he encountered the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One, who said, “The horse you ride is a dragon from my grotto, punished for raging and damaging crops and exiled among men. Yet you, poor as you are, bear the bone of an immortal, and so you have met it. Return and release it by the bend of the Wei River—do not harness it again.”

A jade maiden said, “When the Dragon Son returns, ask County Mistress Tian for needles and send some back with him.” Thereupon, he mounted his horse and flew like the wind, reaching the village of Haoxian in the space of a meal. He inquired and purchased a hundred needles from Mistress Tian, tying them to the horse’s mane before releasing it by the banks of the Wei. Indeed, it transformed into a dragon and departed. Mistress Tian, it is said, was also an immortal.

Xiahou was a master of sleep, while Li He excelled in song.

*The Supplementary Records of Eminent Figures* states: The hermit Xiahou wandered between Mount Mao and Mount Tiantai during the late Dazhong era. He carried only a cloth sack and a bamboo staff, sometimes sleeping in the open beneath altars or among the trees. Those who glimpsed him saw only dense clouds and mist, never his form. Whenever he climbed mountains or crossed rivers, he would close his eyes and fall into a deep sleep. His companions heard his snores, yet his steps never faltered, his feet never stumbled. Upon reaching their destination, he would awaken at once. Thus, he was called the Sleeping Immortal.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: Li He often ingested the qi of the Five Stars and thereby attained the Dao. Skilled in song, whenever he sang, birds and beasts would gather to listen.

Yang Qinzhen was diligent in her practice and harmonized with the numinous through sleep.

*The Biographies of Female Immortals* recounts: Yang Qinzhen was originally a peasant girl who married Wang Wei. Her husband, poor and toiling in the fields, relied on her tireless labor as a wife, earning her the name “Diligent Daughter-in-Law” among his kin. One day, she bathed, donned new clothes, and vanished. That night, neighbors heard celestial music and an extraordinary fragrance wafting from the northwest. The following night, the music and fragrance returned, even more intense. Magistrate Li Deng, hearing of this, led a crowd to investigate and found the woman lying whole upon her bed. When asked about her comings and goings, she replied: “A celestial procession came to welcome me to the Cloud Terrace Peak of Mount Hua, where four female immortals already awaited. We spoke warmly, saying, ‘Born in the same impure world, sharing mortal flesh, how suddenly we have transcended the dust! What night is this, that we gather here in joy? Let each compose a poem to express our feelings.’ Thus, we took turns reciting verses.” Qinzhen’s poem read:

*This human world is but vain turmoil,*
*Our lives fleeting as the ephemeral flower.*
*Who could have known that tonight,*
*I would turn my gaze toward the mist and clouds?*

Later, Qinzhen ascended as an immortal once more.

*The Elegant Talks of the Prefectural Pavilion* states: Wu Heling was a Daoist priest dwelling on Mount Nanyue, commonly called “Wu the Supple.” Fond of sleep, he could go for weeks without eating. He often said, “If one wishes for leisure, one must be soft—movement brings no rest.” Though he had never studied literature, he suddenly composed an *Ascension Song*:

*The Jade Emperor’s music summons the office of immortality,*
*Dragons exhale clouds, phoenixes lend their strength.*
*Before my eyes, pavilions appear in an instant,*
*Strange grasses and wondrous flowers beyond recognition.*
*I gaze upon the world from the Great Veil,*
*The world no larger than a hand’s span.*
*If I had not been hasty in ascending,*
*I would have carried it all to Yingzhou to sell.*

Liu Dun shared the same boat, while Gongchui shared the same bamboo slip.

*The Notable Worthies’ Poetry Talks* records: Jin the Duke once owned a garden outside the Baokang Gate of the capital. Within the garden, the scenery of the Immortal Wandering Grotto was most refined. The Daoist priest Liu Dun composed a poem for the *Immortal Ascension Pavilion* and presented it to the Duke:

*Oft drunk on the Immortal Ascension Pavilion’s height,*
*The Immortal Wandering Grotto lies deep, void of men.*
*One day, when the crane-drawn chariot roams the azure sea,*
*Together we’ll gaze upon Penglai’s isle in spring.*

The Duke did not understand the poem. Later, when he was exiled to the south, Liu Dun came to visit him at the cliffs. The Duke was then pondering the poem’s meaning and realized that Dun was no ordinary man. He invited him to share a boat and drink upon the sea. The Duke said, “Today’s demotion was foretold in your verse.”

*The Continuation of Yuan’s Strange Records* states: The late Huaihai Military Commissioner Li Shen once encountered an old man who asked, “Do you recognize me from your youth?” The man said, “I am Tang Ruoshan. Are you not Li Shen?” Li replied, “My surname is Li, but I am not called Shen.” The old man said, “You should be styled *Gongchui*, for your name is recorded in the immortal register. Tonight, the Perfected of Luofu will hold a gathering. Would you follow me to attend?” He then drew from his sleeve a slip of paper, seemingly formless, and stretched it lengthwise and crosswise until it became several feet long and wide, resembling a boat. The old man and Li boarded it together. He instructed Li to close his eyes. Soon, Li felt the wind and waves surge as if crossing a vast river or sea. In an instant, they arrived at a mountain where pavilions and halls stood in tiers, and the sound of flutes and pipes echoed faintly. Over ten elegant immortals came to welcome them, saying, “Gongchui has indeed come. The mortal world is turbid, and the sea of suffering is deep. Without your name in the immortal register, how could you have found your way here?” They asked, “Can you stay?” Li replied, “I have yet to establish a family and cannot refuse. I fear I would cause my brothers the same worry as Huang Chuping.” They said, “Since you long to return, though the immortal roster lists you as a guest, your worldly ties are still heavy. Yet, high office and a noble name shall be yours. Strive for it.” They then sent him back. Thereafter, Li changed his name to Shen and styled himself *Gongchui*. He indeed passed the imperial examinations, rising to the highest ranks of general and minister.

*Green-browed Lu* and *Blue-eyed Ruan*.
*The Duyang Miscellany* records: In the Yongzhen era of the Tang, Nanhai presented Lu Meiniang, a girl of fourteen. Her brows were green and long, hence her name. From childhood, she was clever and unmatched in skill. She could inscribe the eight scrolls of the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* on a foot of silk, the characters as small as millet grains yet strokes distinct. She was also adept at crafting *flying cloud canopies*—dividing a single skein of silk into three strands, dyeing them five colors, and weaving them into a golden canopy. Within it appeared the images of the Ten Continents, the Three Isles, terraces, halls, qilin, and phoenixes, along with thousands of children holding banners and staffs. Emperor Shunzong, marveling at her craft, called her a divine being and ordained her a Daoist priestess. She returned to Mount Nanyue and was styled *Xiaoyao*. Ruan Ji, styled *Sizong*, served as Commandant of the Northern Army during the Jin. Unrestrained by etiquette, he could make *blue-and-white eyes*. Once, on Mount Sumen, he met Sun Deng and discussed ancient matters, the pivot of spirit, and the circulation of qi. Sun remained silent. Ruan then let out a long whistle and departed. Halfway down the ridge, he heard a sound like the cry of phoenixes resonating through the valleys—it was Sun’s whistle.

*The Silver Cauldron of Zhao Wu* and *The Jade Tablet of Shi Liang*.
*The Records of the Hidden and Subtle* states: Feng Zhaowu was a drunkard from Yuhang. Once, while sailing, a violent storm blew his ship to an island. Suddenly, he caught a whiff of a strange fragrance. In the distance, he saw a Daoist priest sitting on the western shore. Zhaowu hurried over to bow. Beneath a rock sat the Daoist, beside him a silver cauldron with a large pearl floating on its surface. The Daoist asked, “Where have you come from?” Zhaowu replied that he was destitute and wished to go to Silla. The Daoist said, “Your face shows no sign of foreign fortune. Return to your boat, and I shall send a fair wind to carry you back to Mingzhou.” Zhaowu pleaded, “All my life, I have been mired in wine. My diet is meager, and my body is emaciated.” The Daoist laughed and said, “Just drink this broth.” He ladled half a dipper from the cauldron and gave it to him. It was truly the liquid of sweet dew. The Daoist also advised him on the principles of livelihood, saying, “Just trade in horses, and you will be self-sufficient.” Zhaowu asked the Daoist’s name. He replied, “I am the Perfected of Yin.” Suddenly, a wind arose. The Daoist urged him to board a small boat. After drifting for a night, at sunrise, he found himself already in Mingzhou.

*The Tang Anecdotes* records: At the beginning of the Yuanhe era, Ma Shiliang, a petty official of Wannian County, committed an offense. Wang Shuang, the capital prefect, was severe and cruel, and Shiliang fled to Mount Taibai. Reaching the shore of the Tangu Creek, he hid beneath a large willow. At dawn, a five-colored cloud descended from the sky, and an immortal maiden appeared within it. By the water’s edge lay a golden mallet and a jade tablet. She struck it several times, and blue lotuses emerged, each petal unfolding in turn. When they fully opened, the maiden plucked three or four and ate them, then rode the cloud away. Shiliang saw the mallet and tablet still there. He struck them, and after a moment, more lotuses appeared. He ate seven or eight and suddenly felt his body grow light.

*Guo Xian’s Wine-Spitting* and *Ban Meng’s Ink-Swilling*.
*The Collection of the Worthy and the Self* states: In the seventh year of Wude, Guo Xian served as Superintendent of the Imperial Household. He accompanied the emperor to the southern suburban sacrifice. While seated, he suddenly turned to the northeast, took a mouthful of wine, and sighed thrice. The emperor asked the reason. He replied, “The state of Qi is on fire. I did this to suppress it.” Later, it proved true.

*The Three Caverns’ Pearl Bag* states: Ban Meng—some say a woman—could fly for an entire day. She could also sit in empty space and speak with people, or enter the earth and vanish. At first, she would sink to her feet, then her chest, until only her headwear remained visible, and after a while, she would disappear entirely. She could hold ink in her mouth, spread paper before her, chew the ink, and spit it out to form characters, filling the page with meaningful text. After ingesting cinnabar, she grew younger at four hundred years of age and entered Mount Daye.

*Daorong’s Tiger Trench* and *Dragon Might’s Crow Traces*.

*The Record of Responses* recounts: In the Northern Qi dynasty, Youwu Daorong, in his youth, became a Daoist. He encountered an immortal from Mount Nanyue, who taught him talismanic water, incantations, yin-yang calculations, astronomy, and the properties of medicinal herbs—all of which he mastered. Once in Liaoyang, a tiger approached within ten paces of his horse. While others fled in terror, Daorong calmly drew his staff across the ground, forming a deep trench, and the tiger fled at once.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Immortals* tells of the Dragon Might Elder, a nameless recluse on Mount Bao. In the twelfth year of King Helü of Wu, as the king led his troops past the mountain to observe the enemy state, he noticed a cave and wished to know its depth. He asked the recluse to explore it fully. Holding a torch, the elder traveled day and night for one hundred seventy-four days before returning. He described a golden city with jade towers, radiant as daylight, its windows and doors inlaid with flowing purple jade and yellow gold. Above the city gate hung a plaque reading *Detached Palace of the Queen of Heaven*. Within the resplendent halls, he found a scroll of plain silk inscribed with crow-traced seal script. Upon his return, he presented the text to the king, who later sent envoys to show it to Confucius, saying: “Our lord once traveled to Mount Bao, where a red crow delivered this book before his chariot. We now present this sacred text to you, wishing to know its fortune or misfortune.” Confucius opened the case and exclaimed: “When Yu the Great completed his flood-control works, he wandered to the slopes of Mount Zhong, where he received the *Supreme Numinous Treasure True Scripture* bestowed by the Yellow Emperor and Emperor Yan. One copy was hidden in a stone chamber within a famous mountain, and another was entrusted to the water spirit. A perfected one was destined to present it to a king. But as for a red crow delivering it—I have never heard of such a thing.”

*Zhong Yue’s Pine Bow*, *Yaoguang’s Reed-Burning*.

From *Accounts of Illustrious Worthies*:

The Daoist Wu Chongyue practiced grain avoidance. Once, he climbed to the top of a pine tree to bow in homage to Zhou Wei, the Fiscal Commissioner of Fujian. Zhou invited him to join his retinue, and they traveled together to Dehua County. East of the county stood an ancient pine, eighty or ninety feet tall, upon which perched a crane’s nest. Zhou commanded Wu to ascend. Like a gibbon, Wu climbed with ease, rising straight up until he emerged beyond the nest. There, he stood upright, pacing with flying steps, his hands grasping nothing, bowing upon the slender branches as if on level ground. The pine’s branches, supple and yielding, rose and fell with his steps, yet remained unharmed. Zhou presented him with a poem:

*With a hat of paper mulberry bark and robes of cloth,*
*You’ve swallowed the cinnabar clouds—your life shall be long.*
*Amid the worldly, your spirit delights in the Dao,*
*Transcending the dust, your bearing forsook grain long ago.*
*Who passed you the wondrous scriptures within your pillow?*
*You’ve newly transcribed the remedies behind your elbow.*
*Atop the hundred-foot pine, how many flying steps?*
*Where cranes nest on the branches, you bow to the August Sovereign.*

From *Records of Karmic Responses*:

Wu Yaoguang was skilled in fire manipulation. The King of Wu amassed thousands of bundles of reeds, had Yaoguang sit upon them, then wrapped him in thousands more. A fierce wind suddenly arose, and the reeds were set ablaze. When the flames subsided, all assumed Yaoguang had been reduced to ashes. Yet there he sat, unscathed amid the embers, rising to shake off his robes. He obtained a sacred talisman, and his name was inscribed in the immortal register of Lord Bo Wei.

From *Supplement to the Biographies of Transcendents*:

One Shi Deyi recounted: During the Xiantong era, autumn rains persisted for ten days, and mountain torrents overflowed. One morning, as the skies cleared, he saw an object drifting sideways in the river. Using his staff, he drew it ashore and opened it to find the *Three Section Talismans of Lord Lao*. Though it had floated in the water, it was not wet. Marveling at this, he took it home. That night, a radiant light appeared, and two youths seemed to follow him. They spoke: “We are the Talisman Attendants. The Supreme Treasure Talismans have long circulated among mortals, but errors in transcription have distorted their essence. With the text corrupted, ghosts and spirits no longer heed them, and their efficacy has waned. Now, this correct version is entrusted to a child of the Dao, to relieve the people’s suffering—none shall fail to see its power.” Years later, the youths announced that Lord Lao would descend upon Mount Taibai. Shi went to pay homage and never returned.

*The True Records* states: In his youth, Zhao Bowen studied the Dao under Master Deng Ye of Zhang, and in later years at Mount Song, he transmitted the *Scripture of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants* to Yuanqiu Linzi. Now, he too has attained the Dao, entering the Huayang Grotto-Heaven to oversee the celestial registers and record the names of seekers.

Han boys drew lines in the earth; Qin women built walls.

*The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* recounts: In the early Han, four or five boys were playing by drawing lines on the road. One sang:
*"Don the azure skirt, enter the Gate of Heaven,
Bow to the Golden Mother, pay homage to the Wooden Duke."*
No one understood, save Zhang Zifang, who went and bowed twice—these were the jade lads of the Eastern King.

The so-called Golden Mother is the Queen Mother of the West; the Wooden Duke, the King Father of the East. Immortals bow to the King Father and salute the Queen Mother.

*The Extensive Records* notes: During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the Prefect of Daizhou, fearing that the many wandering monks on Mount Wutai might give rise to heretical affairs, expelled all who were not resident clergy. The displaced monks fled into the mountains. One, named Faming, ventured deep into the secluded ravines of Mameng Mountain, where a stone cave allowed passage. Crossing the stream and scaling the bank, he walked two *li* to a thatched hut. Within, a woman clad in woven grass, her countenance refined and lovely, stared in astonishment and asked: "What manner of being are you?" The monk replied, "I am human." The woman laughed: "Could a human truly bear such a form?"

The monk replied, "I am a disciple of the Buddha, and thus shave my head and beard as the Buddha requires." The monk then asked where this place was. The woman said, "I am from Qin. I followed Meng Tian to build the Great Wall, but the toil was unbearable, so I fled here. By eating grass roots, I have managed not to die." The monk took his leave and departed. Later, he prepared provisions and returned, but lost his way and could not find the place again.

Bo Yong’s cranes cried out; Cang Zhi’s roosters crowed.

*The Imperial Anthology* records: Minister Wang Boyong fell ill and grew feeble. That evening, over ten ethereal cranes soared in the sky, their calls ringing clear. On the twentieth night of the eighth month, the moon shone brightly. At the time, his younger brother, Chuncheng, had been assigned to govern Bozhou, and the household staff came to receive him, all finding the event strange and astonishing. Soon after, the minister passed away, and the cranes dispersed. People of the time believed Boyong was destined to become an immortal official.

*The Lives of Eminent Daoists* states: Daoist Ye Cangzhi, styled Hanxiang, was skilled in talismanic protection. The prefect of Bozhou was plagued by an evil entity and came to request a talisman. Midway through the journey, he encountered defilement and suddenly lost it.

The prefect personally visited, seeing a bamboo tube on the table, its seal tightly affixed—it was the talisman he had earlier requested. Thereupon, he burned incense, reverently received the case, and took it home. The malevolent entity was thus eradicated. The prefect memorialized Ye’s virtue, and Emperor Yizong issued an imperial decree bestowing upon him the Jade Cloud Abbey at Mount Shimen.

One day, Ye prepared wine and summoned his friends, recounting the events of his life before announcing his departure date. When the appointed day arrived, he secretly inscribed upon his door: *"At cock’s crow, I depart."* His disciples then heard the mingled sounds of jade pendants and flutes in the air. In an instant, as the cock crowed, they looked and found he had already transformed. He was seventy-four years old.

*The Comprehensive Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns*, Scroll Nineteen, concludes.

The Orthodox Unity Daoist Chen Baoguang compiled and edited.

The Elder of Green Mound, a minor star of the Purple Tenuity.

*The Records of Extraordinary Persons* states: The Daoist Wang Yuanzhi of Taizhou was skilled in the *Book of Changes* and could foretell life, death, fortune, and misfortune. He composed *The Essentials of the Changes* in fifteen scrolls. One day, amid thunder, rain, and mist, an old man shouted: *"Where is the book you have leaked? The Supreme Emperor has commanded me to seize the Six Ding thunder spirits to retrieve it."* Terrified, Yuanzhi prostrated himself upon the ground, where six attendants in black robes already bore the book forward. The old man rebuked him: *"The forbidden texts of the Upper Realm are guarded by flying celestial protectors, secreted within the Primordial Capital. Who are you to conceal such trifling teachings?"* Yuanzhi replied: *"The Elder of Green Mound transmitted them to me."* The old man said: *"The Supreme Emperor has descended. Your immortal rank is now attained; the date of your transcendence is deferred by four years and two cycles."* Later, the master underwent liberation by means of the corpse in the Hall of Illuminated Residence.

*The Rustic Records of Xiangzhong* states: During the time when the Great Ancestor (Taizu) was still in obscurity, he and Zhao, the Prince of Han, encountered Chen Xiyi while strolling through the markets of Chang’an. Xiyi said: *"Might we share a drink?"* The Great Ancestor replied: *"Certainly."* He went with Zhao the Learned Scholar, whereupon Xiyi glanced at the Prince of Han and said: *"He will do, he will do."* Upon entering the tavern, the Prince of Han, whose foot was numb, happened to sit at the left of the seat. Chen grew angry and said: *"A mere minor star of the Purple Enclosure, how dare you occupy the higher place?"* He rebuked him and made him move to the right. Li Yu commented on the *Analects*, while Gu Huan expounded the *Classic of Filial Piety*.

*The Unofficial Histories* records: The Vice Director of the Bureau of Merit Titles, Li Yu of Xinzhou, was traveling to Mount Hua with Yang Leng when they suddenly came upon a small grotto. The streams, cliffs, grasses, and trees within seemed unlike the mortal realm. A man in purple robes invited them inside to his dwelling, which resembled an official residence, with many bamboo houses. The halls and chambers were exceedingly clean. He introduced himself as Du Zihua, explaining that he had withdrawn from the world to pursue the Daoist arts and had lived there for several hundred years. He offered them lodging, and the food and drink were both refined and abundant. The meat was from a "galloping sheep," whose form resembled an ox. There were also copies of the *Analects* in his collection. After lingering for several days, he presented each of them with several silver vessels and sent an attendant to guide them back, asking, "Would you care to stay?" The two men hesitated. Zihua laughed, clasped their hands in farewell, and parted. Later, when they searched for the grotto, it was nowhere to be found.

*The Biographies of Daoist Scholars* states: Gu Huan of the Song was skilled in Daoist teachings. His disciple Bao Yunshou had a tree before his gate, over ten spans in girth, upon which dwelled a spirit. Huan sealed the tree with a talisman, and it immediately withered and died. Another man afflicted by malevolent spirits sought Huan’s help. Huan asked, "What books do you have at home?" The man replied, "Only the *Classic of Filial Piety*." Huan said, "Take the passage *Confucius at Rest* and place it by the sick man’s pillow with reverence. He will recover." The afflicted man did so and was indeed cured.

Wang Yuan inscribed verses upon a gate; Yin Rong concealed himself while dredging a well.

*The Biographies of Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* records: Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, was well-versed in celestial patterns and divination, foretelling good and ill fortune. Emperor Wu of Han inquired of him regarding omens, but he did not answer. Instead, he inscribed over four hundred characters upon the palace gate, foretelling future events. The emperor, displeased, ordered the words scraped away. Though the outer characters were erased, the inner ones reappeared, the ink penetrating deep into the wood.

*The Extensive Records* states: In Zhushan County of Fangzhou, a man named Yin Rong was dredging a well at his home. Though they dug over a thousand feet, no water was found. The laborers, feeling along the walls, suddenly beheld another sky and earth, a world with sun and moon, marked by a placard reading *Mount Heavenly Pillar*. Within the gate, two youths with bright teeth and elaborate headdresses asked, "Why have you come here?" The laborers recounted the entire affair.

A certain text titled *Paoyi’s Transmission of Robberies* states: "Send them off with propriety." They led the laborers to a clear spring to bathe, and rinsed their mouths with white springwater—sweet and fragrant as wine. After half a day’s journey, they beheld palaces all of gold and jade, inscribed with the words *Ladder-to-Immortal Land*. The laborers asked, "What is this country?" They were told, "All immortals newly attained are sent through this checkpoint to this land for cultivation."

Wang Jiao split his skull; Yang the Elder struck his crown.
*The Youyang Miscellany* records: Master Wang Xia was skilled in divination. During the Tianbao era, he once sat in the open air with guests at night, pointing to the stars and moon and saying, "The times are about to change." This was reported by a neighbor, and the emperor, then in his declining years, had him beaten on the head dozens of times before he died. When his skull was split open, the bone was found to be one *cun* and eight *fen* thick. Xia had previously associated with Minister Daxi, and after the An Lushan rebellion was pacified, Jiao, staff in hand and sandals on his feet, visited Daxi’s home—only then was he recognized as an extraordinary man.

*The Beimeng Suoyan* states: In Zichuan of Qi Prefecture, there was a Daoist named Yang the Immortal, whose age no one knew; elders from their youth had seen him. Whenever he walked through the lanes, children would gather to watch. Sometimes he would borrow an iron hammer from a blacksmith’s shop and strike his own crown, or have others strike it with all their might—yet he suffered no harm, saying only that it felt most pleasant. He would enter the mountains to play with tigers and leopards, striking them with his hand so that the fierce beasts would fall prostrate. He often urged people to practice hidden virtue.

During the Changxing era, he entered Shu and resided on Mount Emei before departing.

Xi Jia fled into reclusion; Wang Zhongfu absorbed the radiance.
*The Unofficial History of Jin* records: Xi Jia, styled Kongbin, was twenty years of age and fond of studying the classics and histories. One quiet night, he suddenly heard a voice at the window call out: "Xi Kongbin, come away! To adorn the affairs of the human world is bitter and cannot be harmonized. What you gain is not even a hair’s weight, while what you lose is already a mountain’s mass." Jia thereupon fled into reclusion, traveling west to the isles of the sea, where he taught over three thousand disciples.

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan* states: Wang Zhongfu, from his youth, loved the Dao and the arts of nourishing life. He practiced the method of absorbing radiance and nurturing mist for over forty years. One evening, he dreamed that a divine person told him, "The reason you have not yet ascended is that your brain palace is deficient and your numinous essence has not yet overflowed." Thereupon, he was taught the method of ingesting and consuming, and only then was he able to ascend. He now resides on the Dark Continent.

Cheng the Master carried his sack; Yi Yin bore the cauldron.
*The Biographies of Eminent Daoists* records: Master Cheng’s origins were unknown. When Emperor Ming heard of his name, he summoned him to the palace and lodged him in the Penglai Court to inquire about the arts he cultivated, but Cheng did not answer. Soon after, he begged to return to the mountains, and the emperor assented. He departed carrying a cloth sack, and people all laughed at him. Later, when the curtains were drawn back, a poem was found inscribed on the wall:

*Westward the road to Shu,
Northward the Yan army comes.
I had hoped to ascend in broad daylight,
But first, the Black Dragon drinks the Wei.*

The characters, though scraped and washed, grew ever clearer. Within a few months, An Lushan rebelled, and the emperor fled to Shu.

*The Supplement to the Biographies of Transcendents* records: Yi Yin was a man of Shang. His ancestors had served the Xia as feudal lords. When his mother was with child, she was strolling by the western river when a great flood suddenly surged forth. Startled, she fled to escape the waters, then stood with arms clasped and transformed into a withered mulberry. When the flood receded, her husband came to search for her, assuming she had drowned. Suddenly, he saw the withered mulberry—a tree not there before—and suspected it was his wife transformed. He struck it with a stone, and from within the hollow mulberry came the sound of an infant. He took the child and raised him, thus naming him Yi.

As Yi Yin grew, he mastered the celestial stems and earthly branches, the harmonics of sound and the principles of yin and yang, delving into the profound and scrutinizing the subtle, his resolve set on saving the world. He bore the cauldron to petition Tang, who rejoiced greatly and appointed him as minister. At eighty, he relinquished his position, ceased eating, and feigned death at home. The Supreme Lord commanded the Perfected One of Grand Harmony, Meng Guxi, to transmit to him the method of liberating the form. He entered the stone chamber of Mount Meng Qin to cultivate it and ascended in broad daylight.

*Yuan Da dreamed of a crow; Wenzi struck the molted husk.*
*The Pearl Satchel of the Three Caverns* states: Deng Yuzi, styled Yuan Da, was a native of Xinye in Nanyang. Once, he dreamed of a crow that spat out a seal and gave it to him. Thereafter, whenever the people suffered illness, he would heal them with the seal, inscribing talismans that cured the afflicted.

The *Commentary on the Han Sacrificial Canon* in the *Biographies of Transcendents* records: Cui Wenzi studied transcendence under Wang Ziqiao. Ziqiao transformed into a white cicada husk, and Wenzi, startled, struck it with a halberd. Looking down, he saw the corpse of Wang Ziqiao. In an instant, it transformed into a great crow and flew away.

*Jade Orchid harmonized her belly; the Supreme Transcendent shed her skin.*
*The Collected Biographies of Transcendents* states: Zhang Yulan was the granddaughter of the Celestial Master. From childhood, she abstained from meat. At seventeen, she dreamed of a crimson light descending from the heavens, within which golden characters in seal script followed the light into her mouth, and she conceived. Her mother reproached her, but she never spoke of the dream, confiding only in her handmaiden. One day, she declared, "I cannot bear the shame of living. After my death, cut open my belly to prove my innocence."

That very night, she died without illness. Something like a lotus emerged from her belly, and upon inspection, it was revealed to be ten scrolls of the *Sutra of the Fundamental Principle*, written in gold on plain silk, which circulated among the people. When they buried Yulan, a great wind and rain arose, and her coffin flew onto a tree. The sutra and Yulan herself vanished. Her tomb remains in the Abbey of the Maiden in Wenjiang County, Yizhou.

Furthermore, Dong Shangxian was a girl from Fangyi in Suizhou. At seventeen, her divine bearing was elegant and refined, earning her the name "Supreme Transcendent." One day, purple clouds draped the sky, and celestial music descended into her courtyard. Two azure lads led her to ascend to heaven. Her parents, simple and unenlightened, wailed and called for her without cease.

She ascended some ten yards from the ground before descending to return home, where she stayed for several months, only to repeat the ascent. Later, she shed her skin upon the earth—her garments and form remained intact—and flew away.

Du Qiong composed a rhapsody, and Xu Jian wrote poetry.

*The True Diagnosis* states: On Mount Dengdu, the forests, waters, and marshes resemble those of the mortal world, yet the grains of rice are nearly as large as beans, their taste like mugwort. Of the five grains, only rice is of weighty significance.

Du Qiong’s *Rhapsody on the Weighty Grain* reads:
*"In spring’s lush haze, the verdant weighty grain,
The numinous qi intermingles, and fine crops answer the season.
The four rites fulfilled, the people offer sacrifice.
The divine rice flourishes in vast fields,
Its mighty ears swaying o’er my primal terrace.
Lo, a bright omen—
The Son of Heaven thus prospers.
This is what it means."*

*Miscellaneous Records in Refined Speech* states: Xu Jian, a man of Jiangzuo, often dwelled on the Three Maos Mountains. His age was unknown, his appearance unchanged, and he spoke often of immortals and transcendents. He composed poetry, such as *Inscribed at the Maoshan Abbey*:
*"Ever resentful the pure winds stagnant for a thousand years,
Yet today the grotto-heaven grants free roaming.
The pines’ ancient hues quiet the jade altar,
Phoenix and crane come not—the Azure Lord stands aloof.
The Maos’ well runs cold, the cinnabar already transformed,
The Ming Emperor’s stele broken, dreams still toil.
Clearly there is a path to long life—
Cease sighing o’er graying temples in the red dust."*

Another quatrain, sent to Xu Xuan of Hehe:
*"For days, mist and moon have sealed the towers,
Wishing to present my talents to the noble gate.
My face covered in celestial dust, none recognize me—
Had I followed the flowing waters out of the mountains?"*

Qiu Bo appraised cranes, while Tong Jun pulverized stone hens.

*The Classic of Crane Appraisal* states: Fu Qiu Bo once received it from Prince Wang Zijin. Later, Cui Wenzi studied the Dao under Zijin, obtained the text, and concealed it in a stone chamber on Mount Song. The Duke of Huainan, seeking herbs, found it and thus transmitted it to the world. The classic says: *"The crane is a yang bird, born of the qi of metal and fire. At three years, its crown reddens; at seven, it masters flight; after another seven, it crows at all twelve hours. At sixty, downy feathers grow, and mud cannot soil it. At one hundred sixty, male and female gaze at each other to conceive; at one thousand six hundred, it bears young without eating, gestating within. Its appraisal: a long neck and refined sinews make for fine song; a tortoise-shell back and black-bellied frame enable dance—such is the transcendent’s steed."*

*The Record of Extraordinary Events* states: In the third year of Jian’an, the kingdom of Rongtu presented a silent stone hen, its color like cinnabar, the size of a swallow. It often remained on the ground, crowing in season, its voice carrying far through the land. Upon hearing it, the people would slaughter livestock in sacrifice. Where the sound issued, they would dig and find the hen. If the realm knew great peace, it would soar and flap its jowls as an auspicious sign, also called the "treasure hen." Some listened to the earth to mark the hours. Daoists say: *"The transcendent Tong Jun delved into a cave for miles, obtaining a cinnabar stone hawk. Pounded into medicine and consumed, it granted one a voice and breath, delaying death beyond heaven’s decree."* In the first year of Baoding, the four directions offered rare treasures, including amber. Swallows placed in a quiet chamber would sing and flutter—such was its kind.

The External Official and the Filthy Man; the Farmland Soldier and the Conscript.

*The Unofficial History* states: During the Dali era of the Tang, a certain Gentleman Wang, an External Official, was devoted to the Dao. Though he held court rank, he daily wore plain robes and associated with mountain recluses. One day, while performing a purification rite, he spoke with an old man named Pei. Gentleman Wang found him extraordinary. His wife scolded him, saying: *"You are a court official, yet you befriend a filthy man!"* She sent someone to drive him away. A day later, the man returned, clutching a cloth bundle and leaning on a staff, exuding the air of a hermit. He said: *"The External Official does not truly love the Dao—he merely covets elixirs."* He then took a small iron box from Gentleman Wang, weighing about two pounds, unwrapped a tiny packet containing two sesame-seed-like pills, scattered them atop the box, and piled fire to burn it. After the time it takes to eat a meal, he retrieved it—now transformed into superior gold, its hue like a rooster’s comb. Gentleman Wang gasped in astonishment. The man departed, and his whereabouts thereafter were unknown.

*The Comprehensive Record of Marvels* states: Zeng Gongfengxian, a Farmland Gentleman of the Ministry of Works, governed Huizhou during the Jiayou era. His residence had a vegetable garden, tended by an old conscript who watered and weeded with great diligence. Whatever Zeng desired, the old man secretly provided in advance. Zeng asked: *"How do you always anticipate my wishes?"* The conscript replied: *"It is mere coincidence."* Thereafter, Zeng treated him well. One day, the conscript said to Zeng: *"I am grateful for Your Lordship’s kindness. I am no ordinary man. Tonight at the third watch, I humbly request your presence in the garden—there is a secret matter to report."* Zeng readily agreed, preparing his official robes to visit him. His family protested: *"How could a prefect don his court robes to meet an old conscript in the dead of night?"* He relented. At dawn, word came that the gardener had died, and several taels of silver were found at his waist. Zeng purchased a coffin and buried him in the wilds. Months later, a man arrived from Guangzhou, bearing a letter from the conscript in thanks. When they opened his tomb, only his cloth bundle, headscarf, and sandals remained.

The Pine-Eating Maiden Mao; the Orange-Gathering Lady He.

*The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states: The Maiden Mao, styled Zhengmei, dwelled in seclusion on Mount Hua. Her body grew hair, and she claimed to have been a palace woman during the Qin. Later, she fled into the mountains, where a Daoist taught her to eat pine needles, thus freeing her from hunger and cold. Her body became light as flight. Chen Tuan often roamed Mount Hua with her, and woodcutters frequently saw her. He gifted her a poem:
*"The medicinal sprouts do not fill the basket,
Yet again I ascend the perilous peak.
Turning my head toward the path home,
Together we enter the emerald mist."*

Another verse:
*"Once I broke pine branches to fashion a fine comb,
Wove chestnut leaves to replace silk robes.
Sometimes, when asked of Qin palace affairs,
She laughs, plucks a transcendent flower, and gazes into the great void."*

*The Continued Biographies of Transcendents* states: He A-liu was a woman of Xuzhou who, at the Cloud Terrace Abbey in Huayin, gathered firewood and drew water for the female Daoist masters for several years. The Daoist women spoke of the sweet oranges and fine fruits of Jiangwu, which were difficult to obtain in the Qin region. A-liu smiled and said: *"This is not hard to procure—such things exist nearby."*

She finished speaking and went out the door. After the time it takes to eat a meal, she returned with five or six sweet oranges tucked in her sleeve and gave them to the Daoist women, saying: *"The Guangxun mandarins are especially fine."* She then produced over ten more, which they divided and ate.

Three years later, a Master Cui, a Daoist adept from Mount Luofu, traveled to Huayin. In conversation, she mentioned that the previous year in the official gardens of Guangzhou, a woman had been caught stealing mandarins—yet when seized, she suddenly vanished. Only then did the others realize that A-liu was no ordinary person.

**Yuan Fang begged for his bones; Dou Zhi concealed them.**

*The New Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, had mastered the arts of the Nine Elixirs and their transformations. When Cao Cao sought his teachings, Zuo refused. Enraged, Cao intended to kill him, but Zuo begged only for his bones. Cao prepared wine for him, and Zuo said: *"Today I must journey far. I beg to divide this cup of wine with you."* Cao agreed. Zuo drew his hairpin and traced a line through the wine, splitting it in two. He drank half and offered the other half to Cao, who, displeased, did not drink at once. Zuo then begged to finish the cup himself. After drinking, he hurled the vessel at the roof beams, where it trembled like a flying bird. As all eyes turned upward, Zuo had already vanished.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: The Lady Mao said: *"The female immortal Dou Qiongying’s seventh-generation ancestor, Dou Zhi, made it his practice to conceal dry bones and revive the dead. His hidden virtue extended to Qiongying’s own person, enabling her to ascend to the Hua Yang Grotto-Heaven."*

**The Ghost Mound of Song River; the Immortal Caverns of Mount Heng.**

*The Talismanic Records of the Heavenly Master* states: East of Yichang lies the county of Jiachuan. Twenty *li* northeast of it flows the Song River, where a cluster of rocks in midstream is called the Heavenly Master’s Ghost Mound. Beside the river, a massive boulder bears raised characters known as the Heavenly Master’s Talisman—sharp as if carved, bold as if inscribed, resembling both seal script and clerical script, yet majestic and forceful, like an armored warrior standing with sword in hand. When evil spirits behold it, who does not tremble in terror? Scholars print it with ink on paper, and it serves to repel malevolent forces.

In the second month of the seventh year of the Yuanhe era, An Xing, having resigned from office, traveled south and passed through Yichang. Zhang Dangshi, a man of Huayin then serving as magistrate of Miangu County, presented him with a Heavenly Master’s Talisman, saying: *"This cannot be obtained outside my homeland."* An placed the talisman in his document case and returned home. Half a year later, he opened the case to find that mice had shredded all his books—yet the talisman remained untouched, not a hair’s breadth damaged. Ah, how wondrous!

Li Anxing, magistrate of Fufeng County in Fengxiang Prefecture under the Xuande administration, recorded these events.

**The Traditions of Divine Transcendents (Wangshi Shenxian Zhuan):**
Wang Daochang, of unknown origin, dwelt in Yangmo Township, Lijing Valley County. Twenty li west of the county seat, one crosses the Jialing River and ascends the Anle Gorge to reach the foot of his mountain. Its peaks rise sheer and towering; east of the gorge lies the Immortal’s Cavern, where he cultivated the Dao. His entire household attained transcendence. The foundations of his dwelling and the remnants of his rice mortar remain to this day.

**Yin Jun drinks aconite; Du Wu vomits cinnabar.**
*Supplement to the Traditions of Divine Transcendents (Xianzhuan Shiyi):*
Yin Jun, of unknown origin, once secluded himself on Mount Jin, abstaining from the five grains. At the time, Minister Li Shuo governed the northern frontier, with Feng Lan and Yan Shou serving as his aides. Yan, who cherished the strange and revered divine transcendents, invited Yin Jun to his official residence, where they shared the same mat daily. A rare fragrance often emanated from Yin’s flesh, deepening Yan’s veneration. Yan had a younger sister who had become a nun; displeased with her brother’s association with Yin Jun, she secretly mixed aconite into his wine. After drinking, Yin suddenly exclaimed, *"This wine is not fine!"* Moments later, he vomited an object—hard and fragrant. Yan split it open to find a true musk gland. That very night, Yin Jun perished, and Yan mourned him deeply. The following autumn, a certain Zhu Taixu encountered Yin Jun on Mount Jin, who said: *"Recently, at the northern frontier, I was poisoned with aconite wine and feigned death. Yet how could such poison corrupt my true essence?"* Astonished, Zhu returned and recounted this to Lord Yan, who declared: *"I knew at once that he had achieved liberation through apparent death."*

*Records of the Uncanny (Yuan Guai Lu):*
In his youth, before attaining prominence, Minister Du Wu once met a Daoist on Mount Changbai who bestowed upon him a pellet of cinnabar. After ingesting it, Du lost all desire for food; his complexion grew radiant, his body light and free of illness. Later, when he became Prefect of Shangzhou, he realized that as a high-ranking official, his abstinence from food might alarm others. Thus, he sought to expel the cinnabar. Over a year later, a Daoist arrived and instructed him to consume animal flesh and blood. Du complied, and soon after, he vomited up the cinnabar.

**The Pei family’s boulder; the Wei elder’s ancient altar.**
*Extensive Records (Guang Ji):*
A son of the Pei family served his parents with filial devotion and, though poor, was ever eager to aid others. One day while traveling, he encountered an old man who led him into Mount Taibai. There, they came upon a massive boulder. The elder struck it with his staff, and the stone parted, revealing a cavern. Inside, myriad wonders unfolded—jade maidens and immortal youths. The old man then guided Pei out and told him: *"Twenty years hence, return here to escape the world."* When the appointed time arrived, the An Lushan rebellion erupted, and the entire Pei clan took refuge in the Western Kunlun Mountains, thus escaping harm.

*Collection of Marvels (Yiwen Ji):*
During the reign of Emperor Daizong, Attendant Censor Wei was dispatched on a mission to Mount Hua to pay homage at the Yellow Emperor’s Altar. Upon reaching the lodgings at the mountain’s base, he encountered an old man and inquired about the altar’s location. The elder replied: *"On the southwestern slope of the Lotus Peak stands an ancient altar, its overgrown remnants still visible—this must be it."* When asked his surname, the old man answered, *"Wei."* He then recounted his lineage, revealing himself as the censor’s great-great-grandfather. Together, they entered the mountain. The elder, leaning on his staff, strode ahead, while Wei, spurring his horse, could not keep pace. Upon reaching a stone chamber, they found two old women, who declared: *"We are your great-grandmother and great-aunt."* Both had transformed, clad in garments of woven leaves, and rejoiced: *"After generations of change, we meet our descendant today!"* Soon after, they accompanied the old man up the mountain to pay homage at the altar, then took their leave. When Wei later sought the place again, he could not find the path. Locals said: *"This elder appears once every two or three years, though none know his whereabouts."*

**Ziyu’s white hair; Changrong’s rosy complexion.**
*Continuation of the Traditions of Divine Transcendents (Xu Xian Zhuan):*
Su Ziyu was precocious and wise in his youth, well-versed in the classics. Upon reading of the Yellow Emperor’s mining of copper from Mount Shou to cast tripods and refine the elixir that enabled his ascension, he set down the scroll and sighed: *"The books of the former scholars, the essence of the Five Constants, constrained by rites and music, bound by names and teachings—how fleeting! In an instant, one’s hair turns white, the body perishes, and what use is an empty name?"* Thereafter, he embraced the radiance of the celestial ford, merging with true quiescence, inhaling and exhaling the qi of the Dao to attain harmony. Later, he encountered the Orthodox Unity Perfected One, who transmitted to him the *Crimson Script of Jade Characters, Supreme Secret of the Celestial Perfected*. Through diligent practice and devotion, he attained communion with the divine and suddenly ascended in broad daylight.

*Extensive Records (Guang Ji):*
Changrong entered Mount Da to cultivate the Dao, styling herself Changrongzi. Though over two hundred years old, her complexion remained as rosy as that of a twenty-year-old. Another account claims she was the daughter of a Shang king who consumed the roots of *penglei* (a kind of knotweed), traveling between heaven and earth, seen by mortals across generations.

**Tongyuan gazes toward the palace; Xu returns to the mountain.**
*Brush Strokes of the Ink Guest (Moke Hui Xi):*
During the Zhenzong era, a Daoist named Zi Tongyuan resided at the Chengtian Abbey in Shanzhou. Over a hundred years old, he withstood heat and cold, drank wine daily, and often went without food. When the emperor performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices, Tongyuan followed the procession from Mount Luo to the Taiyi Grotto. One day, nearing the end of his life, he summoned officials and commoners alike to expound on the essentials of life and death. At midnight, he bathed and purified himself, then faced the palace and departed. His body was as light as a cicada’s sloughed husk.

*Jottings from Chouchi (Chouchi Biji):*
Xu Ze of Donghai secluded himself on Mount Tiantai, fasting to nurture his nature. The Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate, Xu Jun, descended and said: *"At eighty, you shall become the teacher of a king, and only then will you attain the Dao."* When Emperor Yang of the Sui heard of his reputation and summoned him, Xu remarked: *"I am now eighty-three. The summons has come—Xu Jun’s words are proven true."* He then journeyed to Yangzhou. The emperor requested instruction in the Dao, but Xu declined, citing inauspicious timing.

A few days later, he died, yet travelers along the roads all saw him walking back to the mountains, saying he had been released to return. He then distributed scriptures among his disciples and departed.

Left Chou carved an image to venerate, while Gao Yuan took leave of the emperor with lofty words.

*Supplementary Accounts of Immortals (Xianzhuan Shiyi):*
Left Chou was a minister of the Yellow Emperor. When the Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven, Chou carved a wooden likeness of him and led the feudal lords in paying homage. After seven years, the Yellow Emperor did not return. During the reign of Emperor Zhuan, Chou also ascended as an immortal and departed. It is said that the practice of carving wooden images began with him.

*Supplementary Accounts of Immortals (Xianzhuan Shiyi):*
Pu Gaoyuan, a native of Baxi, was a disciple of Master Wang Pu of the Yellow Register. His words were strange and his conduct unpredictable, so all called him mad. On the sixteenth day of the seventh month in the twelfth year of the Datong era, he rode the clouds from the summit of South Peak straight to Jinling to take leave of the emperor. Emperor Wu of Liang was seated in audience when Pu suddenly appeared in his hall. The emperor asked his purpose, and Pu replied: *"I dwelt in Baxi, attained the Dao of the Supreme Clarity, and am now returning to heaven—I have come only to bid you farewell."* With that, he flew away. At the time, Wang Xiaoji, the governor of Yizhou, reported the matter to the throne. The emperor also issued an edict inquiring into it and ordered the gentleman of the palace, Liu Xiaoxian, to compose a stele commemorating his deeds, which still exists today.

Han Yong hobbled with a staff, while Zi Zhen rode a steed.

From *Records of Marvels Gathered*: Gu Chengzhi traveled from Guang to Xiangtan when he heard of a lofty figure named Han Yong and went to pay his respects. At their first meeting, Han treated him like an old friend and said: *"You bear the qi of the Dao—might you abandon this journey?"* Gu declined, citing his pursuit of official rank. Han replied: *"This journey of yours will bring success in the examinations. One day, we shall meet again outside Banhe Gate in the capital."* With that, they parted.

The following spring, Chengzhi indeed passed the imperial exams. One day, while strolling outside Banhe Gate, he saw a man hobbling with a staff—it was Han. Remembering their earlier agreement, Chengzhi was astonished and treated him to wine at a tavern. Han then presented a poem:

*"Virtue and learning already set you apart,
The Way of immortality I now entrust to you.
If fleeting fame is truly not your aim,
Claim for yourself a wisp of cloud in leisure’s embrace."*

They parted once more, and from then on, no word of Han was ever heard again. Later, Gu ceased eating and also displayed many strange and wondrous traits.

*The Accounts of Eminent Daoists*: Master Pan Shizheng was most filial in serving his mother. When she passed, he built a hut beside her grave. The Daoist Liu Aidao saw this and marveled, saying: *"The steed of the Three Clarities—who but you shall ride it?"* He wore a jade crown of *jingdu*, wrapped in a purple-and-gold brocade robe.

*The Divine Immortals of the Wang Clan*: Lord Wang, whose courtesy name was Jingdu, wore a crimson ceremonial robe adorned with nine-colored phoenixes. Upon his head sat the Jade Crown of Soaring Divinity, and in his hand he held a nine-colored staff. He governed the Southern Vermilion Terrace, keeper of the registers of life and death. To know his name, to preserve his spirit, and to cultivate for nine years was to refine the divine herb of immortality. Then would rosy clouds descend in flight to welcome him, and his form ascend to the Jade Clarity Palace.

Also, the Lady of the Southern Pole, fourth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West, was titled the Lady of Purple Primordial Radiance. She wore a brocade robe and a skirt of kingfisher feathers. During the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, she often descended into the stone chamber of Yangluo Mountain. Her attainment of the Dao was most precious, and her literary compositions were worthy of record.

*The Accounts of Eminent Daoists*: Zhang Shizhen dwelled on Mount Nanyue, where a divine being transmitted to him the Dao of the Luminous Mirror. He instructed him in its practice, saying: *"That which illumines the principles of things is Heaven; that which illumines the forms of things is the mirror. The Dao of Heaven is clarity; the Dao of the mirror is luminosity. If one can preserve Heaven’s clarity and the mirror’s brightness, settling the mind and quieting the spirit so that inner and outer are harmonized, then the supreme Dao is achieved. But if one inwardly exhausts the will and outwardly wearies the form, leaving the mind unsettled and the spirit unclear, then the supreme Dao remains distant. As the ancients said: ‘Empty the chamber, and whiteness arises of itself; still the mind, and the Dao arrives of itself.’"* Shizhen cultivated this practice for nine years, and upon attaining the Dao, he was promoted to Perfected One. During the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, he ascended in broad daylight.

*The Continuation of the Accounts of Immortals*: Jin Keji was a man of Silla, learned and skilled in composition. He entered Mount Zhongnan and devoted himself to secret acts of virtue. In the twelfth month of the eleventh year of the Dazhong era of the Tang, he suddenly submitted a memorial stating: *"Your servant has received the Jade Emperor’s decree to serve as Attendant Minister of Literary Excellence. On the twenty-fifth day of the second month, I shall ascend."* Emperor Xuanzong dispatched envoys to summon him to the palace, but he firmly declined. He further requested to see the Jade Emperor’s edict, but was told that such matters were the purview of other immortals and not to be disclosed to mortals. The emperor then bestowed upon him four palace women, fragrant medicines, gold, and silks, and sent two eunuchs to attend him. On the twenty-fifth day of the second month, as spring scenery shone bright and flowers bloomed in radiant splendor, five-colored clouds filled the sky. Cranes cried, phoenixes soared, white swans played flutes, and jade wheels, feathered canopies, and jeweled banners filled the air with celestial regalia. He ascended to heaven and transcended the mortal realm, his accumulated merit perfected. His immortal traces are recorded here to forever illuminate this glorious age.

*Thus concludes the twentieth scroll of the Comprehensive Records of the Immortals of the Three Caverns.*
