**The Great Precepts of Wisdom-Contemplation of the Body**

The *Great Precepts of Wisdom-Contemplation of the Body* scatter their radiance across the vast expanse, illuminating the Great Void, accumulating over thirty kalpas. This text was received by the Primordial Heavenly King from the Most High and Sagely Dao Lord. Together, they ascended the Hall of Cavern Perfection, where it was recited and transmitted to the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity and the High Immortal Heavenly King of the Great Ultimate—passed down orally, never committed to writing.

When the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity received the precepts, he intoned:

Wisdom arises from the root of non-being,
Luminous and bright, transcending the ten directions.
It binds emptiness and erects the Mystic Empyrean,
While all heavens embrace its flowing fragrance.
Its wonders are beyond thought and discourse,
Yet through emptiness, the true and real commune.
Being is not being, non-being is not without,
And in non-being, nothing is not contained.
Wisdom ever contemplates the body—
The foremost task in learning the Dao.
Subtle and boundless, it roams the mysterious vastness,
Naturally recording my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy ever guards and protects,
While demon kings pledge their vows.
Resplendent is the vajra body,
Transcending all before the Most High.
Wisdom generates the root of precepts,
And in the true Dao, precepts are the master.
From this arise the Three Treasures,
Revered and received by the lofty and sagely.
Riding this deathless vessel,
Swiftly we cross the great expanse.
At this preaching of the precepts,
All heavens come to bow in reverence.

These contemplations of bodily precepts, from the first to the three hundredth, are the Dao of the Most High’s Boundless, named the *Highest Jade Clarity Wisdom Upper Prime Precepts*.

The Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning said: The *Highest Cavern Perfection Wisdom Scripture* is not proclaimed to worldly scholars; it is mostly transmitted to those who have already become perfected. It is difficult for people to behold, and even more difficult to exhaust, which is why it is rarely seen in the world. These precepts are revered and weighty, not to be proclaimed in words. By observing the various spirits within the human body’s three hundred joints, the true numina are prevented from reckless departure, and demonic trials cannot violate them. Those who receive and recite these precepts without transgressing their prohibitions may, without study, emerge amidst clouds and rosy mists, where azure chariots naturally welcome them. They may ascend to heaven in broad daylight, their bodies floating upon the empty waves, radiating circular lights from their necks in the ten directions, resplendent in the Great Void. Leading the host of celestial sages, none dare fail to revere them.

The Great Demon King of the Six Heavens will then escort those who uphold the precepts to the Eastern Florescence Palace, where their names are recorded in the Great Brahma Heavenly Palace. In the Great Brahma Heavenly Palace, their names are inscribed in the Jade Capital’s Golden Portals, elevating them to the ranks of the highest immortals.

The Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning said: Reciting the *Great Cavern Perfection Scripture* ten thousand times will summon cloud chariots to descend and welcome the practitioner. The *Numinous Treasure Cavern Mystery Scripture* contains passages on transcending kalpas, yet some who cultivate it fail to attain immortality, or their golden elixir and numinous liquid do not form. Why is this? It is because they have not received and upheld the *Wisdom Contemplation of Bodily Precepts*. Thus, these precepts are the most wondrous of wonders, their numinous power supremely revered. Nine hundred Golden Flower Immortals stand in attendance, burning incense.

This is the true secret Dao, not transmitted in writing but only through recitation and practice. Those who study the Dao without receiving these precepts will never attain immortality. Some may create karmic obstacles, following after sounds and sights; some may begin diligently but slacken in the end; some may enter mountains or dwell at home, only to be tested and defeated by demonic forces; some may harbor stray thoughts, doubting the true scriptures; some may return to worldly ways, losing their Daoist resolve; some may slight their teachers and friends, slandering their fellow students; some may suddenly become mad or foolish, their nature and qi inverted; some may covet wealth and love beauty, scorning the Three Treasures; some may suffer misfortune in their households, encountering resentful adversaries; some may be troubled by nightmares and chaotic thoughts, their spirits vexed and melancholy. All these afflictions arise from lacking the great precepts to gather and guard the mind and spirit, for the three poisons, the floating corpses, and the cunning deceptions of the five palaces are the root of such calamities. The Demon King will not erase their names from the ledgers of the Yellow Springs, and they will not transcend the Three Realms to enter the ranks of immortals.

The Heavenly King of Primordial Beginning said: These precepts were revealed through the numinous immortals, and all the immortals of the various heavens, earthly realms, and renowned mountains uphold and practice them. On the first and fifteenth days of each month, the eight seasonal nodes, one’s natal day, and the celestial fast days, fellow students, teachers, and friends should enter the chamber to recite the precepts in full. First, pay homage to the ten directions, bowing once to each. On the days when the precepts are recited, the various heavens all perform homage.

Disciples who wish to receive the precepts must offer five taels of refined gold as a token to the Five Emperors, and ten bolts of cinnabar brocade as surety for the Ten Directions. The covenant of the fallen hairpin must not leak the precepts; one should serve a precept-master with reverence, fast for three days, and meditate upon the precepts’ essence. On that evening, light ten lamps to honor the radiant sages of the Ten Directions, thereby manifesting the sincerity of one’s heart. If at that time wind, rain, thunder, or violent storms arise, the precepts cannot be received. One must fast anew, recompose oneself with utmost solemnity, and at the appointed hour, allow the spirit to open and the mind to scatter.

After nine years of upholding the precepts, the divine candle will shine of itself; the brilliance of sun and moon will bloom within, a golden countenance will emerge from within, the complexion will remain youthful, the spirit will penetrate the four directions, and one’s virtue will equal that of the loftiest immortals, moving freely between realms. Those who uphold this great precept-law will bathe in the pool of flowing waters, be released upon the seven-jeweled terrace, wander beneath the shade of the Flowery Pond’s boughs, return to the fragrant forest of life, and abide in golden radiance from kalpa to kalpa, forever enjoying the perfection of the Dao.

On one’s natal day, at noon or midnight, face north and recite the *Supreme Chapters of the Revolving Mystery* to pervade the Ten Directions with the Most High. The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity declares: This precept is called the *Precept of Wisdom and Contemplation of the Body*; it is also named the *Divine Writ for Preserving Immortality* and the *Supreme Elixir of Cavernous Perfection for Delivering Life*. Unless one possesses the accumulated merit of past lives, the blessings of ancestral virtue, and the extension of felicitous destiny, one will never be permitted to behold this precious secret. Even those whose names are inscribed on the golden tablets of the Eastern Florescence will not be caused to meet such a master. Those who uphold it are destined for immortality.

To possess scriptures without precepts is like attempting to cross the sea without a boat, or having a mouth without a tongue—how could one thus ferry the body across? Scholars who do not seek scriptures, or who seek scriptures but not precepts, have not awakened to the root of the true essentials; they remain in a long dream without realizing it, which is truly lamentable. All should assess their capacity to uphold them and, with due offerings, receive the precepts. The receiver may transmit them to one person every nine hundred years, not exceeding one; to transmit to more is to leak the precepts. Leaking the precepts incurs guilt upon the seven generations of ancestors, causing parents to suffer in the dark prisons of hell, while the offender traverses the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Adversities, cycling endlessly through kalpas in the evil destinies of the turning wheel, drifting ever farther from immortality. At the appointed time, creditors and karmic adversaries will converge—each must guard their person well.

The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity declares: Those who eavesdrop on the precepts will be seized by the great demons of the Six Heavens, and calamity will inevitably befall them; there is no doubt. If a precept-upholding disciple dwells alone in a mountain forest or perilous place, strike the heavenly drum twelve times, concentrate the mind on the precept-spirits, and the precept-spirits will encircle and protect them in three layers. Demons, ghosts, and malevolent spirits will not dare approach; blessings and virtue will accompany them, and the divine beings of the various heavens will each surround and guard them. Former creditors and adversaries will all generate compassionate hearts.

The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity declares: When I first began my studies, I only knew to request scriptures and did not seek precepts, thus wandering through kalpas of birth and death. The Most High, moved by my devotion to the Dao, and the lofty sages, pitying my tireless efforts, admonished me: “Your learning is ever diligent, yet you do not uphold the *Great Precept of Contemplating the Body*—how then could you attain immortality?” Thereupon, I prostrated myself beneath the Golden Gates for three thousand days, and the Most High bestowed upon me the essential precepts. After nine years of upholding and cultivating them, cloud chariots came to welcome me, and the perfected of the Three Realms and Ten Directions gathered in the Mysterious Void. Thus, those who study the Dao must place precepts first; they are the honored foundation of the Daoist tradition.

The method requires recitation from memory, as the ancient sages kept them secret and committed them entirely to writing. So too must they be upheld today, lest their words fall into the hands of the vulgar. The *Most High’s Lamp-Lighting Hymn* states:

Before lighting the lamps, all should recite this text—not only at the time of receiving the precepts. Strike the teeth three times, softly, so that others do not hear the sound; all tooth-striking should be thus.

The Most High scatters the Ten Directions,
Flower lamps convey sincerity.
The various heavens all do likewise,
The various earths all shine brightly.
My body too becomes luminous,
The five viscera bloom with splendor.
The blazing sun illumines the Great Void,
Distant thoughts flourish in Jade Clarity.
Cinnabar essence lodges in the Great Void,
Mysterious yang turns toward the emptiness.
Embracing form, it extinguishes the roots of suffering,
In profound subtlety, it reaches true contemplation.
Hanging blossoms reveal no reality,
Causal conditions manifest as light and image.
My body is likewise transformed,
Riding transformation, it entrusts itself to the flowing radiance.
The night’s glow reveals the yang elixir,
Shining afar into the numinous chamber.
The various heavens universally display their light,
The various yin realms are thereby extinguished.
My spirit too becomes keen and bright,
Ever delighting in wisdom and insight.
Carefree, it accords with the Dao’s movement,
Changing and passing, it follows heaven’s course.
Raising the body, it leaps into the empty cavern,
The night’s candle blazes with flowing splendor.

The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity declares: To light lamps without reciting this hymn is to fail to transcend the life and death governed by the demonic palaces of the Six Heavens. The jade youths and jade maidens, the flying immortals of the Eight Directions, will not descend to you. The Ten Directions and Three Realms will not ferry your immortal name to the Eastern Florescence and Southern Palace, nor will your seven generations of ancestors and parents receive the Dao of transformation and rebirth.

The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity declares: Those who study the Dao but do not uphold the *Great Precept of Contemplating the Body*, though they recite scriptures ten thousand times and dwell in seclusion in mountain forests, may yet find the attainment of immortality beyond hope. If one can perfect the precepts within and harmonize one’s radiance without, one may yet approach the threshold of the numinous standard. It is not the study of the Dao that is difficult, but the upholding of precepts. If you can perfect the precepts, then the Most High of the Ten Directions will ensure your ascent to immortality. If, having perfected the precepts, you recite the precious scriptures and wear the great talismans, yet still do not attain immortality, then there is truly no path to deathlessness in the world. The lament of my precepts is that those who seek them are rare in this world. In the latter age, many cling to fame and superficial glory, and few possess the true heart of the Dao. Thus, the Three Treasures grow dim, and the sages withdraw into concealment—is the Dao not vast enough? If one fully upholds the precepts, the great sages of the Ten Directions will naturally appear to you, and without further study, the Dao of immortality will be accomplished.

This is no empty speech—what purpose would empty speech serve? It is only to pity the aspiring scholars of the world. If karmic conditions align, might there be those worthy of instruction? Strive on, then, devote yourself, and when the Dao of immortality is accomplished, what joy could compare? Roaming freely in the Jade Capital of the Most High, wandering at will in the realm of spontaneity—this is the joy before the Most High, enduring for ten thousand kalpas as if it had never begun. Such truth cannot be fully expressed in brush and ink.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: I once heard from the Most High that reciting the scriptures of the Three Treasures without upholding the great precepts—how could the myriad wonders of the immortal Dao ever be attained? Thus, it is passed down by word of mouth alone, not committed to writing, and remains secluded within the gardens of the Three Treasures. Those who in past lives lacked the marks of supreme immortality will never be permitted to behold it. Unless one’s seven ancestors have accumulated blessings, their branches flourishing with prosperity, and karmic conditions have ripened through generations, with hidden merits amassed over countless kalpas—how could one aspire to delight in *The Precepts of the Most High for Observing the Body*? Those who uphold these precepts become great Dharma masters of the Most High, the very foundation of the Three Treasures. The Ten Directions will revere you in the celestial river, and the immortals will guide you to the Eastern Flower. You will sit and summon the heavenly demons, and the demon kings will present their tally of destiny to the courts of the Six Heavens and the Nine Springs. The Earth Officials of Mount Tai will no longer hold your name in the registers of the fated dead, and your immortal name in the Azure Palace will be fixed thereby. You shall become a lofty immortal of the Jade Capital, a Perfected of the Most High.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: The essence of the Dao lies in aligning one’s conduct with the hidden statutes and accumulating goodness within—only then may one enter the realm of the great Dao. Those who cannot do so labor in vain amid the dust of the world, gaining nothing for the length of their lives. The Dao resides within oneself, not in others. Only through compassion, love, forbearance, and humility—by practicing these four virtues—does one draw near to the Dao. Through diligence, faith, perseverance to the end, admonition, and the renunciation of sensuality and wine—these are the six perfections, and by them, one becomes a companion to the Perfected. To endure wrongs without self-justification, to yield to others, to be free of desire, to endure unreasonable demands without contention, to retreat to secluded places far from the unprincipled, to remain true to one’s heart, to never betray the scriptures and precepts, and to refrain from boastful speech—these eight abilities make one a friend to all that is good.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: The precepts as the Way are majestic and spiritually wondrous, yet I fear that few will wholeheartedly embrace them. Thus, they must be kept secret and not written down. For this reason, the scriptures of wisdom cannot be fully revealed to those of shallow learning. They are transmitted only by word of mouth—how else could they be disclosed?

When the precepts are expounded, the devas and humans of the ten directions press their palms together in reverence to listen, while ghosts and spirits all pay homage—how could one treat what one hears with levity?

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: The ancients who cultivated the Dao did so with profound tranquility, calming the spirit and contemplating the true, naturally abiding in stillness. Through sitting in forgetfulness of the true Dao, they attained perfect composure, and cloud chariots stood ready to receive them. Some rode the wind through the void, mounted dragons to soar through the heavens, or leapt bodily into the infinite, ascending to the Great Ultimate, their forms dissolving into the boundless without reliance. Thus, their traces could not be seen, and the world knew them not. Those who knew them were rare, and those who valued them were precious—such is the meaning of this. The tally is matched, the covenant fulfilled.

If one relies on deceptive words to secure the position of teacher or friend, this is not the method of high antiquity but a fabrication of later learners. If a scholar truly wishes to request the precious scriptures, one must carefully observe their character. Once their intent is thoroughly awakened, the scriptures are presented before the Most High, and after making a formal petition, they are entrusted to them, commanding them to follow the text and uphold it as their standard—only then does it accord with the great statutes and laws of the Most High.

If one lacks the capacity to propagate the Dao, how can the seven ancestors be certified across the ten directions? How could one dare to transgress this? One must first deeply reflect and examine whether one can personally uphold it. The three paths of hell, the ten sufferings, and the eight difficulties—how could these be taken lightly? Gazing upon them should chill the heart. For all worthy and good ones, be prudent and clearly observe the precepts, and blessings will naturally follow. If one betrays this resolve, calamity will likewise arise of itself. Agonizing pain will pierce the body, and time cannot be reversed—how much less can one escape death for kalpas on end?

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: Though kalpas may begin and end, these precepts remain the unchanging Dao. The ancients said: Receive them and embody them in conduct, and on the day the Dao is perfected, whether one’s attainment is outwardly manifest or concealed, worldly circumstances cannot fathom one’s cultivation. Thus, in high antiquity, one donned robes and sat in forgetfulness to attain the Dao; the Yellow Emperor refined the elixir and was welcomed by dragons, thereby penetrating the vision of the ten directions and transcending the three realms. Wang Qiao and Chi Songzi soared aloft on purple mist to the celestial courts—all were of this kind. To exhaustively explain and record this would be impossible; is this not what is meant by attaining immortality without study?
