### **The Supreme Primordial Treasure Scripture of the Golden Court of Non-Action**

#### **Chapter One: The Great Void**
The Dao speaks:
Formless, it merges with the Void; within it, the myriad things move through the Two Modes—this is called the Great Void.
Thus, within the Void there is Non-Being; within Non-Being there is Being. Being gives rise to the One; the One gives rise to the Two; the Two gives rise to the Three; the Three gives rise to the myriad things—this is called the Great Origin.
The Great Void is the workings of spirit; through its workings, the myriad things are born.
The Great Origin is the transformation of spirit; through its transformation, the myriad things take form.
Born without attachment, formed without action—how wondrous its principle! Who would claim that the vastness of Heaven and Earth could ever alter its law?

The Queen Mother of the West says:
The Dao is so great that it encompasses Heaven and Earth, yet its Dao is unseen.
I would transcend Heaven and Earth to behold the formless Dao, to create the True Void, and to turn the mechanism of supreme subtlety—how could this be otherwise?
Thus, for the divine person who would observe beyond Heaven and Earth, nothing surpasses the formless.
To fashion the Eight Subtleties of the Void, nothing surpasses spiritual transformation.
The form of the formless, the transformation of spiritual transformation—this may be called the Dao.

#### **Chapter Two: Wondrous Transformation**
The Dao speaks:
Can the Dao be enacted? Its function lies in wondrous application; its essence lies in True Emptiness.
Thus, the living observe it to live; the dying observe it to die.
Hard and soft draw upon the Dao of Earth as their material; yin and yang follow the Dao of Heaven to attain fulfillment.
Thereafter, the myriad things transform without comprehension; the Five Phases each follow their nature—all through the Dao of Primordial Unity, conforming to the numbers of spontaneity.
The sage embodies subtlety to observe the world.
The world transforms spontaneously, thus following the course of nature and destiny.
To observe the heart of Heaven and Earth is to attain the subtlety of the world’s heart.
The world’s heart is the attainment of the people.
Having attained the people and drawn them near, they return as infants to their nursing mother.
Those who establish the world’s laws model them upon the heart’s own attainment.

The Queen Mother of the West says:
With a single heart, one observes the world—the world is but a single heart.
With many hearts, one observes the world—the world is but many hearts.
Exhaust the heart to observe the people’s hearts; the people’s hearts rest in the heart.
Preserve the heart with one’s own heart—then the world is all one’s own heart.
Heart upon heart, subtlety upon subtlety; observation upon observation, spontaneous transformation.
To govern the world without disorder, to govern the four limbs without peril—if later generations practice this, who would not find peace and return to the world?

#### **Chapter Three: Spontaneity**
The Dao speaks:
That which is nameless yet named is spiritual transformation; that which arises spontaneously is wondrous application.
The world’s subtleties have form: the subtlety of yin and yang, the presence of cold and heat.
The sage attains the Dao of spontaneity, embodying Heaven and Earth, calculating yin and yang, modeling cold and heat, circulating qi, and harmonizing male and female through the union of essence and spirit—shifting with the four seasons’ swiftness and slowness.
Observing from beyond Heaven and Earth through the Dao of spontaneity, thus all who cast off the mundane and enter sageliness undergo transformation, and those who enter the divine undergo transmutation—transforming Heaven and Earth.
The mechanism of the Perfected is the law beyond form.
Who can wield the subtlety of the formless to transform the formless? The formless, in turn, takes form.
If one wishes to enter form from the formless, to employ form for this—all is the Dao of spontaneity.

The Queen Mother of the West says:
The Dao of spontaneity refines qi to preserve the True, emerging from the gate of life and death.
Within the utmost emptiness and non-being, it once more unites the utmost spirit with form, shifting and transforming in coming and going, aligning with the revolutions to observe the sagely, responding to the mechanism’s Dao—yet it cannot be approached.
Having already transcended life and death, entered non-being and formlessness—why then return to the bodily form?
For if all is non-being, how can spirit know? If all is being, how can spirit depart?
Spontaneous spiritual transformation—all being, all non-being—spirit remains whole and undispersed.
Yet when proven in material form, what thing does it enter or leave?
Thus it is said: The sage leaves no traces; the Perfected leaves no tracks.

#### **Chapter Four: The Great Subtlety**
The Dao speaks:
The Dao has that which cannot be spoken, and that which can be spoken.
That which cannot be spoken is great; that which can be spoken is small.
That which cannot be spoken gives life and death to the myriad things, shifting spirit and altering subtlety.
That which can be spoken gives rise to the life and death of the myriad things; Heaven and Earth are created and transformed through it.
Thus, the Dao of the Perfected attains the principle of the Great Subtlety—yet it cannot be expressed in form or words.
If it cannot be spoken, then observe only the words of Heaven and Earth.
The Dao of Heaven has short and long: only the short becomes shorter, while the long does not become longer again.
Moreover, to the right of the Great Origin, days grow long and people grow great; years lengthen and things flourish—yet in this age, all is short: the people are frivolous, the fortunes brief.
The measure of Heaven is three hundred and sixty-five calendrical divisions; if diminished, it harmonizes; if augmented, it weakens.

The Queen Mother of the West says:
The Great Subtlety is the law of Heaven’s waxing and waning.
The Dao of Heaven gradually shortens; the Dao of Earth gradually lengthens.
Rulers multiply their departures; the people suffer hunger and thinness.
The Dao of Heaven often seems insufficient—thus the revolutions of graded difference.
Heaven is long, Earth is short; Heaven is distant, Earth is near; yang wanes, yin reaches its extreme.
Ever knowing the Dao of the Great Subtlety, one thereby rectifies and orders yin and yang, observing Heaven, Earth, and humanity.

#### **Chapter Five: Spirit-Wandering**
The Dao speaks:
Spirit-wandering traverses beyond the Eight Heavens, to the utmost qi of the Eight Yangs, the stars that weave Heaven’s woof, the degrees that measure the River’s warp—thus the *Supreme Primordial Treasure Scripture of the Golden Court of Non-Action* transforms form.
The Dao of Heaven responds with goodness to non-being.
The subtlety of wordless speech—the Perfected grasps the true mechanism of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, the Eight Limits revolve in cycles; one may wander and interchange forms and vessels.
The spirit of humanity arises from wholeness and stability, attaining perfection—its wondrous wandering cannot be guarded, for all is the principle of spontaneity.

The Queen Mother of the West says:
I once received from the Yellow Emperor the subtlety of spirit-wandering.

The spirit-wanderer rides the fire dragon to ascend and govern Heaven. The Perfected’s spirit flourishes in wholeness; yin and yang are complete, the body is harmonious, the voice carries far and distinct. With a finger, one opens the Gate of Heaven, releasing the crimson seal’s radiance—thus the spirit crosses of itself. Returning to the great gate, the finger descends of itself. Since the spirit is whole and able to depart, one naturally senses no constraint within. Spirit and body separate; the mind directs toward the Gate of Heaven, emitting light from between the brows and the Hall of the Seal—thus the spirit emerges of itself. If one merely exits the Gate of Heaven without opening the Hall of the Seal, the departure will be irreversible. The crimson palace’s seal is the heart; though the spirit departs, the hun-soul does not. The crimson palace’s seal, where the heart retains the hun-soul, is not yet dead—thus the spirit still has a body.

**Chapter Six: Governing Qi**
The Dao speaks: Qi is the substance of form and formlessness. Gathered, it becomes form; dispersed, it becomes wind; stirred, it becomes movement; congealed, it becomes things. For the Perfected to govern qi is to preserve qi and refine the bones—when bones are light, there is no clumping. Accumulate essence to perfect the spirit; the spirit transforms and qi rides upon it. The Dao of governing qi begins with lightening the body. To lighten the body, set immortality as the heart’s intent, and first cease labor, hunger, thirst, and desire. Act before the body, and qi will begin to ride. When the body departs yet the spirit remains whole, qi governs of itself.

The Queen Mother of the West says: To guard the governing of qi—if one relies on the body, it is laborious and difficult to achieve; if one relies on the spirit’s spontaneity, it may be attained. The ancients consumed qi to lighten the bones and ingested herbs to lighten the body. Thus, with lightened body and bones, qi may be governed—entering water without drowning, entering fire without burning. The Dao begins with ingesting herbs to cease grain-eating as supreme, and consuming qi with a mindless heart as foremost. When the Perfected’s body is light, the body resembles pine and poria. Consuming qi is the qi of the Zi-Wu hexagram’s completion. Ingesting herbs creates emptiness; emptiness becomes the body—thus qi is attained.

**Chapter Seven: The Great One**
The Dao speaks: Heaven is eternally clear, Earth eternally tranquil—all is the Dao of the Great One. Thus, affairs value having a beginning, and then there is constancy. With constancy, there is no arising or ceasing. Without arising or ceasing, Heaven and Earth do not act as thieves to it, and it is called the Great One. Heaven has the Great One, and the myriad things are born. Humans have the Great One, and the Five Phases are employed. The One is Heaven’s utmost essence—unmuddied, unburdened, supremely clear, supremely numinous. The true treasury of ceaseless generation—thus the Four Images are illuminated.

The Queen Mother of the West says: The Great One is the primordial ancestor. Nurtured, it is inexhaustible; employed, it is unfailing. It generates the myriad things, the ancestor of qi, the foundation of creation. Once humans enter the subtlety of the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams and again perceive the Great One, they know that Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang do not steal from them, and all revolving to left and right is their own possession. Unassailed by weapons, unenticed by profit—this may be called utmost oneness. Form attains the One and is not wearied; spirit attains the One and is greatly perfected. Thus, the One—at the beginning, observe the great river’s waters, flowing ceaselessly. Overflowing the heart’s source, they breach the ocean’s waves, surging endlessly, streaming into the spirit’s treasury. Then the spirit moves and form is whole; the spirit is whole and form flourishes.

**Chapter Eight: Non-Action**
The Dao speaks: Non-action is non-action without non-action; action is action with action. The spirit can shift and transform, seizing the true qi. It can inhale and exhale yin and yang, externally forgetting hunger and cold, internally forgetting ascent and descent, taking self-attainment as the heart, taking emptiness and non-being as conduct. Thus it is said: non-action. Non-action should have no use for action, yet takes action as its root. With a root in action, the Five Phases come first. For those who act as Heaven and Earth, there is action in the many hands, non-action in the folded hands. For those who match the Five Phases, there is action in the Four Images, non-action in imagelessness. Folded hands—sages let robes and skirts hang loose, and the world is governed. Imagelessness—the Perfected perfects the spirit, and form is naturally at peace.

The Queen Mother of the West says: Learning reaches its limit in reduction; the Dao reaches its limit in non-action—this is the ultimate attainment. Observing without observation, abiding without abode, moving without movement, employing without employment—though Heaven and Earth are vast, they are not vast; though yin and yang are subtle, they are not subtle. The Perfected enters the realm of utmost stillness, the realm of emptiness and non-being—this may be called non-action. Thus, non-action has its mechanism, and action is unceasing; non-action loses its mechanism and perishes of itself.

**Chapter Nine: Generating the Spirit**
The Dao speaks: When the Five Stars gather in the Celestial Market, sages are born; when the Five Phases match Earth’s qi, the myriad things take form—thus the Dao of Heaven and Earth all has constant numeration. Humans have the Five Stars gathered in the central treasury, the utmost refined qi, and thus the inner sage is born. The Five Phases match Earth’s qi, and thus things take form. Within humans, the Five Phases gather in the spirit’s treasury, the Jade Flower appears, and the Five Phases descend to the center and preside. The Perfected is humanity’s true self. First is the womb immortal, second the true form, third the true child, fourth the womb true—all are one. Able to be one’s own form, able to speak one’s own affairs, knowing all, penetrating all, exiting and entering life and death, lifting and carrying Heaven and Earth—thus it is called spirit. This is the Perfected.

The Queen Mother of the West says: The spirit first knows to preserve form, preserves life without dying, exits and enters the Gate of Heaven, becomes one’s inner body, adheres and transforms, accompanying the body equally—this is the true within the womb. Within, Kan and Li intermingle and generate the womb; the womb generates inner and outer numinosity—thus one can exit form without dying, enter life without being born.

**Chapter Ten: The Jade Flower**
The Dao speaks: Humans are constantly without mind, constantly without constant form—Heaven and Earth move and rest. Yet there are those who can endure long, for they attain the One, and the spirit resides within. Humans have minds, and thus drift in the currents of life and death, emerging and submerging in love and desire—then they scatter and are no longer seen.

One who can preserve the One and maintain authenticity for long, practicing the Dao of stabilizing the spirit, may then perceive it. The Queen Mother of the West says: The human heart is the palace of the Sovereign; its spirit is the Lord of Jade Flower. Stabilizing the spirit and severing thoughts, free from dreams, waking terrors, or palpitations—practicing this long and steadfastly—one may respond to the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth, the affairs of ghosts and spirits, all becoming thoroughly clear and understood. Thus one becomes an Inner Sage. The true persons of antiquity took this as their teacher, crossing unknowable perils, aiding the ghosts of Yellow Springs. All ascend through the Three Realms, gathering the hidden and obscure of Heaven and Earth, tracing the subtle and concealed of yin and yang—all is naturally attained.

The spirit arises from the completeness of the Five Phases, transforming and ascending into the Cinnabar Chamber, seated at the Southern Culmen upon the Winding River. Within the body, the eight stars and three primordial spirits pay homage day and night. If even one spirit fails to attend, it is said that unforeseen calamity will strike, and one’s name will be erased from the registers of the unseen.

**Chapter Eleven: Uniting the Body**
The Dao speaks: The Five Phases gather, husband and wife unite—when husband and wife unite, the true becomes true. After ten months, the true child is born. The true child is the spirit complete, the inner body. It exits and enters beyond Heaven and Earth, traverses beyond the eight poles of creation, comes and goes through the celestial cycles, paces the stars and steps the sun, parts the near clouds and rainbows, gathers the sources of the Milky Way, and returns to the things of transformation—thus it is called *Uniting the Body*.

The Queen Mother of the West says: The formless within form unites with form—thus humans may attain long life. Form is vast because of the formless. Forms are many because of the formless. What exists can be measured; what exists can be seen. Yet the form of the formless, transforming into myriad bodies, is not considered numerous. The formless attaches to form, and form becomes its dwelling. Form attaches to the formless, and the formless becomes its master. All masters thus do not die. Those who pace the stars do so by exiting the Gate of Heaven with this body, reaching the Ox and Dipper, and proceeding to the Celestial Market—thus knowing the yet-unrealized affairs of the world.

**Chapter Twelve: Preserving the Form**
The Dao speaks: The Dao of not dying is thus called *Preserving the Form*. The Dao of preserving the form lies in refining the form. When the true person can refine the Five Phases, unite yin and yang, and intermingle Kan and Li, then old age returns to a state like an infant. Thereafter, returning to the Cinnabar Field, one naturally possesses qi. When clarity ascends to the Crimson Palace, it transforms into spontaneous radiance, suffusing the entire body. In the dark of night, amidst quiet observation, myriad spirits pay homage—then the form is not stolen by thieves.

**The Queen Mother of the West states:** The formless form enables longevity; the qi-less qi enables immortality. The formless means not taking form as form. The qi-less means qi is what forms it. Ordinary people’s qi scatters and does not transform; the true person’s qi transforms and does not scatter.

**Chapter Thirteen: Kan and Li**
The Dao speaks: Within yin there is yang, and yang is the supreme yang. Within yang there is yin, and yin is the supreme yin. The north is yin, its spirit is water, which gives birth to the myriad things—it is the ancestor of qi and the origin of all yang. The south is yang, its spirit is fire, which transforms the myriad things—it is the root of form and the convergence of all yin. Kan preserves essence and safeguards qi without withering; Li stabilizes spirit and refines the true without obscurity. To know this most subtly is to be called a true person.

**The Queen Mother of the West states:** The essence of yin and yang is Kan and Li. Stabilizing spirit and rectifying nature arise from the heart’s unwavering clarity; preserving essence and nurturing qi ensure qi is never exhausted. Water, if dammed, flows; if blocked, it rots. Fire, if stirred, burns; if stilled, it shines. Thus, the sage guides the water, causing it to ascend from the earthly gate to irrigate the Muddy Pellet, then descend to the Flowery Pond and enter the Crimson Palace. As for fire, if the heart is not constrained by things, always existing as if non-existent, and not moved by externals, then over time, the spirit will not scatter.

**Chapter Fourteen: Union**
The Dao speaks: Kan male and Li female, the Yellow Dame arranges their marriage; the Metal Mother and Wood Father serve as matchmakers to connect them. Moreover, the Dao of union lies in the convergence of the Five Phases. The Five Phases are union. When the Five Phases gather, metal and wood interact, then Kan male and Li female meet and unite. The Four Symbols come and go, communicating affection. The Five Phases assemble, forming pairs.

**The Queen Mother of the West states:** When male and female meet, it occurs at the fiftieth cycle. Fifty signifies a man at thirty and a woman at twenty—this is the harmony of heaven and earth’s numbers. The man embodies the heavenly Dao: Kan moves with one, its palace holding water. The woman embodies the earthly Dao: Li corresponds to two, its palace holding fire. When Kan encounters three, wood connects and fire depletes. When Li encounters four, metal speaks of water’s nature. When Kan encounters five, the Yellow Dame guides it upward. When Li encounters six, water draws it downward. When Kan encounters seven, fire matures and they unite. When Li encounters eight, wood adorns it with roots. When Kan encounters nine, the Metal Mother meets in union. When Li encounters ten, earth forms the pair. These are the numbers of the Five Phases’ interactions. Preserve the spirit to perfection, and water and fire will naturally become efficacious.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Five Phases**
The Dao speaks: The heavens have five planets, the earth has five constants, and humans have the Five Phases—these are natural things. Only when the Four Symbols gather at the center does the Golden Elixir shine brilliantly. When yin and yang unite and the Two Modes form a pair, then ascent and descent begin. Metal fills and generates water, and water first transforms—thus it is called *qi-water*. Qi-water, when moving, ascends as qi; when still, it takes form as water. Water has great benefit, giving life to the myriad things—thus water is the essence of the myriad things. When water is complete, fire gathers; then the dragon moves ahead, the tiger follows behind, the Four Symbols unite as one, and the Five Phases assemble.

**The Queen Mother of the West states:** When qi is still and spirit is stabilized, Kan and Li are complete. When Kan and Li are complete, then metal and wood separate. When metal and wood separate, the Five Phases move. When the Five Phases move, the center gathers. Fire arises from below, water irrigates from above; the elixir forms in the heated crucible. Taking day and night as a cycle, the twelve hours as twelve months, and the twenty-four qi as seasonal divisions—this models heaven and earth, creates yin and yang, and follows the natural pattern. Thus it is said: Nurturing the Golden Elixir for three years makes one a true person. At the winter solstice, yang is born and fire is advanced; at the summer solstice, yin is born and fire is withdrawn. Advancing and withdrawing each use twelve measures.

**Chapter Sixteen: Obtaining the Ground**
The Dao speaks: When the two qi ascend and descend, and the three palaces rise and fall, then the Five Phases unite and gather in the central land. The union of the Five Phases first depends on its ground. Water is born from metal: Kan moves and Dui generates, advancing fire. Fire is born from wood: Li moves and Zhen leads, circulating water. Without metal, water does not form; without wood, fire does not move. The Yellow Dao resides at the center, and the Five Phases gather there. The method of obtaining the ground lies in balancing qi and regulating water, stabilizing breath and nurturing fire, ensuring that above and below do not separate. After three hundred and sixty days of practice, one enters stillness—this is where the method of longevity begins.

**The Queen Mother of the West states:** The Dao of life and nurturance fundamentally seeks its root; the benefit of planting and cultivation lies in obtaining the ground. Obtaining the ground means the three fields are level and the Four Symbols are harmonious. The three fields being level refers to the three cinnabar fields being balanced, their names unchanging, allowing one to observe the natural qi of the Four Symbols—this is called obtaining the ground. Obtaining the ground is the Dao of the true person. The Five Phases’ abilities, the five evils and ten poisons, leave the skin without cold or suffering, the flesh without decay or neglect. Against the weapons of the five armies, even blood does not flow. Blood not flowing means the spirit is stabilized.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Three Palaces**
The Dao speaks: Above is the Muddy Pellet, in the center is the Divine Mansion, and below is the Azure Sea. The three palaces are the source of life and death, each capable of giving life or causing death. To attain longevity, one must know their spirits. Obtain their spirits and employ their methods. The upper palace, the Muddy Pellet, is the source of essence. If the Muddy Pellet does not open, essence does not scatter and spirit does not depart. The middle palace, the Crimson Palace, is the dwelling of spirit. If the Crimson Palace is unmoved, essence does not stray and spirit does not weary. The lower palace, the Cinnabar Field, is the root of true water. If the Cinnabar Field is not agitated, essence does not leak and spirit does not die.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Two Qi**

The Dao speaks: The first death is called "brain leakage into essence"; the second death, "spirit shifting into the kidneys"; the third death, "essence draining and spirit scattering." To attain longevity, ensure the upper and lower do not abandon each other.

The Queen Mother of the West says: The upper Cinnabar Field’s palace is the palace of all yang. The utmost essence of yang gathers in the Celestial Pool. The Celestial Pool is the palace of the Cinnabar Field within the brain, the root of life and the dwelling of primordial *qi*. If one wishes the spirit not to scatter, guard the Muddy Pellet without movement. To keep the Muddy Pellet unmoved, guard the heart. When the heart is still, all things are complete. Thus it is said: Fire refines the Muddy Pellet, consolidating it so it does not leak; fire draws the Muddy Pellet, causing leakage and the death of spirit.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Two Qi**

The Dao speaks: When the two *qi* are harmonized and set in motion, the Four Symbols contain radiance. The body transforms into primordial subtlety, movement and bearing circulate in all directions. Left and right, above and below, water and fire are drawn to and fro, nurturing the golden elixir’s embryonic treasure. Use metal as the crucible. Metal is *qi*. Burn it with wood. Wood is power. Within are the Eight Trigrams, Four Symbols, and Five Phases—natural things. The trigrams of the celestial cycle are the numbers of nature. Only the method of drawing water and fire with the two *qi* first requires harmonization.

The Queen Mother of the West says: The two *qi* are metal and wood. Metal is white in color; its virtue is majesty; its spirit, the tiger. Thus the *qi* of the lungs is called the White Tiger. Wood is green in color; its virtue is gentleness; its spirit, the dragon. Thus the *qi* of the liver is called the Green Dragon. Without the two *qi*, Kan and Li do not arise. If Kan and Li do not arise, there is no configuration for union. Therefore, regulate the *qi* to nurture the dragon, circulating it through the Gate of Heaven and Earth. The Gate of Heaven is the Muddy Pellet; the Gate of Earth, the Tail Gate. Then accumulate *qi* to nourish the dragon. Thus *qi* accumulates into water, and from water the dragon is born. Dragon moves and tiger follows, ascending and descending, drawing water and fire.

**Chapter Nineteen: Seizing the Movements**

The Dao speaks: Heaven has the Five Movements; Earth has the Six Qi. They generate the myriad things and accomplish transformation. If one knows the movements of Heaven and Earth, one attains longevity without death. To understand their *qi*, know this: Heaven’s Five Movements are the *qi* of the Five Phases; Earth’s Six Qi are the numina of the Six Jia. One who knows the Five Phases and Six Jia yet is not a thief of Heaven and Earth is a Perfected Person. The Perfected Person seizes the movements of Heaven and Earth, ingesting the *qi* of the eight seasonal nodes.

Zhen corresponds to the eastern wood and is suitable for nourishing the liver. Li corresponds to the southern fire and is suitable for nourishing the heart. Dui corresponds to the western metal and is suitable for nourishing the lungs. Kan corresponds to the northern water and is suitable for nourishing the kidneys. Xun in the southeast is suitable for nourishing the gallbladder. Kun in the southwest is suitable for nourishing the stomach. Qian in the northwest is suitable for nourishing the large intestine. Gen in the northeast is suitable for nourishing the small intestine and bladder. This is seizing the movements of Heaven and Earth, not being a thief of them.

The Queen Mother of the West says: In spring and summer, nourish yang; in autumn and winter, nourish yin. Nourish yang with water; nourish yin with fire. The Five Phases rely on the two *qi*. Exhalation expels yin; inhalation draws in yang. Preserve the upright *qi* of the Five Phases: wood grows, fire sharpens, metal squares, water scatters. Thus inbreath and outbreath form a cycle. Regulate and nourish them—this is also called ingesting the flourishing *qi* of the eight nodes. Practiced over time, one will no longer hunger or thirst.

**Chapter Twenty: Riding the Wind**

The Dao speaks: Heaven and Earth possess the *qi* of yin and yang, circulating through the four seasons to produce cold and heat. Thus cold arises when yang conceals and yin emerges; heat arises when yin recedes and yang ascends. Heaven and Earth have the signs of cold and heat; humans also have the signs of cold and heat. The natural cold and heat of Heaven’s movements have differences in speed and slowness, but human movements have no reversal of yin and yang’s transformations. When Heaven’s yin emerges and yang conceals, great cold causes *qi* to congeal and accumulate, hence winter’s descent of frost and snow is fitting. When Heaven’s yin recedes and yang ascends, great heat causes coagulation, hence summer’s rains are often torrential. If one embodies this, making yin overcome heat and yang overcome cold, then clouds may be ridden and wind may be harnessed.

**Chapter Twenty-One: Forgetting Form**

The Dao speaks: To forget form is where *qi* gathers; *qi* is what form employs. Since there is form, without *qi* it cannot live. The way to nourish form begins with *qi*. Now that there is form, it is merely constrained by *qi*. All people take *qi* as their root; form should not be burdened by *qi*. Thus the Perfected Person, though possessing form, can forget it—this is the true Dao. To forget form is to refine *qi* and unite with form, unattached to things. Thus refining *qi* stabilizes the spirit. When the spirit is stable, *qi* is upright; when *qi* is upright, there is no cold or heat. Without cold or heat, form is not constrained. When form is not constrained, form may be forgotten.

The Queen Mother of the West says: Form is the dwelling of *qi*; *qi* is the function of spirit. When *qi* is complete and spirit is upright, there is inner true *qi*. Thus form does not cling to *qi*, and *qi* is not constrained by form. Its subtlety lies in circulating the full *qi* of the Five Phases up and down at midnight, as if in a primordial chaos. After three thousand days, *qi* can depart from form, and thus form may be forgotten. To depart from form is for spirit to emerge. When spirit emerges, it moves through *qi* by means of spirit-*qi*. When *qi* moves, then form becomes formless.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Primordial Qi**

The Dao speaks: When *qi* is ordered, illness does not arise; when *qi* is complete, spirit is naturally numinous. To order *qi* is to regulate the disharmony of the five viscera and four limbs. If there is illness in the abdomen, direct the gaze up and down, send left to right and right to left. Then lie prone, bend both hands beneath the heart, and align with the nape of the neck—benefit will come naturally. When the five viscera are deficient, face the five directions and visualize their colors, absorbing them to be cured.

The method for preserving primordial *qi*: Visualize *qi* ascending from the Primordial Sea, causing it to flow and circulate without cease. After thirty days, form will naturally depart.

To cultivate primordial *qi*, let it transform from small to great, adding to it daily. After forty-nine days, it will fill the body. When the body is full of *qi* and devoid of illness, the spirit will naturally align.

The Queen Mother of the West says: Primordial *qi* is refined *qi*. First, let fire flow unceasingly from the cinnabar field. At the initial hour of *zi*, perform three hundred and sixty cycles. At the initial hour of *wu*, let it descend from the heart and perform another three hundred and sixty cycles—then *qi* is primordial. One cycle is one round.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Entering the Chamber**

The Dao speaks: For the perfected person to nurture form, nothing surpasses refining *qi*. To refine *qi*, nothing surpasses stabilizing the spirit. To stabilize the spirit, nothing surpasses entering the chamber. Entering the chamber is the method for nurturing and settling the spirit.

In winter, keep warm; in summer, keep cool. In winter, do not use fire; in summer, do not use wind. Sit only on a proper mat, and the chamber must face south. First, dispel external pathogenic influences so they do not invade; then internal pathogenic influences will not arise. To dispel is to prevent pathogenic *qi* from invading, so the body naturally finds peace.

The Queen Mother of the West says: The art of entering the chamber requires a room six *zhang* square. Place windows on the east and west, and a door on the south, twelve *chi* high. The seating area should be eight *chi* square, furnished with thick woolen cushions. In summer, add a mat on top, and place armrests on either side. Sit upright with feet hanging down, one *chi* and two *cun* from the floor, so that rising and resting on either side does not cause fatigue. Then arrange the four sides.

The four sides should be draped with blue and white curtains; do not use the five colors, lest prolonged exposure blind the eyes. The eaves outside the door should be white, so the body finds peace and *qi* is not harmed.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Serving Qi**

The Dao speaks: *Qi* is supremely great and numinous, transforming heaven and earth, nurturing the myriad things. Though its bounds are unseen, every thing is of it. Without carving, the myriad things take form; without lifting, the myriad things come to life. Gathered, it becomes substance; dispersed, it becomes wind. Heaven knows not *qi* as heaven, earth knows not *qi* as earth, humans know not *qi* as humans, the myriad things know not *qi* as the myriad things, ghosts and spirits know not *qi* as ghosts and spirits, the ten thousand images know not *qi* as the ten thousand images.

If one knows what *qi* transforms, does one not know what *qi* steals? Heaven’s movements are external; humans respond, yet heaven does not steal their lifespan. Earth bears all below; humans respond, yet earth does not steal their bodies. The myriad things appear and respond, yet do not steal their *qi*. One who knows *qi* knows where yang is born.

The Queen Mother of the West says: *Qi* in heaven generates one yang at the winter solstice, and the myriad images respond. *Qi* on earth generates one yin at the summer solstice, and the myriad things respond. *Qi* in humans: at the initial hour of *zi*, when all yin converges, one yang is born—yang is born from true water. At the initial hour of *wu*, when all yang converges, one yin is born—yin is born from true fire.

True water’s *qi* resides in the kidneys; kidney *qi* must not be stirred. True fire’s *qi* resides in the heart; heart *qi* must not be stirred. Where *qi* resides, visualize and respond to it.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: Stabilizing the Spirit**

The Dao speaks: The human spirit has the heart as its chamber, blood as its sustenance, *qi* as its root, and the four limbs and five viscera as its servants. The spirit in the body is like a dwelling with life. If the dwelling has life, it thrives; without life, it decays.

When the dwelling is new but lifeless, doors and windows unclosed, dust and filth enter from all sides. Pigs and rats gnaw its foundation, birds and sparrows peck its holes—gradually, it collapses. When the dwelling is dilapidated and lifeless, doors and windows crumble, dust and filth overflow. Pigs and rats ruin its foundation, birds and sparrows overturn its roof—then, though one wishes it not to decay, there is no way; it soon collapses.

When a person’s spirit is whole and *qi* is aligned, stabilizing it is easy. The way to stabilize the spirit lies in guarding the heart; guarding the heart lies in cutting off thoughts; cutting off thoughts lies in ceasing desires—then the heart is upright. When the heart is upright, the spirit is stabilized.

The Queen Mother of the West says: The way of stabilizing and guarding is to know contentment, ensuring hunger and cold do not press in, and no reckless thoughts bind you. Nurture it by ascending to the heart with joy. At midnight, do not sit upright—simply level your hands, let the four limbs rest, cut off reckless thoughts, and visualize your body sitting within your heart. Practice this for seven months, and the spirit will not age. When the spirit is stabilized and *qi* is aligned, it remains ever like an infant, and the spirit is naturally numinous.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: Cutting Off Thoughts**

The Dao speaks: Thoughts arise from the human mind. Humans have constant desires; when the mind strays even a single thought, the spirit stirs heaven and earth, searching the traces of yin and yang, going everywhere—where it goes is desire. Knowing and seeing desires arise, they become habitual.

Thoughts are a net in the void, vast and without attachment. The mind roams without cease, the spirit does not rest, *qi* is not aligned, the body is not at peace. Over time, this causes blood to wane, bones to decay, sinews to weaken, and essence to deplete. Then one dies yet does not transform; the hun-soul still wanders, unable to return and be reborn—thus becoming a *wangliang*.

Therefore, the perfected person cuts off thoughts: acting without acting, not seeking appearances in future thoughts, responding to things as they come, adapting to affairs as they arise, acting when possible, stopping when not—thus, even in death, the spirit does not become a *wangliang*.

The Queen Mother of the West says: Human thoughts, when acted upon, bring misfortune. If humans had no thoughts, they would be unaware. Cutting off thoughts means not being greedy for or attached to sounds and sights, so the spirit is not enslaved.

The art of the perfected lies in guarding the heart without movement. The method for guarding the heart: at dawn, rise, adjust your robes and cap, enter the chamber, face south, clasp your hands, and sit. Envision your heart as white jade. Practice this for forty-nine days, and the spirit will stabilize.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Cessation of Desires**

The Dao says: Reduce thoughts and diminish desires, and heaven and earth will not overturn. Still contemplation and forget schemes, and yin and yang will harmonize. All worldly scholars who cherish life must first cultivate the heart. Cultivating the heart lies in acting when desiring to act, yet not acting; moving when desiring to move, yet not moving—thus, even when not yet perfected, there is no harm in non-action.

Therefore, the perfected first nurture the body, then nurture the heart. Only after nurturing the heart can desires be without desire, and thus one knows the spirits of heaven and earth and does not die. Not only does one not die, but one does not age.

The Queen Mother of the West says: Humans have hearts, and thus they fall ill; without illness, they live. Knowing what is wrong, they do not act. Heaven and earth have decay, yet heaven and earth do not change, and thus they do not die. Knowing what is wrong and rejecting it, ghosts and spirits do not steal, and heaven and earth do not take away.

Therefore, in the dead of night, guard the *qi* of the cinnabar field, as the moon wanes and waxes. With the heart shielding and cutting off desires, after seven days of practice, the light will illuminate the body. Knowing the world’s wrongs and refraining from useless acts, the heart naturally achieves spiritual penetration.

It is said: Heaven and earth, water and fire, wind—the five phases of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—unite to form the true. Like a towering peak built of piled stones, it scatters when touched and shatters when struck. To restore success—how easily can this be achieved?
