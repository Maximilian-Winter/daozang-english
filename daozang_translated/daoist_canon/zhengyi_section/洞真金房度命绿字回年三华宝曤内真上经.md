*The Cavern of Perfection: The Golden Chamber Scripture for Delivering Life, the Green-Writ Scripture of Rejuvenation, and the Three-Flowered Treasure Radiance’s Inner Perfection Upper Scripture*

On the seventh day of the seventh month in the ren-wu year of the first reign of the August Emperor, at the mid-hour, the Supreme Perfected Warden of the Southern Culmen, Keeper of the Registers, prostrated himself before the Jade Pavilion and inquired of the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning, the Jade Emperor:

"Though I am unworthy, I am a scion of the imperial lineage, my life endowed with stellar roots. Through nine transformations, I have gestated in the nectar of jade, my three cinnabar spirits flourishing in radiant splendor. At the auspicious dawn, I inherited the imperial mantle, aspiring to the Nine Mysteries. I have studied the numinous canons, contemplated the true, and invoked the spirits. I have maintained a perpetual fast within the jade precincts, never faltering, and through kalpas of discipline, my name has been inscribed in the imperial registers. I have ascended to the office of Supreme Controller, overseeing the myriad immortals—yet I have not received the method for delivering life.

The revolutions of fate advance, and time does not abide. I humbly beseech the gift of a precious formula to deliver later worthies."

Thereupon, the Lord of the Dao, the Celestial Worthy, addressed the Supreme Perfected Warden of the Southern Culmen:

"The formula for delivering life through the Golden Chamber and reversing the years is concealed within the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens, in the Golden Terrace and Jade Chamber of the Nine-Bend Chamber, where three thousand jade maidens attend to the sacred texts. This Dao is profound and subtle, not to be fathomed by median perfected beings. By ancient statute, it is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas."

Those who practice this method shall share the same root as the ninefold *qi*, their radiance equaling the Three Luminaries, and their existence enduring as long as Heaven and Earth.

After one recitation, the stomach and viscera shall be permeated with vital fluids; after ten, clarity shall dawn, and speech with spirits shall become possible; after a hundred, the immortal embryo shall form within; after a thousand, one shall ascend through the void; after ten thousand, the Dao shall be perfected, the rank of Immortal Minister attained, and one shall ride the mist and mount the void to ascend before the August Emperor.

Now I impart this to you—practice it with utmost care.

Thereupon, the Five Elders of the Immortal Capital in the Southern Palace commanded Sima Dingsian, the Perfected Warden of the Upper Realms, to transmit the *Upper Scripture of the Golden Chamber’s Life-Delivering, Green-Writ, Year-Reversing Threefold Radiance of Inner Perfection* under sacred covenant to you. The oath was sworn before the Heaven of Immeasurable Life.

In the first year of the Central August Era, this transmission passed to the Upper Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen, the Venerable Master of the Myriad Beginnings, the Yellow Youth Perfected, the Golden Flower Immortal, the Jade Maiden of Supreme Harmony, the Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity, the Golden Portal Emperor Lord, and the Upper Minister Azure Youth Lord. Now, one copy is sealed within Mount Emei. Only those who possess the imperial charts of the Mysterious Plan, the green-writ scriptures of the Upper Clarity, and the golden bones and jade viscera of immortality shall receive this text.

Yet as the Three Dao revolve and the Nine Yang respond in due time, those of the original Primordial August lineage who practice the true Dao, and whose names are already inscribed in the registers of immortality, shall rightfully obtain this scripture. Those who receive it must treasure and conceal it—beware of reckless disclosure.

Within the Divine Capital Palace, twenty-four myriad Upper Perfected Immortals have cast golden tablets, inscribed with silver-bound characters in purple ink. In unison, they recite this scripture, their jade-like voices resounding through the Nine Heavens, communicating with spirits and invoking numinous power, reversing the blossoms of age and restoring youth. Their ritual processions and chanted praises surpass all other mysteries of the Cavern Realms. Thus they deliver life, sharing the same root as Heaven and Earth. Those who attain this Dao shall ascend to become Upper Immortals.

This scripture is the jade composition of the Most High, the numinous text of the Supreme Emperor. It distributes itself within a single form, governing the hundred passages of the body. After one recitation, its profound principles shall naturally become clear; after ten, one’s countenance shall revert to youth; after a hundred, the immortal embryo shall form within; after a thousand, one shall sit in the midst of disappearance; after ten thousand, the Dao shall be perfected, and one shall ascend to the morning light in broad daylight.

Those who maintain long-term purity in seclusion, untouched by worldly dust, shall find the Dao descending without fail—ascension to immortality shall be but a matter of days. For those of sincere devotion who cannot yet withdraw from the world, let them dwell among others while maintaining a separate chamber, observing purity, burning incense, and performing morning and evening rites. By reciting this sacred text, they may avert disasters, repel myriad afflictions, dissolve misfortunes in the Upper Palace, and eradicate sins in the Nine Yin. After ten thousand recitations, their accumulated merit shall carry them to the Cloud Chambers.

In practicing the method of life-deliverance, one should choose the day of one’s natal destiny, the day of the Grand Year Star, an *jiazi* day, or one of the eight solar terms. Entering the chamber and facing east, ingest *qi* nine times, visualizing the Great Emperor Lord, then bow twice. Turn to the south, ingest *qi* nine times, visualizing the Upper Perfected Lord of the Southern Culmen, then bow twice. Turn to the west, ingest *qi* nine times, visualizing the Lord of Longevity of the Three Heavens, then bow twice. Turn to the north, ingest *qi* nine times, visualizing the Most High Lord of the Void, then bow twice. Alternatively, one may face east throughout, bowing in the heart toward the four directions while ingesting *qi*.

Upon completion, face the direction of one’s natal destiny, click the teeth thirty-six times, and swallow *qi* thirty-six times. Then face the Grand Year Star, draw *qi* twenty-four times, and conclude by facing north to recite the scripture. Ten recitations constitute one cycle; upon finishing, ingest one *Golden Chamber Life-Preserving Talisman* per cycle, matching the number of recitations. This practice shall communicate with spirits and attain perfection, allowing one to perceive the eight directions while seated, regulate the hundred passages, and gather the myriad *qi*—thus achieving longevity, matching the lifespan of Heaven and Earth, and sharing the same age as the Three Luminaries.

After facing north and holding the scripture, click the teeth thirty-six times, visualizing five-colored purple clouds filling the chamber, shrouding it in mist. Silently intone the incantation:

*"Mysterious, mysterious, ninefold qi,*
*the supreme Dao gives birth to the Upper Primordial.*
*Three wheels empty as jade,*
*five revolutions deliver life as clouds.*
*Reversing the years within the Nine Imperials,*
*ten thousand recitations divide the Dao.*
*How vast and desolate the Great Desert—*
*solely meditate on the Emperor Unity Lord.*
*Within the Golden Chamber they merge,*
*embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages."*

Then begin reciting the scripture.

Upon completing the recitation, visualize within the chamber the spontaneous arising of purple *qi*,
billowing and surging, entering your body
through nose, mouth, and both ears,

purple script of the Upper Clarity,
having received this text, are destined for immortality,

guarding those whose bodies follow the Dao.

In practicing this Way,
do not tread upon filth or enter defilement,
nor consume the five pungents, raw or rank meats,
lest you offend the viscera’s spirits,
injure truth, or violate *qi*—
such acts bar entry to immortality.

**Golden Chamber’s Life-Delivering, Years-Returning Upper Perfected Jade Talisman**
On each day of your destiny,

sending down the Jade Dawn,
delivering life and returning years,
sun and moon share a single root,
soaring through the Great Void,
ascending into the Emperor’s Dawn.

When inscribing the talismans, always face the kingly direction above,
knock the teeth thirty-six times,
and raise the prayer:
*"Celestial numina flourish in splendor,
the nine apertures grow solemn and clear,
the five officials and six palaces,
their divine radiance fresh and bright.
The Three Origins are filled and secured,
the ten thousand *qi* brim and overflow.
The Golden Chamber delivers life,
the green script reverses aging.
Thrice refined, the nine apertures
ascend into the Great Clarity,
the Three Luminaries shine as one,
heaven and earth merge in union,
soaring through the Mysterious Void,
roaming and feasting in the Purple Court."*

Conclude, then swallow *qi* forty-six times and cease.
Then ingest the talisman.

To practice the Way of Delivering Life and Returning Years,
on each *gui* day of the sixth month,
draw one *hu* of Northern Spring water.
On the day of your destiny,
take one *jin* each of angelica root, peach bark, and [missing character] leaves,
boil them together until bubbling,
and bathe at noon.
When about to bathe,
face your destiny and knock the teeth nine times,
visualizing three Jade Lads holding towels to your left,
two Jade Maidens bearing incense to your right,
a canopy of purple clouds and floral hues arrayed before and behind.
Softly intone:
*"Heaven and earth are thoroughly clear,
washing away filth and dust,
refining and transforming the nine paths,
returning the form to Great Perfection.
The hundred passages receive spirit,
each joint is renewed,
clarity and emptiness oversee and reflect,
inner and outer unfold in full.
The day is auspicious, the hour favorable,
delivering life and returning years.
Jade Lads and Jade Maidens,
hold towels for me,
mystic clouds and purple canopy,
adorn my body,
that I may live long,
heaven and earth sharing a single root."*

Conclude, then bathe.
After bathing, return to the chamber,
lie with the head to the east,
apply powder to adorn yourself,
covering the entire body.
Rub both palms until warm,
wipe the face fourteen times,
and softly intone:
*"The *qi* of the Celestial Mystery is clear,
my body is already refined.
Dust and filth dissolve and vanish,
the nine nines receive spirit,
transforming me,
returning me to youthful form."*

Conclude, then draw *qi* thirty-six times and swallow, then cease.
Practicing this Way for three years,
the old form’s skin wholly sheds,
the flowery bones regenerate,
the body shines with jade light,
the face and hair take on a golden countenance.

This is the wondrous method among all Ways,
not to be transmitted to the untrue.
Those who lightly disclose it will see their seven ancestors tortured,
endlessly consigned to the offices of ghosts.
Disciples must practice in secret,
only then may they attain immortality.

When receiving the Way of Delivering Life and Returning Years,
follow the regulations:
master and disciple each observe a nine-day fast,
or three days, or five,
and offer silk according to the year’s tally,
one *chi* per year,
along with a golden figurine weighing two *liang*, four *zhu*, and one *xing*,
as a pledge to the Nine Heavens for delivering life,
a token of the transformed body.
Those who practice without pledging
will not draw the Way’s response,
thought will not awaken spirit,
violating regulations and transgressing prohibitions
will be examined by the Right Office.
Practitioners must be clearly cautious.

The Perfected of Western City transmitted this to Wei Huacun at the Yangluo Palace,
and now seals one copy within the Yangluo Mountains.

Here ends the *Upper Scripture of the Inner True Three Floral Treasures of the Green Script for Delivering Life and Returning Years in the Golden Chamber of the Cavern-Real*.
